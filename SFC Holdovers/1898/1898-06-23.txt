| SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 22-Major General i
I William R. Shafter is a man of action. He began disem- !
> barking his men from transports at Baiquiri and Juragua j
j at noon to-day. In an incredibly short time nearly all ;
\ those who are to be used at Santiago were on shore. !
Baiquiri. one of the places of landing, is about fifteen miles east of Santiago, and the bay
is large and well protected. Juragua. on the Bay of Baconao, is a place nearer to the destination of
the troops. It is only twelve miles from Santiago and has a smaller harbor than that of Baiquiri.
YViu'lf the troops were going ashore the ships of -Admiral Sampson's squadron threw shells
into several places in the neighborhood where the Spaniards were reported to have massed to at
tempt to prevent the landing. A large body of Cubans worked valiantly in the rear of the Span
iards, and when the first bodies of our troops reached land and began to shoot they very quickly
drove the enemy into the hands of the insurgents.
The battle-ship Texas took a lively part in the work, and took the minds of a great many
Spaniards away from the scene by throwing shells into Mazamono, twenty miles west of Baiquiri,
and into the west batteries of Cabanas. One man on the Texas, whose name I could not learn,
was killed..
This was intended as a diversion and was a most successful one, as the greater part of the
Spanish forces evidently were mistaken as to the places chosen for the landing.
General Shafter's plan of invasion involved, first, an attack on Manterola, west of Santi
ago, by the Cubans under General Rabi; second, the shelling of the Mazamorra blockhouse by the
warships, and, third, the shelling of the hills overlooking every cove where a landing might be
effected east of the harbor. A group consisting of coal transports was formed to the west to lead
the Spaniards into believing that a landing would take place there as soon as Mazamorra was
taken.
At daybreak the enemy saw the counterfeit transports sailing- to the west, but they did not
see the transports coming in from the east, the latter gathering off Baconao. With them was one
battle-ship and one cruiser, the gunboats Helena, St. Louis and Suwanee and several auxiliary
yachts to cover the landing. Fires began to blaze in the town, showing the Spaniards were de
stroying it.
It was a beautiful day. The water was smooth. The boats were towed beside the tran
sports whose troops were to go first. The decks of the transports, now forty hours off Santiago,
were crowded with troops, impatient to land. Spanish riflemen dotted the hills.
The strategic game opened at 8 o'clock this morning. General Rabi's 2000 Cubans at
tacked the Spanish at Mazamorra. The Texas at the same time ran close in shore and opened fire
on the blockhouse in the back part of Cabanas Bay. The Estrella battery opened on the Texas.
The Spanish shots came near, for the range was short.
The Texas silenced the battery in forty minutes. A Spanish field battery ran down the
beach and opened on the Texas. It was driven off by the rapid-fire guns. Again it opened and
again it was driven off.
In the meantime the Spanish and Cubans were hotly engaged and the noise of fierce rifle
firing was heard. Cervera's ships in the harbor opened on the Cubans on a plateau at the little
Bay of Julici, where is the hut that William M. Tweed lived in when he landed in Cuba.
A yacht believed to be the Scorpion began firing to the hills, and as another diversion the
slopes and harbor of Juragua were shelled by the Helena, Newport and Bancroft and the yacht
Vixen. Shrapnel burst all over the hillsides and the Spanish riflemen fled.
Still another diversion was created when the battle-ship left the convoy and returned to
the fleet. Sampson, leaving Schley in command, ordering him to smash Cervera if he came out
of the harbor, steamed down to Baconao to superintend the naval part of the disembarkation.
The .gunboats continued to rake the shore. The lowa took a hand and engaged the water bat
teries beneath Morro, silencing them. The gunboats continued raking Juragua with shells. The
Texas kept on firing and so did the Scorpion. The ships stretched for many miles in line of battle.
The Xew York opened on Baconao, clearing the beach.
Bugle calls rang over the water. The troops clambered into the boats and began landing.

information that the occupation of Manila

however, a new factor was added
to the situation. The German

strongly opposed a bombard

WASHINGTON, June 22. â Official dispatches received to
night by both Secretary Alger and Secretary Long indicated
that the landing of troops near Santiago was progressing most
favorably. The first landing was effected at Baiquiri this morn
ing and with comparatively slight resistance. This was stated
in a dispatch received this evening by Secretary Alger, which,
though brief, was full of news and meaning. It follows:

Secretary Alger expressed himself as delighted at the expe
dition with which the landing of the troops was being effected
and with the fact that no serious obstacle was being offered by
the enemy. He construed the text of General Shafter's message
to mean that the enemy had made merely a nominal and in-
effective resistance by firing from the hills at long range.
Shortly after Secretary Alger received this dispatch Secre
tary Long received a more extended cablegram from Admiral
Sampson. It, too, was dated at Playa del Este at 6:50 o'clock

this evening. The text of the dispatch, translated from the Navy
Department cipher, is as follows:

The New Orleans, Detroit, Castine, Wasp and Su- _

In both army and navy circles the information contained in
the dispatches of General Shatter and Admiral Sampson was re
ceived with intense satisfaction. The landing of so large a body
of troops as General Shafter at present has under his command
is a task of immense proportions. A prominent official of the
War Department said to-night the complete debarkation of the
troops, animals and field guns and supplies within a week after
their arrival off the Cuban coast would be a task well accom
plished. It is probable, in the opinion of the officer referred J:o,
that only a partial landing of the troops was effected to-day,
and that the landing will be continued from day to day until
completed. It is not unlikely, too, that the troops will be landed
at several places along the coast, of course within a short dis
tance of the headquarters which General Shafter will establish
for himself.
Admiral Sampson's dispatch indicated that he was carrying
out his instructions thoroughly to clear a way for the landing of
troops. The demonstration which he made with the Texas be
fore Cabanas, which is just west of Santiago, may easily have led
the Spaniards to suppose that a general landing was to be at
tempted in that immediate vicinity. It was evident from the text
of Admiral Sampson's dispatch that a landing had already been
effected near Guantanamo, as he noted that communication by
telegraph had been re-established at this point, and that the
channel had been cleared of submarine mines.
In the opinion of naval officers the landing at Guanta
namo was of marines rather than of land forces. The cable
station through which the American commanders will communi
cate with the departments in this city has been established, as
shown by the dates of the dispatches received this evening, at
Playa del Este, a small place directly on the coast and about
fifteen miles east of Santiago. The change was made from Camp
McCalla to Playa del Este in order that the station might be
nearest the scene of action.
CONTINUOUS FIGHTING â¢(
MAY BE EXPECTED j
Spaniards Likely to Oppose the Ad
vance of the Troops to San
tiago.
NEW YORK. June 22.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: The important messages
summarizing the situation near Santia
go received this evening by the secre
taries of War and Navy respectively,
were highly gratifying to those gentle
men. Secretary Alger expressed satis
faction when copies were laid before
him. There will be no delay in the for
warding of troops. General Shafter's
instructions do not permit him to re
main idle and thus give the enemy time
to strengthen his position and lay am
bushes for the troops.
The landing place is connected by
road with Buquirl. two miles away,
which is connected with Santiago de
Cuba by railroad. Over the bed of this
roadâ no doubt exists that the tracks
have been destroyedâ the supplies for
the troops will be sent, while the men
themselves, taking advantage of the
topography of the country, will cover
as quickly as possible the fifteen miles
between them and Santiago. It is not
believed that a forward movement will
be attempted hr.<r,r P to-morrow morn
ing at daybreak, so the troops, resting
on their arms to-night, will probably
have to resist the bushwhacking tac
tics which were practiced on the ma
rines at Ouantanamo.
It is stated by well Informed army
strategists that at least three days will
expire befor i the army reaches San
tiago de Cuba and begins active opera
tions against the enemy. General
Shafter will not attempt to hurry his
men and it is probable that between
the hours of 11 and 3 during the day
the men will be given an oppor
tunity to rest, while their Cuban allies
keep the Spaniards at a distance. The
Cubans will be employed as advance
guards so as to expose any ambushes
that the Spapiards may lay. Active,
continuous fighti-g may, therefore, be
expected hourly from the time the
troops begin their march toward San
tiago until the city is In their hands.
In the meantime Rear Admiral
Sampson's ships will not be idle. It is
understood it will be their duty to de
stroy every vestige of fortifications
within reach of their guns and block
ade the harbor so closely as to pre
vent the escape of Cervera's ships.

PETALUMA. June 22.â Company C
of this city received an order to-day to
be prepared to leave the armory at a
moment's notice to proceed to a place
of bivouac. The outside members were
immediately sent for and are arriving
In town, and will be quartered in the
armory. A squad of twenty men from
San Leandro who enlisted in the com
pany arrived to-night. The company
is fully equipped, and the luggage is
being packed. The physical examina
tion will be begun on Thursday morn
ing by local physicians. There are 120
men on the rolls. No married men ex
cept Lieutenant A. H. Cassiday, com
manding, will be taken by the com
pany. Many members of Company H
of Napa, which was not taken by the
call, are Glamoring for admission into
Company C.
A sensation has been caused here by
the resignation of Captain Thomas
Maclay, for the past six years com
mander of Company C. He is a strong
personal friend of Colonel D. B. Fair
banks, and is City Clerk and cashier of
the Wickersham Bank. Although
noted for his fearlessness, he for busi
ness reasons did not volunteer, and
some time ago sent his resignation to
headquarters. There are many candi
dates for the captaincy.
Company C has Just returned from a
practice march to Point Pedro, thirty
miles from here, and over a rugged
road. It spent two days at Camp
Dickson. where regular military duties
were observed. The men stood the trip
well. On the return they were met a
mile below town by an escort of twenty
members under Second Lieutenant
Emerson, and the company military
band, and escorted to the armory,
where an impromptu reception was
held.
SANTA ROSA. June 22.â Quite a fu
ror was created here to-day when word
was received that Company E was
called out. At 1 o'clock all bells in the
city were rung and all the whistles
blown to notify members of the com
pany of their good fortune. This even
ing the company in full uniform
marched to the train to meet Captain
Hart-en, who came from San Fransico.
The company consists of 103 officers
and men. To-night a big demonstration
was held at the armory under the aus
pices of the Red Cross Society. Patri

boys will be given an ovation when
they leave.
SAN RAFAEL, June 22.â The mem
bers of Company D are elated over
their call to the front, and all day the
armory was filled with a crowd making
preparation to go. It is believed the
company can leave by Friday. The
members assembled this evening for
physical examination at the call of
Captain William Elliott. Tomales has
risen in patriotic fervor and subscribed
$50 for the boys' assistance in getting
ready. Other donations are expected
WOODLAND, June 21.â Members of
Company F are watching anxiously
the developments in the organization
of the regiment which is California's

body in the United States service, and
there will be a great disappointment if
they are not ordered out. There are
about 125 names on the roll and there
seems to be no doubt that a sufficient
number of them will pass examination
to enable the company to be mustered
in at the maximum strength.

CERVERA MAY MAKE
A DESPERATE DASH
Said to Be Willing to Risk a Fight
in Order to Get Away With
Some of His Ships.
NEW YORK, June 22. â A special dispatch from Santiago de Cuba, June
20, via Kingston, Jamaica, to-day, says that Cubans have brought information
to Admiral Sampson that Admiral Cervera is prepared to make a desperate
effort to take his ships out of Santiago harbor at the first favorable opportunity.
The Spanish warships, it is reported, have been coaled to their full capacity and
the crew? are refused shore leave. Every night the vessels drop down the bay
to be prepared to embrace the first favorable opportunity to attempt a dash
past the blockading squadron. It is said to be the Spanish admiral's hope to
save at least a portion of his ships from capture, and, in a fight, to sink sorqe
of the American craft.
ALGER AND LONG ARE NOT IN ACCORD.
Secretary of War Insinuates That Sampson Blocked the
Channel to Avoid a Fight With Cervera.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washineton, June 22.
Regarding the suggestion that the wrecked Merrimac did not effectively
block the channel, and that there was grave danger of Cervera making a des
perate dash at night with his ships, in the hope of escape or destroying some
transports, Secretary Alger expressed the hope the 'channel was no", blocked,
in order that our own ships might force an entrance and demolish the Spanish
squadron. He said he would not give a cent for an enemy that feared to take
so-called "desperate" chances to inflict injuries to an antogonist. War was a
matter of desperate chances, he said, and brave men could not hesitate on ac
count of mere dangers involved.
This frank statement will hardly be relished by Secretary Long, who has
just written a letter to Constructor Hobson commending not only his bravery,
but hi? effective work. There appears, also, to be lack of harmony between the
two departments. Secretary Alger, who has been criticized by naval officers
for slowness in moving troops, seizes this chance to retaliate by criticizing
Admiral Sampson's attempt to block the harbor channel.
It is easy to read between the lines of his interview. He seeks covertly to
convey the impression that Sampson attempted to block the channel in order
to obviate the. necessity of entering the harbor to give battle to Cervera. Ad
miral Sampson's cablegram of Monday stating that the Merrimac will not pre
vent the egress of Spanish warships was confirmed to-day by the receipt of the
message of Assistant Engineer Crank, who also expresses that opinion.

AN ALLIANCE
Lansdowne Approves
Chamberlain's Views.
WAR SECRETARY'S SPEECH
ADVOCATES CLOSED FRIEND-
SHIP WITH AMERICA.
Results That May Follow the Change
of Sentiment That Has Come
Over the Two Coun
tries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June 22.â The Marquis of
Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War,
addressed the Conservative Unions of
London to-day, indorsed the recent
speech of the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, in which Mr. Chamberlain ex
pressed the hope that the day would
come when the stars and stripes and
the union jack would wave together
over an Anglo-Saxon alliance.
Lord Lansdowne said he found noth
ing in Mr. Chamberlain's speech to of
fend the common sense of the patriot
ism of Great Britain.
"We should be wanting in foresight,
he continued, "if we failed to realize
that the time might come when our
revenues would no longer flow so freely,
when the British taxpayer would grow
weary of building more and more bat
tleships and raising more and more
battalions, and when, whether we liked
it or not, we might have to consider
whether we could afford to stand
alone."
Lord Lansdowne insisted that it was
in the highest degree desirable that the
colonies should be encouraged to take a
more active share in the defense of the
empire. There was nothing ridiculous
in the idea of a closer friendship with
America. To his mind, there could be
no more inspiring ideal than that such
understanding between two nations
sprung from the race and having so
many common interestsâ nations which
together would be predominant in the
world's commerce and industry.
Was there anything preposterous, lje
asked, in the hope that these two na
tions should be found, he would not say
in a hard and fast alliance, of offense
and defense, but closely connected in
their diplomatic relations, absolutely
frank and unreserved in their interna
tional councils 'and ready wherever the
affairs of the world were threatening
with disturbance to throw their influ
ence in the same scale?
"Depend upon it," said he, in conclu
sion, "these are no mere idle dreams or
hazy Inspirations. The change which
has come over the sentiment of each

GERMAN PAPERS AND
THE PHILIPPINES
LONDON, June 23.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Times, commenting
on the continued discussion of the
Philippine question, says: "There would
be a storm of indignation in the Ger
man press if the United States were
to become master of the Philippines
while Germany got nothing. In the
view of many German politicians, any
thing would be better than that, and
they would even prefer to see the in
tervention of several European powers
to protect the life and property of their
subjects from the rebels, followed by
the acquisition of a naval station for
each of them.
"There is, in fact, a strong inclination
to repeat the Chinese drama at Kiao
chau wherever an opportunity is
afforded. Relatively, to what Germany
already possesses, she has everything
to gain by such a policy of fair shares
all around. There can, however, be
little doubt that no European power or
combination of powers will venture to
prevent the United States and Great
Britain from settling the future of the
Philippines conjointly, or at least un
der the Protection of their conjoint
naval forces. Continental opinion would
not only speedily acknowledge the
strength of an Anglo-American naval
alliance, but would be practically
unanimous against incurring the risk
of the commercial consequences of a
breach with the United States."

Says We Will "Have to Paint Our
White Elephant Brown and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June 22.â Chauncey M.
Depew has partly recanted his opposi
tion to imperialism as the result of the
latest war developments. During his
sojourn he has had unusual opportuni
ty to learn the sentiment of politicians
and of the public. He will return to
New York by the Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse on Friday.
Requested by the correspondent of
the Associated Press to summarize his j
views of French and English opinion I
on war questions, Mr. Depew said:
"The sentiment in France is about |
what it would be in the United States
if England and France were fighting,
and every paper in the United States
were daily abusing the French, de
nouncing the injustice of their going to
war, picturing them as a race of rob
bers, shopkeepers and pigs, declaring
that England was poor and the undar
dog, and holding up France as actuated
by nothing but a pure brute desire to
steal England's property.
"That's what all the papers but
three are doing in France. When we
also consider that France and Spain
are both of the Latin race, and of the
same religion, and that Frenchmen
have hundreds of millions invested in
Spain, we need not be surprised that
the feeling there is practically unani
mous against us. I think only one man
prevents the feeling taking acute form.
That is M. Hanotaux. the Minister of
Foreign Affairs. But for him, the
French Chamber of Deputies might
have taken action, openly siding with
Spain.
"There is no doubt that had Maniia
been a Spanish victory there would
have been an illumination of Paris. It
was on account of this sentiment thai
I endeavored to give the causes of the
war when the Temps and Matin asked
for Interviews. T was told it was a rev
elation to the French and led to a ma
terial modification of French opinion.
They had not heard our side before."
When the talk turned on England,
the interviewer suggested that the sym
pathies of the British aristocracy were
largely with the Spanish. Mr. Depew
said he had not found them so.
"I have met with many of them dur
ing my visit," he added, "and found
them all enthusiastically with us. That
is the best test. The majority of the
people do not want a mere under
standing; they want a hard and fast
alliance. If Continental Europe inter
venes on the side of Spain Great Brit
ain would go so far as we were willing
to make an alliance."
Asked if his opinion on imperial pol
icy had changed, Mr. Depew replied:
"There are difficulties in my position
which did not exist when I took it up.
New conditions are arising all the
while with the progression of the war
which make it difficult to keep out or
get out of this colonizing business.
We must take into view the temper of
our people, who would certainly never
give any colonies back to Spain. The
transferring of any of them to a Eu
ropean power would lead to a Euro
pean war in sixty days. It looks
as though we would have to paint our
white elephant brown and teach him to
work."

Engineer Craok Explains Why
Brave HÂ°kson's Missior) Was
Not a Success.
NEW YORK, June 22.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following- Notwithstanding the heroic
attempt made by Assistant Naval Con
structor Hobson and the men under his
command to "bottle up ' Cervera's fleet
in the harbor of Santiago, the success
that us:ua.)y attends the brave did not
reward their efforts. Assistant Engineer
R. K. Crank, who was the senior engi
neer of the collier Merrimac, testifies
to this fact in an interesting letter
which has been received by an officer
on duty in the Navy Department.
"From the bearings of the Merrimac
(whose mast and smoke pipe could be
plainly seen) taken in the afternoon,"
he says, "it appears that she is lying
with her bow to seaward just above
Estrella Point, with her stern swung
around until she lies almost parallel
to the direction of the channel. From
the fact that she is completely sub
merged except her masts and smoke
pipe, it would seem she is sunk some
little distance from the right bank.
However, she is not lying across the
channel. So far as blocking the chan
nel, the attempt cannot be said to be
successful. It is probable the anchor
on the starboard quarter carried the
stoppers on the chain and also the bitts,
which were not very securely fastened
in the deck. And the chain must have
cut through the rail as far as the mid
ship section of the ship. This would
have permitted the stern to swing en
tirely around until the ship lay up and
down the channel."
As Mr. Crank assisted in putting the
Merrimac in condition to perform the
valuable service for which she was se
lected, his statements on this point are
interesting because of their accuracy.
He writes:
"All the preparations were made
with the greatest haste, as it was de
sired to send the ship before daybreak
on the morning of the 2d. One of the
ship's life boats was to be towed from
a line amidships on the starboard side.
Mr. Hobson wished to creep in, ap
proach the entrance from the westward
until he could shape his course, as
nearly as possible, directly for Estrella
Point. He wished to put the bow of
the ship near this point and then swing
across the channel abreast of this
point. When the ship was near enough
in his judgment, the bonnets were to
be knocked off, and the sea valves and
engines stopped. The helm was to be put
hard to port and the starboard bower
anchor let go. This would swing the
ship across the channel and check her
headway. When she had swung far
enough the quarter anchor was to be
let go to check her, and the mines ex
ploded. The strong flood tide was re
lied on to heel the ship to port and as
sist in sinking her. The powder
charges were about thirty-five feet
apart and ten feet below the water
line. The admiral was aboard until
nearly daylight. Signals to the men at
the anchors were to be given by means
of a rope attached to their wrists and
leading to the bridge. It was the in
tention for ,-Ã¼bson to remain on the
bridge until he felt the ship settle.
The other men as soon as each had
done the duty assigned him were to
jump over the side and make for the
boat. Life preservers were served out
as well as revolvers and ammunition
to all the men. Daylight breaking be
fore the plans were perfected, the ship
was not allowed to go in.
"About half past 1 Mr. Hobson came
on the bridge. AH the men who were
to go in with the shipâ Montague,
Cherett, Phillips, Diegnan, Murphy and
Kellyâ were called up and given final
instructions as to their duties. Every
thing was made ready below. The ship
was steaming in toward the entrance
at 'dead slow' so as enable the launches
to go over to the Texas and then catch
her. This was about half past 2 a. m.
The big black hull of the Merrimac
could be easily followed from the other
shops. At a quarter past 3 the first
shot w r as fired, coming from one of the
guns on the hill to the left (west) of
the entrance. The shot was seen to
splash seaward from the Merrimac,
having passed over her. The firing be
came general very soon after, being
especially fierce and rapid from the
batteries inside on the lert of the har
bor, probably from batteries on Cayo
Smith. The flashes and reports were
apparently those of rapid-fire guns,
ranging from small automatic guns to
4-lnch or larger. For fifteen minutes a
perfect fusillade was kept up. Then the
fire slackened and by half past 3 had
almost ceased. A close watch was kept
on the mouth of the harbor in order to
pick up the steam launch. There was
a little desultory firing about a quarter

to 4, when all became quiet At about
a quarter past 5 the launch was seen
steaming from east to west near or
across the mouth of the harbor. She
steamed back from east to west and
then began skirting the coast to the
west entrance. The battery on the hill
to the left opened fire on her, but did
not make good practice. The launch
continued her course as far westward as
the small cove and then headed for the
Texas. Mr. Powell reported that 'No
one had come from the entrance of the
harbor.'
"Cadet Powell said that Hobson
m'ssed the entrance at first, having
gone too far to westward, and he al
rrcet ran aground. The launch picked
up the entrance here and directed the
Meirimac. From the launch the collier
was seen until she rounded a ban! in
tl'e channel and until the helm had
been put hard to port to swing her into
position across the channel. Apparently
the inner batteries opened fire lust as
the collier rounded the bend and was
swinging into position, probably when
she was first seen by the men at the
batteries on Cayo Smith. It was from
this side that the heaviest firing came.
A large number of projectiles whistled
around the launch. The batteries on
Estrella Point kept up a very hot fire.
Powell heard or saw and counted seven
explosions, -which were undoubtedly
those of powder charges under the col

as long as he deemed it safe to do bo.
No -wreckage or bodies floated out, as
everything was swept inside by the
strong flood tide. The enemy evidently
had a large number of automatic rapid
fire guns from the number and rapidity
! of the shots.
"There was probably no one in the
fleet who did not think all the seven
men had perished. In the afternoon,
j much to the surprise of every one, a
I tug flying a flaÂ°- of truce came out of
the entrance. The Vixen, flying a table
cloth, went to meet the tug. A Spanish
j officer went aboard the Vixen from the
tug and was taken aboard the flagship.
Not long afterward a signal was made
that Murphy of the lowa was saved

o'clock another signal was made on the

SPANIARDS AT HAVANA
PRETEND CONFIDENCE
Blanco Denies That He Has Forbid
den Exchange of Prisoners, but
Holds on to Hobson.
HAVANA, June 22, 4 p. m.â There Is
absolutely no foundation for the report
published in th.c United States of an
attempt to assassinate Captain General
Blanco by a member of the volunteers,
whose brother, it was alleged, had been
shot for complicity in a plot against
the Government.
Complete tranquility reigns in Ha
vana. The greatest confidence is felt
that the Spanish forces will success
fully cope with the Americans, which
were yesterday reported to have ar
rived off the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba. There is great enthusiasm
among the troops and volunteers, who
are all anxious to fight against the in
vaders.
Captain General Blanco denies that
he has decided that there shall be no
exchange of prisoners with the United
States. At the same time the Captain
General says he cannot allow the ex
change of Lieutenant Hobson' and the
other members of the party who sailed
the Merrimac into the mouth of the
harbor at Santiago de Cuba for the
reason that the lieutenant and his com
panions had opportunities for seeing
the harbor and its defenses. The most
common prudence, the Captain General
says, would forbid that these men be
now given their liberty as proposed by
the United States.
Captain General Blanco added that
he had not forbidden the approach of
vessels bearing flags of truce, but had
only ordered that no vessel be per
mitted to approach -within six miles of
the shore, so that it would be made
impossible for officers of the United
States to make drawings of or inspect
fortresses. â¦

Seven contact mines were taken from

Alleged Stand of Alger
and McKinley.
MUST "FISH OR CUT BAIT."
TALK OF SENDING THE COM
MANDER TO PORTO RICO.
Report Agreed Upon for the Revival
of the Grade of Lieutenant Gen
eral, but Miles May Not
Get It.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 22.
It has been quietly gossiped that
President McKinley and Secretary Al
ger were displeased with General
Miles. A week ago it was reported on
seemingly good authority that he had
been recalled from the South by Presi
dent McKinley and given to under
stand that he must "fish or cut bait."
This is the exact language used by a
War Department official who gave this
Information to The Call correspondent
a week ago. It was not credited by the
best informed army people at that
time, however, and newspaper dis
patches from Washington stated on
Secretary Alger's authority that there
was no truth in the report of any un
pleasantness or dissatisfaction. It has
been very apparent for the last few
duy.s, however, that something is
wrong. An evening paper to-night
prints this cautious paragraph:
"There was no one in administra
tion circles to-day willing to take the
responsibility of saying that General
Miles will go to Porto Rico and be
superseded as iirst military adviser to
the President. In fact, there was very
apparent unwillingness to discuss the
matter at all. It was rumored to-day
that in the event of being superseded
General Miles will be asked to be re
tired.'"
FOB LIEUTENANT QENEBAL.
Joint Besolution Beviving the Grade
Agreed On.
WASHINGTON, June 22.â The House
Committee on Military Affairs has
agreed on and reported a joint resolu
tion reviving the grade of lieutenant
general in the army. It authorizes the
President, whenever he deems it expe
dient, to appoint a lieutenant general,
to be selected from those officers in the
military service distinguished for cour
age, skill and ability, the limitation in
the biir as to the choice being made
from officers "not below the grade of
major general" being stricken out by
the committee.
The eommiMee disclaims any idea of
having any single military commander
in view, and asserts that the object is
to permit the selection by the President
to command the armies of the United
States of one who should have higher
rank than any other officer, this being
deemed essential to efficiency of man
agement.
While Major General Miles has fre
quently been urged for a lieutenant
generalship, the members of the com
mittee claim that his name is no more
than a suggestion, and that the resolu
tion leaves it open for the President to
decide whom he shall appoint, the ap
pointee, however, being subject to con
firmation by the Senate.
It was pointed out by a member of
the committee that if there should be
a battle at Santiago, for instance, in
which General Shafter should figure,
and he should perform some heroic
work, he would stand a fair show for
â  which rose to the surface and fortu
; nately did not explode.
Commander McCalla suspected there
were other mines in the harbor and de
termined to take them up. He sent
four boats with picked crews to do the
work. Lieutenant Broughton com
manded one boat from the Marblehead
and Ensign Walter R. Gherardi, son of
the rear admiral, the other. The boats
from the Dolpl;in were in charge of En
signs Coole and Stirling.
As soon as the boats had started the
two warships took positions close in
and swept the shore with their rapid
fire guns. The four little boats steamed
boldly up the channel, paying no heed
to the bullets that spattered around
them, but attending strictly to /the
work of sweeping for the mines. They
had taken up seven by noon and then
abandoned the task for the day.
There is great enthusiasm in Camp
MrOalla, which is only a few miles east
of here, over the arrival of the trooris
at Santiago. One or two regiments we
e\pect will be landed here. The ma
rines are all in good health.
The officers of the navy believe Ad
miral Cervera h;.s moored his ships so
as to bring the port batteries in posi
tion to command the entrance to the
harbor. It is reported also the star
board batteries of all the ships have
been taken off and mounted on shore.
the coveted rank, and so with other
commanding officers, on whose actions
the selection might depend.
The committee also favorably re
ported the House bill giving to the ad
jutant general of the army, who is now
General Corbin, the rank, pay and al
lowance of a major general.
CONFERENCE WITH
LEADING PORTO RICANS
Establishment of a Protectorate Over
the Island May Be the
Outcome.
NEW YORK, June 22.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Con
siderable importance is attached in
Washington to the visit of Ramon H.
Todd, Secretary of the Porto Rican
Auxiliary Revolutionary Junta, who,
together with Dr. J. J. Henna, also a
prominent Porto Rican, left to-day
after having had a conference with
President McKinley, Secretary Alger
and General Miles, as to the best plans
to be adopted for the invasion of Porto
Rico. Mr. Todd has long been promi
nently connected with public affairs in
Porto Rico and it is the general opinion
that he is endeavoring to bring about
the establishment of a United States
protectorate until a stable form of gov
ernment is provided for the island.
Mr. Todd is wealthy and is as well
known in business as in the political
circles of his country. Dr. Henna is
widely known in the United States as
the author of a number of medical and
political books, and is an authority ou
all things pertaining to the island of
Porto Rico. He was a prominent dele
gate to the Pan-American Medical
Congress in Washington several years
ago. His wife is an American woman
and an heiress and Dr. Henna's sym
pathies are decidedly American.

June 22. â I visited yesterday the Cuban
camp on the coast twenty miles west of
Guantanamo. General de Castillo is In
command there and with 500 insurgents
holds a landing place where there is a
breakwater and the remains of an old
pier. It is a place where troops could
be put ashore easily, but it is too far
from Santiago. General Castillo tells
me that 18,000 American >v troops can
capture Santiago in ten days.
Two Spanish soldiers, who were cap
tured between Santiago and Guantana
mo report to General Castillo that food
is scarce in the city. The supply of
Hour has been exhausted and bread is
made from rice and cornmeal. The
prisoners state that the shells from the
Vesuvius caused absolute horror in
Santiago, where the people say the-
Americans throw earthquakes into the
harbor at night. None of the shells
struck the city. One hit the battery on
Cayo Smith, entirely demolishing it,
blowing the guns over the front of the
works and killing the whole garrison.
The shock was felt in Santiago itself.
I have confirmed the new* of the
disaster to the Reina Mercedes. Her
commander and eleven men were killed
and twent v -eight men were wounded.
Spanish Lieutenant Batista, who was
captured last week, wrote to the gen
eral commanding at Caimanera beg
ging that his exchange be speedily
made, and askiner that his wife and
family be fed and cared for during his
absence. The general replied in a note
in which he called Batista a coward,
and said that his family could starve.
Batista tore the Spanish rosette from
his hat and threw it into the sea. He
wrote to the general denying that he is
a coward, and declaring that the
Americans won because they shot bet
ter than the Spaniards, and had the
support of artillery and machine guns.
Notices have been posted in the
woods by Cuban scouts saying that
Spanish soldiers surrendering will be
well treated.
The marine camp is now well in
trenched and able to resist attack. The
health of the troops and men in the
fleet is excellent. It is reported that
there are many sick and wounded in
the Spanish forces.

the Philippines should pass into the
hands of England, as that would se
riously disturb the equilibrium in the
far East.
SENATE SEEKS SOME
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Wants to Know if Hobson Was Con
fined in Range of Fire and if
Marines' Bodies Were
Mutilated.
WASHINGTON, June 22.â 1n the
Senate to-day Davis of Minnesota,
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, asked immediate consideration
of the following resolution:
"Resolved, That the Secretary of the
Navy be directed to inform the Senate
whether Lieutenant Hobson and those
who were captured with him have been
confined by the Spanish authorities
within the line of fire or under the fire
of the United States fleet, and if so, at
what place or places they are or have
been so confined; also to inform the
Senate what efforts have been made to
effect the exchange of such prisoners,
and with what result; also to transmit
to the Senate copies of the correspond
ence or reports upon the subjects of
this inquiry."
The resolution was agreed to. Davis
then offered the following resolution,
which was also agreed to:
"That the Secretary of the Navy is
directed to inform the Senate whether
the bodies of the United States marines
or sailors who were recently killed in
battle at or near Santiago de Cuba
were mutilated after death by the
Spanish soldiery, and to transmit to the
Senate copies of the official correspond
ence and reports upon the subjects of
the inquiry." __
CAMARA'S RETURN
WOULD CAUSE RIOTS
So It Is Thought the Fleet Must at
Least Keep Out at
Sea.
LONDON, June 23.â The Gibraltar
correspondent of the Daily News says:
No credence need be given to rumors
that the Cadiz squadron will return to
that port. Admiral Caraara could not
return without riots at Cadiz and Mad
rid, particularly as he said at the ban
quet before his departure he would
neve r return before his flag had been
steeped in American blood. You will
find the next move of the squadron will
be to the Canaries.^
Bodies Not Mutilated.
WASHINGTON, June 22.â Surgeon-
General Van Reypen of the navy has
received full reports from the surgeon
with Admiral Sampson's fleet who
cared for the dead and wounded parti
cipants In the Guantanamo fight. Their
important feature is a definite state
ment that the corpes were not muti
lated, but that the severe wounds at
tributed to mutilation were the result
of a Mauser rifle ball.
Recruits for the Seventh.
LOS ANGELES, June 22.â Two hun
dred and sixty-seven recruits for the
Seventh Regiment, California Volun
teers, who have been recruited in
Southern California during the past few
days, left on a special train for San
Francisco to-day. They were given a
rousing sendoff and provided with
lunches and various articles for their
use.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 22.â The
Spanish Government in Cuba has been
makirtg advances to Insurgent leaders
endeavoring to win them from alle
giance to their cause.
One of the commissions of Virgillio
Lopez Charez. after he has reached
Manzanillo, is to see Bartholomeo Mas
so, who was an old friend and comrade
of Charez before the war, and make a
proposal to him. General Pando went
on a similar mission to General Gomez,
offering him large sums of money if he
would join the Spanish forces, and any
position he desired in the army.

OPIUM, MOSPHiNE
Or Cocaine "Habits" Now Pri-
vately Cured at Home.
A SIX DAYS' TREATMENT SENT ON TRIAL
BY MAIL TO ANY ONE WHO HONEST-
LY DESIRES TO BE CURED.
Remedy Contains No Opiates op Po'sons.
Cures the Dreaded 'Habits" Per-
manently Without Suffering.
Dr. Carlos Bruisard, a well-known prac-.
titioner of Cincinnati, Ohio, after many
years' close study has discovered a rem-
edy that permanently cures the mor-
ph.ne, opium, cocaine, laudanum and sim-
similar habits. The remedy cures without
causing pain, suffering or nervousness
and removes all desire for stimulants. No
opiates or other narcotics are contained
in the remedy, nor does the treatment
interfere with the patient's daily occupa-
tion. The cure is complete and perma-
nent and leaves the patient in a condi-
tion of perfect health.
Dr. Bruisard carries his ideas into prac-
tical effect by sending a six days' treat-
ment on trial to any one who actually de-
sires to be cured. This wili enable the
patient to test it at home or wherever
he may choose, and there is absolutely
no question that he will be cured.
Dr. Bruisard has saved thousands of
bright men and women from a life of
slavery and degradation. He has the
remedy. There is no doubt about it. It
is as certain to cure as the world is cer-
tain to revolve on its axis. This should
deeply interest the thousands who are
being daily dragged to their torture
by the terrible use of narcotics.
It is certainly a very generous act of
the doctor to send his remedy on trial
and thus let all see and realize that they
will be cured at their homes permanently,
without any suffering, detention from
business or loss of time.
"Write privately to Dr. Carlos Bruisard,
156 Glenn Bldg., Cincinnati, Ohio. The
utmost confidence prevails between the
doctor and his patients.

" I have used Ripans Tabules and they have done me lots of
good, at least my wife says they have," asserts William Donaldson,
a blacksmith. "After a hard day's work I would eat too much, I
guess," continued he, "and suffer like everything. My wife's brother
told me that Ripans Tabules had helped him and he thought they
would help me. I believe they have cured me, but I still take them
regular, for I Would not have them pains again for anything. My
partner said, after I was so much better, that I was ready to get well
anyhow, and that I would have got well without them. I believe
there are lots of people that are ready to get well just like I was.
They will get weli when they take the same medicine I did, and not
before. I have worked hard all my life, first on a farm and then in a
blacksmith shop, and have been troubled with dyspepsia ever since I
was 1 8 years old. Now I feel like I was sweet sixteen. I think
Ripans Tabules are a great medicine."

CLEVER ROGUE
Timber Land Swindle in
the North.
SHASTA AND TRINITY BITTEN
MANY VICTIMS OF A PLAUSIBLE
SCHEME.
The Sharper Cleans Up About $5000
From Speculators in the Two
Counties and Suddenly
Disappears.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, June 22.â For the past
two months a man named William
Woods, representing himself as the j
agent of a Scotch syndicate, has been j
quietly at work in Trinity and Shasta j
counties inducing people to locate tim- 'â¢
ber claims in the Trinity Center region j
of Trinity County. He made Redding j
his headquarters, and succeeded in rop- i
Ing in over 100 locators to exercise their I
timber rights on the representation ;
that he, as agent for the syndicate,
Would advance the necessary money |
with which to prove up and then take j
their locations off their hands at a con- I
siderable advance over the Government I
price.
Monday was the day set for the first |
lot of locators to appear at the Red- I
ding Land Office and prove up on their j
claims, and their failure to so prove up |
brought to the surface the details of
one of the biggest land swindles ever
attempted in Northern California.
William Woods, the promoter "or
agent of the alleged syndicate, is a man
well along in years, probably 55 or 60
years old, although at first blush he
would be taken to be considerably
younger, as he keeps both his hair and
mustache dyed. He took rooms with a
private family, and then began in a
quiet way to circulate among the peo
ple. Posing as the agent of a Scotch
syndicate with millions behind it, be
caused it to be known that his people
were bent on securing thousands of
acres of sugar-pine land in the virgin
Trinity forest of Northern California.
The man selected as a victim would
be approached with an otter of all the
way from $100 up to $350 for his timber
ritrht. It was represented that the syn
dicate had $5,000,000 behind it and that
there was $80,000 on deposit in the Bank
of Shasta County to be drawn on for
preliminary expenses. Many people
who had not exhausted their timber
rights snapped up his alluring proposi
tion. The schemer charged $35 for lo
cating each victim. There was a further
charge of $1 50 for having the neces- '
sary papers made out and $10 for pub- j
lication fee. This made a total pre
liminary outlay of $46 50 for each vic
tim.
The schemer asserted that in the fall
hundreds of other locations would be
made and that a newspaper would be I
immediately established in Weaverville j
to control the immense profits arising !
from the wholesale publication of the j
timber land notices. The Trinity Jour
nal and the Dunsmuir News and Her
ald are all three Zv&l of these publica
tions, many of which will never yield a
dollar. A railroad was going to be
built into the pine lands and sawmills I
and box factories would be established, j
The credulity of certain people was
preyed upon to such an extent that
many made up their minds to pull up
stakes here and move to the scene of
the operations of the syndicate.
On the 17th instant, three days before
the first proofs were to 112 made in the
land offieo, Woods packed up his ho
longings and 1 ft for pastures new. He
has m>t been seen or heard of since.
The people victimized have no recourse
at law, as by aerc-ping in advance t<>
transfer their locations is an infraction
of Federal law. The amount, as far as
heard from, which the schemer cleaned j
up from his project is $3500, and it may !
yet reach a total of $5000.
CHANGE IN THE ROUTE.
Course of the Proposed Marin Boule-
yard Altered.
SAN RAFAEL, June 22. -Considerable
feeling has bÂ«Â«B worked up among the
taxpayers throughout the county by a
change In the route .of the proposed bou
levarrl from this city to Tiburon. Before
the actu.il work of construction had been
begun plans were carefully formulated
and a route selected from here to Green
brae, thence across the marsh to what
1s known as the "old stone quarry," and
from that point over the old roadbed of
the North Pacific Coast Railway, con
necting with the county road running
from Alta to Tiburon, a distance of two
miles. It was calculated that by this
route Tiburon and Sausalito would have
equal shares in the benefits of the great
improvement and that the boulevard
would be an artery along which would
flow the produce of Tihiiron. Sausalito
Belvedere and Mill Valley from a net
work of connecting highways.
Rut the Supervisors have seen fit to
change the route, accepting one which
runs from the otd BtQne quarry around
by California City Point, skirting the hay
shore for a distance of nine miles and
finally terminating at Tiburon.
Despite the objection made to the
change on account of the fact that many
believed it to be made in the interest of
a few as against the well-being of the
many, the Supervisors, after a session
lasting all day yesterday and this morn
ing, ratified the change.

BEET FIELD PESTS.
Three Insects Against Which the
Farmer Must Wage War.
SALINAS, June 22.â Horticultural Com
missioner McGarvey has been investi
gating the beet pest which Professor
Stirling recently called to the attention
of Professor Hilgard, in charge of the
agricultural department of the State
University. He says tljat while the mag
got is found to the same extent in nearly
every beet field, it has as yet done but
little harm. He is of the opinion, however,
thai unless something be done to check or
eradicate the pest it will eventually do
much damage to the beet crops in this
country, as it does in Europe. He found
two other and greater pests than the
maggot. They- are the beet aphis and the
beel worm. The aphis works in the leaves
and the crown of the beets much the same
as on fruit trees, while the worm bores
down into the beets, frequently as deep
as the tap root, eighteen or twenty inches
below the. surface of the ground. An ex
periment with Insecticide will be tried to
kill them.
WATER SUPPLY ENDANGERED j
Monterey County Likely to Experi
ence a Shortage.
MONTEREY. June 22.â A fishing party {
just returned from the Upper Carmel
River brings the alarming intelligence j
that the bed of the Carmel River from !
Syndicate Camp to the Pacific Improve
ment Company's dam is almost dry,
what water there is being in a compara
tively few holes. As it is from this por
tion of Carmel River that the water sup
ply of Monterey, Del Monte and Pacific
Grove comes, there is some apprehen
sion that the drought will be felt here
abouts, though as yet the water company
has put no restriction upon water con
sumers.
The fish of the Upper Carmel have all i
collected in the deeper pools and are in I
line condition, but sportsmen fear there I
will be very few next season, owing to !
the fall in the river.

dence will be visited to-morrow by a large number of priests and other
friends. Father McNamee's first assignment to clerical duty in Cali
fornia dates back to 1573. He was ordained in Dublin, but soon after
came to this State and was the assistant priest at Watsonville. He
subsequently was the assistant priest for short periods at San Diego,
at San Gabriel and at the Cathedral in Los Angeles. In 1877 he was
assigned to the parish at Hollister by Bishop Mora, where he complet
ed the church and cleared up the debt upon it. He was returned to
Los Angeles as rector of the Cathedral. In 18S3, at his own request, he
was assigned to the parish in Santa Cruz, and this ends the history of
his itinerary. The Holy Cross Church stands upon the site of the origi
nal adobe mission. Where the cross was raised in 1791 dedicating the
mission of Santa Cruz a memorial granite arch has been erected cost
ing $5000.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 22.â The Re
publican State Convention here to-day
was a record breaker. Its session
lasted less than two hours and most of
that time was devoted to unseating a
small minority of dissenters. After
the contests were disposed of every
thing was unanimous and by acclama
tion. Five nominations were made
within twelve minutes, including the
presentation and the seconding
speeches. The delegates, after the
convention perfected its permanent or
ganization, were all Hanna men.
There was some doubt expressed as to
two of the twenty-one members of the
I State Central Committee â Brown of
| Toledo and of Daytonâ but
j they were not long in announcing
themselves as in accord with the ma
jority, so that the party machinery is
entirely in the hands of the friends of
Senator Hanna for the next year.
While in such full sway there were
some who wanted' to remove Charles L.
Kurtz as the Ohio member of the Re
publican National Committee, but
Senator Hanna's closest friends pre
vented even consideration of such ac
tion. Governor Bushnell was not in
the convention hall to-day and none of
his appointees were present to hear
the reading of the last resolution in the
platform, which is generally accepted
as complimentary to the Governor and
the dissenting Republicans in the
Legislature.
The following nominations were
made by acclamation: Secretary of
State, Charles Kinney; Supreme Judge,
W. T. Spear; Clerk of the Supreme
Court, Josiah B. Allen; Food and Dairy
Commissioner, Joseph H. Blackburn;
Member of the Board of Public Works,
W. G. Johnson.
The platform adopted by the conven
tion reaffirms the principles approved
by the St. Louis convention in 1896,
congratulates the country upon its
prosperity under protection and reci
procity, favors restoration and growth
of the merchant marine, asks Congress
to Increase the navy, approves of Ha
waiian annexation, approves the decla
ration of war against Spain, indorses
the matchless leadership of President
McKinley in his management of the
war, sends greeting to Admiral Dewey
and cheer to Hobson and his brave
comrades.
In Antwerp alone nearly 4000 horses
were slaughtered last year for human
consumption. The number of shops
dealing exclusively in horse flesh in the
Belgian ports exceed thirty.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, June 22.â Before the
sun set this evening the rival pool
room forces and the officers of the law
clashed twice and numerous arrests
were made. As was expected, the es
tablishment of Broyer, Glynn &
Humphrey, with Schwartz & Kingsley
as siite partners, opened its doors for
business simultaneously with Harrison
& Harvey. At about 2 o'clock Marshal
Hannon and fifteen deputies, Including
Deputy Marshals Johnson and Susa
villa and Constables Cramer and Gar
rity, made a descent on the poolrooms
not protected by a license. A warning
was given by a watchful scout
and Instantly the place was cleared
of all but the principals and a
few gamblers. These were arrested and
taken before Recorder Simpton. The
principals were released on $100 bonds
and a cash bail of $50 each; the players
on bonds of $50 each and a cash bail
of $25 each.
In a few minutes the poolrooms were
again in operation. This time the Mar
shal and his deputies made a quiet
"sneak" and surprised the who4e crowd.
The principals were rearrested, to
gether with players to the number of
forty-seven. . They were released on the
same conditions as before.
Then Attorneys J. W. Cochrane and
Hepburn Wilkins began to make their
presence manifest. Ex-Marshal John
E. Creed, who has been guarding the
rooms of Schwartz et al. since they
were first closed, went before Justice
Belrude and swore to complaints charg
ing both Harrison and Harvey with
violating the ordinance prohibiting
poolroom gambling. The warrants were
issued and placed in the hands of Mar
shal Hannon, who refused to serve
them, on the ground that a Justice of
the Peace is a township officer and has
no jurisdiction in the case of a town
ordinance being violated.
There the affair rests. It is believed
| the rivals from San Mateo will "open
up shop" again to-morrow. Trustee
Sylva asserts that if they do they will
all be arrested again.
Sheriff Harrison came this afternoon
from San Rafael, but the trouble was
over when he arrived.
The town is yet excited, and several
fistic combats have resulted from the
disturbances, but no arrests on that
score have been found necessary. Each
side has its champions, but the trades
people generally are with the Trustees.
The hospitals of London are all support
ed by private charity, excepting those for
the treatment of contagious diseases,
which are supported by the city.

UP IN ARMS
San Jose School Board
Defied.
CALL FOR A MASS MEETING
WANT THE REINSTATEMENT
OF PROFESSOR SMITH.
If Their Appeal Is Denied the High
School May Be Closed Be
cause of a Lack of
Pupils.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 22.â The students of
the San Jose High School have called
a mass-meeting for to-morrow night at
Turn Verein Hall to adopt some plan
looking to the reinstatement of Pro
fessor Leigh R. Smith as vice-principal
of the high school. Great indignation
has been caused by the City Board of
Education dismissing Professor Smith,
and the meeting promises to be a warm
one. A number of prominent speakers
Will address the meeting and strong
resolutions have been drawn up to
present to those present for adoption.
About a month ago the Board of
Education at the annual election of
teachers failed to re-elect Professor
Smith to his position in the high
school. The trustees gave as their
reason that the Battlefield Veterans, a
political organization, had complained
that Smith was instilling disloyal senti
ments into the pupils. This charge
afterward proved to be unfounded. The
board's action created a great deal of
unfavorable comment, and at a meet
ing the next night the students of the
high school turned out 300 strong and
protested against Professor Smith's
removal. The various Grand Army
posts denounced the part taken by the
Battlefield Veterans and the action of
that body as a piece of political chi
canery. The School Trustees then put
on a penitent face and said they had
no idea of letting Professor Smith go,
but would retain him. This promise
was solemnly made to Professor Smith
himself.
During 1 the past week it has been
whispered around that Professor
Smith would have to go. This again
aroused the students and for trie past
few days they have been working hard
in Smith's behalf. On Monday night
they held a meeting at the residence of
one of the pupils. It was decided to
hold a mass meeing and ask the aid of
the public in keeping Smith in his
place. Resolutions were passed con
demning the action of the board, and
a committee was appointed to await
upon the High Jj^hool Alumni, which
held its annual meeting last evening.
The alumni adopted resolutions ask
ing that Professor Smith be reinstated
and these will be forwarded to the City
Board of Education.
A circular has been distributed
around town, and a large attendance
at the meeting is assured. The cir
cular says In part:
To know Professor Smith is to know
in what a false position he has been
placed by his zealous enemies, and to
know how he has been basely wronged
arouses us, so we hope you will be en
thused in his behalf. Wo are putting
forth every effort to reinstate him, but
we need help, and we turn to you, our
parents and friends, for it.
Nor would we be understood to carry the
spirit of trying to "run" the Board of
Education. Far from it. We only want
to see the right and honorable thing done
by our professor.
Professor Smith or a vacant high
school.
The student body of the High School
decided a couple of weeks ago to strike
unless Professor Smith was reinstated,
and the chances are that unless the
School Trustees heed the unanimous
wish of the students and put this fa
vorite teacher back there will not be
a corporal's guard of students in the
new High School when the next term
commences.
JERRY SIMPSON NOT
SUPPRESSED BY REED
The Kansas Statesman Succeeds in
Saying Something in Reply to
Grosv.Â£nor's Address.
WASHINGTON^ June 22.â A bill Incor
porating the National Congress of Moth
ers was passed when the House met to
day. The conference report upon the bill
to ratify the agreement between the
Dawes Commission and the Seminole In
dians was adopted.
Simpson (Pop.) of Kansas created some
thing of a diversion by rising to a ques
tion of personal privilege. He proceeded
to read from a report of Representative
Grosvenor's speech before the Ohio Re
publican Convention, in which the Ohio
member was reported as having said,
after a reference to the opposition to the
Republicans in the House having voted in
the interest of the "reconcentrados" for
the $50,000,000 appropriation, "that nine out
of every ten of those gentlemen" hua
voted "no" upon every subsequent appro
priation bill for the suffering soldiers of
the Union.
Dalzell (R.) of Pennsylvania made the
point that it was not a matter to warrant
the Kansas member In rising to a per
sonal privilege and the Speaker, upholding
the point made by the Pennsylvanian, re
marked with some humor that proceed
ings in the House were not infrequently
subjects for outside comment and that
should members insist upon rising in eacn
instance to a question of personal privi
lege the House would have its time so
occupied that "it would be unable to give
that calm and elaborate consideration to
legislation that is Its wont."
Then, as the Speaker hammered harct
to bring Simpson to his seat the Kansas
member persisted and declared: "The as
sertion as regards the vote of members
on this side is false. Every man on this
side has voted for every appropriation
bill, and no man would have cast the
restriction upon a large portion of this
House contained in the speech of the
gentleman from Ohio were he not dead
to all sense of honor and truthfulness,
having in his possession the facts with
which the gentleman must have been
familiar."
Several private bills were passed and
the House then went into committee or
the whole to consider District of Colum
bia legislation and at 3:12 p. m. ad
journed.
Westlake's Appeal Filed.
SALINAS, June 22.â The appeal against
the judgment In the case of ex-Tax Col
lector Westlake was filed this morning
in the Superior Court. Westlake, who
was found guilty of the embezzlement of
$371 in license taxes during- June. 1897, was
sentenced a few days ago to ten years
in San Quentin. An appeal against the
verdict is now pending in the Supreme
Court. The sentence on the second con
viction of a similar offense during July
of the same year will be passed on the.
28th. There are seven other indictments
awaiting trial.
Sailors and Their Grievances.
The grievances of sailors examined by the
authorities in ports of entry, where the sea
men belong, often turn out to be Imaginary or
greatly exaggerated. But there are plenty of
cruel and conscienceless skippers who abuse
their crews. Violence Is always objectionable,
and pointedly so when It Is exerted upon an
unfortunate liver, stomach or bowels by dos
ing with drastic purgatives which weaken the
Intestines. Use Hostetter's Stomach Bitters.
NEW BUILDINGS FOR FOLSOM.
SACRAMENTO, June 22.â At the last
meeting of the Board of Prison Direct
ors permission was given to Warden
Aull to erect a chapel and guardhouse,
the material principally employed in the
chapel to be Folsom granite, which will
be quarried on the spot. Warden Aull
has repeatedly had opportunities to
secure the services of noted- lecturers
and other entertainers, but the lack of
sufficient room to accommodate all the
prisoners in a body has compelled
j him to decline offers that have been
made. The chapel, as represented in
the accompanying cut, is planned to ac
commodate an audience of 1000. The
chapel will cost $2500 and the guard
house $500. No Improvements are so
much needed or desired at Folsom as
j these above described. Warden Aull is
much pleased at the permission ex
tended, and no time will be lost in
bringing the authorized structure into
existence. Many kind-hearted persons
who desire to ameliorate the lot of the
prisoners, and especially of the long
termers, .stand ready to furnish enter
tainment as soon as they are called
upon to do so.
The Prison Directors fully under
stood the situation when they gave
Warden Aull the desired authority. In
deed, the matter has been frequently
discussed informally and the necessity
for the new chapel has been often
pointed out. The necessity for the new
guardhouse has also been made plain.
It will be made as attractive architec
turally as the circumstances and the
amount of newly available space for
the purpose will permit. When the
chapel is an accomplished fact Warden
Aull expects to receive a renewal of the
offers of entertainments which have
earlier been made. In addition to the
free services of lecturers there may be
occasional concerts and stereopticon
exhibitions. Only a short time will
elapse after the foundation of the
chapel shall have been laid before the
CHAMBERLAIN MAY
LEAVE THE CABINET
Expected to Resign and Assume the
Leadership of Dissatisfied
Unionists.
LONDON, June 22.â 1t is rumored that
Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State
for the Colonies, will shortly resign from
the ministry in order to assume the lead
ership of a large number of Unionists in
the House of Commons who are discon
tented with the foreign policy of the Gov
ernment. There seems to be no doubt
that Mr. Chamberlain is dissatisfied wltn
his present position and if affairs in the
far East and in West Africa take the
turn he expects his friends believe that he
will not remain in the Cabinet to share
the shipwreck of a policy he never ap
proved. Whatever may be the outcome
the disquieting idea is undoubtedly preva
lent in Conservative circles that Mr.
Chamberlain contemplates some sensa
tional move and the extent to which this
is credited shows how little Mr. Chamber
lain can count upon Tory confidence.

The Corwin at Santiago.
SAN DIEGO, June 22.â The United
States patrol steamer Corwin, Captain
Herrig, arrived here this morning to
patrol the mouth of the harbor.ARTILLERY TO GO ON THE NEWPORT
TELEGRAPHIC confirmation of
the announcement of the forma
tion of the Eighth Army Corps
was received from the War De-
partment yesterday at military
headquarters, and in accordance with
the accompanying instructions Major
General Merritt at once assumed com
mand of the now corps, which includes
all the troops assigned to the Philip
pine Islands.
Thls army corps has been formed to
allow Genera] Merritt to have more
time to devote to his duties as Governor
General of the Philippines, as he is em
powered, whenever he thinks it neces
e.iry, to place Major General Otis in
immediate command of the expedition
ary forces. This he will probably do
either before his departure from San
Francisco or soon after his arrival at
Manila.
All the details of the plans of the va
rious expeditions have been about com
pleted, and now the attention of Gen
eral Merritt and his staff is directed
almost wholly to the embarkation of
the troops, which will begin to-morrow.
It is expected to have all the troops on
shipboard by Sunday and have every
thing in readiness to sail on Monday
next, the Intention of General Merritt
now being to follow on the Newport on
Wednesday and overtake the fleet be
fore it reaches Honolulu. It is Bald,
however, by a well-informed officer
that aftr>r all the departure of the
fle<>t will be postponed until Wednes
day bo that General Merritt can sail
with it.
The troops to occupy the extra room
afforded by the addition of the New
port to ihÂ«> fleet have not been d si^
ratod, but th^y will be taken from the
regulars. Infantry and artillery. The
Astor Light Battery may be one of the
organizations.
Satisfactory progress is being made
In the preparation of the six transports
of the fleet, and all will be ready on
time for the reception of the troops.
rly 6000 men will be transported to
Manila in this expedition.
Mr>.lor General Merrltt yesterday
mornir.tr held a long conference with
Major General Otis, with whom he dis
cussed the I'.mrse to be pursued after
the departure of the third fleet.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Jamos B.
Cutter has been ordered to report for
duty to the commanding officer at the
camp near Fort Wlnfield Scott.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Robert E.
Williams has been ordered to change
station to Fort Baker upon the arrival
at Angel Island of Assistant Surgeon
W. M. Van Patten of the First Wash
ington Volunteer Infantry.
Major Edward Field of the Second
Artillery, acting inspector general, has
been ordered to Inspect public property
at Benlcia Barracks.
There was a rumor yesterday at the
headquarters of the Eighth Army
Corps that Miss Laura Williams of
Chicago was en route to this city to
visit friends and say a few words of
good cheer to Major General Merritt
l>ef. re his departure for the Orient.
The following special to The Call from
Chicago disposes f the rumor:
CHICAGO, June 22. â Miss L.aura
Williams, General Merritt's fiancee,
Baid to-night that she had no idea of
joining General Merritt in San Fran
cisco. She will leave Chicago to-mor
row for Bear's Head, Me., where she
will spend the summer.
TO GO ON THE NEWPORT.
Two Batteries of the Third Artil-
lery and the Astor Inde
pendent Battery.
Major General Merritt yesterday
afternoon sent to Major General Otis,
at Camp Merritt, a statement showing
the capacity of the steamship Newport
and its general arrangement, and re
questing that he designate the troops
to occupy the extra rrom afforded by
the addition of this transport to the
third lleet of the Manila expeditionary
forms. Outside of the reservation for
General Merritt and his staff, there will
be accommodations for nearly 600
troops on th>- Newport.
At a late hour last evening, after a
conference with Major Hess, command-
Ing the Manila battalion of the Third
Artillery, Genera] Otis decided to as
sign two batteries of this regiment to
the Newport. This will make four bat
teries of the Third Artillery that are
g-oing on this expedition, the other two
being G and L, which have been as
signed to the Ohio. The two additional
batteries will be selected to-day by Ma
jor Hess. General Otis has also de
rided to send the Astor Independent
Battery of Artillery on the Newport.
EIGHTH ARMY CORPS.
Troops to Compose the Three
Divisions â Important
Promotions.
As an immediate result of the forma
tion of the Eighth Army Corps to be
rommanded by Major General Wesley
Merritt, IT. S. A., several important
promotions are announced. Lieutenant
C L. Potter. Corps of Engineers, TT. S.
A., has been appointed by the Presl
3ent lieutenant colonel of engineers.
Colonel Potter is chief engineer on the
staff of General Merritt, and will go to
Manila with the next expedition to sail
from this city. He is regarded in the
drmy as one of the ablest young engi
neers in the country, and was earnestly
recommended for promotion by Gen
eral Merritt and by General Wilson,
:hief of the corps of engineers. As an
engineer officer Colonel Potter was en
gaged for seven years in the construc
tion of the fortifications of San Fran-
BfSCO harbor. At army headquarters
and at the Presidio yesterday he was
;ordially congratulated on his well
larn^d promotion.
The adjutant general of the Eighth
Army Corps is Brigadier General John
B. Babcock, who has had an extensive
term of service as adjutant general of
the Department of California under the
administrations of Generals Porsyth
and Shafter. General Babcock has a
record of gallant service at the front
aurinp the war of the rebellion. He
aas brevetted for gallant and meritori
>us conduct in the Red River and Port
Hudson campaigns of the West, and
evas subsequently transferred to the
Army of the Potomac, where he par
ticipated in the engagements of the
Bhenandoah Valley and the operations
iround Petersburg. Every step of his
promotion from sergeant to brigadier
general has been gained by conscien
tious and soldierly devotion to duty at
all times and under all circumstances.
The Eighth Army Corps will be com
posed of three divisions. The first ex
pedition due at Manila to-day will
doubtless comprise the first division, to
which may be added the brigade of
the second expedition, commanded by
General Greene. General IvlacArthur's
troops of the third expedition will
probably constitute the second division,
and the brigades remaining in San
Francisco under the command of Major
General Otis will doubtless be placed
in the third division.
When all the troops reach Manila a
readjustment of brigades and divisions
may be made to equalize the commands
and give to each a proper representa
tion of artillery. A division is usually
commanded by a major general, but in
the absence of an offlfer of that rank
the senior brigadier is placed at the
head of the division.
MAIL FOR MANILA.
Letters for the Soldiers to Be
Carried by the Monad
nock.
A mall for Manila and the Philippines
closes at the Ferry Depot Postoffice at 10
a, m. to-day. The mail for Honolulu is a
general one, but that for Manila is con
lined to letters to enlisted men and of
ficers of the army and navy. What yes-
Bel will carry the mail the postal authori
ties refuse to say, but the general Impres
sion is that it will be the coast-defense
steamer Monadnock, now In the stream
waiting for her consort, the collier Nero.
The latter vessel was to have been ready
yesterday, but as all her coal was not
aboard the sailing had to be postponed.
Captain Miller, the pilot detailed to take
her out, went down in the morning, but
rinding the longshoremen PtHl at work on
her he went to sea in another vessel.
in Scott will pilot the Nero out of
the harbor to-day.
Unless something unforeseen happens,
the Monadnock and Nero should get away
this afternoon about 1:30 o'clock. That
will land her in Honolulu about the same
time as the City of Para, Morgan City,
Ohio and Indiana. WorK on these vessels
is going on with a rush, and they will be
ready for the troops on Saturday night.
If all goes well, the soldiers will go aboard
on Sunday, and on Sunday night the
steamers will drop out into the stream,
then on Monday at high water a start
will be made for Manila.
All the furniture and paraphernalia
which General Merritt will require is
being put aboard the steamer Indiana,
while provisions and camp equipments
are being rushed aboard the Ohio, Morgan
City and City of Para. All these vessels
have been coaled, and to-night or early
to-morrow will see all the carpentering
work completed. A full crew will be
shipped on each transport Saturday morn
ing so that everybody connected with the
vessels will have settled into his place
before, the soldiers get aboard.
The chances are that the steamers City
of Puebla, Newport and Valencia will
form a fleet by themselves and leaving
three days after the Ohio, Indiana, Mor
gan City and City of Para will catch up
with those vessels at Honolulu. The City
of Puebla finished discharging her Puget
Sound cargo last night and the work of
coaling her will begin to-day, simultane
ously with the work of putting in the
bunks for the soldiers. The Newport
went on the drydock yesterday and will
come off to-day ."while the work of coaling
the Valencia 'has already begun. Tin
latter's boilers have to be overhauled, but
by next Wednesday they should be reaOy
to follow the fleet scheduled to sail on
Monday. The vessels composing the lat
ter will go to Honolulu at the rate of ten
knots an hour, while the Puebla, Newport
and Valencia can easily make thirteen
knots, so that if they can get away next
Wednesday they would not be many hours
behind the Ohio, Indiana, Morgan City
and City of Para at Honolulu.
Four fine American steamers are dvÂ«
here almost in a bunch and all of | them
can and probably will be pressed into ser
vice. Or course it will entail great hard
ships on the owners, but then the troops
have to be moved. The Peru will be due
here from China to-night, the Alameda
from Australia and the Acapulco from
Central America on the 29th inst., while
the City of Rio de Janeiro is due here
from China on July 5. All these vessels
can be got ready as quickly as the sol
diers can be prepared, so that a fortnight
after the Newport, Valencia and City of

That would mean that in about two
months the United States Government haa
equipped and dispatched from San Fran
cisco alone eighteen vessels with 18,000
troops with all the necessary munitions
of war to assistance of Admiral Dewey in
Manila. .
DIVISION HEADQUARTERS.
Additional Batteries of Heavy
Artillery May Be Assigned
General Mac Arthur.
No orders were issued yesterday from
division headquarters assigning troops to
the Newport. It was Riven out, bowever,
In a semi-official way, that the 600 troops
that will go on this transport will be com
posed of regulars, and the heavy artillery
will be given the preference over the other
branches of the service, so that when the
Newport sails there will probably be sev
eral batteries of regular artillery aboard
of the vessel. From what can be learned
General Merritt is desirous that the furors
in the Philippines shall be thoroughly
supported with all the necessary artillery
and there is little doubt that the ar
tillery will be included in the next expedi
tion.
An order was issued from division hpad
quarters late yesterday afternoon detail
ing Major Piggies, First Lieutenant ("lurk
and Second Lieutenants Tenwords, Snow,
Grant, Scott, eight strgeants, twelve cor
porals and two musicians, all from tlie
Thirteenth Minnesota Regiment, to re
main here for the purpose of Instructing
and taking charge of all the recruits that
have recently arrived at Camp Merritt and
that are to arrive in the future. This or
dÂ»r will not affect the strength of the regi
ment, as a draft will be made upon the re
cruits already in camp to supply the va
cancies. Captain Lee Linn was yesterday
assigned as commissary of subsistence
and ordered to report to Major Bartlett,
division commissary.
An order was issued yesterday by Major
General Otis Instructing the commissaries
of the next troops going to Manila to
draw rations not later than the 25th inst.,
and that if the troops were not ready to
get away at that time for the commissar
ies to draw their rations by the day in
stead of for ten days at a time, as they
have been doing.
Colonel Funston of the Twentieth Kan
sas has received a very handsome sword,
presented to him by the citizens of lola,
Kan., as a token of their high regard for
the colonel.
The men and officers of the First
Tennessee Regiment had to submit to vac
cination yesterday in compliance with or
ders Issued from division headquarters.
The remains of Private James F. Laf

THE SAN FEANCIsOo VAl^Li, TMUIiSDAr, JUKE 23, 1898.
that this call Is for the purpose of the
preliminary examination and to take at â¢

HE FOUGHT WITH THE CUBANS.
Colonel Fred Funston of the Twentieth Kansas Volun
teer Infantry.
One of the lea/.t obtrusive officers stationed at Camp Merritt and at the
same time a man with a record many of his superiors might envy is Colonel
Fred Funston, late chief of artillery of the Cuban, patriot army on the staff
of General Garcia, and now in command of the Twentieth Kansas Volunteer
Infantry. Since the breaking out of the war with Spain Colonel Funston
has been attached to the staff of General Nelson A. Miles, but at his own
request he was relieved from stuff duty to accompany his regiment on the
Philippine expedition.
Colonel Funston is rather small of stature and does not look to be the
man who has braved the hardships that have fallen to his lot. Colonel Fun
ston had experiences and faced dangers far more terrifying than Spanish
bullets and Cuban fevers long before he became an officer in the insurgent
army- In 1 891 he penetrated the interior of Alaska 1000 miles inland from the
mouth of the Yukon and up the Porcupine River. To accomplish this and to
gain camping ground, during the closed season he and his Indian guides were
compelled to work waist deep in slush ice for two days, never in that time
changing their garments or partaking of anything but spirits. Colon- 1 . Fun
ston made this trip at the instance of the Agricultural Department of* the
United States Government, and hidden away in the archives of that de
partment are the reports of the colonel that would make most exciting and
interesting reading. He was also a member of the famous "Death Valley"
Expedition across the Yurna desert, wherein so many officers and men per
ished from sunstroke and lack of water.
Colonel Funston secured his commission in the Cuban army and went to
the front despite the protestations of his most intimate friends and associ
ates. Through the influence of General Sickles he received the promise to be
taken to the front upon an expedition which was soon to start. Six weeks
later he received a telegram telling him to be at a certain place on the Vir
ginia coast, and the next heard of him he was at the front with Garcia.
Speaking of the Spanish soldiers, he says they will fight as long as they
have a leader, but as soon as a junior officer is put in command they seem
to lose their nerve and apparently go to pieces. Colonel Funston participated
in twenty-four battles and skirmishes while with the Cuban army, and it
was while on a scouting expedition on the outskirts of Havana that he was
taken prisoner by the Spaniards. Soon after he was captured he was permit
ted to return to the United States on parole on the promise never to return
to Cuba.

SUPPLIES OF COAL.
Large Shipments to Manila
and Honolulu â Wyoming
Light Artillery Coming.
The quartermaster's department of the
United States army has made extensive
contracts for coal to be delivered at
Caylte and Honolulu. It is said by an
officer who is familiar with the facts that
55.000 tons of coal have been purchased
recently and contracts made to deliver the
fuel at the points named. In regard to
prices, it is said that the army obtained
figures lower than the navy secured, but
the point is considered that the coal re
quired for the transports is not of as
high a grade as that required for the
cruisers of the navy.
Since the notification of the Chinese Im
perial Government regarding the neutral
ity of China and the refusal of the Chi
nese authorities to harbor one of Admiral
Dewey's supply vessels the authorities
of the United States have decided to send
colliers and Bupply ships to the Orient.
General Ludlngton, quartermaster gen
eral, wires from Washington to the De
partment of California that the quarter
master at Denver has been directed to
provide transportation from Cheyenne to
San Francisco for Light Battery A, Wy
oming Volunteer Artillery.
According to advices received by the
Southern Pacific Company, the train
bringing 270 recruits for the Seventh Cali
fornia Regiment will arrive at Oakland at
9 o'clock this morning. Three carloads
of volunteers for the Colorado regiment
left Ogden yesterday. It is also announced
by the Southern Pacific that 100 recruits
passed through Mojave yesterday, to ar
rive in this city early this morning.
The board of army officers appointed to
inspect the nineteen horses belonging to
volunteer officers at Camp Merritt has
found only three of the animals suitable
for the cavalry service. The others were
either under weight or size or blemished
in some way. The rejected steeds will
probably be sent back to the places from
which they were shipped.
STRAYED FOR TWO DAYS.
Lieutenant T. F. Barry Now
Under Arrest at Camp
Miller.
Thomas F. Barry, formerly colonel of
the Third Infantry, N. O. C, and now
first lieutenant of Battery A, First Bat
talion, California Heavy Artillery, is un
der arrest and confined to the limits of
Camp Miller, where his battery Is sta
tioned. Major Hess has considerately re
frained from ordering him to his quar
ters.
Lieutenant Barry has been acting as
quartermaster since the artillery went
into camp on the Presidio drill plain, and
won the pood opinion of his superiors,
last Monday, however, he left camp with
out the consent of either Major Rice or
Major Hess and remained away until
vest. rday.
What happened in the interim can only
be conjectured, but the lieutenant must
have had a royal good time, terminating
in the usual period of melancholy and
penitence, for when he returned to camp
yesterday ho was armed with a document,
duly signed, pledging himself to abstain
from the use of all intoxicants during the
remainder of his service in the army. It
was through the medium of this pledge
that he announced his return to camp,
sending it by an orderly to his command
ing officer. The major looked at the docu
ment and asked if Lieutenant Barry was
in camp. The orderly replied that he was,
and the penitent was at once ordered un
der arrest. Later charges of being ab
sent from (Tuty without leave and intoxi
cation were filed, and there is every pros
pect of an exceedingly tortuous time
ahead of the offender.
None of the officers at Camp Miller will
discuss the matter further than to admit
that Lieutenant Barry is under arrest,
but there seems to be a disposition to
be as lenient with him as army regula
tions will permit. In view of this, and
the fact that he has pledged himself not
to touch stimulants again, the matter
may be dropped, or, at most Barry be
permitted to resign instead of facing the
ordeal of a court martial. His superiors
are inclined to leniency, as it Is his first
offense.
FOURTH U. S. CAVALRY.
Troopers Now in Tents on the
Lower Parade Ground at
the Presidio.
Yesterday morning Troops C, X, I and
L of the Fourth United States Cavalry
received their tents, and soon after went
Into camp on what Is known as the lower
parade pround at the Presidio. This
squadron is In command of Major Sanford
T. Kellogg. Troops E and G are camped
near the brick barracks. There Is also
at the Presidio a troop of Nevada cav
alry. These seven troops will go to Manila
with the fourth expedition, and each
troop, except that from Nevada, which
is unmounted, will take fifty horWs.
The loading of the property of Batteries
G and L, Third United States Artillery,
on board the transport Ohio was begun
yesterday afternoon, and will be complet
ed this morning. It is expected that this
battalion, in command of Captain Birk
himer of Battery L, will embark to-day.
The battalion will consist of . 330 men,
seventy being left behind owing to lack
of room. Those artillerymen are com
pletely equipped as infantry with the
Krag-Jorgenson rifle, and Have been well
drilled in infantry tactics. The batteries
will take with them four Hotchkiss re
volving cannon, two 5-inch siege guns and
two 7-in^h howitzers. It is the intention
to drill the battalion in gunnery on me
way to Manila,
It is thought at Camp Miller that two
or three other batteries from Maior Hess'
Manila battalion, as it i? called, will sail
on the Newport with this expedition. Last
evening this battalion lacked only live
recruits to reach its maximum strength
of 800. Those batteries left after the de
parture of the third expedition will sail
for Manila with the fourth fleet.
DIPHTHERIA IN CAMP.
Four More Cases Reported.
Treatment Administered
at the Hospital.
Four more well-developed cases of diph
theria were added yesterday to the sick
list at Camp Merritt. Though Major
Owen and his assistants at the field hos
pital are doing their utmost to stamp it
out the disease seems bound to get a foot
hold. The prospect of an epidemic of this
friKhtful scourge at Camp Merritt. v,
drained and damp as it is, is almost too
frightful to contemplate. There are 13.000
men in Camp Merritt. quartered on a few
acres of damp sand, cooking, eating,
sleeping and dumping scraps and waste
from their camp kettles practically in one
spot. The odors that aro every minutu
emanating from regimental kitchens is
nauseating.
The few gnrbage wagons detailed to
gather in the refuse are not equal to the
necessity and heaps of disease-breeding
refuse lie for days at a time in the streets
unless swept back by the wind in the
meantime over the camps and into the
eyes and lungs of the hopeless passer-by.
Camp Merritt is ripe for a dread epi
demic, and an epidemic will surely come
unless the stringent measures now being
enforced by Major Owen are pursued un
remittingly.
The anti-toxine treatment is being ad
ministered to the nine patients now suf
fering from the malady and they all give
every hope of recovery.
SMOTE THE SERGEANT.
A Volunteer Soldier Becomes
Insubordinate, Abusive
and Violent.
A bad case of Insubordination Is re
ported in Battery B, Heavy Artillery,
California Volunteers. The battery was
recently sent from the Presidio to take
station on Lime Point, relieving Captain
Birkhimer's battery of the Third United
States Artillery. The insubordinate soldier
is Private Frank Bryan. It appears that
he refused to obey the orders of Sergeant
Babb and gave vehemence to his diso
bedience by addressing the sergeant in
vituperative and vile language. Accord-
Ing to the charges and specifications, the
aforesaid Bryan not only used unmihtary
epithets, but he smote the sergeant on the
head with a stone. Not satisfied with hurl-
Ing epithets and stones at the sergeant,
ho dislodged his superior from the com
mand of a span of mules and a wagon and
took charge of the outfit himself.
A regular officer of high rank, who is
noted for his military conservatism, pro
nounces the offense as one of the worst
cases of insubordination that has de
veloped since the war began. Private
Bryan will be tried by court
martial, and if he is found guilty of all
the offenses laid at his door he will prob
ably pass the next year at hard work on
Alcatraz Island.
HOSPITAL CORPS.
Details Made for the Third
Expedition to the Phil
ippines.
The following medical officers have
been detailed by Major Owen of the field
hospital as the hospital corps of the next
sailing Philippine expedition:

THE REGIMENT COMPLETED
Santa Rosa to Furnish a Company for*
Colonel Henshaw's Command,
Company E, Fifth Infantry, of Santa Rosa, as it was announced ex
clusively in yesterday's Call it would be, has been selected by Governor
Budd as the twelfth company of the new regiment and Colonel Henshaw's
command is now complete. The following circular order was sent out to the
captains of the various companies yesterday:
Tou will have the men of your company who desire to enter the United States
volunteer service ready to leave your armory upon receipt of orders from these
headquarters.
You will bring serviceable uniforms for your men as far as possible. Each man
should provide himself with a pair oÂ£ serviceable shoes and a change of undercloth
ing. Also bring arms and ordnance equipment, tents, Buzzacott ovens, blankets,
haversacks, canteens, meat cans and such other camp equipage as can be utilised
in camp.
You will have Invoices made out of all State and Government property you take
into camp with you, and furnish this office with duplicate copies of same.
The maximum number of enlisted men will be 106 per company.
You will have a preliminary physical examination made immediately for your men
and bring only such as pass a physical examination. These will be given a rigid
re-examlnation by the United States surgeons when rendezvoused in camp. You can
take with you from six to ten men extra to fill vacancies that may be caused by re
jection.
Men leaving families dependent upon them for support are not desired. You will
be very careful in the selection of your men. Investigate this carefully, and see that
you bring none such with you. All minors must obtain the consent of their parents
or guardians, legally attested by a notary public. The age limit Is 45.
Preparations were at once begun for the examination and mustering In
of the companies. Blanks were sent out for the physical examination of the
men, which began last night. Assistant Surgeon F. W. Dudley being dis
patched to Woodland for that purpose while Surgeon Grey went to Colusa
and Surgeon Stone to Marysville. Local surgeons will be employed at other
points in order to hasten the preliminary work so that the commands may
rendezvous at Oakland by the end of the week.
The camp site has not yet been determined upon, but Colonel Henshaw,
Captain Murray and Captain G. B. Baldwin were across the bay again yes
terday and inspected several choice locations. A selection will probably be
made to-day and orders will go out at once for the companies to go into
cnmp there as soon as the surgeons are through with their work. This ex
amination is not final; the men will have to undergo another test by army
surgeons after they get into camp, but it is the Governor's intention to
have the preliminary examination so rigid that there will not be a lot of men
brought into camp only to be rejected and returned home.
All the companies have recently been newly uniformed and with the old
uniforms on hand, most of which are in good condition, every man will go
into camp equipped as a soldier should be. The Governor is determined that
when the regiment is turned over to General Otis, some time next week,
it will be the best equipped and the finest volunteer regiment that will see
service in the Philippines.
District Attorney William S. Barnes is disappointed because he was not
chosen to form a part of the new regiment with the independent company
he has organized, but Governor Budd has assured him that he will be given
a chance to stop Spanish bullets on the next call for troops and the intrepid
official is now anxiously awaiting President McKinley's summons for a third
army, when he and his company will march forth to battle.
Captain George B. Baldwin will fare bettor in the new regiment than he
haid hoped for. Instead of a staff appointment he will be given the cap
taincy of one of the companies. He has been positively assured of this and
as the Petaluma company is without a captain Baldwin will probably be
given that command. If so the men from Petaluma are to be warmly
con I gratulated, for Captain Baldwin, who formerly commanded Company C,
Eighth Infantry, of Marysville, is admittedly one of the best drill masters
in this or any other State, and moreover, is a thorough gentleman, whose
consideration for his men will insure them against many an unnecessary
hardship.
Lieutenant E. S. Heller. Inspector of Rifle Practice of the Fifth Infantry,
will be the Quartermaster of the new regiment, while Dr. John Yost of
San Francisco and Dr. J. B. H. Reed of Stockton are the most prominent
candidates for assistant surgeons. Dr. George F. Shiels of San Francisco
has already been appointed chief suigeon.

been through many of the plagues and
epidemics that have visited the Spanish
colonies, and has thus become thoroughly
versed in the treatment of the ailments
prevalent in tropical climates. It was

AS TO A VULGAR THIEF.
NECESSITY for again mentioning the Examiner
is merely the necessity for rebuking a thief.
The Examiner is a thief. It steals news. It
steals this so frequently that to set forth the circum
stances with some detail is a simple duty undertaken
in the interests of the public and of decent journalism.
Not only does it steal the news, but so distorts it
as to rob it of its real character, making it give a
wrong impression. It twists a truth into a deliberate
falsehood, because a falsehood ever suits the purpose
of yellow journalism. On another page the particu
lars of the Examiner's latest theft appear. We say
"latest" with some doubt, as another issue of that
disreputable sheet is probably printed this morning.
Taking a copyrighted cablegram sent to the
Herald-Call syndicate the Examiner presented it as
its own. â¢ But the information given by our corre
spondent was conditional. The sender stated in the
beginning that he himself did not credit it and merely
presented it for what it might be worth. Yet in
stealing the cablegram the Examiner eliminated the
portion expressive of doubt and treated its readers to
a statement of supposed fact instead of labeling the
vague and dubious allegations as possibly unfounded.
Thus the Examiner not only stole, but having
stolen it lied with as great deliberation as had marked
the first crime. That it should steal from the Call-
Herald syndicate is not surprising. But that it should
steal and then so alter the stolen news as to utterly
destroy the value of it is simply another illustration
of the perverted instinct which shrinks from being
honest and abhors decency. The Examiner chooses
to be a vulgar thief and a stupid liar. Impelled by
a desire to expose rascality and pretense we direct
attention to its shameless course; not with any hope
of reforming the journalistic degenerate, but that
people may know it for what it is â an unclean and
mendacious daily insult to the community.
THE RASHNESS OF CROWDS.
BY the fearful accident attending the launching
of the British battleship Albion at Blackwall
on Tuesday another evidence was given of the
fatal rashness of crowds, and of the extraordinary
risks men and women will take almost without reason
if only there are enough of them to so encourage
one another as to overcome individual common sense.
Near the scene where the big ship was to be
launched lay the hulk of a Japanese cruiser in pro
cess of construction. Around the cruiser there had
been raised a light staging for the use of the work
men. It was of temporary construction and designed
to hold only a few men and those men who are ac
customed to move and work on such scaffoldings.
To warn outsiders against venturing upon the
staging the sign "dangerous" was conspicuously dis
played. Moreover on the day of the launching police
men were stationed at the place to prevent the people
from getting on the scaffolding. Every precaution
was thus apparently taken to guard against disaster
and yet in spite of all more than 200 persons climbed
upon the frail structure. As a result when the sweep
ing of the great battleship into the sea caused a high
wave the staging was too weak to resist the double
strain and gave way. A great mass of men, women
and children were precipitated into the water and
despite all that could be done to save them upward
of fifty were drowned.
Under ordinary conditions probably not a single
man or woman in that ill-fated crowd would have
thought of venturing upon a ship carpenters' staging
conspicuously marked "dangerous." Assembled,
however, in a great crowd the impulse of the mass
was upon them. That spirit of numbers which moves
men to do in masses what they would never do alone
led them to take the risks. The warnings were dis
regarded and the police were pushed aside. It would
seem that the only way to save a crowd from the
effects of this kind of delirium of the mass would be
to chain each separate individual and prevent him
from moving at all.
All the property of Murderer Haynes goes to the
lawyers who deftly steered him through the process
of being found guilty. Doubtless the charge was
reasonable, but, as has been said of other offenders,
he might have been convicted for less money.
There is no likelihood that the Spanish will harm
Hobson. While they are prone to go to excess at
times the proud spirit of an admiral naturally revolts
at the thought of being hanged.
Spain is again threatening to take an "energetic
course,"' the threat, however, losing much of its fear
6omeness from the fact that she has nothing to take
it with. "\
THE LATEST BRYANISM.
WHILE one set of Democrats in view of the
approaching election is trying to get rid of
Bryanism by dropping the silver issue and
adopting a platform of opposition to the alleged
"imperialism" of the Republican war policy, and
another set is seeking the same end by the very dif
ferent course of advocating territorial extension on
an unlimited scale, there remains a considerable fac
tion of the party still devoted to Bryanism, which,
finding the silver issue unprofitable, is endeavoring
to make capital for the party out of the war revenue
bill.
The scheme of this faction is to represent the bill
as an unjust imposition of burdens upon the poor
and thus array one class of citizens against another
by appealing to such prejudices against the rich as
may exist among the envious and the thriftless. It
is scarcely necessary to say the y<fiow Examiner
belongs to this faction. It has already begun to
denounce the revenue bill, and if it can arouse class
antagonisms among the people and weaken the popu
lar support given to the administration in the prose
cution of the war it will be gratified.
In an editorial yesterday it said: "The burden
of the war revenue falls heaviest on people in mod
erate circumstances, on the poorer classes." In
maintenance of that theory it asserted "out of
$,^. 2^9,000 which is expected to be collected in San
Francisco under the provisions of the new law
$2,135,000 will be paid on tea, beer, tobacco and flour."
Waxing indignant it asked: "On what principle can
a tax on flour be justified when at the same time
Congress refuses to tax the receipts of corporations?"
In this jumble there are misrepresentations of all
kinds. The revenue to be raised from San Francisco
is nothing like the amount asserted by the Examiner.
Its estimate on that branch of the subject is as wild
as any campaign roorback ever uttered. That, how
ever, is a minor matter. It is not the amount to be
raised but the manner of raising that involves the
proposed antagonism of the poor to the rich which
forms the essential feature of the Examiner's cam
paign.
On that point it is to be noted first that the
yellow raving over the flour tax is one of misrepre
sentation. There is no tax on flour itself. There is
a tax of 4 cents a barrel on "mixed flour," but that
is rather a tax on the mixture than on the flour.
Four cents a barrel is not too much of an imposition
on adulterations which constitute such an imposition
on the public. The principle on which the tax is
justified is that the people have a right to be pro
tected from dishonest manufacturers who sell food
supplies under fraudulent titles.
The tea tax of 10 cents per pound is one which
has long been advocated by the tea importers them
selves as a protection against the importation of
adulterated teas. For a long time past there have
been imported into this country a class of cheap
deleterious teas, made up partly of poor tea leaves
and partly of other substances. The only cheap teas
of a pure quality that come to our market are some
exported from Japan and these form but a small part
of the great mass of the cheap teas sold here. The
tax imposed by the revenue bill will shut out the
deleterious articles by making it unprofitable to im
port them, since the tax will be as heavy upon the
cheap stuff as upon the better grades. The tax is,
therefore, in the nature of a pure food law and will
be like the flour tax, a benefit to the American home.
Taxes on beer and tobacco are justified by all
precedents of all nations. It is worth noting more
over in this connection that all these taxes upon
flour, tea, beer and tobacco are parts of the free
trade system of taxation and not of the protective
system. They are Democratic and not Republican.
They have been adopted to meet the exigencies of
the war and should be loyally supported by patriots.
The Examiner, however, desires a Bryanite cry for
the coming campaign and distorts the war revenue
bill to that end. Seeking to arouse against the Gov
ernment all the discontented classes, from extreme
socialists to extreme anarchists, it shouts for an
income tax and clamors against the President, Con
gress and the Supreme Court in a wild screed that is
almost traitorous in its villainy.
THE RECORD OF THE NAVY.
rOR two months the nation has been at war and
during the whole of that time the burden of the
contest has been upon the navy. Every part
and feature of our naval system has by this prolonged
1 experience in action been put to a severe test, and
i the result is one that is in the highest degree gratify
ing to the nation.
By the long voyage so successfully made by the
Oregon, and by the safety with which ships of all
: classes have kept at sea among the West Indies, the
seaworthiness and steaming capacity of the vessels
have been amply demonstrated. The excellence of
the constructive work of our ship builders is therefore
; established beyond questioning and it is now certain
I that in this department of naval work we are not
inferior to any power on the globe.
In seamanship and in the handling of the war
i craft of all kinds we have also shown a capacity for
: meeting all the emergencies of war, wind or wave
: with an easy mastery over every difficulty. It is a
i singular fact that since our fleets took to the seas in
1 this war the only accidents or disasters that have
! occurred among them have taken place in the
squadron charged with the peaceful duty of guarding
I the coast from New York to New England. Not an
i accident has befallen any ship at Manila or off the
v.oast of Cuba or Porto Rico.
Even among the home squadron cruising along
1 the shores from Maine to New Jersey the accidents
i have been few and slight. The Columbia was dam
j aged by running into a merchantman in New York
Bay, the engine of the Katahdin broke down once or
twice while cruising around Massachusetts Bay, and
the San Francisco, trying evidently to eclipse the
feat of the Oregon in sailing around Cape Horn, ran
aground on Cape Cod in her eagerntss to get to her
! destination by a quick route. These are the only
I mishaps that have occurred so far. It is evident,
i therefore, that the engineers who handle the big
i fighting machines are as capable as the men who
; built them.
Of the fighting force of the navy ft is not neces
i sary to speak. Every day brings additional news of
j their deeds of discipline, of tactical ability and of
valor. From the commanders who direct the great
squadrons to the gunners who send the destructive
shots direct upon the vital portions of the enemy's
batteries all have proven their fitness to fulfill the
duties imposed upon them.
The naval work of the war is for a time at least
virtually completed. The fleets of Spain have been
driven from the sea. The army is now moving to
the front. The next phase of the war is for landsmen
to perform. It is right, therefore, at this juncture to
give praise to the men of the navy; to all of themâ
ship constructors, engineers and enlisted seamen, as
well as to the heroes whose names are blazoned in
the dispatches of battle and victory.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 23, 1898.
BOSSES McNAB, Gould and Alford arc not the
only persons whose conceit has in the past led
them to imagine that they were the moving
forces of the world. As has already been recorded
in The Call the three tailors of Tooley street resolved
that they were the people of England, but even they
finally discovered their mistake.
In the case in hand "Whispering" Gavin McNab
may be described as the fly, Gould and Alford as the
wheel and the local Democracy as the chariot. The
fable proceeds no further, however. These bosses
are making the Democratic party "go" in unmis
takable fashion. Whether the "go" will result in the
entire disappearance of the party at the next election
remains to be seen. One thing may, however, be
counted upon with reasonable certainty. If these
bosses can run the Democracy on the plan they are
developing a seventh wonder will be added to the
world, for never in history has a political party
capable of making itself heard at the ballot boxes
calmly submitted to appointed delegations and con
ventions and dictated tickets. Tweed in all his glory
never attempted the feat that has been planned by
these three usurping tailors.
It is quite true that nominating conventions have
been appointed in this city, but with a single excep
tion the work of all has been spumed at the polls.
In the case of the exception the ticket would have
been spurned, but the opposition was split into frag
ments and success was easy. Never in the history of
San Francisco have the Democrats submitted to an
appointed convention and the assumption that they
will at the present time is a species of midsummer
madness peculiar to the character of the Tooley street
tailors. If McNab, Gould and Alford, the usurping
bosses of the Democratic State Committee, did not
in their conceit imagine themselves the moving force
of the universe they would be appalled at their own
audacity. Their nerve is Napoleonic. Under ordi
nary conditions we could not fail to admire it.
We do not know what advice to give the rank
and file of the Democracy at this juncture. Unless
the grip of these brigands can be broken disaster is
certain to follow. An open primary is the only thing
that will save the party. How can an open primary
be secured? Boss McNab says there shall be no open
primary. He will appoint the delegates and name
the Democratic ticket himself. The party is in re
volt, but this will avail nothing until the election,
when the work of the three tailors can be spurned
at the polls. The burning question is. how can the
Democratic voters wrest the control of their organi
zation from McNab and his fellow conspirators? We
confess our inability to answer. In other words, we
give it up.
THE PROMOTION OF THE COOK-
A SHORT time ago we called attention to a de
bate in Congress in which the War Department
and the military authorities generally were
severely criticized for neglecting to provide cooks
for the recruits of the volunteer army assembled at
Camp Alger. By Congressmen who had served in
the civil war the criticism was received with a good
deal of derision. "What," said they, "are we to make
dudes and epicures of the boys? Let them skirmish
for their rations and cook them themselves, like the
heroes of '61."
The speeches of the critics, however, have sur
vived the howls of derision. More than that. They
have found an echoing response in many sections
of the country. So strong has become the clamor
not only for cooks but for good cooks to prepare
the rations of the troops that a movement has been
started to effect something like a revolution in the
culinary department of our armies, and there is a
prospect it may accomplish great things.
Nothing in the way of war can be considered in
these days without an appeal to the maxims and
practices of Napoleon on one side or the other, and
sometimes on both sides. Accordingly in this cru
sade one advocate of high grade cooking asserts
that the great man drafted into his army the best cooks
in France and provided every company \.ith an ac
complished chef. The same great dictator of military
matters is quoted as having said "an army travels on
its stomach." Hence it is concluded that we must
have at the front men skilled with the stewing pan,
the soup pot and the gridiron, in order that we may
do things in the grand Napoleonic way and send our
troops to an Austerlitz or a Waterloo with a stomach
fitted for the fight by a good dinner.
To bring about the desired result it is proposed
that cooks shall hereafter be enlisted expressly for
professional service, as musicians are. The applicant
for position as cook is to undergo an examination
and prove his skill, just as an applicant for a posi
tion in a regimental band. Moreover the proposi
tion carries with it the further proviso that every
cook in the army is to be a non-commissioned officer
with the grade and pay of a corporal. He is to have
authority to send a private for a bucket of water or
an armful of firewood whenever such things are
needed. He is in fact to be a chef In rank as well
as in title, and whoever in his presence quotes the
proverb "God made meat and the devil made cooks"
is to be subject to punishment for disrespect to an
officer.
Unquestionably the reform movement is one of
considerable merit. The manner in which a man's
food has been cooked has much to do with his
effectiveness on a long march or in a sharply con
tested battle. The value of the cook has long been
recognized in peace and should be now acknowledged
in war. One of the most popular of poets has told
us that "civilized man cannot live without cooks,"
and how then can the civilized soldier be expected to
die without them?
There is no use for the men of the Seventh Cali
fornia to fret. They make up a regiment of which
California is proud, and they are certain to get to
Manila. In the meantime San Francisco is not a
bad place to be, and far more comfortable just now
than the islands.
Russia kindly sends word that we may have the
Philippines. Thanks, ever so much. It is only a just
return to inform Russia that she may keep the piece
of China she recently took and that so far as we are
concerned her title to Siberia is unquestioned.
Great enthusiasm, so announcement is made by
way of Madrid, is felt among the Spanish soldiers at
Santiago. But there are different kinds of enthusiasm
and the style prevailing there may be directed to
getting out.
Cervera is said to want to get into the open sea.
but he would be wise to stay where he is. At least
he could reach land now without diving for it.
The charge that the Spanish are cowards can hardly
be sustained. Indeed they do not seem to be half as
badly scared now as they have a right to be.
Announcement is now made that Russia will inter
vene. Fittingly enough, the news is printed under
the line, "By way of Madrid."
c KNOTTY .QUESTION.
BRANDING A VULGAR THIEF.
The Thief Is the Examiner and Its Booty The
Call's Copyrighted News.
When a paper has struck such a down grade that it gravitates toward the
garbage crematory and circulates through the chimney thereof, no reason ap
pears for being surprised at any piece of iniquity in which it may indulge.
Nothing is expected of it but crime. Yet there is a law against theft and a
prejudice against lying, wherefore protest arises at the persistent stealing
and falsehood of the Examiner.
The Examiner is a paper published for the purpose of deluding people. It
is saturated with fraud. Nothing appearing in it can be believed without
strong corroborative evidence. It is utterly devoid of honest principle, a
daily rogue, a chronic pest, spreading calumny, dealing in subterfuge, an ex
pert in pilfering; these few brief remarks being preliminary.
Yesterday there seemed to be occasion for rebuking the shameless sheet,
and to-day there is reason for repeating the discipline, not in order to reform
the Examiner, which, being rotten from the core out, is beyond reform, but
as an expression of disapproval, and possibly a warning. The Vermiform
Appendix, inflamed by the lodgment of a lot of Hearstlings, has been up to
its old tricks. It is hardly necessary to explain that the "Vermi: >rm Ap
pendix" is the Examiner, and that the term is interchangeable with the less
elegant "blind gut" of anatomy.
From the beg.nning of the war with Spain the Sightless Intestine has
failed to get the news by proper methods. This lack it has made good in
twp ways. It has either filled up with palpably bogus fakes, non-existent
and impossible interviews, wild speculation, or has stolen from the Herald-
Call syndicate information which had been copyrighted, and to which the
predatory editorial hand had no more right than to the money in another's
pocket. Yesterday it presented two such messages, boldly and bodily steal
ing them in order to do so. The first of these was from Rithard Harding
Davis, and related to the landing of American troops in Cuba. It is true that
in this case credit was given, but no thief is restored to virtue by labeling his
booty, "I stole this."
The other offense was more flagrant. The laYcenist endeavored to cover
his tracks, but with the stupidity of the blundering criminal, left a plain clew.
Then he marked the matter as "copyrighted" by the concern stealing it, and
distorting it so that its intent was perverted, published it not as a rumor,
which it was, but as news. This act shows the character of yellow journal
ism. The difference between yellow journalism and legitimate journalism
may be more clearly understood by comparing the cablegram a: it was sent
to The Call and the same in the shape it assumed when paragraphs had been
transposed or eliminated. This comparison to be complete must include the
two headings. Here is the matter in its two forms:
AIRY PROJECT
ACCREDITED TO
THREE POWERS
Special Cable to The Call an.l New York Her
ald, f'npy righted, 1898, by James Gordon
Bennett.
MAjjRID, June 21.â [2] Very many
rumors are current in diplomatic cir
cles. The one most generally accepted
is also most apparently extravagant,
yet it has such credence here that I
forward it to you. I ma, say it was a
member of the German Embassy in
Madrid who was my informant and
who gave me the news as being ab
solutely certain. I send it with most
express reserve, as it appears to me
to belong entirely to the region of
fancy.
[3] According to my informant nego
tiations have been commenced between
Spain, Germany and France. By an
agreement with France and Spain Ger
many would acquire sole proprietor
ship of the Philippine Islands, in ex
change for which she would return Al
sace and Lorraine to France. Germany
and France would intervene to restore
peace between Spain and the United
States and France would agree to pay
the amount of the American war in
demnity in addition to the actual ex
penses of the war itself.
[4] This combination is too brilliant
to be strictly exact, although I am in
formed it is being seriously examined
by the three interested powers. This
much is certain: [1] Senor Sagasta
had an interview with a special envoy
from the German Emperor, who was
charged with the duty of making the
following proposition to the Spanish
Government in behalf of his Imperial
Majesty:
Germany would establish a protecto
rate over the Philippines for twenty
years, thus taking the place of Spain
in the archipelago. She would re-estab
lish order after having sent troops in
sufficient numbers to bring the state of
war in the islands to an end. As a re
turn for this temporary protectorate
Germany would agree to pay into the
Spanish treasury the sum of 500.000,000
marks in gold to continue the war in
Cuba.
[2] Senor Sagasta has not yet given
his reply to the German Emperor's en
voy, but I have received information
from an authentic quarter that his re
ply will be in the negative.
A glance at this exhibit will show the method of villainy practiced. The
thief took the cablegram, shifted the paragraphs, eliminated the portion cast
ing doubt on the information, and printed as a fact that which the corre
spondent had taken pains to give as a rumor, and a rumor so unreasonable
that he himself did not credit it. The beginning of the larcenist's swindling
cablegram was taken from the third paragraph of the genuine one, and
similar changes were made throughout as the numbers inserted in The Call's
reproduced message demonstrate to the eye instantly. That in black letter
was omitted. And having stolen, mutilated, and turned awry the very pur
pose of the news, the thief had the assurance to announce it as "copy
righted!"
Still will the Examiner continue to boast of its war news, to menda
ciously assert that it discarded the Herald service, from participation in which
it was incontinently kicked; still will it continue to steal and mangle this
news to fit its own vile purposes of deception; while from time to time, un
less the law intervene to check the directing scoundrels of the Examiner
The Call may make candid remarks.

Beneath his country's starry flag,

Prepared to fight till life shall flag
And darkness gather o'er.

Ready to answer "Here!"

He stands, the volunteer!

That calls nim to the fray,
'Tlb not the love of war's alarms
That bids him hftste away;
For him there's pain and grief and woe,
A wife â a mother's tear.
But loud his duty calls, and lo!
He comes, the volunteer.
O, mighty nation, proud and great.

The San Franciscos Will Never Play
Good Ball While Indifferent

Â«V JOE CORBETT.
The San Francisco team. representing
as it does the greatest baseball dty this
side of the Rookies, should be a " good
team. If not the l>ost in the league.
The above statement expresses the sen
timent of all patrons of the game, and as
they are directly responsible for the
.financial success of the club, their claims
should not be disregarded. The miser
able showing made by the Friseos hi the
last few weeks has been the cause of
great dissatisfaction among those direct
ly and Indirectly concerned. To such an
extent have these few permitted their
grievances to carry them that they in
sist on remaining away from all game?
in which this team participates, at. least
until they can be assured of seeing some
good baseball. They can hardly be cen
sured for such a move when one consid
ers that they in the first place pay their
good money to see baseball and, second
ly, go to Recreation Park with the in
tention of rooting for their home team,
hoping thereby to draw some little pleas
ure, which comes only when their favor
ites are victorious.
So often have the San Franciscos
played inferior ball and so often have
they been defeated on their own grounds
that their admirers, who are very numer
ous, began to discover where the real
fault lay, and concluded that it was lack
of experience on the part of those who
at present manage the club. This declar
ation, while it does not bring to view the
other causes of the team's failure, which
are equally as important, is convincing
in the extreme, even to the humblest of
observers.
I. like many others, have eagerly
waited lor this club to strike its gait, so
to say, placing unlimited stress upon the
idea that, so soon as a few of the play
ers discovered that their efforts in the
direction of fancy playing were despic
able, even in the eyes of those unfamiliar
with the primitive rules of the game, a
change for the better would necessarily
follow. In this I was disappointed. True,
the boys have refrained from grand
stand playing with results, however, that
have in no manner changed their stand
ing.
It was then that my eyes were turned
in the direction of the management, and
to their petty fancies, coupled with
ihtir indifferent spirit, to say nothing
of their lack of experience in the man
agerial role, is due the deplorable condi
tion of this San Francisco team. There
Is not the slightest doubt of it in the
world, and upon them, rather than upon
the players, should be directed the fire
of the league board. They should be
if such a thing is possible, to
sentiment into oblivion. Here Mr.
Hunker Insists on keeping Stroeker, a
man who has no m->re distinction as a
r Than himself, in right garden. It
is not b.-.-ause he is ignorant of the fact
that Stroeker cannot play that position,
but because he likes the fellow. So it is
with a couple of more men in the team.
Is San Francisco, therefore, to be de
prived of a team capable of representing
It simply because a half manager hap
pens to fancy a certain individual who
should be driving a truck instead of mak
ing a monkey of himself as this chap
Stroeker has on several occasions? I sin
cerely trust the league will not tolerate
such action, as already the supporters of
this aggregation, those who pay their
money to see them perform, are disgust
ed with the perpetual run of defeats
which graces the standing of this their
favorite team. If managers cannot har
monize, especially when it is to their own
interests, it is time for one of them to va
cate.
"Too many cooks spoil the broth," is an
old saying, ami all through the league
evidence or its truth may be gathered.
The San Francisco Club has been on the
verge of destruction t-ver since the con
solidation. In combining the two teams
of the other leagues Messrs. Coffroth ana
Bunker foolishly allowed avlor to be thu
better part of discretion. When it became
obvious that in so doing they had acted
unwisely one would imagine that an im
mediate change of tactics would follow,
but not so. Bunker was and is still ob
stinate. He does not care a rap whether
the team is successful or not so long as
the players he put in the club remain.
He should imitate the gallant young man
â no matter how difficult such a step
would beâ and gracefully relinquish his
rights as the affluent gentleman of base
ball. He says that he does not wish to
make any money out of the national gams
and there is certainly no glory in it for
him. I cannot see why he should con
tinue to hamper Mr. Coffroth, who would,
if giv->n full control, undoubtedly make
the team what it should be. It is useless
for him to devote his time, which at in
tervals is valuable, to the interests of the
team when he is perfectly well aware thai
any move which does not meet with Mr.
Bunker's approval, no matter how correct
* it might be, must be dissipated.
Such is the situation at present. To give
an illustration of how much these gentle
men care for the success of this team
take note of what occurred last Sunday

I the matter with Coffroth or Bunker? Why
j don t they attend to the affairs of the
' club?" "Oh!" replied Jack, "Jim (meaning
! Coffroth) went to a picnic and Bunker
j ooesn t care whether the team goes up or
] not so long as Stroeker plays right field."
This is Just an illustration of how this
i team is managed. And remember, we are
endeavoring to resurrect baseball. We
I are trying to place it on the same footing
over which it held such glorious sway
somo few years ago. The progress we
are making is astonishingâ l don't think.
i Baseball never will be revived until clubs
I are properly equipped in the matter of
| management and until they play baseball.
I There are a few clubs in the league work-
I ing hard and earnestly to make this new
venture a success, but if the team rep
resenting the greatest ball city In the
\\ eft does not co-operate their efforts
i must be in vain.
It reajly is a shame that such a state of
affairs is permitted to exist without even
\ a protest from the league board. The
1 crowds at Recreation Park have increased
j tenfold since the opening of the consoli
j dated clubs. Many of the old standbysâ
j those who have not witnessed a game in
i yearsâ were conspicuous at last Sunday's
> ffame, and will continue to be so if given
! average basel.all and a good team to root
for. This can be done by Messrs. Bunker
; and (."off roth casting aside petty fancies,
i which are a detriment to the club's suc
i cess. They can, by a little discretion,
j make their team one of the best in the
league. The material is there: all it needs
Is proper assortment and strict attention.
Those players who, after a fair and im
partial trial, have demonstrated their in -
1 ability to play fast eriough should be done
away with and now ones substituted. The
team should be made to practice, and in
.j this way have an opportunity of doing
I themselves justice when in the game. The
managers should also open their pockets
and spend a few dollars. Without a doubt
their love for the mighty dollar is hor
rifying.

good player, was released? Because Cof

The American schooner Saga arrived
from Barbadoes yesterday en route for
Victoria, B. C. She has thirty-seven
men, women and children aboard, and
put In .here for provisions. The entire
party is headed for the gold fields; but
the chances are that the women and
children will be left behind In British
Columbia. The voyage was an unevent

neiro for water and provisions.
The steamer Columbia while docking at
Spear street yesterday stuck In the mud,
and it was some time before she could
be got alongside the wharf. As soon as
she goes out a dredger will be put to i

The 105 gold hunters who have taken j
passage on the steamer Dirigo for Daw- I

the river steamer City of Dawson not
being in working order, the sailing w;t.
postponed until to-day. Thf City of

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 23, IS9B.
CRAVEN
RECORDS IN
LITIGATION
Are Now in the Hands
of the Court.
TURNED OVER YESTERDAY
THEY ARE WANTED BY THE
SCHOOL DEPARTMENT.
In All Probability Strong Opposition
Will Be Made to Prevent a
Transfer of the
Books.
The records of the proceedings of the
Mission Grammar School kept by Mrs.
Nettie R. Craven are now in the custody
of the court. There promises to be an
interesting contest to determine the title
to the books, as Mrs. Craven does not
wish to give them up, and the School
Department is equally anxious to get
possession of them. Some time ago Mrs.
Craven delivered the property in litiga
tion to J. M. Wilkins, proprietor of the
Cliff House, for safe keeping. A demand
to turn the books over to the School De
partment was made on Mr. Wilkins, but
as Mrs. Craven had declared that the
books were her private property, he re
fused to deliver them except by order of
court. Action for their recovery was in
â  "iist-quence instigated by Superintend
ent of Schools Webster. The case was
called by Judge Troutt yesterday. Wilk
ins was on hand with the books, and ex
plained that he did not wish to retain the
books and had no defense to the action
brought by the Superintendent of
Schools, but in turning them over he
wished to be relieved of responsibility.
I He further stated that he had promised
Judge Denson, Mrs. Craven's counsel,
that he would inform him when the case
was called for trial, that the interests
of Mrs. Craven might not suffer, but as
Judge Denson was out of the city he
had been unable to communicate with
â¢him. At this, point Attorney A. Ruef,
who was present in court as a party in
another notion, addressed the court and
asked that a continuance in the matter
be granted until such time as Mr. Den
son had been communicated with. Mr.
Ruef explained that he was of counsel
for Mrs. Craven, which accounted for his
interest in the case. Strenuous objection
to the stand taken by Ruef was made by
the Distrirt Attorney, who represented
Webster. The District Attorney was of
the opinion that as Mrs. Craven did not
appear of record in the case her inter
ests could not be considered by the court,
and that the hearing must proceed. The
court agreed to the argument in part.
but before proceeding appointed Attorney
Kuef amicus curiae to advise the court
matters in which the interests of
Mrs. Craven were involved. This sud
appointment of opposing counsel
took the District Attorney by surprise,
and for the time being defeated the pur
of the Superintendent of Schools.
Charles B. Stone, Assistant Superinten
dent of Schools, was called and testified
to the fact that all teachers employed
in this city and county were required to
keep a record such as was contained in
the books of each day's proceedings. He
said that the books in litigation were
similar to those given out by the School
Department to the teachers, but as he
could not swear that the books in ques
tion had been given Mrs. Craven and
were not purchased by her, a doubt as
to their title arose. Judge Troutt was in
clined to turn the books over to the
School Department, but Ruef objected on
the ground that the ownership of the
property had not been satisfactorily es
tablished, and gained his point. Counsel
fur Webster promised to produce wlt
nesses to positively establish the title to
the books, and the case went over until
this afternoon. Ruef requested the court
to order the clerk to seal the books that
no curious or interested person might
tamper with them.
The books in question were eagerly
sought for by the police during- the trial
of the suit brought by the executors of
the will of James G. Fair against Mrs.
Craven to quiet title to valuable prop
erty claimed by Mrs. Craven under gift
deeds she alleged were given her by the
deceased millionaire. The police con
tended that the books showed that Mrs.
Craven was in school attending to her
duties on days she claimed to have been
absent, and so testified under oath dur
ing the trial of the action brought
against her. The fact that Ruef re
quested the sealing of the books caused
considerable comment among the court
frequenters, and to-day they expect a for
midable opposition will be put forth to
prevent a transfer of the much-desired
records.
BOUGHT A FERRY-BOAT.
To Be Used as an Extra Transfer Be-
tween Vallejo and Mare Island
Navy Yard.
The Southern Pacific Company has sold
Its steam ferry-boat No. 2 at Portland to
parties who will use it as a traoisfer be
tween Vailejo and Mare Island. The pur
chasers are ex-Senator James McCudden
of Vallejo; Captain R. J. R. Aden, presi-
dent of the Piper-Aden-Goodall Trans
portation Company, and G. W. Wilson,
president of the Vallejo Commercial
Bank. The ferry-boat is to be delivered
at Vallejo, and will be towed from the
mouth of the Columbia by a powerful
San Francisco tug. She is a fine Bteel
boat. She was built in East Portland in
1879, at a cost of more than $100,000, for
the Oregon and California Railroad Com
pany. Her length is 123 feet, beam 31%
feet, draught 9 feot, gross tonnage 414
and net tonnage 255. This boat is to be
used as an extra ferry to meet the de
mands of the travel between Vallejo and
Mare Island navy-yard. It is estimated
that there are now about 2000 Govern
ment employes who cross the water, a
distance of 1700 feet, every day. The fare
is 50 cents a week, and the ticket-hold
ers may make as many trips a day as
they wish.
THE CHARGES APPROVED.
State Board of Railway Commission-
ers Allow Valley Road Rates.
The State Board of Railway Commis T
pinners met yesterday afternoon to con
sider the rates fixed by the Valley Rail
road for the transportation of grain from
the various points along the road and
passenger rates to and from Fresno.
Much discussion and searching of the
archives was necessary before matters
were satisfactorily settled. It was dis
covered that the rates fixed oy the Val
ley road were less than those fixed by
the Commissioners a few months ago.
The unanimous approval of the Commis
sioners present followed, and the Valley
road rates were allowed to stand as de
termined.
Fourth of July Celebration.
The executive committee of the Fourth
of July committee met last night to dis
cuss plans and arrangements for the
coming celebration.
The grand marshal reported that there
would be fully 12,000 of the regular and
volunteer soldiers in the parade, in addi
tion to school children and representa
tives from civic societies.
The fireworks committees announced
that a contract had been entered Into for
a grand pyrotechnic display to be given
at a cost not to exceed $800.
The regatta committee reported that
arrangements had been made for an
aquatic entertainment on July 3. Medals
and cash prizes, amounting to $340, will
be distributed among the successful com
petitors In the several events.
Bogus Lottery Men at Work.
The police have been notified of the
operations ot a man who has been sell-
Ing bogus lottery tickets and obtaining
money from purchasers of the tickets
on the pretext that they had drawn a
prize. He takes them to an office down
town, where a confederate, on payment
of $10, gives them an order for the prize,
which is repudiated on presentation at
the office of the genuine lottery com
pany.
DOGS OF GREAT SPEED.
High-Class Flyers to Course for Big
Money at Union Park.
Coursing is one of the great outdoor
sports that is moving rapidly to the front
and, according to the increased purses
and the large number of hounds that are
being entered weekly for the Union Cours
ing Park meetings, it is probable that in
the near future three days Instead of
two will be absolutely necessary in which
to run off the stakes.
Eighty-seven dogs were entered last
evening for Saturday's and Sunday's
coursing at Union Park and among the
number there are the pick of the State:

ASSASSINS PROVED
TO BE SMALL BOYS
RICHARD GARNETT ATTACKED
WITH A TORPEDO.
Piedmont's Mystery on Investigation
Ends in Verdict Satisfactory
to All.
OAKLAND, June 22. â The shooting
"mystery" of last Saturday evening, when
Richard Garnett thought he was made the
target of a burglar's bullet, was entirely
cleared up to-night at an investigation
held by the Chief of Police in his office.
There was not a bullet fired, and the in
nocent cause of the great scare was two
young boys, a dog, a tin can and two
torpedoes.
Mr. Garnett is a wealthy resident of
Piedmont, and resides at Perry and .Ver
r.on streets. As he was retiring on Satur
day night he heard a shot In his back
yard, and his watchdog was barking
fiercely. He reported to the police that
he went to the back door and there was
another shot fired. Garnett readied for
his pistol, and as he did so he saw a tall
man clear the rear fence at a bound, and
the assassin or burglar was instantly lost
in the darkness. Such was the report to
the police.
Detective Holland was put to work on
the case and reported that there was
nothing in It. Deputy Constable Hitch
cock, who Is on duty In that neighbor
hood, ran down the mystery.
Hitchcock was particularly interested in
the case, as somehow or other the rumor
was passed around that he had been do
ing some promiscuous shooting in the
neighborhood he found the culprits.
To-night Chief Fletcher had all the
witnesses in his office. Two lads, named
Leland Garfield and Ernest Coffin, testi
fied that they were out with some tor
pedoes on Saturday night, and that as
Garnett's dog was barking loudly they
threw a tin can at him. A little later thpy
threw a couple of torpedoes at the ani
mal and werfl home. The Chief has no
doubt the boys told the truth and is con
vinced that no bullets were fired and that
Deputy Sheriff Hitchcock was not with
in a mile of the place when the boys ex
ploded the torpedoes. The affair cre
ated a sensation around Piedmont, as it
Is a locality of large residences and little
police protection.

INSURANCE
TAX WILL
BE PAID
A. J. Clunie Obtains
Big Concessions.
A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
THE 1 PER CENT TAX ON PRE
MIUMS SECURED.
The Foreign Companies Will
Pay It During Clunie's
Term of Of
fice.
At last the long fight for the 1 per cent
tax on gross premiums collected for in
surance policies has ended and Andrew J.
Clunie has come out victorious. Word
was received in this city last night that
the foreign insurance companies with
chief agencies in New York would willing
ly pay the tax while Clunie reigns if they
were freed from the annoyances put upon
them by his bellicose attitude.
Some ten years ago this State passed
a law charging foreign insurance com
panies doing business here a tax of
1 per cent on the gross premiums col
lected. This law the insurance companies
claimed was illegal to the roois and they
fought it in the courts. The Supreme
Court passed judgment upon' the question
and pronounced this statutory law invaliu
with certain restrictions. Then came the
futile efforts of succeeding commissioners
to collect the tax.
When Clunie entered upon the duties of
his office he was determined to annoy the
foreign companies until they saw fit to
pay the tax. The tax was to be distrib
uted among the Fire Departments of the
various communities in which the pre
miums were collected. The average tax
in this State would amount annually to
about $30,000, the greater portion of which
would go to the San Francisco Fire De
partment were the tax paid.
Clunie began his offensive operations by
blocking the way of the foreign insurance
companies at every step. The result was
that about a dozen injunction suits were
filed in the United States District Court,
and Clunie was enjoined for the time
being. Then he tasted a portion of oppo
sition.
To right matters and untie the Gordian
knot the Commissioner went East and
opened negotiations with the chief agents
in this country. He was in dire distress
on account of the injunction suits, and
they were in utter despair on account
of the stumbling stones that Clunle
dropped in the road that they had to
travel. Compromise was the result.
The foreign Insurance companies are
now willing to pay the 1 per cent tax
for the full term of Clunie's office. The
amount of the tax for last year reaches
$30,000, and as the Commissioner has left
four years of service in the insurance
army the net gain to the State will be at
least $150,000.
The back taxes, the unpaid accretions
for ten years, has been sacrificed for the
moment. The New York insurance men
are of the opinion that Clunie should
rest peacefully if they promise him a
payment of the tax while he is in office.
One other matter of importance was
brought to a focus and a beneficial settle
ment obtained for the city. The foreign
insurance companies have agreed to rec
ognize this city as one with a full paid
up Fire Department. This means a re
duction of 25 per cent on the insurance
rates charged. With the competition
that this will stir up among local insur
ers cuts in rates should soon be in order.
The underwriters have met and dis
cussed the proposition, but have yet come
to no conclusion. Whether or 'no they
will accept what the foreien companies
offer is a matter which is now under de
bate.
STOLE FROM HIS EMPLOYERS.
A Porter Accused of Getting Away
With a Large Quantity of Paint.
"W. W. "Whyters, who was employed by
Whlttier, Fuller & Co. for some time in
the capacity of porter, was arrested yes
terday on a warant by Detective Eagan
and lodged in the City Prison pending ex
amination. It is claimed that the pris
oner, in collusion with other employes in
the establishment, has during the" past
few months got away with paints and oils
to the value of $1500.
The continued losses occasioned by the
repeated thefts aroused the suspicion of
the firm, and the matter was placed in the
hands of the police. Their efforts to lo
cate the leak were fruitless, but suspicion
was laid on "Whyters and a few others.
The result was that a warrant was sworn
to which led to his arrest. It is expected
that further warants will be sworn to to
day for outsiders who received the stolen
stuff.
A Female Socialist Agitator.
Liberty branch, Socialist Labor party,
introduced a novelty at its regular propa
ganda meeting last night in the form of
a woman oratorâ Mrs. R. S. Lillleâ who
spoke on "Ideals of Socialism." She in
troduced her speech with the usual ex
pression that the present social system
is all wrong and that the laboring classes
are downtrodden and that the day is not
far distant when there will be a tremen
dous social revolution, placing all on a
common level. Her ideal of socialism
she expressed as simple justice, and ar
gued that if justice were truly meted out
all labor would be alike honorable; the
many would not be forced to toil to sup
port the few, and want and its conse
quent evils would be banished forever.
Violating the Fire Ordinance.
T. B. Maxwell, a capitalist, was con
victed by Judge Low yesterday of violat
ing the fire ordinance, but at the request
of his attorney sentence was postponed
till to-day, as he desired to cite authori
ties to prove that the defendant was
within his rights. The defendant erected
a high fence on his property at the cor
ner of Market street and City Hall ave

Lieutenant Burke, for $1920, the amount

served on Haynes in the County Jail, but
he allowed the case to go by default,

tion but to award judgment as prayed for.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 22.â The action of the I
stock market to-day Indicated the withdrawal [
of the outside public from speculation, pend- j
ing definite news regarding the operations of !
the American forces at Santiago and Manila I
and until the effects of the new revenue law |
and the Government loan are known. The pro- !
fessional operators were unable to advance or
depress prices in any marked degree. London i
operated on both sides of the market In Bal- j
timore and Ohio and was a purchaser of St. j
Paul. The weakness in Sugar, ascribed to J
prospective annexation of Hawaii, was a fea- 1
ture. The bears had everything their own way
in this specialty and were successful In forcing
out round amounts of stock, which carried
the price down 2% to 12*%. The succeed
ing operations were accompanied with consid
erable irregularity, rallies of a point or there
abouts occurring frequently, but the evident j
lack of inside support encouraged fresh demon- 1
strations, by the traders at every rise, the Btock ;
closing within V* of the lowest. The feverish
ness of this security permeated the general
market for a time, but the marked reluctance
of the standard shares to succumb to bear
pressure, coupled with some favorable traffic
statements, stimulated covering in the Granger
group, which carried these properties above i
the level of yesterday's close. The action of ;
the Lake Shore directors in making the semi- j
annual dividend to 3% per cent was also a 1
contributory factor in the late strength In the !
railways. B. and O. suffered, a loss of 3
points on liquidation Influenced by the drastic 1
nature of the reorganization plan. The bal- j
ance of the list was without feature and, com- i
paratively, prices show exceedingly light !
changes In either direction, | except in isolated i
cases.
Transactions in bonds were on a large scale
and prices of the leading speculative issues
registered gains all around, with Union Pacific
and Atchisun lines unusually heavy. The gen- j
eral speculation exhibited a strong tone and
furnished ample evidence that large amounts
of capital were seeking investment In stable '
securities at remunerative rates. The aggre- j
gate sales were $2,131,000.
Government bonds were easy in tone, the old ;
registered 4's ruling % lower.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 246,500
shares, including: 9900 Atchison preferred, 19,- 1
055 Baltimore and Ohio, 13,712 Burlington, 9155 j

NEW YORK. June 22â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet, dull and featureless
to-day. Improvement in Brazils continue.
Spanish 4s were flat. It is understood that
coupons held by residents In Spain are not to
be sold on a gold basis. This led to selling on
Spanish account. Americans were quiet and
dull, closing a shade above the worst. New
York selling of B. & O. was the feature. Ca
nadian Pacific and Grand Trunk were good.
The rate war Is said to be sealed.
The money market here Is still easier to-day.
It is an even chance whether the bank rate
will or will not be reduced to-morrow.
The fact that a new Indian loan Is soon to
come out favors a decline before long. v â â â¢â¢.-

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
'CHICAGO, June Wheat started weak on
the fine weather throughout the country. The
denial from Paris of any serious damage by
rust to the French crop was also a factor at the
opening. Liverpool cables were an additional
disappointment to the bulls, as it was ex
pected that the sharp bu)ge yesterday In Chi
cago would be reflected on the other side. Un
der such conditions the bulls soon began to feel
nervous and let go a good deal of their high
priced Wheat. September, which closed yes
terday at 69c, sold down to 67% c. July, which
left off last night at 74%@74%c, declined to 73c.
The domestic crop reports were not universally
fayorable by any means, but the good so
largely exceeded the bad that the latter no
longer had the effect of alarming any one about
the general result. The elaborate arrangements
that were made yesterday to market the enor
mous cash Wheat holdings did not have the
altogether reassuring effect that was appar
ently expected.
The failure of a small French house In the
grain trade was reported and the name of the
principal being Dreyfus, it was at first feared
to be the great firm of Louis Dreyfus & Co. I
of Paris. . That caused one of the market's
weakest moments. There was a sharp rally
from the lowest point when it was known that
the Dreyfus who had failed was . an insignifi
cant concern doing a small business on a lim
ited capital. July closed %@%c lower and Sep
tember lost 1%@1%c.
Lassitude prevailed In Corn, occasioned by
the bright sunshine. improved crop reports and
lack of export demand, and it closed %c down.
Oats sympathized with other declines. July
closed %c lower.
Heavy receipts of Hogs and the weakness of
Wheat caused a heavy feeling In Provisions.
The dregs of the yellow fever scarce were also
to be found at the bottom of the depression.
July pork closed 5c lower, lard and ribs 2%c
lower.

"Wooden shoes in France are pro
duced to the extent of about 4,000,000
pairs yearly. They are made in Al
sace and Barriers by machinery, and in
Lozere by hand. In the last named
province 1700 persons are engaged in
this manufacture, and the yearly pro
duct is morethan half a million pairs.
In Berlin the firemen wear water
jackets with a double skin, which they
are able to fill with water from the
hose. If the space between the two
layers becomes overfilled, the water
escapes through a valve at the top of
the helmet, and flows down over the
fireman like a cascade, protecting him
doubly.

COMPANY A
IS AGGRIEVED
Believe Oakland Should \
Send Two Companies.
LOCATING THE MILITARY CAMP
COLONEL HENSHAW SPENDS A
DAY INSPECTING.
Company F Musters and Is Much
Gratified at Being Chosen
for Service by tho
Governor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 22.
There Is groat disappointment among
local militiamen that Governor Budd
should have accepted Company F and
co far declined Company A. At the bar
racks this morning the members of Com
pany F were busy beating up the entire
company for the muster, which took place
to-night. Couriers were sent out In all
directions, so that the roll call might be
complete. On the other hand, in the ad
joining room at the armory, members of
Company A looked on the preparations
â with jealous and disappointed eyes. This
tftsappointment was not softened by an
Interview with Governor Budd published
in a morning paper, stating that in mak
ing his choice of the Second California
Regiment he had disregarded all argu
ment but that ofi efficiency. This dis
tinction applied to Company A is perhaps
a trifle hard, as the two companies are
eaid to be equal in tactics and efficiency
and each is well equipped.
At to-night's muster Company F re
ceived its orders, and from this time on
they must be ready at an hour's notice
to march into camp. There is much en
thusiasm shown in the ranks, and the
boys, after waiting so long in suspense,
declare they are much pleased at the call
for their services.
This afternoon Colonel Park Henshaw,
accompanied by many citizens and mili
tary men, made a tour of sites available
for a military camp ground. They took
a special car and inspected Blair Park.
Bushrod Park, some large vacant blorks
in North Oakland and the Pierce grounds.
The inspection company consisted of, in
addition to the colonel, Major Baldwin.
Captain Norman. F. \V. Farwell. \V. W.

Sharp. G. B. Daniels, M. J. Keller, A. H.
Breed. J. Colquhoun, Mayor Thomas,
Frank Tavlor. Edson F. Adams, Sol
Kahr., M. Schleuter and R. M. Fitzgerald.
Colonel Henshaw will report to Gov
ernor Budd at once, and when the Sec
ond California Regiment goes into camp
it will probably rendezvous on this side
of the bay.
The roster of Company F us it stands
to-day is as follows:

CHIEF LEES
USED HIS
INFLUENCE
Colt's Rifles for the
Department.
RUMORS OF A PUT-UP JOB
2LOCAL FIRMS CONDEMN THE
CHIEF'S CHOICE.
Jit Would Seem That Some Very Queer
"Competition" Was Allowed in
the Placing of a Large and
Important Order.
When the venerable head of the local
Police Department again rides forth at
the head of his stalwarts, either as escort
to departing troops or in the great parade
on the Fourth of July, he will have the
satisfaction of knowing that his minions
of tho law are armed with a death-dealing
rifle which, although somewhat out of
date, Is a relic of the days when he
-worked as a boy in the Colt firearm fac
tory. . ,; ; r,-'
Sad to relate, the Chief has again al
lowed his feelings to get the better of his
judgment. He has used his prerogative
to obtain an arm for the department
which has not been heard of In this city
in years, and has brought criticism on
himself by completely Ignoring the Win
chester Arms Company, the Marlin Rifle
Company and other large manufacturers
â¢who tried to secure the order. The firms
named might have submitted to the in
evitable had they been given a chance to
show the valuable qualities of their rifles,
but as this was not permitted the action
has brought forth some unkind remarks.
Chief Lees has been accused of favorit
ism, and murmurs of a "job" have been
heard. This was ail brought about through
the changing of rifles in the department.
At present the police are using Winches
ters In their drills, but it was deemed by
the powers that be that they were too
heavy and cumbersome, so a new weapon
was ordered. The Chief, having had some
experience as a young man in *Â£**>Â»
remembered that the Union Metallic Cart
ridge Company handled the memento of
days gone by. so he sent to that firm for
X samples. They not only sent them
but dispatched a good salesman to con
vince the Chief that the Colt rifle was
the only real thing in the market. The
complicated weapon was explained thor
oughly to him. and he took the matter
under consideration. In his sleep he
dreamed of the gun, but a twinge of con
science came to him. and he remembered
that other citizens represented well-known
The nlxt r day he sent one of his men to
the Winchester agency for a specimen of
their work. They were told that rifles ( for
the department were under consideration,
but they would not be permitted to send
a representative to explain the valuable
features about their weapon. Mr. Miller,
the local agent for the company, paid a
visit "the Chief, but returned having
received very little satisfaction.
Samples of the Marlin rifle were also
handed over to the police for : Inspection,
but with like success. When the local
r^nr^entat ye for the well-known arm
clued on Lees he was info.mcd that it
had been decided to use the Colt rifle.
Strong objection was made against the
election on every hand by men familiar
with firearms. One expert stated yester
day that ..the Colt, rifle was : practically

RED CROSS ACTIVITY.
a
More Workers Are Needed at Head-
quarters.
BERKELEY, Juno 22.â The headquar
ters of the Berkeley branch of the Red
Cross Society were opened again to-day
and work was begun upon a new lot of
bandages to be sent with the next trans
ports that leave San Francisco. This
evening 123 piaster bandages had been
finished. The progress was somewhat
slow owing to the scarcity of workers,
and the committee in charge is going to
Issue an urgent appeal asking all ladies
of the town who can possibly spare the
time to come to the headquarters and
assist in getting supplies ready.
Mrs. F. V. Pagret. who has had charge
of collecting and forwarding papers and
magazines to the soldiers, sent to San
Francisco this afternoon a shipment of
twenty-one boxes. She reports a total of
fifty boxes forwarded since the Berkeley
branch was organized.
To-morrow afternoon a general meeting
will be held at the residence of Mrs. C. EL
Greenleaf for the purpose of discussing
the proposed celebration for the Fourth
of July. The meeting will begin at half
past 3*. and all those interested are in
vited to be present. The Fourth of July
committee consists of Professor Thomas
R. Bacon, Mrs. A. Marquand, A. W. Nay
lor and Dr. J. Coyle.
To Increase the Water Supply
BERKELEY, June *2.â The Francisco
street well will soon be the water supply
of West Berkeley. Workmen are now
engaged in erecting a pumping plant an-l
laying mains from the well to the tank
on University avenue, near Shattuck
avenue. From there the water can be
carried directly into West Berkeley. The
Alameda Water Company expects to gain
an increase of at least 70,000 gallons a day
from this source. By this means there
will be a corresponding gain for the busi
ness portion of the town, as the amount
formerly supplied to West Berkeley is
now to be used for sprinkling the streets.
Berkeley News Notes.
BERKELEY. June 22.-The North
Berkeley Volunteer Fire Company elected
officers last night for the coming year as
follows: President. A. L. Qtt; vice-presi
dent, Frank Richards; secretary. J.
Lloyd; treasurer, Harry Squires; fore
man, Edward Florence.
Clive Day. instructor in the department
of history* and political economy of the
University of California, left for the
East yesterday afternoon. He has re
signed his position in the faculty at Rerke
lev and accepted an instructorship at
Yale. Mr. Day will spend the summer in
Europe before beginning his work at the
opening of the next college year.
The north wing of the basement of
North Hall, formerly used as a study
room for the women students of the Uni
versity of California, is being altered and
repaired. It will be turned over to the
men next August as a locker room.
The First Baptist Church on Allston
way celebrated, its ninth anniversary to
night. After a supper served in the
church parlors the rollcall was read of
all members who had belonged to the
church since its organization nine years
ago.
unknown and out of date; that while it
was not obsolete the Winchester and
Marlin rifles had overshadowed and
passed It. A visit was made to leading
gun stores and this statement was found
to be true. Although the gun was kept
in stock very few sales were recorded.
A representative of the Winchester
Arms Company, in speaking about the
matter yesterday, said: "Mr. Miller was
not permitted to show the good points
of our gun. He went out there but could
receive no satisfaction, which led us to
believe that a job was on foot to push
through a cut and dried programme.
The rifle thpy have out there now is a
'73 model and shoots the same cartridge
that the Colt does. It may be heavy,
but we think it is just as good as the one
chosen. The one we sent out was lighter
and more compact and not as compli
cated as the Colt. We would have been
willing to have taken back the old guns
and given them a bonus if they had pur
chased our arm."
McKEEVER WILL GO EAST.
The Clever Philadelphian Will Back
McConnell Against Daly or
Tracy.
Charley McKeever was a very much
depressed man in spirits yesterday. He
acknowledged that he expected to defeat
McConnell in less than twenty rounds
and, above all things, a knockout was the
last thing he looked for when he entered
the ring on Tuesday evening.
When asked for an opinion concerning
the future of the local welterweight Mc-
Keever did not hesitate to say that Mc-
Connell was sufficiently qualified to hold
his own against any man of the class he
represents, and that if he should meet
Daly or Tracy he (McKeever) will have
money on the lad from Frisco.
"I did not look for a right-hand smash
j when McConnell's glove landed on my
I chin," said McKeever, "in fact, I was
i certain of landing my left, but McCon
â  nells quick shift of the head saved him
from what I think would have been a
| finishing touch.
"Well, the young fellow surprised me
and you will find that he will do likewise
to a good many of the fighters who are
rated in the championship class."
McKeever will leave for the East short
; ly, unless he can arrange another match
! on this coast in the very near future.
McConnell is ready for another en
gagement at a moment's notice and
doubtless some of the athletic clubs will
! sign to fight either Jack Daly or Tom
Tracy.
The betting on the fight started at 10
to 7, with McKeever on the long end,
then It ran to even money, but a flood of
Eastern coin arrived a few hours before
the contest, which ran McKeever's end
up, and the betting closed at 10 to 6% with
McConnell on the short end. The lucky
ones who had winning tickets to cash in
the paris mutuels received $38 for every
dollar they gambled.
It is said that the renson for the delay
at Woodward's- Pavilion was occasioned
by an attachme t th.-:t Jake Raver had
against the National Club.
A Golden Gate Valley Celebration.
The merchants of Golden Gate Valley
are going to give a grand Fourth of July
celebration at the end of Fillmore street,
in the Fair estate lagoon, on the night of
the Fourth. At a meeting held last night
at Dewey Hall, on Fillmore and Fran
cisco streets, it was decided to give a
dance at Stemke Hall, on Octavia and
Union streets, on Wednesday, June 29,
for the benefit of the celebration. Much
interest is shown by the members of the
club. Subscription books were issued to
several members yesterday, and have al
ready shown good results.
Sale of Government Bonds.
Cashier E. A. O'Connor of the Postofflce
began yesterday morning taking sub-^
scrlptions for the sale of the Government
3 per cent bonds. At the close of office
hours he had received applications for
over $100,000 worth. He expects a big rush
to-morrow.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Margaret Long has applied for a divorce
from Patrick Long, alleging extreme
cruelty as a cause for action. Ella M.
Sanford filed suit yesterday against Eben
A Sanford for divorce. The plaintiff al
leges cruelty as a cause of complaint.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 23, 1898.
RODGER'S TRIAL
NEARLY ENDED
The Jury Will Decide To-
Morrow Afternoon.
STORY OF THE PRISONER
HE WAS IN MORTAL FEAR OF
THE DECEASED.
Halsey Had Threatened Him So
Often That He Decided to Take
No Chance on Hia
Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 22.
The fate of Stacey Rodgers will be
with the jury to-morrow evening. This
afternoon the taking of the testimony
ended and counsel stipulated that each
side should consume two and a half j
hours in argument to-morrow, as Judge
Ellsworth is anxious that the case should !
only occupy one more day. The instruc
ttons of the court will not tnke long, and j
the slayer of Halsey will hear his ver
dict or know that the jury has disagreed
to-morrow evening.
Rodgers was put on the stand by
attorneys this . morning. His evidence
was used for the purpose of showing ;
that Halsey was a quarrelsome man who
ha4< on several occasions, threatened the j
life Of the accused. Rodgers stated that ;
Halsey had tnld him he had killed a man !
in Guatemala and had left that country j
as a fugrtlve. Rodgers further testified :
that Halsey had figured in several scrapes
and that his favorite weapon of defense I
was a knife. This bore out the testimo- !
ny of the woman who a few days ago
testified that Halsey regularly carried a
knife over a foot long in his jacket pock
et. With much calmness Rodgers told
the story of the fatal night on which he j
shot Halsey. Previous to this visit to j
the Haynes house, where the murder or- :
curred, Rodgers met Halsey in a cellar !
and ascertained from him whether his
own life was in danger. Halsey renewed
his threat and ever afterward Rodgers
kept out of his way. The story of the :
murder was briefly told by the witness. |
He went to Haynes 1 house and after he
turned to go Halaey rushed at him like I
a wild man, uttering vile epithets, j
Rodgers turned around, and when he saw
Halsey with hands lifted in an aggres
sive attitude he believed he was about to
strike him with his knife. Owing to the I
darkness he could not see what was in j
Ilalsey's hand. Without a moment's
thought he pulled his gun and fired while
It was still in his pocket.
The prisoner stated that he was 21
years of age and had known Halsey for I
three years, but not intimately for more i
than two months. He said that Halsey !
once remarked: "A man is a fool to go J
around without protection. I always car
ry a companion."
The latter part of the afternoon was
taken up with testimony in rebuttal of
Rodgers' evidence regarding Halsey's
character. Town Treasurer Wells of I
Berkeley and a witness named Davis, i
who was once a partner of the deceased, j
were put on the stand, but they proved I
of no value, testifying to the general rep- j
IOWA'S TROOPS TO
BE THEIR GUESTS.
NATIVE DAUGHTERS TO GIVE
AN ENTERTAINMENT.
A Grand Reception Will Be Given in
Aid of the Red Cross Society
Next Week.
Preparations are, being made by the
Native Daughters of the Golden West
Red Cross Aid to give the lowa
troops a reception similar to the one
given Minnesota's representatives at
the Mechanics' Institute a week ago. It
is intended to hold the affair In the
Mechanics' Pavilion on either Monday or
Tuesday evening, the proceeds to be
turned over to the Red Cross Society. Al
ready committees are working energeti
cally with a view of making the affair a
greater success than the initial display.
As before, the Pavilion will be tastefully
decorated, distinguished soldiers and civil
ians will be invited and everything done
to bring a generous public there, so as to
give the visitors a royal welcome. A
splendid feast will be prepared by the
ladies of the well-known society, and it
Is thought that the light fantastic will be
tripped in honor of the boys in blue.
Soldiers will be admitted to the Pavilion
at a cheaper rate. This will be done, as
many hundred campmates wish to see
their brothers in arms exhibit their drill
ing abilities before a large gathering.
At the last meeting of the Native
Daughters' Aid the following neat sums
were received: Commercial Travelers of
America, Golden Gate Council No So $50-
Pacific Parlor, $5; National Parlor. $20;
Golden Gato Parlor, 100 yards of flannel.

TO STORM MORRO CASTLE.
Plans for an Elaborate Celebration of
the Fourth in Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 22.â The execu
tive committee of the Fourth of July
celebration presented plans to-night that
guarantee a very extensive and elaborate
observance of the great -holiday. The 2500
Boldiers that will be here to give a :jham
battle will be feasted twice and every
thing possible will be done to make it as
much of a holiday for them as for the
public.
Part of tho military maneuvers will
consist of the storming of a' Morro Castle
that will be built on Adams Point and
which will support till it is destroyed by
a Ilotchkiss gun the only foreign flag to
be permitted in sight on the Fourth. The
committees having charge of the parade,
decorations, fireworks and exercises were
empowered to go ahead, and the general
committee has guaranteed the necessary
funds. The conclusion of the celebration
will be a grand display of fireworks on
Lake Merritt, to include the destruction
by a torpedo of a large monitor to be
built for the occasion. The celebration is
in charge of a most influential body of
'â â¢im.i-ns. and they expect to have nearly
a hundred thousand visitors in Oakland
for the occasion.
BOARD OF EDUCATION.
Teachers Elected for the Ensuing
Term and Salaries Established.
ALAMEDA, June 22.â At last night's
meeting of the Board of Education the
important step was taken of selecting the
teachers for the public schools for the en
suing term and also fixing their salaries.
But few changes were made in the per
sonnel of the staff of teachers, as those
now occupying positions have been care
fully selected and give uniform satisfac
tion. There were two resignations and
their places were filled.
Returned From Fort Romey.
ALAMEDA, June 22.â Miss Elizabeth
McLean of this city has just returned
from Fort Romey, the Salvation Army
colony at Soledad, where she has been
since last January assisting in getting the
colonists started. She says that despite
the bad season the colonists are getting
a good start. They have upward of 150
acres of growing crops, which are irri
gated, and are busy planting more. None
of the colonists are discouraged, all have
plenty to eat, and while all work hard
nothing has occurred to call for the pub
lished statement that the colony is a
failure.
The Baker Inquest.
ALAMEDA, June 22.â The inquest upon
the remains of George M. Baker, who was

He had a ranch near Concord, which he
lost by foreclosure. In IS!>6 his wife left
him with their child, and Baker soon
after left Martinez. It is said he was
in the habit of going on sprees, and
it may have been in one that he lost his
life.

Two most pitiable cases were brought
to tlio Patriotic Homp Helpers' Society's
headquarters yesterday, and while they
â¢are only two of many cases now in the
hands of the society, their absolute need
should appeal to every charitably dis
posed person. One is a woman with six
children, whose only support, a son, has
enlisted in the cavalry. She is abso
lutely destitute, without food or money,
her bedding and mattresses having been
taken away by the landlord. The other
is one of sickness and poverty. The hus
band having enlisted in the navy she is
alone and in need of medical attendance.
The society does all in its power to al
leviate distress, but each case has to be
investigated first, so donations of money
and food are most earnestly solicited.
The two women who are collecting
from house to house in the vicinity of
Pacific ;\venue and Jackson street are
impostors, and the public is warned by
the Red Cross not to aid them.
The Austrian Military and Benevolent
Association will hold its twentieth an

made efforts to make this occasion a dis
tinctly enjoyable one, and expects to be
liberally patronized.

THE MILLINER
CAPITULATES
Will Not Fight for Her
Adopted Child.
FLORENCE WITH HER FATHER
SUDDEN ENDING OF A VERY
LIVELY CONTEST.
Mrs. Beaglehole Agrees to Allow
Miss Beaver to Go to Her Par
ent, Who Will Support
Her.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 22.
There is to be no contest over the cus
tody of Florence Beaver, the adopted
daughter of Mrs. Eva May Beaglehole, a
Reno milliner. The case was disposed of
to-day by Mrs. Beaglehole consenting that
letters of guaruianship should be issued
to the girl's father.
During the testimony that was taken it
developed that Mrs. Beaglehole had not
been all that she represented herself.
The evidence showed that she had once
been convicted in the San Francisco
Police Court of beating the girl and that
she had been taken away from her by the
San Francisco Society for Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. Judge Paterson of
San Francisco tried to make it appear
that Mrs. Montgomery of the Beulah
Home obtained the custody of the child
on proceedings based on Mrs. Beaglehole s
refusal to permit the girl to parade with
the Salvation Army at Reno. Mrs. Mont
gomery replied that such was not the
case, as the information they had was of
a much more serious nature. Mrs. Mont
gomery declared that Mrs. Beaglehole
had gone, to her making false representa
tions. She declared she was a member of
a Baptist church at Reno, but inquiry de
veloped the fact that she had been ex
pelled from the church.
When the testimony was concluded it
was agreed that the contest over the
father's petition for guardianship should
be renewed in court this morning, but a
compromise prevented it.
The stipulation between the parties Is
to the effect that the letters of adoption
granted Mrs. Beaglehole are still in force
and that the child be given into the cus
tody of her father, who agrees to support
her and take all proper care of her. For
the present Florence will remain with Mrs.
Montgomery.

YUKON VESSELS.
Those Carrying Passengers May Soon
Be Subject to Inspection.
The movement of the Supervisors and
the Chamber of Commerce to have sail
ing vessels carrying passengers inspected
by Federal officials before leaving port
is beginning to bear fruit. After a num
ber of disasters and mishaps, like those
of the Almy and Jane Gray, in which
lives were lost, the bodies mentioned
came to the conclusion that it was time
for all sailing vessels carrying passen
gers to be inspected to determine if they^
were safe to carry such precious freight.'
A resolution was sent to Senator Per
kins, expressing the desire of having
some law passed whereby such ships
Bhould be inspected by a Federal officer,
as at the present time none stands on
the books. Senator Perkins went to
work as requested, and what has been
accomplished is shown by the following
letter, received yesterday:
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 15. IS9B.
Hon. Hugh Craig, President Chamber of
Commerce â My Dear Sir: Your telegram of
June 14 relative to supervision by the United
States of sailing vessels carrying passengers Is
at hand and a copy has been placed in th?
hands of each member of the delegation. The
matter has been called to the attention of the
Treasury Department and I am now preparing
a. bill bearing on the subject, which I will in
troduce at once.
I had already had one branch of this subject
under considerationâ relative to barges and
hulks, which It was the custom to tow from
Puget Soundâ and in March last introduced a
bill amending the statutes, making such
changes as were recommended by General Du
mont. This bill has passed the Senate and Is
now before the House. In the bill I shall In
troduce I will carry out your later suggestions.
Yours very truly, GEORGE C. PERKINS.

Lottie M. Lynch, one-third; to Robert
Newton Lynch, in trust for testatrix's

the testatrix.
The will of Mrs. Katherine Kieffer, who
died in this city on the 9fh inst., leaving
an estate valued at $6000, was filed for

BED CROSS FUNDS.
OAKLAND, June 22.â The Red Cross
League is somewhat divided regarding the
Bcope of its work. There has been some
difference of opinion expressed, and at
the meeting yesterday the president, Mrs.
Abbott, declared that some remarks made
by Mrs. Friend were "insubordinate."
Mrs. Friend is chairman of the Fifth
Ward Promoting Committee and she ai
once resigned and Miss Maria Rahson, a
member of the executive committee, did
likewise.
"My remarks did not apply to any par
ticular member or committee." said Mrs.
Abbott to-day. "I hope neither Mrs.
Friend nor Miss Babson will resign from
I the committee, and I think when they un
derstand what I really intended by my
remarks they will not. There is a ten
dency on the part of some people to
criticize the executive board for with
holding its money, but we feel it is abso
lutely necessary to watch out for funds
I closely. We are ordered by the State so
| ciety to do so and we must not disobey
orders. No one has any right to criticize
us for obeying orders and I mentioned the
matter as I thought it a proper time to
call the attention of the ladies to the fact
I that we look upon the Red Cross funds
j as a public trust, not to be touched upon
"The State society has already called
upon the San Francisco Society for $5000
and we understand it will be our turn to
give next, so we must be in readiness to
meet the call. I am sorry that my re
marks have caused any unpleasantness
and I will explain matters."
"I resigned from the promoting com
mittee because I felt that I did not want
to be chairman of a committee whose re
ports were not approved by the presi
dent," said Mrs. Friend this morning-. "I
will, however, remain in the Red Cross
Society."
Big Estate in Trouble.
OAKLAND, June 22.â The vast estate of
the Pratt minors is so heavily in debt that
permission was asked of the court to-day
to mortgage it for $27,450 to pay off some
of the indebtedness. Unless objection is
made all the estate, with the exception of
the family residence at Fruitvale, will be
mortgaged.

JUDGE LOW
AS A PUBLIC
PROSECUTOR
Officer Smith Incurs His
Displeasure.
THE POLICEMAN THREATENED
THE JUDGE FAVORS HIS FRIEND
ATTORNEY MAHONEY.
His Honor Does Not Relish the Task
Given Him by the Jury.
A New Trial
Brewing.
The case of Attorney W. H. Mahoney,
convicted by a jury on the charge of ob
structing a street crossing, has exempli
fied tho fact that Judge Low is under
certain circumstances subject to absence
of memory as to his official capacity.
The facts in connection with the arrest
of Mahoney and his trial and conviction
by a jury have already been published.
While a regiment was marching along
Market street on Its way to Camp Mer
ritt, Mahoney was in front of a crowd
at Eddy and Market streets. Policeman
W. J. Smith was detailed to keep the
crowd back. He warned Mahoney to
move back, but the attorney refused, and
practical y dared the otneer to arrest
him. The officer did what he believed
was his duty and booked a charge of ob
structing the street crossing against Ma
honey.
During the trial last Thursday it was
shown that Mahoney bitterly resented
his arrest and made a threat that h>
would "break" the officer. He had four
or live witnesses who testified in his fa
vor, and ex-Judge Forral to defend him,
but the jury believed that the officer had
not exceeded his duty and convicted Ma
honey. Judge l.mv continued th>
till Saturday, wh< n Mahoney was to ap
pear for senence.
The case was called on Saturday, but
ex-Judge Ferral made a motion for a
new trialâ an almost unprecedented step
in the Police Court alter conviction by a
juryâ and after some informal talk the
cue wus again continued till yesti i
Yesterday Judge Low was asked what
he intended to do in the case and he
promptly answered. "Dismiss it."
He wus asked the reason, and he re
plied that Policeman Smith had apolo- j
gtaed to Mahoney and Mahoney had ;
promised not to bring Smith before the
Police Commissioners, so that it was all
L To confirm his statement he sent j
for the officer, who admitted going to j
Mahoney after the trial and saying to;
him that he had no personal feeling in
the matter, but simply did his duty, and
was willing to shake hands with him as ;
a citizen. Nothing, however, was said j
about what the Police Commissioners
might do in the case.
"Well, what do you want?" angrily
asked the Judge.
"This man has been convicted by a
jury," replied Smith, "and I want to see
sentence passed upon him."
"All right," said the Judge as he strucK
the desk with his list, "I shall continue
the case till Saturday and you will have
to look out for yourself." The latter part
of the expression was said in a threaten
ing mamiiT.
The Judge later said that he would ad
vis.- Mahoney to bring the officer before
:ilice Commissioners and he would
personally see that the charge was prose
cuted, a â  the language use-l by the officer
to Mahoney, he claimed, was dlsgracefu*.
Polio? i: .in Smith says he is not afraia
of the threat to bring him before the
commissioners. He insists that as Ma
honey has been convicted by a jury he
ought to be punished and he cannot see
why he should be treated differently from
any other person convicted of an offenss.
"I wanted to show Mahoney," said
Smith, "that I was not the mad bull that
he represented me to be and that I simply
did my duty as a police officer in arresting
him. That was why I went up to him anu
as a citizen offered to shake hands with
him after the trial. If Judge Low thinks
he can Intimidate me he Is very much
mistaken. The man has been convicted
by a Jury of his own seeking and the
duty of the Judge is to sentence him."
.IN INDIGNANT ATTORNEY.
Otto turn Suden Threatens to
. "Break" Police Captain Sey
mour.
Otto turn Suden, the attorney, has un
dertaken the task of "breaking" Police I
Captain Seymour, because of the recent :
order made by the Captain preventing
attorneys from entering the City Prison
unless on a permit, to . see a prisoner.
Suden was sent for yesterday by John O. j
Kane, an employe of Hildebrand, Posner j
& Co., 610 Front street, who was ar- j
rested on a warrant charging him with !
grand larceny, at the Instance of John i
Gell, saloon-keeper, 225 Third street. ]
The charge arose out of the manner in !
which Kane got $150 from Gell. . Suden j
went to. the prison, but Sergeant L.lnd
heimer declined to admit him without a
permit . from headquarters. Suden was
indignant, and, meeting Seymour, angrily
asked him why he should be made a mes
senger for me Police Department by car
rying a permit to the prison. The Cap
tain explained to him the reason for issu
ing the. order, but the attorney was not
to be pacified, and threatened to have the
Captain removed from his position. Chief
Lees later sent a permit to the attor- 1
ney's office, and he presented it at the
prison and was admitted.
A STRANGER UUNKOED.
The Police Searching for Three Men
Who Relieved John Kirkwood.
of His Money.
Captain Bohen's orders to have the city I
cleared of bunko men have not been car- i
rled out, although a number of the "sure j
thing" gang were rounded up last week |
and were given a chance to go to i
Alaska.
Yesterday John Kirkwood, a stranger, ,
who Is temporarily living at 217 Third
street, swore to a complaint in Judge
Mogan'B court, charging three bunko I
men, whose names ho did not know, with
swindling him out of $12;" by ;i card |
game on June IS. It was the same old j
story of a chance acquaintance, a visit
to a room and an Introduction to two j
other nico men, followed by a game of |
cards. Kirkwood saw a chance to make I
money r-asily. and was quickly relieved of !
all the cash he had.
Detectives Egan and T. B. Gibson are j
now Beaching for the bunko men. who i
if arrested, will have to answer a charge !
of grand larceny.
A New Swindle.
A new swindle was worked on the owner
of a Natoma-street house yesterday aft
ernoon by a man who evidently wanted
but little money but wanted that little
bad. The house in question has had a
"flat to let" sign prominently displayed
for several days, and yesterday a
stranger, accompanied by an expressman.
called on the landlady and told her that
Tie was looking for rooms which he wished
to occupy at once. The landlady showed
him through the house and he appeared
so well satisfied with everything
that he dispatched the expressman
with a note to his wife, asking
her tor $15 to pay the rent in ad
vance.- He then measured the height of
the chimney with a string, remarking
that he would be obliged to buy a new
pipe, and borrowed 75 cents from the
landlady and disappeared. About two
hours later the expressman came back
with the information that if such a house
had existed as he was directed to it would
be somewhere near the middle of what is
now Golden Gate Park. The expressman
le still mourning his wasted afternoon.
the landlady her coin, while the stranger
in all probability is congratulating him

HAWAII IS
NOT NEEDED
Opponents of Annexa
tion Yet Argue.
WHITE'S SPEECH RESUMED
DECLARES THAT MORE TER
RITORY IS NOT REQUIRED.
Pettigrew Relieves the California
Senator and Points Out Some of
the Interesting Issues In
volved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 22.â Opponents
of the annexation of Hawaii occupied
the time of the Senate to-day. White
(D.) of California resumed his speech
begun yesterday, but after speaking
two hours yielded the lloor to Pettigrew
| (R.) of South Dakota, who discussed j
; the resolutions for an hour and a half. I
White has not concluded his speech, j
Pettigrew taking up the argument
against the -resolutions merely to af
: ford him an opportunity to rest.
When the resolutions providing for the
i annexation of Hawaii were laid be-
I fore the Senate, While of California re- \
; sumed his speech begun yesterday in op
position to the resolutions. White pre
: sented additional arguments and citations
of authorities to establish his position
that annexation of foreign territory must
; be by treaty and could not be by legis
j lative act.
: After concluding his presentation of the
i legal and constitutional objections he had
! to urge against the resolutions. White
entered upon a discussion of the state
ments that the possession of tRe Hawaiian
Islands was a military necessity to the -
United States, particularly as the Gov
ernment now had important interests in ,
the Philippines. He ridiculed the idea that
the Hawaiian group was needed by this
I country as a half-way station to Manila.
He pointed out that from San Francisco
It was 4ls milts nearer to Manila by way
of Unalaska than it was by Honolulu. He j
said, too, it had been urged that the Ha- :
waiiun Islands were needed as a defense
of the Nicaragua canal. He thought it
much more desirable to defend the canal
from San Francisco, which was 2700 miles
from the terminus, or from San Diego,
only 22' Xi miles away.
At great length White ridiculed the
statements of the naval and military ex
that the United States ought to
hold the Hawaiian group as a military
: â¢ essity, to prevent its seizure by any
nation, and to use it as a stepping
stone across the Pacific. He maintained
yon if the arguments of the experts
were correct, the United States, possess
ing the islands, would have to surround
them with tremendous naval power to de
fend them in time tÂ»f war.
"No one," declared White, "is seeking
for a fight with us, and no one ever will.
If the Pacific Coast is not well defended
now. how will you make it easier to de-
Vby acquiring other teritory that also
t be defended? If we consummate this
me we will be told we must have the
.ppines, because Hawaii is not worth
h unless we can have something else
ie it for. And when we have annexed
Philippines we must have something
else. So we will extend our action around
the globe and enter upon an imperialistic
Py. Is it for a coaling station that ,
ropose to change our policy? If so, !
he Government get our coaling sta
(Pearl Harbor) and let the Govern
; of the Hawaiian Islands proceed to
; out its destiny, whatever that may
If we need a coaling station in the
Hawaiian Islands it does not follow that
w iv t-d the islands. If we need a coaling
station in China it does not follow that
we need the entire Chinese empire."
White maintained that there would be
DO impropriety in this Government en
tering a protest against any other nation
interfering with the present Government
of Hawaii, and in the face of such a pro- ]
test no nation would interfere. Shortly
after 3 o'clock White said he was much
fatigued and yielded the floor to Petti
grew of South Dakota. White will pro
ceed with his speech to-morrow.
In beginning his discussion of the Ha
waiian resolutions Pettigrew said he pre
sumed the homestead provision had been
Btricken from the Indian bill for reasons
of economy, yet $10,000,000 in duties was to
be remitted on Hawaiian sugar and other
Hawaiian products, all of which was in
favor of Asiatic labor.
"I had hoped," said he, "that the ques
tion of adopting a policy of annexation,
of a policy of imperialism, might be set
aside until the present war is over. In
stead of that we are being propelled
to an issue by an Interest which has
crowded around this capitol for years,
that of the sugar trust. We are to be
forced to action."
Pettigrew maintained that the terri
lof the United States was already
c enough, and he believed it his duty
esist the acquisition of any territory
bited by a people far inferior to ours
o located as to require a navy to de
[ it. In case of war with another
on our foreign possessions would be
first attacked. He believed the United
States ought not to enter into competi
tion with the great European powers
either in the supporting of a great navy
or in the acquisition of foreign territory.
At 4:65 p. m. Pettigrew, not having con
cluded his speech, the Senate went into
executive session, and at 5:15 adjourned.
ADMITS SHE GAVE
FALSE TESTIMONY
Third Witness in the Carson Orphan- j
age Investigation to Confess
Perjury.
CARSON, June 22.â Miss Hannah
Thomas, a young woman employed at
the Nevada Orphans' Home, and who
testified at the recent investigation, has
made affidavit in Virginia City to the ef
fect that the testimony she gave before
the board of inquiry was false. This Is
the third affidavit made in the case by |
witnesses for .the Home management ad
mitting that they perjured themselves.
After reviewing such parts of her testi
mony which she claims was untrue, she
says :
"In giving said testimony I did so at
the request of Mrs. Beebe (the matron)
and Miss Stock, whose character was the i
subject-matter of the investigation. â  I
was reluctant to so testify, but Mrs.
Beebe Importuned me for more than one
day and on several occasions each day,
until she overcame my scruples and I
finally testified as she desired. I make
this affidavit and corrections in my testi
mony given at said Investigation freely
and voluntarily and for the purpose â¢of
doing justice to all parties concerned."
Most of the witnesses are childrenâin
mates of the Institutionâ and a number
of them claim they, were forced to swear
to statements put in their mouths by the
management. It is reported the Grand
Jury of Ormsby County will take up the
matter at Its next session. j
Pursued by a Mountain Lion
SALINAS. June 22.â Owing to the scarcity
of food, mountain lions are coming down
to the valleys. This afternoon Mrs. Crall,
residing in Pine Canyon, about live miles
from town, while going to a neighbor's
house with three children, was trailed
several hundred feet by an immense lion.
A large shepherd dog with the woman
made for the lion, which took fright at
the barking and decamped. Mrs. Crall
was so frightened that she was ill for
several hours.
Will Celebrate Anyway.
WOODLAND. June 22.â Woodland has
been so heavily taxed during the past
month in entertaining fraternal organi
zations and in sustaining the Red Cross
Society that It has been decided not to
hold any formal celebration of the
Fourth of July this year. The day will
be fittingly observed at Knights Landing,
however.

LUMBER CONTRACTS
THAT SAVORED OF
BOLD JOBBERY
E. L.Colnon, President of the Board
of Harbor Commissioners,Soug*ht
to Authorize a Profitable
Combination.
Contractors along the water front
who have grown fat through the favor
itism of Harbor Commissioner Colnon
were much 'alarmed yesterday because
of what they believed to be a desire on
the part of Commissioners Harney and
Herold to put an end to the combina
tion that has been robbing the State
through the medium of contracts let by
the Harbor Commission.
The alarm was caused by the failure
of their patron to authorize the letting
of a contract for lumber at the meet
ing of the board on Tuesday. Had the
contract been let, as was the desire of
Commissioner Colnon, the State would
have been at the mercy of the contrac
tor for the next six months and would
have suffered a direct loss of many
thousands of dollars.
Ab it was, the scheme was nipped in
the bud by Commissioners Harney and
Herold, and now the contractors who
have grown wealthy at the expense < f
the State are speculating as to t!;e
manner in which their friend. Commis
sioner Colnon, was shorn of the power
that he had hitherto exercised to the
prolit of those who were on the inside
of the water front combination.
At the meeting of the Board of Stale
Harbor Commissioners Tuesday bids
were opened for the supply of lumber
to be used on the water front for the
first six months of the next fiscal year.
Had the counsels of Colnon prevailed
the contract would have been let to the
S. E. Slade Lumber Company at a price
of $3 50 a thousand feet in excess of
what the lumber can be bought for in
the open market. So palpable was the
contemplated steal that Colnon'a asso
ciates on the board became aware of
what was going on, and In spite of Col
protests and assurances, they in
sisted on rejecting all of the bids. This
was done, and now there is mourning
on the water front.
A brief recitation of the history , f
this particular contract is necessary to
a full and complete understanding of
the manner in which water front con
tracts are manipulated to the great
profit of those interested in robbing the
Malt.
Through the manipulations of the
lumber combine and interested officials,
former water front lumber contracts
have been let for $14 50 per 1000 feet,
this figure being paid for rough Oregon
pine. As the time approached for the
lotting of the contract for the first six
n.onths of the coming fiscal year the
E. K. Wood Lumber Company broke
away from the combine and put in a
bid to the Harbor Commission offering
to furnish the .umber for $11 50 a thou
sand feet. As s::ch a procedure put
an end to the illegitimate profits of the
water front rins Bteps were taken to
force the rebellious firm back into line.
This was done by means of an aer'?
ment signed by all of the firms in the
combine, by which they bound them
selves not to sell any lumber to the E.
K. Wood Company for less than $14 DO
per one thousand feet. As the E. K.
. "ood Company does not handle !um
bt~ in sufficient quantitits to supply
the demands of the water front con
traci, without drawing upon the yards
of otter dealers, this agreement had
the desired effect, and the E. K. Wood
Company was forced to withdraw its
bid or suffer a very heavy loss.
This having been accomplished, the S.
E. S'.ade Lumber Company, the firm in
which P. F. Dundon is interested, and
which has often profited by the favor of
Commissioner Colnon, as has been
proven in a case recently tried in the
Superior Court, put in a bid, offering to
furnish the lumber at the following
prices: Rough Oregon pine (per thou
sand feet), 3-14. Selected Oregon pine,
$19. Flooring. $24. The Pacific Pine
Lumber Company also put in a bid, the
figures named being 50 cents per thou
sand more than the figures named by
the Slade Company. Both these firms
are in the combine. These were the
only bids presented and it was these
bids that were opened at the meeting
of the Harbor Commission on Tuesday.
Commissioner Colnon asked that the
bid of the S. E. Slade company be ac
cepted, but Commissioners Herold and
Harney demurred and in spite of all
that Colnon could do they stuck to
their belief that an attempt was be
ing made to perpetrate a job, and re
fused to change their votes. Both bids
â¢were accordingly rejected.
To show the huge proportions of the
proposed stf-al it is only necssary to
quote the prices paid for lumber used

did not do any good. At the time I was Induced
to try Cuticura Remedies, he was bo bad that
I had to cat his hair all off, and put the Cuti-
cura (ointment) on him on bandages, as it was
impossible to touch him with the bare hand.
There was not one square inch of skin on his
whole body that teas not affected. lie was one
. mass of sores, and the stench from him was
frightful. The bandages used to stick to his

skin off with them, and the screams from the
poor child were heart-breaking. I began : to

by the penitentiary at San Quentin.
The State Prison purchases its lumber
by contract the same as t'.:e Harbor
Commission and the grade used is the
same. Following are the prices paid:
Rough Oregon pine (per 1000 feet), $12;
selected Oregon pine, $16 ;>0; flooring,
$25. It costs $1 50 pi.T 1000 feet to de
liver the lumber at tho prison, but this
cost falls on the contractor, the Simp
son Lumber Company, a firm that is also
a member of the combine. The prices
quoted are for the lumber delivered at
the prison. The cost of delivery should
be deducted from the price? named
when comparing them with the prices
which Commissioner Colnon wished to
pay the S. E. Slade Lumber Company.
The following table will afford the
reader a chance to make the compari
son at a glance:
Rough. SelPCted. Flooring.
Harbor Commission. sH nn $i<t on $24 no

As to the article of flooring, there is
very little if any of this grade of lum
ber used at the penitent iary and be
cause of this the Board of Prison Di
rectors was not particular as to the
price paid.
To those who are familiar with the
amount of lumber used on the water
front in six months in the building of
piers, wharves, warehouses and other
buildings, the value of the contract
that Commissioner Colnon sought to
have awarded to the S. E. Slade com
pany will be apparent. The illegitimate
profits from such a contract would be
many thousands of dollars.

CHEAP PANTS THREATENED TO GO UP.
Chinese Tailors Form a Trust, but It Is Broken nu the Operators

THE plain unornamented citizen who

world In one, two or three dollar
pants, and who has Lately noticed a
large number of Chinese dressed In
holiday attire, including red button skull
caps, knew not the portent of this gaudy

deadly pen of Blanco, but did not realize
that he was attacked in his own citadel
threatened with a shortage in pants in
this great martâ that might compel him
to emigrate to a clime where such apparel
is not required.
These well-dressed gentlemen of the
almond eye were the erstwhile producers
of cheap pants, and they were on a
"plain, ordinary" strike. They had read
translations of the philippics of fhe late
candidate "William Jennings Bryan, on
trusts." and they would have none of
them, except of their own making.
The trouble all grew out of the fact
that contractors with the Government
were barred from employing Chinese la
bor in the making of clothing for the

ARE NOT "AGENTS"
OF THE GOVERNMENT
Yellow Journals Given the Privilege
Only of Distributing Blank Ap
plications for Bonds.
Call Office, Rtggs House,
Washington, June 22.
Secretary Gage paid to The Call corre
spondent to-day that $20,000,000 had thus
far been subscribed to the popular bond
issue in amounts under $500. The Secre
tary's attention was called to the recent
boast of a San Francisco yellow journal
that it had been selected by the Secretary
of the Treasury to solicit subscriptions;
that it had, in short, been made the Gov
ernment's agent in its hour of need.
Secretary Gage laughed when he read
the yellow paper's self-laudatory article
and said in explanation:
"Various banks, express offices and
country postofflces throughout the coun
try have asked that they be permitted to
receive bond subscriptions. Several news
papers have also tendered their services.
These offers have been accepted. These
various 'agencies' who volunteered their
services do not handle any money.
"All in the world they ..o is tv furnish
blanks for intending subscribers to fill
out and then forward them to the Treas
ury Department. We are very glad for
the express companies, banks, country
postmasters and newspapers to fill out
and forward these blanks, but for any
newspaper to claim that it is 'the Gov
ernment's agent' is noi warranted, for
this would seem to Imply, by inference,
at least, that t he department bad exercised
discrimination. This is not the case."
The Secretary, in order to illustrate the
department's intention, stated that any
body who knew enough to properly fill out
one of the blank bond applications might
ao bo and forward it to the Treasury De
partment, either in his own behalf or for
another party who wished to subscribe.
The Secretary generously offered a bunch
of blanks to The Call correspondent, but
this offer to make him an "asrent of the
Government" was just as politely de
clined.

Seventeenth Street Eoo Club.
Seventeenth Ptrpet has a "800 Club,"
which is composed of a lot of young
toughs whose evening pastime is to con
gregate on the doorsteps of the residences
of that portion of the Mission lying- west
of Valencia street, south of Twentieth
and east of Sanchez.
The members! of this club take particu
lar pride in breaking in the windows of
Cnlnese laundries and pelting old men
with rocks, not forgetting to pass uncom
plimentary remarks to Indies as they pass
by their roosts on the doorsteps. Fruit
stores and other places whore goods are
exposed for sale on the outside of the
store doors are never forgotten by the
members of this club, who make it a
practice to sample the goods without the
formality of paying for them.
The Mission police have time and again
arrested some members of the club for
various offenses, but as a rule they beat
the cane when it comes into court by the
influence of the "push." or still hotter,
one member wil! swoar for his compan
ions with such good effect as to make the
police officer blush with shame for ar
resting an "innocent boy." The several
robberies and burglaries committed in
the Mission are charged to the members
of this club, who range all the way from
12 1 - â  years of age.
During the past month the Mission po
lice have arrested thirty-six of the club
membt-rs. This has had a good effect in
breaking up the membership of tho "Roo
Club," but yet there are some left
who are a gr<-at annoyance to the resi
dents of tho Mission.
Flagpole Wanted.
The Street Committee of the Supervis

was ripe to combine and compel the
piece workers to come to their terms.
The situation developed into a case of
dog-oat-iing. as the operators, following
the example of their Caucasian brethren,
organized to fight the trust of bosses and
walked out of the sweat shops, devoting
their time to surveying pavements and
consuming gin. It was a condition of
trust and no pants or no trust and plenty
of pants and the employers, after suffer
ing much sanguinary perspiration, con-
Cluded they had come in contact with an
underrated formation and' retreated from
their position. As a consequence the Im-
pending dearth of Inexpensive trousers
has been avoided and they will continue
to be In the market at the same old com
fortable figures. This historical event
will be celebrated by the return of the
pants makers to their labors to-day, *h*
same being the Celestial holiday known
as "The Fifth Day of the Fifth Moon "
According to the statement of the
leaders of the walkout the old-time war
horse of the sandlot shares the honors
with "Colonel" Bryan in saving the
humble citizen from the imminent and j
direful dearth of pants. i
From the Chinese Consulate to the bar
bershop with no headrests they all knew
of the crisis, but, like the old Tweed ring,
each referred to the other fellow for par- j
ticulars. The Vice-Consul recognized
the fact that there was trouble among
the pants makers, but his mind was fully
occupied with the "fifth moon" and the
fifth day thereof. The Six Company
magnate inferentially suggested that that
proposition could be made "for two" and
that a live policeman was around the
corner.
The policeman wore contract pants of a
costly quality and cared not a yen
whether his friends In the lower walks or
life wore pants or not. After getting the
left thumb all through Chinatown the
cold facts of the evil movement were
located, but it was only through the
fraternity of journalism that the victory
was achieved. Mr. Boon, the publisher

to exhibit shortly after she became
wealthy through the death of her hus
band, which occurred several years
ago. When Brunings died he left his
widow a large estate, consisting of
property in this city and Germany. She
rented apartments at 831 Howard
street, and in a s\ort time, whether due
to grief over her husband's death or
bewildered by her riches, she began to
act strangely. Her neighbors carefully
avoided her, as her hallucinations were
becoming more weird as the months
passed. Finally her deranged mind
fancied that a grand conspiracy to rob
her had been concocted by the entire
community. She finally moved and
took up her residence at the Occidental
Hotel.
Not many months passed before her
eccentricities caused her arrest and
commitment to the Stockton asylum,
where she is now confined. During her
stay at the Occidental she received $10,
700 from her husband's estate and im
mediately placed it in bank to the
credit of her stepdaughter. Since the
commitment of Mrs. Brunings to the
'asylum Mrs. Townsend has come for
ward as a claimant to the property and
is opposed by E. Myron Wolf, Mrs.
Brunings' guardian, who avers that
his ward was insane when she made
the deposit.
When the case was heard yesterday
Mrs. Hall was called upon to testify.
She stated that she had known Mrs.
Brunings since 1883 a:;d that unques
tionably she had delusions. Once she
decided that the devil was in her hair
and in order to rid herself of the evil
had her tresses cut off. She sent photos
of her discarded hair to friends in the
E;ist and explained her reasons for hav
ing had it cut.
Annie Lynch corroborated the testi
mony of Mrs. Hall, and added that
Mrs. Brunings imagined that mur
derers were plotting against hor. ?he
also had a delusion respecting the mur
der of a child, while in fact the child
was only a creation of her fancy.
Myron Pixley. brother of Mrs. Brun
ings, stated that he had not seen hla
sister for years, but she was not right
in her mind when he saw her last.
R'rs. Townsend next took the stan-3
and told her story. She said that her
mother spoke to her about having re
ceived the money in question and sad
sho wished to make her a present of it.
The witness accompanied her mother
tJ the Savings Union and there de
posited the money. Mrs. Townseni
nor of "Waverley place and some other
plnce, relieved the strain on the pants
question as follows:
"Yeh," said he; "all Chinamen what
make cheap piece pants go on strike. One
day they hear about China bosses make
trust all same Mellican man and pay not
so much for pants. All same, we heap
safie Mister Blyan, and one man he say,
â¢Wassa malla Dennis Kearney, big man,
all same Clevelan?' He plenty Babe makee
stlike.'
"Tlee men go see Kleaney. He say,
"Darn the Chinee'; he get led in the face
and spit all same soap water; lie heap
talk all same fight. Then we go to boss
Chlnamans and say, 'Wo have plenty
tlust, too. and no makee pants some more.
We fight alle same Dennis Kleaneyâ we
no workee.' Alle same boss he get heap
fliten and say 'Alle lite, you make pama
alle same old Dliee.'
"S"pose you hear heap fi rlacka to
nights, fi hunded Chinaman make celcbla
tion all same Mr. Kleaney."
By these foregoing presents the man
with the poorly nourished purse and badly
conditioned pants can dumber peacefully
to-night In the knowledge that his "ftftv"
cent dollar" is still exchangeable for this
particular garment as there will be no
Immediate dearth oÂ£ pants to suit him
self or his income.
stated that Mrs. Brunfnga was saÂ»:e
and competent at the time she made
the deposit, and in consequence the
gift was valid. Judge Cook will de
cide the case in a few days.

lect. Adelaide Clay was granted a di

Proposed Legislation for the Proper
Inspection of Sailing Vessels
Carrying Passengers.
WASHINGTON, June 22.â Senator Per
kins and other members of the California
delegation received a long telegram to
day from Mayor Phelan and the Board of
Supervisors of San Francisco urging the
passage of a bill in accordance with a
resolution passed by the Supervisors on
June 20 favoring "legislation that will
have the effect of imposing suitable con
ditions and proper inspection of all sail
ing vessels which may propose to furnish
accommodations for or solicit passenger
traffic."
Senator Perkins exports that a bill pro
viding for a rigid inspection of sailing ves
sels will be reported favorably from the
commerce committee and passed by the
Senate. Representative Loud, however,
has a different plan. He says that the
bill already passed by the Senate pro
viding for the inspection of all sailing ves
sels of over 700 tons is now before the
Committee on Commerce of the House
;m<l that Representative Payne of New
York, chairman of the House committee,
will at his suggestion amend it by inter
polating- the words "all sailing vessels
carrying passengers." Loud believes this
bill will pa-ss the House and will be satis
factory to the San Francisco petitioners.
Senator Perkins to-day called up ana
the Senate passed the resolution making
immediately available $48,000 for the im
provement of the San Joaquir. River and
Stockton and Mormon channels. By rea
son of the drouth in California this im
provement was absolutely necessary. It
was recommended by Chief of Engineers
Wilson.

Yale, Harvard and Cornell Boat
Crews Will Contest To-Day.
NEW LONDON, Conn., June 22.â A
more unsatisfactory day in the annals
of boat racing on the Thames has never
been recorded than that which the three
university crews and the thousands of
would-be spectators experienced to-day.
Three times the referee attempted to
start the race and each time the weather
conditions prevented, until at last, just
before sunset, after the rain had fallen
in torrents all day, Mr. Meikethara was
obliged to put it over until to-morrow
at half-past 12.
There is but little prospect that there
will be anywhere near the crowd to
morrow that there was to-day, although
thousands have stayed over, and the city
is crowded to-night.
