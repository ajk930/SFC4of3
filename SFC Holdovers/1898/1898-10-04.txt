LONDON. Oct. 4.â The Peking
correspondent of the Daily
Chronicle, telegraphing Satur
day via Shanghai, says: A mob
i? menacing foreigners. The wife
of the Italian; Minister whs at
tacked yesterday while on her
way to church, and several
Americans coming from the rail
way were wounded by stones.
The foreign Ministers have sent
a collective note to the Govern
ment asking for the suppression
of these outrages and the pun
ishment of the culprits.
Social Disnatrh to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.-The
Department has re
ceived the following cable
gram from Minister Conger,
at Peking::
"There is ao Berious danger yet, but
considerable anxiety for the future. The
t OT elgi - assembling at Tientsin.
Ie Ministers are ordering ma-
PeWng for legation guard."
retaxy Long, upon advices re
ceived at the State Department showing
the existence of threatening conditions
in China, has ordered Admiral Dewey
to send two warships Immediately from
Manila to a point as near the Chinese
caplUJ as it is possible for a warship
to approach. The vessels selected for
this undertaking are the Baltimore and
Petrel. It is expected that the Balti
more will not : able to get beyond the
Taku forts at the entrance â  f Peiho
hioh Is situated.
â  -i :.â  tug "i" smaller propor
tions, may be able to rÂ«>ach Tientsin,
eighteen miles above the mouth and
about the same distance below Peking.
The officials regret that there is not
now on the Asiatic squadron a light
draught gunbi at of the Helena class,
which could ascend the river as far as
the t'hinese capital.
Secretary Long said that the sole
purpose of ordering the Baltimore and
: to Tientsia was to safeguard
American interests and protect life and
property of American citizens in the
lUtbreak in the interior,
Tientsin being the nearest point to
Pekis ; accessible to warship?.
NE STORK. Oct. 3.â A Washington
ppecial to c Herald says: It was In
I llance with the official request of
r ;hat instructions have
Lear Admiral Dewey di
recting that the cruiser Baltimore and
gunb >rdered to Tientsin.
The authorii â â â¢ anxious
about the si uati.-n in China than they
are willing mife The Baltimore
will probably take Btatlon at Taku,
where the Itish and Russian fleets
are lying, and the Petrel, which will be
able to cross the Taku har, will con
tinue to Tientsin, where she will go
into th-- mud ock for the winter. It
would not be surprising when the aux
iliary cruiser i:uffal'Â» starts for Manila
if she were accompanied by several
light gunboata such as the Helena and
Wilmington, which are especially built
for Chinese service. The Bennington,
wh:< â ;; te at Honolulu, may also be sent
to Manila to replace the Petrel.
Rear Admiral Dewey has informed
the State Department of the necessity
of having several light-draft vessels
for service among the Philippines, and
In sending boats to China the depart
ment would not only meet his desires
but would have sufficient force to pro
tect American missionaries and official
representatives in China.
The dispatch of the Baltimore to Ta
ku is regarded as significant of the in
tention of this Government to show
that the United States is deeply inter
ested In th- fate of China and proposes
to take action for the protection of its
interest.-.
LONDON, Oct. 3.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai pays that telegrams
from Peking have been detained two
days. The last telegram received, ac
cording to this dispatch, announces
that the foreign Ministers had held an
emergency meeting. The German war
ship at Kiaochau, it alao stated, had
" started hurriedly for Taku the day be
fore. Marquis Ito, who, it is under
stood, is visiting China for the purpose
of arranging an offensive and defensive
alliance between China and Japan, has
left Tientsin for Shanghai, owing to
the impossibility of prosecuting nego
tiate ms during the crisis. The foreign
Ministers, it is stated, forbid any for
eign residents going to Peking, it is
expected that Sir Claude Macdonald,
the British Minister, will surrender
Kang Yuwei.

SENATOR QUAY ARRESTED ON
A CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY
Accused of Securing Pub
lic Moneys for His
Own Use.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. S.âWar
rants were issued to-day for the
arrest of United States Senator
M. S. Quay, his son, Richard S.
Quay, ex-State Treasurer Benja
min Haywood and Charles H. McKee
of Pittsburg, law partner of Lieutenant
Governor Lyon. They are accused of
conspiracy with John S. Hopkins, for
merly < ishier of the People's Bank, to
use puoiic moneys for their own use.
Hopkins killed himself last March
shortly before the bank's failure.
Senator Quay and his son came up
from Atlantic City as Boon as they
heard of their Intended arrest. They
promptly surrendered themselves, and
Magistrate Jermon held them in $5000
bail each for a hearing at noon next
Thursday. David H. Lane, the Repub
lican leader, became their bondsman,
and this afternoon they returned to the
seashore. By advice of their attorney
they declined to discuss the case. They
will come back to the city on Wednes
day so as to be In full time for the
hearing. Mr. Haywood 1b in Nebraska
and Mr. McKee in New York.
United States Senator Penrose. who
was with his colleague this afternoon,
spoke freely after the latter's depart
ure for Atlantic City.
"I presume Senator Quay will not
make any statement at this juncture,"
said he, "regarding th\p last dastardly
attack of his enemies, though he will
doubtless at the proper time. There is,
however, no reason why I, as his col
league and personal friend, should be
silent.
"Attempted assassination of charac
ter has been almost the sole weapon of
attack employed by Senator Quay's op
ponents for several years and the
methods pursued have been augmented
in vickusness and vindlctiveness as
their futility has been demonstrated.
As the last despairing effort of un
scrupulous conspirators comes this
brutal move of the opposition, which
they have had upon their programme
for weeks, with a desperate hope that it
might, in ie way, aid in the election
of a Democratic Legislature. The peo
ple of Pennsylvania are, above all
thing* else, fair and Just and they can

be trusted to see through the sinister
motives animating the small coterie of
disgruntled, defeated politicians who
are responsible for the sensational re
sort to the courts.
"In due time there will be a complete
exposition of the true inwardness of
this latest act in the drama of char
acter assassination, now so conspicuous
a feature in Pennsylvania politics."
The warrants were made out on Sat
urday by Magistrate Jermon at the in
stance of District Attorney Graham and
on the affidavit of Charles F. Myers of
the District Attorney's office. Mr.
Myers is a detective and acted on in-
CHANGES AGAINST QUOY ET OL.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 3.â The affidavit on which the warrants for the arrest of the Quays,
Haywood and McKee were issued is as follows:
"State of Pennsylvania, Oity and County of Philadelphia, ss.: Charles I\ Myers, being sworn
according to law, doth depose and say that Matthew Stanley Quay, Benjamin J. Haywood, Richard R.
Quay and Charles H. McKee, and other persons, to this deponent unknown, did unlawfully combine,
confederate, conspire and agree to and with each other and tne said persons unknown to use the pub
lic moneys of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania for their own use, and also did combine, confeder

tion duly created and existing under the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to unlawfully buy
and sell stocks â that is, shares of stock in divers corporations, and did unlawfully use and employ the
moneys of the People's Bank, within the county of Philadelphia and within two years last past.

formation furnished by Thomas W.
Barlow, receiver of the People's Bank.
District Attorney Graham said that
upon the evidence in the shape of let
ters and papers furnished to him he
believed it his duty to begin proceed
ings. He added:
"I propose to have a hearing as
quickly as possible and to produce at
that hearing all the facts necessary to
a binding over. Some of the facts will
be reserved until the time of the triaJ.
If the state of affairs as represented to
me is true it ought to be exposed. This

rottenness oufht to be shown up, no
matter upon whom it reflects. It is not
my practice to speak in advance of the
trial of cases and I will say nothing
further as to its merits."
Graham expressed ft firm determina
tion to proceed vigorously.
James H. McManes, formerly presi
dent of the defunct People's Bank, said
that he had known the warrants were
to be issued, although he had nothing
to do with the action. He asserted ig-.
norance of any transactions justifying
it. Mr. McManes added:
Friends Say It Is a Scheme
of Democrats to Assas
sinate Character.
"Senator Quay and his son, Richard,
both had their personal notes discount
ed at the bank, the last of which ma
tured after the bank had closed its
doors. These notes were all promptly
paid when due and neither Mr. Quay
nor his son is indebted to the bank one
dollar that I know of."
The news struck political circles of
all shades of faith like a thunderbolt,
and a -ariety of explanations were
given and discussed throughout the
day. Secretary of the Commonwealth
David Martin said he knew nothing be
yond the newspaper statements. The
affair acquires additional significance
from the fact that it comes in the
midst of one of the most .bitter cam
paigns ever foug-ht between Quay and
his opponents, involving the question of
his re-election to the Senate.
The People's Bank suspended busi
ness on March 24 last, and it presently
developed that Cashier Hopkins had
committed suicide. At this time the
State had deposited In the bank $505,
000 and the city $52,000, but the Institu
tion was insolvent.
President McManes agreed to make
good the amount of liabilities and most
of it has been since paid.
EX-TREASURERHAYWCOD
IS UNDER ARREST
OMAHA, Oct. 3.â Benjamin F. Hay
wood of Harrisburg, Pa., cashier for
the State Treasurer of Pennsylvania,
is under arrest at the Paxton Hotel in
this city. He is in the custody of a de
tective and will be sent back to Phila
delphia in care of an officer. The ar
rest was made at the hotel by Chief of
Police Martin White, at the instance of
State's Attorney Graham of Philadel
phia. Mr. Haywood had seen the even
ing papers and expressed no surprise.
He expressed his entire willingness to
go back to Pennsylvania, either alone
or with an officer. Mr. Haywood is ac
companied by his wife and had been at
the Paxton Hotel for several days.
Hay wood says he and Quay were warm
friends, but had nothing in common
with the bank. They had never used
the funds for speculative or other pur
poses and he knew nothing of the al
leged Doodling.
"I had $506,000 of State funds in the
bank when It closed. Since then every
dollar of it has been paid in, the last
hundred thousand having been paid
since I left home on a monthly^yaca
tion September 3. Quay owed the bank
$15,000 when it closed, but he paid it a
little later. The indebtedness was in
the form of a note and he told me it
was for an ordinary business transac
tion. This is all I know of the matter.
I was not an official of the bank, and
cannot understand why I should be ar
rested. I am much surprised and am
ready to go on demand. Still, if the
police do not send for me I will not
start home before Friday, as that was
my plan before I heard this news. I
was at Omaha until last week and
came here to visit my brother-in-law,
and not to escape the law, as I then
had no idea of being arrested."

PEACE COMMISSIONERS' WORK
IT IS REPORTED THAT MUCH
PROGRESS IS MADE.
Already Uncle Sam's Representativi
Have Made Propositions That
Have Staggered the Men
from Madrid.
8pÂ«c1al Dispatch to The C*U.
MADRID, Oct. 3.â The reported
intention of the United States
Government to retain the whole
of the Philippine Islands has
created almost a state of stupe
faction here, and it is semi-omciully an
nounced that the Spanish Government
has resolved to vigorously combat any
action which, it is claimed, the terms
of the peace protocol preclude.
PARIS, Oct. 3.â The American Com
missioners held a meeting this room
ing at their own offices, preparatory to
the second meeting with the Spanish
Commissioners, which began at the
Commissioners' rooms in the F\>Â» ;ign
Office at 2 this afternoon. The plan
of work directed to be prepared by the
secretaries has not been perfected, aa
the secretary of the Spanish commis
sion did not arrive here until to-day.
To-day's session lasted until 4 o'clock,
at which hour the Commissioners ad
journed to meet at 2 o'clock next Fri
day afternoon, such interval, it is
claimed, being desirable and necessary
to allow separate consideration by each
commission of matters requiring suci
course before the joint commission
meets. The interval will be thus filled
with work by each commission, the ul
timate results being so facilitated.
The interval will also be employed by
the secretaries jointly in maturing
plans for the work and procedure.
While the Commissioners were at
luncheon to-day General Merritt, who
arrived here to-day, called at their ho
tel, but did not wait to see them. He
| will call again to-morrow morning to
meet the members of the commission.
The Spanish and American Cummts-
I sinners will be received to-morrow by
President Faure. The hour fixed for
the reception of the Americans is 4:15
in the afternoon. General Merritt will
accompany the Americans to this func
tion, which will be held at the Palais
d'Elysee.
The opinion is now held that the work
of the commission may be finished
within a month from the present time.
While it is the general impression
that to-day's meeting was again de
voted to preliminaries and that the ad
journment to Friday was taken only to
enable the secretaries to draw up a
schedule of work, the representative of
the Associated Press learns that the
session was highly important and that
the Americans have made a demand of
such character that the Spaniards find
it necessary to ask for an adjournment
in order to enable them to consult with
the Government at Madrid.
It is believed that the question con
cerns the Philippines, and it is known
that the Americans are highly pleased
at having so soon reached what they
consider a very important phase of the
negotiations and consider the two ses
sions thus far held as very satisfactory
to America. *She fact that a member
of the commission expressed the belief
that work would be completed within
a month indicates a happy frame of
mind.
In the Spanish camp great hopes are
built on what they believe General Mer
ritt will advise, namely, that the Fili
pinos are incapable of self-government
and that the whole situation does not
warrant America in taking the respon
sibility for the entire Philippines. The
Spaniards are quite ready to give what
ever America asks in the way of coal
ing stations, but will resist more to th*>
verge of a renewal of hostilities.
SPAIN CONTINUES TO
SPAR FOR TIME
But American Commissioners Insist
on Immediate Evacuation
of Cuba.
HAVANA. Oct. 3.â General Clous this
afternoon delivered to Senor Giranta the
American replies to the Spanish proposi
tion received yesterday. The Spanish re
ply advocated their original date, April 1,
as the end of evacuation, stating that
many physical difficulties stood in the way
of an earlier date. The American reply
says that the immediate evacuation of
Cuba is a part of the sacred contract be-i
tween the two Governments. The ob
stacles now cited were known then and
are not new. The agreement must be
kept.
The second communication taken by
Gen. Clous asked for the immediate modifi
cation or abrogation of the reconcentra
tion orders to permit Cubans to return to
work.
It is probable that both matters will be
discussed at the joint session which will
be held on Tuesday morninp. Matters are
likely to reach a crisis in the joint session
resulting either in a long step forward
or a Spanish appeal to Madrid.

loss at half a million dollars. In the real- :
deuce section of the city the water was ,
from two to eight feet deep. There was ;
a full Bweep of wind and water from the i

TURKEY WILL BE
BROUGHT TO TIME
Decision Reached by the
President.
CLAIMS MUST BE SETTLED
FURTHER DELAY WILL NOT BE
PERMITTED.
Instructions to Be Sent to United
States Minister Straus Will
Be Very Peremptoi^
in Tone.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Turkey is to be called upon to
indemnify American missionaries for
damages sustained by their persons
and property as a result of riots during
the past three years. This is the de
cision ot the President after a careful
consideration of the matter with Secre
tary Hay.
The Turkish Government would pay
none of the claims filed against it by
foreign governments for injuries sus
tained by their citizens during the riots
which occurred in Armenia, and when
pressed for a specific answer by Dr.
Angell, disavowed its liability on the
ground that every effort had been made
by Turkish officials to protect life and
property. The reply was of such char
acter as to strongly indicate that the
Porte had no intention of satisfying the
claims, because it did not consider them
just.
Secretary Hay while on the way to
the I'nited States from England, dis
cussed the justice of the claims with
Dr. Angell', who had just returned from
the duties of Minister at Constantino
ple. Secretary Hay also had a confer
ence with Minister Straus, who suc
ceeded Dr. Angell. immediately upon
his arrival in Washington. He dis
cussed the claims with the President
and it was concluded that Turkey was
liable for damages.
"The issue 'has come," said an ad
ministration official with whom I
talked. "Turkey has disavowed liabil
ity Cor damages sustained by American
citizens. The United States holds that
the Porte is directly responsible on the
grounds that its officials connived at or
permitted outrages which are said to
have injured Americans and American
property. It will now depend upon the
President and Cabinet to determine
what shall be done to enforce the de
mand."
I learned this afternoon that an in
struction is being prepared at the State
Department at the instance of the Sec
retary which will be sent to Minister
Straus at once, and which will require
Turkey to make some settlement or at
least submit a proposition having ulti
mate settlement in view. It is not
known whether the President would go
as far as the last administration did in
preparing plans for making a naval
demonstration in Turkish waters.
The President, however, feels that the
matter is one which cannot be post
poned much longer and the instructions
which will be sent to Minister Straits
will be very peremptory in tone.
PATTERNED AFTER THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Proposed Form of Government for
Hawaii That Meets ./ith
Much Favor.
CHICAGO, Oct. 3.â A Daily News Wash
ington special says; Hawaii is to have a
government patterned after that of the
District of Columbia, if reports are true.
The system here was devised by Senator
W. P. White of Maryland and is satisfac
tory to a majority of the residents of
Washington, In spite of the agitation for
"home rule" on the part of a minority
here. The general Government assumes
one-half of the taxes.
The District of Columbia is the ward of
the Government, just as the Hawaiian
Islands now are, so the proposition to
govern the recently annexed dependency
in a similar manner nn"ts with much
favor, and the prospect is it will receive
the sanction of Congress. The establish
ment of this system for the Hawaiian Isl
ands will avoid all the embarrassments
and complications which it Is feared
would result from a territorial form of
fovernment including even a modified suf
ragre.
M'BRIDE NO MATCH
FOR TOMMY WHITE
NEW YORK, Oct. 3,â Tommy White of
Chicago and Danny McÃrlde of New York
met to-night at the Greater New York
Athletic Club for a twenty-five round bout I
to decide the 126-pound championship, but j
the light lasted a little less than one- |
fourth of the intended distance, White j
being the winner by long odds.
White's reach was a big advantage to j
him, and from the first round It was ap- I
parent that he would get all the money. \
McÃride was game to the core, but he j
was outclassed. In the sixth round Me- I
Bride was sent to the floor three times in |
quick succession with heavy right swings !
on the jaw, and the referee mercifully ;
stopped the bout then and there. In order j
to prevent Danny's being knocked out and j
probably seriously injured.

THE FIFTEENTH
Says He Is ComiQg to Sao F ran "
Cisco, Where b\e Is Assured
of pair Play.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â James J. Corbett was seen to-day and said
in unmistakable terms that he would not meet "Kid" McCoy on Oc
tober 15. The tenor of his conversation was that he was highly dis
gruntled over the treatment he received at the hands of those from
whom he should have been able to expect better things. He ex
pressed it as his intention to quit and make a trip to San Francisco,
where he would be able to get fair play.
In addition to Corbett's statement that he would not meet Mc-
Coy, he volunteered to advise the public that it had better not pa
tronize the advertised contest, for It would be disappointed. He said
that those who attended the affair would not see a fight.
'Why should this 'Kid' dictate to me?" said the ex-champion. "I
have been on top for years and now McCoy steps forth and attempts
to force me into doing as he proposes. It is ridiculous."

Judge Maguire Speaks
at Madera.
ASSAILS GENERAL BARNES
MAKES NO REPLY TO MR. GAGE'S
ARGUMENTS.
Attempts to Explain His Action in
Opposing the Providing of
Revenues to Defray
War Expenses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADERA, Oct. 3.â James G. Maguire
arrived here on the 4:30 train from
San Francisco this evening and deliv
| ered a campaign speech to an enthusi
! asiic audience at Athletic Hall. His
arrival at the depot was greeted by the
firing of an artillery salute and
cheers for the "Little Giant." A com
mittee of Democrats, Populists and
! Silver Republicans was on hand to wel
come him and escort him to his quar
j ters at the Yosemite Hotel, where many
! of the war horses of the three parties
had gathered to grasp the hand of the
single taxer. After dinner the reception
was renewed in the hotel parlors.
The notes from the Madera brass
band were the signal later in the even
ing for the gathering of a crowd at the
hall where the speaking took place.
The audience was composed of all
classes and parties. Judge W. M. Con
ley acted as chairman of the meeting,
and introduced Judge Maguire.
Mr. Maguire was listened to atten
tively while he spoke at length on the
leading issues of the campaign. He
refrained from referring to his esteem
ed opponent, but arraigned General
Barnes as the ablest attorney of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company
and accused him of having written and
delivered the address containing the
keynote of the Republican party in
this campaign. He denied that the late
war was a Republican war â neither
was it Democratic, Populist nor Silver
Republican war, but an American war.
Aftt-r speaking briefly on the general
principles for which the fusion ticket
stands, he spoke at great length on the
Pacific Railroad question, much of
which was too deep for the audience.
He explained the reason for Demo
cratic opposition in Congress to the
war revenue measures, saying that
they were resisted only when they
were colored with partisan or special
rights, and that the war tax was an
unjust tax because three-fourths of the
burden fell to the lot of the poor man
and not to the rich, where It belonged.
The candidate spoke two -and a half
hours, at the close of which a general
handshaking was participated In by
those of the audience who desired to
meet the Judgp.

A LOGGING CAMP.
The summer logging camp ordinarily
Is not a picturesque place. It Is built
beside the railroad, in order that sup
plies need not be carried far by hand
or by "dray," and whatever beauty it
has is gained from its environment of
heavy forest. The various buildings,
<>r "shanties." as they are always
called, are clustered in a compact little
village. Nearest the railway â it may
be â is the "cook's shanty"; next it, per
haps, is the "men's shanty," or sleeping
quarters of the crew; near them, again,
is the office, where the camp accounts
are kept and where the foreman and
sealer sleep. The barn, or "hovel," is
at the end of the camp, with the gran
ary beside it. The blacksmith's shop
and the workbench of the "handy man"
are near by. The "root cellar," which Is
both pantry and cold storage room, is
built whore the cook and his assistants
have ready access to it.
The cook's shanty is the dining-room
aB well as kitchen, while the office is
also a storehouse, from which the tim
ber-jacks can obtain tobacco and such
principal articles of clothing as they
may need. All the chief buildings are
long and low, made of rough boards or
lops, and roofed with sheeting and tar
paper. The sleeping bunks in the men's
shanty are built along the sides of the
cabtn In a tier two deep; this shanty is
the loggers' rendezvous c-n cold even
ings, and in it the smell of strong to
bacco smoke constantly lingers. Such
is a summer logaring camp, and, rough
and crude as it may seem, it is no bad
homo for men toughened by hard out
door labor. â Lippincott's Magazine.

LUXURY IN SIBERTA.
The new Siberian train which was re
cently sent to St. Petersburg for the ap- j
proval of M Khllkow, Minister of Ways
and Communications, returned yesterday j
to Moscow, after being personally in
spected by the Czar. This is the second j
train specially built for the quick service j
on the Great Siberian Railway. It is.
says the Moscow correspondent of the I
Standard, an improvement on the first :
specially built train, which was a marvel
to Russians. The new train consists of !
five coaches, two for second class and \
one for first class passengers; the others i
are a dining and a baggage car. The
construction is of the newest design, and !
the train runs with great smoothness.
Besides the comforts of a bathroom, with
gymnastic apparatus, a library of books j
in several languages, a piano and selec- i
tlon of music, maps, guide books, albums
of views, an ice cellar, and an arrange
ment for boiling water in three minutes ;
by means of steam, which were found on |
the first train, the new one is fitted with ;
plates which indicate the next stopping !
station, and, if the stoppage be over five i
! minutes, also how long the train stops.
All the windows are protected from the
dust and wind by external plate-glass
guards; the last coach is arranged to \
serve as an "observation car," showing |
three views of the country traversed. A ;
stationary bicycle, with arrangements
for measuring "in minutes and kilometers j
the amount of work done; a barber, who I
is qualified to give medical assistance.
and a superintendent who speaks Rus- j
slan. French. German and English, are i
among the other conveniences to comfort j
of traveling now provided. The train will j
be lighted inside and out by electricity, I
and electric cigar lighters find a place In I
the dining car. A laboratory has been j
fitted in the second class car, so as to be |
vailable for the enthusiastic photo- i
grapher to change plates and develop in '
during the journey. Electric bells and J
portable electric reading lamps are in â 
each compartment. The kitchen is in- '
; tended to furnish a hot dinner for a max- ;
, imiim of sixty people. Papor and envel- j
I opes are to be supplied gratis at the buf
! fet. where hot find cold drinks of all
! kinds are to be had; there is no charge
for the barber, but two rubles is the
price for a bath, for which three hours'
I notice beforehand must be given.
NEWFOUNDLAND'S NEW STAMPS.
The Princess of Wales has had a sin
gular distinction paid her by England's
: oldest colony. On the first day of this
! month Newfoundland issued a new three
i cent stamp, which bears the effigy of her
i Royal Highness. Messrs. Whitfield, King
j & Co.. the well-known importers of
stamps, Ipswich, obligingly sent us a
specimen of it. The likeness is unmis
takable, and as it is the first time the
Princess of Wales has been portrayed on
a postage stamp, every collector in the
I British Empire must secure this addi
tion for his album. It is tho third of a
series of royal portraits to appear on the
stamps of Newfoundland. The first two,
the one cent stamp with her Majesty's
portrait, and the two cent stamp with
that of the Prince of Wales, were issued
in November last. The next wili be a
half-cent stamp with Prince Edward of
York, and about the end of this year or
the beginning of next a five cent stamp
will appear with the Duke of York's'
portraft. âLondon Chronicle.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 3.â 1
learn on good authority that General
Calixto Garcia has accepted a position
with the American administration, as
I predicted in my dispatches last Fri
day.
General Garcia is to receive $500 a
month and all expenses. He will act as
commissioner to go through the coun
try and conduct negotiations with the
Cuban army with a view to its dis
banding. He will start in a few days,
and will be gone on his trip three or
four weeks. He will be accompanied by
his son, Colonel Carlos Garcia, and by a
few of his officers. On his return he will
go to the United States with General
Wood to confer with the authorities in
Washington.
In consequence of serious disorders,
due to insurgents In the vicinity at
Manzanillo, General Lawton is dis
patching thither the steamer Reina de
Los Angeles, with one battalion of four
companies from the Third Immunes
under Colonel Ray. General Wood had
planned to sail with General Castillo
to-morrow on a mission of organization
to the coast towns, but now he will
probably go with Colonel Ray and the
First Battalion of Immunes, postponing
his trip along the coast. He, will make
an inquiry into the charges against Cu
bans and endeavor to relieve the deli
cate situation at Manzanillo.
Cubans, as I have already cabled,
have plundered sugar estates and have
committed such depredations that it be
came necessary for the planters to ap
peal to General Lawton for protection.
Colonel Ray's instructions are to deal
with the offenders with the utmost se
verity, putting down lawlessness with
a firm hand. He has full power to act
in a summary manner and to order that
the death penalty be meted out for
theft or attempted violence.
A PARADISE FOR WAITERS.
This question has just been decided ir
the affirmative by the higher court at Vi
enna, which not only confirmed the judg
ment of the lower court in a curious ac
tion referred to it, but also asserted the
right of a hotel servant to retain passen
gers' luggage in case a sufficient gratuity
is not forthcoming.
The suit, which proved again the 'law's
delay." arose out of a dispute, in August
Of 1896, between a gentleman who had
passed a considerable time at a summer
resort and a hotel porter. A Mr. D., who,
with his family, had stayed for thirty
eight days at the hotel, presented the ser
vant who brought the luggage to the sta
tion with a pourboire of b florins, about 10
shillings. This the man emphatically de
rlini-d to accept, demanding instead 10
florins. On the departing guest declining
to give that amount, the servant refused
to part with the visitor's luggage, which,
after a scuffle, he carried back to the ho
tel and deposited with the manager. Mr.
D. then brought, through the Public Pros
ecutor, a charge of extortion against the
servant, accompanied with threats and
injury to property.
The lower court acquitted the servant
on all the counts when the case was
brought before it in March, 1897. Then the
suit was carried to the higher court,
which confirmed the previous decision.
The charges of threats and injury to
property the court considered unproved,
and declared that the servant, who re
ceived no wages, was thrown for his sub
sistence upon the generosity of the visit
ors; that of this Mr. D. was aware; and
that personal service for thirty-eight
days, according to the local usage, at 10
kreuzers a day, amounted to at least 12
florins, to which the man had a legal
claim* and that he was quite within his
rights in retaining the luggage to secure
himself from pecuniary loss.
The custom of feeing everywhere and
everybody is so general in Austria that
the only "surprising part of the affair is
that any one had the courage to resist the
"local usage." Cabmen, conductors, ser
vants, porters, guards, waiters, all expect
gratuities as a right, and this tax is a
considerable drain on a small income in
Austria. The astonished foreigner soon
yields to the inevitable, and regularly
provides himself with a sufficient number
of small coins to ciury him serenely and
comfortably through the day, at the same
time inwardly regretting that Austrian
traditions do not allow all charges in
curred to be entered in the bill.â London
Telegraph.
DEPOPULATION IN FRANCE.
The returns of the census for Frarce
which was taken on March 29, 1897, have
now been published and compared with
the statistics of the previous census,
which was taken six years before â on the
12th of April, 1891. A year ago the number
of people in France was 35.228.969, and at
the 1831 census it was 38,065,150, so that in
the six years the population of France
had only increased by 133.819 persons. And
even this trifling increase is more appar
ent than real, for It has taken place en
tirely in the large towns, and is due to the
Influx of foreigners, such as Belgians and
Italians, who are to be found in increas
ing numbers among the urban populations
of France. In only twenty-four depart
ments is there any increase; in sixty-three
departments there is a positive falling off,
and this is more specially marked In the
rural communee. Even more than in Eng
land does the population flock from the
country to the town, and yet we arc-al
ways hearing of the perfect nature of the
French agrarian laws and of the advan
tages of small holdings. The fact is that
small holdings tend to keep down the
rural population, for the subdivision of
fields has now got to such a pitch that
any family at all often means starvation
to a man and wife. For years past the
French population has? only been kept
from showing an absolute decrease by the
influx of foreign workmen into the great
towns, and yet the French allow the folly
of the Colonial party to drag them into
ridiculous enterprises abroad for the
benefit of a few greedy officials and func
tionaries. A nation with a decreasing
population can never hold colonies, and
the French may rest assured that sooner
or later fheir colonies will go the way of
those possessed by the sister nation,
Spain. â London Globe.

SOCIAL SAN JOSE
GIVEN A SHOCK
Dr. Bennett and V/ife
Separate.
WEDDED BUT FOUR MONTHS
THEIR MARRIAGE CONSIDERED
AN ELOPEMENT.
Soon Find That They Cannot Agree,
and the Young Bride Returns
to the Home of Her
Mother.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 3.â Several months
ago San Jose society was shocked by
an announcement in the papers of the
marriage of Doris Cambers to Dr. A.
G. Bennett, both prominent young peo
ple. These same circles were asain
surprised this morning by an advertise
ment in a morning paper statins that
the doctor would not be responsible for
any debts incurred by his wife, as she
had left his bed and board. Dr. Ben
nett and his wife have been married
ony four months, and the separation,
coming so soon, is causing a great
amount of talk.
Dr. Bennett Is a very popular youns
man. He is a prominent worker in the
First M. E. Church and no small fac
tor in politics. His marriage to Miss
Cambers was rather sensational and in
the nature of an elopement. The young
dentist had been engaged to a Miss
Northup for several years, and their
approaching marriage was known to
every member of their church. When
he returned from a short trip to San
Francisco with Miss Cambers as his
bride the church members were
shocked. Bennett was ostracized, and
for a time his business was boycotted.
This situation was just being smoothed
over when the last surprise came.
Bennett's mother objected to his
marrying, and it is said, never received
her daughter-in-law as a loving mother
should. Besides, both young people
had minds of their own and disagreed
almost from the time of their marriage.
Estrangement soon sprang up which
culminated a few- days ago in the young
wife returning to her mother's home.
It is said the divorce court will now be
resorted to.
HARD TO GET MARRIED IN
FRANCE.
The Temps, which is not always seri
ous, has got two beautiful stories to
illustrate the difficulties of getting
married in France. A gentleman ar
rived with his bride-elect to undergo
the civil ceremony. "Where," asked
the official, "is the certificate of your
father's demise?" "My dear sir," re
plied the bridegroom, "there is my
father, alive and well." "But," re
torted the other, "your mother Is dead,
and she is returned in the lists as a
widow." The bridegroom explained
delicately that his mother had run
away from his father, and preferred to
give herself out for a widow. "But,"
he said, desperately, "my father is cer
tainly alive." "He has no right to bâ¬.
Officially he is dead. I cannot marry
you without a certificate of his de
mise." Hard enough, one thinks. But
the other case is still harder. It hap
pened in Cayenne, where two convicts,
employed as servants by the Governor,
got leave to marry. They went to the
mairie, and the lady was asked if she
was a spinster or a widow. "Widow,"
she said. "Well," said the official, "but
I have not the certificate of your first
husband's death." "Really," said the
bride. "I thought it was not needed."
"Why, it is an indispensable docu
ment." The lady smiled, and referred
him to the record of her conviction.
"You will perceive, sir. that I was sen
tenced for life for having poisoned my
husband!" That would seem to be
sufficient, in all conscience. Yet, as
a matter of fact, their married happi
ness had to be postponed till the acte
de deces could arrive from Paris.â Pall
Mall Gazette.
NEW YORK'S DEAD.
The dead of London require an annual
waste of twenty-three acres of valuable
ground. If 400 corpses are crowded Into
the space of one acre, the limit in the
case of the most populated graveyards,
and if we accept the present rate of mor
tality 20 per 1000 inhabitants, as the
standard. New York, with a population
of 3, 800. 000, would have to provide room
for 70,000 corpses, and would require an
nually seventeen and a half acres to
bury them in. Unless the custom Is
changed the available room in the vi
cinity of all large cities will gradually be
absorbed by the remains of the dead.
In considering the welfare of individ
uals, the expenditure of one may benefit
another, but citizens should be treated
on equal terms. With the one exception
of Greenwood, all cemeteries used tn the
neighborhood of New York are either
poorly managed by churches or admin

THE CUI3AN MACHETE.
Much has been said of the terrible ma
chete, a deadly weapon indeed in toe
hands of desperate men and when iised
against a defenseless person. The machete
was never intended for a weapon of war
fare; it is an instrument of husbandry
carried by the Cuban peasant in time of
peace and is his one familiar daily com
panion It cuts his firewood, aids him
in "building his hut, hews his path
through the maiugua, and performs
many other offices. The machete is a
straight heavy blade about two feet
long with a wooden or bone hand c.
having no guard; consequently it la 1 ut
terly unsuited as a weapon to.be used
in a conflict with an armed man. ih&
Cuban, of course, by reason of his lons
familiarity with the instrument, is _aii
adept in its use. and its effect upon a
group of unarmed workmen is truly ter
rible. It is in the foray against the de
fenseless and unarme.l that the most se
rious work of the machete has been done
in the island of .-The Century.

BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of ThÂ« Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 25.â Interest
concerning the new placer diggings on
Lake Atlin still keeps at a lively heat
both in Skaguay and Juneau. William
p. is a placer miner of much ex
perience and a man in good standing
in Juneau. He has just returned from
Pine and other creeks. I have been
told that what Mr. Nelson says can
be relied on. He said to-day:
"The diggings are not a bonanza so I
far as I was able to see, but they are
good. The gold Is spread over a wide '
range, and there is a large area around i
the head of the lake that has not been
prospected. Reports of new strikes In
that region came down before I left, |
which was about a week ago. A good j
deal of prospecting will be done in that
section next summer, I guess. This
deposit seems to extend a little east
of north, in the direction of Dawson,
and it looks to me as though it might J
be a continuation of the Klondike de
posits. It ranges in the same gen- I
eral direction. I shall be away off in j
my expectations if a whole lot of good
prospects are not discovered next sum
mer. 1 have a claim or . two which
I am satisfied with, and will begin j
working them next spring. There are ;
the dry beds of quite a number of old .
streams, I do not know how many, !
which can be worked with hydraulics
at considerable profit I think. Seve
ral men packed dirt down from the
beds of the dry streams on their backs :
to the creek, sluiced it and made from
a half to an ounce per day. That is
what they told me. One of these, a
man named Atkinson from Skaguay, 1
got much better acquainted with. He
told me then that he made from one j
to two ounces per day. About the way
I size up the district at this time is
that ii is at least a poor man's dig
gings â that is, wages, half an ounce oi- i
better; but it would not surprise me i
to see it go much better than that. No
man can see into the ground. It won't
average less than wages; it may pan ;
out more. It is all summer diggings. |
I saw lots of coarse gold that had been I
taken out, and several good sized nug
gets of mixed gold and quartz. I saw
no quartz in the vicinity where 1 was
that looked very good."
Nelson says there will be a winter
camp at Atlin City and certainly a i
good sized camp or two there next
summer. He has sent men in to win
ter and whipsaw lumber with which to
make sluice boxes next spring.
Winter is beginning to set in. Some
snow has already fallen on the passes.
Fogs are descending, enveloping the
mountains, the water and the face of
the earth nowhere else so completely
as on the Alaskan coast. Soon after
ships will come in on their last trip
from the "westward," and there will
be no further word from Cooks Inlet
Orca, Valdex and Copper River till next
spring.
Miners on the Alsec River number
about one hundred. They Intend to
winter there.
Professor Jeorgeson, sent out by the
Agricultural Department at Washing
ton to prospect the agricultural re
sources of Alaska, is still over at Sitka
on the "westward." He is nicknamed
the "Government hayseed" up here.
Two tracts of land for experimental
purposes have been selected; one of 160
acres at Kodiak and the other eighty
acres at Kenai. I
Police continue to scour the Dalton !
trail for the robbers who held up A !
Frazer and A. L. T.,llner on the night j
of September 15, with revolvers and '
took from them $2400 which they had j
dug up in the Klondike and were tak- !
ing home to Seattle. No clew has been
found beyond tracks in the moss and
mud. Indian scouts have now been
sent out on the trail of the highway
men.
The report of the death of Ike "Mar
tin, a brother of Dave Martin, of Ju
neau, and an old partner of Jack Dal
ton. has not yet been confirmed. He
has been missed vlth about $4000 on
his person for several weeks, and as
he was an experienced man, even his
oldest friends fear they have seen the
last of Ike. Th- only conclusion ar
rived at Is that he may have been shot
for the money. Like Jack Dalton, he
was not a man to be robbed without
a struggle. Frazer and Tollner will
go home as soon as they can. Every
cent they had was taken from them.
The former had spent seven months
working and prospecting: around Daw
son, and Tollner thirteen months The
money was mostly hard-earned wagea
from the mines. â

WORK OF THE WAR
INVESTIGATING BOARD
As the Commission Now Stands Wit
nesses Cannot Be Compelled to
Take the Oath.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.â To-day's ses
sion of the war Investigating committee
was devoted largely to the consideration
of the method of examining witnesses,
and in this connection the question of
administering oaths was discussed at
considerable length. The members gen
erally took the position that under a
strict construction the commission has no
authority to compel a witness to be
sworn by a member of the commission,
but there was a general opinion that the
witnesses would not raise technical ques
tions, and that they in all probability
would submit to be sworn without opposi
tion. It was decided, however, to inform
witnesses frankly of the status of the
board and to afford them an opportunity
to decline in case they so do ired. It was
suggested that the whole difficulty might
be avoided by getting the President to
appoint one of the officers of the board to
the office of notary public.
To Governor Beach was assigned the
task of leading in the examination of wit
nesses but there is an understanding that
the other members of the board shall ask
such duestiona aa they Mjrdgli*
The commission also received several
communications. . , ___
At the afternoon session of the com
mission several complaints were read in
â¢|ard to the method of transporting ,

COMBINATION 1)F
THE SHIPBUILDERS
Gigantic Project to Unite All the
Capital Interested in the
Industry.
CLJEVELAND, Oct. 3.â A prominent pa
per says: "One of the most gigantic pro
tor the combination of capital in
the history of the country is being nego
i tiated in this city. It is nothing less than
i an attempt to organize the warship-build
ing interests and the armor-plate and
gunmakinp Interests of the world into one
great syndicate whose factories shall be
located "near Cleveland. Men of interna
tional reputation in the financial and man
ufacturing world are in the deal.
"Among the Clevelanders who are in the
deal is said to be Colonel Myron T. Her
rlck president of the Society of Savings,
and Robert Wallace, president of the
and Shipbuilding Company. An
drew Carnegie is one of the chief men in
the negotiations. Robert Wallace is now
in the West with several of the foreigners
who visited Cleveland. Before he returns
he will stop at 3an Francisco and the
proprietors .of the Union Iron Works,
which built the battleship Oregon, will
be approached as to whether they will
come into the deal.
"Some time ago Murray A \ erner of
Pittsburg, a promoter who has engineered
many deals for Carnegie, was in Cleve
land" and took up the great project with
local men."
PITTSBURG, Oct. 3.â The gigantic com
bination of warship-building Interests, as
alleged to have been practically consum-
I at Cleveland, is pooh-poohed by
every one here supposed to be connected i
with" the scheme.
MISS CLEMMONS SUES
THE WORLD'S PUBLISHERS
Declares She Is in a Position to
Strike Back at Those Who
Hav-3 Persecuted Her.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â Persistently
hounded year after year by enemies who
hav<- left no means neglected to humiliate,
misrepresent and annoy is the treatment
to which Miss Katherlne flemmons says
Bhe has been subjected, until at last she
has found herself in a position to strike
back. Miss Clemmons, through her at
torneys, Howe & Hummel, to-day caused
papers to be served against the Press
Publishing Company, publishers of the
World, placing her damages at $100,000,
for the publication of an article which she
considered to be of so libel oua and scan
dalous a character that it waa impossible
to permit it to pass unnoticed.
The article complained of stated that
Miss Clemmons was a ward of Colonel
William F. Cody, and had deserted him
in his illness and old age in order to go
on a yachting trip with a well-known
New Yorker, and later coupled her naxne
with that of Howard Gould. I,ater the
World alleged that she was indebted for
her theatrical education to Colonel Cody,
who had fallen desperately in love with
her and desired to marry her, and that
she had basely requited his generosity by
casting him aside while he was lying at
the point of death and going away on a
yachting trip with Mr. Gould.

INSANE JEALOUSY
LEADS TO CRIME
Awful Deed of a De
mented Laborer.
MORTALLY WOUNDS HIS WIFE
SETS FI3E TO HIS CHILDREN'S
BED CLOTHING.
Then He Gashes His Throat With a
Razor and Falls Unconscious
While Once More Search
ing for His Victims.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 3.â One of the
most awful crimes that has shocked
this community since the Weber mur
der took place this morning near Brigh
ton Junction. An insane machinist
employed in the Union Iron Works, a
local foundry, shot his wife, drew his
razor across his throat and set fire to
his children's bed. The deed was the
result of insane jealousy of a wife who
was absolutely above suspicion, who
was a kind neighbor and Christian wo
man.
This morning, when Thomas Harri
son arose from his bed, he went down
stairs and nailed up every window and
door in the house, with the exception
of the front door, which he locked. He
neglected to take the key out of the
lock and it is to this that Mrs. Harri
son owes her escape from immediate
death.
After Harrison had in this manner,
as he thought, precluded all possibility
of escape, he went upstairs and spoke
to his wife. He accused her of infi
delity and she denied it. He dragged
her from the bed and threw her upon
the floor, where she began to struggle
with him.
As she was seemingly getting the
! better of him, Harrison drew a revol
ver and struck: her on the head with
it several times. She continued to
; struggle and he shot her. As she kept
on screaming and struggling he beat
; her and shot her again. Immediately
; after the last shot was fired the ter
.' rorized woman staggered to her feet
i and made her escape from the house.
Harrison, believing that his wife
! could not get out of the house, went
: into his children's bedroom with the ln
: tentlon of killing them, but they had
' been alarmed by their mother's cries
! and had escaped in their nightgowns
and fled to the protection of a neigh
â  bor.
Harrison, upon finding that his child
ren had escaped, set fire to their bed
and went down stairs to find them and
his wife. Finding the front door open
he returned up stairs, lay down qn his
bed and drew a razor across his throat.
No sooner had he done this than a de
sire seized him to find and finish kill
ing his wife. He arose to his feet with
the blood gushing from the ghastly
wound in his neck and went to the sit
ting-room. There weakness seems to
have overtaken him, for he lay for a
moment on the lounge.
Aft^r getting up from the lounge the
i would-be murderer and suicide stag
! gered out of the front door and found
I his way to the barn. He entered this
i and managed to get to a ladder lead
ing into the hay mow. Evidently be
lieving that his wife waa hiding in the
mow he climbed the ladder, leaving
marks of blood to the topmost round,
while in the hay at the mow hole Is a
great clot of blood, where his neck must
' have rested. Not finding his wife in the
: mow Harrison climbed down the ladder
i and managed get to a building back
of the house. It was here that he was
foun- by neighbors, breathing but un
conscious.
Harrison and his wife are resting
easily at the County Hospital to-night,
and It is thought both will recover.

Forest Rangers Are Now Battling to
Save Timber South of the
Yellowstone National
Park.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WICHITA, Kans., Oct. 3.âSev
eral hours before sunset there
began to arrive here, flying low
over the city, an army of count
less nflllions of insects, compris
ing grasshoppers, wasps, bald
hornets, special varieties of but
terflies and numerous wild. bees.
They are drifting slowly with a
light breeze toward the south
east, the lowest flying wasps and
hornets clustering in great num
bers about the spires of the high
est buildings. The air v.as thick
with a smoky haze and the the
ory h< is that the haze and
accompanying insect visitation
are due to the forest fires now
raging in olorado, the insects,
it is supposed, being driven from
their haunts in advance of the
flames. The advance guard be
gan to arrive yesterday, but ow
ing to their comparatively small
numbers no attention was paid
to them until they were noticed
in myriads late this afternoon.
DENVER, Oct. 3.â Reports received
to-day from various points In the re
gions where forest fires have been
! spreading for a week or two past are to
the effect that the fires have been
checked in many places by snow and
rain. In the vicinity of Glenwood
j Springs they are almost extinguished.
Idaho Springs reports that the fires
j on the west slope of the divide are
i pretty nearly under control, and there
I is now not much danger of their reach
| ing the east slope. Hundreds of miles
! of fine timber have been laid waste in
the range of mountains to the west of
Middle Park, and some ranches have
been destroyed.
E. A. Julian, superintendent of the
I United States Fish Hatchery at Lead
â  ville, says that criminal carelessness
\ and inexcusable negligence on the part j
of campers are responsible for nine- j
tenths of the present forest fires. The
town of Kokorao is no longer endan
gered.

GIGANTIC FRAUDS IN
PAVING CONTRACTS
Mayor Van Wyck of New York Be
gins the Prosecution of Men
in the Ring.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â Mayor Van
â Wyck made a statement to-day to the
effect that the Commissioners of Ac
counts had discovered gigantic frauds
!n the asphalt paving contracts. The
Mayor turned ver the papers in the
case to District Attorney Gardiner, who
will prosecute the men charged with
participating: in the frauds.
Thj Mayor's statement, based on a
report of the Commissioners of Ac
counts, ays in part:
"/-phalt contracts, the report says,
have been let a favored few by the
imposition of restrictions in the speci
fications which ;hose outside the as
phalt combine could not overcome. New
York has for three years paid about $1
more a square yard for asphaltum than
that paid by adjacent cities. The comb
ine, it is declared, has been controlled
by one company. That is the Trinidad
Asphalt Company, of which Amzi L
Barber is president, and from which
the other companies have to buy. This
asphalt was made the standard by the
Department of Public Works. Intend
ing bidders were, by the specifications
first compelled to build a plant that
would cost $30,000, but the clause was
enforced only at the will of the com
mlssiorors."

PENITENTIARY NO PLACE
FOR YOUNG OFFENDERS
So the State Prison Directors Decide
in the Case of a Lad at

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Oct. B.â
Never was the awful mistake on the part
of the courts in sending youthful crim
inals to a State penitentiary better illus
trated than at the monthly meeting of
the Board of Prison Directors to-day,
when Chaplain Drahms personally ap
peared and begged that 17-year-old
Charles Kelly be transferred to the lone
Reform School. The boy is a cripple,
and is serving a sentence of seven years
for burglary committed in San Francisco.
"This lad is entirely too young to be
in San Quentin," declared the chaplain.
"I am convinced that he is good at heart,
and, if removed from the contaminating
Influences by which he is now surrounded
and placed where he can learn a trade,
will in time develop into a useful citi
zen. It is a shame that he was ever sent
here."
Warden Hale warmly seconded this
opinion, and the four members of the
board present. Director Devlin being the
absentee, were visibly affected by the ap-
I peal. It was decided that the Warden
j have Attorney General Fitzgerald pre-
I pare the necessary papers of transfer at
I once.
Alton H. Gould, the convict "trusty"
â¢ who recently escaped and was captured,
i pleaded guilty and was deprived of sixty
; seven months' credits. Gould is suffering
from consumption, and his emaciated
; condition makes it doubtful if he will
serve more than a year of his time.
J. G. I^ystrom. the LO3 Angeles cm
i bezzler, and U. S. Osgood, the would-be
j murderer from Trinity County, were pa
roled. W. Magee's petition for a parole
will be granted in December if his con
duct continues good. "Billy" Miner, the
famous stage robber, asked to have re
stored the twenty years' credits taken
I away for having escaped and attempted
I to escape, and will receive an answer at
! the December meeting.
Warden Hale reported 3,039,000 bags on
hand available for sale, and enough jute
jto last until next May. The price has
been reduced to -J^ cents a bag. The bids
for jute were laid over indefinitely, as
several bidders appeared before the
I board ami said the scarcity of vessels
at Calcutta delayed shipments. They said
the price of jute had risen, but that it
was of a better quality than usual.
HENRY GEORGE WILL
NOT BE A CANDIDATE
Befuses to Run for Governor of New
York on the Ticket of Chicago
Platform Men.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â Henry George has
declined the nomination for Governor
on the ticket placed In the field by the
Chicago platform Democrats, and the
commission having authority to fill the
| vacancies nominated Henry M. McDon
[ aid of the county of New York for the
place.
Mr. George In his letter says that by
pursuing uninterruptedly the duty of
writing his father's biography he can do
more for the principles of freedom than
by engaging actively in politics. Mr.
George continues:
"I should say in justice to myself and
those who honestly advance the silver
question to the rank of first importance,
that I am not any more than my father
was an advocate of free coinage. He
condemned its economic soundness, being
in fact a believer neither in gold nor
silvt r. but in credit of paper money. He
supported the Chicago platform not on
account of but in spite of its advocacy
of free silver, because he believed that
in other respects it stood for the princi
ples of freedom; because it took the side
of the weak as against that of monopo
lies; because it sided with the house of
Want against the house of Have. I am
in entire accord with those views, and I
think it proper to state them frankly,
that there may be no room for misunder-
Ing on the part of any one."
Henry M. McDonald, nominated in Mr.
George's stead. Is a lawyer of this city,
and was formerly a banker of Pierre,
S. D. He is president of the New York
Bimetallic Association.
LITTLE DAMAGE BY RAI3T.
Showers of the Past Few Days Have
Not Done Much Harm. *
WOODLAND, Oct. 3.â Heavy showers
on Sunday and Monday mornings have
increased the rainfall for the season to
.99 of an Inch. The only injury resulting
will he to shipping grapes.
NEWCASTLE, Oct. 3.â The rain of the
past few days will have the of
damaging some of the few table grapes
now upon the vines. The bulk of the crop
has already been shipped and the loss will
be light. Small lots of fruits which were
out drying will be injured, but, as in the
case of the grape crop, there is but little
loss. The season hus been a good one.
Crops have been excellent as to bulk and
quality, and the returns average the best
for several years. The pAiducers have
done well and have been able to pay oft
old obligations and cancel many mort
gages.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 3.â The increase
in registration In this county is 6200.
The registration as taken in 1896 will
stand, and voters who were not on
that register have been given an op
portunity to enroll, and those who have
changed their residences have been en
rolled in the precincts into which they
have moved.
It is figured that a full vote will be
cast this year and that the vote of Los
Angeles County will be 31,000. This will
be phenomenal for any but a Presiden
tial year. Of these 31,000 votes, it is
figured, Gage will receive about 17,500
and Maguire about 13,500. This is the
minimum, calculation made on Gage's
vote.
The new registration will give the
Republicans a distinct advantage, as
it is largely confined to Republican dis
tricts in the city. Both Democrats and
Republicans are closely watching the
register and if frauds are or have been
perpetrated the parties to them will be
severely punished. The Republicans
have selected Charles Fleming, a bright
and able young man, to care for their
interests as far as registration frauds
are concerned. The estimate is that
the increased registration, after fraud
ulent registrations have been purged,
will increase the Republican vote of the
county 2500 and the Democratic vote
1000.
It Is believed the Social Labor party
will poll 600 votes in the county and
the Shanahan Populists about 600 more.
The Socialist Labor party candidate
for Governor comes from this county
and he is devoting a lar^e portion of
his time to speechmaking in this sec
tion, confining himself to semi-socialis
tic-anarchistic principles.
Gage is daily gaining strength and
It is difficult for the Populistic combine
to figure where Alaguire is making any
gains. ___________
CAMPAIGN WAGED
BY REFORM FORCES
Santa Clara County's Good Govern
ment Ireague Making a Strong
Fight.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 3.â The Republican
Good Government League has opened its
campaign, and just now its members are
carrying on the most systematic and
thorough ante-election fight ever intro
duced in Santa Clara County. A well at
tended meeting- was held in East San Jose
to-night, addresses being delivered by
Judge J. R. Lewis, E. A. Hayes and oth
ers. To-morrow night there will be a
meeting at Morgan Hill, and on Wednes
day evening one at Mayfield. All the
dates between now and the election have
been assigned to speakers. Every pre
cinct in the county will be thoroughly
canvassed and a meeting held in almost
every town.
This aggressive fight of the Good Gov
ernment League means the enrollment of
several thousand Republican and Demo
cratic voters in the interest of reform in
city and county government.
The Good Government League is mak
ing a strong fight for Gage and the rest
of the State ticket, but it refused to rec
ognize the county ticket nominated by
the convention that was elected by ballot
box stuffing under direction of Rea's lieu
tenants. In their canvass of the county
the league speakers make an appeal for
the State and legislative tickets, and are
doing good missionary work in the agri
cultural districts. Rea and his followers
are not making any fight for Gage and
other Republican nominees on the State
ticket because Rea's man Austin failed
to get the nomination for Secretary of
State. They have not yet held a single
ratification meeting In this city, and this
dilatory action on the part of the Rea
Republican central committee is causing
much adverse comment.
On Friday evening General Barnes will
deliver an address at the Auditorium.
WATERS AND HARRIS
TALK AT MONTERE '
Advance a. Logical Solution for the
Southern i?acinc Railway
Problem.
MONTEREY, Oct. 3.â The Republicans
of this city held a grand rally in Bagby's
Opera House to-night to welcome R. J.
Waters, candidate for Congress, and Will
A. Harris of Los Angeles, who had come
to speak to the citizens of this section on
the issues of the present campaigrn. The
stage of the opera house was elegantly
decorated with American flags and hand
some plants and over 'the center, where
hung a picture of Gage and Neff . was dis
played the word, "Welcome." The house
was packed with an enthusiastic audience,
many ladies being present as interested
listeners. Dr. A. Westfall, president of
the Thomas Flint Republican Club of
Monterey, acted as chairman, and mem
bers of the club, under whose auspices
the meeting was conducted, were seated
on the platform.
R. J. Waters was first introduced. He
spoke on the issues of the campaign as
viewed from the standpoint of Congres
sional work, closing his talk quickly to
give place to his colleague, W. A. Har-
ris.
Harris spoke for over an hour, touching
upon the Southern Pacific Railroad ques
tion, a partial solution of which already
has been found in the building: of the
San Joaquin Valley Railroad, and a com
plete solution of which rests with the
building of the Nicaragua canal. Much
patriotic fire and several idling anec
dotes aroused great entnuslasm. He said
Maguire had folded three political parties
to his bosom and was a Blngle taxer be
sides, and declared that "Maguire is no
more a Democrat, according to Jefferson
lan Democracy, than he is the angel Gab
riel."
The meeting closed with three rousing
cheers for Gape and the Republican party
and for the speakers of the evening.

â  -ADVERTISEMENTS. '
111 health is a luxury that only â^
the rich can afford, and that no one can en-
joy. Every woman is not so situated that
she can be an interesting invalid, or rather,
an uninteresting invalid, for there never
was an interesting one.
The woman who suffers from weakness
and disease of the distinctly feminine or-
gans is certain to become an invalid. No
woman can suffer in -this way and be a
healthy, happy, amiable wife and a compe-
tent mother. Troubles of this nature sap
the strength, rack the nerves, paint lines
of suffering upon the face, destroy the temp-
er, make the once bright eyes dull and
the once active brain sluggish, and trans-
form a vivacious woman into a we ik, sickly
invalid.
The one sure, speedy, permanent cure
for all disorders of the distinctly feminine
nature is Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription.
It acts directly on the delicate and import-
ant organs concerned, and makes them
strong, healthy, vigorous and elastic. It
cures the internal ulceration and inflamma-
tion that give rise to a debilitating drain on
the system. It is the best medicine for
overworked, "run-down" women.
" About six years ago my wife became afflicted
with female weakness." writes the Rev. I. J.
Coppedge. of Elmo. Kaufman Co.. Texas. "She
could pot stand on her feet or get in any position
in which she did not suffer great pain. She
despaired of ever again being well. She took six
bottles of Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription and
has been well and happy for twelve months."

GAGE AND PATTON ADDRESS MANY VOTERS
BIG MASS MEETINGS AT
SARATOGA AND TEUTONIA
HALLS LAST EVENING
The Next Governor and the Kent Mayor Join With
Congresstnan-to-Be Julius Kahn and E. F.
Preston in Cheering Speeches.
The blare of brass and the flare of bon
fires last evening were ths outward evi
dences of one of the flrst of the district
mass meeting held by the Republicans
during the campaign. The rally was held
In Saratoga Hall, Geary street, near
Hyde, under the auspices of Continental
League and Thirty-ninth District Club,
and proved a marked success.
In addition to the gubernatorial candi
date, Henry T. Gage., and Charles L. Pat
ton, candidate for Mayor, many Republi
cans of prominence were present and dis
cussed the lasuea which now confront tho
people. Among the speakers were Julius
Kahn, candidate for Congress In the
Fourth District: Charles F. Curry, W. A.
Deane, Thomas Graham, A. B. Treadwell.
Oscar Lewis. Charles 8. Laumetster,
Leon E. Jones and E. F. Preston. The
latter was prevailed upon to speak with
out preparation, and fairly took the vast
assemblage of people off their feet with
his burning words of patriotism.
The Waterman sisters an-t Jabez Swan
rendered campaign songs set to the music
of popular airs and were recalled repeat
edly. Mr. Gage came late from another
meeting, under the escort ot the Phoenix
Republican Club, the members of which
were in full uniform and carried banners
and torches. At the conclusion of his
speech Mr. Gage went among the people
shaking hands and giving the affair the
appearance of a family gathering.
Charles F. Curry proved the humorist
of the occasion, his witty sallies being ap
preciated.
Frank D. "Worth, chairman of the meet
ing, in calling it to order, said:
"Ladies and Gentlemen and Fellow Citi
zens: In assuming the duties of presiding
officer I feel proud of the honor and of
the work accomplished by the Continental
League and the Thirty-ninth District
Club. Two years ago these organizations
acted well their parts In electing one of
the greatest Presidents this country has
* ever hadâ William McKlnley. It is not
necessary at this time to review the work
he has accomplished since assuming the
duties of his office. All citizens feel proud
oi" his leadership, and will undoubtedly
show their Indorsement of his work by
electing the Republican ticket by the
handsomest majority It has ever had. Mr.
Gage is addressing another meeting to
night and will make this his last stopping
place. He will then hold a family re
union or reception and will be glad to
meet you all and shake you by the hand.
I will now present the Waterman sisters,
who will render a number of songs which,
I am sure, you will appreciate."
In presenting Julius Kahn to the as- !
eemblage Mr. Worth said: "Six years â 
ago Republicans In the Tnlrty-nlnth Dis- i
trier, looking for an Assemblyman, elect- i
oil a. man of energy and ability, one whom j
we all loved, Julius Kahn. (Applause.)
Although he had strong opponents he was j
elected by a big majority. He had to
overcome a Democratic majority of
live hundred votes. Republicans have
now selected him as their candi
date for CongTesa In thÂ» Fourth Dis
trict and hope to repeat the victory of the
campaign of six years ago. Ladies and
gentlemen, Sir. Kahn."
Mr. Kahn was accorded an ovation, j
being cheered repeatedly. He said: "Mr.
Chairman, ladies and gentlemen and
friends (for I feel I am among friends this
evening)â This is a happy moment for me.
It was from the platform of this hall that
I made my maiden speech six years ago
and launched my bark on the sea of poli
tics. I hope my friends have never re
gretted the part they played at that time.
If they continue to do battle for me we
â¢will carry the district for the Republican
party by a large majority. If evt-r there
â was a time in the history of this State
â when California should be found in the
Republican column this is the time.
The election of a Republican Congress
man means the indorsement of President
McKinley and his grand administration.
"Why should we not indorse his adminis
tration when the men of all parties admit
him to be a man of the hour? He has
made no mistake In the critical times
through which this country has Just
passed, and the people owe it to him that
we stand by him now. There is no part
of the United States so vitally affected
by the struggle we have gone through as
California. We have annexed Hawaii, and
the forthcoming months may witness the
acquisition of the Philippines. We want
the commerce of these islands to come to
Califprnia â to come to San Francisco. If
â¢we elect a Congressman in touch with the
present administration we can accomplish
great results. Reports of last year show
tho imports from the Philippine Islands
amounted to $4,000,000. What do we sell
them? Goods only to the value of $162,000.
England sells them $3,000,000; Germany,
$800,000; France, $700,000. and the United
States, as I said before, a paltry $162,000.
Now we propose to alter that condition.
We want to exchange goods to the value
of $4,000,000 for what we get from them.
Wf> can do so if you will but lend your
efforts to elect a Republican Congress
man from this district. We want a cable
across the broad Pacific to the Hawaiian
Islands. We want It soon and we want
It to start from San Francisco. To se
cure these essentials you must elect men
In touch with the administration; men
who arc Republicans and who stand with
the administration on every measure for
the advancement of the people's interest.
"I am a Callfornian, anil I seek Call
nia's prosperity and greatness. She can
only be great and prosperous when her
men are all employed. The Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association Is doing
a good work in trying to get the goods
isscd on this coast pun liased here. Some
times contracts are so drawn as to ex
clude California products. Whether this
Is due to accident or design it Is wrong to
this Â£>tate, as every dollar spent here
helps to build up the Pacific Coast. This
is really the great Republican doctrine
of protection; It is the men who spend
money herÂ© who develop the State and
Its resources. ,
"The acquisition of the Philippines will
mean development of our ship-building
. Interests. We want ihese islands to re
ceive the goods which are sent from Amer
ica in American ships. We have facilities
for all this. We have built on this coast
the most remarkable battle-ship that ever
Bailed the ocean. I allude to the Oregon.
(Great applause). Our mechanics will
have many more chances to reproduce
this modern fighting machine. Mr. Scott
has just returned from the East, bring
ing with him a number of Government
contracts. The fulfilling of these will
give employment to thousands of men for
â  come time to come.
"If elected to the office to which I as
pire, my voice and vote will always go
toward aiding my native State in secur
ing more contracts. The time has come
when this country must have a navy sec
ond to none, and I will also vote to main
tain a standing army of 100,000 men. I be
lieve In the principles set down by the
immortal Lincoln, that 'In time of peace
prepare for war.'
"I wish to say a word In favor of our
candidate for Governor. Henry T. Gage.
(Applause). The election of Mr. Maguire
would be a grave mistake. We need cap
ital to develop the State. If Maguire is
elected, capital will not be invested,
especially as he is a man who believes in
single tax."
In closing Mr. Kahn said: "Another
distinguished gentleman is to follow me
and I will not take more of your time."
The audience laughed at his "another dis
tinguished gentleman " and he said,
"After so many good things have been
said about mo I have come to believe
them myself, which has led me Into this
slight mistake. (Applause).
E. F. Preston said In part: "I came
here to-night, without being invited, to
hear the Republican spell binders tell us
of the good old principles of the Republi
can party. I have no notes and made no
preparation. It was my intention to re
main in the background, but I was in
vited to occupy a place on the stage. I
really don't know whether my hair Is
combed. As I said I made no preparation
to speak, but it needs no preparation in
these times to make a Republican speech.
I am an American. I am next a Califor
nian, although I am not a native son. I
came before many native sons and before
many of them were expected. People are
apt to look upon the campaign for Gov
ernor as aji off year in politics. This Is
not a correct view to take. There are
national Issues of great moment to be
considered. The election of a Republi
can Congressman is one ot them. The
country would not have been In debt
when President McKinley assume^ office
had Cleveland not been aided by a Dem
ocratic House. The Democratic party is
a party of Isms. When you want history
go to the Republican party; when you
want objections go to the Democrats.
"The war has made American peoole
one people. The men who crossed to Cuba
and fought desperately at El Caney and
Santiago knew no North, no South. They
were Americans under the American flag.
To-night the world knows it is best to
be aware of America when she is aroused.
"I thought Mr. Bryan's free silver party
was det-ply buried, but Maguire digs it up
by indorsing the platform of the free sil
ver Republicans. Maguire poses as the
only anti-monopolist on the coast. I
thought many Republicans', voted against
the funding bill. The solution of the rail
road Question is not to be brought about
by speeches. I thought the great anti
monopolists were the men who spent
their money on rails and cars, to build a
competing railroad down through the Ban
Joaquin Valley. These men are with Gage
to the finish. They are behind him because
they know he is honest, and there are no
strings or. him and no promises to keep
to the railroad people. It was my privilege
to urge before the convention in Sacra
mento his claims as an honest, fearless
Californian man. The American people
want fair play and a fair field, and that is
all we ask for Mr. Gage."
Chairman Worth in introducing Charles
L. Putton remarked that some time since
the Democrats were saying the Repub
licans had no man who could run against
their representative. Now they say the
Democrats have put up a man who will
be hard to beat. He then presented Mr.
Patton as the next Mayor. The latter
said:
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will not go so
far as the chairman a/id say that I will

that If It lies in my power and In the
power of my friends, I will take my plaoe

uary. I am no millionaire, but come be
fore you as a man of the people and ask
for your votes. At the last convention I
Insisted that the Republican party should
support the new charter adopted by this
city. Nobody dare say we cannot have it,
and every Senator and Assemblyman must
favor it. I wil do all in my, power to
have It adopted.
"I believe In the dollar limit and If the
Republican Board of Supervisors Is
elected you will not have to pay more.
The platform stands for public ownership
of utilities. I pay $2 30 a month here for
water that -would cost but $9 a year in

I will pledge myself to endeavor to stop

patronage to dispense you need only
come to me and not go to any political
boss. When the Legislature of this great
State approves the new charter of this
City, see to it that Henry T. Gage signs
the bill." Mr. Gage spoke briefly saying:
"Ladies and gentlemen: At this late
hour and after all the Republican senti
ments you have heard. I feel sure that
you do not expect to hear me speak upon
the issues of the campaign. I feel deeply
the kind reception you have accorded me

meeting with varying success, sometimes
being the victor and sometimes the loser. |
On the occasion which I have in mind
she was particularly anxious to prove sue- j
cessful as many neighbors were witnesses : ,
of the conflict. So she prayed: 'O! Lord,
you know I am not one of those always
dinging at you for favors; if you come
to my assistance this time I'll never pray j
to you for a favor again.'
"This is the position in which I appear >

sole ambitipn of my life, that of being
Governor of this glorious State of Cali

passed expressed- the sentiment that I
would rather be the Governor of this
State than President of the United States.
If elected I promise that I will so dis
charge the duties of my office that you
will feel I have never been dominated by
any man or any corporation. I will ad
minister the office honestly, bravely,
economically and in a businesslike man

A HEARTY GREETING.
It Is Given to Gage at Teutonia
Hall.
There was a large and enthusiastic
gathering of citizens last evening at Teu
tonia Hall on Howard street, near Ninth,
to welcome Henry T. Gage and other
standard bearers of the Republican party.
In preparation for the event the hall had
been artistically decorated. Hyman's band
furnished the music, assisted by the Sam
Booth Glee Club.
The audience was a representative onÂ«
of the Thirty-first Assembly District be
ing comprised largely of artisans and la
boring men. with a fair sprinkling of
women. The best of order prevailed
throughout the meeting, except upon one
or two occasions when an old man of
Democratic proclivities, with an empty
bottle in his pocket, Insisted on Interrupt
ing the speakers and would not be quiet
ed. The audience finally drowned him out
in good natured applause and allowed him
to remain on the theory that there was a
spark of good in the man, inasmuch as
he^ was willing to come under the regene
rating influences of a Republican meet-
| ing.
Mr. J. F. McGlynn, chairman of the
I Thirty-first Assembly District Republican
I Club, Introduced A. Branch as chairman
! of the meeting in a few appropriate re
marks. The Bam Booth Glee Club then
entertained the audience with a song,
! while the Phoenix Republican Club, at
j tired In Its natty blue and white uniforms,
I was marching into the hall.
A few moments later the next Governor
of California walked swiftly down
through the side aisle to the stage and
was gTeeted with a deafening outburst
cf applause. After order had been re
stored, Chairman Branch introduced Mi\
Gage, who spoke as follows:
"It is not my purpose to address you on
political questions. I have the more de
lightful purpose In view of making the
acquaintance of the persons comprising
this audience. I wish to know you per
sonally. It has been told me that my dis
tinguished opponent claims the right to
triumph over me In this particular dis
trict because he was once a blacksmith.
I honor any man who labors honestly In
any walk in life, whether it be as Presi
dent of the United States or as a Supreme
Justice, or as a sweeper of the streets.
The latter Is just as good as the Presi
dent, if he does his duty faithfully. From
this expression you can know that I
sympathize with labor. My opponent may
have been a blacksmith, but I pause to
remurk that he doesn't pound Iron Just
now. While he was a blacksmith I was
a driver of a wagon team on the Western
plain and heard the crack of the Indian
rifle. But because T. have gone through
terrible trials, or the other man has lab
ored faithfully, that constitutes no rea
son why either of us should be elected
Governor.
I represent an idea. The Democratic
fusion candidate stands for a confusion
of Ideas. If you believe that the fuslon
lst following, with divergent views and
horrible platforms, ought to be trium
phant in the coming election then I ad
vise you to cast your votes with that fol
lowing. But if you believe in the Repub
lican party, then I think that I am en
titled to your consideration.
"If I am elected Governor of this State
I will not be dominated by any corpora
tion, any individual or any', aing except
a solemn purpose to do my duty. The Re
publicans have chosen good State and
municipal tickets, and I have no doubt
that success will be the result."
Chairman Branch then Introduced
Charles F. Curry, candidate for Secre
tary of State, who called the attention
of his auditors to the fact that hÂ© lived
In the district when he first came Into
political office in thlÃ city as County
Clerk. He referred to his past record in
putting 2000 men to work, and in other
ways assisting the laboring classes. Then,
turning his attention to the candidates
for Congress in the district, he said:
"We have in the present contest a man
named Kahn as our candidate. Do you
think that any railroad interest would
want Kahn? Hardly. As for his oppo
nent, all that can be said of him is that
he is a human centiped with one thou
sand legs and a sting in the end of each
leg. You never know where to look for
him.
"Before I close I wish to make a few
remarks about Mayor Phelan. He spent
the best part of four years trying to
prove that I was unfaithful in the office
of County Clerk. It might be noticed
that his efforts came to grief. Possibly
some one would be Interested in knowing
how this same Mayor, this apostle of re
form, happened to go into the County
Clerk's office and declare that his father's
estate was worth a certain figure and
then straightway go to the Assessor's
office and swear that it wa,s only worth
one-third of that sum. The worst Re
publican on the ticket nominated is bet
ter than the best Democrat ever put up
for office, and I confidently believe that
the people will so decide in November."
William Deane, candidate for County
Clerk, followed In a brief address stating
that he was confident of support south
of Market street, inasmuch as this por
tion of the city had bean his residence for
years, and he was well acquainted with
all of the people.
Julius Kahn, candidate for Congress,
paid a glowing tribute to President Mc-
Klnley, and said that the proper policy
for the people of San Francisco to follow
was to elect Republican Congressmen so
that the administration could be success
fully approached and favors secured for
the Pacific Slope. If work on the new
Postofflce building cnuld be commenced
through the active efforts of Republican
Congressmen the sum of $5,000,000 would
be paid out by the Government in San
Francisco, greatly to the benefit of the
laboring classes. Many Idle men would
be given employment and the whole com
munity, therefore, benefited.
Short speeches followed by George Cald
well, Thomas E. Brophy, candidate for
Assemblyman; Thomas F. Graham, can
didate for Police Judge; Supervisor-to-be
Collins and Tax Collector-to-be Sheehan.
The candidate for Mayor on the Repub
lican ticket, Charles L. Patton, was also
a speaker. Among other things, he said:
"This city can be run on a $1 tax levy,
if its affairs are conducted on a business
like basis, and I pledge myself to have
It done, in cas*>. I am elected Mayor, if
any effort of mine can be sufficient. The
water works and the gas works should
be owned by the city, and I shall favor
the acquisition of plants. There is no
bosÃ and no corporation that has any
string on me, and I shall be free from
all entanglements."
INDEPENDENT CLUB.
A New Organization Formed Irre-
spective of Party Affiliation.
A number of citizens irrespective of
party affllations met last night in the
Parrott building and formed themselves
into the "Independent Club of California."
The object of the organization is to give
the voters of the city an opportunity to
see and hear the numerous candidates
for State and municipal offices. Metro
politan Temple has been engaged by the
club and comencing next week the mem
bers intend to arrange a series of meet-
Ings at which the various candidates will
be asked to appear and discuss the Issues
of the day.
The. following officers were elected:
President. Charles A. Reynolds: secretary,
Robert Rusch. Committee on permanent or
ganization and order of businessâ Francis Bell.
J J. Groom, J. A. Robinson, Colonel Paul
Edwards. Robert Rusch.
Committee on hall and musicâ .T. Towzer, B.
T. Brady, H. B. Jennings, H. F. Sheena.i,
James J. Wren.
Finance committeeâ lsaac Grant. Prank W.
Mar:<tun, "r. W. B. Sevan, O. S. Graham and
Henry Arnold. â¢ _ _Â
Committee of arrangementsâ Porter U Bliss
R M Collins, W. A. Lewis. A. L. Holder and
F. J. Klatzel.
Committee on printingâ W. H. Eastman. T.
F. McGee and Joseph Sweetman.
The club adopted the following::
Whereas. Experience has shown us that in
municipal affairs individuals and not politi
cal affiliations are to he considered, and.
whereas, It Is desired by all good citizens that
the city and county of San Francisco shall he
governed by honest, efficient and upright men,
and whereas, both Republican ana Demo
crat';'- parties have recognized this fact in the
united support of Hon. John Lackmann. now,
therefore, we the undersigned, for purposes
hereinbefore mentioned form ourselves into an
organization to be known as the Independent
Club of California.
This declaration is signed by over 100
men of different political faiths. Another
meeting will be held to-morrow night in
one of the police courts. Arrangements
will then be completed for the first pub
lic meeting, which will be known as "Con
gress *"* S^-"^^^___^_
ATTITUDE OF LIBERALS.
Dr. J. L. York Advises All Populists
to Vote the Republican Ticket.
Dr. J. L. York, the noted liberal orator,
addressed a large and enthusiastic audi
ence at Scottish Hall Sunday evening,
upon "Liberalism and Politics." Dr. York
has been a prominent advocate of Popu
list principles for a number of years, but
prior to the adoption of those views he
was a staunch Republican and was sent
to the Legislature by that party. Speak
ing of the present political situation, the
doctor said:
"Populism is nearly dead. The Demo
crats have swallowed It. There Is but one
course for honest liberals and middle-of
the-road Populists. They must either not
vote at all or cast their ballots for the
Darty whose patriotism and statesman
ship have saved the country in the past,
and carried it safely through the perils
of war to an honorable and well-earned
peace Ido not believe in boosting into
power the Democrats of, this country. It
will take a long time to make a staunch
old Republican fuse with a Democrat. J
hope the old flag will wave right on over
every foot of acquired bpanish soil. No
man should be elected Mayor of this city,
with the appointing power the new char
ter confers upon that office, who will
draw every Democratic vote. No man
should be elected Governor of this State
who will draw every Democratic vote.
The spirit of Republicanism is not dead,
and I have faith that it will save our
country in the future as It has in the
past, with bullets in time of war, and
ballots In time of peace."
Dr. York will continue these meetings
every Sunday evening during the month,
under the auspices ot "The Sunday Plat
form Association." during which time the
political issues will be freely discussed.
The cheers and applause which greeted
the speaker spoke sentiments of the lib
eral element of this city, whose votes
will be cast for Republican candidates In
November.
SDelllns: Still in the Fight.
The hearing of the mandamus proceed
ings begun in the Supreme Court by T.
Carl Spelling to compel Secretary of State
Brown to place his name on the State
ticket as the regular Democratic nom
inee for Congress in the Fourth District
was postponed yesterday, owing to the
fact that Spelling had not been served
with a copy of the answer. The answer
was served on Spelling later in the day
and he expects to be able to proceed with
the hearing either to-day or Wednesday.
Spelling claims that he has the Demo
cratic nomination and that he is entitled
to the place on the ticket instead of James
H. Barry, the Populist-Democratic nom
inee.
Laguna Club Meeting,
The Laguna Democratic Club held a
well attended meeting at Schmidt's Hall,
corner of Fell and Franklin streets, last
evening. The speakers of the evening
were John P. Dunn, William Craig. Wil
liam Hinton, William F. White, Frank
Murasky, Charles Holcomb and Robert
L. Mann. The officers of the club are:
John Hayes, president; George Botcher,
vice president; Timothy Riordan, secre
tary; Stephen Clark, sergeant at arms.
WHAT AMBER CONTAINS.
More than 200 kinds of extinct life, in
cluding insects, reptiles, plants, shell,
fruit, etc., have been found in amber. In
an English collection, which is valued at
$500,000, is a perfect llp&rd, eight inches
long.
PETITIONS BY
THE DOZENS ARE
BEING PEDDLED
Independents Will Be
Very Numerous.
CORONER'S FEES AN ISSUE
REPORTS SHOW THE OFFICE TO
BE VEBY DESIRABLE.
J. J. Tobin Declines to Run for
State Senator on the Ticket
Put Up by the
Fusionists.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Oct. 3.
Petitions of Independent candidates are
now the order of the day and no one can
pass along Broadway without being Im
portuned to give an aspiring politician an
opportunity to get on the ticket. Last
Friday's convention brought at least
twenty independent candidates Into the
field, all of whom had to procure the nec
essary three per cent of signatures to en
able them to get on the ballot. Each hour
party lines are getting wider apart and
the campaign is now a free-for-all.
Already dissatisfaction among the fu
sionists is being manifested. J. J. Tobln
of Alameda, who was nominated for State
Senator from the Twenty-eighth District,
has sent in his resignation to the county
committee, "for business reasons," find
ing it impossible to make the campaign.
Other resignations are expected.
Much Interest has been shown in the
statement of James Taylor, an Independ
ent candidate for Coroner, that he 'Will
give all the fees of the oince to the Asso
ciated Charities, should he be elected.
While it is not altogether clear how
this "understanding" may conflict with
the purity of election law, there Is much
speculation as to just what Mr. Taylor s I
offer means. The annual report of the j
Coroner for the past year shows that the j
fees for inquests, which it is presumed
Mr. Taylor intends, if elected, to give to ,
the Associated Charities, amount to
$1723.
Other Items connected with the Coro
ner's office show that apart from the fees
there is a very large amount paid that of
ficial for the business accompanying the
work of the office. These fees for the last
year are:
Mileage, $214 15; removal of bodies, j
$537 50; directing funerals, $342; Inspecting ;
bodies, $180; burial of lndigents, $507; total, I
$18*) 65. I
There are yet other items connected
with the Coroner's office which must be
considered. Under the heading of â¢'burial i
of lndigents," other than the $507, $I^BB \
has been spent during the year, and in I
another department of the annual report, j
$450 Is shown to have been spent for the
burial of Union soldiers. All this busi
ness would naturally go to the under
taker who might be Coroner. Conse- i
quently, Mr. Taylor Is probably right in
stating that the business of the office is
worth more than the fees.
Tomorrow evening the Republican Alii- ;
ance will give a house-warming at Its
new quarters in Elite Hall.
A Maguire club will be organized In the
Fourth Ward to-morrow evening and on
the same night the Second Ward Re
publican Club will meet at Milton Hall,
and the Fourth Ward Republican Club
in People's Hall.
PROVING HIS CASE.
"I never have been able to get It
through my head," she said as the lights
burned low. "which Is the more formal
In beginning a letterâ 'dear' or 'my dear.'
Of course I mean preceding a name."
"It depends upon circumstances to a
large extent," he replied.
"But 'dear' is unquestionably a term of
endearment," she protested.
"And yet," he asserted, "it's absence
may make an endearing phraseâ a love
message, If you will â doubly significant."
"I fall to see how," she returned, blush
ing prettily, merely because of the course
the conversation was taking. "I should
say rather that it became the more sig
nificant as one approached the superla
tive degree."
"In a measure, It depends, he admit
ted; "but much depends upon the circum
stances and the persons involved. If an
old gentleman writing to you addresses
you as 'Dear Miss Brown' that is dis
tinctly formal, while if he says 'My Dear
Miss Brown' it seems a trifle patronizing
and fatherly, and to that extent is more
friendly. But If a young man uses 'Dear 1
and 'My Dear* the conditions seem to be
reversed."
"I don't how."
"Then let me illustrate," he said. "Sup
pose I should address you as 'My Dear
Girl.' That would seem rather patroniz
ing would it not, as if I were about to
point out some little error or bit of fool
ishness? But if I should say 'Dear Girl,'
how about that? Does it not mean more
than the other in my case?"
"While you are about it," she suggest
ed again blushing, "why might you not
say 'Dearest Girl?' "
"The superlatives are used so much by
some Americans," he said, "that they
lose much of their force and often do not
seem to to have the strength found In
lesser degrees. As love terms "Dear
Heart' and 'Sweet Heart' have stood the
test of years, and any attempt to put
them in the superlative, as 'Dearest
Heart' and 'Sweetest Heart' instead of
being more effective would be simply
farcical and would detract from, rather
than add to, their significance."
"But how about withdrawing the word
'dear' entirely?" she asKed, for being
woman it was only natural that shw
should wish to make a study of all the
intricacies of these terms. "You spoke
of that, you know."
"Certainly," he answered; and I can
prove the truth of what I said. Again
let me Illustrate with you. I say to you,
"My Dear Mamie.' It may mean much,
it may mean little. It depends upon cir
cumstances. It may seem patronizing, or
it may not. That also depends upon cir
cumstances, and not the tone. But wo
take away the word 'dear ' and then I
say to you 'My Mamie.' What do you
say to that?" â 
"Why, Iâ l guess I am. she replied,
blushing a deeper red than before, "but
you might have found out whether I was
or not without adopting such a round
about method."
Nevertheless, having proved his case
and accomplished his purpose, he proced
ed to take possession.â Chicago Evening
Post.
ROLLING OTTT THE GUNPOWDER.
At a recent fire in Boston, which filled
the neighboring building, a gun store,
with smoke and threatened its destruc
tion, a man quietly sat upon the powder
chest near the dor until it was removed
to a safe place in an adjacent block. The
cool deed recalls an anecdote told in "A
God Child of Washington," about a fire
in New York, in 1783. while the British
were getting ready to evacuate the city.
Colonel Morgan Lewis had returned to
his houee in the city, and with him, as
guests were Mr. and Mrs. Alexander
Hamilton. Fire broke out In the arsenal,
and all classes were frightened. Those
Americans who had returned to their
homes feared that the arsenal had been
set on fire by the British. The British
soldiers kept aloof, lest they should be
suspected and become the object of popu
lar violence. The flames continued un
checked.
Colonel Lewis and Mr. Hamilton were
forming the citizens in line to pass
leather buckets from hand to hand, when
a soldier announced that all was lost, as
the arsenal contained several barrels of
gunpowder, t tiich the fire had just
reached. , .
"Come, my lnds, won t you help us?"
said Colonel Lewis to the British soldiers
standing Idly by.
"Yes. sir. willingly, they replied.

ARE NOT HARMONIOUS
They Had Several Very Lively Wrangles Over
Nominations Last Night and Considerable
- . Feeling Was Shown.
Delegate Denicke Believed That They Should Withdraw Unless
They Lived Dp to Their Principles-Nominations
for Several Important Offices
Decided Upon.
The Citizens' Non-Partisan convention
met in Pioneer Hall last night, and con
siderable time was wasted in useless
wrangling. A hard fight was made by
the friends of M. C. Haley to secure for
him the nomination of County Clerk, but
the workers for John A. Brown, the Dem
ocratic nominee, were in the majority, and
they carried off the political plum. The
nomination of Barclay Henley for Dis
trict Attorney was strenuously opposed by
several of the members, but they only ar
gued in vain, for Henley was the "slate"
candidate and he went through.
"Whispering" Gavin McXab. Frank
Gould. Bama McKinne and several others
of Buss Phelan's coterie of politicians
were among the spectators taking notes
that may be of benefit to them in future
political conventions.
When Chairman Fitch called the meet
ing to order forty-two of the members of
the convention responded to the roll.
On motion of E. J. Le Breton, the rules
â¢were amended, so that after three ballots
were taken for any candidate a majority
Instead of a two-third's vote would nom
inate.
Ludwig Altschul, chairman of the Com
mittee on Supervisors, then presented the |
following .report: !
To the President and Members of the Non-
Partisan Conventionâ : Your com
mittee on Supervisors beg to report that we
have held seven meetings with a large repre
sentation present on each occasion. That we
have not reported earlier is due to the fact
that while we have diligently canvassed the
merits of possible candidates, we have awaited
linal action of the Republican and Democratic
parties, pnd now present the following candi
dates for your consideration:
First Ward. Edward L,. Holland: Second
Ward, Stewart Menzies; Third Ward. Louis F.
Burtlett; Fourth Ward, your committee present
two names for your choice, Osgood Putnam and
Pr. F.. L. Perrault; Fifth Ward, Isidore Gutte;
Sixth Ward, John Ixickmann; Seventh Ward,
1,. F. Byingi Eighth Ward. Julius Plat
check: Ninth Ward. Albert Heyer; Tenth
Ward, Jeremiah Deasy; Eleventh Ward, Dr.
Charles A. Clinton; Twelfth Ward, P. F. But
ler.
The committee on Board of Education
filed a lengthy report, going over the
work performed in selecting the names
presented for nomination. It Bet forth
that there are generally four classes of
men seeking nomination for the School
Board.
"The first are villains who seek office j
for dishonest purposes; those who wish
to iell more drugs, Â£vii more teeth, bury
more dead or get an opportunity to ex
periment on more sick; those who want
to attract attention to themselves and
lastly those who look upon office as â  a
public duty." The report concluded with
a recommendation of the following: j
C. P. Eells. Benjamin Armer, T. J. Lyons,
Alfred Eichler, H. M. Brandenstein, Wil
liam M. Cannon, Vanderlynn Stow. H. M.
Holbrook, W. G. Stafford, E. L. Head, P.
A. Bergerot and J. M. Thomas. All of
these candidates, with the exception of
Armer. have been nominated either by
the Republican or Democratic party. The
committee suggested the name of Armer
feeling that he had been a faithful ser
vant while in the School Board and that
he was entitled to renomination.
The municipal committee reported in
favor of Michael Ma her for Recorder, Dr.
William J. Hawkins for Coroner and J.
A. Drinkhouse for Public Administrator.
E. J. Le Breton introduced a resolution
providing that the present county com
mitte hold 'office until the next conven
tion and be authorized to fill any vacancy
that might occur after the adjournment
of the convention. "
The work of balloting for County Clerk
was taken up. Three ballots were taken
last Friday night without a choice.
George Gumming said that it had been
reported that .'I. C. Haley had been
placed in nomination against John A.
Brown, the Democratic nominee, in order
to ere; a discord and elect William A.
LVane, the Republican nominee.
Cumming angrily denied that such was
the case. He said that a failure to nomi
rate Haley would be tantamount to going
back on the principles of the party.
Haley, when in office, made a faithful
public servant and it was his belief that
If he was nominated he would stand a
very good chance of election. Brown, he
said, while a very good man, was com
paratively unknown, and he believed that
it would be a display of good judgment
on the part of Brown to withdraw In
favor of Haley and to allow him to make
the run against Deane. "Brown," said he,
"comes from a dry-goods house; we had
one candidate two years ago from a dry
goods house, Supervisor Delany. and we
don't want any more of Delany."
C. B. Perkins spoke In defense of
Brown, and said that he believed that
Haley could not win with a Non-Partisan
endorsement alone. I. T. Milliken re
. ferred to the fact that Haley, with Demo
cratic and Non-Partisan nominations four
years ago, had been beaten by County
Clerk Curry, and asked if Haley, had
gained any strength since that time.
"L. R. Ellert and Judge J. C. B. Heb
bard won on our nomination," replied D.
J. Mahoney, "and I Oettvethat Haley will
be able to do the same thing."
Ajj Bbarboro also favored giving the
nomination to Haley. "It is said," re
marked Sbarboro, "that the cardinal
principle of our paTty is reward of merit.
Let us nominate Haley, and prove that
we are true to our principle." E. J. Le
Breton proposed Haley. He said that Ha
ley's defeat was due to a combination
of bosses, and that two years afterward
the very same bosses were making a fight
for his renomination. He said he be
lieved that there was some underlying
feeling and underlying Influence at work.
"1 am afraid," said he, "the bosses have
crept into our organization and are at
tempting to use it to accomplish a pur
pose we should all deplore." The roll was
then called. The first ballot stood Brown
27, Haley 16. The second ballot Brown
32, Haley 11. Brown was declared the
choice of the convention and his nomina
tion was afterward made unanimous.
The names of I. J. Truman and M.
Greenblatt were presented for Treasurer.
There was no choice on fine first ballot,
Truman receiving 27 votes and Green
blatt 15. The second ballot resulted: Tru
man 30, Greenblatt 12. Truman was de
clared the nominee. He was next nomi
nated by acclamation to fill the unexpired
term for Treasurer.
The municipal convention recommended
James N. Block for Tax Collector, Ed
ward I. Sheehan, the Republican nominee,
was also placed in nomination. Block
was nominated on the first ballot by a
vote of 34 to 4. .
Charles S. Tllton and Bernard Bienfleld
were placed In nomination for Surveyor.
Frank J. Sullivan opposed Tilton on the
ground that while serving as an Election
Commissioner he had shown himself to be
unfavorable to the new charter. George
ueose
â¢
I L. Center also opposed JlUon. claiming:
l that he had neglected his duty In the mat
ter of overseeing the construction of the
Brannan street sewer. A ballot was then
taken and resulted In the nomination or
Bienfleld by a vote of 31 to 12.
Michael Meagher and A. C. Berthler
were placed in nomination for Recorder.
On the recommendation of Magher by the
! committee he received the entire vote of
! the convention. - _
Dr. William J. Hawkins and Dr. E. E.
j Hill were placed in nomination for Coro
1 ncr The vote stood Hawkins, 35, Hill, 3.
Hawkins was declared the choice of the
convention.
There was another stir in the conven
tion when the office of Public Adminls
j trator was taken up. The committee
recommended the nomination of J. A.
Prink house, but also presented the names
of Edward L. Fitzgerald ajid A. C. Freese.
George Cummlng again claimed the floor
and asked what had become of the prin
ciples of the party when a man like Cap
tain Freese was not recommended. Cap
tain Freese, who was standing in the
rear of the hall, then stepped forward in
the center aisle and asked leave to with
draw his name.
"I am sorry," said E. A. Denicke. "to
sec the way this convention is drifting.
I am sorry to say that we appear to be
lacking in a little backbone. If we ad
hered a little to our original policy it
would be better for the party, we should
\ have the courage of our convictions and
make some independent nomination. If
we don't waiit to do this we shoujd with
draw from the field and give some other
organization an opportunity to carry out
the work for which we organize!. Cap
tain Freese has faithfully served th<? city j
for eight years and if he had allowed his
name to remain I should have beon |
pleased to vote for him."
Delegate Cumming then formally placed
Freese in nomination. He said that Freese
h:ul never used his office for personal
gain. Warren Gregory said while he was |
personally friendly to Freese and the em- i
ployes of his office he did not think that
he could conscientiously vote for him. in- :
asmueh as Probate Judge Coffey some
time ago wrote a letter criticizing the ad- I
ministration of his office. The roll was
then ordered called, and the first ballot
resulted: Drlnkhouse 15, Fitzgerald 24,
Freese 4. There was no choice.
Before the second roll was called Freese j
advanced to the front of the hall and de- ,
manded that in Justice to himself the let- i
t,er referred to by Gregory should be i
i made public by Gregory if he had it in his !
: posession. Gregory replied that he never j
j read the letter, but had been informed of
Its existence by Frank H. Gould. George
i X. Cumming insisted that the letter be
I produced, as It was only fair to Freese
I that its contents be made public before
! the convention. Chairman Fitch ordered
i the roll called, and the vote stood, Drink
house IS, Fitzgerald 23. There being no
choice a third ballot was taken resulting, !
Drtnkhouse 19, Fitzgerald 22. Freese 2.
Under the amendment to the rules
made early in the evening on motion of
Le Breton, Chairman Fitch held that the \
candidate receiving the largest number of :
i votes on the next ballot would be thenom- ]
Inee of the convention. The roll was |
called and Drinkhouse was nominated, re- |
: ceiving 20 votes to Fitzgerald's 16, Freese j
4. Gregory then rose to a Question of i
privilege and said that Gould had Just j
then presented him with the letters he re- j
ferred to. He then proceeded to read i
them. They wen- written during the last
session of the Legislate re by Judge Cof- I
fey to Senator Braunhart. They referred ,
i in a general way to the .necessity of j
| amending the probate laws so that at
! torneys could not charge such exorbitant '.
fees for the settlement of estates. In one !
letter there was a slight reference to the j
administration of the Public Administra
tor's office.
Frank J. Sullivan, a brother in law of
| Boss Phelan. then reported that 'the ju- j
dlciary committee had unanimously de
cided to recommend Barclay Henley for |
the nomination for District Attorney. 11Â»
referred at length to the record made by
Henley as foreman in the Wallace Grand
Jury, and said that if Henley was elected
he would fearlessly prosecute all offend
â  ers. whether rich or poor.
George Cumming then claimed the floor.
He said it was a most wonderful tiling
that there was only one man in town j
who would make a good District Attor- ;
ney, and the most mysterious part of it,
he added, is that this one man Is a Dem
ocrat. "Here we are again drifting away
from our principles," he continued. "For |
when we organized, we made it one of
our rules that no member of this con
vention should receive the nomination. I
understand that P. F. Butler, one of
Mayor Phelan's tenants, and Stewart
Menzles, who are also delegates to this !
convention, are to be nominated for Su- !
pervisors. Are we keeping faith with the !
people in acting this way?"
"But they are not delegates," interrupt
ed Brother-in-law Sullivan. They have
resigned."
"That may be all right," replied Cum
ming, "but I don't think the people will
look at it in that way. It is said every
where that we are only the tail of the
Democratic kite. There are other lawyers
just as good as Barclay Henley. Appear
ances are against us if there has not been
some dicker or deal."
J. S. Webster s oke in defense of Hen
ley, and said that the nomination had
been tendered him by the Democrats
without his solicitation. He also claimed
that Henley had not solicited the vote of
any member of the convention.
"This is a very dangerous thing to do,"
said Frank K. Bymmes. "Here we have
a rule that no member is eligible. I have
nothing against Mr. Henley. I am fight
ing for a principle."
H. L. Davis read a letter from A. S.
Hallidie indorsing Henley and advocating
his nomination. Cumming said l\e knew
It was useless to argue against the nomi
nation of Henley, and that they might
Just as well proceed to ballot. Henley re
ceived 36 votes and 3 were cast for D. J.
Murphy, the Republican nominee. The
convention then adjourned to meet to
night in Pioneer Hall.
MILLIONAIRE IN A MOMENT.
It falls to the lot of but few men to
make the discovery that they are stand
ing on a mine of fabulous value. This
good fortune has recently befallen Mr.
T. C. Bassett, a mining expert, whose
keen eye and a stroke of luck converted
him in a moment from a poor man to be
master of millions. Mr. BaÃsett, who is
attached as expert to a mining corpo
ration in South America, was on a .short
visit to relatives in California, when it
occurred to him that he might utilize
some of his time prospecting for gold.
His wanderings took him in the direc
tion of the famous Death Valley, where
one day he mounted a small, cone-shaped
hill in order to get a better view of the
surrounding country. He was about to
descend the hill, to continue his tramp,
when a patch of blue at his feet arrest
ed his attention. Bassett's trained eye
recognized in the blue patch the "blue
float" which is sure indication of the
f>resence of turquoise In the soil. He
ost no time in locating a claim, and
was soon hard at work with pick and
shovel. His most sanguine expectations
were more than realized, for at the depth
of six feet he found the "boxite vein,"
which was thickly studded with beauti
ful stones. The deeper he dug the more
magnificent were the gems, and within
a fortnight he was able to return to San
Francisco with no lees than seventy
pounds of the most brilliant and flawless
turquoises that have ever been discov
ered.âLondon Tit-Bits.

CAMPAIGN
CIRCULAR
Silly Document From
the Fusion Bureau.
TACTICS OFTHESINGLE-TAXER
MAJOR McLAUGHLIN EXPOSES A
FUSION FALSEHOOD.
Henry T. Gage, Republican Nominee
for Governor, Gaining Friends
and Supporters in San
Francisco.
The fusionists who are conducting
Maguire's campaign begin to see that
they cannot win in a straight out, man
ly contest, hence they are resorting to
political tricks and low-down election
eering tactics. A silly circular, pur
porting to emanate from the Repub
lican State Central Committee, is now
published in the Maguire press. The
Woodland Democrat of October 1 gives
space to the document and goes into
double-leaded hysterics over the sins
of the Republican State Central Com
mittee. It is asserted that the docu
ment was sent to Will Dunn of the Rio
Vista News under the impression that
he is a Republican. In ail probabil
ity the circular was composed by a co
terie of fusionists and single taxers
around the Maguire headquarters, and
by prearrangement sent to some editor
who could be trusted to place it within
reach of the Woodland Democrat as an
exclusive story. Any one reading the
document will sfee at a glance that it
emanated from the mind of a single
taxer. Following is a copy of the won
derful circular:
Office of
Committee on Campaign Literature, <
San Francisco, Sept. 6, IS9B.
To the Editorâ Dear Sir: The commit
tee on campaign press literature Is anx-
I lous that there should be no mistake
made in this campaign. We have a hard
' tight, and must use caution as well as
daring.
We suggest that editorially you chiefly
i discuss Maguire' s single tax views. It is
true they are not a part of the Demo
cratic platform, but it mwt bo impressed
!on the voters that, having nominated
Maguire, the Democracy becomes respon
j sible for all his views. You will point out
! that this means that the farmers are to
! pay all the taxes. We suggest that you
i enter into no discussion of the single tax
\ itself, as the doctrine is not well under
stood, and its advocates, having long
studied It, are apt to have you at a dfs
! advantage. Besides, the fallacious theory
is very captivating to certain classes.
! Simply state all the time that the single
I taxers mean to put all the taxes on farm
ers ami stay with that proposition.
We suggest that you appeal to the busi
j ness interests to support Mr. Gage, be
j cause he is distinctly a business Inter
! ests candidate as opposed to sandlotism,
anarchy, socialism, etc.
l>-t the railroad question alone. The rail
road must be kept in the background, sim
ply because the Maguire organs mean to ]
drag it to the front. Do not discuss It. Treat j
it as a dead lswue. But you might point :
| out that the single tax would take the :
i taxes off the railroads and put them on I
farmers.
Do not discuss the war revenue or war j
i bonds. They are not State questions, and ;
! we see no reason to drag them into this
i campaign.
The money question is not a State issue.
j We suggest that it be avoided as much
!as possible. When necessary to discuss
it use the phrase "'sound money" instead
:of "gold," "the gold standard," etc. It
I Is well to point out occasionally that the
I Republican platform also advises bimet
i alisrn win never an international agree
| ment can be had. Do not be radical in uis
cussing this question. It is far better to
' let it sleep. .
The committee urges that in your cdi
! torial columns you make frequent men-
I lion of the war and its successful opera
! tion by President McKlnley. The Demo
! cratie effort to make capita! of the sick
ness and deaths in the camps should be
offset by treating these stories as mere
j exaggerations of a partisan press.
Advocate the annexation of the Philip
pines and Nicaragua canal.
In conclusion, the committee's Judgment
is that the Republican press in this cam
paign should avoid as much as it consist
j ently can any discussion of the money
question, the railroad question or the pre
< filing State Democratic administration,
or the war taxes and the war bonds.
Deal principally with the danger to the
farmers if Maguire is elected and the
; single tax should come Into vogue. Show
! them that railroads and corporations
would escape taxation. This is especially
good to offset the demagogic attack on
> the principal railroad company of the
State made by the Maguire Demo-Pops.
Trusting that with the aid of you valu
able editorial efforts the election will
prove a great triumph for the party of
sound money, and thus strengthen the
party for the struggle with the silver
! fanatics two years hence, we are cor-
COWfMITTEB OF CAMPAIGN LITERA
TURE.
7he publication of the foregoing doc
ument caused the editor of the Wood
land Mail to ask Major Frank Mo-
Laughlin if any such document was
ever issued by the Republican State
Central Committee. Major McLaugh
lin at once wired the following denial:
REPUBLICAN
STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.
San Francisco, Oct. 3, 1898.
J. H. Dungan, Woodland, Cal.: The
statement in the Woodland Daily
Democrat of October 1 that the Re
| publican State Central Committee is
! sued a confidential letter giving in
! structions to the Republican press of
I the State as to the line upon which
j the campaign is to be conducted is as
shameful, cowardly a lie as has
yet been uttered by the Popo-Demo
cratic party in this campaign. The
circular printed in the Daily Demo
crat headed "Office of Committee en
i Campaign Press Literature, San
| Francisco, September 26, 1898," was
evidently manufactured in the Demo
cratic headquarters to injure our
party, but we will make it a boomer
! ang. FRANK McLATJGHLIN,
Chairman Republican State Central
Committee.
The Woodland Democrat does not as
sert directly that the Republican State
Central Committee authorized the cir
cular, but uses this language:
The State Central Committee appointed
r press committee. The latter has issued
a confidential letter giving instructions to
the Repuhlican press of the State as to
the lines, upon which the campaign is to
1... conducted. One of these circular let
tera wns sent to Will Dunn of the Rio
Vista News under the impresssion that he
is a Republican.
Perhaps the Woodland Democrat
knew that the State Central Commit
tee which appointed a press committee
was the Maguire committee, although
the article denouncing the circular is
so worded as to leave the impression
in the public mind that the circular em
anated from the Republican State Cen
tral Committee.
Henry T. Gage, the Republican nom
inee, is daily gaining friends and sup
porters in San Francisco. The masses
of the people are weary of men who
are constantly seeking public office and
turn with satisfaction to the candidacy
of Mr. Gage. It is set down to his
credit that he never held a public of
fice and never drew a dollar from the
public treasury- The people meet a
man of this kind with pleasure.
Mr. Gage addressed two meetings in
San Francisco last night. He will ad
dress two meetings to-night â one at
Rolander Hotel, corner of Twenty
eighth and Church streets, and another
at Mowry Hall, corner of Grove and
Laguna streets. Charles L. Patton,
Republican nominee for Mayor, and
Eugene F. Loud, Republican nominee
for CongreÃS in the Fifth District, will
also address the people this evening at
the places named.
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION.
Timothy Flynn, Father of the ex-
County Clerk, Arre-ted on a
Serious Charge.
Timothy Flynn, father of ex-County
Cleric James Flynn, was arrested last
night and placed on the small book pend
ing an investigation. The police claim
that he was in a saloon on the corner of
Church and Clpper streets, past Saturday
night when a man named Frank Foy, who
lives at 3927 Church street Joined him and
they drank together. Foy displayed a
twenty-dollar gold piece and shortly after
ward left the saloon, and, on his way
home, was waylaid and robbed. Foy's
skull was fractured In two places and he
is now lying at his home in a dangerous
condition.
The police apprehended Flynn on thÂ«
statement of a female witness, who
claims she saw Flynn knock Foy down
and relieve him of the coin.
Flynn was himself robbed several
months ago of $186. while en route home.
A DENTIST TAKES HIS LIFE.
Dr. Charles A. Huber Swallows Car-
bolic Acid While Despondent
and Dies en Route to
the Hospital.
Dr. Charles A. Huber, a dentist, with
offices at 42% Turk street, committed sui
cde ths mornng by swallowng the
contents of a bottle containing carbolic
acid. His groans attracted the attention
of a woman in the house and she noti
fied the police. The door was forced open
and they found Huber in an unconscious
condition. The ambulance was hurriedly
rung for, but he died before he reached
the Receiving Hospital.
A notebook found in his room disclosed
his name and his address 338 Turk street.
Vnder it was written "Mrs. J. C. Bram,
L. A., 1968 % E. First street, L. A.'
Huber was found partially disrobed. He
Is a young man about 25 years old. A
friend informed the police that i c tried
twice before to end his lFfe, but without
success. Disappointment In love is given
as a cause of his ending his existence.
AFFLICTED WITH APHASIA.
John McMonahan Is a farmer in a small
i way living some little distance from
Plaquemine, on the river. About three
weeks ago he fell from the roof of a
house near his place upon which he wns
assisting in some repairs, and struck his
for head heavuy against a piece of scant
ling. When picked up he was apparently
dazed and half unconscious, and as his
condition grew steadily worse he was
brought to New Orleans for medical
treatment. _ ,
The physicians found him suffering
from a well-developed case of aphasia.
Aphasia .roughly described, is a condition
in which the victim loses the faculty of
language, but it is not necessarily accom
panied by any mental derangement. He
is simply' unable to translate his thoughts
into appropriate words, and this affection
is usually the result of some injury to the
frontal portions of the brain.
McMonahan was very much emaciated
and presented a stupid, dull appearance,
as if under the influence of some narcotic.
When trip doctors questioned him sharply
he would brighten up for a moment and
make what seemed to be an earnest effort
to reply, but his words were always irrele
vant and unrelated to one another.
"What is your name?" said one of the
examiners, close to his ear.
A violent spasm convulsed Mc.Monahan's
features and he made a motion with his
hand, as If brushing aside something. The
gesture was Immensely expressive; It was
as If he knew the wrong word was coming
to his ilps and was endeavoring to thrust
it aside.
"Fourteen." he said at length.
When the question was repeated, hÂ©
said, "Never wait," and the phrase seem
ed to stick to his tongue, for he recurred
to it several times in the course of the ex
amination.
After a dozen or more futile efforts the
patient lapsed into moody silence and
could not be induced to speak again. In
some cases of apha-sia the sufferer retains
his ability to write coherently, although
he cannot reproduce the same words in
speech. McMonahan Is unlettered and
cannot read or write, hence the test could
not be applied. There were apparently
some slight symptoms of paralysis on the
right side, but they were not particularly
markerl. and the physicians were inclined
to believe that the man would In time re
cover his faculties. He was plainly suffer
ing for lack of nourishment and was put
on proper diet. â New Orleans Times-Dem

WHAT CUBA COST SPAIN.
The mass of the Spanish people now
think that it is not worth while spend
ing their lives and money over the reten
tion of territories so disaffected to the
mother country. In fact, the Spanish na
tion is tired of a war which has brought
nothing but disaster. From March, 1895,
to June, IS9S, Spain has sent to Cuba
180.431 soldiers, 6222 officers, 615 high offi
cials, and 10 generals; or, with 12,000 men
already in Cuba before the rebellion
broke out, a total of 200,000 m*n. The
fighting losses have been, proportion
ately, very small, viz.: 2 generals, 141
officers and 2008 soldiers killed; 435 offi
cers and 5164 soldiers wounded, making
losses equal to 5 per cent of the whole
Spanish army. The victims from yellow
fever have been 313 officers and 13.000
men, and from other diseases the num
ber of deaths has been given at 127 offi
cers and 40,000 men.
Therefore, the total losses of the Span
ish army in Cuba from the beginning of
the rebellion up to June 30 of this year
amount to over 104.000 men. These fig
ures do not include the losses in the
Philippine Islands, nor those of Santiago
and Puerto Rico.
The total expenses of the campaign on
the Spanish side amount to over 1.874,000,
000 pesetas, or about $350,000,000, not in
clusive of losses in property, ships, mer
chandise, indemnities, etc., all of which
it is as yet Impossible to assess.
It is quite natural that the Spaniards
should be tired of the war, and think
that they have done enough for the na
tional honor. It remains to be seen
what the people will do with its Gov
ernment and with its future affairs.â

FRAWLEYS
IN A DALY
ADAPTATION
"The Last Word" Is a
Success.
BUSH STREET PATRIOTISM
NANCE O'NEIL AND RANXIN IN
TEARFUL DRAMA.
Tivoli's "Bohemian Girl"â Domestic
Strife at Morosco'sâ "The Glad
iator" at the Alhambra.
The Others.
When it was first announced that the
Frawleys were going to move around
the corner to Market street I shared
the doubt of the many and trembled
lest the Baldwin â our only hope â should
go down to the Frawleya rather than
that the Frawleys should come up to
it. Last week's performance of a cos
tume play was, even with Miss Bates
well to the front and one or two others
doing finely, not a complete assurance.
But last night's performance of the
Daly adaptation, "The Last Word,"
was really a comfort and a surprise.
In the past Mr. Frawley always seemed
opposed to sane stage management and
human ensemble. He sanctioned a sys
tem of stage-manners that would have,
and I dare say often did, shock a police
man. It was only the individual spell
of Frank Worthing, Miss Bates and
other good members of the company
that lent any sort of conviction to the
social pictures that were presented.
Every fellow did and dressed as he
pleased, and the general result was a
picnic of astonishing clothes and wild
deportment.
I don't know that the actors are any
better now; I don't know who manages
the stage, but certainly this Daly
comedy was given last night with meas
ures of harmony, polish and easiness
that were undreamt of in the old Fraw
ley days. It was not a flawless perform
ance, but it had the atmosphere, some
thing of the fanciful eleeance that Mr.
Daly usually gives to his productions.
And Blanche Bates in the Rehan part
of the Baroness Vera added still an
other to her little bunch of first rate
personations. In that scene in the third
act where she pleads with the stormy
papa and tells him the good old Sunday
school story about her little brother
who died, she impressed me as being
much more vivid and much less comical
than Miss Rt-nan. In chronicling Miss
Rehan's performance during the last
Daly season at the Buldwin I protested
politely but strenuously against the
"business" in this scene. Just as Miss
Rehan reached the heart of the little
brother story, vvhich she was telling in
order to melt papa, she turned away
from his cold gray head, rushed down
to the lights and addressed the rest full
front to the rirst violin and the audi
ence. And all the illusion went to
smash. Now Miss Bates is not beyond
copying any Rehan business and man
nerism that will help along the show,
but in this scene at least she works on
her own lines, and to the immense ad
vantage of the play. Her whole per
formance is one of distinction and
imagination. These Daly heroines are
essentially capricious and fanciful, and
Miss Bates' Vera is the essence of
caprice and fancy. In real emotional
work Miss Bates can be unflinchingly
strong and earnest, but In this, which
merely dances over the surface feelings,
she never, forgets that the character
and the play are thoroughly make-be
lieve, and she is always delightful. I
am not much of an authority on Rus
sian dialect, but hers, with its revolv
ing "r's" and winding "w's," is at any
rate melodious if not authentic; and it
may interest the women folk to know
that Miss Bates' gowns are, with the
one exception of the St. Petersburg
kimono in thÂ« second act, quite beauti
ful and becoming.
Mr. Roberts plays the proud papa
and plays him just as Mr. Clarke did
with Daly, too proudly and too solemn
ly for the texture of the part. But the
musician brother is an unobtrusively
clever piece of character as Mr. Keefe
presents him; and Mr. Edwards does a
brilliant fifteen minutes with Moses
Mossap. The young dude is the best
work I have seen at the hnnds of Mr.
Hickman. It is comic to the impossi
ble, with its gilt hair and infantile vi
vacity and decorations of floral cock
tails, but it gives you the fun, and you
almost forgive Miss Wells, the opposite,
for playing up to it in her most goo-goo
key. Mr. Payne makes a fair adven
ture into Russian dialect and pas3ion as
the suspected brother of Vera, and Mr.
Frawley is solemnly himself as papa's
son. I was cheerfully struck with Miss
Adora Andrews, who played the wait
ing maid with all the affability and ele
gance of a real leading lady. There are
some lights that can't be busheled.
But as n whole, you will find "The
Last Word" to be an exceptional Fraw
ley performance. Almost a crowd was
in attendance last night and success
seemed written all over the house.
â¢ ASHTON STEVENS.
Columbia.
In the role of Philip Garth, McKpe
Rankin grave a clean-cut, masterly ex
hibition of acting. In Bill Sykes last
week he was rugged, rough and almost
ranty; in Philip Garth last night he was
gentle, tender, self-contained and showed
without visible effort the one touch of
nature that makes all men kin. The role
was not even melodramatic. The old man
coming out of prison yearning for sym
pHthy had but to weep and his audience
wept with him. When he told his pitiful
story he evoked as much sympathy from
his hearers as he did from the philanthrop
ist on the stage, or from his daughter when
she discovered the relationship existing
between them. Philip Garth would be a
success <>n any stage, in any country and
in any language, for his lines are written
in the universal language of the heart,
thoroughly understandable alike by the
savage and the sage.
The. acting of Miss O'Neil as Mrs. Anna
Dunning was in strong contrast to that of
her tutor. Where he was restrained and
quiet and most effective she was loud and
declamatory. This was unpleasantly no
ticeable in the closing scene of the third
act, when she announces to Baldwin, her
benefactor, that she is going to comfort
her father in his distress and share with
him the ignominy of his name. Other
wise it was only occasionlly that the mus
cular predominated.
The play is melodramatic enough for
the most exacting Bowery audience, but
it would be most risky for a Bowery com
pany on account of the superabundance
of talk and the paucity of action. A
novelty is introduced in the matter of
court procedure, when in the last act the
committing magistrate holds a prelimi
nary examination in his private chambors
without the attendance of the prosreut
ing officers or the attorneys for the de
fendant.
There was only one misfit in the piece.
That was Mrs. Higgins. Her brogue was
of all nations by turns and moved the
weepers to laugh away their tears.
Speaking of tears, the play abounds in
them. The actors wade ankle deep in
them, and the spray thereof spares not
even the orchestra and the man who
plays the muffled dirge on the violin.
"True to Life" is a great hit.
The Orpheum.
The Orpheum's new bill opened strong
with four new acts last evening. Caw
thorne and Forrester come with a very
funny skit entitled, "A Damage Suit," in
which there are any number of funny
complications over a name, of itself noth
ing new, but this couple uses the old ld^a
in an original and taking manner. Mistj
Forrester demonstrated that she has good
grounds upon which to base her claim RS
the May Irwin of the vaudeville stage, for
she has' mastered the genuine "coon swag
ger" and the true Southern dialect, while
Mr. Cawthorne is a comedian far above
the usual line. The Carpos Brothers do
some very neat acrobatic feats, and, as
strong men, surpass any seen here since
the days of Sandow. Mulvay and In
raan were good in their character
changes, and as dancers they excel. As
to the rest of the bill Lew Hawkins is in
front with more new witty monologues.
The Dustins and company in "The Man
Up Stairs " are favorites. The Anglo-
American quartet, the Paolis and the foot
ball dog and the biograph complete an
enjoyable bill.
The Alharnbra.
The vaudeville entertainment at the |
Alhambra Theater last evening deserved
a much larger audience than the artists j
faced when the curtain was raised. 'For i
every part the scenery was appropriate
and the settings in good taste. As might
be expected the tragedian, Robert Dowl
ing, and his company proved a strong'
card, and the presentation of the arena
scene in "The Gladiator" gave the artists
a chance to show what they could do. |
The applause that greeted their efforts !
marked the appreciation of all. Mr. !
Dowling was called before the footlights
and in the garb of a gladiator he made !
a few remarks and then introduced the i
new manager, Harry Jackson. The lat- !
tar was of as a stranger in this !
city, but 'he stated that he Is an old mem- !
ber of San Francisco society, having :
first made his appearance on the stage !
of the old Maguire Theater. He prom
ised the public that go long as he fills
his present position he will always have
the best and latest talent that the coun- I
try affords. His great aim is to make :
the Alhambra a family place of amuse- ;
ment, and nothing of an offensive nature j
shall ever be permitted on the stage.
The Austin sisters, Aimee and Marie,
in their wonderful aerial performances,
won the hearts of the spectators, espe
cially the former, who closed the en
tertainment with "the human fly" feat
of walking on the ceiling. Will I. Rising, ;
Elmer Ellsworth and Miss Lillian Kern- |
bel, vocalists, were well received in their i
rendition of a choice bit from Offen- |
bach's operetta "The Rose of Avergne."
George C. Boniface and Miss Nonna
Ferner afforded pome little amusement
in their one act comedy, "A Game of i
Lobby." The four Olifans, the grotesque I
acrobatic quartet, also shared in the ap- |
plause. Miss Lillian F. Smith's trick rifle j
shooting was very clever.
Grand Opera-House,
The comedy-drama, "The Runaway
Wife," was presented at the Grand
Opera-house last night to an appreciative
audience. The plot is simple, but there
are several striking situations. Lorena
Atwood as the runaway wife scored a suc
cess. The denouement in her son's studio
was well worked up to an Intensely excit
ing climax. Maud Miller was pleasing as
Lillian Haye and Julia Blanc gave a fine
bit of character acting as Hester East
man. James M. Brophy was the husband
and In the last two acts he was particu
larly effective. Fred J. Butler was ex
cellent as Dr. Prescott, the friend in
need. The piece is well staged.
Tivoli.
The ever-popular "Bohemian Girl" was
the attraction at the Tivoli last night,
and the well-known solos and duets were
heartily apjjlauded by the large audi
ence. Mary Linck as the Queen
was the â¢ best the patrons of tne
Tivoli have seen for a long time. Kd
Stevens and Phil Branson made their
reappearance after about three months'
vacation. Next week the comic opera sea
son commences with an elaborate produc
tion of "The Circus Queen."
Alcazar.
The Alcazar's creditable production of
"In Mlzzoura" entered its second week
last night with every prospect of dupli
cating the business of last week. David
Belasco's famous old heart wringer,
"The Wife," Is in preparation to follow.
At the Chutes Theater.
The new programme at the Chutes Free
Theater sparkled with good things and
every furn was well received. The San
key Brothers are the best acrobats ever
seen at the Haight-street grounds, and
they duplicated their Orpheum hit of last
week. Silver and Wyatt make a neat
song and dance team, and Agnes Castor,
a new soprano, is pleasing. Pietro Ma
rino is now an established favorite, and
he had to play five violin numbers. The
"Young Sando'w" and the Japanese acro
bats are wonders in their way. and the
moving pictures are as interesting as ever.
A matinee is given every day.
The Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall was packed
last night to hear (petite Irene Franklin
in her songs and character impersona
tions. She had the house from the start and
was recalled again and again, until her
list of songs in rehearsal was exhausted.
Other favorites wereNadine Allen, Kelly
and Vlolette. Madiline and several others.
Miss Franklin remains this week only.
Charged With Larceny.
William Nesnitt and Julian Nicholas
were arrested last night and charged with
grand larceny. They are accused of steal
ing goods valued at $S0 from a delivery
wagon.

KNIGHT DRAWS
OUT OF THE
COONEY CASE
Says the Proceedings
Are Farcical.
JUDGE WALLACE SURPRISED
NEVERTHELESS THE CASE IS
NOT CONTINUED.
General Belief That the Fair Heirs
Are Not Disposed to Prose
cute the Notary
Public.
When the case of ex-Notary James J.
Cooney, charged with perjury in connec
tion with the Fair-Craven deeds, was
called in Judge Wallace's court yesterday
morning George A. Knight, attorney for
Charles A. Fair, created somefHing of a
sensation by announcing that he would
have nothing more to do with the case,
as he believed that it was a farce.
It has been the general belief for some
time that there was butjittle if any dis
position on the part of the Fair heirs
to prosecute the notary, and it has even
been given out that they would be glad
to have the case dismissed. When the
case was called last Assistant District
Attorney Hinkle asked a continuance
in order that he might confer with
District Attorney Barnes. Hinkle an
nounced yesterday morning that Barnes
would not consent to a dismissal, and
the case was begun.
Before the jury was drawn Attorney
Knight announced his withdrawal. His
statement to the effect that he believed
the trial nothing but a farce was not
tasteful to Judge Wallace, ana when the
latter took exception to it the attorney
repeated his charge. "I am convinced."
tie paid, "that the District Attorney's of
nce will not be able to secure a conviction
and I do not propose to be connected with
a, farcical prosecution."
Cooney's case is a peculiar one in many
ways. He was arrested for perjury dur
ing the trial of the Angus-Craven case. .
The pencil deeds which figured in the
celebrated case purported to have been
acknowledged before Cooney by Senator
Pair. These deeds were adjudged to be
forged. The reluctance of the Fair peo
ple to proseciite the notary is said to be
due to the fact that they believe he was
merely a tool, and as they have been un
able to locate the principals they are un
willing to punish him. Nettie Craven, it
is said, will be a witness for Cooney in
this trial.
When an adjournment was taken at
noon the following jurors had been ac
cepted: Charles H. Hahn, 2128 Howard
street; M. J. Kelly, 1513^5 Mission street;
J. E. Gallagher, U3l Treat avenue; John
G. Costlen, 414 Clayton street; William

street, and Matthew Culllgan, 717 O'Far
rell street.
MEDICAL TEST OF HYPNOTISM.
A remarkably successful test of the
value of hypnotism as a medical agent
was made in Bellevue Hospital of New
York recently.
Willie McCabe, four years old, of 532
East Seventy-sixth street, since New-
Year's day has been saving his pennies
to buy a bicycle. He went with his
mother Monday morning and grot it.
He had several severe falls that day,
and went to bed feverish.
At the breakfast table Willie talked
in a rambling way, fell on the floor, and
had several terrible convulsions. A po
liceman sent an ambulance from Belle
vue Hospital. Dr. Barbour gave the
boy morphine. The drug had no effect.
Dr. Carey, chief of the medical staff,
decided to try hypnotism.
"Willie! Willie!" shouted Dr. Carey.
"Now watch my fingers," said Dr.
Carey, holding the index finger of each
hand close to the boy's face and quietly
urging him all the time to keep his eyes
fastened upon them. Willie did as he
was told for five minutes. Then Dr.
Carey lowered his fingers.
"Now, Willie," said the doctor, "all
your pain is gone, and you will be able
in a moment to ride your bicycle."
The effect of the suggestion was mar
velous. The tense muscles relaxed. The
boy straightened his body to a normal
position, and a smile took the place of.
his expression of torture.
"Now, Willie," said Dr. Carey, firmly,
"it is time to go to sleep."
The eyes drowsily closed, and in less
than ten minutes from the beginning
of the experiment every symptom of
pain had vanished, and the boy fell into
a deep slumber.
"The boy should be able to leave the
hospital to-day," said Dr. Barbour.
"This is a remarkably quick cure for
this malady. It lasts ordinarily for
weeks."â Chicago Tribune.

FAILED AS A LEADER.
WHEN Mayor Phelan went into office there
was a general feeling that a high-toned gen
tleman had reached the executive chair. Even
those who had opposed him were willing to wait be
fore giving a verdict as to his worth.
Mayor Phelan has been a disappointment. In no
particular has he fulfilled the promise held out in the
beginning to gratify friends and reconcile foes. His
official career, in the light of present knowledge, is a
long series of mistakes. It has been found that he
virtually appointed every man in municipal office.
He named the Supervisors and the members of the
Board of Education. This fact is enough to con
demn him.
From the first the record of the Supervisors has
been one of shame. The way in which they dallied
with the water company stamped them as an aggrega
tion where rogues were in the majority. When the
Mayor, disgusted with his own, attempted to oust
them, he adopted illegal means, which defeated the
object in view. The Supervisors have permitted the
construction of the new municipal building to drag.
The} f have granted extensions of time to contractors
who should long ago have forfeited the contract, and
were the same Supervisors to continue in power there
is every reason to suppose these contractors could
have ten years, or a thousand, if they asked for it.
But the record of the School Board has been worse.
They had hardly assumed power before they had sad
dled the people of this city with a lot of useless text
books, some of these verging upon idiocy in their
degree of nselesstvess. Some of the members have
been accused of accepting bribes, and there is every
reason except that of actual conviction to believe the
charges well founded. There has been stealing in the
department such as should send the guilty to the
penitentiary, and there have been hired teachers for
whose services there is no demand. In fact, the de
partment has from the first reeked with scandal, and
it still reeks.
When the fact is remembered that both of these
august bodies were made up of the selections of
Mayor Phelan, a doubt naturally arises as to his fit
ness. Yet the Mayor presumes this year to pick out
a committee of 100, and ostensibly to place in its
hands all the power of the party. We say "osten
sibly" because the whole power rests with the Mayor.
The committee is an idle farce; it is Phelan. When
the Mayor has made such an abject failure of his for
mer selections why should he be intrusted with
authority to name the ticket from top to bottom?
We do not know, and are asking for information.
That we have no confidence in the ticket hardly needs
saying.
It is no wonder that members of this committee
protest and declare they will vote for Patton. It is
no wonder that the Non-Partisans are feeling that
in being cajoled into indorsement of Phelan they
were swindled. They know that the purpose of their
organization did not require them to espouse the
cause of any candidate until his opponent should
have been named, and they resent the imposition.
Phelan will hear from the Non-Partisans on election
day, and the tidings will not please him. while if he
thinks his committee of 100 so hoodwinked as to vote
for him he will be fooled by several.
Two Oakland boys who confessed to petty lar
ceny have been exempted from punishment on the
understanding that they would enlist in the navy.
Judge Ogden was the jurist to arrive at this remark
able conclusion. We agree with the Report that he
should be ashamed of himself. The American nation
takes pride in its navy and does not desire it to be
made a refuge for rogues and rascals. The young
scamps from Oakland are not of the material to up
hold the high standard the navy has set. They should
be promptly rejected. To accept them would be an
Insult to the brave men who fought at Manila or
chased the fleet of Cervera at Santiago.
There is a rumor that the Spanish will refuse to re
linquish the Philippines. This ought to cause the gal
lant Seventh to be less in a hurry to get back to pri
vate life. The members have been pining for a scrap.
There seems to be no hurry on the part of the
Spanish to get out of Cuba. Perhaps the adminis
tration is equal to the task of devising some method
of causing them to get a move.
Talking about hustling the Spanish troops out of
Cuba, and then saying they will all be out by the
first of January gives a new and thoroughly Spanish
idea of the term "hustle."
Happily the crisis in China does not concern the
United States as intimately as it does some other
countries, and we have a Dewey near the spot.
A Cincinnati paper gravely states that the Oregon
and Olympia were built In Portland. For its infor
mation we will state that they were not.
TREASON OF THE BULLETIN.
THERE is nothing surprising in the fact that the
Bulletin is a traitor. Professing to be a Repub
lican paper, its support is for sale to any deluded
candidate who will buy. So notorious is its venality
that indorsement from it is worse than v.orthless, and
the purchaser finds himself in possession of a gold
brick but thinly gilded.
Just what the terms may be on which the Bulletin
supports Phelan is not a matter of particular interest.
But it is a remarkable circumstance that a man
deemed of sufficient intelligence to be Mayor of San
Francisco should have yielded to so palpable a bunko
game. The Bulletin does not throw its supposed in
fluence to any candidate until it has gone through the
formality of a business proceeding.
Immediately after the nomination of Patton he was
called on by a representative of the Bulletin, who
wanted to "do business." The matter got nc farther.
Mr. Patton is not buying the untrammeled opinion of
great journalists, and as a shrewd business man he
knows that even were such a course legitimate the
Bulletin has no influence.
It will be remembered that two years ago the Bul
letin demanded $5000 for supporting the Republi
can ticket. Neither has it been forgotten that within
a year it swindled the business community by the
most shameless confidence scheme a daily paper ever
undertook. Because of these things it is not held in
high esteem, and its support cannot be considered de
sirable. It is a sheet without character and without
influence save of a negative sort. Therefore its edi
torial approval may be regarded as a calamity. And
now, in addition to his other woes, the misguided
Mayor has secured it. We do not approve of Mayor
Phelan. We do not regard him as a reformer nor his
expressions of love for political purity sincere, and
yet we realize he has good points, and would willing
ly have seen him escape the woe of a Bulletin in
dorsement.
While the prospect of defeating the Phelan am
bition is pleasing, The Call and other respectable
journals who view it with satisfaction do not wish the
aid of the Bulletin now made certain. This is a re
spectable contest. The decent papers and the decent
people who hope to see Phelan defeated demur at the
idea that such a bogus editorial output as the Bulle
tin's should be sold to .an unsophisticated dictator
and guileless custodian of jobs.
AFRAID TO SPEAK FOR SILVER.
IX what speech since his campaign opened has
Maguire made an argument for the free coinage of
silver at 16 to i?
He is the candidate of three parties which fused on
silver and nothing but silver. It is'the sole and single
issue upon which they are agreed and upon which
they found common action possible. It is the sole
and only issue upon which the free silver Republicans
cut their connection with their original party. They
are protectionists. They are supporters of the general
policies of McKinley's administration. They indorsed
the President in their platform. They nominated
Maguire on free silver only, and he appeared in their
convention and accepted their nomination and their
platform issue of free silver. But he has been on the
stump for weeks and has said nothing consequential
in favor of silver.
The Populists and free silver Republicans seem to
have been bunkoed. If ever free silver needed a de
fense this is the time. But it is abandoned by the
New York Democracy, and is only slightly flirted
with by that party in several States, with the evident
intention of dropping it when its power to catch
votes is lost.
In 1896 Judge Maguire joined its other advocates
in declaring that the only means of rescue of the
people was by free silver at 16 to 1. The inexorable
logic of events has proved them to have been wrong.
The policies of the Republican party, by restoring
confidence, have restored a degree of prosperity which
seemed impossible in the hard years of 1894, 1895 and
1896.
To show the extent of this restoration we take the
following market reports and prices from the Omaha
World-Herald, of which Mr. Bryan was the editor in
1896, and on whose free transportation he was riding
on the Southern Pacific road on his visit to Califor
nia last year, and -whose proprietor, Mr. Hitchcock,
is the Populist fusion candidate for Congress in the
Omaha district.
The World-Herald market report makes the. fol
lowing showing for 1806 and 1808:

Now, we ask all men whose minds are open to rea
son, is there any reason in these reports of prices,
taken from Mr. Bryan's own paper, for a return to
the conditions of 1806? If politics and parties have
! an economic influence on the welfare of the people,
what present inducement is there for a change? Is
it not plain common sense to let well enough alone?
The above list from the World-Herald covers the
great staples which the farmer produces. Let us look
at some of the staples which he has to buy, and
others.

In 1896 our exports of gold exceeded our imports

our favor and we imported $44,653,200 more gold than
we exported. In 1898, up to September i, our gold
imports exceeded our gold exports by $104,085,283.
We make no argument that in this Government

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1898.
claim that his election is necessary to the material
prosperity of the people, we demand that he answer
specifically and state plainly how and when and where
his success as a fusion candidate is going to further
improve the conditions which have so rapidly im
proved since the same fusion was beaten in 1896.
THE rank and file of the local Democracy can
scarcely "point with pride" hereafter to the rec
ord made by their first appointed municipal con
vention. The Committee of One Hundred comprised
substantially all the dissenting Democrats of the city.
For years these gentlemen have been clamoring for
good government and demanding the overthrow of
the bosses. Many people have been led to believe
that they were not pursuing the offices, but really
were in favor of a pure and undefilcd administration
of the law. Doubtless the Democratic State Commit
tee in appointing them took this view of their mo
tives.
But these "reformers" are now all on record. As
members of the Committee of One Hundred they
have worked from the hour of their selection to get
the offices. First, in defiance of the authority con
ferred upon them they resolved themselves into a mu
nicipal nominating convention; second, in pursuance
of a plan to nominate themselves to office they vio
lated a resolution forbidding the formation of job
chasing combinations; third, they bartered away
everything in the shape of patronage to their relatives
or friends in a vain endeavor to form a political ring
which will carry the election. Mayor Phelan as their
boss has even nominated a man for Tax Collector
who will give them control of the Election Commis
sion.
Among the members of the Committee of One
Hundred who have nominated themselves for office
are the following: Auditor, John H. Grady; City
Attorney, Franklin K. Lane; Treasurer, M. Green
blatt; Superintendent of Schools, James Denman;
Superintendent of Streets, R. P. Doolan; Super
visors, L. de F. Bartlett, Lewis B. Byington, T. B.
W. Leland. Charles A. Clinton; School Director, T.
J. Lyons; State Senate, John F. Twigg and P. J.
McCormick. Besides these A. A. Cavagnaro, brother
of one of the committeemen, has been nominated for
School Director. Numerous attorneys in the body
are said to have secured the patronage of the various
offices for themselves, and other committeemen have
enforced pledges which will bring to them personally
the fat berths within the gift of the Supervisors and
other officials.
Moreover, as is the custom with political bosses^
Mayor Phelan vented some of his personal spites by
means of the power usurped by his job-chasers. He
turned down William Broderick, the best Auditor the
city has ever had, because he has not been able to
control his official action. Although loud advocates
of civil service reform, the committee refused Public
Administrator Freese a renomination. His place was
awarded to a personal friend and adherent of Mayor
Phelan, thus showing that the latter is a civil service
reformer only when his own machinists are bene
ficiaries of the principle.
It is barely possible that these facts are going to
escape the attention of the people of this city and that
they will in ignorance vote these Democratic con
spirators into office, but until events prove this we
may be pardoned for expressing our doubts. But
whatever happens one thing is now thoroughly set
tled: The Democratic "reformers" of the Phelan-
McNab-Barry type are unmasked. In fact, they have
unmasked themselves. Instead of being out for "good
government" they are out for the offices. Their ob
jections to municipal management in the past have
been founded upon nothing except a desire to do the
managing themselves. They are not reformers but
job-chasers.
AS THE BRITISH SEE IT.
AMERICAN elections are more or less interest
ing to the British, and they, are particularly so
when questions of trade and finance are in
volved as in the present one. Consequently what is
now going on in the campaign is attracting a good
deal of attention there. As they view the situation
the most salient feature of the contest between the
parties is that of a possible revival of the free silver
agitation with a resulting disturbance of business.
The National Review, the leading organ of the bi
metallists in Great Britain, concedes that the outlook
for free silver in this country is by no means bright.
Maurice Low, who furnishes for it the monthly re
view of American affairs, says in a recent contribu
tion to its pages:
"So long as the Republican party remains in power
silver is an impossibility, and a revival of the silver
agitation in iooo as violent as that which we saw
in 1896 cannot, in my opinion, occur. Silver is
weaker â much weaker â to-day than it was two years
ago, and as silver has declined the sentiment in favor
of adhering to the existing gold standard has cor
respondingly increased. Mr. Bryan's star reached its
ascendant at the time of his nomination, since then
it has been steadily falling."
The London Statist, on the other hand, while rec
ognizing that the silver movement is for the time
being weak and ineffective, points out that unless
the supporters of sound money are vigilant and
prompt to profit by the advantage of the present sit
uation, the movement may revive. It says:
"It is to be recollected that in two years more the
Presidential election will have to be fought. Nobody
can tell what changes may take place before then,
and it is at least possible that Mr. Bryan may come
forward again, with better chances than now seem
probable. That is no reason why the sound-money
party should not bestir itself without delay to take ad
vantage of the good times and the enthusiasm aroused
by the war to put the currency in an absolutely safe
condition."
The view taken by the Statist is undoubtedly cor
rect. The time hns come to settle the money ques
tion once and for all. The present House of Repre
sentatives is strongly in favor of sound money. The
hold of the silverites on the Senate is weakening. If
the supporters of the gold standard and a wise bank
ing system exercise due vigor in the elections, the
coming Congress can be counted on to put our cur
rency on an absolutely safe basis and assure the
financial prosperity of the people.
According to the stones told by volunteers re
turned from Cuba the Spanish there were guilty of such
treachery as naturally tends to destroy faith in the
diplomacy of that country-
It would be a pity were that grand old man of Ver
mont, Morrill, to retire from the Senate. His bur
den should be made light and his honors continue to
the end.
Frenchmen keep on having duels over the Dreyfus
case. These affairs lend to a tragic episode a divert
ing element of comedy.
Spain seems to forget that she has been warring,
and to think any concession she may make will be
in the nature of a favor.
PHELfIN'S JOB - CHASERS.
MAGUIRE'S WORK ON
THE FUNDING BILL
Some Interesting correspondence has
passed recently between George W. Mon
teith and James G. Maguire, the fused
candidate for Governor. Mr. Monteith
has openly announced his intention not
to vote for Mr. Maguire. while support
ing the Populist-Democratic ticket gen
erally. In an interview yesterday Mr.
Monteith said:
"It is true that I am not supporting
James G. Maguire for Governor, and I
have no hesitation in giving my reasons.
When I went to Sacramento last July
I had given the political situation but lit
tle study, having been engrossed for
some time with the Railroad Commission
case. I represented Marin County, and
being alone cast her four votes. On my
arrival there I found a strong faction
that wanted to nominate Magutre and
make a fusion arrangement, and one, per
haps stronger, that was opposed to all
fusion and that wanted a straight ticket.
Most of the latter faction favored Mr.
Shanahan for Governor. Between these
two there were some delegations who
were undetermined, but who leaned to
ward a straight ticket. Some of these
wanted me to be the nominee, and It is
possible they could have forced it. I did
not want it, and refused to go Into the
race.
"What I did want above all else was to
make a clean anti-railroad fight, and while
opposed to fusion on any other ground
favored it simply as a means to accom
plish the end of the railroad's domina
tion of the government of this State.
"As to Maguire, while I had always be
lieved In and warmly supported him, I
had strong personal reasons for opposing
him. These, however, I was entirely will
ing to put aside in case he was the man
to lead the battle against the monopoly.
I did not for a moment doubt his sin
cerity as an anti-railroad leader, and upon
thinking it over linally concluded tuat
he was the one man to take the lead.
"At that time I was ignorant of what
I have since learned was his action on
the refunding measure which passed Con
gress as a rider upon the deficiency bill.
"That proposition was embodied in an
amendment to tlÂ»e general deficiency bill,
offered by Senator Morgan in the Senate
on June 29 -last, with unanimous con-
Bent, both White and Perkins being pres
ent, and passed with an amendment of
fered by White the same day.
"The amendment was further amended
by Judge Barham in the House, and pass
ed thai body July 5 or 6.
"The Populist convention met July 12,
so the Congressional Keeord did not reach
California until after Mugulre was nom
inated. 1 had only scan the meager ac
count in the newspapers, and like many
others supposed that Huntington had
finally won the tight by a nick. Maguire
hud opposed it, and I, in common with
every one else here, thought it was a bad
. measure, and that he had done all he
could to defeat it.
On Maguire's return, shortly before the
Democratic convention, he denounced It
unqualifiedly, and at the same time bit
terly attacked Senator Morgan, then in
Honolulu, who, he intimated, had sur
rendered to Huntlngton. He also severe
ly criticised Congressman Barham, who
replied to him in an open letter, pub
lished August 14, and to which Maguire
made a rejoinder on August 15. Barham's
statement and Maguire's reply 1 did not
read until the Sunday after I returned
from the Democratic convention in Sac
ramento, when my attention was called
to both by my wife. I then looked up
Maguire's Bpeech, and concluded that
something was wrong.
As soon as I could get away I went
over to Oakland, where 1 got a copy of the
Congressional Record from a club over
there located on Washington street. The
following Sunday 1 made a careful exam
ination of the Record and much to my
surprise found that, if Muguire's asser
: tion was true that the Morgan amend
i nient was such an infamous surrender
to Huntington as he claimed it was, he
appeared to be morally particeps crim
inls to the infamy by not stopping it, as
1 it was apparent he could have done so.
There were some matters involved in
'â  more or less doubt that might have been
In his favor, and so I concluded to write
! and ask him about them, thinking he
' would have no hesitation In answering
them. I wrote him this letter on August
31st:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 31. 1898.
James G. Magulreâ Dear Sir: 1 have been
examining the .Cong regional Record lately with
reference to the funding proposition whloh
I passed Congress as a rider upon the deficiency |
l bill. I have also read your speech delivered j
! on your return, Mr. liarham's statement and
your reply to it, and, to be frank with you.
It looks to me as though you had not fulfilled
! your duty in the premises. However, as I do
', not want to do you any injustice, 1 would like
to a.-^k you a lew questions concerning some
i matters that I would like to hear your side of.
I The amendment came before the Senate June
r.\ and Senator Morgan stated that it had the
unanimouÃ approval of the Pacllic Railroad
Committee. From the Record it would seem
that you knew of the proposition before June |
; 29. and it also appears that you attended some
; conference at which this matter was discussed.
Upon this part ot the niatter I would like to
ask you the following questions:
Firstâ Did you know of the Morgan amend
ment or of his intention to offer some kind of
an amendment or bill upon the subject prior
to June 29?
ndâ Did you discuss thÂ« matter with Sen
ator White on or prior to June 2a?
Thirdâ When did you obtain the first intima
tion or information that the refunding proposi
tion would come up in any form In June or
July last?
Fourthâ Did you attend any conference at
which the refunding proposition was discussed,
either as Senator Morgan offered it or as It was
proposed to offer it for the consideration of
either house of Congress in the session just
closed?
Fifthâ When you received the first intimation
you had that the refunding niatter waa to
come up either in the form !t did or In any
other form, did you notify the committee of
fifty or any other of the interested parties here,
or did you give the item to the newspapers,
and, If so, when and how soon after you first
learned of It? '
Sixth â Did you make any effort to get any |
Senator to prevent the matter being tacked on
to the deficiency bill by making the solitary
objection that was necessary?
Seventhâ What did you do to prevent action
In the Senate, If anything?
As I understand your position It Is this: That
the only opportunity you had to have a vote
upon the bill thut would determine the senti
ment of the House was the final vote upon the
motion Â«f Mr. Cannon to concur. Under the
circumstances It was clearly your duty and
| the duty of every other California Congressman
to exhaust every possible remedy known to
parliamentary tactics to have prevented the
pamn of that infamous measure. That being
true, if you failed to do anything which might
have been done you were derelict. You claim,
1 believe, that under the rules of the House
there was nothing which you could have done
to have prevented that refunding proposition
becoming a law except to have beaten it upon
llnal vote. I think you are wrong in this par
ticular, but as you are more familiar with the
rules than I am I will ask you one c two
questions upon that point.
i 'n page 7463 of the Record appears a colloquy
between yourself and Cannon, after whi.-h the
conference report was adopted without any ob
jection from you. Could you not at this point
that is, before the motion was made to adopt
the report, or as a substitute for the report,
have made a motion that the conference report
be rejected and a further conference be re
quested under Instructions, whereby the House
j would inform the Senate that it would recede
I frum all Us points of difference contained In the
report, saving that relating to amendment num
ber 30, and that the House would not concur In
that amendment?
Would not such a motion or something similar
to It have been In order and could it not have
been utilized both to debate the question and to
determine the sentiment of the House at that
time? In other words, upon the presentation
of the conference report, on July 6, could you
not have taken such action as would have
enabled you to have discussed and beaten the
proposition before you got into the tangle into
which Mr. Cannon so craftily led you?
It seems to me that the moment you let this
opportunity slip you placed yourself at his
mercy and lost the battle the people of Califor
nia have been fighting for six years.
. I am giving thin matter a very careful exam
ination and intend shortly to publish the result
of my investigation and 1 will be frank and
tell you that sn far as I have examined It It
has been a complete revelation to me. Indeed,
1 am stunned when I realize what it all means!
In the Congressional Record of August I ap
pears your speech upon that debate, and my
undemanding is that only a portion of It was
actually delivered and that the letters and tele
grams on page 7776 and the resolution of the
Legislature were not actually read In the de
bate. Am I right or wrong about this? I should
esteem it a favor If you will answer these ques
tions, and do not want to resolve the mat
ters they contain against you unless compelled
to do so by your refusal to answer the ques
tions.
You. of couraft, understand that since I with
drew from the fusion arrangement I am
not supporting your candidacy for Governor a
matter which you will doubtless regard as of
no especial moment, but which I mention
merely to show you that I am not writing you
from the standpoint of one of your supporters
When we gave you the Populist nomination iii
Sacramento we were sadly deceived as to some
very important mattersâ a matter I do not care
; to discuss at this time, but will take it ud in
detail later on.
Trusting that you will find it agreeable to
give me the Information I seek, I remain,
respectfully yours,
P. S.â Have you any objection to sending me
a marked copy of your speech of July 5, with
those portions marked which were added after
the debate, as it Is very important for those
of us who arp Interested in this matter to know
exactly what you said when you were engaged
in making this fight.
He sent me this reply the same day:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 31, 1898.
George W. Montt-lth Esq.â Dear Sir: Your
letter of this date Is at hand.
I must decline to enter Into any personal con
troversy with you concerning the matters there
in discussed. Your suggestion that an objection
made by me, or by any member of Congress,
would have rendered it Impossible for the
House to reach a vote on the general defi
ciency bill, embodying appropriations for over
if war deficiencies, as well as the
Pacific Railroad refunding provision, is so ab
surd as to be irrational. The party In con
trol of the House can, at any time, through
its committee on rule?, bring any proposition
up for <fcmslderatlon and action. Respectfully,
JAMES G. MAGUIBB.
His letter was both insulting and evas
ive. I sought no controversy; simply
wanted facts. Then he proceeds to an
swer a question 1 did not cLsk and a prop
osition not involved in my letter. I
neither said nor intimated that his ob
jection "would have rendered it impossi
ble for the House to reach a vote on the
general deficiency bill." He first puts up
that man of straw, and then knocks him
down. What I do claim is that if Ma
guire had sincerely wanted to he could
nave prevented the Morgan amendment
becoming a law, and if he denies that
proposition I will take the affirmative of
it and debate it with him before any au
dience in the State and stand or fall upon
my ability to prove it.
However, although I thought his reply
discourteous and uncivil, nevertheless I
concluded to overlook his want of good
manners and make another effort to get
the facts, so 1 wrote this letter:
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 5, IS3B.
James O. Maguire Esq.â Dear Sir: Your let
ter of August 31 was received during my ab
sence from the city, and I will once more ad
dress you upon the subject. If you would read
over my letter of August 31 you will see that
there Is no purpose to enter Into what you are
pleased to term a personal controversy. I sim
ply asked you a few questions which I had a
perfect right to ask of any gentleman under
similar circumstances, and which I had a per
tei i right to expect would be answered in the
same spirit in which they were asked, which
was simply the desire to know the facts. You
are a public man, seeking" a high office, you
have been a public servant for a number of
years, and the questions which I asked cer
tainly affect your standing before the public.
When I wrote the letter I was impressed with
the idea that if the impression I had formed
from reading the Congressional Record was
erroneous, your natural sense of justice
would lead you to warmly welcome an oppor
tunity to put yourself right by promptly and
unequivocally denying the propositions Involved
in those questions. I told you frankly that it
was my purpose to exploit this whole funding
bill question. There is a feeling abroad among
the people that you did not fill the fullest
measure of your duty upon that occasion, and
I secured the Congressional Record and made
a careful examination of all it contains. In
addition to that, I considered in evidence the
Utter of Judge Barham of August 14, your re
ply upon August lo and your speech at Metro
politan Hall delivered on your return from the
East, From the Congressional debate I gather
the impression that you knew of the Morgan
proposition before It was offered in the Senate,
and if that la true you certainly had notice of
the matter in time to have sounded the alarm
In California. Then I have been unable to
ascertain that you ever sent any information
here to those of us who were interested in the
fight, or did anything to enable us to have
stirred up a determined opposition to this
matter.
From the Congressional Record it appears
that you and Senator White were in full ac
cord upon this question, and if so you were
equally responsible with him for the action
in tne Senate, where a single Senator's objec
tion would have killed Morgan's amendment.
In your public statements you have acknowl
edged that the Barham amendment so sugar
coated the bill that a number of Republicans
swallowed it who would have otherwise been
against it enough, you admit, to have beaten
it, and your objection would have killed Bar
ham's amendment, leaving the bill In an un
paiatable condition, that would have insured
enough opposition to have beaten it, as it pased
by but ten votes. You excuse your failure to
object of this critical moment upon the plea
that you did not then know the temper of the
House, and had no way to ascertain It. As
against that position, we find in the Record
the fact that you permitted the conference re
port to be adopted without objection, when
you could at that time, and before Barham's
amendment was offered, have precipitated a
debate, which If your own estimate of the sit
uation is true, would have resulted In its de
feat, at least It would have enabled you to
have determined the standing of the House
upon the question wlthou* the matter being
complicated by Barham's amendment. One of
the questions I asked you related to the parll
mentary situation at that stage, and of course
you are open to one avenue of escape, which Is,
that they outgeneraled you, and you didn't
sufficiently understand the procedure of the
House to have enabled you to take advantage
of the situation. Unnn that point would rise
the question of your bona fides In the case
and we might be influenced In Its determina
tion by what you said on the floor of the
House. The speech printed In the Congressional
Record, which you obtained leave to print,
Is. I understand, a different speech from the
one actually delivered. That Is of course a
right which Congressmen assume, but one
that Is hardly expedient to exercise at a criti
cal moment, when every argument of any
weight should be advanced before rather than
after the vote Is taken, provided, of course,
that the pur, o?e of the argument is to influ
ence the vote on the bill, rather than to secure
the applause of a confiding constituency. This
will explain why I asked you the questions con
tained in my former letter, and I think If you
will calmly consider the matter that you will
find that It would be much better to answer
the questions In detail. It will not take long
to do so, and if you will answer them fairly
and frankly, and If your course has been a
proper one. they will settle the whole matter
in your favor.
I know that you feel unfriendly toward me,
but this is not a question of friendship, but
one of good faith, and one In which any per
sonal feelings we may have should be wholly
eliminated. The facts are all I ask, and you
surely do not wish to place yourself In the un
fortunate position of refusing to state them,
when their statement can do no harm, but may
ili i ymi much good.
Will you not then kindly look over my former
letter and give me a frank answer to each of
the questions, and I will assure you that I
will deal justly and fairly with you, which Is
my only purpose In this matter. We have,
many of us, despite our personal feelings,
given you our fullest and highest measure of
confidence, and it would be an awful thing
to find out now that that confidence has been
misplaced. I cannot believe that we could
have made so great a blunder, and it is pos
sible that the ill-feeling that may exist be
tween you and myself may be the reason that
you refuse to answer my questions, and giv
ing you the benefit of the doubt I now appeal
to "Â«u to put aside any personal feeling you
may have, and put me right If I am wrong.
Very truly yours.
This letter Magnire never answered,
and, as I understand, refuses to answer.
I talked it over with John P. Dunn, and
lj.e urged me not to publish the corre-
Bpeadence as Mr. Hutchison want.'J to
talk it over with me. Hutchison, who is
a good friend of mine, afterward talked
with me about it. and I showed it to him
and told him if Maguire would truthfully
and satisfactorily answer those questions
I would heartily support him. Hutchison
thought he could get him to do so, but
up to this time has not succeeded.
I saw Senator Morgan the other day
and had a long talk with him about It.
He was very much surprised to learn that
MaguLre had questioned his motives in
the matter. He said that he was fully
satisfied with the measure Under the cir
cumstances, and would stand on his rec
ord, and very sarcastically remarked that
if Maguire could Ret elected Governor by
running him (Morgan) down he guessed
he could stand it; he even thought that
as a good Democrat he, perhaps, ought to
be willing to suffer that much to get a
Democratic Governor elected in Califor
nia.
Senator Morgan then carefully explained
to me the whole situation. He said he
and Maguire never had agreed upon the
proper way to treat the Pacific railroads.
Magulre always favored foreclosure In the
courts, while ho (Morgan) favored legis
lative action whereby The Government
would seize and operate the roads on the
ground they were forfeited to the Gov
ernment when the owners became delin
quent. Foreclosure, the Senator said,
meant either the full payment, as was
done in the case of the Union Pacific, of
the debt to the Government, principal and
interest, or a long season of difficult and
perhaps doubtful litigation and under cir
cumstances where the railroad owners
would have a manifest advantage.
Senator Morgan said the reason he and
Maguire never agreed was simply because
he favored seizure and Maguire firmly ad
hered to foreclosure. When Maguire's
plan was followed in the case or the
I'nion Pacific a precedent in favor of a
cash settlement was established which
seemed to meet with general approval.
AVith that precedent in view he expected
that the owners of the Central Pacific
would do likewise, and that the Govern
ment would get its sixty millions In cash.
When he was finally assured of that fact
Senator Morgan consented to the settle
ment upon the condition that all the
money recovered from the Pacific rail
roads should be placed in trust to be
used for the construction of the Nicara
gua canal, and upon that basis the Sen
ate Pacific Railroads Committee came to
a unanimous agreement which is em
bodied in the amendment he offered to
the deficiency bill known as amendment
Senator Morgan said, furthermore, that
if Judge Maguire had asked him to with
hold the amendment so that the peoyle
of California could have a hearing in op
position to it he would undoubtedly have
done ko, and even if he had not, there
were plenty of Senators who would nayo
made the single objection needed. He
said it could have been easily stopped in
the Senate if Judge Maguire had madÂ©
the effort. , -
I asked the Senator if Maguire knew or
the matter before June 29, when it came
up in the Senate. He replied that he per
sonally had no conversation with Ma
i quire, but did talk it over with Senator
i White many times before then, and that
Maguire must have known about it. for it
waa under consideration at least twenty
days before it was offered. The amend
i ment, he said, was only in part his. It
: was, as Maguire certainly knew, before
I the Pacific Railroads Committee for
' months, but was not agreed to until Mor-
I gan's consent was obtained, and he gave
that only when convinced that the gov
ernment would get* every dollar of its
! money, and when the n-st of the commlt
j tee agreed to his proposition to use the
I money to construct the Nicaragua Canal.
I Morgan simply added that portion to it,
! and when it was all agreed on consented.
; to offer the proposition as amended by
himself as an amendment to the deficiency.
! bill. Senator Morgan's explanation puts
i an entirely different phase on the whole
matter and shows why Maguire is op
posed to getting into any "personal con
troversies."or any controversies at all, for
that matter.
Morgan is undoubtedly right in his po
sition that the Government has the pow
er to seize the road. He has been right
and Maguire wrong. Morgan realized that
the only way to kill the monopoly and
give the people of California relief was
by effective competition either through
Government ownership and operation or
the Pacific railroads or through the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal.
He wanted the Government to get
the railroad, Maguire wanted it to get the
cash. On the Morgan plan we would get
! just what every Populist in the land is
fighting for, viz.: Government owner
ship and operation at cost; and on the
Maguire plan the Government would get
sixty millions of dollars, which the rail
, road owners, as in the case of the Union
! Pacific, would water and add to their
| capitalization, and thus impose an ad
. dltional burden upon the people, who in
: freight and passenger rates would pay the
piper. By using the money to construct
the Nicaragua canal Senator Morgan haa
! found a way to mitigate tHe evil of tak
ing those railroads away from the peoDle,
I who could have had them if Senator Mor
1 gan, the best friend California ever had,
j could have had his way.
For these reasons I shall oppose tha
, election to the highest office in this State
I of the man who seeks to advance his can
! didacy by traducing the gray-haired o.d
:': ' hero, whose every act and every impulse
has been to rescue monopoly ridden Cali
: fornia from the domination of Collis ir".
j Huntlngton.
"Do you intend to oppose the whole fu
; sion ticket? " was asked of Mr. jion
! teith.
"Not by any means. I shall vote fo*
j Mr. Hutchison for Lieutenant Governor,
Maples for Controller and Runkel for
School Superintendent, who are Populists;
Judge Van Dyke and Judge Conley for
Supreme Judges, R. A. Thompson for Sec

; Equalization. For Governor I shall write

many Populists will cio the same, al
, though some will vote for Harriman, tne

MRS. A. J. FENNELL'S
CLAW IS DEFEATED
DECISION IN FAVO3 OF COLONEL
MABCEAU.
Hs Did Not Misappropriate Funds
Belonging to J. Allen Fiske,
the Plaintiff's Ward.
Mrs. Amanda J. Fennell has met defeat
in her suit against Colonel Theodore C.
Marceau, her former husband, to recover
$3000 belonging to the estate of J. Allen
Fiske, her ward, which she alleges was
misappropriated by Marceau in August of
1893. Mrs. Fennell alleged that she grave
the money to her then husband to trans
fer from one bank to another, but he
appropriated it to his own use. This Mar
ceau denied and stated that on March 18,
1896, he and Mrs. Fennell had an account
ing and settlement of financial affairs, and
at that time all claims held by Mrs. Fen
nell against him, and all claims he held
against her, were adjusted.
In the decision the court says:
I do not feel that plaintiff has succeeded In
establishing this alleged fact. The guardian
cays that such was the case; defendant says
that it was not. The guardian is In no way
corroborated by the evidence, while the cir
cumstances surrounding the transaction do
corroborate defendant's version.
To accept the version of. the guardian the
court must find that she, a woman of mature
years and with some experience in life, with
out any reason therefor and with no other mo
tive than a mere desire to change the place of
deposit of funds from a savings bank, where
Interest was being paid, to a commercial bank,
where no interest would be earned. This is bo
improbable that It discredits the guardlan'3
version of the transaction and produces the
conviction that defendant's account is the more
likely. Judgment for defendant.

LOOKING TOR A SITE.
Military Hospital May Be Erected
at Black Fjint.
The question of the location of the
general military hospital, that has been
ordered to be erected here by tlw War
Department, is causing the medical de
partment no little worry. Colonel Mid
dleton, the surgeon in chief of the depart
ment "i" California, has for the pas; few
days been considering the matter of a
site for the hospital, and he has encount
er. â¢(} many obstacles. The main object
that he has had in view has been to find
a pr >per site that would have a sufficient
and convenient water supply. The exam
lon <>f Angel Island, which was at
first decided upon, disclosed the fact that
' there was not a sufficient water supply,
and In addition, there was only one point
1 upon the island that was level enouijn
for the erection of the building and there
was no water near it. At least 20,000 gal
lons of water would be required each <la\
for the hospital, and on account of thir.
fact the queetlon of water becomes one
of great importance. Colonel Middleton
Stated yesterday that he hoped to find a
site in "a few days. He has Black Point
under consideration, and it is more than
probable that it is there that the hospital
will be erected. The hospital la to be a
temporary affair and will be built of

THE YEAR'S WINES.
Taken as a whole the reports we pub
lish this month from the wine-produc
in~ centers of Europe are fairly satis
factory. From Bordeaux we learn that
the vines are going on well, and that,
down to the time of gathering, the
quality will probably be superior to
last year's, although the quantity
must be unequal, considerable damage
having been done in some districts by
c ulure. In the champagne country the
vines present a tine appearance, and
hi"-h hopes are entertained In respect of
both quantity and quality. Our Cognac
correspondent states that the vineyards
in Charente are for the most part in a
promising condition, and an equally
favorable report comes from Beaune.
According to an official estimate, the
French vintage will be very good in six
departments and good in twenty oth
ers, but for the most part it will be only
"fairly good." From Oporto we learn
that great inconvenience is being
caused by the prolonged drought, and
our correspondent states that, if there
should be no rain within the next few
weeks, the vintage will he ruined. In
any event the will be short, but
the gathering will probably he unusu
ally early. In the sherry country the
new ..merican plantations are promis
ing well, but our correspondent at
Jerez-de-la-Frontera sends an alarming
account of the great progress made by
the phylloxera In the Important dis
tricts of Macharnudo and Carrascal,
while the vineyards of Ducha are said
to be completely destroyed. In Germany
the quantity will be small, owing to
coulure and to disease of the vine, but
it is hoped that the quality will make
amends' for the reduced yield. â London

THE DEATH OF COACHING.
The coaching system died a lingering
âa lamentable death. I can remember
something of a few coaches in remote
districts which longest escaped strangu
lation, and memory of those distant
days has been sweeter without them.
T..ey resemble what Nimrod describes
as the obsolete, old-fashioned coach of
his boyhood, drawn by dispirited, 111
fed jadefl over long stages. One of his
paragraphs well describes what used to
m ike my blood boil with Impotent fury,
embittering the joy of returning home
for the holidays, and deeping the de
pression of the schoolward journey:
"The four-horse whip and the Not
tingham whipcord were of no avail
over the latter part of the ground, and
bo nething like a cat-o'-nine-talls was
! dv :ed out of the boot, which was
jocularly called 'the apprentice'; and
a shrewd apprentice it was to the art*
of torturing, which waÃ inflicted on the
wheelers without stint or measure, but
without which the coach might have

INVENTION FOR SEA SIGNALING
An important invention for signaling
at sea during the night hus but re
cently been patented by the German
telegraph official, L. M. N. Voelckers.
The new apparatus consists of a strong
metal box, which is fastened at a high
point near the stern of the vessel.
within the box a plate-glass mirror is
placed lengthwise, the surface of the
n:irror being dotted with light yellow
color. In front of this mirror si^ns
of galvanized tin are are placed, in
which the letters to be signaled are
cut <>ut. ThÂ» insido of the box is then
intensely lighted, and the signal is then
visible for several miles. Heretofore
Bteamere could signal at night time
only by the burning of rockets, estab
lishing the name of the line to which
they belonged, but now it will be possi
ble to convey the steamer's name or
other information according to the sig
nal code during clear nights as well,
an improvement which may be of the
greatest importance for avoiding acci
dents or danger.â Seaboard.

Mail.
The Bteamer South Coast had an ex
perience with the raft of piles that Cap
tnin Zaddurt will not forget in a hurry.
Like the Santa Rosa the South Coast was
right on top of the "menace to naviga
tion" before It was seen. Then the cap
tain reversed the engines but was too
late to avert a collision. The South Coast
struck the raft a glancing blow that made
every one of her timbers groan and
brought everybody on board up standing.
No great damage was done and the
steamer came on to San Francisco with
her cargo of beans and corn.
Captain Zaddart, in his report, says:
"At 2 a. m. on the 3d inst. we passed a
large raft of piles about 250 feet long
four miles west of Pigeon Point. The raft
seems to be in good condition, but is very
dangerous to navigation." This makes
two narrow escapes for steamers. The
next one to strike the raft may bÂ© at
full speed and may go down with all
hands.
The Chamber of Commerce has taken
the matter up and yesterday communi
cated with the Secretary of the Treasury
on the matter. After stating the facts
the letter concludes: "We earnestly re
quest that you will take such steps as,
in your good judgment, may seem best
to have this dangerous practice of tow
ing 1 log or timber rafts at sea stopped,
and thereby remove an unnecessary risk
to navigation."
The torpedo boat destroyer Farragut
exceeded her contract speed yesterday.
Unfortunately her starboard engine broke
down and it will be three weeks before
the frail but fast vessel can have another
trial. She made throe attempts yester
day. On the first she made twenty-four
knots, on the second twenty-eight knots
and on the third thirty and seven-tenths
knots, and then the rock shaft broke.
The only quest! with the builders now
is "By how mucii will the Farragut ex
ceed thirty knots?"
The Mail Bteamer City of Peking did
not get away yesterday, although she
had steam up and took a turn around
the bay. The new piston follower was
put aboard yesterday at 2 p. m.. and an
hour later the vessel was under way.
She steamed over to Alcatraz and there
came to an anchor. She will probably
get away on her voyage to the Orient to
day.
The Peking takes away a very valua
ble cargo. Her Chinese consignments
;,r^ valued at J115.1M2, and her Japanese
at $5y,01T. Among the stuff for China is
66 baits of seaweed and 20 tons of lard,
while Japan takes among hers 84,034 feet
of lumber and Ouo pounds of oleomarga
rine. She also takes away goods ror
Sourabaya, Batavia, Bankok, Samantng,
Colombo, Manila, Penang. Calcutta, Sin
gapore, Vladivostok and Korea in tran
sit. In her cargo for Vladivostok are 45
anchors, and among that for Korea are
three phonographs.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
i'teamer Gipsy will sail to-day on her
fifteen hundredth trip, a record
that has never been equaled on this
roast. During that time she has earned
more money for Goodall, Perkins & Co.
than any other two vessels of their fleet.
The Gipsy was originally built for the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company to car*
ry combustibles in the San Diego trade.
She was sold to the Pacific Coast people
soon after she was completed, however,
and has been running on the various
routes operated by them ever since.
Nearly all the captains in the com
pany's service graduated from the Gip
sy. Captain C. Miner Goodall felt three
inches taller in the days of long ago when
he was promoted to be master of the
stout little vessel. When under command
of the late Captain Plummer she was
christened "old perpetual motion," and
the name has clung to her ever since.
Captain Charles Hall, late of the Cleve
land, commanded her for a time, as did
also Captain Jepsen, now of the Queen,
und Captain Green of the Columbia. She
was also a great favorite with the late
Captain Wallace, and he would not
It-avu her â  for a larger vessel. Captain
Qlelow is now in command of the Gipsy.
Owing to a delay in the arrival of the
English mail the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany's steamer Alameda will not get
away for Australia until Thursday next
at 2 p. m. She will take away over sev
enty passengers for Honolulu and thirty
eight cabin passengers for New Zealand
and Australia. Among the latter will be
Mrs. Chenery, -who has been the guest of
Mrs. C. H. Graham during her stay in
this city.
Dr. If all, who was very ill when the
Alameda arrived in port, has resigned his
position and Dr. Nelson, a well-known
and popular young physician of this city,
will go out in his place.
The Alaska Commercial Company will
have three large steamers on the St.
Michael run next sprlmg. The Bertha is
to be cut in two and lengthened forty feet.
New machinery will be put in and when
the alterations are completed the Bertha
will be a nrat-elass vessel in every respect,
tit to run in connection with the Portland
and St. Paul, the company's other fine
ocean steamers.
The Excelsior Coal and Screening Com
pany and the Harbor Commissioners are
at (juts. The company has thirteen coal
hoppers on the various wharves owned
by the State and refuses to pay any rent
for the privilege.. Captain Roberts, man
ager of the concern, has been warned
again and again during the past five
months, but has paid no attention. Tues
day last the board notified him that if
the rent was not paid or the hoppers re
moved by this morning the State would
move them and charge him with the
cost, a/id yesterday Assistant Chief
Wharfinger Scott went around to all the
en;; I ships using the hoppers and notified
them that they would be removed to-day
and told them to govern themselves ac
cordingly. Roberts threatens to sue out
an Injunction ami says he will resist the
removal of his hoppers, so there Is liable
to be trouble, when the moving begins.

On Saturday, October 15, the greatAVal
laee shows will open in this city, and, if
the .advance reports prove true, it will be
the biggest thing in the way of a circus
ever seen here. The big tents will be
pitched in Central Park.
All .sorts of new attractions are prom
ised by the big posters, and the manage
ment of the show boasts that it never ad
vertisea an act that is not given in the
regular performances. The show is a big
three-ring affair with a fine menagerie at
tached. It is claimed that" the horses are
the linest to be found in any cirrus, and
the usual number of trick riders has been
mure than doubled. The names of the
principal ridi.-rs are: Louise de Mott,
Adelia Nelaon, Gracie Thomas. Winnie

FLUME COMPANY WINS.
Water Rates Fixed hy Supervisors
Do Not Supersede Pri
vate Contracts.
Tn the case of the San Diego Flume
Company, appellant, vs. C. H. Souther and
YV. S. Crosby, the United States Court of
Appeals yesterday set aside the decree of
the lower court, dismissing the cross bill
and the bill, and remanded the case to
the Circuit Court for further proceed
ings.
Souther & Crosby had brought suit
against the flume company to cancel a
written contract. It was alleged that the
flume company made two contracts with
the plaintiffs to furnish them water for ir
rigation in the year IS9O, and that on
June 7, 1594, the company diverted irom
them more than half the water so con
tracted for, and continued diverting it
until December 8 of the same year. On
October 2, 1594, the plaintiffs rescinded the
second contract.
The defendant denied that the contract
was rescinded, and asked for the recov
ery of $2160 alleged to be interest due on
the contract of March, IS9O, and $6000 dam
ages The defendant claimed that it had
a right to divert the water complained of
because there had been a drought, and
that it had furnished the plaintiffs with
what water was left after the cities and
towns had been supplied
In rendering its decision the Circuit
Court of Appeals say that corporations
engaged in the business of furnishing
water for irrigation under the laws of
California, whether they acquire the
water by appropriation of the waters of
the State or otherwise, are private cor
porations. They are nowhere declared
to be public corporations or quasi-public.
They conduct their business for private
gain It appears from the pleadings and
from the evidence that neifher of the par
ties to the suit had made the rate so fixed
by ordinance applicable to them, but con
tinued to recognize the contract of March
1890, as controlling their dealings one with
the other. In the cross bill no attempt s
made to assert rights under the ordi
nance The prayer of the bill is confined
"o the petitions for relief under the con
tract. ''

THE LUCK OF A SPECULATOR.
During the rage for new joint stock
companies which followed the passing
of the limited liability acts, the great
discounting business of Overend, Gur
ney & Co. was transferred to a new
companyâ Overend, Gurney & Co.,
Limited. This took place In 1865. and in
the year before, as we learn from Mr.
Turner's "Chronicles of the Bank of
England," from September to March
263 companies were formed, with a
nominal capital of over Â£75,000,000. Of
these new companies, twenty-seven
were banking and fifteen discounting
companies. It may be added that
"cheap money" and the enormous
profits of company promoting have
caused an even greater outburst of
joint Btocking activity during the last
three years, the effect of which will
probably cause some interesting results
before the end of the century. But to
return to our story. There were very
extensive dealings on the Stock Ex
change in the shares of all these new
companies and the public bought hand
over fist.
A jobber who had a very large con
nection found that owing to the strong
demand for these shares he had in the
ordinary course of business sold to the
brokers who came to deal with him
many more shares than he could pos
sibly buy back except at an enormous
loss which would inevitably bring him
down. The state of his book was such
that one Friday morning, finding that
no one was a seller and that every bar
pain that he made added to his liability
to provide securities which he could not
buy, he left the market and strolled
westward to luncheon at a well-known
restaurant to take counsel with him-
Belf over a bottle of the best as to
whether he should declare himself a
defaulter at once or make a further
effort to carry out his bargains and
tide over the evil day with temporary
assistance.
Returning to the city, still dubious
and despairing, he met a crowd of peo
ple rushing wildly, as if the bottom of
the universe had fallen out. He seized
a small boy by -the nape of the neck
and asked him what was amiss. "Over
end's busted," said the urchin and
rushed on again. The news, which
brought ruin to thousands on that
Black Friday meant fortune to our job
ber. The shares which he had sold at
high prices and had been unable to
buy back promptly fell to rubbish
values, at which he was able to help
himself; indeed, many of them had so
heavy a liability attached that he was
actually paid hard money to take over
shares which he had been the day be
fore unable to purchase on any terms.â

OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ANl>
OUR HOMES.
In tlu-ir consuming desire to find reason
for things, the sunn and daughters of
men often go far afield and place at in
nocent doors responsibilities that proper
ly belong elsewhere.
Whatever men and women go about
seeking there is nothing for which they
search with more untiring assiduity than
pretexts for bad temper, bad habits and
bad moral?. Instead of coming out frank
ly, fairly and squarely, and acknowledg
ing that they did all of these things
pimply because their natures prompted
them so to do, they claim that they real
ly didn't mean to, but were influenced
either by somebody or something entirely
beyond "their control, or else they fall
back nn that convenient excuse, heredity,
and blame their fathers, grandfathers
and a long line of ancestors generally for
something that they ure too bad or too
Indolent to correct. If the foundations it
the family altar are builded on pure and
undented truth and sincerity, the super
structure must of necessity partake to an
extent at least of the same characteris
tics in order to be at all symmetrical.
The slightest departure from truth
should be gentiy but firmly relinked, and
all influences that tend toward vitiating
the moral atmosphere of the dwelling
should be punished.â New York Ledger.

STREET SURVEYS PLANNED
QUIET AND UNEVENTFUL SES
SION OF THE BOARD.
A Large Number of Local Improve
ments, Including Considerable
Street Work, Receives
Attention.
The most important business transacted
yesterday by the Board of Supervisors
was the passage of a resolution to repave
Market street with bitumen from Sixth
street to Van Ness avenue. The Super
visors were not in a mood to discuss mat
ters of public importance, and contented
themselves with attending to a grist of
minor matters.
A communication from the Pacific Tele
phone Company objecting to the use of
a patent telephone service by the police
was referred to the City and County At
torney for an opinion as to what action,
if any, should be taken by the board.
A sixty-day leave of absence from the
State was granted Police Commissioner
Robert J. Tobln.
Permission was granted to the National
Athletic Club to hold a fight in November
and the Hartford Athletic in October.
The Union Paving Company was author
ized to construct basalt block gutterways
on each side of Sutter street, between
Kearny and Grant avenue, and to lay
bitumen on the street on a concrete foun
dation at least six inches thick.
A plan for a sewer system for the dis
trict bounded by Cortland, Andover and
Crescent avenues and Folsom street was
adopted.
The City Engineer was directed to make
surveys for establishing grades in the dis
irlct "bounded by Vernon and Randolph
streets and Worcester, Palmetto and
Orizaba avenues; also in Sunnyside
tract; and to estimate the expense of sur
veying block No. 33 in the Fairmount
tract.

CUT OFF HIJ ARM.
George Brazilo Jumped on the Cars
of the Belt Line and Fell
Under the Wheels.
George Brazilo, an eight-year-old boy |
residing at 216 Union street, fell under the j
cars of the Belt line at the foot of Union
street yesterday evening and had his leu
arm so severely mangled that an amputa
tion was necessary.
The boy with 'wo companions was play-
Ing near the track when a train loaded
with fruit came by. He climbed on to a
car to secure some of the fruit anu fell
under the wheels. R. B. Knowlton had
warned the boys about playing around the
cars but a short time before the accident,
but they did not heed him. After speak
ing to the boys Knowlton went into a
neighboring store to make purchases, and
when he returned to the street he found
Brazilo sitting on a chair on the sidewalk
with his arm nearly severed from Ins
body. The Harbor Hospital ambulance
was called, and Drs. Hill and Zabalu. am
putated the arm above the elbow.

Abused His Wife.
William Vandorkaag of 19^ Harlan
place appeared in Judge Joachimsen's
court yesterday to answer a charge of
beating his wife. He went home Sunday

he abused her and threw a lighted lamp
at her. The lamp exploded and set fire
to the bureau. Vanderkaag pleaded to

many, but Prosecuting Attorney Graham
insisted upon a conviction and Vander
kaag was ordered to appear for sentence
this morning.
Matt Whalen's Bad Dream.
Matt Whalen, a well-known hackman
on the water front, fell asleep in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday morning. He
snored so loudly that the Judge ordered
Halllff Farrell to wake him up. Farrell
did so and Whalen, forgetting where he
was, used language that was very shock
lnp. He was ordered into custody and
charges of contempt of court and using
vulgar language were booked against
him.

THE LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron for October
says of the lumber trade: "Prosperity Is slow
ly but surely dawning upon the lumber circles
of this coast, and the conditions have a strong
tendency toward a normal readjustment. Mne I
and redwood are on the same plane and. while |
prices are as low as they can be and give even :
a small profit to the manufacturer, still they ;
are firm and show a slight possibility of a ]
near rise. The equality of redwood and pine
gives a stimulus .to former, and sales are i
larger and more freij\ent. The cause of this ;
condition Is found in the decrease of deliveries ;
of pine, for those of September have been
Ibout the same as In August. The reason for
the laxity of pine shipments is because of the
great Increase in the foreign demand and the !
scarcity of bottoms for local deliveries. Red
wood on the other hand has been forced into
the local market in sufficient quantities to meet
the demand.
"Local building Is picking up and money
seems easy and with a tendency toward liberal
construction of buildings."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 3.â Today's stock market
furnished a striking exhibition of the prole?- !
sional character of the trading. Developments i
over Sunday did not invite a change of tactics j
liy the leaders and on the resumption of busi- ,
ness trade against the industrials was renew- j
cd. Tobacco, Consolidated Gas. New York
Airbrake and various other properties of this '
class gave way rapidly and although the reac- â¢
lion halted after the first half hour, declines in
the meantime had been effected ranging up to 9 !
â¢points in New York Airbrake.
Consolidated Gas figured for 0 point? and To
bacco 5 points, the latter touching- 113. The :
bulls then started in to retrieve some of the j
ground lost last week and aft?r jumping from ,
or^e stock to another, Snail}' singled out To- |
bacco as a leader. The strength developed J
here soon permeated the entire list and prices i
forged steadily upward on animated dealings, ,
Interests which had be^n responsible for the ;
late demoralization in specialties also changed ]
front and operated for the long account. The
action was taken in order to shake oft an un- ]
desirable following, the market showing signs j
of having been oversold. This circumstance j
made speculative tactics profitable and efforts i
were made to squeeze the shorts. The traders j
were quick to take advantage of the changed
programme and any effort to cover a large line I
was followed by vigorous bidding with sharp
changes between transactions. Contributors
favorable influences developed as the day pro
gressed to strengthen the market. Arbitrage
houses executed heavy purchasing orders and a ;
decline In money rates induced more general !
buying for the long account. The market in |
detail presented many striking features and j
while realizations were extensive as the rise I
assumed headway the undercurrent of strength j
was not affected and final prices were well
above Saturday's level. Some hesitancy was j
noted at the inception of the rise and the !
market became semi -stagnant, the traders ap- i
parently holding aloof until the disposition of j
the leaders became more clearly denned. Ex- I
treme recoveries from the low point were: Ten ]
points In Tobacco, to 12Z; S in New York Air- '
brake and 5 in Consolidated Gas. Sugar, fig- !
ured for 3 points i\nd the balance of the list be- !
tween l and 2. The bond market opened with â 
an easier tendency but an active demand for i
Atchison adjustments, Wisconsin Central firsts
and Union Pacific, Denver an.i Gulf firsts soon,
changed the current of prices and marked gains i
followed. The reorganisation plans of the lat- \
ter company were Issued to-day and the drastic !
treatment accorded the common stock caused J
a decline to 4. Sales. $2,000,000.
Government bonds showed heaviness, the new
4s yielding % per cent.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 445,
870, Including: Atchison preferred, 442.", ; Bur- !
lington. 12.520; Manhattan, 30,884; Northern Pa- j

London financial cablegram says: The stock
I markets here to-day were dull and stagnant
| and irregular. Brazils were strong on the rise
|in exchange to S>*d. This rapid. Â»rise in ex
change is partly due to the closing of bear
operations in exchange. Americans opened dull,
became quieter later and closed irregular and
dull. There was good buying of Portuguese. I
| Spanish 4s were strong on Paris buying. Kaf
firs were good, as also Grand Trunk, the lat
i ter on the semi-annual report, which is sat
i isfactory but featureless. Argentines were j
i lower on realizations.
â  The Paris bourse was steady and the Berlin
| market was quiet on tight money.
1 learn from a good source that the next re
turn of the Hank of Germany will show an
enormous reaction in the cash reserve, as a \
! result of the end of the quarter requirements,
| but whether the bank rate will be raised with- j
; in the next ten days depends on how soon this â

DR. BRIGGS
ACQUITTED OF
IMMORALITY
But He Did Register
a False Name.
NO WOMAN'S NAME APPEARS
SENSATIONAL SCENE AS THE
CONFEBENCE CLOSES.
The Accused Minister Denounces
The Men Who Bob Him of
the Bight to Â»
Preach.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 3.
Dr. Brings, of the M. E. Church South,
has been acquitted of immorality by the
ilastical jury which spent four days
in trying his case. But he has been "lo
cated" by the conference, which action
will prevent him from accepting a pas
torate in any other conference.
This mornmg when the ministers met \
Bishop Hendrix, after some formal mat- ;
ters, stated that he would announce the ;
verdict in the case of Rev. Dr. Briggs.
He prefaced the verdict with a few re
marks on the manner in which such trials
are conducted. He stated that more se
crecy had been observed in governing this '
trial than in any other of which he know.
The verdict was short. It was to the .
effect that Dr. Briggs was not guilty of
immorality, but he was guilty of falsify
ing, in that he had registered at toe Kuss
House on March 2S, and on another
Bion under an assumed name. The Bishop
explained that the vote was not published
because it had been kept secret, so that
the record does not show who voted fur
or against Dr. Briggs. Tiie verdict had
the approval of eignt jurors.
"I desire to say in explanation," said '
the Bishop, "that 1 presided over this
trial of Dr. Briggs in the interests of pub
lic decency. 1 wanted the trial to be
strictly private, and It was private. In ;
the verdict there I the name of no j
woman. In pi g the verdict I have !
sd a rather unusual form. The bal- ;
lot of the jury is kept inviolate. A record
of the number or votes for or against any
Issue and the certification of all the jury
that these figures are correct being the
only fact that will be given to the pub
lic. In the summary two votes would i
have entirely changed the final verdict.
"No expert testimony was introduced i
during the trial, which consumed four j
days. On Friday we worked until mid
night and all day Saturday. The time I
consumed was less lengthy than was de- â 
Birable, for the matter was very serious
and important an<i of an unusually grave
nature.
"During the trial the charges of con- ;
eptracy against members of the confer
ence were not sustained, and I wish to
commend counsel on both sides for their â¢
ability shown during this trial."
Rev. Dr. Lainar arose and was recog-
nized by the Bishop, although there were
many wishing to speak. He said the
prosecution had much difficulty in the !
-cause witnesses could not be eon-J
trolled ami rr^uch of the testimony could i
not be completed while the postoltlee otti
cialÃ declined to attend the trial.
Question then arose as to whether
Dr. Briggs should be located. Some mm- ,
ister stated that the acquitted pastor's
character could not be passed upon, while
others differed in their views. Rev. Mr.
Carpenter, counsel for Dr. Briggs, said
that they should stand by the decision of
the jury and not go further.
Then followed the most interesting mo
ment of the conference. Bishop Hendrix
stated that as Dr. Briggs was present he
should come forward and be heard. The
acquitted minister left his wife and ad
vanced toward the pulpit. With his eyes
fixed upon the Bishop lie said, with, hand j
upraised: "Brethren, you cannot locate ;
me. Your jury has found me innocent of
immorality, and you cannot locate me i
without degrading yourselves and your I
ministers. If I am not acceptable either
expel or receive me. You cannot say I j
am not acceptable, for no charges of un
acceptability have been entered against
me. 1 am being antagonized from per
t.^nal feeling. It was a fair jury and an
Impartial trial, and now you try to locate :
me secularly. It is infamous, scurrilous,
an outrage. It will contaminate the pure
atmosphere of thousands of homes
throughout this land. Come right out and
admit that it is on personal grounds. If
you do not state the true factu you are
hypocrites ai.d false pretenders. If you
locate me you must locate Lamar. What
do you think of a minister of the church ,
who has allied himself with the Examiner â¢
âa scurrilous, degraded sheet.'
Bishop Hendrix said that such discus
sion was out of order, and a vote was ;
called regarding the locating of Dr.
Briggs. He was humiliated by lust one
vote, the conference standing thirty to
thirty-two against him.
The conference will be held next year at
San Jose.
A discussion was had upon the subject
of editorship of the Pacific Methodist Ad
vocate. Some of the members did not
agree with the policy of the editor, R. P.
WllÃon.

A CARPENTER DISA^ x'EARS.
Fears Entertained That Cal Bees-
worth Haa Killed Himself.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â Cal Beesworth, a
young carpenter, who has bÂ«en stopping
at the home of Mrs. M. T. Tanner, 30
Hannah street. North Oakland, has been
missing since last Saturday, and fears are
entertained that he has done away with
himself.
About a year ago Beesworth arrived in
California from Portland, Me., where his
parents, who are reputed well-to-do, re
side. He was usually well dressed and
carried a gold watch and chain. He had
been drinking heavily of late. When he
left last Saturday he acted very queerly,
according to Mrs. Tanner, who says she
believes his mind is affected.
"He told the two Josephs boyÂ» on Sat
urday morning that he was going to San
Francisco," said Mrs. Tanner to-night,
"but I know- he had no money for that
a.nd to-day I visited all places where he
would most likely stop in the city, but
no one had seen him. I am afraid that
he has committed suicide by Jumping off
Long wharf."
The police wera notified by Mrs. Tan
ner to-night and are investigating.
HE WAITED FOR THE TIDE.
Yuk Keo Wy, Out of Money, Was
Tired of Life.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â Tek Kee Wy, a
Chinese cook, hailing from Yolo County,
has apparently caugtit on to some Ameri
can ways of doing- things. Last January
he came down from Tolo with "heap
muchee mon." as he related to-day, and
"alle same young- fal, go theater, blow
heself. get bus', no can fine work; leady
to die."
He was found sitting in the creek at ;
the foot of Linden street last Saturday,
the brine being up to his neck; but when
the steamer Garden City piowed up the
creek the billows swept over his head and
he tried to get out.
When Officer McKinley took charge of
him and hustled him off to the Receiv
ing Hospital he stated that he had con
cluded to die and ;'<â¢!â¢ that purpose sat
in the estuary wa ting for the tide to
carry him into eternity.
Drs. Webster and Pratt examined Yuk
Kee Wy and recommended him for com
mitment to an insane asylum, and to-day
Judge Hall took the same view and sent
him to Stockton.
POWER-HOUSE WRECK.
An Engineer's Narrow Escape From
Flying Machinery.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â Much damage was
done to the electric plant of the Pied
mont power-house this morning by a belt
slipping from a pulley wheel.
When the belt released the resistance
from the wheel it whipped around at the
rate of 275 revolutions a minute and
smashed everything within its reach. The
wheel flew into pieces, one of which was
found 200 feet away. F, W. Nelson, the
chief engineer, cannot understand why
he .was not killed, for he stood In the cor
ner of the dynamo room while broken
machinery and blocks of cement were be
ing hurled in all directions. He. however,
met with no more injury than being cov
ered with dust.
The pit in the concrete floor in which
the pulley revolved, was filled with
broken concrete and wood, and the roof
overhead was torn for its whole length.
None of the generators suffered and the
damage to the machinery is estimated at
about $2000. Traffic was suspended until
noon, but by utilizing the power from
other power-houses, traffic was resumed.
AN IMPORTANT DECISION.
Judge Hall Says Petitions in Insol-
vency Filed After July 1
Are Void.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â No petition in in
solvency filed after July 1 is valid unless
it be filed in the Federal courts; if filed
in State courts such petitions are illegal.
The foregoing Is an important decision
rendered by Superior Judge Hall this
! morning in his interpretation of the new
i bankruptcy law, when the petition filed
by W. W. Woodcock of the Zenith Plan
i ing Mill came up on a demurrer. . Attor
1 neys for B. S. McFarland, one of the
creditors, moved the petition be thrown
i out of court, since It was in conflict with
I Federal statutes regulating bankruptcy,
proceedings. A ,'-
In sustaining the demurrer Judge
i Hall reconsidered a former ruling made
'â  by himself and now coincides with Judge
; Greene.
There are nine similar cases, the peti-
t ions in all of which were tiled after
! July 1, and no doubt these also will be
dismissed. . -â¢ .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1898.
WRITES OF HER
TROUBLES WITH
HER HUSBAND
Mrs. Rojas' Story of a
Hated Rival.
ROJAS LOVED THEM BOTH
SOON DESEBTED HIS WIFE FOB
SOME ONE WITH MONEY.
She Believes With Judge Ogden. That
a Whipping Post Would not
Be Without Good
Effect.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 8.
Mrs. A. Rojaa of Alvarado Is of the
same opinion as Judge Ogden. She be
lieves that a whipping-post would be a
very desirable addition to the present
means of punishing recreant and cruel
husbands.
Mrs. Rojas has recently been granted a
divorce, and, as her husband has been
busily trying to bolster up his acts at the
expense of his wife's reputation, the
woman has taken the unusual course of
telling- in detail to the public her varied
experience. Her story is more romantic
than any novelist dare make it. more
sympathetic than the ordinary story that
â  is ventilated in a divorce court, and reeks
with cruelty compared with which the
story that called forth Judge Ogden's re
j marks savors of the acts of a good sama
! ritan.
The unhappy woman of Alvarado thus
relates her experience:
"I, Refugia A. Rojas, hereby declare
! that the following is a true story of my
married life since I was married to Guad
alupe Rojas. When he first asked* me to
become his wife I declined, and told him
that, as I knew he loved another woman,
I could not consider his proposals. After
many months of promises of sincerity I
consented, and we were married, but only
after he had threatened to kill himself if
I refused him."
The narrator then proceeds to tell in
: detail how she set her husband up in busi
i ness on several occasions with her own
' money, only to find that he was spending
i tile proceeds on his old love. This money
was left Mrs. Rojas by her first husband
for the care of her little ones. Open in
sults were followed by cruel beatings and
; desertion, but each time that Rojas went
I away and bestowed his favors on his
i wife's rival, he came back and possessed
i the ability to again Ingratiate himself
| with Mrs. Rojas.
The two loves of Rojas continually met
and quarreled, but the husband did not
appear to have the least sense of shame
or even decency.
Wherever the rival went Rojas was
Bure to follow, and under various pre
i texts he always seemed able to obtain
money from his wife, which was always
! given in the hope that hÂ© would start
; working and keep her and her family.
i The confession proceeds: " After a few
! weeks, during which my husband had de
! serted me, I was informed by the Portu
! tmese Consul that I had a $300 lÂ«gacy
I coming to me. I got it and somehow or
I nther my husband heard of it, and he was
not long coming back. He had not a
nickel in his pocket, but told me he had
! finally said good by to his love in Alva
| rado and that we had better move to
I that town and put up a house. I gave
I him money and he did build a little house
I on a lot just about a block from where
i the other woman was living. As soon as
i we started to live in our little house our
! first visitor was the woman who had
; made my life so unhappy. She coolly
told me "that she had not seen or heard
of my husband for so long that she
thought he must be sick, and co she
called to make inquiry."
A little later Mrs. Rojas received a re
quest from her rival for Mr. Rojas to go
jto their house and fix some furniture.
Wishing to do a little detective work,
Mrs Rojas sent her husband, and a little
I later, the narrative proceeds, "at dinner
I time I approached the kitchen window
I and I saw my husband with his arms
! around Mrs. Miller's neck, and kissing
I her. When I spoke, they jumped up very
i frightened, ana the lady said 'Come in.
i Mrs. Rojas, and have some dinner with
! us,' but I thanked her and went home,
i Oh, how I suffered. He would laugh at
i me every day as he went to call on his
friend, and as her house was only a block
i away I could see him plainly from my
j kitchen window. When I remonstrated
with him he said. 'Now don't be foolish,
â  say nothing and let me alone. I am sure
!my friend will be very kind to you.' To
i add to my humiliation he threatened to
kill me If I said a word, and the same
', evening he brought over from the,
woman's house four or five wheelbarrows
! full of provisions, which he said had been
given to him. I took a bottle of strych
nine in my hand and was about to end
i my misery when I thought of my children
and was "deterred. He told me that he
I loved this woman before he married me,
and that he found ail his former affec
tion returning. I noticed that it com
menced to return as soon as he had spent
what little money I had, and I asked him
to kill me rather than bring about my
death by inches. This angered him so
that he "grabbed a lamp and threw it at
me, broke all the dishes and chairs, grab
bed me by the throat and told me he was
boss and would do as he liked."
The narrative then tellÃ of many acts
! of brutality and starvation, and of all
I kinds of indignities heaped upon her by
| her husband and her rivaf. In speaking
| of the death of their little child, which
] finally convinced Mrs. Rojas that she had
â¢ better live alone, she says: "I had just
$5 left, which was in a trunk, and I told
my husband, for I was sick in bed, to
I get a little coffin for my child and bury
!it decently. He got very angry, left the
i house and went off for several days, leav
ing me without anything to eat or any
attention and enjoying the company of
I the. woman he loved before he met me."
Mrs. Rojas' story appears to bear the
imprint of truthâ it Is so blunt and earn
. Ft. Tt Is a strange story of the amount
of misery a woman will endure out of
misplaced affection for an unworthy man.
Had not the greater part of it been re
peated under oath it would hardly appear
to be credible. According to her narra
tive her honor nor her children's honor
had any claim on the respect of Rojas,
and a large portion of her experience is
| simply Indescribable.
The last scene in this unhappy drama
was the selling, a few days ago, of the
little property at Alvarado.
Fixed the Tax Levy.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â The City Council
met to-night and fixed the tnx at $1.21.
This Is the ordinance that has created
such opposition and that provides for
JM.noo for dredging Lake Merritt and
$38,500 for building sewers on either side
of the lake. Mr. Girard made an argu
ment against Its passage, saying it would
result in closing the schools and the free
library and in other hardships, bu,t his
speech had no effect and the vote stood,
for the ordinance. Earl, Heitman, Henne
berry, Woodward, Bmsnahan and Wat
kinson; against, Girard, Pringle, Upton,
Cuvellier. Rowe.
Bun Down by a Train.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â Charles D. Coffin,
an employe of the railroad company,
was killed at the mole to-night. He was
wheeling from the shops to the pier to
take the train for home, when he was run
ever by a gravel train which was backing
down the pier. He did not appear to see
that it was backing and was knocked
down and instantly killed. Coffin resides
at !>S7 Capp street, and has been an active
non-commissioned officer of the Salvation
Army for some years.

FONG SUEY WAN
STILL MISSING
Search Made for Heron
the City of Peking.
TWO OF HER VICTIMS HELD
MAJOB MOOBE'S PBECAUTIONS
TO PBEVENT A FIASCO.
Disagreement Bet-ween Deputy Mar
shal Gallagher and Special
Agent Putnam in the
Becent Baid.
There was no abatement yesterday Jn
the pungency cf the latest Chinese bureau
scandal, Fong Suey Wan still beintj in
visible and Chief Meredith being awake
but innocuous.
In order to prevent the possibility of the
notorious woman making her eÃcape on
the City of Peking, Special Agent Moore,
of his own motion, requested Surveyor
Spear to furnish the revenue cutter Gold
en Gate and six men to proceed to the
steamer and search for the woman. Mr.
Spear cheerfully and promptly complied
with the suggestion, and in turn suggested
to Chief Meredith that he detail Dr. Gard
ner to accompany the posse and assist in
identifying the criminal in case she be
found. Mr. Meredith refused at first to
allow the doctor to go, but thought bet
ter of it later on and gave his consent.
The search, while fruitless, strengthened
the conviction in the mind of Special
Agent Moore that the ' woman had not
left this city, but is in hiding in some
of the underground habitations in China
town. He ia, however, taking no chances
with the women now confined in the
Presbyterian Mission, several of whom
had escaped from the Omaha Exposition
und whose capture he was requested to
make by the Secretary of the Treasury.
He has detailed General Vernon to sit
each day in Judge Heaeock's court room
and see that the Fong Buey Wan incident
Is not repeated in their case.
Ah Young and Jin Ho, the women Im
ported by Fong Suey Wan. were taken
out of the mission yesterday and brought
before United States District Judge de
Haven, who made an order holding them
as witnesses in lieu of $250 bonds each.
Special Agent Putnam of Los Angeles,
who is here to assist Major Moore in
having the Omaha women deported, is
disgusted with the manner in which
Deputy United States Marshal Gallagher
acted while on the recent raid in China
town. Mr. Putnam said he found it neces
sary to force a door open In order to cap
ture one of the Omaha women, .and that
Gallagher not only refused to assist him,
but refused also to walk around the cor
ner of the hallway so that he might not be
a witness in case Mr. Putnam should ac
cidentally fall against the door and break
a panel. He said also that Gallagher re
marked on that occasion that he dia not
propose to break open any doors, and that
he did not propose to allow any doors to
be broken.

OADWALADEB, COMES OUT.
BERKELEY, Oct. 3.â Cadwalader, the
crack football man from New Haven, is
to be a permanent acquisition for the
University of California. The doubts
which were entertained when the big fel
low first came to Berkeley, as to whether
he would "come out" or not, are now at
rest. This afternoon he "came out," and
having exchanged his Yale sweater for
the University of California colors, took
part in the regular daily practice upon
the football field. Coach Cochran put him
in the team as right guard, and he will
probably play in that position for some
time. The new man will keep up his
training until the blue and gold faces
Stanford next Thanksgiving day.
The freshman eleven lined up this after
noon for the nrst time. Their first match
will be played against St. Matthew's
School next Wednesday afternoon. The
game is to come off upon the university
campus at 4 o'clock.^

ed last Monday evening-, not telling her
friends where she was going, and it was
not until her return Saturday evening,

of Oakland, a man of considerable means.
They visited Carson City, Lake Tahoe
and Virginia City on their bridal tour.
Will Fix the Tax Levy.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 3.â The tax levy will
have to be fixed by the city trustees this
evening. The levy would have kopt with
in a dollar had it not been that consider
able of the city's bonded indebtedness Is
payable this year, amounting to $29,H."8.
This sum will be the largest paid for the
liquidation of bonds Blnce the incorpora
tion of the city. The amount asked for
by the different departments of the city,
if allowed, would make a tax levy of $1 17
necessary. It is closely figured that the
actual running expenses will require a
levy of $1 10, and anything less than that
will cause a deficiency. It is stated on
good authority that the rate will be fixed
at $1 05, as a compromise with two mem
bers of the board who are pledged to a
dollar limit.
The Maxina Was Ablaze.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3. â The Maxina, a

evening. A fire started in the wheel
house in some unaccountable way and
before its discovery that part of the ves
sel was burned away and will have to be
replaced.
Proposed Alliance With England.
If the United States and Enpland should form
an alliance, the combined strength would be so
g-reat that there would be little chance for ene
mies to overcome us. In a like manner, when
men and women keep up their bodily strength
with Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, there is lit
tle chance of attacks from disease. The old
time remedy enriches the blood, builds up the
muscles, steadies the nerves and increases the
appetite. Try it.

PRINTERS STRIVING
FOR NjNE-HOUR DAY
Employes of the Michigan State Of
fice at Lansing Leave
Their Cases.
LANSING. Mich., Oct. 3.â A1l of the
employes of the Robert Smith Printing
Company, State printers, walked out
again to-day.
On July 1 they struck because of the re
fusal of the firm to grant a nine-hour
work day, which they claimed was con
sidered In the new bids for the two-year
State contract, and also an increase of
wages in the hindery. An agreement was
reached whereby the differences were left
to a board of arbitration.
Last Saturday the strikers notified the
firm that they would insist on an in
creased wage scale in the bindery. This
the firm claimed was not included in the
arbitration.
The strikers say the bindery scale was
included in the former agreement, and,
with three or four exceptions, the entire
force of 150 refused to work this morn
ing.
COLT'MBI'S. Ohio, Oct. 3.â November
1 is the date set by the Focal typographi
cal union for the concerted "movement
looking to a nine-hour day in book and
job offices. It is hardly thought that a
general strike will result, but an assess
ment of 1 per cent is being levied on
printers" earnings as a defense fund.

The Great Industry of France.
RHEIMS, France. Oct. 3.â The reports

the present grape crop is a very fine one
as regards quality. The fniit is now be
ing gathered, and as usual the great
bulk of the choicest grapes are being for
warded to the establishment of Veuve
Pommery Fils & Co., at this place,
which, because of its enormous business,
has had this year, as in the past, the
option on the crop of all the vineyards
which are known for the fine flavor of
their grapes. There is no house engaged
In making champagne which pays such
careful attention to the selection of the
fruit used. This accounts in a large
measure for the fact that among con
noisseurs the world over Pommery, either
"Sec" or "Brut," is the choicest of all
wines.

PROMISSORY NOTES
Capitalist Nevills Seeks to Collect
the Balance Due on Two
Loans.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 3.â Samuel M. Short
ridge and C. M. Shortridgt? were made de
fendants in a suit brought to-day by W.
A. Nevills, the capitalist, of Fresno, to re
cover $23,327 21 due on two promissory
notes aggregating $60,000. The notes are
for $40,000 and $20,000, and were made at
Pan Francisco on November 30, 1596. The
i former was for one year ana the other for
; ninety days, bearing S per cent interest.
: Both notes were secured by 117 shares of
stock in the San Jose Mercury Printing
i and Publishing Company: a house and lot
; on the corner of Washington and Bu
. chanan streets in San Francisco, 625 acres
; of land in Pima County, Arizona, and a
lot at Sixth and Martha streets in this
city.
On April 30, 1898, C. M. Shortridge
deeded the house and lot in San Francisco
and the land in Arizona to Nevllls, and
was given credit upon the 540.0U0 note for
! $31,672 79. A few months later he turned
; over his furniture in the San Francisco
house to the plaintiff and was given
â  further credit for $5000, leaving a balance
iof $3?.27 21 due or. the note. Nothing has
: been paid on the principal of the $20,000
note. Considerable interest is due. The
; security on the sum remaining unpaid
I consists of a lot in this city and 117 shares
!of the Mercury stock. The- plaintiff asks
r that a commissioner be appointed to sell
i the incumbered property.
This is the second suit filed against C.
M. Shortridge within a week. Last Fri
day he was sued for $25,000 by Joseph
Britton of San Francisco.
SCHOOL DISTRICT
FIGHT IN NEVADA
â , â
Rival Teachers Seek Possession of the
Clear Creek House of
Learning.
CARSON CITY. Oct. 3.â At Clear Creek
: a feud is imminent on account of the ac
! tion of rival school boards. The district
! of Clear Creek is so situated that a por
; tion of the pupils attending: come from
I Douglas County and the remainder from
; Ormsby County. Years ago the commis
i sioners of both counties held a meeting
1 and, ascertaining that most of the chil
; dren attending school resided in Ormsby
! County, allowed two of the trustees to be
appointed therefrom. Last May. there
being no election, Ormsby's superin
tendent appointed two members of the
old board, and Miss Maggie Schulze was
; engaged to teach school. Shortly after
ward Superintendent Naglo of Douglas
'. appointed two members, also claiming
â  that now the number of children from
â  his county was in excess of those from
! Ormsby. and this board appointed Miss
Virgin as teacher.
Meanwhile Miss Schulze is in possession
i of the school, while Miss "Virgin's sym
', pathizers will not attend. In order to end
i the difficulty the case was brought before
: the Supreme Court to-day by the Douglas
board. The defense claims, if as alleged
the change In attendance gives Douglas
! the better of it. that the board that cre
i ated the present arrangement is the only
j power to dissolve it. and therefore Mr.
! Xagle had no right to act on his own au
! thorlty.

BELIEVE HE
WAS FOULLY
DEALT WITH
Suspicion That Gustave Berlin
Did Not Take His Own
Life.
His Friends Thinking He Was Murdered
Have Asked the Police to Make a
Thorough Investigation.
The friends of Gustave Berlin, whose
lifeless body was found hanging in a
room at 118 Eleventh street at an early
hour yesterday morning-, do not believe
that he committed suicide. So convinced
are they that he was the victim of foul
play that they yesterday afternoon vis
ited police headquarters and asked Cap
tain Bohen to make an investigation.
Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday morr
ing the landlady of the house where the
unfortunate man lived heard a peculiar
noise and started to investigate.
On entering Berlin's room she was hor
rified to find him in a half-kneeling pos
ture with a rope around his neck. He
â was beyond all human aid, haring been
strangled to death. The fatal rope was
attached to a hook in a closet in the room
and the other end fastened around his
neck. The astonished landlady lost no
time in notifying the police and word was
at once sent to the Coroner. Thinking it
was a case of suicide the Coroner's depu
ties, after a cursory examination, remov
ed the body to the Morgue.
Berlin arrived here from Alaska on Sep
tember 11. He had over $500 in his posses
sion, which represented the amount he
had earned in the gold fields. Shortly af
ter his return to this city he visited Han
ria Nes, a Swedish woman, who lives at
1604 Mission street. Her brother had ac
companied him to Alaska find as he was
leaving him Nes begged him to see his
sister and explain to her that he was do
ing as well as could be expected. Berlin,
anxious to show his appreciation for his
companion's sister, bought her several
presents.
The last time she saw him alive was
about a week ago. He seemed happy
CONFESSION OF A. C.
WIDBER ADMITTED
JUBY HEARS THE ST^RY OF DE-
FALCATION.
Mayor Phelan Makes Further State
ments and the Defense En
deavors to Prove That He
Is Interested.
The jury sitting for the purpose of de
termining whether or not Augustus C.
Widber shall wear the felon's stripes in
punishment for his crime of stealing
$117,000 from the vaults of the city treas
ury listened to the confession of the pris
oner, as read from the notes of Stenogra
pher D. C. Murphy yesterday. During
the reading of the confession it devel
oped that Mayor Phelan also made p. con
fession which Is contained in his ques
tions to the accused, which elicited his
statements of guilt. Mayor Phelan stated
that he, as well as the Auditor and Judge
Uahrs, felt responsible in a degree for
the city's loss, and wanted \S idber to
make a statement regarding the pecula
. On March 25 the trio counted the
money and thought it was correct. Most
of the money was "hefted," not counted,
and Widber informed them that when
they believed the money to be correct on
March 25 they were laboring under a de
lusion. Assistant Treasurer de la Mon
tanya was similarly afflicted when he re
ported that on December 27 he found
the cash account correct.
Following his statement that on the
two dates mentioned the funds of the
treasury were short, "Widber stated that
he alone was guilty, and begged that no
one else be accused of the crime. On be
ing asked by Chief Lees what disposition
had been made of the money the default
,er answered that he had invested it In
various speculations, and had purchased
a string of race horses and blocks of min
ing stock.
Murphy left the stand and Mayor Phe
lan was again called. He stated that
Wldber had admitted to him on the day
following his arrest that he had appro
priated the missing funds. He explained
to the Mayor that he had withdrawn gold
from sacks received from the Mint and
'refilled them with silver. The attorneys
for the defense then endeavored to prove
that the Mayor was personally interested
In the prosecution of Widber in order
that his own responsibility in the matter
might not be made an issue in the
case. With this end in view letters
were introduced written by the man
ager of the Maryland Surety Company
demanding that suit be instituted against
the Mayor and all whose neglect was re
sponsible for the big shortage. It also de
:veloped that Mayor Phelan had become
aware of the fact that criminal action

At the time that I sent for your book, I was

"I do not believe he committed suicide,

wanted to make me his wife, but I re

not marry him. It is true he bought me
a few presents, but he understood that
they were to promote friendship more
than love. Through the death of a rela

"It seem strange, to say the least, that

only a very few dollars were found in his

"He was not a drinking man and not

CANADA PLANS ANOTHER GRAB.
Mayor Stanley of Skaguay Tells an Interesting Story
Conditions in the North.
John Stanley, the famous Mayor of Skaguay, who was put into office
a few months ago when the nortorlous "Soapy" Smith gang was ousted
and driven from the city, arrived In this city yesterday and brings much
Interesting news regarding the gold regions.
Mr. Stanley is inclined to laugh at Major Walsh's statement that the
American Government will cede the cities of Skaguay and Dyea to the Can
adian Government. He says that Skaguay Is the coming city of the far
north. Work is progressing rapidly on the new railroad which already
runs to White Pass City, a distance of about sixteen miles. While the
Canadian Government owns the land in which the richest claims are lo
cated, it does not own any city of size and its revenues suffer accordingly.
Major Walsh has occupied the position of gold commissioner for some
time and has made a careful study of the situation. He saw that the rail
road would be tho making of Skaguay, as it would be the natural port of
embarkation and debarkation, and he wants his Government to own it and
reap the rich results of the tide of troffie if it can be procured by hook or
crook. Ho left Skaguay for Ottawa last month, and in conversation with
Mayor Stanley told him that he would lay the whole matter before his Gov
ernment.
"I do not think the United States Government will be foolish enough to
make any such cession," said Mr. Lynch, "for if It does it will be simply
giving away sources of golden revenue. The Canadian Government has
absolutely nothing on which to base such demands, but it wants the cit
ies and will grasp at any excuse to press claims as a drowning man
cluthches a straw."
In speaking of the mining- prospects he said: "I think the best terri
tory is in and around Atlin. This district is about S5 miles from Skaguay
and you can make it in two days by the winter trail. It is a beautiful
rolling country and all the creeks are rich in gold. Added to this the
climate is agreeable. The nights are cool, but there has not been a sign
of frost yet and I think a clatm could be worked the year round. Many
of the claims are paying from $200 to $250 per day and I have a two-pound
nugget which was taken out of one of them. The gold is much finer than
that found around Dawson. Skaguay is the coming city of the north.
It now has about 3500 inhabitants, all a good class of people. My mission
here is to procure fire hydrants, hose and hosecarts, and I will also bring
up a number of men to work on the railroad. We have about 800 men
working now and intend to work all winter."
Mayor Stanley was asked about the charges alleged to have been
made against Collector of Customs J. W. Ivey of Alaska, but he does
not know much about the matter, although he says a warrant has been
sworn out for Ivey's arrest. There haÃ been a great deal of smuggling
going on and the Federal officers have found it almost impossible to
break it up. Collector Ivey accused many prominent men In Alaska of
being connected with it and they deny his charges and will sue him for
criminal libel. The parties charged are Judge C. S. Johnson, District At
torney B. E. Bennett and ex-Collc-tor of Customs James A. O'Connell.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1898.
TROPHY FROJW GHVITE.
Spanish Coat of Jlrms That Adorned the
Jlpsenal.
THE Bohemian Club is In possession of the finest trophy of the war that has
come to San Francisco. Yesterday Major James A. Thompson found upon
opening the letters addressed to him as president of the Institution one
which reads as follows:
TJ. S. 8. OLTMPIA. August 30. 1898.
Sir: I have no ancestral hall in which to hang trophies of the flght. Do you think the
club would like to have the one enclosed? I knocked it off the arsenal at Cavite a few
days after May 1, IS9B. If the club does not care for it kindly let me know, and I will
dispose of it in some other fashion.
RICHARD LEAL. Seaman, U. S. S. Olympla.
The President. Bohemian Club, San Francisco.
The box accompanying the letter was opened at once and the souvenir
brought to light. The trophy consists of the Spanish coat of arms on a shield
of carved wood and stucco. The colors are slightly dimmed by exposure to the
weather, as the piece had been used as an exterior ornament. The dimen
sions of the trophy are 26x18 inches. The arms of Aragon and Castile, the
standards, the lions, Neptune's trident.bayonet, cannon and anchor, are placed
artistically on the shield as the illustration shows.
Formal acknowledgment of the valuable souvenir will be made in due time
by the owl.
nue, was released on $3000 bonds accepted
by Judge Trout Saturday.
Yesterday morning Inspector Newman
reported to Judge Mogan, to whose court
the cases were assigned, that in his opin
ion the bonds were worthless. The sure
ties were Miss Mary Meugge of 290 Mis
sion road and Attorney Walter Gallagher.
Newman reported that in both instances
the properties on which the sureties quali
fied were mortgaged up to the limit.
Judge Mogan at once sent for Fire Mar
shal Towe. and at the request of the Fire
Marshal issued a bench warrant for Bea
com's arrest, and increased his bonds to
$6000. The warrant was handed to Detec
tive Fitzgerald of the Mission district,
and he was instructed to use every effort
to arrest Beacom.
Mrs. Shields is still confined in the in
sane ward in the Receiving Hospital, but
her friends expect to get her released on
bonds this morning.
Professor Le Conte's Lecture.
A lar^re number attended the lecture de
livered by Professor Joseph Le Conte of
the University of California at the
Academy of Sciences last evening. Its
title was "Origin of Transverse Mountain
Valleys and Some of the Glacial Phe
nomena Found in the Valleys of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains." The professor ex
plained a great many of his deductions re
garding the formation of the neighboring
Sierras, and stated that the various
changes which now form the permanent
condition and structure of the mountains
have occurred in a comparatively recent
era. The talk from beginning to end was
very interesting and instructive.

MOSES AND ISAIAH
ARE RECONCILED
TOUCHED ELBOWS IN PUBLIC AT
THE BALDWIN CAFE.
Gunst Believes That Our Policemen
Are the Best, and Our detec
tives the Worst, in
the World.
Our only Moses Gunst of the Police
Commission Is happy in a degree, but
not supremely happy. His observations
abroad convinced him that our police
force is the finest In the world. Yet fur
ther observation along the line of police
administration convinced him that our
detectives are the worst in existence. In
a burst of confidence he imparted to a
friend his mental conclusions on these
two points. In San Francisco many peo
ple may not agree with Moses on his first
proposition, but few will dissent from the
correctness of his views on the second
count.
Moses has been home a week and two
days. During all this time Chief Lees
has bc-en in San Francisco. The town
is large enough for both. The day after
the arrival of Moses the Commissioner
and the Chief met under one roofâ the
roof of the old Baldwin Hotel. The next
day one room was large enough to hold
both of them. The march of peace and
tranquillity was so rapid that one even
ing later Muses and Jaaiah touched el
bows in the cafe. The scene was so
touching that the bystanders at the Bald
win began talking of the prospects of
complete reconciliation, and were still
talking on the same topic yesterday.
This dawn of harmony will be wel
comed by Commissioners Tobin and Al
vord, who were once apprehensive that
their brother Commissioner might get
excited beyond the limits of human en
durance in his efforts to restrain the
usurpations of the Chief. What this
"make-up" portends can only be conjec
tured. If the detective force is to have
a real "shake-up" the people will re
joice.

The will of Eugene Kochendorfer was

NEAD TELLS
THE STORY
OP HIS LIFE
Still Stoutly Maintains
His Innocence.
PLAUSIBLY EXPLAINS ALL
NOTORIOUS "BILLY" NEAD, HE
SAYS, IS ITIS BROTHER.
Police Reiterate That the Couple Are
Impostors and Are Guilty of -^-.
the Crimes Charged'
to Them.
Sinned against or sinning? Are J. M.
Nead and his pallid-faced little wife what
thry pretend to be, or are they the vile
creatures the police and a few denizens
of the tenderloin would stamp them?
If their statements are trueâ and cer
tainly they bear every impress of truth
no greater injustice was ever heaped
upon two guiltless persona. If they are
guilty of the offenses against society
they are charged with, no more consum
mate actors ever appeared In the role of
injured innocence.
There are some things that seem to
bear out their assertions. In the first
place the woman, although convicted, is
at liberty on her own recognizance, sen
tence having been suspended for thirty
days, whije the man is out on $250 cash
ball. Were they guilty their natural im
pulse would be to escape, for to such
people the bail would be of secondary
consideration. Instead, they have re
turned to their rooms at 125 Turk street,
never denying themselves to visitors and
giving no thought to flight. Fear of im
prisonment does not concern them; on
the contrary, all their energies are bent
toward clearing their name of the ter
rible stain upon it.
Seated in the front room of the base
ment at 125 Turk street, which is at once
their parlor and sleeping room, a Call
reporter yesterday afternoon listened to
the life-story of the Neads, and the hus
band told It, and read iPtujrn rrom min
isters of the gospel at the East and on
Puget Sound addressed to Nead and
couched in terms such as only men of
the cloth would use in addressing one of
their number. Lying in the bed, her
features white and drawn with suffering,
but withal clear-cut and refined and illu
minated with big, fearless blue eyes, lay
Mrs. Nead, attended by one of the ladies
who occupy the upper part of the house,
for she was very ill, and the doctor's
coming was anxiously awaited.
It was a simple story, simply told, al
though once or twice the man, not robust
physically and by no means a giant intel
lectually.gave way to his emotions and the
tears coursed down his cheeks despite
his apparent efforts to hide them, while
the little frame on the bed shook with
sobs. Particularly was this the case
when Nead spoke of his brother, whom
he asserted was the "Billy" Nead a
dispatch in yesterday's Call from Sioux
City referred to.
"I am a licensed exhorter of the
gospel," said Nead, "and have devoted
much of my time to mission work in
Sioux City and throughout that section of
,the country. My wife's father was a mail
carrier there before his death and one of
her uncles is a preacher. My wife was a
telephone operator prior to our marriage,
and there are hundreds in Sioux City who
know her and her family intimately.
While I was in Sioux City 1 was engaged
in business, having two stores and send
ing vfagons out through the country. I
did an extensive credit business and final
ly became deeply involved. One of my
Eastern creditors sent In a printed slip
containing a number of questions as to
my liabilities. At the bottom was the
question, 'Have you any confidential
debts?' There were some old notes out
standing which my first wife agreed,
when wa were divorced, to take up out of
the property I turned over to her. I was
afterward assured this had been done,
consequently I wrote 'No' after that ques
tion. My former wife, however, had not
met the notes, and when I was forced to
nssign the Eastern house caused itÂ»v ar
rest for attempting to defraud ny ed
itors. I was honorably acquitted - the
charge, and early in the present year I
went to Seattle. My health was very bad
there, and I wrote to Rev. G. W. L.
Brown, pastor of the First M. E. Church
of Sioux Falls, what he thought about my
returning there and devoting my time to
mission work. Rev. Mr. Brown and I are
old friends and have been much together
in church work. Here is his reply?'
Nead produced a letter written on a
letterhead of the First M. E. Church of
Bioux City, and signed by Rev Mr. Brown.
It was most friendly in tone and spoke of
their long friendship. It frankly advised
him against his proposed step because of
the prejudice that might exist were he to
enter upon churcn work there.
Other letters were also shown, among
them being one from Rev. A. Warren of
Blame, Wash.; Rev. S. Fletcher McGuire,
Wessington, S .Dak., and Pierce Ratliff,
president of the Sioux City Rescue Home.
All of these wrote on the friendliest terms
and spoke of Nead's labors In the Chris
tian field.
"Mr. Warren wanted me to go to Blame
and found a mission," continued Nead,
"but we decided to come to San Fran
cisco. Since w,e have been here we have
not attended any regular church, pre
ferring to go to different places of wor
ship for the time. We have not formed
the acquaintance of ' ministers here -be
cause I did not care to until I was ready
to found my mission.- I thought it better
not to make myself known as long as I
was in the cigar and confectionery busi
ness."
Asked about the Sioux City dispatch in
yesterday's Call Nead burst into tears,
and, when he had collected himself, said
the "Billy" Nead referred to was his
brother, whose career he had been funy
aware of for fifteen years.
This and much more did Nead state. He
told about renting one of the rooms on
the floor occupied by him to a woman,
and said he had been obliged to ask her to
vacate it because on two occasions there
had been such a disturbance there late at
night. It may have been fhat she was a
dissolute character, and the police, seeing
her enter the place, had formed a similar
opinion of his wife. Nead was charitable
to the officers, and It is certain that not
once during the interview did he by word
or action convey the impression that he
was other than he seemed to be.
During the forenoon Nead appeared In
Judge Conlan's court ana pleaded not
guilty to the charge of vagrancy. His at
torneys demanded a jury trial, and the
case went over until next Monday, the
defendant being released on $250 cash
bail. In Judge Low's court Attorney Bell
asked that the case of Mrs. Nead be re
opened, and the Judge promised U> com
ply with the request upon fhe filing of the
customary affidavit setting forth that new
evidence had been discovered.
Last night The Call received a dispatch
from Sioux City stating that Rev. G. W
L. Brown had been transferred to another
part of the State, consequently no state
ment could be obtained from him.
Wants His Presents Back.
John L. Duprey, who fell a victim to
the Bain Matrimonial Agency, filed suit
against Gracd Allison, "the dashing
widow," and W. Bain yesterday, to re
cover a few articles he presented Grace
as tokens of his esteem. The tokens in
cluded an upright piano, stool and cover
one solitaire diamond ring and a canary
colored diamond, a pin shaped like a frog
set with diamonds and having ollvine
eyes, all valued / at $1100.
The Stamp Tax.
Collector Lynch was advised yesterday
by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
that special taxpayers must post con
spicuously in their places of business the
stamps indicating payment of the special
tax. Also that Coronado and other sea
salts put up in packages for the bath must
be stamped as proprietary articles.
