CAMP DEWEY, Aug. 1, via Hongkong, Aug. 9.â
Nine dead; forty-six wounded. That tells the
story of the baptism of fire the American army
has undergone before Manila.
The American trenches before
Malate, thrown forward some
days ago to displace the insur
geints-, and extending from the
beaten a half-mile toward the pas
sage where are General Norial's
headquarters, were held last
night, by the Pennsylvanians and

cover the right of Companies A,
Jj, C and E, which held the
trenches down to the beach, with
Utah's, company, B, lying as a
reserve back along Calle Real,
toward Camp Dewey.
..'At- 11:30 o'clock at night the
Spaniards in front opened fire on
the American right, drawing the
Pennsylvanians' fire outside the
trenches, and thus getting their
position. Then from a dense
bamboo thicket, 250 yards to the
American right, there blazed the
fire of 2000 Mausers, while the
Malate batteries sent shrapnel
shrieking in upon the American
works, and from the front came
a galling fire from Nordenfeldts.
While the Spaniards swept
Calle Real the insurgent batteries
on the Pasay side remained om
inously silent, protected by thick
ets and covered by darkness. The
Spaniards attempted to rush the
American right. The plan ap
parently was to double the
troops up on the beach and sweep
across the flats on to the camp.
Company D of the Pennsyl
vania Regiment was cut off from
the main body, but fought its
way back.
The Spaniards repeatedly ad
vanced within sixty yards of the
American intrenchments, but fell
back before the steady fire of the
volunteers. A shell from Malate
buried one of the Utah guns and
the position was rapidly becom

NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs the following: Although Spain has accepted the peace terms
proposed by the President, hostilities will not technically cease until the
signing of the protocol declaring the existence of an armistice. This
means that Manila will not be forcibly occupied by General Merritt' s troops
and that operations in the Philippines between the American and Spanish
forces will end as soon as Rear Admiral Dewey and Major General Merritt
are informed of the status of the peace negotiations.
This information will be sent to-morrow to Hongkong and from there

GENERAL GREENE
PRAISES HIS MEN
MANILA BAT, Aug. 4, via Hongkong, Aug. 9.â General Greene
has issued this address to the troops:
"Camp Dewey, Near Manila.
"The brigadier general commanding desires to thank the troops
engaged last night for the gallantry and skill displayed by them in
repelling such a vigorous attack by largely superior forces of Span
iards. Not an inch of ground was yielded by the Tenth Pennsyl
vania and Utah Artillery, stationed in the trenches.
"A battalion of the Third Artillery and First Regiment, Califor
nia Volunteer Infantry, moved forward to their support through a
galling fire with the utmost intrepidity. The courage and steadi
ness shown by all in the engagement is worthy of the highest com
mendation."
CAPTAIN CHARLES W. HOBBS.
A Gallant Officer of the Third United States Artillery,
Wounded in the Battle Near Manila.
f* APTAIN CHARLES W. HOBBS of Battery X, Third Artillery, whose name
I appears in the list of wounded in the fight of July 31 at Malate, near
Manila., was well known in San Francisco, having been stationed at Alca-
I ,traz Island for quite a long period.
** Captain Hnbbs has a brilliant record. He was born in New York in 1842,
and at the age of 20, in 1562, was appointed a second lieutenant in the One Hun
dred and Thirteenth New York Infantry, being transferred a few months later
to the Seventh New York Artillery. In July, 1563, he was promoted to the rank
of first lieutenant; In November, ISC4, he was made captain; in March, 1565, he rose
to the rank of major, and was mustered out of the volunteer service in July,
1865.
Captain Hobbs was breveted lieutenant colonel of New York volunteers for
gallant and meritorious services during the war; brevet first lieutenant of the
"United States army for gallantry on the field of battle at Spottsylvania, and bre
vet captain for similar conduct at the battle of Cold Harbor, where his left hand
was shot off, there remaining but one finger, and he was also wounded In one
of his legs. Upon recovery from these wounds he rejoined his regiment and
engaged in the siege of Petersburg. He also filled several Important staff positions.
Captain Hobbs entered the regular army service as a second lieutenant in the
Third Artillery, In September, 1867. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1875,
and was made captain In 1596. He is an honor graduate of the Artillery School

served the double purpose of displacing
the Insurgents, who no longer are con
sidered trustworthy by the military
authorities, and also of controlling the
southern approach to the city to pre
vent the escape of the Spanish when
the fleet bombards and the troops at
tack from San Pedro, Malate and Man
duyalayon. It is considered probable
that a small section of the Third Bri
gade will land on the northern side for
a similar purpose. All this is in the
event that Captain General August! re

Two privates of Company L of the
First California Regiment were cap
tured by four pf Aguinaldo's soldiers
armed with rifles, under command of
Colonel Arrivaldo of Aguinaldo's staff,
to-day, while felling timber. Colonel
Smith, with General Greene's authori
zation, promptly dispatched thirty
armed men, who released the Ameri
cans and marched the natives to
headquarters.
The Astor Battery has not been sent
to the front, being held in reserve for
the assault.
AMERICANS PLAY CARDS
UNDER SPANISH FIRE
Act in the Face of the Enemy Like
High-Spirited Youths on a
Picnic.
LONDON, Aug. 10.â The correspond
ent of the Times at Cavite, under date
of August Ist, says: Yesterday I visit
ed Camp Dewey and the American in
trenchments before Malate. Captain
Grant and Captain Young of the Utah
Artillery, were busily throwing up ad
vanced earthworks for guns, under pro
tection of the Nebraska volunteers.
From the upper floor of an European
house, forming an alignment with the
earthworks, I was observing the Span
ish positions, when a Nebraska sharp
shooter beside me fired the first shot
discharged by the Americans upon the
Spaniards, who were crouching in the
forward trench.
This was contrary to General Mer
ritt's orders. He had forbidden an ag
gressive attitude unless the Spaniards
advanced.
The insurgents, now in force on land
on the right of the American lines, also
opened fire. The Spaniards replied
briskly with quick-firing guns and
rifles, but their shooting was high and
their shots fell a half mile beyond the
intrenchments, where a colored volun
teer picket was hit by a Mauser bullet.
Personally, I was not impressed by
the nonchalant demeanor of the Amer
icans in the fighting line. They were
like high-spirited youths on a -picnic.
Whole groups lying in the second line
were playing cards. Had the Span
iards, who were unaccountably non-ag
gressive during the American landing
and advance, dropped shrapnel from
the Malate forts, they would have
wrought terrible havoc, one house
forming a conspicuous mark being
within easy gun range.

COAMO TAKEN
AFTER A BATTLE
LASTING AN HOUR
Five Spanish Officers aod Nine
Men KjHed and Six Ameri
cans Wounded.
COAMA, Porto Rico, Aug. 9, via
St. Croix. â Coamo w captured this
morning after an hour's fight. The
Spaniards retreated to Aibonito. The
commandant and four other officers
and nine men were killed. The Ameri
can loss was six wounded, all belonging
to the Sixteenth Pennsylvania.
Acting under orders, Brigade Com
mander Ernst, with the Sixteenth
Regiment, moved out from his camp
on Descalbros River last night after
dark. Colonel Hulings took his men
to the left through the fields and woods
to avoid discovery by the Spaniards and
this morning found himself a mile and
a quarter beyond the town, in a fine
position, commanding the Spaniard's
road of escape to Aibonito. There he
waited for developments in front.
These came in the shape of a forward
movement at dawn of the Second and
Third Wisconsin troops. Troops C of
New York and Captain Avelerson's
battery of the Fourth Regular Artil
lery.
The fun began in earnest when the
battery unlimbered in an open field to
the right of the road, commanding a
blockhouse 1500 yards away on another
road leading into Coamo. Several times
reconnoitering parties have been fired
upon from this blockhouse and the in
tention was to destroy it.
The firing began at 8 o'clock fro*n
four guns. The blockhouse replied
with Mausers. The range, however,
was so great that no damage was done
and the firing quickly ceased. In a
few minutes the blockhouse was in
flames.
The battery then limbered up and
took a more advanced position on the
hill commanding the town. Troop C
was sent around to flank the town on
the right, while the Second Wisconsin
or the left of the main road and the
Third Wisconsin on the right m Â»ved
trfth the skirmishers ahead directly on
the town. The bridge over Coamo hav
ing been destroyed by the Spaniards
some days ago it was impossible fcr
wagons or horses to cross that stream
at that place, but fords were found and
everything advanced.
During this time heavy firing was
heard behind the town. It was known
then that the Sixteenth Pennsylvania
was engaged with the fleeing Spaniards.
Colonel Hulings having placed his
men in the best position, was biding his
time. He heard the firing of artillery,
and within twenty minutes the Span
iards came flying down the road.
Colonel Biddle of General Wilson's
staff and Lieutenant Lester Simos ad
vanced toward the road. The enemy
saw the Americans and opened fire on
them.
This began the engagement, which
was kept up for twenty minutes,
when 200 Spaniards surrendered. About
150 escaped.
None of. the Sixteenth Regiment vol
unteers were killed. The following
were wounded: Vincent Jolly, Com
pany F, shot in the arm; Frank Whit

Clyde Frank, Company C, shot in the

The Spanish loss has not yet b??n
learned. Several wounded Spaniards
were seen.
Companies A and C of the Fourth
Ohio ran into a Spanish force where the
road makes two short turns. The Span
iards lay in ambush at the first turn.
They were driven out of this position
by the Americans after a sharp fight,
but were able to hold the second turn
until reinforcements arrived.
The strength of the Spanish position
was such that it is a wonder that the
two companies which ran into the am
bush were not wiped out. Colonel Colt's
men took the first Spanish position
from a superior force of the enemy am'
held their ground until more troops
could come up.
The Spaniards were Intrenched on ont"
side behind a blockhouse and on the
other behind earthworks located on top
of a hill. Nothing but a shallow dltth
on the left side of the road had saved
the American troops, for that the fire
had been blistering hot there was
shown by the trees, leaves and bough*
which had been torn away by Spanish
shot.
The first shell from the dynamite gwx
landed at one side of the blockhouse
and exploded with a terrific roar. The
Spaniards were thrown into a panic
and fled from the hill. The shell tore
a hole in the ground for a distance of
fifty feet.
NO MORE TROOPS
FOR GENERAL MILES
Dispatch of Beinforcements Stopped
in Accordance With His
Report.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9.â The Secre
tary of War has stopped the dispatch
of further reinforcements to Port>
Rico. General Miles reported by cab'e
this morning that the force at his com
mand was ample for the purpose oi
completing the conquest of the island.
This leaves all of General Wade's pro
visional corps of eighteen regiments
still in the United States. It is believed
that all of General Wilson's division,
except the Third Kentucky and Fifth
Illinois, has already sailed, and they
will be allowed to proceed. These two
regiments are at Newport News an<l
will be detained there until the depart
ment has arranged for their further de
tail.

CAMP DEWET, Aug. 2 (via Hong
kong, Aug. 9).â The Spaniards renewed
the assault on the intrenchments last
night. The works were held by the
Third Battalion of Calif ornians and
the Colorado Regiment. There was
heavy cannonading at intervals. An
attempt was made to turn the Ameri
cans' right where the trenches are now
protected. Private Fred Springstead
of Company D, Colorado, was killed,
and Private Edward Zachary of Com

thigh. Private Fred H. Field of Com

shoulder. The wounds of both men
are slight.
THEIR RESIGNATIONS
PROMPTLY ACCEPTED

Colonel Charles F. Woodward, Lieuten
ant Colonel George H. Chaffln, Major
George H. Taylor and Captain 17. A.

ALL OUR TERMS
WAR OVER AND
PEACE TO BE
PROCLAIMED
McKinley Completely Sat
isfied That There Can
Be No Hitch.
Spain Yields So Unequivocally
That Hostilities Will at Once
Be Suspended.
WASHINGTON.. Aug. 9.â The war is over. Spain has
â¢â¢ formally accepted the terms proposed by the United States as
â¢ . a basis for negotiations of a treaty of peace. These terms are
as follows :
â¢: First â Spain to relinquish all claim of sovereignty over
or title to the Island of Cuba and immediately evacuate the
island.
Second â Spain to cede to the United States the Island of
Porto Rico and all islands under Spanish sovereignty in the
West Indies and immediately evacuate the same.
Thirdâ Spain to cede the United States an island (Guam)
in the Ladrones.
Fourth â The United States to occupy and hold the city,
bay and harbor of Manila pending conclusion of a treaty of
peace which shall control and determine the government of
the Philippine Islands.
Fifth â Spain having accepted these conditions In their
entirety commissioners will be named by the United States
to meet commissioners on the part of Spain for the purpose
of concluding a treaty of peace on the basis above indicated.
The President is satisfied with Spain's note of acceptance,
and Secretary Day, on behalf of the United States, and Embas
sador Cambon, representing Spain, will meet to-morrow to pre
pare and complete a protocol embodying in formal diplomatic
language the terms imposed by the United States and accepted
by Spain.
I was assured by a member of the Cabinet to-night that
Spain had accepted unequivocally all conditions, and that there
could be no possible hitch in the negotiation of a protocol
which will operate to suspend hostilities. I was further assured
by the same authority that there is no truth in the report that
Spain has made as a condition of her acceptance a demand to
have the Cuban debt and the question of time and method of
evacuating Cuba and Porto Rico referred to commissioners for
settlement. In connection with her note of acceptance certain
arguments are made, appealing for the right to withdraw her
troops from Cuba and Porto Rico with all the honors of war, the
Spanish troops to be allowed to retain their arms, etc. Re
quests are also made for the retention of certain military' prop
erty.
All these requests will receive proper consideration in
framing the details of the protocol, but I was assured to-night
that they in no way affect the general conditions laid down by
the President, and that the authorities regard Spain's note as
such a full and complete acceptance of all our terns that there
will be no necessity for further exchange of nt>tes between the
two countries.

MANY CONJECTURES AT
THE NATIONAL CAPITAL
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9.â More than
twenly-four hours after It had begun
to reach Washington the Spanish note
In answer to the President's peace con
ditions was presented at the White
House by the French Embassador.
What the nature of the answer waj
can only be conjectured at this stage,
the Secretary of State at the conclu
sion of the conference making the for
mal statement that nothing whatever
could be said on the subject. The con
ference lasted an hour and twenty-five
minutes. This prolonged discussion was
believed to Indicate that the Spanish
answer was not satisfactory in all re
spects, though in Just what points it
fell short of meeting the expectations
of the President it is impossible to ray.
It was felt by observers that had the
answer been a. complete acceptance of
our terms the result would have been
made public. On the otfier hand it
would be a strained inference to con
clude that the answer was unsatis
factory entirely, for in that case, ac
cording to the Presidents statement
heretofore made, his offer would have
been definitely withdrawn and the war
resumed with greater energy than be
fore.
The reply of the Spanish Government
is understood to be a document embrac
ing about 1200 words. The copy deliv
ered to the President was in English,
the translation from Spanish to French
having been made at Paris and that
from French to English having been
made here prior to the presentation of
the answer at the White House.
In the absence of an official state
ment, it is impossible to give the Span
ish position on the several American
conditions, but from the best informa
tion obtainable, in treating each sub
ject Cuba, Porto Rico, Ladrones, Ma
nila and peacecommission â an accept
ance in some cases is understood to re
late to conditions somewhat different
to those laid down by the American
Government. As to Cuba, the Ameri
can terms demanded the evacuation of
the island, without specifying the fu
ture form of government. The Spanish
reply is said to accept the principle
that Spanish sovereignty over Cuba
will terminate, but it is understood to
take up the future government of the
island, and, because of the extent of the
THE SAX FKAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1898.
Spanish interests there, is said to take
the view, either expressed or implied,
that the United States should admin
ister the affairs of the island. As to the
time of evacuating Cuba, this is a de
tail which the Spanish reply is said to
regard as among many which can be
left to the commission for final deter
mination.
The American conditions as to Porto
Rico, the Ladrones, Manila, etc., are
believed to be accepted, but the topics
are treated at some length and it will
lequire the full text to show how far
the language used may be construed
as an acceptance.
The provision as to the commission
is assented to. The commission is to
consist of five commissioners on each
side, with Paris as the probable meet
ing place.
The outcome of the conference is un
known, but the best opinion obtainable
is that the matter is still open, that
Embassador Cambon will report to
Spain the results of his efforts and the
desires of this Government and that
another reply from Spain as to some
details will be necessary to a final con
clusion.
There were Just four parties, to the
conference. President McKinley and
Secretary Day on this side and M.
Cambon, the French Embassador, and
his first secretary of legation, M. Thie
bault, presenting the case of Spain.
SPAIN WILL INSIST
UPON AN ARMISTICE
BATONNE, France, Aug. 9.âDis
patches received here from Madrid,
dated yesterday, announce that the
form of the Spanish Government's ac
ceptance of the American peace condi
tions involves the publication of an
armistice. This, it is added, must be
agreed to by the United States, and if
the United States insists upon the im
mediate evacuation of Cuba and Porto
Rico the Cortes will be convoked with
in fifteen days.
Continuing, the Madrid dispatches
say: "The most rigorous military cen
sorship is exercised to-day. The news
papers are not allowed to refer to the
plot against Senor Sagasta's life, nor
to the appearance of revolutionary
bands in the Castilian province. Con
cerning the plot, it is said the conspira
tors have drawn lots to decide which
of them shall carry out its purpose, and
that the task has fallen upon an Amer
ican named Disball, who has suffered
Imprisonment in the fortress of Mont
juich for participation in one of the
Barcelona anarchist outrages. and
whose sentence was recently commuted
by the Supreme Court to expulsion
from Castile. The band consists of
twenty men. According to some ac
counts they are Republicans, and oth
ers say they are Carlists. Their firpt
move was to attack a customs post and
capture all the arms. Next they cut
all the telegraph and telephone wires.
HOW MUCH VALUABLE
TIME MAY BE SAVED
LONDON, Aug. 10.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says: There
is no longer any doubt that the Amer
ican proposals have only been accepted
at referendum. There was some differ
ence of opinion, but a majority of the
Cabinet decided that the Government
would be exceeding its powers if it con
sented unreservedly to a cession of ter
ritory, and that therefore it would be
better to state this fact clearly and
thus avoid any possible misunderstand
ing with the United States.
The decision now rests with President
McKinley. If he is willing to negotiate
on this conditional basis much valuable
time will be saved, but if he insists
upon the consent of the Cortes consid
erable delay will be inevitable. The ul
timate sanction of the Cortes is certain,
but the debates might be protracted,
since the procedure of the Spanish
Parliament does not provide for clos
uring of fractious obstruction.
The note of the United States, it is
said, suggests that, in any case, the
non-consent of the Cortes need not pre
vent a suspension of hostilities. It is
to be hoped that Washington will take
this view and thus avoid bloodshed, as
there is no doubt that the garrison at
San Juan de Porto Rico will resist as
obstinately as did the garrison at San
tiago de Cuba.

Poison.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 9.â Five
negroes are hanging from the limbs of
trees near the railroad track, and the
widow of John T. Orr is dead in her
cell. This is the tragic denouement of
the assassination of John T. Orr, a
wealthy merchant, at Clarendon a few
nights ago. The wife died from a dose
of poison, self-administered, whele the
negroes, her associates in crime, were
strung up by a mob of citizens.
The report of the lynching was re
ceived here at an early hour this morn
ing after telegraphic communication
had been suspended for the night, and
the only authentic details of the affair
came from the railroad operator at
Clarendon, who saw the lynching. Four
bodies, two women and two men, are
hanging from the limb of a tree not far
from his office, and a few paces away
dangles the body of another negro wo
man, the former cook in the Orr house
hold. Miss Morris, the Jewess impli
cated in the assassination, was not
hanged, she having disappeared last
night.
The lynched are: Manse Castle, Den
nis Ricord. Rilla Weaver, Susie Jacobs
and Will Saunders.
Late Saturday night John T. Orr was
assassinated while making a glass of
lemonade. He had just returned from
choir practice, where his wife was
organist. The crime was shrouded in
mystery until Miss Morris told some
body that Fhe knew who fired the shot.
The Coroner's inquest resulted in the
arrest of the five negroes and Mrs. Orr,
and a warrant for Miss Morris. It was
charged that the wife had hired the ne
groes to do the murder. Orr's life was
insured for $5000, and it developed at
the inquest that Orr and his wife lived
unhappily. Mr. Orr was formerly a
theatrical man. In 1890 the couple
eloped to a summer resort in Wiscon
sin, and were married. Later they set
tled in Clarendon, where Orr prospered
in business and was considered
wealthy at the time of his death.
AMERICAN SHIPS
PRAISED ABROAD
Irving M. Scott on His
Russian Mission.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Aug. I.â lrving M. Scott,
who is here with his son, Laurence
Irving Scott, a Cornell student, and ac
companied by his physician, Dr. George
Chismore, was seen at the KalserhofC
by a correspondent of the Associated
Press and expressed himself fully as to
his trip to Russia, undertaken in be
half of the Union Iron Works of Saa
Francisco.
Mr. Scott, who is the builder of the
battleship Oregon, of Admiral Dewey's
llagship, the Olympia, and of the
Charleston, and who showed the cor
respondent letters of congratulation re
ceived from Admiral Dewey, Captain
Chadwick of tho New York and others
on the splendid fighting and speed
qualities of his vessels, went to Rus
sia, where he stayed a month, for sev
eral purposes. The main one was to
ascertain on the spot the chances
America, and more particularly San
Francisco, will have in supplying the
region around the mouth of the Amoor
River, including Vladivostok and also
Port Arthur, with all sorts of river
craft, deep sea going vessels, ship
building material, railroad material,
etc. Mr. Scott spent part of his time
in St. Petersburg and the rest at
Moscow, the manufacturing center of
Russia, and made a thorough investi
gation of the situation. He said:
"I found that vast and progressive
region which is beginning to be known
as East Russia, along the Pacific, and
for which San Francisco is the nearest
point of supply, rapidly developing, and
I nlso found that the Russian manu
facturers are alive to this fact and that
Russian local industry is remarkably
progressive. I was everywhere re
ceived splendidly in Russia and found
no prejudice against America or Amer
ican manufacturers. But I did finl a
strong tendency on the part of the
Russians to manufacture their own
supplies, and a vigorous encourage
ment on the part of the Russian Gov
ernment to aid in this respect. How
ever, Americans will have as good a
chance as anybody in supplying Rus
sia with those manufactures and sup
plies which they cannot supply them
selves as well or as cheaply. Russia
will build her own ships, as far as she
can, and will purchase, besides, vessels
ready made from other nations. She
has five large warships now building in
St. Petersburg. There will be, though,
a chance for American manufacturers
to supply certain articles."
About the contracts concluded and
prepared by Mr. Scott, as the represen
tative of the Union Iron Works, he re
fused to speak.
"As for American ships," he added,
"I can say that in their performance
they now stand at the very front, and
the capacity of the United States for
building ships ranks second. The war
ship of the future, so far as evolutions
go, will be a battleship of cruiser
speed, fully protected, with heavy guns
and large coal capacity, and also heavy
armor. All these features combined
are possible in a warship, and they will
be combined better than heretofore."
Mr. Scott will spend only a few days
more in Germany, and will then go on
a brief business engagement to Eng
land, whence he will sail for New York.

No .Immediate Changes
in Hawaii.
PRESENT OFFICIALS SECURE
McKINLEY MAY NOT APPOINT
A GOVERNOR.
Will Wait Until Congress Provides
for a Permanent Form of
Government for the
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9.â President
Sanford B. Dole of Hawaii is to con
tinue to exercise the functions of chief
executive of Hawaii until such time as
Congress shall receive the report of the
commission appointed to devise a form
of government for the island and shall
have enacted a statute for its govern
ment. There is to be no Governor of
Hawaii appointed by the President for
an indefinite time, if at all.
The attention of the State Depart
ment having been called to the reports
that President Dole was to be appolnt-
Ed Governor, as well as to another re
port that United States Minister Har
old M. Sewall was to be named for the
place, reference was made to the an
nexation act passed by the last Con
gress, which in one clause provides
that "until Congress shall provide for
the government of such islands all the
civil, judicial and military powers ex
ercised by Wi<c officers of ihe existing
Government in said islands shall be
vested in such person or persons and
shall be exercised in such manner aa
the President of the United States shall
direct, and the President shall have
power to remove said officers and to fill
the vacancies so occasioned."
It is said at the State Department
that, acting within the spirit of this
section, the President will continue in
office the present officials of the Ha
waiian Government, regarding it as a
needless disturbance of governmental
functions there to make any changes
in offices until Congress has provided
for a permanent form of government
for the islands.
EMBARKATION OF
THE SICK SPANIARDS
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 9.â The
auxiliary cruiser St. Louis arrived here
this morning, but owing to her great
length she was unable to enter the har
bor. The Ninth and Tenth Infantry
will be lightered out to her to-morrow
morning and she will leave in the af
ternoon with both regiments.
The shipment of troops, American
and Spanish, is being pushed with the
greatest activity. The embarkation of
the sick Spaniards on the Alicante was
a most pitiful sight. They were brought
from the hospitals on stretchers, in
wagons and upon the backs of their
comrades, often scarcely stronger than
the sick men they bore. The docks
were lined with officers and soldiers,
who supported or carried their wives
and daughters. The American wagons
and ambulances brought cartloads of
miserable, colorless skeletons. It was
a heartrending sight.
The steam lighters Bessie and Laura
were literally covered with the stretch
ers and litters, and the sick and dying
presented a ghastly scene. The em
barkation was partly effected in the
midst of a drenching rain, but abso
lute order was maintained and digni
fied, soldierly silence. No murmurs or
complaints were heard, although the
tale of suffering was told in the pale,
wan faces of all.

Surrender.

GUANTANAMO. Aug. 8 (via Santi
ago de Cuba, Aug. 9.)â Final arrange
ments for the surrender of Guanta
namo were completed to-day, when the
Spanish regulars under General Parejo
â¢were ordered to withdraw from the
blockhouses along the trocha and de
liver over their arms to Brigadier Gen
eral Ewers, the military Governor of
the town. The trenches at Caimanera
and blockhouses along the railway were
evacuated by the Spaniards quietly.
The town of Guantanamo was thronged
with troops, and some excitement was
caused by the constant arrival of small
details of soldiers from outlying â posts.
There were no formalities and few in
cidents to mark the proceedings. Span
ish colonels, with pale, thin and pinch
ed faces, marched through the streets
to the regimental barracks, apparently
glad of the opportunity to pile their
arms on the parade grounds and leave
Cuba for Spain. When all the details
are gathered in more than 6000 regular
troops will formally surrender their
arms and equipment in accordance with i
General Toral's agreement.
There was a sensational rumor in town
last night that the Spanish officers had i
determined to resist the disarmament
and refused to recognize Toral's au
thority to concede their surrender. This
was reported to General s Ewers, who
was told the Spaniards had planned
to seize the town and attack Caiman
era, where two companies of the Sec
ond Immunes had been landed. The
Cubans in town were credulous as
usual and gave wide circulation to the
report, which caused much alarm. Gen
eral Ewers called on General Parejo
and informed him what he had heard.
General Ewers, although he did not be
lieve the report, said he thought it his
duty to inform the Spanish command
er. General Parejo gave strong assur
ances of the absolute inaccuracy of the
report. The Spanish officers, he said,
were dissatisfied because Guantanamo
was included in the surrender, but
would loyally carry out its terms.
One of the first acts of General Ewers
when he demanded the surrender on
July 25 was to ask for the immediate
disarmament of the guerrillas and vol
unteers. This demand was complied
with. He found at Guantanamo 2,000,
000 rounds of ammunition and 6000
rifles. General Ewers' act in demand
ing the surrender of â¢ Guantanamo was
one of the best examples of heroism in j
the war. He was landed above Cai
manera from the steamer Saratoga and
proceeded by rail to Guantanamo and
there, face to face with 11,000 Spanish
troops, demanded their capitulation in !
accordance with the terms of General i
Toral's agreement. He immediately
took possession of the Government
houses and issued a proclamation de
siring the people to return to their or
dinary business. He visited neighbor-,
ing sugar plantations to ascertain the
condition of affairs and informed their
owners that measures would be taken j
to protect their property. The public
prison was found to contain fourteen
political prisoners, who were confined
under long sentences for trivial offen- !
ses. These were released. The cases ;
of those charged with criminal offenses â¢
will be inquired into. â¢

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Aug. 9.â Dr. W. E. Taylor
of San Francisco, who is a retired medi
cal inspector in the navy, came up on
a special trip of the tug Vigilant to
Mare Island to-day to consult with the
surgeons of the yard in regard to the
condition of Rear Admiral Kirkland.
Dr. Taylor examined the patient in
company with Drs. Bradley, Bagg and
Curl of the Naval Hospital. Dr. Wagg
ner of the navy yard and Dr. Hibbetts
of the Independence. The surgeons agreed
that the admiral was suffering' from
acute constriction of the bowels, and
that unless quickly relieved death
would result. An operation on the ab
dominal section was decided upon as
the only means of saving the patient.
Dr. Taylor performed the operation,
making an Incision in the abdomen and'
relieving the constriction by straighten
ing a loop that had caused the trouble.
The operation was successful, and Dr.
Taylor states that Admiral Kirkland
has at least an even chance of recovery.
He has a splendid physique, and if no
complications set in will be able to re
sume his duties in a few weeks.

was the visit of General Ewers to the
camp of Pedro y Perez, who is in com
mand of the local insurgent forces.
General Ewers pointed out to Perez
the advisability of confining his troops
to their hillside camp on the Union
sugar estate until final evacuation by
the Spanish troops. Perez acquiesced
and at once issued orders that his men
abstain from entering the town. If an
offender is caught he will be tried by
court-martial, and if found guilty be
shot.
The local civil government is retained
in office. Provisions are scarce. There
is a great deal of sickness and great
mortality among the Spanish troops.
Three cases of yellow fever are re
ported.
Two companies â L and I, Second Im
munes â under command of Major M.
N. Boutner, on arriving at Caimanera
from Santiago on the steamer San
Juan, were transported to town by
train this morning. Lieutenant James
Stafford, one sergeant, two corporals
and twelve men of Company L left
Caimanera and formed a camp in the
old Spanish intrenchments on the crest
of the ridge south of the town, one com
pany going to camp on the hillside
near Guantanamo. A small guard will
be kept in the town itself and details
scattered through neighboring plan
tations. General Ewers has asked
General Shafter to establish a tri
weekly steamer service between Guan
tanamo and Santiago.
I visited General Perez's insurgent
camp four miles from Guantanamo .this
morning. He has 900 men occupying an
old sugar estate, and 5000 men under
his immediate command. His division
includes Yateres, Maysl, Baracoa,
Sagua and Guantanamo. When asked
his views as to the present position of
the Cuban situation he said:
"The last order transmitted by Gen
eral Garcia included instructions from
the Provisional Government to co
operate with the American army and
to put myself entirely under the orders
of the American general commanding
in my vicinity. In sending these in
structions General Garcia wrote me
that I was to follow American orders,
even if they opposed his own. On this
I am now acting. General Ewers has
ordered me to keep my troops outside
of town and I obey. I see reason for
such an order and I obey it cheerfully.
I am in entire accord with General
Ewers in all matters regarding the gen
eral situation. I have heard of a dis
pute between Generals Shafter and j
Garcia, but cannot enter Into it. I am j
only a soldier; I carry out the orders
given me and do not enter into politi
cal matters. If our independence is not
secured now I am willing to continue ;
the fight for another thirty years if |
necessary.
"The Cuban army has not fought for j
annexation or for American control of j
our affairs. Our fight has been for in- I
dependence and the army will not be i
satisfied with anything else. If an- !
nexation had been wanted it might
have been had years ago. I beMeve
that even without American interven
tion we could have forced Spain to I
give us independence in another year, i
We were getting stronger every day, â 
while the Spaniards were getting
weaker. We had forced them from the j
country and would have soon driven
them out of the towns. I can now re- !
main here waiting for devolopments
and orders."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Aug. 9.â The steamer
Farallon, which arrived on the Bound
to-night from Lynn Canal, brings the
news of a serious conflagration raging
at Skaguay. The steamer sailed from
there last Thursday, at which time,
Captain Roberts states, there was a
strong probability of the total destruc
tion of the young city. p
In the vicinity of Skaguay brush fires
had been raging and it is supposed that
sparks ignited some of the shacks on
the outskirts of the town. A high wind
soon fanned the flames into a vast con
flagration. When the Farallon sailed
nearly twenty houses were in a blaze,
with the fire quickly spreading over
the more densely settled section. The
railroad company had huge quantities
of dynamite stored in several sheds,
and it was feared that ere it could be
removed a terrific explosion would re
sult.
The volunteer fire brigade was doing
good work, but the citizens generally
appeared to be panic stricken and ren
dered but little aid. They rushed hither
and thither, fighting the fire in an aim
less and ineffectual sort of way.
Just before Captain Roberts' steamer
sailed he was informed by a messenger
that the city was doomed, as the frame
buildings were like Underwood, while
the fire fighting apparatus was of the
crudest. The dynamite was stored near
the burning buildings and in almost mo
mentary danger. Every one seemed to
fear taking the initiative to remove the
explosives. A much longer delay upon
the part of the excited citizens would
in all probability have meant the total
destruction of the buildings of Skaguay.
However, Captain RobertÃ believes that
the fire might have been got under con
trol and loss of life averted.

Purser of the Farallon Certain This
Amount Is on Board â Several
Californians Meet With
Success.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Aug. 9.â Sixty more gold
seeker^xnany of whom found comfort
able foWunes in the frozen fields of the
north, returned to the Sound to-night
on the steamer Farallon with their
t:\asure. They steamed up the rivers
and c: .c out over the pass to
Skaguay. A conservative estimate of
the value of gold dust and drafts
brought out is placed at half a mil
lion dollars. Many of the returning
Klondikers who were interviewed
placed the amount at between 5750,000
and $1,000,000. Most of the miners, how
ever, were reticent as to the value of
their fortunes. Many are old-timers,
who. have spent several years prospect
ing and finally panning out wealth.
Among the passengers were the fol
lowing, most of whom admitted hav
ing in their possession the amounts set
forth: Henry Abbott, Sacramento,
$100,000- J. C. Chabbott, Seattle, $30,000;
Reuben Brown, Whatcom, Wash., $25,
000; John Lysons, Santa Rosa, Cal.,
$20 000; T. D. McKeller, Whatcom, $15,
000; A. Parker, St. Paui, $15,000; John
Creits, Seattle, $5000; W. W. Gibbs,
Nanaimo, B. C, $25,000; Wilkinson, Na
naimo, $15,000: Rendall, Nanaimo, $15,
000; Duffy, Nanaimo, $10,000; Riley,
Nanaimo, $6000; Dixon, Nanaimo, $5000.
Nearly every miner on the boat
brought out some gold, the amounts
varying from $2000 to $100,000. It is im
possible to get anything like a true es
timate of the individual amounts.
Henry Abbott of California had a
sack of the yellow metal which took
two men to pack it on the steamer at
Skaguay. Most of the men seemed
well satisfied with their year's work.
They came out in two parties, one leav
inÂ« Dawson July 23 on the Ora. and the
other three days later on the Willie
Irving. Mr. -MacGregor, collector of
royalties in the Klondike, came down
on the latter boat, but his baggage had
not arrived when he reached Skaguay.
and he remained there.
Nearly all have a gloomy story to tell
in regard to the action of the Canadian
officials in the gold district. Mr. Lysons
of Santa Rosa says that while the
country is undoubtedly the richest the
world ever saw, it will never be prop
erly develoned until the obnoxious reg
ulations are changed. Many miners, he
says, are leaving the Klondike and go
ing to the American side, and absolute
ly refuse to develop their claims un
der existing conditions.
Lysons held a rich bench claim, also
No. 5, on El Dorado Creek or just op
posite Berry's claim. Several days be
fore he left Dawson he saw a nugget
valued at SfiOO picked up on one of the
latter's claims. Lysons is authority
for the statement that Major Walsh
had made all preparations to come out
on the Irving, but changed his rriind at
the last moment. "He is not too popu
lar now, up there," said Lysons, "ow
ing to the crookedness of his officials,
and I don't think the country will suffer
when the whole gang leaves. Now, for
instance, I might locate a claim to-day,
and Fawcett, the gold commissioner,
would come along to-morrow and take
Jt from me on some legal point. It
would then be handed over to another
man. I have seen thi3 done repeated
ly."
Reuben Brown was at Circle when
the first strike was made in Dawson
and got there early. He had a bench
claim opposite No. 7 on Bonanza, and
cleared up $30,000 with his partner. His
brother David joined him last fall. On
the trip down from Skagway gambling
for high stakes was in progress, but
there were no sharks in the game. A
Nanaimo man is said to have lost $3000
to an American in one sitting.
Purser Cochrane had about $150,000
in his care n the trip out. He said: "I
am positive there was over a million
dollars brought down in gold and
drafts. I talked with most of the pas
sengers and my estimate I think is
most conservative. Some of them told
me that a richer crowd yet was com
ing out, and would be on the Sound
within two weeks."
Captain Roberts' estimate was rathor
higher than that of the purser. Said
he: "I think there was two or two
and a quarter millions on board. W.
W. Gibbs of Nanaimo, who went In
three years ago, had the largest
amount. One night the men were play
ing poker coming down on the boat
and I saw Gibbs' drafts, some for $50,
000 and one or two for $100,000 each.
He should have $250,000 in drafts at
least, besides a few thousand in gold
dupt."
A party consisting of David Brown,
R. D. Brown and T. D. McKellar of
Whatcom, were among the passengers.
Reuben Brown, who has been in Alaska
thiee years, owned a bench claim on
Bonanza Creek opposite No. 7. On his
bench claim he cleared $30,000, and af
ter paying wages, royalty, etc., h*d
$12,000 or $13,000 remaining which he
brought out. David Brown, why haÂ«:
been in there one year, had a $10,000
lay on El Dorado with McKellar. They
believed there was between $500 OK)
and $800,000 in gold on board the Faral
lon.
John Creits of Seattle went north a
year ago. He has a bench claim on
Bonanza Creek and holds his property
at $30,000. He only brought out a few
thousand dollars, but intends to go
back again. His general opinion of the
gold fields is very optimistic.
A. Parker of St. Paul says that the
French Gulch bench property is claim
ing a good deal of attention and will
probably make a good showing. The
year's output at Dawson, he believed,
will be $10,000,000 from the latest figures,
but Dominion and Hunker creeks will
not show up for what they are really
worth until after they are more thor
oughly worked and prospected this
winter.
Two well-known Nanaimo miners
named Keiffer and Oibbs are credited
with $10,000 apiece in dust, and Gibbs is
also credited with having many drafts,
as referred to by the captain. Another
source says Gibbs brought out be
tween $2* 000 and $30,000. They were In
the country about a year and a half.
Keiffer says the Hunker Creek washout
will be very large before it is com
pleted.

BOSS REA'S HAND
STILL MANIFEST
San Jose's New Council
in His Toils.
JOBBERY IN BROKEN ROCK
SHADY WORK OP THE STREET
COMMITTEE.
Ignore the Lowest Bid of a Con
tractor in the Interest of a
Quarry Operated by
the Ringsters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 9.â The people of San
Jose are disappointed in the present City
Council. When it was elected a "business
administration" was promised the muni
cipality. This the people are not getting,
and the Councilmen are rapidly falling
into the ways of their predecessors. It Is
evident that "Boss" Rea dictates his
wishes to them and that his word is law.
This is plainly shown by the action of the
Street Committeeâ Spring (chairman),
Rogers and Macauleyâ during the past
two weeks. When it lay within their
power to save the city some money in the
purchase of broken rock for street pur
poses they postponed the matter for two
weeks and then threw the bids out alto
gether. This action was taken because
George W. Peckham, who is opposed to
Rea's political methods, was the lowest
bidder. Heretofore Charles Wehner, who
represents the Gay quarry, in which Rea
and other ringsters are interested, has
had things all his own way and broken
rock has been, bought from him at his
Â°\\ r bo P ut C a month ago the city advertised
for "860 yards of broken rock to be de
livered under the supervision of the Street
Superintendent." The rock was for the
improvement of West San t ernando
street. Two bids were received and
opened. George W. Peckham offered to
furnish the rock for tl 63tt per yard, and
Charles Wehner $1 68. This was a sur
prise to the gang, for they had never
thought of any one having the audacity
to bid against Wehner Finally, when the
effect of the shock had worn off, the bids
were referred to the Street committee.
This was two weeks ago yesterday, (..hatr
man Spring was absent from the next
meeting and yesterday he presented the
following report:
"Your Street Committee, to whom w-as
referred for consideration the bids for
rock to repair San Fernando street, Jwg
leave to report that we reject all bids,
believing that good rock can be secured
at a less cost, and that more definite spec
ittcations should accompany the same.
In this the fine work of Rea can be dis
cerned. He is heavily Interested in the Gay
quaxrv. where Wehner secures rock, and
he is determined that he alone shall enjoy
the benefits of street contracts. Besides,
Peckham was an active member of the
New Charter Club, and here was a chance
to punish a political opponent.
The reasons given for rejecting the bids
are ludicrous. On July 11, 1898. the same
identical notice was published, calling for
800 yards of broken rock, and the present
Council awarded the contract to Charles
Wehner at $1 6S per yard. That is VA
cents per yard higher than Peckham s
bid. The specifications of the advertise
ment were definite enough then for Chair
man Spring and his colleagues, and, now
that they nave had a chance to save the
city 4Vfc cents a yard on some rock, the
people are wondering why the bids were
rejected. _ .
For years the city has paid more for
Its broken rock for street purposes than
it should. The bids of Wehner and
Peckham, presented two weeks ago, will
demonstrate this. Wehner's bid was
$1 68 per yard. His rock is obtained
within a mile or two of the city and only
has to be hauled this distance. Peck
ham was going to bring his rock from
Watsonvllle. Besides the heavy freight
on the railroad, he would have to de
liver It from the depot wherever needed.
After meeting this heavy expense he was
going to lay It down in the city at $1 63^
per yard. The Watsonvllle rock
Fa of a good quality and is used exten
sively by the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company. It is strong in cement prop
erties and makes an excellent roadbed.
Many claim it excels the San Jose rock.
As the local rock has twice been laid
on San Fernando street it would, in the
opinion of the taxpayers, be a good idea
to see if the Watsonvllle rock would not
stand the wear better.
TRAMPS IN A CAR
OF BLAZING OIL
Were Trying to Light a
Cigarette.
THE MEN TERRIBLY BURNED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TRUCKEE, Aug. 9.â Three men seri
ously burned, 1800 feet of snowshed
consumed, eleven cars of merchandise
destroyed and delay of all passenger
trains until to-morrow noonâ all this
and more was the price paid for light
ing a cigarette.
Three tramps got into a car at Love
locks last night. The car contained two
tanks of naphtha and left Truckee at 2
o'clock this afternoon on freight train
jNo. 6. About 3 o'clock, when a mile
and a haJf west of tunnel 13, the train
men in the caboose saw the three
tramps, enveloped in flames by the
aide of the track in the snowsheds.
They were screaming "Fire!" and when
the train was stopped it was discovered
that the car was a masa of flames.
In a few moments the naphtha car
exploded, lifting the roof of the Â»hed
a hundred feot in the air and blowing
the sides far down toward Dormer
Lake. There was a second explosion
in a few moments, more terrific than
the first, caused by a car o* refined oil.
Conductor A Schwab and his crew took
charge of tne burning tramps and did
ail in their power to alleviate their in
tense suffering. In a short time a
Truckee wrecking train came to tun
nel 13 and the engine brought down the
three rear cars and caboose of the
burning train.
The tramps were cared for by Dr.
David Shoemaker as carefully and ten
derly as thought they were million
aires, George Scheile, a German, in
haled the burning gases and in in a
critical condition. His face, hands and
feet are charred dreadfully. Joe Reieh
unuh, a Swede, and John Goheneix, a
Frenchman, are awfully burned about
the head and hands, but will recover.
One of the men admitted to the con
ductor that he struck a match to light
a cigarette. The other two were lying
asleep on the bottom of the car. Pry
ing open the side door they all jumped
from the moving train.
Trainmaster T. G. Akers, with fire
trains from Truckee and Summit, made
a heroic fight to subdue the flames in
the snowsheds and had the fire under
control at 7 o'clock. A construction
train is en route for tunnel 13, but it
will be impossible for trains to pass
before to-morrow noon. The forest is
still on fire above and below the rail
road and fire trains will be on guard
all night.

special to the Sun says: News of Cu
ban victories In western provinces has
reached Washington, one of the battles
being the largest and most Important
ever fought in that part of the island.
The principal battle was the result of
a successful attempt of General Gomez
with 3000 men to force the trocha be
tween Las Villas and Camaguri and
make his headquarters with the offi
cers of the Government of the Cuban
republic in the latter city.
General Gomez himself led his sol
diers as they made an attack on the
troch.. and blockhouses early in the
morning. The Spanish soldiers fell
back of the trocha line and there made
a stubborn resistance, which they kept
up the greater part of the day. In the
afternoon, however, their main body
gave way before a machete charge and
the entire Cuban force passed over the
dividing line and marched -without fur
ther interruption on into Camaguri.

_'â  that document the epithets "scurrilous,
"â¢. !<d-efaniatory and incorrect" are applied to
â¢ "a series of articles in the Monitor of
â¢ â¢last May written by its then editor." As
I. was "the then editor," and am "the

â . ray- duty to take notice of this . produc

"'.tain-features in a policy concerning which,
" â¢ i: believe, .at least a section of the public
.feels an interest.

â¢^undertaking did I consider that the names

of -work in this institution, would lead
Â. me to suffer in silence, even though they
apnear to have borrowed the vocabulary
â¢ -of the inmates of the home. But the
redundancy and character of their ad
jectives betray the literary style affected
' in prescriptions .for the sure cure of fits
and the subsequent fate of the document
shows that it emanates from a braggart
who finds courage, to fight only when
. shielded by a petticoat and against a foe
who.; he thinks, is not in a position to
.fight back.
'â ; There are two distinct issues raised by
" this â¢ letter, the question of the Sailors'
Home and the question of the Supervi

'â  .â¢which". the writers of the "Open Letter"
[â â¢â lndulge: : The Sailors' Home is now muni

â¢was â â  â¢ effected the Sailors' Home was
â bought by the money of the people, and
.its"' â therefore not the property of a society,
â¢but- the property of the people.
'â¢' " F!or- "many years the Sailors' Home was
. leij-vie'd/to a private society known as the
..â¢Ladies' Seamenn's Friend Society. This
-.bpdy.""sublet the premises to a "manager,"
â  who; ran the Institution as a sailors'

' certain -percentage of the proceeds.

" "given only for a few years at a time.
.-This year it expired, and as I am inform
" ed the' Ladles' Seamen's Friend Society
. vn.adÂ« ' no application for its renewal.
â \V"ht'-n â¢ this fact became known another
â¢society applied to the Board of Supervi
sors for a lease. The application, how
<:\ i-r, seemed to infuse new vigor into the
ancient body, and the fight began, with
the result of which your readers are fa
miliar*
: â¢"'ln- matters that are purely political, so
cial" .-or economic it is the policy of the
"Monitor not to interfere. Therefore the
."ultimate" disposal of the lease of the
Sailors' Home would be a matter of in
â  difference to me were it not for the sec
: tarian character of the old society. I took
' : |Jie stand that the Sailors' Home was
public property and that public property
".shou'ld not be placed in the control of a
: 'sectarian body. Against this stand no
â¢legitimate argument can be advanced by
: those â who subscribe to the principles of
'..our -constitution.
"... A t 'the same time I was careful to go
â¢ â¢oh. record as declining to Interfere be
"'twfeen''"the two rival societies. I took
'â¢the broad ground that this was a ques
tion of sectarianism or non-sectarianism.
: arid that it was the duty of the Board
â¢ :<->f Supervisors to give the contract of the
. home -only to a society that would co.i
' duct' if according to the law.
. ".The:' majority of the board, however, for
.â r>ascms.'best known to the members com
â .posiHg the same, disregarded all the pro
tesjts." made against delivering public
property to a sectarian body, and gave
-a.- 'lease to the old society. On this ac
tion I commented, as was my privilege.
Two' -months and more after the publi
rcation 1 of that comment the old society
is. stirred up to come before the board
.and-characterize my words as "unjust,"
â¢ "untrue," "scurrilous," "defamatory"
â¢ and "incorrect."
(A) A SECTARIAN INSTITUTION.
The first point, therefore, to be settled
Is the sectarian or non-sectarian charac
ter of the Ladies" Seamen's Friend So
cifty. In Bupport of my contention as
to its sectarian nature I beg to submit
the following facts:
â  1. The soclÂ»ty was composed exclusively
of Protestants. Half of the population of
â the city of San Francisco Is Catholic, yet
there was no room for a single Catholic in
.this society, which was battening on city
â¢ property. Many of the sailors who come
to this coast are Catholics, yet there was
not a Catholic woman In this association,
which professed to look after the sailors'
â¢ Interests.
2. Sectarianism was Interwoven Into the
very, constitution of the society. The
meetings of the members began with re- !
llgious exercises and those religious exer
cises were distinctively Protestant. They
.- consisted of precisely the same elements j
Which the highest courts in this country i
have decided to be sectarian when em- I
ployed in public schools.
3. The ladies of the society were aceus
. tomerl to hold sectarian religious services
for the inmates of the home. These relig
ious services appear from the description
given of them to have been "prayer meet
ings.", which are a species of religious ex-
distinctively Protestant.
'"4. The frank admission has been made
.that while Protestant ministers were In
vited'to licilii services in th<- Home, there
..la no record that a Catholic priest was
i?Yer ask<?d to speak to the sailors. The
â¢|>riÂ«-sts who live near the institution have,
always been under the Impression that
â¢ they- .were not wanted at the Sailors'
Home.
â¢5. To accentuate the sectarianism of
**ie institution, the society hired a Pro
testant prearhr-r to act as chaplain. This
person perpetrated a report in which he
iyent out. of his way to sneer at monks,
aVid this' report was printed by the so
ciety at a time when the A. P. A. was
making: this town ring with denunciations
of .Catholic monks and nuns.
â¢6. The vile publications of bigots, the ob-
Bcene weeklies produced by jail birds were
'supplied lavishly to the sailors. It is not
known that a single Catholic paper ever
found its way into the reading room.
With' a chaplain who was also librarian
it- In safe to wager that pernicious Papist
literature was kept outside the doors.
In opposition to all this the open let
â 'te'r'alleys that "no inquiry Into the de
nomination Â«>f the sailors' religious be
lief is ever asked, nor that of any mem
her. of the board of managers or trus
tees." It may be true that no such "in
quiry" is "asked," but It is a remarkable
fact that for forty years the board of
management or trustees was exclusively
Protestant. There is many a way for
killing a cat besides choking it with but
ter, and there is many a way for boy
cotting Catholics besides "asking an in
quiry."
The open letter also alleges that Cath
olic priests have always been invited to
hold services in the chapel of the Sail
ors' Home. This we know to be untrue.
I am sorry to enter such a calegorical de
nial, but facts are facts, and when ladies
run up against facts even their venerable
age will not save them from disastrous
consequences.
The open letter enters a general denial
of the A. P. A. proclivities of the mem
bers of the society, and adds: "The po
litical opinions of the executive board
have nothing to do with its good will to
the sailor." I am obliged for the admis
sion. In the eyes of the author of the
open letter Apaism is a mere political
opinion and in no way prejudicial to the
interests of the sailor. It is a mere po
litical opinion to swear solemnly on'
Bible and crucifix to deprive Catholics
of their daily bread, to hound Catholic
men out of employment, to persecute
Catholic women, to starve Catholic chil
dren. This is a pleasant political opin
ion indeed, and one most advantageous
to the Catholic sailor. I thank the au
thor of the open letter for the admis
sion. It alone would justify all my asser
tions.
But it may be asked has not the so
ciety elected some Catholic members since
the Monitor's protest and does not this ac
tion remove all cause of complaint? I
have been informed that two Catholic la
dies have lately been made members of
the society, but such representation is no
guarantee whatsoever of fair treatment.
They are hopelessly in the minority and
now that the society has got the lease,
they may object all they please without
effect. We have to judge the future by
the past and when the Supervisors gave
the lease to the Ladies' Seamen's Friend
Society they deliberately handed over
Iblic property to an association that had
oven itself thoroughly sectarian in the
st and that now gives no effective guar
tee that it will not be as thoroughly
.tarian in the future,
i NOT A CHARITABLE INSTITU-
The open letter has made so much of the
aritable nature of the institution that 1
am compelled to make a few statements
on this side of the question.
I. The open letter asserts that $30,000
s expended on the buildings by the so
ty. The public Is led to believe that
' members of the society contributed
s sum. The members of the society
not contribute 30,000 cents during the
ty years they have held the property,
iatever money was expended on the
titution was earned by the institution
the oruir.uiy course of business, and
s only a tithe of what under other
nagement would be devoted to the
welfare of the sailors.
2. In the year IKS", when the home was
in the hands of the same society, an in
vestigation was held by the Commissioner
of the Bureau of Labor Statistics into the
condition of men working on the San
Francisco water front and on board of
Pacific Coast vessels. The report of this
investigation distinctly denies that the
Sailors' Home is a charitable institution.
It reads as follows:
"An institution known as the Sailors'
Home, under the control of the Ladies' â 
Seamen's Friend Society, has been estab
lished at the old United States Marine
K;pltal, which has been donated for the
pose by the Government. Although
in and well kf-pt and conducted on
temperance principles, it is not a charita
ble or benevolent institution, as Its name
would seem to imply. It is simply a board
ing-house, with charges similar to other
boarding-houses."
In leasing city property for a nominal
sum to a society to run a boarding-house
the Supervisors are guilty of gross injus
tice. They might as well donate the city
property on Fifth and Market streets to
some enterprising hotel-keeper to run a
hotel in opposition to the x>aldwin. The
difference is thisâ the sailors have little
political power; the uptown hotel-keepers
can keep even a Supervisor in awe.
3. The open letter grows rapturous
over the sailor who leaves port rejoicing
that his expenses at the Sailors' Home
have been classified as bad debts. The
Labor Commissioner's report tells a dif
ferent tale. In one year a sum exceeding
$1300 was paid to captains of vessels as
commissions for the collection of these
very "bad debts," and over SI4OO was paid
to a runner whose business it was to
"steer" sailors into the home of this
benevolent and charitable society. It is
no wonder that the old society was anx
ious to retain its grip of this gold mine.
These observations, Mr. Editor, will jus
tify the stand that I took in the matter
of the lease of the Sailors' Home. I believe
in the first place that it is a sectarian in
stitution, and I believe in the second
place that the society is not administered
as a charitable or benevolent foundation.
I should not be worth my salt if I did not
protest with all my might against a pol
icy which puts my coreligionists in an in
ferior condition. And because the Cat*
olic sailors of this port are humble men,
without influence, without wealth. It is
Â§bly my duty to speak for them and
â nd their cause.
11. THE SUPERVISORS.
Now I come to the question of the Su
pervisors, a question of far more impor
tance than that of the Sailors' Home.
You will no doubt have noticed, Mr. Ed
itor, that In the discussion which the open
letter occasioned a person named Clinton
and a person named Britt made them
selves conspicuous in upholding the letter.
The former by a mysterious dispensation
of Providence is a doctor, and the latter,
as a punishment for our sins, is a plum
ber. Britt, who combines the aspect of a
hoodlum with tho manners of a plug-ugly,
was of opinion that the Monitor should
be treated with silent contempt. It is a*
pleasure to me to have earned the con
tempt of the Hon. Mr. Britt, silent or
otherwise. It is too awful to contemplate
the depth to which I had fallen had I
merited his commendation.
Clinton considers that the chareres of
the Monitor an; false and have been
characterized by gross misrepresenta
tion. His own character, he said, had been
attacked, and he wished to be placed
right on the record. 1 take particular
pleasure, Mr. Editor, in placing the hon
orable gentleman right on the record. He
is the moving cause in this latest attack
on me. Once upon a time he blundered
into an assault on the Monitor and his
experience then did not tickle his vanity.
Like the coward and the bully, he waited
until he thought I could not address him
and then dressed in the petticoat of
Nancy E. Cooper and the bonnet of Anna
McAnney he stalks forth with the broom
stick, seeking for sweet revenge.
In this whole miserable controversy of
the Sailors' Home he has acted and voted
with his eyes open. Deceived by his vo
ciferous protestations of superior virtue
I took care that he should be warned in
time as to the nature of me deal which
was to be consummated. But warnings
Kilostwhere other influences held sway,
has no excuse. He has deliberately
lered to bigotry; he has deliberately
ayed the trust he swore to the consti
tution; he has deliberately exposed hlm-
Belf to the public view, an idol with feet
Klay and face of brass, a sham philan
pist, a sham -atriot and a sham re
ler.
jo years ago, Mr. Editor, an associa
tion was rampant in this town which
strove to proscribe men and women be
cause of their religious beliefs. Against
that association I strove with all my
strength, becaune I considered its pro
gramme not only a menace to the Cath
olic people, but treason to the constitu
tion. It is not for me to decide now
whether all my methods, all my sayings
and doings were without blame, but this
much I can say, that I strove with a sin
gle mind for the honor of my people and
the good of this community, in that '
fight I owed nothing to any publication. '
I made my campaign alone. I gave every i
party the same treatmentâ Republican,^ i
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1898.
Democrat and Populistâ and if any party
got the worst of it the cause was to bo
found in the leaders, who would not see
the signs of the times.
During all that time I have asked no
one to vote for any candidate. I confined
myself to opposing those who had sworn
to persecute me and mine. Therefore the
successful candidates were not of my
choice and from the greatest even to the
least I was under no oblige tion to any.
When, then, the majority in the present
Board of Supervisors began to run like
sheep at the bidding of a boss I felt it waa
my duty to stigmatize them as they de
served. They had been elected In a move
ment for which I was responsible in large
measure and I believed that the good
name of the liberal people of this town
demanded that these men who betrayed
the people should be known and marked.
I had held in public print and on the
platform that religion should not disqual
ify a man from public office. I also hold
that the faith which a scoundrel dis
graces should not shield him from merited
punishment. If I were so weak as to be
silent on the deeds of this Board of Su
pervisors because some of the members
thereof profess the Catholic faith I should
Justify every contention of the A. P. A.
Protestants and Jews voted with Catho
lics to stamp out the plague of bigotry.
Catholics owe it to their generous and
faithful allies to show that they can mete
out impartial Justice even when offenders
profess the Catholic name.
The last attack on me is only one of the
many which have been launched against
me by the cowards, the whisperers, the
tattlers, the bullies of this board. The
policy of the Monitor, the policy of this
letter is the logical conclusion of the
light made two years ago. The people
who made that fight then owe it to them
selves to bring it to a fitting close. When
those who have disgraced the cause of
liberty shall have been retired to their
native obscurity, when the Clintons and
the Britts shall have been kicked gibber
ing off the stage, ..ien and not till then
shall the incident be ended and the ghoat
laid.
Before I conclude I beg to thank the
Mayor, Mr. Smith and i..r. Dodge for
their well-meant efforts to sidetrack the
open letter. lam glad, however, they
did not succeed. It has given me an op
portunity to speak to the people of this
city, an opportunity I have long desired.
In this whole matter I think they can
bear me out in saying that I have had
no personal ends to serve, no private
profit to gain. No man is always right
and no doubt I have made many mis
takes, but whether I have been right or
wrong, this I can testify, and I be
lieve the people wijl corroborate my tes
timony .that I have, according to my
lights striven for fair play to all and
'avors to none. PETER C. YORKE.
A DISTINGUISHED
MAN OF SCIENCE
DR. PRITCHETT OF THE COAST
AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
Sails for Hawaii To-Morrow to In
troduce United States Work in
the New Territory.
Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, superintendent
of the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey, arrived in San Francisco last
evening and expects to go to the Hawaii
an Islands on the steamer Mariposa, in
company with the Congressional commis
sion. He goes there under direction of
the Secretary of the Treasury to look af
ter the condition of the surveys of the
islands.
Dr. Pritchett is a young man to hold
the position of the Coast Survey superin
tendency, but he has a distinguished rec
ord as a scientist. Born at Fayette, Mo.,
in April, 1857, he was educated in the in
stitute founded at Glascow, in that State,
jby his father and known as Pritchett
College. In 1576 he moved to Washington,
D. C, and continued his astronomical
und mathematical studies under Profes
.â -â r Asapta Hale of the Naval Observatory,
In 1881 he was appointed professor of as
tronomy in Washington University, at
St. Louis, and remained there until his
appointment by President McKinley to
the superintendency of the Coast and
Geodetic Survey, a position which sought
him as a man of mark In his profession.
In the astronomical field, in addition to
his routine duties he did a vast amount
of work in both theoretical and practical
lines, among his published papers being
one of the determination of the mass or
Mars, another on the rotation of Jupiter,
also a discussion of eclipses of the satel
lites of Saturn, and many papers on ob
servations of double stars.
In geodetic work Dr. Pritchett had a
fine record before being appointed to his
present position. In 18*9 he was a mem
ber of the transit of Venus party that
went to Auckland, Now Zealand, and as
sisted in the determination of gravity
with the famous Koter pendulums in
Australia, Singapore and Japan. In IS9I
he was elected president of the St. Louis
Academy of Science. In 1594 he visited
Europe, and while in Munich the univer
sity of that city, in recognition of his
scientific attainments and reputation,
honored him by conferring upon him the
degree of "doctor of philosophy."
It. Pritchett, though a comparatively
young man, Is an old traveler, having
visited Europe and the Orient and going
now for the second time to the Hawaiian
Islands, where, in all probability, the
Coast and Geodetic Survey of the United j
States will be extended under his direc- j
tion.
A BLACKSMITHS RUIN.
Joseph McDonald Convicted of Fail
ure to Provide for His
Children.
Joseph McDonald, a blacksmith, was
convicted by Judge Joachimsen yesterday
of failure to provide for his five young
children. He was ordered to appear for
sentence to-day, and he will get the limit,
six months in the County Jail.
McDonald deserted his wife and chil
dren in Bunicia In February of last year.
At that time he was foreman In a shop
and making first-class wages. Nothing
was heard of him until last Saturday,
when his wife learned that he was a pa
tient in the City and County Hospital.
At the time of his disappearance he was
a splendid specimen of manhood, weigh
ing about 200 pounds. Now he is a phy
sical wreck from drink and debauchery.
He was yesterday served In the prison
with divorce papers, the suit having been
instituted by his wife Monday.
Reception to Tennessee's Boys.
Tennessee will have an opportunity next
Saturday evening to show its ability as
drillers. The California Commandery No.
1, following in the wake of the grand re
ception tendered the California Regiment
on last Saturday evening by a brother or
ganization, is arranging a similar affair
in aid of the Red Crops Society. Colonel
William Smith is preparing a programme
consisting of scenes of camp life and num
erous other features with a view to show
ing his men off to advantage. Entertain
ments of this kind are rapidly growing in
favor Induing by the large attendance at
the previous drill. Although the audience
was large on that occasion, the society
arranging the coming entertainment be
lieves that the crowd that attends their
drill will surpass it both in enthusasm
and numbers.

HAMBURG IS
THE CHAMPION
Marcus Daly Does Not
Like Matches.
ARRIVAL OF LITTLC SAINT
MR. BRUEN THE NEW STARTER
AT HAWTHORNE.
The Ed Corrigan and John Brenock
Imbroglio and Other Bits of
Gossip From the Ameri
can Turf.
It Is now settled that the two celeb
rities, Hamburg and Ornament, will
not meet on August 10 at Saratoga or
at any other track, at least not in the
near future.
Marcus Daly, owner of Hamburg, has
returned to Montana, and before leav
ing he left orders with Agent W. Jj.
Powers that his colt was not to be en
tered In any match races. The Orna
ment people dodged the Issue in the
Brighton cup, and if the pair meet it
will be in some of the fall staÂ»c3s in
wh?ch both are engaged.
Arthur Bowers, the New York Trib
une's racing critic, seems to be of the
opinion that Hamburg can bent any
horse of any age at any distance from
a quarter of a mile to two and a quar
ter miles, and indeed It looks as if the
New Yorker was right in his conclu
sions.
Richard Croker's $8000 selling plater,
Little Saint,. landed safely in New Yoik
August 2, along with two yearlings by
Dobbins. Little Saint will be sent 10
Saratoga shortly, and if the change of
climate appears not to have worked
any harm to the English colt he will
probably be entered in some of the fall
stakes and raced around New York
City.
Jockey JinT Bozeman, suspended
nearly two years ago, has been rein
stated by the jockey club which he
offended, and will probably ride ii Cal
ifornia next winter. He is at present
in San Francisco.
Ocorona, a filly bred by E. J. Bald
win and raced unprofitably by Jim
Nell, who gave the bad-tempered miss
up as a no-account, has been winning
some good races in Montana.
At St. Louis, August â¢Â», Linda, eh. m..
8, by Linden-Adele, won a seven
and a half furlong race by a
length cleverly, and on the same
day, at Brighton Beach, Lindula,
eh. f., 2, by Linden-Adele, was
easily successful in a six furlong race.
Fireside won the first heat of a five and
a half furlong heat affair at St. Louis
on the Bth, and at Windsor, Ontario,
the same afternoon, Homelike, her
half-sister, three years old, landed a
mile and a furlong race In good time.
Rowland is rapidly enforcing recog
nition of his quality as a sire. Besides
Evelyn Byrd, Rowland Duette and
others by him that have won of late,
Triune, a bay filly by Rowland-Triplet,
captured a five-furlong race for two
year-olds at "Windsor, Ont., August 3,
winning off by five lengths. Rowland,
bred at Palo Alto, is by Shannon, out
of Riglin, by imported Glengarry, and
comes from the same family as did the
immortal Lexington, Salvator, Luke
Blackburn, The Bard, Leonatus and
Volturno. Shannon was an own brother
to Mollie McCarty, who was defeated
but once, that defeat being in the mem
orable $25,000 match race wi \ Ten
Broeck at Louisville on the 4th of July,
1878.
Mr. Bruen, who was booked to do
the starting at Hawthorne track at
the meeting which began last Monday,
is said to be the very best exponent of
the new school of starters brought into
play by the starting gate, introduced
in America by R. E. de B. Lopez of
Australia. He was originally employed
at the St. i>ouls electric light merry
go-round and used to get the skates
there" off head and head and quickly.
When he was given charge of the start
ing gate at Memphis last spring horse
men scoffed at the very idea of giving
such a man work, but their scoffs were
ere long changed into cheers and his
work was pronounced perfection itself.
Last winter Ferguson got to allowing
horses hert to run at the barrier and
the question was often asked. "Of
what earthly r.se is a starting gate?"
it was intended to line horses up
against it and send them away on
nearly if not quite even terms. Mr.
Lopez was by no means an expert at
starting horses, never having had any
practice at i\ yet he could beat Fergu
son, Caldwell or any other person sup
posed to be clever at the business of
dispatching gallopers on heir Journey
"all in a bunch."
The Corrigan-Brenock Imbroglio Is
getting Interesting. Brenoek accuses
Corrigaji of appropriating $150,000 to his
own use that belonged to the Chicago
Racing Association, and wants a re
ceiver appointed, and now Corrlgan
comes to the front and declares: "There
was exactly $71,000 in the expenditure
and this was sanctioned by Mr. Bren
oek, who paid out nearly one-half of
that amount himself, and he knCw
where every dollar of It went." Cor
rigan then goes on to accuse Brenoek
of sharp practice in regard to a check
for $51,750, payable to his order, and
to be used to meet a note of the club
and interest accrued. A suit is pend
ing against Brenoek for $60,000, brought
by the Chicago Racing Association.
The courts will probably soon deter
mine which was the heavy villain in
the racing play, and the result will be
watched with interest by turfmen and
racegoers all over the country.
Tuscarora, a 7-year-old mare that
won a short-course steeplechase at
Windsor, Ont., August 3, is by Imp.
Cheviot-Santa Anita, and was owned
by "Lucky" Baldwin for several years.
He bred her.
Scotch Plaid, a Saratoga winner. Is
by Imp. Midlothian from Mottle, there
fore a half-sister to the fast but faint
hearted Motto, well remembered by our
racegoers. Blue Devil, who also won
August 5, was, like Scotch Plaid, brod
at Rancho del Paso, and is by Imp. St.
Andrew, out of Blue Dress.
LADY BULLER EXPECTED.
How She Happened to Get Into the
Paris Asylum.
Lady Yarde-Buller has not yet arrived,
according to the statements of her cousin
and attorney, E. H. Wakeman. He it was
who accompanied the lady on her Euro
pean rambles, and from whom she sepa
rated herself by accident or design in
Paris and New York. The story Wake
man tells about the eccentric lady of title
is full of color and bold strokes.
It seems that the health of Lady Yarde-
Buller suddenly broke down in i aris and
the advice of several eminent nhyslcians
was sought. A private sanitarium was
recommended, which, as It afterward
developed, was no other than the largest
and most sumptuous private insane asy
lum in Paris. When Wakeman discovered
this he immediately obtained her release,
and after a short stay at Hamburg the
party, Including Mr. and Mrs. Wakeman,
returned to America. In New York when
the Wakemans were expecting Lndv Bul
ler to meet them on the westbound train
she had disappeared. They waited for
over a day, but us all their plans had
been prepared for the return to San
Francisco they could not delay their de
parture from New York any longer. The
matter was placed in the hands of detec
tives, who, as Mr. Wakeman has /been
notified, discovered the object of their
search in Eastern Pennsylvania. Know
ing that Lady Buller is without the pres
ent wherewithal to continue her journey
homeward, her attorney has telegraphed
her money to complete her trip to tnis
city. She is expected within a few days.
SWIMMING AND BOXING.
Cornell and Cavill Will Soon Meet.
Maxwell and Lavlor May Sox.
R. B. Cornell, the coast champion, and
Slrl Cavill, the champion of Australia,
have signed articles to swim a series of
races, viz., 220 yards, BSO yards and one
mile, for a $500 purse and a side bet of
$100. Both men agree to swim the mile
straightaway over a course in the Pacific
Ocean. The other two races are to take
place at Sutro Baths.
Jim Jeffries is on his way home to Los
Angeles. His attempt at stopping two
men in New York in one evening was a
failure simply because Jeffries did not
know how to hit an opponent without in
flicting injury to his hands. Instead of
striking out straight and planting his
knuckles on the epot aimed at, the big
heavyweight swings right and left in
variably planting the thumb side of the
glove on the head or body.
Joe Reay and Ed Hennessy are matched
to fight before the San Jose Club on or
about the ISth inst.
One of the clubs is negotiating with
Sam Maxwell and Jimmy Lawlor for a fif
teen round contest.
The Western Athletic Club is anxious
to consummate a match between Jimmy
Anthony and Young Griffo. This would
be a nonsensical affair and the club would
not do credit to Itself by encouraging
Griffo to remain in this city.
Eddie Graney is very anxious to see
a match between Tom Tracey and "Kid"
Lavigne. This would prove a good attrac
tion provided a club that understands how
to handle a professional fight had the
management. The Olympic Club had a
first-class card but it made no money. It
is an old and a true saying that ama
teurs cannot handle with success the af
fairs of professionals.
NOTES FROM THE
MILITARY CAMPS
THE news from Manila is received
with great enthusiasm by the
Philippine expeditionary forces
remaining in this city, as It leads
them to believe that they will now
be hurried to the front. Many of the
men were beginning to think that they
would not be sent to Manila owing to
the prospects of immediate peace. It
would seem now, however, that they
will all be needed in the Philippines,
peace or no peace.
PRESIDIO EVENTS.
The News of the Wounding of
Captain Hobbs Causes
Deep Regret.
The chief topic of interest at the Pre
sidio post yesterday was the gallantry
with which the Third United States Artil
lery behaved in their recent conflict with
the Spanish at Malate, near Manila. The
meager account of the tight left great
room for anxiety, and universal regrets
were to be heard upon all sides when it
was learned that Captain Hobbs had been
wounded. His wife only recently left for
Pennsylvania, where she was called by
the illness of her mother.
Captain Hobbs was one of the best
known officers at the Presidio. He was
stationed with his battery at Angel
Island.
The Third Artillery band, under the di
rection of Chief Musician R. Reimnitz,
inaugurated the first of its regular Tues
day afternoon concerts yesterday. The
concert was held in front of the aiameda,
and a well-selected programme was ren
dered.
Sergeant Thomas B. Hughes, Troop M,
Fourth Cavalry, has been appointed quar
termaster sergeant, vice Patton, appoint
ed post quartermaster.
The Hawaiian Commissioners visited
the Presidio yesterday morning and wit
nessed guard mount, after which they
were serenaded by the Fourth Cavalry
Band.
The batteries of the Third Artillery
were paid off yesterday by Major Lord.
Troop A, Utah Cavalry, Captain Came
commanding, will not leave for the Yo
semite until to-morrow. First Lieutenant
Nolan, Fourth Cavalry, will accompany
the troop. It was to have left the Presidio
yesterday.
The brigade drill of the Twentieth Kan
sas, Fifty-first lowa and First Tennessee
Regiments was held yesterday morning
up on the gold grounds of the Presidio.
It will be repeated this morning, and to
morrow morning- General Merriam will re
view the brigade.
There were eleven soldiers discharged
from the division hospital yesterday to
go to their homes on furloughs.
Joseph H. Reed, a private in Company
G, First New York Volunteers, died last
evening at the Post Hospital of pneumo
nia after an illness of a few days. He
had served three years in the National
Guard and was only about 21 years of
age. He belonged to a most estimable
family of Utica, New York. In coming
across the continent he became home
sick and never fully recovered his spir
its. He was of a most kind and affec
tionate nature, and the reading of letters
from home always deeply affected him.
When he went to the hospital he was
very downhearted, and expressed the be
lief that he would not recover. His re
mains will be sent to Utica.
The commissioned officers of the First
New York Regiment of Volunteers last
evening attended in full uniform the re
ception given by the Hawaiian commis
sioners.
CAMP BARRETT.
The News From Manila Is Re-
ceived With Much Enthu
siasm by the Eighth.
CAMP BARRETT, Sather Tract, Aug.
9.â Aji examination of the result of the
recent vaccinations was conducted to-day
and it was found that 85 per cent "took,"
and only one company is to be heard
from.
If all the arrangements are carried out
a regimental drill of the Eighth will be
held at Central Park August 27. in re
sponse to the invitation extended some
time ago by the Christian Commission.
The news from Manila has revived the
hopes of the Eighth to be called to the
front.
The Eighth Regiment baseball nine will
play another game next Sunday, and is
also arranging to once more meet the-
Alerts, whom they recently defeated by
a score of 8 to 6. W. Q. Lomax of A
Company Is manager of the soldier
ball players, and the team is as follows:
Frank Clark, catcher; William Bevill,
pitcher; Denwlddle, center field; Thomas
Mack, second base; L. Winters, short
stop; Harry Wilson, first base; Frank
Foster, third bnse; H. Hurt, right field;
Perriago, left field.
A lantern exhibition will be given in
the big tent of the Christian Commission
to-morrow night by Postal Inspector Ir
win and Photographer Jackson. The
views will include many war scenes.
War Incidents.
This morning 154 men of the First New
York Regiment of Volunteers will em
bark on the steamer Mariposa and sail
for Honolulu this evening. T-*e detach
ment is composed of Company E and for
ty-four other men, all under command of
Captain Pickard. The steamer Alliance,
which is to carry the remaining New
Yorkers to Honolulu, is expected here
from the north in two or three days.
The steamer Arizona Is expected to be
ready for the reception of troops by next
Friday. It will be about two weeks before
the Scandla is ready.
Captain F. W. Jennings of Battery C,
United Etates Volunteers, now at the Pre
sidio, from Utah, is a son of the late Wil
linm Jennings, who will be well remem
bered by old time merchants on account
of his having done much business with
this city. Captain Jennings In his youth
was a cadet at the PJplscopal College of
St. Augustine, Benicia.

Sunday Issue there appears an Item stat
ing that a handsome revolver had been
presented to Captain A. S. Clark, the
chaplain of the Seventh California Regi
ment, "by a friend."
It was my privilege and pleasure to rep
resent the generous donor in the matter
of presentation. It was the regulation
army revolver, with belt and holster of
the finest grade that could be purchased
in this city by the patriotic Mrs. A. S.
Townsend, whose liberality and generos
ity to the "boys in blue" has enshrined
her name in letters of "shining gold" in
the hearts of every soldier here or who
has gone to the Philippines. She has spent
her money freely, and it is to be regretted
that other wealthy persons In California
do not emulate her example.

PATENTS AND THE WAS.
C. H. Duell, U. S. Patent Commis-
missioner, Here on a Visit.
C. H. Duell, Commissioner of Patents,
arrived from Washington yesterday, ac
companied by his wife and family. This
is his first trip to the coast, and he ex
pects to spend some time in California,
traveling round the State and visiting- the
various points of interest.
"Yes, I can readily see," he said yester
day at the Palace, "why the people of
this coast wish to hold the Philippines.
The sentiment in the East was at first
against it, but I think they will conform
their expressions to the wishes of the
"West. The advantage and benefits to tms
city in regard to a Far Eastern trade
would be immeasurable and would sharp
en the edge of Pacific coast commerce."
The war has affected the patent fever
somewhat. According to Mr. Duell, there
has been a decrease in patent applications
since the beginning of the war. Alto
gether this falling off of applications av
erages 20 per cent. While the decrease
has been general since the beginning of

HOTEL CLERK "COUGH^J) TTP.'
Two Robbers Armed With Revolvers
Make a Daring Hold-Up and
Then Escape.
Henry Frick, night clerk of the Os
born House. 807 Kearny street, was held
up and robbed at 1:45 a, m. on Monday
by two men. Both robbers were dressed
in black, one being about five feet eleven
inches in height and the other somewhat
smaller.
They came up the stairs leading to the
counter while Frick's back was turned,
and the tall man pressed a revolver to the
clerk's body and ordered him to "cough
up." Besides his watch and chain the
robbers relieved Frick of ?10. Had they
come a little earlier they might have
gained more, as Frick had just taken $50
to his room when they hove in view.
As soon as they accomplished their
work the men backed down stairs and
Frick followed them. They ran through
Portsmouth square with the hotel man at
their heels yelling "Stop, thief!" Up Clay
street the pursued and pursuer ran, and
soon Officers Peters and Fowle joined the
chase, having heard the shouts for assist
ance. At Dupont and Clay the men were
lost among the rookeries of that quarter.
The police expect to capture them, a3
they have excellent descriptions of the
men.

"PLATFORM PLATITUDES."
7 I 'HE necessities of a pinto campaign are forcing
the Democratic bosses into a series of contor
* . tions that are the envy of the boneless man in
'the circus.
,"" Since the Populists nailed up their conditions for
fusion, the office-hungry brethren have had a rocky
road. The Populist programme of State commun
ism, irredeemable paper currency and destruction of
â¢ representative government is so odious to every man
â¢ educated in the Jettersonian school that something
â must be done to sweeten the dose or nullity its
.effects.
''. Down in San Mateo County the committee has
settled the matter satisfactorily to itself by declaring
.that "men, rather than platform platitudes, have be
come a public necessity in this political campaign."
.' Therefore the committee lifts its united voice for Ma-
quire.
. There you have it. These men confess without a
â  blush that their past professions for free silver or
anything else, and their declarations of party prin
ciples, were platitudes, mere flatness, dullness and
insipidity, the real juice of politics consisting in
' getting office, and the process being easier when un
â¢ incurnbered by any pledges, principles or professions.
, It is proper that this plan should be followed in case
of Maguire's nomination. It will enable him to be a
â¢ single taxer in the city, an income taxer to the Popu
lists, and a mixed taxer among the farmers where it
â  becomes necessary to promise that their public load
shall be lightened by shifting it to other shoulders.
â¢ He can be against government by injunction on the
water front and in the mining counties, where his fav
orite doctrine that the violator of a judicial injunction
shall be tried by a jury of the locality where the of
fi-r.se is committed will catch votes; while at Mary*
ville and Yuba City, in the Sacramento Valley and
along the intervales of the Yuba and Feather rivers,
where the people live under government by injunc-
tibn, he can extol it as evidence of the highest judicial
wisdom. In these localities he can demonstrate the
necessity of a court having exclusive charge of en
forcement of its injunctions untrammeled by a jury.
Again, it introduces a gamble into the matter that
will outdo the various lotteries and games of chance
in interest and excitement. Unincumbered by plat
form, principles or pledges, the course of the fusion
party and its candidate will be so much in doubt as
to be always a subject of wager. The plan fits the
candidate to perfection. In 1887 he announced in
. writing his permanent withdrawal from the Demo
â¢ cratic party because it had not adopted the single tax
and put all the burden of government on the land-
owner. In the spring of 1888 he announced himself
â¢ in his book, "Ireland and the Pope," as the champion
of anti-Catholicism and called Pope Leo XIII "the
serpent of the Vatican." In the fall of the same
year he was back in the Democratic party, though it
still refused to adopt the single tax. and not long
after was found on the religious platform soliciting
the favor of the followers of Leo XIII. He was a
gold standard man until 1893, when he switched for
â¢ free silver, and in 1896 voted in the Chicago conven
â¢ tion to unseat Weadock as a Michigan delegate,
' whose head was demanded by the A. P. A. He fought
'the- bill for funding the debts of the Pacific roads, and
demanded their sale under foreclosure. When the
Union Pacific was to be foreclosed he fought that.
Then when Huntington got his refunding bill
.tKrough the Senate at the last session and a single
objection would have killed it in the House, he
" stopped short and did not enter the deadly objection
that would have defeated the measure. It is not safe
to trammel such a man with platforms, pledges or
;' principles. There is no telling what he may want to
â¢do when he gets office. There is one thing that can
be set down as a certainty, however. He is like the
needle to the pole in his fidelity to the Clan Gal
lagher. After the Democratic victory of 1892 this fea
ture in his policy furnished McNab the material for
one of liis Gaelic epigrams. Several offices and ap
â  pointments were lagging. Some one asked McNab
why the delay in filling them, and he replied,
"They're waitin' for a ship that's comin' with another
â ' load of Gallaghers."
"Is General Shafter responsible?" asks an ex
change. He is responsible for having bounced from
Cuba a lot of worse than worthless mischief-makers
who posed as correspondents, and this circumstance
ii enough to make him responsible for everything
else.
. . The fact that all the battles of importance in the
present war have been fought on Sunday does not
leave undisturbed the implied promise of peace in the
" did song, "Every day '11 be Sunday by and by."
The theory that we benefit Spain by taking away
.her colonies has not yet induced that country to send
over a vote of thanks.
â¢ â¢ Rea's modest ambition to become State boss has no
greater obstacle to contend with than the frank oppo
sition o f the State.
CAMPAIGN THOUGHTS.
HENRY WARD BEECPIER once said that
when a boy he could always tell the Sabbath
from other days because in the morning he
observed large numbers of men armed with shot
guns and followed by dogs making for the adjacent
forests. Thus are many things manifested by signs.
Everybody in California knows a "Republican year"
not only by the appearance of large numbers of can
didates for office, but by the persistency with which
the friends of the "good fellows" of politics endeavor
to foist their favorites upon the party. The theory
of the politicians in "Republican years" is that the
people must vote their ticket anyhow. Having their
party voters in the door, as it were, they force upon
them weak and unpopular candidates and defy them
to resist.
So it often happens that "Republican years" in
California are manifested by great activity among the
politicians. The idea of these individuals in making
"fights" is, as far as possible, to keep out of conven
tions all Republicans who think on public questions
or who entertain preconceived notions of what can
didates or policies are necessary to bring success. If
Mr. Gage of Southern California, for instance, were
empowered to appoint the Republican convention
which meets at Sacramento on the 23d inst. he would
fill it with his personal friends. At the hands of these
gentlemen he would, after going through certain
forms calculated to throw dust in the eyes of the
people, modestly accept the honor of a nomination
for Governor and actually consider himself the great
est man in the State.
As a matter of fact both he and Dr. P*ardee have
been endeavoring to do this very thing. They have
no idea whatever of submitting their claims to the
governorship to the sense df an unbiased conven
tion, selected at random from among the best men in
the party; their plan is to get as many of their per
sonal friends elected delegates as possible, and to se
cure from their respective counties "solid" delega
tions. With the assistance of these blind and unrea
soning followers they hope to make "combinations"
and "trades" with the blind and unreasoning follow
ers of other candidates on the ticket who have
worked the same game, and by these means they in
tend to force themselves upon the people. With
strange fatuity they imagine that the appearance
upon the ticket of their names with the word "Re
publican" appended will sweep them into power.
It seems incredible that intelligent human beings
should reason in this way, but the fact that such rea
soning prevails is not only proved by the campaign
which these two estimable and intelligent gentlemen
have made, but it is clinched by the course the bosses
and politicians of the Republican party generally are
pursuing in this so-called "Republican year." Every
where we hear of "programmes," "combinations,"
"trades," stuffed delegations, dummy delegates, pri
mary tactics and the other things, by the appearance
of which, like Mr. Beecher's hunters, we may ascer
tain that a certain kind of day or year is at hand.
We hear that only machine men are to go on guard
in 1898 because it is a "Republican year" and the peo
ple need not be consulted. We hear that candidates
for various offices hope to get on the "slate," and that
this boss or that boss has a man whom he is deter
mined to foist upon the party. We hearâ but why
continue the ridiculous recital? It is a "Republican
year" and anybody can be elected.
But, after all, is this a year when the Republican
politicians can safely be permitted to nominate our
candidates and make our platforms? The war is
over. A month hence it will neither be discussed nor
thought of in this State. The burning and ever
present questions of low taxation, an economical and
honest government, clean appointments and a re
spectable and honest Legislature will recur again
and absorb public attention. Do the Republicans of
California think they can carry this State on the
achievements of Dewey, Sampson, Miles and Shatter
against the personal interests of the taxpayers, the
workingmen and the farming classes? Do they
imagine that a bloody shirt and the old flag are going
to induce the toiling masses to project their yellow
dogs into office?
If they have any such idea we can inform them
now that in pursuing it they are rnshing to their
doom. The Australian ballot has demolished Repub
lican years, yellow dogs and political bosses. The
people must be given candidates in whom they have
confidence and for whom they desire to vote. Can
didates forced upon them by personal friends and
political combinations cannot be elected. The great
necessity of the day is Republican nominees with
records, with standing as citizens, with established
reputations for integrity, free from railroad, corpora
tion and boss control. Only such candidates can
win.
These are frozen ti-uili*. If Ibe Repnb.
liranw do not heed them they -will encoun

CALIFORNIA FRUIT CONDEMNED.
BY the Seattle Times we learn that the fruit in
spector at that city "has declared war on Cali
fornia fruit with a vengeance." It is announced
that on one day he "condemned as utterly unfit for
use nearly 400 boxes of pears and apples, mostly the
former, which reached the city from San Francisco."
In explanation of the war against our fruit the in
spector is quoted by the Times as having said: "San
Francisco has been one of the greatest known quar
antine stations against insect pests on the American
continent. The work has been under the supervision
of a man who stands second to none in reputation
since the death of Professor Riley as a quarantine in
spector, and has been paid a large salary by the State
of California. Nevertheless, San Francisco is and
has been for the last eight or ten years, to my knowl
edge, the worst infected city in the United States
from pestiferous insect pests, and the second is Port
land."
The charge is one which it behooves the authorities
here to investigate. It does not come from an ir
responsible source, nor from one whose opinions are
of no value. When as many as 400 boxes of fruit are
condemned in a single day out of the cargo of a
single steamer, it is clear that our fruit trade with the
north is likelj' to suffer a good deal unless something
is done to remedy the evil.
Californians will of course make no protest against
the action of the officials of other States in excluding
Calif ornian fruit infected with pests. We pursue that
course with such fruit when it comes to us, and we
would be glad to see the same policy carried out
everywhere with inflexible justness and strictness. If
infected fruit is produced in this State and sent to
the general market we wish it exposed and con
demned for our own sakes. It is well known here
that the sooner such fruit is rendered absolutely un
marketable the better it will be for all orchardists
throughout the Union.
This much being conceded, it is not likely that we
will be misunderstood when we protest against the
sweeping assertion of the Seattle official that San
Francisco is to his knowledge "the worst infected city
in the United States" with insect pests. No State in
the Union has exercised a more stringent supervision
THE SAN FRASTCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1898.
over the fruit industry than California, and the or
chardists of no State have given a more general or a
more cordial support to the fruit inspectors in en
forcing the law.
That pests exist in the State is beyond question.
They never can be wholly eradicated. Any such
statement as that credited to the Seattle man is, how
ever, a palpable injustice, and if uncontradicted may
prove to be an injury to our fruit trade as well as a
slander upon the efficiency of our inspection. As
the case is reported by the Times it looks as if the
inspector had allowed his language, if not his official
actions, to be biased by something like a local preju
dice against San Francisco as a fruit market and Cali
fornia as a fruit producing State.
THE country honors the dead who gave to it
their lives. They are to memory dear whether
they perished in the harbor of Havana, before
the withering fire of Cardenas, or sleep, unnamed, in
the trenches about Santiago. Some have found rest
in Pacific waters, and some in the soil of the far Phil
ippines. But to their countrymen these soldier and
sailor dead are all heroes, and to honor them is a
common impulse.
It is a matter of regret that with a precipitation ut
terly shameless, because the hope of self-advertising
was so apparent, Mr. Hearst and his brood should
have proposed a monument to those who have
fallen, for no monument could be builded through
means such as characterize the Journal and Examiner
without being designed to perpetuate the foul repute
of these sheets. To have them even remotely linked
with the enterprise ostensibly designed to commem
orate brave men and brave deeds were an insult un
speakable, far more gross than that there should be
not so much as a tablet of record.
It has not been forgotten that when the scheme
was new the Journal made overtures to solicitors,
promising them 10 per cent of all they might be able
to collectl Is this the method of unselfishness? Does
this savor of decency? Hardly; it is yellow journal
ism. Now the Examiner proposes to have given
here a great pyrotechnic display, to be ujider its own
management, the proceeds to be devoted to the
monument it proposes to have the public erect to
Hearst. The public has been worked to the limit. It
sees through the scheme. It will hesitate about dan
cing to Willies music again, for Willie always gets
the credit and the public pays the fiddlei.
It will be remembered that a season ago the Ex
aminer ran a baseball tournament for "charity."
Throughout there was mismanagement, but the game
was profitable. Occasionally some of the surplus
money would really be given to charity, and then
there would be a great blare of horns as for some
thing magnificent, whereas the stated object of the
whole scheme was that funds might be raised for
charity. No hollower fraud ever disgusted observers
or lined the pockets of a sharper.
There is also a lively recollection of the fact that
the Examiner procured by subscription a sum of
money for the families of some firemen killed on
duty. It retained the money, the legitimate owners
had to bring suit, and even then failed of getting that
which the donors had intended for them, and not for
the Examiner.
Because of these things, more than because of the
unreliability of the Examiner as a newspaper, the
public will hesitate to add to the income of Hearst
a sum out of which he must pay the agent a per cent,
and of which there is no taw to compel him to give
an accounting.
LÂ«t there be a monument to our dead, but let it
be planned by people in whom there is reason to
have confidence, whose motive is something higher
than self-glorification, and who have not devoted
themselves, first to the creation of war, and then to
the accentuating of its horrors. The country is not
ripe for a monument to Hearst. Indeed, that gen
tleman himself is not quite ripe for the distinction,
a circumstance giving rise to varied emotions, among
which regret is not the most prominent.
FIVE DAYS FOR REGISTRATION.
T â \EGISTRATION at the main office at the City
Iâ/' Hall closed yesterday. There remain five days
for precinct registration. Those citizens who
have neglected to register when they might have
done so with comfort, promptness and convenience
during the past weeks will now have to join in the
rush at the precincts. It will be better fpr them to
do that, however, than to forfeit the right of voting,
and it is to be hoped all will attend to it.
Up to this time in all parts of the Union there has
been an evident spirit of indifference among the peo
ple as regards the coming campaign. In his address
on accepting a renomination for Congress Speaker
Reed referred to this feeling as something extraor
dinary, something unprecedented in his experience
with politics. That indifference, however, is rapidly
passing away. The war has been virtually fought
out, peace is at hand, and the attention of the peo
ple is returning to home affairs. It is safe to say
that even now in California more interest is taken in
political news than in war news, and this predom
inance of political interest will increase tintil after the
election.
Those who have expected the coming campaign
will be notable chiefly for its lassitude will be dis
appointed. Those who decline to take the trouble to
register because they believe there will be nothing
in the State or the Congressional contests to arouse
them or make it worth while for them to take an
active part in the determination of the result on elec
tion day will undoubtedly find they have made a se
rious mistake.
In California it is clear the contest is to be one be
tween the people and the bosses, between the repre
sentatives of honest politics and those that stand for
machine politics. In that fight there will be no
apathy in any class of citizens. Every person,
whether he stands for the people or with the push,
will feel a desire to vote, and those who have
forfeited the right by their own neglect will bitterly
regret it.
It goes without saying that the bosses will see to it
that their henchmen are registered to a man. No
votes will be lost to their side. Negligence of politi
cal duties is a vice of the better class of citizens
rather than of the lower class. It is estimated that
about 35.000 persons entitled to register and to vote
have not yet been registered. Five days of grace re
main to them. If their patriotic regard for the pub
lic welfare is eqtial to their intelligence they will not
neglect the opportunity of these closing days. Nor
should there be any delay further than is impera
tively necessary. All who can possibly do so should
register to-day.
There is no room for argument over the terms of
peace offered to Spain. She has only to accept
the peace as it is tendered, or get a little more sense
knocked into her first.
It would indeed be a graceful act for the heirs of
Adolph Sutro to carry out his wishes in relation to
benefactions he designed bestowing upon the city.

.(Â£ tract from Congressman Haguire's
.0 speech.
James G. Mag^iire arrived In this city
last bight from "Washington and opened
his campaign for the Governorship of this
State. His address at Metropolitan Tem
p!e required one hour and three-quarters
in its delivery. He spoke eloquently of
..the war and the noble part played in it
â .by California men and California ships.
He abused his colleagues in the House,
but never one â word on the question as to
whether he -will accept the Populist nom
â l nationâ the question uppermost In the
minds of the people. For the matter of
that he did not hint whether he was a
candidate for the Democratic nomination,
eft her.
.- â  Preparations had been mad- to receive
the Congressman at the ferry and escort
.Mm to the Hail. Owing to delays the pro
cession did not leave Market "and i ffth
streets until S o'clock. The result was
that the uniformed clubs, consisting of
.the Democratic Central. German Central,
iToqucis. Thirty-first District and the Ma
gtilre Club met their guest before reach
ing the ferry.
â  '. iWlth. Congressman Maguire -were Rob
â¢'ert/Ferral. Charles Holcomb and Senator
, T..;E. Tfeacy. The marching men wheeled
;â¢ lnto-.-lise and with bands playing anu ban
/rfers' flying escorted the Congressman to
" S'letropolitan Hall.
â â â¢";" The uniformed clubs, preceded by their
bands,' led the way into the hall, the
: 'throng, rising and cheering Mag-uire when
â¢ ' h-e made his appearance. At this time
....every available point oi vantage was oc
- cupped.. â¢ The speaker of the evening was
â¢introduced by Walter P. Stradley.
â  magjiire acknowledged the warmth of
â  : his reception, saying it was highly grati
â i'y-'-TS 'to be received so kindly tn hits own
..g' : ace: â¢ He took it to mean ratirication of
; h:S course and that he had been received
r ln : ro'-.the- hearts of the masses.
. ' 'SurftiE-s from this the speaker entered
.upon an exhaustive review of the war and
'â  .especially upon the matter of increase-"
.â¢.tixat^on- for its maintenance upon the
â p'7}r â¢ people. He showed how, although
;_-tha .rich and tne poor should contribute
. In ec;v"al proportion to the support of the
<soy"er:-.me"nt. it had not been done in this !
liÂ£atap.ce, the wealth of the rich having !
....been 'exempted from taxation. He in- â¢
â â¢stanced the case of Miss Helen Gould, j
â â -'W'hbVundir.JS that she was not required to j
pay- an adequate amount in war tax. had j
â¢â 'eo'r.jr.te'd a Hundred thousand dollars to j
. . '-Government. He knew of no other
'Instance of this character.
â¢ He. 'touched the hearts of his auditors
â  -with', his tribute to the California men in
"Cuba.. and the Philippines. His references
to 'Admiral Dewey and his California
built-* ship. Oiymp. : a, and the matchless
' .Oregon on the Eastern station, drew forth
thunders of cheers. As to the Phillp
â  pine?'.' he said:
.'â¢â¢What shall be done .th these is>
â¢ lands ultimately I am not prepared to
' cay.. but this I do say concerning them,
. that they should be disposed of accord-
Ing' to the best Interests of our coun
â¢ fry,.- limited only by the consideration of
the "-rights of the people of the several
: possessions, rights that our country re
cognizes and accords to all at home or
abrpad. In the settlement of these
â¢questions those Interests alone all be
considered, and. respecting the rights of
'. the.- people there, those Questions shall be
settled according to our final judgment
of what is the best interest of "our own
â  country without any foreign or extrar.
-â¢eous interference."
â  He attacked Senator Morgan of Ala
| 6ama for his change of heart on the re
â¢ funding bill, showing how for years he
Zia.6. opposed it bitterly, and how h<=- was
, -won over in the last tight by the eorpo
. â  ration interests. In this connection he
attacked Congressman Barham and Loud
..of this" State, blaming them for th" lo<=s
Of. the fight.. He said that they will have
â  to ...explain to their constituents how
they, voted for the refunding measure.
â¢-â¢Their, votes lost the opponents of the !
-measure the votes of men who were 100k
.... representatives of California
â¢ for -guidance in the matter. Their votes
alone, according: to the speaker, coat
enough support from other States to
make' the passage of the measure pos
' â¢fcifcle.
'â¢â¢ â  â â¢"Eq"ual rights to all, spec: privileges

' .He treated of the great fight against
.the funding bill, saying:
â¢ It Is not my purpose to-night to deal gen
erally with the issues of the approaching cam
paign Those issues, I trust, will be formu
lated wisely and well by the Democratic State
â¢ Convention; -which is to meet in a few days.
That, after pledging our Democratic party In
â¢California to the principles of the Chicago
p'.atfortn. to the Issue* for which we have
stood and for which the treat allied force*
stood in the last campaign, they will wisely
determine according to Democratic principles
â¢ how ail other great questions concerning the
people here shall be settled. I said that cor
pora*- Interests, that the aggregated and con
centrated wealth of the country, represented
In its political energy by what has come to be
known as â¢Har.nalstn" in the National Gov
ernment, haÂ« been' talcing advantage of the ex
cltemvnt of the war and the patriotic enthusi
asm'of the people, causing them in the general
â¢Interest and crisis of their country to forget
/.their domestic danger, to make inroads upon
[.'popular rights. An illustration of that is to be
: found In the measure passed in the closing
hours â¢'. the last session of Congress, by which
a' oommisston was created to refund the debts
of the Central Pacific .Railroad. That measure
.has -been variously commented upon.
. 'Senator Morgan of Alabama, a distinguished
" Senator w-ho rendered ub for some years
splendid support and assistance In our fight
..-S.cilrist the refunding of the Pacific Railroad
'debt, stated this morning In an interview that
he considered that the measure recently passed
had placed the Government of the United States
In a better position with reference to the Pa
cific Railroads than it had ever occupied.
Senator Morgan, in an evil hour, was per
suaded to offer that very amendment to the
â¢general deficiency bill. I was never more sur
prised in my life than when I found that Sena
tor. Morgan of Alabama was in the act of
'I.Otroduclng that measure In the United States
Seriate. He defended it there upon grounds
that Indicated that he had been entirely de
ceived as to its purpose and effect. He de
fended it there upon the ground that it would
bring about the same settlement of the Central
Pacific Railroad debts to the Government that
had been secured in the case of the Union Pa
cific. The very contrary m the fact. The
â  measure of which I speak was a measure pro
. vldfing for the creation of a commission to do
but one thing, namely, to provide for refund
ing" th* debt of th? Central Pacific Railroad.
. The Union Pacific Railroad debt to the Gov
ernment was not settled in that way. After
â every possible effort had been made to. secure
.a" refunding arrangement, after every assur
ance possible had been given to every depart
.ment of the Government having anything to
tin with the, matter, that the Union Paclflo
. Railroad could Dot ray its debt to thÂ« Govern
ment, foreclosure proceedings were instituted
Congressman Magnire Discussed Everything but His
Candidacy for the Governorship.
! ar.d carried on to the decree and order of sale.
When the time came for the sale the Govern
ment of the United States simply stood firmly
upon the existing law, upon that grand piece
or legislation known as the Thurmaa act. The
Union Pacific Railroad reorganized and prompt
! ly made a bid for the payment of the entire
' debt to the United States Government. If the
1 Government hid taken the same course with
; the Central Pacific Railroad, either Mr Hunt
ir.gton and his associates at the foreclosure
sale would hare offered and paid every dollar
of the debt due to the Government, or the
owners of one of the ether roads running Into
Ogden would have bought the Oattal Pacific
and established a competing line tor the bene
fit of the entire Pacific Coast. Or, falling that.
the Government would have done its duty. and.
under the act of ISS7, would have taken ue
read ir.to its own possession and. custody and
would have seen that a conticuoÃa highway at
least to the Pacific Coast, according to the
contemplation and declaration of the original
Pacific Railroad act, would have been estab
lished for the general benefit of the people,
aad not for the private enrichment of a few
me:: given monopoly control of the transporta
tion of the West.
Senator Morgan says, and it simply shows
thxt he has not given the. thought to tne ques
tion that he save in the earlier stage* ot the
contest, that the government's position has
b<*Â«n made better than it was before by the
pa-sage of tL'.s measure, la what respect?
There is nothing In the measure that has been
passed that -. the lead improves the govern
ment's position. The debt was due, a large
proportion of it was overdue.
The Attorney General of the United States
â was preparing the foreclosure papers and was
about to institute foreclosure proceedings in
order to â¢:cel the payment of the debt or
to take the read in satisfaction of the claim
of the government. On the 10th of March and
again on the B1 . of March the Attorney Gen
eral wrote letters stating that he was prepar
ing the papers as rapidly as possible; that the
liens of the government of both of these roads
were subject to foreclosure and that he in
tended to proceed. This measure simply ar
rested the foreclosure proceedings. Under the
measure as it finally passed with the Bar
ham amendment one year is given tor the ne
gotiations for a refunding agreement and, set
tlement. - : -'^ 1
The Central Pacific people are bound to noth
ing. At the end of the year, having held the
monopoly of the Central Pacific without paying
a dollar far the year, they may reject the prop
osition altogether and Uncle Sam will be in
no better Boaitlon that he is to-day at the
best. It gives Mr. Huntlngton and his asso
ciates time within which to endeavor to get a
longer period of refunding and a lower rate of
Interest. They shrewdly presented a proposi
tion that they did Dot Intend to comply with.
They knew that they could not get through
a measure like thÂ» Powers bill of the Fifty
fourth Congress, but they got through a bill
that declared for the principles apon which
they wanted to deal with the government. They
got through a bill providing for refunding in
ten instead of eighty-six years, according to the
Powers b:ll. They got through a bill providing
that they must pay 3 per cent interest upon
the unpaid Installments Instead of 2 per cent.
What does Mr. Hunttngton say that they
propose to do? Precisely what I predicted on
the floor of the House. They POM to keep
these negotiations pending with a measure, if
possible, to get the commission to recommend
a longer term and lower interest to the next
ses3'.on of Congress. Mr. Huntington, when in
terviewed a few days after the passage of the
b'.ll, both by the San Francisco Examiner and
Th- Ean Francisco Call, and asked if the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad people intended to settle
according to the terms of this Mil, said eva
sively, "Oh. a great many things might hap
pen thin a year: I have known a great many
things to happen within a year." Again In an
interview with The Call, he said: "I think
there will be changes In this Legislature."
And again, further presenting hie project In a
latÂ»r interview, he said. "We must have at
least thirty years to make the settlement."
By Member next they must have eighty-six
years probably, and tyro per cent interest. But
It doesn't make much difference to us whether
I it is eighty-six years or thirty years", He ex
j pects to hold the monopoly of the Central Pa
cific Railroad by securing a refunding arrange
ment for at least thirty years, continuing the
dominion of himself and his successors over
the Interest and over the transportation of the
I Pacific Coast for such part of thirty years as
j the people of California will tolerate his domin
i ion, and until they either build a competing
I road or until they secure the building of a
I competing road by some one else.
If for any reason hÂ» and his associates should
i accept the terms of the present refunding act,
what would be the rÂ»?ult to the Government of
i the United States? Simply that by the accept
ance of the terra* of the act all the collateral
obligations of all these people to the Govern
ment would be wiped out forever. In no event,
neither in case of failure to accept nor In case
I of acceptance by the Centra! Pacific Railroad
| Company of the terms of this act can the
position of the Government be benefited one
iota.
J} want to Ray of Senator Morgan of Ala
bama that he has fallen into a grievous error
in this manner. He has not looked at the
Que * ,?? f V m l Â£ e /tandpoint of the Interests
of California and of the Pacific Coast He ha.Â«
looked at It from the standpoint of an Ala
baman, In the House of Representatives after
full discussion of the measure "and a vote
taken, every Democrat and every Populist in
: the House, with the .Ingle exception of Mr.
! Bankhead of Senator Morgan's State voted to
repudiate the position taken by Morganâ voted
to sustain the position taken by the Demo
cratic and Populist Representatives from the
Pacific Coast and the Silver Republicans from

made a magnificent fl^ht against the measure,
supporting and upholding us. The measure
was evidently Bought to be made a party
I measure in the closing hours of the last ses
! sion of Congress, and I may say that the time
I was well chosen for the action that wag taken,
i because the session of Congress was dragging
along long after it was expected that the ses
sion would close, and. as always under such
circumstances, a large proportion of the mem
! bers who had made their arrangements to go
i away from Washington in anticipation of
i early adjournment bad gone away. Those who
i left were about the same proportion of West

BOSSISM RECEIVES A
SEVERE SETBACK.
STOCKTON', Aug. 9.â Republican voters to-day sustained at the prim
aries the regular tickets selected at the ward meetings last evening by
overwhelming majorities. It was the- heaviest vote ever polled at primar
ies in the history of the party.
T^he movement was directed against cliques and combines and the best
citizens in the party turned out and worked. The result was tfca death of
boasism in the party. The county convention which meets on Saturday
will be a representative one. The State delegation will go unpledged and
uninstructed for Governor, but much preference is expressed for Davis.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGI^ST 10, 1898.
' Western and Southern men who had gone to
distances varying from 1000 to 3000 miles away.
Tne opponents of the measure were largely
from the South and West. Those favorable to
1 the measure were generally from the railroad
dominated States of the East, within a couple
i of hundred miles of Washington. They were
called back in droves to vote the measure
through. Cooper of Wisconsin, our stalwart
champion in the previous lights, tad gone to
I his State. Ke could not get back until Thurs
' day. I and my associates made every effort to
i Becure three days' debate upon the measure,
but we were only able to secure two days.
I and Cooper was Dot able to get back In time
to take part in the debate or even to vote upon
, the measure. So well contrived was the plan
for getting the measure through that we were
practically powerless to bring cur men back.
, while they had within their power by reason of
. the geographical distribution of their support
: ers ample opportunity to bring them back and
pass the measure. Even then they secured its
i passage by only eight votes with all those ad
' vantages in their favor.
They could not have passed It If our Repre
> sentatives from California had remained faith
ful to their promises. Representative Barham
' of the First District, to whom I nave always
given credit for his fidelity on this question.
I for some reason which he will doubtless ex-
I plain, changed his mind on the question of re
funding the Pacific Railroad debts, and as a
Representative of California, voted for the re
funding measure. That vote lost us the rotes
of the weak Republicans who were looking to
the California Republicans for guidance in the
matter, and his vote alone cost us enough of
Republican support from other States to make
the passage of the measure possible. He must
answer to his constituents of the First Dis
trict I make no further comment on his course
except to ear that In the Fifty-third, Fifty
fourth and Fifty-fifth Congresses the resolutions
of the Legislature of California, the resolutions
of all the public bodies, that spoke In thunder
tones against the refunding of the debts and
! the extension of the period of monopoly To
1 minion, were read upon the floor and urged
as arguments against the passage of refunding
bills. In the Fifty-fourth Congress Mr. Barham
himself. In the course of his speech, produced
and read the resolution of the California Legis
lature, then recently passed, opposing and de
nouncing any refunding or any extension of the
time of payment of these debts. He declare.!
that he stood upon that position and upon that
action of the Legislature in the Fifty-fourth
Congress. Let him answer why he did not
stand upon it in the Fifty-fifth. The measure.
I say could never have succeeded but for the
weakness of Mr. Barbara's action and the
weakness of Mr. Loud's action. Mr. Loud did
not vote for the measure, but Mi". Loud paired,
as he had a right to be paired, with a Demo
crat Mr. Loud will explain his position and
tell you how he was paired upon the bill. I
have nothing further to do with the matter
than to state the facts, and I want to --.ate
here that in my association with Mr. Loud I
hire found him to be a man of much higher
character than a great many have been In
clined to attribute to him. but I rfgret that in
this crisis he and Mr. Barham. by their weak
ness in standing for the people of California
and the Interests of their State, should have in
vited the sacrifice that Is Involved In the pas
sage of this measure. It Is due to Mr. Hllborn,
the other Republican Representative of Cali
fornia to say that In this contest, as in ail the
otter refunding bill contents heretofore, he
stood with in Mr. De Vrtes. Mr. Castle and
Mr. Barlow all stood faithfully by their prom-
IS In the Fifty-fifth Congress the Democrats.
Populists and Silver Republicans, with the sin
gle exception of Mr. Bankhead of Alabama,
etood" Irrevocably opposed to the measure, and
stood firmly by the interests of the people.
The Southern Pacific Railroad. In some sec
tion*, Is mortgaged to the amount of $40 000
a mile. It can be duplicated for J10.5C0 a mile.
Why should the interest on HO. 000 a mile be
laid against the people who" use that railroad
instead of $10,500 per mile for which the road
could be duplicated? .
In my opinion public operation of railroads
is not necessary, and under the Democratic
Idea It is not proper unless It Is necessary to
destroy the monopoly, bat it must be done if
th Government is to reserve Its Independence
of corporate dominion. It mast be done if the
people are to maintain the rights which alone
can Â«ecure to them individual freedom. The
Democratic do~trine-the Jeffersonlan doctrine
-equal rights to all, special privileges to none,
must be the watchword of the future cam
paign- of all parties that have the popular
interest at heart, and that stand for the rights
of "the people against the dominion of man.

MAGUIRE DEFINES HIS POSITION.
States His Views on a Few of the Many Perplex
ing Political Questions.
The time limit placed on Hon. James G. Maguire by the Populists commenced
to run Monday, notwithstanding the fact that his official arrival in California was
noted late yesterday afternoon. Twenty-four hours of the fifteen-day limitation
(wherein he" must either accept of reject the Populist crown) have flown. Twelve
of thf=m passed on the summit of the Sierras, because it was at that point that
the champion of single tax rested for a spell, and "girded up his loini" before
descending: Â»ito the valley wher^ the votes are.
In answer to the Question whether or not he had tarried at Truckee for the
purpose of smoothing out the ruffled feathers of Editor McGlashan, he replied:
"No; my candidacy does not meet with Mr. McGlashan p s approval, and I only
stopped'over at his village in order to give myself and my family an opportunity
of visiting Lake Tahoe for an hour or two."
It was 5 a. m. when Congressman Maguire arrived at Sacramento, but not
withstanding the unreasonableness of the hour, he hastily dressed and, with an
apparent relish, answered the qeustions of The Call representative without the
slightest hesitancy.
Whatever may be said concerning the possible complications attending Judge
Maguire's personal political record he is by no means loth to discuss every
phase of it, and his replies come in rapid succession and without restraint.
There were only one or two questions he did not desire to discuss, among
them was, "What, in your opinion, will be the paramount issue of the coming
campaign?" He evaded this by saying: "Whatever might be my reply to
that question. It would certainly be misunderstood. The diversified local in
terests which will naturally arise in c State campaign would render a re
sponse to that question at this time necessarily incomplete; besides, I must
leave such matters as that to the convention. The convention must decide
what will be the paramount issue of the- campaign. Not I."
â¢â Will you accept the Populist nomination before the meeting of the Demo
cratic convention?" he was asked.
"I have as yet received no official notification of my nomination by the
Populists. When I am so notified I shall then frame my reply. I am, as I
think everybody knows, a Democrat and not a Populist (speaking, of course,
from the standpoint of those organizations in their entirety). While there are
many issues which have separated the two parties in the past, there are many
things In common, and upon which we can meet on common ground. The Popu
lists go farther than we do in many things. It is natural that they should.
The Populists, as you know, are composed of discontented elements which
have broken loose from other parties; fragments, as it were, which have be
come separated from other political organizations for Various causes. They
get their recruits from other parties, and their strength from other sources.
Many joined them from the Democratic party by reason of their advanced be
lief in Jeffersonian principles. They want to go farther than any one else on
certain lines. They took up certain doctrines of a socialistic character, but
you will notice that in their present platform there is a complete absence of
all matters leaning toward a socialistic doctrine. I call the present platform of
the Populists a very conservative one.and I do not hesitate to say that I can
heartily indorse it."
"Do you believe in the initiatory and referendum T"
'"I do. Direct legislation is one of the cardinal principle* of a democratic
form of government."
"What is your idea of fusion?"
"I look upon my nomination by the Populist party as the means and not
the result of fusion. My views on all public questions are well known and when
the question of fusion arose, I. as a Democrat, seem to have "been acceptable to
the Populists, at least to a portion of them."
"Did you make a personal solicitation for their Indorsements
"I did not."
"I presume my friends on that side interceded In my behalf, and If they did so
"Is there anything inconsistent or Irreconcilable between the platform declara
tions of the Populists and those of the Democracy?"
"I think not. There is certainly a great similarity between them on many
public questions."
"What effect will your well known advocacy of the single tax proposition
have upon your candidacy?"
"Just what my opponents will make out of it. My personal views are well
known and I am Â»ot charged in one iota. While my party is not committed to
that theory. I am. and will always take my chances before the people upon my
personal record on that question." Â,,Â»_,Â» Â..
"How do you think It would be received amfcng the agricultural districts?
"I would be just as willing to talk single tax among th* farmers as I would
among mechanics. I can show any man that it is the best system of taxation the
world has ever known."
"Do you believe in income tax?"
"I do as being the next best thing to the 'single tax.' I argued against the
income tax wh^n in Congress, but when the question finally came on as to my
opposition to the Wilson bill by reason of the income tax rider, I withheld it
and voted for the latier."
â¢What change, if any, has there bÂ«en since ISS7, when you sent your letter
of withdrawal from the Democratic party?" Ââ-,..
"The Democratic party of to-day is not the Democratic party of 1887.
"ll^s it changed?*'
"It has."
"Have you changed?"
"I have not; not In the least. Let my opponents publish my letter of 1887.
and they will find it a weapon which will cut both ways. No, sir; the Dem
ocratic party of to-day is not the Democratic party of 1887."
"Do you believe In primaries?"
"I believe in getting everything pertaining to a popular government just as
close to the people as possible."
"Then you do not sanction the act of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee in appointing a committee of one hundred to take the place of primar
ies in the matter of selecting delegates?"
"I have b*en out of the State and am not familiar with affairs locally, con
sequently I should not like to express an opinion on a matter not entirely
understood by myself."
"Will y ou make a canvass of the State?"
"I expect to visit every portion of California personally between this and the
"Have you selected any one to place you in nomination before the Democratic
Convention?"
"I have not."
"Have you a choice for a chairman of the convention .
"I have not."
"Do you know who will be the chairman .
"No: all those matters will no doubt be left to those in whose hands the man
agement of thf convention will be placed."
Speaking of the refunding proposition, as affected by the recent act of Con
â¢rress in attaching it to the general deficiency bill. Mr. Maguire said:
"It is no doubt the design and intention of C. P. Huntington to dally along
with the proposed commission until he has virtually accomplished ail that could
be accomplished under the original Powers bill.
"As matters now stand Mr. Huntington is certainly triumphant, temporarily.
Whether or not his triumph will be permanent depends absolutely on the attitude
and action of the people on the Pacino Coast.
"The election of Barhatn. for Instance, will mean that the people of that
district approve of the Huntington scheme of refunding, for the simple reason
that he changed front, deserted Hilborn and the rest of us. and voted with the
Huntington end of it.
"My election in California will be a vindication of my course in fighting the
Southern Pacific and other corporations all these yean.
"My defeat will mean that the people of California favor refunding, and other
Congressmen in the United States will so accept it."
' When asked why he preferred to retire from Congress at so critical a moment
and preferred a position which would remove him from the possibility of further
continuing his flght, Mr. Maguire replied: .
"I have done all that could be done in Congress. The rest lies with the people.
They are to decide now whether or not they will accept refunding or resist It."
In the matter of acquiring the Philippines, Cuba and Porto Rico, Mr. Ma
ettire said that it was a question to which he had given some thought, and he did
not think it justifiable to "accept the relations of an alliance and then make ene
mies of your allies."
"Whatever may be the determination of this matter, it should be final at the
conclusion of the signing of the articles of peace," he continued. "When this
thing is over it should be over once and for allâ finally, completely and conclu
sively settled for all time to come."

can carry the State. He said:
"The man who leads the Republican party to victory thte year will have
Jto be one in whom the people of the State, and especially of this city,
have the fullest confidence. Mr. Ellert is such a man. His official ca
reer has been above reproach, and in business his word Is as good as his
bond. He is a native son, and it is only natural that his fellow-Califor
nians by birth should rally to hla support if he is placed at the head
of the Republican ticket in the coming election."

WHO IS THE MAN
TO BE SELECTED
AS A LEADER?
Well Known Local Republicans
Express Individual
Preferences.
General Belief That a Strong Northern Man
Should Be Placed at the Head of
the Ticket.
A number of prominent Republicans
were interviewed yesterday concerning
their views as to which of the several
prospective candidates for Governor
would prove most acceptable to the
vo-tera of the State. These expressions
of personal opinion are submitted here
with for the benefit of such of The
Call's readers as have the welfare of
the State at heart:
R. J. TECHAU, formerly of the Good
fellow's Grotto, favors Ellert because
his record aj a Supervisor and Mayor
was good and for the further reason
that he is a San Franciscan.
A. C. BAUER, a member of the pres
ent Grand Jury and proprietor of a
restaurant on Market street, favors
Ellert because his record is clean as a
public man in this city.
LEÂ£ PALMER, formerly of Sonoma
County, but now proprietor of the
Palmerlee Hotel, favors Gage as being
the coming man.
GEORGE W. REID, merchant-gro
cer, 152 Seventh street, is in favor of
Lou Brown and considers that no
stronger man can be found in the State
to-day. If nominated he will surely be
elected.
LOUIS SLOS3 JR.â I have not given
the subject any consideration and have
no choice for Governor. The Repub
lican delegates ought to be able to
select a strong man from the number
already named. There are several men
mentioned whom I should like to see
elected.
L. H. BONESTELL, paper dealerâ l
should like to see John H. Dickinson
nominated and elected. He is a good
man and has been unjustly vilified and
maligned by the newspapers. I should
like an opportunity to vote for him.
H. T. HOLI.IES, brick and lime deal
er Sacramento streetâ l have not taken
an active part in politics for several
years and am not very familiar with
the present condition of affairs. Irving
M. Scott would make an excellent Gov
ernor and so would a number of others
who aave been mentioned. Personally
I have no choice. The man selected by
the- State Convention will get my sup
port.
T. L. GREGORY, business man and
politician. Fort Bragg, Mendocino
Countyâ l think George A. Knight is
favored for the Governor's chair and
will carry For Bragg if nominated.
Ex- Senator Frank McGowan is the
choice for Lieutenant-Governor.
GENERAL S. W. BACKUSâ I believe
the candidate who develops the great
est strength at the convention should
be the nominee of the Republican party.
I expect to be a delegate, and, there
fore, do not wish to designate my per
sonal choice, even if I had one.
C. F. CURRY. County Clerkâ l have
no personal preference. The man who
shows the most strength in the conven
tion should be nominated. The coming
convention ought to be a nominating
convention and not a elate ratification.
R. B. MITCHELL, Attorneyâ l con
sider L. R. Ellert the logical candidate
for the Republican nomination for Gov
ernor. His strength in San Francisco
is a strong feature in his favor. He
would be able to reduce the vote for
Maguire to a larger extent than any
other man the Republicans could name.
Mr. Ellert is also gaining strength dally
In the country and this is indicated by
The Call's canvass of yesterday. After
the local choice he was second in the
majority of opinions expressed. The
fact that he is the second choice every
where is indicative of his popularfty.
DANIEL METER, Capitalist and
Bankerâ L. R- Ellert is my choice for
Governor. I consider him the strong
est and best man named as a probable
candidate.
LOUIS P. BOARDMAX, Attorneyâ l
think Gage is the strongest man for the
position. He will go to Sacramento
with a solid delegation from south of
the Tehachapi, and I do not think that
his claims can be ignored by the con
vention.
JOHN A. RUSSELL,, Chief Clerk
Board of Supervisors â I have not given
any consideration to the subject as yet,
but I think the strongest man from San
Francisco would be ex- Mayor L. R. El
lert.
DR. J. NIGHTINGALEâ I have Just
got out of a sick bed and have paid
little attention to the political world,
and. therefore, would not be Justified
in giving an opinion on the subject. ]
have always been a Republican and
will abide by the decision of my party.
JOSEPH C. CAMPBELL, Attorneyâ
I really have not given the matter any
thouirht The choice of the convention
will be my choice, and I will give their
selection my most earnest support.
TIREY L. FORD, Attorneyâ ln my
Judgment the choice of the convention
will be the people's choice, and there is
no picking a favorite at this time. It
is an open race. They are all good
men and worthy to fill the office.
E. F. PRESTON. Attorney â I am not
pledged to the support of any individ
ual for the nomination of Governor. I
hope to see a man nominated to head
the ticket who will, by virtue of his
mental attainments and life record,
have established conclusively his fit
ness for such a high and responsible
position. He should be a natural leader
by virtue of his standing among men,
and be a man to whom all can look
with confidence and respect. There is
IRVING M. SCOTT NAMED
AS THE COMING MAN.
D. J. STAPLESâ I said to a number of my friends the other day who
were talking of Charles N. Feltonâ who, by the way, is one of the ablest
and squareat of men â that I knew a man who could be elected Governor
hands down. They asked me to name the man, and I said, "Irving' M.
Scott." I also madÂ© this remark to Georg-e Knight before I knew that
George was a candidate himself. I said we could not win with Estee, as he
was, like myself, too much of a "has been."
no lack of men In the Republican party
who possess these qualifications in an
eminent degree, the name of any one
of whom will satisfy the people of the
State that under a Republican adminis
tration he will give a clean and honest
government, with due regard for the
rights of all and a just and fearless
execution of the laws of this State.
This is the interest of every citizen,
and I trust will be the endeavor of ev
ery member of the convention.
D. S. DORN, Attorneyâ George Par
dee of Oakland Is the strongest political
candidate for Governor, though they
are all good men. I mean that I think
he Is the strongest political!?.- as he has
a strong backing and friends who will
make a fight for him.
COLLECTOR OF THE PORT JACK
SON â Urn. ah: No opinion. Federal
officer. Not allowed to talk politics.
Will express my private opinion at the
polls when I go to vote.
THOMAS D. RIORDANâ I cannot
say anything in relation to the subject
because of my connection with the Re
publican County Committee. If I were
not in politics â simply a private citi
zen â I could give you an opinion, but
under the circumstances it would not
be in good taste for me to do so.
GEORGE W. DIXON, ex-Assembly
man from the Thirty-seventh District-
Was favorably disposed to either GagÂ«
or Felton, both were good men, but
he considered that if Gage would come
into the convention with a solid home
delegation he would come very near
carrying away the plum, and in case
he should go before the Republican
party would be a very strong candi
date. Thought that Felton stood well
with his party and with the people of
the State and would be a very hard
man to defeat if nominated.
JTTLIEN SONNTAG, General Mana
ger of the Giant Powder Company-
Favored Gage, or in the case of his not
getting the nomination then Felton; as
he considered both very strong men.
Gage, who is a new man in politics, is
not as well known as Felton, and some
times this is an advantage in running
for office. But Gage should, in order
to go strong before the people, have
his home delegation with him to a
man.
PHILIP L. ARCHIBALD, Grand Die
â  tator of the Knights of Honor â Had
just returned from an extensive trip
through the San Joaquin Valley, and
was free to express it as his opinion
that while Davis, Gage and Brown
were well spoken of, yet Da%*is was in
the le^td and would undoubtedly poll
the stronger vote from the Republicans
in that section.
W. R. MORTON, President of the
Morton Special Delivery Company, and
at one time a Republican County Com
mitteeman â Had paid but little atten
tion to the list of candidates mentioned,
but from what he had heard his men
say he was under the Impression that
Lou Brown was far stronger than any
other candidate that he had heard men
tioned. Brown had a good clean record
to go before the people with, and that
is what Is required at this period.
LOUIS PoCKWITZ. member of the
State- Central Committee from the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District, ex
pressed himself as being satisfied with
either Flint or Brown as both are
strong men befor- the people, yet tak
ing it ail together he considered Brown
to be the stronger of the two. This
conclusion he reached in consequence
of Brown being a* present in office and
thereby being much better known by
the people of the State. He would not
have to oe introduced, a it were, to
the Republican voters when the time
arrived for them to cast their votes for
the Republican nominee.
JUDGE F. W. VAN RETXEGOM
was not well posted on the list of can
didates coming before the Republican
convention and consequently had not
thought much over the merits of any
in particular, except as to Attorney-
General W. F. Fitzgrerald. "If," said
he, "Judge Fitzgerald should enter the
race and get the nomination I know
of no man better fitted for the office
of Governor of the State. He would be
a very strong man before the people
and one that the Democrats would have
to trot out their very strongest leader
to defeat. Judge Fitzgerald is well and
favorably known throughout the entire
State. Since he first made his ap
pearance in State politics some ten
years ago In the southern portion of
this State where he had resided for a
number of' years he has been regarded
with much esteem by all who came in
contact with him. Since coming north
he has held very responsible positions.
He was a Supreme Court Commissioner
and afterward a Justice of the Supreme
Court, which place he left to take
charge of the office of Attorney-Gen
eral of this State. He was elected by
a very handsome plurality and the
manner in ' hlch he has conducted the
office reflects the highest credit on him.
His handling of the railroad case before
Judge McKenna has conclusively shown
that he is for the people against cor
porate bodies v.-hen he believes that the
people's rights have been infringed
upon. On the whole I firmly believe
that no better nomination can be made
than that of Judge Fitzgerald. He has
all of the qualifications befitting the
high office of a Governor of a great
State like California."
OSCAR LEWIS, Manager of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation, is of the opinion that Henry T.
Gage would make a very strong man
for a fight against the Democratic,
Populist and pinto combination of these
two parties. He said: "There is but.
one thing that the people will hold
78
against Mr. Gage, and that is his rail
road connections. His affiliations with
the railroad may not be bo strong that
they would stand against him. and if
riot he would be a powerful candi
date."
" . H. H. TAYLOR, Agent for Mills
â¢ Buildingâ l believe ex-Mayor L. R. El
. lert would be the best man the Repub
' . licans could nominate, and I should like
â¢ to pee him at the head of the ticket
this fall. As a pood Republican I will
Support the ticket, whoever is nomin
ated..
COLONEL D. E. MILES, Assistant
Manager London and LancashlJe In
surance Companyâ The choice of the
Republican delegates to the State con
vention will suit me.
CHARLES SMITH, Secretary Dewey
Central Republican Clubâ Personally I
am in favor of L. H. Brown, and I
should like to see him nominated by
the Republican party, but I shall sup
port the ticket, whoever is at the head
of it.
THOMAS M. CLUFF, Grocerâ l am
â¢ for General John 11. Dickinson for Gov
ernor, and I think he ought to receive
the nomination. I am a Republican
...first, last and all the time, and will
â work for the man selected by the State
convention.
WILLIAM A. HALSTED, Under
takerâJohn H. Dickinson is my choice
for Governor. I will support the ticket.
JULIUS JACOBS, Assistant United
States Treasurer at the Local Sub-
Treasuryâ lf Dr. Pardee is nominated
by the Republican party for Governor
1 think he will make a good, strong
Tight. Of coarse there are a number of
prominent men whose names have been
mentioned In connection with this of
fice who would no doubt have a. good
chance, but I believe that Dr. Pardee is
as strong as any named so far.
SPENCER BUCKBEE, Real Estate-
There are many strong men already
named for the honors of the position,
but I am of the opinion that if George
A. Newhall received the nomination he
would carry the State from one end to
the other. The Newhalla have a strong
hold upon the sympathies of the farm
ing community, and the name carries
prestige wherever it is spoken. From
a personal standpoint I would like to
gee Mr. Xewhall given the nomination,
and from a general standpoint 1 believe
he would make the strongest candidate
the Republican party could put to the
front.
GROVE P. AVERSâ I am for the
candidate of the convention. Several
men already mentioned would make
excellent Governors and I have no per
sonal choice. I expect to go to Sacra
mento as a delegate and will sup
port the man who shows the greatest
strength.
UNITED STATES SENATOR PER
KINS â The nominee of the convention
will be satisfactory to me. I have no
personal choice.
M. 11. I>H x*OUNG â I do not care to
express my preference at this time.
When the proper moment arri\
Khali take a stand In accordance with
my opinions.
JUDGE J. A. WAYMIRE, ex-Speak
er of the Assemblyâ Three personal
friends of mine in Alameda County are
mentioned as probable candidates for
Governor and I should lÂ».' glad to sup
port any one of them. However, I
wish to say that I will support the
nominee of the convention.
GENERAL W. H. L. BARNESâ I be
lieve Gage is the strongest candidate
In the field and I think he would be
tlected if nominated. If the Alameda
County Republicans would stop fight
ing among themselves they might get
the candidate, but they won't stop
â wrangling and of necessity the nomi
nee must come from some other section
of the State.
SUPERVISOR JOHN LACKMANNâ
I think Ellert is the strongest man
. the Republicans could name in the city
or State. He could keep Magulre's vote
down to the normal Democratic level
In this city and beat the Judge in the
country. At the Freeholders' election,
held here on December 27 last, Ellert
ran on the Merchants' Association
ticket. He ran ahead of the highest
man on his own ticket by about 1000,
and beat Lloyd, the highest man on the
fusion ticket, 3300. Had all the votos in
the city been cast Ellert would have
been elected Freeholder by about 8000
majority. At the December election,
you will remember, only 26,000 votes
vere polled. He once tarried the city
for Supervisor by 10,000 majority. El
lert, in my opinion, is just as strong in
the country as here. I meet men from
'the interior every few days who tell
me he is regarded in many localities
.as the only man who can defeat Ma
guire. I am a personal friend of the
ex-Mayor, but I would not express
these opinions if I did not believe the
facts would bear them out. My friend
ship for him would not lead me to
either mislead the Republican party or
raise false hopes in him or among his
friends. In my judgment, If the con
vention wants a winner who will sweep
all before him, he Is their man.
I. J. TRUMANâ Attorney General Fitz
yemld is an able man â a man of great
strength and firmness. His record is good,
1 should say h<- is my first choice and Sec
retary of State Brown my second.
WILLIS E. DAVlSâ lrving M. â  Scott j
could be e.lected. He is a man that' would
command a large support outside of his |
party. C. N. Frlton is also an able man j
und Would make an excellent Governor.
Mr. Scott would be my first choice and
Mr. Felton my second.
ML H. WEEDâ Why not go outside of
the list and take up, for example. Judge
Slack? He is a clean man of high charac
ter and fine intellect.
ALBERT MILLERâ The office should
seek the man, and no man should seek the
office. Irving M, Scott is a man of the
right sort.
GENERAL LUCIUS 11. FOOTEâ My
choice without hesitation is Irving ftf.
Scott, but it would depend upon Dr. Chis
inore to say whether Mr. Scott should
accept. I have no second choice. There
would be no doubt of Bcott'fl election. So
many men of all classes are attached to
him that he would get a. very large vote.
!!<â¢ would carry San Francisco against
any opposition candidate.
ARTHUR MOOREâ lrvinf M. Scott Is i
my first choice, but I recognize the popu- I
larity and strength of eGorge A. Knight.
In my judgment the convention could not
do better than to nominate Scott or
Knight.
COLONEL J. C. CURRIERâ Gage has
strength In the southern part of the
State. Ho is able and popular and has a
way of making friends among the people
He is my first choice. George A. -Knight
lias qualities that endear him to every
body. He could beat Judge Maguire right
here in San Francisco. In the northern
counties of the State he has a legion of
friends. i
PHIL. LILIENTHALâ It is not wise for
any man to express an opinion.
W. B. CLUEFâ I~diÂ¥ dabble a while In
politics, but I am out now, and mean to
stay out. The nomination of Irving M.
Scott for . Governor would â¢ bo a strong
one. , ;.:.:,,.;â ;.â¢;
COLONEL W. R. SMEDBERGâ I have
heard Gage very highly spoken of, but I
do not. know- him. My first choice is Irv
ing M. Scott, and I have no second choice.
GEORGE W. GRANNISâ M.
Scott is my. "first â¢ choice and George A.
Knight my second.
WILLIAM ALVORDâ I am a Police
Commissioner and cannot talk. Why, look
at the statutes. The law will not ;i!i"\\
me to talk until one year after 1 am out
of office. .â ....
W. W. MONTAGUEâ As Postmaster it
would not be proper for me to express a
preference.
TOEODORE.PAYNE- Why not take up
a new man and nominate John L. Beard.
He is a farmer and a good man.
DR. J. PERRAULT-^-Ellert cou'd be
elected if nominated, as he is known to
the people of the State as an honest and
capable man who has been tested In pub
lic office. Gage is unknown and I .doubt
If he could be elected*
PARDEE'S FRIENDS
MARVEL AT THE
"CALL'S" FIGURES
Surprise Manifested at His
Weakness Outside of Ala
meda County.
The Doctor Pledges His Delegates to Both
Davis and Brown Within an
Hour.
OAKLAND. Aug. 9-Probably the
greatest jarring Dr. George C. Pardee
lias received since he crawled back Into
the Republican party, which only recently
he delighted to revile, and announced
himself as a candidate for gubernatorial
honors, was the result of The Call's can
vass of partisan editors throughout the
State as to the preference in their locali
ties for Governor, and finding himself
sixth in the list of nine aspirants. To
add to his mortification, Dr. Pardee finds
his strength practically limited to his own
county, few people elsewhere seeming to
be aware of his candidacy, or if they are
to not take it seriously.
The pall's canvass has also opened the
eyes of every supporter of Dr. Pardee in
Alanieda County to the fatuity of the
doctor's canvass. It only makes plain
what has often been stated that Pardee
has stumbled on blindly imagining- that
Alameda County comprised the State of
California, and that the only thing neces
sary to assure him the nomination was
to go to Sacramento with a solid, or prac
tically solid, delegation from this side of
the bay.
Moreover, Alameda Republicans are
convinced now that W. K. Davis has
much more strength in the interior than
he had been given credit for and they
are already beginning to seriously ask
themselves if it would not be to the de
ciued advantage of the county for them to
cast aside their personal choice as be
tween the two men and unite on Davis,
in the hope that with Alameda's sixty-,
eight votes solid with the strength he has
already developed in other sections, he
may be able to firing the nomination to
this county, a thing Pardee's stanchest
friends now admit the doctor cannot by
any possibility do.
Needless to say, Pardee will refuse to
publicly read the handwriting on the wall,
but will struggle to hold his friends in line
to the end, hoping against hope that
Dame Fortune may yet smile on nim. De
termined to fight to the last ditch. Dr.
Pardee is entering into every possible
combination to bolster himself up in Ala
meda County, paving no attention what
ever to the remainder of the State. (Â»â¢*
continues to make his mighty plea to have
the Alameda delegation governed by the
unit rule, pledging on his part to exert
every effort on behalf of Davis should the
latter secure a majority of the delega
tion. He believes he is entirely safe in
making this pledge in view of his care
fully laid plans to import the Buckley-
Maguire tons of highbinders to "assist"
him at the primaries.
But though Pardee publicly makes this
proposition, there is that secret deal with
Lou Brown, whereby the Pardee strength
is to go to that candidate at the proper
time.
Of course with his public declarations
of friendship for Davis and his secret al
liance with. Brown, it is only natural that
people are doubtful of Pardee's sincerity
toward â¢ either. And in this connection
there comes a story from Haywards
showing more plainly than anything else
the. desperate straits Pardee is driven to
and the utter' unreliability of his prom
ises.
Last Sunday, in company with Assessor
Henry Dalton, Dr. Pardee went down to
Hay wards in the furtherance- of his. role
of dictator, ajid to select the men for his
ticket whom he will attempt to force Re
publicans to vote for without giving them
a voice in the selection. Pardee called
upon Daniel Chisholm of Haywards and
sought to persuade that gentleman to
run as delegate in Pardee's behalf. Mr.
Chisholm Informed the doctor that he
was personally for Davis, whereupon Par
dee assured him that in case he (Pardee)
did not secure a majority of the delega
tion he would turn those he did 'get over
to Davis.
Less than an hour later Pardee called
on J. W. Thomford. who the night be
fore had been nominated delegate by
friends of Mr. Davis. When Pardee asked
him for his support. Thomford said he
personally was in favor of Lou Brown
for the nomination. This did not dis
concert Dr. Pardee in the least, for he
assured Mr. Thomford that if he failed
to secure a majority of the Alameda del
egation he would turn all his delegates
over to Brown.
Pardee declared to both Chisholm and
Thomford and to others in Haywards as
well, that he had 59 of the CS delegates In
the county safe. Thomford took time to
consider Pardee's proposition and later
in the day sent the doctor a message
stating that under no consideration
would he go to Sacramento as a Pardee
delegate.
There you have a perfect Illustration of
the kind of man Pardee is and his way
of "doing" politics. Two promises to give
his votes to as many different candidates
in less than an hour. If Dr. Pardee were
to go to Los Angeles It is only reasonable
to suppose he would make the same
promise to Gage's supporters.
But if Dr. Pardee is doing this kind of
work regarding the other gubernatorial
candidates, it Is no less certain that he is
mixing up in the Congressional fiffht In
the same manner, and while he has
shown no indication of divorcing- himself
from Hilborn, he is flirting most out
rageously with those of.Metcalf's friends
whom he believes to be at all partial to
mm. In a word, Pardee is "playing both
ends against the middle." and while he
may deceive a few of the Metcalf men
his notorious alliance with Hilborn- is
steeling the hearts of many others
against him.
Davis' friends are very angry at Par
dee's attempts to force them into agree
ing to the unit rule to govern the Ala
meda delegation, and point to it as merely
another proof of the doctor's entire lack
of sincerity. Only a few years ago, when
an effort was made to bind the Oakland
delegation to a county convention to the
unit rule, the Seventh Ward delegates
fought the proposition bitterly, and Judge
Fifleld drew up a protest against it wlMch
was signed by himself. Dr. Pardee and
W. A. Dow. Dr. Pardee was then < as
strongly opposed to the unit rule as he is
now in favor of it.
With their election or delegates to the
State convention to take place to-mor
row afternoon and evening, about the
only signs of activity in the Democratic
camp is the signlr^ of the club rolls.
J. G. Maguire, tfie "Little Spotted
Giant," swoope"d down upon Oakland
this morning, but there was no blaring
of trumpets or waving of Hags, and the
gentleman who aspires to give a simul
taneous performance in two rings was
permitted to rest quietly "during the day
in his hotel, undisturbed by the glad
some acclaims of Southern chivalry and
bewhiskered Populists. Instead, every
body is enjoying a quiet laugh at the
little Congressman's expense. ' Maguire
stopped over at Truckee on his way homo
from Washington, where he learned all
about the preparations underway in San
Francisco to whoop him up as much as
possible on his arrival. In order to help
along the boom Judge Maguire consented
to remain In Truckee until this morning,
â when he was to. take the train, arriving
In the city this evening, and be escorted
from the ferry by a choice assortment of
Democrats and Populists, to the strains
of as many brass bands as the crowd
could afford to hire.
One can Imagine the enjoyment j the
Judge derived from picturing to himself,
while lounging by the banks of beautiful
Dormer | Lake, . that mighty turnout in
his honor. In fancy he could see Billy
Foote and Tom Cator, each armed with
a Roman candle pirouetting up Market
street, fairly endangering the lives of the
spectators by their reckless exuberance.

was loudest Colonel Sullivan and Major

glare of the 20 cents' worth of red light
touched off on the balcony of the joss
house at Third and Market streets.
All this the Judge pictured to himself,
and he joyed at being the hero of the
occasion. But his manager came near
spoiling the whole beautiful scene by
dragging him aboard the train last night.
In vain the Judge protested; he could
not waste any more time in Truckee, so
he came on. But when Sixteenth street
was reached he rebelled. He wasn't go
ing to bust up that procession by getting
into town twelve hours ahead of time, so
off he got, and that is the reason Oak
land was honored with his presence to
day. The Judge crossed the bay this
evening and San Franciscans know all
about his reception there.
Victor Metcalf to-day made the follow
ing self-explanatory statement regarding
his candidacy for Congress in answer to
reports Industriously circulated by his op
ponents' friends:
"I have heard it urged against ray
candidacy for Congress that i really do
not care for the place, and that if nomi
nated and fleeted I would serve but onÂ©
term for the sake of such honor as niay
attach to the position. This is unjust.
"I became a candidate only after long
and serious consideration, under the con
viction that I could, if elected, serve my
district well, as I know I would serve
It faithfully. Once chosen. Congress
\rould be the field of my life work, and
I should expect to be returned so long
as that work was acceptable to my con
stituents."

HIS POPULARITY UNDIMMED
LOS ANGELES IS SOLID FOR R. J.
WATERS.
Programmers Are Threatened With
Strong Opposition at the Pri
mary Elections to Be Held
Monday.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 9.âProgram
mers from nearly every point "south
of Tehachapi" presented themselves at
the headquarters of Henry T. Gage,
Republican candidate for gubernatorial
honors, in the Hollenbeck to-day. If
a man is to be judged by the company
he keeps, it would not be a stretch of
the imagination to say that Mr. Gage
Is In the hands of men who for years
have been identified with the railroad
Interests of this section. It may be
true, as the claim has been made, that
the Interest taken by these old politi
cal railroad hacks Is purely out of
friendship for Gage and not in compli
ance with instructions from the mana
gers in the "yellow building," but it
will require a great stretch of the im
agination to believe that these same
political manipulators have suddenly
turned their backs to the corporation
from which they have so long sucked
pap.
Gage himself Is a popular man in this
city, and haÃ many warm friends who
regret to see' him associate with men
of marked railroad proclivities.
Some of them believe that he is
only playing for the railroad vote,
and that he is not tied up to the
corporation, while there are others who
claim that he could have made a fight
on much more popular lines and kept
himself entirely free from the taint of
the monopoly influence. Since the
withdrawal of James McLachlan late
last night, R. J. Waters has no oppo
sition for the nomination for Congress
man In the Sixth District, and it is
conceded that he is one of the most
available men for the place. Besides
being a popular man he has large In
terests here, which it is believed would
be an incentive for him to work zeal
ously for the district. As he is on the
programme slate it is not expected that
a dark horse can at this late day enter
the field and overcome the odds In his
favor. At the Republican caucus held
In the various precincts throughout the
county to-night for the purpose of se
lecting delegates to be voted for at the
primaries to be held next Monday a
complete programme ticket was named.
There will, however, be several oppo
sition tickets In the field on Monday,
not as against Gage, but In the inter
ests of certain candidates for local of
fices who are dissatisfied with the tick
et named by the caucus. The Demo
cratic County Convention to be held
here to-morrow promises to be a
"warm baby." The Magrulro-fusion ele
ment will have control by a small ma
jority. It is expected that the "push"
will make a hot fight notwithstanding
their being in the minority.

BATTLE OF BALLOTS TO-DAY
THE CZAR FIGHTING HARD FOR
THE PRIMARIES.
Determined to Carry the Day at All
Hazards, but Honest Repub
licans Will Be on
Guard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 9.â Boss Rea, the
Mackenzies and their lieutenants held
several conferences to-day and plans
were gone over for the capture of the
primaries to-morrow. These were com
pleted and the machinery was well
greased and got into readiness.
Never before has the ring been so
worried over the outcome of primaries,
and never before have such desperate
means been decided upon in order to
carry the elections. The principal fight
will be in the city, where Rea has all
the election officers. He has decided to
get control of the delegations from the
First and Fourth wards. To accom
plish this there will be a wholesale vot
ing of gang Democrats, and if this is
not sufficient to offset the efforts of the
honest and fair voters the ballot boxes
will be stuffed. Orders have been given
to the election officers to take no
chances of losing the election, and these
will be carried out implicitly. In the
outlying districts the gang is not so
sure of being able to handle the voters,
but will depend a good deal upon secur
ing the country delegations with empty
promises.
Besides the usual rounding up of Its
forces, the gang has summoned all its
workers who are out of town. All the
soldier boys friendly to Rea in Com
panies U and M, who could possibly
get away, are home in the interest of
machine politics. These with the Dem
ocrats who will assist Rea make quite
a showing.
Combating these Influences and
fighting for the purification of the Re
publican party are the Good Govern
ment Club and independent Republi
cans. They are well organized through
out the county and Jjave placed oppo
sition tickets in the field In nil the pre
cincts. They claim they will win most
of the country districts, and present in
dications support this claim. Their
tickets contain the names of the besi
citizens of the party, and this should
go a long way toward electing them.
The delegates to the State and Con
gressional conventions named by the
Good Government Club are as follows:
Fifty-fourth Awombly Districtâ !â¢. Harn
hisel, Willow Glen; W. A. Clark, Moun
tain View; D. 11. Coates, Campbell: fs. G.
Hurlburt. Campbell; K. C. Hurff. San

Santa Clara; T. C. McChesney. College
Park; Alexander Peers, Mayfleld; S. P.
Sanders, Moreland; J. J. Sontheimer, San
Jose; C. Jones (at lurg-e), San Jose.
Fifty-fifth Assembly Districtâ T. Ellard
Beans, San Jose; J. Coykendall, Hester;
i. P. Freitag, San Jose; N. A. HaskeTl,
San JoÂ«t>; \V. D. McDougall, San Jose; J.
R. Patton, San Jose; Mitchell Phillips,
San Jose; A. E. Wilder, San Jose; Major
A. K. Whitton, San Jose; W. H. Wright,
San Jose; C. Jones (at large), San Jose.
Fifty-sixth Assembly Districtâ F. 11.
Babb, Berryessa; E. H. Farmer. Gllroy;
George H. Foster, Saratoga; Jonathan
Ilat?ue, Solis; E. W. Herrold, Morgan
Hill; Simeon Holland. Evergreen; W. W.
Parks, Alviso; J. J. Stanfleld, Los Gatos;
B. P. Shuler. Los Gatop; O. Stevens. Coy
ote; E. Topham, Mllpitas; C. Jones (at
largei, San Jose.
These are strong tickets, and if the
Republicans who are opposed to boss
ism and corrupt politics turn out and
work at the polls they are sure of suc
cess. The delegations will be a credit
to the Republican party and Santa
Clara County at Pacrarnento. as they
will go to the convention free from all
taint of bossism.
If Rea secures control of the county
convention the defeat of the Republi
can party In Santa Clara County next
fall is certain. County politics Is so
gang-ridden that rather than vote for
a machine ticket the better class of
voters will stay away from the polls at
the gubernatorial election, and this lack
of interest in Santa Clara County may
cost the party the Governorship.
The Democratic County Central Com
mittee will aid the Good Government
Club in watching the polls to-morrow.
The names of all Democrats who vote
will be taken down and they will be de
barred from political preferment in
their own ranks.

{NERVOUS DEPRESSION.
[A TALK WITH MRS. PIN'KHAM.]
A woman with the blues is a very un-
comfortable person. She is illogical,
unhappy and frequently hysterical.
The condition of the mind known as
'â¢ the blues," nearly always, with wo-
men, results from diseased organs of
generation.
It is a source of wonder that in this
age of advanced medical science, any
person should still believe that mere
force of will and determination will
overcome depressed spirits and nerv-
ousness in women. These troubles are
indications of disease.
Every woman who doesn't under-
stand her condition should write to
Lynn, Mass., to Mrs. Pinkham for her
advice. Her advice is thorough com-
mon sense, and is the counsel of a
learned woman of great experience.
Read the story of Mrs. F. S. Bennett,"
"Westphalia, Kansas, as told in the fol-
lowing letter:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I have suf-
fered for over two years with falling,
enlargement and ulceration of the
womb, and this spring, being in such
a weakened condition, caused me to
flow for nearly, six months. Some time
ago, urged by friends, I wrote to you
for advice. After using the treatment
which you advised for a short time,
that terrible flow stopped.
"I am now gaining strength and
flesh, and have better health than I
have had for the past ten years. I
wish to say to all distressed, suffer-
ing women, do not suffer longer, when
there is one so kind and willing to
aid you."
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound is a woman's remedy for wo-
man's ills. More than a million wo-
men have been benefited b3* it*

Eva: Every afternoon about 5 o'clock I begin to gape and
yawn and I yawn and gape and yawn till bed-time. If
I nip one yawn in the bud the next follows almost im.
mediately and is bound to be a regular jaw-breaker.
May: I had such an experience myself one time, and I re
member asking the doctor whether one should try
to keep from yawning, and he said no, that the act of
gaping gives to the blood more oxygen and acts by
mechanical pressure on the heart and lungs. If one
has chronic gaping it is a symptom which should cause
the affected one to look after her general health, for
it is a sure sign that something is wrong.
Mrs. Moore : It is pretty well understood that yawning is an
ailment that comes from indigestion or lack of tone in
the system and may be cured by taking a Ripang
Tabule before retiring. After a few days of this treafr
Hient the tendency will disappear.

LYING AT DEATH'S DOOR.
Charles W. Manwaring, Prominent in Repub
lican Politics, Whose Life Is Despaired Of.
Charles W. Manwaring, who for many years has been prominent in
Republican politics, is lying- at the pulnt of death at his home, 3781
Seventeenth street, suffering from a complication of diseases.
Mr. Mamwaring was born In Missouri about thirty-five years ago and
graduated from the State University with high honors before he had
reached his majority. Shortly after leaving college he made a trip
Weat to visit his uncle, a prominent wine grower In Napa County, and
he then decided to make his home In California. He is a man of many
accomplishments, and he soon secured a position with J. Gundlach & Co.,
wine merchants, as bookkeeper and correspondent, which he still holds.
About eight years ago he went Into politics and was made a member
of the Republican County Committee. Two years later, when there was
a division among the committeemen, he suddenly loomed up as a dark
horse and was almost unanimously elected chairman. He fulfilled the
duties of his office in a straightforward, conscientious manner, making
friends everywhere, and has since been twice re-elected. He managed the
affairs of the committee with a master hand, readily subduing and har
monizing whatever warring elements might exist In a quiet, unostenta
tious manner until he has come to be considered almost indispensable.
He has never been a candidate for public office, although he once tried
for an appointment as Internal revenue agent, and for many years has
exerted a powerful influence in State- and local campaigns.
A short time ago he was taken sick with pneumonia and has never
altogether recovered. Last week he caught a severe cold which settled
on the lungs, arid this coupled with heart and kidney troubles makes his re
covery doubtful.

State society, received word from General
H. C. Merriam. commander of th>- I >â¢-_
nartment of the Pacific, yesteWay that
he favored the idÂ«a of establishing a
home for convalescents at the Presidio,
but suggested that no expense be In
curred until a consultation was had with
Major Owen or the chief surgeon. He
stated that the move of the War De
partment In allowing furloughs to the
convalescent soldiers would lessen the
labor of the Red Cross Society.

PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH.
The perfection of that great force known as strength is a work
of nature. Thousands of men have been gifted with a constitution fit
to build such a physical structure upon, but they have wasted the ma-
terial that makes the muscle vitality. A man who has exhausted his
vital strength by excesses and bad habits has weakened his physical
structure, and he will always be a weak, "half man" until he gets it
: back.. There is one great vitalizer.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â The belief was gen
eral to-day that Spain's reply to the United
States proposals was of such character that It
might endanger the whole negotiations for
peace by Its failure to return straightforward
answers to the questions at Issue. This belief
was effective In depressing securities a.ll over
the world. This effect was especially marked
Inasmuch as values have recently Improved
sharply on the prospect that peace would soon
be declared. Holders of stocks were therefore
Inclined to take profit In view of the less
favorable outlook. This was true of .Spanish
bonds, which fell both in Paris and London.
It hardly could be said, however, of United
State* bonds which nevertheless showed some
depression.
American railroad securities declined In Lon
dun and in Europe and there was selling In
New York for foreign account. Offerings here
on the decline were very large, but there was
evident also a remarkable power of absorp
tion which held prices with few exceptions
almost perfectly steady through some of the
active periods of the trading. Recent leaders
suffered quite severely and In this list are
included specially Burlington, St. Paul, Rock
leland. Brooklyn Rapid Transit. Sugar and the
rubber stocks. Yesterday's profit-taking fol
lowed by to-day's selling caused renewed fears
among traders that the large dealers were
Belling out. The bears were active but ner
vous all day and their covering induced the
numerous rallies. Prices at one time rallied
to near last night's close and In a few cases
above, but the bulk of the trading was at a
lower level.
Dealings in bonds were on a considerably
reduced scale and prices were more firmly held
than In the stock market. Total sales $3,550,-

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Aug. Wheat was for sale dur
ing the first hour In larger quantities than the
market would take without Inducement of fur
ther concessions In price. The required reduc
tion was submitted to. and %c was what It
amounted to for the sixty minutes. The news
that chiefly influenced the sellers at the start
was a decline of from 1% to l%d at Liverpool
and a slight drop In Paris quotations Other
wise the early Information was somewhat bull
ish. The greatest selling pressure came from
the Northwest, where speculators were doubt
less very bearishly. affected by the magnificent
prospects for the spring wheat crop. The de
mand for cash offerings In the sample market
was active. Offerings were Insignificant in com
parison with the demand, and notwithstanding
the decline In futures the prices paid for the
spot grain were fully as high as those realized
yesterday. That showing, together with the
strong competition among shippers for the lim
ited amount procurable for Immediate ship
ment, prevented futures from the demoraliza
tion they were occasionally threatened with by
the bearlshness of the crowd. The close was
Vc lower for September and Me for December.
Large receipts, ideal weather for the growing
crop, and the weakness In wheat had a bearish
Influence In corn. Scalpers and commission
houses generally sold. September lost Kc.
Oats were weak and lower In sympathy with
the other grains. September declined He.
The early break In provisions was occasioned
by general outside liquidation and selling on
stop-loss orders by commission houses. Prices
took a sudden spurt near the close on heavy
buying by packers. Pork and lard declined 2*c
each. and ribs rose 2 1 ,i@5c. . 'v\-;-Â»

Harrison's Circular says: "My last Colonial
report showed forty-three vessel? as chartered
for coal with a carrying capacity of 115.000
tons; now there are but thirty-eight vessels of
101,000 tons. Indicating a falling off of charters
for here, which has been principally caused by
the very liberal engagements from Australia
for Honolulu for the United States navy. Aa
thÂ« news from the seat of war is of a decidedly
less bellicose nature, and an early settlement
is almost assured, the demand for fuel for our
navy must necessarily diminish and colonial
shipments to Honolulu will be solely for com
mercial, not warlike uses. Our principal coal
consumers are unwilling purchasers at current
rates, and some of them are allowing tnel^
stocks to run pretty low, anticipating reduceil
prices later. Our coast collieries are profiting
by the high prices now established and are gen
erous shippers, in fact sailing vessels are de
tained in British Columbia awaiting their load
ing turn, as steamers take precedence. Some
of our importers are engaging coal freights six
months ahead from Newcastle, thereby show
ing their belief in the maintenance of rates
Their judgment may prove faulty If we should
i have seasonable rains In October and Novem
! ber next. The anticipated labor troubles at the
i colonial collieries, which tho last mail referred
to, appear to have been amicably arranged.

Cheeseman Gives Proof
of His Depravity.
WANTED TO MURDER THREE
HIS LOVE FOR ETTA TURNS TO
BITTER HATRED.
Hopes Blood Poisoning May Set m
and Yet Cause the Death of the
Young Girl â An Inhu
man Wretch.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 8.
Frank Cheeseman, the man who mur
dered Henry Brooka last night and at
tempted to kill his wife and stepdaughter,
gives evidence of being one of the most
depraved of opium fiends. He shows no
signs of mania, but he persists in stating
rrow that he did not kill them all
an<3 expresses his partial satisfaction that
he did at least murder the father.
"My only regret is," said the murderer
to-day, through the wicket of his cell,
"that I did not make a better job of it. I
Intended to kill them all and if Eita has
got off It is not my fault. I shot to kill
her. For some time we have been friends
and she finally took a dislike to me be
cause of some other fellow, and if I could
find him I would kill him, too. I made
up my mind to kill the whole crowd when
I went to the house. Brooke once had
me arrested for disturbing the peace, and
he took a shot at me, but he will not oo
any more shooting. I am not at all
troubled over this affair, except that I did
not kill the whole outiit.l don't care what
will become of me and they can hang n;e
If they want to."
The occasion on which Brooke took a
shot at Cheeseman occurred at Elmhur^t
a few months ago. Cheeseman called at
the house to go walking with Miss Payne,
but Brooke was at home and when he suw
Cheeseman prowling aruund he stepped
to the door and took a shot at him.
â  â¢man made himself scarce until the
next evening, when he again returned and
to force an entrance to the |
house. On this occasion Brooke went
down town and swore to a warrant charg
ing Cheeseman with disturbing the peace.
Brooke .did not appear against him and
the desperate lover was released. On one
occasion it Is stated that Etta and
Cheeseman went away for a whole week.
The murderer Is known to be a heavy
drinker and a cigarette riend. He is not
fond of- work, and has gained a character
of being a general loafer.
The .wound of Miss Etta Payne, while
troublesome,- is not serious, and Uriels
some unlooked for trouble arises she will
recover in a few weeks.
Coroner Baldwin will hold the inquest
on the murdered man to-morrow night
Cheeseman^s father called at the City
to-day .and said that he had no
money to hire attorneys to defend his son.
[id that the boy was ail right except
â when opposed. He also showed the Chief
of Police 1 the discharge of his son from
'.'kiah Asylum, dated June 30, 1891
When told to-day that Miss Payne
almost certainly recover the mur
derer said he was- sorry and that he hoped j
poisoning would set in and yet
cause her death. Mrs. Brooke is the sis- >

â¢ â¢ Civil War There.
The Bteam schooner Signal arrived in
port- yesterday in tow of the tug Sea
King. She left here on July 29 for Grays
Harbor and was supposed. to have been
Wrecked owing to the fact that some
boxes bearing her marks had been washed
ashore. â  When sixty-five miles south of
the Columbia River the Signal broke a
crankpin and as the wind was favorable
for a return to San Francisco the captain
pat her about. She arrived off the harbor
and anchored on the bar Monday night.
Captain Marshall of the Sea King ran
"across her. ln the fog yesterday morning
and- brought. her in. There were over fifty
mlllhands oh the Signal bound for Grays
Harbor and they were all delighted at get

from, the ferry steamer Newark on tea

/plunge. A -woman saw him and raised
.the'alarm. Captain Rogers saw him as

steamers ; .ginea. /. boat was lowered,
fe.ut no tracf of the suicide could be found.
â¢â Captain Rogers and the woman both say
the youth was apparently about 18 years
aid and was fairly well dressed. One of
â¢â¢the' deckhands saw the young man in the
water but thought it was a bundle of
.eTothes until the body rolled over and
â¢then he Haw the face. Life then seemed
to be extinct and the chances are that the
body was struck by the paddle wheel as
ft- passed under the steamer.
The United States steamer Albatross
sails to-day for San Jose de Guatemala.
â¢ The. civil war now raging in Guatemala

J. R. Swift, a recruit for Campany D,
First "Washington Volunteers, complained
â to the Harbor Police yesterday that he
had- been overcharged by the Union
Transfer Company. When Swift arrived
here he contracted with the transfer man
to have his trunk taken to the Presidio
for BO cents, but before the trunk was
handed over the transfer man demanded
and got $2. Captain Dunleavy will in
vestigate the matter.
. Very comfortable quarters have been
provided on the /steamer Mariposa for
afternoon. Henry Maloon, who was on
the stand when the case was last before
the court, was recalled, and testified to
the fact of vessels landing at the foot
of Market street at Surrhyne's wharf in
the sixties. The remainder of the after
noon was occupied with Witness H. D.
Hougham, who testified to practically the
same facts. He also testified that it was
generally rumored in the early days that
the Washington-street wharf was claim
ed by Carpentier, but that it was at the
same time contended that it belonged to
OaklarTd. The case goes on again to
morrow morning.

OAKLAND, Aug. 9.â The trial of Wil
liam P. Rogers of Nevada County,
charged with assault to murder, was
commenced in Judge Ellsworth's court
this morning. On March 9 last Rogers
came down on the overland from Grass
Valley in company with his brother-in
law, W. H. Weeks. The two had pre
viously quarreled over the division of
property left by Mrs. Weeks, and Rogers
was angered because he thought Weeks
intended to deprive him of his sister's
share, which she willed to him. and while
on the train Rogers is alleged to have
attacked Weeks with a knife. The de
fense's line of action was revealed on
the examination of jurors to-day when
the question was asked: "Have you any
prejudice against the insanity plea?" The
attorneys afterward stated that this
would be the line of defense.

ground that he had neglected his duties.

A PAVEMENT
City Council to Act on
East Twelfth Street.
HAYWARDS ROAD OBJECTS
STRONG RESOLUTIONS HAVE
BEEN PREPARED.
City Attorney to Take Legal Steps
to Compel the Company to
Make Desired Improve
ments.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 9.
A question of the greatest importance
regarding the condition of streets is to be
brought up at the meeting of the City
Council next Monday night. The Hay
wards electric road has expressed its in
tention not to be forced to pave the por
j tion of the road which it must keep in
i order in the same manner as the rest of
| the highway, and much bitterness has re
! suited. FoY twenty years East Twelfth
! street has been the only thoroughfare be
tween Oakland and East Oakland, and it
has been notorious that for over ten years
it has been the worst road in the city.
After a long effort a special appropria
tion of nearly a hundred thousand dollars
was made by the City Council to pave the
whole of this street with wooden blocks
laid on a deep concrete foundation. The
work has now been almost completed and
the thoroughfare is without doubt one of
the best in the State.
There is a portion of the street over
which the Haywards road has a franchi.-so"
and the company has declined to obey the
instructions of the Superintendent of
streets to place blocks between their
tracks and the edge of the pavement laid
by the city.
City Attorney Dow has prepared a reso
lution which will be acted upon at the
next meeting of the Council. It is as fol
lows:
Whereas, The Oakland, San Leandro and
Haywards Electric Railway, consolidated, has
refused to pave that portion of : East Twelfth
street lying between Its rails and within two
feet on each side thereof, and between its
tracks from the westerly line of First avenue
to the westerly line of Third avenue; and
Whereas, The remainder in width of said
East Twelfth street between the said lines has
recently been paved with wooden blocks at a
great expense to the city of Oakland and to
the property fronting thereon; and
Whereas, , The absence of block pavement or
pavement equally substantial on said portion
of said Street between the lines mentioned will
seriously Interfere with public travel and will
cause the total destruction of the said pave
ment already laid; and
Whereas, The said railway company Is re
quired by law and by Its franchise to keep In
order and repair and to pave with the same
or equally substantial pavement that portion
of East Twelfth street lying between its rails
and within two feet on each side thereof and
between Its tracks, from said westerly line of
First avenue to said westerly line of Third
avenue; it is therefore
â  Resolved, That this Council does hereby con
demn the said action . of said street railway
company In refusing to construct the aforesaid
pavement, and does hereby characterize said
action as a manifestation of said company's
hostility to the city's welfare, improvement
and progress, and as evidence of its desire to
escape its lawful and Just burdens; and be it
further
Resolved, That the City Attorney prepare
and present, to this Council such ordinances
and resolutions and institute such legal pro
ceedings as will compel said company to make
said repairs and .improvements.

The status of the medical department,

the Hopkins Institute of Art yesterday. It
was determined that the regents assume
full control of the department, such as
they exercise over every other branch of
work of the great educational institution.
Regent Reinstein introduced the mat
ter on the report of a special committee
appointed to determine the legal status
of the matter. It was shown that the
department, although in the past a sep
arate institution, was as much a part of
the university as any other. Mr. Rein
stein held that it was best for all con
cerned that such action be taken. The
medical faculty has asked that full con
trol be assumed on the ground that the
regents are better equipped to direct its
workings than is the faculty itself. It
was desired to build up that branch of

proprietor of the establishment was in re

the boats and as many of the oarsmen as
possible be sent to Astoria on the steamer
leaving this city on the' 13th. The rest of
the oarsmen will journey to Astoria on
the cars, arriving a day or two before
the regatta begins.
Possibly a barge crew from the Dolphin

It Is probable that Dr. C. C. Dennis, if
he can nave the use of Phelan's skiff, will
enter the skin* race, and that A. W. Pape
wil go if he can secure the loan of the
skiff belonging to the Triton Boat Club.

SCHOOL UNDER
A BIG TREE
Teachers in Opposition
at Claremont.
PARENTS OPPOSE POLITICS
ONLY SEVEN CHILDREN NOW IN
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL.
The Whipping of a Boy Has Resulted
in an Organized Fight Against
the Trustees â Two Sides
of the Question.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 9.
The trouble at the Claremont School
has become a pitched battle. Miss Minnie
Gerow, the schoolteacher who was
dropped by the Trustees, has erected a
tent under a spreading tree not far from
the schoolhouse, and Is teaching all the
little ones that are sent to her.
At present Miss Gerow teaches nineteen
out of the twenty-six schoolchildren in the
di.strict, while Miss Anna M. Landstrom
presides over a little class of seven in the
public school. There has been no investi
gation of the charges made by Mrs. Gan
naw regarding the whipping of her boy,
and as the Trustees have not shown any
desire to hold an inquiry the parents of
the pupils have taken it upon themselves
to settle the matter in tneir own way.
They induced Miss Gerow to open a school
of her own and promised to support her.
She has h-id an awning erected under a
tree, and teaching is going on as though
there were no public school less than a
block away.
"Our little school will be a permanent
one," said Miss Gerow to-da\. "We will
be out here until a new hous4 is built for
us. Prominent men of the district have
promised us aid. I did not put in my
application to be re-elected this year be
cause I did not want to be beaten, and I
was advised beforehand that two of the
three Trustees intended to give the place
to Miss Landstrom. I kncrw Johnny Gan
naw and I want to say that I have had
occasion to punish him myself, but I have
not found him a particularly vicious boy.
The feeling in the district is now not so
much opposed to Miss Landstrom as to
the fact that Miss Gerow was displaced
because of a little political pull exercised
in favor of a sister-in-law of one of the
Trustees. Among the children attending
school under the trees are the little ones
of Trustee Logan, who Is the only sup
porter in the board of Miss Gerow.

FOUGHT LIKE TROJANS.
Jack Granfield Got a Decision From
Billy Otts at the Alpine Club.
One of the most interesting eight-round
contests held under the auspices of the
Amateur Athletic Club was witnessed last
Monday by a large gathering of fistic
sport lovers at 28 Golden Gate avenue.
To the Alpine Club the credit must be
given for a show which pleased the most
fastidious of fistic sport lovers.
The principals were the aggressive
fighter Jack Granfield. and the clever and
game 130-pound boxer Billy Otts. The
rising stars in pugilism have met before,
and Otts gained a decision, but Granfield
was determined to turn the tables on his
clever opponent, and for several months
he has trained hard with the object in
view of meeting Otts and of besting him.
The Alpine Club seeing that a great
contest was in prospect matched the men,
and those who witnessed the bout last
evening went away satisfied that they got
a good run for their money.
Otts had the better of his opponentâ
that Is, so far as height and reach of
arms are concernedâ but Granfield, a nat
ural-born puncher, made up for the de
ficiency In aggressiveness and ability to
stand punishment.
The first, second and third rounds of the
mill were of the give-and-take order,
neither man scoring a lead, but the fourth
ended in Granfleld's favor. The San
Francisco Club man fought furiously. He
closed up oh his opponent and neither
man gave way a foot of territory. It
was punch, punch, with right and left,
until the gong sounded the men to their
respective corners. Granfield played
heavily on Otts' body and winded the
game and clever representative of the Ex
celsior Club.
Otta fell away after this round and
Granfield scorfed a strong lead, upper
cutting his opponent at every opportunity
and almost putting Otts out in the eighth
round. It was one of the most exciting
fistic contests of the season, and Referee
J. McDevitt is deserving of credit for
awarding the fight to Granfleld, notwith
standing the hoots he received from the
would-be sports who cannot see but one
man in a fight where favoritism is pend
ing. Otts, however, is deserving of great
praise for the game stand he took under
heavy fire.
Tom Murphy got a deslclon over Billy
Hogan in a six-round bout, and Charles
Johnson, who punched A. Dahl's face
"out of place," received judgment from
Gus Herget, after the men boxed four
rounds.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
hold its regular monthly exhibition on
Wednesday evening at its club rooms, 317
Sixth street. The principal events will be
two amateur six-round bouts for valuable
trophies. "Bud" Terry and F. Maynard.
both aggressive boxers, are matched; also
Jack King and J. Schuler, one of the best
amateur lightweights on the cpast.
Jimmy Lawlor and Young Â«iriffo were
matched last evening to box ten rounds
before the New Western Athletic Club.
As this will be a professional contest the
club must pay a license of $100, otherwise
the authorities will not allow the con
test to be held.
Powers of Attorney to Be Stamped.
Powers of attorney executed abroad and
used in the United States must bear a 35
cent documentary stamp. Internal Rev
enue Collector Lynch was so advised yes
terday by telegraph from the Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue at Washing
ton.
Swiss Relief Society.
An excursion and picnic to Fairfax Park
on next Sunday will be given by the Swiss
Relief Society. There will be many at
tractions, including games, bowling for $35
;n cash prizes, shooting for valuable
prizes, dancing and an open-air concert.
buque Conference, for receiving into fel
lowship the unfrocked member of the
Bay Conference, which has previously
been published, was read before the con
ference by Registrar Hatch. There were
no comments made on the letter. Mod
erator Chamberlain requested the regis
trar to write to the Dubuque Conference,
accepting the explanation and a dignified
reply will be sent.
Registrar Hatch then suggested that
the committee of seven which was ap
pointed to handle the Brown trouble be
discharged. Nash rose and suggested
that the committee be thanked for the
satisfactory manner in which it had
handled the affair. Moderator Chamber
lain then discharged the committee, and
the Brown case was officially closed.
The committee, consisting of Messrs.
Foster, Hatch, Rader, Hallett and Adams,
who were appointed to revise the consti
tution and by-laws, filed a printed con
stitution and by-laws. The only change
which would in any way affect ministe
rial standing is the by-law which re
quires that no delegate not in ministerial
standing shall pass upon a ministerial
delegate's standing.
The new by-laws make the following
provision for dealing with complaints:
When complaints are made against churches
or ministers of the association this committee
shall seek to learn and remove the causes of
complaint. Failing in this, the committee shall
report the facts to the association, which may
then proceed with the case according to the
natural right of every organized body to grant,
to maintain or to withdraw the rights and
privileges of membership in such organization.
Under the new constitution nineteen mem
bers, nine ministers and ten lay delegates,
present <md voting, shall constitute a quorum.
Churches which fail to send delegates and to
report statistics for two consecutive years shall
forfeit tholr membership and may be dropped
by vote from the roll- of the association. Min
isterial membership shall lapse after two years
of unreported absence from the bounds of the
associntlon. Each church in this association
shall be entitled to three delegates in every
meeting, paid delegates to be prorerly elected

Board of Equalization.
ALAMEDA, Aug. o.â Several applica
tions have been made to the City Trus
tees, sitting as a board of equalization,
for reductions in the valuation of real
property. None of them amounts to more
than a few hundred dollars difference be
tween the assessed and the owner's val

granted, but the total will make little

THEY WORKED
Hall of Justice Employes
Treated Well.
RAW WORK OF SUPERVISORS
FLIMSY EXCUSES FOR THE NU
MEROUS DELAYS.
Boiling Mills and Other Plants
Which Evidently Existed Only
in the Imagination of
Contractors
â¢ The more delving is done into affairs re
lating to the new Hall of Justice, the
more manliest dots it become that there
is "a colored gentleman lurking in the
-woodpile," and that all the delays have
made for some ob;
The contract was let on November Z\,
1596, and signed on December 3, 1896, and
called for the building to be finished on
October 1. 1897. Extensions of time wore
made as follows: September 22, to Oc
tober 22, 1897; October 23, 1897, to January
â li 1898; January 1 to February Â»&s, and
February 28 to October 1. The building
will not be finished on October 1, or at all
events the contractors think it will be
impossible, and intend asking for another
delay. In the meanwhile the Board of
Supervisors is paying out $420 each month
for salaries of superintendents and
Morgue rental.
In their appeals for more time the con
tractors made many excuses, which were
cheerfully swallowed by an indulgent
Board of Supervisors, but one of the star
was the plea that work was not
actually begun until July 1, 18S7. On
February 15. 1897, John E. Buckley was
appointed Superintendent of Construc
tion at a salary of $250 per month, said
salary to begin at the same time as the
actual work of construction. The report
of the Committee on Public Buildings,
adopted February' 28f 1898, reads as fol
lows: "In the matter of the petition of
Bateman Bros, for further time we find
that the. contractors were not in control
of or had the lot on which the Hall of
Justice is being constructed prior to July
1. 1897." Chiefly on these grounds an ex
tension of time was granted by the Board
of Supervisors. The list of expenditures
on the Hall shows, however, that Mr.
Buckley's salary began on March 26. and
he has. accordingly, drawn three months'
salary which he was not entitled to. Tim
salary of the inspector of brickwork dates
from June 1, or a month before the "ac
tual work of construction" commenced.
Either Bateman Bros, fooled the commit
tee or the board has been fooled Into
paying 1 men salaries for doing nothing
Other portions of the statistics relating
to the work prove just as Interesting, j
Time and again the architects called at
tention to the fact that the sub-contracts
had not been let. After resolutions had i
been passed and notices sent out, which
were totally ignored, a committee waa
sent to interview the contractors. These
gentlemen unhlushingly informed the
gullible eommitteempn that they did not
Intend letting sub-contracts, as their own ;
rolling mills would soon be in operation, I
and they Intended taking the stone from |
th^lr own quarries; also, that they had [
iust erected a plant near Stockton fur !
the manufacture of terra cotta. This
was told in a nice oily way, and It was :
easily swallowed by the committee. These ;
mills and quarries, however, appear to
have been abandoned as readily as a
Spanish warship, as since that time iron
and ste^l have been supplied by the Car- I
negle works of Pennsylvania and the Pa
cific Rolling Mills. Stone has been pro
cured from an old quarry, and the terra
cotta is due from a local firm within a
few days. Where the contractors get the
brass with .vhich to equip themselves
when telling such yarns does not appear
on the records.
The whole scheme was once investi
gated by a committee from the Orand
Jury, which, after making a thorough
Investigation, became convinced that the
whole scheme of delays was a fraud and
that the contractors were really holding
back waiting for the price of building
material to take a drop. Instead of tak
ing a drop it has gone steadjly upward,
and they are getting deeper in the mire
every day. This committee filed a re
port' with "the Board of Supervisors pro
testing against further delays, and was
backed up by a comi.iittee representing
every property owner in the vicinity, but
the fairy tales about factories, univoid
able delays, etc.. seemed mort plausible
and the desired extension was granted.
While the property owoers fume and
sweat and the little bunch of workmen
keep out of the way of the host of su
perintendents, the contractors compla
cently talk of asking for further time.
EXTRADITION REFUSED.
Governor 3udd Objects to Sign the
Warrant in the Case of C. H.
de Voll.
Governor Budd, after listening to the
evidence and the arguments of counsel
in his rooms in the Palace Hotel yester
day morning, refused to issue a warrant
for the extradition of C. H. De Voll. who
is wanted in Kansas City, Mo., for ob
taining money by false pretenses.
De Voll was arrested on August 4 by
Corporal Geimann and the next day was
released on a writ of habeas corpus. He
â was accused by J. H. New by of Kansas
City of obtaining $500 by false pretenses
It appeared that De Voll is a partner of
the Moe and De Voll Company. St. Louis,
of which Newby is president. The com
pany manufactures incandescent lamps.
De Voll had the controlling interest in
the company, but before leaving for the
coast he transferred ir to his wife. De
tective Ennis of Kansas City came here
with the extradition r.apers.
The Governor remarked that he saw no
merit in the case and nothing on which
to bape a criminal charge. The books of
the company were always open for in
spection, and if there wa? a case at all
It was on.; for the civil courts.
The War in Pyrotechnics.
The staging, battleships, torpedo boats,
arsenals, forts, volcanoes, etc., for the re
production of the Maine explosion, battle
of Manila, capture of Santiago, etc., which
Is shortly to be reproduced at Central
Park, are nearly finished, and the public
will soon be treated to the greatest pyro
technical display evÂ«-r presented upon this
coast. The opening scenes will be laid
In Havana harbor, and the closing ones
In the harbor of Manila. All the leading
naval events, from the historical moment
the Maine was blown up to the fall of
Santiago. Including Dewey's great
achievement in the battle of Manila, will
be fuliy portrayed even to the minutest
details. It is the intention of the man
agement to produce an accurate and ex
plicit idea of cannonading, bombardment,
explosion of mines, bursting of torpedoes,
sinking of vessels, burning of forts after
explosions, gunners in action, flagship
etc. There will be some 800
people in the cast, and this gigantic spec
tacle will make a most elaborate display.
The opening date is announced for Au
gust 20.
Central Registration Closes.
Registrar Biggy's assistants â  were kept
busy last evening attending to the vot
ers who were anxious to be enrolled at
headquarters rather than at the precincts
which begin operations to-day. About
1800 citizens registered yesterday.
Hay Barn Burned.
A hay barn occupied by Antone Braffeco
on Lombard street, between Octavia and
Laguna. was burned last night. One horse
was consumed, besides ten tons of hay,
the loss being estimated at $500, covered
by insurance.

WORK FOR WOMEN.
Mrs. Addie L. Ballou and Her
Companions Start a Sewing
Factory to Aid Those
in Want.
An American flap will be the first piece of work to be completed by
the sewing women who have been provided with employment by the Wo
men's Sewing Company. The order comes from Hale Brotners, and will.
upon completion, be displayed In their windows as an evidence of the
newly organized effort to give employment to a thousand needy sewing
women in this city.
Twenty-eight sewing machines, placed at 303 Eighth street by the
Singer Company for the purpose, were set in operation yesterday after
noon by the touch of an electric button by Secretary Sullivan, represent
ing Mayor Phelan. who was unable to be present. Thus twenty-eight
of the needy ones were started on the way to earn a livelihood. But
there were "more than five times that many who turned away, saddened
by the disappointment of betog obliged to wait their turn.
Mrs. Ballou, the secretary of the company, stood in the gallery of the
plainly finished sewing-room and tried to make plain the fact to the dis
appointed ones that it was Impossible to start more machines until or
ders for work had been secured and the machines put in place.
"Tlure may be many women disappointed." said Mrs. Ballou. "but
this company. "which is the outgrowth of the complaint that women were
being refused work on Government orders, will do the best it can to sup
ply them with work, and that without the hope of making any profit
for the managers of the scheme."
Hale Brothers have given a large order for men's cotton underwear,
and word comes from Assistant Quartermaster Long that, now the
Women's Sewing Company Is incorporated, there will be an opportunity
for these women to do Government work. Government contracts could
not be made with individual sewing women, but now the sewing women
are formed Into an incorporated company, and that without the cost of
a penny to them. Stock will be sold to the good people who desire to
help the plan along. And the active managers of it hope to put it in
good running order with work for a hundred machines and as many more
women very soon.
CALIFORNIA HAS
THE GOLDEN PRIZE i
THE MEDAL FROM HAMBURG
WILL BE HERE SOON.
It Was Won in a Grand Competition
of This State's Fruits Against
Those of the World.
Manager Filcher of the State Board of
Trade, who was in charge of Califor
nia's exhibit at the International Horti
cultural Exposition held at Hamburg,
Germany, a year ago, has received from
one of the direcors of that exposition
the assurance that the gold medal for the
best general display of horticultural
products, won by this State against all
competitors, will be ready to be forward
ed to California in the course of three
or four weeks. He has received a cut of
the medal, which is different from the
usual style, being square in form. The
California's Fruits Won
This Prize.
size of the cut, which presumably cor
responds with the size of the medal, is
two by two and a quarter inches, and
the design is very beautiful.
Mr. Filcher states that the Hamburg
Commisfior.frs have made up their re
port and they find that after paying all
expenses they will have a little money
left This was very gratifying, corsi.l
ering the smallnes.s of the appropriation
by the Stateâ s6ooo.
The interest in fruit products created
in <;.-nnanv last year by reason of the
display made at Hamburg still contin
ues arid is spreading into other European
countries. A great many orders are com
ing in from France, where the State's
fruits are well liked, and from the trade
centers of the Scandinavian Peninsula.
Out of seventeen carloads of dried apri
cots sold by one- firm this year in South
ern California it is worthy of note that
fourteen carloads went to Hamburg,
The short fruit crop this year, however,
is likely to have a bad effect, as it pre
vents California exporters from meeting
the Increased demand abroad for Cali
fornia cured fruits, and may result in
the loss to them of some of their new
customers.

THE SAN FBAISTCTSCO CAI/L, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1898.
WANTS TO BUILD
MORE WARSHIPS
HENRY T. SCOTT LEAVES FOR
WASHINGTON TO-DAY.
He Will Bid on All Classes of Naval
Fighters Called For by the
Government.
Henry T. Scott, president of the Union
Iron Works, will leave to-day for Wash
ington on an important mission, namely,
to endeavor to secure contracts for the
construction of more world-beating wa:
ships, such as the Oregon and Olympla,
v.im-h hay made Pan Francisco's great
shipyard famous.
Mr. Scott will be prepared to bid on
all classes of vessels included in the pres
ent call for estimates. He said:
"Bids are invited for two harbor de
fense vessels, two oattleships, five tor
ptdo-boat destroyers and four torpedo
boats. San Francisco has one advan
tage in the competition by reason of the
fact that the Government allows a d: '-
ference of 4 per cent in favor of Pacific
Coast shipbuilders. In other words, if a
bidder from San Francisco or elsewhere
on the coast puts In a figure 4 per cent
above the lowest bidder on the Atlantic
side ot the continent, other matters be
ing satisfactory, he will be awarded the
contract. However, this concession is
restricted to one bauleship and one har
bor defense vessel. In bidding on the
others we are on even terms with East
ern competitors.
â¢'Bids on the torpedo-boat destroyers
are to be opened on August 23, and on the
battleships on September 1, and I hope
to bring back something in the way of
contracts."
A FAILURE AS A FAKER.
Physicians Disgusted by an Exaibi
tion Given by a Son of Mephisto.
A faker who comprehends not in the
slightest the art of faking was introduced
at the residence of Dr. R. Beverly Cole
by a yellow journal representative last
night, and exhibited to a select convo
cation of physicians.
The gentlemen who attended the seance
In the hope of seeing something new, but
who appeared at the conclusion to the
thoroughly disgusted and pronounced the
â¢ â¢ffort a complete failure, were Drs. Cole,
K>rr, Mofnt, Hapsburger, Tuggle and
D'Ancona.
The young man of pretensions, who to
a Call reporter stated that his father's
name was Mephisto, but was introduced
to the party by his yellow manager as
Mr. Kosti, essayed to raise and lower his
pulse and his temperature at will. He
failed flatly, save in the slightest chang
ing of those conditions such as any hys
terical person may do with the faintest
sort of an effort.
Then he made a pretense at mind read
ing, failing so utterly that the effort was
painful to the spectators. Dr. D'Ancona
offered to give him a second trial, stat
ing that he had in his pocket two bank
checks for liberal amounts that he had
prepared for the occasion, and which he
would present to the pretender if he
would read them b3 r any mind-reading
process. He would not undertake it.
The physicians expressed plainly by
thoir actions, and indirectly in words,
that Mr. Kosti-Mephlsto was even a fail
ure as a faker.
His Death Accidental.
OAKLAND, Aug. 9.â An inquest was
held this evening over the remains found
In the estuary yesterday morning. The
body was identified as that of Thomas
Brandon, who had been working on Hack
ett's dredger and who fell into the estu
ary last week while walking on the mud
pipes toward the shore. Deceased was
aged about 45 years. The verdict was
drowning.
MANY MOURNED
BY HER BIER
Mother Russell's Body
Given to the Earth.
SIMPLE FUNERAL SERVICE
A TOUCHING TRIBUTE BY REV.
FATHER GALLAGHER.
Archbishop Riordan and the Catholic
Clergy Perform the Last Rites
Over the fcacred Re
mains.
The earthly remains of Mother Mary
Catherine Russell, whose very name is
spoken with love and the highest re
spect by thousands, were consigned to
the earth yesterday and friends in
numerable gathered to pay their last
tribute to the memory of one endeared
to their hearts. She was buried in the
Sisters of Mercy plat in the inclosure at
the Magdalen Asylum. The last cere
monies were set for 10 o'clock in the lit
tle chapel in St. Mary's Hospital. The
body rested in a plain black coffin sur
rounded by six candelabra. At the
stated hour Archbishop Riordan took
his place at the foot of the altar and
commenced the mass while a choir of
Sisters of Mercy gave voice to Mozart s
"Requiem."
Archbishop Riordan was attended by
the Rev. John F. Nugent as deacon.
Rev P S. Casey as sub-deacon. Fath
er Prelato, S. J., and Father Phelan of
San Rafael as deacons of honor. The
Archbishop's private secretary, Rev. P.
A. Mulligan, officiated as master of
ceremonies.
Father Hugh Gallagher, S. J., deliv
ered the funeral sermon. In eloquent
words he told of the self-sacrificing
life led by the woman who left home,
family, friends and the riches of the
world to minister to the sufferings of
humanity and pour the soothing oil of
religion into the hearts of those crushed
and weary in spirit and soul. In the
course of his remarks he said:
"The good that Mother Russell has
done only God knows. She not only
preserved the faith, but dragged many
girls from the degraded state who af
terward developed into noble, Christian
women. She fed countless numbers of
hungry and she clothed the poor. She
did all this and more, and her reward
from Christ will be the recompense of
eternal life. We believe her life was
blameless, but the judgment of God is
not that of men. so do not let us forget
her in our prayers."
Upon the conclusion r.f the mas 3 the
casket was placed in the hearse, which
was followed to the cemetery by many
carriages. The pall bearers were Dr.
X T 'Leonard. Dr. M. J. F-ttrell. Judge
John Burnett, Dr. T. C. Bailey Dr T.
H Morris, T. Connolly, M. A. O Brien,
James B Gartland and John A. Len
non. The services at the grave were
simple, consisting of prayers by the
Rev. Hugh Gallagher.
The priests in the sanctuary during
the service of mass were: Rev. M. D.
Slattery of Napa, Rev. D. O. Crowley
of the Youths' Directory, Rev. Michael
King of Oakland, Rev. J. J. Cramwell

JTHE ENGINEER'S TRIAL VERY
SATISFACTORY.
The Hawaiian Commissioners as
Guests of Senator Perkins
Witness the Exhi
bition.
One of Uncle Sam's latest prospectve
fighting ships was skipping around the
bay yesterday in a light and fantastic
manner and casually showing other bay
craft that they did not know the first
.rudiments of how to put water behind
them in a hurry and not make a fuss
about it.
The vessel was the torpedo boat de
stroyer Farragut. Just completed by the
Union Iron Works, and the occasion was
the trial of her machinery by the Govern
ment Board of Engineers. Without paint
or furbishing she is a beautiful piece of
naval architecture, "long, narrow, rak
ish." built on the lines of a knife-blade,
and well calculated to dart through the
â¢water like a game fish. Her movement
down the harbor en route to the speed
course attracted the attention of people
and whistles on the water front and bay,
and she was given an ovation as she
gracefully glided along toward the scene
of her trial.
Senator George C. Perkins, In honor of
the event, organized an excursion for the
benefit of the Hawaiian Commissioners
and a number of -prominent people of San
Francisco and Oakland, the Government
tug L'nadilla being secured for the ccca
sion. There were present on her:
Senator Cullom and Congressman Hitt
of The Hawaiian Commission; Senator
Perkins W. H. Mills. Captain Rogers of
the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Hugh
Craig, president of the Chamber of Com
merce; H. E. Huntingdon of the Southern
Pacific Company; Collector of Port John
P. Jackson. Professor George Davidson,
Judge Morrow, Captain C. G. Kelson. Pro

' Coast and Geodetic Survey Department,
Washington, D. C. ; J. 08. Gunn. secre
â  tary of the Union Iron Works; Tirey L.
Ford. president of the Union League Club:
President Foster of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway; Captain Charles
Goodall. Secretary Scott of the Chamber
of Commerce, Mowbray R. Dundas, May
or Thomas of Oakland; President Herrin
and Secretary Craigie Sharp, of the Board
of Trade. Oakland; Andrea Sbarboro of
the Merchants' and Manufacturers' As
sociation: S. G. Murphy, president First
National Bank, and Judge Craw for .1 of
Santa Rosa. Congressman Barham was
at the deck, but had to return to his hotel
on iccourt of sudden illness.
The L'nadilla left Clay-street wharf at
9:45 o'clock and steamed up toward Hun
ters Point to meet the war racer and Join
in the procession to the scene of action.
Notwithstanding that the Government
tug is a fast one she seemed to be very
weary while endeavoring to keep in sight
of the Farragut. which was apparently
loafing along and economizing coal.
While the Unadilla was making the
stern chase Senator Perkins took advan

tage of Messrs. Cullom arid Hitt in their
helpless position and talked politics in the
direction of an appropriation for the pro
posed naval srhool on Goat Island. He
told the guests that these astute and dip
lomatic gentlemen had encouraged him to
secure the passage of a bill authorizing
an appropriation, and that wnen he at
tempted to get them to consent to pro
vide the money they gave him the ada
mantine heart. The distinguished guests,
while laughing heartily at the joke, took
the matter seriously and told the Senator
that when they pot back to business ho
could have "anything for California in
the bounds of reason.
The speeding ground was along the Ma
rin shore off California City, the course
being one mile long. The Unadilla took
a position about midway of the beacon
towers, and those on board had a fine
view of the performance.
When the little marine wonder was
ready to take a dash at the distance, she
went at it in a deliberate manner and
was handled by Captain Minor Goodall
like a jockey warming up his horse for
a contest. The Farragut came down from
El Campo way at a fifteen knot gait ap
parently making no effort to travel fast.
Then she came bark under the imaginary
line at eighteen knots, and the spectators
on the Unadilla thought she was doing
twenty. Still there was no evidence that
she was trying to do fast work. On the
next turn twenty knots were knocked. off,
with steam blowing all the time. The
next dash jumped the figure to twenty
two knots, with steam going to waste,
then the little marine marvel swung
around for some earnest work and came
down the course a thing of beauty and
wonder, passing the Government tug like
a fa.-t express train, making twenty-six
knots, or nearly twenty-nine miles an
It was an exhibition of speed that has
never been remotely approached In this
harbor, and brought forth the huzzas of
the spectators. .
A peculiarity of the movement of the
destroyer is the fact that unlike other
fa.-t vessels she does not take a hone
In her teeth. Her bow cuts the water
like a kniff, while the bow wave is a
flat body of foam reaching back to amid-
Bhlps She drags little water and scarce
ly leaves a line of fonm to mark her
wake. The Farragut is so constructed
that at high speed her prow rises and
her stern b depressed, giving her the
appearance of a greyhound stretching out
in a final rea^h for his prey.
One of the marvels of this marine time
cutter Ik the fact that her hull is con
structed of sheet steel only one-eighth
of an inch in thickness, while at the
same time she supports a mass of ma
chinery sufficient to develop 7500 horse
power.
In speaking of the results of the engi
neer's test yesterday, Henry T. Scott
saJd :
"This was no official speed trial, but
a trial of the engines to see if there were
any defects. The vessel performed In
a most f-atlpfactory manner, but it is
probable that it will be a week before
the Government trial for speed will be
made. It is probable that there will be
some minor matters to adjust before the
ship will be in a proper condition to do
her best. We have no doubt as to the re
sults."
During the excursion on the Unadilla
Senator Perkins proved himself a great
hostâ not only by telling: good stories ap
propriate to Senatorial dignity, but by
furnishing a lunch and trimmings lit for
epicures. At the same time he combined
business with pleasure by convincing Con
gressman Hitt of the Appropriations
Committee that Blossom Rock should be
blown up, as it was a menace to the com
merce of the port.
i m arrival at the wharf after the ex
cursion three cheers were given for Sen
ator Perkins, who in turn proposed
"three mere" for the Hawaiian Commis
sioners. These were given with a good
will. Senator Cullom. responding, said:
"Gentlemen: On behalf of the Hawa-

lian Commissioners I desire to express
heartfelt thanks for the many courtesies
extended us, and particularly for the
pleasures of this memorable excursion.
The next time I move It will be to Cali
fornia."
"That would not be a wise move, Sena
tor," said Mr. Perkins. "California does
not' send her ablest men to the Senate.
If it did, my friend here, Mr. Mills, or
General Barnes, would have been there
long ago."
"Well, one of us is going this time,"
sbouted the general, "and it will not be
Mills."
"Well, you have my best wishes," re
marked Mr. Mills.
"Yes, and that is about all I will get,"
was the dry remark of General Barnes.
A hearty laugh closed thÂ« pleasures of
the day.
CHINESE REFUSED A LANDING
_____
Twelve Mongolians Excluded Under i
the New Rule of the Treasury
Department.
Collector Jackson yesterday decided to
refuse a landing to twelve Chinese who
had certificates from Hongkong certify
ing that they were salesmen, collectors,
accountants, etc.â classes of Chinese that
had been freely admitted until the re
cent decision of the Treasury Depart
ment, tha decision being that only the
persons mentioned in the treaty should
be allowed to enter the United States.
Those persons were merchants present-
Ing certificates, giving the nature, char
acter and estimated value of their bus
iness, students and tourists for pleas-
ure.
Many of the applicants were described
as "shroffs" which means collectors.
Others were described as salesmen
and accountants. Ah Pak had no
certificate. He came as a tourist
to visit his father who, he said,
was a merchant at Monteroy. Wing Fat.
alias "Flying Soap," a laundryman from
New Orleans, wanted to pass in as a
merchant, but he had no certificate and
must atay out. Chew Plang and Hon
Jow claimed to be native born Ameri
cans, and as such eligible to the Presi
dency of the United States, but the Col
lector did not believe them and they
have taken out writs of habeas corpus,
alleging that their rights as American
citizens have been violated.
Seven Chinese came in as merchants
with certificates in proper form and were
admitted.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1893._
A SETBACK TO
MARRIAGES BY
SEA CAPTAINS
The Law Against Salt-
Water Ceremonies.
SUPREME COURT SAYS SO
A "SKIPPER" CANNOT LEGALIZE
SUCH A CONTRACT.
This Decision Will Cause Trouble
and Carry Consternation Into
Not a Few Homes in
This State,
The Supreme Court has struck a se
vere blow to "tugboat" marriages, and
placed many a happy couple in a posi
tion that may be embarrassing, to put
the situation in its mildest form. In brief,
the Justices of the highest California tri
bunal declare this kind of marriage to be
illegal and demoralizing in its effects
upon the public. The case under consid
eration comes from Los Angeles County,
and by the action a young husband, as
he evidently supposed himself to be,
sought to have declared illegal an al
leged marriage on the high seas.
On August 2, 1897, Homer Xorman, who
was Zl years of age, and Janette Thom
son, aged 15 years, and daughter of A.
C. Thomson of Los Angeles, boarded a
fishing and pleasure schooner, the J. Wll
ley, and proceeded nine miles out to sea,
where the master, Captain W. L. Pier
son, performed the ceremony of mar
riage, and the young people agreed to
be husband and wife.
The young people were residents of the
city of Los Angeles, and upon their re
turn from the "tugboat" marriage they
lived together as husband and wife for
eight days. The young woman then left
Norman and refused to live with him,
and, further, by the advice of her father,
she declared that no marriage existed
between her and the man. Then it was
that the latter sought relief from the
courts In an action to have declared legal
and valid the marriage performed by the
captain of the schooner at sea. In his
declaration he asserted that the marriage
was still in full force and effect, never
having been annulled and having been
consummated by reason of their having
lived together eight days as husband
and wife.
The woman, by her father, set up the
allegation that the marriage was a farce,
and that the alleged ceremony was for
the purpose of evading the laws of the
State In which both parties lived, and
consequently void. She further asked
that Norman be stopped from asserting
and assuming to be ncr husband. The
lower court found In her favor and de
cided that the alleged husband â¢ was not
entitled to any relief as prayed for.
Commissioner N. P. Chipman, who wrote
the decision which was concurred in by
the Justices, sustains the Judgment of
the lower court, and after reviewing the
facts of the case, puts his stamp of con
demnation on "tugboat marriages" In the
following very severe language:
"In this case there was no license,
there was no solemnization by any per
son authorized by law to perform tha
ceremony, there was no marriage under
section 78%. To recognize such a mar
riage, we think, would grossly violate the
spirit and letter of our statute, and be a
blot upon the civilization we profess. Our
conclusion rests upon the want of any
authorized solemnization and would . be
the same if the parties were both of
age." .:-â .>*.;
The far-reaching effect of this decision
can readily be seen. In the past few
years several hundred of this class of
marriages have taken place on boats
from this bay and Monterey. While the
parties in these ceremonies may have
been actuated by proper motives, ro
mantic or otherwise, their position In so
ciety is a matter of serious question, con
sidering that not a few ox the couples
have established families, A whose good
names in the present and future is a
matter of no small concern.
THE YOSEMITE VALLEY.
A Number of Improvements Advised
by the Park Commission.
At ameetlngof the Yosemlte Commission
Monday there were present Governor
Budd and Commissioners Kinney, Foote,
Clinch, Greenberg and Metson. Vice Pres
ident Kinney made a report of the man
agement, which showed that the finances
have been handled with care and there
are no deficiencies. The work of the guard
ian of the valley and the secretary was
commended. Mr. Kinney said that the
matter of having a well-stocked store in
the valley where the public could be ac
commodated should be considered. Tents
for hire should be kept by the storekeeper.
He further recommended that the toll
roads of the valley should be abolished
and a bureau of information established.
Attention was called to the Importance ol
keeping Bheep and cattle men out of tne
reservation. In concluding his remarks
Mr. Klnney said that the Vosemite \ alley
should be thoroughly advertised so as to
bring returns for the outlay and conces
sions. The guardian of the valley recom
mended that a new bridge be thrown
across the river on the Royal Arch road,
which proposition was received with la
vor. It was decided to build a new trail
to Stanford Point and place a railing
around the dangerous parts of the road
leading to Inspiration Point.

LOST ON A BLEAK
INHOSPITABLE SHORE
FATE OF A PARTY OF ALASKA
EXPLORERS.
Drowned During a Storm at the
Mouth of a Large But Little
Known River.
The letter received by the Alaska Com
mercial Company from Unalaska, under
date of July 2S, telling of the probable
death of Moravian Missionary E. Weber,
wife and child, together with twelve gold j
hunters, members of the Columbia Ex
ploring Company, as given In The Call >
yesterday, is supplemented to-day by in
teresting information regarding the re
gion where the catastrophe is reported
to have occurred.
The Kuskokwim. near 'the mouth of ;
which the party is supposed to have per
ished, is the largest unknown river of
Alaska. It is believed to head near the
Tanana River and to be nearly one thou
sand miles in length. Only a few white
men have over been upon it to this day
and they have not carried their explora
tions more than 600 miles up tho stream,
at which point It is still a broad, naviga
ble river. The fact that the Kuskokwim I
empties into Bering Sea on an isolated |
coast accounts in part for the fact Hint
It escaped attention from tho United
States coast and geodetic survey and min
ing prospectors, at the time when re
searches were being- pushed along the
Yukon and its tributary streams. As a
result there is no reliable chart of the i
Kuskokwim. although it Is believed that I
one or more of General Merriam's ex
ploring parties will cross Alaska near the
head of the Kuskokwim during the pres
ent season and will obtain valuable data
concerning its source. The Mahlamutes,
who live along the lower Kuskokwim in'
numerous large villages, are, as a rule, i
inoffensive, half-starved people, who are I
too lazy to even catch the quantity of !
salmon necessary for their subsistence
and are In winter often reduced to the
direst extremities. It is seldom, how
ever, that they are caught stealing from
the few white men who frequent the
coast.
Since- the Klondike excitement arose
several parties of mining prospectors j
have been outfitted to explore the Kus
kokwim, but so far as known up to the
present time the only one that reached
the scene of operations was the ill-fated I
Columbia Exploring Company.
For nine or ten years past the Mora- !
vians have maintained a mission station
at the mouth of the Kuskokwim and an
other at Momentrehlahogamute, a small |
native village about twu hundred miles
up the Btream. This was, up to a fe",- j
months ago, in charge of a full blooded j
Cherokee IndJan from the United States,
who went there as a Moravian mis
sionary.

There was a large and distinguished
gathering of San Francisco's business and
professional men yesterday afternoon in
I the Chamber of Commerce to formally
welcome to the city the visiting members
of the Hawaiian Commjssion, Senators
j Morgan and Cullom and Congressman
i Hitt.
The openning ceremonies were delayed
beyond the appointed hour. 2:30 p. m.,
owing to the non-arrival of Senator Mor
gan, who was feeling somewhat fatigued
from the exertions of the morning and
was resting at the Occidental Hotel. At
2:45 word was received that he would soon
appear and President Hugh Craig rapped
I the Chamber to order. Every seat was
filled. Among the hundreds present were
A. W. Foster. Major General Merriam,
Rev. Horatio Btebblns, E. R. Dimond,
Frank L. Brown, Charles M. Yates. Judge
Morrow, Rolla V. Watt. Captain Nelson,
E. A. Newhall, J. D. Staples, C. L. Tay
lor, Stewart Menzie-s, Professor George
Davidson, Captain Fisher, U. S. A., and
others of equal prominence. It was. in
fact, a representative assembly and an air
of interest and contagious enthusiasm
was manifested throughout the proceed
ings.
Occupying a seat on the right of the
chairman was General Francisco Ganedo,
Governor of an important province of
Mexico, who is spending a few days' va
cation in this city. He was formally intro
duced and made a brief address *n Span
ish, which, translated by Mexican Consul
General A. F. Coney, is as follows: "Mex
icans are always glad to meet Americana.
There is an evident bond of sympathy
uniting the two peoples and it is growing
with the years. Our good President Diaz
has done much to foster this spirit in
Mexico and to encourage its growth. For
my part, I am glad to see the good work
go on and will do all in my power to for
ward the amicable relations of the two
countries."
The general Is of tall, commanding pres
ence, his hair, goatee- and mustachos
being iron gray. He sat patiently through
the speeches which followed, although
evidently unable to comprehend a word
of what was said.
In Introducing the members of the Com
mission, President Craig spoke as fol
lows: .-,,.. * ;.:â¢-...
The Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco
has never before entertained a more distin
guished company than the quintet of gentle
men who have honored us with their presence
this afternoon.
General Francisco Ganedo, Governor of Slna
loa, i 8 with us for a few days on a vacation.
To him, as merchants and underwriters, we
owe much for his liberal and businesslike ad
ministration of Mexican affairs at the cities
of MazHtlan and Altata, ports where so much
of our business with Mexico is transacted. â¢ _
The occasion of our meeting has been brought
about by the arrival in our midst of three of
the five commissioners appointed by the Presi
dent to proceed to Honolulu to examine into
and report upon the required legislation to com
plete the Introduction of our island republic as
a component part of the United States.
It is particularly gratifying to us to meet
these gentlemen, that we may extend to them
our warmest thanks and congratulations for
the able and effective manner by which they
in the Senate and Congress forwarded the
wishes of the shipping and commercial inter
ests of our city In face of the divided councils
of our own representatives. California, has
rarely been fortunate enough to secure a dele
gation united for our advantage. In Senators
Morgan and Cullom and Congressmen Hltt and
Newlands we have found' friends Indeed, when
we sorely needed them, and from the interest
they fasted in promoting Hawaiian an
nexation we may expect the same broad states
manship will speed our requirements in col
lecting promptly the $60,000,000 due the United
States Treasury by the Central Pacific, pro
moting the cable to Asia, via Hawaii, con
struction of the Nlcaraguan canal and acquisi
tion of the Spanish â¢ possessions in the North
Pacific. In commending these distinguished
statesmen for duties well done It is not inap
propriate that we should give due credit to a
patriotic American who laid down his life in
forwarding our offshore interests. The late
John 1... Stevens, Minister to Hawaii, caused the
Has to be raised on Hawaiian soil in 1893. Truly
the works of a. good man live after him, for to
his executive ability and foresight we owe
much of the enthusiasm that made annexation
possible. His name will ever be connected ap
provingly with the addition of another star to
the banner of the free and the brave.
Senator Morgan was then presented,
and made the opening speech on behalf
of the commission. After paying a clever
tribute to the hospitality of the San
Francisco people, he briefly referred to
his visit to the Hawaiian Islands last
year, when he went in search of informa
tion, believing that the day of annexa
tion was close at hand. "I found there a
Government as excellent as in Americaâ
as good as that in any of the States,
remarked Mr. Morgan. '"It is saying a
good deal, but only the truth. The
American Government stands foremost
among the Governments of the earth; vet
the American residents in the Hawaiian
Islands, during the course of years, had
succeeded in working out a system which
was simply admirable. It was as good
as that of any country on the
face of the earth. The beauties
of the system will be more fully
understood by our people as relations
with the islands become more familiar.
Let me ask a question: If the Philippines
or Cuba or Porto Rico were as thoroughly
civilized as are the Hawaiian Islands do
you think there would be a moment s
hesitation on the part of the American
people in admitting all of those islands

nnmmls^on that the members have long

the United States. They will be of vast
benefit both in peace and in war.
"As regards the Philippines, Cuba and

The Senator paid a high compliment
to the Union Iron Works. "Your iron

Scotts. will equal anything on earth. The
Oregon is on every man's lips - She is
the pride of the American navy. Your
city has a future. In fact, I like San
Francisco. When I finally get knocked
out over in Illinois I am soing to come
here and see If I cannot beat Perkins,
or somebody else."
Representative Hltt, of the Foreign Re
lations Committee and House member of
the commission, paid a glowing tribute
to the work accomplished by President
Dole and his associates in establishing
a good government in Hawaii. "V* c
should not forget him in the future, he
added. Speaking of the Eastern trade
Impetus which will result from the war,
Mr Hitt declared that the Hawaiian Isl
ands were of absolute necessity a part
of the American domain. "What is
more, we must and will speedily have the
Nicaraguan canal. While everybody was
watching the Oregon making her famous
trip around South America the question
was on each lip, 'Why haven't we got
the canal?' James. G. Elaine was an
earnest advocate of its construction, ard
while he was Secretary of State : he di
rected me, as the Assistant Secretary,
to gather all possible information con
cerning it and the opinions of members
of Congress. There will be no unneces
sary delay at the next session of Con
gress in arranging for the building of the
canal." _Â
Mayor Phelan, in a concluding address,
said to the Commissioners:
"The great East is now opening up to
American . trade and San Francisco will
become a much more Important place, in
the eyes of the General Government. In
the past we have had much difficulty in
getting the necessary appropriations for
harbor Improvements and other things
badly needed. In the future this will
probably all be changed. We will be an
acknowledged center rind will be deemed
worthy of more attention. California will
now get due recognition jn the halls of
Congress.
A vote of thanks to the Commissioners
for their evident interest in San Francisco
and her needs was tendered at the sugges
tion of Colonel Taylor.
The concluding: speech of the occasion
was made uv Senator Perkins. "We do
not want different laws in Hawaii from
thor o in the United States," he said. "No,
we want t_he same institutions, the same
tariff, the same protection to industry.
We want the same immigration laws. We
believe in the dignity of labor, and no
more contract labor in Hawaii. Nor do we
want foreign built vessels to participate
in the Hawaiian carrying trade to the
United States. We would Americanize the
islands in the broadest sense of the
word."
Last evening fully one hundred and fifty
members of the Union League Club and
Invited guests assembled in the league
rooms at the Palace Hotel, to bid wel
come to the three members of the com
mission and their party. Tasteful deco
rations of palms were interspersed with
the American national colors. The mili
tary element was very prominent in the
assemblage, fully one-fourth of those
present being attired in Uncle Sam's uni
form.
An address of welcome was offered in
behalf of the club by General Chipman,
to which a response was made by
Senator Cullom, who incidentally pre
sented some figures showing that each
successive addition to American territory
cost less than the one before. For in
stance, the Louisiana purchase cost 16
cents per acre. Alaska about 2 cents per
acre and Hawaii not a cent. Acquisitions
were getting cheap! The Senator thanked
the club for its, entertainment and said
he supposed that there were refreshments
stowed away somewhere to round out tha
evening.
Senator Morgan followed, devoting his
attention to the proposed Nicaragua ca
nal and its advantages to America, both
In times of peace and of war. He be
lieved that it would be of direct benefit to
the trade of San Francisco.
Congressman Hitt spoke the concluding
words In behalf of the commission, touch
ing on general topics of interest to the
merchants and other business men of the
Pacific Slope.
After the speeches an informal recep
tion followed, and many citizens present
were introduced to the Commissioners.
A collation was subsequently served in
an adjoining room. . i
You can tell by looking at some
women that they would make black
berry jam in flytime without a cover
on the kettle.
