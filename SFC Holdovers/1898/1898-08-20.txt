:. â¢. MADRID, Aug. 19. â Senor Pagasta
'â '..â â has stated that the actual situation
;.':.'now existing- as between Spain and the
â  X T riited States is neither peace nor war,
and that the situation is merely a sus
;'.jpettsion of hostilities.
~X â â  Spain desired an armistice, but the
"tJnited States did not agree to it. Spain,
.'. : -: -'in'.' resigning her sovereignty in Cuba
and Porto Rico, has not renounced all

: a-s : an honorable nation will not seek to
f/ ajnnex that which cannot legitimately
i-f fee as booty of war accord
" ing. to the conditions under which peace
.: â¢â was concluded.
!'.; :. &enor Sagaeta believes that, a cessa
': -tlon of hostilities having been pro
claimed, tfn- taking of Manila does not
â  -affect the Philippine problem. One of
â  1 the highest Spanish Jurists says that
';V among the ships captured by the
.Americans were many that did not
â  kiiow of the declaration of war, and
Vt&at their capture, like that of an army
..taken in similar ignorance, cannot pos-
! â â â  sibry be legally justified by interna-
'â  tional law.

LONDON'S VIEW AS TO
AMERICA'S POLICY
The Spectator Sees in Our Conquest
Beginning of an Over-Sea
; Tropical Empire.
X.ONDON, Aug. 19.â The Spectator in
â¢ : its issue this week prophesies that
America will retain all the Spanish
possessions she has captured, and
. thinks that "pressure from the Cuban
loyalists will force the commission to
stipulate that Cuba shall be governed
..by the United States for twenty years."
The Spectator says: "America will
find herself at the end of the year in
the possession of the beginning of an
over-sea tropical empire. Long may she
rule it in the interests of humanity and
justice. While it is so ruled England
will never begrudge her her possessions
nor their expansion into a do-mam as
â 'â  great as our own/"
PARIS TRIBUNAL WILL

Officials.
;: : â¢ WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â The claims
zn&di In Madrid that the protocol and
: not the capitulation controls the state
of affairs In the Philippines will not be
discussed by State Department offi
cials. The iiscussion is looked
. upon as rather academic, as it is taken
for granted that claims will be made on
both sides and that the Paris tribunal
will be the final arbiter of the case.

The San Francisco Call
ANNOYING
LETTERS SENT
MRS, DUNNING
Came From a Lady in
This City.
A MYSTERIOUS WARNING
DARK HINTS OF IMPENDING
TROUBLE.
Her Life Threatened by the Writer
If She Ever Returned to
the City of San
Francisco.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ© Call.
NEW TORK, Aug. 19.â A special to
the World from Dover, Del., says: Mrs.
John P. Dunning, the younger of ex-
Congressman Pennlngton's murdered
daughters, had been a silent sufferer
for at least two years before her death,
during all the time she was home with
her father.
There were circumstances that en
forced her separation from her husband
and compelled her to seek her former
home, while Mr. Dunning remained in
the far West seeking his living.
There was nothing discreditable to
either of them in this separation, sim
ply stress of circumstances. But not
long after she reached Dover there be
gan to arrive a series of annoying let
ters that were addressed to her from
San Francisco.
They were anonymous and gave no
hint as to the writer's identity beyond
the fact that It was a woman that sent
them.
The first of them contained dark
hints that Mrs. Dunning could not un
derstand, mysterious warnings that she
should beware of impending trouble
for her.
She was a strong young woman and
at the beginning destroyed the letters
and said nothing about them to her
parents or any other member of her
family here. She mentioned them in a
casual way In her letters to her hus
band, but did not even look to him for
any explanation of them. She con
sidered them simply as the production
of some crank that had learned of her
existence while she had lived with her
husband in San Francisco.
Then came letters that were Irss
vague. They charged her that she
should never think o-f returning to San
Francisco on peril of her life. These
she didn't destroy.
She showed all of them to her father
and some of them she mailed back to
her husband for investigation. What
he discovered cannot be learned until
he arrives here, for if he ever sent any
explanation to his wife she never to-ld
of it.
ASK FAVOES OF BLANCO.
Peculiar Requests of the New Span
ish Casino at Havana.
HAVANA, Aug. 19.â Yesterday the
President and newly elected board of
the Spanish Casino paid their respects
to General Blanco. The president, in
the name of all Spanish residents in
the island, requested General Blanco

Spanish colony, and in which the Span
ish O nsulate, the Casino and other es

might be established. He also request
ed General Blanco to authorize the col
lection of funds by popular subscrip
tion for the purpose of increasinT the
Ppnnish navy and erecting a Btatue in
memory of Senor Canovas del Castillo
and other works. General Blanco ans
wered that he found the petition logi
cal and practical, and promised to in
terest himself in furthering the de
sires of the petitioners.

MADRID, Aug. 19.â 1t is rumored that
the Government will instruct the Cuban
Commissioners to present a strong case
fur the rpcosnition of Spanish claUns for
compensation for the cession of public
works in Cuba, the compensation to take
the form of saddling upon Cuba the bulk
of the Cuban debt existing in 1895. The
papers advocate the strengthening of

HOUSTON, Tex., Aug. 19.â 1n
a speech at the big Populist en
campment at Greenville to-day
Senator Marion Butler of North
Carolina, national chairman of
the Populist party, surrendered
to the middle-of-the-roadsters,
or anti-fuslonists. He declared
that as national chairman he
would promise that there would
be no trades or combines with
either of the old parties before
the next national convention,
and he would call that conven

Democratic or Republican con
ventions convened and thus
prevent any opportunity for fu

RELIEVED OF COMMANDS.
Generals Wade, Butler and Gordon
to Act on Commissions.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â Major
General James F. Wade, formerly
in command of the Third Army
Corps at Chickamauga, and Major
General M. C. Butler, in com
mand of a division of the Second
Army Corps at Falls Church, were to
day relieved of their present duties in
order to enable them to enter upon the
discharge of their important duties as
members of the commission charged
with the execution of the provisions of
the peace protocol regarding the evacu
ation of Cuba by the Spanish troops.
A similar order was also issued to
day in the case of Brigadier General
William Gordon, commanding a di
vision of the Fourth Army Corps, who
has been appointed a member of a sim

SAYS CALIFORNIA
WILL SHOW HEAVY
REPUBLICAN GAINS
Predictioo of Representative Over
street After a Tour of the
State.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â Representative Overstreet of Indiana,
secretary of the Republican Congressional Committee, has just re
turned from an extended trip on the Pacific Coast. He gave'close
attention to political conditions existing there and predicts that Cal
ifornia will give an increased Republican representJition in the
House; that Senator White will be succeeded by a Republican Sen
ator, and that Maguire will be defeated by the Republican candi
date for Governor.
The same causes that carried Oregon for the Republicans are
operating in California with increased effectiveness.
Mr. Overstreet feels less hopeful of Washington, and admits the
loss of Utah and Colorado by the Republicans. He classes Wyom
ing as certainly Republican, prophesies extraordinary Republican
gains in Kansas, puts Nebraska in the doubtful list, and says his
own State, Indiana, is as certainly Republican as is Vermont.
succeed these officers In their present
commands, and it is not likely that
any action in that direction will be
taken for some time.
Major General Brooke, who is the
other army officer on the Porto Rican
commission, is now in that country and
probably will not be relieved of his
present duties until after the arrival
there of his colleagues on the com
mission.
TROOPS SAIL FBOM SANTIAGO.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Auk. 19 (af
ternoon).âA portion of the First Resrl

the steamer D. H. Miller. This after
noon 500 of the District of Columbia
troops sailed on the transport Hud
son, 500 of the Seventh Infantry on the
Yucatan and six companies of the
Thirty-fourth Michigan on the trans
port Santiago. The troop 3 are going
forward as rapidly as possible. Owing
to the increase in sickness there is
much need of hospital ships. The num

not sufficient accommodations for
them.

DIFFICULTIES AVOIDED
THROUGH ANNEXATION
London Times Advises the United
States to Hold Fast to the
Philippines.
LONDON, Aug. 20.â The Times this
morning says editorially that it fore
sees circumstances which may impel
the United States to a permanent occu
pation of Cuba, and adds:
"If America is prepared to under
take the responsibility of the govern
ment of the whole Philippine group, it
is hard to see how any other power
could legitimately interfere. If the
United States repudiates such respon
sibility, a very perilous state of things
might ensue, because it would not be
easy to dispute the right of other pow
ers to terminate the state of anarchy.
Therefore many difficulties will be
avoided by American annexation. In
any case, no Kuropean power need
reckon upon finding the United States
as easy to coerce as Japan."

PONCE, PORTO RICO, Aug. 19.â La
Neuva Era, an afternoon newspaper,
established the day after the occupa
tion of this city by United States
troops, was temporarily suppressed to
day by the United States military au
thorities because of the publication of
an article headed "Vengeance."
The article called upon Porto Ricans
to destroy Spanish property and pre
vent Spanish shopkeepers doing: busi
ness. This offense was worse in view
of the demonstrations of the last few
nights in various towns in the southern
part of the island against Spanish resi
dents.
The Spanish shopkeepers in Ponce
are now afraid to open their places.
Native police are powerless to curb the
spirit of the mob and it is doubtful
whether they would do anything if they
could. La Neuva Era's presses were
stopped after the flrst edition had been
put on the street. Its editor was ar
rested on a charge of inciting to mob
violence. This action and the deter
mined attitude of the provost guard
it is expected will bring citizens quickly
back to an orderly mood.
Spanish outrages in the northern part
of the island continue and the local pa
pers have published a list of victims
at Cailes. Among the names are those
of many young girls who have been ill
treated by Spanish soldiers.
General Miles probably will com
municate with Captain General Maciaa
about the matter.

CUBANS MUST DISBAND.
Island Insurgents Will Have to
Follow Peaceful Pursuits.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â A special to
the Times from Washington says:
There have been conferences between
Estrada Palma and other representa
tives of the Cubans and officials of the
United States relative to the insurgents
and what would be done with them.
Mr. Palma was advised that the
"United States would not consider the
question of compensation of the Cuban
troops, because there was no power in
the Government to do so, even if there
was the inclination. He was told that
the best thing the Cubans could do
was to advise the men in arms to dis
band, retire to their homes and engage
in peaceful pursuits.
That the members of the Cuban
Junta recognize that this is the only
thin? to do is seen in the fact that
emissaries have already been dis
patched to Cuba with a view of carry
ing out the desires of the United States
Government. These emissaries will
try to persunde the Cuban leaders that
resistance to the United States author
ity would result only in further dis
tress in Cuba.

CITY OF TENTS

Seekers Grows.
OUTLOOK IS NOT CHEERING
THOUSANDS FACE A SERIOUS
SITUATION.
Unable to Locate Claims or Even to
Pitch Their Tents Near the
Center of the Mining
Metropolis.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY SAM W. WALL.
DAWSON, X. W. T. r July 29.-With
th.- warm season more than half gone
the- army of people encamped about
Dawson In tents remains in it? full
BiroiiKth. The places of those who are
moving down the river is taken from
day to day by others who are just ar
riving and have yet to learn the dif
flcult conditions that, if they are to
stay, they must meet and overcome.
The conditions become more difficult
and burdensome every day. Each day
the fringe of cabins adds another
widened circle to the^outskirts of the
town and the i..an who comes to locate
next day finds himself compelled to be
nt with still another remove from
the center. What a hardship this is
to the settler can only be appreciated
when it is understood that the thi<kly
bullt up most outward circle lies more
than two miles from Front street, on
top of a steep hill. To reach it the
dweller there passes over a mile of
country almost without a cabin upon
it. The level swamp land and the
elopes of the hill to the east and south
of the town are comprised in the La
Due townsite, for which a. patent has
been issued, and to Stewart Mt-nzies'
application for a patent for forty acres
and to the Government reserve. On
this last, a wide space sufficient to ac
commodate half the city, the barracks
and Government buildings are located.
There is a space northward of the
townsite comprising about fifty acres
of a sloping hillside where squatters
were first directed. It is now the
choice residence part of town and
every lot i^ located upon. In this
tract lots are now held by their
private owners at not less than
one thousand and as high as live
thousand dollars. In the La Due town
sit" the most undesirable lot in the .
swamp is held at not less than one
thousand dollars. So it will be seen
the newcomer, unless he has plenty of
money to spend for his temporary resi
flence, is compelled to cross over the
high-priced w.-i.^te and practically seek:
a rocidenco in the outer wilds. The
Bummer trail to the mines takes up the ;
hill east of town and on the j
top discovers a plateau, sloping down '
fo the X: ndike River. To the hun- ;
dreds who went to Major Walsh on j
first arriving here asking where they '
might pitch their tents he told them
to go to this distant plateau. This
meant the packing of all their pro- ;
visions and effects to the top of this
high hill. Only those who meant to re- \
main there would do this and the woods
are now full of their cabins, or rather
the woods have given place to their
cabins. Tents have been pitched on ,
the Government reserve about the bar- |
racks and on the other reserve held by ;
the Government toward the north near |
the hospital and on the property of in
dividuals, wherever consent could be
gained, until the number 'runs above
five thousand.
The thick" fringe of boats and barges
along the water front etill accommo
dates a thousand more. These people
for the most part are simply sitting
here in a sort of trance, eating the pro
visions they brought in with so much
labor and wondering if .something will
not turn up for them to-morrow. The
police have several times issued orujs
to have the Government reserves va
cated, and Major Walsh, when the La
Due patent arrived, gave out a proc
lamation that he would sustain the
company In its effort to clear its rror
erty of squatters. So those who pull
up to the water front at Dawson, be
lieving that having reached their goal
their troubles are over, a\vakÂ» within
the hour to a realization of new trou
bles quite as harassing as any they
have seen. The orders to mov.; off the
reserve have been suspended as often
as given, for the tented squatters there
complain that they intend to remain
but a few days anyhow and It would
be a great hardship to compel them to
climb the hill with their goods in the
meantime. So the army of inaction
remains and the winter hurries on. To
clear the water front, especially at
certain landing places, is more Impor-
tant. Orders have again and- again
been Issued, but still the boats cling
to the shore line. A few days ago a
Northwest mounted policeman cut the
strings of a score of boats tied to the
shore within the reserve, and they
floated off down the stream, being
pulled In. however, by a boatman half
a mile below. This was done to make
room for a public wcodyard in contem
plation. The Yukon River has been
rising and falling in remarkable fash
ion for . some weeks past, rising as
much as a foot and falling again
within the same day. This is caused
by very heavy rains on some of the
branches of the river ,above. It has
been more effective In clearing the
squatters from off the bars in front of
the city than the police orders. It has
caused much loss and great discomfort
among them. Every day the question
is asked with growing anxiety, "What
are these people to do this winter?"
No doubt very many of them Intend
going out. They will probably float
down the river for more than 2000
miles that lie between them and St.
Michael in their small boats. Some
have already started on the long voy-
age.
It is feared, however, that the
great number who may be think
ing of this means of escape will be
soothed by the beautiful summer
â¢weather they are now enjoying, and
which may be expected to continue up
to the very edge of winter, into re
maining too long-. One day the warm
sun will be hidden by a rain cloud, the
rain next day will turn to snow, which
will not melt atraln till next spring, a
few days later ice will begin running
In the Yukon, and the exit downstream
is locked for this year. With those un
familiar with the swift approach of
the Arctic winter when undertaking to
again claim this country, it is difficult
to realize the danger. The weather
has been extremely warm during the
past week, the mercury rising to 100
degrees in the shade. There is a great
deal of sickness in the camp, there
being nothing less than an epidemic of
dysentery nnd also a number of cases
of fever. There are forty-five patients
in the hospital. Tim* O'Connor of San
Francisco died there last Thursday of
dysentery. He leaves a widow and chil
dren In San Francisco. The djwentery
and fever are generally charged by the
doctors to the water consumed. The
town is very poorly provided for in this
regard, there being few deep springs,
the water in general use being surface
and seepage, having the brown color of
the moss and very cold, as coming di
rectly off the ice. Half the big town is
sick on account of It, as . the warm
weather has having the an Intemperate
moss and very cold, as coming di
ly off the ice. Half the big town is
on account of tt, as the warm,
ther has tempted to an intemperate
use of it. A mad dog went snarling
through the streets a few days ago
snapping at the great number of dogs
in is path. He was killed, and an or
der is now in force requiring all dogs
to be tied up until the loth of August.
A negro boy has received the very
lucrative position of poundmaster. He
is given the right to capture and tie
up the dogs found running at large.
His charge for care and feed is at
Dawson rates.
The Dominion Creek affair, in which
Gold Commissioner Fawcett locked the
creek up until a certain day July
the dogs found running at large,
charge for care and feed is at
,-son rates,
le Dominion Creek affair, in which
1 Commissioner Fawcett locked the
k up until a certain day in July
and then threw it open three days be
fore the date fixed, to the great ad
vantage of a number who knew that
the order was to be changed, has been
the subject of constant irritation since
then, not (inly between the Commis
sioner and the people, but between the
Commissioner and Major Walsh. The
friction there has resulted almost in a
rupture, Fawcett being interviewed by
the committee appointed by the mass
meeting there has resulted almost in a
ture, Fawcett being interviewed by
committee appointed by the mass
â ting charged the change in the or
der to Major Walsh. Major Walsh
being confronted with this declaration
flatly denied the truth* of it, and there
was immediate cause for trouble. The
relations of the two officials are not
cordial even in a slight degree. Mass
meetings of miners have recently be
come of frequent occurrence, and in
them all the officials are severely crit
icized, especial pleasure being taken in
speaking plain concerning the Gold
Commissioner. The last meeting of
this kind framed a petition to Major
Walsh, asking him to suppress the
Mine Exchange. This is the institu
tion where claims are auctioned every
afternoon. The low prices at which
many claims have sold at the exchange
have had a tendency to demoralize the
market. Claim owners and brokers
say the place has done more injury to
the mining industry than has the roy
alty tax, and this expression was used
in the petition to Walsh. It was suf
ficient to cause him to refuse to grant

flLÂ»ils and the law had been coupled
as evils alike in character it would be
inconsistent in him to suppress one ami

he had not done it; therefore, he grant

Auction houses are doing a big bus -
! ness in disposing of outfits ottho*e
who. not finding here what they ex
pected, are eager to get away. There
! are three regular auction houses soen
eaired .not to speak of the independent
dividual who rises up at interval
along the water front and auctions his
gTh'e^Sn-up in so far as It will be
completed this year is almost over. A
TOt deal of ground will not be washed
at all. so loth are the miners to render
ing up the 10 per cent royalty This
royalty has given the whole district the
jaundice. The disgust of the mine
owners, big and little, is felt in the
street and on the trail, everywhere.
Very many claims that would other
wise be worked will not be touched,
beyond the necessary representing
work this winter. The hope is. of
course that the tax will be lifted and
if it is wthin the year the gold that
lies frozen in the ground will have
earned very good interest over that
which has been dug and washed out.
Generally, however, preparations are
begun for 'the coming winter's mining
operations. _ .

KID M'PARTLAND
GETS THE DECISION
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.-"'Kid" McPart
iar.d of this city and Owen Zeigler of
Philadelphia fought twenty-flve rounds
before the Atlantic Cluh. and Charley
White, the referee, decided in favor of
MrPartland. who. with the- exception of
the last round, had the better of the bout.
ftfcPartland surprised many of those who
watched the fight by using his right hand
effectively, while his left was continually
playing havoc with Zeigler's face. Zeigler
fought desperately in the last two rounds,
and had the better of the New Yorker
in the work accomplished, but this was
not enough to counterbalance the lead
which the "Kid" had pained previously.
The men met at catch weights for a
twenty-round contest, and agreed to box
until ordered to break away by the ref
eree.

THEIR STEERING GEAR LOST BE
FORE THE RACE.
Pluckily Row Without It and Lsad
the Midgets by Ten Full
Lengths at tha
Finish.
Special Dippatch to The Tall.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 19.â The Ala
meda barge crew won the four-oared
race from the South End Midget crew
by ten lengths in the Astoria regatta
to-day. The outcome was a surprise.
Before the contest Alameda money
could not be found in the town. Every
body had picked the South Ends for
easy winners.
The race was rowed in the rain orÂ«
a measured mile and a half course with
a turn. The water was very smooth
with a strong flood tide running, me
stakes were set up stream, which gave
the crews the benefit of the current
eoing up. while coming back it was a
hard pull against the tide
When the crews lined up for the start
it was found the aluminum rudder or
the Alameda barge hafl mysteriously
dropped off and sunk. This left the
Alameda boat without steering gear,
as another rudder could not be found.
It was thought the race would go to
the South Ends by default, but the
Alameda crew, after some delay, lined
up again, with the cockswain steering
the boat with the paddle of an Indian
loe. Their ambition to row under
circumstances received great ap
jse from the thousands who lined
course, and when they came home
f winners the cheering was terrific,

t the start the Aiamedas had the

f were away a half length in the

th Ends quickly forged to the front,
however, and were three lengths in
front half way to the stake They
were rowing a slow 24-stroke and never
once changed this for a spurt during
the entire course. .
The Aiamedas were zigzagging all
over the river, and !i seemed as if the
Midgets were taking things easy go
ing up just to have the Aiamedas stay
in the race. The latter were being
cheered to the echo by all along the
river for their plucky work and were
pulling a steady 30-to-the-mimue
St Th k e%urn was reached with the South
length farther up the river than their
opponents' and it was here they lost
the race. The Aiamedas came up *ith
a rush for the turn, the cockswain held
the paddle down as a pivot on the side
of the boat and in one strike they were
around an 1 , in the row home three
lengths ahead of the "Midgets be iÂ° r e

the Alameda crew set up a 34-stroKe
and was walking away from the South
Ends, who seemed indifferent as to the
finish, as they never even quickened
their stroke to catch the Aiamedas.
The time of the winning crew was
10-54. The South Ends crossed thirty
four seconds later. The personnel of
the two crews is as follows:
Alamertaâ V. Nidcock, bow; A. Hansen,

Thi's afternoon the weather cleared,
and the immense crowds on shore and
afloat were entertained by swimming
matches, greased pole contests, tub
races, canoe races, duck hunt, net
throwing contests, fish boat races and
other events. A very exciting swim
ming contest was that between the
two Calif ornians, Pape and Webb, over
a 75-yard course, the former winninsr.
Both men were hauled into the boat
almost exhausted. Pape's time was
The wind was light and came in
puffs, making the sailing races very
slow. At the signal, however, eleven
fish boats entered for the first race un
der working sails, and made a beautiful
appearance as they passed the flagship
with their canvas spread lazily to catch
what little breeze there was. The start
was made at 1:58, and the winning boat
issed the line at 6:03, having gone

FIGHTING CRAFT
IN GRIM PARADE
Final Orders for the
Naval Review.
SALUTE AT GRANT'S TOMB
TWENTY-ONE GUNS TO BE FIRED
BY THE WARSHIPS.
Mayor Van Wyck and New York Cit
izens Will Deliver an Address
to Sampson and
His Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â Final or
ders were sent to-day to Admiral
Sampson relative to the naval parade
at New York City on Saturday. The
ships will proceed to the anchorage at
Tompkinsville, and there await the ar
rival of Mayor Van Wyck and a dele
gation of citizens, who are to go
aboard the flap-ship and deliver an ad
dress to Admiral Sampson and the men
of his command. This ceremony will
occur before 10 o'clock Saturday morn
ing, as the orders contemplate to start
up the North River at 10 o'clock. An
ticipating a pressure to gain admission
to the flagship during the review the
orders are that no one Is to be allowed
aboard except on the express direction
of the President. The salute at the
tomb of General Grant will be the na
tional salute of twenty-one guns.
Acting Secretary of the Navy Allen
attended the Cabinet meeting to-day
and explained the plans for the naval
review, and it was decided that Secre
tary Alger, Secretary Bliss, Secretary
Gage, Attorney General Grlggs and
Postmaster Emory Smith would repre
sent the administration at the review.
ARRIVAL OF SAMPSON
AND SCHLEY DELAYED
Fort Hancock Will Thunder a Salute
When Their Ships Pass
Sandy Hook.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â Rear Admirals
Sampson and Schley and the six ves
sels of the North Atlantic squadron
that are coming to this port were ex
pected to arrive some time this after
noon, but had not been reported at a
late hour to-night. Off Sandy Hook
the vessels will be met by a flotilla of
excursion craft and escorted up the
bay to the man-of-war anchorage off
Tompkinsville. As the warships pass
in at Sandy Hook the guns at Fort
Hancock will thunder a salute. At
Forts Wadsworth Â«and Hamilton more
salutes will be fired, so that the arrival
of the squadron will be announced to
the citi ns of New York, who are
waiting to do honor to the returning
snilors
The officers and men on the warships
are unaware of any, reception preparing
fur them and Read Admiral Sampson
will be informed by a message sent
down in a dispatch boat as soon as he
arrives. The tars will then have to
bestir themselves in preparation for
the parade which is to take place to-
morrow.
Judging by the number of excursion
steamers and tugs being engaged for
to-morrow the river will be crowded
with all kinds of craft, loaded with
sightseers, who will cheer the tars all
the way along the route of the parade.
A great many steamers and tugs were
hired for private parties and many not
so engaged will take on all who want
to go on the river and follow the war
ships up and down. The harbor police
expect a busy day keeping the river
clear for the warships. As yet they
have framed no regulations, but they
wlll probably do so to-day.
The parade, if the warships arrive on
time is to start at 10 o'clock from the
anchorage off Tompkins'vllle. The war
ships will steam slowly up the Hudson
River to Grant's tomb, where a na
tional salute of twenty-one guns will
be fired. They will then make a wide
circle and slowly steam back to the
man-of-war anchorage. The excursion
steamers, it is expected, will wait for
the warships to pass by and will then
follow in their wake, making a long
and picturesque procession. Every
vessel will be gay with bunting, and it
is expected that there will be more
stars and stripes afloat in the harbor
than were ever seen at one time before.
As the vessels pass Castle William a
salute will be fired. This salute will
be equivalent to an announcement
that the parade has started.
The Texas, which has been thorough
ly overhauled at the navy-yard, is
ready to join in the parade, and will
be seen at her proper place in the line.
The cruiser St. Paul will also join the
parade; so will the antique monitor
Nahant. which has been anchored in
the harbor since the war began. The
vessels in line will be the New York.
Brooklyn, Texas, Massachusetts, Ore
gon, Indiajia, lowa, St. Paul and Na
hant.
General Glllespie, commander of the
Department of the East, was ordered
yesterday to have the forts salute the
vessels and he in turn issued orders to
the officers in command at the forts.
As the day is to be a general hoMday
In this vicinity, the river front will
doubtless be crowded with sightseers.
Every spot from Avhich a view of the
procession can be obtained will be oc
cupied. There will be crowds on the
riverside drive and in the parks, where
the regulations prohibiting walking on
the grass will be suspended for the
day. At the battery there will be an
other large crowd and on the piers and
docks, where admittance can be ob
tained, there will be thousands to cheer
the returning sailors.

BARK THEOBALD TURNS
UP AFTER MANY DAYS
Was Delayed by Light Winds All the
Way From This Port to Seattle.
SEATTLE, Aug. 19.â The bark Theo
bald arrived in port to-day, having left
San Francisco on July 2C in ballast. The
delay was occasioned by light winds dur
ing the entire trip, the best run being
eighty miles one day. Captain Cameron
states that for the past ten days he had j
been drifting within a few hours' sailing !
of Cape 1 .attery. He saw thirty-three
vessels while on the trip. The tirst one i
In- iveognized was the ship J. B. Brown,
seven day? apo. 250 miles off Flattery. She
left San Francisco on July 24, and was j
towed into Comax to load coal for Hono- j
U \VhilP in sight of Cape Flattery nearly j
ten days Captain Cameron spoke the j
schooner Spokane, Mary E. Russ Sal- j
vator and St. Nichola. all from San Fran- |
Cisco und a long time out. The latter |
waa hound for Comax to take on coal, i
The Salvator was thirty-three days out
and the Spokane twenty-nine days, while
the Russ left the same day as the Theo
bald. They are now in the straits.
FRESNO YOUTH
HELD FOR ARSON
Suspected of Firing the
Packing Houses.
CIRCUMSTANCES AGAINST HIM
CAUGHT IN A BURNING SHED
THAT NIGHT.
His Name Is Frank Faymonville and
He Has Frequently Been
Arrested for Petty
Offenses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Aug. 19.â Frank Faymon
ville. a youth of 20 years of age, Js
end r arrest on a charge of arson. He
was taken into custody by Fire Mar
shal Henry Russell on suspicion of hav
ing set the fire Sunday night which
wiped out the packing house reserva
tion and destroyed $300,000 worth of
property.
Faymonville was seen under very
suspicious circumstances during the
fire A blaze was found in a box fac
tory on the side of the Tenney Canning
Company. The building had caught
fire several times on the roof from
sparks from the other burning struct
ures, but those fires were easily ac
counted for. The blaze in the interior
of the box factory, however, was clear
ly incendiary- Faymonville was found
in the shed by a man named Walter
Ayres, who had been hauling freight
from the cannery. Faymonville was
employed in the box factory and pre
tended that he entered the shed to get
his hatchet. When asked about the
fire he said, "This is my fire." After
ward he tried to explain this remark.
The fire from within was started
against the back wall of the shed in a
pile of sawdust and shavings.
Faymonville denies the charge. He
also denies having made the remark
to Ayers. The young man is the son
of Mrs. Bailey K. Leach, who keeps the
Little Klondike restaurant on X street.
Faymonville, although a young man,
has been in trouble a number of times
and has been frequently arrested for
petty offenses. The officer^have had
him under surveillance since the fire,
but did not arrest him until they had
worked up the case. He was arraigned
in Recorder Clark's court to-day and
given time to plead.

RAISE RATES TO
ALASKAN PORTS
Combine of Transporta
tion Companies.
HAS NO FEAR OF OPPOSITION
CANADIAN BOATS OUT OF THE
BUSINESS.
First - Class Passage From Seattle
to Skagoiay, Dyea and Juneau
Advanced to $40, Sec
ond Class $25.
SEATTLE, Aug. 19.â Another com
bine to keep up freight and transporta
tion rates was effected to-day among
the transportation companies operating
between Seattle and L.ynn Canal, Al
aska. Each company in the com
bine has put up a certified check for
$400. The penalty for each offense is
to be $200. The list of companies who
have entered into the new agreement,
with the boats operated, is as follows:
Coast Steamship Company, operating
the steamers Al-Ki, Cottage City, City
of Topeka and Elder; Washington
Steam Navigation Company, operating
the steamer Discovery; Alaska Steam
ship Company, operating the steamship
City of Seattle; Washington and AiasK*
Steamship Company, operating the
steamer Rosalie; Seattle Steamship
Company, operating the steamer
Utopia, and the West Coast Steam
Navigation Company, operating the
steamer Farallon.
The important point, of course, is the
rates decided on. First class passage
to Skaguay, Dyea and Juneau under
the combine rule is $40; second class.
$25 Freight will be carried at $13 per
ton, horses $22 50 each, and other live
stock in proportion.
The new combine has little to fear
from Canadian boats, for Victoria and
Vancouver have practically dropped
out of the Alaskan business. The Tees
is about the only boat on the run from
those ports. She has no first-class ac
commodations and has been charging
the same rate second-class as does the
combine.
WAR TIME SCENES
WILL BE ENACTED
MIMIC WRECK OF THE MAINE
AND DEWEY'S FIGHT.
Elaborate Production on the Stage at
Central Park To-Night of
Eistorical Scenes of
the War.
W) â¢" California's gallant soldiers come
bacn from Manila and begin to tell their
relatives and frirtids all about the ter
rible devil dance of the natives of the
Philippine Islands, the people of this city
will know just as much about it as the
brave soldier boys. This is to be one of
the most elaborate features of the scenic
reproduction of the destruction of the
Maine and the battle of Manila, which
will have its initial presentation at < '. n
tral Park to-night. It will be a realise
picture of the life of tho natives of the
Philippines, and will illustrate life th 're
as it existed before Spanish misrule drC -c
the natives into revolt. Aguinaldo and
a horde of native sub-chiefs will be prop
erly - ortrayed as interested spectators of
this dance. Ay realistic as will be the
dance of the islanders, it will be sur
passed in thrilling interest by the repro
duction of the wreck of the Maine. With
a fearful crash, amid exploding maga
zines and bursting flames, the great,
massive ship will rise in the air to fall
back again into the waters, a tangled
mass of. twisted iron, steel and brass
Another special feature of the display will
be the reproduction of the stirring pic
ture "The Birth of the Stars and
Stripes." This will represent the plot
which led to the destruction of the Maine,
and illustrate the birth and growth of
patriotism throughout the country when
the news of that fearrul disaster was
flashed over the wires.
The interior of the forts at Cavite will
be another of tho many interesting
scenes. Sentinels will be seen on the huge
parapets. Then will come a change of
scene in which the entire bay and the
City of Manila will be shown with Dew-
U- s fieet in action. There will be burst
ing shells, monster battle-ships in mo
tion, concHidins with Dewey s victory,
displayed in magnificent California made
All material and labor used in the con
struction of this display are of home
production. The stage and drop curta a
are the larartsi ever used. The whole
Â«?cene is vivid in its realism, and from
the dress rehearsal last night will prove a
sensation in enacting before the people
incidents that have made history in re-
Vent months. The effect of the various
tableaux will be heightened by the inge
nuity of the persons in charge of the fire
works. _

Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â The State
department to-day received a cable
"dispatch from Minister Hunter at
.Guatemala, telling of the dramatic
di a't.h of General Morales, leader of
. the Guatemalan revolution. The dis
pa-cli is as follows:
- -GUATEMALA. Aug. IS.â Day. "Washlnfr
' ton: Ocos was occupied on the 10th by the
'.'Government forces and '.-"-i sacks of coffee
and -other valuable property saved from
destruction. This occupation v.as made
without force by Captain Feegan or the
British gunboat Leander, acting under
' the request of the British, German and
â¢â¢'.United States Ministers.
â¢â :â¢ Morales retreated before the national
â '.troops to the Cuchumatanes Mountains,
â¢ : "where" he. was surrounded and captured
' Yesterday in a cave, where he had been
:fil'dln.g tor several days without food and
111 from hunger, fatigue and exposure.
- The commanding general ordered him re
: .moVed to San Marcos. Medical aid was
.= -summoned, but he died on the way at Ban
â  Sebastian last night at 11. This is the
.".end of the revolution. HUNTER.
â¢'; â¢- The tragic end of General Morales, as
reported to the State Department, is
.â¢but the last of the series of stirring
-â¢Events which have occurred in Guate
' mala ' within the last two weeks.
" Morales gathered together a good sized
.Wnd along the Mexican border and
.: made his appearance at the large town
â¢.of Ocos. Here he inaugurated a reign
â¢of terror. He seized many thousand
bags, of coffee and put them to the
'/strange use of building breastworks
â¢ : 'f.or' his revolutionary band. Sorties
:-.;w.ere -made along the harbor front and
.^launches and other craft were burned
: nd destroyed. One of his most au
â¢ (Jacious acts was the laying tribute
Vupoii the United States Consul and
.Other Consular officials there in the
' -"sum of $1500.
.V : â¢The condition of affairs has been re
:^rted to the State Department from
'time to- time, and efforts were made, in
<Vinhr.Â«t>. .n with the Mexican authori
ses-; : to put an end to the depredations.
There, was some delay, however, owing
â  kiS the death of the Mexican Minister's
â¢ â wife, and his consequent absence from
â â .AY a shin,',' ton. Ordinarily the United
. siat-- Is represented in Guatemalan
. jwaters by a warship, but owing to the
' "^ar 'with' Spain all our ships have been
. ;-!r?>fiiir>-'l elsewhere. It is for this rea
â¢*oni. probably, that the foreign repre
sentatives, including those of the Unit
, ; ; ed States, united in asking the aid of
'.; the' British naval commander at Ocos.
l'?!Efils has proved effective, according to
.'the' -Report just received from Minister
."Hunter, as the revolution is ended with
?JtÃÂ£-| capture and death of General
â '.Mora
- â "V" V PrpspertJ Morales has been a con- <
jspicuoiis figure in Central American
â  â¢aTTaclrji during the last three years. He

URGED TO BUILD
THE WATERWAY
Nicaraguan Canal Now
a Necessity.
LESSON TAUGHT BY THE WAR
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE AS A
DISTANCE REDUCER.
Eloquent Plea by Judge Grosscup for
a Policy of Expansion â Domi
nation Over Asio Our
Puture Destiny.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SARATOGA, N. V., Aug. 19.â The
National Conference on the forpign
policy of the United States was opened ;
here to-day with an address by Henry ;
Wade Rogers of Chicago, chairman of J
the committee of arrangements. Mr.
Rogers said that the conference was j
called to consider some of the most
momentous questions in the history of
the republic.
He referred to the close friendship
between the Americans and British,
which would probab'-- lead to interna
tional arbitration and finally to uni
versal peace. The speaker spoke fa
vorably of the Nicaragua canal, which,
he argued, should be built and con
trolled by the United States Govern
ment. That canal will shorten the
distance by water to San Francisco by
. In.OOO miles. A reference to the trip of.
' the battleship Oregon elicited hearty
' applause. Mr. Rogers said that the j
principal problem before the present
i conference was that of territorial ex
pansion, on which many distinguished
men of national reputation hold widely
different views.
Commercial interests urge that we
should adopt a colonial system, said
Mr. Rogers, but business alone ought
not to control our conduct.
The question of the Nicaragua canal
was taken up and Warner Miller of
New York took the platform. He
briefly spoke of his persistent advocacy
of the canal. Events of the past three
months demanded its immediate con
struction, and he believed all Ameri
cans were now universally in favor of
I it as was also all of Europe. He spoke
of the numerous surveys made <>f
every proposed route to pierce the Isth
mus* and said the route by the way of
the Nicaragua canal has received the
i greatest consideration as being both |
feasible and desirable. He added:
â T' c canal can be built for from
$100,0 \OOO to $140,000,000, as shown by
stat'en. Nts made by experts. Is the
canal uesirable? That it would re
duce the distance between New lork
, and San Francisco 10,000 miles is alone
; a sufficient answer to the affirmative.
"The Nicaragua canal would be a
great outlet for those States on the Pa
cific Coast. The continent Is grid-
Ironed with transcontinental roads, but
these do not alone afford the advan
tages that could be secured by a canal.
It is a question of cheap transporta
tion, and the Nicaragua canal would
solve the problem. Within ten years
after Its completion the population of
the Pacific States will have increased
to 10,000,000. One of the best results
of the Spanish- American war Is that it
will compel the building of the Nic
aragua canal."
The entire morning session was de
voted to a discussion of the Nicaragua
canal.
The annexation problem was taken
up at the afternoon session. Carl
Schurz of New York spoke at length,
giving the views of the anti-expansion
ists whose cause he advocated. He
was opposed by Judge Grosscup of Chi
cago, who is an earnest expansionist.
Judge Grosscup said in part:
"I am among those who believe that
the people of the United States, with
out breach of faith to the promises of
our past or serious danger to the ex
pectations of our future, should hold
permanently all, or a portion, of the
territory that has been occupied by our
troops during the progress of the war.
I am ready to go a step farther and
assert that the obligations of cur duty
toward mankind, and especially toward
the particular peoples who have been
drawn within the sphere of our opera
tions and toward the future usefulness
of ourselves, demand that we should
permanently retain so much of these,
the captures of war, as are needed to
round out the moral purposes for which
it was inaugurated and the greater
destiny on which, as a nation, we are
about "to enter.
"The immediate question, the one
that by its solution, will either bring
us in or bar us out of this larger na
tional sphere, relates to the perma
nent occupation of our Spanish con
quests. The true question is not
whether Porto Rico, Hawaii and the
Philippines are intrinsically worth the
responsibilities incurred by their occu
pation; whether their commerce and
resources will counterbalance the new
dangers that their acquirement would
introduce into our political system. For
I see behind them, in the horizon
toward which we are heading, looming
up from the Pacific, In mountainous

interest and opportunity â against
which tho outlines of the Philippines
are but a handspeck â something more
than islands, nothing cisc than a con
tinent.
"Within Asia lies the interest and op
portunity that by its largeness dwarfs
every other prospect. I favor the ac
quisition of Porto Rico, partly because
the moral purpose of this war demands
that it should no longer be a political
plague spot in the otherwise purified
Caribbean Sea, but chiefly because it
is at the gateway to the Caribbean â a
sea that when the commerce of Asia
is fully developed and the Nicaraguan
canal opened will, from both a naval
and commercial view, become the most
important water i/n the face of the
globe. 1 favor the acquisition of Ha
waii, and I favor the acquisition of the
Philippines, or so much of them as may
be needed, solely because in the new
career of commercial activity upon
which, I trust, we are a"J>out to- enter
we need clear across the Pacific a line
of naval stations and home ports; sta
tions In every sense our own, carrying
under the soil the American title and
over it the American Mag.
"I favor the retention of the Philip
pines or at least a part of them, that
they may stand as a tangible continu
ing demonstration of the physical pres
ence of the republic In Asiatic waters.
The value of these conquests is not in
their territory, nor their resources,
separately considered, but in the fact
that as an entirely they constitute a
chain precisely adapted to the expand
ed sphere in which we are to enter. I
care little for the links, individually,
but everything for the chain that will
henceforth hold us to out opportunities
in the far East."
Judge Grosseup declared that in his
judgment the most interesting and Im
portant object of our future foreign
policy was involved in the Immediate
future of Asia. The break up in the
current of Asiatic life is at hand, he
declared, and the gates are opening
upon a market the full magnitude of
which has not yet dawned upon the
world. The far-seeing statesmen of
Europe appreciate the situation, he
said, and far-s-:eelng America must soon
compass it.
In conclusion, Jude-p Grosscup de
clared that the course of the nation
was clear. If the American people are
earnest in their purpose to participate
in the development of the East, he said,
they need these islands as strategic
points, and as an integral part of the
naval force. Without a naval display,
he asserted the country can never se
cure its proper share in th>> commerce
of the East, or protect it after it is ob
tained.
A general discussion followed, partic
ipated In by Judge Orosscup, Carl
Schurz, Harry C. Garfield of Cleveland,
F. B. Thurher of New York. John W.
Couehlin of Fall River. J. Davis Duf
field of Fall River, F. S. Shack of New-
York nnd others.

REST WILL RESTORE
CAPT. CLARK'S HEALTH
Condition of the Naval Hero Not so
Serious as Has Been Believed.
ST. JOSEPH. Mich., Aug. 19.âCap
tain Charles E. Clark commander of
the battleship Oregon, and one of the
heroes of the naval battle of Santiago,
is coming to St. Joseph to meet his wife
and daughters and seek rest and re
cuperation. He will be the guest of
his brother, Lloyd Clark, custodian of
the United States lighthouse station at
this port.
Mrs. Clark and her daughters arrived
from California a month ago and have
been anxiously waiting the close of the
war and the captain's return. He is
expected here within a few days, hav
ing arrived at New York on the
steamer St. Paul. Immediately on his
arrival he telegraphed his brother that
he was In good condition and that Jis
soon as he could get through the quar
antine restrictions he would start for
St. Joseph.
Mr. Lloyd Clark says:
"The captain's illness is not at <*11 ho
serious as might be supposed on
account of the Medical Board of Sur
vey's report. He was worn out by his
long cruise from San Francisco, his
arduous duties and tht supreme excite
ment of the battle. The strain caused
a recurrence of an intestinal trouble
which he contracted while engaged in
a survey along the South American
coast some years ago, and the doctors
recommended, as timely and wise, that
he be released from duty for a period

En route to Dawson last fall Pettit

sold his padlock to an old miner for
$20, and taking this hint he twice went
up the river, buying all available pad
locks of incoming Klondikers, whtrh he
sold at Dawson for $20 each, clearing
$700 by the speculation. With this he
began speculating in Klondike claims,
with the result that he came out last
spring with deeds to ail or part of the
twenty-two claims he has now sold in

RETRENCHMENT IN
ARMY DEPARTMENTS
Men Discharged as Bapidly as Is
Consistent With the Good of
the Service.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.âRetrench
ment in nearly all branches of the
army is following close upon the cessa
tion of hostilities. Notably is this the
case in the ordnance, quartermaster
and engineer bureaus, where the needs
of the supplies required and the men
employed for the exigencies of war no
longer exist. It the ordnance bureau
the force at the various arsenals is to
be reduced in all cases where this can
be accomplished without detriment to
the service.
The quartermaster s department is
dispensing as rapidly as possible with
such of the transports as were char
tered and for which there is now no
necessity.
In the engineers' department the ser
vices of electricians, mechanics and
laborers engaged in the work of harbor
and river mine defense and of boatmen
employed to patrol the adjacent waters
to warn approaching craft of their
danger also are being: discharged as
rapidly as is consistent with the good
, of the service.
WARSHIPS GATHER
AT FORT MONROE
Seventy Vessels of the United States
Navy Will Rendezvous
There.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â One of the
largest fleets of warships ever as
sembled In an American port will be
brought together in the next few days
at Fort Monroe. Already fifty-seven
warships are under orders to rendez
vous there and the orders still to be
issued will raise the total to the neigh
borhood of seventy.
The movement of these ships north
ward is due to the .close of hostilities
and more particularly to the desire to
get the ships away from points of pos
sible fever Infection. They will now be
put into thorough repair and their
crews will be gradually changed from
naval militiamen to sailors of the regu
lar navy.
CONDEMNATION OF A
FRUIT PACKING HOUSE
HELD TOTALLY UNFIT FOR HU
MAN OCCUPANCY.
Inspector Dockery Orders the Over
land Company on Battery Street
to Vacate Its Premises
Within Ten Days.
The filthy condition of the Overland
Fruit Packing Company's establishment,
at 912 Battery street, discovered by Chief
Food Inspector J. P. Dockery yesterday,
caused him to give offlclU notification
that the place must be vacated and
closed within ten days.
Mr. Dockery said last night that during
the past two months of the fruit packing
season he had not met. In all the inspec
tions made, another such instance of ut
ter disregard of the laws of sanitation
and the rules that should naturally gov
ern the conduct of an industry of this
character.
"There are about 100 women, young
girls and little children there." he said,
and many of them are compelled to wear
rubber boots or shoes In the fruit paring
room. Under the plank flooring there is
an inch or more of stagnant wp'.or, which
spurts up through the cracks between the
planking, rendering the room an unfit
place for occupancy."
Mr Dockery was accompanied by Chief
Market Inspector Davis, who agrees with
him that It was the worst case that has
come under the observation of the Health
Office this season. Mr. Davis, assisted by
Inspector Rivers, also condemned yester
day four tons of fish and GOO pounds of
hams at the Clay Street Market, and 200 i)
pounds of salt pork at the Washington
street wharf.

PARDEE AND
GAGE LEAD
THE RACE
But Other Candidates
Are Still Entered,
FLINT IS THE THIRD CHOICE
MOST PECULIAE CAMPAIGN IN
THE PARTY'S HISTORY.
Republicans Anxiously "Watching
the San Francisco Delegation,
Men Mentioned for Minor
Places.
Around the Palace Hotel corridors and
the headquarters of the Republican State
Central Committee the general opinion Is
thai the contest for the Republican nomi
nation for Governor has narrowed down
to two menâ Dr. George C. Pardee of Oak
land and Henry T. Gage of Los Angeles.
Still there are others in the race, and
while they have not opened headquarters
jr. this city they are making every effort
to secure the support of delegates from
the country districts. Thomas R. Flint
DR. PARDEE FEELS A DELEGATE'S PULSE.
Jr. nf San Luis Obispo is now given third j
; by the wise ones. Besides these
gentlemen, Attorney Charles S. Patton,
ley-General W. P. Fitzgerald, ex-
Secretary of State L. H. Brown, General
John H. Dickinson anil M. M. Estee are I
mentioned as possibilities. A week ago
Irving M. Scott and W. R. Davis were
considered as probable candidates for the
nomination fur Governor, but their names
arc not now included in the list kept by
the politicians.
Ind Gage as a trainer or campaign
doctor is ex-HarK r Commissioner
Charles Bassett. When it was whispered
around the court and recesses of the Pal
; a a new comer, not of the south
land, was directing affairs in a confiden
tial way at the headquarters of the Los
s candidate , there was a break to j
find out something regarding the recruit. j
Presently the story ran around that "Old
Pard" Bassett, an anti-monopoly con- j
tributor to the Daily Report, had joined
the column of Gagers. Charley Bassett
is not "Old Pard" Bassett by a long shot,
but he is an old timer in the political
arena, having served on the Republican
State Central Committee. The distinction
is frequently applied to Bassett of having
discovered H. H. Karkham. It is true
that while nearly all the San Francisco
were talking W. W. Morrow
lor Governor, Bassett was going around
in a solemn, owlish fashion, telling people
that there was a man in the south named
Markham, who had served in Congress
and who was available. In the campaign
at Sacramento resulting in the nomina
tion of Markham Bassi tt gained local re
nown as the picker of gubernatorial win
i.. is. Burns and Bassett, who were the
promoters of Markham 's candidacy, are
Bald to be fairly in line for Gage. Jesse
Marks and Leon Deimery were callers at
Gage h< adquarters last evening and spoke
iraglnk words to the candidate.
Joseph ( amplicil -aid a visit to the
leading candidates last evening. Mr.
Campbell, who was formerly from San
Joaquin County, is now a resident of San
Francisco and a delegate to the State
convention from the Forty-first District.
He has rendered his party splendid serv
ice on the stump and will no doubt re
ceive cheering recognition in the conven
tion.
]>r. Pardee had his share of visitors at
I uarters ktst evening, and greeted
all comers in a frank and cordial man
ner. The do< tor is a good campaigner.
Little trifles aii'l disappointments do not
wear on him. If the delegates come to
him he will greet them, but if they do not
come he will not die of grief. Pardee's
friends are very confident of success.
Lou Brown, one of the candidates for
the head of the ticket, came down from
Sacramento last night and registered at
the Palace. Ho has no intention of open
ing headquarters, but will be on the
ground to shake hands with delegates
from the country. Mr. Brown's friends
claim that the San Francisco delegation
will not be a unit for any candidate and
that their man has an equal show with
his opponents.
Thomas Flint Jr. of San Benlto Is at the
Palace. He said last night that there had
been no change so far as his prospects
were concerned. No defections had been
reported to him. He was satisfied with
the campaign and the outlook.
Diligent inquiry falls to show that any
candidate has expressed a preference for
presiding officer of the convention. San
Joaquin County will cast its nineteen
Votes for Levynsky for chairman.
No campaign in the history of the Re
publloan party of California had the pe
culiar phases attending thfÂ» contest. In
the first place, there has not so far been
any attempt to arrange a slate. The bosa
element seems to be entirely obliterated
and every aspirant for a position on the
ticket is personally conducting his own
fight. The usual method is for a candidate
to announce his willingness to accept a
place on the ticket ana tnen leave the
â work of getting there to some astute po
litical manager.
For the first time in many years the
Ban Francisco delegation is an unknown
quantity. ThÂ«? Republicans of this city
apparently hnve no desire to name any
man on the State ticket. This is not ln

difference on the port of our Republican
citizens, either, which was evidenced by
the large vote polled at the primaries
Thursday. The voters of the party are
satisfied that bossism, so far as the Re
publicans are concerned, is a thing of the
past, and tn<"- are willing to leave the
selection of the candidates to the dele
gates who have been chosen to represent
the party in the State convention. San
Francisco has 186 votes in the convention,
and the several candidates for office are
just now endeavoring to secure pledges
from the individual members of the dele
gation. It has not as yet been decided
whether the delegation will vote as a
unit on the floor of the convention.
The fight for first place on the State
ticket remains unchanged, and in all prob
ability the presnt conditions will con
tinue until the balloting begins. The
Gage forces are confident, and Pardee s
spokesmen declare that their fight is very
bright and that they are satisfied with
the outlook. Delegates and visitors from
the southern part of the State say that
all the counties in that section are solid
for Henry T. Gage, and that he will go
to Sacramento with over 200 pledged
votes.
Dr. Pardee's workers are happy and
cheerful. They declare with great sin
cerity that Gage's cinch on the south is
not a lead pipe, and that the doctor has
already won a number of delegates from
the candidate from the sunland. The
Pardeeites further allege that the fight is
just openinr. and that it will develop into
a battle for supremacy betwen the coun
try delegates and T the Dan Burns ele
ment, which they assert controls this city.
One of Pardee's chief lieutenants said
yesterday that the man who received
Dan Burns' indorsement would be beaten
to death; that the country would not
stand fur another Burns candidate.
The Alamedans believe their alphabeti
cal position on the list of counties gives
them a distinct advantage. They think
the outside delegates will follow them
In the fight against San Francisco and
the south, should such a combination
be formed this week.
So far only two candidates for the po
sition of Lieutenant Governor have ap
peared. They are T. H. Selvage of Hum
boldt and ex-Senator Frank McGowan of
this city, formerly of Humboldt County.
The Humboldt County delegation is sol
id for Selvage, and will, it is said, trade
with the head of the ticket if Selvage is
guaranteed second place. The county
has seventeen delegates, and will vote
as a unit. Senator McGowan depends on
his record in the Legislature to secure
the support of the convention.
Two names are mentioned as candi- ]
dates for Secretary of State, County
Clerk Charles F. Curry and Paul P. Aus- j
tin of San Jose. Curry depends on the j
San Francisco delegation to get there, |
and Austin, who is one of Jim Rea's
men, will look to his boss to pull him
through.
For Controller E. P. Colgan, incumbent, |
will have no opposition.
Truman Reeves of San Bernardino and j
Robert Nixon of Yreka are the only can- j
didates in the field for State Treasurer, j
There are two applicants for the At- j
tomey-General's billet. They are Tirey
L. Ford, the well-known attorney of this
city, and W. R. Guy of San Diego. Like
nil the other contests it is an even break
for the two candidates.
Surveyor-General M. J. Wright is as
sured of a renomination by the Repub
licans without opposition.
For Clerk of the Supreme Court there
are several candidates. They are: G. W.
Root, chief wharfinger, of this city; E.
I. Sheehan, Louis H. Jacobs, ex-Deputy
County Treasurer of this city; W. H.
Reynolds, Deputy County Clerk, San
Francisco, and T. H. Ward, who now
holds the position.
The nomination for Superintendent of
Puollc Instruction is sought by S. T.
Black, incumbent, and J. T. Kirk, Super
intendent of Schools in Fresno County.
A. J. Johnson will have no opposition for
a nnomination as State Printer.
Next to the nomination for Governor,
the liveliest fight for a place is among the
candidates for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court Able jurists from all sec
tions of the State aspire to the honor of
holding a seat in the highest tribunal of
the commonwealth. Those who have an
nounced their candidacies art-: Justices
T B M'^Farland and W. C. Van Fleet (in
cumbents), Superior Judge F. M. Angel- ;
lotti of Marin County, Judge B. T. Wil- I

Judge A. J. Buckles of Solano, i
i John C. Gray of Butte, Judge W. H. Clark j

has an advantage. In the Fifth District
State Senator E. I. Wolfe Is after the
nomination, but Congressman E. F. Loud
desires to return to Washington, and ho
will give Wolfe a hard fight.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee headquarters, which will be located in
the Golden Eagle Hotel, at Sacramento,
will be open Monday morning. All the
preliminary work for the convention has
been done, the rollcall will be complete
and printed In time for the opening ses
sion Tuesday morning; there will be no
delay in organizing and disposing of the
work for which the delegates were elect
ed. The convention will hÂ£ the largest In
the history of the party. Unusual inter
est is manifested by Republicans from
every section, and the number of callers
at the headquarters In the Palace far ex
ceeds any previous campaign.
C< invention arrangements are all com
pleted. The committee in charge of the
pavilion at Sacramento will see that
every comfort is provided for the dele
gates. The decorations whtcn were put
up for the Democrats are to be changed,
but the arrangement of the seats will not
be disturbed. Frank D. Ryan of Sacra
mento has charge of the convention pre
â liminaries, and he reports everything in
readings for the delegates. Ryan will be
the secretary of the convention, and John
Stafford will be eergeant-at-armn.

BIGGY PBEPABED TO FIGHT.
Will Not Allow the Election Commis

Office Work.
The clash between Registrar Biggy and
the Board of Election Commissioners was
j the principal topic of conversation around
j the city buildings yesterday. A number
I of men who claim to have some political
| influence and who are out of employment
I called on various members of the board
and solicited jobs as canvassers to purge
the registration books. The fact that
I Biggy had declared that he would not
! have any appointees of the board to act
j as purgers apparently had no effect in
! dampening the ardor of these office seek
| ers. It was currently rumored that the
j Commissioners would find temporary
places for about firty men. The Commis
sioners themselvesâ that is, the' ones ar
rayed against Biggy did nothing to con
tradict the rumor. Instead, they helped
it along. At> for Biggy, he was closeted
most of the day, hunting up law to sus
tain his position against the Commis
i sioners.
"If the board goes ahead next Monday

points men to make the canvass of the
city to purge the register, I shall refuse
to "recognize them. They can do nothing,
as I will furnish no data upon which they

not be surrendered to the board."
Silver Republicans.
The administration committee of the
Silver Republican party has abandoned
the idea of holding a reception at the Cal
ifornia Hotel this evening, as planned at
Sacramento earlier in the week. The
change of plan was deemed advisable on
account of the protracted convention ai
Sacramento, which made it necessar- for
a majority of the members of the com
mittee to hasten to Los Afigeles to com
plete arrangements for the holding of the
Silver Republican State convention to be
held in Los Angeles Saturday. August 27.
Judge Maguire will address the conven
tion and will be entertained during his
visit in Los Angeles by the Silver Repub
lican Club of that city.
Local Candidates.
John R. Daniels, a young attorney of
this city, will be a candidate for mem
ber of the Assembly *â<m the Forty-sec
ond District on the Republican ticket.
iM., V. Coffey of the Citizens' Republican
committee expects to receive the Republi
can nomination for Senator from the
Nineteenth District. J. J. McCarthy is a
candidate for the Assembly from the
Forty-second.
Supervisor Smith is announced as a can
di. ]:<te for Sheriff on the Republican
ticket Ed Head is also after the job.
Dr. Lustig and Dr. J. P. Conran art- said
to be aspirants to succeed Dr. Hawkins
as Coroner.
SILVER MEN OF NEVADA.
All Eager for Office and a Hot Con
vention Is Promised.
RENO, New, Aup. 19.â The Silver party
convention of Nevada that meets on Sep
tember 9 at Reno promises to be a red
hot gathering from start to finish. From
present indications Newlands will have
no opposition for Congress, although
there are several statesmen who think
they could fill his place. Governor Sad
ler is a candidate to succeed himself and
his announced competitors are Lem Al
len of Churchill County and Evan "Wil
liams of Ormsby County. While Allen
Is a good second, knowing ones believe
that Sadler holds the top hand for the
nomination. His entertainment of "Pup"
Corbett and Fitzsimmons and the riff
raff that followed them here two years
ago will count against him at the polls
in November, and it is said by many that
if the Republicans nominate a good man
Sadler will be easy to defeat.
Senator Stewart Is swinging round
the circle, fixing up his fences and work
ing as if he expected a bakers' dozen of
candidates to present themselves, but is
breathing somewhat easier since New
lands got out of his way.
It is thought by a good many knowing
ones that A. C. Cleveland of White Pine
County is in training for Senatorial hon
ors while others say his name will be
placed before the Silver convention for
Governor and that he will distance all
comers. At all events, the party bosses
are anticipating a hot time at the con
vention. . . ._ . _
Silver primaries are to be held at was
hoe and other western counties to-mor
row. There will be at least three sets of
delegates run in this county.
BLOODSHED FEARED AT PANA.
Operators Threaten to Import Col
ored Non-Union MineTS.
PANA, 111.. Aug. 19.â Sheriff Coburn ar
rived from Taylorsville to-day and posted
all over the city the criminal code regard
ing the assembling of miners, intimida
tion etc He also swore in a large force
of extra deputy Sheriffs to guard the
negro laborers, who will be brought here
from the South on Sunday, It Is said, and
nut to work at the Sprlngside mine Mon
day Many deputies have, however, re
fused to serve, and the Sheriff will likely
have to go out of the city to secure
enough force. In case of the importation
of non-union miners, the city, it is said,
will be flooded with miners from the Dan
ville and Springfield districts, and the
citizens fear that bloodshed and death can
hardly be averted. The situation bears
the most serious aspect of any la Pana
mining history.

Trouble Ahead for the

THE LOS ANGELES CONTINGENT
AND ITS SPOIL.
Convention Aftermath That Is the
Straw Indicating the Direction
of Coming Political
Breezes.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 19.â The last of the dele
gates to the Democratic State conven
tion have shaken the dust of Sacra
mento from their feet. Many of then
left this morning, but a few reinaine
as late as 5 o'clock this afternooi
Among these were James G. Maguirt.
the Democratic nominee for Governoi
United States Senator Stephen M
White, William H. Alford and som
who may be referred to as lesser lights
of the late galaxy of Democratic stars.
Almost tho sole topic of conversation
among the departing delegates is the
circumstances connected with the lu
tile attempt of the Examiner, aided by
Gavin McNab and Mayor Pheian, to
Ie Judge James V. Coffey on the
â ention as the nominee for Asso
; Justice of the Supreme Court. In
g so the combination attempted to
at Judge William M. Conley of Ma
dera by methods that were so disrep
utable as to call forth the most sever
criticism. The part taken by the Lo
Angeles and San Francisco delegation
in the disreputable proceeding is con
Bldered particularly worthy of cou
demnation. The Los Angeles men, com
posed largely of railroad politicians an
corporation dummies, came to the con
vention under an agreement to vote a
a unit on all propositions. The delega
tion was composed of eighty-one mem
bers it caucused eighty-one times
made eighty-one personal enemies an
went home this morning with spoi
consisting of one Populist nominee Vt
Lieutenant Governor, one bilver *.c
publican nominee for Attorney Genera
and one Populist nominee for Railroa
limissioner. Considering the tat
these men had already been norn
id, as long ago as the middle (
r, by the Pinto-Populist conventio
er the fusion agreement it seem
lly necessary to press the Iron
jer into the souls of the unified del
:es from the southern metropolis.
this was the sum of the misdoings
of the Los Angeles delegation its mem
bers would no doubt be comparatively
happy. As it is, they are trying to find
means of explaining away a long 1 st
of broken promises and obligations dis
regarded, to say nothing of their ac
pure Reformers who do the bidding of
the Examiner's political bureau. To be
gin with they entered into a solem
obligation to vote for Judere Hughe
of San Diego for Associate Justice o
the Supreme Court, first, last and a
the time. With this in mind they en
tered into an agreement with Gavi
McNab, Mayor Pheian and the Ex
aminer, the understanding being tha
the delegation would vote to seat th
McNab delegation as against the Ha
ney delegation, providing the McNa
delegation would vote for the nomina
tion of Judge Hughes. The Los An
geles delegation carried out their pa
of the agreement, but the San Francis
co crowd, acting under orders from i
bosses, declined to have anything t
do with Judge Hughes. The railroa
push from the south then held som
more caucuses and decided to thro
Hughes overboard and plump for Co
fey. This decision was not arrived a
until almost every member of the de
egation had been buttonholed by th
Examiner bosses and some of th
more conscientious members influ
enced by the insinuation that the rai
road was trying to secure the nomina
tion for Judge Conley.
It so happened, fortunately for th
reputation of the convention, that th
raw work of Mayor Pheian, McNa
and the others made apparent the kin
of job they were engaged in workin
and the result was that tho country
delegation and secured the
nomination for Conley by an over
whelming majority. One incident that
is receiving a great deal of condem
nation to-day was the action of Mayor
Pheian in announcing, on the last roll
call, the vote of the San Francisco del
egation as being 153 for Coffey and 1
for Conley. Eleven members of the
delegation jumped to their feet and
announced that their votes were for
Conley and not for Coffey. The inci
dent is looked upon as one of the most
disgraceful acts of the whole disgrace
ful proceeding.
Another circumstance that has
created a great amount of unfavorable
comment to-day was the attempt on
the part of the Examiner to deceive the
public in the matter of the nominee for
member on the State Board of Equal
ization for the Third District. The
Third District convention met here yes
terday and nominated Richard H. Bea
mer of Woodland by acclamation, con
trary to the wishes of the Examiner
politicians. This morning the paper
publishes what purports to be a list of
the nominees of the convention, and
for the Third Equalization District
gives the name of George Thresher of
Butte as the nominee. Thresher was
the fusion nominee for the position, but
was repudiated by the district conven
tion. The Democrats of the district are
indignant, and others from all parts
of the State, among them being many
who allowed themselves to be made
tools of the Examiner politicians, de
clare that such a bare-faceÂ«l attempt
to deceive the public was uncalled for
and unwise. On top of all this the paper
has declared in flaring headlines that
all of the men who were nominated
contrary to the wishes of the Examiner
secured their nominations by reason of
the influence of the Southern Pacific
Company. As it is true that the same
men who nominated Ma?uire for Gov
ernor also nominated the others who
are so obnoxious to the Examiner, then
it must be also true that Maguire was
nominated by reason of railroad in-
fluence.
From what was to be seen and heard
here to-day and durine the closing
hours of the convention, there is every
pood reason to believe that explanations
will be the order of the day for some
time to come. The few delegates who
have nothinp to explain will no doubt
await with interest the news of the ar
rival home of the Los Anpeles delega
tion laden with the spoils of its eighty
one caucuses.
Sonoma Populists Indorse Maguire.
SANTA ROSA. Aug. 19.â T0-day the So
noma County Populist Convention was
held here. Maguire was indorsed, also
the Democratic selections for the other
offices. No counts ticket was nominated.

." Votes to Start
With. \
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 19.â Paul T. Austin,
Rea's candidate for Secretary of State,
left this afternoon for Sacramento.
Headquarters will be established in the
Capital Hotel, and he will begin hl3
fight for the place. Boss Rea, John
and Andy Mackenzie and other follow
ers of the gang will go to Sacramento
Monday morning.
Everything will be sacrificed to land
Austin, and the vote of the Santa
Clara delegation will be hawked about
from one gubernatorial candidate to
another. "Jim" Rea says Austin must
get the nomination for Secretary of
State, and he imagines he is sacrific
ing himself In only asking for this
one office. The Rea delegates to the
State convention voted yesterday to
work for Austin for the office. This
will give him 33 votes to start with,
and it is by trading these that Rea
hopes to make a respectable showing
for his man.
Austin has been very successful in
politics but outside of the gang is not
very popular. It is doubtful whether
he can carry Santa Clara County. At
present he is manager of the Security
Savings Rank and a member of the
Board^ of Supervisors. Austin was
also Mayor of the city at one time.
He is a devout gang man and has al
ways done Rea's bidding. Before he
entered upon his political career Aus
tin was in the real estate business. In
this jie was a failure, as $30,000 worth
of unsatisfied judgments in the Re
corder's office will show.
The contesting delegation from the
Good Government League are especial
ly active now and will also go to Sac
ramento early in the week.
The Silver Republicans of Santa
Clara County have named the follow
ing delegates to the State convention
of that party, to be held at Los An
geles August 27: William P. Squire
(at large). Captain W. M. Morse, Dr.
G F Nevtns D. C. Bailey, John Brit
ton Dr. G. J. Fowler. H. T. Wallace,

CRY OF FRAUD AT FRESNO.
Democrats and Populists Excited
Over the Registration.
FRESNO, Aug. 19.â William Guard and
G. P. Cummings of the Democratic and
Populist fusion committee appointed to
examine registration, to-day made a de
mand upon County Clerk Truman G. Hart
to be allowed to see the affidavits of
registration in order to investigate the
registration. This was refused by the
Clerk as the papers hrul not been assort
ed and the Clerk claimed that the law
required him to assort them into precinct
packages first.
The Democrats and Ponulists are very
much excited over the matter and threat
ened to bring mandamus proceedings
against the Clerk. The Kepubltcanftfalso
desired to examine the registration cer
tificates, but they submitted to the rul
ing of the Clerk, which they regard as
proper. Each party had registration
clerks appointed by the Clerk, and there
are open charges made on both sides of
fraud in registration done by these clerks.

England Places Unlimited Contracts
in This Country.
NORFOLK, i Aug. 19.â here has been
shipped from Norfolk. In British bot
toms, seventeen cargoes of Pocahontas
coal, aggregating 70,120 tons. They have
gone to eleven different coaling! stations
belonging to England, and it has been
believed that England was stocking coal
stations in the event of possible war.
To-day it leaked out that this view la
undoubtedly correct, as the Pocahontas
Coal Company is asserted by one of its
employes to have practically admitted
that an unlimited contract from the
British Government for coaling her sta
tions all over the world has been secured,
and the work hns just fairly commenced.
The stations to which cargoes have thus
far been Bent are: Montevideo, in Uru

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 19.
The Republican County Central Com
mittee held an important meeting this
evening. The returns from the Con
gressional primary were canvassed,
and the four disputed votes in the Fif
tieth District were allowed to Hllborn.
This, of course, in no way affects the
larpe majority for Metcalf.
It was decided to hold the county
primaries on September 17 and the
convention on September 19. The place
of holding the county convention will
be determined at a future meeting.
A discussion arose as to whether the
primaries should be held by Assembly
districts or by wards and townships,
and the sentiment seemed to be in
favor of the latter. The question is one
of great interest, as it materially af
fects the chances of certain candidates
for office. The State and Congressional
primaries were held by Assembly dis
tricts, but it will be far more difficult
to forecast results in a county conven
tion of Assembly districts, and it is
very probable that the ward and town
ship plan will be ordered. The matter
svill be settled at a meeting of the
committee to be held September 3.
The Young Men's Republican League
held a big rally to-night to ratify the
success at the primaries of Dr. Pardee
and Victor H. Metcalf. Speeches were
made by Mayor Thomas, Hon. John A.
Britton, Dr. Mehrmann, A. C. Henry,
Professor L,. G. Inskeep, Professor
George C. Edwards, P. M. Fisher and
others.
The chief business of the meeting was
that of insuring a large attendance of
active workers at Sacramento next
Monday and Tuesday to help along the
cause of Dr. Pardee. Many prominent
citizens pledged their presence and sup
port at the capital, and it was decided
to send twenty-five members of the
league and to pay their transportation
from its treasury. It is expected that
a delegation of odo will leave this coun
ty on Sunday and Monday for Sacra
mento.
POSED IN CHINA AS AN
ENVOY OF GERMANY
Berlin Correspondent Charged With
Liberating Thirteen Murderers
of German Missionaries.
BERLIN, Aug. 19.â Hprr Eugene S.
Wolff, the well-known German explorer,
who has just returned from China, where
he acted as correspondent of the Tage
blatt. ia being prosecuted upon a charge
of having, without authority, assumed
the role of Judge, and with having liber
ated thirteen Chinese murderers of Ger
man missionaries.
According to the evidence of Bishop
Anzer, on which the accusation is based,
Herr Wolff, having heard of the trial, ap
peared in court with a dog named Schus
ter. Four vacant chairs stood in the
hall in which the trial was to be held.
Wolff seated himself In the most Im
posing of the?;.-, caving:: "I'll take the
highest, and you, Herr Schuster (address
ing the dogp will take the second highest
to my right."
ThÂ»n he ordered the rlerk of the court
into the next chair on his right, and lastly
with a gesture bade the wondering man
darin to take the fourth and lowest chair.
The mandarin questioned Wolff's au
thority, whereupon the latter draw a roll
of papers from his pocket and flourished
It as his authority, and the prisoners be
ing introduced and declaring their inno
cence Herr Wolff solemnly acquitted
them and declared the proceedings ended.
He then saddled his horse and departed.
The story caused the utmost astonish
ment. Bishop Anzer was In Germany at
the time of the alleged occurrence, con
sulting the Government In regard to the
murders, which ultimately led to the oc
cupation of Klaochou, and only learned
of what had happened on returning to
China. It appears that Herr Wolff often
posed in China as German Envoy.

Chief Officer Jago of the same ship was
; arrested at Queen Mown several days ago
on the same charge. The new complaint
was made by A. Percy Bennett, the act-
Ing British Consul General In New York
! It charges Kynaston with the larceny of
i $tisoo in railroad bonds and of $1500 in cash
from nn envelope addressed to Heidel
haeh, Ickelheimer & Co., bankers of this
i city.
Evidence was given by the employes
of the bankers to prove the mailing of
the $1500 from Antwerp and by PostofÃce
Inspector Jacobs to show that it was ta
ken from the envelope on the steamship.
Jacobs exhibited the ship's manifest in
; evidence. When the envelope reached
the bankers it was stuffed with a Lon
i don newspaper published two days after
the envelope left Antwerp. The news
paper was substitucd to give the envel
ope the same appearance It had when
filled with paper money.
District Attorney Rice of Jersey v^ity
! has been notified from Washington that
a charge against Kynaston would be
made by the British Consul. The United
States authorities consider it a case for
extradition. A hearing will be given the
accused on September 8.

RUSS WATERS'
DOMAIN HAS
BEEN INVADED
A New Candidate in
the Sixth.
FRANK DAVIS IN THE FIELD
A GIANT AMONG LAWYERS OF
LOS ANGELES.
Gage and Waters Considered Run
ning Mates and It Is Thought
the New Richmond May
Break Their Slate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 19.â The path
way of Russell J. Waters, the Repub
lican candidate for Congress in the
Sixth District, has lost Its roseate hue
and the serenity of the lone traveler
has been disturbed by the invasion of
a "new Richmond" In the person of
Frank Davis, the well-known attorney
of this city. Davis has been an ac
tive and popular Republican here for
many years, and it is admitted by all
that he will be a formidable candidate
against Waters in the convention, and
that he will be able to break the slate
which has been made in the interest of
Henry T. Gage, candidate for Gover
nor, and Waters for Congress. Should
he succeed In receiving the nomination
at Sacramento next Tuesday, the time
fixed for holding the Congressional
Convention, it may seriously compli
cate the fight for Governor, and so ma
terially change the programme already
prepared for the benefit of the dele
gation from this county.
Davis Is recognized as being a giant
among the members of the bar, an elo
quent speaker and a man of great per
sonality and entirely free from alli
ance with any faction. It is claimed
for him that his canvass would be un
assailable and would bring out the full
strength of the party. A strong effort
is, however, being made to have him
withdraw from the fight, and it is
hoped by the friends of Mr. Waters
that he will reconsider the matter.
But Davis is said to be a hard man
to pull down, and It is intimated that
should he fail to go before the conven
tion he may conclude to run as an in
dependent candidate. His friends will
do all in their power to dissuade him
from pursuing such a course. They de
sire that he go before the delegation
and make his fight on his merits, be
lieving that he can win out.
The friends of Russell J. Waters,
however, are confident that he will be
nominated, and while they acknowledge
the great popularity of Mr. Davis they
feel that he cannot overcome the work
already done by their candidate in the
way of securing the promises of a ma
jority of the delegates to the Congres
sional Convention, and it would seem
that In view of the fact that Gage and
Waters are considered running mates
by the delegates from this county the
claim has some merit. The result will
be watched with great interest by the
friends of both parties, who in the
meantime are working zealously for
their respective candidates.
Waters left this morning for San
Francisco and will be at the Palace
Hotel, where it is Intimated he will con
fer with Henry T. Gage regarding the
changed aspect of the situation, which
may turn out to be of vltai importance
to the candidacy of both Gage and
Waters. So far as the people of this
city are concerned they have but little
preference, if any, between the two
candidates. Both are closely identified
with the interests of the district and it
Is merely a difference of popularity
which seems to be In favor of the val
iant Davis.
News was received here this after
noon to the effect that James G. Ma
guire has consented to address the dele
gates of the State Silver Republican
Convention to be held here August 27,
and the occasion is to be made a great
demonstration, in which every party
that has helped to make the spotted
candidate will participate.
SLAUGHTER OF REBELS

respondent of the Times say*: The

HERO OF CLIPFERTON ISLAND.
Substituted the American Flag for
That of Mexico.
SAN DIEGO. Aug. 19.â The steamer
Alice Blanchard, Captain Broderick
Warner, arlved to-day from Cllpperton
Island, after a passage of eleven days,
with 550 tons of phosphate rock. The
Blanchard brings as passengers Nolan
Baldwin, aped 15, a son of Barry Baldwin,
formerly United States Marshal at San
Francisco and Theodore Gusmann, who
has been on the desolate island for nearly
thirteen months.
Mr. Gusmann figured in a somewhat
heroic light on Clipperton a few months
ago when he refused to haul down the
American flag when ordered to do so by
the Mexican man-of-war Democrata. The
crew of the Mexican ship raised their flag
over the island in place of the stars and
stripes, but was taken down as soon as
they left Mr. Gusmann says that since
that time the United States flag has been
flyinf over the island.^

WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â Postmaster

HILBORN WILL
NOT GO BEFORE
THE CONVENTION
Neither Will He Run
as an Independent.
WILL NOMINATE TO-MORROW
NUSBAUMER TO PRESENT THE
NAME OF METCALF.
As a Matter of Courtesy Four of the
Delegates From the Fiftieth
Are From the Hilborn
Ticket.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 19.
Mr. Hllborn does not intend that his
name shau be presented to the Third Dis
trict Congressional convention, which
meets to-morrow in Germanla Hall. It is
possible that some of the delegations
from the small counties in the district,
which are solid for him, may insist on
placing the Congressman In nomination,
but if they do so it will be in direct op
position to the wishes of Mr. Hilborn
] and his Oakland manager.
There has been some talk regarding the
possibility of Mr. Hilborn making an in
dependent campaign, and it has been said
1 that his reason for not permitting his
| name to go before to-morrow's conven
j tion is to keep the way clear for an inde
pendent move, as under the purity or
I elections law he could not run independ
ent after being turned down in a con
"Thei'e is not a particle of foundation
for all this 'independent' talk," saiu W.
H Friend, chairman of the Congressional
I committee, to-day. "Mr. Htlborn has no
idea of doing any such thing, and the
story was started uy some of his over
zeaious but not very diplomatic friends.
I Mr. Hilborn is taking his defeat phi o
i sophically and boars nobou" any ill win,
| while all" the Reputmcans who were mak
i ing his fight are now in line for Mr. Met
1 calf." , Â, ,
The Congressional convention will be
devoid of any special interest. Its busi
ness will consist of electing a Congress
i man, framing a platform, passing a few
I resolutions and electing a new Congres
sional committee. The whole business
will probably not occupy a couple of
hours. .
Judge Emil Nusbaumer, who has been
the leading factor in Mr. Metcalf's cam
i paign. will place that gentleman's name
j before tho convention, and with the
Judge's well known oratorical powers
there is no doubt that nis speech will be
powerful and to the point. It will prob
! ably be seconded by one delegate from
I every county in the district, and will, of
: course, be made unanimous.
The little difficulty in the Fiftieth As
1 sembly District has been straightened
! out to the satisfaction of both parties,
' four of the delegates that were on the
â  Hilborn ticket and six who were on the
! Metcalf ticket having been acknowledged
| as the successful ones.
DEFINITE BASE FOR

HAVANA, Aug. 19.â The Government
has appointed a Spanish commission to
' consider a definite base for a treaty of
; peace. The personnel of the commis
sion, however, is not announced. It Is
reported that the questions to be dis
cussed are as follows:

termination of conditions and Indemni
fication by the United States against
damage to public buildings, courts and
the state's lands.
2. Indemnity for war and navy ma
! terlal mutually agreed on to come into
possession of the United States.
3. Conditions of, and time for, the
| evacuation by the troops and volun
teers with the war material agreed on.
4. Commercial and custom-house ad
vantages to be conceded.
5. The recognition of property of all
kinds of all Spanish citizens and guar
antees to be offered them during their
stay In the island.
6. The form of government to be es
tablished in Cuba.
SAN JOSE ATHLETIC
CLUB OPENING
SAN JOSE, Aug. 19.â Ed Hennessey and
Joe Reay, welter-weights, furnished the
main sport at the opening of the San
Jose Athletic Club to-night. No pools
were sold. It was a ten-round fight, and
though Reay clearly outpointed Hennes
sey, the referee, Louis Hobbs, declared
it "a draw. There were no knock-downs,
but a good many stiff punches and clever
dmlges. The preliminaries consisted of a
four-round go between Frank Purcell and
Jimmy Ryan, welter-weights, and a
thr.e-round contest between Jack Mc-
Mnnus and Charles Johnson, light
weights. Decision, a draw in each event.
The attendance was about 500.

THE IRISH FAIR.
WITH the opening of the Irish fair this evening
there will be begun for our people and for visi
tors to the city a series of entertainments of
more than ordinary beauty, brilliancy and pleasure.
No people better understand the art of enjoying life
than the Irish; none are more genial with friends or
more hospitable to strangers that come with friendly
purposes. It is therefore well assured that all who
attend the fair will receive a cordial welcome and find
themselves in a joyous company.
The object of the fair is to raise money for a fund
designed ior the construction of a stately edifice to
be used as a common home for the various Irish so
cieties of the city and to be known as Celtic Hall. It
is therefore orje which appeals not only to persons of
Irish birth or ancestry, but to all citizens who have
sufficient civic pride to feel an interest in its archi
tectural embellishment and the promotion of its social
organizations.
The United States as a nation and every State and
city in her wide domain owe much to the Irish race.
Nine men of that race were among the signers of the
Declaration of Independence, and from that time to
the present day Irishmen have been conspicuous in
every field of American endeavor, whether in peace
or war. They have been important factors in every
advance made in our industrial development, and
wherever under our battle flag the fortune of war has
demanded a sacrifice or granted a triumph they have
been conspicuous for courage and patriotism.
It is particularly pertinent now to recall that among
the salient characteristics of the Irish race is that of
generosity. Every movement of a public nature un
dertaken in the United States has been liberally aided
by the Irish residents of the community where it was
carried forward. They have contributed freely to the
<nterpri?es of other social and benevolent organiza
tions, and it is but just they should receive the re
ward of their friendly helpfulness.
Reciprocity is always commendable, and in this in
stance those who now return the past favors received
from their Irish friends, by giving a liberal patronage
to the fair, will find reward not only in the satisfaction
of aiding a good cause, but in the delight of doing
so under circumstances of social enjoyment perfected
by every accessory of music, mirth and beauty.
POLITICAL NEWS WITHOUT BIOS.
IZZJOREMOST among the purposes of this paper
is that of publishing the news, setting it forth
* correctly, with no coloring of prejudice. At
present political news is prominent, and to the prac
tical exclusion of ordinary topics interest centers
about the action of the several parties. This action
will be fully described to the end of the campaign just
as it has up to the close of the Democratic conven
tion.
The Call will support the Republican ticket, do all
in its power to elect it, and has from the first made
its position known. But being a newspaper it will
tell whatever may happen. Its reports of the Demo
cratic convention were the fullest and by far the best.
This is a simple matter of record, easy to verify by
a glance at the files of all the city papers. Many con
gratulations have been received from people of all
political faiths expressing pleasure that they are able
to read the report of a convention and find it exhaus
sive, correct and fair, an exposition of what actually
happened, unaccompanied by any effort to make
black appear white.
Tuesday the Republicans- meet at Sacramento to
nominate a ticket which will, except for some con
tingency not discernible now, be elected. All the
State wants to know without delay what that conven
tion does. It is the province of the newspapers to
give the information, and The Call is a newspaper.
There will be daily complete and reliable details
sent by a corps of practical men who, while not "spe
cial commissioners." know what news is, where to
get it and how to present it to the people.
A captain of Ohio volunteers is to be court
martialed for cowardice, and serve him right. No
soldier has any excuse for being the sort of coward
who runs away. He can get scared, probably will,
and perhaps under the impulse of fright fight so as
to win mention for bravery. A man who is made of
such stuff that he will take to his legs at a critical
moment ought to know it in advance and avoid the
moment.
For McNab to decline the nomination from the
Fourth was a generous act. Fancy how the Fourth
would have felt with a McNab representing it at
Washington. McNab would have been defeated, un
less for the intervention of a miracle, and miracles
are scarce, but somebody might have found out that
he was running and have had a laugh on the Fourth.
Without the slightest asperity toward Cassin we
venture the prediction that his career as a convention
chairman is at an end.
If the south fail to get everything in sight it will not
be ior lack of the willingness to reach for it
LONG AS THE IMMORAL LAW.
THE Democratic platform is great in its length.
For the rest of its quality it may be said to be a
curiosity.
It begins by affirming its "adherence to the time
honored principles of Democracy enunciated by
Thomas Jefferson and grandly upheld by his Demo
cratic successors."
Then the instrument proceeds to demand the free
and unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to I.
Jefferson said the ratio of the two metals is a com
mercial problem entirely and cannot be controlled by
statute, and Jackson said that gold is the universal
and only honest standard of value. The platform says
that "While we do not favor an aggressive policy of
territorial expansion we are opposed to the surrender
to Spain of any of the territory that has been acquired
by American valor and the expenditure of the blood
and treasure of our people." If territory acquired by
war is not territory taken by aggression, then war
has ceased to be an aggressive business. This is a
plain and unequivocal indorsement of imperial expan
sion. Jefferson said that we might acquire Cuba
safely, for no addition to our navy would be needed
to hold it, and that herein should be the rule limiting
our expansion; that we should acquire no soil requir
ing an aditional navy to defend it: more adherence
to the time-honored principles of Jefferson.
The platform demands that the Government bid in,
hold and operate the Central Pacific road. Jefferson
believed that the Government had no business to be
in business, and that when it reached the limit of its
police powers beyond that the people should be left
free in the exercise of their business and industrial
talents.
The principle of representative government is dis
carded and direct legislation by popular vote is de
manded, in the form of the referendum and mandate,
without any provision for the rationalizing of such
direct legislation by the judicial branch of the Gov
ernment. Jefferson said in his first inaugural that the
will of the majority to be right must be reasonable,
and to rationalize that will the judicial branch of the
Government was organized by the constitution. He
also said in the Declaration of Independence that
man has certain inalienable rights, meaning those
beyond the jurisdiction of a majority. This platform
sweeps all such rights away and lays every personal
and property right of man open to the attack of a
popular majority, and then denies to the courts the
authority to judicially protect such rights when so
attacked!
The courts are mentioned only to defame and treat
them as public enemies. The right of a court to pro
tect private property by injunction is denied, and the
demand of the Chicago platform in that matter is in
dorsed. To deny the defense of property rights by
injunction is equivalent to denial of the defense of
personal rights by habeas corpus. ' The writs are
twins in law. If one fall no argument remains for the
preservation of the other.
The platform, having denied the authority of the
courts to protect property, demands the adoption of
the constitutional amendment giving to counties and
municipalities the right to adopt such system of taxa
tion as a majority of their people may elect to have.
This amendment is the stalking horse of Judge
Maguire's single tax. The theory of the single tax
is the denial of the right of private ownership of land.
This local option in taxation is intended to put it in the
hands of a majority to vote every man's land away
from him. It is an invitation to those who have not
had the thrift to acquire land to take it by force from
those who have. It is a policy which leaves all other
forms of property, money, credits, manufacturing
plants, bonds, stocks and mortgages free from tax,
and compels the land to bear the whole public burden.
The foregoing are the platform declarations upon
issues of government and public policy. The rest of
its length is devoted to vote-begging propositions of
every conceivable kind.
One of these is worthy of analysis. In proposing a
rule for fixing freights and fares the instrument de
mands that these shall be adjusted "upon the actual
value of the railroad, measured by the cost of re
producing it at any given time at which, the rates are
to be fixed." Railroads pay their debts out of their
income. They are constructed by the sale of bonds.
These have to be paid as a fixed charge out of the
freights and fares received. If a railroad and its
equipment cost $20,000 a mile and before the maturity
of its bonds can be duplicated for $10,000 a mile, its
income, according to this platform, must be reduced
to a $10,000 a mile basis, and out of this it must pay
its $20,000 a mile debt. It will be observed, too, that
the platform does not propose to tax a railroad on an
assessment equal to the cost of duplicating it. Taxa
tion is to remain on the basis of original cost.
Then with characteristic demagogy the platform
says that liberal wages must be paid by railroads, and
all railroads shall be compelled to pay them!
If we are to have this system of taxation of the
original cost and income on the basis of cost of re
production it will be seen that confiscation is the only
result.
No more capital can be secured to extend the rail
way systems of the State. No member of that con
vention with a dollar to invest would put it into mak
ing needed additions to the transportation system of
California. Therefore it may be fairly charged that
the so-called anti-railroad planks of this remarkable
platform are without value, because they are not con
sistent and neutralize each other. The power to tax
is not authority to confiscate, and the plan of fixing
freights and fares is opposed to the decisions of the j
United States Supreme Court in the Minnesota and
Texas cases, and would be held null and void if at- ,
tempted. Hence as a means of reasonable and proper
public control of railways the platform plan is a snare
and delusion. But this platform is only half of the
platform on which the ticket is running. Judge
Maguire demanded that nothing in it should antago
nize the Populist platform, and the committee of that
party, which notified him that he is its candidate for j
Governor, told him that the Democratic party, since j
the Populist party was organized, had entirely
changed its principles!
So the ticket is riding on both platforms, and,
taken together, they antagonize at every point our
system of government provided by the constitution;
they attack the safeguards of every right of person
and property; they assail the public credit, and pro
pose the destruction of every political institution
founded by the fathers and believed to be necessary
to the happiness and prosperity of our people and the j
perpetuity of the republic.
Spain shows an inclination to balk. She should
remember that the Mayor says it is impossible to
jump half-way down Niagara, and, having taken the
leap, she would better land as gracefully as possible.
It is without desire to intrude upon a neighbor's
grief we mention the fact that the yellow journal is
not running the Popo-Demo two-ringed show. It is
merely one of the exhibits.
When there is a fatal collision on the water front it
is worth while finding out who is to blame. Colli
sions do not occur spontaneously.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 20, 1898.
THE marked characteristic of Judge Maguire has
been the evanescent quality of his political con
victions. He has a keen eye for popular preju
dices and follows them with the energy of a devotee
so long as they lead toward an office. This accounts
for his advocacy of so many antagonistic things. He
must be credited, however, with a steadfast devotion
to the single tax. True, he lays it down or puts it
behind his back when necessary to get an office, but
he always goes fondly back to it, as a little girl does
to her rag doll. By making himself the candidate of
three political parties he has secured ample scope for
the contents of his grab bag of political beliefs, and
is able to appeal to the whole group of popula- preju
dices.
Of principles he has no thoughtful conception. A
creature of impulse, yet even his impulses are safely
bitted and controlled by his constant itch for office,
which torments like an eczema. He has held more
offices and longer than any other public man in Cali
fornia and has accomplished less for the public. His
art has been to foil his inefficiency in securing per
manent results by pointing to what he prevented.
The Examiner gave him the sobriquet of the "Little
Giant," borrowed from Stephen A. Douglas, be
cause of his supposed service in preventing the pass
age of the funding bill. But in the end he let it pass
when uttering two words, "I object," would have
beaten it. So with his whole official history. It is
strewn with words, words, word.s, thicker than
autumn leaves on the creeks of Vallombrosa, and is
as vacant of acts as a stone is of nutriment.
He runs upon a mosaic platform, which attacks
everything that is. Every institution founded on our
constitutional system is antagonized by it. He holds
out to growing manhood the lure of a coming Utopia,
in which every man shall have what he wants by
legislative enactment and without personal exertion.
To him government is the creator of personal for
tune. Law can create value. There is nothing natural
in nature. Everything is artificial. The distinctions
in life and the differences in fortune and fate he de
clares to be artificial, to be changed by more artifice.
His election and the elevation to power of the poli
tical rag and tag and bobtail he represents would be
a calamity to California. His defeat has become a
civic duty. In his speech in Congress on anarchy
and nihilism he distinctly glorified assassination, and
among his supporters are the prominent advocates
of murder as a proper public policy and means of
reform.
The line is drawn by his nomination, not between
parties, but between order and anarchy. Let us see
which will win.
STATISTICS OF REGISTRATION.
IT is to be hoped that the statistics of registration in
this city will not confirm the Republicans in the
idea that this is their "year" and that nothing they
can do will produce defeat. There has been a lulling
off of over 10,000 in the registrations, but a general
effort to create the impression that this in some way
is favorable to the .Republican party because the de
crease is alleged to be heaviest in Democratic dis
tricts is scarcely justifiable and exceedingly danger
ous. It never seems to occur to the authors of this
notion that perhaps the Republicans in these Demo
cratic districts have not registered. With strange
\ fatuity they stick to the idea that because the districts
showing a decrease are Democratic the phenomenon
must be in their favor.
It is certain, however, that no one can explain ex
actly why over 10,000 citizens of San Francisco have
decided this year to refrain from voting. Perhaps
they take no interest in the issues of the campaign;
perhaps they think things will get along without their
interference, and that it is easier to stay at home than
to vote; perhaps the early closing of registration has
caught them napping; perhaps â but perhapses could
be multiplied indefinitely. No one on earth can ex
actly determine why these 10,000 citizens have not
registered without personally interviewing each one
and compiling his reasons.
But why should the Republicans think that this
apathy, or carelessness, or whatever it is, will im
prove their chances of winning the election? That
the decrease is heaviest in the Democratic districts
signifies nothing politically. Four years ago Budd
and Sutro, the Democratic and Populist candidates
for Governor and Mayor respectively, carried many
of the strongest Republican precincts in the city. In
all of them they defeated the Republican candidates
from a party standpoint. Had Estee, for instance,
run as well north as he ran south of Market street,
from a party point of view, he would have been elect
ed. Why, then, talk about a decrease in registration
benefiting anybody?
The truth is, nothing in these days makes party
success certain, except the nomination of strong, in
dependent and active candidates. If all the Demo
crats in San Francisco were to refrain from register
ing and the Republican municipal convention were
to nominate for Mayor a man known to be the tool
of the political bosses and corporations, the party
would be buried under a shower of disapproving bal
lots.
This is the lesson the Republicans must learn if
i they would secure political power and retain it. The
Democrats have thoroughly mastered the proposi
tion. For twenty years they have been generally put
ting their strong and independent men to the front,
and they have won three out of four Governors,
i nearly defeated a fourth and converted San Francisco
I into almost a permanent Democratic town. The poli
tical character of the registration has had nothing to
!do with this. Party lines hang loosely on the people
| nowadays. Conventions and platforms serve to
amuse the politicians and the newspapers, but the
people look at the candidates. They know that the
purest political principles may be subverted by cor
â  rupt officials and that no government can be econo
mical or honest when administered by the patronage
: bosses and the corporations.
To succeed this year the Republican party of both
city and State must look to its candidates and not to
registration, war sentiment, convention "combina
tions" or the favor of corporations and political
bosses.
There is nothing in the rumor that some of the
Harney followers had to walk home from Sacra
mento. Most of them had return tickets, and more
than a few made a successful appeal to the victorious
crowd.
In Alford's nominating speech he alluded to the
present as "the midnight of industrial darkness." The
gentleman takes too gloomy a view. It is getting
along toward morning now.
If Sammy Braunhart believed himself a liar every
time some fellow-delegate tendered,, the information
he was kept busy adding to his store of knowledge.
People who have returned from the warmth of
Sacramento are now reaching for their topcoats and
saying "There's no place like home."

A GOOD
SOLDIER
IN PEACE
"The old fellow had been in the Civfl
"War and was drafted Into the Confed
erate service much against his will, for
his sympathies were at all times with
the North. He made a very poor sol
dier for the rebel side, It is said, and
many times he was on the point of. de
serting, but was restrained from so do
ing by his watchful companions. He
was a listless participator in the few
engagements in which he took part, and
it was really a wonder that he was
never dishonorably discharged.
"However, the war at last came to an
end, and after several years of idleness
John eventually got a minor position in
the custom-house in New Orleans. Act
ing on the principle that he had worked
hard to get the place, John did not feel
it incumbent on him to work any more
after that, and he did as little as he pos
sibly could. He was addicted to the
extremely bad habit, which some Gov
ernment officers possess, of 'soldiering,'
which has come to mean the shirking
or avoidance of legitimate duties. He
was often known to fall fast asleep dur
ing official hours, but his 'pull' kept him
in his place. He finally died in the
harness and his epitaph, to which I have
referred, was as follows:

campaigns which broke the power of the
Carlist leaders, and won for himself the
reputation of being an energetic soldier,
devoted to his profession. He held sev

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
COMMODOREâ A. S., City. The rank
of commodore in the United States navy
was created in 1562. In July of that year
the rank was conferred c"n seventeen offi
cers who were on the retired list and on
eighteen who were on the active list.
You will have to write to the Secretary of
the Navy to ascertain which of the thir
ty-five received the iirst commission.
SANDWICH ISLANDSâ W. C. and oth

not the province of the department of
Answers to Correspondents to advise peo
ple to go into this or that business, to in

try with a view to bettering condition. If
it Is your desire to go to the Sandwich
Islands, now that they have become
American territory, you must take your
chances of becoming prosperous and ad
vancing, just as you would in going to any
other country. If you have energy, ability
and pluck you will probably succeed wher
ever you desire to locate.
TO KILL BLACK ANTSâ R. R., City.
Turpentine squirted by means of a sew
ing machine oiling can into cracks where
the ants assemble will destroy them.
Wormwood leaves scattered about their
haunts will drive them away.
It Is said that houses infected with ants,
red or black, may be disinfected by a lit
tle attention. The remedy suggested is
as follows: "A sponge is the best thing.
Sprinkle It with dry white sugar; the
sponge being slightly moist it will adhere.
The ants will go in large numbers into the
cells of the sponge after the sugar, and
they can be destroyed in boiling water.
The sponge can then be squeezed out,
sugared again find returned to the infect
ed place for another haul and this kept up
until all are caught."
PEANUTSâ W. M. H., San Diego, Cal.
In the culture of peanuts the soil has to
be taken Into consideration. Light gray
soil, without being too sandy, produces
the most marketable crops, the light col
ored nut. The pods partake of the color
of the soil. The nut will not fruit ex
cept in calcareous soil, which must be
light and clean. Planting should be done
as soon as possible after all danger of
frost Is past, in ridges three feet apart
one kernel being put every eight or ten
inches in the ridge. The kernels before
planting are carefully hulled, for if the
skin covering them is broken the chances
are against their growing. The cultiva
tion is such as will keep the soil mellow
and the weeds down. The yield is from
twenty-five to thirty bushels to the acre
POSTOFFICE, TREASURY AND
MINTâ X. W., City. In the Postal De
partment the hours are eiyht for carriers.
For clerks the office hours are generally
eight, but if occasion requires they must
put in as many more hours as tho service
requires. At the Treasury Department
the hours are from 10 a. m. to 3 p.m., ex
cept Saturdays, when the office close? at
1 p. m. The hours at the Mint are from 9
a.m .to 3 p. m.
The salaries at the Mint range from
$2 25 per day to $4500 a year. In the Treas
ury Department the salaries are from $S2O
to $4000 a year: and in the Post office from
$1 a day to $6000 a year. To give the sal
ary list In detail would occupy about a
column of room, and that amount of
space this department cannot devote to
one answer. If you wish to know any
particular salaries this department will
furnish the amount paid.
A TWENTY-DOLLAR PIECEâ F. L.
M., Salmon Falls, Cal. In the coinage of
United States gold coin all geld is made
900 fine, and the value of this is per grain
.03&76. In every twenty-dollar' piece there
are 516 grains of 900 fine gold, so that
the intrinsic value of gold in a double
eagle is $20.00016. In other -tfords, a twen
ty-dollar piece issued from the mints of
the United States contairs, exclusive of
the alloy used to harder the coin, gold
of the value of $20 and a small fraction.
The copper alloy used ttt the purpose of

A SNAKE DEAL.
Mayor Price of Macon has not yet heard
the last of his snake deal. Some time ago
he wanted rain. He advertised for snakes,
secured several at a cost of $S 55, hung
one or more dead ones in a persimmon
tree, and got his rain. He thinks, there
fore, that the deal is complete and that
he is not under any sort of obligation to
anybody, and really it looks that way to
outsiders. Nevertheless, a negro who fur
nish, d the Mayor with the particular
snake which it is alleged brought the
rain thinks otherwise. He is trying to
pose as a public benefactor, and thinks
that in recognition of his services the
Mayor should furnish him with an office.
He has the merit of being easily satisfied,
however, and has said that he would be
content to drive a city cart, if a softer
berth cannot be found for him. Since the
Mayor himself would be entitled to the
office of Municipal Rainmaker, should the
city of Macon set- fit to create such an of
fice, it is not readily apparent what office
Bofber than a city cart could be given the
snake catcher. â Savannah News.
THE LYCEUMS SYNDICATED.
It seems that in the South the syndicate
idea has found its way into the lyceums
which engage lecturers. At present the
lyceums are working independently, and
the result is that those which have not
much capital have to put up with an in
ferior order of lecturers. The Augusta
Chronicle says: "As we understand it,
the total cost of maintaining an organiza
tions for all the lyceums (now about
twenty in number) will not exceed $2500
per year. The total sum expended for
lecture courses by these lyceums last year
was in the neighborhood of $25,000. It i 9
safe to say that about 25 per cent of this
sum could have been saved last year had.
co-operation been effective among the
lyeeums. Every lyceum will grow, and
in a few years will probably be expending
in the neighborhood of $2COO each, which
is now the appropriation of Augusta,"
The lecturers will undoubtedly profit by
the arrangement. The novelists have cer
tainly made money out of the application
of the syndicate system to the sale of
their stories. The lecturer will, of course,
not obtain such large prices fur his work
as he gets now, but he will have many
more engagements, and the labor of travel
will be reduced by the establishment of.
connected routes. The only remarkable
thing about the scheme is that it was not
thought of before.â New York Times.

CONTRACTS BEING VIOLATED
INSUFFICIENT CEMENT AND
DIRTY SAND.
Borne Important Discoveries Have
Been Made by The Call's Ex
pert Investigating the
Work.
â¢ The impunity with which contractors
'disregard specifications in â¢ doing work
' for the City finds a striking illustration
â¢ In the method of repaying Market street,
: now in prog] The City Street Im
â¢ provement Company, which has this con
tract in hand, is daily violating the agree
: ment made with the city under bond, to
' do the work on certain specified lines. So
open and flagrant is the disregard, both
â¢ of the' letter and the spirit of the con
tract, that any citzen with his eyes open
â  cannot fail to ascertain the facts after
â¢ brief personal inspection. The contract
brs are saving on the material and work
â¢ provided for under the contract and the
result will be an inferior pavement on the
Â« .most Important business street in San
Francisco.
'. The Call has had an expert at work for
..' several days, going over the street and
looking into the matter. If the city's in
spector,. Mr. Turner, is carefully super
vising the construction, the fact, so far,
â¢ is not apparent.
The Call proposes to present the facts
â¢ for the benefit of citizens generally, and
â  Incidentally for the enlightenment of the
committee on streets of the .Board of
' Supervisors.
.In order to make a conclusive showing i
. The Call's representative selected a por- j
â¢ tion of Market street lying between New i
Montgomery and Second street. Accord- (
ing to exact measurements there should
. have been laid on 172x17 feet of that block
: 2193 cubic fee', of concrete. A most liberal :
â¢â  interpretation of the specifications would
require the use of seventy-three barrels
of cement, eighty-one cubic yards of rock
â  and twenty-three cubic yards of sand in
laying the section of pavement In ques- j
tion. Â
' Now the actual amount used, according |
to the investigations of The Call's expert, ,
was sixty barrels of cement, sixty-eight i
cubic yards of rock and twenty-four cu
=. bic yards of sand.
The concrete foundation was to be nine
Inches in thickness when finished. The j
. work was however, short fourteen cubic
yards of rock, while thirteen missing bar
' rels of cement are also to be charged up
to the profits of the contractor.
In the mixing of the concrete in some j
instances enough wat( was sprinkled
over the mixture to wash most of the ce
ment into the sub-foundations. At other
...times not enough water was put on to
. ; wet the. cement so that it would adhere to j
â  the rock. :â¢ :
: ' The sand that was used was far from
' clean. It was yellow in color, showing
' the ' presence of clay and loam in large ;
â¢ -.quantities, thereby making it unlit for >
use,- as cement will not adhere to clay or
â¢ loam: A most aggravated case of mis-:
doing consisted in the sprinkling of dry
cement over the surface of the damp con
â¢ crete after it had been lightly tamped
Into place with ten-pound hand tampers.
This made a showing on the surface for
' the benefit of spectators.
"' The specifications provided for the roll
â  Ing. of the sub-foundation with a five-ton
" "rp..er, or where Impracticable to do that,
.".eighty-pound tampers or a hand-roller
â weteto be used. This proviso was disre
â¢ -'garded. If the work had been properly
.â¢ -mlled or tamped, more concrete would
have been needed.
' , The specifications forbid the use of wet
or dry steam, or the application of direct
beat from flames in preparing bitumen
for use on the street. Yet the contractors
did heat the material by injecting wet
: -steam Into It. This practice can be ob
served any day.
Again, the specifications provide that
the. surface coating of bitumen shall, af- j
â  ter proper compression by a roller weigh- |
' ing 250 pounds to the inch run, have a
' uniform thickness of two and one-half
â  Inches, Furthermore, tests are to be con
â¢' tinually made by the Inspector, using a
'-ga'ugo. This official, it is noticed, gauged
the bitumen before it received ultimate
compression. As a result the layer is
- from two to two and one-quarter inches
thick. â¢ Bitumen loses one-fifth by com-
pression.
The fact that the contractors made low
bids of $2S.ftOO all told for the renairing
wo.-k cannot excuse the failure to live up
to the contract.
It is figured that along the entire street
the saving on materials, if carried on
-evenly, in proportion to the saving on the
block investigated, will reach the value of
$5000, which represents a clear profit to
â  which the contractor cannot claim that
â  he is entitled. The worst feature of the
wholo affair is that the Market street
pavement is being constructed in an In
ferior manner and will, when finished,
be but another sample of the bad paving
jobs which have disgraced the city.
PHYLLOXERA DID IT.
gale of the Once Famous Groezinger
Vineyard. *
By a decree of foreclosure entered be
fore Judge Hamm of the Superior Court
of Napa on last Thursday the Groezinper
vineyard, consisting: of 1150 acres of land,
â In which there are 200 acres of grape- !
vines. 250,000 gallons of wine, a winery
125x160 feet, a warehouse 150x105 feet, to
gether with a dwelling-house which cost j
$20,000. was transferred from A. S. Edg
eriy to J. K. Prior of this city for the ;
Bum of $43,000.
â¢The property which fell into the pos
session of Millionaire Prior was acquired
"by him on a loan of $25,000 four years
".ago, the accumulated interest and the
cost of foreclosure making the difference
between this amount and that of $43,
000. This vineyard is one of the first
ever, laid out in the State of California
by an American. In 1860 G. Groezinger
bought several sections of land from
Senor Yount, after whom Yountville is
named, and started the vineyard in the
rich valley of Napa.
Groezinger, who had a thorough knowl
edge of wine-makingv spared no money
In -making his vineyard a success, which
he did. It was bo profitable that at one I
time he refused 5350,000 cash for It. Mis
fortune and phylloxera persecuted him,
and in 1880 he mortgaged the property to
â A. Borel for $90,000. Borel foreclosed in
1831 and sold the vineyard to Edgerly,
â¢â¢who mortgaged it to Millionlaire Prior

RELICS OF DEWEY'S VICTORY.
Interesting Objects From Montijo's Sunken
Ships and the Cavite Forts.
A boxful of curios and relics from the first battle of Manila has been
received by The Call for presentation to the Golden Jate Park Museum.
The donor"of the collection Is George Kittle. 729 Harrison street, ship's
carpenter of the Australia, which arrived in this port from Manila on
Wednesday.
While In port at Manila Kittle entertained himself during shore leave
â wandering about the battered walls of Cavite and picked up numerous in
teresting relics of that first victory of the war. Recognizing their histori
cal value he desires that they may be preserved where they can be exhjb
ited to the public, and asks The Call, In his name, to present them to the
Park Museum.
In the collection there Is a wooden frame that hung In the lookout's
room on Cavite point, and had held a calendar. A ball from one of the
guns of Dewey's fleet carried away the calendar, leaving the frame intact,
and drove a hole through the wall of the building. There is also a stone
out of the wall of the fort, and a portion of the port light of the Reina
Cristina. Mauser bullets, a one-pounder cartridge and a Spanish bayonet
are also in the collection. One of the most interesting relics Is a piece of
window sash containing small hits of a peculiar shell used in the place of
glass. The shells are wafer-like and semi-transparent, round of form and
about three to four inches in ammeter.
There are three Spanish record books bearing dates 1856, 1857 and 1874
respectively, nnd a bunch of official correspondence, with envelopes- wearing
addresses and canceled stamps.
The im-.i bex containing the collection Is alpo a relic, taken from one of
the sunken ships, where it was used for carrying ammunition.
Numerous other relics were brought by members of the ship's crew.
P. N. Man. 766 Bryant street, an electrician on the Australia, has quite a
largo collection, which he als^ will present to the Park Museum. There Is
a steam whistle from the cruiser Don Juan de Austria, a portion of the
gunwaje of the Reina Cristina and a sight from a six-inch gun. A piece
of lace from the uniform of an officer of Admiral Montljo"s staff. Snanish
button 1 ?, coins, an old flintlock gun and bayonets and bullets are among
the collection.
Other interesting relics that came by the same vessel are an officer's
gold-mounted saber and a large volume written in Spanish, which is
said to be the log book of the Reina Cristina' s voyage from Spain to Ma
nila. These were taken from the sunken cruiser by an officer of the Aus
tralia and subsequently came into the hands of Fireman Michael McNally,
who delivered them to John Roily, 613 Bryant street.
HAVE STRUCK
ANOTHER SNAG
Trouble Over Proposed
Restraining Dams.
HALF A MILLION NOT ENOUGH
SLOW PKOGRESS IN STARTING
THE PROJECT.
The Federal Engineers' Investiga
tions Show That the Big Dam
Will Cost a Mint of
Money.
Another snag â and a serious one â has
been struck in the enterprise of building
those restraining dams for which $500,000
was appropriated by the State and Gov
ernment some years ago, and for which
dollars will not more than build the first
definite estimates but stating probabilities
that appear now."
It transpires not only that the half
million available for the work will be
enough for only one dam at best but that
It may be inadequate even for that; and
nothing but planning can be done until
further appropriations are given by Con
gress.
There has never been any definite idea
about how far the $500,000 would go in
dam-building, but it has been vaguely
supposed that two or three could be built
on the Yuba, Feather and Bear Rivers.
The Federal engineers composing the
California Debris Commission have this
season for the first time gone to work on
the investigations on which plans and es
timates can be baaed. From the first the
mnsi important dam has been recognized
to be ihe one for the Yuba River. The
Narrows, above iviarysville, has been rec
ognized as the natural location for it, and
during the summer the work has been
concentrated on this prospective dam. lue
operations have consisted mainly of bor
ings to find the depth to bedrock and the
other conditions of a foundation, and for
some weeks this boring has been carried
on by Herbert Vlscher, a civil engineer
attached to the service, who is now keep
ing a dozen men at work.
A large number of tests have been
made and the fact has just been estab
lished that at every available point the
depth to bedrock is so great that the cost
of the dam -wiil be nearly double what it
would be if the bedrock lay close to the
surface There ifi everywhere a bed of
irravel from fifty to eighty-five feet deep,
-md the foundations of the dam must rise
strongly from the bedrock itself. The re
sult of 'what hits been learned is. accord
ing to Maior Heuer. that the half-million
dollars wUI not more than build the first
dam while there is a possibility that it
will 'not be enough and that nothing can
be done until more money is given.
"We expect now to be able to report
definitely to Congress by December 1 "
said Major Heuer yesterday. "It is likely
that Mr Vischer will be through with his
investigations and make his report within
thirty nays, and then we can furnish defi
nite 'estimates. It appears probable now
that this dam will consume all the appro
priations, and it Is even possible that Con
gress will have to Drovide more money

before we can go ahead. The. depth of
gravel that has been found would make
the foundation more than half the cost
of the dam. The dam should be 160 feet
high to hold the debris of future years
and to sink eighty feet for foundations
tor such a dam would be costly work
You understand that I am not "making
definite estimates but stating probabilities
that appear now."
Major l iouer's statement of probable
cost does not include payment for prop
erty bought <* condemned for the dam
and the great reservoir behind it and
nothing very definite has been figured out
on this score. An electric light and power
company which is eagerly flouring on the
great waterpower the dam Tould provide
hap bought property stretching for four
miles up the river from the dam, and Is
after more. It is understood that this
company would trade this property to the
Government for advantages to itself The
building of tills dam will be a great and
costly engineering feat, and it becomes
doubly interesting through its secondary
feature. It will put a waterfall 150 feet
high in thr- Tuba River but a few biles
from Marysville, and another great elec
tric light power plant is in sight.

THE MILK AND SELTZER "GROWLER."
Anna Held's Lacteal Baths Are Cold Frosts Beside the
New Turn of J, J, Gottlob.
There Is a new kind of a "growler rusher" in town,
and his innumerable friends will be pained to learn
that this innovation is due to J. J. Gottlob of Fried
lamlor, Gottlob & Co., purveyors of amusement to the
public at the Columbia, Baldwin and California Thea
ters. Everybody who personally knows "JaKe likes
him. but his associates for a month to come will look
upon him with more or less suspicion.
It will be remembered that Mr. Gotlobt) has Just re
turned from a visit of several weeks to New York,
whore he went to bonk attractions for the coming
theatrical season. Like old dog Tray before his fall,
he departed in pood condition and reputf, taking his
full-grown appetite and appreciation of the gilded things
of life with him. He returns only a ghostly reminder
of his former gustatory self, bringing not the gout but
a "Saratoga" full of regrets, which he now has on file
for future reference.
Whereas he formerly played in the full glare of the
footlights on the hot bird and the cold ' bot, and
gazed out on the sunny side of Comfort street, re
garding the world as a ripe watermelon ready to bo
plugged, he is now dancing on the stage gridiron, re
gretting that he ever came In contact with those bad
New York show people.
Tho ghostly truth must be told.
The once-prized patron of the places where the
menu card and the accompanying bill are a yard long
is In disrepute. By reason of his acts in tempting tho
terrorâ goutâ his heartless physician has just put poor
Mr. Gotlobb on a milk and seltzer diet for thirty days,
with not an ounce of solid food. If. therefore, there is
any sudden rise in the price of the lacteal fluid in this
city, or if it become necessary for Inspector Dockery
to raid dairymen for diluting their goods, it can all be
blamed to Mr. Gotlobb.
Two office boys are growing thin and wan rushing
tho milk "growler" and trying to satisfy the internal
cravings of the erstwhile happy theatrical man.
It is a deplorable sight to see this former well-fed,
Bturdy gentleman sitting at his desk doing the brain
fagging act and at the same time endeavoring to
obtain subsistence from a nursing bottle, and keep the
office boys hustling up the requisite supply of liquid
food.
A serious feature of the case is the sudden and un
usual drain on the net box office receipts, and If any
one observes a far-away look in Sam Friedlander's
eye it can be attributed to the fact that he is won
dering where all this milk food is coming from.
In conclusion, the suggestion is offered that any one
who has a grudge against Herr Gotlobb can square
accounts with the gentleman by inviting him to a
"wide-open" dinner at a first-class French restaurant,
for he is hungrier than a Colorado desert tramp, and
won't eat. . . :.'
This latter statement goes for thirty days only.
A FRAUD ON
THE CHINESE
Deception in the Guise
of Charity.
NOT THE SALVATION ARMY
SUBSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED BY
FALSE CREDENTIALS.
The Lieutenant of the Chinese Corps
of the Salvation Army
Makes a Dis
covery.
The officers of -the Salvation Army claln
to have made a discovery of fraud whlcl
has been practiced
on unsuspecting
Chinese merchants
for snmo time past.
In the guise of
members of the
Chinese Corps of the
Salvation Army sev
eral men have ob
tained subscriptions
from well-to-do Chi
nese, fraudulently
representing them
selves to be bona
fide members of tho
army.
The army mem
bers solicit sub
scriptions regularly
from Chinese busi
ness houses for the
purpose of relieving
poor and distressed
Celestials. Tne Sal
vation Army itself
is a well-known or
ganization in China
town and receives a
ready assistance
from the Chinese
merchants. The
other charitable or
ganizations, such
as the Gospel Army
and the God's Reg
ular Army are prac- - Â»
ticaily unknown in that locality and uo
little or no relief work for the Chinese.
The deception that has been practices is
made easy since the books which U.e col
lectors carry with thorn as credentials
are written in the Chinese language.
The characters which head the first
page stand for the "Salvation Army in
their English equivalent. These charac
ters have been used by the impostors to
further their own fraudulent ends. The
page of Chinese print accompanying th:s
article which tells of the objects and pur
poses of the societyâ the taking care of
the sick and the relief of the poor and
the needy. But the conclusion of the cre
dential is in translation. "Gospel Army."
Another inconsistency exists in the print
ed card on the fly leaf. This is in English
but, according to the Salvation Array
workers, the Chinese are ignorant or the
meaning of the card. All they notice on
it is the picture of the woman with an
Army bonnet which forces belief upon
their minds that the subscriptions go for
the benefit of their countrymen and are
distributed by the Salvation Army corps.
Two books used by the impostors have
been secured by members of the army,
About two weeks ago a man by the name
of Engelberg was soliciting subscriptions
with one of these books, when a Chinese,
suspecting fraud, followed him into a
store and demanded to soe the books.
Engelberg refused at first, but as the
Oriental religionist pressed him nard. he
produced them at last. The Chinese reed
the headlines and informed the i>oop!e
present that this collector was an im
postor. He then forced Engelberg to go
with him to the quarters of the China
town corps of the Salvation Army. Very
reluctantly Engelberg followed and, when
threatened with arrest if he refused to
surrender the books, he capitulated. He
disclosed the name of the printer, who
was immediately interviewed by the lieu
tenant of the Chinese corps. The printer
exposed the fact that Engelberg ordered
him to print the books with tho^e rajne
characters in the headlines. Engelberg
avowed a complete ignorance of the Chi
nese language and said he thought the
Chinese characters In the headlines meant
something else.

In ten years the harbor has never been

day. The engaged tonnage is light, the
disengaged still lighter and the prospects
of an improvement are light, owing to the

last year there were about 60 more deep
water vessels in port than there are to
day, and every one of them did well. Yes
terday the disengaged vessels in port ag
gregated 26,335 tons, while at the same
time last year it was 103,572 tons. The en

stove. When the mass had come to the
desired consistency he lifted the pot off
the stove. There was a leak from the
can, and he lifted it up to see where it
was. As he did so the bottom of the
vessel dropped out and the boiling mass
ran over his shoulders and down his
back and chest, burning him in a fright
ful manner.
The schooner Una, which arrived yes
terday from Panama, is again in trou
ble. Last year she came from the same
port without clearance papers, and the
customs authorities threatened to seiz<?
i the vessel. The matter was finally ar
ranged by Captain Harkins sending to
Panama for the papers, which were pro
cured by the United States Consul. Now
Captain Harkins has repeated trie trick
and has again come into port without
i clearance papers. On this occasion the
chances are all in favor of the confisca
tion of the schooner.
Captain John Caw, late of the British
ship Blalrmore. left for Scotland yester
day. The Blairmore capsized in Mission
Bay three years ago, and the litigation
over the insurance has only just been
decided in favor of the owners.
The investigation into the sinking of
the Scandla'p launch was continued
aboard the troop ship yesterday. Captain
Hart and the men in the launch at the
time of the accident gave their testimony,
and Mate Grimm and the assistant en
gineer of the McDowell were also exam
ined. No report of the proceedings will
be given out until the board has reported
first to General Merrlam.
The search for the remains of Mrs, Pax
ton was continued yesterday without suc
cess. Either they were carried under the
wharves by an eddy or they have been
carried out to sea.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE DUTY OF MOTHERS.
Daughters Should be Carefully
Guided In Early Womanhood.
What suffering frequently results
from a mother's ignorance; or more
frequently from a mother's neglect to
properly instruct her daughter
Tradition says "woman must suffer,"
and young women, are so taught.
There is a little truth and a great deal
of exaggeration in this. , If a young
woman suffers severely she needs
treatment and her mother should see
that she gets it.
Many mothers hesitate to take their
daughters to a physician for examina-
tion; but no mother need hesitate to
write freely about her daughter, or
herself to Mrs. Pinkham and secure
the most efficient advice without
charge. Mrs. Pinkham'a address is
Lynn, Mass. ' *i
The following letter from Miss Mabie
F. Johnson, Centralia, Pa. shows what
neglect will do, and tells how Mrs.
Pinkham helped her :
"My health became so poor that I
had to leave school. I was tired all the
time, and had dreadful pains in my
side and back. I was also troubled
with irregularity of menses. I was
very weak, and lost so much flesh that
my friends became alarmed. My
mother, who is a firm believer in your
remedies from experience, thought per-
haps they might benefit me, and wrote
you for advice. I followed the advice
you gave, and used Lydia E. Pinkham'a
Vegetable Compound and Liver Pills as
you directed, and am now as well as I
ever was. I have gained flesh and have
a good color. I am completely cured of
Irregularity."

Deputy Fish Commissioner Cross will
â¢ plant 75.000 trout fry to-day near the
confluence of the Paper Mill and L.v
â¢ gunitas creeks. As exclusively stated In
.last Tuesday's Call, Mr. Cross planted
.25,000 fry of the cutthroat (Mykiss) and
. rainbow (Iridius) in the Lagunitas Creek,
â  near Libertys, and when the little fel
lows were placed in the shallows they
immediately started on a hunt for food.
â  Deputy Cross states that he had seen
quite a number of small fry In the pools,
and that with the addition of the little fel
lows that came from the hatchery there
should be trout for all and first-class
fishing In the l^agunitas next year.
It is to be hoped that the anglers will
use good judgment in their selections of
pan fishes, and that all trout less than
Jive inches in length will be returned to
the stream. It has been stated, '
on good authority, that the Super
visors of Marin County will soon pass an
ordinance making it a- misdemeanor for
any person to have in possession trout of
loss than five inches in length. This will
give the constables of the county a good
â  opportunity to add to the treasury.
The following letter from that well
known angler and lover of true Bport,
â  James Watt, speaks for itself:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 18.
â  Sporting Editor, San Francisco Call â Dear
Sir: Now that the Paper Mill Creek and the
Laagunitas have been stocked by the fish com
missioners, would it not be well to suggest to
the sportsmen of San Francisco the advlsabll
â¢ ' Ity of engaging a watchman to patrcl the two i
streams both In and out of season.
A go d man to Rive his entire attention
could be had for say $60 per mmith.
The main difficulty seems tv be the oon
tinuancc of their subscriptions on the part of
interested Â«poi tsmen.
Can you suggest any feasible plan for ac
complishing this result. Yours very truly,
JAM 103 WATT.
Adolph Lorsbach, who is possibly bet
ter known among his sporting friends as
"Ham and Eggs," is stocking a stream in
Frultvale with imported frogs. Lors
bach doos not hesitate to say that a frog
will rise to a fly. and that the large fel
lows are game fighters. H. and E. baÂ£

" Watt.
â¢ The following very Interesting item
on the growth of salmon appeared in
the Portland Oregonian of recent date:
The number of marked salmon captured
this season is much larger than is gen
erally known. They were hatched in the
fall of 1895, and after being marked by
cutting off the adipose tin, were turned
in to the rivers in the spring of 1899.
The fact of their capture proves that
some of the salmon at least return to
the river where they were hatched in
less than four years, the time in which
scientific men who have made a study i
of this matter say that it takes salmon '
to mature. As the marked fish weV
turned out In the spring of 1596, thos?!
caught this season have been at large
only a little over two years. The first
'one caught weighed only ten pounds, but
the most of those caught since weigh
over twenty pounds, and one weighed
fifty-seven pounds. It seems almost in- !
Ible that a salmon should grow to ;
ize in less than two years and a
half, but there can be no doubt that the
marked fish caught are some of those
â¢which were turned out in the spring of
Fish and Game Protector McGuire <:
lias kept a list of all the marked fish re-
I to him. with their weights, which
will be published at the end of the sea
son. It is probable that more of these
marked ilsh will be caught next season,
a:. : when a comparison of the weights ;
of those is made with the weights of the 'â 
ones caught this season, a better Idea
of how long it takes salmon to attain \
their full growth may be obtained.

BAN FRANCISCO, August IS, 189 S.
Sporting Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: A '
party of campersâ George M. Fisher, Charles :
Daly and W. "Jimmy" Murphy of Armona and j
E. S. Belcher of San Francisco â who have Just ;
returned from Kern Lakes, bring excellent
reports of the fishing along Tule anil Kern
rivers. Large catches of golden, trout were
made by all fortunate enough to have chosen '
that region for their racatlon this summer.
At the forks of the Big and Little Kern rivers
and In Whitney Creek the trout were espe- !
cially accommodating, rising to almost any ot>- |
Jpct in the form of a fly or insect, and taking
â¢ Fuch a firm hold of the hook that the poorest |
fisherman could come Into camp with a falr-
Bized mess at any time. An hour's fishing in ''â 
â  Whitney Creek resulted in a catch of 210 of
'the golden beauties, all of which were caught r
â between the falls, one and a half miles from !
â where the creek joins the river, and nona of
the fish measured under eight inches, and few ,
over twelve.
At the lakes the trout would not rise, all
successful catches being made with salmon j
files close to the bottom, the fish weighing from â 
one pound to Fix and a half pounds.
Game of all kind* was very scarce, owing to
large bands of sheep destroying what little
feed had sprung up. The ranchers throughout |
the district are complaining of the valley farm- I
era for Bending sheep into the mountains, for I
they not only ruin the meadows, but kill out
the snow brush and all other vegetation, there
by driving all animal life out of the country,
and also seriously endangering the water sup
ply. "While at the forks of the Kerns, how
ever, which Is off the beaten trail, four bucks
â¢were brought into camp, also three bears.

IMPALED ON A MEAT HOOK.
Painful Experience of George Selig
in Front of a Butcher Shop.
The novel sensation of being Impaled on
a meathook was experienced yesterday
morning by George SeJig, a young man
living at 673 McAllister street.
Selig was distributing cards announc
ing the butchers' picnic and when he
reached a butcher's shop on Fourth
street, between Minna and Mission, he
secured a ladder to nail a card to the
front wall. While nailinsr the. card the
ladder .slipped from under him, and he feTl,
striking upon a meathook, which pene
trated his left chest. lie hung suspended
in the air for a minute or two until re

He was taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal. where Dr. Hartley dressed the wound.
The hook had. fortunately, not penetrated
the chest cavity, and Selig will soon be
all right again.

THE FIELD OF SPORT
CHAMPION PECK
GIVES UP
CYCLE RACING.
Frank O. Peck, the champion racing
cyclist of the Pacific Coast, has perma
nently retired from the path. He ar
rived at this decision day before yester
day, and the news will come as a big
surprise to those who know him and who
looked upon him as an aspirant for rac
ing honors on Eastern tracks. Peck has
Becured a position here with a tire firm,
and, strange to say, they prefer his ser
vices hi a clerical way rather than in
racing. You would think that any one
in the bicycle business, employing the
champion of the coast, would want him
to retain the championship against all
comers and thereby advertise the make
of wheel and tire he rode. But it is not
so in this case, and Peck had the choice
of giving up racing or losing his posi
tion, and as the latter was his bread and
butter he chose the course he has taken,
although much to his regret. His retlre
ment will be a big disappointment to the
Bay City Wheelmen, who looked to him
to carry their colors to victory in the
fall road races and the annual Admission
day meet at San Jose. Wing and "Bunt"
Smith should now have things pretty
much their own way.
Captain J. S. Shedd of the Acme Club
Wheelmen will leave for the East in a
| fortnight and remain there. This will
j leave another vacancy on the road racing
I committee of the associated clubs, one
! having been filled only last Wednesday
: by the appointment of Captain .Loos of
' the Olympics, vice Myrick, resigned. Mr.
! Shedd "was an active worker, and the as
sodation and his club will sadly mlsa
him.
The proposed run of the Olympic
Wheelmen to Marin County, scheduled
for to-morrow, has been postponed until
August 23 by Captain JLoos.
In answer to a correspondent, C. M. S.,

is 1:32 3-5, by Edouard Taylore of France.
The world's hour record is 34 miles 1022
yards, by Harry Elkes of America.
Captain A. P. Deacon of the Reliance
Club Wheelmen has returned from a two
weeks' tour of Lake County.
Entry blanks are out for the Garden
City wheelmen's race meet at San Jose
on September 9. Entries close with
George E. Owen on September 2. The
events are to be a two-thlrd-niile
Bcratch and one-mile handicap, amateur,
and an exhibition mile by Hardy Down-
Ing, paced by Otto Zlegler Jr. and Wilbur
Edwards on a tandem. There will pos-
Bibly be a match between Wing and
"Bunt" Smith, at one, three and live
miles, paced.
"Bunt" Smith is willing to race Bozio
soon after the 9th of September, provid
ing the date does not conflict with the
Associated Clubs' road events. He would
like three racesâ a one-mile single, paced;
five-mile pursuit, and ten-mile opposite
ways of the track.
Hardy Downing returned north Mon
day, and will ride in the mile open to
day at Wellington, B. C. He will also
pace a match between Frank J. Cotter
and Marshall, an Eastern negro.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen and Bay
City Wheelmen will have a joint club run
to Mission San Jose on Sunday, Septem
ber 25, as the guests of Messrs. Montea
legre, Salazar and Gallegos.
The Capital City Wheelmen of Sacra
mento have arranged a series of mem
bers' road ra< ea for Sundays in August,
September and October, the lirst to occur
to-morrow. The distance will be ten
miles or less, euch event a handicap.
Merit Will be decided by points, and the
one winning the most points In the three
events will receive a bicycie as a prize
from a dealer and a gold medal from the
club. There arr- other prizes, so that al
most every starter is sure of something.
The idea might be copied with good re
sults by Burnt- of the local clubs tnat are
just now complaining of ennui.
The picnic run of the Olympic Cyclers
will be held to-morrow at Li.cie Tom's
Cabin. Members and puests who attend
on wheels will leave the club at 9 o'clock.
Others can take the trains at Third and
Townsend streets, leaving at 9, 10:40 and
11:30 a. m. A big crowd and a jolly time
are anticipated.
J. E. Wing contemplates an attack on
the ten-mile record from Fruitvale to
Haywards a week from Sunday if the
conditions are favorable. ,?.
The total destruction of the grand stand
and bicycle track at Sacramento by fire
on Sunday last is to be regretted. James
E. Little, one of the leaders in cycling at
the Capital City, says:
Am very sorry to say that the pavilion, grand
stand and about one-half of the fence, also
about 300 feet of the bicycle track, were com
pletely deptroyed by fire. They will be rebuilt
at once, the insurance money to be used to thiÂ«
end, and everything will be Improved upon.
Hlr=ch, Hamlin and a few more of the riders
â will be eeen at San Jose on the 9th of Sep
tember. We have been potng for records here I C
late. The three, four and five mile records are
now held by Noyse of our club. Sunday last
we had a sanction for an open event for all
records, but the lops of the track on Saturday
afternoon jut a stop to It. We have got a
lightning fast tandem team in Hamlin and
Eidred.
In spite of the recent fire by which the
Terminal City Wheelmen of Stockton lost
all their club effect*, they will hold their
annual picnic run, which is one of the
features of the year's cycling, next Sun
day. Visitors from the city will take the
6 o'clock river boat Saturday night, re
turning 1 Sunday night.
There will be no race meet at Stockton
next Sunday after all. The Stockton
Athletic Club took it off the hands of the
Terminal City's after the fire the latter
club suffered, but they finally decided
they could not make it go, and the prop
osition was dropped.
The fourteenth annual election of the
Bay City 'Wheelmen will be held at the
club on Monday evening, September 12.
There does not seem to be any disposi
tion among the members to change the
present management of the club, who
have placed it at the head of all bicycle
clubs west of Chicago.

SALT WATER SPRINKLING.
Great Benefits to Streets Have Al
ready Been Observed.
Li. M. King, superintendent of the
street department work of the Merchants'
Association, Is rejoicing because the
municipal street department nas begun
sprinkling the streets with salt water,
which has been advocated by the associa
tion for a long time. Upon the subject
Mr. King says:
"The city has at last made a beginning
in the use of salt water for street sprink
ling. The Street Department has ordered
the macadamized blocks on Van Ness
avenue, which is sprinkled at the city's
expense, to be sprinkled with salt water
Instead of fresh. A standplpp has been
erected at the corner of Van Ness avenue
and Geary street, where the main of the
Olympic Salt Water Company crosses the
former street.
"Although salt water has been used only
since last Friday the good effect of its use
Is already very evident. The maoadam is
binding together and the pavement on the
blocks below McAllister street is already
packed hard and smooth. In a week's
time dust will be unknown there, for
even the loose dirt accumulated along the
side of the street Is kept In a moist con
dition and becomes too heavy to be
blown about by any ordinary wind. It Is
reported by the party doing tne sprink
ling that two sprinklings of salt water are
more effective than three of fresh. The
binding together of the macadam will also
freatly preserve the pavement. The
upervfsors have expressed themselves as
favoring salt water for street sprinkling
and the citizens will welcome thÂ« time
when Its use becomes general."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGTJST 20, 1898.
HOUNDS & HARES
ARE IN
FINE CONDITION.
The managers of Union Coursing Park
are determined to stamp out the dog job
bers, and in future a close watch will be
kept on the destroyers of coursing, who
report to any means to win money. There
are people who attend coursing meetings
not for the love of the Bport but for the
money that they can pocket by fraud
and base trickery. The doping of dogs
has become quite an Industry of late with
some vandals, and it is about time that
the park managers teach the destroyers
of coursing a lesson that they will have
good reason to remember.
It Is not an easy matter to detect a
hound fiend in the act of "shooting" a
dog, but whenever one of the kind is
caught the severest punishment imagin
able should be meted out to him.
The two coursing parks this week will
donate to the fortunate dog owners some
thing like $1300 in prizes. At Union Park
only one stake will be run, an open event.
emKmcing sixty candidates, and for an
aggregate of $720. At Ingleslde there will
be two stakes, an event for non-winners
of third or better during the past Biz
months and a special champion feature.
The running at both parks promises to
be warm in the extreme. The quality of
the canines is high, those, particularly in
the champion event being the cracks of
tue Kast and the West. That th<^- will
go to Slipper Grace in top-notch condition
is best attested by the liberality of the
prizes.
Curtis & Sons should certainly land a
goodly slice of coin nt Union Park this
RESULT OF A DEER SHOOT.
A PARTY of sportsmen composed of Lloyd Eaton, Frank Hofling,
Charles Dletz, Herbert Spencer and Ben Harris returned a few days
ago from a very successful attack upon the deer family of the San
hedrim Mountains, Mendocino County. Several of the large game
- animals retreated In good order at sight of the enemy, but during the
âº skirmishing at close range in, heavy cover eleven deer were iriiiea, "id
âº doubtless many of those shot at were wounded. The hunters escaped un

the exertion by landing the champion
stake this week.
The regular annual Produce stake for
189K, to be run at Ingleside October 1 and
2. will be one of the notable meeting! of
the coast. To the total entrance money
at $10 for long tail, the Interstate Club
will add $500. Last year the entire purse
was $430. BeÃides the Produce stake there
will a special champion stake to which
the club will add another $500, making
something like a $2000 meeting for the
two days. Entries for the Produce
stake close September 8, and the nomina
tions will lie declared and drawn on the
Thursday night preceding the runningâ
or September 27th. The stake Is con
fined to puppies whelped during 1597. and
owned by members of the Interstate or
other recognized coursing clubs. The
special stakes will be wide open.
The Champion stake at Inglestde this
week should be one of the hardest con
tested events ever run off on that sward.
There are only sixteen, and not a
"geezer" in the lot. With but two ex
ceptions the coast candidates all have
notable brackets to their credit, while
the Eastern contingent embraces the beet
now sojourning this side of the moun

ACTION AND LIFE
IN TENNIS CIRCLES.
The championship doubles tournament
to be played In the beginning of next
month Is exciting t&e interest of tennis
players at the present time. Everything
Is favorable for a successful tournament.
As yet the courts on which the double
championship of 189S will be played have
not been selected. A committee of three
has been appointed to make investiga
tions and report their judgment to the
Pacific Coast Tennis Association. Three
courts are in the run for the tournament
âDel Monte, San Rafael and the Califor
nia Club. The last seems to be the most
favored and there is every reason to be
lieve that it will be selected for tho
tournament.
On Sunday, August 28, the Bollevue
Tennis Club will hold a doubles tourna
ment, open to members of Alameda
City. The teams which are practicing
for the tournament are Stark and Hunt,
Murdock and Bartlett, Hall and Burr,
Otis and Hamilton. Bowen and Holmes
are doubtful whether they will enter or
not.
There will be a try-out to-day be
tween the doubles teams of the Alameda
High School to determine which team
Will represent the school in the doubles
championship on September 9. The tour
nament of the Bellevue Club, held dur
ing the week, brought Murdock and Hua
litt in the finals. Murdock disposed of
the latter in three straight sets, winning
the tournament.
The high winds at the California Club's
court during the afternoons has forced
the players to do their work in the
morning. George Whitney and Robert:
X. Whitney have been playing quite as
siduously during the week, and some
very close games between the two have
been the result. The young lady play
ers of the club have been out in the
mornings for steady practice. During
the early part of tho week an impromptu
tournament was hold by the junior Ta
dies. Miss Clark defeated Miss King to
the tune of 6â l, H â 2. Miss Bessie Bow
man defeated Miss Laura Farnsworth In
an uneven contest, the score telling the
talo, 6âo, 6âo.6 â 0. Miss Mason defeated Miss
("lark. &â 3, fiâ 2. in what proved to be
the closest match of the day. Then came
the finals between Miss Bowman and
Miss Mason, who Is a stranger to the
couris. A close contest was expected,
but to the surprise of all Mips Mason
allowed her opponent but a single game
In the two pets played. The winner of
the tournament played in good style,
.showing splendid judgment and rapid
strokes. She has but one real opponent
among the lady playera <>f the California
Club, Miss Hoffman, who will undoubted
ly contest her claims to the champion
ship of the club in the ladies' single
championship tournament which will be
played at the same time with the cham
pionship doubles.
ALAMEDA CRICKETERS
ARE THE CHAMPIONS.
Tho victory of the Alamoda Cricket
Club last Sunday In the fourth match of
the season against the Pacific eleven pave
it the championship for 1898. As the Ala
mfdas were the champions in I8i)5 and
1897, the Hunter-Harrison cup, which
had to be won three times be
fore it became the property of
the winner, now belongs absolutely to
them. A fifth match between the Pacific
and Alameda teams is sot down for Sep
tember 4 and 11, and though the match
run have no effect upon the position of
the clubs for this season, it will doubt
less be playc-d. Bowling and batting av
erages at the September game will count
toward the Buriull prizes, as the game Is
"played under the auspices of the Cali-
I fornia Cricket Association."
To-morrow the return match. Banks
and Insurance Men vs. All-Comers, will
be played at Golden Gate. The Banks
and Insurance Men will consist of J. J.
Moriarlty, J. Myers, Henry Ward, E. F.
Musson, C. P. Coles, J. J. Theobald,
George Theobald, H. P. G. Gordon, F. C.
Driffleld, J. McGaw and Louis James. The
All-Comers' Kleven will be made up by
R. B. Hogue. and will include J. H. Har
bour, T. W. G. Wallace, J. McLean, J. J.
R. Peel. J. H. Saunders, F. Croll, H. Bird,
V. Seebeck, F. Stahl and probably G. I.
Baugh.
At the match played between Yorkshire
and Lancashire ror the benefit of the pro
fessional cricketer Wainwright. Â£1366
or about $8800 was taken at the
gate during the three days, and to this
sum are to be added subscriptions and
the money derived from tty? sale of tick
ets. So that a popular protessional crick
eter reaps some substantial rewu.rd.
Tate did some wonderful bowling lately
for Hampshire against Somersetshire. In
his first over he bowled three of the hest
Somerset batsmen and took seven wickets
in an hour for 25 runs, five of these wick
ets costing only 7 runs. As a result of his
! skill Hampshire won by 9 runs and the
j spectators made up a purse of ?2o for tlie
i young professional.
CRUISING IS THE
YACHTSMAN'S
FAVORITE SPORT.
The next Important event In the yacht
ing world is the annual reg-atta of the
Pacific Interclub Yacht Association on
the 4th or 9th of September. The five
clubs -which were members of the asso
ciation at the beginning- of the season,
when the programmes for 1898 were
drawn up, have the 9th left open for
the reg-atta, but the association pro
gramme gives its date as the 4th. The
3d falling on a Saturday, the 4th on a
Sunday, and the sth being a public holi
day, a good opportunity is afforded for
a long cruise, which many owners will
prefer to a single day's racing. The 9th
being a public holiday, the 10th a Sat
urday, and the 11th a Sunday, an even
better chance for a cruise is offered; and
the San Franciscoa propose to start for
Napa City on the Bth and return on the
11th. A meeting of the association will
be held on Monday evening, at which
the date of tho regatta will be fixed.
But whichever date is chosen the
chances are that many owners will be
tempted to take extended cruises during
the Labor day and the Admission day
holidays, and that the entries for the
regatta will thus be fewer than usual.
But, on the other hand, there will be
three prizes to be competed for this year
Instead of one, as In former years, and
this fact ought to stimulate competition
and Bwell the entry list.
Nearly all the boats of the San Fran
cisco fleet were out last Sunday. Com
modore Dr. T. L. Hill took his first sail

tickets at $5 eitch were sold. He is a
member of the San Franciscos. and may
sell hi.s sloop and buy a yawl.
The Pacifies have a half-raters' race
Bel down for to-morrow, but as those
races have been abandoned and the Law
Cup presented to the Pacific Interyacht
Association, .the date is "open." The
Encinals have a free-for-all race on
their programme to-day, but it will be
called off. The San Franciscos have no
event scheduled, and to-morrow Is "Own

H. S. Pratt of the yawl Idler started
on an up-river trip with his wife and a
party of friends on Tuesday, having re

OREGON WATERS.
Little is talked of at present among
the rowing men of San Francisco except
the regatta which began yesterday at As

The Pioneer intermediate crew, consist
ing of W. St. John (bow), F. O'Neil (No.
2), G. Larsen (No. 3) and F. Orr (stroke),
has begun practice for the championship
regatta to be held here in September or
early in October, but there is not much
likelihood of the club being able to get
together a strong Junior crew.
The Dolphins expect to get their new
barge in about a week. Oars and oarlocks
have been ordered in the East.
\V. O. Patch, who has returned from
his vacation, has taken the junior crew
under his care and will go out with it
three times a week regularly. After A.
W. Pape's return from Astoria the inter
mediate crew will begin practice.
J. Foley, winner of the junior shell
championship last year, has begun prac
tice for the senior shell event, in which
F. Duplissea will also probably take part.
J. Lyons and M. Breen are going out in
skiffs, and will try for the junior skiff
championship. The South End junior
barge crew consists of C. Jenkins (bow),
C. Skelly (No. 2). E. Blumlein (No. 3) and
W. Barry (stroke). Among the new
members of the club who promise to do
good work are W. C. Crook of the Ha
waiian Islands, V. Koster, Lake and Mar
tinez. T. Barry will organize an Interme
diate crew, for which there are some
good candidates. Dr. C. C. Dennis, what
ever may be the result of his contest with

COCKER SPANIELS
ARE IN DEMAND.
The Pacific Coast is In a fair way to be
regarded by the Eastern dog-breeders as
a paradise, though "Western buyers are
not by any means allowing their feathers
to be picked without receiving value in
full. E. C. Plunce ha 3 just bought a
cocker spaniel bitch by Homo, out of
Baby Ruth, which bids fair to rival even
H. H. Carlton's far-famed Trilby. Be
tween these two gentlemen an amicable
rivalry exists which seems destined to
last forever, for as fast as any good
cocker makes its appearance in the East
one or the other snaps It up and brings it
out here.
J. P. Norman, the secretary of the last
convention of kennel clubs, has sent to
the American Kennel Club the report of
the convention, which enUed in a farce,
the votes of three men well furnished
with proxies outwelghting the votes of
five others unprovided with these desir
able adjuncts. Mr. Norman has also for
warded a representation signed by all the
members of the minority, urging the A.
K. C. to amend the rules so that five
wins in the winners' class be necessary
for a championship, and that wins in that
class be not counted as regular class wins.
H. H. Carlton, secretary of the San
Francisco Kennel Club, has received an
unofficial letter from A. P. Vredenberg,
who fills a similar position for the Ameri
can Kennel Club, to the effect that the
American Kennel Club will be willing to
concede any reasonable demand of the
Pacific Coast. It is probable that the
rules will be amended as requested by the
minority at the late meeting and that San
Francisco will be designated as a cham
pion show. In this event it will be neces
sary for a dog to win at least once at this
show in order to be eligible for champion
ship honors.

PRIVATE TALLON
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
ARRESTED ON A CHARGE OF
ROBBING THE MAILS.
Secured Possession of a Letter Posted
by a Comrade and Extracted'
a Postoffice Order.
Private John Tallon, Company H, Twenty-
Third Regiment, United States Infantry,
was locked up in the City Prison yesterday
afternoon on a serious charge of robbing
the mails.
Yesterday morning Tallon was in the
Odd Fellows' booth at Camp Merritt
writing a letter. Seated beside him w:ia
Private Willard M. Gurton, Company D
of the Nebraska Regiment, who was also
writing a letter to his wife in lowa. After
finishing his letter Gurton inclosed a
postal order for $18, and after stamping it
put it in the mall basket in the booth.
Tallon also placed his letter in the bas
ket, but returned in a fow minutes and
asked Mrs. Gibbs. the lady in charge of
the basket, for the return of his letter.
She handed it to him, but he remarked it
was one addressed to "his mother, Mrs.
Gurton," that he wanted. The lady then
handed him Gurton's letter.
Tallon tore open the envelope and ex
tracted the postal order, and finished up
by tearing the letter in pieces. He went
in the saloon of August Funke on Fifth
avenue and asked him to cash the order
Funke gave him the money, and he went
into a barber's shop next door to get
shaved. Funke got suspicious that there
was something wrong with the order, and
stepped into the barber's suop. He made
Tallon return the $1S and kept the order
meantime notifying the police. Policemen
Morris and Kissane arrested Tallon and
took him to the prison.
Tallon did not deny trying to cash the
order, but pair! he found the letter on tfie
stroet and thought then- would be nothing
wrong in opening it. He has been twelve
years in the army, and was soon to K'*t
his discharge and over $1200 back pay due
him. He does not seem to realize that he
has committed any crimo.
Knights and Ladies.
The members of the loral lodges of
the Knights and Ladies of Honor will
celebrate the twenty-first anniversary
of the foundation of the order by a lit
erary and musical entertainment in Turn
Verein Hall on the evening of the 6th
of September. The committee of ar
rangements has secured good talent and
will present an enjoyable programme.

BRITISH CRACKS.
Future of tho Mighty Hamburg,
California Race MeetingsâGos
sip of the Turf,
Notes, Etc.
California climate 1b certainly great for
race horses. Candleblack, a Candlemas
colt brought out here to race last winter
by B. J. Johnston, was ao much benefited
by "the glorioua" that he graduated from
the selling-plate class into the stake and
was purchased by W. H. Clark of Sara
toga last week for $6000. The same gentle
man also secured the chestnut colt Ban
aster, by Farandole-Blossing, therefore a
half-brother to the frequent winner,
Montgomery. Klidad, who could not win
here last winter, has captured two races
at Hawthorne this week. Martha was so
Improved by her trip to the Golden State
that she beat the best stake horses at
Chicago and Saratoga, and was sold re
cently by Tom Griffin for $4000 to ex-Sec
retary of the Navy Whitney. Many other
almost similar instances could be cited of
the wonders California's climate has
worked on beast as well as man.
Ahom, the strapping Sir Dlxon colt that
won at Saratoga On the 12th for "Pitts
burg Phil," is a half-brother to the fa
mous Ben Brush, winner of the Kentucky
Derby.
Mrs. Byron McClelland's colt. His Lord
ship, worked six furlongs over theSheeps
head Bay course late last week In 1:14
flat, with about 100 pounds up. His frac
tional time was :23&, :48, 1:01 and 1;14. In.
consequence he is considered to have a
great chance in the Futurity, richest of
ail two-year-old stake events.
Chinook, a well-named three-year-old
filly, by Sensation, from Breeze, won the |
Nassau Stakes at the recent Goodwood, j
England, meeting, beating the 1000 guinea
winner, Nun Nicer, Orpha (by Orme) and j
five others. As the American representa- j
tive was backed from t> down to 4 to 1 ]
the party is supposed to have made a
neat clean-up. Besides, the stake was
worth about 54150. Kau Gallic, who ran in
Richard Croker's colors for some time,
won at Goodwood for Mr. J. O'Nell, and i
changed hands at 200 guineas. There la i
practically no betting on the St. Leger,
it being conceded that nothing In the
stake has a chance to defeat Jeddah, the
Derby winner.
Hamburg Is not going to Kngland or j
any other country to race, as .several am
bitioua writers have had it of late. It now |
; transpires that Trainer William Lakeland
believes the colt would nut stand training :
much longer, and now that he has demon- :
titrated tv the public that the famous son
of Hanover is a stayer as well as a sprln- ,
U-r, the horse goes to end his days at the
Hitter Root stud, Hamilton, Mont. Mar
cus lÂ»aly has on that place the finest col- i
â¡ of Kngllsh mares in America, and
with these the might*- Hamburg will bo
mated In lM>y. Trainer Lakeland and Mr.
Daly never had any idea of sending the
colt against Ornament in a match race.
averring that while the four-year-old is
undoubtedly a good horse, he has been
too many times to make It any ;
great honor for Hamburg to defeat him.
A Chi. ,ii;.. paper says: "Willie Sink Jr.,
who refused J12.5'j0 for Formero, is under
going treatment at the hands of a Madi- ;
son-street phrenologist."
Next Saturday, the 20th. the Santa Rosa
trottlng-pacing meeting begins, and not
only are the best performers at present In
California entered, bat thero Is a lot of
"raw material" to be sprung on an un
suspecting public, of which much is ex
!â â  cx< '1 at lÂ«-;i!-t by the owners. At Sac
ramento trur<- are a lot of good "green"
ones, too, and the runners are there in
great force. One of tho best meetings in
the history of the State Agricultural So
ciety Is expected. A. B. Spreckcls, the
newly-fleeted president, is an enthusiast
on contests hetw.en horses of all gaits,
and the coming Stato K;iir meeting Is cer
tain to be a rousing one.
"Long Shot" Conley was set down for
the meeting at Hawthorne last Friday
and fined $1O.Â» besides for riding foully.
He was not very particular who he â¢
bumped here last winter.
Anaconda's showing 1 in the 2:08 {MM
at Columbus on the closing day wil ;i
glorious one. The Sacramento gelding
won the first heat In 2:06Â»4, lost the next
two, then won the fourth in 2:07. the last
heat in 2:08. Of the Oregon pacer
Chehalis the Buffalo Horse World corre
spondent said regarding his race an the
last day: "His second mile In 2:04*4 Is
the fastest race heat for either trotter
or pacer this season. He showed great
ly improved form over that of last week
at Cleveland, and will be one of the
hardest of the pacing brigade to beat for
the remainder of the year." Directum
Kelly had little trouble in the 2:24 trot,
and trotted the fourth heat in 2:l3Vi over
a soft and sticky track, this being one of
the best performances of the year. Last
week he won easily at the Fort Wayne
(Ind.) meeting.
The great Searchlight was beaten at
the Portland (Me.) meeting by Roan
"W'ilkes, who stepped off the three heat 3
in 2:04Â« i. 2:07*4, 2:05. Keating being sick,
Ben Walker was called upon to drive
Searchlight, who was beaten a length in
the first heat, a good deal more than that
In the second, and more than a length
in the last. Those were tho three fastest
heats of the season.
Nloo, the son of Arlon, 2:07%, and Mag
gie Sullivan, by Sultan (California breed
ing), is a great trotter. At the Portland
(Me.) meeting he beat the superb Eros
mare Drone, who took the second heat
in 2:10*4, in 2:09^. 2:OMi. 2:llVi- Stam
boulette, by Stamboul. was third, and
General, by Sidney, fourth. Verily Cali
fornia made a showing in this race, in
which there were thirteen tsarters.
Nione Is the fastest four-year-old trot
ter ever bred in New England.
Prudence. 2:lsVi. has a foal at her side
by Directum, 2:05*4.
Phyllia Kelly, a sister to Directum
Kelly 2:11%. is entered in the two-year
old trot at Glen Falls, N. T.
Andy McDowell of Pleasanton, Cal.,
has driven the following champions to
their records: Alix, 2:03%; Azote, 2:04%;
Klatawah (3), 2:00*4: Directly (3). 2:07%.
and Lena N In 2:06*4. the fastest mile
ever paced by a mare in a race.
It looks now as if the Pleasanton track
would be considerably widened and 300
good box-stalls erected by a syndicate
of enthusiastic harness-horse lovers. The
Pleasanton course will then be about the
best training track in the State, and
meetings will be held on it at least
a couple of times each season.

THE WEATHER PBOPHETS.
McAdie's Promotion Causes Changes
in the Local Office.
The Weather Bureau service here Is ex
periencing quite a shaking up. Alexander
McAdie, who has been for three years the
local forecast official at San Francisco,
assisting Forecast Official W. H. Ham
mon, leaves to-day to take the chief posi
tion at New Orleans.
The official rank of the weather service
Is not generally understood as well as
the distinctions of shoulder-straps. A
forecast official Is a sort of division com
mander. Thus, Mr. Hammon bosses all
the weather In California, Nevada, Utah
and Arizona. A local forecast official is
not supposed to know enough to foretell
the weather outside of his town and Im
mediate vicinity, regarding which he
rives supplementary tips, as does fhe fel
low at Los Angeles. la practice the local
forecast official at San Francisco is an
assistant forecast ofllcial and takes his
turn at the whole field. Mr. McAdiÂ© thus
takes charge of the division of the Gulf
and enjoys a promotion in rank.
His place here will be filled by George
H. Wilson, who haa been an observer
here for several years and whose ability
has earned his promotion to local fore
cast official. Mr. McAdie has managed
the climate and crop service here and will
be succeeded In that work i-y Observer
H. E. Smith, who Is transferred from Los
Angeles.
HOLY CROSS FAIR.
Preparations for Raising Funds for
the New Parish Church.
A largo and very enthusiastic meeting:
of tho ladies of Holy Cross parish was
held last evening In the hall adjoining: the
church on Eddy street, to make arrange
ments for the fair which is to be held at
Native Sons' Hall next October. It will
be for the purpose of raising- funds for
the new church which Is now In. course of
construction.
The old building, which Is at present
used for services, has the distinction of
being oftener christened and remodeled
than any church In the United States, or
possibly the world. It was first used by
the parishioners of St. Patrick's, and lo
cated where the Palace Hotel now stands.
Afterward It was put on rollers, named
St. John's and erected on Eddy street,
near Octavia. Lastly It was moved to the
present location in Holy Cross parish,
where It was again rechrlstened and
called after the parish it served.
Rev. John F. McGinty, the popular and
energetic pastor, who has guided the des
tinies of the parish from its inception,
presided last evening. He told those as
sembled that the undertaking was com
menced owing to the exemplary and
largely increased congregation, the old
building being quite inadequate to accom
modate tho worshipers. He also congrat
ulated the ladies on their efforts to help
along the new church, which, with its
massive pillars and stately columns,
would, when comploted, be a grand monu
ment to the Almighty God as well as one
that the parishioners as well as the citi
zens of San Francisco should feel Justly
proud of. The reverend gentleman stated
that when the new edifice is finished,
which he expected would be some time
next spring, the old church would be usod
as a hall for the parish, where it will
finally rest and be a landmark for the
pioneer church of the secular clergy oa
the Mission Dolores Is of the regular or-
Mayor Phelan will open the fair, which
will commence October 18, and will con
tinue for two weeks. The various booths
will be of the most artistic designs and

Society said the ladies of each booth

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19â The recovery from j
yesterday's reaction in the stock market was j
decisive and complete before the end of the j
day, and the closing showed a furiously active j
buying movement In force which was absorb- ,
Ins all offerings at advancing prices. Some of j
these offerings were heavy as a result of the j
attractive level of prices attained, and numer- |
ous individual blocks of 10,000 shares and up- j
â¢ward of St. Paul were snapped up with appar
ent avidity. St. Paul resumed the leadership
of the market and was well taken and firmly 1
held all day, but it was net until the last half
hour of the trading that it was taken decis
ively In hand and rushed up from about 110%
to 112}*. The other grangers followed suit, '
though at a less lively rate and with nowhere '
near bo large a volume of business. Burling
ton recovered its 14 dividend and % besides.
The earlier part of the day showed a marked
falling off In the animation of the market, and
the conspicuous movements in prices were con
fined almost entirely to the industrial special
ties. It became evident at the opening that
there were supporting orders for leading stocks
which offered a barrier to further declines In
them. There was In addition a continuance of
the outside demand for stocks through com
mission houses. Some of the industrials
showed a buoyant tone and served to sustain
prices. Although there was Borne realizing i
during the first hour, it was so well absorbed
that the bears became discouraged and de- |
sisted from their efforts to break the market.
When it was announced thai the Stock Ex
change would be closed from to-day until Mon
day it became evident that the shorts were |
the ones who felt timid about leaving com- j
mitments outstanding. The rise in St. Paul ]
â¢was 3H. Lake Erie and Western 5, Lake Erie i
and Western preferred 7' 4 , -Pacific Coast Im
provement 34 and Pacific Coast Improvement !
second preferred 3.
Reports by the Trade Journal and from other
sources tell of some expansion of business as
a result of the termination of the war with
Spain. New York banks are shipping gold
to the "Interior for circulating medium. An
early gold movement from abroad to New York j
seems inevitable, and there is eager demand i
by national banks for the new Government !
bonds. As fast as they can be acquired they j
will undoubtedly be used for expanding the j
bank circulation.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Aug. 13.â Bradstreet's financial
review to-morrow will say: This has been a
week of active and excited ppeculatlon. The
public has come into the market and buying,
which at times assumed an almost reckless
appearance, haa extended throughout the
share list. Large professional Interests have
taken up various parts of tho list In succes
sion and found the public ready to follow their
lead. The conspicuous feature of tho week
was tho granger BtocJBS and the most striking
incident the increase of the Burlington divi
dend rate to 1% per cent quarterly, or 6 per
cent per annum. This announcement, coming
out on Wednesday, when the market seemed
likely to react under taking of profits by
traders, kept up the excitement and advances
for that day, while It resulted In dealings to
the extent of 900,000 shares, one of the largest
days the exchange has had In some time.
On Thursday, however, there was more or less
reaction throughout the market, profits being
taken freely, while at the declines there wae
a fair amount of fresh buying. On Friday the
market tended to recover still further and
support was given by the large Interests.
Shorts covered and the close was In many
cases at or near the highest level of the move
ment. The market Is certainly a broader one
than for n lonj? time past. Commission house
buying has been the feature and while as yet
It cannot be said that the public has taken
the market away from the professionals the
latter seem to have much less control than
usual. Some of the usual accompaniments
of nn old time "boom" are present, and the
Btreet at Inree Is apparently Inclined to be
lleve thnt 1? it does not become a boom the
rise of prices and Increase of speculative ac
tivity will continue for some time at least.
The principal developments of the week have
all ten. led to favor the bull side, the effects
of peace being supplemented by a further good
crop report, by nn Increase in earnings and
by the advance of Americans In London and
the appearance of a disposition on the pnrt of
ners to purchase. A decline of exchange
at the end of the weÂ»k was also noted among
the favorable circumstances.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Perhaps the most interesting
feature of the genera] business situation at
present is the air of confidence with which the
mercantile community awaits the approach of
the fall trade period. While of course based
in some degree upon the favorable results al
j ready achieved in many lines It Is unquestion
ably true that the flattering j crop outlook at
home and the return of peace, with the ex
pectation of benefits to our export trade nat
urally expected to accrue therefrom, make
up for much of the feeling thus expressed,
Reflection of the growth of the fall trade is
found in the steady expansion now going on in
bank clearings, the improved demand at higher
prices for most makes of Iron and steel, the
generally favorable railway earnings, which.
in default of a large movement of crops to
market, point to a large return trade in manu
factured goods to thÂ» agricultural sections, and
the reports of continued activity in distributive
trade. West and South, with signs of a mod
erate Increase In interest at leading Eastern
market?, which hitherto have not shared largely
In the trade improvement. The immense busi
ness doing In iron . and steel products at ; ad
vanced prices calls attention to the proportion
ately less notable expansion of crude Iron pro
duction. Plglron statistics, In fact, point to
an even 1 smaller output for the current month,
some of which curtailment, . of course, is nat
urally based upon midsummer conditions. Ad
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 20, 1893.
! vances in many grades of iron, notably Besse
mer ;uid South..-â¢ pig, are features of the IRA
as are also higher ijuotations for steel billets
at nearly all markets, wire rods and a great
many Classen of finishing iron and steel, par
tlrufarly structural material. Advances in cop
per, on the strong; statistical position, and lead
an- also among the interesting features in the
metal trade. At the West iron and steel are
particularly active, and the large, number of or
ders already booked make manufacturers fairly
independent regarding: prices and favor an ad
vance on future business. The situation in
cereals shows but little change. The balance
established between phenomenally reduced vis
ible supplies, active milling demand at home
and fair export inquiry on the one hand and
the very promising crop outlook on the other
hand tends to steadiness in prices, and other
cereals sympathize -with wheat.
Reports as to collections the country over
are very encouraging. From winter wheat sec
tions especially reports are very good. Some
slowness is noted In payments at the North
west, but this is expected to disappear when the
spring wheat crop moves.
Business failures are larger in number than
last week, aggregating ISS against 157 last
week as compared with 231 In this week a
year ago, 264 in 1i96. 192 in 1895 And 251 in 1894.
Buyers are appearing In Increasing numbers
at leading Western markets. Chicago reports
Increased activity In distributive trade on
country demand, with dry goods shipments es
pecially large. Sales of iron and steel are re
stricted by Inability to deliver. The short pack
of canned salmon has advanced prices. South
ern and Western buyers are arriving at St.
Louis, and dry goods, boots and shoes, hats
and caps are all active. Advances in struc
tural iron are a feature, and tin plate and
sheet mills are behind on orders. Kansas City,
St. Paul. Omnha and Minneapolis report ac
tive trade. East of the Mississippi and north
of the Ohio rivers In the West reports of trade
ere not so nattering, but a steady business Is
reported doing, with some slight improvement
at a number of markets.
At Memphis the outlook Is for the heaviest
business In the history of the city, but dam
age by cotton worms in Texas affects trade
nt Qalveaton. In the South Atlantic rltles re
ports are of a perceptible improvement In
trade. On the Pacific Coast, while business Is
quiet In California, large crops In Oregon and
Washington are expected to make fall trade
lively. Oregon fntltmen are doing a good busi
nps= and are shipping to California points.
At the East more Is doing at Baltimore. South
ern buyers are increasing In number, and
stocks are reported heavily reduced. Business
Is active at Pittsburg, Iron and steel being es
pecially so. At Boston and New York a
moderate improvement is noted. In wool and
woolen goods business Is only moderate, nnd
manufacturers buy for present requirements.
Orders for men's wear goods for the spring
trade are coming in better.
Wheat shipments for the week, Including
flour, aggregate 3, 796,938 bushels, as against
3,528,604 bushels last week, and compared with
.1.316,803 bushels In this week last year. 2,991.
693 bushÂ»ls In the corresponding week in 1896.
2.359.110 bushels in ZBK, and 3.152.100 bushels In
1R94. Since July 1 this year the exports of
wheat aggregate 21.950.66 C bushels, against 21,
432.240 bushels last year.
Canadian trade is quiet, but the tone Is one
pf care, based primarily upon an expected
wheat yield larger than ever before In the
Dominion's history. In British Columbia a
normal trade is doing, but the salmon pack
as a whole Is disappointing and prices tend
upward. Business failures In the Dominion of
Canada number 2C, against 35 last week, 41 In
this week a year ago, 30 in 1596 and 37 in 1895.
DUN' 3 REVIEW OP TRADE.
NEW YORK. Aug. 19â R. O. Dun & Co., in
their Weekly Review of Trade, will say: A
war which brought no shrinkage of values
while It lasted hae brought with Its ending a
quite remarkable expansion. Orders and pur
chases have Increased In nearly all branches,
few as yet being of such nature that they can
be attributed to the material enlargement of
trade with the lately acquired Spanish islands,
which must come a little later.
It Is odd that the Iron industry, while re
porting declines in products, shows more sur
â¢ prising- gain in business than any other. Both
returns of output August 1 show considerable
i di-Teases from July 1. but more than the en
; tire decrease Is caused by the stoppage of two
ghen&ngo and four Mahoning furnaces under
agreement to force higher prices for Bessemer
: pig. In all other States showing change the
output increased, excepting for one furnace in
j Virginia. The demand for finished products
j expands remarkably, considering the enormous
! orders prior to July, which crowd some of the
i biggest works until December. Structural or
. ders include many bridges and the dnilnage
canal contract for 4000 tons at Chicago; plates
and bars are in stronger demand; nails have
! advanced Be and beams and angles as much
and bars 10c at Plttsburg. Tin plate Work.--,
which require 40,000 tons per month, have been
buying 160,000 tons of bars, and steel worka
there have bought 12'i,000 tons of pig. raising
i the price to |10 40. Gray forge also advanced,
and Eastern anthracite and Southern pig at
i Chicago have advanced 85c. There is a general
advance in miners' metals, copper to 12c for
lake, lead to $4 07Vi. and while tin and tin
plates are unchanged, both are stronger.
Shipments of boots and shoes in three weeks
of August are the largest ever known, though
but 1.4 per cent larger than in ls>93, being 10
per cent larger than last year and 16 per cent
larger than in 1892. In spite of the general
refusal of buyers to pay advances aafced pur
chases are continuous and keep works busy,
many having orders for a month or two ahead.
Leather hos slightly yielded In some grades,
1 with scarcely i:ny buying ahead of necessities,
and hides were a shade tower last week and
have not changed. There appears a gradual
accommodation of prices of, materials to the
i necessities of boot and shoe distributors.
I Such an adjustment Is needed in the woolen
I industry, for some mills are closing and others
are selling old stocks of wool, present orders
for dress goods not warranting present prices
for material. Vet other mills in equal number
are st.irt*ng on different lines of goods, and in
dress goods, instead of 90 per o?nt plain, a large
proportion of fancies has been taken, though a
* heavy auction sale, Just announced, may affect
' the demand.
Wheat has further declined 2c In spite of
i general holding of better grades by farmers,
which renders receipts low and visible supply
small beyond precedent. At 76 per cent now,
! Atlantic exports for the week have been 8.079,
j 3KO bushels, flour included, against 3. 7"". 2>-7 last
' year, and Pacific exports 175,400 bushels, against
384,846 bushels last year. maklriK for three
weeks 10.115,246 bushels, against 10, 453,532 bush
els last year.
Failures for the -week have been 154 In the
United States, against 223 last year, and 17 In
! Canada, against 30 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 19.â Liverpool sent higher
quotations for Wheat, but It was supposed to
be a mere reflection of yesterday's advance
hei-e and consequently did not Influence the
trading at the start. The shorts were evidntly
less anxious than they were yesterday and ap
parently more confident that there would bi
more Wheat before the last day of September
than hulls would want for legitimate purposes.
The weather In the Northwest was of the
same favorable character for securing the fine
'crop of spring Wheat that has generally fa
vored the operation since cutting commenced.
A Liverpool cablegram reported offerings of
new crop Russian and Danubian Wheat at
about the equivalent of from 2 to 4 cents a
bushel below the present price of shipping
rarcels of No. 2 Kansas hard Wheat. Tho sta
tistics of the day's movement, however were
by no means all in favor of the bears. Ke
reipts at primary Western markets amounted
to only 593.000 bushels, compared with 842,000
bushels a year api. The clearances of Wheat
and Flour from Atlantic ports were equal to
677 000 bushels and it was calculated that the
visible would show a decrease of 1.000,000
bxishels. The close was at a loss of l'ic'ior
September on the day and \c lower for De
cember Perfect weÂ»ther and large receipts
depressed Corn. There was a fair demand
from scalpers at the decline, but as the ses
sion advanced the general trade fell off in
volume and the market closed at the low point
for the day with a loss of \(f? 7 4c for Septem-
Oat* ruled steady on a small scalping trade
during the first half of the session, but finally
turned easy with Corn \<S%c down.
The execution of some heavy transactions In
Lard for export strengthened the whole pro

dation and a dip in prices, but that loss was
all recovered and something more. Pork and

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS, RAISINS, ETC.
| Apricots are higher again, but It does not
make much difference, as there are very few
in the State. Peaches and Pears continue
firm. New Apples have not opened yet.
Prunes are a puzzle. Everybody seems to be
afraid to touch them and no two persons have
the same idea as to the size of the crop.
Sales of the new crop are away below what
-they were at -this time last year. This Is a
good thing, for it rather tends to make a
firm and active market later on. The large
holders are generally refusing to . name a
price, and. th? re the matter stands. Free sales
might possibly be made at shading from
our quotations, but this holders refuse to do.

INDUSTRIAL GROWTH OF RUSSIA.
In 1870 thft population of Russia in Eu
rope wa? 65,700,?i59, or about 35 souls to the
square mile of territory. If Poland and j
Finland bo included, the total population '
will be increased to 73,."J04.r,92, but the dens
ity of population will not be changed, as
the dense settlement of Poland Is neutral-
Ixed by the sparse population of Finland.
In IM<7 the total population had increased j
to 10fi.lnft.141, of which 94488,750 were as-
Blgned to Russia In Europe, and thn dens
ity of the population had risen to 51 to the
.square mile. The returns of Russia in
Asia are naturally imperfect, but the cen- i
bus of 1597 Rave 23.052,000 souls, and the !
density of population about 4 to the
square mile. For the whole empire the !
density Is IS to the square mile.
This low iipure is due to Siberia, where ;
only 1.2 mark the population to the square â¢
mile, and to Central Apia, which gave
only 5.6 to the same territory. Poland is
the most densely settled (102 to tho square
mile), and Caucasia does not greatly differ
from the average for European Russia
<W.S to the square mile"*. If these figures !
(><â¢ compared with the returrts of the i
United States census it will he seen that I
European Russia has more than twice the |
density of population of the United States
(21.3); that Poland Is as thickly settled as i
N"w Jersey (193.8). and that New Mexico
equals Siberia in sparseness of inhabit
antsâPopular Science Monthly.

â /mutter how base the crime. During the
past few weeks it would almost appear
â¢as (hough the result of such leniency
â  were having- its inevitable effect.
When Stacey Rogers was confined in
â  the City Prison on the evening of mur
dering' his late companion, Halsey, he
calmly told the reporters that he had
-nothing to fear, as he could put up a
. pnod theory of self-defens".
Joseph Moffett when arrested was quite
indifferent as to his fate, and calmly said
that he did not fear the consequences, as
1 â â  believed his wife intended to attack
: him first.
â¢ Jimmy Bryan, while in the County .T.-, 1 ]
i awsUting Trial, acted as though the affair
wi:s the joke of his life.
â¢ .Quong Mow, the Chinese gardener who
. committed murder just before midnight,
talked to everybody at the City Prison
patly this morninp, as though murdering
:.a man for stealing three ears of corn were
.'.the most natural thing imaginable.
James M< adors, who murdered his tent
. mate at Camp Barrett three days ago,
calmly stated the day after the "murder
.that the affair was nothing to him; he
had killed one man and had been ac
.-â  quitted", as he said, "by twelve honorable
Jurors." He coolly stated that under the
'earae- circumstances he would repeat the
-' 'amp Barrett performance.
. In all this long black list there has been
.but- one variation. Benjamin Hill, who
murdered his wife two years ago, on the
. night of his arrest asked for a novel at
the City Prison, and before his victim's
. body was cold he told a reporter not to
.bother l:im by asking about the- murder,
a^ he was greatly Interested In his book
.which was "Mary, Queen of Scots"

breastbone, rupturing the aorta ond ln

Tlte widow of the dead man, Mrs An

last night; that he and her father, Frank
â¢â 'Hiycrs. afterward went for a drive
promising to return soon. She said that

with a corn thief. The officers had

LARGE FRESHMAN CLASS.
An Unusual Number of Students En-
tering for This Term.
BERKELEY, Aug; 19.â There will be a
large freshman class in the University of
California this year. As yet no final sta
tistics have been prepared, but the num
ber already applying for admission up to
date far exceeds that of the entering class
of laet summer. The Recorder's office
has now SCO applications on file, including
candidates for matriculation and for ad
vanced standing. Estimating the prob
able number to come within the next two
weeks, it is safe to assume that the c-lasa
of VM2 will overreach the 500 mark by at
least fifty or sixty. "* *"
This will make by far the largest body
of students thai has ever entered the col
lege at one time, and the professors and
members of the faculty are beginning to
fear that the already limited accommo
dations which the university has w ; |]
prove altogether too scant with this large
increase.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 20, 1898.
HELD COURT AT
THE HOSPITAL
Etta Haynes Testifies at
Cheeseman's Trial.
HE WILL PLEAD INSANITY
THE MURDERER'S FATHER IS
CONFIDENT OF ACQUITTAL.
Chief Fletcher Produces the Letter
Sent to Him by the Prisoner
Just After the |
Tragedy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 19.
Frank Cheeseman, who murdered Henry
J. Brooke a few days' ago, was before
Judge Allen this morning for his exami
nation. He was defended by Attorney
T. F. Garrity, who will rely for defense
on the plea of insanity. Cheeseman was
once in an asylum, but, according to Etta
Payne, the girl whom he tried to kill on
the night of the murder, Cheeseman con
fided to her that he merely affected in
sanity for the purpose of clearing himself
of a felony some years ago.
Mrs. Brooke, the widow of the murdered
man, was the first witness, and her testi
mony did not differ much from, that al
ready published. Ernest Dryer, a soldier
with whom Cheeseman conversed a rew
minutes before the tragedy, told of
Cheeseman's statement to him that, he
had been divorced from two wives al
r< ady and had a license In his pocket to
marry Etta Payne. In that conversation
Cheoseman also told Dryer that he in
tended "to do up the old man Brooke."
The witness said that there was nothing
about Cheeseman's manner that might
not to be explained by the fact that he
hail taken a few drinks.
Tony Salvador, another soldier, repeat
ed the story of his meeting with Cheese
man on the night of the murder, but he
threw no new light on the subject. Jene
Voorhees. the bartender of the saloon in
which Cheeseman was captured, said that
the murderer was too drunk when the
revolver was taken from him at the bar
to create any fear. Attorney Garrity ex
amined the witness for the purpose of
finding out his distinction between a crazy
man and a drunken man. Voorhees said
he had handled a few drunks but no in
sane people, arid as he had sold Cheese
man several drinks he knew that he was
drunk.
The photograph of Cheeseman -which
the murderer had mailed to the Chief of
I' 'ire after the murder was produced.
On the cover was written: "Catch me If
you can; I am right under your noses. I
will kill the girl on sight. You think me
(crazy. No. F. H. CHEESEMAN." On
the other side was written: "Here Is my
pictureâ the man who did the shooting.
if I see the girl I will kill her. F. H.
CHEEBEMAN."
The court adjourned to the Receiving
Hospital, where Etta Payne is still de
tained by reason of her wounds. Her tes
timony was the same as her story pub
| lished'in The Call at the time of the mur-
I der. The examination will be continued
i next Monday.
F. 8. Cheeseman, father of the mur
! fierer, said to-day that he would use every
i effort to clear his son. "Frank's mind
has been affected since he was 6 years
old." said the elder Cheeseman, "and I
had him placed In an asylum once for
six months, and he was discharged as
I cured. I don't- believe he can be cured.
They can't do anything with him but send
him back to an asylum. The girl loved
him as much as he loved her. Brooke
came to me one night and asked that we
keen Frank from going with Etta. He
said that Mrs. Brooke had consumption;
that he didn't expect her to live much
longer and that he then wanted Etta.

How the Body of Little Josephine
Lindsay Was Saved From a
Pauper's Grave.
The funeral yesterday morning of little
Josephine Lindsay, whose life was
crushed out underÂ«the wheels of a truck
last Tuesday, brought to light a deed of
open-hearted, unostentatious charity
which is well deserving of more than
passing notice.

War hfis no steady employment and pup
ports the family as best he enn by doing
odd jobs wherever he can pick them up.

to the attention of Al White of the un
dertaking firm of Porter & White, and he
at OTOereHeved the anxiety of the be
reaved parents by promising to stand all
the expense of the funeral. He lur
nished a neat little casket and white
hearse with carriages for the family, and
Tviid for a grave in consecrated ground
for the little, one. The father was over
come with emotion at this unlooked-for
generosity, and promises that if he ran
only get employment he will pay Mr.
\..,ite in full.

Keating and her husband, James Keat

March, was sentenced to three months
in the County Jail by Judge Wallace yes
terday. Prior to passing sentence Judge
Wallace criticized the action of the Jury
in having found the prisoner guilty of
simple assault. He said that he had in
structed the jury either to convict him
of assault to murder or to acquit him.
The court stated that he had heard some
talk recently of abolishing thn iury sys
tem entirely, and that certainly the Sul
livan case was not one that the advo
cates of the system could refer to in

EIGHTEEN DAYS.
Has Been Transformed Into a First-
Class Troop Ship and the Sol
diers Will Have a Pleas
ant Trip.
Thf> troops who embark on the United
States transport Arizona to-day will
cross the Pacific to Manila on the largest
steamer that ever entered the harbor of
San Francisco. This magnificent vessel,
THE TRANSPORT STEAMER ARIZONA.
formerly an Atlantic liner of the Guion
Company, is 475 feet long over all. and
450 feet keel. She is one of the hand
somest specimens of vessel architecture
afloat, her lines being very graceful. Her
speed is fifteen knots an hour. She will
reach Honolulu in six days and Manila
in twelve days thereafter. She carries a
crew of 130 men.
The cost of the Arizona was nearly a
million dollars. The price paid for her
by the Government is a secret. She re
quired no repairs, but several improve
ments have been made in order to con
vert her into a first-class troop ship.
There have been put in 1630 patent Turner
berths, which have been supplied with
comfortable mattresses and bed cloth
ing. The vessel is thoroughly ventilated
throughout, the ten compartments being
supplied with four electric fans each.
The troops will certainly have a most
enjoyable trip. An extra electric light
plant has been installed, furnishing 260
additional lights. A strong searchlight
has also been added to the equipment of
the vessel.
Captain J. Barneson, who was recently
appointed to the command of the Ari
zona, began life as a seaman in 1975 on
the Australian cuast. For five yearsâ
from 1880 to ISS5 â he sailed between Lon
don and Sydney, New South Wales. At
the end of this period he took command
of the ship George Thompson, running
tt r < Puget Sound, thereafter sailing be
tween America and Australia until I*3l,
when he engaged in the shipping busi
ness on the sound. For three y-ars ho
was Pilot Commissioner in the State of
Washington, and for four years he serv
ed as Deputy United States Shipping
Commissioner. His home is at Port
Townsend. where he was the agent for
Renton, Holmes & Co. of San Francisco.
The troops designated to sail on the
Arizona number 1206 men. They will
leave Camp Merritt some time this morn-
Ing and be on board before 4 o'clock this
afternoon. The vessel will then pull out
into the stream, and sail to-morrow
morning at about 10 o'clock.
Yesterday afternoon Company I of the
Eighteenth Infantry went on board to
act as a guard, relieving the guard from
the Fifty-first lowa, which returned to
camp.
FORMAL STEPS TAKEN.
The Claim of the Thomas
Family Against the Tennes-
see Regiment Is $3000.
In the case of the Thomas family, mal
treated by poldlers of the Tennessee
Regiment, formal complaint has been
filed with General Miller by Black &
Learning, counsel for the Afro-American
League, which is prosecuting the case.
The complaint asks that a board of offi
cers be appointed to fix the responsibility,
and suggests that a fair compensation
would be $6000. The damage to person
and property is lumped in one amount,
but under military law it will have to
be treated as two distinct cases. The
complaint nas been shown to Lieutenant
Barroll, Judge advocate of the independ
ent division, and It will now be formally
forwarded to Colonel Smith of the Ten
nessee Regiment, to ascertain if it was
the men of his regiment that were im
plicated in the affair. I'pon the report
of Colonel Smith that his men are the
responsible parties the board of officers
will be appointed by General Miller, un
der the fifty-fourth article of war, to as
sess the material damage done the prop
erty, and this will be paid pro rata by the
regiment.
As far as the damage done the person
of the Tnomua family is concerned, their
counsel -will have to Institute proceed
ings in some civil court. If they secure
judgment, then the property of the men
implicated can be attached, but their pay
cannot be touched. When the report of
Lieutenant Fowler, who is Investigating
the affair, is submitted to General Millar,
and charges have been formally preferred
by Colonel Smith, then General Miller will
cause the accused soldiers to be brought
before a court martial ami tried under
the sixty-second article of war, which
provides that soldiers guilty of the preju
dice of good order and military discipline,
shall be punished according to the nature
and degree of the offense and at the dis
cretion of the court. General Miller will
not make public the report of Lieutenant
Fowler.
A BRILLIANT CONCERT.
Given by the Fourth Cavalry
Band at the Presidio Yes
terday Afternoon.
The concert given by the Fourth Caval
ry Band, assisted by members of the
First Washington, Fifty-first lowa,
Twentieth Kansas and First Tennessee
regimental bands drew an immense
crowd of civilians to the Presidio yester
day afternoon. The concert was con
ducted by AY. S. Littleton, chief musician,
and the trumptfc corps was under the di
rection of Chief Trumpeter Sutherland.
The concert was an artistic success and j
Illustrated tho possibilities of a full regi- !
mental band, which was the primary ob
ject for which it was given. The opening
number was the march from "The Chief
tain" (Perkins), and was rendered with
tine effect. Haydn's "Symphony No. 2'
and the "Miserere" from "II Trovaton
were exceptionally fine, but the band best
demonstrated its "true spirit and scope In
its tone treatment of Handel's "Hallelu
jah Chorus" from "The Messiah." Sou
sa's "Semper Fldelis" was played with
un accompaniment of fifty trumpeters,
! and the effect produced by the volume of
such a large number of trumpets when
combined with the generalized harmony
1 of the whole band was decidedly Inspir
iting:. The crowd, the largest that has
ever attended a concert at the Pr<
numbering over 2000 persons, was enthu
1 siastlc in its approval of the concert, and
\ many expressed the desire for a frequent
j repetition of the entertainment.

LIEUT. PEART REWARDED.
The Patriotic Soldier From
Woodland Honored by the
Citizens of His Town.
CAMP BARRETT, SATKER TRACT,
Aug. 10.â The patriotism shown by Lieu
tenant Peart of Woodland in deciding to
remain with the Kighth Regiment instead
of trotting home with his disgruntled
company is Just being appreciated by
Woodland citizens. A purse had been
raised some time ago with a view of pur
chasing swords, sword knots, belts and
revolvers for the boys, but this money
was not so used when all the company
and officers, save Peart, returned In
stead, that which had been intended for
the whole aggregation haf> been showered
upon Peart alone. The committee which
raised the money has decided that the en
tire sum should be applied to the equip
ping of this patriotic lieutenant, and he
nas now been Instructed to make a pur
chase of an outfit, including revolver
bolster, etc., to be paid for with the
money raised and which is at his dis
posal.

' pate, who died at the division field hospi
tal on Wednesday, has telegraphed the
authorities here to have the body em
balmed and shipped to his home at Oak
land, Or. The authorities are not al

been- notified that the funeral will be de
layed twenty-four hours pending instruc
tions from him as to whether he will pay
the necessary expenses to be incurred in
carrying out his wishes.

'in Saturday afternoon, August 27, the
drill and field tactirs by the Eighth Cali

with which the Sixth California Regiment
bore so important a part. The drill is for
tii.- benefit of the work of the Army and
Navy Christian Commission.

HONORED A HERO.
The Gallant "Work of Frank Finlay at
Manila Remembered by His
Friends.
he members and friends of Martha
Washington Council No. 2. Daughters of
Liberty, held a grand jubilee last night
in honor of the heroic achievement of
Frank Finlay at the battle of Manila.
Th story of how Finlay, a private in
Company C, First California Volunteers,
brought ammunition across the field when
the fight was fiercest has already been
told and as he is a member of the
Daughters of Liberty and the Junior Or
der United American Mechanics his friends
in both organizations thought it fitting to
hoid a celebration at once in his honor.
The hall in the old Supreme Court build
ing was crowded, and the cclors of both
ordersâ rod, white and blueâ were worn
by nil present. The opening address was
made by Mrs. Bowley, deputy State or-
Kanizer of the Daughters of Liberty. Her
address was a fitting eulogism of Private
Finlay, and each time the hero's name
was mentioned the wails were shaken by
a storm of applause.
A short entertainment was given, con
sisting of a piano solo by Miss Mearns.
vocal solo by Miss Ollie Patterson and
two sketches, "Conglomorama" and "The
Ghost in the Pawnshop," by Messrs. Bab
cock, Holden and Wilcox, of Company B,
New York Volunteers, after which the
floor was cleared for dancing. A number
| of the most prominent young men of both
orders were missing, but their absence is

When the transport Australia sailed
for Manila she had four homing pigeons
on board, the property of H. C. Worth,
1310 Golden Gate avenue. Three were
liberated, but the fourth was kept until
the return of the steamer on Wednesday
morning last. When the shore was
sighted the bird was liberated, and true
to instinct it made a straight line for
its home, which it reached after a fly of
several miles. The bird had been con
fined In a small box for three months,
and it was a surprise to all to see It fly
so well.
Frank McConnell, the clever welter
weight, has broken away from Alexander
Greggalns, and will in future manage his
own affairs.
A match race of 100 yards was run at
Washington, Cal., last Sunday. The con
testants were W. L. Heyward of Alta

the Electric Laundry Company entered
into a contract in which the defendant
corporation agreed to furnish the Mer
cantile Toilet Company with all steam
power and water necessary to carry on
its business, the consideration for which
was $50 a month. On the Ist inst. the de
fendant corporation broke its agreement
and refused to further furnish the power,
it Is alleged, and the Mercantile Toilet
Company was forced to move its plant,
which resulted in its damage to the ex
tent of the sum sued for.

SEEKING FOR
A CLEW TO
THE FIEND
Police Investigate the
Dover Tragedy.
THE MURDERER IS A WOMAN
SAID TO BE A RESIDENT OF THIS
CITY.
Belatives of the Dead Woman Con
vinced That the Poisoned
Caramels Were Sent
"From Here.
The pnliro of this city have been asked
by the authorities of Dover, Del., to dc
aJI in their power to establish the identitj
of the fiend who is responsible for tht
poisoning nf Mrs. Dunning and her sister
Mrs. Deane. Both women died from eat
ing poisoned caramels which were sen)
them from this city. Yesterday Chief
Lees detailed Detective Ed Gibson tc
make an Investigation, but up to a latt
hour last night he had not succeeded ir
gaining a clew to the guilty party. Until
the wrapper in which the candy was in-
Closed arrives here the police do not ex
pect to ao much toward clearing up th<
mystery.
In the meantime, however, they Intend
to vigorously prosecute the search for the
mysterious "Mrs. C," who is supposed tc
be the sender of the deadly sweets. That
ehe Jives in this city the police have nc
doubt, as the package was sent from
here.
Mrs. B. Corbaley, a friend of Mrs. Dun
ning. Is incensed that her name should
be coupled with the double tragedy. She
â was a warm friend of Mrs. Dunning and
â¢was heartbroken when she learned of her
tragic ending. Mrs. Bothin, who lived in
the same house, was nJso on Intimate
terms of friendship with Mrs. Dunning.
She Is at present in Stockton.
It was first thought that she was the
blonde woman who was seen with Dun
ning at the race track, but subsequent in
vestigation revealed that Mrs. Bothin is
a pronounctd brunette.
The I 1I 1 ox which contained the poisoned
candy is oblong In shape and holds about
a pound. Around the ends are narrow
pink and Batin ribbons tied in a bowknot.
and on the top in gold letters are the
words "Bon Bons." The address is writ
ten in a cramped hand or with an effort
at disguise.
Inclosed in the box was a plain hand
kerchief with the price mark, 25 cents, in
one corner. The note, signed "Mrs. C. t "
J6 written in lead pencil, and the words,
"With love to yourself and baby," are
written jerkily and in an entirely differ
ent hand from the superscriptions. There
were two kinds of chocolate in the box,
one hard and similar to a confectioner's
make, and the other soft, with every ap
pearance of having been home-made.
The supposition is that the fiend pur
chased the box of candy, and, taking out
a small quantity, substituted the poisoned
caramels. Knowing Mrs. Dunning's
â¢weakness for candy, the guilty party con
ceived tho diabolical plan to put her out
of the way.
Every effort Is being: made by the local
police to ascertain whether or not Dun
ning, the husband of the dead woman,
had any love intrigues.
From their line of investigation it Is to
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

be inferred that they are reasonably cer
tain that a woman was the poisoner.
Yesterday Detective Gibson Interviewed
a number of race- track touts, with a view
of finding out if Dunning had any female
admirers. Dunning was a frequent vis
itor to the race track, and if he were as
sociating with other women it was rea
sonably certain that the inquisitive touts
would know of it. They, however, de
clared that while they knew Dunning
they had never seen him with any other
woman than his wife.

HISTORIC BLARNEY CASTLE AT THE IRISH FAIR.
Mechanics' Pavilion, With Every Nook and Cranny Reminiscent of the Land of the
Shamrock, to Be Thrown Open To-Night.
AFTER weeks of preparation, the great Irish Fair will open to-night at Mechanics' Pavilion, under the
patronage of the most prominent people in this city who claim the tight little Isle as their birthplace..
The big exposition building is dotted with the towers, castles, abbeys and lakes made familiar In song and
prose wherever English-speaking people are to be found. The various structures are exact reproductions of the
originals. Blarney Castle and the Blarney stone, credited with lending the. gracious touch of humor and a ready
tongue to all who press their lips upon it, occupy a <nmmanding position on the main floor. It towers sixty-two
feet above the floor, and presents a picturesque appearance embowered in trees.
The opening to-night will be attended with interesting ceremonies. A grand chorus of 500 voices, under the
direction of John W. McKenzie, will render "The Star Spangled Banner," "Killarney" and "God Save Ireland."
.Those In attendance are. expected to join in the choruses. Thousands of American flags will be distributed and the
scene should be an Inspiriting one.
The utilities as well as the beautiful will be presented. Silk looms and the machines of other industries peculiar
to Ireland will be in operation. The booths will all be filled with pretty girls in dainty gowns, many of them copied
from the fashions of a departed race. There will be no hawking of tickets about the floor of the exposition.
At Killarney Dingle booth the seductive ice cream will be dispensed by a corps of pretty girls.
There will be a real Jaunting-car, and the map of Ireland, formed by pieces of sod from all the counties. Owing
to the unselfish devotion of the ladie3 In charge of the various booths, the exposition is expected to prove a marked
success.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 20, 1898.
hereby respectfully requested to, assign
the blocks of State property bounded by
Davis, Pacific and East streets in this
city for the uso of car tracks and sheds
required by the free public market, the
same to be used also for the receipt and
delivery of ordinary merchandise so far
as It may be practicable and most con
venient for the producers of our State.
Filling in Islais Creek Bed.
By ;i persistent effort on the part of the
members of the Precita Valley Improve
ment Club the bed of Islais Creek Is be
ing gradually filled In to official grade.
Until this club, under the guidance of
John T. Graham, started the Improvement
or the valley, it was an offensive swamp
filled with stagnant water and decaying
vegetable matt'-r. Now it is becoming
habitable, and will In due time be prop
erly Improved. To this end the Super
visors are a.sked to appropriate a sum suf
ficient to beautify and lay out Bernal
Park, which standa in the center of the
valley.
Bryant street, from Twenty-fifth to
Twenty-sixth, is being paved and curbed
to grade. Simil.tr improvement is asked
for Florida, Alabama and Harrison streets
and Treat avenue from Bryant to Army.
In the meantime tne club has petitioned
for electric lights and a school building on
the slope of Bernal Heights.
Battered the Collector.
J. I. Macks, collector for J. J. Raver,
wont to the Terminal saloon, Haight and
Stanyan streets, yesterday morning, to
collect a bill from James Cairns, the pro
prietor. Instead of paying the bill Cairns
struck Macks and chased him out of the
saloon. Macks hurried to the City Hall
and swore out a warrant for Cairns' ar
rest on the charge of battery.
CAR TRACKS
TO BE TORN
UP TO-DAY
Second Onslaught on
Market Street.
CITY PERFORMS THE WORK
WILL PAY FOR REPAYING BE
TWEEN TRACKS.
The Second Contract With City
Street Improvement Company
Only A-waiting the Mayor's
Signature.
The two lines of horse car tracks on
Market street between Sixth and Eighth
ptreets will be torn up to-day by order
of Superintendent of Streets Ambrose.
A force of laborers in tho employ of the
city will be assigned to the job, and It
is expected to be finished by night.
This act will complete the taking up
of the Market-street outside car tracks
above Second street, leaving only the
double cable tracks in the center. Some
time ago the Market-street Railway
Company refused to remove the tracks,
stating that damages would be asked if
the removal was accomplished by tho
City. Mayor Phelan, however, ordered
the work to proceed.
The action has had the effect of reliev
ing the railway company of responsi
bility for paving the space between the
rails taken up. This fact is admitted by
the city, and a contract has been drawn
up with the City Street Improvement
Company, which only lacks the signa
ture of the Mayor, to pave with bitumen
two strips eleven feet wide and 3~t>f> feet
long on Mark'-t street between Becond
and Sixth, the strips to approach within
two feet of the outer cable rails on the
one hand and to join on the other the
seventeen-foot curb strip of bitumen re
cently put down by the same contractor
on Market street.
"The paving of this second strip will
begin as soon as the Mayor signu the
contract." said Street Superintendent Am
brose yesterday. "I know there will be
no hitch, for the Mayor favors the con
tract. The cost to the city will be
$13,476."
Car Company to Pave.
The secretary of the Merchants' Asso
ciation has received a letter from the
manager of the City Street Improvement
Company, stating that the Market Htreet
Railway Company is about to begin the
laying of a bitumen pavement for a dis
tance of two feet outside of its cable
tracks on Market street. The paving
company mentioned has the contract to
do the "work and the manager says that
he will begin operations at once. So
far nothing has been mentioned about
I the space between the tracks, although
' the car company has been ordered by
the Supervisors to pave all of the space
between and on the outside of the tracks.
Sacred Heart Church Entertainment.
The Young Ladies' Sodality of Sacred
Heart parish has arranged for a grand
entertainment at Metropolitan Hall on
Tuesday evening, 30th inst. The proceeds
of this entertainment will be for the
entertainment ot the sociality booth at
the church fair to be held In Ortober.
The new Sacred Heart Church is near-
Ing completion, and the young people of
the parish are unusually active in their
enrleavors to do their full share toward
liquidating the church debt.
Mails Open for Spain.
Postmaster Montague received the fol
lowing dispatch from Washington yes

sessions will be dispatched hereafter

coming in contact with the stone pave
ment. The bullet struck a cobblestone and
glanced off, striking him in the calf of the
right leg and coming out in front, where
it was found in his sock.
Captain Gillen had him removed to the
City and County Hospital, where the
wound was dressed and pronounced to be
superficial. The injury will necessitate
his retirement for a few weeks.
FOR A NEW CHURCH.
St. Patrick's Parishioners in Comic
Opera Entertain Their Friends.
A delightful comic opera was presented
by members of the ladies' charity booth
at Odd Fellows' Hall last night in
aid of St. Patrick's grand bazaar, which
will open September 2S. When the cur
tain rolled up on the first scene of the
"Dress Rehearsal" the hall was crowded
to its capacity. The applause of the audi
ence, unremitting throughout the even
ing, attested the merit of the perform
ance. Those who took part in the cast
are: Misses Mac Cavanaugh, Josephine
Crum. Mac B. Mulcan, Jessie Dubar,
Nome Sullivan, Mac Tilfer, Kathleen
Ryan, Ella Cronin, Margaret Kane, Mac
Carter, Josephine B. Mulcan, Emma
Geary, Maude Shortall, Nellie Kearney,
Fannie Hausman, Gertrude -annon, Wal
ter Young, Jack O'Brien, Will Rattlgan,
George Keane, Rob McCarthy, Matt
Leonard, Arthur Swan, Charles "V. Drady,
Harry Coleman, Frank Leonard, Will
Cathcart., J. Mclnerney, Ben Crawford
and Ed Moore.
Before the performance Rev. H. P. Gal
lagher, S. J., delivered an address on the
three cardinal elements of religion
faith, hope and charityâ and showed by
logical deductions how the three com
bined in the hearts of his parishioners
would be instrumental in bringing about
a new church for the parish, the object
of the grand bazaar.
EXCELLENT
OPPORTUNITY
FOR TOURISTS
TO PAY A VISIT TO ONE OF
CALIFORNIA'S POPULAR
RESORTS.
A Low Rate Excursion to the Rus
sian River ana
Ukiah.
In pylvan shades of fair Ukiah' s vales
A thousand beauteous scenes enchant the eye,
â \Vhere sparkling streamlets whisper fairy tales
( >( Indian romances long pone by.
There sliver spotted trout with golden salmon
In countless thousands 'neath the alder trees,
Where one may be In paradise the live-long
Soothed by the soft caress of cooling breeze.
Now In the autumn, when the summer heat
Hath yielded to the balmy Indian summer air,
No faithful guide can bring thy wandering
feet
Cats l.lylHc valleys half so fair.
The San Francisco and North Pacific
Railroad Company offers a special ex
cursion rate, San Francisco to Ukiah
and return, to-morrow (Sunday) of $2,
making the trip each way in four
hours.
Passengers leave the city at 8 a. m.
and returning reach here at 8:30 p. m.
They will therefore have more than
four hours in Ukiah in which to visit
its places of interest.
The road traverses the most delight
ful portion of Marln County and for
nearly fifty miles affords kaleidoscopic
views of the Russian River region with
its wealth of massive redwoods. The
ILkiah Valley is one of the most at
tractive in this section of the State.
Ukiah boasts in Gibson Canyon one
of the most weird and picturesque
I canyons in California. This is located
! only a mile from the heart of the city
! and in its shaded depths the fish hatch
i cries of the San Francisco and North
i Pacific Railroad are located. Over 700,
000 young fish of all varieties and va
ried stages of developments are now in
i the troughs, affording a novel and mi
i teresting sight.
The excursion now offered will be
| the only low rate trip this season af
| fording so instructive a visit to the
hatchery.
There will be an abundance of time
to visit the asylum for the insane and
the celebrated Vichy Springs.
The train is not to stop at stations
en route and every passenger will be
provided with a comfortable seat.
The Uklah excursions which as a
rule are made up semi-annually prob
ably surpass any other railway trip
out of San FranciÃCO in the variety
of scenery afforded, the rich section
through which the train passes, the
comfort of the traveler and the ex
cellence of service rendered.
Question of Freight Rates.
Railroad circles throughout the coun
try are agog over the meeting- of the
Transcontinental Freight Association to
be held noxt week at Denver, for it is
expected that the vexatious question of
freight-rate cuts will be settled to the
satisfaction of all concerned. A prom
inent official of one of the lines said
yesterday : "The association will have
to meet this question squarely or else
ignore it altogether, and by the latter
action surrender to the roads who per
sist in cutting rates. This has come to
be a most troublesome affair, and if not
properly settled is liable to disrupt rail
road relations that have hitherto been
regarded as amicable, and will result in
conditions that will be simply ruinous.
Earnest efforts will be made to bring
the Canadian Pacific Railway to some
sort of submission, for that line proba
bly more than any other has tampered
with freight rates to the detriment of
our competing American roads. Not sat
isfied with a differential which amounts
to practically 10 per cent, they persist
in going still further, and it is a fact
that they have slashed rates right and
left. I hope the question will be settled
for nil time, otherwise grave conse
quences will undoubtedly ensue."

Major Tilden Is Well.
A short time ago there was a rumor in
this city that Major Charles L.. Tilden of
the California Volunteers, who went to
Manila with the first expedition, was sick
or had been wounded. His friends here
did not believe that either was the case,
and their, belief has been verified by a
letter received from him yesterday by A.
Sbarboro, the banker. The letter was
dated at Camp Dewey on July 21, and
after requesting Mr. Sbarboro to give his
best wishes to friends in San Francisco,
the major says that his health is very
much improved and taat he has never felt
better in his life.
