SAX JOSE, Oct. 11.â Jim Rea was
Tinder a searching cross-examination
by Attorney Delmas to-day in the trial
of the Jnrman-Rea slander suit. The
â witness became flustered at times, and
It was difficult to keep him confined to
the answering: of questions. He was
very loquacious, and on several occa
sions answered Delmas rather sharply.
In the afternoon the court was obi
to admonish the witness to confine him
self to answering questions.
There was a larger crowd present
than on any other day of the trial, and
at times the proceedings were inter
rupted with a snicker, and Jud^e Klt
:â â  warned the spectators that un
less Quiet was maintained he would
have the courtroom cleared.
Rea talked politics and told how he
and Mackenzie had taken a hand in
municipal affairs. He practically ad
mitted he was I boss and con
: â  . . < louncil. He
declared that if any member of that
body disgraced him by doing wrong he
would walk into the Council chamber
and drag the member from his seat.
Rea toid how Interested he was in
having the city affairs honestly admin
1 and wanted none but pure of
ficiala in office. He wound up by tell
and purity of pur
.iid challenging any one to prove

has been the means of mulcting

nle" Mackenzie manage things in
the Council. The boss confessed to
meeting committees fruin the A.P. A-'s,
uctle
fleld Veterans. In speaking of his med
in political affairs and in City
Council matters witness used the pro
noun "we" with great frequency.
Rea was on the stand at the hour of
adjournment. It is thought he will be
under cross-examination a couple of
days longer.
When Rea took the stand this morn
ing Delmas opened the proceedings by
askiny:
Mr. Rea, returning to these conversa
tions with Mr. Maggard, I desire you to
State to me the tirst conversation you
had with him in any manner, shape or
form relating to a roller of any kind.
First of all, ;1x as accurately as you can
the date or the time of that conversation.
Reaâ The first conversation I had with
Mr. Maggard in reference to the steam
roller was in the neighborhood of the Ist
day of June, 1897. The city had not then
purchased the roller.
Was that out at the Gay quarry?
That is my recollection of it.
Is that your quarry?
No, sir.
Did you not. In speaking of the quarry,
did you not so denominate It?
1 don't know whether I did or not.
Did you say, ".My quarry, my rock"?
1 think so; I said that to Mr. Jarrnan.
Was it your quarry or your rock?
No, not exactly. I have an interest
in it.
How big?
Mr. Morehouse objected to this ques
tion and the objection was sustained.
Did I understand you to say that at that '
time Mr. Maggard offered you the roller
for $2750?
No. sir.
Three thousand dollars, then, he offered
It to you for?
Yes.
Now, then, on the lGth or thereabouts
he came again?
Yes, sir; he came to see me.
And that was the first intimation that
you had of anything going wrong, or any
Improper practice with reference to this
:
Yes, air.
Tell us that conversation in full.
He said that they were standing him up
for $250 extra. I said, "What?" lie said,
"They art- standing me up for $250 extra."
I said, "Mr. Fay and Isolting, are they
standing you up?" He said, "No, but
they are wrong, I think." I told him
that I had seen Mr. Nolting and he said
he was going to vote for it. "Fay is
wrong," he said; "he is kicking." I said,
"Has Mr. Fify asked you for any
money?" and he said, "No." I said,
"Mr. Nolting?" "No." I said, "Have
you agreed to pay them any?" "No."
I asked him then if Mr. Hogan, Mr. Man
grum or Mr. Main had stood him up or
asked anything from him. "No," he
Bald. That settled that part of It in my
mind, and be wanted me to see Mr. Fay.
That is what he said. I said, "Who are
standing you up?" He tola me Mr.
Kreig. I said. "What is the situation;
what arrangements have you made?" He
said, "I have exhausted all the surplus,
or made arrangements to exhaust all the
surplus, $750, in this matter, and I won't
Stand the raise." I said. "I have got
nothing to do with that, but." I said "I
â will see Mr. Fay," which I did.
The next day, It might have been I
went to see Mr. Maggard and I told him
that Mr. Fay would not vote for it.
'You advised Mr. Fay?"
"We agreed not to vote for itâ that is,
Mr. Fay and myself."
"You agreed?"
"Well, 1 saw Mr. Fay."
"What did you decide? "Were you of
the Council?"
"I was not; no, sir."
In telling further of the talk he had j
with Maggard Rea said he had tried to i
locate where the money had been paid j
to influence the purchase of the roller, i
What did you want to locate it for?" ;
asked Delmas..
"Because I am in politics, and when
ever I locate a man who- Is receiving
money either as a public oflicial or out- i
side of public office for his political in- i
fluence I mark him about all the way |
from 7u per cent to zero, and when poli
tics come up again I turn his picture
to the wall and proceed accordingly."
In what way are you in politics Mr.
As a citizen of the city of Ban Jose, to
protect the public treasury from the in
roads of scoundrels, and. sir, to see that
honest and efficient people are in public
places. 1 never In my life received one

Captain McKenzie prevented a panic. Finally she was towed out of danger by the ferry
steamer Tibur.n, commanded by Captain White.
a public body, and a man that does, in
my opinion, is unfit to be an American
citizen; that is my reason, sir.
Are you boss, Mr. Rea?
I am so reputed by my enemies; but in
fact, no sir. If I was a good many men
wouldn't have the offices they have.
You never then call yourself boss?
1 nave always claimed to the contrary.
You never posed as boss?
I never have, no, sir. 1 despise a boss
in the sense that I am reputed to be a
boss.
In the sense you have been reputed to
be a boss. What do you mean by that?
1 mean that at that time, for instance,
that Mr. Jarman and his confreres went
to San Francisco. They did it to remove
themselves from the influence, the cor
rupt influence of a "boss" who was try
ing to dictate to them the appointments
of the city. My position was that I did
not have any appointments to dictate to
them, that I was only a citizen and that
there were all these different elements
that wanted these positions. 1 didn't
wazit them myself; tnat was my position.
But their position was that I was trying
to dictate to them, which was nor true.

I got a Good Government Club document
that I would like to read and that will ex
plain it better than I can.
The court objected to him reading the
document, which was a copy of the
"Weekly Letter, which was formerly
published here. '
Rea, who thus posed as a lover of
purity in municipal affairs, knew of
money being used in the Council, but
made no effort to stop it. This caused
Delmas to inquire why he had not
taken steps to prevent this wrong be
ing perpetrated on the city.
"Oh, it was not a great wrong." ans
wered Rea. "I did not consider it to
be a great wrong: it was only to the
amount of a few hundred dollars. I con
sidered It a -wrong in the sense that it
was being done, and I did not consider
that from my position and the position
of my friends who were in this com
munity it would justify me in creating
a public scandal at that time, which I
would get the worst of in some way
or other. My motives are all miscon
strued, and I have to be careful, and
when I find a man is wrong I have got
to be careful on account of libel suits.
I have got to be careful about my talk.
I have got to be so careful that the
only way you can avert these things Is
simply to oppose them in politics, to
fight them in politics and see that you
do not get hurt yourself."
"How did you oppose this?"
"I didn't oppose it particularly. I
went down and talked to Fay and
found he was going to oppose it, and
then told him that was the only thing
to do."
The witness continued to get <\>-< per
and deeper in the tangle. He brought
up Johnnie- Mackenzie's name and
proved to the satisfaction of nil that
the Game Warden was his trusted lleil
t<!iiiiit. He stati-d that he had turned
the matter of having the fire limits
changed so that the R^inhart Tmlldings
could be rebuilt of wood over to Mac
kenzie, who had engineered It through
the Council. H^ paid Jarman received
the painting of these buildings with
out competition and if there was any
competition it was simply a farce.
The i>ajntiner of the City Hall and
fire engine houses was also touched
upon. He denounced .Tarman for doing
the work while a city official. Rome of
the painters who were employed by
Jarman on the work with the under
standing that they would support him
for Supervisor, Rea said, had voted the
pang ticket.

MINNEAPOLIS. Oct. 11.â The Jour
nal staff correspondent at Caas Lake,
! Minn., wires!
Indian runners from the south passed
here in the night going north and from
them information of a more serious na
ture than anything heard heretofore
was obtained. The hostiles at Bear
Island have already learned that Gen
eral Bacon intends to attack them with
in forty-eight hours and are busily pre
paring to resist. The Indians are well
posted on everything that goes on at
Walker and at the agency. They are
strongly entrenched and have sent out
insulting messages to the whites. Their
runners are busily urging reinforce-
I ments from other branches of the tribe.
There have passed down the waterways
to Leech Lake in the past three days as
many Indians as there have soldiers
come in on the railroad.
A village passed up Cass Lake this
morning and seventy others are now
I camped eight miles northwest from
I here. Women and children are going
i steadily northward.
Twenty canoes of bucks, four in
â  each, went up the Mississippi River into
Leech Lake last night. It is estimated
by the woodsmen here that at least 500 j
reds, who will join the hostiles on the
slightest encouragement, are now with
in striking distance of Leech Lake dam.
Chief Chippewa, Pine Estimator See

I He brings the most alarming reports
i yet. He said :
"Bacon will make another attempt in

to get the Indians or their bodies. If
he does neither the reds will make a
break north for the Big Fork country.
He cannot follow them and they will
have time to do awful damage to the
settlers, straggling villages and rail
j road property as they flee. I consider
j the situation extremely critical both

pines NbT TOUCHED.
American Officials at Washington
Confident That the Negotiations
Will Have a Satisfactory
Outcome.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11.â The Peace
Commissioners In Paris, so far from
reaching a point of absolute variance
on the question of the Philippines, have
not yet taken up that subject for con
sideration.
It is true that at the very first ses
sion of the joint commission the Span
ish representatives sought to raise a
question concerning the occupancy of
Manila Bay and town by the United
States military and naval forces. The
United States Commissioners promptly
refused to consider this point in any
aspect, and with some reluctance the
Spaniards pave over for the time be
ing the effort to raise that issue.
Since then the commission, whenever
meeting jointly, has beun engaged en
tirely with three questions to the com
plete exclusion of the Philippines.
These questions relate entirely to Cuba,
Porto Kico and Guam, and according
to the very best reports from the Amer
icans to Washington they are still un
der consideration.
The United States will not assume
any financial indebtedness .is the result
of the cession or release of Cuba and
Porto Rico. It was fully expected by
the authorities here that the Spanish
contingent on the Peace Commission
would make a strong effort to have the
assumption of the heavy financial obli
gations of these islands made the con
dition of the cession of Porto Rico and
the abandonment of sovereignty over
Cuba. But the American Commission
ers were fully and definitely instructed
on these points, and the general tenor
of these instructions was that such ob
ligations were not to be assumed by the
United States.
No dissatisfaction is felt here at the
progress of the commission in the set
tlement of the questions assigned to it.
It was fully understood that the issues
presented would require the most deli
cate and cautious handling, and while
the American Commissioners were ex
pected to deal with these with the
greatest firmness it was realized that
much consideration must be shown for
thf Spanish Commissioners, who would
be obliged at least to make an effort to
secure an abatement of the American
demands in order to satisfy public feel
ing at home.
It can be stated that there has beÂ«n
no diminution in the confidence of the
administration In the satisfactory out
come of the peace negotiations at Paris.
When that city was selected for the
meeting place by the Peace Commis
sioners at the most earnest and re
peated prayer of M. Cambon, it was
understood that the American Commis
sioners would be obliged to bear up
against a strong pressure from the pro-
Spanish element in the French press,
but this had all been discussed before
the Commissioners sailed from Amer
ica, and the President was satisfied
that the men he had selected to repre
sent the United States were of sufficient
individual strength to resist any out
side Influences.

TIME LIMITS PLACED
ON THE SPANIARDS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11.â The Ameri
can Commissioners have notified the
Spanish authorities in Havana that the
United States will assume entire con
trol, military and governmental, of the
island of Cuba December 1. The same
control will be exercised in Porto Rico
October 18.
The Commissioners have notified the
Spaniards that all port and customs
receipts and the management of muni
cipal affairs will pass into the hands of
the American military commander in
the island. This order was not intend
ed to work hardship to the Spanish
tn>ops or Government, but it was
thought best to fix a definite time to
end Spanish rule and to begin opera
tions under the United States. It is
probable that United States troops will
go to Cuba before that time. By De
cember 1 it is expected to have troops
so stationed that there will be no need
of Spanish troops to preserve order.
The proclamations that have been is
sued by the President, establishing
customs rates and denning the manner
in which Cuban territory shall be gov
erned, will prevail until it becomes ap
parent that new regulations are needed.
On October IS Major General
Brooke will assume absolute control of
the island of Porto Rico. It is possible
that all the Spanish troops will not
have left Porto Rico at that time; if
so, they will be quartered in barracks
until they can be taken away. In the
language of Secretary Alger, the Unit
ed States will be host and the Span
iards the guests after October 18. The
United States will not ship the re
maining troops to Spain at its own ex
pense. That was no part of the pro
tocol. The custom houses, the money
received for customs and the govern
ment of the island will pass completely
from Spanish control on the date set.
The present customs regulations under
proclamation of the President will pre
vail.

MUST PROVE
HIS WORTH
TO WED HER
Nuptials of Charles A. Williams,
South African Millionaire,
Postponed,
An Unenviable Record That the Dashing
Mine Owner Will Find Difficult
to Disprove.
The wedding of Charles A. Williams, the South
African mine owner, which was to have taken place
this afternoon, has been postponed until such time
as he can prove that his character is above reproach.
From all parts of the world comes con
firmation of the bad record of Charles
A. Williams, the alleged wealthy South
African mine-owner, with whom one of
the most popular and certainly one of the
handsomest of San Francisco's belles was
to have -nked her fair name this after
noon.
The astounding reveiations made in re
gard to Williams startled, though they
did not astonish, the select circles In
which he and his fiancee moved.
For more than a week the story In in
complete form has been upon the street,
and all well known club and society men
have been discussing it in its many and
devious phases.
The rumored story was at its best but
patchy. The gossipy seed was sown,
strewn broadcast and the crop reaped,
and each stalk bore a vastly different
though interesting story.
Unlike the usual tale of the soldier of
fortune, the social highwayman or daring
adventurer, there was lacking in all the
accepted versions that element of honor
where woman is concerned. This man
used woman to further his adventures.
The story of the change of name was
culled from the alleged authentic source
oi Williams' own suueinent. An orphan
of tender years, reared to healthy, sturdy
boyhood by a maternal uncle, and tho
name of White, in loving recognition, was
doffed for Williams. There was a pa
thetic side to this adopted-name story,
and it was, on account of its appealing
popularity, immediately adopted and pro
mulgated. The most remarkable part of
all the gossipy tit-bits, however, faded
into Insignificance beside the astonishing
fact that no man told either wife, sister
or sweetheart.
Feminine society regaled itself with the
unusual circumstances surrounding the
engagement and proposed hasty marriage,
the munificence of the bridal gifts of a
more than devoted lover and the untold
wealth that would be the fair young
bride's. Man discussed the mysterious,
revolting stories, and lacking the neces
sary proof to back up all he heard, dis
creetly neld his tongue.
The public exposure of Williams' dual
existence comes as a relief to all. The
sterner sex felt relieved of a weighty
responsibility, and to woman was ex
plained many things that she wanted
to but could not understand. Williams'
social career was marked by rare tact
and unusual good taste.
His dress â the apparel that should pro-
claim the manâ was in the best of form.
He wore his clothes like a man accus
tomed to the demands of fashion. He en
tertained like the worthy scion of a noble
house. His wines were also just so. lue
flowers he sent were exquisite. Every
thing he did proclaimed the wealth tuat
covers the vulgarities of mere money.
His tastes were modest. The obstreper
ous, the boisterous, did not appeal to
him. To a dainty young bud who laughed
aloud in the corridors at Hotel Del Monte
he gently said: "Don't laugh out loud.
You are no longer a child, but a young
woman. Never laugh out loud."
Mammas with marriageable daughters
overwhelmed him with attention. He was
asked everwhere. All the country homes
were open to him, and there is no doubt
that he might have had almost any girl
for the asking.
The only perceptible drawback to a gen
tlemanly manner were awkward slips of
the tongue. "Youse" and "dem" slurred
themselves easily upon his lips, while
now and then his subjects and predicats
rebelliously disagreed.
However, these slips of the tongue only
added to the romantic halo the girls built
round the magnetic personality of the
millionaire from South Africa. Grammat
ical lapses but emphasized the fact that
a struggling man had forged his way by
force of intellect and Industry to the
front, and had come off triumphant with
diamond mines galore and untold wealth
to tell the tale.
Williams' personality was not a small
factor in gaining for him Immediate social
recognition. There is a magnetic some
thing about the man that appeals to
woman, and a good square chin, clear,
piercing blue eyes and dictatorial manner
make up an ensemble that the majority of
fair ones admire.
His generosity added to the good favor
with which he was accepted. Even yes
terday, with the town all agog at the re
markable disclosures, attention still
turned to the magnificent necklace of
pearls, "with diamond bars, gorgeous
rings and bracelet of brilliants that form
a minor part of his princely gifts to the
fair fiancee.
The Plnkertons have been investigating
Williams.
A prominent Chicagoan now in this city
said last night: "I am perfectly familiar
with the history of Williams' life in Chi
cago and Wyoming. The story published
in The Call yesterday Is true in every de-
tail.
It is a reproduction of the official rec
ords on file in the various police offices of
those cities. The man Is well known, as
there Is not the slightest doubt as to his
Identity. The Charles A. White charged
with many crimes Is the Charles A. Wil
liams now In this city.
The following additional information
from Cheyenne regarding the life of Mr.
Williams in Wyoming was received in this
city yesterday:

ported attempt of Charles A. White to
form a matrimonial alliance in San Fran
cisco by questionable means. His expe
riences here were of such a character tnat
when he left word was Bent h!m that he
would be lynched should he return. His
victim in this place was Mrs. Emma
Nagle, widow of Erasmus Nagle, who died
in IS9O leaving: an estate of about half a
million dollars. His only surviving heirs
were his widow and a boy of thirteen.
Mr?. Nagie was about 35 years of age at
the time of her husband's death, fcshe lived
in a hajidsome stone house which had cost
her husband $50,000. About eighteen
months after Nagle's death Mrs. Nagle,
while on a visit to Hot Springs, Ark., met
Charlie White. He was good-looking,
posed as a literary man, and claimed to
have an income of $10,000 a year.
Mrs. Nafde was captivated by him and
an engagement followed. One of the
features of this was that Mrs. Nagle
bound herself to pay White $100,000 in
the event of a marriage between them.
Some time in the year lSi>l Mrs. Nagle
returned to Cheyenne and in a short time
White also appeared. Mrs. Nagle short
ly afterward w^nt to a prominent lawyer
in Cht yei< t, vw o had h-.-^n Mr. Nagle's
adviser, and req'iested him to draw up a
marriage contract to be given to White,
in which she bound herself to pay to him
the $100,000. The lawyer remonstrated
with her, but she brought the controver
sy to a conclusion by asserting that If
the lawyer wouldn't draw up the contract
she would go elsewhere and have It
drawn up, and drawn it was. Mrs Nagle
in it agreed to pay to White, "for the
purpose of extending his business," the
sum of $100,000 in the event that the mar
riage took place.
She at once signed the contract and de
livered it to White. The marriage took
place shortly afterward. For a few
months events moved along smoothly.
The estate of Mrs. Nagle or Mrs.
White's first husband had not been aa
yet settled, and all she had was the al
lowance paid her by the court. Under
the laws of the State of Wyoming, Mr.
Nagle having died intestate, half his
property went to the widow and half to
lais boy. Not long after the marriage,
however, White began to take considera
ble interest in the estate matter and
commenced to urge Its speedy settle
ment. He also commenced to take con
siderable interest in the boy's matters,
and flanlly made an attempt to have his
guardian, one W. A. Robins, removed,
and to have himself appointed.
About this time, too, It was noticed )
that Mrs. White did not appear very
often in public, that most of her time
was spent at home. White was about a
great deal, and spent money freely. He
expressed his intention of taking part in
politics and of helping run the Demo
cratic party of the State.
In the early spring of 1892 affairs
reached a crisis. White had engaged at
torneys to press the settlement of the
Nagle estate and also to attempt the
removal of his stepson's guardian. In
the latter he was not successful. In
August, 1893, the estate was finally set
tled. White, in the meantime, secured
from his wife a power of attorney and
under it he drew what money he wanted
from her bank deposit. Shortly after
this he took a notary to his house, where
his wife signed a note and mortgage to
him for J75,u00. The room was darkened
in which the transaction took place, and
Mrs. White afterward explained it waa
to hide the fact that White had black
ened her eyes before the notary came, a
few days later Mrs. White was given
$i<5,000 in bonds and securities by the ad
ministrators of the Nagle estate.
Just how White secured possession of
them has never been learned. He had
them the next morning and that evening
left for New York. This was the last ever
seen of him in Wyoming. Shortly after
White left his wife told her story to a
lawyer. An investigation showed her
husband had taken with him in mort
gages, bonds, notes and securities about
one hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
This was in September, 1592. Notice waa
at once given to atop negotiation of the
securities and criminal suits were com
menced against White for embezzlement
and larceny. A requisition on the Gover
nor of New York tor White was issued.
White fought it in the courts and waa
defeated. He had been told that he would
be lynched if he came back to Cheyenne,
and rather than come he forfeited hia
bail, ten thousand dollars in cash, and
fled to South America and later to South
Africa.
Mrs. White in her. suit for divorce,
which was granted, proved that White
had frequently knocked her down and
had several limes struck her In the face,
and once had driven her from her home
at night. The indictments against White
remained In the hands of the authorities
here until about a year ago, when the
charges were dismissed, it having been
represented that White had reformed. In
the legal nght over granting a requisition
for White in New York it was learned by
the officers who went from here that
White's true name was Williams and
that his mother was employed in a col
lar and cuff manufactory at Troy.

GAGE'S TOUR OF
THE SAN JOAQUIN
ONE BIG OVATION
Tulare and Visalia in
Line.
TWO GREAT DEMONSTRATIONS
OLD-LINE DEMOCRATS JOIN IN
THE WELCOME.
The Republican Standard-Bearer and
Colonel Preston Deliver Ad
dresses Before Large
Gatherings.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VISALIA. Oct. 11.â The journey of
Henry T. Gage and K. F. rreston
through the greal San Joaquin Valley
Is distinguished by a succession of pop
ular ovati<>;;s. Never <li<l a candidate
for Governor of California receive a
greater tribute to his worth and pop
ularity than that which the masses of
the people accord to the Republican
standard bearer in this campaign. A
remarkable feature of each demonstra
tion is the obliteration of party lines
and a union of industrial forces in sup
port of the champion of honest money
and honest dealing with the people.
Whatever illusions or delusions the
farmers and others of Tulare may have
entertained on the subject of finance,
they stand in now for sustaining the
administration of I>resident McKinley
and resisting the single tax scheme of
James G. Maguire.
Here in the erstwhile stronghold of
the fusionists, which gave Bryan an
Immense majority, the Republicans are
confident and enthusiastic. Tulare
County gave Bryan a majority of 1365
and gained the doubtful distinction of
being the banner Bryan county of ('uli
fornia. Twn weeks ago the fusionists
In this campaign set up a claim that
they would give Maguire SOO majority
in Tulare. Republicans are making
â¢wagers that Ma not ci rry the
county by 300 majority. Republicans
whose Judgment may be clouueu v.> Lue
immense enthusiasm for Gage are pre
dicting a triumph of the Republican
ticket in Tulare County.
When hundreds of old line Democrats
like K. O. Miller, James Fisher and
George McCamm openly avow their in
tention to vote for Gage and prosperity
the single taxera take alarm u;ul Re
publicans take courage. The opposi
tion forces agree that the Bakersneld
mass meeting un Monday night, when
thousands cheered for Gage and Neff,
was a marvelous outpouring of the
masses in support of Republican prin
ciples.
Earl- this morning Mr. Gage and
Colonel Preston, escorted by A. Young,
left Bakersfield for Tulare. There was
an ovation on every station of the
journey. At Delano Mr. < lage alighted
fium the train and received the greet
ings of a large throng of people who
had assembled at an early hour to give
him words of good cheer. On his ar
rival at Tulare the scenes of enthusi
asm which made the tour of southern
counties so memorable were again en
acted. Cannon b<">med, the bands
played patriotic music and the popu
lace cheered. The Tulare City Repub
lican League Club, 200 strong, headed
by the band, marched through tht
streets escorting Gage and Preston
from the depot to the Central Hotel.
In front of the hotel a large assem
blage was addressed by the standard
bearer. Mr. Gape did not make a long
speech, but thanked the people for the
generous welcome. He accepted the
demonstration not as v tribute to him
self, but as an indication of the earn
est devotion of th>- people to the cause
of clean politics ami honest govern
ment.
! iple in the audience inquired about
the single tax. and Mr. Gage in a few
vords explained the revolutionary
scheme of placing the whole burden ot
tolls on farmers, land owners and min
ers.
It was a significant fact that many
ladies marched in the procession from
the Tulare depot to the hotel. Gage
and Preston were in Tulare from 9 a. m.
until 2p. m. to-day. The whole time
was occupied in responding to thfe
friendly advances of the people. One
of the happiest events was the recep
tion in a storeroom of the hotel build
ing. The ladies of Tulare decorated
the room with flowers and plants, the
national colors in streamers were fes
tooned In artistic style and the flag it
self was displayed conspicuously. Th"
Tulare quartet of male voices saner.
Peven or eight hundred citizens railed
to pay their respects to the next Gov
ernor.
Among the leadia*- citizens who par
ticipated in the demonstrations wÂ«r<v.
M. C. Zumwalt, Senator Linder, J. J.
Cairns, C. R. Scott, W. H. Jones, presi
dent of the Republican League; P. J.
S. Montgomery, E. Sadler, A. W. Fet
trony, Judge Davis, H. M. Shreve, F.
Rosenthal, E. T. Cosper, John Toohy,
Dr. T. D. Blodgett Captain White of
Visalia and W. P. Ratliff. State Central
Committeeman from Tulare County.
The reception was prolonged until the
noon recess of the common school. One
of the most agreeable incidents of the
ovation was the visit of the pupils â
boys and girls â and their introduction
to Mr. Gage.
After luncheon carriages were pro
cured and Gage and Preston driven
through the groves of oak and poplar
to Visalia, the capital of Tulare Coun
ty. The drive was delightful, the at
mosphere agreeable and the singing of
the larks enchanting. As soon as the
arrival of the standard bearer was her
alded through the city throngs of peo
ppople convened at the Palaefe Hotel to
grasp his hand. In order to gain a lit
tle rest and reserve some strength for
the great mass meeting to-night, Mr.
Gage was constrained to limit the af
ternoon reception to one hour's time.
The seating capacity <rf Armory Hall
was Increased to accommodate an Â«u
disoce of 1000 people. Before the hour
appointed for the opening exercises the
committee perceived that the hall would
not hold half the number of those who
were anxious to hear the next Governor
and his companion, E. F. Preston. The
beautiful decorations of the hall excited
the admiration of those who were for
tunate enough to gain admission. Credit
for the artistic arrangement of the
bunting inside and ot the street en
trance belongs Ur Charles T. Lindsey,
J. <:. Martin and Ed Dobsoo and their
assistants, Mrs. S. B. Hunt, Mrs. C. T.
Lindsey. Miss Lil Hunt, Miss Pet Stu
art and Miss Fannie Rogers.*
Among the Republicans who actively
participated in the management of the
demonstration were Charles O. Lam
berson, chairman, and Captain H.
White, secretary, of the County Central
Committee; D. Q. Overall, John Chat
ton. A. J. Hump, N. B. Rpraguo. Vl
salia; R. W. McDonald. J. E. Shuey,
Porterville, and Jeff la Martina, Wood
ville.
Early in the evening delegations ar
rived from Porterville, Exeter, Tu
lare, Wuodville, Orosi, Dinuba, Traver,
Goshen and Hanford. The renowned
Hanford Glee Club, Miss Nathelle Rog
ers accompanist was an attraction ut
the meeting. The Tulare band joined
the Visalia band in rendering patriotic
music.
There were no bonfires, cannon firing
or skyrockets to intensify the enthusi
asm. The news, however, had spread
like wildtire throughout the country
that Henry T. Gage, of the people and
for the people, would talk in an honest,
straightforward fashion at Visalia to
night, and so the farmers hitched up
their teams and came to town, bring
ing with them their wives and children.
The meeting was called to order by
Charles G. Lamberson, who introduced
as president of the occasion W. P. Rat
liff of the State Central Committee,
Mr. Katliff acknowledging the compli
ment in a graceful but brief speech.
As on all oeasions of this campaign the
introduction of Henry T. Gage excited
great applause and prolonged cheering.
In his spec.'- to-night Mr. Gage fol
lowed the lines of argument and com
ment to which he adhered in his mas
terly address at Bukersfield. He re
sented Maguire's assault on the integ
rity of the men who composed the Re
publican State convention at Sacra
mento. Speaking for himself Mr. Gage
remarked that he had faith in the hon
esty of men and the virtue of women.
A shout of approval was the response
of the audience to the noble sentiment.
The record of Maguire on the railroad
settlement was again presented in a
lucid and forcible manner. The people
at Ylsaiia were convinced that Maguire
had been trying to "fool" them; that
he could have defeated the amendment
to which he now objects by a simple
word of objection when the measure
was under consideration. The single
tax scheme was reviewed and its dan
gers to the State were set forth. The
people listened with profound attention
to Mr. Gage's review of this hobby of
the socialists.
I The standard-bearer promised 11
| elected Governor to give to the people
of California a clean, honest and busi
; ness-like administration of the office.
Maguire's unpatriotic attitude toward
! the war revenue measure was dis
! cussed. References to the heroism of
j the American soldier and the successful
i and patriotic administration of Presi
dent McKinley evoked mighty shouts of
applause from the loyal people of Tu
lare County.
Mr. Gape spoke for an hour and a
half, maintaining the close attention of
the vast audience. The enthusiasm of
his hearers was unbounded. The sing
ing of the Hanford Gage and Neff Glee
Club afforded much delight. Reference
; to the Valley railroad cutting fares and
; freights in two called out a thunder of
! applause.
Hon. E. F. Preston was introduced as
| the next speaker and was hailed with
â¢ enthusiastic demonstrations of wel
â  come. He remarked that he was an
I American and a Californian. He did
I not speak for the Valley Railroad and
j the Valley road did not send him here
Ito speak. The Valley road was not a
close corporation, but was composed of
many men of varying shades of opin
ion on political subjects. Mr. Preston
said he had political opinions and ex
perssed them before the road was in
corporated, and proposed now and
hereafter, as an American, a Califor
| nian and Republican, to speak his sen
i timents in an open and frank style, and
| no one should call him down by inti
: mating that the Valley road was in
! politics.
Speaking of politics, he regarded it
i essential that California should elect a
j Republican Legislature to send to the
j United States Senate a Senator in sym
pathy with the noble administration of
William McKinley. The President's
recognition of Illustrious Confederate
j leaders was referred to, and the refer
â¢ ence won from the vast assemblage
tumultuous applause and rousing
cheers.
Mr. PreÃton did not claim the war
was a Republican war. It was an
I American war. The glorias and achieve
j ments of the conflict belonged to the
whole people.
Mr. Preston then took up a letter
written in 1596 to the Examiner by Ma
guire, in whi^h the "Little Giant" de
clared that the single tax battle would
be on when an amendment to the con
stitution was presented. A Maguire
speech in Congress was quoted, in
which the single tax was put forth as
the only remedy for business depres
sion. The speaker's comprehensive re
view of the single tax question â the
rank socialism of Henry George â re-
I eeived profound attention. It was ex
plained that the doctrine was not new;
that it had been preached by Quesna.
a Frenchman, long before George or
Maguire ever thought of it. The scheme
had been rejected by civilization. .
Speaking of the railroad controversy
Mr. Preston remarked that every man
who declared that it could be settled
by any other plan than that of the
competing lines was an arrant dema
gogue.
Mr. Preston's declaration that the
classes had not oppressed the masses
was a great effort which the audience
hailed with cheers. Lincoln, McKinley,
Cleveland, Stephen M. White, Henry T.
Gage, George C. Perkins and James G.
Maguire were mentioned as men who
had come up from the masses and no
one had oppressed th<-m. The opportu
nity remained to every poor boy in the
United Statrs to reach the highest
place in the country.
Words of praise were given by the
speaker Xo old-line Democrats who
were truo to the best interests of their
country.
The Hanford Warblers again enter
taind the uudienco, and then the great
meeting dissolved with three tremen
dous cheers for Henry T. Gage and the
whole Republican ticket.
To-morrow Mr. Gage and Colonel
Preston will Journey on to Hanford.
The people of Visalia were telling to
day of an incident of the late Maguire
meeting here which the organs of fu
sion suppressed- Hutchison, the aspi
rant for Lieutenant Governer, while
addressing the meeting Incidentally re
marked that there was some defection
among the Populists, but he fancied
that only twelve or fourteen had re
fused to endorse fusion. A leading
Populist arose in the audience and ex
claimed:
"There is more than a thousand, and
I am one of them."

STOCKTON HEARS
JUDGE MAGUIRE
Enthusiasm Lacking at
the Meeting.
STOCK ARGUMENTS UTILIZED
SPEAKER RAVES OVER THE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC.
Persists in His Refusal to Discuss the
Single Tax on the Plea That
It Is Not an Issue in
the Campaign.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Oct. 11.â James G. Ma
guire had a large audience at Agricul
tural Pavilion to-night, but not an en
thusiastic^ one. The name of Marion de
Vries, Congressional candidate of the
fusionists, elicited more applause than
the Popo-Democratic candidate got
when he mounted the platform. Mr.
Maguire was accompanied by Hutchi
son and there were more Populists in
evidence on the committees than old
line Democrats. Governor Budd had
been billed to be present, but his father,
Joseph H. Budd when called to preside
at the meeting, made excuses for his
son, saying:
"Affairs of State, greater than those
of any party, detuin him."
The Populists got scant mention by
Maguire, who spoke of his supporters
as "the Democratic party." Mr. Ma
guire began by saying that the issues
of the State campaign were between
monopoly and oligarchy and equal
rights for all. He attributed the per
petuation of free institutions to this
day to the triumph of Jefferson over
Hamilton, and said that if people's
rights survived another century it
would be through the ministration of
the Democracy. To thi.s end the cam
paign of 1896 was conducted by "that
matchless and peerless American, that
noble and abie successor of Jefferson â
William J. Bryan." In this State, he
said, a union of popular forces had
been effected to oppose- the monopoly
ticket.
General Barnes was referred to as
"that eloquent gentleman, eminent law
yer and Southern Pacific attorney."
General Barnes' latest speech, said Mr.
Maguire, was but an essay on the war.
Referring to the war Maguire said:
"There was an inglorious chapter â
somewhere there was neglect and in
competency. I seek no partisan advan
tage. We all know the War Depart
ment failed. As we have a common
glory in the success of the strife, so let
us have a common grief for this chap
ter."
In defense of his opposition to the
war revenue bill he said that a great
percentage of the tux was paid by the
poor and indirectly the rest also- was
paid by the poorer classes. He said
he merely opposed making it a "poor
man's war." The sale of war bonds was
needless, and they were sold because
"Secretary Gage declared long before
the war came up that there should be
an issue of bonds."
On the Philippine question he declared
the Democrats o-f California were in the
same position as McKinley, merely
waiting to ascertain how the best In
terests of the country could be sub
served In the linal disposition of the.
col< riies.
Maguire then reached his favorite
topic, the railroad monopoly. He de
clared the funding question was not Bet
tied and that nothing could be done
toward foreclosure or collection under
the bill i>assed by the last <'<>ngress
Without the consent of Huntinerton. The
only hope seemed now to fall back on
the Thurman act, thÂ» j greatest piece of
statesmanship in thirty years. He de
clared the bill was sneaked in at the
last session when many of the South
ern Pacific's opponents were away from
Washington. He declared Htlborn wns
defeated for a because he
favored striking the fourth provision
from the deficiency bill.
Mr. Masuire declared the Republican
State ticket was the Southern Pacific
ticket. He said it was made up in ;ul
vance, as The Call had published it.
The Call attributed its scoop to the en
ergy of its reporters. He would not
argue the question, but he said the
young men who did that work should
not work eighteen hours a day for Sir.
a wppk, but should fret a managing
editor's salary and work but eight
hours. They wen: the greatest politi
cal prophets on record.
"I will not discuss the single tax, as
it is not an issue," said the speaker.
"No party stands for it jrj th<- present
campaign. The constitution will allow
no such change ir. taxation without
amendments. No amendment can be
voted on without the Legislature de
cides to submit the issue. I will not
discuss it because Barnes knows noth
ing about it. Gage knows less. They
think they are thinking. I could tell
them about it if I chose. Dozens in
this audience know more about it than
does Barnes."
The speaker closed by promising to
enforce the laws as he found them if
elected. Hutchison closed the meet
ing with a brief address.
SUPREME COURT
SUSTAINS BROWN
Spelling-Barry Contest Decided in
Favor of the Stand Taken by
the Secretary of State.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11.â The Su
preme Court to-day handed down the
following opinion:
In Bank.
T. C. SPELLING. Petitioner.
V. S. F. 1653.
L. . H. BROWN, Secretary of State, Re
pondent.
. Mandamus.
â¢ Prior to the general election of 189<3, the
State Central -Committee of the Demo
cratic party- called a State convention of
the party, and provided among other
things that the delegates to the State con
vention from the respective Congressional
districts should form district conven
tions for the purpose of nominating candi
dates for Congress. in pursuance of this
call the .State convention met, and the
several district-c onventions were also or
ganized and made nominations. In the
Fourth Congressional. District the dele
: gates. elected to" .'the State convention an
ticipated the meeting of that body by or
ganizing a district convention and nomi
nating James G. Magutre as' their candi
date tor Congress. A- the same time- they
appointed a campaign committee. '.
In. the month of August, UK, the regu
lar State Central Committee of the Demo
cratic party called another; State conven
tion for the purpose of nominating candi
dates for State, offices, and again provided
that the delegates to the Stale convention
from the respective Congressional districts
should meet in district convention for the
purpose of nominating candidates for Con
gress. In pursuance of this call, a State
convention met and organized, and subse
quently the delegates from the Fourth
Congressional District organized a district
convention by which James H. Barry was
nominated as the Democratic candidate
for Congress in that district.
- In the meantime the campaign commit
tee representing the district convention of
1596 had- appointed delegates to a district
convention which met, and, claiming the j
right to represent the Democratic party
in the district, nominated the petitioner
as a candidate for CongTess. Regular cer-
Ufleates of nomination were presented to
the respondent by the representatives of
each convention. He filed the certificate
of Barry and refused to file the certificate
of petitioner, who, therefore, asked a
writ commanding him to reverse hia
action.
We think the respondent was clearly
rig-ht in the course he took. It was his
duty to decide which of the two certifi
cates was issued by the regular convention.
There was no law to -?uirte him in deter
mining which was regular, and necessa
rily he was compelled to resort to the teat
of party usage. Mr. Barry was nominated
by a convention called in conformity with
tho established usage of the Democratic
garty, and recognized as regular by the
tate convention of the party. This, in
our opinion, is decisive. Writ denied.

KYLE AND EDDY TALK
TO A MADERA THRONG
Largest Political Rally Ever Held
by Any Party in the
County.
MADERA, Oct. 11.â The Republican
campaign was opened here this evening
by the largest and most enthusiastic
political meeting ever held in Madera
c.unty. T. V. Eddy and C. W. Kyle
were the speakers. They were received
at the station by the reception com
mittee, the Madera brass band and a
large concourse of citizens. The hull
was filled to its utmost capacity with a
throng representing every political
faith from every part of the county and
neighboring towns in adjoining coun
ties.
Major Kyle declared that fusion was
a confession of weakness and that the
Democrats and Populists knew that
neither party represented issues sound
enough to form a respectable party, so
they concluded to fuse. He said the
Democratic orator has to hop around on
three legs while making political
speeches in order to keep the confusion
planks from flying up and hitting him
in the face. Major Kyle closed by com
plimenting the Republican administra
tion in its management of the late war.
Colonel T. V. Eddy entertained the
audience with a severe arraignment of
the deception practiced by the "little
giant" on the stump in regard to his
Congressional record, the railroad issue
and the single tas.
Metcalf at Willows.
WILLOWS, Oct. 11.â Victor H. Metcalf,

warmly welcomed by a large crowd of
Glenn County people here this evening and
there was plenty of enthusiasm au
through the meeting, which Mr. Metcalf
addressed. The campaiKn is beginning to
warm up In this section, and it is cvi
dei ! that tho Republican vote of Glenn
County is going to be a surprise to the
enemy.
Mr. Mftcalf's speech won for him many
friends; It* manly, straightforward tone
and its freedom from personalities ap
pealing strongly to his hearers. The met
ing closed with cheers for Gage, Neff and
Metcalf. .

BOSS PHELAN'S
CANDIDATES ON
DRESS PARADE
They Appear at Met
ropolitan Hall.
PROMISES MADE OF REFORM
EUGENE N. DEUPREY MADE A
POOR CHAIRMAN.
He Did Not Have a Programme and
Consequently Got Tangled
Up In His
Lines.
Eugene N. Denprey acted as master of
ceremonies last night at the ratification
meeting of the nominees of Boss Phelan's
convention of one hundred job chasers.
He performed fairly well, outside of get
ting Badly mixed up In Introducing some
of the Supervisorial candidates. He had
not been provided with a programme, and
consequently could hardly be blamed for
the few mistakes he made. His intentions
to boom the show wore all right, but he
fell a little" short in the execution of the
work. The ratification hnd been planned
with the end in view of making it dra
matic, but some of the play actors turned
it Into comedy and farce.
The first number reminded one of a
minstrel show. The band struck up "Co
lumbia," and the door leading from the
dressing room was thrown open by Colo
nel \V. P. Sullivan, who marshaled the
forces. Behind him came W. S. McGee,
who presided over the convention of the
job chasers; then Master of Ceremonies
Deuprey, and last, but not least, Barclay
Henley, formerly of Mexico. The second
division of the parade was made up of
Boss Phelan's candidates and about fifty
claquers, who in return for their services
expect to be given nice billets in the New
City Hall in the event of the ticket being
successful. When the band ceased play
ing Sullivan gave the signal and the per
former took their seats.
"I have been directed," said MrGpp, "to
call this meeting" to order and introduce
Eugene N. Deuprey as chairman."
Colonel Sullivan thought "directed"
sounded a little harsh, but contented him
self with a scowl.
Deuprey then launched forth in a strong
denunciation of bossism and the "hydra
headed monster" that threatens the anni
hilation of good government. He claimed
that C. A. Buckley was holding- forth
at the Russ Housp with the avowed in
tention "of assailing the Democratic nom
inees." He then paid a tribute to James
D. Phelan and declared that no one could
defeat him or that other fearless cham
pion of the people, Mr. Franklin, the nom
inee for City and County Attorney.
Franklin K. Lane, the nominee for City
and County Attorney, looked pained and
surprised at having his name chopped off
In such an unceremonious manner.
T. P. Bonnet, nominee for Sheriff, was
then introduced. He briefly announced that
if he was elected he would give the peo
ple a good government, turn the fees of
office Into the treasury and be contented
with his salary.
As Bonnet was making his bow Deuprey
called attention to the fact that it was a
pleasant token that there wus one candi
date who would be satisfied with his
Balary.
Mr. Greenblatt said that he had been
over twenty years in the city without
ever holding office. He promised that if
elected Treasurer he would pay every
demand presented to him If It was prop
erly authenticated.
"I will increase the valuation of cor
porations holding franchises from the
city," said Washington Dodge, "if I am
elected Assesor, 1 believe in increasing
the burden of taxation of the corpora
tions, and I will raise their assessed val
uations $1"),000.000."
Tho audience applauded and Deuprey
then arose to Introduce the nominee for
County Clerk. "It is with pleasure, " said
he. "that I introduce John H. "
There was a pause. Deuprey was so
thrilled with pleasure that ho couldn't
remember the name until a small boy
In the Rallery called out "Brown."
Candidate Brown had a bad attack of
stage fright, and cut his speech short.
"I am not a speech-maker," said he,
"for this is the first time I have ever
been connected wfth politics. If I am
elected I pledge you that I will run the
County Clerk's office on $600) a year."
"That is too modest of you." exclaimed
Deuprey. "You must mean $6000 a
month."
Brown nodded assent and took his seat.
Franklin K. Lane, or Mr. Franklin, as
Deuprey introduced him, next told of
how proud he felt to be on the ticket as
nominee for City and County Attorney.
"I am pleaded at having been selected
by Boss Phelan's convention. Now don't
shy at the word 'boss.' If we are to
have a boss let us have one who runs
himself. We want a boss who puts his
own name at the hoad of his own ticket."
Colonel Sullivan applauded, the claquerb
took the cue and the audience joined in.
Bernard Bienfeld, nominee for Sur
veyor, was next on the list. He had a
pretty speech written out, but It was not
heard, for when he was just getting
into the poetical flights Mayor Phelan
bobbed upon the stage. It had been ar
ranged that he make his appearance after
Lane's speech, but he was a few minutes
late. The crowd cheered Phelan, while
Bienfeld went on with his rea<lin.er.
About all that could be caught of his ad
dress was something about "desert plains,
mountains and valleys," and "the wilds
of frontier life." He concluded with a
nice word painting- representing Mayor
Phelan as "the hand of destiny."
James Denman told the audience that
he had been in public life for thirty-three
years- and that he expected to have a bet
ter office holding record, as he felt cer
tain that he would be ejected Superin
tendent of Schools.
R. P. Doolan electrified everyone pres
ent by stating that there were no strings
on him at the present time and that there
never will be any on him. He promised
that if he is elected Superintendent of
Streets he will "clean out" all of the
deputies at present in that office. He fur
ther pledged himself to give the city good
streets and to act in co-operation with
the Mayor, Supervisors and Merchants'
Association.
Deuprey th<*n called upon the candi
dates for Supervisors to step to the front
to be viewed by the audience. He said
that it was too late for them to make
speeches, so they contented themselves
with bowing as they were introduced. He
made a few mistakes in introducing them,
but llk'e in the Lane incident there was no
objection raised.
John H. Grady, candidate for Auditor,
and Edward L. Fitzgerald, nominee for
Public Administrator, next told the peo
ple what good and efficient officeholders
they would make if sent to the City Hall.
Michael Meagher had a speech prepared
on the prospects of his election as Re
corder, but sot a had attack of stage
fright. He stammered, laughed and wiped
the beads of perspiration from hiÃ fore
head and withdrew after announcing that
he would give a business-like administra
tion.
Barclay Henley started oft with a sketch
of the days of the vigilantes, then leaped
over time to the days of tKe Wallace
Grand Jury and wound up by declaring it
the religious* duty of all to vote for him
for District Attorney and Incidentally the
rest of the ticket.
Dr. E. K. Hill kindly Informed his
auditors that if he was elected Coroner
he would treat them decently if they e%-er
reached the Morgue. He then gave way
to Mayor Phelan. "I think it a good
omen," said the Mayor, "to come after
the Coroner. I believe It presages my re
election." Phelan then dwelt at length
on the charter light and said that the al
lied bosses and corporations were fight
ing the Democratic State and local ticket.
He urged every one to vote for both tick
ets straight. In the interest of reform and
good government.

GRAND PARADE OF
KNIGHTS TEMPLAR
Most Gorgeous Ever
Seen in Pittsburg.
TWENTY THOUSAND IN LINE
BAIN FAILS TO DAMPEN THE
ARDOR OF PARADERS.
Brilliant Reception and Ball for thÂ©
Knights and Their Ladies
at the Duquesne
Garden.
PITTSBVRG, Oct. 11.â The parade of
the twenty-seventh triennial conclave
of the Knights Templar is now an event
of history. Whatever had been antici
pated in the way erf gorgeousness,
splendor and general all-around success
was amply realized, that is, all but tho
rain, which was not expected. But
even at that it was the grandest parada
ever held in this city. In point of num
bersâthere were 20,000 marchers in line
âit easily doubled similar occurrences
of the past, and as far as the appear
ance of the men, their uniforms, the
trappings of their horses, as well as
the perfection of their movements were
concerned, Pittsburg has never seen,
anything to equal it.
The day started with not a clo-ud in
the sky, a soft, gentle breeze blowing,
and long before the booming cannon
announced the start of the marchers
there was a multitude of people packed
together in an impenetrable throng
along the line of march. The number
of onlookers on the streets, in the win
dows on roofs and in the reviewing
stand's has been variously estimated at
from 500,000 to 1,000,000 people.
The rain commenced at 1:30 o'clock,
and for a while it looked as if the pa
rade might be broken up, but ao, the
Knights walked along with the same
spirit and displayed the same martial,
dignified bearing in the rain as they
had done under the sunshine.
The splendid uniforms of the Cali
fornia commanderies. their golden
swords and their chargers, attracted a
great deal of attention all along the
Hire.
The parade disbanded at Shenter
Park, and immediately after the Grand
Commandery met in Conference Hall
for the first actual business of the con
clave. After addresses of welcome by
Chairman Arthur B. Wigley, Mayor H.
P. Ford of Pittsburg, and State Grand
Commander Kuhn, the Grand Encamp
ment was declared open and Grand
Master Warren La Rue Thomas de
livered the annual address, after which
the reports of Grand Treasurer Lines
and Grand Recorder Mills were pre
sented.
The social feature of the conclave
took place to-night at the Duquesne
Garden. This was the reception ex
clusively for members of the different
Knights Templar commanderies, and
no laymen or any one, except ladies,
without a Templar uniform was ad
mitted.

William 11. Phelps. candidate for Su

sas5 as comrades, for Mr. Phelps has been en

nearly a quarter of a century- He said he i
aspired to the position once held by his !

as clean a record as the elder i 'helps had j
made in that ofllee.
Judge D. J. Murphy made the main ad- j
drr-?s of the evening, his narks being
punctuated througxmt with applause. "In
tho first place." said Judge Murphy, "the
Republicans have prepared the boat plat
form ever drafted. It is so good that even j
our opponents say that any honest man
could stand upon it. Then there is the

CANDIDATES MAY
BE DISQUALIFIED
TWO DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLY
NOMINEES.
James H. Kelly and James P. Booth
Said to Have Been Placed on
the Ticket Illegally.
There is a strong probability that the
nominations of two of the candidates for
the Assembly on the Democratic ticket
will be declared Invalid because of the ir-
regularity of the proceedings by which
I the nominations were made. Reference
i is made to the nominations of James H.
Kelly in the Fortieth Assembly District
' and James P. Booth in the Forty-third
District. Both nominations were made by
i the vacancy committee of the Democratic
! municipal convention. The question in
J controversy is fully set forth In the fol-
I lowing protest /iled yesterday with Sec
; retary of State Brown:
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. S, I*9B.
Hon LÂ«. H. Brown, Secretary of State, Sac
ramento, Cal. â Sir: The undersigned, a
, citizen and elector of this city and county. I
' and more particularly of the Fourth Precinct
. of the Forty-third Assembly District, respect
! fully desires to call ypur attention to the fol- .
! lowing statement of facts:
The so-called Democratic Municipal Con
\-ention mÂ»t on September 29. 1898, for the pur- ;
I pose of nominating eighteen Assemblymen for
I the various districts comprising this city, to J
! wit: From the Twenty-eighth up to and In- 1
: eluding the Forty-fifth District. When the
! Fortieth District was reached. M. C. ITaspett.
a member of the convention from the Fortieth |
| District, asked that the district be j.-a.sseU -or
the reason that they had not yet secured -i I
candidate for the position; and when the
Forty-third District was reached the same
proceeding was had. (See proceedings in The. :
â  (.'all and Chronicle of September 30.) Nomina- j
tions were not made for either of these dis- .
] tricts subsequently for the reason that tha i
convention adjourned pine die on September j
29. According to law a committee on vacan
cies, consisting of five members, was ap- I
pointed by the convention. The certlflate of I
nominations filed by tha chairman and secre
tary of the convention does not contain the
name of any nominee for the Forty-third, as
well ss for the Fortieth Assembly 'District;;
but the places for the names, as well as for I
the residences, are left blank. Attached to i
the certificate, containing all th* municipal as
well as the legislative nominees, is a co- !
called certificate, bearing no date nor the day of ,
thÂ» mo-ting of the committee on ancles,
giving no names of the original nominees for
the above two districts, because none were
made, no cause for the existence of vacancies
because none existed, and complying In no
way with the law of elections and particularly
with Section ll&I of the Political Code of this I
State, having reference to vacancies an I the
power of the committee to fill them. Th so
called attached certificate is not sworn to by
the chairman of the committee, Thomas J.
Walsh, nor by the secretary, Thomas Murray, i
of the committee on vacancies, and seems to ;
be utterly valueless because the original cer- j
tificate is sworn to by a notary public on Sep- j
tember ."0, the day next to the adjournment i
of the convention, whereas there is no notarial
certificate attached to the nominations filed by I
the committee on vacancies. ;
The point at Issue, and the principal one, Is
that no vacancies existed for the committee
to fill; that the failure of the convention to
make these nominations did not create a va
cancy. Section 1192 also states that the cer
tificate of the committee must also contain
the name of the person nominated and the
name of the new nominee in whose place he
was substituted. Of course, where no nomi
nation was made originally no substitution
can be made to fill any vacancy. The Sen
ate of the United States has decided re
peatedly, particularly in the cases of the
ftates of Montana, Wyoming end Delaware,
and more recently in the State of Oregon in
the case of H. W. Corbett, appointed by the
Governor to fill the office of Senator, owing to
the failure of the Legislature to elect, that
a failure by the Legislature to elect does not
create a vacancy within the meaning of the
constitution of the United States, and the
Senatorial office remained vacant for the
term until the next session of the Legisla
ture.
These cases seem to he absolutely Identical,
and the undersigned hereby enters his formal
irotest apalnst the placing on the ticket to
be voted for on Tuesday, November 8. 1838, the
name of James H. Kelly of 1810 Devisadero
Ftreet, from the Fortieth Assembly District,
and the name of .lame* P. Rooth of 901 Powell
street, from the Forty-third Assembly Dis
trict, both of this city, neither of them hav
ing been nominated in compliance with the
acts of the Legislature governing the filling of
such vacancies, Respectfully yours.

OFFICERS OF
ELECTION MOST
OWN PROPERTY
Important Ruling of
Supervisors.
HELLER NOT A CANDIDATE
HAS NO DESIRE TO MAKE A CAM
PAIGN FOR SHERIFF.
Young Men's Republican League Is
Now Getting Into Uniform
for the Cam
paign.
Oakland Office of San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 11.
The Supervisors created some surprise
this afternoon by announcing- that in ac
cordance with an opinion of the District
Attorney ottlcers of election must not only
be voters, but must also be property
owners. The only exception to this rule
is that of ballot clerk, who need not be on
the assessment roll. This will require the
altering: of nearly all the lists, which were
made up in the belief that any one on the
great register was qualified for an election
officer.
Another little surprise was the an-
nouncement that Sam W. Heller, who has
been making a lively Independent cam
paign for Sheriff, has withdrawn from the
fight. Heller notified his friends to-day
I that he had dex-ided to do all he possibly
j could to help the chances of the regular
j Republican candidate, Oscar Rogers. For
| a couple of months Heller has been mak
â  Ing a very steady and successful cam
i paign and has acquired much strength; in
! fact, it is believed he would have polled
< about 2000 votes. This strength given to
Oscar Rogers will make more certain the
tatter's election.
It is also reported that Heller may take
the stump in favor of Rogers.
The Young Men's Republican League
Corps has been reorganized for the pres
ent campaign and a full list of officers
was elected last night. Next Saturday
evening there will be a big Republican

J. P. Kick, first lieutenant, and Charles
Brier, Becond lieutenant. W. H. Dickison
â  lected third lieutenant and it was

Eugene F. Loud Addresses a Large
and Enthusiastic Meeting of
Republican Voters.
Congressman Eugene F. Loud address
ed a large and enthusiastic meeting at :
i Twin Peaks Hall, on the corner ol Seven- i
; teenth and Noe streets, last night. Tne
meeting was presided over by Frank
French, who, in opening the meeting,
spoke of the valuable service rendered to
the Republican party and also to the peo
! pie of the Fifth Congressional District by
; that distinguished Representative, Eugene
F. Loud.
The Introduction of T/oud was the Fig
; nal for continued applause from the large
Â audience. There was no waste of time or
w.rds from the speaker, who launched
i into the heart of his discourse. He re
viewed th<- Congressional record of James
G. Maguire and his Blngle tax bobby as
also the vacillating action of the Repre
sentative from the Fourth District unon
every Question brought before the House
of Representatives that hail for Its ob-
Jed the betterment of the country when
ever the measure emanated from a Repub
lican source. He was opposed to war with
Spain. li. was opposed to the levying of
a war tax for the maintenance of ivÂ»
brave m< n who went forth to protect the
'; American flap against a foreign foe. In
fact he was opposed to any and every
; thing introduced by a Republican memoer
except that which pleased or tickled his
Democratic fancy, and such occa
wer< very rare and far between. The
Democratic party, thinking that it woUid
in some way hamper the administration
of President McKlnley, at first favored
the war. bat as scion as it was se.-u that
the entire country, North and S >uth, were
united, then they commenced to back and
till, and in every conceivaÃie manner tried
to prevent the Issuance of war bonds. In
this the speaker sympathized wfth them,
as they had a holy horror of bonds since,
during the administration of President
Cleveland, bo, ids amounting to millions
had been Issued at a time when the nation
was at j" â¢
in conclusion he urged upon the voters j
to ;t that California send a solid i
Republican delegation to Washington to
support the administration of that great
and grand man, William McKlnley.
Short speeches were made by <"harles
L. Pat ton, the magnetic candidate ior
Mayor; W. A. Deane, nominee for County

BRYAN SEEKS TO KEEP

Pledges His Financial Support for
Two Years to the Cause
He Led.
CHICAGO. Oct. ILâ W. IT. Harvey, gen
eral manager of the ways and means com
mittee of the Bimetallic League, 104-1 Unity
building, Chicago, is in receipt of the fol
lowing letter from Colonel William J.
Bryan, dated Jacksonville. Fla. :
My Dear Sir: I Inclose a pledge for
monthly contributions to the cause of bi
metallism until October, 1900, together
with the installment for this month. I
most cordially indorse the plan adopted
by the committee and am confident it will
result in the collection of a large fund for
the circulation of bimetallic literature.
Since our fight Is in the interest of the
"plain peopi." â to use Lincoln's phrase, or
the "common people," to borrow a Bible
termâ we must appeal to them for the
moans of carrying on the contest.
The financiers can contribute large sums
to support the gold standard, because
the monopoly of money fives them great
pecuniary profit. Surely, you can appeal
with confidence to the millions who suffer
from a rising dollar and falling prices.
Having brought freedom to Cuba, the
American people car renew the struggle
for the financial independence of the
United States. Yours truly.

A COMPETING
FERRY LINE
IS PROMISED
The Realty Syndicate Makes
a Statement of Its In
tentions.
Property-Owners of Golden Gate Meet to
Hear the Proposition and Promise
to Aid the Enterprise.
The proposition to establish a new
fery system between Oakland and San
Francisco, an outline of which was pub
lished In The Call a few days ago, is tak
ing a definite shape. The Realty Syndi
cate, promoters of the enterprise, made
the first public announcement of Its In
tentions last night at a meeting of prom
inent property holders of Golden Gate
and vicinity in Klinkner Hall. The
meeting was for the purpose of hearing
what proposals the syndicate had to of
fer.
It was called to order by J. S. Wixson,
who stated that he, in company with
Messrs. Gifford and Smith, had as a com
mittee investigated the plans of the com
pany, and they were Batisfled that if the
plans were carried out it would result
in great advantage, particularly to that
section of Oakland. Furthermore he
said he felt assured that the syndicate
meant business.
J. H. Ruurke was elected chairman and
CharUs Chlchester, well known to the
business men of San Francisco, acted as
secretary. Charles E. Lloyd of the firm
of Lloyd & Hi-ardslee, general agents of
the Realty Syndicate in Alameda Coun
ty, addressed the meeting, stating what
the corporation has accomplished In the
past six yearsâ namely, the purchase of
seven street car lines serving Oakland
and Alameda, and 4000 acres of land, in
which there are over 400,000 front feet of
lots. These properties, purchased in
times of great depression, be said, are
worth $7,000,000, and on the money invest
ed are paying handsomely. His company,
he asserted, was abundantly Ã¼b'e to meet
ail its obligations and was doing so.
"We are not just ready to build the
ferry system." said he, "but we are going
to establish it. Considering our great in
terests on this side of the bay, there is
nothing else to do as a sound business
proposition."
He further nnnounced that it was the
purpose of the syndicate to establish a
cemetery on its pro] erty in the eastern
part of Oakland, and run funeral cars
from all parts of that city. The ferry and
car system would tap a population of 500,
000, am; on account of its exclusive pas
senger boats and rapid transit would com
mand a very extensive patronage and add
greatly to the realty values on the Oak- '
land .side of the bay. In conclusion he
said that in or^er t.> make the enterprise
advance more promptly it was necessary
th.it the property-owners who are to oe
benefited should take a substantial inter
est in it.
Mr. Beurdslee in a concise statement
SENATOR BULLA
ON AMENDMENTS
Proposed Changes inthe
Constitution.
Special risr^tch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11.â State Sena
tor Rol>prt N. Bulls has given consid
erable study to the amendments to the
State constitution which are to be vot
ed for in November, and he is now giv
ing the voters the conclusions he has
arrived at. The fart that the Senator
was a member of the Legislature and
took a prominent part in framing the
amendments upon which the people are
to vote make his conclusions of special
interest.
The Senator explained to The Call
correspondent that, while amendments
to a State constitution were rather a
dry subject, they had to he given con
sideration, as they materially affected
the fundamental law of the State. He
Bald:
During thirty years there have been 456
changes or amendments to the constitu
tion. Article XIII of the constitution, re
lating to taxation, has been the great
bone of contention.
Of the amendments proposed this year
No. Iâ that known as the amendment ex
empting certain cities from certain laws
regarding claims against themâ l am op
posed to. It is entirely for the benefit of
Vfillejo and San Francisco, and will per
mit them to pay claims contracted in ex
cess of the revenue received by those
cities during the year they were contract
ed. As to Vallejo, the amendment is all
right, but it would admit of the payment
of illegal claims contracted in San Fran
cisco, and for that reason should be de
feated.
Amendment No. 2 is an important one.
It permits each county in the State to
frame a local county government act. It
â¢ told his hearers that the syndicate
' "must have the ierry" to make a success
of the plans that had been maturing for
years. It depended, he said, on the peo
| pie of Oakland whether they have the
! ierry in three or four years or in eighteen
months.
"We propose to give you a service."
said he, "that will land you in this part
; of Oakland in nineteen minutes from Sun
j Francisco. The Union Iron Works tells
us that the style of boats we have se
can make such time readily in
I connection with fast electric cars on the
mole, which is to extend into the bay
two and a half miles. We naturally want
some help from you people who "are to
share in the advantages. We want you
to be actively Interested with us. Then
you will work for mutual success. 1 '
He announced the intention of the syn
dicate to build a large central distribut
ing depot at Emeryville, from which
electric cars would cover Oakland, Ber
keley and Alameda. It was the desire
that the peopie of that section of the city
should show their interest in the enter
prise by subscribing to the investment
shares of the- company, for which ample
security would be afforded and 6 per cent i
interest guaranteed.
These shares would be exchangable. if i
desired, for capital stock of the corpora- |
tion. The agreement would call for the !
payment of one-fifth of the amount sub- I
scribed twenty days after the beginning
of construction of the mole, and four
fifths when the ferry system went Into
â¢ ;â â¢ i ELtlon.
Cragie Sharp, secretary of the Oakland
Board of Trade, addressed the audience
in an enthusiastic speech in which he
vividly described the advantages such an !
enterprise would be to Oakland, and he 'â 
urged everybody to help it along. He also
sharply criticized the "mud-throwers."
who are always blocking all such pro
gressive efforts In Oakland. What that
city was suffering for. he said, was more
railroads and competition, and these
thinKs would soon come if "the people j
together."
Before the meeting closed the chair
asked the people of that section to assist
the enterprise in every possible way for
their own benefit.
After the meeting 1 the leading property- ''
owners preseni expressed their willing- i
ness to take shares In the business on the
guarantee given that every dollar sub- |
scribed would ko to the building of the |
ferry line. They arranged for a meeting ;
to be held this week at which they will
make their subscriptions, which they say
will aggregate a substantial sum.
The people of Berkeley .are taking a!
lively Interest in the proposition and will \
hold* a meeting this week to be called uy
the City Trustees.
1 will give Alpine County, with Its 100
voters, an opportunity to legislate for it
self and will not compel it to work under
â  the same act provided for Los Angeles
County with her 40,000 voters.
Still there is a defective feature in me
amendment, and for this reason I am op
posed to it. It permits each county to
I enact its own election laws, which wouid
kill the Australian ballot in counties
where a majority of the freeholders elect
ed to frame the county act were opposed
Ito the Australian ballot. I would advise
everybody to vote against this amend
i ment.
The amendment labeled No. 3 1 favor.
It provides for the creation of a court of
claims, and will take from State Legisla
tures a powerful and corrupt factor which
has in the past more or less controlled
State legislation.
I am in favor of amendment No. 4. It ]
relates solely to San Francisco. >
Amendment No. 5, providing- for the suc
cession as Governor in case of the death
or disability of the executive, simply .
making the succession more explicit, 1 fa
vor.
Amendment No. C should be voted for.
It relates to grammar schools, defining
distinctly their standing under- the law,
and gives outside, or country schools,
their Just proportion of the school fund.
Everybody should vote for amendment
No. 7. " It provides that the first twenty
five or thirty days of a legislative ses- I
sion should be devoted to the introduc- j
tion of bills. Then an adjournment is to
be taken for thirty or sixty days during I
which the newspapers and the people can '
discuss the proposed legislation. Then
the Legislature is to reassemble, and as a
result there will be more deliberate ac- I
tion upon all legislation enacted.
The Southern California Republican '
League has adopted a resolution pro- j
viding for a State constitutional con
vention of eighty members to draw up
a Dew State constitution. Senator
Bulla favors this proposition, as he is
of the opinion that the commonwealth
is sadly in need of a new constitution,
drawn BO as to include all the amend
ments already passed and brought up i
to date to include sundry reforms.

Colored Whirlwind Knocked Out.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Oct. 11.â Kid Gou
hooked his right to Joe Hopkir.s'
jaw last night in the mKldle of the ninth
round of what was to have been a. twen
â  round bout and put the co
whirlwind t" sleep. The knockout, the
first ev^r administered to Hopkins in bis
â  of eight years in the rinÂ«, was de
livered before a wildly enthusiastic au
dlence ef 1000 people at the Athletic Club.
Hopkins did most of the aggressive work,
but Qoulette countered beautifully, his
defense was good and he seldom failed
â to land when he led. In the third round
Hopkins drew blood from Goulette'a nose
and later swelled up his left eye. To off
â  ila Goulette gave Flo) kins a fear
ful thumping on the body.

DANGER IN SODA.
Serious Results Sometimes Follow
Its Excessive Use.
Common BOda is all right in its place
and Indispensable In the kitchen and
for cooking and washing purposes, but
it was never Intended tor a medicine,
and people who use it aa such will some
day regret it.
"We refÂ« r to the common use << f si*da
to relieve heartburn or sour stomai
habit which thousands of people prac-
tice almost daily, and one which is
fraught with danger; moreover, the
soda only gives temporary relief and in
the end the stumach trouble gets worse
and worse.
The soda acts as a mechanical irri-
tant to the walls of the Btomach and
bowels and cat - are on record where
it accumulated in the Intestines, caus-
ing death by Inflammation or peri-
tonitis.
Dr. Harlandson recommends as the
safest and surest cure for sour .stomach
(acid dyspepsia) an excellent prepara-
tion sold by druggists under the name
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. These
tablets are large 20-gram lozenges, very-
pleasant to taste iind contain the natu-
ral acids, peptones and digestive ele-
ments essential to good digestion, and
â when taken after meals they digest the
food perfectly and promptly before it
has time to ferment, sour and poison
the blood and nervous system.
Dr. Wuertfc states that he invariably
uses Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in all
cases of stoma< h derangements and
finds them a certain cure not only for
sour stomach but by promptly digest-
Ing the food they create a healthy ap-
potite, increase flesh and strengthen the
action of the heart and liver. They are
rot a cathartic, but intended only for
stomach diseases and weakness and
â will be found reliable in any stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at 50c per package.

MINING CLAIMS "JUMPED."
Wright Creek Land Seized by a Party
From Vancouver.
SKAGUAY, Oct. 6 (via Seattle, Oct. 11).
A good deal of alarm has been felt here
is a result of the news that ex-Mayor
Grant of Vancouver and a number of
other Canadians have "Jumped" claims on
Wr^ht Creek, the richest creek yet dis
covered in the Atlln Lake district. It ap
pears that as soon as Mr. Grant appeared
mi the scene the Recorder discovered that
the original locators had not complied
with the law relative to the amount of
work for the season and so the new ar
rivals rushed up to Surprise Lake and
"jumped" Wright Creek. It is said the
Commissioner of the district has said the
original locators are entitled to the claims
ana that when the matter comes up for
adjustment in the spring he will oust
Grant and his party.

RANCHER KILLED
NEAR SAN JOSE
Frank Brown Murdered
by a Neighbor.
THE CAUSE IS A MYSTERY
SLAYER REFUSES TO TALK OF
HIS CRIME.
Augustine Brutinier Will Give No
Reason for the Wanton Taking
of a Human
life.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 11.â Frank Brown
was murdered by his neighbor Augus
tine Brutinier at about 6:30 o'clock this
morning. The men lived on adjoining
ranches on the Tully road, about four
milts southeast of the city. At the
hour named a message was telephoned
to the Sheriff's office that a man had
been murdered, and when officers hur
ried to the scene they found Brown
lying about thirty feet away from his
barn with his lower ribs and the cov
ering of his abdomen torn away. He
was still perfectly conscious.
In answer to the officers' questions he
said he knew who shot him, but could
not recall his name. From neighbors
the officers learned that Brutinier had
been seen on the premises with a gun.
The report was heard and Brown
was seen to fall. At the same time
Brutinier fled across the fields in an
easterly direction. I'ursuit was given
and the man overtaken about a mile
and a half east. He was in a field and
seemingly making for the hills. He had
a double-barrel, muzale-loading gun,
but surrendered when ordered to do so.
One charge of the gun had been
fired. He was taken before Brown,
and the dying man was asked:
"Is this the man who shot you?
"Yes, yes; that's him. Yes, that's
him," said Brown.
Brutinier said nothing. He was
brought V) the city and jailed. He re
fused absolutely to make any state
ment, and so far the facts which led
to the shooting have not been ascer
tained, or even a plausible theory sug
gested. Brown was placed in a vehicle
and a start made for the County Hos
pital, but he died before he reached
there.
Brown and Brutlnler owned adjoin
ing ranches. The former had a wife
and several children, but none were at
home last nisht. In fact. It seems that
his family has resided in San Jose for
some time while he lived alone on the
ranch None of his family reached him
Â»â  he died. The prisoner, who is a
Frenchman, has no family as far as is
known. He says he is a bachelor, and
this is all he will say about himself. He
has lived some years In a shed cabin
on his ranch, as he had no other build
ing. Brown was well-known about San
Jose, as he was formerly for years in
the house-moving business h^re. He
was a man of some means. While not
looked upon as a dangerous or desper
ate man, it is said he was a little
"cranky."
Mrs. Brown sued her husband for
divorce iÂ»n September 30. It is Incon
ceivable that this could hnve had any
thin tr to do with the tragedy. She al
: cruelty and failure to provide,
though claiming that her husband was
worth about $2'"'.' â ".

Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Sept. 12. â The kaleidoscope
has turned and there is one more
change in the constantly changing sit
uation down here. In effect, the Amer
ican authorities are again affecting
confidence in the good intentions of Mr.
Aguinaldo and a deep distrust of the
Spanish clerical party most remarka
ble In view of all that has gone be
fore. I confess that I have not a gTeat
deal of faith in the Spanish clerics.
Nobody can have who studies the situ
ation of affairs on these islands. At
the same time, neither can anybody
Who knows Aguinaldo put the slightest
confidence in his promises of whatever
nature. He is an Asiatic and a Ta-
He is, consequently, a liar
two counts. His move to Malolos, it
seems to me, is of itself enough to put
every American official on guard. At
Bacoor he was between the two armies
at Manila and Cavite, and under the
guns of the American fleet. "Whatever
move he made, no matter how many
men he may have kept in the trenches
around Manila "to preserve," as he
said, "the integrity of his position in
the event of the Americans giving up
the islands," the Dictator himself was
at the mercy of Admiral Dewey and
General Otis at any moment. At the
first sign of an overt act he could have
been taken and the rebellion crushed
at once in his single person, for he Is
the rebellion. At Malolos, which he
has strongly fortified and where he pro
poses to hold a congress next month,
he has 100 miles of railroad along
â which to retreat behind him, and the
whole northern end of Luzon for a
refuge. In effect, if the Americans
want Aguinaldo now, they must go out
Into the wilds, into his own country, to
get him. The Dictator is a good strat
egist. The Americans, I regret to say,
have not been so good.
The talk of the plotting of the Span
ish priests to ruin Aguinaldo's case be.>
fore the Paris commission, to make it
appear that the Tagallos are not a
united party, has some foundation in
appearance, but this one weak point in
fact: The Tagallos are not united.
They never have been since Agulnaldo
failed to keep his promise of the loot
of Manila to his following. The so
called republic of the Filipinos is a con
geries of leaders, each with a following
more or less numerous, each seeking
the undoing ot the^cther asul aU -gtriv-
ing for the downfall of Aguinaldo,
whom they all hate and fear. The
story of the Spanish clerical plot is in
teresting, even if It is not true, and
has not been cabled. In fact, the press
censor will not allow it to be cabled.
It Is, in effect, that a certain Colonel
Juan Blanco, a Spaniard who has de
serted from one party first and then
from the other, as time served best,
who is just now the commander of a
band of insurgents in the Sampoloc dis
trict of the city anywhere from 1000 to
2000 strong, has been employed by the
Spanish priests to provoke a conflict
with the Americans to the end that
when the Paris commission meets the
island may be the scene of active war
fare and the Filipino republic a dream
of the past, whatever happens to the
Philippine Islands. I do not believe the
tale myself. I think the Spanish clerics
have had enough of politic*; for the
present. The authorities do believe It,
and are taking steps now to suppress j
Juan Blanco and to reach his alleged
principal. It is no less a personage,
they claim, than the Archbishop. That
prelate has been greatly maligned be
fore this, and I believe firmly that he
Is being wronged now. Whether he is
or not, there will be some startling de
velopments here in the near future.
The sailing of the hospital ship Rio
Janeiro has been postponed once more,

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
rules that "persons who in the month of
July engaged in any business for which
special tax is required to be paid mu^t
pay tax for the entire year beginning
July 1, and thereafu-r If he takeÃ in a
partner the firm thus created must also
pay special tax reckoned from the first
day of the month in which it began busi
ness, to the first day of July following,
and take out a stamp in the firm name
without any rebate or allowance on ac
count of the tax paid by tho person in
question for the business carrir-d on by
him individually, prior to the creation of
the firm."
The Commissioner bases hie decision on
the ground that the stamp "Is merely a
receipt for a tax and not a llcnse," and
that tho tax must be paid for the entire
time from the first day of the month in
which the liability begins, until the first
of July following, even though the busi
ness continues for the briefest time.

Lady. I gave a handful of Ripans Tabules to an old gentleman of
Brooklyn, and he said their effect upon him has beta
most remarkable.
Fwend. What was the matter with him, anyway?
L. He is a weigher, and works about the wharves and ware-
houses. He said that always after eating he would bo
troubled with gases, and there would be a sensation at
of a load on the pit of his stomach which made him
very uncomfortable. /
F. Well, what good did the Ripans do him ?
JL I don't know how they did it, but he says they were effect*
ive from the start, and he was surprised to see ho#
quickly one would give him relief. I think it is quito
remarkable, for he is a confirmed dyspeptic and hÂ«
positively sneered when I gave him the Ripans. HÂ«
didn't seem "c think anything could reach his case

THE SENATORSHIP-
ALL citizens are well aware that at this time the
Senate is the danger point in our government.
The administration is Republican, and in the
House of Representatives there is a strong majority
to support it in carrying out great policies designed
to promote the national welfare. In the Senate, how
ever, the parties are so equally divided the Republi
cans can be scarcely said to control the course of
legislation there. While such a state of affairs con
tinues all legislation is doubtful and uncertain. The
only way to make sure of a wise settlement ot national
problems is to elect a sufficient number of Repub
licans to the Senate this winter to put that body in
harmony and accord with the other branches of the
Government.
Upon the people of California devolves an impor
tant duty in that regard. A United States Senator is
to be elected by the Legislature this winter. The
incumbent is a Democrat. Here is an opportunity
to decrease the Democratic vote in the Senate by one,
and to increase the Republican vote by one, making
â¢'erence of two votes in the comparative strength
of the parties. In the present condition of affairs
that change in the Senate might be decisive of almost
every important issue in the legislation of the coming
Congress. Under such circumstances the Repub
licans of the State should need no urging to bend
every energy to the task of electing a Republican
Legislature.
California haÂ« been for too long a time mi
$ented in Congress by Democrats and Populists,
free-traders and fiat money men. Her interests have
undoubtedly suffered to some extent because of
r -'presentation. She has. therefore, a stake of her
own in the contest, and her welfare as well as that
of the nation will be largely affected by the results of
the Congressional and Senatorial elections. Every
consideration emphasizes the need of a solid Republi
can delegation from Calif r,rnia. The issues are mo
mentous. The occasion is critical.
From this time forth close attention should be
given by Republican workers to the canvass for the
legislative ticket. Fortunately the legislative nomi
nees throughout the State are men to whom the party
and independent voters can give a cordial and un
hesitating support. They are pledged to an economi
cal management of State affairs and to all reforms the
conditions of the time call for. They represent the
business interests, the taxpayers and the .vorkingmen
of the State. They stand for conservative govern
ment, for ''our country as it is." again-t the vagaries
of single taxers, socialists and political tinkers of all
kinds.
For the welfare of the nation, for the good of the
State, for the interests and the rights of the indus
trious and the thrifty land-owners among our peo
ple, the contest in the legislative districts should be
â¢waged by Republicans with that vim and vigor which
accomplish victories. Let it not be forgotten that the
United States in this emergency needs a Republican
Senate and counts on California to elect a Repub
lican to succeed Senator White.
WILLIAM &. DEANE.
BY the nomination of William A. Deane for the
office of County Clerk the Republican conven
tion has afforded an opportunity for the pro
motion of one of the most efficient deputies in the
service of the city and county. The nomination, in
fact, is in line with the principles of the best civil ser
vice system, since it provides for the advancement
of a faithful official in accordance with the merits of
his service.
Mr. Deane has served many years in the County
Clerk's office, fulfilling various duties, among others
that of chief deputy, and is therefore well fitted by
experience and practical knowledge to take charge of
its duties. No man is more familiar with the de
tails of the work required of the Cierk, and no one
can be more surely counted on to perform them with
efficiency and fidelity.
During the period of his employment as an official
of the county Mr. Deane has had business relations
with all classes of citizens. They have found him
uniformly courteous and obliging, indefatigable in
work, carefully accurate in all that he does and thor
oughly reliable. By reason of these excellent quali
ties he has gained the favor of the community at large
as well as the, esteem of his chiefs and his colleagues
in office.
With so worthy a record of past service Mr. Deane
enters upon the campaign with qualifications which
entitle him to the support of all citizens who desire
an efficient and reliable administration of the Cnunty
Clerk's office. The fidelity with which he has ful
filled all his obligations in the past is a sure guarantee
of equal fidelity in the future. Under Mr. Deane's
management the people can rely upon it that the
work of the County Clerk's office will be performed
with hustnes9-like promptness, economy and ac
curacy.
MfIGUIRE fIND ONARCHY.
X his speech against the feature of the immigration
bill to prohibit the immigration of anarchists and
nihilists to this country, Maguire said:
"Who are the nihilists? They are the Democrats of
Russia, who are struggling against almost hopeless
odds to establish the natural and inalienable rights of
man in that country.
"Who are the anarchists of Spain? They are the
Republicans of that country, seeking to establish the
principle of popular sovereignty as against the un
natural privilege of governing now enjoyed by a
single family.
"Who are the socialists of Germany? They are the
opponents of monarchical government and special
privilege â the advocates of the equal rights of man.
I believe their schemes of social regeneration to be
impracticable and mistaken, but their purpose is right
and their cause should be sacred to every lover of
liberty and justice."
It will be noted that he took pains to declare his
opposition to the schemes of the socialists, only, and
had no principles to state in opposition to the nihil
ists and anarchists. The socialists proceed by peace
ful means, and are even opposed to war for any cause,
being practical non-resistants.
Maguire's defender and supporter, Mr. Preble of
Oakland, whose letter we published last wee^c, said:
"Every syllable of that speech should be indorsed by
enlightened citizens who believe in the great demo
cratic principle of political equality and freedom. * *
Anarchism is no more a menace to civilization than
any other line of philosophical reasoning." In our
comments on this defense of Maguire's defense of
anarchy, we said that neither Maguire nor Preble
could be in the dark as to the purposes and methods
of anarchy. It is opposition to all government and its
institutions defensive of life and property. Twenty
three years ago Karl Marx and Bakounin, the
founder of anarchy, disputed as to the nature of their
creed. Out of this contention issued a plat
form or declaration of principles which remains
to this d\y unchanged as statement of the
purpose and method of anarchy. That plat
form declared war against capital, abolition of
the state and all government and authority whatso
ever, dynastic as in monarchies and temporary as in
republics. It closed by crystallizing the whole creed
into two phrases: "Do as you wish," and "every
thing is everybody's." Soon after this declaration
Nicolaus Bakounin, who was a Russian, educated
at the St. Petersburg School of Cadets, died, July i,
1876.
He was succeeded in the chieftainship of the an
archists by Elisee Reclus, who, with Paul Brousse
and other anarchists, met at Bakounin's grave and
promulgated his biography, which had an immense
circulation in Europe.
At a Congress of Trades, held in Berne not long
after. Carlo Cafiero and Enrico Malatesta, Italian
dele,c ''^d in the most extravagant praises of
Bakounin, notably on the same lines as Maguire's
speech in Congress and for the first time declared
the "propaganda by deed" in these terms: 'The
Italian federation believes that insurrection destined
to confirm by deeds the anarchistic principles is the
only means of effacacious propaganda." Then riot
and assassination began. Cafiero led a riot in Bene
vento, burned the official archives and looted the
treasury, dividing the public money among them
selves.
A month later the Anarchist Congress met at Ver
viers, where Krapotkine first appeared as an anar
chist under the name of Levachot. In 1878 Brousse
and Krapotkine issued the anarchist paper. "L'Avant
Garde." and Hoedel proclaimed anarchy in Germany
and Moncasi and Passamenti attempted to assassinate
the King of Spain and of Italy, respect!-
At the second Anarchist Congress at Freiburg Re
clus submitted this platform, which was adopted: ,
"Firstâ -Collective appropriation of social wealth.
"Second â Abolition of government in all its iorms.
"Thirdâ Propaganda by theory.
'"Fourth â Action by riot and revolution.
"Fifth â Abandonment of the idea that sovereignty
of the people may be expected by the ballot."
"L'Avant Garde" was suppressed and Herzig be
gan the publication of "Le Revoke," at Geneva, for
which Krapotkine wrote. He also lectured on the
principles of anarchy, and at Marseilles preached
"propaganda by deed." the anarchist euphemism for
assassination, and organized a convention which pro
claimed the confiscation, by expropriation, of all land
and capital, without indemnity or compensation to
the owners. Otero Gonzales went from this conven
tion to his attempt to assassinate the King of Spain.
In 1881 anarchist delegates went from all over
Europe to a convention of the Workingmen's party
at Paris, and bolted in anger when it refused to in
dorse anarchy.
Krapotkine was then driven out of Switzerland,
and, with Francis Guy, traveled over France, exciting
disorders. Since then their followers have murdered
the President of the French republic, thrown bombs
in the French Assembly, murdered the police in Hay
market square, Chicago, threw a bomb in the Cafe
Foyot, Paris, killed many people in trying to assas
sinate the Prefect of Barcelona, Spain, and murdered
many with bombs in the Cafe Terminus, in Paris, and
assassinated Castillo del Canovas and the Empress of
Austria.
Justus Schwab and Hcrr Most are the anarchist
leaders in the United States. They are saloon-keep
ers, and Most for a long time edited an anarchist
paper, the "Freiheit," in Brooklyn. N. V., in which
he urged editorially the use of the knife in assassina
tion, because only a crack shot could kill with a
pistol! For a long time the motto at the head of hi>
paper was "Long live the torch and the bomb."
The above is an incomplete list of anarchist assas
sinations, but it is a complete and authentic state
ment of anarchist principles from their official declar
ations:
"Do as you wish."
"Everything is everybody's."
"Down with government and authority in all its
form?."
These are the men Judge Maguire defended as
praiseworthy patriots and worthy immigrants to this
country, saying he hoped "the time will never come
when they will be denied asylum in the land of the
free heart's hope and home."
These are the principles which Mr. Preble says
were the same as "Paine and Jefferson, Lincoln and
Henry Georfce. stood for in the onward march of
human proprrrc<;."
Since the supporters of Judge Maguire have
adopted the followers of Bakounin as their comrades
and his principles as theirs, we submit the case to the
people of Calfornia to decide.
If they think that every man should do as he wishes,
that everything is everybody's, and all land and
property should be expropriated without indemnity,
they have a chance to say so by indorsing Maguire.
Let it be remembered that Mr. Preble defended
these views of Maguire, saying, "I regard Judge Ma
guire not alone as my friend, but the friend of all
just men-/' so the issue is made from Maguire's side
of politics, and by his friend and spokesman.
TIIE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1898.
FOR MR. VALENTINE'S PERUSAL.
PERHAPS President Valentine of the Wells-
Fargo Express has overlooked the opinion
coming from the Circuit Court of Wayne
County, Mich. It is a pleasing duty to spread it be
fore him and call his distinguished attention to it.
This decision, quoted in full in another column.
covers exactly the points raised by the Wells-I-argo
concern, and in distinct terms overthrows each one of
them. It would appear that the American Company
is of a piece with the local corporation in that both
endeavored to escape payment of the war revenue
tax, and to make their customers pay it for them.
The company's defense was technical, striving to
set aside consideration of the merits of the case, and
pleading non-jurisdiction. The technicality, however,
was swept aside by a few\ ords, and briefly and tersely
the court showed the folly of the opposing conten
tions. The Judge said that the company was bound
to furnish a receipt, that the receipt was not good un
less there was attached to it a revenue stamp, The
obligation of the company to supply the stamp thus
became clear, as the law would hardly demand of it
the formality of furnishing a worthless receipt.
Raising rates so as to cover the cost of the stamp
was denounced as an illegal subterfuge designed for
shifting the burden to the customers, whereas it be
longed to the company. The law quoted is the same
as has heretofore been printed in these columns for
the enlightenment of the Valentine intelligence. It
is so plain as to be subject only to the construction
given it. Finally, the opinion sets forth the difference
between a transaction in which private parties are
concerned and one in which a party is a common car
rier. There does not appear to be anywhere a crumb
of comfort for Valentine. The American Company
was ordered by a writ of mandamus to do as expected
of it, to receive packages and forward them at the
regular rate, putting on each receipt the necessary
stamp.
The present would seem to be a good time for Val
entine to repent. Writs of mandamus are possible
here. There is also a likelihood that damage suits
will be filed in large number, for the one thus far
tested has been decided adversely to Wells-Fnrgo.
For Mr. Valentine to obey the law would certainly be
the part of wisdom.
JUDGE MAGUIRE says that he will not be di
verted from the issues oi the campaign. It will
fill a long felt want if he will take the public
into his confidence in what he considers the issues to
be. In a general way he informs his audiences that
he stands against the aggressions of the corpora
tions and the rich. If aggressions exist they can be
specified. Let the Judge outline an existing aggrt-
sion, state it truthfully and give the remedy that can
be provided in his election. If he cannot describe
such existing aggression and prove that it exists and
that it can be stopped by electing him Governor, then
his general denunciation of property and those who
own it is dangerous demagogy, affecting to see
classes that have no existence and stirring one man
up against another.
Recently he has begun boasting that he was ap
prenticed to the blacksmith's trade, and so learned
to sympathize with labor. This is demagogic. In
this country a vast majority of men lay their keel in
labor in early life, and labor has had sympathizers
besides apprentices. One thing is sure, the Judge
did not like work well enough to stick to it, for there
is some evidence that he began drawing down an offi
cial salary at 19, and it is certai. that he did very soon
after he was 21, and has been at it ever since, with
very slight intermissions.
In regard to his apprenticeship to a trade, it is
worth noting that a great man has never been known
to advertise such a thing himself. In all the long
public career of John Bright he never told an au
dience that he was a cotton-spinner. Stephen A.
Douglas never found it necessary to tell that he was
a cabinet-maker, nor John M. Palmer that he was a
cooper, nor Andrew Johnson that he was a tailor, nor
Henry Wilson that he was a shoemaker, nor Lincoln
that he was a rail-splitter and flatboat man, nor
Henry Clay that he was a mill boy, nor Joe McDon
ald that he was a harness-maker, because in the use
of their genius and talents they impressed themselves
upon their age without reference to their early calling.
and when their brains had raised them to eminence
it was left for others to search out the experiences
of their early life and tell it to the world. When a
man saves the historian and biographer the trouble
by attempting to inflate his personality by weeping
over his experiences as a boy, it is rather good evi
dence that he has not the brains and talents to sus
tain himself without demagogy.
So far Maguire's campaign has been entirely de
nunciatory and destructive. He denounces that he
would destroy. He runs amuck against property and
its owners. But California does not want a destruc
tive policy. This State requires a constructive policy.
What will Ma:?uire do. if elected, to relieve the sor
rows of the poor, which he first heard of while blow
ing a bellows as a blacksmith's apprentice? Let him
be specific and tell what he is going to do.
So far lie has denounced the funding bill which his
friend Senator White helped to draw up and perfect,
and which every man of sense admits closes the fund
ing issue favorably to the Government. The people
of California want their public affairs controlled by
reason and not prejudice. Will Judge Maguire cease
exploiting the pleasures of memory and the pleasures
of hope, the memory that he was once an apprentice
p.nd the hope that he will be Governor, and talk a
little plain reason n.nd common sense?
An aged man who Had come from the East to
marry a "rich widow" who had advertised her yearn
ing for a hu>l>:m<l has died in the County Hospital.
When the woman !e;irns this she will probably be
cheered at the reali/ntiVm that one more witness is out
of the way. For it due*; not appear that she is a model
woman.
Colonel Hale of the Colorado regiment goes to the
trouble to expose a sample Examiner lie. The colonel
means well, of course, for he is a gentleman and a
soldier, but his effort was hardly necessary. The
Examiner lie exposes itself. It invariably sticks out
like Bill Nye's sore thumb.
If Spain has any intention of keeping Blanco's
army at Havana longer than the Government of the
United States stipulates, there are as yet no indica
tions of it. The fact that Correspondent Creelman ad
vances this theory is fairly good proof there is noth
ing in it.
how the turn of Corbett and Sharkey to sign ar
ticles and indulge in conversation is here. There is
no reasonable chance of a fight between them, and
they must smile to note that some people accept their
conversational tumult as in some measure genuine.
When Candidate Gage speaks of the single tax
Democratic papers term the process "harping." Yet
it was on that same old string that Maguire has been
playing for years, and he didn't play half so good a
tune as Gage docs, either.

A NON-PARTISAN'S
INTERVIEW
Editor Call: In the issue of The Call
of last Thursday in relation to the Non-
Partisan convention there an
interview from me which does me an
â  injustice. The following is the extent
:of the interview had: I stated: "That
1 if by the personal efforts of Gavin Mo-
Nub, one of the 'leaders' of the Demo
cratic Committee of One Hundred, who
! was present upon the floor of the con
' ventlon, he had succeeded jn defeating
Mr. Holland, the Republican nominee
for Supervisor in the First Ward, aud
nominating Dr. Leland, the Democratic
1 nominee, that it would have been par
j tisan Democratic politics, because nine
j Democrats already had been in<l
and when we found an equally good
; Republican who had received the oom
miuet-'s recommendation, I believed
that he should have received the mi
i dorsement, and that I was glad that
, the convention did not permit that
: thing to be done; that I thought there
â  were some who would have left the
convention had he succeeded in his pur
, pose."
The above differs materially fmra the
construction placed upon my remarks
in the printed Interview, insomuch bo
that I ask you in fairness to make the
correction. Very truly yours,
WM. M. ABBOTT.

DR. BURGESS ON "KINETOPA
THY."
What! A new "pathy"? True, but
while the fear is but natural that new
accessions may finally lead to a confu
sion of "pathies" as disastrous to the
building- of the Temple of Health as
was the confusion of tongues to the
building of the tower of Babel, this
new "pathy" will have precisely the op
posite effect, for, like Aaron's rod, it
will swallow up all the other "pathies"
and cause the serpent in the emblem
atic attribute of Esculapius, the god of
medicine, to look hereafter like a boa
constrictor after a full meal. The two
best relished dishes of this varied and
extensive bill of fare will be homeopa
thy, with her adopted child, allo
pathy, swallowed, like Jonah, without
shrift or condiment. The indigestibil
ity of a bony dish like osteopathy, or a
cold side relish like Christian science â
which, by the way, should be called
"apathy" Instead of a "pathy," for that
is certainly no "pathy" which denies
the existence of disease â will be tem
pered by something hot, like electro
pathy, which brings on the one hand
financial death in the shape of electric
belts and things, and on the other
rouses to life the dead, as Lazarus,
by sticking eiectric needles into their
hearts, while the whole menu washed
down by Father Kneippathy, the newest
brand of hydropathy, will constitute a
meal that would make even a boa con
strictor feel tired.
This much by way of Introduction to
kinetnpathy, and now to the cultivation
of an acquaintance with it, which is
quite another story and one that is
naturally preceded by the query,
What is it?
The foundation of kinetopathy is laid
upon the causative principle underly
ing therapeutic or curative action. In
this it differs from other pathies which
are â every one of them â founded upon
the method of that action. The causa
tive principle of curative action is po
tential energy aroused to specific
kinetic activity, and the practice of
kinetopathy consists in the employ
ment of any and every agency compe
tent to arouse, control and direct that
activity to the accomplishment of a
cure of disease. This gives kinetopathy
so much resemblance to regular medi
cine that it might be mistaken for it
were it not for its great rotundity so
necessary to the container of every
"pathy." Big pills, little pills, assorted
(eclectic) pills, dashes and floods of
wetness, currents of electricity, rest for
jaw, stomach, brain and limb, laying on
of hands â often more like the laying
on of an elephant's foot â spasms of
faith and spurts of exercise, all these
are more or less seductive strena seek
ing to lure on curative action, while
kinetopathy represents the action itself.
A few illustrations of what kinetic
energy may do when misdirected will
show only too plainly the necessity of
thorough education and training to the
kim-topfithist before he shall attempt
to enter into the practice of his profes
sion. The deadly effect of concentrated
prussic acid, which, when placed upon
the tongue, kills before it caji be swal
lowed; the curare tipped arrow, which
carries almost instant death' into the
veina through the merest scratch; the
lightning flash and the electroeutioner's
shock, which kill when they touch;
mental emotion that may come like an
avalanche to crush the heart walls to
gether, never to expand againâ all
these are danger signals and effects
that cannot be explained except upon
the hypothesis of kinetic activity, while
at the same time they show the unlim
ited scope and power of that activity
wbicfa may some day be fully utilized
in the cure of disease.
Let it be added, in conclusion, that
when the first kinetopathic college of
medicine shall be established the writer
will expect to occupy the chair of pro
fessor of kineotopathy and -the office of
dean of the faculty, and his first duty
shall be to provide a suitable reward of
merit to him who shall first discover
kinetopathic agents that shall equal in
promptness and efficiency the kineto
lethal already known â that is to say,
agents that shall cure as quickly and
completely as well known agents kill.

GREAT DAYS FOR MASONS.
Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock in King
Solomon's Hall. Masonic Temple, the
forty-ninth annual- convocation of tne
i Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Ma-
I sons of California was opened in due form
' by Grand Master Flint.
There were present at the opening-, in
i addition to the grand officers, a list or
I which was published last Sunday, about
! 400 representatives from all parts of the
I State.
The grand master in his address saici.
It is with great pleasure that I am en^ b }t^
to report to you the continued i^sperU. Â° f the
craft within this jurisdiction olvritYia }*R?a
; in* the financial depression that has prevailed
throughout the greater part of the State .the
' increase In membership has been unusually
: large. The total gain for the year is .34.
j which has been exceeded but four times In the
entire history of this Grand Lodge. Peace : and
prosperity have prevailed within our borders
and our relations with sister Jurisdictions have
been pleasant and harmonious. Â»
The membership of the order at this
! time is 19.542. In his address the grand
i master paid tribute to the memories or
the late James Ogelsby. for many years
the grand tyler of the lodge, and the late
George Lord, who was the oldest Mason In
the jurisdiction, if not in the Linked Stages.
He also read a number of decisions ren
dered during the year and of official acts.
He expressed himself as pleased with the
excellence of the work of the order wher
ever he had made official visits, and
praises the inspectors for the carefulness
! with which they have discharged their
duties The subject of granting dispensa
tions to army lodges was referred. to the
Â°On' &C subject of Masonry in the
Hawaiian Islands he said:
The recent acquisition by the United States
I of the Hawaiian islands has added, in a certain
sense, to theresponsibilitesof this Grand _ }*f&f
â  The two lodees chartered by this grand body
1 have thus btfome nearer and dearer to us and
a territory has been opened that, to a certain
degree may be considered our own, in a aa
sonic se^ While the several lodges situated
in Hawaii have derived their chart*â¢ froni
different grand Jurisdictions It -nouW seem to
be for the best interests of Free Maronry that
they be. if possible, comprised within the same
i Jurisdiction, and from the fact that Grand
â  Lodge of California is n 'Â» rer ,. th^ fact
other Grand Lodge, and from the farther. fact
j that our Masonic relations are. and must be In
' the future brought nearer and closer , it would
appear that the most natural affiliations of the
1 lodges situated In Hawaii should be with the
I Grand Lodge of California.
I There were presented the reports of Grand
I Secretary Johnson and those of other
i grand officers, which were referred. A
number of resolutions were also presented
At r ha?f- r past 4 o'clock the Grand Lodge

PREPARING TO RECEIVE.
Decoto Getting Ready for the
Dedication Ceremonies.
DECOTO, Oct. 11.â All was activity
and bustle in Decoto to-day. The lit
tle town is preparing to receive about
15.000 Masons and their families and
friends to-morrow, when the handsome
new Masonic Widows' and Orphans'
Home will be dedicated with all the
pomp and ceremony of the Masonic
rites.
Two years ago this month the corner
stone for the big structure was laid
â with imposing ceremony and 10,000 visi
tors thronged the town and the hill
upon which the home is located. This
year the visitors will W more numer
ous and still more extensive ceremonies
will take place. Early to-morrow
morning the procession will form in
San Francisco, and to the music of
many bands march to the foot of Mar
ket street and cross by boat to Oak
land pier, where a half dozen special
trains will be in waiting to bring the
throng to Decoto.
Upon their arrival the procession will
be re-formed and march through a large
field to the hill, a half mile distant,
where the ceremonies will be con
ducted. The big building has been
completed and everything about the
premises has been made spick and span
for the occasion.
The dedication services will be con
ducted by the grand officers. Decoto
people are preparing extensively to feed
the multitude, and at least a dozen re
freshment stands have been put up in
town and on the roads. ~i PV a-
The home stands upon a h'<*n eiova

SINGLE TAX CHALLENGE.
Editor Call: So repeated have been
the attacks and misrepresentations of
the single tax theory in The Call and
other papers of late that, as a member
of the Alameda County Single Tax So
ciety, I feel bound to request the liber
ality of your paper to make a few per
tinent propositions.
As single taxers many of us regret
the action of the Republican party in
their State convention in inserting an
anti-single tax plank in the State plat
form. Such action will force many
single tax Republicans in this election
to vote against their own party.
It is not, however, of such vital in
terest to single taxers as to which po
litical party is for or against the sin
gle tax as it is that the theory of Henry-
George should be understood and in
telligently discussed. Up to the pres
ent editorials have been woefully at
sea in the presentation of the single
tax proposition, and naturally the de
ductions have been equally erroneous,
and platform speakers also seem
wretchedly ignorant of what the single
tax is and what the results of its adop
tion would be. General Barnes con
tents himself with calling it names;
Mr. Gage says it is a proposition to
tax realty and improvements only.
Now, in order to test the knowledge
and encourage the exercise of thought
on the part of random writers and rav
ers, and to put the subject squarely
before the people â in other words, in
order to give the single tax a fair,
square hearingâ l make the following
claims for the single tax and challenge
denial or adverse argument. The sin
gle tax would:
First â Cheapen land.
Secondâ Would encourage industry.
Thirdâ Discourage speculation.
Fourthâ Raise the wages of labor.
Fifthâ lncrease the earnings of capi
tal invested in industry-
Sixth â Reduce the California farm
ers' taxes to a quarter of the present
tax they pay.
Seventh â Prevent one man living off
another's labor, except by charity.
Eiehth â Destroy mono;
Ninthâ Aboiish the "lobby."
Tenth â Raise the wages to the full
product of labor.
Eleventhâ And could not be shifted.
It seems to me that the above is a
fair target for anti-single taxers. The
only difficulty the antis will have will
be to keep the thought out of their
answer?. When an anti-single taxer
begins to think he is in danger, and if
he keeps 01? thinking he is lost to the
antis and becomes as rabid as any of
us.
Trusting that you will give your anti
single tax editor, orators and readers
an opportunity to confute the above
statements, and also permit reply. I
am. sir. EDGAR POMEROY.

Thirty-Ninth Annual Convention of the California Grand Lodge,

THERE wore MB delegates in their
Beats when Grand Chief Templar
Thpoflore I>. Kanouse called to order
the thirty-ninth session of the Grand
I^odpe of the Independent Order of Good
Templars yesterday in Howard-street
church.
It was the first day of the session and
the time was spent In the preliminary
work of organisation and the reports of
tho various officers Vacancies among
the grand i used by absence were
filled by the chairman. The roll of stand

overhangs the cliff near the prisoners'
quarters and knocked one of the pillar;
away. For a moment it looked as though
the structure would come down on top
of the steamer, but it did not. It was
enough to drive all the passengers from
the forward deck aft, and some of them
were ready to make a landing, thinking
the house would knock a hole in the
steamer.
"Everything 1 worked as usual until we
were nearing Alcatraz," said Captain Mc-
Kenzie yesterday. "Then the tide began
ta^set the steatner l!Â» toward the island
and I tried to put the helm over so as to
head her out. Then I noticed that the
band on the wheel slipped every time we
used the steam steering gear, so the ves
sel was practically rudderless. I at once
stopped the engines and went astern,
but we could do nothing without the
rudder against the set of the current, so
we went ashore. Shortly afterward the
steamer Tiburon from Tlburon cam.:
along and Captain White came to my as
sistance, He put a line over the stern of
the San Rafael and soon had us in deep
water again. By that time the slack in
the belt had been taken In and our steer-
Ing- gear was once more in working or
der. The steamer is not damaged, as
she went ashore very gently, and a few
dollars' worth of paint will put her in as
good condition as ever. The passengers
were about half an hour late getting to
their work, and that was the extent of
their sufferings."
It was lucky that it was perfectly calm
yesterday morning or the San Rafael
would not r have fared so well. Had there
been any sea on she would have been
stove in and seriously damaged. As it
was everything, save the fog. was In her
favor. Had the ferry-boat been a double
ender she would never have gone ashore,
as it would have been an easy thing to
fasten up the disabled rudder and have
steered her from the other end. How
ever, all is well that ends well, and the
San Rafael is now running as though no
accident had ever happened.
The O. and O. Company's steamer Gae
lic did not get away for the Orient yes
terday until 3 p. m., or two hours late.
She is crowded with freight and passen
gers and will have to refuse to take any
on at Honolulu. The delay was caused
by the non-arrival of sailors from Mare
Island who are going to the fleet at Ma
nila. They came down on the Govern
ment tug 'Vigilant, but owing to some
misunderstanding they did not reach the
Mail dock until 3 p. m. The sailors are to
take the place of time-expired men who
have no desire to remain in the Philip
pines, now the war Is over.
Among the cabin passengers was J. W.
Welch. ex-Mayor of Stockton, who was
accompanied by hiss wife and threedaugn
t'-rs. They are going to make a tour of
the world' and will probably be away a
year.
Tho British ship Lord Ripon from Ta
coma for Cork, has arrived at Queens

She was thrown on her beam ends and

smashed, and the forctopgallant mast

A PALATIAL ESTABLISHMENT.
M. A. Gunst & Co.'s New Wholesale
and Retail Store Opens
To-Day.
This morning M. A. Gunst & Co. will
open their new wholesale and retail
store at 23 Kearny street. For some
time past they have conducted their
wholesale business at 203 Kearny street,
but their business has grown so rap
idly that the quarters there was wholly
inadequate for the transaction of their
business.
More room being necessary, the
premises. No. 23 Kearny street, were
secured. â  Many weeks have been spent
in fitting the place up and no expense
has been spared. As a result the pub
lic will find an establishment that is
palatial in its appointments and per
fect In its arrangement. It can be
confidently asserted that there is not
another cigar and tobacco store in the
country that surpasses or even equals
this new establishment.
The ground floor is devoted exclu
sively to the retail department and
to the offices of the company.
The woodwork is all solid mahogany,
the front portion of the ceiling of the
same wood, handsomely paneled. The
rear of the celling, as well as the walls,
are handsomely frescoed. Elegant
plate glass show cases, brass finishings
and beautiful electric light fixtures, all
in harmony with the general finish of
the store, complete an interior that is
rich and artistic In the extreme, one
that would be difficult to excel.
The wholesale department is located
in the basement, and everything here
is arranged with a view of transacting
all business in the most expeditious
manner possible.
Taken all in all, the new establish
ment, besides being all that is rich and
beautiful, Is also a model one in every
particular, and the house is to be con
gratulated upon its enterprise, which
has added to this city's mercantile es
tablishments one that can be pointed to
with pride by every resident of the Pa
cific Coast metropolis.

AN ERROR CORRECTED.
Expert Wright Informs the Grand
Jury of a Slight Change in His
Ferry Depot Report.
G. Alexander Wright, who acted as ex- I
pert for the Grand Jury in the investiga
tion of the ferry depot building frauds,
has sent the following communication to
the Grand Jury:
To John Dempster McKeo Esq., Chairman
of Committee on State Officersâ Dear Sir: I
respectfully ask permission to withdraw from
my report of September 1.".. 1898, the matter
stated under variation No. 10 in the carpenter
work for the following reasons, viz:
It has recently come to my knowledge that
all the wood partitions referred to therein were
actually prepared by the contractor and were
in reality all ready to be put Into place at
the time the Honorable Board of Harbor Com
missioners decided to leave them out and to
substitute the wrought iron partitions as cxc- !
cuted.
That being so thÂ« wood material prepared
by the carpenter contractor was of little or no
value and the only allowance that could
reasonably be expected was the labor in put
ting the partitions into place.
For this the contractor consented to a re
duction of $17Â». and which I consider to be a
fairly reasonable sum to allow for the omis

NOTHING FOB, HIS WIFE.
Edwin Poleman Bequeaths His Es-
tate to His First Child.
The will of Rdwin Poloman, who diod
on the 6th Inst., was filed for probate
yesterday. The deceased makes a rather
eccentric disposal of an estate valued at
$7000. To his wife he bequeaths nothing,
and to a prospective child but 11.
The reason for this Poleman sets forth
in his will, which reads: "I give, devise. |
and bequeath nil the property of which
I may die seized or possessed to my child
now living. Edwin PnU man, except
the sum of $1. which 1 bequeath to any
child that m;ty be born of my wife, Clara
Puleman. within the next seven months.
and mnke no other or further bequests !
to any such child that may be born !
within said seven months for the reason
that I recopnize no other child except
Edwin Poleman, above named, but <lis
tlnctly hereby bequeath said sum of $1 j
to any such child that may be born In \
order to distinctly provide for and men- i
tion such child in my will."
The will bears date of July 30, IRO4, and
the unborn child referred to in the will
is now 3 years of agre, and as It i? Riven
but $1 and its mother cut off without
one cent a content is expected.

AN M. P.'S OPINION.
Hon. Lan Malcom Gratified at the
Entente Cordiale.
Lan Malcom, M. P., representing- one of
the large agricultural districts of Eastern
England, is at the Palace. He has just
come from the Omaha Exposition, with
which he was greatly pleased.
"After spending a few days at Monte
rey." he said last evening, "I phall make
a visit to the Governor General of Canada.
at Ottawa, going thence to X<-w York, as
the place in which to witness the close of
your present political campaign. 1 am
more especially Interested in watching the
outcome of Mr. Roosevelt's nomination.
From New York I go to Jamaica, where I
have some Interests. I shall return here in
December on my way to India, where I go
to visit Viceroy Curzon.
"I am delighted with this country, and
can hardly wonder at the ease with which
you conquered Spain.
"I am much gratified, too. to observe
the growing good feeling between this
country and England; and I feel sure that
nineteen-twentlctha of my countrymen
have the same sentiment. The existence
of this sentiment needs no documentary
ratificationâ it is better, in fact, without
it. Everywhere Igo in this country I am
treated with the greatest courtesy; and I
appreciate it greatly."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11â The bears had hard
work to make a living In to-day's stock mar
ket, notwithstanding great diligence and per
eerverance. The majority 'of the standard
stocks offered a very firm resistance to the ef
forts to effect a reaction, and the number of
stocks In which any notable price movement
could be obtained was very small. The Indus
trail specialties were the only stocks on the
list that showed any disposition to move wide
ly. It was a room traders market and the
motives which Impelled these generally to buy
and sell stock were probably beyond the un
initiated to fathom.
For Instance, it was ascertained by some oc
cult reasoning or Information that the recent
borrowing demand for Sugar certificates was
for account, of sellers of long stock, who wished
to conceal their operations, and not at all, as
would naturally be supposed, of the bears who
tad sold short and had to borrow stock for de
livery. A fall in the borrowing premium of
the certificate*, because the sellers had re
turned the borrowings, served to disclose this
wily proceeding to the short turn stock gam
blers, and th.ey hastened to put out short lines
of Sugar with a resulting fall in the price of
nearly 2 points. Later in the day these sapient
speculators bought back what they had sold.
The reason adduced for selling the Rubber
stocks was a report that a recently discovered
substitute for rubber was about to be exploited
by a new corporation. Tobacco ranged over
nearly 6 points with no news to account for It.
The coalers, which are a perpetual target for
bear hammering, were raided down from 1 to
2 per cent on the general depression in the
Anthracite industry and other specialties were
subjects of individual treatment. Then man
euvers of the professional bears had aston
ishingly little influence on railroad stocks. The
demand for these secuerities was small, but
there was no disposition to sell. There was a
subsidence of apprehension over Anglo-French
relations. Rentes rose sharply.
The bond market was dull and easier with
the exception of a few gilt-edged Issues. Total
sales. $1,670,000. !
Government bonds were unchanged In the
bid price. v v "-â < -/â¢ â¢â¢'
There were sales of 3s coupons at 105%.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 293,300
shares, including: Atchleon preferred. 6305; Bur
lington, 8342; Lake Erie and Western preferred,

Ing checked by the progress of the settlement
and the uncertainty aa to a change In the 1
Bank of England rate on Thursday. The set
tlement shows a Bmall account, but tha rates i
were higher because of dearer money. Con- !
tangoes on Americans were 4ji4V,( per cent, but
the rate on Central Pacific and on St. Paul ;
was exceptionally tight. The lone of Arr.erl- j
cans was dull from start to finish.
South American stocks were distinctly (rood
here to-day on the rise in Brazilian exchange
and In the fall of Argentine gold premium.
German buying of gold has Blackened, and '
New York and Russia are the chief buyers now. i
The Paris market Is much exercised over j
the question of gold shipments to the United .
States. There was a rise In sterling both at ;
Paris and at Berlin, the strength In Berlin
exchange being due to "covering" purposes by |
; Germany on a large mass of maturing bills
which London wll not renew. Spanish ex
change Is also strong, both on the rise In Lon
don discounts and on the advance of the Paris
gold premium.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 11.â The excitement regarding
the Nile country having apparently subsided
the wheat market at the start began to drop
back Into the rut from which the alleged war
news had rescued it. There was also a cur
rent belief among professional speculators that
the price was a little too high without the
sustaining influence of export business cr wmo
similar Important Item. As a consequence
considerable pressure was put on from the
start and there being no material volume of
buying to counteract it the tendency was stead
ily but slowly downward. Liverpool opened
unchanged, then ranged a trifle higher and
finally closed weak at a loss of %@%d. Though
the pressure from the professional element Mas
sufficient to depress the price to the level at
which puts had been sold the opposition which
these offered seemed sufficient to prevent any
further decline. There was a stiff cash market
at Minneapolis and prices were quoted %@lc
higher than yesterday. As the session advanced
the indications became numerous that the early
selling by the professionals had been some
what overdone and prices took an up- turn.
Local flour exporters said that all their of
ferings of flour to the United Kingdom yes
terday had been accepted and reported sales of
200,000 bushels cash spring wheat to Liverpool
direct to-day. New York meanwhile swelled
her exports to seventy-five boat loads and the
corn market was setting a < pace which made
the wheat bulls ashamed of themselves. As
the spirits of the bulls rose those of their op
ponents drooped, and It was not, therefore, a
difficult matter to start them scrambling after
wheat. During the excitement that followed
the high price of the session was reached. De
cember %@%c higher. .
â¢ Corn was the strongest market on the floor.
Initial trades were at a slight advance, caused
by the Government report, which showed a fall
ing; off during September of two points in the
condition of the crop. The Liverpool closing
market showed an advance of \d for spot and

advance began and -were soon in competition
with other buyers in an effort to protect them-
f elves from losses Incurred by sales of these
irivileges. December closed at 30%0, an ad
vance of %c.
The bearish showing of the Government crop
report caused a slight reaction in oats at the
opening. The market rose %@%c and closed
at 28% c.
Continued alarming reports of the spread
of yellow fever in Mississippi and very large
receipts of hogs at the seven leading Western
points started provisions weak. There was a
good cosh demand, however, and that, along
with the strength of the grains, ultimately
turned the market strong and the early loss
was more than recovered. Pork improved 100,

OUR EXPORT DEMAND.
NEW TORK, Oct. 11. â The re<i?nt enormous
export demand for wheat continued on a heavy
scale to-day and begun to attract the atten
tion o' speculators generally and to-day there
was a sharp advance In the price, December
reaching 70 11-1 tic In the afternoon, which is
the highest tijfure attained on the present bull
movement. The bears, who have been per
sistently fighting advancing tendencies, were
compelled to get under cover and new pur
chases for investment account were among Iho
day's features. Probably not less than 125
loads of wheat were bought to-day for export,
making 245 loads thus far this week, or alxiut
00 bushels. For the past three w?cks
Europe has been buying wheat in this country
at the rate of about 3.500,000 buthels per week,
to say nothing of the large demand for our
corn, oats and rye. Last week the actual clear
ances of wheat and flour from the country wero
s.?i'i'.oOU bushels, or about half a million bushels
Ma of last year. Since July 1 the total
shipments are only 9,000,000 bushels behind lam
year and at the present rate are fast catching
up. Even France has been a buyer, taking all
offerings from St. Louis to-day at IVtC ad
vance and askln? for more. In addition to this
the Northwestern mills are unable to get
wheat enough to kep up their orders, as the
grain Is nearly all wanted for export. Besides
the demand for wheat to-day Europe took
about i'oo loads of corn, 225,000 bushels of oats
and IGu.OOO bushels of rye.

MRS. GOLDEN
ELOPED WITH
HER HUSBAND
Her Second Husband
Is Out for Divorce.
SHE CONFESSES BIGAMY
A LETTER IN EVIDENCE THAT
REVEALED TEE TRUTH.
Is Now Living With the Man Whom
She First Married and From
Whom She Is Not
Divorced.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 11.
Mrs. Lena H. E. Harding (.or Golden)
performed the peculiar trick of eloping
â with her own husband, although she had
to leave another husband to do so. Mrs.
Harding, or Golden, is the defendant in
a divorce suit which is now under ad
visement by Judge Greene, and in which
the evidence shows that she had com
mitted bigamy in a letter written to an
aunt, Mrs. Gunn, who resides In West
Oakland. In his testimony Dow C. Gold
en, the husband of the woman, declares
that after their marriage his wife de
serted him and went to Seattle with a
man named Elliott It. Harding, In Octo
ber, 1592, Golden married Lena Harding
in this city, and for a time they resided
on Seventeenth street. For neariy six
years everything went smoothly, but at
the end of that time Mrs. Golden sud
denly abandoned her husband and took
â with her her personal effects and her
young child that was the issue of her
former marriage.
When she eloped Mrs. Golden went
north with Mr. Harding, who had broken
up the peace of the Golden home by his
anxiety to see his child. His affection
for the child worked a reconciliation with
Its mother, and as they had never been
divorced Mrs. Hard Golden thought
It no crime to go north with her lirst
husband and live with him as though the
second marriage had never taken place.
Golden started an inquiry and found
sufficient evidence to convince him that
he had ground to have his marriage to
Mrs. Harding annulled. He also found
a letter which contained the following
strange confession and which is signed
by his supposed wife:
"I find by looking into records, etc.,
that 1 have been greatly fooled; that no
divorce decree was ever issued. My at
torney told me that I needed no papers,
but I find I could not be divorced wit
out paying the court some $o0 or so more
and getting a decree paper. Also, the law
requires six months to elapse before 1
could man and I wanted only one day,
but I was in ignorance of all this,
"I find that 1 am Elliott's wife as much
as ever. I am happy. The day before I
left, old lady Golden ordered me away |
and used the vilest language one can ]
think of, insulting me and my mother j
and all the friends that have stood by me.
Even to the baby did she talk mean.
"Poor Dow, I am sorry for him, because ;
he will know no happiness till the is dead 1
and gone, for he is too weak minded to j
listen to his own thoughts and desires. |
He is entirely under her thumb.
"LENA HAIIDIKG.""
Mrs. Golden-Hardii has made no de
fense to the divorce suit, and la now liv
ing somewhere in the north.

PATENTS THAT

SAVE LIVES
Being Now Fitted to

IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS
WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE
NARROW-GAUGE WRECK.
In a Few Weeks a Complete Train
Will Be Fitted With Devices
and Given a
Trial.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Oct. 11.
Articles of Incorporation were filed to
day by the Pacillc Car Equipment Com
pany, manufacturers of all kinds of de
vices designed to t>e used in railroad or
carrier business, with its principal place
of business in Oakland. The capital Btock
is $250,000, of which $223,000 has been sub
scribed. The directors are: J. EL Thomp
son, A. C. Rumble, \V. D. Huntington,
Richard Gorrill, M. L. Requa, G. 11.
Strong and F. W. Fry, all of this city.
The Incorporatora own some valuable
patents.
One of the patents owned by the com
pany would have prevented the accident
at the narrow-gauge mole a few months
ago, by which a fireman lost his life be
cause of a derailment of the train. By a
patent drop bar a train can be brought
to a standstill the Instant a whi
derailed. The drop-bars are attached to
each of the trucks and when a wheel
drops either inside or out the air brakes
are at once applied and the train is sud
denly stopped.
Another device is an arrangement by
which whet-Is suddenly locked by the
air brakes are prevented from sliding.
This patent la also allied with the air
brake, and like the drop-bar works au
tomatically. These devices have been
given all kinds of tests, and enough are
already male to equip one ordinary
tram. * They are being fitted to cars of
the Southern Pacific Company, and as
b..on a.s ready the train will be run on an
experimental trip.
Attorney Fry, who Is one of the di
rectors, .says that the devices are so sim
ple that railroad men invariably express
surprise that such contrivances were not
invented years ago. "There is nothing
Intricate or difficult to understand
these things," he said, exhibiting the
sample. "They all depend on the air
brakes and are connected with them. All
automatically, and our practical ex
periments have proved their simplicity
and effectiveness. Railroad men all
the country are ed in the work-
Ing of the train that is now b>i:.L,'
equipped and which will soon be ready."

Interesting Football Match Upon the

California.
BERKELEY, Oct 11. -One of the most
closely contested football games of the
a so fur was played upon the uni
versity campus this afternoon between
the Olympic lightweights and the lurke
ley fresbmi a. The play put up by both
sides throughout seemed not unworthy of
devotees of the pigskin.
The two teams lined up as follows:
Berkeley. Position. Olympics.
Puden ..." Center Gendottt
Clay Left guard Pray
North Klght guard Chad wick
Albertson L ft tackle Huff
Fergusson Right tackle Hamilton
Wa nkle Left end Htarne
Hill Right end Masters
Llppman Left half McNevin
Smith Right half Wilson
M re Fullback Garrick
Klnzie (captain).. Quarter Keller (captain)
After the first kick-off the Olympics
gained ground till within a few yards of
Berkeley's goal, and it seemed as if they
would have the game their own way. but
through the good services of More's kick
ing the ball came into the center of the
lield again, and from then on kept, for the
greater part of the time, on the Olympics
side. It was essentially a bucking and
kicking game, in which the quick work
of the Berkeley men gained the day.
At the end of the first hall neither side
had scored. Soon after the game was re
sumed More of Berkeley made the sensa
tional play of the afternoon. The ball was
: within a few yards of the Olympic line
i when More took a charge over the two
teams and landed a touchdown. lor the
i remainder of the same the Olympics were
forced to resort to strong defensive play,
: In which Wilson showed up to good effect.

JOSEPH BALCER MISSING.
He Entered a Saloon and Has Never
Been Seen Since.
Th? officers of the Kureka Society for
the Protection of Children are Investigat
ing a peculiar ease in which a married
man disappeared in a mysterious manner j
on the 15th ult. The mm'g name is Jo- ,
seph Balcer, whose family, consisting of
a wife and two little children, live at 5 |
Hanover place. On the date mentioned
he and his wife were walking- alons Mar- |
ket street, near Sixth, and he complained
of not feeling well. "Excuse me for a I
minut. ." said he, "I will return and over- |
take you a little further down the street." j
r passed into a saloon and that is i
the last the wife has seen of him. She
went back to the saloon and inquired for
her husband, but no one had noticed him
enter.
Balcer worked In a canning and pack
ing-company and was well thought of. It
is believed that he did not have much
money when last seen.
The wife cannot account for his strange
disappearance. She said that there was
nothing in the homo life nor in his busi
ness affairs that she knew of that would '
cause him to leave so suddenly. The be- |
lief is that something was the matter j
with his mind. Mrs. Balcer is nearly dis
tracted and not in a position to oarry the :
search any further, so she applied to the j
society for help.

COMMON CARRIER
NOT EXEMPT FROM
PAYING WAR TAX
Circuit Court of Michigan Lays
Down the Law as to Ex
press Companies.
Are Violating the Provisions of the Revenue
Act When They Compel Patrons to
Buy the Stamp.
CHICAGO, Oct. 11.â An opinion of
great interest In relation to the duties
of express companies has come from
the Circuit Court of Michigan. It shows
that the common carrier la not exempt
from paying the share of the war rev
enue tax allotted by Conpress. All over
the country express companies have
been trying to evade these payment:
resorting to every subterfuge likely to
Bccure delay, this beinp regarded as al
most as good as an actual victory. The
course of the Wells- Fargo Company ha?
been remarked on hen- as similar to that
of the American. It was the American
which had sought to make its patrons
Bhoulder its war tax, but its contention
vr&a so identical in character with that
of the Wells-Fargo Company that the
one opinion covers the two cases
equally well. It is given in full below:
The petition in this case is liled for the
purpose of procuring- a mandamus to com
pel the American Express Company, re
epondent. to accept goods offered to it by
certain shipper? for transportation, and to
receive and transport the same to their
destination, and it is claimed that the
express company refused to so transport
the same unless the shipper pay for the
revenue stamp which the law requires to
be affixed to the receipt, which the ex
press company -is required to give to the
shipper. The shipper having declim
do this, this application Is for the purpose
of requiring tne American Express Com
pany to so transport Bald package!
to affix the required stamp to ttie n
The rirsi question raised bj the respond
ent is that the Circuit Â«\.urt has no juris
diction over the company. fÂ° r the reason
that the respondent, the American I'.x
preas Company, is a joint stock associa
tion, and the only authority the Circuit
Court has to Issue a mandamus is under
rule 46 of the Supreme Court that "Cir
cuit Courts shall nave jurisdiction, within
their respective counties, in ail mandamus
proceedings involving the action of an offi- j
cer or board of any county, township, city
or school district, or or the Common ;
Council of any city or village. aJid the
action of any private corporation or offi
cer or board thereof."
It is contended that under this rule no
power Is granted to the Circuit O>urt to
issue writs of mandamus as against such
joint stick associations.
1 am of the opinion that it was the in
tention of the Supreme Court to include
all joint stock associations under the \
term private corporations. To hold oth
erwise would, in my opinion, be to put >
too narrow a construction upon the rule, j
for a joint stock ass to all in
tents and purposes a corporation, and I
see no good reason why. under the term
corporation, a joint .stock association
would not be included.
I think that the suit Is properly com
menced in the name of the Attorney Gen
eral, although the remedy is sought by
private parties.
The main question to be determined is,
whether the shipper or the express com
pany shall pay for the reven le stamp
required by the act of Congress. The re
spondent, the American Express Com
pany, being a common carrier, and the
question belng%one of pu st. in
which all i oda are inter
ested, and a common carrier being re
quired to receive and transport g
iÂ»o manner by whom offered, it' proper
rules iind regulations are made by thy
carrier are complied with, i set isu im
propriety in the intervention of the At
torney General in this matter, in the
application for this writ.
J ii my opinion the jurisdiction of this
court in the premises cannot be success
fully d:sp . the remedy sought;
can' only be applied to the case in hand,
and that is to compel the respondent to
receive and transport the goods and fur
nish a proper receipt In the case now
actually before tne court. 1 cannot see
how any decision of ti.is court can be
made to alitct or control any cases that
may arise in tho future.
It" was claimed upon the argument that i
the petition did not state that the i
charges were paid or offered to be paid i
upon the packages that wen; offered for
shipment; but this question was aban
doned upon the argument, aud it was left
for the court to decide it the same as if '
these charges had been tendered; so the â .
question ot the tender of these charges j
to the respondent, tJic express company,
is by the agreement of counsel eliminated
from the case.
The serious question presented for the
consideration of the court In this issue 1
is whether under the act of Congress
passed for the purpose of raising revenue
It Is rhe legal duty of the express com
pany to attach to the receipt or bill of
lading a revenue stamp as the law lv
aulres.
As I understand, the law applying to
this subject is round in schedule A of the
revenue law of iM*s, and is as follows:
"Express and freightâ lt shall be the
duty of every railroad or steamboat com
pany, carrier, express company or corpor
ation, or person whose occupation is to !
act as such, to Issue to th<? shipper or con- I
Bignor, or his agent, or person from whom
any goods are accepted for transportation,
a bill of lading, manifest or other
evidence of receipt and forwarding,
for such shipment received for car
riage and transportation, whether in
bulk or in boxes, bales, packages |
or bundles, or not so inclosed or In
cluded; and there shall be duly attached I
and canceled, as in this act provided, to
each of such bills of lading, manifests, or
other memoranda, and to such duplicate ,
thereof, a stamp of the value of one I
This is the main portion of the law ap- j
plying to the question in hand.
It is manifest to me that It is the in
tentlon of Congress to require the ex- j
press companies to deliver to the person :
offering for shipment any goods or pack- ;
ages a receipt for the .same, and it re- I
quires said receipt to have attached to it :
a revenue stamp of one cent. This makes
it clear in my mind that it is the duty of j
the express company to deliver to such !
shipper a full and complete receipt; and a ;
receipt would not be full and complete or i
legal unless it had attached to it a can- |
celed revenue stamp of the value of one j
cent.
And the same act provides that "any
failure to issue the said bill of lading,
manifest or other memorandum aa herein
provided, shall subject such railroad or i
steamboat company, carrier, express com- \
pany, or corporation or person to a pen- I
alty of $50, lor each offense, and no such ,
bill of lading, manifest, or other memo
randum shall be used in evidence unless it '
shall be duly stamped as aforesaid."
From these provisions it is clear to me
that such a receipt would not be valid as
evidence in any court of law, or good for ;
any other purpose, were It issued with- !
out the said stamp being attached; and if i
the law requiresâ as It plainly doesâ the I
express company to issue this receipt, it '
requires the issuing of such receipt as j
shall be good in law, to wit: one with the
proper stamp attached.
In the brief furnished me by counsel for
respondents it la claimed that the re
spondents decided to raise and did raise !
tnelr rates on the shipment of various
packages one cent, for the purpose of j
meeting the changed conditions made by j
the act of Congress referred to, and they
claim that under this right to affix rea
sonable charges for the transportation of !
packages they have a right to increase the i
amounts one cent for each package for
the purpose of meeting the additional ex
pense required by this stamp duty.
It is true, as I h.ive looked at this ques
tion, that the express company, the re- â¢
ppondent, had a right to determine within
reasonable limits what its charges would
be for the transportation of goods
through its office or offices; but the right
to determine and make reasonable
charges for the transportation of goods
is, In my opinion, a different thing from
the Increase of rates which had hereto
fore teen deemed reasonable, for the pur-
V'sp of evading the payment of the tax
directed by Congress for the raising of
revenue for carrying on the war. In my
opinion, this increase of amount charged
for the transportation of packages is not
in any sense for the purpose of meeting
any additional expense that the express
company may be ;Â»ut to for the carrying
â¢ - transportation of these packages, but
was added for the express purpose, as is
practically admitted In this case, of
transferring the burden of paying a por
tion of the revenue ne â¢ ssary to carry on
the war from the shoulders of the ex
preps company to those of Its patrons.
The raising of the rate of one cent upon
> ach package is, in effect, to impede tho
op. ration of the law, and therefore ille
gal. 1 do not believe, under any view
that may be taken of the law. that any
court could properly encourage a corpo
ration or person In thus avoiding a duty
which Is clearly imposed on it by the act
of Congress. It would be against public
policy to the just burdens imposed by
the law-making power to thus avoid it,
and it is clearly apparent to the court
that tids is the intention of the respond
ent. It may be burdensome upon the re
spondent to have to pay this tax. All
taxes are burdensome. But as it is im
posed clearly by the law-making power,
It Is the duty of the courts, regardless of
consequi-nces, to enforce it.
It was naid upon the argument that the
stamps were required to be affixed, put
upon articles sold by Individuals, such as
proprietary medicines and the like, and
that the price of the articles was in
creased the amount of the revenue stamp,
bo as to require the purchaser to pay it.
I think the principle In the one case is
entirely different from that in the other. ;
In the case of the proprietary medicines,
a purchaser need not purchase the article
unless he sees fit; the seller is not re
to tell it; they arc private people!
dealing with eaoli other, and they can
determine between themselves and must
determine, between themselves who must !
pay the revenue. ' As a common carrier, I
whose duty It is by law to transport these
articles, Is In the nature, to say the least,
of a quasi public body, with a duty im
posed by law, and that duty cannot be :
avoided. They must transport the ar
tides: the law requires them to do it; ,
and they must comply with all the con- i
ditions of the law before the article is to
be transported by them. The principles
In these two cases are different. It is not
a parallel case to say that private per
dealing with each other are to be
judged upon the same legal principles as ;
those involved in this case now before the :
court.

MUST PROVE
HIS WORTH
Continued from First Page.
: Mr. Williams' history was brought to
; light yesterday afternoon through the fll
' ing In the Sheriff's office of an attachment
i for $772 S5, sworn out against him by the
' Studebaker Bros." Manufacturing Com
: puny of South Bend, Ind., through their
i San Francisco branch house.
Accompanying the attachment there
! comes a sensational story from the Stude
! bakers of a prolonged chase after Wil
; liams, including vain endeavors to ascer
tain his whereabouts in San Francisco.
Spies were placed upon his track. The
final meeting between L. F. Weaver, gen
\ eral Western manager of the Studebaker
1 Company, and Williams was an excit
ing one, WilliamH growing exceedingly
j angry, swearing at Weaver and declar
ing that he never would pa.y the
; Studebaker claim. Weaver then wired
| some hot messages to the home office
In Indiana and Instructions came to
j collect the bill at any cost. He
â â  then turned thp account over to Attorney
George A. Rankin, with orders to push
the ense in the courts. At this juncture
Chester N\ Weaver, cashier of the Stude
baker house nt Tenth ririd Market streets.
In this city, s;f.v a small notice in one of
the Sunday papers stating that Williams
' was to be married. He at once notified
his brother, 1.. P. Weaver, who bad
started East on business, and also wir>-d
the South Bend office. An Immediate an
swer was received Monday last, advising
attachment proceedings. Cashier Weaver
accordingly visited Attorney Rankin and
the papers wore drawn up ready for filing
yesterday morning. The story of Wil
liams" past life was then printed In The
Call, much to tho nsTonlshpnt of the local
representative of the Studebaker house.
The expose contained news which the lo
cal house lost no time in wiring to South
Bend.
In the meantime a Deputy Sheriff, was
having serious trouble in an endeavor to
secure service on Williams. The latter ap
parently had no desire to meet the dep
uty on the rye of his wedding day, and
the latest report to the Btudebakers %vns
that the bridegronm-to-be had not been
found.
C"a<=hier Weaver, brother of tho general
manager of the Studebakor Company,
was seen at his home on Central avenue
and Fell street last night.
"I am perfectly willing to tell all of the ;
circumstances surrounding this matter,"
he remarked. "Williams owed the Stude
baker Brothers' Manufacturing Com
lay $772 iss for carriages and buggies
which he had purchased from the South
Bend factory and which had been shipped
to him at Johannesburg, South Africa. \
Ho was In the carriage and buggy busi
ness there, I believe. 110 was <iulte an
extensive customer at the outset, paying
his bills promptly. Later the payments
lagged and finally the last $772 85 could
not be collected. Williams left Smith
Africa and came to the I'nlterl States. !
The Studebakera made persistent efforts
to get their money, but to no avail. Finally
they learned that Williams had reached
San Francisco, and they forwarded their
account here to a lawyer for collection.
The lawyer could not find Williams. H'>
had a man out looking for him. but
finally gave up the job and wrote to the
South' Kend office that he could not han
dle the bill."
"This was several months ago. The
company was determined, however, t.>
get the money and sent the account to
our branch bouse here, turning It over to
my brother, the manager, lie begun a
search for Williams, putting an agent on
his track in an effort to secure an Inter
view, but of no avail. Williams was
known to bft In the city, but he was hard
to find. We thought that he kept out of
our way. It seemed strange that he could
not be located. Finally our agent ascer
tained that Williams was occasionally in
the habit of dropping In at the building
22i Parker street, and he waited there
for htm by the hour. Still there was no
finding the man we wanted. At last a tin
was received that Williams would visit
the place at a certain hour the next day,
and my brother decided to go and pre
sent the bill. He was there when Wil
liams arrived, surprised and angry. Wil
liams worked himself into a towerin-g
rage and used the most abusive language,
cursing and swearing, vowing that he did
not owe the money and would never pay
the account.
"My brother left and went to gee the
company's lawyer, Mr. Rankin. Steps to
collect the bill by drastic measures were
,-it once arranged and my brother went
PJast on business, leaving the matter in
my hands. I had the attachment papers
drawn up Monday morning, intending to
have them filed on Tuesday. What was
my surprise when 1 saw In Tuesday's
Call the whole story of Williams' career.
1 bad supposed that I knew something
about him before, but it was evident that
1 had labored under a sad mistake. What
effect the revelations will have on the
settlement of our claim I cannot predict,
lie owes us the money. There 1b no
doubt on that score. Whether he hae the
mi'iins to pay I cannot say. One of our
agents who was tracing him up some
time ago found that he wns staying at a
boarding house on Bush street frequented
by miners.
"I do not know anything definite about
his resources. T"p to latest accounts this
afternoon the deputy sheriff had not
succeeded In serving the papers on Wil-
ilams."
Deputy Sheriff Richard O'Connor had
an exciting experience yesterday after
noon in attempting to servo the attach
ment writ upon "Williams. At 3:30 o'clock.
In company with an attorney represent
ing the Studebaker people, he called at
1105 Bush street, where Williams resides,
and where hip personal effects are sup
posed to be located. An elderly gentle
man came to the door In response to the
summons and the following conversation
took place:
"Does Mr. Williams live here?" asked
O'Connor.
"Yes, but he Isn't at home," was the
reply.
"When will he be In?"
"I do not know. Maybe not at all to
day."
"Then I guess I'll come in and wait."
"No you won't! I'm going down town
nnd do' not propose to have an unknown
man in my house while I am away."
""Would you kindly show me Williams'
room?"
"What's your business? Who are you?
You've plenty of cheek. Get out!" The
door closed In the faces of the deputy and
the attorney. The door remained closed
and though they waited for some time,
no one entered or left the building. Dep
uty O'Connor will make another effort to
perform his duty in the premises to-day.

SCORCHING RESOLUTIONS
SCANDAL OVER DISEASED FOOD
FOR SOLDIERS REVIVED.
All Who Were Connected With the
Case Come Under the Censure
of the Butchers' Board
of Trade.
The Butchers' Board of Trade held a
lively meeting last eveplng in Stanford
Hall, In the Alcazar building, on O'Farrell
street. The sole matter before the board
j was the case of M. Samson, the Oak
| land butcher who sold beef infected with
j the bacilli of tuberculosis to the soldiers
of the Eighth California Regiment.
The report of the committee appointed
to Investigate the matter was strongly
condemnatory of the Oakland butcher,
and at next Tuesday evening's meeting
resolutions will be passed condemning not
only him, but the Western Meat Company
! at Baden, the wholesalers, who sold the
: meat to Samson, and the United States
; Meat Inspection Bureau, whose tag de-
I daring the meat not diseased was found
I upon the lot sold to the soldiers.
Following is the report of the committee
i upon which the resolutions will be baaed:
To the Butchers Board of Trade: We, the '
committee appointed at a previous meeting to I
I Investigate the matter of diseased meats fur- i
j nished by M. Samson of Oakland to the sol- >
[ diers of the Eighth Regiment. U. S. V., of I
I California, have procured a certified tran- â 
! script of testimony given before Judge I-aw
; rcnce in trial or said M. Samson.
j And we find from his testimony that although
' M. Samson Is acquitted of criminal Intent In |
selling the meat the testimony proves con
clusively that the meat was simply rotten with i
bacilli of tuberculosis and poisonous as an
' article of food: also that the meat was slaugh- '
tered by and purchased from the Western Meat i
1 Company. That it was also inspected and ,
I stamped as free from disease by the United '
j States Inpector of Meats.
The committee recommends that the Butch- :
I ers' Board of Trade strongly condemns the ac- !
1 tion of M. Samson in furnishing said diseased i
j meat for the consumption of our soldier boys; j
! the Western Meat Company for slaughtering ,
It and disposing of It.
And we further recommend that a communi
i cation be sent to the Department of Agricul
ture at Washington, D. C, under whose super- :
' vision the meats are Inspected, calling their
j attention to the criminal Inefficiency of the i
Inspection Bureau at this place.

CLEVER COUP Of
THE DEFENDERS
OF MRS. BOIKIN
They Rob Chief Lees
of Right of Appeal.
NEW WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
CASE GOES TO THE SUPERIOR
COURT FOR SETTLEMENT.
Judge Cook Dismisses the Old "Writ
and With Other Superior Judges
Will Consider thÂ«
New.
After all, the Supreme Court Is not to
flecid< whether or not Mrs. Cordelia Bot
klnis a fugitive from the Justice of Dela
ware. By a clever coup effected ester
day by the defense the linal settlement
of 'the extradition problem was thrown
Into the Superior Court, and Judge Car
roll Cook, sitting in bank with other of
the Superior Court Judges whom he may
Select, will render the ultimate decision.
When Governor â  -id,! announced re
cently that he would issue his warrant
of extradition he reserved his tight to re
voke that Instrument; and he exacted a
promise from the prosecution and defense
that no steps would be taken to remove
Mrs. Botkln outside the State before
gome tribunal had rendered a decision
;upon the questions involved.
It was practically agreed that either
the Supreme or Circuit Court would be
asked to do this upon a writ of habeas
corpus, returnable before the court in
Jjank.
Yesterday morning after Attorney Gen
eral Fitzgerald had handed Chief Lees
the warrant which Governor iJudd nan
eignrd on Monday, George Knight agreed
to meet the Chief, McVey and the officer
who was to servo the Governor's war
rant, at the Chief's office in half an hour.
Simultaneous with Knight's arrival at
the City Hall Detective McVey was. to
his astonishment; served with a new writ
of habeas corpus, returnable before
Judge Carroll Cook In the Superior Court
at 1 o'clock. McVey was inclined at first
to fight ihe service, as he claimed that
lie ha not charge of the prisoner, and
that there was already one writ pend
ing before the same tribunal.
The no' ice was left with him, however,
and he appeared in court at the appoint
ed hour. Chief Lees was served with a
similar paper when he arrived In the
the courtroom with Mrs. Botkin.
Attorney Knight asked that the original

Included McVey's name as well as that

Judge Cook assented and appointed
Monday as the day when he and his col
leagues would, sluing in bank, hear ar
gument upon the petition.
The reason for this sudden move on the
part of the defense was made known by
George Knight, who said:
"If we had applied to the Circuit Court
for a writ, as the Supreme Court sug
gested to me, the prosecution would, we
think, have had the right of appeal If our
petition had been granted.
".From the Superior Court they can take
no appeal in habeas corpus, and if our
writ is granted all that Chief' Lees will
have left to do will be to file an informa
tion or get an indictment against Mrs.
Botkii for murder done in thia State, or,
discharge her from custody.
"An appeal from the Circuit Court might
lit-.- r this woman Jn jail for a year and
â we don't propose to stand that if we can
help it."

Eisi>- Edwarda and not Minnie Hall
Is the name of the variety ac
tress who tried to end her sorrows Mon
day afternoon by jumping into the bay off
the Howard street wharf.
Yesterday she procured a search war
rant in Judge Conlan's court for the re
covery of her trunk, which she claimed
â¢was being Illegally detained by Madame
Ferlot, a lodging house keeper at 724
California street. She valued Its contents
at $200.
She stated that she came from Seattle
about a Week ago on a pleasure trip and
on arriving here she met a man named
Benjamin Smith, whom she had become
acquainted with in Denver. She was in
duced by him to go to 724 California
Btreet, where he lived, and he beat and
abused her because she refused to lead
B. life of shame. Finally he took the key
of her trunk and drove her out of the
house. In her despair she attempted to
drown herself.
She has been provided with a home in a
private family and the police say they
will arrest Smith for vagrancy and petty
larceny in stealing the key of her trunk.

Terrible Accident to Miss Minerva Lyon Wfiife
Ascending in the Hotef Savou
Elevator.
MISS MINERVA LTON plung
ed down the elevator shaft
at the Hotel Savoy about 11
o'clock yesterday forenoon
and sustained Injuries Which the
been for naught. Its pood efforts have
been recently testified to by letters re
ceived by the- president from the ofl
of the various companies of Boldiers who
were the recipients of kindness and favor I
â when they were most in need of it. |
Among the prominent letters are two
received from officers of the First Ten
nessee Regiment, and one from Governor
\V. A. Pochards of Wyoming.
Captain W. J- Whitthorn of Company
B, First Tennessee Ir.fa.ntry, mentions
that the ladies have not only been kind
to the Boldiers, but have given happiness
to homes and comfort to the heart of
many a mother in dpar old Tenni
and that nothing on earth can occur
which -will cause the members of h!a
company to cease loving the splendid i
women of California. In conclusion he j
says: "We are ordered to Manila., and
trust the opportunity may occur to prove
ourselves In some degree worthy of the
hospitality shown us here. The Califor
nia soldiers have been our friends, and
we hope to make those in Manilaâ your
sons and brothersâ our friends and j
brothers also."

He Charges That the Defendants
Have Appropriated Five Thou
sand Dollars and a Lot
of Property.
It is exported that Thomas A. Burns,
JÂ«*hn J. O'Brien. Edward D. Swift and
George B. Graham will be arraigned be
fore Police Judge Low this morning for
, Iracy to defraud the city through
false tmd fraudulent bills for lumber pre
sented to the School Hoard.
The form for the warrants was drawn
up lntft evening by Assistant County At
torney Dunn, the complainant being
Chairman Irving, of the committee on the
Board of Education of the Grand Jury.
School Director Burns and Contractor
Swift were both at the city building yes
terday, prepared to surrender themselves.
School Inspector O'Brien and Assistant In-
Bpector Graham are said to be awaiting
the summons to appear in court and will
be on hand to-morrow.
The warrants, as drawn up, state that
Burns, O'Brien, Swift and Graham have
conspire! to defraud the city out of cer
tain sums of money and several hun
dred thousand feet of lumber. It charges
that between June, 1897. and January, 1888,
1.104,940 feet of lumber was ordered for
the School Department and only 649,714
feet was delivered, the defendants repre
senting that the. entire amount had been
reci ived. and submitting false claims for
455,226 feet at a value or $5000. The war
rant further charges that the defendants
â¢ u-d tills money and appropriated it
to their own use, and did thereby willfully
and unlawfully, fraudulently, knowingly

FORESTS MUST BE PROTECTED.
A Determined Movement Started by
the State Board of Trade.
For some time 7>ast the manager of the
State Board of Trade has been receiving
communications from people in the coun
try relative to the destruction of the
forests of the coast by fire, and yester
day at the meeting of the board action
was taken.
The seriousness of the subject was fully
appreciated by the members of the board,
who passed a resolution declaring that
the destruction of forests demands the
immediate attention of every peace offi
cer and citizen of the State. The
board will request the Board of Yosemite
Commissioners, the Sierra Club, the For
eetry Commission, all of the prospective
legislators and county officers to co-ope
rate in preventing this destruction. Re
quests will be made, to the State officials
and county officers to use their best ef
forts to cause the arrest of any one even
suspected of forest arson. Every legis
lative candidate will be asked to do all
in his power, if elected, to provide for the
proper policing of all of the forest lands
of the State and for the punlstiment of
any one found setting fires or causing
fires by carelessness, while camping or
prospecting.
The members of the board will make it
a personal matter to have laws passed
for the preservation of California's tim
ber. Communications will be sent by the
board to all of the counties -where there
In charge, that lady stepped out.
He closed the door, at the same
time starting up the cage, intend
ing to convey Miss Lyon to the floor
above. The boy does not know Just
how the accident occurred, but he
believes Miss Lyon opened the door
after the elevator started, and in
attempting to allpht th c in porno
manner thrown under the -cage,
which had cleared the floor by near
ly three feet, and do-n the shaft,
a distance of twenty-five or thirty
feet.
The boy gave the alarm immedi
ately ... v acVerui eiaployea iueitcU
to the unfortunate lady's assist
ance. She was unconscious and
her head was covered with blood.
The ambulance was summoned and
Miss Lyon was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where her sister
soon Joined her, Drs. Weil and
lirunell examined the victim's in
juries and found she had sustained
a compound fracture of the frontal
bone, the skull being badly shat
tered from above the eye to the top
of the forehead. In addition one
of the bones of the lower right arm
was fractured and there were indi
cations of serious internal injuries.
It was apparent that Miss Lyon
had fallen head first and struck the
concrete which covers the bottom of
the shaft on her head and right
arm.
After her Injuries were dressed
she was placed in a cot in the fe
male ward. She did not regain
consciousness all the afternoon, and
the doctors are of the opinion that
her chances of recovery are exceed
ingly slender.
Mrs. Gates, the sister of the In
jured lady. and several employes of
the hotel have another theory of
the manner In which the accident
occurred. They think she left tho
elevator at the second floor and af
ter she had alighted, seeing her mis
take, attempted to re-enter it.
They think the door was not
latched, although the cage had gone
up, and that Miss Lyon unwittingly
walked into the shaft. The lady
Who rode up in the elevator wim
Miss Lyon says she left the cage
first and cannot say whether Uit
young lady followed her. Her at
tention was first attracted to the
accident by hearing Miss Lynn
scream as she plunged down th<
shaft. The elevator was then same
distance above the floor.

the pn-ss co-operate In this movement.
The members hope that by the time the
Legislature meets the subject will be so
weil understood that protective measurr-s
â will be passed and provision made for
their enforcement.

THE TROOPS SELECTED.
First Washington Will Be the First
of the Regiments to Go.
While no definite orders assigning the
troops to the various transports have as
yet been iscued by Major General Mer
riam, it is generally understood at de
partment headquarters that the force* to
sail upon the Senator, Valencia and Ohio
have been determined upon, and that In
ten days these vessels will have left for
Manila. The Senator is to carry the
Third Battalion of the Twenty-third In
fantry, the recruits of the Second Ore
gon Regiment and enough men of the Cal
ifornia Hea y Artillery to make up the
Senator"* qu. ta of mm) men, which is the
nunil.er allotted to the ship. The Valen
cia and th" Ohio are to take between
tlmm the First Washington Regiment
and the remainder of the California
Heavy Artillery. The departure of these
three transports will leave only the
Twentieth Kansas. Fifty-tirst low'a and
Tennessee regiments. These commands,
with General Miller and hia headquar
ters, v.ill sail just ns rapidly as the trans
ports arrive and are fitted out to make
the return trip to Manila. The Senator
will doubtless sail the first of the week
and the Valencia and possibly the Ohio
may also get away next week. General
Miller wants to sa.il on the Newport, and
this transport should be the first to Ball
after the Ohio leaves, bo that General
Miller may be able to overtake the troops
first leaving before they reach Manila.
There will be no effort made to get the
transports away as a fleet, but upon the
contrary they will be dispatched just as
rapidly as they are ready.
Most of the soldiers of the Sixth Regi
ment left 'yesterday upon their furlough
of thirty days. Only a detail for the pur
pose of guarding the regimental property
remained behind. The Seventh Regiment
will break camp at 6 o'clock to-morrow
morning and leave the Presidio for good.
The line of march will be down Van Ness
to Golden Gate avenue and thence to
Market and down Market to the ferry.
A dispatch received at department ht-ad
nuarters yesterday afternoon announced
that the companies would proceed to the
town nearest the homes of the men.
This is done for the convenience of the
soldiers, and It will also save them the
expense of transportation from Los An
geles to their homes, which in some in
stances is a considerable item.

Legal Obstruction Met by the Ap
praisers of the Sutro Estate.
The accounts of Mrs. Emma Merritt, as
guardian of the late Adolph Sutro, were
settled yesterday by order of Judge Cof
fey. One Item necessary to effect a set
tlement of the account was found too
high, that of the three appraisers,
Thomas Magee, David Rich anJ Colonel
Thomas Little, who asked $250 each in
compensation for their services. Judge Cof
fey refused to allow this charge onashow
lng that only three days had been occu
pied in the appraisement. But $5 a day
is allowed by tho luw and as the court
failed to find a reason why a greater
amount should be allowed Colonel Little
and Magee waived their fees and the mat
ter of the compensation of Rich was left
open.
The appraisers, it is thought, will look
to the heirs for compensation independent
of the order of the court.

RETURN OF THE NEWPORT
GENERAL MERRITT WAS GLAD
TO LEAVE MANILA.
Several Sick Soldiers Home Again,
but the j*tain Body Will Come
on Board the Rio
Janeiro.
The Newport, which left San Fran
cisco on June 28 with General Merritt
and staff aboard, arrived from Manila
yesterday afternoon. She left there on
September 13, via Nagasaki, but did
not call at Honolulu. The Newport car-
ried only ten passengers, among them
being Major W. A. Simpson, formerly
adjutant on the staff of General Otis,
and who is on his way to Washington;
Captain James G. Blame Jr., Lieuten
ant Conklin. Douglass White, C. C. Carl-
ton, Washington correspondent of The
Call; Pierre Boerlnger, The Call's ar
tist, who accompanied the first expedi
tion to the islands, and five or six pri
vate soldiers, viz., J. Vetenburg, Wil
liam Roe, W. S. Saylor and O. R.
Barnes, of the Twelfth Minnesota,
who has either been honorably dis
charged or granted leave by reason of
physical disability. The main body of
sick and disabled soldiers will, however,
come on the Rio Janeiro. There will be
nearly 150 of them in all, in charge of
Dr. Paywalt, and among them are a
number of Californlans, whose names
are published elsewhere. There is still
a large number of sick soldiers left in
the hospital at Manila, for it was
thought best only to remove those who
were well able to stand the long voy
age. When the Newport sailed it was
understood that the Rio Janeiro would
leave on Thursday, September 15, two
days later than the Newport, although
it was not absolutely settled that she
would sail on that date. The Rio was
to cross to Hongkong and then steam
to Nagasaki. If she sailed on the ex
.ii date she will be due in San
Francisco in about four or live dayb,
us she had orders to sail only ten knots
an hour, the same slow rate of speed
made by the Newport.
The latter vessel brought little news.
Everything In the Philippines was in
statu quo, the Americans, Spaniards
and Filipinos alike awaiting news from
the Paris commission, as well as from
the "Filipino Congress," which was
called by Aguinaldo to meet at Malo
los, just north of Manila, in October.
Rumors of a conspiracy among the
Spanish clericals were rife, and were
given some credence at the army head
quarters. It was thought that the
Spanish clerical party was endeavor
ing to create discord among the Fili
pino soldiers, already disappointed and
discontented, at not being able to enter
Manila under arms, and that General
Juan Blanco might bo incited to com
mit some overt act against the Ameri
can troops, so that active warfare
would seem to be yet in progress when
the commission met in Paris to con
sider, among other things, the disposi
tion of the Philippines. Indeed, an out
break was looked for at any tinio. On
September 12 there were repoits of
trouble in the Malate district. Troops
were hurried across the bay from Ca
vite and from other points, but upon
their arrival at Malate found every
thing qui'^t.
Major Simpson has been assigned to
duty in Washington, and carries with
him to the capital official reports from
General Otis. ThfÂ» major politely de
clined to discuss the nature of General
Otis' report, but it is generally under
stood to contain nothing of importance,
it being merely a report of the condi
tion of the various troops; but from the
fact that most, if not all, of the trans
ports have either returned or will in
the near future, it would seem to be the
plan to kef-p the troops in the Islands
for an indefinite period. Nothing posi
tive will be known concerning the dis
position of the island troops, however,
unttl after the conclusion of the Paris
conference.
-Captain Blalne did not have long to
remain in the islands. He went over on
the St. Paul, one of the last vessels to
arrive at Manila, and had hardly a
chance to look around before he was
ordered to return. He is on his way to
Washington.
Mr. Carlton, Washington correspond
ent of The Call, realizing that the dis
position of the Philippines would be one
<>f the most important matters dis
cussed in Washington at this winter's
session, especially when the Senate is
called upon to ratify the treaty of peace,
made a trip to Manila, going via the
Suez canal.
"In Hongkong I had the pleasure of
meeting General Merritt, who was en
route to Paris," said he to a Call rep
resentative last night. "I think he
was very glad to leave Manila. He did
not find it a desirable place even for
temporary residence. I was one of a
small party congregated in the Hong
kong Hotel, where General Merritt was
stopping. Some one put this very
frank, although abrupt, question to
him:
" 'General, what shall we do with "the
Philippines?'
" 'How are we going to get rid of
them?" he asked in return.
"This was considered by all of those
present as quite significant of General
Merritt's attitude with respect to the
islands before the commission at Paris,
and it was thought, too â and very rea
sonably â that General Merritt's advice
might be a very considerable factor in
shaping the policy of the administra
tion. As for my own personal views
as to our retention or rejection of the
islands, I will not intrude them upon
the public, for I do not believe any one
would be interested in knowing.
"As for the situation m the islands
when we left Manila, The Call's read
ers may find it fully reported in a let
ter from Mr. Sheridan, correspondent
at Manila.
"At Nagasaki we saw the Zealandia,
which, as you have doubtless been told
by the China's passengers, was caught
in a typhoon off the island of Formosa.
Her repairs were nearly completed and
her captain thought that possibly she
might be ready to sail on Sunday, fol
lowing the Newport's departure. This
would be five days later.
"Doubtless you have heard of the
suicide of Chaplain Freeman of the
Baltimore. He was on the Zealandia,
bound for Yokohama, where he was to
meet his wife, after a long absence
from her. According to the Zealan
dia's officers and passengers, the chap
lain was a man of delicate physique
and nervous temperament. He was
moody and subject to fits of melan
choly. When he spoke, which was at
rare intervals, it was of his wife and
of his home at Loganeport, Indiana,

A NINETY-EIGHT DINNER.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson and the
King's Daughters Now Making
Ready.
The Rev. John A. H. Wilson of tho
Howard-street Methodist Church, with
the King's Daughters of his congrega
tion, has mapped out a plan for giving
to the poor of the city, irrespective of
sect, a Thanksgiving dinner this year
on a new idea.
Instead of drawing together those who
are in need of a good dinner on this
day, it is the Intention of the people of
the 'Howard-street church, provided the
funds Justify it, to provide a family din
ner for such of those in need, the meals
to be carried in baskets to their
homes. The Daughters have made a
hasty canvass of such families as are
now in the city, and have found as many
as 500. Of course there will be more be
tween now and Thanksgiving day. But
this makes no difference, all will he
looked after without partiality if the
funds collected be sufficient.
Added to this tne pastor and his cneer
ers have another innovation for a
Thanksgiving dinner to young men who
are scattered about the city in lodging,
houses far away from their homes. To
these it is proposed to sell tickets at 25
cents which will admit the holder to the
dinner table, and no questions asked or
obligations exchanged. At this table a
first-class Thanksgiving dinner will be
served â as good, if not better, than at
any first-class restaurant in the city. In
thfs way merchants and others can aid
a worthy person, man or woman, by pre
senting him or her with a dinner ticket.
at the same time relieving the holder ol
the embarrassment of being looked upon
as eating at the table of charity.
