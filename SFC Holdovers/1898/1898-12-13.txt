VOLUME LXXXV.-NO. 13.
CITIZEN JUDGES OF MRS. BOTKIN LISTEN
TO THE STORY OF THE DOVER TRAGEDIES
Relatives of the Murdered Women
Tell flow Death Entered
Their Home.
THE horrifying story of the mur
der of Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Dun
ning and Mrs. Ida Deane has been
told to the jury that is trying
Mrs. Cordelia Botkln for the
crime. The prosecution began the ac
tual presentation of evidence yesterday
morning, and before the day was trver
every Incident In the dreadful scheme
of assassination had been described.
Even the cold, dry formalism of the
law could not rob the recital of its
dramatic interest.
The host of listeners that crowded
the court room of Judge Cook followed
with eager, silent attention every de
tail of the plot of the poisoner as it
was presented in question and answer
by the officers and witnesses of the
State. A picture of the Pennington
household at Dover and the devasta
tion that the murderous impulse of
some fiend swept through it was drawn
slowly and clearly as each witness
came and went.
And when the day was over not one
word had been said to indicate who
the cruel assassin is. The prosecution
has not come to that development of
its proof, but is expected to do so to
day. It will now begin to present its
case against Mrs. Botkin to connect
her directly and maliciously with the
awful murders at Dover, and to de
mand of the Jury that her life be given
in exchange for those taken in murder.
The scene in the court room yester
day was most dramatic. As the rela
tives and friends of the murdered wo
men told in chapters the story of the
crime every eye was turned upon Mrs.
Botkin, who maintained a composure
that seemed almost to be unconcern.
It appeared to be a most unusual oc
currence that the prosecution should,
during the day, win its most import
ant point through a slip of the guarded
movements of the defense.
The prosecution will seek to demon-
strct- that the fieiui who mailed the
package of death to Mrs. Dunning also
wrote the anonymous letters which
that woman received more than a year
!>â¢ fnre her d~ath. An effort will then
be made to prove that Mrs. Botkin ia
guilty of both acts. At the stage
reached yesterday in the proceedings
the prosecution could find no legal way
in which to connect the letters with the
package. John B. Pennington, the
father of the murdered woman, was on
the witness stand, and, sfls a matter of
fact, believed from a close comparison
that the letters and the address on the
package were written by the same per
son. The prosecution was not per
mitted to introduce this fact yesterday,
but the defense did so through a ques
tion asked in cross examination by At
torney Knight. This will relieve the
lawyers of the State of much prelimi
nary legal fencing in placing what they
believe to be the facts of the case be
fore the consideration of the jury.
The first witness for the prosecution
was Thomas M. Gooden, the postmaster
of Dover, Del. The introduction of
this witness as the first in the case
indicated the plan of the State to pre
sent the dreadful facts of the murder
of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane in
chronological order. In a dry, legal,
halting way the recital of death was to
be made to the jury. The first witness
was nervous, excitable, emphatic. He
was sure of his ground and fretted un
der the cross examination of Attorney
Knight.
Gooden related on the witness stand
no fact that was not already known to
the public. He told the circumstances
under which the package of poisoned
candy reached Dover on August 9 of
this year. The prosecution, it was
evident, had determined to trace the
box of bonbons on its mission of death
from the moment it arrived in the mail
at Dover. This method of proof in
Itself excited interest. It was thought
that the facts and circumstances con
necting Mrs. Botkin with the purchase
and disposition of the box would first
be shown, but Assistant District At
torney Hosmer and Attorney General
White of Delaware preferred to estab
lish first the fact that a crime had been
committed and then to expose the per
petrator. This plan of procedure will
make the conduct of the trial excep
tionally dramatic.
Postmaster Gooden told how the
package, which he Identified on the
stand, came through the mail to Dover
and was placed, after the distribution
of the mail in the postbox of J. B.
Pennlngton. Attorney Knight badger
ed the witness, but did not break him
in his position. A tilt between Knight
â¢and Hosmer followed and then the
prosecuting officer proceeded to trace
the box of death into the Pennington
home.
The next link In the chain was sup
plied by Harry C. Pennington, nephew
of the murdered women. The boy told
how he took the package from the
postofflce and carried it to the home
of his aunt, where he was spending a
vacation. The young witness related
the incidents that followed, the opening
of the box, the eating of the sweet
meats, the subsequent sickness, suffer
ing and death, it was while this boy
ish witness was on the stand that the
defense indicated the first element of
its plans.
Even- effort will be made to interject
the single element of reasonable doubt
that will be sufficient to save Mrs Bot
k!n from conviction. In Knighfs
cross-examination of Harry Penning
ton and of every following witness of
The San Francisco Call
the day the most stubborn endeavor
was made to cloud the proof of the
prosecution that the murdered women
and their friends and family had par
taken of the candy and then had be
come dangerously ill.
Knight wished to know what the
WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION TELLING THE STORY OF THE DOVER MURDERS.
THE Prosecutors of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin Made Substantial Progress Yesterday in the Presentation of Their Case Against the Accused Woman. The
Tragic Story of the Death of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane Was Told in Dramatic Chapters by Men, Women and Children, Who Had Personal
Knowledge of the Events They Described. The Recital Was Given From the Moment the Package of Death Was Received at the Dover Postoffice
Until the Bodies of the Poisoner's Victims Were Interred.
Pennington family had eaten far din
ner that day of death. He demanded
to know where the food was purchased,
and who cooked it. As the lawyer pro-
gressed his cross-examination became
more insinuating. There might have
been a rebellious and dangerous ser
vant in the house ready to avenge
with murder a real or a fancied griev
ance. There might have been poison
in the cooking utensils; in the drinking
water. Knight was doing his best to
show that death under conditions that
existed at the Pennington home might
have been brought into the household
in a dozen different ways.
After young Pennington had told of
his terribje suffering after eating the
poisoned candy, he was released from
the witness stand, and was followed by
Leila Deane, his cousin, and the young
daughter of one of the murdered wo
men. The appearance of this child as
a witness gave a pathetic interest to
the trial. The girl was the first of sev
eral witnesses who appeared to tell
their sad story of death In their home.
The father of both murdered women,
the husband and daughter of one of
them and friends of both told to the
Jury the story of heartless murder that
shocked the continent. There was bit
terness in their voices, and even in
the attitude of the children a sternness
that meant the seeking of vengeance
for the guilty one. More than one
glance of hatred was sent from the
witness stand toward the woman who
is on trial for her life. The children
SAX FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1898.
HARPER'S PETITION IN
THE SUPREME COURT
THE State Supreme Court has not yet officially considered the application made by "W. X Harper for a writ
of prohibition to prevent Judge Cook from continuing with the trial of Mrs. Botkin. Through some misun
derstanding in the office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court the application was not properly presented
before the tribunal, and could not therefore be orderly considered. This defect will be remedied this morning
by the attorney for Harper, whose petition will then be properly presented.
While the Supreme Justices have taken no official notice of the application, they considered it informally
at great length yesterday afternoon. The Justices have still to consider some of the points and authorities
raised by Harper's attorney, as the case is considered to be of far too great importance to be dismissed without
full deliberation. It is intimated, however, that Harper's petition will be denied. Such a decision would be of
vital import to the defenders of Mrs. 80-tkln.
watched her with a wondering: horror,
for they do not understand that accu
sation dc-Gs not always mean either
guilt or conviction.
When court adjourned for the day
the following witnesses for the State
had been examined: Thomas M.
Gooden, Postmaster of Dover; Harry
C. Pennington, nephew of the murder
ed women; Leila Deane, daughter of
Mrs. Deane; Miss Josephine Bateman,
friend of the family; Ethel Jane Mil
lington, friend of Lelia Deane; J. D.
Deane, husband of one of the murdered
women; John B. Pennington, father of
the murdered women. This aged wit
ness was still under cross-examination
when court adjourned for the day. The
trial will be resumed this morning.
The defense took â¢ some encourage
ment from the testimony of Miss Bate
man, who established the fact, as far
as assertion may do so, that she ate
some of the poisoned candy and then
found crystals of arsenic in her mouth.
Miss Bateman was very sure that the
candy contained the poison. She had,
almost immediately after eating the
candy, suffered from arsenical poison-
Ing. The lady was quite as sure that
the poison was crystallized arsenic.
The defense seemed to consider this
assertion as of great importance to
Mrs. Botkin. The prosecution will In
troduce evidence, however, to show
that Mrs. Botkin purchased both pow
dered and crystallized arsenic and that
both forms of the drug were found In
the death-giving candy.
As the important results of the first
day of trial the prosecution has shown
that a double murder was committed at
Dover. It has been shown that friends
of the Penningtons, who did not dine
with them that night in August but
who did partake of the deadly candy,
suffered the same symptoms of sick
ness that reached a climax In the death
of Mrs. Deane and Mrs. Dunning.
There is now also legal testimony to
show the belief of the father of the
murdered women that the fiend who
mailed the package of candy from this
city sent also the anonymous letters a
year before to Mrs. Dunning.
The Morning Session.
When proceeding's commenced in the
morning all witnesses were excluded from
the room at the request of Attorney
Knight for Mrs. Botkin. The first witness
called was Thomas M. Qooden, Postmas
ter at Dover, Del. He was questioned by
Assistant District Attorney Hosmer as to
the 5:58 mall. This was from the north
and west and any mall from California
would arrive in that mail. He testified
that he placed a package In John B. Pen
nington's box. He described It as an ob
long package addressed to Mrs. John P.
Dunning. It was placed In Mr. Penning
ton's lock box. The witness was sure of
this, as he handled the box three times,
it being among the packages of mall that
were addressed to people in his district of
the city. He was shown the wrapper
which was taken from the box of candy
and identified it as the one which In
closed the poisoned candy.
Attorney Knight tried to get the wit
ness to tell how he identified this particu
lar box, when so many packages were
handled daily.
Under cross-examination by Attorney
Knight the witness testified that his at
tention was called to the wrapper on the
box, owing to the number of times he
handled it. He handled the mail for about
350 private boxes and no other large pack
age was received that day. No amount
of questioning could cause him to recall
any large package addressed to any one
else. He described minutely the manner
of handling packages of mail in the Do
ver Postomce. He unlocked the mail bag
when it was brought to the station and
the janitor spread the contents out on the
table. Three distributor* then took It in
hand and placed It in the various private
receptacles. Mr. Knight questioned him
so exhaustively on the matter of any
other large package being received that
Assistant District Attorney Hosmer ob
jected, and the representative of the de
fense finally let him go.
Harry C. Pennlngton, the sixteen-year
old nephew of the murdered women, was
the next witness called. Under the ques
tioning of Mr. Hosmer he told of the part
he played in the tragedy at Dover. It was
his custom nightly to go to the Postofflce
for mail for the family. In whose house he
was spending the summer. On the fateful
night in August he found some letters and
an oblong package in Mr. Pennington's
private box. The package was addressed
to Mrs. John P. Dunning, and he iden
tified the wrapper shown as being the one
around the box. He took it home and
gave it to his aunt, who was sitting on the
porch. It was examined first to determine
from whom it came. Mrs. Dunning opened
It and found it contained candy, a small
white handkerchief and a note "Love to
yourself and baby. Mrs. C." He identi
fied the chocolate as having been in the
box and told of the persons present who
partook of it. He ate some of the hard
pieces of candy and also some pepper
mints. After that he with other members
of the family took a walk and had no
symptoms of illness that night. The next

ress in the Presentation of
Its Case.
morning he had a headache, was vomiting
and had an unquenchable thirst. This
lasted for a day and a half, when he re
covered. He told of the death of Mrs.
Deane on Thursday and of Mrs. Dunning
on Friday night. He said that neither
Mr. Deane nor Mr. Pennington was ill.
He had not seen them eat any candy.
Mr. Knight took the witness in hand
for cross-examination and drew from him
that the house in which he lived at Dover
was a large roomy one. He could not
tell how many rooms it contained, 'me
housework was done by a colored woman
whose name he did not know, and she was
assisted by a colored man. He told of the
supper they ate on the night the canay
was received. It consisted chiefly of fish
and corn fritters. The former was not
canned, but he was not so sure about the
corn. He was asked if his grandfather
ever had any trouble with the colored
woman. Objection was raised to this and
sustained. He then went over the ground
as to getting the mail each evening. He
told of receiving the package of candy
and of taking it to Mrs. running. She
opened it and passed it around. They
wondered who sent? it, but were not able
tc determine. He took three lumps of
candy. Mrs. Pennington took one, but
imrntdiately spat it out. Baying it was
no good. The grandfather did not take
aiiy.
Plp l tie poison did not begin to affect him
until the next morning, when he had a
headache and vomiting. In answer to
a question he said he had not discussed
the symptoms of arsenical poisoning with
anybody. He said he moped around all
day, not knowing what was the matter
with him or with the others who were
ailing. No one told him what was tne
matter and he did not know. The taste
left in his mouth was different from that
left by other illnesses. But he was un
able to describe it. To a Juror he said
that he first felt ill about 7 o'clock in
the morning. He had eaten nothing after
supper but the candy, and did not feel
ill before going to bed.
Leila Deane. tne 14-year-old daughter of
one of the murdered women, was the next
witness to take the stand. She iaentifled
the wrapper as having inclosed the box
of candy, which she described. Upon re
ceipt of the box the members of the fam
ily on the porch of the Pennington house
tried to decipher the marks on the box
in order to determine whence It came. "I
read 'Francis,' " she said, "and that was
all X could make out. At the time we ud
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
not agree that it came from San Finn-
Cisco." Mr. Hosmer showed the jury
where the stamp was marked across the
face of the stamps. Miss Deane identified
the note shown her, but could not identify
the handkerchief, which she said, how
ever, looked like the one shown her by
the prosecuting officer.
' She took some of the hard candy and
then made a call, accompanied by her
mother. The next day she could not sit
up and remained in bed all day. The at
tention of the doctors was given entirely
to Mrs. Deane and Mrs. Dunningâ they
did not prescribe for her at all. She did
not recover until Saturday. In the mean
time both her mother and her aunt suc
cumbed to the poison. Mr. Knight took
the witness and tried to draw from her
the information as to a possible quarrel
between her grandfather and Rosy, the
colored woman employed as cook. The
prosecution took exception to this and
the objection was sustained.
She explained that she felt ill when she
got up in the morning. She "was languid
and dizzy and wanted to lie down. She
had no burning pain in the stomach, in
fact no decided symptoms or pains, only
a desire to vomit. "To what did you at
tribute your illness?" asked Mr. Knight.
Objection was made to the question, but
not sustained, and the witness replied
that she had not thought about it. She
took no medicine. Her mother had told
Dr. Bishop that she (the mother) had
eaten heartily of corn fritters. She did
not know if he had asked whether they
were made from canned corn; neither did
she know of her own knowledge whether
it was canned. Drs. Bishop and Davis
had consulted over the cases In the house,
but she did not hear any discussion as
to arsenic until after her relatives had
died
The usual hour for adjournment for
luncheon had by this time arrived, and
Judge Cook asked the jurors Jf they
would be willing to extend their sessions
a half hour both morning and afternoon.
One juror opposed the extension of the
afternoon session, but it was finally
agreed to continue a half hour longer
each morning.
Miss Josephine Bateman was called. She
testified that she was passing the Pen
nlngton house and was called in and of
fered some of the candy which had just
arrived. Mrs. Dunning showed her the
box, which she said she thought came
from some friend in San Francisco. The
witness identified the wrapper and the
box shown her. She took but one piece of
candy and picked out a similar piece from
the box. It was a piece of cream choco
late with a pecan nut on it. After placing
it in her mouth she found three hard
lumps In it; took them from her mouth
and threw them on the street. She also
found a foreign substance on her gum,
and removed it. The next day the gum
was ulcerated, as were also her lips. She
felt ill that day and also the next day.
After throwing away the lumps she ate
the candy.
In her examination she adroitly dodged
a question which would have disclosed
her age. In doing so she said she was
born in Dover. Attorney Knight got at
the matter of age delicately by asking
how long she had been in Dover, and the
witness answered, "Since 1857." In answer
to Mr. Knight, she told of being called
into the Pennington house. There was a
discussion as to the writing on the pack
age, but Mrs. Dunning was not suspicious
as to the contents of the box. Witness
testified that she was surprised that a
friend would send a note written on such
a piece of paper. She thought either a
card would be used or else a whole sheet.
Witness, who is a teacher, is familiar
with chemistry, and has seen arsenic
since. She had learned what powdered
and what crystallized arsenic is. She said
she spat it out because it was of a gritty
nature and about the size of a pea. She
thought it was some imperfection in the
candy. It looked like rock salt. It was
firm and solid and would not dissolve.
The witness was excused and recess de
clared.
The Afternoon Session.
Upon rollcall at the opening- of the aft
ernoon session Jurors Heyman and Ken
nedy did not answer to their names. Mr.
Kennedy appeared shortly, but the court
room clock ticked off several minutes be
fore Mr. Heyman appeared. Judge Cook
watched the door with a look that boded
no good for the delinquent juror. He
finally appeared and before he could take
his seat the Judge stopped him. In sim
ple but sarcastic words he told him he
would have to set his watch by the court
room clock. He had been late at both
sessions of the court. If it occurred
again, the Judge eaid, he would order the
jury Into the custody of the Sheriff, who
keeps his watch right.
Kthel Jane Millington was the first wit
ness to take the stand. She resided near
the Penningtons and called on them the
evening the candy was received by Mrs.
Dunning. She took one piece of candy.
The witness Identified the box and the
candies as the ones she had seen In Do
ver that night in August. She was taken
111 the next day with nausea and could,
not get up. She identified the note and
the handkerchief as well as the wrapper
when shown them, yesterday. Turned
over to the tender mercies of Mr. Knight
she said in answer to questions that shÂ«
remembered looking at the stamps In
order to find out where the package came
from. The members of the family had
discussed It before she arrived on the
scene and they asked her if she could
make out the postmark. The matter was
discussed at length.
Miss Millington was accompanied on
her visit to the Pennington residence by
Ethel Clark. They took but one candy
each and after eating them spent the
evening at the house.
She telt no ill effects from the candy
that night, but the next day she was con
fined to her bed. She was dull and lan
guid, but there were no symptoms of
burning. On Thursday she was able to
leave her bed and had felt no- ill effects
from the poison after that. With this
explanation the witness was excused.
J. D. Deane, husband of one of the
dead women, was called next. He testi
fied that the fish served at the table the
night his wife was poisoned was fresh
and not canned and that the corn was
also fresh, having been picked from the
garden of the house that day. He was
not at home when the candy arrived and
he experienced no ill effects after taking
his supper. He returned home about 9
o'clock and found the members of his
family playing "parchesi." a game like
checkers. He retired and during the night
his wife was taken ill. She went from
one attack into another, each apparent
ly more severe than its predecessor. The
attacks continued all Wednesday night,
growing less on Thursday, when they
gradually ceased. Mrs. Deane remained
conscious, but took no interest in pass
ing events. She complained of pain and
of a terrible burning inside. She asked
to be fanned, as she was burning up with
the fire that seemed to be within her.
She continued this way until she died
Thursday afternoon.
The witness testified that his wife'i face

Senator Morgan Speaks in Favor of Immediate Action!

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. Hepburn
of lowa introduced a bill authorizing the President to ac
quire by purchase from the States of Costa Rica and Nica
ragua full ownership, jurisdiction and sovereignty of such
land as may be desirable and necessary to construct and
defend a ship canal. The President is also directed to con
struct such canal, and the bill appropriates $140,000,000
to complete It.
WASHINGTON, Doc. 12.â Discussion
of two questions, each of importance
and interest at this session, was be
gun by the Senate at Us session to-day.
Territorial expansion and the construc
tion of the Nicaragua canal occupied
the attention of the body during the
greater part of the afternoon.
As soon as the routine morning busi
ness had been disposed of. Vest (D.) of
Missouri called up his resolution of
fered last week declaring It to be un
constitutional for this Government to
acquire foreign territory except for
coaling stations or some like purpose,
unless its intention was to confer
statehood upon the territory and citi
zenship upon its inhabitants. Vest de
clared that it was a basic principle of
this Government that "the powers of
the Government were derived from the
consent of the governed," and main
tained that the Federal Government
had no authority, either in morals or
ln the constitution, to go beyond that
principle. He held that the principle
had been sustained by the Supreme
Court in various decisions, and that no
public man of prominence or recog
nized tribunal had ever been reckless
enough to controvert it.
Morgan opened the debate on the ca
nal bill with a three hours' appeal for
action at this session. The whole
country, he said, would be disappoint
ed if Congress did not act. He was
willing to take any measure which
â¢would result in the building of the ca
nal. In the course of his remarks he
agreed to accept an amendment spe
cifically excepting the canal from neu
trality with regard to any country with
which the United States might be at
war.
Hoar and Hale presented resolution?
from citizens of their States remonstrat
ing against the extension of sovereignty
over the Philippine Islands and against
the acquisition of foreign territory with
out the consent of the people of sucn ter
ritory. The resolutions were referred to
tlÂ»e Committee on Foreign Relations.
ivttigrew introduced a bill aurhorizing
M A. Bartlett to raise the oattloship
Mane and transport it to the Dniteu
States.
Hoar introduced the following resolu
tion:
That the Committee on Military Affairs be
Instructed to inquire and report aÂ« soon as
may be whether some policy may .not be es
tablished by law by which soldiers In the
rejruhir army, who have families or parents de
pending on them for support, or whose educa
tion or opportunities for business will be seri
ously interfered with by longer continuance In
the military service, and who enlisted for the
â war, or under assurances that they would be
held only while the war lasted, may be prompt
ly discharged and their places, so far as neces
sary, be filled by new recruits.
Vest of Missouri then called up his reso
lution, offered last wer-k. declaring that
the f-onstitution confers no power on the
Federal Government to acquire territory
to be held and governed permanently as
colonies, and addressed the Senate
thereon. He did not propose, he said, to
do anything that would necessitate a
secret session, as he had no intention to
discuss any treaty now pending, or which
was to be proposed hereafter, but it
seemed to him peculiarly appropriate to
discuss the powers of the United States
Government under the constitution.
Vest thought it was the purpose of the
expansionists to adopt the European pol
icy of colonization, notwithstanding that
tho prlnicples of - thls Government were
the granting of citizenship to all within
the Jurisdiction of the Government, except
alone the Indians. In the act of cession
of the territory of Louisiana from
France to the United States is found a
provision that the Inhabitants, as soon ok
possible, shall be mad<> citizens of the
United States and the territory of Louisi
ana be made a State of the Union. So it
was. declared Vest, when Oregon was
taken from Great Britain and Alaska
from Russia.
"When, where, how," he asked, "have
we surendored the great idea that this Is
a confederation of States? I cannot ccn
ceive it to be possible to point out r.ny
other form of government under the con
stitution."
Vest maintained that the overwhelming
argument of the expansionists was that
the constitution applies alone to the

States of the Union. In favor of what
he termed "this monstrous proposition,"
he said the expanse. .ists quoted Daniel
i \\ ebster, for whose opinions he,- himself,
had the highest respect. The argument of
\\ ebster referred to had been made in a
debate with John C. Calhoun when slav
ery was a dominant Issue. Calhoun had
maintained that inasmuch as slavery was
recognized by the Federal constitution its
extension into the territories acquired by
the Union was constitutional. Then it was
that Webster had declared that the con
stitution applied to the States alone.
"To say," declared Vest, "that citizens
of a Territory are excluded from the -priv
ilege guaranteed by the bid of rights and
are .merely the subjects of the arbitrary
will' of Congress is a monstrous proposi
tion; but -fortunately the Supreme Court
had. determined that question in many
cases."
"I do not deny," continued Vest, "the
power of the Federal Government , to ac
quire territory, but I do deny its power
to acquire territory peopled with mil
lions without their consent and with no
intention of conferring upon them citi
zenship. I may be answered that the
point is not good; that it may be evaded
by the taking- in of vast tracts of lands
I peopled with barbarians to be held merely
for commercial advantages. When the
Congress of the United States shall be
come so degraded as this it is only a
question of time until the end shall
come."
Platt of Connecticut in expressing the
nope that Vest would not ask for imme
diate action upon his resolution, said he
desired to offer some remarks upon it,
but was not prepared to-day to do so.
He aid not, he said, acquiesce in the law
" , stated by the Missouri Senator. He
believed that the power to acquire terri
tory was inherent in the nation and
was not subject to limitation. In the re

trict of Columbia business. After dis
posing of several district bills,- Payne
(R.), of New York, called up . a bill to
amend the laws relating to the protection
of American seamen. He explained that
it would do away with some of the evils
of the allotment system, under which sea
men have been defrauded of their earn
ings; the punishment of sailors by im
prisonment is greatly lessened. Masters
are required to ship with a full comple
ment of men; the food which the men are
to ro<iivf is stated and punishment by
flogging is abolished.
There was some discussion of the bill
and amendment's were offered by Handy
(D.), of Delaware.
At 4:50 p. m. it was suggested that no
quorum was present and on motion of
Payne the House adjourned.
GENERAL MILES BEFORE
THE MILITARY COMMITTEE
Tells of the Necessity of Increasing
the Regular Army to One Hun
dred Thousand Men.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. â Mafor-Gen
eral Miles appeared to-day before the
House Committee on Military Affairs for
a hearing relative to the proposed reor
ganization and increase in the army. At
the outset General Miles addressed kim
self to the general need of increasing the
army. It was necessary now to consider
both our military requirements at home
and those of our new colonial dependen
cies abroad, and also the rapidly increas
ing demands made by our scacoast forti
fications.
The war with Spain has shown pretty
clearly how many men would be needed,
General Miles said. The war had requir
ed 52.000 men for actual field operations at
various points. Of these 22,000 men went
to Manila, 20.000 to Cuba and 10,000 to
Porto Rico. These were men actually ln
the presence of the hostile enemy. Since
then there had been rt>-enforcements for
| garrison and other purposes. At the same
I time, the general pointed out that the
i necessities at home must not be over
! looked. The entire frontier had be^n
j stripped of troops during the late war.
â  and complaints were coming in that tho
i lives, families and property of settlers in
i the West had been jeopardized by this
i condition. In particular .there were fears
1 of an outbreak in the Sioux country be
cause of the absence of troops. It was
not desirable, therefore, to withdraw our
; forces from the frontier so as 10 leave
thorn defenseless or to invite disorder.
These considerations, said Gt-neral
' Miles, had led him to recommend a
standard of one soldier for each 1000 of
population at home, with the native
troops on a basis of two soldiers for eve
ry imX) of native population.
General Miles said that probably 10.000
men would be sufficient for Cuba in the
! near future. The officers in the Phillp
â  pines estimated that they would require
: 25,000 men, possibly more. Altogether 40,
000 men were needed abroad and 35,000 at
: home.
At the afternoon session General Scho
1 field, who preceded General Miles in com
j mand of the army, devoted his chief at-
I tention to the friction inevitably arising
I between the Secretary of War and the
commanding general under the present
system. This had occurred under the
â¢command of General Scott, who removed
| his headquarters to New York to avoid
j differences arising with the War Depart
! ment. It occurred also during the cotn
! mand of General Sherman, who went to
St. Louis to avoid friction. The trouble
i arose out of the system which gave the
j head of army the name of commanding
! general, when in fact he had little or no
I authority or influence as commanding
! general. Whether he doe^ anything de
| pends largely on his personal relations
with the Secretary of War. If these re
lations are not close then the Secretary
of War gets to Ignoring the so-called
commanding general. Ih that event the
adjutant general became a more impor
tant official than the commanding gen
eral. General Schofield urged tbat one of.
i the most essential features of army reor
ganization was to give the President ab
solute power to select his own command
ing officer. Instead of creating the per
manent grade of lieutenant general he fa
vored giving the President authority to'
select at any time a lieutenant general,
the officer occupying that position retir
ing to his former grade. The title also
should be that of general-ln-chief instead
of commanding general, as that would
better express the idea that the head of
the army was the executive officer for the
President and Secretary of War.

Expansion Policy Means Denial to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 12.â At the
meeting of the Federation of Trade to
day President Gompers in the coursa of
his address stated the objections of the
Federation to the policy of Imperialism
and expansion, as follows:
We cannot annex the Philippines with
out a large increase in our standing
army. A large standing army is repug
nant to Republican institutions and a
menace to the liberty of our own people.
Jf we annex the Philippines we shall
have to conquer the Philippines by the
force of arms and thereby deny to them
what we cluim for ourselves â the right of
self -government.
We shall surrender thfÂ» present safe and
independent position by which we are
guaranteed the tranquillity and the fruits
of peace, and force ourselves into Euro
pean and' Asiatic entanglements, imply
ing war and the preparation for war.
We shall seek to conquer by the force
of arms, instead of by bur own industry,
commerce and superior mentality and
civilization.
We shall be compelled to open the gates
and admit the Chinese. Malays and slave
laborers who may come from "our new
possessions." since the constitution of the
United States forbids the Interdiction of
the free entry of men and their products
between our States and Territories.
The policy of Imperialism is a declara
tion that self-government has failed and
that tho people cannot be trusted; that
the dollar is of more consequence than
man and plutocracy and militarism
nobler than humanity.
The attempt to divert the attention of
our people from the ills from which we
suffer at home to foreign questions will
fail.
It has always been the hewers of wood
and the carriers of water, the wealth
producers, whose mission it has been not
only to- struggle for freedom but to be
ever vigilant to maintain the liberty or
freedom achieved; and it behooves the
representatives of the grand army of la
bor, ln convention assembled, to give vent
to the alarm we feel from the danger
threatening us and our entire people and
to enter our solemn and emphatic protest
against what we already feel â that with
the success of the policy of imperialism
the dependence of our republic will have
already set in.
Mr. Gompers reported that 880 local
unions were chartered during the year
and there are now affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor 67 na
tional and international unions, with
10,500 local unions attached; 10 State
federations; 82 city central labor unions
and trade assemblies; 315 local trade
unions, having no nationals, and 109
federal unions.
On the subject of an eight-hour work
day Mr. Gompers says:
Should industrial conditions warrant It
is suggested that every effort be made'by
the incoming officers in co-operation with
the trade union movement of the country
to inaugurate a general agitation and
movement for the more universal intro
duction of the eight-hour or shorter work
day.
Although there seems to be no doubt
that Mr. Gompers will be re-elected, a
fkrht will be made upon him by a small
faction headed by Isaac Cowen and
Max Hays of Cleveland.
"I would fight against GomDers,"
said Cowen, in an interview to-day,
"if it were the last thing I had to do
on earth. Gompers is entirely too con
servative and slow. We have not se
lected a candidate yet, but shall do so.
He will be a representative of uD-to
date socialism."

HOT AN ADVOCATE
OF SINGLE TAX

NEVER FAVORED THE ISM
RTTMOJEt CIRCULATED FOR PO
LITICAL EFFECT.
Enemies Go to the Extent of Declar
ing Him a Member of a Los
Angeles Single Tax
Club.
Special Diapatoh to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12.â Enemies of
Senator Robert N. Bulla have been cir
culating a story to the effect that he
is an advocate of the single tax. This
is not true. Senator Bulla's views on
the subject are expressed in the follow
ing interview which he gives |P tne
press:
I have never identified myself with the
Bingle-tax movement in any wayâ have
never favored it and do not favor it now.
I did introduce a resolution leaving to
the Legislature the power to say what
property should be taxed, on the theory
that the constitution should not be made
up, of details, but should declare only
fundamental principles, not merely on the
question of taxation, but on all other mat
ters. The constitution should not be a
statute. .
Knowing from my experience that arti
cle IX of the constitution, dealing with
the subject of taxation and taxable prop
erty has been amended more frequently
tha"n any other, 1 introduced the resolu
tion referred to in order to avoid this
constant alteration on that point.
Whether or not the single taxers have
considered that resolution in their favor,
I did not stop to ask. I thought it right
to introduce it and did not consult any
single taxers as to what they thought
about it. In my work in the Legislature
I have never stopped to consider what
any special interest thought of the va
rious measures I favored or opposed. The
only question I asked myself was as to
their effect on the people generally. If
I believed it beneficial that has been
enough to urge my favoring any bill.
As to the proposed constitutional
amendment allowing counties to frame
their own government, which it was
charged would have been "an opening
wedge" for the single tax, I opposed that
amendment openly during the campaign
recently closed and made numerous
speeches against it. I undertsand it was
defeated.
The rumor started to the effect that
I was one of the foremost members of
the Los Angeles County Single Tax Club
was promptly denied and the denial was
published in the papers.
I know of no reason why the charge was
made, unless because I was at one time
invited to address a Single Tax Club here
upon the subject of proposed constitu
tional amendments looking to the correc
tion of some of the present objectionable
features of our revenue laws. I was not
able to be present at that time and did
not deliver the address, but, at the request
of one of the members of the club, sent
a letter referring very briefly to some of
the evils of our assessment and taxation
laws, and also giving a brief synopsis of
some of the acts which have been passed
by the Legislature in an effort to remedy
them; also a summary of the resolutions
for constitutional amendments which have
been introduced into the Legislature with
the object of correcting the very evident
evils which exist in this department of
our laws.

Affair.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. 12.â 1n the Chamber of
Deputies to-day M. Grousett, Radical
Socialist, interpellated the Government
on the indiscretion of the general staff
in the Dreyfus affair. He read extracts
from newspaper articles which are
alleged to have emanated from
members of the general staff, which
caused a violent uproar, during which
the Deputies rose and rushed at one
another and engaged in a series of fist
fights.
M. Grousett continued his remarks in
the middle of this tumult and recalled
an article in the Intransigeant refer
ring to letters from Emperor William
and an interview between Count yon
Munster, German Embassador at Paris,
and Casimir-Perier, the former Presi
dent of the republic. Count de Mun,
the Conservative leader, here interrupt
ed the speaker and said be desired that
the House be consulted as to whether
the discussion should be allowed to
continue.
The Premier, M. Dnpuy, said that as
the head ol the Government he pro
tested with the utmost enersry against
the language of the speaker who, he
added, had not measured its possible
effect. (Applause.)
M. de Roulde, Revisionist, shouted:
"Come off the tribune." This caused a
redoublement of the uproar.
When semi-quiet was restored M.
Grousett continued speaking. He said
the center of resistance to the revision
of the Dreyfus case was not from the
Ministry of War. It was elsewhere.
As to the secret documents in the case,
he pointed out that they had been rid
iculed by Emperor William himself.
(Loud protests).
M. de Schanel, Republican, invited
the speaker not to mix foreign sover
eigns in the debate any more than he
would mix the President of the republic
in it.
M. Grousett, continuing, spoke of the
articles in the newspapers, in *.iich it ;
was hinted that Russia and the Czar â 
were mixed up in the Dreyfus affair, :
and he also alluded to the recent semi- ;
official note relative to the Minister of !
Foreign Affairs, M. Delcasse, being
obliged to explain certain statements :
to the German Embassador relative to
the latter's daughter. (Uproar and
hbotÃ.) Austria, M. Grousett said, was
next mixed up in the affair.
The speaker said he pointed out these
matters in order to show that a press
campaign had been inaugurated by cer- i
tain interested persons to prevent the
discovery of the truth.
M. Grousett concluded with demand
ing if the Government was disposed to
permit the center of resistance to the
law to pass from the Ministry of War
to the general staff of the military
government of Paris, if it would any
longer tolerate this attitude of the ring
leaders and if it would govern for the
republic or for the Jesuits. (Applause
from the extreme left and violent pro
tests elsewhere.)
The Minister of War, M. de Frey
clnet, repudiated M. Grousett's allega
tions. He said that if there had been
some indiscretions it was unjust and
imprudent to attack the whole army;
unjust because the army was excellent,
devoted to its duty and incapable of
the acts charged; imprudent because it
was liable to lead to a disorganization
of the military institutions. The Min
ister of War concluded with vigorously
protesting against the accusation
brought against the general staff and
the military government of Paris of
resisting the law.
M. Dupuy asked the Chamber to close
the discussion and adopt the order of
the day, which was done by a vote of
463 to 78. The House then adjourned.
As one of the results of the insults
exchanged during the debate in the
Chamber to-day Antide Boyer. Radical
Socialist, has sent his seconds to M.
de Roulede, Revisionist, and to M.
Gauthler (de Clagay), Revisionist, who
characterized M. Boyer as a "white
washed Panamaist."
The city Is greatly excited to-night
and the troops are under arms. Colonel
Plsquart's release is still delayed owing
to the Judicial quibbles between the
civil and military authorities. Max
Pegis, the Mayor of Algiers, who was
suspended by the prefect for a month
on account of the rabid anti-Semite
speech he made attacking the G#vprnor
General, has resfgnfd. Count Esterhazy
has written to M. Mazeau, president of
the Court of Cassation, declaring his
readiness, If granted a safe conduct, to
appear before the court to be confront
ed with all the witnesses and to defend
his own "honor" and that of the late
Colonel Henry.
DEPUTIES HEAD AN
ANTIDREYFUS RISING
PARIS, Dec. 12.â M. Mlllevoye and
the Comte de Ramel, both members of
the Chamber of Deputies, headed an
anti-Dreyfus demonstration this after
noon. They marched to the Cherche
Midi Prison, where Colonel Plcquart Is
confined, but were stopped by a cordon
of police and asked to retire. There
upon M. Millevoye made a speech, dur
ing which he said they "did not desire
a conflict with these brave fellows,"
pointing to the police, adding that they
had achieved- their object in being able
to shout "Spit upon Picquart!" who
could hear them from the window of his
prison.
The crowd then marched to the Ho
tel dcs Invalides. the official residence
of General Zurlinden, the Military Gov
ernor of Paris, cheering for the army
and chanting monotonously. "Spit upon
Picquart!" it meeting a lieutenant of
cuirassiers on their way, who said:
"I thank you In the name of the
army."
The speech brought forth renewed
cheers from the demonstrators.
The doors of General Zurllnden's
residence were closed, but the crowd
gathered outside, cheering for the
army, and M. Millevoye narangued his
followers, denouncing the "infamous
monsters of the Court of Cassation,"
ending with calling for che*rÂ« for the
"valiant General Zurlinden, who com
mands the army," and "for the tri
color, flying over the Invalides."
The Prefect of Algiers has suspended
the Mayc.-r of Algiers for a mbnth on
account of a speech made by the May
or, who is a rabid anti-Semite, attack
ing the Governor General. The Minister
of" the Interior has increased the sus
pension to three months. This is meant
as a warning to the Algerian anti-
Semites, whose recent violence and
threats have been causing panic
among the Jews in Algeria, which has
demoralized business.

There are probably several reasons for
this. One is, that they lived more in the
open air, and another, and probably the
most influential of all, is that they were
less prudish than the women of to-day. r
They were not ashamed to know something
of their own physical make-up. They were
not too nice to take care of their health in
a womanly way. Women now-a-days suf-
fer untold tortures in silence, because of
. weakness and disease of the distinctly
feminine organism, rather than consult a
physician, or even talk upon the subject to
their. own husbands. They imagine that
troubles of this description can only be

FAIL TO EXTEND
THE FRANCHISE
Fifty=Year Extension Referred to
Street Railway Committee
and Practically Killed.
Owing to the Extraordinary Precautions of the
Police There Were No Disturbances and
No Lynching Attempted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 12.â Thanks to the
pood sense of the citizens of Chicaco
and the superb work of the Police De
partment, the City Hall was not sacked
to-night nor were any Aldermen or
owners of street railway shares hanged
to lamp posts.
The traction ordinance came ud in
the Common Council, a test vote was
taken, which proved its friends had not
the strength to pass nor its enemies to
kill it, and a? a compromise it now re
popes in a pigeonhole of the street rail
way committee, to which it was re
ferred after being taken from the spe
cial committee, which has had It since
Introduction a week ago to-night.
Both sides claim a victory. Neither
will admit defeat. To layman the
Councils action simply means the
agonizing agitation will be continued
another week at least. During the day
the city was generally flooded with pos
ter circulars in three-inch black type,
calling on all good citizens to gather
at the City Hall to-night to influence
Aldermen to vote right. The traction
people, when apprised, appealed to the
police to stop the distribution of the
Incendiary handbill. and charged
Mayor Harrison and friends with being
responsible for its publication. The
distribution was stopped, but no ar
rests "f distributors were made, as the
ordinance governing the dissemination
of that claps of matter was not violat
ed, the circular being very carefully
worded.
As the time for calling the Council to
order drew near there were evidences
of considerable feverishness in the
downtown district, but Chief of Police
Kipley assured all who questioned him
that there would be no trouble. All the
reserves were massed within easy call
ing distance of the City Hall, and fully
n (Thousand plain-clothes men were on
duty within a radius of a few blocks.
Marching clubs were interdicted from
escorting Aldermen to the Council
chamber or approaching in a body any
n-arer than Twelfth street on the
BOUth and the river on the north and
w^st. Thousands of curious peopje at
tempted to gather in the vicinity of the
city Hall, but none were permitted to
stand for a moment, and in that wav
dangerous congestions were avoided.
No one was admitted to the City Hall
without a pass, and even passes were
disregarded when floor space and gal
leries of the room in which the meet
ing place was held were filled. Fur
ther police precautions consisted in sta
tioning guards in citizens' clothes at
various newspaper offices, at the homes
Of AMormen recognized as leaders of
both factions, and at the homes of
street car directors.
There were surprising developments
at the Council meeting to-night, one of
which was that the Mayor found he
had thirty-eight votes among the
Aldermen he could count upon. The
second was the taking of the fifty-year
franchise ordinance out of the hands
pf the special Council committee to
which it was referred on Monday night
last and its reference to the Committee
on Railroads of the Council. This com
mittee, with the exception of one mem
ber, is favorable to the passage of any
thing the street railway companies may
ask. but the Mayor having found out
that he is so strong does not care where
the ordinance goes, as he will be able
to prevent its passage over his veto.
It was not thought at first that any
move in regard to the ordinance would
be made to-night, and some surprise
was occasioned when Alderman Walsh
made a motion to reconsider the vote
of last Monday night when the ordi
nance was referred to a joint commit
tee Alderman Cullerton, a pronounced
i friend of the ordinance, moved to table
the resolution, but was defeated by *
vote of 87 ayes to 36 nays, to the great
astonishment of the Council and oeo
ple in the galleries, and on motion of
Alderman Walsh it was carried by a
vote et 36 to 27.
Alderman Walsh then came back
â with a motion to place the ordinance
on file, which would have killed it al
together, but Alderman Cullerton called
attention to the rule which provided
that ordinances of this description
should gÂ° to the committee on rail-
Mayor Harrison then said Alderman
Cullerton was right, and that he had
made a mistake in allowing it to be
Bent to joint committee, and it was
therefore referred to the committee on
railroads In order to thoroughly test
me temper of the Council Alderman
Maltby, leader of th<- minority, offered
the following resolution, and moved
the rules be suspended to permit of its
passage:
-That pending the repeal of the Al
len law, demanded by State and local
organizations of all parties and de
,] by th<- people at the polls last
November, any attempt to extend
Btreetcar franchises in Chicago would
contffcry to public policy and the
fundamental principles of popular gov
ernment." . __
The vote on this was 38 ayes and 20
but a two-thirds vote ..ring nec
py it was lost. However, jt was a
great victory for the Mayor, as' it dem
onstrated that thirty-six members of
the Council would stand by him.
The vote shows that the street rail
fe(\ay companies are defeated beyond
' fioubt. and that there will be absolutely
no legislation on the franchise ordi
nances by the Council until the Allen
few is repealed. This victory was en
tirely unexpected by both the Mayor
and Council majority, and the latter
took it very hard indeed.
kin the course of the debate on the
Idaltby resolution Alderman Melnernev.
Â»f the Twenty-ninth Ward, one of the
'< HOEt prominent upholders of the fifty
year franchise, referring to threats of
violence against him and others, turned
to the gallery and shouted: "If any
thing is done to me I won't go alone.
I'll take six others with me." making
a motion toward his hip pocket where
a revolver is usually carried.
"You'll make a pretty corpse." re
plied a man in the gallery.
â¢Yes," was the heated Alderman's
retort, "I'll make a handsomer corpse
than you ever will."
"You bet," was the gallery man's re
ply, "and sooner."
The laugh being on the Alderman, he
sat down. The sentiment among the
Alderman recognized as friends of the
street railroads now is that the fifty
year ordinance is too dead to keep it
above ground and they all unite in
saying they do not know what will be
done, except possibly a new ordinance
may be substituted for the old which
will grant a shorter extension and
give the city larger compensation.
Three leading Aldermen of the ma
jority are Cullerton. Powers and Mc-
Ineriiey. After the Council meeting
was ended Alderman Mclnerney said:
"We are skinned. It's all up with that
ordinance. I don't know what will be
done, but I don't belieye any maji
would have voted for the fifty-year
franchise."
Alderman Powers said: "I was not
iln favor of the fifty-year franchise.
| Some other ordinance will come in
i that will give the railways a fair show
1 and do the right thing by the city."
f Alderman Cullerton said: "Of course
1 there will be an ordinance passed, but
j it will not be for fifty years. What we
'' want is the city's rights protected, and
WÂ£ have been for that all along."
Mr. Yerkes said to-night that he
would continue to try to get the or
dinance through the Council.
Mayor Harrison would only say:
"You saw and heard what was done.
That ordinance is dead and cannot be
! resurrected. There will be no street
i car legislation in Chicago under the Al
| len law."
In the meantime both sides are lining
up to continue the battle, and forty
mass-meetings will be held to-morrow
by the opposition to extension.
Chief Kipley called The Call corre
spondent's attention to the prophecy
made Saturday that there would be no
trouble, but wouldn't deny that it was
due to the greatest activity of the po
lice department since the Pullman
strike.

LOSS OF SCHOONER HELENE
STRIKES A REEF OFF SANTA
CRUZ ISLAND.
Crew of Six Gains the Shore by
Swimming, After a Night Spent
on a Rock Washed by
the Breakers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Dec. 12. â The j
schooner Santa Rosa came into port
last night bringing six shipwrecked ,
men from the schooner Helene. These j
men tell a thrilling tale of their experi
ence after having been shipwrecked off
Santa Cruz Island on Thursday even- j
ing.
While en the east side of Santa Cruz
they encountered a southeaster and a
very heavy sea. They immediately ;
made for the west end of the island, i
which is protected from a southeast
wind. They anchored off Forney's ;
Cove, at the extreme end of the island,
and had lain there three or four hours !
when a northeaster began blowing j
down the channel between Santa Rosa i
and Santa Cruz islands. Three anchors
were immediately thrown out, but they j
were powerless against the heavy wind.
It was useless for the crew to attempt
to pull up anchor and make to sea.
The vessel dragged her anchors, and
at about midnight struck a low reef, j
which forms one side of Forney's Cove,
with terrific farce, knocking a large ;
hole in her bottom. The vessel turned i
over on her side, and what provisions
were not washed off her deck by the !
waves which swept over her were de
stroyed by the water.
The six men had great difficulty in !
saving themselves from being swept
off the rigging. The small skiff was
unfastened, but as soon as put into the 1
water was capsized. Its oars were thus j
lost. Finally the crew succeeded In
righting it, and fastened one end of a j
(Reproduced Frcm a Chicago Paper â U^ot the Inter Ocean.)
rope to the boat and the other end to j
the wrecked Helene. They all got in
and set the skiff adrift, hoping it would
be blown to a small rock about 109
yards from the wreck. This hope was
lualized.
All night long they remained on the
rock in a howling wind, soaked to the
skin, and the waves washing complete
ly over them every few minutes. Late
the next day the tide had lowered suf
ficiently for them to wade a considera
ble distance an the reef, and by swim
ming a few hundred yards they reached
the mainland. They found a deserted
Chinese cabin, which contained provi
sions. Here they remained another
twenty-four hours, when the schooner
Santa Rosa happened to see their sig
nal of distress. When the southeaster
came up the Santa Rosa had been
forced out of Santa Barbara harbor
and held in the channel two or three
days, seeking a safe harbor. She was
within three or four miles of the west
end when Captain Burtis saw the sig
nal of distress. The wind was blowing
a terrific gale at the time, and it was
with great risk that an anchorage was
made and the men rescued. When
fr.-und they were in a sorry conditipn,
all being chilled through and through.
Rcmon Vasquez, an old sea captain,
was in command of the Helene. He was
in a serious condition when picked up.
He could neither move a muscle nor
make a sound. At a late hour to-day
the attending physician said that he
could not live many hours. The other
five men. although badly bruised and
exhausted, are not in a s t erious condi
tion.
The men on the vessel were: Ramon
Vasquez, Joseph Leva, Colais Vas
quez. Joe Olivas, Joe Cota and Charles
Thrift.
The Helene was built in this city at
a cost of $5000, but was never consider
ed a seaworthy vessel. She w4is four
years old, and was registered at fif
teen tons. She was the property of Ed
wards & Co., local hardware men. The
Helene had been catching seals alive
for Rodgers Bros, of this city, who
trained them and sold them to East
erners. ______________

AN IMPORTANT RULING BY THE

The California Drydock Company's
Title Found to Be Worthless
and So Regarded by Fed
eral Authorities.
( Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 12.â Mr. Binger
Hermann, Commissioner of the General
Land Office, in a decision rendered to
day holds that Misson Island, known also
as Misson Rook, and a small island lo
cated just southeast thereof in San Fran
cisco bay, is a part of the public domain,
and in accordance therewith President
McKinley in a fewVlays will issue an ex
ecutive order reserving both islands as
a coaling station for the use of the navy.
A temporary order withdrawing these
islands has been issued. The action of
the commissioners transfers the islands
from private to public control. The issue
involved Is regarded by Commissioner
Hermann and other officials as of extreme
importance. It will give to the navy what
it has long desired to establish and main
tain. Mission Island contains about four
teen one-hundredths of an acre, and is in
cluded within and surrounded by a tract
of submerged or tide lands containing
14.35 acres claimed by the California Dry
dock Company through mesne convey
ances from the State. The rock, or island
itself, is situated in the bay 3500 feet from
its west shore, and within the corporate
limits of the city of San Francisco.
Leading up to his decision Commission
er Hermann says: "This office has never
recognized the island as submerged and
it does not appear that it has been so con
sidered by the people of the city. Although
the State has apparently attempted to
convey I am unable to t!nd under what
law it can claim title. The decision hing
ed on whether an approved plat of the
exterior limits of the city has been filed
in the General Land Office, and exhaus
tive search has failed to find any trace
of it."
The decision goes into minute details
sustaining its action as against the claims
of the city and the drydoek people.

LONDON, Dec. 13.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Daily Mall summarizes
this morning an interview he had with
United States Senator Cushman K. Da
vis of the Peace Commission, who advo
cates a triple alliance between the United
States, Great Britain and Japan. The
correspondent says:
Mr. Davis declared that American and
British interests in the Far East run quite
parallel and that, therefore, the two
powers should act jointly.
"I am not appealing to sentiment," he
said, "though blood is thicker than water,
and this argument should not be ignored.
My theory in favor of co-operation is
borne out by the coldest logic. I favor a
treaty of alliance, Including the United
States, Great Britain and Japan, for the
protection of all their interests north of
the equator. The rest of the world would
have a wholesome fear, synonomous of
respect for us."

He proceeded to argue that Russia,
Germany and France had secured the
great bulk of the commercial benefits In
China to the exclusion of both the Uni

that such a dreibund could have nothing

to preserve the peace.
"There are still 500 years of vigorous
fight in England." said Mr. Davis, "which
shows no sign of decrepitude, while strong
as America is, it will take several hun
dred years to develop her promise and

LAND AT HAVANA
HAVANA, Dec. 12.â The Two Hundred
and Second New York Regiment began to
land at 6 o'clock this morning, and at 8
o'clock a column about 1000 strong
marched from the San Jose wharf to the
Christina railroad station. The troops
were led by Colonel Seyburn and Major
Abbott, the regimental band playing sim
ple marches. The color sergeants bore
the stars and stripes and the blue and
gold banner of the State of New York.
After some delay, two trains loaded
with troops pulled out of the depot. Some
of the troops belonging to this detach
ment are bound for the city of Pinar del
Rio, about 118 miles from here. The oth
ers will be stationed at Guanayajay and
Mariel. not far from here, in the province
of Pinar del Rio.
The First North Carolina Regiment,
which arrived here yesterday morning on
the Tnited States transport Roumanian,
disembarked this morning and marched
through the city with band and colors to
camp at Marianao. By the time the regrl
ment had reached the suburb of Cerro
many hundreds of men. women and chil
dren were following, all showing deep
emotion, the men embracing one another,
the women weeping from excessive pleas
ure, and the children shouting endearing
names as the North Carolinans marched
along.
The troops were amazed at the intensity
of feeling displayed. Several hundred Cu
bans followed the regiment all the way
to Marianao, a distance of seven miles.

NOW REQUIRED IN
THE PHILIPPINES
Army and Navy Men Believe a Blow
Should Be Struck and American
Rule Established.
Twenty-Five Thousand Men, With Modern Artillery,
Would Be Sufficient to Disband the
Filipino Army.

MANILA, Dec. 12.â 1 have made an
investigation of the Philippine problem
now before the United States, and the
consideration of which demands
prompt solution. According to my in
structions I have endeavored to ascer
tain not only the feelings of the Fili
pinos toward Americans, but also the
opinions of military and naval officers
here as to what regimen in their opin
ion ought to be established. In com
pany with several agents. l have visited
provinces, and have had exceptional
facilities for forming judgment as to
the wants of the people
We found the rebel forces, which are
well armed, and largely composed of
the lowest type of Filipinos, opposed to
American rule, and, indeed, to any
form of legitimate government. The
better class of the people in the insur
gent ranks, who have been forced to en
list, are discontented at the small pay
and short rations.
After a comprehensive glance over
the whole situation, I am convinced it
il impossible to recognize the native re
public.
Thousands of the peacefully disposed
among the Filipinos are disgusted and
request that Agninaldo be compelled
to withdraw his forces from the towns,
where they live by pillage.
In addition the natives of the prov
inces are made to sell their produce to
rebel officers at exceedingly low prices
and are heavily taxed into the bargain.
I am not at liberty to mention names,
but both in the military and naval
circles in the American force here it
is paid that a decisive blow oughi t<j
be struck, and American rule ought to
be established gradually and firmly
and mixed regiments of natives and
Americans Ottght to be formed in those
provinces whence the principal food
supply is derived. Twenty-five thou
sand men with modern artillery would
be sufficient to disband the rebel army,
after which opposition here and in dis
tant provinces* would be of small im
portance and easily dealt with. The
people want peace and honest rulers.
This Is admitted privately, though
there is but little use in talking to the
natives. It is the opinion here that
the United States should act with de
cision and determination.
Hollo is still closely bt-sieged, and the
Spanish artillery makes havoc in the
rebel ranks. I managed to pass
through the Spanish lines and spoke
with insurerent officers. Some favor

MOONSHINE STILL
NEAR SAN ANTONIO
Whisky Manufactured and Sold in
Kegs Lacking the Govern
ment Stamp.
SAX RAFAEL. Dec. 12.â 1t is known
to many townspeople that for several 1
months' larpe quantities of whisky have !
been shipped to this city in kegs minus
the Government stamp. The liquor al
ways came from a point north of this city. |
Careful investigation, it is alleged, has |
led to the discovery of a still near San |
Antonio, where moonshiners are supposed :
to have been plying their illicit occupa- .
tion for some time. It is probable that j
arrests will follow.
Several weeks ago William Robertson j
noticed several unstamped kegs, and in- :
quired on the streets as to the identity of ,
the consignees, but was unable to learn, j
as the liquor was carted away at night, j
William Eden, son of Coroner Eden, sus
pecting that the liquor came from Novato, ,
asked Constable Louis Devoto of that
town in regard to the matter to-day, and
was surprised at the response the ques
tion elicited.
"Devoto admitted to me, said Eden,
''that the whisky was made near San An- |
toniu by some men who claim to have I
come from the East. He said they had |
rented a small cabin on a ranch near S;m
Antonio and were manufacturing ex
cellent whisky out of grape skins, grape â¢
seeds and grape wine tendrils. He told
me that he had seen the apparatus used
in its manufacture and had tasted the !
article Itself, the price of which is 80 j
cents a gallon. I asked him why he had |
not arrested the men and he answerr-d
that the ranch on which they were ope
rating belonged to a friend of his and he
did not like to interfere.

PROPOSED GOVERNMENT
OF THE PHILIPPINES
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: There is reason to believe the
subject of the government of the Phil
ippines will be carefully considered at
to-morrow's meeting of the Cabinet.
The proclamation it is proposed to send
to General Otis for issuance has prac
tically been completed and will be laid
before the President, it is expected, by
Secretary Hay. The proclamation is
similar to that published by General
Wood when this Government first as
sumed control at Santiago de Cuba. It
will urge the inhabitants of the Philip
pines to return to peaceful pursuits and
will promise them local participation
in Philippine affairs, with the promise
of eventual self-government under the
jurisdiction of the United States.
The proclamation, it is expected, will
have a beneficial effect upon the insur
gents and will induce them to yield
to General Otis' wishes and disband.
General Otis cabled to the War Depart
ment several days ago that he was able
to cope with the situation, but sug
gested that additional regulars be sent
to him. Secretary Alger told me to
night that that message and all pre
vious dispatches from the military
commander failed to show that the
rebel forces were opposed to American
rule. He, as well as other members of
the Cabinet, are confident that when
the Filipinos understand the purpose of
the United States respecting them and
their islands they will be satisfied with
the character of the Government to be
given them.
So far as the formation of mixed
fegimenta of natives and Americans
is concerned the President would be
quite willing to form such regiments,
but he has no authority of law for do
ing so.
There is reason to believe the admin
istration will earnestly advocate the
passage of a law giving authority to
the President to enlist the natives of
the Philippines.

UNCLE SAM'S RIGHTS IN
THE SAMOAN GROUP
Will Not Be Overlooked. Particularly
in the Event of the Opening of
an Isthmian Canal.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.-The Govern
ment is not aware that any arrangement
has been made for the transfer of the title
of the Samoan Islands to Germany, and,
being one of the parties to the tripartite
agreement under which Samoa is now
governed, It is not conceivable that any
change can be made in the status without
the consent of the United States. The
European publication intimating that Ger
many had acquired sole rights in the Sa
moan group is recognized as a diplomatic
feeler, being another of the attempts
which have been made at intervals of
three months for the past two or three
years to ascertain how a change in the
established order as to Samoa would be re
ceived in the United States. The workings
of the tripartite agreement, it is frankly
acknowledged, have not been entirely- sat

ADMIRAL DEWEY'S HEALTH
IS BEING UNDERMINED
Hero of Manila Giving Way Under the Worry and High
Tension to Which He Has Been
Subjected.
CHICAGO, Dec. 12.â The Manila correspondent of the Inter Ocean
Is In a position to say that for physical reasons Admiral Dewey ought
to go home. It would be inexact to sayhe is sick, but to those who have
seen him frequently during his hard campaign here since May last it
Is evident the long strain is beginning to tell on him. The effect of
the worry and high nervous tension to which the admiral has been
subjected throughout the summer is becoming apparent. At the same
time the necessity for keeping him there is practically ended.
"When Admiral Dewey was summoned to return to the United
States a few months ago he informed the Government there was
still important work at Manila for him to do, and the orders for his
return were countermanded, the Washington authorities realizing he
was the best man to deal with any questions that might arise in the
Philippines.
As the situation develops, however, It becomes more and more
apparent that part of the work the navy has yet to do there will be
largely of a routine character, and Admiral Dewey, feeling that this
is so, is satisfied to go home. At the same time he dreads somewhat
the reception which the thousands of letters he has received assure
him awaits him on his return.
Throughout the fleet, as well as among Americans generally at
Manila, there is a strong feeling that the admiral Is entitled to take
the Olympia home by way of the Suez canal. It would undoubtedly
greatly please the admiral to receive an order Instructing him to
return to the United States by that route.
Without going so far as to say that it would seriously endanger
Admiral Dewey's health to ask him to remain till the treaty is rati
fied, it is quite true to say it would subject him to a great strain,
which would be liable, if not likely, to produce unhappy results.
REGULARS TO RELIEVE VOLUNTEERS AT MANILA.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.â 1t was said at the War Department to-day
that the regulars to relieve the volunteers at Manila would prob
ably leave about January 1. It is the purpose to send Bix regiments,
three of which will go via the Suez Canal, but the three others may be sent
via San Francisco. The transports used to carry the troops via the Suez
will be retained at the Pacific Station for future use. General Corbin
said to-day that the volunteers at Manila would, be Celleved in the order
in which they were assigned to duty there. This order was as folldws:
First California, First Oregon," First Colorado, Tenth Pennsylvania and
Utah Battery. There seems a fair prospect that California's soldiers will
be home within three months.
The War Department has begun in earnest the relief of the volunteer
troops now stationed at Manila by regulars. This afternoon Secretary Al
ger signed an order designating for this purpose six regiments of United
States infantry, out of eight held in reserve for service in tropical coun
tries. The regiments are the Twentieth, at Fort Leavenworth. Kans. ; the
Third, at Fort Snelling, Minn.; the Twelfth, at Jefferson Barracks, Mo., and
Fort Riley, Kans.; the Seventeenth, at Columbus Barracks, Ohio, the Fourth,
at Fort Sheridan, and the Twenty-second, at Fort McCook, Neb. They
will go forward to Manila as soon as transportation can be provided. It may
be that the two regiments still held in reserve, the Twenty-fourth and the
Twenty-fifth Infantry, will Join the others before they sail. These regi
ments were selected in the reverse ratio to the loss sustained by them in
the Cuban campaign.
WORKMEN IMPRISONED IN A BURNING MINE.
POTEAU, I. T., Dec. 12.â An explosion in the Indianola and Hathaway
mine, three miles from here, at 9 o'clock to-night caused the death of at
least five men. Twenty-five others are imprisoned in the mine, which is
on fire and it is feared that few of them can be rescued. The disaster
was caused by an explosion of dust, following a blast. One hundred men
were at work In the mine at the time. The greatest excitement prevails in
the vicinity of the mine, and the names of the dead and imprisoned miners
cannot be obtained.
CHARGES AGAINST ATTORNEY AND JUDGE.
CLEVELAND, 0., Dec. 12. â Charges in disbarment proceedings against
State Senator Burke have been filed with Judge Hale, Presiding
Judge of the Circuit Court. Charges in expulsion proceedings against
Common Pleas Judge F. E. Dellenbaugh have been filed with Judge C. E.
Penwell of the Investigation Committee of the Cleveland Bar Association.
These separate sets of charges were filed this afternon by H. B. Chapman,

WILL SHIP SHEEP TO THE RIO GRANDE COUNTRY.
STOCKTON, Dec. 12. â Miller & Lux, the stock raisers, have completed
preliminary arrangements for the removal of 60.000 sheep to the Rio
Grande country, and possibly, into Mexico. They fear another dry sea
son and are preparing for the worst. The shipments will be held off a
couple of weeks to ccc what the prospects are for rain. They have had sev
eral thousand sheep on reclaimed islands below the city this year.
COLUMBIA RIVER BLOCKED BY ICE FLOES.
VANCOUVER, Wash., Dec. 12.â The floating Ice which began coming

LOS ANGELES. Dec. 12.â Congressman
Brigham H. Roberts of Utah is reported
to have three wives, and the Methodist
ministers of Los Angeles are therefore
indignant at the prospect that he may be
allowed to take his seat among the Con
gressmen of the United States. The mat
ter was brought up and thoroughly dis
cussed at a meeting of the ministers held
this morning.
Rev. William Knighten made a stirring
speech in which he declared that Mor
mons had teachers even in this city who
were seeking to spread their religion and
who were winning many to the doctrine
they preached. Rev. C. P. Dandy said
that as polygamy had been declared il
legal in the United States this man hod
no right to be in Congress.
It was decided to appoint a committee,
composed of officers of the association, to
draft proper resolutions. If approved by
the association these resolutions will be
forwarded to Congressman R. J. Waters,
with the request that he use his influence
j to keep the Utah Congressman from being
recognized.
Organizations of women throughout the
country are taking up the subject, and
numerous protests will be presented to
Congress.

LABOR TROUBLES
IN THE ISLANDS
Move to Annul Hawaii's
Contract System.
PETITION SENT TO CONGRESS
WHITE MEN TAKE UP THE CBU
SADE AGAINST ASIATICS.
It Is Claimed That There Are Plenty
of Laborers in the United States
to Do All the Work on the
Sugar Plantations,
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU, Dec. 4.â lt is futile for
the sugar planters and their local or
gans to endeavor to suppress the fact
from reaching the mainland, for it is
undoubt-dly true, that the tocsin of la
bor is beginning to send forth its warn
ing tones in Hawaii. There may never
be such an outbreak here against
coolie labor as California suffered from
In the days when the cry of "The Chi-
nese Must Go" echoed through the
land, but the indications for agita
tion, and of a very practical if not
forceful character, are very numerous.
It has been surmised for some time
past that the American labor element
was secretly at work organizing and
within the last few days they have
announced their intention to present a
petition to Congress, which is being
numerously signed by the genuine
working classes of all grades. While
among the leaders are old residents
and practical politicians from the old
imerican League, one of the formerly
dominant political factions, the most
active of the agitators are men of com
paratively recent arrival, who believed
this country to be a second El Dorado,
but have been disappointed in their
hopes.
As The Call is here recognized as
the most earnest and warmest support
er of the American workingman's cause
I have been furnished with a copy of
the petition, which reads:
To the United States Senate and House
of Representatives, in Congress assem
bled:
Whereas, There are approximately 50,000
Asiatics and 4000 Americans in these
islands; and whereas this great disparity
in the races has been brought about
through the law permitting the importa
tion of contract laborer*; and whereas
Americans can do, -without impairment of
their health, all work on Hawaiian sugar
plantations; and whereas approximately
Soou contract laborers have been landed
in these islands since the American flag
was raised over them on August 12 last;
and whereas the Government of these
islands has permitted the importation of
7UOO more contract laborers to V 'be landed
before the end of the ftrst quarter of 1899;
and whereas every imported alien laborer
prevents Liie immigration to these islands
of an American laborer and his family;
and whereas the contract labor system,
enforced by criminal procedure and im
prisonment at hard labor, is. closely akin
in principle and often in the brutality
with which it is enforced by the planta
tion owners to human slavery; therefore,
we, the undersigned American citizens,
permanently residing or temporarily so
journing In the Hawaiian Islands, do
hereby petition your honorable body to:
I â Extend to these islands at the earliest
possible moment the United States immi
gration laws.
llâ Disallow and annul the contracts
and arrangements of the present Hawaiian
Government for the importation of the
before mentioned 7000 contract laborers,
provided this can be done without violat
ing the constitution or treaties of the
United States.
Ill â Abolish criminal procedure and
criminal punishments to enforce the per
formance of labor contracts.
Some of the leading projectors of the
movement in defending themselves
from the attacks of the planters' or
gans claim that the laborers on sugar
plantations should be placed on the
same scale, as far as wages and living
accommodations, as are the laborers
on the sugar beet fields in the United
States; and further they claim, from
personal knowledge and correspond
ence, that in the Eastern and Middle
States there is a sufficient supply of
competent agricultural labor to sup
plant the coolie element, willing to
work at wages almost as low as those
paid to the second-term day laborers.
coolies and Portuguese, say from $18
to $21 a month, but they would proba
bly also require a food allowance. They
also maintain that if the planters are
permitted, by way of temporary con
cession or compromise, to procure "as
sisted" labor they should be compelled
to honestly endeavor to obtain it from
the United* States before seeking for it
in Poland, Austria, Italy, Scandinavia
or Portugal.
The fact is that the spirit of unrest
Is abroad and a heated desire to thor-
oughly Americanize the islands lest we
forget, under the present peculiar con
ditions, that the Stars and Stripes float
over us for some better reason than as
a sentimental symbol of protection for
the planters' oligarchy and their system
of quasi feudal serfdom.
Owing to the cruel competition of
the Asiatics in ordinary mechanical
and industrial labor hundreds of good,
stalwart and honest citizen-making
men have called in here during the past
six months and left in disgust and
"dead broke" to give us a very un
pleasant "black eye." The Chinese will
evidently be attended to very string
ently by Commissioner J. K. Brown,
who decidedly means business.
Following the strike of the Galician
contract laborers came, like a thunder
cloud, on the 2d inst. a strike of 250
Hawaiian laborers of the Honolulu
Iron Works. They had two grievances.
The one was opposition to a new regu
lation preventing them from obtaining
money from the establishment except
on the fortnightly payday, which new
regulation they asked might be rescind
ed as the Chinese would not otherwise
give them credit for their staple food
"pol." Their second was that they did
not receive the same pay as white men
of the same grade of labor. They wish
ed their wages raised from $8 to $12 a
week. After a consultation with the
management they consented to work
until the end of the year on the same
conditions until a definite arrangement
could be arrived at.

to leave for Washington, with Mrs.

American Wins in the
Eighth Round.
ENGLISHMAN CLAIMS A FOUL
REFEREE BTTLES AGAINST HIS
CONTENTION.
Crowd at the Ringside Cheers When
the Decision Is Given in Favor
of the Colored
Lad.
NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, Eng., Dec.
12.â Bobby Dobbs, the American, beat
Dick Burge in a boxing contest here to
night for a purse of Â£250 and Â£300 a side.
In the eighth round Burge claimed a foul,
which the referee refused to allow.
Burge's backer thereupon declined to per
mit him to continue the fight.
Burge was a hot favorite, but looked
careworn, while Dobbs was in splendid
condition.. The opening rounds were rath
er feeble. There were several clinches in
which Burge had the advantage. With
the sixth round the tide began to turn.
Burge had tired perceptibly. In the fol
lowing round Dobbs settled to good form,
putting in excellent work.
Fouls were- claimed on both sides in this
round, but the referee ignored them. In
the eighth round there was desperate
fighting, Dobbs landing stinging hits on
the body and Burge being compelled to
give way. Both reeled to the ropes in
the holds. A foul was claimed, but the
referee refused to allow it and awarded
the fight to Dobbs, amid cheers from the
crowd.
The Burge party lodged a protest
against the payment of the stakes, and
threatened to make sensational revela
tions.
The sporting papers to-morrow, how
ever, will say that although the tactics
of Dobbs at the beginning of the fight
were suspicious, he deserved all praise
for his subsequent style and easily proved
himself by far the better man.
FINED FOR POACHING.
Oakland Merchant Prosecuted by the
Cordelia Club.
SUISUN, Dec. 12.â Several hours were
taken up in the Superior Court at Fair
field t iay in hearing the testimony in
the pn.eeJings* against Robert Boyer, the
Oakland merchant, for contempt of court.
A number of local sportsmen were pres
ent J. N. Young of San Francisco and Q.
R. Coghlan of this place appeared for the
Cordelia Club and District Attorney F. R.
Devlin for Boyer.
An injunction was issued and finally
made perpetual two years ago, prohibit
ing hunting on the Chamberlain tract of
6000 acres of tule land near Teal station.
Boyer was one of the defendants in that
action and was served with the injunction.
From the evidence to-day it appears
that Boyer was found hunting on the
tract on November 22 of this year. He
claimed he did not know he was on forbid
den ground. The court found him guilty
of having violated the injunction, but said
as there was some question as to his hav

A FELONY CHARGE
AWAITS DIRECTORS
GRAND JURY LOOKS UP THE
LAW.
This Evening McGlade's Examina
tion Will Beginâ Warrants All
Declared to Be Forgeries.
If there is a law on fhe statutes by
â¢which it can be dona fhe Grand Jury
before it adjourns will bring an indict
ment for felony against every member of
the Board of School Directors. This de
cision was arrived at last evening after
a decidedly warm meeting of the jury
and Assistant District Attorney Dunne
was instructed to look up the law and
prepare an opinion and plan of opera
tion in as short a time as possible. The
misappropriation of funds and general
malfeasance in office are the charges that
were discussed, and though the original
investigation into specific charges has
practically failed through the disappear
ance of most important witnesses ma
jury is confident that it has enough gen
eral evidence to bring a criminal action
on the charges mentioned.
Among the matters just at present occu
pying the attention of the jury is the
lease of the Lincoln school lot, of which
The Call made a thorough expose Borne
weeks ago. J. C. Martin, who put up the
check that bound the contract, was on
the carpet last evening and will be prob
ably called again to-morrow night, as it
is said that he is willing to tell all he
knows of that operation.
To-night the jury will give its whole
attention to the case of Peter McGlade
and it is likely that if an indictment be
found at all it will require only the one
meeting to do it. Detective Thomas Gib

PROSTRATED
BY PARALYSIS
Stroke Came While on
a Streetcar.
MYSTERY OF THE ATTACK
CANNOT BE CLEARED UNTIL THE
PATIENT IS ABLE TO SPEAK.
Car Conductor Supposed That the
Member-Elect of the State Board
of Equalization Was Asleep
or in a Stupor.
J. G. Edwards, member-elect of the
Btatfl Hoard of Equalization to represent
the First or San Francisco District, was
prostrated by a stroke of paralysis Thurs
day night. The stroke was so severe that
the patient has hardly regained conscious
ness. He is under the care of Dr. Chi
nese, the medical adviser of the Pacific
Mutual Life Insurance Company.
All the facts concerning the stroke and
the whereabouts of Mr. Edwards when it
occurred may not bÂ« known until the pa
tient recovers the powers of speech. It
is known that he visited the office of his
brother, L. B. Edwards, general mana
ger of insurance companies, at 323 Cali
fornia street, about 3 o'clock Thursday
afternoon and while there talked with
Major J. H. Simpson, expressing satis
faction that Truman Reeves, the State
Treasurer-elect, had agreed to appoint
Captain Anderson to a position in the
Treasurer's office. Later in the day Mr.
Edwards telephoned to his family at 2021
California street that he would not be
home for dinner. It was understood that
he had an engagement to dine
with some friends in the cafe of
J. C. EDWARDS.

upposed that after dinner he

â¢ â  tion of Grant avenue, Market

V. <St.
The conductor observed that one of the
I \gers wemed in he sleeping soundly,
a not give the incident more than
passing thought until the end of the run
waa reached. The conductor then sought
to arouse the sleeping passenger, but did
Â-ceed. The gripman and conductor
:M<d and decided to ascertain the
name and residence of the passenger.
Letters In his Docket convinced them that
his name wan J. G. Edwards and his resi
dence 2<">2l California street. The car on
the inward trip was stopped at this num
ber on California street and Mr. Edwards
carried home. It in assumed that the
etmke occurrred just after he transferred
from one car to another at Hyde and
California streets. It may turn out that ;
Mr. Edwards got aboard of a California
stre'-r car at Kearny or Montgomery
street, but it was his daily custom to take
the other line and transfer. His friends !
conjecture that he was abie to take care,
of himself at the transfer point, and, i
therefore, reach the conclusion that the '
stroke did not come until he got aboard of
the main line car.
Mr. Edwards is the publisher and pro. ;
prietor of the Coast Review. He is a '
comrade of the Grand Army of the Repub- !
lie. and rendered special service in secur- j
ing money to establish the Veterans'
Home at Yountville. He received the Ro- â 
publican nomination for the State Board
of Kouaizatlon to succeed A. Chese
brough and was elected, defeating John
]'. J>unn. He was an active worker
Throughout the late campaign, and should
have taken a rest of two or three weeks
after the result was made known, but he
decided to remain in his office and attend
to the affairs of his insurance journal.

ed that Mr. Edwards' condition was im- j
proving. L. B. Edwards, who is return- I
ing from a trip East, wired from Reno !
yesterday that he would arrive In Ban j

THE HEIRS OF
ADOLPH SUTRo
Will Battle Over the
Trust Clause.
ANSWER HAS BEEN FILED
TRUSTEES STAND BY THE OB
NOXIOUS PROVISION.
Emma L. Merritt and W. H. R. Adam
son Aver That the Title to the
Trust Estate Is Vested
in Them.
The clause in the -will of the late Adolph
Sutro establishing a trust over the major
portion of his estate will not be stricken
out and declared void without a bitter
legal fight. This trust clause has divid
ed the heirs of the deceased and it is
safe to assume that they will not again
amalgamate their efforts to settle the
vast estate until a decision of the highest
court upon this clause has been obtained.
Clara A. Sutr'o. Edgar E. Sutro, Kate
Nusbaum and Rosa V. Morbio appear as
plaintiffs In the action recently filed to
declare the trust clause of no effect

will are Emma L. Merritt and W. II R

DOUBLE BARS ON
HIS SHOULDERS
Lieutenant Lockwood Promotedâ Twice
He Marveiously Escaped Death.
T-URST Lieutenant John A. Lookwood. Troop M, Fourth United States
v cavalry, was yesterday promoted to be a captain. His nomination for
a captaincy was sent to the Senate by President MoKinley yesterday
along with the names of a number of other officers who were also
at th* Pro t *? Pta i n Lock^ood Is well known here, having been stationed
ai tne Presidio off and on ever since the Fourth Cavalry was ordered to
this station. Congratulations are
doubly in order In the case of Cap
tain Lockwood. He Is not an officer
who suggests romance, but there are
two occasions in his life that border
on the melodramatic, and. In fact,
the events referred to would make
material for a popular novel. There
is no denying that the guiding hand
of divine Providence has so far led
Captain Lockwood, and, as he him
self Is Inclined to express it, he has
played In luck. On no less than two
occasions should Captain Lockwood
have, metaphorically speaking,
passed in hi? checks.
He was born In Saxony, Germany,
and shortly after reaching his ma
jority entered thfÂ» marine revenue
service as a cadet. Not long after
this he received his commission
as a second lieutenant in the
Seventeenth United States Infantry.
This was on November 23, 1880. It
was only a short time after this
that General Greely started on his
expedition to the north pole. Lieu
tenant Lockwood was very anxious
to accompany the expedition, and,
in fact, almost had the appointment,
when First Lieutenant John B. Lockwood of the Twonty-third Infantry,
who was a first cousin of Captain Lockwood, made application to go on
the expedition, and, being longer in the service, was given the preference
over Captain Lockwood, who up to the eleventh hour expected to go. The
captain's cousin was one of the unfortunates that never returned, and
only his frozen body was found by the relief party.
The first active service that Captain Lockwood saw was when he
joined his regiment at Fort Pemblna, North Dakota. He next ok a two
years" course at the infantry and cavalry school at Fort Leavenworth.
After graduating from there he rejoined his regiment at Fort Custer
Montana. In 1891 Captain Lockwood saw service in the Pine Ridge out
break, although at that time he was not actually under fire. He was
promoted to be first lieutenant on June 22, 1889. and not long afterward
transferred with First Lieutenant Walter M. Dickinson, then of the Fourth
Cavalry, Captain Lockwood coming to the Fourth Cavalry and Lieutenant
Dickinson going to the Seventeenth Infantry. Hereby nangs miracle num
ber two, for the Seventeenth Infantry was one of the regiments ordered
to Cuba, and Lieutenant Dickinson was one of the officers killed at the
head of the regiment in the San Juan Hill engagement.
Captain Lockwood during the late T*ar was ordered to Mississippi for
the purpose of mustering in the volunteer troops of that State. He mus
tered in the First and Second Volunteer regiments of the State. Captain
Lockwood is one of the most efficient officers in tne army. He. is excep
tionally well read and a close observer of many things connected with the
army, and ho shows the possession of a vast amount of detail knowledge
of his chosen profession. Captain Lockwood Is a son of Surgeon John A.
Lockwood of the navy, whose famous essay on "Flogging in the Navy,"
written for a Congressional committee, was the cause of the legislation
that abolished that horrid practice. Captain Lockwood 1b an exceedingly
popular officer. He Is pleasant and agreeable in his manner and most ap
pro achabla.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1898.
Merritt; and Charles W. Sutro. The line
is about evenly drawn and the interests
of plaintiffs and defendants are about
even, so a bitter legal fight is assured.
In the complaint plaintiffs ask that all
questions concerning the validity of any
gift, devise or trust under any instru
ment purporting to be a will of Adolph
Sutro, under which the defendants claim,
save such questions as under the consti
tution belong exclusively to probate jur
isdiction, be finally determined and ad
judicated and determined in this action.
They also ask that it be decreed that the
said defendants have no interest in the
property and that Emma L. Merritt and
\V. H. R. Adamson and all parties claim
ing under them, be restrained from claim
ing any interest in the estate.
The property left in trust by the de
ceased includes all of the beach property,
which Is considered the most valuable
asset of the estate, and in the event the
trust clause is declared invalid, as it was
in the will of the late Senator Fair, its
value will doubtless be enhanced.
In the answer filed yesterday by the
defendants it is manifest that they have
joined issues, not that the legal points in
volved may be finally passed upon, but with
the purpose of sustaining the trust clause
as well as all the provisions of the will.
In the answer defendants deny that their
claims are without right and aver that
they are well founded; that the instru
ment establishing the trust is valid and
the will of Adolph Sutro. As trustees un
der the provisions of the will they aver
that they are the owners of the property
to which the plaintiffs seek possession
and are entitled to the possession of all
the property Â«=Pt forth in the complaint.
As an affirmative defense and counter
claim the defendants set forth that under
the terms of the will all the property set
forth in the complaint (the title to an un
divided two-thirds of which Is sought
to be quieted by the action) was con
veyed to the defendant trustees for
charitable purposes.
In conclusion the defendants pray that
the action ho dismissed: that the court
declare that the title to the property rests
In the trustees nam^d and that the plain
tiffs have not jointly, individually or oth
erwise any interest in or claim to the
most valuable portion of the estate of the
dead millionaire.

The schooners Volante and Sev?n Sisters

there indefinitely. The Volante left here
on October 8 and the Seven Sisters on
October 22, In ballast. They reached
Xehalem all right, but no sooner had they
crossed In than the bar began to shoal.
Captains Krog and Rasmussen thought
the river would make another passage for
itself and proceeded to load their vessels.
Instead of making a passage for itself,
the river shoaled up the bar more and
more until the two schooners were fast
prisoners. After six weeks of waiting
Captains Krog and Rasmussen gave up
in despair and returned to the city with
their crews. The vessels are now hard
and fast in the river for the winter, and
the only chance for them is that a freshet
may open a new channel In the spring
and let them out.
Mme. Relne Barrios had quite a tilt with
the customs authorities before she got
her belongings off the Mail steamer City
of Panama. She is supposed to own one
of the most magnificent collections of
jewels in the world, and it was over these
that the trouble arose. She was walking
down the gangway of the steamer, when a
custom-house officer accosted her. In her
hand she carried a small satchel, and the
inspector asked to be allowed to inspect
the contents. Madame indignantly re
fused to allow the official to open the bag,
paying it contained her personal effects.
"I can't help that," was the answer. "I
must see the contents."
"There is nothing in it but my dia
monds, and they are valued at $100,000,"
said Mme. Barrios, quietly.
"All the more reason why I should Bee
them," as quietly answered the inspector.
"Diamonds are dutiable."
Madame protested that all the stones
were purchased in the United States, but
the officer was obdurate. Agent Schwerin
was appealed to, but he could only ad
vise that the diamonds be left aboard
the ship in the treasure-room until the
Collector of the Port could be appealed to.
Yesterday morning Mme. Barrios paid
JIUOO duty and received her jewels.*

but were refused permission, then the
boat was headed for Greenbrae. The par
ty landed and had a good time, but whrn
they got back to the launch she was hard
and fast in the mud. Some of the men
wont gunning and got some small birda,
which the ladies cooked and made into a
supper.
Had it not been for a lucky find the
party would have had to remain on the
launch all night. The Arizona was built
for a Klondike company, but the com
pany disbanded and the boat was re
turned to the builders. While rummag
ing around one of the party found sev
eral pairs of snowshoes and when these
were put on the men ventured on the
mud and began pushing the boat toward
deep water. At midnight she was afloat
but in the excitement of pushing her over
the mud the engineer had let the fire go
out under the boiler, so It took another
hour to get up steam. About 2 a. m. the
party reached San Francisco hungry and
disgusted over the mishap.

CITIZEN JUDGES
OF MRS. BOTKIN
Continued from First Page.
was colorless and her eyes sunken, show-
Ing great pain and suffering. The wit
ness learned that Mrs. Dunning's illness
was of the same nature as that of his
wife. His daughter was in the same room
as her mother and he attended to both
of them. He did not see the candy until
after the death of the women.
To Attorney Knight the witness ex
plained the nature of the house in which
they lived. It was unusually large and
built on the Colonial style. He told of
calling in Dr. Bishop to attend his wife on
Wednesday morning m 7 o'clock. The
doctor called and wrote a prescription
which Mr. Deane took to have filled. The
doctor saw the seriousness of the case and
spent nearly the entire day in attendance.
"Did he make any examination for
phials or bottles?" asked Mr. Knight.
"He did not. He diagnosed the case as
one of cholera morbus and treated It ac
cordingly," said the witness. Continuing,
he said "his wife could retain nothing on
her stomach and the doctor changed the
medicine in an effort to bring relief.
Thursday afternoon he gave her a stimu
lant, as she seemed very low. She then
had convulsions and he called in another
physician for consultation. While they
were discussing the case the woman died.
Replying to questions the witness paid he
had not examined the pantry nor had he
made inquiry of the cook as to the condi
tion of the food. At that time he had not
been told of the candy. He did not see
it nor know where it was until the Satur
day after his wife's death.
John B. Pcnnington, the venerable
father of the two murdered women, was
the last witness for the day and he had
not completed his testimony when the
hour for adjournment had arrived. When
called to the stand he said his occupation
was that of a lawyer, which profession he
had followed since 1857. From 1877 to 1891
he occupied a seat In the House of Repre
sentatives. In 1874 and 1875 he was Attor
ney General of Delaware. He first told
of the members of his family who were
gathered under his roof tree in August.
On being asked as to the occupation of
John P. Dunning, he said he was admitted
to the bar in Delaware and later came
out West and entered the employ of the
Associated Press. The witness could not
tell the exact date that Mrs. Dunning- went
to Delaware, but he thought it was late
in 1896. With her was her seven-year-old
daughter. In addition to them there was
living in the house at the time of the mur
ders Mr. Deane, his wife and daughter
and Harry Pennlngton, a grandson, who
was spending the summer.
"Do you remember the 9th of August?
asked Attorney Hosmer.
"Very distinctly, sir," was the response.
The witness told of procuring the trout
which was served for supper from the
Delaware River, "some seven miles from
my home in an air line or nine miles by
the carriage road." The witness testified
that after supper he lay down in the
siiting-room. Later he went out on the
porch and saw all the family assem
bled there. Mrs. Dunning was holding a
box of candy in her hand. She said, "See,
papa, what a nice box of candy some one
has sent me." She offered him some,
which he declined, as he had tobacco in
his mouth at the time. He went out and
returned about 9 o'clock, finding the fam
ily in the parlor. They soon retired, and
he fastened up the house and retired also.
About midnight he heard Mrs. Deane
vomiting, and her husband waiting on
her. He did not see her until morning,
when he went to her room, and seeing her
condition sent for a doctor. He also
found Mrs. Dunning 111. The witness told
of the attention bestowed on the ailing
members of his household and then of
the death of his two daughters.
When shown the candy box he identi
fied it as the one he had seen in his house
at Dover, Delaware. He found it at that
time on top of his secretary, and the
wrapper was then placed roughly about
it. He placed his initials on the wrap
per and also upon the top and bottom
of the box containing the candy. He
nlso initialed the note and the hand
kerchief. After this he locked the box
and its contents in a bureau. The wrap
per was taken by the witness to his
office in the County Building. Here he
compared the address with that on an
anonymous letter received by Mrs. Dun
ning some time previously. In his opin
ion they corresponded.
After the burial of his daughters, he al
lowed Dr. Bishop to take five or six
pieces of the candy from the box and then
locked the hanaKerchief. note and candy
all up together. On August 22 the witness
delivered all the articles to Detective Mc-
Vey in Dover. He. next saw them in the
office of Chief Lees since he came to this
city.
The witness identified two letters as
having been received, one in June and the
other in July. These were the anonymous
letters which have figured in the" case.
He found them in his mail box, and after
handing the first one to Mrs. Dunning, to
whom they were addressed, she told him
not to hand her any more that might
come in that handwriting. The later one
he did not show her. The first of the.
letters was found among Mrs. Dunning'a
effects; the second, he retained. Attorney
Hosmer attempted to establish the iden
tity of the writing on the package with
that of the anonymous letter. He did
not succeed, although the defense, did so
unintentionally later.
Mr. Knight took the witness over the
ground regarding the letters, and then
went abruptly to the question as to the
quality of the fish off which the family
had dined. Mr. Pennington explained
then that his suspicions regarding- the
randy were aroused because of the simi
larity of the handwriting on the anony
mous letter and that on the wrapper of
the box. He thought that the same hand
wrote both. The two letters were thus
brought into the evidence. The court
then adjourned until 10 o'clock this morn
ing.
Will Not Be Exhumed.
DOVER. Del.. Deo. 12.â There has been
considerable surprise expressed here over
tho report printed here as coming from
one of the San Francisco papers in which
It was stated that Chief of Police Lees
of San Francisco had sent two physicians
to this city to exhume the bodies of Mrs.
Dunning and Mrs. Deane. There is noth
ing in the report. If such an attempt to
gather evidence should bo made it would
certainly prove a failure, for both bodies
were embalmed before burial and the em
balming fluid would neutralize all traces
of poison taken into the stomach.
Bell's Pistol Was Loaded.
William Bell, residing at 29^ Fourteenth
street, while rummaging through a
drawer in the bureau yesterday afternoon
found an old-fashioned pistol, which he
proceeded to examine. Being curious to
find out which end of the weapon the bul
let went Into and also which end it went
I out, he kept his finger on the trigger, and
! in doing so pressed sufficiently hard to
I snap the hammer. The report of the dis
charge, together with the powder flashing
into his eyes, satisfied him as to how a
bullet leaves a firearm when properly
charged. Fortunately for Bell, there was
not sufficient powder to blind him, but
his eyebrows were singed and his sight
was temporarily affected. He is now sat-
I lsfled with his discovery.

Captain Spiilane Relieves Two Fami
lies Who Were Destitute.
Ex-Chief of Police Crowley and Captain
Hall, both of whom are directors In the
Hibemla Bank, yesterday afternoon vis
ited the Southern Station and grave Cap
tain Spiilane $32 50. with the Instruction
to use it in providing for the Sheppard
and Thorsen families, who were reported
to be in destitute circumstances. Ac
companied by one of his men Captain
Spiilane first visited the home of Mrs. |
Thorsen, at 435 Fourth street. The un
fortunate woman was In bed, seriously
ill. In the room with her was her infant
child, apparently suffering for the want
of some nourishment. In answer to the
questions of the kind-hearted police offi
cial the woman said that her husband
eked out a miserable existence by work
ing as a porter in a Third-street saloon. !
i Captain Spiilane went to the saloon and 1
j found Thorsen. Both his hands are crip- ;
! pled from rheumatism and it was with j
difficulty that he could use them. Con
vinced that it was a deserving case. Cap
tain Spiilane returned to the house and
gave Mrs. Thorsen $15. After leaving her
the captain went to the home of the Shep
pard family, at 929^ Alabama street. He
found Mrs. Sheppard ill with fever and
ague. She has four children, the eldest
of whom is six years. The children are
also suffering from the dreaded fever.
Satisfied that the family was In need Cap
tain Spiilane gave the mother the balance
of the money, amounting to $17 50. In both
cases the destitute women profusely
thanked the official for the welcome sums
of money.

Lawyer Boone Beadmitted.
United States Circuit Court Judge Mor
row yesterday readmitted John L. Boone
to practice in his court. Boone was dis
barred about a year ago for offering his
services on behalf of one of thedefendants
in the suits brought by A. B. Bowers for
infringements of his patents on the
Bowers dredger and for intimating that
his experience as attorney for Bowers in
several of those cases would be of value
to the new clients he was seeking on the
other side of the case after he and

petition for his reinstatement had been
got up by Judge S. C. Denson and Bert
Schlesinger. It was signed by 220 attor
neys.

After 35 Years of Suffering.
It will be gratifying 1 to Asthmatic
readers to learn that an absolute cure
has at last been discovered by Dr. Ru-
dolph Schiffmann. That the remedy is
an effectual one cannot be doubted

sleep all night with perfect comfort,
which I have not done before for 35
years, and I thank you for the health
that I now enjoy. I hope that you will
publish this letter, that others may
learn of its wonderful virtues."

THE SCHOOL BOfIRD BOODLERS.
THE rumor that the creditors of the School De
partment are about to begin suits against the
bondsmen of the Directors for the recovery of I
their claims is calculated to cast a ray of sunshine
Upon the spectacle of squalid corruption with which
the Board of Education is now surrounded. If the
suits can be made to stick a great point will be gained. j
Hereafter sdid citizens will hesitate to become bon<!>
men for boodling School Directors and that species
of cattle will have difficulty in qualifying for office
and in holding office while boodling at the public
expense.
Besides, it is well to resort to law before resorting
to the homely expedients of rotten eggs, dead cats ,
and tar and feathers. Not but what the ring in the
Board of Education richly deserves the application of
these things, but they are a trifle uncivilized and cal
culated to lower the public dignity and character. If
the bondsmen of the boodlers can be made to pay for
the waste and extra vaganccot the School Board, not
only will the bamboozled creditors gel what is hoa
eetly due then:, bin a precedent -xi.! be set tending i
to deter future boocling- in the Scboo! De^/s.rttaent. !
We sincerely trc-t thai tht 3<S2.r<i of Trade, which has \
this matter in ha.nl, wi3 proseccte it to 2 fine] con- :

: maintained that
the member.; of the present School Board ring have
â  ing, except a disposition to
steal '"â  â Â£ a period of two
thin their reach. Hence it ought to
follow : . that the men who guar
anteed themâ who are, in fact, responsible for placing
â¢them in pt -â â â  â  : !aV e been enabled to
stealâshould be made to pay for whatever the teach
' '<>'>\ Department have lost
through their malversation.
Moreover, this method of attack may make an im- '
prt ion upon the bulwarks of the-e boodlers. The I
School Board ring has laughed at the people, flaunted
the police, defied the courts and sneered at the Grond j
Jury. Nothing in the form of law has seemed to give !
it the slightest concern. Perhaps judgments which
will make its friends and supporters pay something i
for the luxury of affiliating with it may serve to bring !
it to time. Evidently the members of the ring are
â¢without moral sense. They belong to a class of public
thieves who set all regard for decency and appear- I
ances at defiance. Next to a coat of tar and feathers
the best thing to do with such men is to take their i
property from them, which can be done by attacking i
them through their bondsmen.
BUYING HUMAN BEINGS.
IN referring to the proposed sale of the Philippines
by the United States the Examiner, which has a
"National Policy," says, "We are not given to
selling millions of human beings to the highest bid
der." It should have added, "We are in favor of buy
ing millions of human beings without their own con
sent and against their own will, after warning off all
bidders but ourselves."
This is the same paper which, as our correspondent,

A CURRENCY SESSION.
THE first act of thÂ« Republican national ad
ministration elected in 1896 was to call a tariff
session of Congress, in which the Republican
party immediately proceeded to redeem its pledge
made to the protectionists of the country. This work
v.-as begun and finished in a shorter time than has
been required in the preparation of any of the great
tariff bills passed since the civil war. Under it there
has been a marvelous expansion of trade. The com
mercial balance has shifted to our side and we have
become the creditor, instead of a debtor nation. This
process has turned the flow of gold to the United
States, until we possess more now per capita than
ever before in our history. The revenue results of
the tariff, it is true, have not been as satisfactory as
its effect upon trade, but the high credit of our Gov
ernment enables it to replenish its treasury and tide
over any such temporary lapse in revenues.
These high and satisfactory conditions of trade, in
stead of pushing financial and currency reform out of
focus, fix it there more firmly. Expanding trade re
quires a perfectly sound foundation. The sounder this
is, the greater is the possible expansion, without run
ning into 'the risks of speculation.
The Republican pledge to sound money legislation
made in 1896 was repeated in more positive and
clearer tones in 1808. The silver sentiment in the
party, which had spread like the mycelium of a fun
gus, through the influence of local expressions of pol
icy and prevailing ignorance of the subject prior to
1896, was largely eliminated in the Presidential cam
paign. The influence of men of knowledge and con
victions and courage on the money issue has be
come dominant in the party, and the State platforms
this year reflected their sentiments, so that the Re
publican Congress which comes in on the 4th of
next March is committed irrevocably to this reform.
But pledges are like constitutions. They are inchoate
unless vitalized by legislation. The sound money
Republicans and their faithful allies, the National
Democrats, have recognized the inutility of attempt
ing to redeem the sound money pledge with the pres
ent adverse Senate. Such attempt would have ended
in defeat, and defeat would only have emboldened
and encouraged the fiatists, and discouraged the
sound-money men. This tolerant and proper view j
of the situation brought all sound-money men to
gether in the State elections of this year and they
fought the way to victory with singular courage.
They not only held the House, but gained the Senate.
Now they want the prompt and beneficial use of the
power they have won.
That can be best done by an extra session of the
Fifty-sixth Congress. Let us have a currency ses
sion of Congress as soon after the 4th of next March
a. : the President can call it.
Since the election an expression has been made
by the leading public men in Indiana, lowa and Wis
consin. The sound-money Republicans in those
States are unanimous in the desire for such extra
session.
No State ha? been a more tempestuous storm
center on this subject than Wisconsin, and the policy
advocated there fairly represents the views expressed
in other States named. Mr. Payne of Milwaukee,
member of the Republican National Committee,
;ay?: "Prudence, right and redemption of the
pledges solemnly made by the party demand that we
the subject of currency reform at the
t moment. We have redeemed our
" ' Now iet us redeem
r ] -<: on the financial problem."
â  - . nC. Spooler say?: "That a wise cur
' ould be passed at the earliest op
â¢ â  itj, I believe,"
General Ed. S. Bragg 1 , Gold Democratic leader:
"An extra session of the Fifty-sixth Congress seems
a necessity if the administration intends to define and
settle the monetary policy of the United States."
Ex-United States Senator William F. Vilas: "I
believe that if the Republicans intend to keep faith
with the people and carry out their pledge to reform
the currency, their opportunity has come and their
duty is plain."
Ellis B. Usher of the Gold Democratic National
Committee: "The currency question may be set
tled at an extra session in time to have it disposed
of before the Presidential campaign of 1000. In my
opinion this is what the people expect of the Fifty
sixth Congress. This is what the Gold Democrats
voted for."
These views are supported in interviews by Wis
consin Congressmen Cooper, Esch, Davidson, Jen
kins and others.
In Indiana John P. Frenzel, Gold Democratic Na
tional Committee, S. P. Sheerin, former Secretary
National Democratic Committee deposed at Chicago
in 1806. and Republicans like F. L. Powell, John
Marshall, Robert Graham, Congressman Royse and
scores of others, who are at once recognized by any
one acquainted with the pubiic men of that State
as the leaders of party and public opinion, concur
in the views expressed in Wisconsin.
In lowa Judge French, J. J. Richardson, Ed.
Campbell, Colonel Martin, W. I. Babb, Gold Demo
crats, and Governor Shaw, all the Republican mem
bers of Congress and Senators Gear and Allison con
cur. In Nebraska the same condition of opinion ap
pears in many interviews.
This reform is especially precious to the West, as
protection was to the East. The West has made
the change in the Senate and held for the party its
control of the House. To that control California
contributed nearly one-half the majority which will
exercise it. The voice of this State should be raised
effectively for a currency session, for it will be heard
with respect.
CHARACTERISTICALLY CREELMfIN.
THE latest interview of the Examiner with the
Pope is characterized by the Creelman touch.
That is, it is so palpably a fake that no observ
ing intelligence is under the slightest obligation to
believe it. Creelman has reached that state where, in
common with Baldwin, he has lost power to deceive.
The difference is that Baldwin acknowledges the situ
ation, and seems rather glad of it. while Creelman
keeps up a wordy pretense of honesty.
This interview does not purport to have been had
by Creelman, but by Philippe Tonclli. As though to
give it standing, however, Creelman prepared an in
troduction. He may have done this seriously, but
possibly it was done as a Baldwinese stroke of irony.
In it the regular correspondent directs attention to an
interview he secured in 1800 with the Pope. Perhaps
there was such an interview: far more likely not. But
why did Creelman omit allusion to his interview with
the same notable sent over during the progress of
the war with Spain, and officially denounced as ficti
tious the instant called to the notice of Cardinal
Rampolla? Why did he not strengthen the hand of
Tonclli by a brief account of the interview with the
Queen Regent, an interview indignantly repudiated
as soon as printed? Why not an account of the let
ter bearing the signature of Madame Dreyfus, and by
her denounced in Le Temps as a swindle and open
forgery?

interviews presented in the paper, which he has the
doubtful honor to supply with tales rich in imagery,
but barren of the valuable element of truth. It was
the Examiner that ascribed to Mrs. McKinley words
never uttered by her, and which has at various times
printed "interviews" with princes and potentates who
had never heard of the existence of the sheet, nor so
much as acknowledged the impertinent card of its
representative.
Aside from being discredited by the Creelman in
troduction and eulogy, the latest interview is silly. It
contains no gleam of anything which may pass for
information. It could have been written in New
York or Madrid as well as in Rome, and by the office
boy as well as by Creelman, save that the office boy
might have a trace of conscience to hamper him.
Where the Examiner made a mistake, in addition
to the stupidity of indulging in a fraudulent scheme,
was to permit the name of Creelman to appear. Those
familiar with the methods of that romancer and brag
gart will not doubt for a moment that he was guilty of
the entire article.
THE VIEWS OF SOME STATESMEN.
WHILE we are giving so much attention every
day to more or less commonplace views on the
various issues before vs â the Philippine ques
tion and the problems of the future â it will be just as
well to ponder a little on the recent utterances of
some statesmen whose views are not commonplace.
It is always the unexpected that happens, and pos
sibly one of these fellows with unexpected ideas may
call the turn.
There is Senator Kyle, who proposes that after hav
ing purchased the Philippines for $20,000,000 we shall
now sell them for $200,000.000 â a scheme that would
not only gain for us a profit of $180,000,000, but would
provide us, further, with the pleasure of watching a
general scrimmage among European nations for the
privilege of being the purchaser.
A still better scheme is that of Senator Chandler,
who proposes that we trade the Philippines to Gre^t
Britain for Canada. The swap would be a good bar
gain from every point of view. We should by that
one simple act get possession of the Klondike and
get rid of Aguinaldo, two things most devoutly to be
wished. The defect of the scheme is that it alarms
the Canadians. One 01" their poets has been already
so moved by it as to fear our professions of friend
ship and to sing of our national eagle-bird:
His voice is mollnw as music; it hath a most unctu
ous "quack."
I hope it's all in good earnest, but I won't take
anything back.
I'm jollying you, Mr. Canuck, I hope you will listen,
my buck â
Keep your nose to the wind, and keep your eye
skinned, for the Eagle that talks like a duck!
Our own country- is not the only country, how
ever, where statesmen of originality have freedom of
thought and speech. Canada herself has some of
them. One of these proposes that Great Britain
trade Jamaica and her other West Indian islands for
the Xew England States and annex the latter to Can
ada. The scheme has its merits and might be worked
but for the fact that Dewey has his home in Vermont.
We cannot trade off the hero's home.
Most original of all is a certain Mr. Turgeon, Min
ister of Colonization and Mines in the province of
Quebec. This statesman, in a speech made in France on
the occasion of a demonstration in honor of Champlain,
the founder of Quebec, told the French that within a
comparatively short time both Canada and the United
States would be disrupted. The Germans, he said, are
taking possession of the Mississippi Valley and will
eventually set up a government of their own. Then
the French Canadians, who are overrunning New
England, will add those States to Quebec and set up
a French nationality.
Altogether the honors of statesmanship are about
even between the countries, with the advantage a little
in favor of the Canucks. It is about time some of our
poets were singing a song of warning against the
beaver that honks like a goose.
WITH this week the pleasant task of Christmas
shopping should go forward in earnest. It is
a good plan to make a resolution not to wait
for the coming of Christmas week before making the
necessary purchases of gifts and delicacies for the
great day. The golden rule for all shoppers at this
season of the year is to go early and avoid the rush.
This week the weather promises to be fine. Next
week there may be rain and sloppy streets. This
week there will be a fair opportunity to shop in com
fort. Next week there is sure to be a crush and a
crowd in every store where Christmas novelties are
kept. Every argument of personal convenience,
therefore, tends to impel the wise to wait no longer,
but to get their holiday trading done at once.
Personal convenience, however, is not the only
thing to be considered at this season. Women who
can afford to shop in the daytime by reason of having
leisure while others are at work should remember
that a great many persons are of necessity compelled
to do most of their shopping after working hours.
They should, therefore, do their shopping early and
make way for the workers. There is no reason why
the average woman should throng the stores until
late and crowd the' 6 o'clock cars, when the general
mass of working people are going home and are tired.
If those who have the opportunity to shop early in
the day will do so and get out of the way for the
evening crowds it will be pleasanter for everybody.
There is nothing to be lost by prompt shopping.
Every form of Christmas novelty that will be offered
at this season is now in stock and ready for sale.
Nothing can be gained by waiting, but on the other
hand much may be lost, for the most attractive arti
cles will go fast, and the stocks will be rapidly de
pleted. Moreover, in the rush that is sure to come
with the closing days the clerks cannot wait upon
customers as attentively as they can this week. A
word to the wise: Finish your shopping this week
and next week you can watch the crowds struggling
in the thronged stores and enjoy the sight without
having to mix in the scramble.
Nobody can blame the Spanish Commissioners for
having declined to dine with the Americans. They
have been humiliated, and a dinner would appear to
be a method of rubbing it in.
Manifestly there would be injustice somewhere if
Chicago Aldermen were to be hanged and members
of the San Francisco Board of Education escape.
Cubans are welcoming American troops vocifer
ously, and there are a lot of microbes in the island
waiting for a chance to show their attachment.
The public will be best satisfied with the Baldwin
Hotel when the site shall have become a hole in the
ground.
in not interviewing the Ahkoond of Swat the Ex
aminer is permitting a great opportunity to go by.
There is not going to be any mad scramble for the
position of Minister to Spain.
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
A STUDY OF THE RAINFALL.
The October bulletin of the climate and crop service of the Weather
Bureau, California section, issued by the Department of Agriculture, con
tains an elaborate study of the seasonal and monthly rainfall at San Fran
cisco from 1849 to 1898 by Marsden Manson, one of our most accurate stu
dents of the subject. Owing to the keen interest felt in the subject by all
Californians at this time we reproduce the tables given by Mr. Manson and
his conclusions drawn from them.
As Mr. Manson points out, the rainfall at San Francisco has been quite
accurately and continuously recorded since 1849. Up to 1870 the record was
kept only by Thomas Tennent. Since that date it has also been kept by
the United States Signal Service and by the Weather Bureau. The fol
lowing table gives the monthly and annual rainfall, the totals and means
from 1849 to 1898:

In this period of forty-nine years the normal seasonal rainfall has been
23.4 inches. In the period under consideration there have been fluctuations
in seasonal rainfall from 7.4 In 1850-51, to 49.2 inches in 1861-62. The mean
seasonal precipitation for the entire period is 23.4 inches, the mean for each
month and for each season of the year being given In the table. The
entire period may be subdivided into five classes, (1) extremely dry, (2)
dry, (3) average, (4) wet, and (5) extremely wet years. This subdivision i 3
an arbitrary one (as would be any subdivision whatever), and the follow
ing: classification is made: Extremely dry years, less than 14 inches; dry
years, from 14 inches to 19 inches; average years, from 19 inches to 28
inches: wet years, from 29 inches to 35 inches: and extremely wet years, over
36 inches of rainfall. Based on this classification we have the following:
The seasons of 1850-51, 1562-63, 1563-64, 1870-71, 1576-77 and 1597-38 have been
extremely dry. the mean monthly rainfall being as follows:

In connection with these statistics compiled by Mr. Manson, it should
be noted that the official weather report for the State gives on December
11 the following table of the seasonal rainfalls to date, as compared with
those of same date last season, and rainfall In past twenty-four hours:
Last This Last
Stationsâ 24 Hours. Season. Season.
Eureka 0.00 8.13 12.70
Rert Bluff 0.00 2.13 5.47
Sacramento â  0.00 1.61 3.58
San Francisco 0.00 3.38 3.87

Los AnKPles 0.00 0.12 2.4S
San Diego 0.00 0.53 1.19
Yuma 0.00 0.70 0.77
As the conclusions derived from his studies of the tables given Mr. Man
son says:
"If these figures and the resulting curves yield any guide in forecasting
seasons, we have the following: Both dry and extremely dry seasons are
deficient in autumnal rainfall. In extremely dry years the greatest
monthly deficiency occurs in December and continues through the spring. In
dry years the greatest deficiency falls in January, followed by a spring in
which the departure from normal rainfall is light.
The five extremely wet years have maximum is in January, followed by
a wet spring. In wet years the autumnal rainfall is heavy, followed by a
maximum in December, which continues above the normal through the
rest of the winter and spring. In extremely wet years the maximum rain
fall is in January, continuing well above the normal to April, and falling
sharply below the normal in May.
'â¢These variations in the winter rainfall are primarily due to the changes
in the position of the lines upon and along which the areas of low pressure
originate and move in their course from the North Pacific into the interior
of the continent. It therefore becomes important to know the causes and
conditions controlling this shifting or restriction of the belt of rain distribu
tion, for when these shall become known it will be reasonably possible to
foretell whether a winter will be one of deficient, average or excessive rain
fall." .

John Bourdette states that he had fairly
good duck-shooting near Delano on Sat

A prominent sportsman who has just

the rich sportsmen of Portland City are
enjoying grand shooting, and. to his sur
prise, they sell their game to game deal
ers, after taking from th^ sacks whatever
birds they need for their own use. Cali

rather peculiar, as a man who sells game
here is looked upon as h market hunter.
In Portland market hunters are conse

HANDICAP ON ZANTE CTJRRANTS I
President McKinley Will Not Admit
Them Free of Duty.
The anti-Zante currant fight is won, ac
cording to a brief dispatch received yes
terday from Hugh Craig, president of the
Chamber of Commerce of this city, now
in Washington in the interests of the
Nicaragua canal. During the holding of
the Fruit Growers' Convention in Fresno
the information came from Washington
to the effect that in order to establish a
better relationship and feeling with
Greece certain concessions were likely to
be made in the matter of admitting free
of duty certain products of the Mediter
ranean country, and the Zante currant
was one of these. As might be expected,
this proposition caused great consterna
tion on the part of the raisin growers of
this State. Three or four years ago this
matter was the subject of much discus
sion, the question being. Is the Zante cur
rant a currant or a raisin?
At any rate, the decision was that it
should not be admitted free of duty, be
cause It came into direct competition with
the raisins of this State, and the duty
imposed has had the desired effect of
keeping the objectionable fruit or berry
out of the markets of this country. As
soon as the Western raisin growers scent
ed danger in the air by abolishing the
tariff on the currants they sent most
earnest protests to Washington to have
the measure defeated. One was forward
ed to Mr. Craig, who was urged to exert
every influence with the Pacific Coast
representatives. That success is assured
may be inferred by the following extract
from Mr. Craig's dispatch: "The Presi
dent authorizes the statement that Cali
fornia fruit interests are paramount. No
need to be uneasy about Zante currants."

FAVORITES IN

AT INGLESIDE
Capture Four Purses
Reopening Day.
LA GOLETA IS INVINCIBLE
RAN AWAY F'-IOM TOPMAST AND
HER FIELD.
Ailyar Demonstrated He Could Go
a Route â Bernardillo Performed
Another Acrobatic Feat.
Yemen Scores Easily .
Ingleside track again controls the racing
situation. The card for reopenelng day,
with one exception, was a speckled one,
and the attendance was not large. The
favorites were in fine form, capturing four
of the six purses offered.
The only event possessing any sem
blance of class was the mile and a six
teenth run, in which La Goleta conceded
weight to such shifty performers as Top
maist. David Tenny and Hugh Penny, and
gave them a drubbing. The Baldwin mare
was a 1 to 2 chance in the betting around
post time, and was never headed at any
stage of the running. Spencer sat on her
back and she led Topmast over the line
more than a length, in 1:47\. With the
weight up David Tenny found the sport
too hot for him, but managed to get the
show from Hugh Penny.
Pat Dunne started his fast youngster
Ailyar in the opening: event at seven fur
longs, fnr two-year-olds, and considerable
speculation was indulged in as to whether
he could negotiats the distance. Start
ing a 3 to 5 favorite, he set all doubt at
rest by leading from start to finish. Cas
dale secured the place from the wretched
ly ridden Los Medanos, which had evi
dently undergone the canning process.
The fastidious Bernardillo, the wizard
horse of Jimmy Coffey's barn, again gave
the talent a frightful walloping. The
second number on the card was a mile
and a furlong run, decided under selling
conditions, and Bernardillo was backed
down to even money favoritism. Why he
was rated the first part under a choking
pull will probably remain an unwritten
chapter of turf history. When "Skeets"
Martin finally gave the animal his head,
he quickly led Myth, but in the run home
was passed by everythting. finishing last.
Red Glenn, piloted with rare judgment by
Bullman. won cleverly, in l:s4*t, from
Lady Hurst, aSO to 1 outsider. Lena, an
other long priced one, was third.
The mile selling run that followed was
taken by P. Ryan's gelding Cyril, a 1 to 2
favorite In the books. He made the run
ning and led Cabrillo out by a couple of
lengths.
Old Yemen shook the dust from his coat
and defeated Zamar and some lesser lights
with ease in the six furlong spin, fifth on
the programme. As good as 4 to 5 was
hung out against htm. and the aged sprin
ter cake-walked home in front of Zamar,
which hone was next In demand in the
ring. Highland Ball was left at the post.
Outside of First Call and O. B. Morris, a
motley gnthering of horseflesh lined up in
the llnal mile run. Morris was Installed
favorite, but was beaten in romping fash
ion by First Call, ridden by Turner. Una
Colorado finished third.
Track Notes.
Seventeen books cut in.
Billy Connors found business lively In
the field book line.
Bernard (Ktd) Weller was on the
grounds, and not feeling in a particularly
gay mood after his trip across the moun
tains, only made a couple of small bets of
two hundred thousand each.
Willie Applegate appeared on the block,
chalking up prices under the name of the
Chicago Club.
Pat Dunne was doubtful about Ailyar's
' ability to win the opening event, as he
hud worked at the. distance but once, and
i then in the face of a strong wind. After
sizing the entries up he bet WO on Los Me
danos, and Powell didn't like that cult. It
just goes to show what a really hard
| game it is to beat.
J. L. Hyman and Ben Carson, well
: known in Eastern turf circles, were at the
! track.
j "Dick" Collins, the capable and widely
; known sporting writer of the St. Louis
j Republic, and "Cap" Tillis, an extensive
speculator of the Mound City, were ex
| pected in on last evening's overland train
Mo?e Getz has turned his back on book
making and is having better success on
the ground. He met with a sharp reverse
though, when Highland Ball was left at
the post, carrying a thousand-dollar com
mission.
Bud Houser and his brother George are
fresh arrivals from the Eastern country.
Bud was formerly secretary for J. Talbbt
Clifton, the Earl of Bllngum.
Bullman was there again with two win
ners yesterday. v
Topmast apparently weathered the re
cent gale in good shape, for his race was
quite a toothsome racing morsel. Some
of these epicurean Eastern gentlemen who
are afraid to leave their trunks unlocked
while residing in California are not so bad
themselves.

BOWERS WINS HIS BIG
SUIT ON HIS DREDGER
ALL INTRINGERS MUST PAY
THE INVENTOR DAMAGES.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
Issues an Injunction and Or
ders an Accounting for
Damages.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday rendered an opinion in the case
of Alphonzo B. Bowers against the San
Francisco Bridge Company. The decis
ion is in favor of Bowers and enjoins the
defendant, and indirectly all others, from
using the dredgers of the Schwartzkopff
patent or any other patent using the Bow
ers idea in hydraulic dredgers.
The original bill was tiled on March 21,
1803 for infringement of Bowers' letters
patent, the first dated May 26, 18S5. The
later letters patent were on a dredging
machine, and are dated May 31. 1887; June
7 1887; November S, ISS7, and October 18,
1892 Bowers in the bill alleged that prior
to December, 1878, he was the first and
original inventor of certain new Inven
tions In dredging. In IXSS English letters
patent were issued to Mr. Schwartzkopff
for an improved dredger.
In rendering his decision Judge Morrow
said that the improved combinations of
Bowers' invention rendered dredging so
expeditious and superior over former
methods and devices that he is entitled
in the patent law to the position of "pio
neer In the art of dredging" unless it be
clearly established by the defendant that
the Schwartzkopff patent of 18.>f. compre
hended the same idea^ and was so far de
veloped at that time that it was to aJI
intents and purposes or could have been
made by mere mechanical skill a practi
cal and'successful invention.
"Another feature of the case, continued
Judge Morrow, "bearing upon the
Schwartzkopff patent which militates, in
my judgment, against the practical utility
of that invention is that it does not ap
pear ever to have been used. While a
failure to put an invention to use may not
be conclusive evidence of its inutility, still
it is a circumstance to be considered as
against the practical utility of a machine.
Having determined that the Schwartz
kopff patent does not anticipate the Bow
ers Inventions and that none of the other
letters patent introduced by the defendant
anticipate the Bowers patents, the conclu
sion logically follows that Bowers, upon
the evidence presented in this case, has
sustained his claim as the pioneer inven
tor in the art of dredging and that he Is
entitled to a broad and liberal interpreta
tion in the construction of his claims. He
is therefore entitled to treat as infringers
all who employ substantially the same
means to accomplish the same results,
notwithstanding that the subsequent ma
chine may contain and does contain im
provements In separate mechanisms
which go to make up the machine. The
machine of the defendant does infringe."
The court thereupon issued a perpetual
injunction against the defendants and
issued an order for an accounting for
damages sustained by Bowers by the use
of the Schwartzkopff machine by the de
fendants.
A similar opinion was rendered in a

WATLER ROSSER'S DEFENSE.
Many Witnesses Testify on Behalf of
the Accused Soldier.
The defense of Walter Rosser. who on
September 13, shot and killed Henry Hil
debrand In the Spreekels Market opened
yesterday. Many witnesses testified that
the prisoner was apparently suffering
from the effects of some unknown drug
on the day of the murder and others gave
evidence that the defendant had always
borne a good reputation prior to the com
mission of the crime. Depositions to
strengthen the latter fact were also read
to the Jury. Among those who testified
for the defense yesterday were: A Cas-
M. W. Butler. Samuel C. Hammond.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.â Stocks made very ma
terial progress to-day in the present upward
movement, and left off buoyant with advances
In Standard stock ranging from 1 to 3 points,
while this rise was exceeded In many less
prominent issues, notably Pullman, Third
avenue and Edison Illuminating. The transac
tions for the day in stocks and bonds were
of an enormous scale, immense blocks of se
curities changing handÂ«Â» at rising figures,
Karly Quotations were in strong sympathy
with London, where there was a scramble for
stocks even after the closing there for the
new account, which opens to-morrow. Com
mission bouses were in receipt of many orders
to buy at the market rate, and the volume of
business offset frequent efforts to depress val
ues. Ueporu of truffle earnings for the first
week in December were almost uniformly
favorable, as were several belated November
statements of gross earnings. An incident ex
erting favorable effect was the receipt of over
J3,0Gu,000 in cold from France and London.
The immense demand for bonds, In which the
transactions reached over {$,000,000, exerted a
favorable influence in stocks, as did a ten
dency to discount January dividend disburse
ments. Atehlson preferred, on transactions of
150.000 shares, went up 3%. The heavy pur
chases were made by brokers identified with
prominent Interests active in other properties.
The drift of speculative activity in the grang
ers was interpreted favorably. High-priced In
vestment stocks like the grangers, Great North
ern preferred. New Haven and Hartford and
Albany and Susquehonna, rose sharply. Ex
cepting sugar, the industrials tended upward.
New York Central's prices crossed those of
Pennsylvania, The coalers on favorable trade
outlook were conspicuous for advances. Genera
Electric responded to reports of sales of itÂ«
product abroad. The Pacifies were strong with
the rest of the market. Northern Pacific over
coming the early heaviness due to the reports
thai t lie- company favored extensions into Ore
gon Navigation Company territory.
The marKet for bonds was one of the strong
est and most active of the year, there being
many advances of a point or more. A renewal
nf reign buying on a considerable scale was
noticeable. Atchison issues expanded, and a
great many other noteworthy gains were
chronicled in leading mortgages. Total sales
$8,460,0(10. United Slates new fours, the old
fours coupon and the fives registered advanced
J n in the bid price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 12.â It looked at the etart
as If wheat was to be another bull market.
The worlds shipment figures were very en
couraging to buyers, showing a total of but
8,500,000 bushels, as against 9,844,000 bushels
last year.
Of this amount 6,870,000 bushels were shipped
from this side. The feature which attracted
the most attention, however, was the re
markably small Russian shipmentsâ only 516,
000 bushels. This fact, coupled with the re
ports of scarcity in some provinces of Russia,
suggested a possible dropping out of that coun
try as a competitor of America for the pres
ent, at least, and gave a good deal of stiffness
to the early trading. Liverpool also showed
firmness, VS^sd advance being chronicled In
that market. May started a .shade higher at
6i',i'ff6o%c. There was quite a good demand
at those figures, both from shorts and from the
general crowd, the result being an immediate
advance to 65% c. The demand was soon satis
fied, and for a short time the market was ex
tremely dull, though steady. Then it turned
weak, and remained in that condition until
shortly before the close, only the narrowness
of trading preventing a more serious decline
than occurred. Private London cablegrams
saying that Russian offerings were Increasing
was the first wave that struck the sand house
of the bulls. Soon after this the figures on the
world's visible were posted. They showed
an Increase of 2,623,000 bushels, an amount so
far beyond even what the most pessimistic
bear had expected that all the wheat bought
during the early trading, and considerably more
besides, was dumped on to the market. Before
the liquidation ceased May had . dropped . to
65c, and even nt that price there was very lit
tle biddlnz for some time. Near the close
covering by shorts gave a little strength to
the market, and caused the May price to re
cover to 65^W65'/i. where It closed.
Corn, though very dull, was comparatively
firm. The decline in wheat acted as a drag
on the market for a time, but toward the close
the demand became better, and prices advanced
slightly, the market holding firm to the end.
May closed ',Â£ higher. i
Oats were even duller than corn. Trading
was very narrow all day. and chiefly of a
scalping nature. The market in a general way
followed corn, and ruled rather firm through
out at a slight advance. May closed V6@K
higher. -
Provisions were firm from the start. Com
mission houses were well supplied with buy-
Ing orders, and the local crowd was decidedly
bullish on the belief that a bull campaign was
on. Packers sold sparingly, notwithstanding
large hog receipts. The market closed firm at
about top figuresâ May pork 15c higher. May
lard 12'4c higher, and May ribs 7V4@loc higher.

drained by the Pumping Association. The 1750
level station has been repaired. The floor of
the station being entirely rotten a new floor
has been put in and the station made ready to
receive the switch plates and track when re
quired All of this work has been done on
Con Cal. and Va. account by the Pumping As
sociation The pump engine has been over
hauled for use in stripping the pump compart
ment of the C. and C. shaft of the old wire
transmission plant and preparing it to receive
the hydraulic pipe for the new pumping plant.
All of this work has been done by the Com
stock Pumping Association.
In the Ophlr and Mexican mines the Central
tunnel has been cleaned out for a distance of
thirty feet north and 200 feet west of the
Mexican shaft. A crosscut has been driven
easterly from the drift north of the winze on
the Central tunnel level, the location of this
crosscut being 170 feet north and 200 feet west
erly from the Mexican shaft. This crosscut
has been run in the expectation of finding an
ore streak that is believed to exist to the east
of the starting point. The ground is in bad
' condition and will require extensive repairs,
but they expect to reach thÂ« ore before mak
ing the necessary repairs that fnay be re-
quired be-fore extracting ore or moving waste
from this point. A party of three miners is
extracting a little ore from a point 145 feet
west of the Mexican shaft on the north aide of
the drift and fifty-five feet east of the winze
station.
In the Sierra Nevada mine, the northwest
drift from the station at the 140-foot level of
the shaft was advanced twenty feet, making 1
a total of 473 feet: face in porphyry and clay
with eeams of soft quartz through it. Most
of the week has been occupied in easing tlm
l>ers and repairing the drift. 900-foot levelâ
The station at the top of the raise, eighty feet
above this level, has been completed. The
north drift started from the top of the raise,
eighty feet above this level, was advanced ten
feet: total length twenty-two feet; face in por
phyry.
In the chollar and Potosl mines, they are
making some necessary repairs to the shaft
station on the tunnel level, which will take
severat days to complete.
In the Occidental Consolidated mine, accord
ing to the official report of Superintendent A.
T. Eager, the work of prospecting the ore body
on the 4M)-foot level was continued during the
past week. The north drift was extended eight
feet with quartz of the same value and char
acter as at the south end of the chute. 550
foot levelâ work has been commenced drifting
on the footwall north to encounter the ore body
found on the 450.

BETRAYED HIS
CONFIOENCE
The Many Woes of
George McHenry.
SUES FOR HIS PROPERTY
MAKES COMPLAINT THAT HE
WAS SWINDLED.
When Informed That a Blackmail
Suit Was to Be Filed Against
Him He Deeded Away
Valuaule Real Estate.
If all the allegations contained In an
amended complaint filed yesterday are
true the woes of aged George McHenry
are many, and his daughter's misdeeds
have filled his cup of sorrow to the brim.
Not long ago McHenry filed a complaint
In which his daughter, Mary McHenry,
appeared as defendant, to recover prop
erty situated in this city and Monterey
County, valued at upward of $30,000. In
the original complaint McHenry made no
sensational allegations, simply stating
that he had transferred title to his daugh
ter without consideration and for cer
tain reasons, Just intimating that It was
done to prevent a recovery by Mary
Burns, a stepdaughter, who was about to
commence suit against him, but on what
grounds he did not state. As he had re
ceived no consideration for the property
he asked that it again be placed in his
hands and that the deeda held by his
daughter be declared null and void.
In the amended complaint filed yes
terday McHenry avers that he was lied
to, deceived and swindled by his daugh
ter, who influenced him to transfer the
property by stating that suit about to be
brought against him by Mary Burns
was without merit and was simply a
blackmailing scheme to deprive him of
his property.
The story told by McHenry in the
amended complaint is a sad one.
On September 4, 1897, states the plain
tiff, he was a man past the prime of lffe,
much enfeebled in mind and body. In this
condition he sought the comfort, aid and
companionship and advice of his daugh
ter. She came to live with him from a
convent, representing that she was in
miserable health and that she had been
granted a leave of absence for one year
in which t" recuperate. By reason of
their mutual condition there arose in the
mind of the aged father great feelings of
trust and love for his daughter, and to
her McHenry confided his business mat
ters and sought, received and acted upon
her advice. They were happy together
for a time, but on the day mentioned, the
plaintiff alleges, his daughter, with the
intent to mislead and deceive him, and
well knowing that her statements were
false and untrue, representted that Mary
Burns intended to sue him for slander;
that the action would be simply black
mail, but that against false testimony he
would be powerless. A judgment would
l)<Â» obtained against him, and it was his
duty to save what he had. Acting on
advice he transferred the property
to his daughter. She would hold it in
trust, she said, until the day he again
ted it back. Thp day came when he
again sought the title to his property,
but his daughter refused to reconvey It.
Th^n he sought the courts.
The agreement by which the -Tinerty
waa transferred shows that in considera-
I" the transfer and placing of title
!n her name Miss McHenry was to pay
her father out of the rents and profits
the sum of $50 a month. This considera
tion, the aged plaintiff avers, was not
th<Â» true or real agreement, but in truth
and fact the deeds were wholly without
consideration, and the real agreement
was that the defendant should be vested
with the legal title of the property until
such time as he might again demand it.
McHenry states that he is now depend
ent upon the charity of friends, having
do means, and being so feeble ...at he
cannot earn a livelihood. In conclu
sion he prays that the property be, by
<jn!er of court, reconveyed to him, and
that his daughter be compelled to ac
count for the moneys received by her, the
income from the property.
A SAILOR KILLED BY A FALL.
One of the Spars of the Narwhal Gives
Way With Serious Results.
While overhauling the rigging of the
lark Narwhal at the Arctic Oil AVorks.
fff Kentucky street, yesterday morning,
one of the spars upon which two sailors
named Henry Olsen and John Kimmls
wÂ»re ai work broke, throwing the men to
the deck, a distance of sixty feet. When
picked up both were unconscious and se
verely injured. They were conveyed to the
City ar.d County Hospital, where Kim
mis di<Ml from the effects of his injuries
nt half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Olsen's injuries were not so severe, and
although badly injured he will recover.
Both his legs were broken by the fall.
The bark arrived here from the Arctic
Ocean a few weeks ago. She had been
absent two years, and as a consequence
her rigging was subjected to much wear
and tear, and the masts and spars, on ar
rival here, needed replacing. It was the
Intention to thoroughly overhaul them.
Instructions were given the hospital au
thorities to do everything in their power
for the comfort of the injured man.
Says He Swindled Her.
E. M. Barker was arrested last night
(â 'Ti a warrant fr - olice Court 1 charg
ing him with obtaining money by false
pretenses. The complaining witness is
Martha Romer. She claimed that Barker
induced her to buy out his interest in a
I akery at 191(5 T'nion street for $200. He
represented that the business as on a
paying basis, but as Mrs. Romer learned
otherwise after parting with her money
Fhe concluded she had been swindled and
swore out a warrant for Barker's arrest.

FOOT THE BILL
Railroad Must Build
Its Own Tunnel.
BUT SUPERVISORS OBJECT
DODGE KILLS PHELAN'S VETO
AND GETS HIS FENCE.
Rottanzi Wanted the Board to Pay
His Attorney's Bill â Mayor's
Veto on the Gas Bill
Overruled.
A strong effort was made yesterday to I
have the Board of Supervisors give
I further consideration to the resolution pro
| viding that $24,450 shall be spent in the
] building of a concrete tunnel under the
i Southern Pacific Company's embankment,
on Bosworth street. It was rendered
abortive by the opposition of Supervisor
Britt, but as It still has to go through
the hands of the Mayor the opponents of
â  the measure have some hope of its being
â¢ brought again regularly before the board
I through the veto that it is said that Mr.
j Phelan intends to adorn it with. The fact
j has developed since the matter has been
[ given publicity that the proposed tunnel
is nothing more nor less than a proposi
i tion to save the money to the Southern i
Pacific that it would otherwise itself have I
to spend in order to gel its electric road
an entrance at the Zoo Park.
When it was again called to the atten
tion of the board yesterday Supervisor
Clinton, as the representative of that dis
trict, spoke in strongest terms against the
city spending the $24,000 that is proposed.
Said he. "1 have never asked that the tun
nel be built in that district, and if the city
is obliged to pay tor it i never shall, lor |
It is solely to benefit the Southern Pacific j
Company and the company should pay for
i it. There is no mure reason why we
! should let go of this money for this tunnel
than there was for us building the trestle
i bridges that the company built for its
; railroad In that section Home years ago.
' They wanted the city to build the bridges
: at that time because they crossed above
; the streets, but the Supervisors took
i proper action and the road was obliged to
provide its own improvements. The first ;
i step toward making them do the same in !
I this case is really already taken. The i
I embankment througrh which it is proposed
to tunnel was declared a public nuisance ;
by the Board of Health years ago. and i
- could be condemned now. 1 move for a i
Britt got up to say that it was too late
to ask lor a reconsideration, and he also
argued that the improvement recom
mended would be a benefit to .the prop
erty-owners In the Berkshire and Bos
worth street districts. Other opposition
met Dr. Clinton's motion, and he finally
withdrew it, saying that the Mayor had
yet to consider it and his veto would
bring it again regularly before the board.
Assessor Dodge's . can.paign portraits
also came in for their mead of attention
arid by almost a unanimous vote of the
board, Rottanzi voting no, the Assessor
elect was permitted to overrule the
or's veto on that Valencia street fence
lesolution and by doing so project glad
n.-ss into the heart of the ad-fence graft
er Mr Dodge gracefully apolugized to
Mr. Phelan for giving him the ax, but
at the same time explained that it was
necessary in order that Justice might be
done. Justice was forthwith done and
its beneficiaries will proceed to adorn
the corner of Valencia, Herrman and
Market streets with another 15-foot fence
of vari-colored ads.
Two claims for legal services rendered
Supervisors Kottanzi a<ad L*ckmann per
sonally took the attention of the board
for a few moments and certain circum
stances were explained away by the cap
tain only after something considerable in
the way of a blush and a more or less
embarrassed statement. The accounts
were those of P. C. Costello and McOow
an and Squires and were for services ren
dered the two Supervisors during the re
cent unpleasantness when Mayor Phelan
tried to unseat the whole board. Clerk
Russell was reading the report of the
Finance Committee and among other
i lalms audited read off those of l^ack
mann and Rottanzi. Objections were
raised from every chair in the room and
Sheehan demanded to know how they
came on the report. The Finance Com
mittse denir-d that it had audited them
and the Mayor lent his dpmand for an
explanation to the rest. Mr. Russell said
he had written them in upon instructions
from Supervisor Rottanzi, and when
questioned that gentleman admitted that
he had done his own auditing. ThÂ«
claims were promptly killed and the re
port referred back to the committee.
The contract to furnish the Hall of Jus
tice, which was awnnU-i] by the Building
Committee to the Fuller Dosk Company
for $77,990, was ratified by the hoard.

as there were some mistakes that had to
be rectified before positive action could
be taken.
Permission was granted to the Hahne
mann Hospital College to build a two
story frame building at the corner of Sac
ramento and Maple streets. The build
ing is to be used as a medical college,
and the directors agree to submit the
proposed plans to the Fire Department
for its approval.
A special committee of six will be ap
pointed by the Mayor to act In conjunc
tion with the Board of Health to exam
ine the plans and specifications submitted
to the hoard for the erection of a new
hospital, In order that tho board may be
enabled to pay the sums of SITiOO. $1000. $750

A FINANCIAL STATEMENT
As Prepared by Samuel L. Waller It Indicates the Deficit Will
Be Over One Hundred Thousand Dollars Less Than
Grand Jury Expert Estimates.
The members of the Board of Education have had prepared a statement of
the financial Etanfiing of the School Department In order to controvert the claims
of persons who charge them with extravagance. Mr. Kilpatrick, the Grand Jury'B
expert, estimates the deficit at the end of the forthcoming fiscal year to be
between $275,000 and $283,000. Director Head believes it will be between $250,000 and
$300,000.
The report prepared by Director Samuel Waller from the Auditor's figures,
with estimated expenses for November and December, shows the outside deficit
to be $160,000 and probably less, owing to extra receipts from State school fund.

selves.
Another real hero has returned to hi 3
native soil. This time it is Captain Frank
Wildes of the Boston, who commanded
the T". S. S. Boston at the battle of Ma
nila. He arrived on the City of Peking,
having left Manila on October 4. He will
leave this week for his home in the
"Hub" city, having been ordered back to
the United States for three years' land
service, his cruise of a similar length of
time being completed. Captain Wildes is
short of stature but compactly built. His
complexion Is swarthy, and shows that he
CAPTAIN FRANK WILDES.
has long been exposed to the rays of a
tropical sun. His hair is iron gray and
he wears a mustache of the same color.
Captain Wildes is very modest. He Is
agreeable and easily approached, but is
loth to talk of what he did that morning
in Manila Bay. When asked to give his
version of the battle he only smiled, and,
fixing a determined pair of gray eyes on
the reporter, he said:
"The account of the battle has been
threshed out as thoroughly as we
thrashed the Spaniards, and there is
nothing I can tell you that has not al
ready been told, except"â and here the
smile left his face and a thoughtful ex
pression came over his countenance â
"that the sailors who fought under
Dewey were as brave a set of Anglo-
Saxons as ever defended the honor of our
flag.
"The Boston was struck six times during
tho engagement and was on fire twice;
but that was a mere trifle, and we did
not mind it, but kept right up with the
procession."
Speaking of the admiral under whom
he fought. Captain Wildes said: "Admi
ral Dewey holds the key to the situation
in Manila if any man can be eald to hoid
It."
The captain we'd not express himself
regarding the holding of the islands by
the United States, except to say chat our
people could live there as we'll as the
people of any other nation, provided they
took the proper re of themselves, and
h" also stated that on the whole, consid
ering the number of soldiers there are in
Manila, the health of the Eighth Army
Corps is good.
Regarding the condition of the Ameri
can fleet at Manila Captain Wildes de
clares that the men and officers are in ex
cellent health, and that tliey are keeping
ward and watch over the interests and
honor of Uncle Sam with a jealous eye,
and that if there should be any attempt
on the part of any other nation to tam
per with it some one will be called to a
Quick and sharp account.
Captain Wildes is a graduate of the
Naval Academy, and is 55 years of age.
He entered the academy in 1563 and grad
uated threo years later. Captain Wildes
has the reputation of being one of the
most efficient as well as bravest officers
in the navy, and he has behind him a
record of thirty years' service of which
ho may feel justly proud. He reports a
rough voyage coming up from Manila.
Captain Wildes Is anxious to get home
to nls family in time for Christmas, not
having seen them for three years.
QUIET NIGHT
AT THE PLAY
Orpheum Hit by a
Unique Monologist.
"A Parlor Match" Arrives
Too Late to Be Lighted.
George Fuller Golden is the opulent
name of a young gentleman who ap
peared at the Orpheum last night in
black frock coat costume of rural cut and
by what Is known in vaudevillese as a
"monologue act" held the stage for some
thing like forty minutes.
In the fleet world of vaudeville two
thirds of an hour is almost a lifetime,
but Mr. Golden gilded every minute of
it and the audience kept up a steady ac
companiment of applause and laughter.
Mr. Golden has the "monologue" temper
ament in its superlative. He is easy,
colloquial, confidential and unobtrusively
good-natured â so much so that you for
get he is working. He is full of the local
allusion and idioms of the hour and he
surprises you at least fifty times in the
forty minutes. No man can face the cal
cium single-handed for this length of
time and not joke jokes that have been
Joked before, and it is only fair to an
tiquity to say that several of Mr. Gold
en's stories are not making their first ap
pearance on any stag*; but, old or new
he has the manner of telling them that
grips the crowd. It is his personality and
the side flashes of variety humor that
wins, even more than the stories them
selves. And then he has prodigious tal
ent for parody and satire which he turns
to convulsing account in hitting off the
traditions and fakes of the "purfesh;"
and he has a pair of legs so versatile in
expression that by merely changing steps
he presents any variety of recognized
types and characters. Not since Lew
Dockstadter has the Orpheum had bo
clever a monologlst.
Another hit was Julius P. Witmark
dear in the memory of old-time minstrel
patrons as the "boy barytone." Julius is
getting a big boy now, But his voice Is
as sympathetic and true and as free from
overtraining as in the old days with
Billy Emerson, and he still sings the
swooningly sentimental ballad of the
minstrel show; and sings as only few do
to-day.
Three supple young sisters by the name
of Merkell do picturesque tumbling and
contorting, and Frank La Mondue jokes
dangerously on a slack wire. The only
one of the new turns not up to the nov
elty mark ia danced and sung by Miss
Violet Dale. Camilla Urso la stU the
dignified feature of the bill, and the
Batty bears in their educated captivity
continue to prove that man is the king
of brutes.
Columbia.
The many hundreds of theater-goers
who went to the Columbia Theater last
evening with the expectation of an even
ing's enjoyment were unavoidably dis
appointed, owing to the late arrival of the
"Parlor Match" company. Instead of ar
riving early in the day, the train was de
layed about twelve hours, and even the
efforts of the management to bring the
company in on a special train proved of
no avail, and it was decided to postpone
the opening until this evening.
California.
Daniel Sully, in "Uncle Bob," attracted
another numerous audience to the Cali
fornia laat night.
New Comedy.
Harry Martell's "South Before the
War" company, with its host of clever
colored entertainers, is on this week at
the New Comedy. The bill is in the na
ture of vaudeville. Animated pictures of
the "Passion Play," representing Biblical
narratives as enacted by the devout
peasantry of Hoi iz, Austria, are first
shown. Then comes the little comedy
drama, "South Before the War." The '
piece is a pathetic little creation, inter- ;
spersed by the natural humor of the
colored actors. Miss Sarah Price, a gifted
linger, rendered "Old Kentucky Home,"
and Flora Batson and Gerard Millar en- I
tertained the audience with operatic se
lections. A cake walk, an entertainment
characteristic of the colored race, con
cluded a taking performance.
Grand Opera-House.
A comedy-drama, "The Temptation of
Money," was presented at the Grand
Opera House last night, and it went with
a snap. There is not much of a plot, but
the specialties introduced are clever and
brought down the house. Edward O'Con
nor, a comedian from the East, made his
first appearance and a hit. He sings and
dances well and plays his part with a fine
sense of humor. Marie Winaon, the clever
soubrette, takes a prominent part in the
play in tracking the villain. Landers
Stevens, and introduces several special
ties. Anna Goodwin, a pleasing vocalist,
has been specially engaged for this week.
Fred J. Butler as a colored gentleman
met with a cordial reception, and his
songs created the greatest enthusiasm.
James M. Brophy, Julia Blanc, Lorena
Atwood and Maud Miller sustained their
parts well. The house was crowded.
Alcazar.
"Alabama," that beautiful and homelike
picture of southern life, with the humor
ous eide broadly illuminatea, like a good
Btory can never be told often enough.
This was proved last night in the flatter
ingly larger and appreciative audience at
the Alcazar. Clarence Montaine was an
excellent Colonel Moberly and George
Osbourne was at his best as Colonel
Preston. Ernest Hastings played the part
of ' Captain Davenport easily â norhaps a
little too easily, and Gretchen I,yons was
as winsome as ever as Carry Preston.
She didn't giggle even once. Charles
Bryant's Decatur and Frank Bacon's
Squire Tucker were clever bits of char
acter acting.
The Tivoli.
"The Mascot," an old Tivoll favorite,
drew a crowded audience to that pleasure
resort last night. The opera was sung
and played In first-class style, and the
principals were called before the curtain
on several occasons. The choruses were
excellent and the orcheetra all that could
be desired. Next week the Tivoli pre
sents its Christmas spectacle, "The Yel
low Dwarf."
Olympia.
Conchlta, who is already well known to
theater-goes in this city, made a great
hit at the Olympia Music Hall last night.
She was recalled lour times.
The Chutes.
.Teonette Lilford appeared at the Chutes
Theater last evening, and her songs and
changes were warmly applauded. The
Marco brothers are clever contortionists;
the Stanleys, in "Mrs. O'Grady's Wash
Day," are funny, and Kelly and Violette,
sketch artists, have new songs and cake
wylks.

JOHN M. HATTON.
Mrs. John M. Hatton, a lady residing
in Lebanon, 0., used the remedy as de-
scribed above and her experience told in
her own words will quite likely interest
all women deeply. Airs. Hatton says:
"Yes. I used Golden Specific without my
husband's knowledge and completely
cured him.
"He was a hard drinker, a good man
when sober, but for years I lived In fear
and dread, shame and despair, poverty
and disgrace. How shall I tell other wo-
men about It? Is it not a wonderful thing
that a woman can take mattersin herown
hands and stamp out this dreadful curse
to the home? I am glad you are going to
publish my experience, for then I know It
will reach hundreds of other poor souls
and they will cure their husbands lust as
I cured mine. I am so grateful for the
marvelous changes that have come into
my life that I just feel like I would do
anything to let every wife and mother
know wnat a blessing Golden Specific Ib.

ago after he was cured. I honestly believe
it will cure any drunkard no matter how

DEATH WAS
SURELY DUE
TO MURDER
Lillian Brandes Was
Hanged, Dying.
DR. BUTEAU'S TESTIMONY
THE GIRL COULD NOT HAVE
COMMITTED SUICIDE.
JEven if Not Dead When Hanged, She
Was too Weak to Have Tied
the Apron Around
Her Neck.
LINKS IN THE CHAIN ALREADY WOVEN AROUND W. A. BRANDES.
He frequently beat his daughter Lillian most mercilessly.
He was frequently heard to threaten her.
On the night before she was found dead he beat her several times
with something other than his hand.
The girl did not hang herself, but the apron was twisted around
her neck either while she was dying or after she was dead.
Dr. Buteau has testified that the condition of the girl's heart at
the time of death was such that she had not strength to have sus
pended herself to the bedpost, even if she were not dead at the time.
Lillian was not c disobedient girl, and no one but Brandes ever
accused her of theft.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Dec 12.
Dr. Buteau caused William A. Brandes
to wince in Justice Cliffs court this after
noon. Dr. Buteau held an autopsy on
â¢the murdered girl and made a detailed
and scientific examination of even' mark
on her body and of her various organs.
He was prepared to tell the court from
a scientific standpoint what caused the
girl's death. Hia story differed very ma
terially from the newspaper Interviews
of Brandes and his wife.
Attorney J. E. Bennett, who is of coun
sel for Brandes, has evidently read some
surgical works, for he showed a knowl
edge of anatomy and causes of death not
ordinarily possessed bj attorneys. In
some Instances Dr. Buteau stated that he
did not understand Attorney Bennett's
questions, but after mutually Btralghten
lng out Intricate queries the examination
proceeded. The witness did not agree
â with the attorney on many important j
t)ointÂ« and on the whole the testimony
was very damaging to the prisoner.
Dr Buteau described the condition of
â¢the girl's throat and of the marks around ;
her neck. He referred to the connection
between the action of the heart at the i
time of death and the appearance of the
blood around the throat where the apron
was tied In reply to a question as to â 
whether or not the apron was tied around
the neck before death while the girl was
dying or after death. Dr. Buteau replied
that It was either tied while the girl was
.King or after she was dead. This was
followed by some Questions regarding the
difference between general weakneqÂ«and
weakn Us caused by the approach of
,7< â 'h The witness stated that it would
I! been impossible for Lillian to have ,
possessed sufficient strength, as shown
Tv her heart, to have suspended herself
from the bed. and consequently he was
rielinitelv <>f I V opinion thai the gin
!3l hive taken no active part what
ever in the hanging process. .
Brandes did not personally appro\e of
some of Dr. Buteau's testimony, and he
made suggestions to his attorneys that
brought out some questions as to whether
there be an infallible rule by which doc
tors can tell whether certain dlscolora
tions an> the result of ante-mortem or
SoVt-mortem blows. The witness said that
In certain Instances there could be no mis
take made by an expert surgeon, lie said
that if any one twisted a rope or any
thing else around the neck while living
and while the heart was beating nor
mally and death should ensue there
â would certainly be a blue edge to the fur
row mad-- in the net k. and In this instance
there was nothing resembling such a blue
edge l>r Buteau said that the body of
Lillian Brandes was of normal weight and
height for a girl of 13 years.
A man named Heaton was ejected from
thY courtroom this afternoon because of
hi? demonstrations of glee whenever any
evidence was adduced particularly unfa
vorable to Brandes. Ueaton expressed
his approval of such points by clapping
his hands and saying to himself: "That's
eood- that's pood." He did this many
times, but when Dr. Buteau testified that
It was practically impossible for the girl
to have banged herself Mr. Heaton waved
his hat and called down the wrath of the
court.
"Mr Constable, please put that man
out." saiil Justice Cllft. "lie has been
very demonstrative all the afternoon and
the court will stand it no longer."
As the Constable pointed the way to the
door Mr. Heaton walked out.
There were fully a dozen ladles In court
this afternoon, but Brandes paid no at
tention to them, seemingly being anxious
to avoid being gazed upon. There were a
few sighs of sympathy for Lillian from the
bench where the ladies sat. during Dr.
Buteau's testimony, but none of .It was
sufficiently noticeable to attract the at
tention of the court.
MUNICIPAL LEAGUE
OPENS THE CAMPAIGN
IT WILL BROADEN THE SCOPE
OF ITS WORK.
Candidates Will Be Indorsed Irre
spective of Party and Looking
Toward General Public
Improvements.
OAKLAND. Dec. 12.â The municipal
campaign opened to-night with a meeting
of the Municipal League, and the ball of
politics may now be Raid to be again roll
ing, after its brief respite.
The league was comparatively inactive
two years ago, but this year It has al
ready decided to put a complete ticket
In the field for the spring election and to
nominate in advance of all other parties.
The proceedings to-night plainly show the
policy the league will adopt, and it pre
sents a marked contrast to that of former
years. The meeting was attended by
about 100 of the most prominent men in
the city, including Giles H. Gray, Council
men Cuvellier and Upton, ex-Councilmen
J. F. Towle, F. Mott. J. W. Nelson, W. K.
llarnard and W. O. Buckland, Messrs. C.
AY. Kinsey, A. B. Nye, F. L. Button, Cary
Howard. J. L. Lyon, J. T. Bell. William
Moller. Professor Inskeep, Judge Havens,
J. T. Warner. A. B. Nye in a compre
hensive speech presented the views that
will be adopted by the league, with per
haps a few slight changes.
He briefly scanned the history of the
organization and said that hitherto its
mission had been entirely confined to the
moral side of local government and it had
finished its work when it had caused hon
est men to be elected to office. It is now-
Intended that the league shall broaden its
scope and that it shall take a stajid in
behalf of public improvement "Two
years ago." said Mr. Nye, "the * al
most made what would haw
fatal mistake of pronouncing
purchase of land for public
City should have places that
fesidents here and it should J*vT tr* a
4C Uie league to see that I * w ''â¢>-..
1
longer Reserves the reports that have
gone abroad that she is lacking in pub
lic spirit and enterprise." It was decid
ed that the policy of Indorsing names on
other tickets does not produce the de
sired effect. Giles H. Gray said that this
is not to affect good men now holding
office, as the league is ready to nominate
any who may have proved faithful to
their trust. . -.
Mr Xye struck the keynote of the rea
son for Oakland's lack of progress when
he said that this is a sectional city and
that nobody cared for anything that he
could not see from his own doorstep. He
deprecated there being an p:ast, a West
and a North Oakland, and *aid the pur
pose of the league should be to unite all.
Formerly no member could be elected to
membership within ninety days of the
election, but this was altered to make it
forty-five days.
The league will meet in a larger hall
next Tuesday night and a new executive
committee of nineteen will be chosen.
NINE HORSES BURNED.
Damaging Fire at Elmhurst Yester
day Afternoon.
OAKLAND, Dec. 12.â A fire started in
the Kerwin property on Jones avenue
and the broadgauge tracks at Elmhurst
about noon to-day while the hired hands
were at dinner, and resulted in destroying
2f>o tons of hay and nine head of horses.
The place is owned by the estate of the
late John Kerwin, who was killed by a
Haywards electric car about two years
ago and was conducted by his brother
Michael. The origin of the fire is un
known. The blaze was not extinguished
until late this evening.
The total loss Is estimated at from $5000
to JSOuo, which includes horses, hay.
wagons and the barn, a massive structure
standing alone a considerable distance
from the main buildings.
THE BRAHMSTEAD DIVORCE.
Suit That Recalls Some Experiences
of the Plaintiff Over in Oakland.
OAKLAND, Dec. 12.â The divorce suit
begun by Mrs. Alice Edith yon Brahm
stead. formerly Alice Edith Dieka
son, in San Francisco recalls some recent
experiences of the fair plaintiff in this
city, wher^ she was placed by her at
torney to get away from her husband.
She stopped at a lodging-house at
Eleventh and Franklin streets, and here
her husband found her. On one occasion
he caused her arrest oh the charge of :
drunkenness, and almost as soon as he
had her lodged behind the bars he wanted '
to have her released. By means of an |
order from her he raised the necessary i
money from the agent of the Blythe es
tate, from which it is said she receives
a regular allowance of about $2Â£>o a month.
After Yon Brahmstead had put up the
money he wanted to have the charges he
had placed against his wife dismissed, i
However, Chief Fletcher came to the con
clusion that the man was simply working I
a game to get the bail money for his own
use. and so the charges were not dis
missed. The bail was forfeited, owing to
her non-appearance.
MRS. DAVID ALTVATER
WINS HER FIRST POINT
REMARKABLE TESTIMONY BY
WILLIAM J. PHELAN.
The Advice Which He Declares Was
Given Him by His Attorney,
George W. Jaon
teith.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
S*>b Brondway, Dec. 12.
The first important victory In the con
test over the administration on the es
tate of the late David Altvater, who waa
killed in a mill in San Francisco several
months ago. was won fhis afternoon by
thf> widow.
The widow, Mrs. Agnes Altvater, had
petitioned for letters of administration, as
did also David Altvater, a son of the
deceased. The first named petitioner was
the second wife of deceased, and, judg
ing from the testimony adduced at the
hearing of the matter before Judge Ells
worth, they lived together in anything
but harmony.
Mrs. Altvater in her petition valued the
estate at $1500, but since then $1400 has
been deposited in the German Savings
Hank of Han Francisco by the Knights
of Pythias for me support of the chil
<lr<!i.
On the other hand David Altvater con
tended that there was a will left by nls
father, and in this opinion he was sup
ported by Mrs. William J. Pheian.
whose husband claims kinship to the
Mayor of San Francisco. Incidentally tne
contestants value the estate at $4700.
Pheian gave some remarkable testimony
to-day. He said that his attorney, G. w
Monteith, had advised him and David Alt
vater to induce Mrs. Altvater to visit
and nurse his (Phelan'si wife, and that in
the meantime the contestants snould so
to Mrs. Altvater's home on Benton street,
Alameda. and search for the will- that
they did this, but found no will, and nar
rowly escaped trouble when this clandes
tine visit was made known to the widow.
Phelan's hatred for and the contempt
in which he apparently holds his step
mother-in-law amounted very nearly to
contempt of court, for while the widow
was testifying he constantly made "mon
key shines" and "faces" at her, until
Bailiff Smith was compelled to call a halt'
and as Mrs. Altvater left the witness
stand Pheian protruded one of his legs
so far across the path that led to the
widows chair that she was almost
tripped.
Fortunately for him Judge Ellsworth did
not have his attention arrested by these
actions. However, he issued letters of ad
ministration to the widow and allowed
her $50 per month out of the estate for tne
support of the three minor children.
SOME APPOINTMENTS.

OAKLAND, Dec. 12.â The resignation of

STRANGE DEATH
OF H. SUKEFORTH,
A U. C STUDENT
Found Dead in *Bed
Yesterday.
CAUSE SAID TO BE POISON
MYSTERY CLOUDS THE WHOLE
AFFAIR.
A Member of the State University-
Expires Suddenly After a
Hard Night's
Study.
BERKELEY. Dec. 12â Harold C. Suke
forth, a student in the University of Cal
fo nia, was found dead in his bed this
morning about 8 o'clock. While the cause
oT death is not known for a certainty,
the physicians conducting the autopsy
find evidences pointing conclusively to
poison. The circumstances surrounding
the case, however, cloud It as yet with
mystery.
The young man was a little over 20
years of age. He had already reached his
third year at the university, being regis
tered in the College of Social Sciences.
His home is in Nevada City, but his
boarding place while in Berkeley was with
Mrs. A. C. Hager, a distant relative, who
lived at 1404 Henry street, North Berkeley.
Mrs. Anna Mente! in Court.
i
; It was here that he met his death some
! time between late last night and early
' this morning.
The circumstances leading up to his de
cease show nothing which could indicate
In any way how the poison was tuken.
Sukeforth was always accounted a dili
gent student, and he spent the whole of
Sunday preparing for an examination
Which he should have taken this morning.
He remained at home throughout the en
tire day, not even going out of doors once. :
i After a light lunch at 9:30 o'clock in the
j evening he carried on his preparations ;
i for to-day's examination till some time !
' past midnight and then lay down to the
'â  sleep from which this morning failed to
awaken him.
"Harold did not go out all day yester
' day," said Mrs. ilager in speaking of the
sad affair. "He kept himself confined in
: his room almost all day long, coming out
every now and then to rest a motm-nt
from his studies. It was his practice t>>
write home every Sunday, but yesterday
' he felt too busy and asked me to write
Instead. 1 did this for him. L*it<- in the
i evening he ate a light lunch with my
daughter and myself. It was a simple
lunch of stewed plums and squash pie.
i About half-past 9 he went to his room
to study again, and we bade hiih good
night. "He remarked that there was a
I good deal for him to read before to-day.
"At half-past 7 this morning the break
fast bell was rung, but no move or stir
i teemed to come from Harold's room.
We waited ten minutes and rang again.
There was no answer and the door was
locked. My daughter and 1 hastened to
the window, where an entrance could be
I gained, and there we found him, dead."
The room which young Sukeforth occu-
I pied had been left in perfect order.
'â â  Everything was in its usual place, and
nothing suggested a struggle or any kind.
The books lay on the table as he left
I them, the lamp had burned up about
' three-fourths of the oil, showing that it
had been used till a very late hour.
Deputy Coroner Streightif of Berkeley
] was notified immediately. He ordered an
: autopsy to be held this afternoon, and
'â  telephoned at once to the young man's
I parents in Nevada City. Word came back
to prepare the body t'> be sent home. W.
iH. Sukeforth the lather, who is a
j wealthy mining man of Nevada City, will
arrive in Berkeley to-morrow to take
charge of the remains.
The autopsy was held this afternoon by
! Dr. F. R. Woolsey. Dr. G. B. Hoagland
< and Dr. J. E. Kelsey. A careful exam-
I ination showed that every organ In the
, body was perfectly sound and normal. It
i was thought at first that death probably
i resulted from heart disease, and it was
feared by several of his friends that a
somewhat excessive use of cigarettes
might have been responsible for his de
cease. But nothing could be found in the
autopsy to confirm these theories. The
physicians soon agreed that death has
been brought about by prison. '1 ne
stomach is to be subjected to a rigid test,
the result of which will not be known
until Tuesday morning.
It was suggested by one of the physi
cians that young Sukeforth had proba
bly studied until a very late hour, and
feeling the need of rest had used some
drug or other to induce sleep. He may
have used too large a dose and thus have
I ended his life. All suggestions pointing
to a voluntary suicide seem groundless,
as no motive whatever could be assigned
for such an act. That there could have
been poison in any of the food he had
eaten on Sunday seems impossible, as no
such effects were felt by any other mem
bers of the family. Not until the result
of the autopsy is made known to-morrow
can any clew be gained to the mystery.
TbÂ»- deceased was a member of the
iunior class in college. He was of a quiet,
retiring disposition, and seemed to have
but few friends among the students.
During the present term he had been
promoted to the rank of first sergeant
in Company H of the University Cadet
Corps His instructors speak of him as
a careful and diligent student.
The time of the inquest has not vet
been set. It will be determined as soon
as the physicians announce the result of
the autopsy.
She Got Back Her Saratoga,
OAKLAND, Dec. 12.â Mrs. M. Harvey
has recovered her missing trunk by
means of a search warrant, and thereby
hangs a tale. She was formerly in the
restaurant business with Mrs. Frank
Welton on Franklin street and a few days
ago packed her trunk to leave. While
she- went out to order an expressman her
trunk disappeared. William Lycurgus
and Eliza Maddocks. formerly her em
ployes, afterward confessed they had
made away with the Saratoga, claiming
Mrs. Harvey owed them $2 50 on account.
I'oiice Judge Moore to-day held that they
did not pursue the proper course and re

MRS, MENTEL IS
ARRAIGNED ON A
MURDER CHARGE
Preliminary Examina-
tion in Alameda.
BUT FEW WITNESSES TESTIFY
STORY OF THE FINDING OF
THE BODY RETOLD.
Defense Will Try to Prove the Act
Was Committed in Self-Defense.
Hearing to Be Continued
To-Morrow.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Anna Mentel. charged with the murder of
her husband, W. P. Mentel, on the night
of December 1, was begun before Justice
Henry T. Morris in Alameda yesterday
afternoon. The hearing was held In the
apartments of Recorder St. Sure in the
City Hall, which was filled with a curious
throng. Unlike most murder trials, how
ever, but few women were present.
The proceedings were delayed at the
start by the tardiness of District Attorney j
Snook, who did not put In an appearance
until nearly 3 o'clock. Deputy District
Attorney Lin Church has had the han
dling of the c:ise up to the present time,
but ho waa busy with another case, and
consequently Mr. Snook was obliged to
step in without the slightest preparation.
The defendant was on hand promptly,
being brought over from the County Jail
in Oakland by Sergeant John Conrad and
Officer William Gunn of the Alameda
police force. She was accompanied by her \
Bister, Miss May Beth, and nor father,
Adolph Beth of this city. Mr. Sherwood,
an uncle, was also present in the court
room during the hearing. Mrs. Mental
wore a blue dr.-ss. black fedora hat, black
fur eai><\ black k'.<>v>'s ;ind a black veil.
Il.r eyea were red from much weeping,
and the white bandage that encircled her
head gave her the appearance of an in
valid. She Bat between her attorneysâ
W. W. Foote and ex-Senator Guy C. Earl
âshrinking behind the broad shoulders of
the former, as though she feared to face]
her accusers. At thf other end of the j
table ;-at her father and sister, the latter j
a pretty girl, neatly attired, whose eyes
also bore evidence of recent weeping.
When Mrs. Mentel stood up to hear the
reading of the charge against her by the j
Judge she trembled visibly, and when his â¢
Honor askou her if she understood tho
nature of the proceedings and her rights
under the law. as he explained them, she
answered "yes" in such a weak voice that
she could not be heard two feet away.
The evidence was confined exclusively to
the testimony of witnesses who were
present when the body of Mentel was
first discovered lying on the sldev/alk on
Santa Clara street, almost directly in
front of the residence of Georgo W.
Shreve.
Arthur Jenkins was the first witness ex
amined as he was also the first to see
the body. His testimony was substan
tially the same as that given by him at
the inquest two days after the crime was
committed. He said he was riding on
un Alameda electric car when Mrs. Mentel
suddenly appeared in the road. As the car
came to a stop she cried out: "I have shot
my husband and myself, too. I wish you
would take me somewhere." Her hands
were blood-stained and there was blood
on her cape. She was hatless and ap
peared very much excited. In response
to questions she said vaguely her hus
band was "over there." He heard a man
groaning and he and another passenger
found Mentel lying on the sidewalk in a
pool of blood. His right hand was in his
pocket and he was lying on a large bun
dle. He was alive, but unconscious, and
died in a few minutes. He also told of
Mrs. Mentel being taken to the house of
Dr. Lubbock, a short distance down the
road, on the car. and the arrival of Judge
Morris and Sergeant Conrad on the scene.
He saw the revolver lying at the feet of
Mentel and Identified the one produced in
court by a piece chipped from the handle.
The testimony of L. GUlogly, conduc
tor, and J. L. Dicks, motorman of the
car, was chiefly in corroboration of Jen
kins' testimony, as was also that of Miss
Maybelle Guerne, a passenger. Dicks was
still on the stand when court adjourned
until 9 - 30 o'clock to-morrow morning. At
torney Foote cross-examined the wit
nesses briefly and sought to bring out the
fact that when Mrs. Mentel was taken
aboard the car she showed evidence of a
struggle, but none of the witnesses could
recollect anything of the kind.
The defense claims that when the proper
time comes they will prove that Mrs.
Mentel was knocked down and beaten by
her husband before the shooting took
place. Dr. Porter, the physician at the
Receiving Hospital at Oakland, where
Mrs. Mentel was taken to have her wound
dressed, will, it is said, go on the stand
and testify that her arm and shoulder was
black and blue and that there were black
and blue marks on her body.
The defense will not present any wit
nesses at this stage of the proceeding,
notwithstanding the report that it expects
to secure an acquittal at the preliminary
examination.
On the other hand the prosecution will,
on Wednesday, introduce the evidence of
the two physicians who performed the au
topsy, Drs." Lubbock anS Meyers, to show
that the shots could not have been fired
by a person lying on the ground, and fur
ther that the second shot was fired after
the man had fallen to the ground.
There are rumors of iensational testi
mony to bo givpn before the hearing 1 is
over, but the woman's attorneys say they
will reserve their evidence until the trial
takes place.

It is expected that the Police Commis
sioners at their next meeting will name
a successor to the late Captain Carson.
There are several candidates for the pre
ferment, but no one can be said to have
the inside track. Sergeant Morrison, De
tective Hodg-kins. Patrolman Scanlon and
Jailer Swain have all been suggested to
the Commissioners by their friends, but
the lucky man will have to secure the
indorsement of Chief Fletcher, and the
Chief is as mute as the grave.
It is not at all likely that the Chief will
recommend more than one change in his
next report to the Commissioners. He
will recommend a successor to Captain
f'.irpon. anti as it is known that for a
long time he has believed that two out
of the three sergeants would be more
useful to the city as ordinary officers he
may recommend that two and perhaps
all three be dropped.
In the event of dropping the sergeants,
Chief Fletcher may probably recommend
that they be restored to beats, and in the
event of a detective being promoted to
captain this would necessitate the promo
tion of a patrolman to a detective. With
the perfect system of police telephones
that exists in this city, by which each
officer reports to the central office every
two hours,, it has long been known that
the three sergeants were more an orna
ment than a necessity. They received no
more pay than a patrolman, their office
Is not recognized under the charter and
they were merely created about a year
ago for the purpose of conferring a few
favors under the old administration.
There are also some members of the
force who are superannuated and en
titled to pensions, and consequently there
Is much to interest those who consider
the welfare of the Police Department.

A BRIDE AWAITS
THE RETURN OF
DICK STODDARD
Irma Wilson Hopes the Mail
Clerk Will Lead Her to the
Altar To- Day.
Promise of an Exciting Meeting When the
Central Overland Reaches the Oakland
Mole This Morning, in Which Pis
tols May Figure.
Torn by conflicting emotions; at one
moment buoyed by the hope that her
lover would return and fulfill his half
hearted promise to right the great
wrong he has done her, the next cast
into the abyss of despair by the fear
that he has gone, never to return,
poor, trustful, innocent Irma Wilson
peeks refuge in the one unfailing earth
ly haven â a mother's sheltering arms.
fin the Central Pacific overland
which will arrive in San Francisco this
morning is believed to be Richard C.
Stoddard, a dashing young clerk in the
railway mail service, whose coming
Irma Wilson so anxiously awaits.
At the Oakland mole Stoddard will
bp met by Irma's mother and probably
hor father, and escorted across the bay.
It ho stands ready to keep his promise,
a trip to the City Hall toj procure a
marriage license will be made, fallowed
by a simple ceremony which will wipe
out the stain under which Irma chafes,
and will install her into the realm of
honored wifehood. Should he seek to
> % his responsibility or delay the
righting of the wrong, there promises
to be an intensely dramatic scene, for
Mr. Wilson is intensely wrought up
over the tarnishing of his daughter's
honor, and he has made violent threats
against young Stoddard unless he re
pairs the injury forthwith. Should he
be there, however, he will not be given
any opportunity to make use of the
huge revolver he has been carrying
since he learned of Stoddard's perfidy;
for detectives will be close at hand to
prevent any such occurrence.
The life story of Irma Wilson is most
pathetic. Born in Modesto scarcely
sixteen years ago, family dissension
marred her home, and before she was
old em .;h to fully comprehend the
shadow that had fallen upon her young
life her parents separated, Wilson
eventually going to Applegate, Placer
County, where he has amassed a con-
Biderable fortune. In the course of a
I'-v. years Mrs. Wilson became Mrs.
<i\ i rly and removed to Reno, New,
taking her daughter. It was there
that Irma first met Handsome Dick
Stoddard. His father, the leading
banker and one of the most prominent
citizens of the place, gave his son a
standing in the best circles that the boy
was naturally well qualified to fill.
The Overtys moved in the same set
and in a short time Dick and Irma
wÂ« re firm friends. Mrs. Overly is a
cousin of a member of President Jlc-
Kinley's Cabinet and has .many rela
tives who are prominent in this and
other States, another cousin being
George McKenzle. a prominent busi
ness man of Chicago.
Young Stoddard completed his school
life and entered the Railway Mail Ser
vice, being placed on the run between
San Francisco and Ogden. The little
city of Reno became irksome to Irma
after Dick went away, and the monot
ony of mountain life was broken by
occasional visits to San Francisco,
whore she has a number of friends. It
was during one of thes^ visits that
she met Stoddard and the friendship
that begun in Nevada was renewed
and strengthened here.
Stoddard had formed the acauaint
anoe of a sot well known about town,
and Introduced Irma to some of his
newer friends. She it was who figured
as= tho mysterious female friend at the
tin,- ..f ,iuik>y Clancy's runaway mar
riage last June, lending her assistance
to thp eloping couple, but carefully con
cealing her identity at the time. Though
barely more than a chlM in years. Irma
is a largo, wr-11-formcd. i.oautiful girl,
who might readily pass for a woman of
20. Stoddard, too, was connected with
the Clancy elopement, and that affair
may be regarded as the great crisis in
their lives.
Irma's visits to the metropolis be
came more frequent and of greater
length, and Stoddard passed all his
time- when here in her company.
There could be but one result to these
secret meetings. The child discovered,
when too late, that in quaffing from the
cup of sinful pleasures the dregs must
surely be partaken of as well. She

And Sight Restored.
I am a graduate of Oberlin College, taught
long enough after I graduated to have them
give me the Honorary degree, and I have a
great many acquaintances in and around Boa-
ton. About three years ago my son brought
home a box of OVTKJUKA (ointment), and I
picked up the circular that was around it, and
learned about tbe ConctrmA Soap, and told
him to get me a cake. When 1 got it, the cir-
cularadvised its use for the bath, teeth, scalp,
etc. I bad been a great sufferer all my life
from sore eyelids, the whole lid outside and in
was red as a beet. I had to sit in a dark room,
evenings, for eight and a half years, and wear
black spectacles to keep the sun from my eyea
in the daytime. When I got the Cuticcra
Soap, I got a fine, soft cloth, dipped it in hot
water and rubbed it on the soap and washed
my eyes with it. I can't teli you how much
good It has done me, although it smarted
very much at first. My eyes are as clear and
bright as when I was a young lady. I had to
go backwards in getting spectacles and wear

pleaded with Stoddard to give her his I
name, but he refused, or at least de
layed. The time came when the un
happy girl must seek consolation from
some source or else go mad, and then
she turned to her mother. Mrs. Overly
came and under her ministrations
Irma found a ray of comfort. Stoddard
was seen and promised the mother that
he would make Irma his wife. That
was one day last week. Mrs. Overly
placed full faith in the young man's
promise, and she still believes he will
hold to his word when he returns to- j
day.
Meanwhile Mr. Wilson had learned
of his daughter's trouble, and came
post haste to San Francisco. All last
week he searched for Stoddard with a
wicked looking revolver, swearing
vengeance on the man who had
wrecked his daughter's happiness, and
vowing he would make the young man

interviews with the young- man. She

Mrs. Overly has declared that not only
will he lose his position, but she will
seek justice from the courts. She has
consulted attorneys and has ascer
tained that Stoddard is liable to a lone
term in the penitentiary. and that he
shall receive full punishment she is .
determined upon. For that reason she j
will be at the Oakland mole when the

best-known residents of this city, died at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon at the Pal

over two weeks. The deceased was the
widow of the late Captain Daniel Hanlon,
who was one of the early pioneers of this
State. On November 25, after eating a
hearty dinner, Mrs. Hanlon broke a blood
vessel in her brain and became uncon
scious. From then until the hour of her
death she was in a comatose condition.

and John F. Hanlon of this city, Daniel
M. Hanlon of Lassen County, Mrs. Mollie
E. Crump of Boston, Mass.; Mrs. Emilie
E. Banks of Lassen County and Miss
Josephine G. Hanlon. who was living
with her mother. Mrs. Hanlon was born
at Ploen, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany,
and was 60 years of age. She married
Captain Hanlon in London when a young
woman and came to California. She was
a lady of most lovable character and
noted for her liberality to the poor. The
funeral will take place from the Palace
Hotel to-morrow, and after solemn high
mass at the Cathedral, the remains will
be interred in Holy Cross Oemeterv
When she was taken ill Mrs. Hanlon was
about to go to visit her daughter Mrs
Crump, in Boston. She was apparently
in the best of health and had spent the
summer at Del Monte.

NIELSEN DIVORCE ROMANCE
TOLD HER HUSBAND SHE LOVED
ANOTHER MAN.
Wronged Spouse Claims His Pretty
Erring Wife Was Hypnotized
by Elias Ruud and the
Norwegian Poet.
Jorgen Nielsen has begun suit for di
vorce from his wife. Camilla Nielsen.
Jorgen is the proprietor of a little watch
repuiring shop on Polk street, and Ca
milla, as far as hr-r unhappy husband
knows, is somewhere in the Northwest
with Elias Ruud, the man she told her
husband she could not live without.
It is an Ibsen tale with a real flesh and j
blood Nora, a wrecked home, a broken- j
hearted husband and two children who !
' will nevermore know the love of a mother.
Nielsen traces all his troubles to his
; wife's study of the great Norwegian
: dramatist, her unfortunate meeting with
Elias Ruud, the close intimacy of private
, theatricals, and concludes the whole with
a dash of mysticism in which a Svengali I
eye and mesmeric power prove important
factors.
Jorgen Nielsen and Camilla Andersen
were married ten years ago in Denmark,
j and for nine years have made their home
in this city. Their union, an unusually
happy one, was blessed by two children
two girls, now aged 9 and 7 years respec
tively. Mrs. Nielsen was young, ex
tremely pretty and with a literary taste
that induced hor to join a Danish dra
matic socioty that made a point of study
ing Ibsen and occasionally producing a
drama from the same prolific source. Mrs.
Nielsen's first appearance was in "Peer
Gynt," and she had for her vis-a-vis in
the production Elias Ruud. insurance
agent, a married man and the father of
three children.
Immediately after the "Peer Gynt" pro
duction Nielsen noticed that his wife lost
her usual high spirits, that her interest .
in home and family was gradually de
rreaFing and her health rapidly failing.
Blatters went on in this way until one
day last May Mrs. Nielsen went to her
husband and told him that she loved an
other, that the other was Ellas Ruud, and
that it was Impossible for her to live
without him. In every way Nielsen tried
to show his erring spouse thp evil of her
way, but without avail. When he told
her of her duty toward her children she
told him .she had a higher duty, and that
was the duty toward herself. Finally
husband and wife agreed to part, the wife
receiving from her husband $800 and all
the household furniture.
Acting upon the advice of Ruud, Mrs
Nielsen invested $200 in a little stationery
store at the Mission. She continued in
business but for two weeks, and then
turned over to Mrs. Ruud the shop and
the furniture she had received from Niel
j sen. After signing over this property to
her lover's wife Mrs. Nielsen and Ruud
left for Tacoma.
Nielsen is suing for divorce on the
i ground 01 desertion. In spite of the mis
< erable conduct of his wife, he finds much
to condone in her, and lays the entire
blame upon Ruud, who, he claims has
hypnotized her and turned her brain with
! Ibsen logic.
Ruud's reputation in the Norwegian
I colony is a most unsavory one. Some
| time ago he figured in a romance in which
his marriage to a young woman was
1 called off at the altar. Ruud had repre
sented himself as a single man, and at
the eleventh hour it was discovered that
he had a wife and family in Norway.
Mrs. Mary Ruud, wife of the eloping
Ibsenite. filed a suit for divorce on the 3d
of December.

DEMOCRATS MAY TAKE
A HAND IN THE GAME
They Resent the Friendship of the Examiner
for Colonel Burns and the
Railroad.
Grant's Salaried Agents Are Openly Boasting That They
Have Written Pledges From Legislators Who Were
"Helped" With Their Employer's
Eastern Money,
For the first time since the announce
ment of the result of the election the
Democratic members of the Legislature
are beginning to take an active inter
est in the selection of the successor of
United States Senator Stephen M.
White. This interest is due primarily
to the candidacy of Colonel Daniel
Burns, but more particularly to the at
titude that has been assumed by the
Kxarniner toward Burns' candidacy
and the railroad interests that are sup
porting It.
Some of the more prominent members
of the Democratic minority who con
sented to discuss the matter yesterday
were emphatic in their declaration that
party lines should be wiped out if such
a course becomes necessary to avert a
public calamity. They contend that
the Examiner, which pretends to be
the leading organ of the Democracy,
having Joined hands with Herrin and
other political manipulators of the
Southern Pacific Company for the pro
motion of Burns' Senatorial candidacy,
should not be allowed to place the
Democratic party in a false light by
inference before the people of the
State. These men claim that if Burns
becomes a candidate before the Legis
lature it will then become the duty of
the Democratic members of that body,
knowing that the election of a Demo
cratic Senator is out of the range of
possibilities, to join hands with honest
Republicans in an effort to elect a man
to the United States Senate who will
enter the American Congress as a rep
resentative of the interests of the peo
ple of California and not the will of the
men who guide the destinies of the
Southern Pacific Raiiroad Company.
That the Examiner has been taken
Into the railroad camp becomes more
and more apparent every day â a fact
that is causing" considerable resent
ment to be manifest ed hy the leaders
of the Democratic party in the city and
State, for the reason, they assert, that
It places the party, in a measure, in the
position of supporting the schemes of
the Southern Pacific Company. The
Examiner is avowedly the mouthpiece
and defender of William F. Herrin, the
railroad's political agent, and It does
not go to the tro-Ã¼ble of attempting? to
disguise its support of Burns' Sena
torial aspirations. Its agents and em
ployes are working openly In behalf of
Burns, a fact that will be corroborated
by a score or more of legislators who
have been "held up" by the paper's
salaried strikers. This has had the ef
fect of reviving the stories recently
circulated to the effect that a "secret"
contract has been entered into by the
Examiner and the railroad company,
said contract to extend over two ses
sions of the Legislature and one gener
al election, during which time the com
pany shall enjoy "immunity from at
tack" by the paper.
A fair illustration of what a majority
of the members of the Legislature
think of Colonel Burns, his candidacy
and h's supporters, is given in an inter
view had yesterday with a gentleman
who is rightly considered one of the
leaders of the State Senate. He said:
"There are those who must, after all,
sympathize with the fix of the political
agent of a corporation who is forced to
look up a candidate for the United
States Senate on the moral and social
level of his employers. It might be
that the agent, left to himself, would
prefer a man who could play the cor
poration frame with a background of
respectability â one whose past would
not rise up to shame the people who
grave him place, and incidentally scare
off the unwary. But in such a case
your political worker must consider
circumstances. The Senator he wants
may be one thing; the Senator he
must take must be of the ilk his cli
ents can und-â tand and feel at home
with in the srentle arts of addition, di
vision and silence. Particularly the
statesman ought to be one whom his
employers have such a hold upon
through their knowledge of his
darker past that he must necessarily
stay bought and be unable, under any
circumstances, to twit them upon his
superior virtue. Such a task was set
for Mr. Herrin and his selection as a
man meeting all of the requirements
of the complicated situation is Colonel
Dan Burns.
"It is no small matter to satisfy a
group of millionaires who have made
their fortunes in robbing- stockholders,
stuffing dummy corporations, rigging
the market and breaking promises
made to State, county and municipal
governments, in selecting a candidate
for United States Senator when so
much is wanted in Congress in the way
of special privileges. If the choice is
respectable the dirty work may not be
done; if vulgarly and criminally vicious
it may be done for the benefit of the
statesman himself or balked altogether.
The thing is to strike the happy medi
um of rascality where the members of
the corporations stand and where con
cert of action may always be depended
on. In selecting Colonel Burns Mr.
Herrin seems to have hit this happy
medium.
"For once the Senatorial choice is
worthy of those who have made him
and they in turn are worthy of
it. The task seems to have
been a difficult one for the agent, but
who can say that he has not performed
his duty well. Mr. Herrin having com
pleted his task to his own and his em
ployer's satisfaction, It only remains
for the members of the Legislature to
ratify his acts. I do not believe that
there are sixty-one members of the
Legislature who will so far renounce
their sacred obligations to the people
who elected them as to ratify the choice
Mr. Herrin has made for his employers.
! If they did so It would be a tmbllc
! calamity."
The Senatorial candidacy- of U. S.
I Grant Jr. is becoming almost as great
; a stench in the nostrils of decent peo
: pie as that of Colonel Burns. His
; agents openly boast that he has written
! pledsjps from certain members of the
Legislature and that these pledges
were secured by him prior to the elec
tion in return for money given the
members to promote their candidacy.
It is something of a shock to decent
people to hear that a man who aspires
to represent the State in the upper
house of Congress boasts that he owns
certain legislators by reason of the
money he has given them; that he car
ries in his pocket the written evidence
of their servility, and that they dare
not break their chains for fear of the
law. It is not likely that the men
whose honor Mr. Grant boasts of hav
ing purchased will come forward and
confess their infamy and their slavery
before the public, but it may be that if
they have the hardihood to carry out
their part of the illegal and disgraceful
compact there will be others who will
relieve them of the task and at the
same time perform a public service.
It is an old rule in politics that the
man who will buy a vote can himself
be bought. It may be that a candidate
who has purchased votes expects to re
imburse himself, in the event of his
election, for money he has paid to leg
islative candidates and members-elect
by placing his own vote at auction up
on his arrival at the national capital.
To all outward appearances such a
man seems to be a statesman who Is
spending his mother's money, the free
gift of a generous people, and trading
on an honored name for the purpose of
personal gain. For this purpose he
wishes to represent In the national
Congress the people of a State in which
he has lived so short a time that he
is not familiar with its geography, its
needs or its people.
Before and since the election Grant
has had in his employ a small army of
political heelers who have been in
trusted with the work of distributing
his money through the different coun
ties of the State for the purpose of in
fluencing the votes of Legislators.
Grant publicly declares that this money
has been spent for the sole purpose of
promoting his Senatorial candidacy, a
fact that he sets forth as one of the
principal reasons why his claims should
be recognized by the Legislature. He j
recently admitted in an interview that i
this money was furnished him by
prominent friends in the East. It is
also known beyond doubt that one
branch of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's stockholders is seeking to se
cure his election. This interest is rep
resented by First Vice-President Hub
bard in New York and is supplemented
by the owners of the Santa Fe road.
With Burns and his record and the
C. P. Huntlngton end of the Southern
Pacific Company on one side and I
Grant and the Hubbard end of the j
Southern Pacific on the other the. good
people of California have small show
of an honest representative in Con- ;
gress to succeed Senator White. It is
not conceivable that the Republican |
party in this State will permit either i
of these worthies to attain the object j
for which they are aiming.
Mr. Grant's services to the Republi
can party in this State consist of knif
ing the State ticket in San Diego
County at the last election so success
fully that in the event of a close vote
he would have succeeeded in defeating i
almost the entire State ticket. It is
possible that some one knows why |
Mr. Grant has a claim on the party !
sufficiently strong to entitle him to ',
consideration as a Senatorial candi
date. If some one of hia salaried
agents will come forward with one
reason â save that his name is Grant â
why he should be elected United States
Senator The Call will gladly publish
the same.
It does not seem within the range of
possibilities that the people of this
State wish to be represented in the
national Senate by a stranger who is
trying to purchase his election with
Eastern money and whose interests
are the interests of Eastern men who
have nothing in common with Califor
nia or Californians.

The advertisement canvasser for a St. Louis daily paper says of
Ripans Tabules : , " Ever since I can remember I have been troubled -
with constipation in its severest form. So acute, in fact, at times, as
to produce dreadful â¢ headaches that, notwithstanding all the outdoor
work afforded me by my vocation, and the latitude it allowed me to
test my pedestrian â which is supposed to be a successful
manner of displacing constipationâ l was very often compelled to.
forego .my pursuit of ':* business. ' Constipation with me seemed to 1
be hereditary rather than due to accidental causes, therefore much 1
harder to relieve. In my extremity I often resorted 'to most drastic
measures, but found no cure to be permanent..- In 1892 while con-
nected with the Times of El Paso, Tex., Ripans Tabules were brought
to my notice, and I used them with marked success. Nowadays I i
never suffer from such severe cases of constipation, and the violent 1
