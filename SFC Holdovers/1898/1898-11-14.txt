RUMORED
DEATH OF
DREYFUS
Based on Mysterious
Telegram. â¢
PARISIANS BELIEVE REPORT
GENERAL IDEA THAT THE PRIS
ONER IS DEAD.
All Bequests of Mme. Dreyfus to Send
Clothing to Her Husband or
Communicate With Him,
Have Been Denied.
SpeclaJ Dispatch to The Call,
PARIS, Nov. 13. â It is reported here
this evening that Dreyfus is dead.
The rumor is understood to be based
upon a mysterious telegram received
from Colmar, capital of Upper Alsace,
signed by an unknown correspondent.
So far as can be ascertained there
is no official confirmation of the report.
The father-in-law of Dreyfus discredits
it. He says he has received excellent
accounts from the Colonial Office quite
recently as to the prisoner's health.
Despite these assurances there are
dark rumors afloat. In view of the cu
rious manner in which the letter from
Dreyfus, declaring that he had aban
doned all hope, was conveyed to Mme.
Dreyfus on Friday, many people be
lieve he is dead.
A dispatch from Paris on Friday
said that Mme. Dreyfus had applied
that day at the office of the Minister
of the Colonies for permission to send
her husband some warm clothing for
his return home. The request was re
fused on the ground that the Govern
ment would do whatever was neces
sary.
At the same time, according to the
dispatch, the authorities read her a let
ter from her husband to the effect that
having for five months addressed ap
peals for revision to General De Bois
deffre (recently chief of staff of the
French army) without getting â¢"V re
ply and being weary and exhausted by
his useless appeals, he would write no
more to his family or to any one else.
He described himself as ill and dying
and bequeathed to the "generosity of
my country the care of rehabilitating
m>- meiiory."
It appears that Mme. Dreyfus then
asked permission to telegraph her hus
band the decision of the Court of Cas
sation. This request was also refused.
Then, through a friend, she appealed
to President Faure with no better re
sult.
The dispatch said her counsel would
bring the whole matter before the
Court of Cassation.
Careful inquiries made at Colmar this
evening show that nothing is known
there as to the death of Dreyfus. It
is now believed that the telegram was
a hoax.

TERRIBLE DEATH OF MRS.
MARIE PREAY, WHOSE BODY
WAS BURNED TO CRISP
Neighbors Attracted by b[er Heartrending Screams
Flushed to H er Rescue, but Could Do
Nottyng for Her.
OAKT AND Nov 13 -Mrs. Marie Preay, the pretty young wife of Antonio Preay, was burned to death
this aYternoon at her home on Thirty-second street, near Fourteenth avenue. Her body was burned to a
crisn and her agonizing screams were heartrending to the few neighbors who rushed to her rescue, but \wio
coufd "o *notnln* Tor her ln the throes of death Mrs. Preay related the circumstances that led to her un-
ZetLking off It appears that her husband, together with one of the two little girls, was visiting
friends at San Leandro, the other child remaining with the mother. .
At about 120 o'clock this afternoon Mrs. Preay decided to prepare dinner for her returning loved ones.
She â¢ a kSSllnf tn SÂ£ when her light calico gown was ignited by a .park. This sh e di Â« not Â»ott~ un
til her little daughter cried out "Mamma, mamma, you are burning." Overcome with the seriousness of
her conditlon-for she wÂ« about to become a mother again-she rushed through the kitchen and hall and
out on the front porch and screamed for help; all the while the flames were consuming her raiment Soon
her beautiful hair was ablaze and her dark skin was burning A light breeze fanned the fla â¢ 3 Â°"
deadly mission. Unable to call for help any longer she fell to the floor when Louis Fernandez, farmed by
her cries, rushed to her assistance. Quickly a blanket was procured and the flames were smothered but
the flesh was still sizzling when he carried her into the house, and between groans she endeavored to
tell him how it happened. The neighborhood is sparsely settled, but the few neighbors soon thronged to the
dying woman's bedside. Dr. Sill and another physician were summoned, but only the woman s pains could
be alleviated by them. Shortly after 4 o'clockâ after a delicate operation had been performedâ the woman
died with the corpse of a little one by her side.
Antonio was half crazed with grief when he learned of his wife s horrible death. Kind and condoling
words of his neighbors could not soothe him, and temporarily, at least, he is a mental wreck.
Mrs. Preay was a native of Portugal, aged 25 years. She and her husband were industrious folk, and
owned their little home on Thirty-second street, where they have resided the past four months, coming from
San Jose.
The San Francisco Call
SPAIN SEES
HER UTTER
WEAKNESS
Must Yield on Every
Point.
FIRMNESS OF THE AMERICANS
DETERMINED TO RETAIN THE
PHILIPPINES.
Their Last Memorandum Regarded
as a Virtual Ultimatum â Cred
itors Watching the Ne
gotiations.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
PARIS, Nov. 13. â Among onlookers
here the impression exists â though it is
not the result of any official statement
âthat the Spanish Peace Commission
ers will not consent to a treaty which
the American Commissioners could
sign. It seems almost possible, also.
that in the pitiable pressure to which
the Spanish Commissioners are sub
jected between their large creditors,
who are on the spot watching them,
and the stern attitude of the United
States, the Spaniards may abandon
their struggles and leave the two forces
to confront each other.
It will not be decided until to-morrow
morning whether the next joint session
is to occur to-morrow or on Tuesday.
The Spaniards, it has been arranged,
will inform the Americans to-morrow
morning whether they need the day to
prepare their next memorandum. If
they want Monday the meeting will
take place on Tuesday. Under the
rules of procedure adopted at the con
ference, it is understood that the de
liberations may not be unexpectedly
concluded by either side.
The statement is printed here this
evening that the last memorandum
from the Americans is regarded by the
Spaniards as a virtual ultimatum, but
as a matter of fact the Americans have
not presented an ultimatum, save as
their treatment of the subject in hand
may be unswervable. It is only since
Wednesday last that the Spaniards
have begun to feel that the Americans
purpose taking over the Philippines
and that, too, without any assumption
of Spanish indebtedness. As they are
now convinced of this, it may be that
Spain's next presentment In the con
ference will be the supreme rally of her
diplomats' argumentative and tactical
forces. It may even mark the con
clusion of all she has to say. but if the
rules of procedure are followed the
Americans would still have another
presentation to submit.
Ever since October 1 it has been
within the range of possibility that at
any meeting an open rupture might oc
cur, and on one or two occasions it
might have been easily a fact even be
fore the taking up of the Philippine
question. The boundaries of the field
in which that question is being worked
out are becoming more apparent and
the angle of final settlement cannot be
far off. If a treaty is to result here it
may fairly be expected within three
weeks, although it is not trueâ as re
ported from the United States to-dayâ
that the Americans have instructions
embodying a time limit for the conclu
sion of the conference.
Judge Day has completely recovered.
The Gaulois this morning says: "The
acquisition of the Philippines for
twenty-five years by an international
syndicate, from which every power may
eventually acquire them, is a rumor
based on facts of which the Gaulois will
to-morrow (Monday) give dtails."
Following this lead, the Gaulois and
other papers will to-morrow announce
the scheme somewhat on these lines:
A syndicate representing $400,000,000
capital proposes to take over the com
mercial resources and advantages r>f
the Philippines for a term of twenty
five years, paying to the dominant
r therein $125,000,000 for the privi
lege.
Under the alleged terms of this
F'h'me, the dominant power would ad
minister the political and military gov
ernment of the islands at its own ex

pense, under the apportionment named,
while the syndicate would collect all
customs and other revenues for the
term specified.
The scheme involves giving Spain
$175,000,000 to satisfy any real or imag
inary claims she may make as to the
territory. This feature is said to be
based on the assumption that the
United States will be the dominant
power. The remaining $100,000,000 of
this reputed syndicate would be pre
served as its working capital.
The sponsor of the project ia a Mr.
Young, said to be a son of Brigham
Young, and an attempt is apparently
made to create the impression that the
capital of $400,000,000 is already under
written. .
It is thought possible, however, if the
alleged syndicate has an existence, that
Americans may have an opportunity
given them to join with it in holdings
of large or small amounts. Whether
it proves veritable or otherwise,
friends of the United States here are
asking if the announcement of the
scheme is not intended to embarrass
the Americans by an offer, real or ap
parent, of $400,000,000 for a limited time,
for the use of which the Americans
may desire to acquire in perpetuity for
a pum relatively nil.
X.-fT-official Americans in Paris put
aside as unthinkable the assumption
that the United States would farm its
burdens or its advantages, if any, in
the Philippines, which, if acquired, will
be taken over as indemnity attending
the discharge of high responsibilitee.
In any event, the Amercan Commis
sioners will doubtless ask whether the
announcement is timed to serve the
ends of the syndicate or to hinder the
efforts of Judge Day and his associates
to affect an amicable adjustment of the
Philippine question.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Nov. 13.â The following ad
vices have been received from Iloilo,
capital of Panay, one of the principal
islands of the Viscayas group:
The insurgents have occupied Linga
nis, Oton and Pavia, suburbs of Iloilo,
and are daily expected to attack the
town. The Spaniards have abandoned
the mote and destroyed the connecting
bridges.
Business is paralyzed and the inhabi
tants are in a state of terror. The
mercantile houses of all nationalities
have signed a circular asking the com
mander of the United States cruiser
Charleston to remain, as the Spanish
authorities are incapable of affording
them protection.
It is reported also that the insurgents
have taken the whole of the islands of
Negros and Zl-zu of the Viscayas group.
As the cable connections are cut, it is
impossible to confirm this rumor.
On November 6, General Rios, Span
ish Governor of the Viscayas. is said to
have declared a seven days' armistice
in order to communicate with Madrid
with a view of transferring control to
the Americans.
Major Bell has gone to Iloilo to as
certain the facts of the situation.
The United States transport Scandia

ALASKA GETS HER FIRST
WINTER MAIL SERVICE
Semi-Monthly Trips to All Main
Points â No Extension Likely
for the Present.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â 50 far as the
postal officials are advised there Is no
warrant for any extension of service inthe
region about the Allankakat River north
ward. The Postofflce Department has had
agents in the interior of Alaska reporting
on the needs as well as the conditions of
the service, and an inspector from the
Railway Mall Service is now en route
there to go over the whole field this
winter.
The Allankakat is practically unknown
to the postal authorities. The winter
plans for the postal service in the Yukon
region are completed, and will consist of
a twice a month service via Juneau, that
is, the regular route through Dawson to
Circle City to Weare, where the Tanana
River joins the Yukon, and thence down
the Yukon to St. Michael. This is the
first time the Yukon has had a winter
mail service (which is now already be
gun), and the department congratulates
itself on having these facilities, getting
mails as they do twice a month to the
main points in Alaska, instead of having
no service at all in winter as heretofore.
No extension of the service so far as to
provide mail service anywhere north of
the Yukon is contemplated.
There is nothing in the possession of the
postal officials to point to a large migra
tion to the Allankakat region, though if
as many as perhaps 500 people settle to
gether in that section it is likely that
after location is positively shown, ar
rangements to ship the mail there would
be made. Otherwise any who may be up
there will have to get their mails from
the nearest point on the Yukon, along
which the regular carrier travels, the
point most probably being either Rampart
or Tanana. The points at which the
mails will be left on the Yukon route are
Eagle at the mouth of Mission Creek;
Star, at the mouth of Forty-Mile Creek;
Circle, on the Yukon, at the mouth of the
Porcupine lUver: Rampart, formerly
called Minook;- Tanana, opposite the
mouth of the Tanana River; Koyukuk, at
the mouth of the river of the same name;
Anvik, at the mouth of the Alvill, and St.
Michael.
From Juneau to Tanana the mail serv
ice now in operation for the winter season
is semi-monthly. From 'lanana to St-
Michael it is monthly. The department
announces positively that no extensions
of the service in Alaska will be made dur
ing the winter, and no service whatever
so far is contemplated at either Fort
Hamlin or Arctic City, inquiry as to
which has been made, though sufficient
settlement may call for such action later
on.

UNITED STATES FLAGSHIP BROOKLYN.
Sir: I request to supplement my report of
the battle of July 3, and that it be filed with

LOST THEIR LIVES
IN CONTROLLER BAY
Man and Woman Drowned Through

Boat.
SEATTLE, Nov. 13.â The steamer Wol
cott, from Copper River, Alaska, brings
news of the drowning- of a young woman
named Grossop and a man named Tanker
son in Controller Bay, October 5. They
were rowing from the mouth of the Chil
kat River to Kayak Island, and their boat
capsized. The body of the woman was

headwaters of the Tanana. The average
altitude of the range is from 7000 to SOOO
feet.
TRENTON'S SPEEDY MAYOR.
At lieast $150,000 Ahead of the
Rubber Company.
TRENTON, N. J., Nov. 13.â Vice Chan
cellor Reed rendered a decision yesterday
in which he holds that Mayor Frank A.
Magown, as president of the Trenton Rub
ber Company, overdrew his accounts in
that concern to the extent of at least $150,
000. He also decides that Allen Magown,
the ex-Mayor's father, and a director or
the company, is civilly responsible for
$16 990 of the overdrafts, and that William
P 'Hayes another director, is responsible
to the extent of $3600.
Suit was instituted by Receiver Burd
with the idea of holding Allen Magown
and William P. Hayes responsible for the
c-x-Mayors overdrafts, on the ground that
they had been negligent in thejr duties as
directors. , . , Â
The Vice Chancellor expressed himself
crettv freely as to Magown's reckless
conduct in using the funds of the company
for his own personal benefit and says it
is clear that Alien Magown and Hayes
were negligent in their dealings, but they
can only be held responsible to the credi
tors from the time they knew the com
pany to be insolvent.

Wife.

TBAGEDY.
Mrs. Dale Shot Through the Heart
After a Vain Attempt to
Save Her Daughter's
Life.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
PLACERVIL.LE, Nov. 13.â An in
quest was held to-day over the bodies
of murdered Mrs. John fickle and Mrs.
Amanda Dale, and "Jack" Nickle, who
committed suicide after he had taken
the lives of his wife and her mother and
wounded his own child. It was brought
out that jealousy was the cause of the
crime. There was but one eye wit
ness to the shootingâ the eight-year-old
daughter of Mrs. Dale.
According to the child's story, "Jack"
Nickle and his wife, with their one
month-old child, were at the house of
Mrs. Dale. Nickle had a Winchester
rifle, with which he fired at his wife.
The bullet cut the neck of the child
and entered the breast of its mother.
Mrs. Dale assisted the wounded wo
man to flee from the house to a place
about 100 yards distant, where Mrs.
Nickle fell dead.
Mrs. Dale was continuing her flight
in the direction of a neighboring ranch,
where her husband was at work, whfjn
Nickle fired a bullet through her heart,
killing her instantly.
The murderer then coolly removed
one of his shoes, placed the muzzie of
his rifle to his heart' and pulled the
trigger with his toe. He fell dead at
the discharge of the gun.
Beyond a statement as to what oc
curred at the time of the tragedy noth
ing could be learned from the child.
; She could not give a coherent reason
for the murders and suicide, but enough
has been learned to make it certain
i that Nickle was JealOUS of his wife
and that he believed her stepfather
waÂ« a rival for her affections.
Ml of the principals to the tragedy
had a tinge of Indian blood in their
-veins, but were industrious and of good
: repute.
WRECK AT STOCKTON.
Freight Train Crashes Into the Oak
dale Combination Local.
STOCKTON. Nov. 13.â A freight train
from the north struck the Oakdale train
as it was backing down the Weber
avenue track late this afternoon, and the
passenger and combination coaches com
posing the latter were demolished. The
freight was running at a high speed and
that a score of people were not killed was
due to the fact that the passenger was
merely backing into position. The freight
struck the passenger coach squarely,
knocking it several yards from the track.
With it went the combination express and
mail car. The freight locomotive was
badly damaged. The train hands all
escaped.
ZOLA IS NOT COMING.

KANSAS CITY, Nov 13.â Edward Zola,
a resident of this city, and a cousin of
Emile Zola, the champion of Dreyfus,
says that the report that the French au

RANDSBURG, Nov. 13.â The following notice has been posted in
public places throughout the camp: . -

with, xiy order k>l
Dated November 10, IS9B.
In the past year Randsburg has been swept by two conflagrations,
and there have been numerous smaller blazes, all seemingly of in
cendiary origin. The camp is overrun by disreputable characters
who would stop' at no crime, and who have no honest means of sup
port The citizens have at last determined to purge the camp of this
element and the foregoing notice is simply preliminary to decisive
action that will be taken the Citizens Committee if the warn
ing be ignored. The people are in earnest; the thugs must move on
or there will be a few whipping posts in use, or a lynching or two,
should they be necessary as a last resort. . ;; . .
The people of Randsburg are dwelling in fear of another conflag
ration that shall lay in ruins those portions spared by previous incen
diary fires. It is the purpose of the thugs in starting these conflag-.
rations to loot stores and residences while the inhabitants are fight
ing the flames. 'The conclusion was reached that no one here would
be safe until the desperadoes were made to leave, and they will be,
even if some of them have to be carted out in long wooden boxes.

MYSTERY
Second Tragedy on
the Yacht.
NICK BERG FATALLY SHOT
HIS ASSAILANT THE KEEPEB OF
THE VESSEL.
Shooter Surrenders to a Sausalito
Officer and Claims the Man
He Wounded Was a
Burglar.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, Nov. 13.â TWe yacht
Chispa has become a craft of tragedies
and mysteries. Less than two months
ago Captain Brooks was murdered on
the pretty little vessel, and his slayer
has never been apprehended. To-night
there was another shooting on the
Chispa, and this, too, is shrouded in
mystery. The victim, Nick Berg, a man
who was arrested within the past two
weeks on a charge of burglary, but es
caped because of lack of proof, is so
dangerously wounded that his physi
cians forbid him to even talk of the
affair, and his story of the tragedy can
not be obtained to-night.
People along the water front at about
9 o'clock to-night distinctly heard two
shots in the direction of the Chispa. A
Deputy Constable who was on the
wharf at the time at once procured a
boat and rowed out toward the yacht
to investigate. When about half way
out he met a boat rowed by Ike "Elg,
who has been in charge of the Chispa
since the murder of Brooks. In the
boat were Mrs. Elg and Nick Ben?, the
latter unconscious from a wound in the
breast. Elg at once surrendered to the
officer, saving that he shot Berg.
Elg declares that he and his wife
were in the hold of the yacht when
they heard a burglar attempting to en
ter through the roof of the cabin. He
got his revolver, and as soon as he scot
sight of the fellow fired two shots, one
taking effect in the breast, just above
the nipple. The wound is very serious,
and the chances for the recovery of
Berg are slight.
Mrs. Elg's story does not agree ex
actly with that of her husband. In
fact, she does not appear to have alto
gether a clear idea of the tragedy. It
is declared by men who were in a
saloon on the water front that they
heard the reports of the revolver very
distinctly, and they are positive in the
belief that if Elg fired from the hold of
the vessel, as he claims to have done,
they would not have heard the shots.
They say that .the reports sounded as
though the revolver had been fired in
the open air.
The officials have not yet reached a
conclusion as to the cause of the trag
edy, and whether the story told by El*
is to believed. They are waiting for
the victim to recover sufficiently to give
a lucid account of what transpired
aboard the tragedy craft. In the mean
time, Elg is being held in custody.

LESSONS TAUGHT BY THE WAR
TOO LATE TO BUILD FORTS WHEN
FIGHTING BEGIITS.
Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance Says
Congress Has Always Ignored
Requests From His De
partment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13. â General
W. D. Flagler, chief of the Bureau cf
Ordnance, has made his annual report
to the Secretary of War. It shows that
there were expended during the fiscal
year ending June HO, IS9S, $7, 348,795, and
that there still remains of the appro
priations made for the Ordnance Bu
reau 519.793,359. This large sum is de
rived from the appropriations for the
fiscal year, which were made for war
purposes, amounting to $21,504,592.
Regarding the equipment of volun
teers, the general thinks it would be
as well to have the Government equip
them instead of their bringing their
State arms into service, saying that
it could be done as quickly, owing to
the condition of the arms of State
troops.
He speaks in terms of praise cf the
manner in which work has been per
formed in arsenals and ordnance fac
tories in the rush that was made in
putting the country on a footing for
war with Spain. As to the equipment
of an army, he says:
So long as the principal dependence in
this country in a time of war is a large
volunteer force, newly levied, It is im
practicable to keep on hand large supplies
of cavalry, artlllerj and horse equip
ments, as th<-se, in the course of a few
years, will not only deteriorate, but will
have to be materially ftiodifted to keep
pace with improvements. The major part
of such material can, by taking .advantage
of the r< Bourcea of Rock [aland and the
other arsenals and the numerous private
establishments capable of producing it, be
supplied as rapidly as troops can be
raised, mustered into service and prepared
for campaign. There should, however, be

rtion of the harness re

riages cannot be turned out in large num
bers until about six months after Initiat

For equipping an army with a sup
ply of small arms, he thinks there !
should be a supply of 100.000 on hand of I
any new arm and the arsenals kept in
condition so as to produce 2500 per day. j
An Interesting feature of the report j
Is that which treats of coast defenses. >
The general says:
Attention is especially invited to the ex
perience of the last few months In at- !
tempting to provide quickly a coast de- j
fenso. It is believed to be Impracticable, j
and we will always be forced in any emer- !
gency to rely upon what has been pro- j
vided in time of peace. I think it fair to
State, though not In the way of com
plaint, that this has been urged on Con- j
grt-ss for the past ten years.
The situation is very simple. A plan j
has been adopted for providing a complete i
coast defense. With the present faclli
" the department, this work can ho
carried on economically and in the most
efficient manner in smli a way as to com
plete the present plan in about seven i
years. Estimates ought to be submitted
each year for so much of the work as the |
facilities for its production will permit. It
rests with Congress to determine how:
much of the work can be provided for
each year consistently with the resources .
of the country. But the work cannot pro- i
grese faster than the appropriations pro- I
lide for.
It i? probable that there must be added j
to the plans and estimates for the coast I
defense some provision for the defense of |
added possessions.
General Flagler does not claim for the
46-caliber Springfield rifle an equality
with the new .JO-caliber magazine rifle j
of the army, but says that it is a very i
good arm and possesses many merits.
Thia feature has heretofore been com- t
mented upon in discussion of small I
arms used during the war. The ma- j
chinery for the manufacture of small \
arm ammunition was none the best,
yet the department turned out 90.000,
000 rounds for the war. For years past,
the report states, the appropriations j
for equipments of infantry, cavalry, I
artillery and horses have been barely |
sufficient to meet the consumption of I
the regular army, and, although there j
were buildings, there was not machin- i
cry with which to manufacture these
supplies. It was not possible to fill re
quisitions for the volunteer troops j
when made.
Details are given of what was done
to rapidly Increase the coast defenses
when the war began. He calls attention
to the fact that Congress- has never ap- '
propriated what was asked for â powder
and projectiles â and in consequence the
supply at the beginning of th? war was
inadequate, and he gives some in
stances of the work done by the de
partment to make good the deficiency, i
The following statement is made, as to j
powder:
For several years this department has !
â  xperimentlng on smokeless powders
â¢ coast guns, and had completed the 'â 
determination of the specifications and re- i
quirements for the unokeleu powders for 'â 
nearly all the sea coast guns and mortars, i
Some of the powder manufacturers that !
engaged in the production of these experi
mental powders had ample plants for
their production. It was impossible,
however, to produce the powders fast
enough' to meet the emergency, and in
some cases experience in their" use was
necessary for adapting them to all the re- <
quirements of tin- service. All the com- I
panics. however, were ready at once to I
take up the manufacture of the carbon
powders, and as the requirements for this
were simpler, they could expand their
plant for this production more rapidly,
and for a time this department, therefore
devoted all its energies to providing a suf- ]
ficlent supply of the carbon powders
Later, and as fast ns possible, the manu
facture was changed to smokeless
powders.
It should be stated, however, that
smokeless powder only was manufactured i
for field and siege artillery. The fact that I
the field and siege artillery was to be em
ployed was not determined until about the
time that the war was declared, and that
there were no funds available for procuring I

ammunition for these guns before that
time. The preparation of smokeless
powder ammunition for these guns com
menced at once, but is was necessary to
issue immediately the ammunition on
hand for the batteries that were sent to
the front, and as this was all charcoal
powder ammunition, it accounts for the
fact that only this black, or charcoal
powder ammunition was generally used
in actual service against the enemy.
The furnishing of siege and field guns
and ammunition for the war encoun
tered the same difficulties as in other
branches of the ordnance equipment,
yet the bureau furnished such guns for
the Manila and Porto Rican expedi
tions. The artillery was not used at
Santiago to any extent. Of siege guns,
twenty-two were taken for seacoaet de
fenses at the beginning of the war.
General Flagler quotes the following
from the report of Lieutenant Colonel
H. D. Borup, chief ordnance officer at
Santiago, as to the defenses of Santi
ago harbor:
Before the outbreak of hostilities the
port defenses of Santiago consisted of
four antiquated forts, or batteries, of
which oneâ St. Catalinaâ abandoned,
and a second, Punta Blanca, from its po
sition, was useless. Of the other two,
Morro Castle constituted the outer line
and Estrella the inner onÂ«. The arma
ment of the former consisted of five an
cient mortars, and two siege guns, and
the latter of two obsolete castirtm how
itzers, all of feeble power.
After war was declared four batteries
were hastily Improvised, all of weak pro
file.
Including all forts and batteries, the
number of guns may thus be stated:
Obsolete â Bronze, muzzle loading,
smooth bore guns, 6 inch, two; 4.57 inch,
two. : â¢
Mortarsâ l 3 inch, three; 9.5 inch, two.
Muzzle loading converted rifles â Bronze
guns, six; 3 inch, five; castiron howitzers,
eight; 5 inch, seven. .
Modernâ Steel breach loading rifles, six;
3 inch, four; bronze breach loading how
itzers, 6 Inch, two: revolving cannon, 1
inch, four; rapid fire, 1 Inch, one; rapid,
fire, 2 inch, one. Total, thirty-three.
Or twenty-one obsolete and twelve mod
ern pieces; and of the latter four only are I
of comparatively high power.
The exterior line consisted of seventeen
obsolete and two modern pieces, the for- I
mer being furnished by the Spanish "U ar
Department and the latter by the Navy
Department. The bold front put up by j
the former seems to have been effective. j
The real strength, however, lay in the |
guns taken from the Reina Mercedes, so ;
that the duel between the fleet and the i
land forces was practically fought by the I
navy of both powers. After one of these \
guns was disabled by the carriage being j
rendered hors dv combat, the outer de- !
fense was really confined to a single
piece.
Following the above. General Flagler
says:
The war has furnished nn opportunity
for determining by experience the effect
of our modern seacoast armament against
modern battle ships. The reports of the i
experience gained, however, tend to con- j
firm the opinion that the fire from ships j
cannot silence the fire or seriously cripple |
the armament of our modern batteries;
but the ships could not withstand the lire
of our modern batteries, and that, there- j
fore, the ships cannot attack the batteries
successfully. Whether these ships can
run by the batteries without too great
risk has not been shown. This will de
pend upon the skill and rapidity wuh
which the guns are served, provided the
ships are not stopped by tne mines.
Considerable attention is devoted to
the progress of work at the various
arsenals and the guns which are being
made. On September 30, 1898, there
were 447 seacoast guns mounted. It is
estimated that on June 30, 1899, there
will be 900. and on the same date of
1900, 1189.
DAWN OF PROSPERITY
FOR THE_GARDEN CITY
What the Defeat of the Gang Means
to San Jcse and Its
Suburbs.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 13.â Now that the citi
zens of Santa Clara County have abolish
ed gang rule, and county affairs will soon
be under new management, the city and
county will certainly enjoy a boom about
the first of the year. High taxes and
mismanagement of city and county af
fairs have kept new residents away, and
thousands of dollars seeking investment
have gone elsewhere. The victory of the
Republican Good Government League in
Tuesday's election has already done some
good, and the people of San Jose and San
t.i Clara County are convinced that tne
officials they- elected will do their duty.
With public affairs in the right hands San
Jose and suburbs will enjoy the greatest
prosperity during the year 1899. New peo
ple and capital will come, and many al
ready here will improve their places.
The fight for freedom from the evil in
fluecces of politicians In this city and
county has been a long one. The gang
has been in power for years, and the tax
payers have been compelled to support a
large number of useless deputies and oiu
clals. Things went from bad to worse un
der this regime, and San Jose's misman
agement became the laughing stock of tne
State. The School Department and Fire
and Police departments were turned over
to politicians, and positions in them were
assigned as rewards for political work.
This is practically changed now. The
classes who were foremost in ridding the
people of the barnacles on the public
treasuries are determined to advance the
interests of the city and county. The Good
Government league, while a political or
ganization, is also for the purpose of ad
vancing the Interests of the city and
people. The organization will open per
manent headquarters and increase Its
membership. The city will be advertised
abroad as a place to secure investments
for^ capitalists, and ItÃ advantages set
forth. By this means the county will be
settled up. <">n a!! sides tne members of
the organization are beinp congratulated
for their splendid work, for to them all
the credit for the victory belongs.
The ballots in the County Clerk's office '
are being watched day and night
the contest that is to be instituted. As
soon as the official vote is announced by
the Board of Supervisors suit will he com
menced. Evidence of election frauds, it is
claimed, Is plentiful. The league will
contest the election of R. J. Langford as
Sheriff, G. E. Rev as Supervisor from the
First District and J. W. GaSfl as City Jus
tic-. It expects to win these three offices*
and thus add to the overwhelming de
feat of the gang.

KAISER WILLIAM'S
VISIT TO SPAIN
Devoid of Official Sig
nificance.
ASSURANCES FROM BERLIN
HEALTH PRECAUTION FOB THE
EMPRESS.
Diplomatic Circles Fear the Spaniards
May Make a Demonstration
Through Misunder
standing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â 1t is un
derstood that assurances have been
given by the German Government that
I the visit of Emperor William of Ger
many to Spain is entirely devoid of of
ficial character or significance; that
i the official trip of the imperial party
i ended when they left Palestine, and
i that the proposed stop at Cadiz and
' Cartagena is largely a health precau
tion in behalf of the Empress, as the sea
â  trip would be long and arduous if un
broken by these stops at the Spanish
ports. The assurances appear to be
voluntary on the part of the Berlin of
ficials and to be in line with the care
taken in that quarter of late to minim
ize and remove the bad impression
caused by several incidents occurring
during the recent war.
The State Department had not, so far
as is known, taken cognizance of the
Emperor's movements, and certainly
there was no purpose of inquiring as
to the stop in Spain, although this ac
tion by the Emperor was looked upon
as rather inoportune, to say the least,
when the peace negotiations with Spain
are at a critical juncture, and when,
technical^- the war is still in progress.
At the same time Germany has con
stantly reiterated her neutral and
friendly attitude, and the Emperor
himself took occasion in his last ad
dress to the Reichstag to -ive strong
expression to the German purpose to
maintain the strictest impartiality be
tween this Government and Spain.
At the same time the officials here
and in Berlin have recognized that a
strong public sentiment Of animosity
was being developed between the peo
ple of the two countries, and steps have
been taken to offset this as far as pos
sible. The last move in that direction
was at a recent dinner given by Chan
cellor yon Buelow at Berlin to Andrew
D. White, the United States Embassa
dor. and Dr. yon Helleben. the German
Kmbassador to the United States, now
visiting in Germany. It was intended
that the new Assistant Secretary of
State, Mr. Hill, should be one of the
guests, but he was detained in Holland.
Private advices received here by offi
cials state that the meeting was im
portant, as furnishing an opportunity
for a fr-j and full discussion of all the
subjects which have threatened to es
trange the two Governments and for
the establishment of a much more
friendly understanding.
It is recognized, however, among of
ficials. State and diplomatic, that while
official sentiment is satisfactory, there
continues to be an undercurrent of ill
feeling with the and press of the j
two countries. For this reason the pres- ]
ent move of the Emperor in stopping: j
at Spanish ports causes something: of
a shock in diplomatic quarters, as It is
felt to be one more obstacle in the way
of the happy approachment which was j
being executed by the dUthorities here
and at Berlin. It is with a view of^min
imizing the visit that the assurances
are now communicated as to its. non
ofÃcial character.
The Fuge^Ptinn that the Emperor may
be asked by Spain to act as arbitrator
between the United States and Spain,
[:. case the Philippine issue becomes j
acute, is dismissed as absurd, on the j
ground that no such "lan would bo con
sidered for a moment, unless both coun*- !
tries joined in a request for it. The ar
rival of the Emperor at Cadiz and Car
tagena is awaited with considerable ap
prehension by the German authorities, |
as it may give rise to a Spanish ponu- j
lar demonstration open to misunder- j
Btandiner in this country. With a view
of avoiding such an affair, the German !
Charge d'Affaires at Madrid has been
instructed to notify the Spanish Gov
ernment of the strictly unofficial char
acter of the Empprnr's visit.

REYNOLDS' BOMBSHELL
STARTLES THE BOARD
Statements of School Directors Confirm Portions
of His Affidavit-An Effort to Depre
ciate Its Source.
The remarkable affidavit of John C.
Reynolds, published in yesterday's Call,
in which he affirms that $5000 was paid
School Director Samuel L. Waller to in
fluence the votes of seven members of
the Board of Education, created a pro
found sensation throughout the city.
For months an undercurrent of scan
dal has been heard regarding the ac
tion of the directors as to the purchase
of lumber and other articles required
by the department.
For the first time direct allegations
are made. The names of the subsi
dized directors are given and the lump
sum that was paid for "services ren
dered." This latter term Is alleged to
cover all the work done in connection
with the granting of the lease for the
Lincoln School property.
The accused men, men who are not
accused for the first time in their offi
cial careers, deny the charges laid at
their doors. It was not expected they
would acknowledge the guilty part they
played in granting the valuable lease
to Phil Crimmins, James A. Snook and
â E. W. Williams. The accused directors
are Dr. Ragan, Samuel L. Waller, Gal
lagher, Bantel, Burns, Drucker and
Hammond.
There are some matters of record,
however, that will require a lot of ex
plaining away, and the public which
cannot always be hoodwinked, has al
ready drawn its own conclusions re- i
garding them. First among these Is the
explanation of James A. Snook regard
ing a $5000 item on the syndicate's j
books, as being paid to Jacob Samuels
for legal services. Mr. Reynolds af
firmed in his affidavit that this- was the
,amount paid Director Waller and then
charged in the corporation's books.
The public scoffs at the idea that a
new incorporation would pay a lawyer j
$5000 for merely nominal services. The
Southern Pacific with its millions would
not pay so dearly for such a service, j
The leading lights of the bar could be
retained for a much smaller fee.
The marines will be returning shortly j
from Manila and the manipulators j
might tell the story to them. They j
are credited with believing any fairy i
story.
Alexander Vogelsang, attorney for
the Board of Education, affirms that he
called the atttention of Secretary I
Welch and of President Barrington to
the wording of the extraordinary ad
vertisement for bids for the Lincoln I
School property lease, but apparently
not until it was too late to rectify it. I
It was so Jumbled up that none of these â 
ATTORNEY VOGELSANG ENTERS A DISCLAIMER.
i â  â  ' - â â â¢â â¢ Â»
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: Referring to the article published this morning in your valuable paper,
in which is included an affidavit by John P. Reynolds concerning the leasing of the Lincoln School lots by the
Board of Education to the San Francisco Real Estate Investment Company, I beg to say that Mr. Reynolds has
therein done me a great injustice in saying that I prepared or "performed the operation" of jumbling the ad
vertisement for bids as adopted by the Board of Education. I deny the statement in toto and most emphatical
ly, and am at a loss to understand how Mr. Reynolds could have possibly connected me therewith.
I represented the Board of Education in the negotiations for this letting to a considerable extent; but I
had nothing whatsoever to do with the preparation of the advertisement. I was not consulted by any one in
regard to it, and I did not see it until the day after its adoption by the board. On that day I called the at
tention of the secretary, Mr. Welch, to the resolution, and asked him if he could understand what it meant; af
ter perusal he snid he did not. I then asked him how outsiders could be expected to understand it if he, the
secretary of the board, and I, its attorney, could not see what was meant.
Mr. Barrington, the president of the board, came in later and I asked him to read the resolution, and
asked him also if he could tell if he were a bidder, how to frame a proposal to meet the terms of the adver
tisement. He said frankly that he could not, and that the resolution should be changed to express definitely the
board's intention. I mentioned to him the importance of the matter, and that the board mi~ht be criticized
for its action in the premises. He thanked me for informing him of the ambiguous character of the resolution,
and said that in the rush and hurry of business of the night before it had passed without a careful criticism
of its terms. That is a plain statement of the facts, and shows that instead of being the originator of the reso
lution I was the first person to discover that it was ambiguous, uncertain, unintelligible and a "jumble." Yours
faithfully, ALEX. T. VOGELSANG.
men could understand it, and yet that
was the form in which it was submitted
to the outside bidders. Mr. Vogelsang
thus boars out one of the allegations
made by Mr. Reynolds regarding the
manner in which he claims the Board
of Education favored the Real Estate
Investment Company.
Politician Phil Crimmins seems to be
the chief beneficiary under the deal be
tween the Board of Education and the
investment company. Besides beln-;
one of the members of the corporation
he is also a tenant and he gets a "rake
off" going and coming. Under his for
mer lease Crimmins paid $600 a month
for the corner of Fifth and Market,
where he dispenses wet goods to thirsi>
politicians and job-seekers. Since the
property has been under the control if
himself and partners his rent amounts
fa only !?2F>O a month. The reduction is
said by one of the parties interested to
have been brought about in thia way:
CrimminÃ ostensibly pays $600 a month,
but receives a rebate from the company
of $360. This is in payment for "ser
vices" rendered. "When the profits are
divided among the stockholders Crim
mins of course gets his pro rata.
The alleged manipulators commenced
their financiering with apparently
nothing but their own assurance as
working capital. In order to make a
"front" as one of the alleged conspira
tors expressed It, they paid a man for
the temporary loan of a certified check.
It was not the intention to cash this,
but merely to display It like "stage"
money. F<?r the loan of this check and
for the additional sum of $5000 in cash
the syndicate was to turn over 25 per
cent of the entire capital stock of the
investment company, which was 2500
shares. The $5000 is the amount al
leged by Mr. Reynolds in his affidavit
as having been given School Director
Waller and with which he was sup
posed to subsidize the Board of Educa
tion.
James A. Snook, who, Reynolds al
leges, is the moving spirit in the Real
Estate Investment Company, has been
careful to have persons with him whom
he could control. Both O. M. Tupper
and Edward W. Williams are brothers
in-law to him.
The story in The Call yesterday was j
but the entering wedge in what may
result in the most remarkable disclos- ;
ures of official corruption ever laid bare
here. It is expected that the judicial
body, in which is vested the proper j
power to punish crime, will investigate
the charges made by Mr. Reynolds in j
his startling affidavit. The maker of !
the affidavit sticks to his original story
and with the aid of his attorneys will
press his claim for a settlement with
the men for whom he rendered services ,
that secured for them the much coveted
lease. In the pressing of this suit sen
sational developments are expected
which may involve men in high places.
President C. L. Barrington of the xioard
iof Education declares that he never re
ceived any intimation that the Real h.B
i tate Investment Company acquired its
lease on the Lincoln School property by
fraud or bribery. , __
"Until 1 read Reynolds' story in The
Call " said Mr. Harrington, "I had no
idea that any one would charge the Board
of Education or any of its members witn
crookedness in connection with the lease.
I remember all the circumstances at
tending the transaction between the
board and the lessees, and as far as I
know everything was done openly and
above board. 1 voted in favor of leasing
the property to the investment company
for the simple reason that it made the
best offer. I am only slightly acquainted
with the stockholders in the company, and
had no personal or friendly interest in
their success or failure in getting what
they were after.
"As has already been stated, the present
arrangement is decidedly beneficial to
the Board of Education. The city is re
ceiving approximately ?15,000 a year more
from the property than ever before. In
addition to this increased revenue the
board is relieved of all vexatious ques
tions arising over repairs, insurance and
delinquent tenants.
"I knew Reynolds when he was a re
porter about the Oity Hall. He frequently
reported the proceedings of the Board of
Education. I know nothing of his charac
ter or reputation. Some of his statements,
however, strike me as being somewhat pe
culiar. He alleges that Mr. Welch, the
secretary of the Board of Education, was
in the deal with himself and partners, and
that Welch was to put the figures in the
Investment company's bid after it when
the other bids were opened. Reynolds fur
ther charges that Welch opened the bids.
"I think the latter statement is untrue.
I do not remember of one occasion when
the secretary opened bids. The Superin
tendent always breaks the seals on pro
posals and reads them aloud to the board.
In his absence the deputy superintendent
acts. The certified checks which must ac
company bids are also read aloud. The !
papers are then delivered to the secretary
to be filed: the check is retained by the
Superintendent. I am quit sure this rou
tine was not departed from in the Lincoln
lease case."
"The only incident in connection with
the transaction, which has been men
tioned and which I recall, is the ambigu
ity of the advertisement. The 'jumbled'
advertisement as it is called. Attorney
Vngolsang called my attention to this
matter. I was very busy at the time with
the multifarious duties of my office, and
as thf question was wholly in the hands
of the Finance Committee of the b&ard
I gave r.o further attention to it. The
Finance Committee reported in favor of
the investment company and their sug
gestion was adopted by the board.
"My honest belief is that the arrange
ment now in force is the best that could
possibly have been marie. The invest
ment company gave a satisfactory bond
for the payment of the rent and they
contract to expend J-SOOO yearly for repairs
on the property. Regarding the $<500 worth
of plumbing for Crimmins' saloon, men
tioned by Reynolds, I am not aware that
it was paid by the Board of Education."
Charles W. Welch, secretary of the
Beard of Education, denies Reynolds'
charges in so far as they related to him.
"The assertion that I was to fill in the
amount of the bid of the San Francisco
Real Estate Investment Company when
It was handed in is absurd on the face of
it," said Welch, "for the simple reason
that I do not handle the bids at all. The
law requires that all bids shall bÂ§ opened
by the Superintendent of SchoolÃ, and
this is Invariably done.
Mr. Webster opened the bids for the
lease of the Lincoln School property, one
at a time, reading off the bidder and the
amount of the bid and then passing them
to President Barrington. The bids did
not pass through my hands at all, and if
they had I would have had no opportunity
to insert the figures. Had there been any
blank bids Superintendent Webster would
have discovered them when he opened
them, for all bids were sealed and are
only handed In to the Superintendent at
the last minute; they never come to the
secretary's office first.
"All the intending bidders came to me.
some time before the bids were presented
and I gave them all the Information in
my possession regarding the property, its
condition, the tenants and the rental.
But further than that 1 had nothing
I whatever to do with the lease, nor had I
j any understanding with any of the direc
tors, or Reynolds or anybody connected
with the company.
"Even if I was willing to enter into any
I such job I was in no position to render
any service whatever, and people are not
paying out money to anybody unless they
receive something in return for it. It is
! certain that I did not receive a cent in
connection with the lease and did nothing
whatever to aid the successful bidders in
securing it.
"I know Reynolds well, for he was for
merly on the City Hal! detail when he
; was reporting. He came into my office
every day and frequently asked me for
small Joans. Sometimes, when he had
been drinking heavily I refused him; at
other times 1 would let him have $1 or
$~ uO or some such small amount, but that
was the extent of my financial relations
with him."
, "But Reynolds in an interview says
that at the meeting at which the bids for
the Lincoln School property lease were
opened he wrote the sum '$250' on a blot- I
ting pad and passed it over to you with a I
significant nod of the head; that you
read St, whispered to him tfafct you would
like to have that sum, and he replied Â«hat
â  you would receive it If everything (mean
! ing the lease) was all right."
"That is an absolute untruth. Rey
, nolds did not pass me a blotting pad or
anything f-lse, nor did we have any such
; conversation. In fact we did not discuss
â  the lease at all, and I was not aware that
he was interested In it in any manner.'
"I will say this about that lease " said i
Mr. Welch in conclusion. "It is the most
| profitable for the city that has ever been
! entered into for that property. Hereto
fore we have leased the different build
; ings separately, and were always having
trouble with bad tenants. We never se
cured as much rental for the property as
we do under the present lease, and the
! records will show it. The lessees are un-
I der bonds to keep the property in repairâ
I something the city has had to do in the
| past: and now we collect our $4000 per
month in a lump sum without any trou
ble. This was more than the property
was ever leased for before."
"This is a holt frftrn a clear sky'," said"
Dr. Ragan. "I have just finished reading
The Call and I must say I cannot see
what foundation those allegations of Rey
nolds have In fnet. Leaving aside all
questions of bribery, he has got the story
of my connection with the actual trans
action entirely wrong. The records will
show that when the bids for the lease of
the Lincoln School lots were opened I
â¢â  championed the cause of John Mac Donald
I and in the committee of the whole and in
; caucus voted for the acceptance of his
bid. Mac Donald is a friend of mine and a
good man, ar\d I wanted to see him, get
the lease. Mr. Mac Donald threatened to
knock out the bids that were presented on
the ground that the advertisement calling
for them was ambiguous, and I told him
that if he would take such a step I would
back him up in it. When the matter came
before the board, however, he did not ap
pear, and I cast my vote for the syndicate
as the only alternative. Its bid being the
highest presented, and it assured the
School Department treasury a substantial
revenue for several years.
"If money was used in any way in the
transaction I certainly did not know of it
and had no intimation of it afterward un
til I read this morning's Call."
School Director Thomas F. Burns, one
of Waller's alleged solid seven, and who
was mixed up in the lumber scandal, was
seen last night in reference to Reynolds'
charges. He said:
"The story in The Call is all bosh. Wal
ler never bought me and no one else ever
gave me -any money to stand in on the
Lincoln School lease. I voted with the
majority of the board to give the lease to
the investment company, because their
proposition was the best submitted. As a
matter of business, I think the lessees
have got the worst of the bargain. When
the lease was under consideration I was
not acquainted with any member of the
investment corporation and I cannot tell
to-day who are in it.
"My opinion is that Reynolds is a bum,
and, being hard up, he manufactured the
story and sold it. I am not bothering
about it at all. There are no explanations
to be made. Every transaction in con
nection with the lease was wide open and
there were no charges of bribery or cor
ruption at the time. The proceedings of
the Board of Education were open to the
public, reporters were present, and had
there been any shady busines it would
have been discovered at the time.
"I wish to reiterate that I never re
ceived a cent for my vote and I don't
think 'any member of the board was
bought.
"The investment company made the
highest bid and they got the lease."
SPANISH TROOPS ON
THE VERGE OF MUTINY
Ten Thousand Men Declare They Will
Not Return Home Without
Their Pay.
WASHINGTON. Nov. At â Adjutant
General Corbin received a dispatch to-day
announcing that the Eighth Cavalry
sailed this morning from Savannah for
Puerto Principe, Cuba. The regiment will
be the American garrison at Puerto Prin
cipe and Nuevitaa.
In this connection an interesting bit of
information has reached the War Depart-
ment. Arrangements have been made by
the Spanish authoritiet to send back to
Spain the Spanish troops, numbering 9500
men. upon the arrival of the American
garrison. It was expected they would sail
next Tuesday or Wednesday, but an un-
expected obstacle has arisen among the
men themselves. They are on the verge
of mutiny, openly declaring they will not
return to Spain until they have received
their pay, now far in arrears, for service
In Cuba. The mutiny extends not alone
to the enlisted men, but to their officers
and is directed against the executive offi
cials of the Madrid Government on the

San Francisco.DORN, SHERMAN AND FARNUM CONCEIVED A CRAFTY
SCHEME TO "FIX" THE BOARD OF BANK COMMISSIONERS
The Official Investigators Were Placed
Under Obligations by the
Wreckers.
The Conspirators Boasted That Hellman, Brown
and White Did Not Dare Let the
Pacific Bank Go Down.
D. S. Dorn, A. F. Johns and M. H.
Sherman were not only in the busi
ness of silencing some dishonest news
papers, but of corruptly influencing
Bank Commissioners in the great plot
to ruin the Pacific Bank and the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank. The let
ters of Sherman that are published
this morning prove the charge. Over
his own signature M. H. Sherman has
confessed that he schemed to influ
ence the olncial action of Bank Com
missioners W. H. Knight and Charles
Dunsraore.
This plot was one of the most
shameless in the whole history of the
bank wreckers' conspiracy. Two
months before the crash came Sher
man and his confederates thoroughly
understood that any honest investiga
tion of the condition of the banks
would result in the closing of the in
stitutions. They therefore plotted to
procure a favorable report. Nothing
could be done by the dishonest manip
ulators to influence the official action
of A. Gerberd.. ar, who was president at
that time of the Bank Commission.
The wreckers could not fight Mr. Ger
berding and they could not corrupt him.
They contrived therefore to deceive
him if possible.
This dishonest task was assigned to
D. S. Dorn, and he was so successful in
getting Mr. Gerberding out of the
way that Sherman congratulated him
fur his efforts. Sherman also shows in
his remarkable letters that the judg-
ment of Bank Commissioner Duns
more would be influenced by the fact
that Mr. Dunsmore's brother-in-law
had been given employment by Sher
man. Bank Commissioner Knight was
a close personal friend of Sherman,
who craftily remarks in one of his
letters that at a very critical time in
the history of the tottering institutions
he had dined at the home of Mr. Knight
in Oakland. The schemer also took oc
casion to thank J. E. Farnum, the
manager of the People's Bank, for
warning the bank wreckers of the
coming: of the Commissioners. Far
num. who is now the manager of the
defunct Pacific Bank, was a son-in-law
of Bank Commissioner Knight, and
through that relationship secured the
information that was so valuable to
the conspirators.
The warning was given in time to
permit the dishonest bankers to fix
up their affairs with some semblance
of honesty. The letters of Sherman
that give these revelations to the pub
lic are of great importance, and prove
the accusation of The Call that Moses
H. Sherman was not only the chief
agent in ruining the Pacific Bank and
the People's Home Savings Bank, but
knew it, and was as dishonest in his
transactions at that time as were the
McDonalds. Not only was Sherman in
terested in the Phoenix wildcat
schemes and his gigantic Los Angeles
deal, but he was very deeply involved
in assisting other manipulators to
keep up their drain on the banks. In
one of his telegrams he hysterically
begs Dick for God's sake not to dis
honor the checks of O. T. Dyer. In an
other he assures Dick that they must
all stand together, for any disaster at
that time would ruin them all and
their banks.
In this assertion Moses H. Sherman
very clearly indicates that he consid
ered the dishonest institutions as much
his property as they were that of the
McDonalds. There is possibly no more
interesting letter than one which is
published this morning to show the re
markable audacity of Sherman and his
confederates. In this epistle Sherman
declares that the other bankers of this
city, such as I. W. Hellman, Lovell
"White, Thomas Brown and others, did
"ANY DISASTER NOW WILL RUIN US ALL"
While Sherman and his associates were In New York trying to negotiate, the worthless securities of the Pacific Bank. R. H.
McDonald Jr. was In this city on the verge of desperation. O. T. Dyer, manager of the Riverside Bank, was continu

not dare allow the Pacific Bank to go
down, as the ruin of that concern would
provoke a run on the other banks and
in a period of financial uncertainty
such as existed in 1893 the crash of one
bank would destroy the existence of the
others. Sherman counseled, therefore,
if the worst came to the worst, that
| Frank McDonald and J. E. Farnum
â  should go to the other bankers and not
ask but demand their assistance. This
I is not unlike an offense on the highway.
Intermingled with these letters of Sher
man are other plots and plans in which
the grreat manipulator with untruthful
reports and dishonest sentiments suc
ceeded in maintaining his clutch upon
the McDonalds.
SHERMAN'S ABSURD ADVENTURE ON
THE WAY TO NEW YORK.
Sherman very seldom wrote any
thing more serious than nonsense. He
had been sent East to use desperate
measures to relieve the McDonalds and
their bank from the desperate situation
in which he had placed them. Upon his
energies more than upon those of any
other man depended the existence of
two great banks and the safety of the
public's money. Sherman had inspired
the road. He knew its possibilities and
he knew that the Pacific Bank was tot-
U-ring on its foundation. Dick McDon
ald was crying for help in this city
when Sherman went East, and one of
the most important letters that M. H.
Sherman wrote to R. H. McDonald Jr.,
indicating what progress had been
made in the awful struggle for money,
contained the information that Mr.
Sherman had stopped at some way sta
ticn, missed his train and lost his bag
gage. This startling information must
have been a relief to R. H. McDonald
i Jr. The letter is characteristic and is
j as follows:
NEW YORK CITY,
Saturday, Oct. 29, 1892.
My Dear Friend:
Here I am in old New York. It
seems like old times. The rush and
hurry, hurry. You would laugh If
you could see the shape I'm in. At
Buffalo I got out to get something' to
eat and the train wept off and left me.
It took my two bags. I left them in
the sleeper, and hat. etc., etc. Well, I
had to catch another train, but I
wired the conductor to care for ray
things and to bring them here. Thus
far I have not been able to get them. '
But I go to Jersey City soon to see
what I can do in the matter. Thus
far I have seen no one, but I have
written a note to F. V., also one to
Johns, and sent same by messenger
boy. lam anxious to know what F.
V. and the others have done. I sup
pose they write you every day here.
Well, we will all continue to do our
best. It seems strange that I do not
hear anything from you.
Laterâ Have found Mr. J. and have
given him my check for $100 to go
bank and get me some money. No
baggage and broke. One can hardly
help laughing. Hope the next mall
will bring long letter from you and I
will write you what I learn from those
here. <s Hope you are well and not
working too hard. M. H.
"ANY DISASTER AT THIS TIME
WILL RUIN US ALL."
When anything threatened to inter
rupt the flow of gold from the Pacific
Bank to M. H. Sherman or to cut off
the future supply of money for The
southern manipulator he had something
1 more important to tell than the loss of
, his hat. A few days after the fore
going letter was written, R. H. McDon
ald Jr. had come to the conclusion that
he would take a desperate step to save
1 himself from being bled any further by
the Dyers and their Riverside bank.
The situation of Dick in this city was
becoming unendurable. He was re
ceiving from the East words of non
sense and false encouragement, while
his field was becoming smaller and
smaller and he saw himself being cor
nered like a rat in a trap.
To save himself he decided to dfs-
I honor any check that the Dyers made
upon the Pacific Bank, and he so in
, formed the conspirators in New York.

THE GREAT PLOT TO CONTROL THE BANK COMMISSION.
Moses H Sherman was never in ignorance of the fact that his schemes and those of his confederates were ruining the Pacific Bank and the People s Bank.
Shermanlnewthat h banks would not be allowed to continue unless something was done to influence the judgment and control the action of the Bank Com

simile.
must close and consternation ruled in
New York. In this emergency M. H.
Sherman came to the front with a
startling telegram that contained an
encouragement that Sherman knew he
had no right to give. The telegram is
as follows:
NEW YORK, Nov. 3, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr., Vice President
Pacific Bank, San Francisco:
For Gods sake pay all D. checks for
thirty days. Everything depends on
this and keeping all quiet. We will
surely close deal, getting you quarter
million cash now and balance soon.
Relatives and friends of D. here put
ting up part of this money. Also
Chicago friends. Igo to Chicago to
night, returning here soon. McKee
still with us; helping. D. must be kept
here working this deal with us. Any
disaster at this time will ruin us all.
Enemies already on our track, but
everything encouraging here. Keep
mum. We are keeping our plans here
strictly secret from all. M. H. S.
MAINTAINING THE TREMENDOUS
FLOW OF MONEY BY FLATTERY.
Another lying telegram was sent by
Sherman with the purpose of keeping
Dick in line. Day after day went by
and nothing but words came from the
East. Not a cent of money was ob
tained and hundreds of thousands were
needed Sherman knew his game and
made flattery take the place of cash.
The following telegram was sent to
tickle Dick into silence:
December 3, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P. Pacific
Bank. San Francisco: Return from
Boston first of week. Your beautiful
letters all received. Am toiling con
stantly. Hope close up deal very soon.
J. is working night and day with us.
Don't see how we could do without
him. We well appreciate that we must
get you this money quickly. Please
be patient, for you will surely be the
winner In the end as a reward for your
faithfulness to us all. M. H.
PLACING BANK COMMISSIONER
DUNSMORE UNDER OBLIGATIONS.
On April 30, 1893, M. H. Sherman
wrote an exceptionally important let
ter, indicating that he had placed Bank j
Commissioner Dunsmore under such
obligations to him that the Commis- |
sioner seemed very anxious to please j
Sherman in every possible way. The !
Commissioners has just finished their
examination of the Pacific and the
People's banks. Less than two months
of life remained for the institution and
Sherman in writing to Frank McDon
ald did so to Indicate his pleasure that
the ordeal of examination had passed
so successfully. Sherman had re
turned from his foolish trip to the East
and as a matter of fact had done noth
ing, except to be busy. His letters
were written simply to flatter R. H.
McDonald Jr. into inactivity. All of
the epistles were of the same kind and
had no special meaning, except the one
indicated. The letter that relates to
the Bank Commissioners is as follows:
Sunday morning, April 30, 1893.
The Baldwin, San Francisco, Cal.â
My Dear F. V.: 1 go south to-day.
Would have gone before only it seemed
best to all that I wait here until
after the Bank Commissioners were
through.
The Commissioner, whose home
is in Los Angeles, is under obliga
tions to us for favors there; also
his brother-in-law is in our em
ploy there. Dunsmore's brother
in-law and Mr. D. seem very anx
ious to please us in every way pos
sible.
They praised the improvement
in the bank's condition, only criti
cising the matter of too much
money having been put in of late
in the Mohawk canal and a few
things like that.
In the other matters your brother
tells me he has written you. I asked
him to please not do so until he
(himself) and myself had made up our
minds for sure that we wanted to do
anything, because it was useless to
spend a whole lot of time writing
letters and sending telegrams and then
not doing anything. As the matter
now stands it Is decided that when I
reached Chicago 1 am to run over to
New York and see you and talk mat
ters all over to you there and we see
what is best. Really. I am not so
particular about it. One day I think

THE GREAT PLOT OF THE WRECK
ERS TO MUZZLE THE BANK
COMMISSIONERS.
It is probable that M. H. Sherman
never wrote in his life a letter of great
er public interest than the one he ad
dressed to Frank V. McDonald on April
26, 1893, in this city. In this letter
Sherman shows that the conspirators
who ruined the Pacific and People's
banks not only tried to deceive the
Bank Commissioners but to bribe them.
As Sherman tells the story in his letter
the wreckers outlined a certain and a
very definite plan of action. According
to this plan D. S. Dorn was to get Bank
Commissioner A. Gerberding out of the
way.
Gerberding had always been a thorn
in the sides of the schemers. Every
epithet their tongues could command
was applied to him for his vigilance in
watching the affairs of the two banks
and demanding from the bank robbers
a strict accounting for their action.
Whenever Gerberding appeared the
wreckers trembled and Sherman, in the
letter that will follow, declares that D.
S. Dorn did clever work in getting Ger
berding out of the way. Dorn's suc
cess was, however, only part of the
tremendous task that these men had
undertaken. J. E. Farnum, the mana
ger of the People's Home Savings Bank,
was to warn the conspirators in time
and to let them know when the Bank
Commissioners might be expected, so
that these manipulators who were de
liberately wrecking two great institu
tions might make their necessary prep
arations for the visit of the official in
vestigators.
It should not be forgotten that J. E.
Farnum was the son-in-law of Bank
Commissioner Knight. Sherman con
gratulates Farnum for having done his
part of the work. The other details of
the plot were left to Sherman himself.
As already explained he declared that
he had placed Bank Commissioner
Dunsmore under obligations to him for
personal favors received and for having
placed Dunsmore's brother-in-law in
the Los Angeles Bank. Sherman was
also a close friend of Bank Commis
sioner Knight and declared that he had
done his duty when he dined at the
home of Bank Commissioner Knight.
This in outline was M. H. Sherman's
confession of the plot that the bank
wreckers concocted to prevent an hon
est criticism of the institutions that
they were ruining. The result of the
plot is described by M. H. Sherman in
the following letter that was written
on April 26. 1893:
THE BALDWIN,
San Francisco, Cal., Wednesday.
My Dear F. V.: I wculd have
been away from here two or
three days ago but for the ex
aminers examining F. B. We
are all very anxious that the
examiners praise us and that they
help us. I think it will do
good. I was at Mr. X.'s (Oak
land) to dinner last evening and
am invited there this evening.
Your brother tells me that the
board seems very kindly disposed
so far. D. S. helped manage it so
that Mr. G. did not come to the
bank with the others (only two).
Mr. Farnum is just as good and
kind as he can be and found out
(in advance) that they were com
ing and let us all know, so get
ready.
He and your brother seem to be get
ting on finely now and there seems no
friction of any kind. D. S. is going
off on his vacation soon. Everything
seems as usual. There seems to be a
kind of quarrel or something between
your brother and Mr. Norton of Yuma.
Your brother has ordered him to stop
expense there and refuses to send
money down. This, so I am told,
seems to have made Norton angry and
he is kicking. I have been appealed to
to say what you agreed to do
when you was there. I refuse to talk
or get mixed up. The fact is R. H.
Jr. is trying to economize. You know
Norton Is a fine man, but he seems
to think you have no end of millions
for him to draw on. I understood your
brother to say that he was going to
send Dr. J. down there and pay off
things and have expense shut off. I
have taken great painsâ you see I hap
?en to be with you and heard some of
he conversationâ not in any way
interfere when appealed to as to what
I heard.
We don't want it to appear to
outsiders that we are quarreling
among ourselves at this critical
time.
Perhaps it Is no harm to let Dr. J.
fight it out there with them. You
know best what to do. Please do not
think I am mixing up In what Is none
of my business. I only want to help
harmonize things if I can. Very truly,
M. H.
SHERMAN SCHEMES AGAIN TO DE
CEIVE THE BANK EX
AMINERS.
On May 20, 1893, M. H. Sherman
wrote Frank McDonald another letter
deceiving the young banker in refer
ence to affairs in Los Angeles, and ex
plaining, also, how the Bank Commis
sioners had been imposed on by the
transfer of Phoenix bonds. Excerpts
from the letter are as follows:
LOS ANGELES, May 20, 1893.
My IVar F. V. : 1 fully realize the
situation East. My hair has stood on
end for the past two months, as every
morning I take up the daily newspa
per and look over the condition of
financial affairs in tho East.
Referring to the Phoenix matter I
suppose that others have written you
fully about it.
I was not so particular in re
gard to it, but the way matters
stood it seemed almost impera
tively necessary that certain of
the securities should be trans
ferred to the P. H. 8., and as at
that time the B. C. were giving us
much annoyance and were de
manding certain things it seemed
the only thing to do. They
mads me sign a guarantee which
was as binding as a promissory
note and made me make certain
agreements with regard to the com
pletion of the plant at an early
day, etc., etc.
This Phoenix proposition Is all right
and the present bond issue there, cov
ering, as it does, much more than the
old issue did. is really a much more
conservative and safer bond issue
than is the one hero from Los Ange
. les. The S. P. is spending an enor
mous amount of money at Santa
Monica, and their large ocean steamers
are now loading and unloading freight
at their new wharves there. Hoping to
see you soon, 1 am. very truly,
M. H. SHERMAN.
"BROWN AND HELLMAN DO NOT
DARE LET ANYTHING HAP
PEN TO OUR BANKS."
The astounding audacity of M. H.
Sherman was shown in a letter that
he wrote to Frank V. McDonald on
May 21, 1893, a month and a day be
fore the Pacific Bank and its feeder,
the People's Bank, went down with a
crash. Frank McDonald had written
to Sherman telling him of the precari
ous condition of the institution and
begging for some assistance. Sher
man's electric road and his Phoenix
and Mohawk ventures had absorbed
enough money from the two banks to
ruin them. Sherman had traveled East
to deceive the McDonalds into a be
lief that he was trying to negotiate
bonds which he knew were not nego
tiable.
The end was approaching, and Frank
asked for his advice. Sherman had
preyed upon the McDonald banks for
over two years, and the advice he
sent back was most extraordinary. He
declared that the other banks of San
Francisco would not dare let the Paci
fic Bank go down, and could be forced
or in other words threatened to supply
the Pacific Bank with money. Sher
man declared that the ruin of the Mc-
Donalds would create a panic in the
State, and that Hellman, Brown and
other local bankers would put up the
funds rather than see the McDona-lds
go under. Having given this advice,
Sherman made another play for more
money for his Phoenix venture. The
letter Is most interesting, and is as
follows :
LOS ANGELES. May 21, 1893.
My Dear F. V.: It is such a busy
Hfe. No rest, but toil, toil all the time,
and F. V. we do try, oh, so hard. It
has sometimes sppnied that the con
stant worry, work and annoyance
would Just kill me. but when it s.eems
that my life was hard, then I think
of you and of all you are .going
through. Well, the good Lord knows
why. I suppose we must have this
discipline. Then I think of San Fran
cisco so much.
F. V., those men, Brown, Hell
man and the others don't dare, that
is the way it seems to me, let any
thing happen to our banks. The
memory of the Bank of California
failure must be green in their
memory. That failure brought
down others. If it should go abroad
in this State that anything had
had happened to the rich McDon
alds think of what a panic it would
cause among depositors generally
and the other banks would have to
look out.
No, F. V. And If you find you
know all about the situation, I know
nothing about the inside of things; I
never ask only where I can help; the
banks are ever in a hole. You must
let us know in time and Farnum and
your brother â Farnum is on very
friendly terms with many of those
menâ must go and see the other San
Francisco men. My idea is that Mr.
White would help. He has a pile of
money idle I am told and get help
in season. Of course, we must not do
this unless absolutely necessary.
From what your brother tells me
things are improving much. I have
never felt quite sure if he told me
these things to encourage me or if
really things were getting so much
better in fact. Well, you know what
is best, better than I can tell you.
Forgive me for seeming to mix up in
affairs as I may have seemed to do in
this letter. And now a word as to the
Phoenix Water Company. We should
have levied an assessment long ago,
but Hine would not agree to it. But the
city has been growing so and so much
has had to be put in in extensions that
this Is absolutely necessary now.
Finally he has agreed to it, i. c., to a
$6000 assessment, $2000 each. The in
terest on the bonds comes due in nine
daj's. We must be prompt in it, it
hurts so to have any delay. If you
will wire me that you will pay in $2000,
then I will pay in $2000 and I will see
that Hine does the same. Let's have
it agreed that the. $6000 is paid into
P H. S. B. to be used to pay interest,
1. c., pay coupons and for nothing else,
eh. Sincerely, M. H.
The plots of M. H. Sherman did not
end with his boast of ability to cor
rupt Bank Commissioners and to
"stand up" reputable citizens who
were fearful of the methods he employ
ed. The Call will show to-morrow
that Mr. Sherman was also an adept,
or assumed to be such, in influencing
Legislatures through the assistance of
his great ally, the Southern Pacific
Company. ____________

A PHENOMENAL OCTOBER.
THE effects of the Republican triumph through
out the country are already apparent. AH
along the line a general quickening in trade is
noted. The result is accepted not only in this coun
try, but in Europe, as a sign that sound financial prin
ciples will continue to rule in the United States, and
that visionaries and theorists will have no voice in
shaping the commercial and monetary affairs of the
nation. England was quick to perceive this, and as
soon as the result of the elections was definitely
known English buyers appeared in Wall street and
bought stocks and bonds heavily. The Continent,
too, shared the confidence of the English, and pur
chased freely. Under this foreign demand for our
securities the whole market showed pronounced im
provement. On Thursday the sales of stocks on the
Exchange were over 700,000 shares, and of bonds
about $10,000,000, the largest bond dealings in the
history of the New York Stock Exchange. The sus
pension of business on election day, however, told
upon the country's bank clearings, which showed a
falling off for the week of 6.9 per cent The week's
failures were 187, against 273 for the corresponding
week in 1897.
In spite of the depressing influences of the ap
proaching election, however, October was a phenom
enal month, showing the largest volume of trade for
any October, and the largest ever known in any
month except December, 1892. The railroad earn
ings showed a gain of 5.2 per cent over October, 1807,
and foreign trade an increase of 20 per cent. The
consumption of iron during the month was also the
largest' on record, footing up 1,019,646 tons. At
present writing, however, the iron trade is quieter.
The other staples, while rather more active than
for some time back, are not in a very satisfactory con
dition. Cotton remains at the lowest prices on rec
ord, with heavy receipts and a small demand on mill
ing account. Wool still labors under the depressing
influence of large foreign and domestic supplies, and
as holders generally decline to give concessions to
buyers, the market remains dull, though business is
not as depressed as it was some time ago. Wheat fell
off somewhat in price, though the exports from the
country were larger than during the same week in
1897. The distributive trade of the country con
tinues fair on the whole, while in the West and
Northwest it keeps up to its old remarkable volume.
The money market is in good shape, the large ex
ports creating a feeling of confidence in the future of
funds. In this connection the monthly summary of
commerce and finance, just issued by the Treasury
Bureau of Statistics, will be read with interest by
every patriotic American. During the nine months
ending September 30 the country increased its ex
ports $123,000,000 and decreased its imports by $113,
000,000. To Europe we increased our sales from
$568,805,159 to $666,986,539, while our purchases were
cut down from $332,394,984 to $240,863,714- To North
America our sales increased from $94,862,860 to $108,
931,837, while our purchases fell from $84,511,466 to
$76,048,519. To South America our exports in
creased from $24,871,545 to $25,323,942, while our im
ports from that part of the world fell from $78,656,
642 to $63,513,873. To Asia and Oceanica our ex
ports increased from $45,784,340 to $54,495,383; our
imports also increased from $85,004,867 to $88,259,960,
this being mostly due to an increase in imports of
raw silk for use in the factories of the United States.
To Africa our sales increased from $11,934,338 to
$13Â»555,Â°75. while our imports decreased from $8,186,
980 to $6,674,827.
The above is one of the very finest showings ever
made by the United States, and it is this which creates
such a widespread feeling of confidence in the future.
The local situation shows no marked change. The
continued dry weather is causing uneasiness among
farmers and stock men, as the grass has disappeared
from the ranges and the ground is too dry for plow
ing in many sections of the State. It is yet altogether
too early to talk about a dry winter, but last winter's
experience has made the farmer cautious. Country
credits have not yet been affected, however, and col
lections keep up to their normal standard. Still, the
country needs rain, and until it comes the tendency
will be toward conservatism all around.
The leading staples of the State are about in the
same condition as in the East Wheat has fallen off
in sympathy with Chicago, and barley has also weak
ened. Oats, however, have advanced. A slight de
cline in hides is noted. Hopes have advanced, but
wool is still in the dumps. Provisions show no
change whatever, but hogs have gone up slightly.
The dried fruit market remains dull, but raisins are
very firm at a further advance. Dairy produce is
shewing the effects of the dry weather, and the ten
dency now is toward higher prices. Outside of these
items the local situation exhibits little of interest.
The hanging of thirteen West Africans for the mur
der of missionaries calls to mind and strengthens be
lief in a chestnutty old theory.
It is pleasing to learn that Victoria is fond of
American girls, but far more important to know that
we like them, too.
CONSULTING THE ORACLES.
IN the confusion of its thoughts and feelings, and
suffering from the stress of conflicting emotions
surging around a dazed brain, the Examiner has
been consulting many oracles to find an explanation
of the defeat of its fused factions on election day.
These oracles it has diligently sought out in widely
j separated quarters, but as yet it has found no comfort.
I Wherefore, out of pity for its state and in the hope
of putting an end to its howls, we offer a suggestion.
The Examiner can find in the New York Journal
of November 4 a review of the political situation,
which, if not wise, is at any rate suited to its under
standing and therefore more useful to it than a wiser
statement would be. The Journal of that date, in a
screaming editorial headed, "The Lines of Cleavage,"
declared the 'masses of the people to be divided on
the same lines throughout the Union, and it prophe
sied a sweeping victory for fusion everywhere.
"The tide of revolt against Republicanism that is
sweeping Van Wyck toward Albany," said the Jour
nal, "is not a local phenomenon. It is a national
movement It is felt from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific." Further on it declared: "The lines of cleav
age are the same in New York as in California, and
the same in each State as in the whole Union."
After asserting that the Republican party is always
and everywhere the party "of corruption and of gov
ernmental meddling with individual liberty and of
overgrown bossism," it went on to say: "The people
are learning at last what the new Republicanism
means. With the glittering historical associations
it has fraudulently misused stripped off, they see it as
it is â an abhorrent creation of organized greed, and
they are resolved to have no more of it."
Here is an explanation ready made in a yellow slop
shop and so suited to the Examiner it is strange it has
not been adopted by that organ and reprinted as its
own. The prophecy of Van Wyck's victory and the
announcement that he was then being swept to Al
bany by a tidal wave were false, but not more false
than the rest, and do not detract from the merit of
the whole.
The Examiner should brace up, be true to its New
York ally and maintain that the election of Gage in
California and Roosevelt in New York were the re
sult of a line of cleavage running throughout the
Unionâ a line which puts the great majority of the
American people on the side of corruption, of gov
ernmental meddling with individual liberty, of over
grown bossism, and makes them members of "an
abhorrent creation of organized greed."
DEMOCRATIC FUTILITY.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that while some of the Democratic leaders now
in that city are hopeful that Republican control
of the House will enable the Democrats and their
allies in that body to get along through the coming
Congress without wrangling and increasing the fac
tional divisions of the party, others are by no means
so sanguine.
There are evidences that an attempt will be made
to get rid of the leadership of Bailey of Texas and
tc substitute in his place, if not a stanch gold Demo
crat, at least one who will be willing to subordinate
the silver question and seek for other issues on which
to make the campaign of 1000.
The situation reveals in a striking manner the
utter futility of the Democratic party under its pres
ent leadership. It has clearly no guide to follow and
no principles by which its action is to be determined.
The men who propose to save their party from the
folly of the Bryan movement have no wisdom
greater than that of the folly which they reject. Ac
cording to reports that come to us they propose to
wait until the administration has acted and then
oppose it in everything, in the hope that it will at
some time commit blunders which can be turned to
the advantage of the opposition.
Without principles there can be no integrity of
life for parties any more than for individuals, and
without integrity there can be no force sufficient to
accomplish any useful work in the world. Even as an
opposition party Democracy will be futile and effect
less so long as it has no definite policy to support and
no tactics of opposition other than those of indis
criminate fault-finding with everything that is done.
Whether Bailey be re-elected to the leadership of
the minority of the House can be a matter of but
little importance to the country at large. He did not
show any distinguished statesmanship or even any
parliamentary force during the last session of Con
gress. He is as good a man as any that his party has
in the House, but no better than some others.
Therefore, whether he be voted up or voted down
concerns the mass of people very little.
It is a matter of concern, however, that one of the
great parties of the country should have degenerated
hopelessly into a faction of discontent without any
well denned policies or principles. Two years from
now we shall have to confront this same mass of con
fused factions in another political contest. Then
again there will be from its orators and organs a
thousand promises of reform and a thousand as-
saults upon the administration. It will be well, there
fore, that public attention should be directed stead
fastly to the action of its Representatives in Congress
in order that the futility and inefficiency of the party
and of its allies may be fully understood.
IMMIGRATION STATISTICS.
DESPITE the improved condition of industry
in the country and the superior attractiveness
to foreign labor, it appears from the report of
the Immigration Bureau that the number of immi
grants who entered the United States during the last
fiscal year was less by 1563 persons than in the pre
vious year. The decrease is not great, but, consider
ing the general expectation that immigration would
increase with the revival of prosperity, even so small
a diminution as that is a pleasing evidence that the
former rush of the unemployed from Europe to this
country has been to a considerable extent checked.
None the less, the immigration of the year was
sufficient to constitute a good-sized city if all had
settled in one locality. The total amounted to 135,
755 males and 93,534 females, or 229,289 in all. Of
this number 3030 were debarred from admission for
various causes. The report of the Commissioner
shows further that 43,057 # could neither read nor
write, and that 96,203 had less than $30 each.
Of the whole number of arrivals 58,613 came from
Italy, 27,221 from Russia proper, 25,128 from Ire
land, 17,111 from Germany, 16,659 from Hungary,
12,420 from Galicia and Burkowina, in Austria-
Hungary, 12,398 from Sweden, and 9987 from Eng
land.
The laws regulating the admission and naturaliza
tion of immigrants appear from the statements of the
Commissioner to be in much need of further amend
ment. He recommends that immigrants who are
excluded because afflicted with a loathsome or a
dangerous contagious disease should be summarily
returned and deprived of the right of appeal; that
the head tax should be increased to $2 so as to pro
vide a revenue large enough to defray the cost of
extending the operations of the bureau; that a more
THE SA3* FRAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1898.
stringent watch be kept upon Immigration from Can
ada, and that every immigrant be provided with a
certificate containing the date of his arrival, which he
shall be obliged to show when he applies for natural
ization papers.
It is gratifying to note that out of the large num
ber of immigrants who arrived at our ports during
the year it was found that only seventy-nine were as
sisted immigrants and only 417 were contract la
borers. Those, of course, were turned back. That
the number of this class of applicants for admission
to the country was so small is an evidence that the
laws prohibiting that kind of immigration have had
a good effect. In times past such immigrants were
numbered by the thousands. It is also to be noted
that among the arrivals only two convicts were de
tected. Europe, it seems, has been forced to quit
using this country as a dumping ground for her
criminals.
BY the sweeping victories of last Tuesday the
Republicans have been assured control in the
ne*t Congress of all branches of the Govern
ment. The way is at last clear for the enactment of
legislation to carry out the great policies to which
the party is pledged. A hostile Senate after the
fourth of next March will no longer stand in the way
of currency reform and block the progressive policies
of the administration. The way will be free to write
upon the statute books every law which Republican
statesmanship can devise for the welfare of the na
tion and the prosperity of the people.
Under these conditions the Republicans will
occupy a position similar to that held by the Demo
crats in 1892, when Cleveland took office with his
party in control of both the House and the Senate.
The country will now have an opportunity to see the
difference between government by an organized and
harmonious party and government by a combination
of factions united only for the sake of winning office
and disagreeing among themselves upon not only
every policy but every principle of action. We shall
have in Congress none of that discord and strife
which led Mr. Cleveland to denounce the hewing
and hacking of the Wilson bill as "perfidy and dis
honor"; neither shall we have any of that wrangling
which disturbed the country, harassed industry and
led eventually to the stormy agitations of Bryanism,
which disrupted Democracy and drove its wisest
leaders into retirement.
With the restoration of Republican control there
will be a return to safe and well ordered progress.
The remaining session of the present House will be
too short for it to undertake much, and, moreover,
the antagonism of the Senate will prevent it from
doing anything in the way of constructive legisla
tion. This will perhaps entail the calling of the next
Congress to meet in extraordinary session, and such
a course is already talked of. Certainly there are
many important issues to be dealt with, and they can
not be settled too speedily.
Most important of all the issues before the admin
istration is the enactment of legislation that will pro
vide for the long desired reform of our currency. The
need of a prompt settlement of this issue is of it
self sufficient to justify an extra session. Next in
order should be the fulfillment of the long delayed
pledge of the Republican party to promote the ship
building industry and the expansion of our merchant
marine. Along with these there may be expected
provisions for an increase of our naval strength and
the construction of the Nicaragua canal.
The consciousness that the government of the
republic is in safe hands and that the problems which
have so long been vexatious to industry and enter
prise will now be solved by a wise statesmanship will
add much to the confident feeling of the people and
encourage the undertaking of great enterprises. The
prospective legislation of Congress may, therefore,
be accounted among the factors already operating for
the general good. No doubts are felt concerning the
future. The people are assured that the new era
which began with the election of McKinley is moving
steadily toward the noontide of prosperity, and in
that assurance will go about their work full of the
vigor that is born of courage and hopefulness.
WITH the present display the Oakland exposi
tion, which in times past has been confined to
the industries of Alameda County, becomes a
State exposition, and includes as far as possible ex
hibits of all the industries of California. At every
stage of its career the enterprise has merited public
patronage and support, but now that it has grown to
be something more than a local affair, its claims are
more forceful and more far-reaching than ever.
At this particular period of our development we
can never do too much for home industries. We can
never display them too often, nor too often impress
upon the people the importance of making Califor
nia a home market for home products. There was a
time when we produced few manufactured goods and
were compelled to purchase them from abroad, and
there may come a time when our manufactories will
be so strong they will not need the support of local
patriotism. The first of those times, however, has
passed away, and the other has not yet arrived. We
have the home factories, but the home market is not
responsive to them. Therefore at this time every
display of California goods that impresses the minds
of her people is a public benefit.
Competent experts estimate that upward of $100,000
a day is sent out of California to purchase manu
factured articles of a kind that are produced of an
equally good if not better quality at a cheaper price at
home. We have a larger manufacturing industry
than our people are aware of, but it is as yet far short
of what it should be. To support what we have and
to promote a further development of the industry by
consuming home goods rather than those of
foreign make is a matter which appeals, as Bacon
said, "to both the bosoms and the business of men."
It affects at once their patriotism and their financial
interests.
The Oakland exposition, even if regarded merely
as an entertainment, will well repay those who attend
it. Anything like a- comprehensive display of the
products of California could not be otherwise to in
telligent men and women. If there were no other
issue involved than that of amusement, therefore, the
exposition should be well patronized. The instruc
tive features of the display, however, must not be
overlooked by any one. We have a State richer in
resources and natural gifts than any other in the
Union, and it will be our own fault if we do not make
it also richer in all the attainments of art and industry.
Reports that Blanco is to leave Cuba, and that the
Spanish Government is about to send money there to
pay the soldiers, seem to conflict. Perhaps, however,
Blanco will await the money and leave in company
with it.
The Oakland Exposition, which has now grown to
be an exhibit for all California, is a proof of what can
be done for the State by persistent energy. When
home people resolve on a home market they will
have it
PROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION.
THE OAKLAND EXPOSITION.
THE LORD GOD'S GOLD.
Quoth the Maker of All as He fashioned the world:
" Now where shall I hide my gold
From the fingers and eyes of that creature, Man,
Who, alas, may be overbold
And likely to search for the glittering stuff
Of which he will never h.-- half enough?
Then He pondered the matter for many a day
Until He devised a plan
By which He might circumvent the schemes
Of His greedy plaything, Man.
Then He ordered His glorious angels forth.
And some went West while others went North.
And the last took the gold from the vaults of the Lord
And they hid it 'neath river and hill;
Then they planted the land with the hemlock and spruce.
And the north wind, bitter and chill,
Had covered the whole with a mantle of ice
Before they were gathered in Paradise.
And the nights had been lengthened to hideous nights
While the days had been cleft in twain.
" This place," said the Lord, "is my treasure house
And it shall not be oped again;
And he who would prospect this ice-bound land
Shall carry his life in als puny hand."
But His love had gone out to the new-born West,
So the Lord said: "Let it be.
If the gold be found I have treasured there ,
It matters not much to me.
But the gold in the North is the Lord God's gold
Which none shall seek but the overbold."
And for ages the seals lav undisturbed
On the treasure in North and West;
For men would speak of the former land
As a loveless land at best.
And no one knew that the gold of the Lord
In the Western treasure house was stored.
And men were glad in the early days
When the gold lust was unknown;
And many have lived to curse the hour
' When in man's breast were sown,
Through dreams, a thirst for the golden ore
And a hope for a peace he would know no more.
For it lured them forth from the fruitful field*
And they wandered everywhere;
They found the gold that was stored in the West
But there wasn't enough gold there
To suit their needs, and so, undismayed,
On the Lord God's gold they made a raid.
For rumors had come from the white-robed North,
And traveled from land to land,
That gold was hid 'neath the moss-veiled ice
To satisfy each demand.
And hardly a village but sent its man
To follow the gold-drunk caravan, *
They fought their way o'er the snow and the Ice,
Over mountains and terrible streams;
And many a one lay down to die
Still far from the scene of his dreams.
"One man in ten," the Lord had said,
"Shall forfeit be." And the trail grew red.
For the Lord was wroth that His plaything, Man,
Should covet forbidden ground,
Nor the mountains' frowns, nor the horrible gloom.
Nor the silence He hung around
Like a deadening shroud could keep him out
Of the land he had dreamed such dreams about.
Nor hardships, starvation, toil, nor death.
Nor the fang of a biting cold,
Could keep him back from the sought-for land
Or lessen his thirst for cold.
And each man said as he la hed at the sky
"My fate 1b to live, though others ma- sjs.
And thus it is and ever will be
That nine will pay the toll
If one but rifle the treasure-house
Of the Lord God near the Pole.
For the lust for gold is a thing that grows,
And a man is a man, as the Lord God knows

NEWS OF FOBEIGN NAVIES.
The Edgar, first class cruiÃer of 7350
tons, has just had a refit at an expense
of 550,000. She had been in continuous
commission since 1893, and her recent per
formance at the commission trial resulted
in 8996 horsepower and 18.8 knots, which
was considered highly satisfactory by the
British naval authorities.
The experiments with oil as a substi
tute for coal are not proving very satis
factory in the British navy. The tor
pedo-boat destroyer Surely has been
fitted with oil feeders to the boilers and
the latest trial with oil firing under two
boilers gave only 900 horsepower, against
2000 horsepower where coal was used.
The Pactolus. third class cruiser of 2135
tons, buTTt at Elswick for the British
navy, has developed greater horsepower
and speed than any of this class of light
vessels just completed. The contract
stipulated 7000 horsepower and 20 knots
under full power, but at her trial in the
channel the engines developed 7201 horse
power and gave a speed of 20.5 knots,
notwithstanding the ship was running in
the teeth of a rough sea. The ship was,
however, not down to her normal draught
within sixteen inches, and was drawing
only 15 feet 8 inches aft, against 17 feet
when ready for sea.
Since 1864, when the Rolf Krake coast
defense ship was built in England for the
Danish navy, Denmark has built its own
war vessels, except some torpedo-boats.
It was the first in leading the way in the
evolution of a new type of armor-clad, as
exemplified in the Tordenskjold, turret
ship of 2400 tons, in which the guns were
heavily protected and the hull had no side
armor, the protection of the interior of
the ship below water being effected by a
heavy protective deck. The Italians fol
lowed up this system in the Lepanto and
Italia, and the plan has many able ad
vocates in the several navies, who be
lieve the gun protection to be of para
mount importance.
It is a common complaint among officers
in the British navy that as the ships in
crease in size the quarters of officers be
come more contracted. The additional
space is utilized in giving more room to
the crews and making the facilities of
communication between the decks more
easy, while ventilators, coaling chutes,
etc., also demand more room in the latest
ships than formerly. There is less diffi
culty in berthing crews on British ships
than In any other of the European navies,
owing to the fact that the ships of Great
Britain carry relatively less men. In the
French navy 26 per cent more men are
carried per 1000 tons displacement, and In
the Russian navy 50 per cent more are
carried than In British war vessels.
Frequently two men have to sleep In one
hammock In some of the foreign navies,
and In the Russian ships part of the crew
sleep on deck.
The French turret-ehlp lena was
launched at Brest September 1, her keel
having been laid last January. This
would appear to be pretty quick work on
a ship of 12,052 tons, but the launch of a
v.essel Is not always an Indication of her
completeness and it may be a mere shell
when placed In the water. The lena is an
improved Charlemagne and is 400 feet 9
Inches in length, 69 feet 2 Inches breadth
and 27 feet 6 inches draught aft. She will
be fitted with three engines of 15 500
horsepower collectively to drive her at a
speed of 18 knots. The normal coal sup
ply is 820 tons, with a bunker capacity of
1100 tons, giving a calculated radius of ac
tion at 10 knots of 5200 and 7000 knots re
spectively. There is no wood whatever
used in the construction of the hull and
principal flttlngs. The armor belt Is 14
inches, tapering to 6 inohes at the ends,
and the armor above protecting the minor
guns is from 5 inches to 3 inches. The
lena carries a multitude of guns, namely

The appointment of Lieutenant Mlchael
! Culme-Seymour to the Queen's yacht Vlc
i torla and Albert, revives the old story of
1 the alleged secret marriage of his eldest
| sister Mary to the Duke of York. No
other satisfactory explanation can be of
fered for the continued and extraordinary
; tokens of royal favor extended to the
Seymour family. The father, Admiral
Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, has been
: promoted from the companionship of the
' order of the Bath to a knight commander,
! and thence to the dignity of the Grand
: Cross thereof, and has, in addition, been
i appointed to the command-in-chief of
j the Portsmouth naval station, which Is
! the most sought for a"hd most lucrative
i service in the British navy. The appoint
j ment of his son to the Victoria and Albert
! will entitle the young man to the pro
i motion of commander in two years. He
! will then be thirty-three years of age,
and the favors shown this young officer
are naturally galling to other older naval
officers more capable but less fortunate
i in not having a royal pull. A commander
of 33 years of age is not an unusual thing
!in foreign navies where promotion is
: made by selection, but in the United
States navy it is an Impossibility. The
youngest commander in our navy Is 50
years of age, and some have reached the
ripe age of 55 with no prospect of getting
â  a higher rank than that of captain.

ARREST OF A FLOUR THIEF
A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT THAT
DID NOT COME OFF.
The Sad Mishap of a Geyserville Man
and His Paul Revere
Ride to Save His
Bride.
Somebody turned the* leaves of the al
manac back yesterday and inad\'ertently
fumed on a day in June. The water front,
i never does anything by halves in
the way of climate, worked well over to
August in its effort to swing back in the
tide of time. The sky was cloudless, the
bay wavelet*, with Indian summer effects
along the shores. Around the docks the
r.ir grew soft on the ships' rigging and
the East-street promenaders left foot
prints in the quarter-liquid asphalt. A
quartet of whalers lay asleep in the sun
at the Howard pier, with a suspicion of
melted oil oozing from their seams. There
was not a breath of breeze to flush the
rurtheads of the heavy-coated po
licemen nor to shiver the leafless houghs
inel Chadbourne's maples dying In
:t tie rocky holes along the wharves.
tless some of the midsummer heat
came from the choleric feelings of sev
li thousands of the Italian colony, who
had come down to visit the cruiser Etna,
moored off Folsom street. They were not
to tread the decks of the warship and
their expressions over this result added a
fervency to the atmosphere. The Etna's
commander brought up the visiting party
with a round turn when the first division
of tugs, launches, scows, schooners, fish
ing-boats and whitehalls reached his ship.
Then and there a first-class row started
into being. The charterers of the fleet of
boarding craft came clamoring for prece
dence at the gangway in all the idioms of
the Latin and Anglo-Saxon tongue until
the frantic skipper drove them all back
into their boats and directed the Italian
Consul to make explanations, which was
that no visitor should come aboard. Many
enterprising boatmen had hired tugs and
gasolene launches at considerable ex
pense, and their language in discussing
the affair was heated to several warm de
grees.
The expected naval engagement between
Admiral Root of the Harbor Commission
and Commodore Buhner of the Treasury
Department did not take place yesterday
as was advertised, and the Sabbath
breaking: fishers on- Lombard-street wharf
passed the day in peace. While the ad
miral was getting his forces together to
move the cutu-r Golden Gate by force out
of the way of the brig Harriet G, that the
latter vessel might come into the dock,
the commodore moved the cutter himself
and hostilities were averted..
"I am a ruined man," shouted J. L. Lit
tlemore yesterday morning as he rushed
Into the Ferry building. To Officer Shaw
he toid his tale of woe, which was in ef-
I hat he was on his way to Geyser
vine to wed Miss May Sweet, and he and
the ceremony were due at the village of
lioiling Water at 2 p. m., and woe to him
if he failed to appear at her side at that
hour. In that case she would believe him
'â  ithlr-ss, a Geyservllle rival would take
h a plac* and the merry wedding bells
W'>uld ring for the villain. He had
missed his train by twenty minutes, hence
his tears. The entire ferry building
force gathered around him with their
sympathy and advice and he was started
north by a later train. At Santa Rosa he
would get the speediest team, and a relay
at Healdsburg, sixteen miles away. From
that place to Geyserville is eight miles,
making a total of seventy-five miles he
must travel before 2 o'clock or lose his
bride. History will tell how this Paul
Revere-in-love made the ride.
William Johnson, a teamster, was ar
r< Bted by Officer John McGreevey on
Broadway wharf as he drove off the dock
with ten sacks of flour he had taken with
out authority. He broke down, confessed
not only to stealing the ten sacks, but to
taking at different times several other
â  f flour. His plan was to apply for
the articles with a bogus order, which en
abled him to carry nis load away un
molested. He was suspected and was
watched till arrested.
The United States training ship Adams
will leave this port with her crew of ap- i
prentices shortly after December 1 for
Magdalina Bay. where she will remain
two months. From that place she will
make the Sandwich Islands, thence to
Japanese port?, returning to San Fran-
CiSCO about July I. 1599.

" WE'D LOOK LIKE MONKEYS."
Complaint of the Hackmen at the Adoption of a New
Livery.
"Oi'll nlver do It in the world. It's a holy show they would be a-makln'
of me, and Norah would be gettln' a dlvoorce on the grounds of lunacy,"
muttered Pat, the pioneer hackman.
Inquiry as to the cause of his remarks brought forth a volume of pro
fanity which was only stilled by the offer of a "drop of the creature."
Several drops In rapid succession were required to soothe the old man's
Injured feelings, and he explained himself.
"They arg a wantin' us to put on a livery, are the carriage company,
an' such* a livery as It Is. A pair of tights wid shtripes down the legs for
a pair of urttches: a blue coat as long as the confession of sins, wid a tail
split clean up to me neck. Instid of broggans its tight boots to hurt me
corns they'd have me wear on the outside of me skin-tight pants, an' thin
the boots must have yellow tops. If they w r as green it wouldn't be so
bad. To top it off Oi must have a hammered down an' sawed off ploog
hat wid a shavin' brush they call a cockade, whatever In sin that is, stuck
In the top of it. Wouldn't Oi be a purty Bight in a rig the likes of that.
"Oi'm thinkin' next they'll have us in a suit like the clowns in the cir
cus, all covered wid spangles an' polky dots an' our faces painted up to
look like a political banner.
"It's us old fellows what's drove hacks since they've been invlnted that's
doin' the kickin' â the young spalpeens don't care, what wid their foine legs
an' figures an' handsome faces they think they'd make aisy* mashes wid
the gurls in the new livery; but Just take a pipe at those maccaroni un
derpins of mine all covered with ring bones and spavins. They'd be
foine in tights now, wouldn't they? I'd be ashajned to show mesllf to
the horses fearin' they'd give me the laugh. Little Frank O'Brien and Ed
Connolly, who ain't bigger than your thumb, would have to keep out of
sight Â©r they'd be took for a pair of monkeys escaped from an Eytalian
organ-grinder. Red Jim the Flop wid his chinchillie whiskers is a kickin',
too. 'Oi don't want to cut em off,' sez he, 'an' the boss sez if Oi don't Oi
must tie 'em up wid a bow knot of sky blue ribbon.'
"Jlst think of Dan Qulnlan and Mike Brandon in that rig they wants
us to wear, an' thin Henry Rawlings wid his big black mustache, Silver
King Boyle, who thinks himsilf so hansome wid his hair so white from
goin' to church so often wouldn't be so bad, but for mesilf wid me bald
head and the billy-goat whiskers, wouldn't Oi be a sight wid the funny
lookln' stovepipe on me nut.
"They want to make monkeys of us and Oi won't stand it. Oi'd drive
a coal cart first or be a Chinatown bum. Oi'll trow me job an' Join the
anarchist along wid Maguire an' ivery young upstart Oi see drivin" a hack
in those clothes Oi'll blow up wid a stick of dynamite."
The complaint of the hackman is all due to the adoption of a new liv
ery by the United Carriage Company. The manager, in order to keep
peace and prevent a strike, has assured the men that the new uniform
ehall be a blue coat and trousers and possibly an ordinary hat in place of
the tile now in use.
SERMON BY BEY. F. C. LEE.
His Subject Was "Christian Unity
Versus Sectarian Bigotry."
The Rev. Frederic C. Lee delivered the
sermon at the California-street Meth
odist Episcopal Church last night. He
took for his subject "Christian Unity vs.
Sectarian Bigotry," and drew an interest
ing picture between the beauties of the
one and the horrors of the other.
"The spirit of bigotry and religious In
tolerance," the reverend lecturer said,
"has furnished infidelity with its strong
est weapons. Ingersoll, the mighty in
fldel, uses it In a potent manner when he>
says with eloquent though biting sarcasm,
'See how these Christians love each
other.' Was it not the spirit of bigotry
which started the fires of the Spanish In
quisition and in England sent Mary
Queen of Scots and Charles the First to
the block when the Puritans came into
power? Well can we say, 'Woe, religion,
what crimes have been committed in thy
name? What hideous horrors have been
perpetrated in the guise of Christianity?'
"I am glad that the age of religious
persecution is passing away, but sec
tarianism has not been exorcised en
tirely. Denominations are good, but de
nominationalism is bad. In things essen
tial let us have unity, in things doubtful,
liberty, but in all things charity. How
many Protestants are there who find an>
good in the Catholic church? She has
committed errors, it Is true, but let the
church that is without sin cast the first
stone. The prejudice that one church has
for another is unreasonable and should
not be countenanced. , All religions have
done something to overthrow sin and
build up the glory of Christ, and we
should not disparage another's because
they are not with us. We are all mem
bers of the same species and family.
"God grant that religious Intolerance
and bigotry will crumble away and each
religion recognize that they are beautiful
flowers in the other's garden. With one
heart let us continue to glorify God, and.
in the words of the Lord, 'May they all
be one even as we are one.' "

THE DIPHTHEKIA SCABE.
Reports Concerning It Are Said to
Be Grossly Exaggerated.
When seen yesterday in regard to the
diphtheria scare in the Spring Valley
Grammar School, Silas A. White, the
school's principal, expressed himself as
"The reports in regard to diphtheria
prevailing in my school are grossly ex
aggerated. As a matter of fact but four
or five cases have been reported by the
health officers among my pupils, and but
one death has occurred among theseâ
that of Willie Wiedewilt. about 8 years
of age and one of the most promising
nupils of his grade. About four weeks
ago at my request, the health officers in
spected the school and gave it a clean
! bill of health." _

DIED AND LEFT
HIS GOAT ALONE
Passing of "Yankee" Sullivan, a Well-Known Character
of Telegraph Hill, Last Saturday at the City
and County Hospital.
WITH the passing of "Yankee" Sullivan goes one of the city's best
known characters, and his death brings more prominently before his
old associates his chief mourner â the old goat, who was his constant
companion. The goat Is Inconsolable. When his master was sent out to the
hospital he wandered around from one saloon to the other, visiting all
their old haunts, and hunting among their old friends until now, failing to
groat stayea at Maddens until the expiration of the sentence, when he and
Sullivan celebrated in their customary style.
It was a queer partnership â the man and his goat â both falling: deeper,
each among his own kind, but falling together, the only redeeming feature
being the evident affection between them. Now that Sullivan is dead the
goat is traveling the pace that kills. He has made his headquarters at
Maddens and still has his beer, but he takes it alone, arid when he has
passed his allowance he has none of the hilarity of yore, but becomes
moody and morose and sleeps in a corner and perhaps wonders why his old
friend has left him alone. Sullivan died at the City and County Hospital
Saturday last after an illness of six weeks.
RABBI MYERS
FULLY DEFINES
HIS MEANING
Spoke as a Jew, Not
as a Rabbi.
HIS REMARKS MISQUOTED
APPEAL WAS ON THE GROUND
OF COMMON SENSE.
There Are Only Ten or Twelve Million
Jews and Intermarrying Would
Mean Their Sure Ab
sorption.
Referring to his much-talked-of dis
course of Saturday on "Manufacturers of
Mixed Marriages," Rabbi I. Myers of the
Congregation Ohabai Shalome said last
evening: "What I said in the matter was
said as a Jew and not as a rabbi. I
simply appealed to the Jewish community
on the ground of common-sense and with
a view of obviating the complete absorp
tion of the Jews. That is what inter
marrying means, absorption. There are
only ten or twelve million Jews all told,
and intermarrying undoubtedly means
their sure absorption. We do not want
to be wiped out, we want to live.
"There were two or three errors in the
press notices of my remarks. There was
no attempt or Intention on my part to be
personal. On the contrary I have the
highest regard for all my colleagues. I
simply spoke against a certain act, as I
believe I am justified in doing, and re
ferred to the easily surmounted barriers
in the way of such acts as a marriage fee
and the joining of the congregation of the
marrying rabbi. Without quoting the
Jewish law, I simply appealed to the
common-sense view of the matter. A
schoolboy could calculate how long it
would take for the absorption of the
Jews among- the rest of mankind. Though
I did not quote Jewish law, the Jewish
law emphatically condemns proselytizing
under such conditions. The fact of a
Gentile falling in love with the face of a
Jewess, which he considers her fortune,
or, which is more likely, with her figure,
when the figure is a high one, running
into thousands, does not necessarily
prove that he has changed the life-long
habits of thought and belief with which
he Is imbued, so as to be regarded as a
Jew.
"It Is not 'creed' so much as 'deed' that
was demanded by Judaism when a Gentile
knocked at its doors for admission, and
the greatest caution was taken to make
sure that the Gentile was not actuated
by any but the purest motives before he
was received into the pale of Judaismâ
and then he was treated with the greatest
tenderness and consideration."
"Is it true that you said that In such
cases such parties ought to be married
by a magistrate or a Justice of the
peace?"
"Yes. The civil law ought to be quite
sufficient for them. I do not see why a
rabbi should put the stamp of holiness on
a covenant which, from a Jewish point of
view, cannot be considered a holy one."
"What have you to say in regard to
Rabbi Nieto's statement that there are
only three requisites of the Jewish
faith?"
"1 have already Indicated that Judaism
is a religion of action rather than of be
lief. There are millions of the human race
who believe In the three doctrines re
ferred to by Dr. Nieto, but that fact does
not constitute them Jews. They would be
Unitarians or theists. Judaism, as I have
said before, demands action and conform
ing to Jewish laws. Belief is not and
cannot be commanded in the Jewish law.
The 613 laws enumerated by the rabbis
are called negative and affirmative pre
cepts, referring to actions which are
within a man's power. Belief does not
depend upon a man's will. A man will
believe in spite of himself if he is con
vinced, but he can *act If he chooses.
That is one of the characteristic features
of Judaism."

New Organ at St. Dominic's.
The magnificent new organ recently
erected in St. Dominic's Church was test
ed thoroughly yesterday afternoon as to
its merits by Professor H. J. Stewart. The
churgh was crowded almost to its utmost
find his master, he has placed
himself under the care of Dick
Madden, In whose saloon on
Broadway, the goat has often
drunk not wisely but too well.
Sullivan picked up the goat
when, as a kid. It was hunting for
a home on Telegraph Hill. He
raised It through the various
stages of goatshlp and taught it
to drink, and in return the goat
bestowed upon Sullivan all the af
fection of a dog. It followed him
everywhere, and when, as was
often the case, Sullivan's course
was saloonward, the goat brushed
past the swinging doors after him
and lined up at the bar with the
"boys." He was fond of good
steam beer, as was his master,
and when it happened that the
steam was unusually sharp and
plentiful and his master was in
need of assistance home, it was
seldom the dissolute old animal
was in a condition to offer any
thing more than sympathy. He
even went so far on one occasion
as to get himself arrested when he
found his master In the hands of
the police. Sullivan was appre
hended for raising a disturbance
while under the influence; the
wagon was called and Sullivan
was given a seat. It was the in
tention of the policemen to leave
the goat, but it was not his inten
tion to stay, so he climbed Into
the wagon, despite all opposition,
and rode to the prison. They
stalked him out on the lawn, but
he made the night hideous until
he was taken in and locked up
with his master. Sullivan was
sentenced for six months and the
capacity by music lovers from all parts of
the city, who came to hear one of the
largest, if not the largest, instrument of
its kind this side of the Rockies.
In conjunction with the organ a choir
specially augmented for the occasion ren
dered many selections by the great mas
ters.
W. H. LILLIE SERIOUSLY ILL.
Suffering From a Complicated Attack
of Typhoid Fever.
William H. Lillie, the well known archi
tect whose office is in the Claus Spreckel3
building, is critically ill at his home,
1230 Tenth avenue.
Mr. Lilile has been In bad health for
some time past, and about two weeks ago
he was forced to take to his bed. Dr. R.
E. Bunker, who is attending him, diag
nosed his trouble as typhoid fever, and
during the last few days the dread disease
has been rendered more deadly because of
a complication of congestion of the lungs,
so that at present Dr. Bunker has little or
: no hopes of Mr. Lillie's recovery, although
yesterday he was resting easily,:
Noprofessional man is better known in
San Francisco than Mr. Lillie. He design
ed the Masonic Home, and many of the
most prcr^t-snt and beautiful homes in
the residential portion of the city are his
creations. Mr. Lillie came to California
when a small boy with his parents, and
spent the first years of his life in this
State in Eureka. He was born in Minne
! seta, and is 36 years of age. He received
i his education as an architect in tnis city,
â  and it was here that he some years ago
! married Miss Mignon Acors. Mr. Lillie's
father, who has been informed of his
son's extreme illness, is at present living
at San Diego. The many friends of the
architect will learn with much sorrow of
his critical condition, and those who have
already been informed of li have express
ed their heartfelt wishes that he may re
cover and be spared for many years of
useful work.
AVERS WINS SENIOR
SKIFF CHAMPIONSHIP
AIAMEDA OARSMAN DEFEATS
THE PIONEER SCULLER.
Last Tear's Winner, Having Been
Disqualified, Did Not Pull in
Yesterday's Bace.
When the annual championship rowing
regatta of the Pacific Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union was held on No
vember 6 at Long Bridge, the contestants
in the final heat of the senior outrigged
skiff event were Dr. C. C. Dennis of the
South Ends, F. Ayers and C. Ayers of the
Alamedas and C. Ochs of the Pioneers.
Dennis, who had the outside station,
started off with a rush, and, fouling Ochs,
broke the blade of one of his sculls, caus
ing Ochs to retire from the race. Dennis
came home two lengths ahead of his near
est opponent, F. Avers, but; on a protest
being lodged by Ochs, Referee J. W. Mor
ton disqualified Dennis.
During the week just past Dr. C. C,
Dennis wrote to the regatta committee
asserting that he had not fouled Ochs in
tentionally, and requesting permission to
row in the final heat. But Referee Mor
ton's decision disqualifying him was held
to be tinal.
About half an hour after noon yester
day Fred Avers of the Alamedas and C.
Ochs of the Pioneers (O. Ayers of the Ala
medas not being on hand) were dispatched
evenly by A. J. Fritz of the South Ends,
who officiated as starter. F. Ayers, being
?;iven choice of stations by Ochs, took the
nsice, and went ahead almost from the
start. W. Growney in a shell accom
panied the contestants as referee. Dan
Leahy and J. B. Brennan acted as judges
for Ochs and A. Taylor of the Ariels and
Lewis of the Alamedas for Ayers. Ayers
came in an easy winner by four lengths.
On November 6 the Pioneer junior crew
d<-feated the Ariel juniors, and won the
junior barge championship. The Ariels
claimed a foul against the Pioneers, but it
was not allowed by the referee. The
Pioneers, however, who, having won a
junior race, are non intermediates, ex
press their willingness to give the Ariels
a race on any convenient Sunday, and it
is quite likely that such a race will take
place. The Pioneers would like to have
a light new barge for the race, but, if that
cannot be obtained, will not refuse to row
in their old barge against the Ariels.
The Alamedas are now the holders of
three championships: The senior four
oared barge and the senior and junior out
rigged skiffs. The Pioneers hold the
junior barge and junior shell champion
ships, the Ariels are the intermediate
barge champions, and Pape of the Dol
phins won the senior shell race. The
South Ends, who last year held no fewer
than five championships, have this year
ben compelled to resign them all. The
Olympics made no entry in the cham
pionship events and the only Triton rep
resentative entered, C. Artigues in the
junior skiff event, did not start.

LOSES ABLE STAFF OFFICERS
TROUBLE WITH INSURGENTS IS
BREWING.
It Will Be Difficult to Get the Ma- j
jority to Disband â Cooler
Weather and Less Sick
ness at Santiago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO, Nov. 13.â Captain War
ren, an American who has been with
General Gomez, says the General will
no longer have Americans about him
and is getting rid of them as fast as
possible. He takes the same course in
the case of Cubans suspected of favor
ing annexation to the United States.
The result is that some of the best men
who were long attached to his immedi
ate staff are not now with him. It will
be difficult, Captain Warren believes, to
get a majority of the insurgents to dis
band. His idea is that when the Amer
ican authorities gret control of the other
portions of the island, they should give
out no rations and punish severely all
thefts of cattle and produce. He thinks,
too, that there may be some trouble
with the insurgents because of their in
sisting on the right to courtmartial de
linquents among themselves.
There is very little serious sickness
among the troops herp. Everybody is
improving with the cooler weather.
It is estimated that no fewer than
18.000 people in this section are learn- \
ing English, in addition to the school j
children.
The greater part of Marina street is j
now macadamized. This improvement j
is to be extended throughout the entire j
city, in place of the ancient cobble- j
stones.
The United States revenue steamer |
Manning is now here with Captain J
Shoemaker, chief of the Revenue Cut
ter Service, who came to investigate I
as to the need for a vessel for Collector ]
Donaldson. Captain Shoemaker be- j
lieves that Collector Donaldson's re
quest should be complied with.
( nving to the heavy weather, the
Manning, instead of the converted
yacht Hist, will be placed at the dis- j
posal of General Wood, commander of j
the military division of Santiago, for ;
his trip from Guantanamo along the j
northern coast of the province. The '
Manning, with General Wood, will j
probably leave on Tuesday.
MURDERED MAN'S BODY
FLOATING IN A LAKE
Evidence of a Crime Found in a Body
of Water Near Santa
Monica.
SANTA MONICA. Nov. 13.â The body of i
a man with two bullet wounds in the left '
breast was found this morninp floating in
Ballona Lake. Joo Teagle, keeper of the \
Recreation Gun Club grounds, discovered j
it. The authorities were notified and the
body brought to Guidinger's undertaking
parlors, where it awaits identification. It i
is that of a man about 48 years old, 5 feet ;
10 in height, weight probably over 200 |
pounds, dark complexion, dark mustache,
hair tinged with gray, slightly bald
headed, man looks like an Italian. He ;
was attired in gray underwear, black ;
striped trousers, blur hose, tan shoes, i
without coat, vest or shirt.
The body may have bt.-^n thrown from a !
rising rhip and drifted to where it w:is I
found. Possibly the man was a hunter !
camping in this vicinity.
That it was not an accidental shooting
ia certain from the mariner In which he
was clothed, and it is impossible that the
wounds were self-inflicted. There seems to
be no doubt that a murder has bf-en com
mitted. The body seemingly had not been
in tli^ water more than two or three days'.
Several parties claim to have seen the
man on the streets here recently, but no
one has glvf-n any ckw to his identity.
There is evidence of a severe contusion
on the side of the head. "Whether this
was received before or after death will
probably be determined at the inquest, ]
which will be held to-morrow morning.
PRESIDENT PRAISES
CALIFORNIA TROOPS
Thanks Governor Budd for the Splen-
did Showing Made by This
State During the War.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. Adjutant
General A. W. Barrett has Just returned
from Washing-ton with a check for $SS.
31105, drawn by the United States Gov
ernment In payment for transportation,
equipments, quartermasters and commis-
Bary stores furnished to the California
Volunteers by this State. California has
the distinction of having been the first
State to obtain a settlement with the
Government, due chiefly to the fact that
the accounts of California were in splen
did shape, vouchers accompanying each
item charged the Government, thereby
saving long delays in having the claims
adjusted. . The other States had their
papers returned two and three times for
correction.
The general called on President Ale-
Kinley by appointment, and the President
told him he wished to thank Governor
Budd for the splendid showing made by
him during the war with Spain in the
matter of getting the troops in to the
volunteer service, and for the excellent
troops from California, particularly the
First Regiment, at Manila.

New Southern Camps.
CAMP MEADE. Middletown, Pa., Nov.
13 âThe end of Camp Meade Is in sight.
By Thursday the entire Second Army
Corps will have left for the new camps
in the South. Three regiments started to
day and three more will go to-morrow.
General Young and staff and the Signal
Corps will be the last to go. The regi
ments leaving to-day were the Second

Secretary Alger is so well pleased with
this location that a portion of it may
be again used next spring. The hospitals
have been cleaned out and on Wednesday
their equipment will be sent away. The

sick soldiers in the city hospitals will join

STATE SUPREME COURT
CONGESTED WITH WORK
Superior Judge York of Los Angeles
Suggests a Scheme for
its Belief.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13.â The State
Supreme Court has become so congested
with work that a scheme has been sug
gested by which the labors of the Justices
may be lightened. Judge York of the Su
perior Court of this county has given
much thought to the subject and has em
bodied hi 3 ideas in a bill which will be
introduced at the next Legislature. By
his plan the work in the Supreme Court
will be specialized, with the result of
economizing both time and labor. His
plan is the eliminating of Supreme Court
Commissioners and making department
decisions iinal, which will do away with
the consideration of the ?ame matters by
commissioners and Justices other than
those specially charged with their con
sideration. In other words, such a mode
will prevent the same identical work being
gone over more than once without any
compensation.
The most Important point, too, will be
the reduction In expanses. Under the
present mode there are seven Justices and
five Commissioners. Each Commisioner
receives the same salary as a Supreme
Court Justice, but under the proposed
amendments there would be ten Juhtloes
and no Commissioners. With an increase
of work the Legislature would have power
to add another department with three ad
ditional Justices, but even then the num
ber would never exceed the present aggre
gate of Justices and Commissioners by
one, and years would elapse before the ne
cessity tor such increase would justify the
Legislature in making the addition.
EVIDENCE OF INTENT TO
DISABLE THE BUFFALO
Sensational Facts Are. Leaking Out
From tne Board of Inves
tigation.
NEW YORK, Nov. IS.â A Newport (R.
L) special to the World says: Notwith
standing the unusual secrecy sought to be
maintained by the court of inquiry now
on board the cruiser Buffalo investigating
the recent disabling of the warship,
enough has leaked out to warrant the be
iief that her condition was not due to ac
cident but to design. A man who ia in a
position to know the truth says:
"The injury to the machinery of the
Buffalo was discovered last Monday and
reported to Commander Hemphill. There
was evidence that her sea valves had
been tampered with, and a sailor's 'ditty
bag' was found stuffed in one of the con
densers, rendering it practically useless.
There is no doubt that the cruiser had a
narrow escape at sea^ and there i.s reason
to believe that the dissatisfaction of the
crew had much to do with the alleged ac
cident. The sailors are known to have
held the Buffalo in abhorrence and to
have referred to her frequently as a 'hell
shii>. p "
GILT-EDGES VICTORIOUS.
They Beat the Athletics in a Fine
Contest.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 13.â The Gilt
Edges won from the Athletics to-day in
one of the best contests of the season. It
was a pitchers' battle, and until the sev
enth inning Fitzpatrick held his own
against Doyle, neither team scoring and
both men doing great execution and keep
ing the few hits well scattered. Fitz
patrick tired toward the close of the
eighth, and the locals touched him up for
enough hits to win out.
The features of the game were a home
run by Walker, lightning stops by Loch
head and Stulz and a neat double piay
by Stulz and Johnson. Score:

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1898.
WOMEN OCCUPY
ST. PAUL PULPITS
Preaching by W. C. T.
U. Delegates.
CONVENTION WORK VARIED
TEMPLE MATTER WILL COME UP
TO-DAY.
! A Lively Contest for the National
Presidency â Seattle Favored
as the Next Place of
Meeting.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL, Nov. 13.â This was a quiet
day among the W. C. T. U. delegates
so far as convention work was con
cerned. A number of delegates filled
local pulpits, both morning and even-
Ing. But one session of the convention
was held, Miss E. W. Greenwood,
world's and national superintendent of
the evangelistic department, preaching
at 2:30 at the People's Church. The
temple matter and election of officers,
which promises so much excitement
Monday and Tuesday, were kept as
j much in the background as possible for
subjects In which all are interested.
The temple matter is due to come up
j late Monday afternoon, when Mrs. Ma
i tilda B. Case, the founder of the tern-
I pie, will make her report on it and seek
to overcome the adverse decision of the
executive committee on the subject.
The polling of delegates continues ac
tively and everybody is confident of
| winning. A very lively contest Is
I promised, the first move probably be
j ing an attempt to secure a secret ballot.
! Friends of the temple believe they can
| gain most by such a course, because of
i the timidity of some of the delegates.
j The general opinion has been that Mrs.
M. N. Stevens, vice president at large
and acting president, would be unop
posed In her candidacy for the plucÂ»
made vacant by the death of Miss
Frances E. Willard, but several other
candidates have been announced. Mrs.
Martin H. Dunham of lowa, one of the
I temple trustees and now State presi
dent of lowa, i.s a prominent candidate,
and her friends hope for help from the
friends of the temple. Another promi
nent candidate is Mrs. G. B. Forbes,
State president of Connecticut.
Mrs. Stevenson's resignation leaves
the position of corresponding secretary !
vacant' and a number of prominent
workers have been mentioned for the
office. There is little canvassing being
done, and Miss Anna A. Gordon, for
! merly Miss Willard's confidential friend
I and secretary', seems to be the most
prominent in the field. There seems
! no reason to doubt that the other of
ficers will be re-elected. The place of
| the next meeting has not yet been de
: cided upon, but it Is probable that it will
be Seattle. There are a number of
Eastern cities that have invited the
convention to meet in the East, but the
i general sentiment seems to be in favor
i of Seattle.
THE KAISEB'S BIG SOLDIEBS.
"The tallest man in his army," who
accompanied the German Emperor in
his visit to the East, is a grenadier
i named Chiemke, who is nearly 6 feet 10
j inches in his stockings. This Frederick
i William mania of the Kaiser Is an old
| device of his for impressing the for
| elgner. On returning from his first
I visit to Constantinople In 1889 the Em-
I peror sent the Sultan a complete set
of kettledrums, which he intrusted to
! the tallest officer in his army, Lieuten
i ant Pleskow, who is very little, if at all,
' under 7 feet. Once, indeed, when this
I Prussian guardsman looked over a
se ven-foot garden wall and asked a girl
picking gooseberries therein what was
the way to so-and-so, the simple
i maiden told him to ride first to the
I right and then to the left, and he would
i find the place he wanted. The nymph
j had honestly fancied that an officer
i overpeering her garden wall like that
must necessarily be on horseback.
London Chronicle.
ANNOYED BY SILVER.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is sin
gular among the roll of English Pri
mates for his hatred of pomp and dec
! oration. Once, when the guest of a
I country gentleman, he was much an-
I noyed by the display of silver candle
| sticks In his room. After his Lordship's
{ departure these silver candlesticks
I were nowhere to be seen. The dis-
I tressed clergyman at once wrote to the
! Bishop, as he then was, telling him of
| his loss, and adding. "'Can you tell us
I what has happened?" The reply came
[by wire: "Poor, but honest; look in
I the chest of df awers."
This is not fhe only silver adventure
in which Archbishop Temple has been
concerned, says the London Outlook.
On another occasion he was put up by
a clergyman during the absence of that

politely expressed the hope that when
next his Lordship honored the house
Mrs. Temple would accompany him.
"No thanks," the Archbishop laconic
ally replied; "Mrs. Temple doesn't like
roughing it." The clergyman's feelings
were deeply hurt, foi- the visit had
meant some expense and much anxiety
to him. He unburdened his soul to his
wife on her return. "Why, my dear,
she exclaimed, "you didn't surely put
the Bishop into the pink bedroom, did
you?" He did. "Oh, then, that's it. I
put all the plate in the bed!"
VOORHEES' GENEROSITY.
The late Senator Voorhees of Indiana
was a person to whom a story of want
and suffering rarely failed to appeal,
and, when so touched, his hand usually
w^nt to his pocket. However, his gen
erosity was not infrequently at the ex
pense of his friends â as many stories
still told of him go to illustrate, says
the Chicago Journal.
The Senator and an old friend, Colo
nel W. R. Hunter, who, previous to his
death two years ago, was one of Terre
Haute's best known citizens, Vere en
gaged in conversation on a street cor
ner in Terre Haute one day when a
thin, ill dressed man, bearing all the
marks of the under side of lifej, ap
proached and called Mr. Voorhees to
one side. He then told the Senator a
story of hard luck; of his failure to se
cure work, and his physical inability to
work if he had it; of a family with
nothing to eat, finally winding up with
a plea for assistance.
A sympathetic look overspread his
hearer's face.
"Why, of course, my poor man," the
Senator replied, heartily. He reached
for his purse, but it was not about him.
Then one after another he ran through
his pockets, but could not find a cent.
"Here, Hunter," he said, turning to
his friend, '"give this man $5 for me."
With something approaching a grunt,
for he weighed but little less than 300
pounds, Colonel Hunter drew out a well
filled wallet and tendered the suppli
cant a $5 bill. The man thanked both
Senator Voorheees and Mr. Hunter and
hastily stowed the money away in a
pocket â which waÃ the last the colonel
ever saw or heard of his $5.
SEEKING BEAUTY.
Caroline Otero, Cleo de Merode and
several other famous Paris beauties
have disappeared utterly from sight.
This is not startling, however, for in
France, where beautiful women take
themselves seriously and cherish their
pood looks, it 1s quite customary for
them to seclude themselves occasionally
to repair the ravages of time, sun and
wind. For eight or ten days they are
not at home, even to their closest ac
quaintances. â¢
The retirement usually occurs after
i a summer at the seashore and before
the winter gayetles begin. Freckles on
milky skins, tan and roughnessâ all
these must be got rid of. Experts In
massage and beauty doctors flit in and
out of the rooms of madame and there
are baths of milk and cologne, coatings

A young gentleman, wbose character is above reproach, promi-
nent in the religious circles of a Pennsylvania village, an exhorter of
the M. H. Society there, Secretary of the Quarterly Conference, and
at one time President of the Christian Endeavor Society, has long
been a user of Ripans Tabules, and says of them : " They keep my
bowels open, they do not gripe, they do not purge, and I do not have
bad pains in my stomach any more, which I had, with dyspepsia and
constipation, for years â in fact, up to about three days after I began
taking the Tabules. There used to be some kinds of food my stomadi
would sicken on â pork, for instance. I could not eat it without having
a distressed feeling. Now everything goes down, pork and greasy
food, that used to make me sick to think of. I always have a few of
the Tabules in my pocket for use if occasion arises."
are told of strips of skin taken from
newly killed animalsâ hares and rab
bitsâand applied still warm to the
shoulders and arms of the beauty seek
ers. This treatment is said to give a
velvety luster and surface and to re
move any disfiguring marks.
When this is all over the women
emerge with ten years subtracted from
their age. the tired lines about the eyes
and mouth gone and girlish beauty re
stored. That it is expensive is not de
nied, but when good looks are in ques
tion what woman is going to stop to
count the dollars? Probably the little
lady of slender purse who faithfully de
votes the kitchen tea kettle to steaming
her face, makes her own cold cream
and takes care what food passes hei
lips can accomplish about the same re
sult as the beauties with unlimited
wealth.
VANITY FAIR.
New York women have risen in their
might and downed the fashionable and
expensive ladies' tailors. Recently the
employes of these big firms went on a
strike and paraded the Btreets. Several
society women who heard their pitiful
stories banded together, raised $50,000
and will have a factory of their own,
where all the strikers are to have em
ployment, besides an interest in the
business. The starters of the enter
prise promise to have all their tailor
gowns made there and the fashionable
tailors are aghast.
One of the present crazes of Paris is
the zebra, recently sent by Emperor
Menelik to President Faure and placed
by him in the zoo, which is thronged by
sight-seers, who enthuse over the ani
mal, which is an admirable one of its
species and the second to be imported
into Europe.
A curious social revolution has been
brought about in Paris. Before this the
drawing-rooms of the old French fam
ilies were hermetically sealed to for
eigners and social aspirants. Neither
money nor beauty nor position sufficed
to break the barriers set up by the
haughty grand dames of the Fauborg.
All this is changed. Women such as
the Duchess d'Uzes and Duchess de la
Rochefoucauld have decided to open
their salons to strangers on the pay
ment of a fixed pum, the money to go
to charity. Where it was once thought
an extraordinary honor to penetrate
into these drawing-rooms now that
for 75 cents any one can get in, as one
can gain admission to a theater, the
idea is frowned upon by the high bred
foreigners and it is noticed that the
wife of the American Embassador, Mrs.
Horace Porter, and other leading
American women in Paris have sedu
lously shunned the drawing rooms of
the duchesses since the practice went
into execution.
The nited States court has rendered
a decision declaring that the act of the
New York Legislature of 1895 to regu
late barbering on Sunday Is constitu
tional. The law makes barbering on
Sunday a misdemeanor, except In the
efty of New York and the village of
Saratoga Springs, where it Is lawful on
Sunday up to 1 o'clock In the after
noon.

AN OVATION
Applause Followed All
His Plays.
IRWIN FURNISHED GOOD BALL
THE SUGAR BEETS DID SOME
RANK PLAYING.
Collins' Raw Efforts Lost the Game
for the Visitors â However, the
Crowd Was Satisfied
With the Star.
By Joe Corbett.
\g, healthy-looking "Bill" Lange,
iwn familiarly to the baseball world
as "Little Eva" and sometimes as the
â¢idol of the soubrette," made his first
appearance since returning from a most
successful season with the Chicago club
and as accorded a most rousing and
rather sensational reception.
There is no more popular player with
the San Francisco public than Bill. His
f.dmirers are numerous and loyal, which
fact rus clearly demonstrated when he
stepped to the plate for the first time in
yesterday's game. The immense crowd
which came there purposely to see him
perform were quick In acknowledging
their appreciation and pleasure, and
tiapped and cheered until the stands
vibrated with the clatter. And not con
tent with this display, a huge floral piece
inlaid with the inscription "Little Eva"
was presented by some of his friends.
Every move the fellow made was ap
plauded greatly. . In fact, there were oc
casions when applause was plentiful and
no one was able to discover why it so
happened. For instance, a little popfly
was hit. Big Bill would catch it, and the
stands would almost crumble under the
agitation. Even Collins, who made such
a show of himself, could have captured
that fly without injuring his cheesecloth
reputation, but Bill caught it, and there
fore it must be a great catch.
At any rate, "Little Eva" did do a few
things that were worthy of the great, re
ception accorded him. His wonderful
base running, finishing up with the
cleverest of slides, opened the eyes of
most of the fans. Surely Bill gave us all
a treat in this respect, and we thank you.
Bill, for the pleasure. -
Next to Lange came Charles Irwin.
This gentleman was also given a grand
reception, and played a faultless game.
He hit the ball on which the game was
decided, and certainly that is doing
enough for one game.
The contest was won by the Oaklands
through a combination of the rankest
misplays ever seen at Recreation Park.
With the game right in their hands up to
the seventh inning, Irwin came to bat
with men on second and third. He hit an
easy grounder to Collins, who fumbled,
one run scoring. .He recovered the ball
and threw it to the plato, where Balsz
had planted himself in a sitting position
directly in front of the catcher. Neither
of them was able to intercept the ball
and it passed on to the grand stand, two
more runs crossing the plate as a conse
quence.
After this lead the Oaklands were never
headed, and one more game will go on
record as being thrown away through
Btupid work.
Up to this fatal seventh the game was
Fteady, interesting and well played. Mr.
Collins, however, should be hanged for
his poor work. The score was as follows:

KRAGNESS CUTS
TWO OF THE BIG
ROAD RECORDS
Fifty-Mile Mark Badly
Broken.
THE OLYMPIAN IS A WONDER
LIGHTNING PEDALING OVER
THE COURSE.
Straightaway and Standard Road
Scores Lowered to 2:13:29â 8 ay
City Wheelmen Have a
Road Race.
Ed O. Kragmess' attempt against the
American long-distance road records up
to fifty miles yesterday was more suc
cessful than even his most ardent ad
mirers had hoped for. The speedy Olym
pian went after the straightaway 50-mile
record of 2:15:00, held by L. C. Wahl of
Colorado Springs, and the standard
50-mile record of 2:22:39, held by A. W. "W.
Evans of New Brunswick. Both of these
marks Kragness succeeded in lowering
over the Fruitvale-Haywards 10-mi!e
course, which necessitated his making:
five turns, and his time for the fifty miles
stood at the finish 2 hours 13 minutes 29
seconds, a most remarkable preformance.
He rode the first twenty-live miles in
1:06:12 3-5, which also lowers . the Coast
record of 1:09 for that distance.
The secret of Kragness' success yester
day, aside from thefact that he was per
fectly trained for the work, lay in his
superb pacing, although at one time even
this failed and he had to ride eight miles
entirely unpaced. His pacemakers were
C. M. Smith and O. E. Bozio on singles,
Williams and Bean, Kroetz nr>A Kings
ley on tandems, and Loos, Hobson and
Hammersmith on a triplet. The triplet
broke down at the start, but was repaired
and did good service later on. When fif
teen miles out Kragness 1 wheel punc

FAVORITE DOGS
MET DEFEAT
AT INGLESIDE
Rathbone Won the Big
Stake Handily.
MAC'S MELODY WAS DRAWN
CLUB MEMBERS ARE PACKING
TRUNKS FOR MERCED.
Coursing Yesterday the Best in the
History of the Track â Maney
Played Freely on
Favorites.
Yesterday was a day never to be for
gotten in the history of Ingleside cours
ing. The average time of each course was
better than has ever been known at the
park before, and a barrel of money was
taken in and paid out at the betting ring.
If the average time occupied by eacn of
yesterday's courses was computed it
would approximate two minutes. Such
coursing as this opens sport seekers' eyes
and is putting the record of this pleasure
on the Pacific Coast against that of the
old country. The popularity of Ingleside
is rapidly increasing. This is manifested
more and more each week as the attend
ance broadens out and owners of good
dogs seek the park as a place at which
they get fair play and a run for their
money.
This morning the Ingleside Club will
pack away, bag and baggage, to Merced,
where it will see that its good reputation
is sustained. There will be a large crowd
at the ferry to see the boys oft and an
equally large crowd will greet them at the
other end. Yesterday Tommie Hall and
Mr. Baker wired Judge Grace that they
had selected grounds and hares that are
the best the land affords.
Mac's Melody suffered defeat yesterday.
She was in it for the final but had to be
withdrawn, us a series of disastrous en
counters had left her completely exhaust
ed, and it would have been folly to have
put her in the field again. She had her
rirst hard tussle with Moondyne and was
compelled to run an "undecided' over.
She then ran a bye with Victor King and
the latter dog. being fresh, kept the chase
up for four minutes. She had had three
regular courses' previous to this time, and
these last efforts finished her completely.
Rathbone, a dog which few picked as
the winner of the stake, carried off first
money. In the third round he defeated
Royal Buck while the betting was 2Vfe to
I against him. Immediately after this
course the dog sighted another hare and
ran for a couple of minutes before he
could be captured. It was thought that
this mad chase would spoil his chances
for the final, but the gritty little piece of
dog flesh laid out Hadiwlst in the next
round and was then awarded the final.
Glenrosa was withdrawn in the third
round to preserve her good condition for
the Merced meeting. Hadlwist and White
Diamond ran three courses before a de
cision could be made by the judge. Each
of the courses was exciting. In the four
minute chase between Hadiwist and Rock
Island Boy the latter scored "4 points
while the former was scoring 14. With
one exception this is the heayiest scoring
ever made at Ingleelde. About six short
ends produced for their players some
money. The highest winning odds were
played in the run between American Ea
gle'and Flying: Buck. They were 5 to 1.
The results were as follows:

Union Coursing Park yesterday, defeating
Royal Flush â¢in the finals In handy
fashion.
Hurricane, the Imported New Zealand
hound, gave a good performance allday
until the fourth round, when he was de
feated by Thornhill, but as Hurricane was
not in fine form, there is no doubt that he

AT THE PARK AND CLIFF.
Biggest Crowd of the Season Enjoys
a Day's Outing.
Thousands of pleasure-seekers visited
the part and Cliff yesterday afternoon.
The bridle road, which was completed
last week, was patronized by scores of
equestrians, and the number of "turn
outs" that gathered in front of the music
! stand, according to Captain Thompson,
i was the largest in months. The weather
was ideal, the music unusually select and
the crowd appreciative. No accidents or.
'â  incidents worthy of mention occurred,
i and in consequence the police and hos
! pital surgeons enjoyed a rest.
The beach was lined with humanity as
i far as the eye could reach from the Cliff
House. Many of the people who sought
the ocean for recreation splashed in the
surf and raced around the warm sand.
The children were in their element and
spent an enjoyable day. The Chutes was
also well patronized. The three "missing
links," Sadie, Congo and Joe, a polar
bear of sour temper and a long-maned
horse are among the new attractions at
the Zoo, and they were not overlooked by
! the visitors.
Those who enjoy aquatic sports as
; sembled by the hundreds at Sutro's
! Baths. The contests were both exciting
' and interesting as usual. Following are
I the results:

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
PROPHETS ARE
WITHOUT HONOR
IN ALAMEDA
Peculiarities of the
Election.
OPPOSITION MADE VOTES
LEAVITT, TALCOTT. CHURCH
AND JORDAN.
The Republican Quartet That Kept
Their Enemies Awake o' Nights
Planning- Schemes That
Failed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 13.
There are many prophets who are not
without honor save in their own country,
and many of them live in Alameda County.
As well as being prophets they are poli
ticians, and under the fire of last Tues
day some melted and others came out
Daniel-like. Now that the seriousness of
the election is past, an analysis of some
of the conditions attending it is full of
surprises. Many of the successful candi
dates were repudiated in their own homes,
while others who were thought to be weak
proved to be remarkably strong, and yet
others who prophesied great strength
were incased in ice when the votes were
counted.
Supervisor Church, although securing a
handsome majority in his district, did not
win any of that majority in his home
ward. County Clerk Jordan, who made
the hardest light of the campaign, did not
get any of his majority in the Seventh
Ward; Supervisor Talcott, whose majority
was very generous in his district, re
ceived a "minority in his home precinct;
Recorder Spear of Berkeley, one of the j
most active in the Republican county ;
campaign, was beaten in his home dis
trict and everywhere else. S. D. Water- !
man, also of Berkeley, did not carry his
own district, and was beaten.
Oscar Rogt-rs, who obtained more votes
for Sheriff than all the other candidates
put together, with a thousand to spare,
was considered to be one of the weakest
Republican candidates. On the other
hand, John Hackett, an independent
Democrat, actually created such confi
dence in some quarters, in his campaign,
that a member of the City Council found
enough Hackett money to win fifteen hun
dred dollars on the election of Henry Dal
ton. Dr. Mehnnann was beaten in the
city where he resides, !>ut saved himself
in the county. This is remarkable in
view of the fact that Republican candi- !
dates in the past have always depended ;
on a big majority in the city to offset the
Democratic majority with which Demo- <
crats always threaten to come over San j
Leandor bridge into Oakland.
Of hue years it may be noted that this
Democratic majority has been only imagi- j
nary.
Another feature of the election is the
fact that the candidates who were most
bitterly and generously opposed were
elected. Not for years has this county
seen euch a bitter spirit shown in a Su
pervisorial fight as that evinced toward
John Talcott and Will Church. Not only
a part of the local press, but San Fran
cisco's fusion ovgan, brought all their
batteries to bear against these Republican
candidates, but without effect. Never -was
.such ,i whispering Tight made as was
made against County Clerk Jordan, and
opportunity that his political op
's could invent to unfairly criticize
his administration was eagerly embraced
and exploited. Even from Alameda
gruminent RÂ»-publicans went into the
eventh Ward on the day of election and
worked hard to defeat Jordan, and now
he has the- laugh on his opponents.
There are some sores left from Tues
day's battle which will not easily heal.
Weeks ago it was known that there was
not unity among the Republican candi
dates. All were not working for the com
mon good of the ticket, and it is a lasting
denunciation of such tactics that the men
aga.inst whom opposition was hurled from
their own ranks came out victorious while
others were buried beneath the majorities
of their opponents. It is surprising in
view of the individual selfishness that pre
vailed in the party that the Republican
banner still stays with us. There Is at
present a quiet investigation going on to
find out just who ;s; s primarily responsible
for this treachery, and those who won in
spite of it would not be human did they
not take every means to retaliate during
the next four years.
Another lucky man was Assemblyman,
now Senator-elect. Frank W. Leavitt. As
soon as he announced his desire to be a
member of the next State Senate Mr.
Leavitt was considered a legitimate tar
get for abuse by the fusionlst press. With
its usual and expected disregard for truth
and decency, Mr. Leavitt was honored by
the opposition. The effect was most bene
ficial to him, for each week it became
more evident that his probable majority
was Bteadily increasing, and last Tuesday
night his fusion opponent was left so far
behind that he must be considered polit
ically dead. Leavitt always was a child
of luck.
Recorder Spear deserves great credit for
the magnanimity with which he can lose
a political fight. No on.c did better work
during the county campaign than Spear.
He fought loyally for the whole ticket,
asking no particular favors for any spe
cial candidate, not even for himself. His
was a peculiar struggle. He was never
criticized nor opposed, either personally
or for the conduct of his office, yet his op
ponent, an elderly man, â  captured the
plum with thousands of votes to spare.
It was not that the voters did not waut
Spear, but they wanted Grim more When
the rc-Â«ult was" known Spear was one of a
little dinner party early last Wednesday
morning, and he was a>< sincere in his con
gratulations of his more favored brother
;;ites as in his expression that his
opponent had won out fairly. Although
be.-.ten t'Â»aporarily. Spear is a long way
from bell' 7 ; vanquished politically.
The st'i-et railway employes proved
TfiF'rr.sel\!s to be a powerful factor In
county rjrlitics. Three months ago they
exiTfPseiV a desire to see A. K. Grim
elected lyWorcW. There are about seven
hutidrrfl ;=trf-(-t-onr men and some one
diplomatically suggested that they or
ganize on behalf of Mr. Grim. Their cam
paign wa â  a personal one more than a po
lit'<-al eff rt. They knew nothing in pol
iti s but Urim; they talked nothing but
Gum ai.-l the amount of campaigning
that sove.fi hundred men can do on street
ca^s in Â«'â¢â  couple of months was shown
conclusively las; Tuesday. Each man 1b
crr-dited with making a dozen votes for
Grim, while pulling the bÂ«"li or turning
th<? lever, and this estimate with the
votes of the faction of Republicans which
was dissatisfied with the San Leandro
convention cave Mr. Grim his great vote.
Hereafter the street-car men will be in
demand at elections, although the pro
prfety of hundreds of men employed by
one corporation entering so decidedly
Into politics may be questioued. In
this instance, however, there was
n^'t the least secrecy about the
cr.rmen's action. They organlfized
openly, fearlessly, an individuals, ,md
were neither encouraged nor discouraged
by their employers. They felt a debt of
gratitude to Mr. Grim and even went so
far as to issue thousands of addresses to
the voters, signed by a corps of carmen.
There Is an interesting side to this at
titude of the cannon. They made their
fight tor Grim because two years ago
Srim relinquished voluntarily his position
as superintendent of the Syndicate Rail
way because he refused to obey the
orders of the directors to reduce the sala
ries of the men. According to Mr. Ma
guire It should be supposed that the cor
poration, which is the most powerful in
this county, would object to Its employes,
even as individuals, supporting Grim on
such a platform, which was really an en
couragement to disobey an order of the
board of directors. Such a deduction,
however, is proved now to be an absurdi
ty, for no one has yet heard of a. single
man losine his job for voting for Mr.
Grim, neither does any one expect to hear
of such. Certainly the recent diatribes
delivered in this county by Maguire et aL
concerning oppression, coercion and herd
ing of men by corporations lack confirma
tion in fact. *
The Independents certainly did not de
rive much encouragement from the voters.
This party of alleged purity, which
sprang into existence at the suggestion of
men repudiated by the Republican party,
may be considered as dead forever. Not
one of its candidates accomplished any
thing. It is true they indorsed Mr. Grim's
independent candidacy, but Grim without
the independents would have won as de
cisively as with them. However, they did
as well as it was expected they would.
Alameda County does not take kindly to
independent movements. It has learned
to suspect them, and this suspicion is due
to the- fact that in the past inquiry into
the motives of these hybrid movements
has invariably proved them to have had
their origin in disappointed office-seekers.
This county is decidedly partisan. It
likes a successful man, and just as bitter
ly does it repudiate an unsuccessful one.
The independents put up for office many
men who had once been cast aside at the
polls. To enter upon a campaign of purity
under such circumstances does not suggest
such honesty of purpose as the purity
loving voters desire. Judging by the re
sults, the campaign of the Independents
was entirely useless. It drew just as
many votes from one party as from an
other, and had it never been born there
would have been no changes in the list of
successful candidates.
Politicians will now take a rest for
three weeks. After their Thanksgiving
turkeys have been digested, the city cam
paign may be considered on. Already
some preliminary work has been done,
but the people having been so surfeited
with politics during the past six months
have concluded by common assent that
they will listen to no more campaign
pleadings or speeches till after Thanks
giving at least, and. if possible, not until
after Christmas. STUART W. BOOTH.
SUDDEN PASSING
OF HENRY H. BECK
OAKLAND MOURNS FOR ONE OF
HER BRIGHTEST SONS.
The Late Manager of the American
District Telegraph Company
Dies at Fabiola Hospital.
OAKLAND, Nov. 13.â Henry H. Beck,
late manager of the American District
Telegraph Company in San Francisco,
I died at the Fabiola Hospital this morn-
I ing at 1:25 o'clock, after an illness of less
than a week's duration.
The first indication of the sickness
which finally resulted In death came in
the form of acute pains in the chest, j
which were afterward found to be the
i consequence of a perforation of the in
testines. Thursday afternoon the young
man took to his bed, and Dr. Cunning
ham, the family physician, was sum
moned. After a cursory examination by |
Drs. Cunningham and Julius Rosenstein, j
it was found that the only chance for
life was in an operation. Saturday, on the
advice of these physicians, he was re
moved from his home at H46 Telegraph
avenue to the Fabiola Hospital, where an
operation was performed at 11 o'clock in
the evening. He died two hours after
ward, and the body was removed to the
home of his parents, 17 Hyde street, San
Francisco.
Young Beck had been an employe of
the American District Telegraph Com-,
pany ior eleven years, but left the com
pany recently and came to this city,
i where he organized the Oakland Burglar
'â  and Fire Alarm Company, for which he
received a fifty year franchise. He was to
I represent this syndicate as president and
superintendent, and work was to have
been commenced on the enterprise in a
short time.
His death comes as a sad blow to his
friends and relatives, as he was loved at
home and was a general favorite among
his wide circle of acquaintances. He was
25 years old. and leaves a widow, a young
son, father and mother and several
brothers and sisters to mourn his loss.
Oakland Church Services.
OAKLAND, Nov. 13.â Rev. Dr. R. F.
Coyle delivered a stirring lecture on "The
Cause of the Social Problem,' to-night at
the First Presbyterian Church.
At the First M. E. Church the pastor,
Rev E. R. Dille, delivered a sermon to
night on "Atheism, Agnosticism and Ma
terialism." being the first of a series on
current topics.
â The Highest Stage in the Culture of
Christian Manhood. With Special Refer
ence to the Y. M. C. A. Work," was the
subject of Rev. Philip Grnif's sermon at
the First Free Baptist Church this morn
ing. His evening sermon was preceded by
a prelude on "The Anti-Saloon Move
ment."
Professor and Mrs. A. Dobbins, the
gospel singers, recently from the East,
gave a service at the Y. M. C. A. Auditor
ium this afternoon entitled "A Ship With
out a Pilot." The songs, duets, hymns

Manhood" at the Union-street Presbyter
ian Church to-night.
"Shall We Know Each Other in Another
PAULISTS HONOR ST. ANTHONY.
Statue Erected In His Name With Sacred and Impressive
Ceremony at St. Mary's Church.
T MMEDIATELY before the
1 celebration of vespers at St.
1 Mary's Church (Paullst) last
evening an imposing and mag
nificent statue of St. Anthony
was blessed and consecrated
â with simple but Impressive and
inspiring ceremony. Of late de
votions to this saint have been
markedly general. Throughout
the entire city statues, similar
to that now erected In St. Mary's
Church, have been and are still
being erected for special devo
tional purposes.
The statue, as erected, oc
cupies a position immediately to
the right of St. Joseph's altar.
It is about five feet four inches
in height and stands upon a
base of highly ornamental red
wood. One of its principal char
acteristics is its trueness to life.
One can almost fancy that the
artistic image is endowed with
animation as it looks down upon
the devotee in prayer and sup
plication at the altar rail below.
The ceremony of consecra
tion was performed by the Rev.
Father Maxmillian of St. Jos
eph's Church of this city, assist
ed by acolytes and one of the
associate priests of the Paulist
community.
The devotions at Bt. Mary's
Church to the honored saint will
differ somewhat from the usual.
which are now being performed and extended by other churches, par
ticularly the French Church (Marist Community) on Bush street. The
form of devotion wil consist solely in the offering of prayer and the
burning of blessed candles. Those desirous of makine this latter of
fering can do so by inserting a blessed candle in the candelabra which
will be erected for the purpose in the near future immediately be
fore the statue.
The statue was imported from France, and is the gift of Mrs. M.
H. de Young.

The Oakland Exposition.
OAKLAND. Nov. 13.â The California
State Exposition, which opened in this
city last night, will continue until De
cember 3, and bids fair to surpass any
thing of its kind ever held in Alameda
County. The scope of attractions is far
more comprehensive than last year, and
takes in nearly every important industry
in the State, for it is not wholly an Oak
land institution.
The attendance last night, though ex
ceptionally satisfactory, wos nothing com
pared to what it will be throughout this
week. The exhibition will be open all af
ternoons and evenings and will. If any
thing, increase in magnitude as it pro
gresses. ________^___
THROWN FROM THE
CARS AND RUN -OVER
SERIOUS ACCIDENT TO CHARLES
CHACE, A BSAKEMAN.
Nearly Rolled Under the Wheels of a
Rapidly Moving Freight
Train.
OAKLAND, Nov. 13.â Charles Chace, a
! bra.keman. had a miraculous escape from
a most horrible death early this morning
on the narrow-gauge night freight run
ning between Alameda and Santa Cruz.
As a result of injuries sustained he is
! now liyng in a critical condition at Pab
j iola Hospital, where his left leg between
i the ankle and knee was amputated by
Drs. Kane, Olmsted, Milton and Meiggs
this afternoon.
The accident occurred just the other
side of Wrights in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, about 3:30 o'clock this morning. At
that hour the freight train was going
down the grade through a big cut. Chace
was on the top of a box car putting on
the brake. Somehow the spindle part of
the braks got out of position and Chace
was hurled off the car and struck violent
ly against one of the banks of the cut,
his body then rolling down to the tracks.
Three cars passed over his left leg, and
he was not missed from the train until
nearly an hour later. In the interim the
injured man lighted a match to see how
badly he was hurt and tied a handker
chief just above the crushed portion of
the limb.
When help finally came he was uncon
scious and war- lying on the track. He
was taken to Santa Cruz, where his Inju
ries were temporarily dressed, and by a
special he was conveyed to Oakland.
Charles Chace is a brother-in-law of
Cotton Bros., the well known contractors.
He is 25 years old and resided with his
wife and child at Boulder Creek.
Murderous Chines; Identified.
OAKLAND, Nov. 13. â The police have
ascertained the name of the Chinaman
who murderously assaulted Ah Kirn with
a knife on the McElrath place yesterday.
He Is Lim Kom, and his American name
is Ah Jim. To-day a friend of the mur
derous Mongolian called at the vegetable
gardens inquiring after him ajid gave out
his right name. On further search at the
cabin Lim Kom's photo and passport were
found, and the police feel confident now
that he will be located.

' Placards.
w
ALAMEDA, Nov. 13.â The City Clerk of
Alameda has made a frantic but futile ef
fort to enrich the municipal treasury to
the extent of a round $5000 at the ex
pense of every candidate for office who
posted or caused to be displayed wunin
Alameda's corporate limits a card an
nouncing his candidacy. This city was a
great point of interest to the politician,
and the fences and deadwalls were cover
ed with political cards until sections of
the town appeared like huge checker
boards. The day after election the City
Clerk struck upon the idea that every
candidate was a bill poster, or at least
the person was who tacked up his signs.
There is a bill poster's license in Alameda
of $25 per annum.
The Clerk made up a list of over 200
candidates who had used the fences and
walls of the city to advertise them
selves. He prepared licenses for them and
sought the City Marshal to instruct him
to make collections. It so hapened tnat
the Marshal was the successful Republi
can nominee for Sheriff. He was willing
to donate $25 to the city, but said he did
not have the heart to ask the host or
defeated office-seekers, who figured up
about 90 per cent of the list, to pay Ala
meda for using her advertising space
when the city did not give them votes
enough to indicate that any of her citi
zens nad seen their announcements.
City Attorney Taylor, State Senator
elect, was asked for a legal opinion upon
the question, and stated offhandedly that
if the law was strictly construed the
candidates or their friends might be made
to take out a bill poster's license, but
that as most of the nominees had been
snowed out of sight it would be a hard
matter to find them. "And besides," said
Mr. Taylor, "I don't supose many of them
have $25 left; and if we proceeded against
them and convicted them for violating a
city ordinance they would have to go to
jail for lack of funds to pay their fines.
I do not believe in taking such an undue
advantage of a defeated foe."
NO ALAMEDA DAY.
Encinal City May Not Be Repre
sented at Oakland's Show.
AT.AMEDA, Nov. 13.â 1t is not likely
that this city will have a day at the Ala
meda County Industrial Exposition now
being held in Oakland. Agents of the
Realty Syndicate, which owns the elec
tric line running between the two cities,
have been making efforts to interest cer
tain of the city officials in the matter, but
have met with little encouragement. The
gentlemen appealed to refuse to take a
hand in the project for the reason, they
assert, that they were not treated fairly
last year by the transportation company.
During the exposition of 1897 Alameda
citizens went to considerable expense ar
ranging and carrying out a programme
for an Alameda day. Among other ex
penditures was the hire of a braes band.
As the streetcar company received all the
benefit of the day, it was solicited to "pay
the pipers." but the officers refused to
put up a cent. A few daysÂ«ago, when the
company's agents were endeavoring to in
terest the Alamedans in another Alameda
day, the action of last year was thrown
at them wherever they went, and the
citizens who are generally foremost in
such undertakings positively refused to
give any assistance.
Alameda News Notes.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 13.â Residents of the
eastern end of the city are endeavoring
to persuade the narrow-gauge railroad to
establish a telegraph office and freight
station at High street.
Carita Chapter, Order of Eastern Star,
will give an entertainment Wednesday
evening in Masonic Temple.
The celebration in honor of the Re
publican victory given last evening at
West Alameda under the auspices of the
Young Men's Republican Club was a suc
cessful affair and largely attended. Many
of the victorious candidates were present
and made timely addresses. After the
speech-making there was a spread of
light liquid and solid refreshments.
Christian Peterson of Taylor avenue
has been appointed by the Board of
Health to assist Veterinary Inspector
Carpenter in making a physical examina
tion of the cows belonging to the dairies
supplying Alameda with milk.
RAILROAD \VTIECK.
A Locomotive and Two Cars Demol
ished.
BERKELEY. Nov. 13.â A combination
train on the California-Nevada Railroad
was wrecked four miles above San Pablo,
near Lineer's ranch, at 10 o'clock this
morning-. The railroad is constructed be
tween Station B and Orinda Park and this
morning a large number of pleasure-seek
ers boarded the 9 a. m. train expecting to
spend the day at the end of the line.
When the train reached the point men
tioned the locomotive drivers dropped
down between loosened rails and in an
instant it was piled up in the ditch several
feet from the track and two freight cars
were demolished. It Is fortunate for the
paseengc-rs that the coaches were in the
rear of the train, as there wpuld have
been a wholesale loss of lfre had they
been In the place of the freight cars. The
trainmen escaped with a few bruises. It
will be several days before the engine can
be placed on the rails again.
BERKELEY'S NEW SINGERS.
The University of California Glee
Club Makes Its Annual Selec
tion of Voices.
BERKELEY. Nov. 13.â The musical as
soctationS of the University of California
have chosen their new members. The se
lection has been in progress since the
opening of the college term, and each can
didate has been subject to a long test,
made keen by competition. Out of the
numerous applicants for membership the
following' have been added to the clubs:
Dv Ray Smith, J. Clement Arnold. G. Clarke
RriKKR. Henry C. Meione, Mark H. White, Har
ley M. Leete, Forest B. Caldwell and A. Ho
ratio Cogswell, to the glee club; O. H.

Kaarsberg Will Play To-Morrow.
BERKELEY, Nov. 13. â Kaarsberg,
Berkeley's fullback in the big eleven foot
ball team, has recovered from his recent
attack of blood poisoning. He is now
able to leave the training quarters and be
present on the field. Coach Cochran ex
pects him to take part in the regular foot
ball practice upon the college campus to
morrow afternoon.
To Discuss a Police Court.
BERKELEY. Nov 13.â The Board of
Trustees is to meet to-morrow night in
the Town Hall, and among other things
will discuss the matter of a Berkeley
Police Court. Town Attorney Hayne at
tributes the failure of the last charter
amendment, providing for such a court,
the fact that the amendment pro
vided for the judge to hold office by ap
pointment from the Board of Trustees.
He thinks that a similar measure, chang
ing the method of appointment to that of
election by the people, would meet with
the hearty approval of all the voters, and
so will recommend another special elec
tion upon an amendment to the clty'3
charter embodying that special alteration.

THE LABORS
OF THE CODE
COMMISSION
Condensing Statutes
of the State.
OF GREAT VALUE TO LAWYERS
SHANTAHAN TELLS WHAT HAS
BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.
The Civil and Political Codes Will Be
Presented to the Legislature in
Two Separate Bills â Other
Improvements.
The Code Commissioners, Messrs. Cam
lnetti, Shanahan and Bulia, have per
formed a great deal of labor since their
appointment, as will be seen by the fact
that they will present to the next Legis
lature the Civil and Political Codes com
plete in two separate bills. In addition
to this the umendemnts to the Code of
Civil Procedure and Penal Code rendered
necessary by the revision of the Civil and
Political Code will be presented. .
The commission has nearly completed a
volume of uncodifled statutes taken from
the statutory laws of the State, carrying
the laws in force adopted from 1850 to the
present time that are not embraced in the
codes.
â¢ I Another important matter to attorneys
I and litigants is the fact where the Su
preme Court has given an exact meaning
to any section of the code by a decision
concerning it, the language of the court
is included in the section as being the ex
act law.
In speaking of the labors of the com-
I mission yesterday Commissioner Shana
han said:
"The Code of Civil Procedure and the
Penal Code cannot be presented complete
ly revised at the coming session. A great
proportion of the labor involved in these
two codes has been accomplished and this
work has required the consideration of
every section of the code that will be pre
sented as well as the statutes and the
Supreme Court reports.
"We are endeavoring to condense tho
j laws of the State as they stand to-day into
j five comprehensive volumes, instead of
the four codes, the statutes of each ses
sion of the Legislature since the organi
1 zation of the State and the 120 volumes of
j Supreme Court reports. The result will be
I of great value to litigants and attorneys?.
"Senator Bulla's division of the work
was largely confined to the laws affect
ing municipal corporations. These were
embraced in about seventy-five statutes
which required weeks of time of a good
lawyer to carefully work through and get
his 'points. These volumes have been so
condensed and classified that the same
work can now be accomplished in a few
minutes. Mr. Bulla's codification is com
pleted and has been adopted by the
board."
The laws governing counties and town
ships were assigned to Commissioner
Caminetti, who has about completed his
labors. Mr. Shanahan's department was
State offices and institutions and the
whole question qf taxation. Of these he
has completed the codifying of the tax
I laws. The unfinished work of the com
! mission will perforce be submitted to the
Legislature two years hence.

MURDER WAS
DONE BUT THE
PLAY WENT ON
Chung Yet Gen Killed
in a Theater.
THE SHOW UNINTERRUPTED
AUDIENCE WATCHED ONLY THE
FEIGNED TRAGEDY.
Murdered Man Was the Third Victim
of Highbinders' Bullets in
the Bloody Tailors'
War.
Chung Yet Gen wns phot by an un
known man in the Jackson-street Thea
ter shortly before 9 o'clock last evening
while the performance was going on. The
wounded man staggered from his Beat
to the center aisle and dropped dead.
â VThen the shots rang out the large crowd
in attendance rushed from the theater,
but within a few minutes returned an!
the play continued with but a few min
utes' intermission.
While the dead man lay weltering In
his blood the tomtoms kept up their In
cessant din, the actors spoke their parts
with their squeaky voices and the audi
ence, unmoved by the murder, eagerly
watched the feigned tragedy on the stage
unmindful of the real one to which they
had been witnesses. Those sitting near
the corpse, seemingly indifferent to its
proximity, calmly puffed their cigars and
spat on the floor, their spittle mingling
with the blood of the dead.
The shooting took place directly after
the ten-cent crowd had been admitted to
the theater, and the place was packed.
Three shots rang out and the old gate
keeper who, from experience knew what
it meant, endeavored to throw open the
gates, but before he could do so was car
ried down the stairs by the Chinamen en
deavoring to leave the place. Police offi
cers who heard the shots hurried to the
theater, but were unable to find the mur
derer, who made his escape during the
excitement.
Chung 1 Yet Gen was a tailor employed
by D. Wing, at 61S Merchant street, and
was one of the men upon whose head a
price had been placed by the Gim Vet
tong. Early in June six tailors broke
away from this tong and organized a new \
one. which they called the Leont,- Vi tone,
with headquarters at the corner of StOCK
ton and Jackson streets. The Gim Yees
immediately raised $2Cmj, which they of
fered for the murder of the six bolters.
The offer first bore fruit on June 12, i
when Charley King, a cousin of Little I
Pete, was killed. Mock Foo, who was i
shot In the Washington-street Theater,
on October 25, was the second victim and i
Chung Yet Gen the third. Of the three !
that are still alive the name of one is j
unknown to the police. The other two art :
Tom Ah Hin and D. Wing. The price |
on the head of the latter is said to be
$600, and he is in mortal fear of losing his
life. Last week he went to Sacramento
ostensibly on business, but really, it is
believed to avoid the highbinders' bul
lets. He returned yesterday and last
evening visited the Morgue to see the
body of Chung Yet Gen. He said that the
dead man had been employed in his es
tablishment about three months and
that he was not aware that there was a
price on his head.
While three shots were said to have
been fired only two can be traced. One
entered under the left shoulder blade of
Chung Yet Gen, passed through the aeart
and made its exit from the right breast,
lodging in the clothing. The other wa&
found imbedded on the bench on which
the man had been sitting when shot.
Although the war against the tailors is
believed to be the cause of the shooting,
the highbinders had another grievance
against the murdered man. When Lum
Sler was shot in Bartlett alley last March
ana Officer Tracey received a bullet in
his arm in an endeavor to arrest Man
Nod, who was the alleged murderer,
Chung Yet Gen claimed to have been
present. He was a member of the Tsuey
Ying ton, to which Lum Sier belonged,
and in court testified against Mah Non, a
member of the Tsuey Sings, and while
Mah Xon was not convicted Chung was in
bad odor with the members of the latter
tong.
Detectives Gibson and Wren and Offi
cer George McMahon have been detailed
on the case and are making every effort
to find the murderer.

BALLOON ASCENSION.
Professor Hagul, Aeronaut, Failed to
Connect at G-len Park.
The balloon went up beautifully yester
day afternoon at Glen Park, but Profes
sor Hagal, who was advertised to make
the ascension, did not accompany it, and
the affair was a fizzle. Considerable trou
ble was experienced in holding the balloon
down while it was being filled with gaso
line vapors, a crowd of men and boys be
ing pressed into service for that purpose
Hagal appeared to be very much excited,
and at the critical moment, when the
balloon broke away from those holding it,
he failed to connect and it wont up with
out him. Considerable disappointment re
sulted among the 2000 or 3wO people pres
ent, and Manager Baldwin was very
wrothy.
Hagal explained the fia-sco by claiming
that the balloon was not filled sufficiently
to carry him up, and there were i.ot men
enough to hold it down. Some one was
unkind enough to say that Hagal was
afraid to go up on account of the high
â¢wind prevailing, but this he denied.
Later in the day Charles Conlon under
took the difficult task and succeeded in
making one of the best ascensions ever
witnessed in this city.
The other attractions on the grounds
were more or less patronized, and a band
added to the enjoyment of the day.

OPENING DAY
AT INGLESIDE
RACETRACK
University Stake Will
Be Contested.
EASTERN SPRINTERS TO RUN
COIN WON BY STABLES AT THE
OAKLAND MEETING.
Thorpe and Butter Tied in the dum
ber of Winning Mounts â Pig
gott a Good Thirdâ Chase
Sale of Yearlings.
Oakland track has had its turn at the
bat and now Ingleside will have a try at
the racing game. The sport at the track
across the bay was fresh and invigorating
and the talent made money. There was a
lack of Eastern racing material, whose
presence always lends additional en
chantment, but taken ail in all the racing
was far above the average. To-day In
gleside, the track whose destiny is looked
after by Edward Corrigan, will reopen its
gates for a half-monthly meeting. The
programme for the first day bears a
heavy look, and if padding was not re
sorted to some excellent sport should be
witnessed. In the stand Edwin F. Smith,
the popular Sacramento racing official
and secretary of the State Agricultural
Society will preside, with Harry Kuhl of
Chicago as associate. The starting will
be in the hands of the seasoned veteran
James F. Caldwell, who will no doubt up
hold his reputation as the "Prince of
Starters." '
MLi Bt of the purse and stake money hung
up at Oakland was divided among Cali
fornia owners. The "sweep made by
Burns Waterhouse on the opening day
of the season gave them a long lead over
the other owners, though the Cambridge

DONKEYS MUST WEAR BLOOMERS.
Startling Innovation for the Children's Pets in Golden Gate Park.
Humiliating to the Burros.
THE donkeys at the Children's Playground in Golden Gate Park will here
after have their nether limbs garmented in hose and bloomers.
This startling innovation In the attire of the patient little beasts is not a
result of a mural crusade of a local Anthony Comstock, nor has Secretary
Frank Kane of the anti-vice society passed judgment that the children's pets
were making immodest display of their extremities. The order for hose and
bloomers for the donkeys comes from Charlie Holbrook, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as a means by which the patient
beasts may be protected from the onslaughts of millions of horse flies and yel
low jackets, that for the past week have bitten the donkeys' legs until the blood
flowed. Murphy, the keeper of the pets, has done all in his power to prevent the
pests from doing their bloody work, but to no purpose, and in desperation he
sent for Mr. Holbrook. Said he:
"It'B meself that has graced the ligs of the bastes with vasollne until the
â¢ donkey tracks looks loike the turn-table of a locomotive. Divil a bit of good
does it do. The pests ate up the grace and then go for the ligs again. The flies
won't bother the goats. I suppose on account of the smill."
Holbrook was thoughtful for a few minutes, and then gave the order to have
the legs of the little sufferers covered with hose from the hoofs to where the hair
is thick.
"Orders is orders," said Murphy, and he went to work. "I've done all koinds
of work, but niver before have I been the dressmaker for a donkey," he re
marked.
The first tailor-made suit was like Joseph's coat â of many colors and de
signs. The hose for the front legs were made over from the lower coverings of
a golf-player. The dress for the part of the donkey furthest from the head is a
wonderful creation. It has a history.
Months ago a lady cyclist smashed her bike and tore her habit in a collision
with a sprinkling cart. She sent home for her street suit, and never called for
the bicycle suit. By the clever manipulation of a pair of shears Murphy altered
the discarded garment so that the donkey could switch off the flies. Then the
garment was "a perfect fit." By the use of a few safety pins and straps Mur
phy's creation was completed.
A more humiliated animal never existed than the one upon which it was
tried. It was shunned by its companions and made a laughing stock of the goat
pen. The ladies who visited the park did not know whether to be shocked or
amused, but Murphy was happy. He had saved his charge from the fly pest. Now
he ia making wardrobes for the entire herd.

PAID HIS BET IN
HIS UNDERCLOTHES
AS the great political campaign waxed warm on the city front, a
novel bet was made â on the election of their respective candi
dates for Governorâ by J. B. Riley (R.) and Henry Steffens (D.),
the loser to walk around the block bounded by Howard, Main,
Mission and Spear streets In his underclothes.
Mr. Steffens was game; and, attired only in a suit of light gray
Scotch underclothing and a forced smile, paid the bet, at about 8:30
o'clock yesterday morning, in the presence of a crowd of spectators
of such dimensions as to impede travel on the Howard street line.
Mr. Riley was also present â clothed and, as his partisanship
clearly indicated, in his right mind.
BIG INDIAN
DESIRED TO
TRADE WIVES
Esquimau Chief Made
the Proposal.
CAPTAIN M'GREGOR SAID NO
amusing incident on the
karltjb: in the auctic.
Mrs. Laura McGregor, Who Braved
Great Dangers, Tells of Her
Experience in the Frozen
Regions.
Mrs. Laura McGregor, who spent seven
Mrs. Laura McGregor.
months In the Arctic seas with her hus
band. Captain McGregor of the steam
whaler Karluk, had a singular experience
while sojourning in that frozen country.
One day while the vessel was at anchor
some Esquimaux came aboard, and the
chief of the tribe appeared to be much
fascinated with Mrs. McGregor, who is a
prepossessing woman. He had nothing
but the pleasanteat smiles for that lady,
while on his ugly squaw, who accompa
nied him, he cast dark and forbidding
looks.
Finally the old chief went up to Cap
tain McGregor and proposed that they ex
change wives. The latter laughed at the
proposition, thinking it a huge joke, but
for several days after that the Esquimau
continued his advances for an exchange,
and as it was all very bothersome to
Mrs. McGregor the old chief was ordered
from the vessel and went away grunting
with 'dissatisfaction.
Mrs. McGregor, who has made three
trips with her husband, is now in the city
and brought back with her a valuable
collection of curios, all the handiwork of
the Esquimaux, which were exchanged
for articles which she took up with her.
A slight knowledge of the native lan
guage helped her in her bartering opera
tions and she has made a number of
friends among the people of the frozen
regions.
In speaking of her experience Mrs. Mc-
Gregor said;
"I believe that I am the only woman
who has spent a complete season in the
Bering Btraits. and while I am perfectly
delighted with my experiences I must
say that the hardships which a lady must
endure are too great for me to brave the
dangers again. While I felt perfectly be
cure with my husband the trip to and fro
was exceedingly rough. One good fea
ture of the voyage was that we were not
caught in the ice. In addition to a vast
quantity of curios I also brought back a
beautiful owl, caught at Point Barrow,
which 1 intended to present to some insti
tution, but unfortunately it died on the
way home.

the rest of us and their greatest pleasure

In exchange to a female Esquimau who
coveted It. As for hats which I trimmed
with the wings of native birds, they fair
ly went wild over them and when they
were dressed In our fashion the effect
was ludicrous in the extreme.
"On the way up I had no hesitation In
making visits to the eastern or Alaskan
shore, but the western o r Siberian coast I
left severely alone, as the natives had
such sinister looks and were rather dis
reputable. I went ashore on East Cape,
where I had a delightful ride in a sled
drawn by dogs. The costume in the pic
ture is made entirely of reindeer skins,
according to a pattern designed by my
self. 1 assure you it came in handy in
the fall when the weather was rugged. It
was then that polar bears were in evi
dence, and though I tried to shoot some
with a rifle, I am sure I did not kill any.
I had a strong desire to go on Wrangel
Island, but as the intervening ice was
some twenty-five miles In extent I
changed my mind in that regard.
"I am glad to get back home and will
now make an extended Eastern trip and
when summer comes again I will proba
bly long for the icy climate of the Arctic

ROBBED OF
HIS WIFE AND
BADLY BEATEN
Marital Troubles of a
Stonecutter.
WILLIAM M'DERMOTT'S WOES
HE ATTEMPTED TO CHASTISE A
GAY MUSICIAN.
Gets the Worst of the Encounter
and Is Locked Up on
the Charge of
Battery.
The Inmates of the Grand Southern Ho
tel at Seventh and Mission streets were
treated to a lively flstic encounter last
evening. Determined to wreak ven
geance on the man who had alienated the
affections of his wife, William McDer
mott, a stonecutter, proceeded to annini
late Rudolph Patek, the usurper of his
happiness, and was himself severely
beaten.
Patek is a well known musician. Some
time ago he separated from his wife, who
has quite a reputation as a public singer.
McDermott, it is claimed, learned that
the gay musician was rather too friendly
with his better half, and he started an in
vestigation. According to his story, he
learned that they were living together as
man and wife in the Grand Southern Ho
tel, and he determined to watch them.
Renting a room adjoining the apartments
occupied by Patek and Mrs. McDermott,
he awaited developments.
Soon after 5 o'clock last evening he be
came convinced that his suspicions were
correct, and he resolved to chastise the
man who had won the affections of his
wife. Just as was about to rap for
admittance the latter appeared and asked
him what he wanted.
"You have robbed me of my wife," ex
citedly declared McDermott, 'and I de
mand satisfaction."
Before Patek could reply the Injured
husband aimed a blow at liis face, but
failed to land. Patek, who was trembling
with fear, was armed with a cane, and
as McDermott rolled up his sleeves pre
paratory to renewing the assault he
brought the stick down on his head. The
blow dazed McDermott. and as he stag
gered against the wall Patek again struck
him with the cane, inflicting an ugly
wound over the right eye.
With an oath McDermott turned on his
assailant and vainly endeavored to dis
possess him of the cane. Patek, becoming
alarmed for his own safety, dropped the
walking stick and ran from the house.
Although coatless and hatless, McDer
mott pursued him, calling upon him to
stop under penalty of being riddled wka
bullets, but the musician continued run-
n After crossing Market street he ran up
McAllister pursued by MeDermott. As
the two men dashed along the latter street
Policemen Buckley and Green joined in
the chase, and after a short run succeed
ed in overtaking them. They were then
marched to the City Prison and charged
â¢A short time after they were booked
Mrs Patek appeared and roundly scored
her husband for his conduct.
Tossing a $20 gold piece on the desk Mrs.
Patek announced that the amount was for
the release of McDermott.
"If that is not sufficient," she declared
In tones that could not be mistaken, 1
have plenty more."
"This man," pointing to her husband.
"his ruined Mr. McDermott's home, and
to add Insult to injury he assaulted him.
Patek had $20 in his possession and he
gladly put it up as bail money. Both men
were then released, Patek showing a dis
positlon to remain in the prison until his
wife was some distance away.
To a reporter Mrs. Patek said she mar
ried hor husband about eleven years ago
in Austria. After coming to this city she
secured an engagement at the^Tivoli and
with the money she earned she and her
husband made a trip to Europe.
"Some time ago/ she said we took
Mrs McDermott into our house just
through charity. She was sick and pen
niless and as she seemed to be in nee<l. I
gladly allowed her to share our home In
a short time I noticed that my husband
was extremely attentive to her. and when
I questioned him he admitted his guilt.
After discussing the matter we signed a
written agreement to live apart. Since
then I understand he has been living with
this woman. Rather than see Mr. Mc-
Dermott remain in jail I put up his bail,
so that my husband would not have the
a it g IsÂ°understood that McDermott will
to-day swear out warrants for the arrest
of his wife and Patek.
A ITNTON MASS MEETING.
Members of the Various Protestant
Churches Hold Religious
Exercises.
The annual union mass meeting of the
Protestant churches throughout the city
was held yesterday afternoon at the
Young Men's Christian Association Audi
torium, with a success far beyond the
most sanguine expectations of those di
rectly in charge.
The object of the meeting was the in
struction of men a.nd women, and differed
from the usual Sunday afternoon religious
exercises, which are generally reserved
exclusively for the teaching of young men
in the various duties of their church.
A feature of the ceremony was an elo
nuent and instructive address by the Rev.
Dr Curry, one of the prominent ministers
of the Protestant Church. In it he em
phasized the duty which every member of
the Protestant faith owes to the church,
to God and to himself.
He spoke of a Christian life as one in
which those who adhered to its doctrines
would inevitably find the greatest happi
ness, inasmuch as they renounce the
snares of the world to conform to the
highest and purest ideal of human exist-
ence.
The address was closed with an earnest
appeal to those present to practice and
endeavor to spread the teachings and va
rious doctrines of their religion.
The meeting, which was closed for the
day with an oral hymn by the entire au
dience, will be extended through the
greater part of the present month.
