BEDECKED THEIR WAY
AN ENTHUSIASTIC FAREWELL AS THE TRAIN MOVES OFF.
THE ARTILLERYMEN PRESS THEIR WAY TO WAR THROUGH CHEERIG CROWDS OF FRIENDS
WHATEVER fate may
have in store for the
soldier lads who went
from San Francisco
yesterday it must be they
will remember that this city
sent them forth with words
of cheer, with a hope for
their safety, a benison for
their loyal courage. They can
hardly forget, even though on
an alien shore, that here by
the Pacific thousands are
thinking of them and hoping
that the god of battles shall
protect them as they fight for
the honor of the flag.
The march from the Presi
dio to the cars was more than
a good-by, it was an ovation.
The wav was strewn with
The San Francisco Call
flowers. Children waved the
Star and Stripes in miniature,
women wept from very sym
pathy, men shouted until
hoarse. Yet the soldiers,
trained to duty, hardly looked
to the right or to the left.
They had made their fare
wells. They had kissed their
wives and their sweethearts.
There was nothing for them
to do but obey the orders
which called them to the
South and, perhaps, beyond,
where a foe is in waiting and
the terror of malady stalks
throughout the season just
opening. They had not com
plained. On the contrary,
they had manifested an
eagerness to go.

McKINLEY'S ULTIMATUM
GIVING THE SPANISH
UNTIL SATURDAY NEXT
NEW YORK, April 19.â 0n Wednesday at 10 a. m. President McKinley will sign the resolution of
Congress and his ultimatum to Spain. The ultimatum will be at once transmitted to Minister Woodford.
On Wednesday at 5 p. m., Madrid time, the ultimatum will be presented to Senor Gullon, Spanish
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
On Saturday at 6 a. m., Madrid time, Spain's time for replying to the ultimatum and acceding to
the demands of Congress will have expired.
On Saturday at 1:18 n. m. orders will be sent to Captain Sampson at Key West to move his fleet
upon Havana, unless Spain has backed down. (10:18 p. m. on Friday at San Francisco.)
The difference in time between Washington and Madrid is four hours and forty-two minutes.
The President's ultimatum demands that Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in
the island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.

ruled by the people. They
feel that they have a part in
the great events now happen
ing, for to them the departure
of the troops is a great event
It is the portent of war. To
many' the war which so
nearly divided this country is
a matter of history. It is
true that the veteran who
survived it may not yet be
old, but the world grows fast,
and people in the prime
of life know of the great civil
struggle only what they have
read or been told. So this is
the first time they have had
their patriotism aroused.
Not until now have they
understood what emotions
are aroused when the flag is
assailed. The troops march
ing away constitute an object
lesson. The sound of martial
music carries the old soldier
back to the field of Gettys
burg and to Chancellorsville.
On one field the blue was
victorious, on the other the
gray. But what matters it
now ? To-day there is one
country, and side by side the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
North and the South are
ready to sustain the common
weal. The veteran of the
Federal army seeks counsel
of the veteran of the Confed
eracy. The same blood runs
in the veins of both.
Yesterday a martial spirit
seemed to pervade the air.
Long before the hour set for
the light artillery to leave its
quarters the streets leading
thence to the depot were lined
with representatives of every
class. Society was there,
school children by the thou
sand, every little American
contributing to the occasion an
enthusiastic treble, every little
hand clasping a flag which
was wildly waved. But per2
GALLANT ARMY HEROES.
Colonel Miles and Lieutenant Colonel Bisbee,
Leaders of the First Infantry.
THE COMMANDER OF THE HISTORIC FIRST REGIMENT A
VETERAN OFFICER WHO HAS FOUGHT MANY BATTLES,
Colonel Evan Miles. First United States Infantry, who leaves to-day for the front at the head of his superb regi
ment, Is a veteran officer who has rendered his country distinguished service on many battlefields of the South and
on the frontier. Since the war he has had his full share of border service and acquitted himself nobly in the
campaigns against the hostile Indians. The advancement of Colonei Miles has not been secured by the aid of influ
ential friends in high places. If a political "pull" had been exerted in his behalf he would be holding the rank of
brigadier-general at this time
Colonel Miles was born In Pennsylvania March 28, lSSS.and was appointed from the State first lieutenant of the
Twelfth Infantry August 5, 1861. He was promoted captain January 26, 1865, and transferred to the Twenty-first In
fantry September 21. IM>6. He was promoted major of the Twenty-fourth Infantry April 24, ISSS. He was subsequent
ly promoted lieutenant-colonel and colonel of the First Infantry.
He was commended for bravery and efficiency while serving on the staff of Major-General Ayers, commanding
the Second Division of the Fifth Army Corps. In the battles of Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wilderness, Weldon
Railroad and Chappie House he gained distinction for bravery and skill In action. Official reports and the recom
mendations of army commanders attest to the value of his services on the field. Colonel Miles wajs highly praised
In official reports of General O. O. Howard, commanding the department of the Columbia, for gallantry and efficiency
displayed during the battle of Clearwater, Idaho, against the hostile Nez Perces, on the 11th and 12th of Jup\ 1577, and
the battle of Umatilla Agency, Oregon, against the .annotk-Piute Indians, on the 13th of July, 1878.
In a letter to President Hayes General O. O. Howard wrote: "I wish to say a few words concerning: a worthy
officer â Captain Evan Miles, Twenty-llrst United States Infantry- He has had an important command under me In
two remarkable Indian campaigns. His record is as good as it can be. In one action he had control of the field, was
successful, and his name found its way with brightest praise in the journals of the day." In this letter General How
ard spoke of the long service and excellent military record of Captain Miles.
In a letter signed by many of the Western Senators and Representatives, and addressed to the Secretary of War,
mention is made of the memorable campaign against the -ostiles. It was written: "The forced march and victory
of Captain Miles, Twenty-first United States Infantry, was the means of saving the town of Pendleton, Or., from
being burned by the Indians and several hundred people from being massacred."
The citizens of Pendleton wrote a letter to the Secretary of War in which they spoke of Captain Miles In the
highest manner of commendation. This extract is taken from the letter:
"In July, 1818, our country was in the hands of the hostile Indians. Many of our citizens were massacred and
vast property was destroyed. But for the excellent conduct of Captain Miles and his small command the neighboring
tribes of Indians, already allied to the Bannock-Piutos, would have destroyed everything before them. By the gallant
conduct of this officer the town of Pendleton was saved from destruction and our Government was saved hundreds
of thousands of dollars."
The successful campaign conducted by Captain Miles' small command, and the complete victory won in the bat
tle of Umatilla Agency, restored lasting peace to the settlers of that region of country. The hostile Indians received
a lesson that they did not soon forget.
The military record of Colonel Miles embraces mention of active and gallant service in the field and excellent
administrative ability in the command of garrisons. He served in New York City during the riots of 1863, and when
relieved of responsible duty there went to the front again. Since the war he has been stationed in New York Ne
braska, Wisconsin. Idaho, Dakota, Montana, Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado
and Wyoming.
In 1597 he was promoted from lieutenant-colonel to colonel of the First Infantry. When the Fifth Artillery was
ordered to New York Miles succeeded General Graham as commander of the post at the Presidio. It is a
position that requires military judgment and executive ability of high degree. Colonel Miles has fulfilled every re
quirement of the station. He has many friends in the army and In civil life. He goes tojhe front to-day leading as
gallant a regiment of Americans as ever went forth to uphold the honor of the country.
Lieutenant-Colonel William H. Bisbee, First United States Infantry, who leaves San Francisco to-day with his
renowned regiment, has a bright military record. He was born in Rhode Island January 2S, 1840, and gained his ad
vancement from the ranks to his present command. He was breveted first lieutenant for gallant and meritorious
conduct at the battle of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and was breveted captain for gallant service at the battle of Chat
tanooga. He participated in the battles of Stone River, Perryville, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, New Hope
Church, Kenesaw Mountain, Peach Tree Creek, Atlanta and Jonesboro. He was wounded in the Atlanta campaign.
haps the most striking feature
was the array of working men
who had left their toil to bid
the boys godspeed. It was
no superficial interest they
exhibited. They were earnest
and sincere. Their faces were
indices to an intent, if need
arise, to follow the regulars.
There was nowhere a jar
ring note. There was not one
who looked on but felt a per
sonal interest in the soldiers
carried by on their rumbling
artillery. "God bless you,"
was the message the soldiers
received as they went along.
At times the pressure of the
throng almost stopped them.
At the depot there was a
multitude, gay with color,
alert with enthusiasm, ready
to cheer every soldier who
came in sight. The crowd
did not melt until the train
rolled out, and on the other
side were other crowds with
as fervent a hail and farewell.
For yesterday California took
her soldier boys to her great
heart." To-day when the First
Infantry goes there will bean
even more marked demonstra
tion, as there will be no con
fusion as to the hour of start-
PRESIDIO, ADIEU.
The Bugle Sounds the Com
mand to March.
The two light batteries of the Third
United States Artillery have gone to
the front, and their going has aroused
a!! the patriotism that has so long lain
dormant in the city's breast. The
cheers that rent the air had more than
the Fourth of July ring to thf-m; the
dags that waved seemed animated by
1 sentiment more potent than the west
rrn wind; the crowds that throng.M the
streets from curb to curb had more to
shout for and more to think about than
any that has gathered in years.
The going away commenced early in
the morning, for it takes time and work
to move eight guns and their equip
ment of men, horses and accessories.
The work commenced at reveille, and
by retreat the men were speeding away
toward what the future has in store for
them.
Bags and boxes, trunks, satchels, bas
; kets and valises; bales of hay and sacks
of grain for the horses; barrels of bread,
of meat, of vegetables for the men;
blankets, tents, tent poles and cooking
utensils, everything that was movable
and belonged to the battery â were load
ed into the big army wagons and start
ed for the Southern Pacific freight
I sheds. The ambulance and its equip
| meat went with the big wagons, carry
! ing the men of the hospital corps. The
freight was all out of the post by 10
o'clock, and then there was only the
j last dinner, the good-bys at the parade
ground, and the men would be gone,
! too.
The time was all too short, for under

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APEIL 20, 1898.
the circumstances there is something
serious in saying good-by, and the men
spent their few short hours in the can
teen or sitting around the guns talking
to their friendsâ and most of these were
women.
There were not many relativesâ the
men of the batteries are all from the
East, but if they make as good an im
prossion on the Spanish heads as they
have upon the hearts here by the Gol
den Gate, their going will not have
been in vain. It was a sorry gunner
who had not at least one woman to
wish him godspeed, and there were
some who had good wishes to spare. A
few of the soldiers are married, and
the looks of the wives as' the troops
marched away robbed the scene of its
holiday air. One big corporal strode
up and down among the guns, carry
ing his little daughter, who crowed
over the preparations and laughed in
her mother's tear-stained face. A
young fellow sat near the corner of
the stable with a woman who clung to
him and seemed to begrudge even
the looks he cast away from her. She
was his mother.
Two more drew away from the
crowds and strode up and down
the road, each with a young?
woman on hts arm. Even the
gunners said it was too bad. Two had
just been married and the other two
were going to be. One man's only re
gret was his bicycle and the Presidio
roads, another said he might have felt
bad if "she" had "shown up," but, as
she was nowhere to be seen, he guessed
it was all the same.
The officers said good-by in their
quarters, and finally, when they rode
down to where the batteries stood at
ease, there was a general leave-taking,
which lasted until "attention" came
clear and sharp from the battery
buglers.
Each man sprang to his place and
stood ready. They were a good-looking
lot of fellows, all young, all quick and
eager, and all buoyed up by the
thought of a chance at last to ply their
tTade of death and destruction. The
sleek, smooth, wicked looking guns
shone in what sunlight a mournful sky
ltt past; the carriages and caiss-ms had
all been newly painted, and the men,
equipped in heavy marching order,
looked like old campaigners. Each
man wore a haversack and canteen and
a revolver or a saber. Their campaign
hats were weatherbeaten, their uni
forms were not the newest, and Cap
tain Potts of Battery F wore the only
white shirt and collar in the command.
The men were at work, and they left
behind the full dress of parade and
holiday.
"Prepare to mount," and "mount"
echoed cheerily over the parade ground
by the stables, and each man swung
iato his saddle. "By the right flank."
"Column right." chirped the bugles
again, and as the batteries swung into
line and started up the road past the
new barracks the First Infantry band,
which had been waiting, struck up
"Marching Through Georgia" and led
the column on Us way.
"God bless you, boys." "We'll see you
down there," "Good luck to you."
"Hooray, hooray," came from the
crowd, and men ran along by the guns
and shook hands with the cannoneers
just once more.
Turning in past the flag and the
headquarters, the band led the way
around the inside parade plane, down
by the officers' quarters, then halted
where the road turns off toward the
eastern gate. The air trembled with
the cheers and the "Hail Columbia"
and the good-bys and the waving hand
kerchiefs and hands, as the batteries
wound down the road and out of sight,
and then the men who had given such
a hearty farewell went back to quar
ters to prepare to go away themselves â
for the First will leave to-day, and only
the foot batteries of the Third and four
troops of the Fourth Cavalry will re
main.
ALONG THE STREETS.
A Thousand Flags Greeted the
Advancing Column.
As senior captain, Captain Potts
commanded the battalion, as well as
his own battery. He led the column
down Lombard street and turned into
Van Ness avenue, and as the leaders
swung around the corner a thousand
flags seemed to leap from the pave
ment and whirl dizzily over ten times
as many heads. The school children
were out and that was their greeting
and farewell.
Two schools had gone to the Pre
sidio, but they were just in time to see
the troops from the hill, but the chil
dren on the avenue were in readiness
and catching the note of the bugle
sounding "column right" they were on
hand with their cheers and their whis
tles, their flags and shouts of enthu
siasm as soon as the column came into
view.
There were children everywhere.
They lined the curbs and stood out in
the streets; they blocked the sidewalk
and thronged the stairways; a vacant
lot was a point of vantage to be taken
by assault, so they swarmed over it
and up the fences and along the walks,
yelling and cheering and waving flags
until the street was alive and the col
ors of their flags Wended in a whirling
screen Of pink.
As the batteries came on pandemoni
um broke loose and the old folks joined
with the young in the wave of enthusi
asm. Windows were flung open and
flags were thrust forth and waved with
a vigor that deled subjection. Women
leaned out of parlor windows and for
getting feminine dignity shook "tidies"
and table covers and sofa cushions un
til the last man of the line was far out
of sight.
As Ac column proceeded the crowds
grewjhicker and the younger element
as v,^Br ! " '''â â  "''â¢ became more boister
ous^flrfhey yelled and they hoorayed
until voices broke and throats were
husky.
The drum corps of one of the schools
beat a long roll, and the people accom
panied it with their shouts, but deeper,
more full of meaning than any shout
from the crowd, would come the sullen
rumble of the guns when they left the
smooth pavement and jolted over the
tracks that crossed their path. It is like
the warning from the rattlesnake;
there is nothing on earth just like it,
and every time the guns and caissons
fretted over rougher pavement or cross
ing car tracks it chilled the cheer â for
the men were not on parade, and the
rumbling of the guns boded no good.
At Golden Gate avenue the column
turned and forced its way through as
solid a mass of people as ever blocked
a thoroughfare. Every one ha.l a flag,
A LEADER OF ARTILLERY,
To Command the Light Batteries on the Field
of Chickamauga.
Lieutenant Colonel Wallace F, Randolph, Third United States
Artilleru, Who Has Been Assigned to Imporant Dutu.
Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace F. Randolph. Third United States Artillery, will leave here with General Shafter and
ptaff next Thursday. Orders have been received from the Secretary of War directing Colonel Randolph to proceed to
Chickamauga Park and take command of the light artillery there assembled. Colonel Randolph was probably selected
for this command for the reason that he has for the past six years been in command of the light artillery school at
Fort Riley, Kansas.
Colonel Randolph was born in Pennsylvania June 11, 1841, and entered the volunteer service as a private in
Company F, Seventeenth Pennsylvania Infantry, April IS, IS6I. He was discharged from the regiment June 2S. IMH.
On May 4, 1861, in conformity with the proclamation of the President a new regiment of twelve batteries was added
to the artillery arm of the service and became known as the Fifth. Colonel Randolph was appointed second lieuten
ant in the newly organized regiment, his commission dating from May 14, 1861. He was promoted first lieutenant March
5, ISC2, captain July 25, 1866. On April 25, 18SS, he was promoted major, and in March, IKOS. was made lieutenant-colonel
Colonel Randolph earned the brevot of captain June 14, 18G3, for gallant and meritorious service in defence ->f
Winchester, Va. He was brevetted major March V,. 1886, for good conduct and gallant services during the war.
His battery participated in the defence of Winchester, and occupied without mleciuate support an isolated, un
protected outwork, dominated by a mounta'.i- to the west within raniTj. Here the battery remained until iate 'n the
afierr.oon, when the enemy opened upon it. witl a plunging fire from sixteen gurio Many of the men and motft of the
hotM* were killed or wounded, and caiisons and limbers blown up. The battery v;ip so disabled inside of ton min
utes that it became impossible to icmove the guns. Suddenly the enemy charged with five regiments, which had
been massed behind a ridge in front.
Nothing inside the works could stop this onslaught, but the men stood by their guns until the enemy had planted
its colors on the parapet. Not till then did Randolph order his men to fall back. Lieutenant Randolph was carried
wounded into the town and fell into the hands of the Confederates.
Colonel Randolph has served continuously with his regiment since the war at posts along the Atlantic coast
from Maine to Florida. A few days ago he came to the Presidio* succeeding Colonel E. B. Williston.
Colonel Randolph's personal popularity in the army is great. The prediction is made that he will attain a high
command in the approaching with Spain. He possesses the elements of a leader and retains to-day the dash
and vigor of the youthful soldier.
too, and every one wanted space to
wave it. The shrill, piping treble of
I childish patriotism had given plxce to
j the ringing cheer that has in it as much
' of the heart as of the head; that is liko
; a draught of sparkling wine; a cheer
; that nerves a man to dare all things,
; to hear it swirling round his head if
| only once again. The men themselves
took it up and waved their hats, and
grabbing Hags from offering hands they
waved them over the crowd, shouting
j and cheering as if for this only they
I had been living.
A block down Golden Gate avenue an
enthusiastic brewery with steam up let
loose its whistle, and catching the note
the crowd joined in in a long sustained
call until the ears of every one sung
like a seashell.
On down toward Market street the
batteries went, going in single file and
leaving the remainder of the street for
the people. Along by the houses a con
stant stream of people hurried, keeping
up with the head of the column. Boys
ran ahead whistling through their
fingers. Men elbowed their way
singly, in twos and threes, and some
times dragging a woman, or may be
one on each arm. Along the edges of
the sidewalks and out into the street
the people stood tight packed like
sheep in a strange corral, and along
with the guns ran the small boy, hun
dreds of him, shouting and yelling as
he ran. Some had even climbed up by
the guns, and as it was really not a
parade the gunners let them ride.
With the basalt pavement as a basis
the guns waked the echoes of Market
street, and the frantic efforts of the
people could not drown the rumble of
th.-ir passing. But Market street is
wide, and the size of the streets was
the only thing that limited the crowds,
so from Golden Gate avenue to where
the column turned into Fourth street
the march was more like a welcome
home than the start of a journey that
will end no one knows where.. But
those on the streets had forgotten that,
and so there was nothing to hinder the
cheer, and those on the guns didn't
care, and so there was nothing to pre
vent an answering cheer, and so the
shout went back and forth until the
bugles called a halt among the freight
cars.
They loaded the cars from the frHght
rltit r ( im on King street. Dismount,
strip the horses, harness and saddles in
the sacks and the whole into those last
two box cars: horses into the stock
cars, guns and caissons on the fiat
cars; men in line and away for the
boat. ,
Every man had his own work, and
every horse had an owner. The horses
objected somewhat to stock cars, but
then they didn't know that war is
about to be declared. In they -went,
fourteen to a car. and packed close as
potted ham they bit and kicked until
they were tired. They will be more
tired still before th' y got out again, for
there is no time to lose between here
and Chickamauga.
ANOTHER CARESS.
Words of Farewell at the Rail-

through the lines of policemen and who
stood around and talked to the battery

If the Dons Refuse to Go Then

NEW YORK, April 19.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs:
President McKinley's ultimatum de
manding that the Government of Spain
at once relinquish its authority and gov
ernment in the island of Cuba and with
draw its land and naval forces from Cu
ban waters has been prepared.
The ultimatum will be transmitted
to Minister Woodford at 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning, with instruc
tions to present it immediately to the
Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs.
It will he in the form of a brief note
incorporating the resolution of Con
gress and conveying in diplomatic lan
guage the information that Spain's re
ply is expected before 6 o'clock on Sat
urday morning, Madrid time, and that
in the absence of a favorable reply by
that time the President will be com
pelled, under the terms of the resolu
tion, to employ the land and naval
forces of the United States to enforce
compliance. Simultaneously with the
transmission of the note by cable to
Minister Woodford, a copy of it will be
handed to Senor Polo de Bernabe.
Spanish Minister in Washington.
The reason for delaying the ulti
matum until to-morrow was that if
it had been sent late this evening, a3
had been intended, it would have
reached Madrid in the middle of the
night.
It was decided, therefore, to take
plenty of time in its preparation and not
send it until to-morrow. Owing- to the
difference in time between Washington
Madrid, it will probably be about 5
k to-morrow afternoon. Madrid
time, when the note is delivered to the
Spanish Government.
It will be eighteen minutes past 1
on Saturday, Washington time, when
the ultimatum expires, and when,
unless the unexpected should hap
pen and Spain should back down, or
ders will be sent to Captain Sampson
to move upon Havana with the Key
West fleet.
It was a busy day at the White House
r.'.-l one which will stand out promi
nently in the history of the country for
all time. The President rose early this
morning and was at once handed the
bulletin which had been prepared by the
t< legraph operator at the White House
announcing the action of Congress on
the Cubnn resolution.
The Cabinet began to assemble be
fore 1 1 o'clock, and by that hour all of
the President's official advisers were sit
ting about the table in the Cabinet
room. Though the subject of the ulti
matum was uppermost in every mind, it
was not the first matter discussed.
Chairman Dingley of the House
Committee of Ways and Means ar
rived at the White House iust 2s the
Cabinet was going into session nnd had
a few minutes' talk with the President
about war revenues, and this was the
first matter talked of by the Cabinet.
Secretary Gage explained to his asso
ciates what the new revenue bill was ex
pected to be and the amount of money
it would yield.
Then the question of the ultimatum
was taken up and was discussed at
length with Assistant Secretary of State
Day. who was charged with the duty of
preparing it.
â  r the general outline of the note
had been agreed upon. Assistant Secre
tary Day returned to the State Depart
ment to prepare it. Soon afterward the
Cabinet took a recess until half-past 3.
and the President went for a short walk
with Secretary of the Interior Bliss.
It was half-past i o'clock when Rep
resentative Hagcr of lowa, chairman of
the Committee of Enrolled Bills of the
House, arrived at the White House
with the enrolled copy of the Cuban re
tion for the signature of the Presi
dent. He was accompanied by Repre
sentative Overstreet of Indiana, and
Clerks Palmer of the Senate and Davis
of the House.
When Mr. Hager presented him
the resolution the President asked if
the House was in session, and on be
ing informed that it was not he said
he would not sign the resolution at
once, as the House could not be in
formed of his action.
The resolution has not yet been
6igned. It is the intention of the Presi
dent to affix his signature to it to-mor
row at 10 o'clock, just before the ulti
official action in carrying out the reso
lution will follow immediately after its
going into effect.
At the adjourned Cabinet meetinar
this afternoon Assistant Secretary Day
presented his draft of an ultimatum
drawn on the lines decided imon in the
morning. It was most carefully con
sidered by the President and his ad-
MILITIAMEN TO
HAVE THE FIRST
CALL TO SERVE
President Will Ask for Eighty
Thousand Volunteers to
Invade Cuba.
WASHINGTON, April 19.â The authoritative statement was made
at the War Department to-day that on the first call for troops only the
National Guard would be given an opportunity to volunteer for service
in war. This statement is In accordance with those made by Secrexary
Alger to the national guardsmen who called on him at? the War De
partment on Saturday when the modified Hull bill for the expansion of
the army was under consideration. Secretary Alger thinks that such
a course is in keeping- with sound discretion and the dictates of com
mon sense, for the organized militia have gone to great expense and
have devoted much time to perfecting themselves for military duty.
Any other course, he believes, would be destructive to the best interests
of the gruard. As far as practicable, the State organizations entering
the volunteer service will remain intact, the Governors of the various
States being permitted, as they were in 1861. to designate regimental
officers, which will Include those erf the grades from second lieutenant
to colonel. The President will reserve to himself the right to appoint the
staff and field officers.
Many applications have been made to the War Department for per
mission to volunteer, and among men of all creeds, nationalities and
politics there is an expressed intention and desire to uphold the honor
and the integrity of the flag of the republic.
It was stated to-day that the first call for troops would be for 80,(K)0
men, which, it is believed, will exhaust the entire available strength of
the National Guard at this time, after deducting those who are sick and
otherwise incapacitated for immediate service. The total strength of
the Guard as reported to the War Department is 113,764 men.

visers, and only a few unimportant
verbal changes were made.
The Cabinet then became a council
of war.
Lieutenant Colonel Wagner, chief of
the Bureau of Military Intelligence, and
Captain Barker of the Naval Board of
Strategy, were summoned to the White
House and discussed with the President
and Cabinet the plans which have been
made for the operations of the army and
navy on the outbreak of hostilities.
Special attention was given to the con
sideration of the first moves to be made
by the various forces. It was nearly 6
o'clock when the Cabinet finally ad
journed.
President Frank Thompson of the
Pennsylvania Railway and Senator
Hanna arrived at the White House
soon after the Cabinet meeting and had
a long conference with the President.
Mr. Thompson has been called upon by
the President to act as his official ad
viser in connection with the transporta
tion of troops and all kinds of military
supplies during the war with Spain. It
is probable that he may receive the same
military rank as Colonel Scott, also the
president of the Pennsylvania Railway,
did when he held a similar position un
der President Lincoln during the Civil
War.
President McKinley's last duty was to
do the final revision of the ultimatum to
Spain. He and Assistant Secretary Day
went over the document for the last
time to be satisfied that it was all right
before the final adjournment of the Cab
inet.
The President invited all of its mem
bers who cared to do so to call at the
White House to-morrow morning be
fore io o'clock and again read over the
ultimatum, but as all of them were per
fectly satisfied with its text, it is not
probable they will do so.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 20, 1898.
PUBLIC OPINION IN EUROPE
ON THE COMING WAR
On the Continent, Particularly With the Latin
Nations, It Is for Spain, but England Is the
Firm Friend of America,
PARIS, April 19. â To Americans reading the European newspapers the expressions of opinion regarding the
conflict between the United States and Spain are sometimes instructive and occasional// highly amusing. The
sympathies of the Continental press are almost wholly with Spain, particularly in the Latin countries, but these sym
pathies are of a quiet, p/atonic nature, based upon some vague idea or other of fraternizing against a little known
and, perhaps, an a/most barbarian foe, or upon the fear of that dimly understood but the none less terrible
bugaboo labeled the "Monroe Doctrine."
The fee/ing is mild, undefined and doctrinaire even, /ts expression sounds well enough as an exposition of
the pretty theory of the solidarity of the Latin races, but it carries no sense of deep conviction.
Very strictly in contrast are the plain, straightforward declarations of the English press and the representa
tives of all classes of English society and opinion.
From the Times downward you have no theorizing in the air, but you can hear John Bull put his foot down.
He believes the cause of peace in Cuba to be a good one; he recognizes that the fight, if fight there must be, is
not his, but he's rather sorry he's not in it.
The depth of British sympathy with the United States has evidently made an impression on French Journalists,
for several of them have set to work to minimize it. The London correspondent of the Paris Matin takes half a
column to deny its existence, saying it is merely an official pose. This ingenious writer does not kno* a single
Englishman who would not hurrah with delight if the Americans got a licking.
Figaro suggests that England is egging the United States on to war because of the increased commercial
activity which will accrue to Britain in case American productive forces are paralyzed by an outbreak of hostilities.
Of all the Paris papers Le Temps appears to be alive to the situation. It hopes the powers may induce Spain
to give up Cuba, but fears that war is inevitable.

SQUADRON FOR
THE PROTECTION
OF GULF CITIES
Navy Department Will Probably
Organize a Fourth Patrol
of Cruisers,
NSW YORK, April 13.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
There is reason to believe that a fourth squadron for the protection of
cities of the gulf coast may be formed by the Navy Department. This
force will probably act as a Southern patrol squadron, and, like the
Northern patrol squadron, of which Commodore J. A. Howell has been
placed In command, as announced in the Herald this morning, it will
be composed of one protected cruiser and four auxiliary cruisers. In
case it is finally determined to form a gailf patrol squadron its head
quarters will probably be fixed at New Orleans, where fears are enter
tained for the safety of the levees of the Mississippi River. These levees
could be destroyed without much difficulty by an enemy provided he
could reach them, and the department does not intend to allow him to
get into a position to do damage by this means.
The cruiser Newark, which will be ready for service within the
next three weeks, and will be, as formerly, the flagship of the South
Atlantic station, is the most available vessel for assignment to the
Southern patrol squadron as Its flagship. The Newark and the San
Francisco are sister ships and are, therefore, formidable.
Secretary Long and Captain A. S. Crowninshield, Chief of the Bu
reau of Navigation, have not yet determined upon the officer to assign
to the command of the Newark, but Captain A. S. Barjter, now a mem
ber of the Naval Strategic Board, is most prominently mentioned in
connection with the assignment.
Continuing his policy of placing coal within easy reach of the
North Atlantic squadron, Commander Bradford, Chief of the Bureau
of Equipment, to-day purchased 10,000 tons, which is being shipped to
Key West.
Commander Bradford has on hand many bids and can place a con
tract for any quantity without delay and within a comparatively short
time. The patriotism of several of these dealers is shown by the fact
that they have attached to their bids statements that they are not to
be considered in case of war before their acceptance or that in case a
bid is accepted coal will be delivered free on board ships or trains, the
Government to pay freightage.
fact. I am sure that if such a feeling
exists in any section of opinion in
America, that opinion was formed un
der a misconception. I am certain that
the instructions furnished to Sir Julian
Pauncefote, which I have just given to
the House, will convince the House and
the public that we have not intruded
ourselves unnecessarily."
There have been many applica
tions at the United States Embassy
and at the United States Consulate
nere this week for enlistment in the
United States army or navy. Most
of the applicants were Englishmen,
including several officers and former
officers of the British army of lieu
tenant grade. A number of engin
eers also applied, and applications
were received from women who are
desirous of serving as nurses in the
field.
A majority of those who applied for
enlistment expect to be sent to the
United States at the Government ex
pense. They were all told that the
United States officials here had no au
thority to enlist.
Lieutenant Sims, the United States
naval attache at Paris, and Colonel Al
fred E. Bates, the United States mili
tary attache here, have purchased dur
ing the week severaf large lots of am
munition, including gun cotton. The
latter, it is presumed, is to be used for
mines. All the officials concerned
maintain secrecy as to the ships which
are to carry the war munitions to the

AMERICANS MAY FIND
HAVANA IN RUINS.
Spaniards Threaten to Blow Up Their
Houses to Prevent Their Be

HAVANA. April 19.â The press of the
entire island attacks the "jingoes" and
the "sensational American press," es
pecially singling out General Lee. All
the articles are written at high ten
sion and are full of bellicose ardor. The
writers recall the history of Spain and
particularly the diplomatic victory
over Prince Bismarck in the Carolines.
The Spanish are easily excited to en
thusiasm, as the prospect placed be
fore them by these inflammatory arti
cles refer to adding to the country's
glories a triumph over the powerful
American people. They take It as an
insult if American superiority is sug
gested.
Senor Ramon Calban, a leading mer
chant, said in the presence of this cor
respondent: "I wish there were war
to-morrow and I would give my life to
see a victory over the Yankees."
Others say, for instance: "The Yan
kees will not take Havana, but if they
should, they will only find ruins."
Some emphatically declare that they
would prefer to blow up their own
houses rather than have them taken
by the Americans. There is a good
deal said along this line.
The exchange is still falling. Pro
visions are rising in price, although
still abundant. There is great activ
ity in military centers. Everything in
dicates the beginning of the end.

Queen Regent's Speech Accuses
the United States of
Planning War.
MADRID. April 19.â 1t was ru
mored in town this evening that Gen
eral Woodford would leave to-mor
row, but he has authorized a formal
denial of the report. Madrid is quiet
and prepared to meet developments.
The supporters of the Government
in both houses of Parliament met in
the Senate chamber at 5 o'clock this
evening. Senor Sagasta, tin Premier,
addressed them as follows:
"The times are so grave and the
circumstances are so exceptional that
acts and not words are necessary to
face the present difficulty. Attempts
are being made to sully the glorious
history of Spain by an infamous cal-
umny. Different Spanish govern
ments have done their utmost to
avert the war to which we are being
provoked.
"We have now reached
the limit o? concessions
compatible with honor and
territorial integrity.
"We consented to the last conces
sion at the instance of the Pope and
powers. We yielded in facts, but now
attempts are made on our honor and
the menaces directed against our ter
ritory. That is f thing to wnich
Spaniards will never consent. (Ap
plause.)
"This is not the moment to trace
a parliamentary programme, but the
moment to unite ourselves, as our
fathers have before, in the face of an
odious attempt against the integrity
of our territory. The insult offered
us to-day is the most infamous that
has ever been offered.'' (Prolonged
applause.)
Continuing, Senor Sagasta coun
seled rapid consideration by the
Chambers in order to afford means to
defend the country's integrity. He
added: "Spain will not allow one
parcel of her territoi-y to be taken
from her with impunity; nor will
she be a party to any trafficking for
her possessions." (Prolonged and en
thusiastic applause.)
The Ministers met to-day to mod
ify the speech from the throne in con
formity with the situation. Senor
Silvela, leader of the dissident Con
servatives, when addressing his
party, declared it inopportune to
formulate a political programme.
He evoked the memory of the late
Senor Canovas del Castillo, and de
clared that he and his party would
aid the Government by voting as
much as should be necessary for the
national defense without any oppo
sition, although making note of the
responsibility incurred, in order to
investigate, if need be, at a more op
portune time. He declared also that
the dissident Conservatives would
respect whatever financial arrange
ments the Government might enter
into, no matter what these might
cost, as it was the only means of se
curing later on peace with honor.
Seldom has there been witnessed
a more impressive and significant
scene. The large hall of the Senate
was densely crowded with Liberal
Senators and Deputies, who listened
with breathless attention to the short
speech, of Senor Sagasta, only inter
rupting him with unanimous and
loud applause when he indignantly
alluded to the "unjustified and in
famous aspersions cast upon Spain"
with regard to the Maine disaster.
Even more enthusiastic applause
greeted his closing words, when he
sternly and proudly declared that
the Government hopea to receive the
support of all Spaniards "in defense
of their territory and ancient rights
which any of their ancestors would
have repelled with the same energy
and courage."
If the idea still existed in the
mind of any one here that war could
be avoided, Senor Sagasta's speech is
regarded as finally S3ttling all
doubts.
There Is not a single individual
here who cherishes even a vague hope
that war may still be averted.
"The die is cast," said a Minister
whose efforts to maintain peace have
been untiring, as soon as the tele
gram announcing that the confer
ence committees had come to an
agreement was received. "There is
no possible escape, nor are we seek
ing any. it has been suggested that
Spain could dispose of the difficulty
Iby withdrawing her forces, but sure*
| ly those who make such a suggestion;
must be aware that no nation could
I act upon it, at least no such nation aÂ»
1 Spain. It would be idle to deny that
we feel bitterly about the entire mat
i ter."
LONDON, April 20.â The Madrid
correspondent of the Standard, tele
graphing on Tuesday, says: I un
derstand the speech from the throne
will review the whole course of the
relations between Spain and the
United States, with the view of show
ing how Spain, in her relations with
America and her treatment of the
West Indian colonies, has spared no
; effort to make concessions and re
! forms compatible with her rights to
conciliate her colonists and to pre
serve friendly relations with Amer
ica, whereas the United States has
all along persisted in seeking pre
texts to interfere in the purely do
mestic relations of Spain with her
colonies and has persisted more than
; ever since the advent to office of
President McKinley, by menaces and
diplomatic notes, in trying to inter
vene in the settlement of the Cuban
question.
So much so has this been the case,
the speech will declare, that the
i United States has constantly put ob
i stacles in the way of Spain whenever
negotiations or the military QiTorts
of Spain have been on the point of
pacifying Cuba.
The speech from the throne will
point out that the Spanish Govern
ment has steadily resisted the Amer
ican pretensions, while making all
possible concessions to America on
the other questions, and would have
gone even further If America had
only undertaken to respect the right
and sovereignty of Spain in Cuba.
The document will lay stress upon
the fact that America has displayed
increased virulence and hostility
since Spain granted a suspension of
hostilities at the request of the Pope
and powers.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Mail, telegraphing at 6:45 p.
m., Tuesday, says: A Cabinet coun
cil was held very early this after
noon, in order to consider the situa
tion. The Government adopted finally
the resolutions respecting their rela
tions with the United States. The
Ministers were unanimous in declar
ing that a conflict was certain and
quite at hand.

BLOCKADE
OF CUBA AND
PORTO RICO
That Is the Plan of Cam
paign Finally Determ
ined Upon.
And if Spain Does Not Finally Back
Down the Naval Forces Will
Move on Saturday Next.
NEW YORK, April 19.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Non-compliance by Spain with the
terms of President McKlnley's ultima
tum will be followed by the dispatch of
the North Atlantic and flying squad
rons, at eighteen minutes past 1 o'clock
on Saturday morning, to Cuba and
Porto Rico to oust her from those isl
ands.
This decision was reached at two
Cabinet sessions held to-day. Briefly,
the plan determined upon Is to insti
tute an Immediate blockade of Cuba
and Porto Rico and to take possession
of ports near Havana and San Juan,
which will be held by marines and blue
Jackets until they are relieved by arm
ies transported from the United States.
It will be the duty of these armies
to assist the naval squadron In the re
duction of Havana and San Juan. With
the entrance of armies into Cuba and
Porto Rico supplies will be shipped into
the Islands and will be distributed by
commissary officers to such Cubans as
may be In need.
Secretary Long has notified Captain
Sampson, commander-ln-chlef of tho
North Atlantic Squadron, and Com
modore W. S. Schley, commander-in
chief of the flying squadron, of the
decision which has been reached by the
Government, and these officers will
have the vessels of their fleets In read
iness to move the moment the word Is
given that Spain has declined to meet
the demands of President McKinley.
Under the plans determined upon Cap
tain Sampson's vessels will not only
blockade Havana, but will blockade
every other port in Cuba, both on the
northern and the southern coast, and
the Hying squadron under command
of Commodore Schley will take similar
action with reference to the ports of
Porto Rico.
In order to fully acquaint themselves
â with the latest plan drawn up by the
army and navy experts the President
and his Cabine" listened this afternoon
to an explanation made by Captain A.
8. Barker, naval member, and Lieuten
ant Colonel A. L. Wagner, army mem
ber. These two officers carefully wÂ»nt
over the situation with the President
and his advisers and the plan which
they have drawn up is understood to
meet with the approval of the officials.
The plan which these officers have
specially prepared contemplates united
operation of the naval and military
forces, and will be executed Just as soon
as the navy reduces a port and occu
pies it with marines. Then troops will
be transported from the United States
to Cuba at the point of investment.
Immediately after the institution of
the blockad â¢ the President will find it
necessary to inform the neutral powers
of the action of the naval squadron of
this Government. The policy of the
United States with respect to blockades
wag announced by Secretary Seward in
1868, when, in his instructions to the
United States Minister to Colombia, he
stated that "Only such blockade as
Khali be duly proclaimed and main
tained by an adequate force in con
formity with the law of nations will
be observed and respected by the
United States." ihis will be the policy
of the administration with reference to
the blockade of Cuba and Porto Rico.
The neutral nations of the world will
be informed.
First â That the blockade will be
strictly enforced upon these principles
recognized by the law of nations.
Second â That armed vessels of neu
tral states will have the right to enter
And depart fr m the interdicted ports.
Third â That merchant vessels In port
at the time when the blockade takes
place will be allowed equitable time for
their departure.
The right to blockade an enemy's
ports with a competent force is a right
Becured to every belligerent by the law
of the nations. But to Justify the ex
ercise of this right and to legalize the
capture of a neutral vessel for violat
ing it a state of actual war must exist,
and notice must be given to neutrals
by the United States of its Intentions
to blockade Cuban and Porto Rican
ports. Having knowledge of a block
.ade the officials declare that interna
" tional law holds that no neutral can
lawfully enter or attempt to enter the
blockaded ports; and to do so would be
a violation of neutral character
which, according to established usages,
would subject the property engaged
therein to the penalty of confiscation.
It Is proposed by the administration to
make the blockade effective in order
that its exercise may not be questioned.
It is for this reason that so many yes

the ultimatum of this Government is
read Commodore Schley may receive or

tification that the President has affixed
his signature to the Cuban resolu
tions, at which time the Minister will
take his leave. He had expected this
would come to-day and every arrange
ment had been made with that in view.
Now that the signing is deferred until
to-morrow, it is probable that the
Minister and his staff will depart be
fore another twenty-four hours pass
by. Before leaving he will transfer
the legation archives and effects to the
French embassy.
"Whether the State Department will
send Senor Polo his passports or he
will ask for them Is felt to be an im
material detail. He intends to go with
out reference to these formalities, and
there is every reason to believe that
the State Department will afford him
the protection of passports and any
other attentions usual in the enforced
departure of a Minister on the breaking
out of a war. The entire staff of the
legation will accompany the Minister.
Their exact movements after leaving
Washington are not known, except
that they will return to Spain at the,
earliest possible moment. It would not'
be surprising if the Minister and his
staff went by way of Canada, Instead
of New York, taking one of the At
lantic liners from Halifax.
The Spanish legation has been the
center of great activity throughout the
day. The Minister was up practically
all of last night, retiring shortly after
daylight this morning, after having in
formed his Government of the final
passage of the Cuban resolution. He
was again at his desk by 9 a. m., com
municating with his Government and
awaiting the next and final move in
making the resolutions effective. Al
though of sturdy physique, the Minister
showed signs of the great strain and
the responsibility put upon him during
the last few days. He saw a number
of friends, mainly of the diplomatic
corps, and to them expressed the view
that all hope of a peaceful settlement
appeared to be at an end, and that
Spain now left with the United States
the responsibility for war. Being con
vinced that all hope of peace was over,
the Minister's personal desires were
that the remaining formalities might
be dispatched as speedily as possible.
He was rather surprised late in the day
when told that the President's signing
of the resolutions would be deferred un
til to-morrow.
Early this morning the large metal
sign bearing the words "Office of the
Spanish Legation" was wrenched
from its place on the gate
and carried off by vandals. The
Minister made no complaint to the
State Department or to the police, as he
has sought to minimize the petty dep
redations against the legation, although
this was the most flagrant one com
mitted.
The various foreign embassies and
legations were intensely active to-day
in the expectation that hostilities were
near at hand. The several foreign of
fices were fully advised of the passage
of the resolutions and were kept posted
as to the prospects of the President's
signature.
Some of the Embassadors and Min
isters called at the State Department
to learn whether the President would
sign the resolutions. They were in
formed by Judge Day that the Presi
dent Intended to sign them. This, in
turn, was communicated to the foreign
offices and was regarded as placing
the matter beyond any question of
doubt. The representatives of the pow
ers of Europe held no meeting during
the day, nor is any meeting at present
In prospect. Those who have been most
hopeful of the bringing about of Euro
pean coalition now concede that such a
move is Impossible. There seems to be
a general purpose among foreign Gov
ernments to observe a strict neutrality.
Already, it is said. Great Britain has
taken steps, not only to maintain a
passive neutrality, but to enforce it
with arms if necessary. Two regimen! a
of L'ritish soldiers are now in the Brit
ish West Indies, and these are about to
be augmented by another regiment en
route from Halifax. They are concen
trated in the belief tJTat the West In
dies will be a center of conflict and that
the stress of war may lead one or tne
other belligerents to occupy neutra!
British territory.
If that occurs a British force will see
that the territory is vacated and that
British soil is not used as a base of ope
rations for hostilities for either party to
the c tnflict. So far as is known, the
French Government will observe the
same neutrality. Its West Indian pos
sessions are considerable and it has
several ships in those waters. Germany
and the other powers are expected to
take the same attitude.
In connection with the cable report
that the Dreibund has sought to effect
a plebiscite in Cuba, it was stated at
one of the embassies that this branch of
the negotiations occurred lost week and
embraced some circumstances not made
known in the cable dispatches. About
the middle of last week one of the em
bassies here was informed from its
Foreign Office that its embassador at
Madrid advised them that Minister
Woodford had suggested in a tentative
way a plebiscite as a possible solution
to the Cuban problem. This embassa
dor also advised his Foreign Office that
the suggestion did not meet with favo~
and had not been followed up. Since
then there has been no talk of a ple
biscite, so far as is known here.

Vatican was approached by a
representative of a European
power in repurd to a proposition
which mig' > ye t avert a conflict
between Spain and the United
States. Spain is to offer Cuba to
the Pope, just as Austria ceded
Venice to Napoleon 111, and the
Pope would be able to declare the
independence of Cuba,
"Thus the amour propre of the
Spaniards woi. be safeguarded
and a disastrous war, which
might compromise Spain's pos
session of her other colonies,
would be avoided.
"The Pope gave a favorable re
ception to the p-oposition, but

initiative. However the idea has
been submitted and the Pope has
not rejected it"

Rear Admiral Likely to
Become Roosevelt's
Successor.
The Assistant Secretary of the
Navy Still Insists Upon
Resigning.
Believes His Duty to the Department
Ends When Preparations Ars
Complete.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 19.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald Bays: Rear
Admiral John G. Walker, retired, may
be the successor of Theodore Roosevelt
as Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
Notwithstanding the pressure exerted
upon Mr. Roosevelt by the President
and his friends I understand he has not
wavered In his determination to resign
his office upon the outbreak of war and
seek active service in the army. Know
ing that it is Mr. Roosevelt's purpose
to tender his resignation there has been
some talk in official circles as to the
man to be selected as his successor.
As far as Mr. Roosevelt is concerned
he feels the work of a civilian In the
office he holds ends with the comple
tion of preparations and the duty of
the incumbent will then be more In the
nature of an advisory character, which
can best be performed by naval officers.
While It is true that Rear Admiral
Montgomery Sicard is on duty as
naval adviser to the Secretary there is
much for the Assistant Secretary to do
ajid it is believed that a naval officer
should be the one to do It. It is also
pointed out to-day that it would be
most injurious to the naval service to
appoint as successor to Mr. Roosevelt
an inexperienced civilian and that, fur
thermore, President Lincoln, during the
rebellion, appreciated the necessity of
having a naval man as Assistant Sec
retary, as was shown by his action In
appointing Gustavus A. Fox, formerly
of the navy, to this office.
ANNOYED BY
SILLY RUMORS
Administration Has No
Intention of Seizing
Hawaii.
6peclal Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, April 19.
The Call correspondent to-day re
ceived from a Cabinet officer an ac-
knowledgment that the administration
had no intention and never had enter
tained a thought of raising the Ameri
can flag over the Hawaiian Islands In
case of war with Spain.
"Why should we do such a thing?"
asked he. "The islands might be of
some strategic vaiue, perhaps, as a
coaling station, but we are not highway
robbere.
"The absurdity of the story tele
graphed from Washington some time
ago to the effect that the islands would
be seized is at once apparent to any in
telligent person who read the Presi
dent's message, and if you will care
fully read the resolutions adopted by
Congress yesterday and which will re
ceive the President's approval, you will
observe t'.iat an amendment was added
to the original resolution reported by
the Foreign Relations Committee, com
monly known as the Davis resolutions,
wherein any intention of exercising
sovereignty over Cuba is expressly dis
claimed. You ask 'What has this to do
with Hawaii V and I answer the United
States of America is anxious to appear
well in the eyes of the civilized world.
We want to dispel any notion that may
be abroad that a selfish and ulterior
purpose is the reason for our inter
vention in Cuban affairs. We are
anxious to show the world and the
great European powers in particular
that the acquisition of additional terri
tory is not our object.
"How foolish it would be then for us
to seize the Hawaiian Islands. This
would put us in the attitude of a high
way robber and create the Impression
abroad that in our quest for additional
territory, however remote from our
shores, we were willing to despoil the
Hawaiian republic and were anxious to
pick a quarrel v.-ith Spain in order that
the annexation of Cuba might result.
"Please state to The Call readers and
make it as emphatic as you like that
the administration has tried and will
continue to try and merit the friend
ship and sympathy of the nations of the
world, and this can be done only by
convincing them that our quarrel with
Spain is a just one and is not based on
our desire for the acquisition of new
territory. Why, even a fool could see
that our arbitrary seizure of the Ha
waiian Islands would bring down upon
our heads the odium and wrath of all
the nations.
"The story that Hawaii would be
seized originated in a fool's brain."

Major-General Brooke, who will com
mand the forces at Chickamauga, left
to-night, accompanied by his Btaff.
A larger number of men will be left
at Fort Sheridan than at any other
post in the Department of the Lakes,
as the department prison is located
there and at present an unusual num
ber of time prisoners are in confine
ment.
General Wade and his staff, formerly

Dakotas, arrived In Chicago to-day
from St. Paul on his way to Tampa,
where he will take command of the

this evening was marked by a serious
accident. During the firing of a salute
for the departing troops by those left
in charge of the fort Private George
Engman had his right arm nearly
blown off by the premature explosion of
a cannon, and Sergeant John W. An
niss, who was in charge of the firing

enthusiasm was manifested.
COLUMBUS-, April 19.â The Seven
teenth Regiment. United States Army,
composed of 628 officers and enlisted
men, left Columbus for Tampa, Fla,,
at 5:26 p. m. The citizens of Columbus
insisted on giving the regulars a "send
off," and Colonel Poland, by request,
marched the troops from the post to the
Union depot over Jhe principal streets.
No military organization ever received
a greater ovation. The streets for a dis
tance of two miles were so packed with
people that there was scarcely room
for the regime.it to march. The crowd
was estimated at 75,000.
The wildest enthusiasm prevailed, and
American and Cuban flags were dis
played on every hand. The escort of the
regiment consisted of the Columbus
battalion of the Fourteenth Regiment,
Ohio National Guard, members of the
City Council and city officials and about
800 veterans of the late war. Colonel
Poland was moved to tears by the mag
nificent demonstration. As the regi
ment passed the capitol a salute was
flred by Battery H, First Light Artil
lery, Ohio National Guard. One of the
regulars was taken with an epileptic fit
while on the march, and was carried to
the train on a litter.
SHERMAN, Idaho, April 19.â The Six
teenth Infantry has been packing three
days and are waiting for orders to move

stationed at Fort Spokane are visiting
in Spokane City to-day and have gone
into camp there waiting for the regi
ment to move down to that place.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 19.â A tele

part for New Orleans, leaving over the
O. R. & N. Railway. Colonel Theaker
will die In command. The troops arriv
ing to-day were accorded a rousing re
ception at the depot. Spokane's patri
otism was demonstrated by the stars
and stripes being thrown to the breeze
from nearly every business house in the
city. Several companies of volunteers
are In process of organization there,
whose services have already been ten
dered to the Government.

REED AND
HOBART SIGN
RESOLUTIONS
Congress Has Done Its
Part in Securing the
Freedom of Cuba.
It Remains Now for the President
to Send His Ultimatum to
Spain and Finish the Job
With Arms.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 19.
Comparatively little business was
transacted by the Senate to-day, all of
the Senators being fatigued on account
of their long vigil last night over the
Cuban resolutions. Consideration of the
sundry civil appropriation bill was re
sumed and the wide latitude of debate
permitted under the rules of the Son
ate afforded opportunity for some ex
planations to be made concerning the
action of the Senate on the Cuban
question.
Mr. Cockrell of Missouri and Mr. Ba
con of Georgia explained their action
In voting against the conference report
in the early hours of the Senate and
the colloquies that ensued between
them and some of the Republican Sen
ators were spicy and interesting. A
running fire of debate was precipitated,
which was participated In by Mr. Man
tle of Montana, Mr. Cannon of Utah,
Mr. Hale of Maine, Mr. Spooner of
Wisconsin and others, the discussion
lasting about three hours.
At the opening of the session the ex
citing and momentous scenes of the
past week had given way to a dull and
somber routine. Attendance on the
floor and in the galleries was small.
At 12:27 p. m. a message was received
from the House of Representatives an
nouncing the signature of the Speaker
to the Cuban resolutions. Eight min
utes afterward the Vice-President an
nounced his signature to the Cuban res
olutions.
In accordance with his announcement
made yesterday that he proposed to
insist upon the independence of the
Cuban republic, Mr. Allen of Nebraska
offered the following resolution which
was referred to the Committee on For
eign Relations:
That the republic of Cuba, the capitol
of which is located at Cubitas, is hereby
recognized by the United States of Ameri
ca as the lawful Government of the Island
of Cuba, and that the United States
hereby pledges to said republic its
friendly offices in the adjournment of its
financial affairs with the kinpdnm of
Spain or the holders of Spanish bonds or
Indebtedness issued against or made
chargeable to Cuba; that, so far as the
Influence of the United States may prop
erly be exercised, it wMI insist that said
republic shall not be charged with the
bonded or other indebtedness of Spain,
contracted during or prior to hostilities
with the respective Governments of Spain
and Cuba,
Mr. Stewart of Nevada said the res
olution reminded him of the very an
cient and very sapient scheme of lock
ing the door after the horse is stolen.
Mr. Allen declared that he was quite
satisfied that under the present ar
rangement the island of Cuba would
pass into the hands of "financial cor
morants and financial buzzards," un
less the United States should at once
take measures to protect the island and
its people.
The Senate then resumed considera
tion of the sundry civil bill, and at 5:05
adjourned.
CUBANS WILL
AID AMERICA
Island Army at the Dis
posal of the United
States.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
â¢ NEW YORK, April 19.â The follow
ing statement on the Congressional Cu
ban resolutions was given out to-day
at the office of the Cuban Junta:
"The resolutions, as they stand, are
tantamount to the recognition of the
Cuban republic. The declaration is that
the people of Cuba are free and inde
pendent, while the Cuban people ac
knowledge allegiance only to the re
public of Cuba, which they have estab
lished and maintained by the force of
arms. The only object of the insur
rection was the independence of the
Cubans. This is provided for by the
resolutions. The Cubans asked that
before Intervention there be recogni
tion of independence. This was also
provided for by the resolutions. Their
desire to run their own Government
free from coercion is provided for by
the fourth paragraph of the resolu
tion.
"Under these circumstances the de
mand made by the United States, that
Spain at once evacuate the island, and
the threat that, in the event of her re
fusal, the land and naval forces of the
United States will be used to compel
evacuation, certainly merits the deep
est gratitude on the part of the Cu
bans. Should force be necessary on
the part of the United States there will
be the most complete co-operation by
the Cuban Government and its army.
Coast pilots and practiced pilots will
be placed immediately at the service
of the United States, and in every way
will the Cubans aid In expelling the
common enemy. To the patriotism of
the American people and the American
press the Cubans owe a debt of grat
itude, and for the confidence which the
American people have in them they
hope to prove their worthiness.
"The steadfastness with which they
have purused their Ideal for independ
ence and the organization which they
have shown in their fight against
Spain, are sufficient proof that they
will be able to maintain their independ
ence, and that peace will be their only
object for the future."
Naval Be serve Recruits.
SANTA CRUZ, April 19.â The ranks
of the naval reserves are rapidly filling
to the maximum limit. Fifteen recruits
have been sworn In and applications
are on file. Twenty-five Watsonville
young men are desirous of Joining.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 19.
The House presented a most desolata
appearance when it convened at noon
after the weary all-night session.
While the journal T vas being read Mr.
Hager (R.) of lowa, chairman of the
Committee on Enrolled Bills, brought
in the Cuban resolutions which had
been enrolled under his personal direc
tion. The Speaker immediately signed
them, and as soon as the reading of
the journal was completed at 12:16 p. m.
he announced his signature.
There was no demonstration. The
enrolling clerk at his side seized the
resolutions and hurried with them
across to the Senate chamber. Mr.
Grosvenor then, as a question of per
sonal privilege, had read at the clerk's
desk an editorial in a New York pa
per commenting on his statement in the
House on April 7, that this war would
be fought under the banner of the Re
publican administration of this Gov
ernment or it would not be fought at
all. Mr. Grosvenor explained the cir
cumstances under which the statement
was made. He had been delighted with
the record the Democratic party had
made and in the statement he only
meant that as the present administra
tion had three years to run the war
which was on us must be fought dur
ing its life or not at all. He had meant
no reflection and had appealed to both
sides of the House to stand by the
executive who had been assaulted.
"In this connection," concluded Mr.
Grosvenor, "I desire to say I believe
this war will be energetically waged,
both in a military sense and in the
manner necessary to carry it on, and
I believe the response to the call to
arms will be unanimous. There will
be no political divisions. The army
will come from Democrats and Popu"
lists as well as Republicans, and es
pecially do I believe the response to the
call will come from every Southerner
and the whole Union will share the
triumphant echo of loyalty." (Great ap
plause).
Mr. Dingley said in view of the fact
that the House had been sitting all
night and that the members were
weary he would move to adjourn. Ac
cordingly at 12:32 p. m. the House ad
journed.

SATSUMA WAS
THERE AGAIN
Downed a Choice Bunch
in the Mile Run at
Ingleside.
Cabrillo a Close Up Third at
the Long Odds of
100 to 1.
Lady Ashley in Front at 4O to IâFa
vorites Took Three Events
on the Card.
Satsuma, the Burns handicap winner,
came out at Ingleside yesterday for the
first time since his big victory and rolled
up another small bundle of coin for Dr.
Rowell. The chestnut horse won a most
peculiarly run race. It was the mile event
for four-year-olds and upward, and Sat
suma opened an 8 to 6 favorite. There
was no demand for him at all, the slick
ones getting aboard Corrlgan's Joe 111
man, sending him to the post a 3 to 2 fa
vorite, while the odds against Dr. Row
ell's horse lengthened out to 3 to 1. Cash
Sloan managed to get away from the
post poorly with Ullman and was never
in It. Newsgatherer was allowed to make
a snail's pace to the stretch, where
Shields leisurely took the lead with Sat
suma and won easily from Frank's horse
In the slow time of 1:42)4. "Pop" Weaver
on Cabrillo rode his horse to excellent
advantage, finishing a bang up third at
odds of 100 to 1. In the final race of the
day Rosormonde defeated a bunch of
selling platers at a mile, which was cov
ered in 1:42 flat.
Suiting the intermittent fashion at
Ingleside, the track yesterday was slow.
Favorites were successful in three in
stances.
H. L. Frank's colt Owyhee was made a
warm favorite for the two-year-old
scramble, and In a hard drive Piggott
managed to land him first a nose in front
of Gold Fin.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry, Odds
j on, a 7 to 10 favorite, was beaten a short
I head for the seven furlong run following
by Daisy F, the Corrigan entry. The lat
ter filly coming from the rar rear on en
tering the stretch, got up in time to win
In a hard drive.Charles Le Bel secured the
show.
Eighteen cheap selling platers lined up
in a five-furlong spin, third on the card.
The winner turned up in Lady Ashley,
a 40 to 1 shot ridden by Glover, which won
easily at the end from Amosa.
"Daggie" Smith annexed another purse
with his recent purchase, Paul Pry. The
chestnut horse was an S to 5 favorite for
the mile and a sixteenth seeling run, and
lin front most of the way, won with
pounds to spare from Metalre, an out
sider. Old Red Glenn finished third.
The final mile run went to Rosormonde,
the even money favorite. The aristocrat
ically bred mare kicked dust at her com
pany the entire route, crossing the wire
a length In advance of La Goleta, the
Baldwin entry.

tries, and the meeting, which opens on

his crop of two-year-olds performing this year.
Canace has speed to burn and In yesterday's
scramble Abano at odds of 60 to 1, landed in
the show, after leading his field into the
stretch.
"Matt" Byrnes scored a moderate success
as starter the opening day of the Bennlngs
meeting. The first field at the post bothered
the ex-tralner considerably.
The chestnut horse, Paul Pry, proved a very
cheap investment for "Daggle" Smith. He has

IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL.
Brunton, Stanford's Sprinter, Beats
the Charge of Having Been
Paid.
Stanford athletics have been considera
bly torn up over charges of professional
ism brought against John Brunton, the
seriousness of wnich endangered the
chances of the crack sprinter being al
lowed to participate in the field day meet
next Saturday. The exclusion of Brunton
from entering the events would have ma
terially lessened Stanford's chances of
coming off victor at the meet, so when a
faculty investigation which lasted a week
exonerated Brunton from all the charges
there was universal rejoicing, but the ex
ultation was expressed in whispers, lest
Berkeley get wind of the affair and at
tempt to bar the sprinter from compet
ing in the events.
Brunton was called home by the illness
of his father the first of the month, and
when upon his return he presented him
self at the registrar's office to enroll as a
student he was informed that he would
have to answer charges preferred against
him before he could rep-ister. He ap
peared before a raculty committee and
found that the snecific charge was that
he had been paiu money to return to
school in order that he might be a con
testant at the Berkeley-Stanford meet.
Several rather stormy meetings of the
committee were held, and Brunton proved
that the accusation was unfounded.
While the name of the party who
brought the charges is not definitely
known, one of the professors prominently
Identified with athletics Is strongly sus
pected, and the feeling against him
among the students is very bitter. Brun
ton Is the captain of the track athletic
team and one of the star athletes of the
university. His election as captain and
his ability in athletics have caused con
siderable jealousy, and snlte work Is be
lieved to be at ...e bottom of the attempt
to cut short his career at the institution.

cerely desirous to avoid war. Tt is
quite conceivable that in the long run
both will have reason to regret the de
cision at which both have arrived. We
regret the outcome on behalf of both
peoples."
The editorial concludes by noting
that "America's change of attitude
toward England and her appreciation
of British sympathy are exemplified in
Senator Lodge's proposal to pay the
Bering Sea award."
The Daily News says editorially: "In
full sympathy with America, we can
not help thinking that the resolutions
of the House were wiser than those of
the Senate. The jingoes have won the
day, but it is for no empty punctilio
that the United States is contending."
The Standard says: "We are per
suaded that it will be the general ver
dict of all impartial judges that in per
emptorily calling upon Spain to de
clare its purpose at once the American
Government is departing wrongly and
unwisely from principles hitherto re
spected in relations between civilized
nations. Unhappily this is not for the
first time.
"A certain deliherat contempt for
amenities of intercourse is apparent at
Washington. Brusquer les chocs might
be supposed to be the fundamental
maxim of the State Depa.rtrr.ont. Spain
should be allowed decent time to reply.
America ought not to forget the share
her own people have had in stlmulat
! ing and maintaining the rebellion in
i Cuba."
The Daily Chronicle says: "Our neu
trality should be of the most benevo
1 lent description toward America. We
ought to proclaim and regard it as a
barbarous and unfriendly act, liable to
instant reprisals, if either Spanish or
American goi.ds ;ire seized on a British
ship or a British cargo is seized on
board American or Spanish vessels.
Great Britain ou?ht also to declare her
intention to prevent privateering on the
part of any state."
The Morning Post says: "The differ
ences between tho two Governments re
duces itself to fighting over the sov
ereignty in Cuba. This is rather a fine
point to be made the occasion for war.
Peace is now to be interrupted for the
first time between the great civilized
nations of Christendom since IS7L It 's
to be hoped that it will not be a pre
lude to a new period of wars such as
The Morning Post believes that both
the United States and Spain will issue
letters of marque, and it agrees with
Lord Charles Beresford, rear admiral,
that England's most simple and nicrst
honorable plan would be "formally to [
denounce the declaration of Paris,
which we ought never to have signed." â 
TO EJECT SETTLERS
FROM TIDE LANDS.
SACRAMENTO, April 19.â Some time
since a communication was received by
Governor Budd from the District Attor
ney of Los Angeles County, setting forth
that certain partiesâ Rudolph Axman, T.
Leggett, J. C. Clemmens and othersâ had
squatted upon certain unwanted tide
lands of the State at San Pedro. 7n this
communication the Governor was request
ed to direct the Sheriff to cans.' the re
moval of the parties. After referring the
matter to the Attorney-General and that
official giving as his opinion that the re
quest of the District Attorney shall be
complied with, the Governor to-day is
sued a proclamation addressed to Sheriff
Burr of Los Angeles County directing him
to eject the intruders, and if resistance
was offered to call to his aid the whole
power of the county.
So it would appear that even before a
gun is fired in the coming conflict with
Spain there may be a mild outbreak of
warfare within the borders of our own
State.
POWERS ON THE EVE OF
TAKING A NEW STEP.
LONDON, April 20.â The Rome cor-
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
Italia, the org-an of the Foreign Office,
publishes to-night the fallowing: "The
powers are on the eve of taking a new
step, namely, requesting the United
States and Spain, In the event of war,
to localize the hostilities to Cuba and
the neighboring waters. This step will
be taken immediately after a declara
tion of war. Utter pessimism prevails
in diplomatic quarters here, the Vati
can alone being hopeful of peace. The
Pope is working energetically to be ac
cepted as arbitrator, but he admits that
Cuba has already morally ceased to
belong to Spain."
McLeod Loses a Match.
ST. PAUL, April 19.â Dan McLeod, the
â well-known wrestler, appeared in this
city to-night in a contest with M J.
Dwyer of St. Paul, and the latter won.

of the match were that McLeod was to
throw Dwyer three times within an hour
He gained the first fall after a hard tus
sel lasting 34VÂ£ minutes, but was unable
to score another fall, so Dwyer was de
clared the winner.

must hang for the murders he conTrtj'tteu
at the mussel beds In San D'ego County

der denying a motion for a nev/ triul.

STATE MEDICAL
SOCIETY MEETS
Large Attendance at the
Annual Session at
Fresno.
Politics and Scientific Theses
Take Up the Time of
Delegates.
Lively Campaign in Progress for
thÂ« Presidency of thÂ«
Body.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
FRESNO, April 19.â The twenty
eighth annual session of the California
State Medical Society was called to or
der at 11:15 by the president. Dr. Ceph
as L. Bard of Ventura. The meeting
is usually well attended, largely owing
to the fact that there is quite a fight
for the office of president in progress.
The morning was largely devoted to
politics, and, indeed, though the sci
entific papers are numerous and valu
able and call forth much interest, the
all-important question is "politics."
During the morning session Dr.
George F. Hanson of San Francisco
read a paper descriptive of some of the
California flora that were valuable or
could become aluable medicinally. It
was suggested by the chair that this
investigation might become valuable if
in the event of war or for any other
reason we should be cut off from the
outside world in procuring our drug
supply.
The afternoon session came to order
at the stroke of the gavel at 1:30, and
until 5 the discussion of papers upon
various medical questions was the or
der of the day. The first paper after
luncheon was upon the subject, "Sero-
Therapy," and was presented by
Dr. George L. Cole of Los Angeles. He
stated that he had address' d a circu
lar letter to 2f>o physicians in the State
asking their opinion of the serum treat
ment, particularly in diphtheria. Most
of the answers received indorsed the
treatment. The doctor also spoke of a
serum for the treatment of pneumo
nia, but gave no particulars.
Dr. Harry M. Sherman of San Fran
cisco reported the results of a new
method of treating congenital disloca
tion of the hip joint by operation. The
results were extrerrely gratifying in
most of the cases treated.
A curious condition of supernumerary
fingers and toes, descending through
three generations, was reported by Dr.
J. G. Dawson of St. Helena. There
were numerous children, but all the
children in each generation exhibited
the anomaly.
The evening session opened with a
discussion of tuberculosis, with the en
deavor of ascertaining a method of
preventing the spread of tuberculosis
by contagion. "Loryngeal Stenosis"
was the title of a paper by Dr. H. Bert
Ellis of Los Angeles, and was followed
by a paper by Dr. Kasper Pische on
"Stocker's Operation for the Cure of
Chronic Otorrhoea," which was dis
cussed by Drs. Philip King Brown and
J. Dennis Arnold.
Officers for the ensuing year will be
elected on Wednesday.

WILL KNOCK OUT
SPANISH PRIVATEERS.
NEW YORK, April 19.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Spain's
privateering plans will be knocked Into
a cocked hat if the efforts of the admin
istration are of avail. These efforts
will be directed toward securing from
the maritime powers of the world whose
ships carry American goods an an-
nouncement that their flags protect the
cargoes of the vessel over which they
fly.
Such an announcement would be in
line with the declaration of Paris of
1866, to which they are parties, that
"the neutral flag covers the enemies*
goods with the exception of contraband
of war," and that '"neutral goods with
exception of contraband of war are not
liable to capture under the enemies'
flags."
Simultaneously with this announce
ment it is expected by the officials that
the maritime powers will bring pres
sure to bear upon Spain which will
cause her to observe their declaration.
The determination of the. administra
tion to approach the powers on the
question has a precedent which was
established by Secretary Seward Im
mediately after the outbreak of the re
bellion in 1861. At that time Mr. Seward
telegraphed an identical instruction to
the Ministers of Russia, Austria, Bel
gium, Italy and Denmark, informing
them that the President of the United
States was disposed to enter into ne
gotiations for the accession of this
Government to the declaration of Paris.
On account of the existence of war be
tween the North and South, the powers
of Europe failed to enter into the nego
tiations suggested by this Government.

ThJE SPIRIT OF PATRIOTISM.
AT least the prospect of war has demonstrated
that there is in this country- a spirit of ardent
patriotism. When the soldiers marched away
yesterday they moved between throngs of cheering
men, women and children. Flags were waved, flowers
strewn with lavish hand, tears came to the eyes, a
lump to the throat. These brave boys in blue repre
sent the honor of the land. They stand for national
dignity, for the pride of a great people. They are
going to face peril to show that the stars and stripes
shall be respected wherever unfurled, that American
citizenship is not an empty title, that American sailors
cannot be murdered and have none to avenge the
crime.
Since war seems inevitable, it is well to look upon
the brighter side of possibility. War may be brief and
almost bloodless. A great principle may be vindi
cated without the thundering of a single cannon. And
Whatever shall happen, be it a quick surrender of
Spain or a contest that sends hundreds of lives down
into the sea, the outcome must do much to unify the
cosmopolitan elements which go to make up the na
tion. To many now in active lite the Civil War is
not even a memory'- But it is given to all to know
that that conflict left scars so deep that only lately
has brotherhood been completely restored. Now one
who fought on the side of the South is in close touch
with the President, who was a good soldier, fighting
on the side of the North. Perhaps it needed a foreign
war to demonstrate that under the flag of this Union
there is one people, a common interest, a patriotism
which is shared alike by North, South, East and
West.
AN UNJUST DISCRIMINATION.
BY a compilation of statistics just issued by the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
there is shown ample evidence of the practice
by the railway companies of a most unjust discrimina
tion against the industries of California in favor of
Eastern interests. It is in the main a new statement
of an old issue, but has been made so strong and clear
that it ought to arouse not only attention but a suffi
cient energy to force some sort of redress for the
wrong.
It appears from the statistics given that freight rates
on goods shipped from California to the East are
much higher than rates on the same class of goods
shipped from the East to the West. This amounts to
a heavy handicap on the Californian. The Eastern
producer and manufacturer has him at great disad
vantage all along the line, and by reason of these
railway discriminations can undersell him in Western
markets where the merchants, manufacturers and pro
ducers of California ought to have an assured su
periority.
The extent of the discriminations varies with dif
ferent articles and runs anywhere from 10 to ioo per
cent in favor of the East. It applies to very nearly
everything produced in the State. Even on strictly
agricultural products like wheat, fruit and beans, the
eastbound freights are higher than those westbound.
The injury, therefore, affects the farmer as well as
the artisan and merchant. The burden is laid upon all
Californian industries with something like impartiality
and none are allowed to escape.
The traffic committee of the association very justly
6ays: "Our State stands well in the front rank of the
great producing States of the Union, not only as to
products of the soil, but as to manufactures, and it is
eminently unfair and unjust that we should not re
ceive the same consideration at the hands of the
transcontinental lines as is accorded the manufactur
ers and producers of the Eastern States."
The traffic committee proposes to seek a remedy for
the evil by a petition to the Transcontinental Freight
Bureau at its next meeting, which is to occur at MiN
waukee on May 10. To that end it asks the co-opera
tion of all manufacturers and producers on the coast.
This, of course, should be cordially given, for the
matter is of concern to all.
It is to be regretted, however, that our shippers
have to seek redress for such a wrong as this by pe
tition to the very men who have committed it and are
profiting by it. The subject should be within the
scope of the powers of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission. The righting of such a gross discrimination
as this should be by law as a matter of justice, and not
by favor as a concession to a humble petitioner.
If it is true that the Pocahontas Coal Company sold
coal to be utilized by the Spanish and kept American
ships waiting, then it was as nearly guilty of treason
as a soulless corporation could be under the circum
stances.
THE HOUR OF DECISION.
O FTER a week of constant and increasing ex
f\ citement, the Congress, in whose hands the
* war power is constitutionally located, has
reached a decision. That decision stands as the con-
I elusion of the people. In anti-administration circles
I it is hailed as a defeat of the President, but whatever
j reflections upon this fact are to be indulged are
I timely only now. and will be out of focus hereafter.
! The country has not failed to note the play of personal
i and party motives. General Lee stood with the Presi
1 dent. His popularity made him a formidable candi
! date for the seat in the Senate now held by Judge
Daniel. Therefore Daniel appeared as the Senatorial
! leader against the President and Lee. Mr. Bryan for
I the same reason of political ambition and the desire
| to scratch a rival in the Presidential race appeared
| at the head of his forces for the same purpose. They
have been partially successful, though defeated in
their desire to recognize the Junta. If the far event
prove that they have advanced their ambitions by
! weakening the hand of the United States and
; strengthening that of Spain, their responsibility will
; not be forgotten.
The President will direct the armies that are mov
ing forward to action and the fleets that will give
battle on the water. General Lee will lead a force to
the front. Bryan and Daniel will stay at home and
lead the army of criticism and detraction. The world
will judge between these four.
Senator Gray said wisely that the country needs
an armistice between political parties while it con
tends with a foreign enemy. In that spirit the sup
porters of the administration will hold up its hands
and give it backing.
Let it be remembered that in the fortunes of war
the final victor has often tasted the bitterness of de
feat in the primary steps. It may be sp now, and, if
so, the yellow jackets will swarm and sting the Presi
dent and his supporters. Therefore in the beginning
let it be understood that the President guides the
struggle as the military and civil chief of a nation.
The constitutional formalities having been fulfilled,
the sword is put in his hand, and where it flashes the
chief leads. His burden has been made heavier by
the ground chosen for him, but he will bear it and
not flinch. He comes of a race that fought barefooted
at Killicrankie, and swung its victorious claymore in
the shadow of the Trosachs.
Of course there is a chance that war may not follow,
but that chance rests only on Spain backing down.
War can hardly aggravate her existing miseries, how
ever, and as personal desperation leads to suicide, she
may in desperation accept war as the means of a
violent extinction of her national personality. If she
do this, while the war may be short, it may be des
perate. Prudence requires that our peopte at once
prepare for what accompanies war. Our advance upon
Cuba is at the beginning of the sickly season in the
tropics. Our Government has been hurried in pro
viding arms and munitions. The vital statistics of our
Civil War show that many more men died of sickness
in the hospitals than were killed in battle or suc
cumbed to wounds. The resources of our people will
be called upon for ministry unto the sick. The hos
pital corps must be recruited. Nurses, doctors and
medicines must be supplied. The Sanitary Commis
sion, to co-operate with the public autho-ities, should
be organized. Our people will find many avenues to
most useful and necessary activity. Reminders of the
war will be constantly with us, and familiarity with the
duties they impose upon us cannot be too soon ac
quired.
ANTI BRYfIN DEMOCRATS.
' â ' VER since Bryan rose out of the confusion at
Chicago into eminence as the Democratic can
â¢âA didate for President he has had strong, active
and determined enemies in the ranks of his party. The
Cleveland wing of Democracy broke away from him
at once and fought him with bitterness throughout
the campaign. Later on David Bennett Hill and a
faction that, like him, had remained neutral during
the Presidential election, returned to the field to work
against the possibility of Bryan's renomination, and
now a new set of foes appear. A combination of the
Democratic machines of New York, Chicago and Cin
cinnati has been formed to overthrow the free silver
champion and his platform, and, according to reports,
has already begun to work to that end.
In some respects the new combination is the most
dangerous antagonist that Bryan will have to face.
The Cleveland Democrats did their worst against him
in 1806, and can hardly have much influence with the
stalwarts in 1900 after their bolt of two years ago.
Hill, while an astute and tireless organizer, has hardly
any great following outside of New York. His plan
of subordinating the money question to a fight against
corporations and trusts is ingenious, but Bryan would
probably meet him more than half-way on that and
outbid at the convention. The combined machine,
however, is a really dangerous foe. It will probably
control the votes of New York, Illinois and Ohio,
and, with that force to work and trade with, can easily
influence so large a number of delegates from other
States as to come very near dominating the conven
tion of the party.
It is announced that a part of the plan of Tammany
is to put General Lee forward as a Presidential candi
date in opposition to Bryan, partly perhaps with the
expectation of nominating him, but mainly for the
purpose of capturing the Southern vote. The move
ment is based upon the assumption that the issue of
1900 will be one growing out of the Spanish crisis
rather than an economic question. With the country
aroused to an ardent patriotism by war, the people,
with a candidate like Lee before them, would cease
to pay any attention to Bryan's appeals to sectional
prejudices and class antagonisms, and his defeat be
fore the National Convention would be certain.
While the subject is one that primarily concerns
Democrats only and in some respects is a strictly fam
ily fight, it is none the less a matter of some import
ance to the country at large. There can be no ques
tion but what the capture of one of the great historic
parties of the country by the demagogues, class agi
tators, socialists and debt repudiators under the lead
of Bryan in iÃq6 was a serious public evil. It in
juriously affected the credit of the nation and dis
turbed business and finance to an extent that entailed
heavy losses in all parts of the Union. The redemp
tion of Democracy from Bryanism is, therefore, a
matter to be greatly desired. One campaign of sec
tional and class politics is enough for this generation.
General Lee thinks that the Spanish can be
driven from Cuba in such a hurry that the soldiers
can be back in the United States before the annual
fever 1 shall set in. As fever is almost due now, the
general evidently believes that all the Spanish will ask
is time to lay down arms and run up a white flag.
While the police are showing symptoms of a de
sire to go to the war. there is an opportunity for four
of them to get away from a charge of cowardice.
Yellow fever is nothing after all when compared with
the ordeal of facing the Commissioners.
THE SAX FBANCISCOCALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 20, 1898.
WOULD AMENDMENT BE EASY?
A MORNING contemporary which is engaged
in mapping out a charter campaign calculated
to fool the people declares that one of the best
features of the proposed instrument consists 'of the
ease with which it may be amended. "If any one is
dissatisfied with any provision of the charter," it
says, "all that he need do is to find IS per cent of the
voters to agree with him and the matter will be
brought before the people of the city for correction."
A section of the legislative article is quoted to show
that amendments may be framed and submitted at any
time, and it is stated that the Supervisors have no
discretion in the matter. They must set the machin
ery in motion when requested by fifteen per cent of
the voters.
This is all very well, but misleading. Like our con
temporary's argument with respect to the principle
of one-man power, it is calculated to pull the wool
over the eyes ofthe people.
The Mayor under the proposed charter will appoint
the Fire and Police Commissions, the Board
of Public Works, the Board of Health, the
Board of Education and the Election Commis
sion. Not only this, but he may remove at
will any commission or member of a board who does
not suit him. The charter places no restriction upon
his power of removal. The only requirement is that
he shall send to the Supervisors a letter giving his
reasons for any action that may be taken. The
power to appoint and remove at will make every ad
ministrative officer of the government the abject
slave of the Mayor.
Through the Fire Commission the Mayor could
control the club politics of the city. Four or five
hundred lusty firemen armed with hose wrenches and
fire axes could be relied upon to carry every primary
election and dominate every political convention.
Through the Police Commission, which is given
power to issue saloon licenses, the Mayor could
handle the "saloon vote" â the League of Freedom,
the Liquor Dealers' Association, the Grocerymen's
Union and their kindred organizations. This vote is
estimated by practical politicians to be of great value.
There are 3300 saloons in this city, each one of which
is good for five votes. This yields 15.000 ballots for
or against any proposition in which the saloons are
interested. Naturally the "saloon vote" would go for
a Mayor who fostered and cared for it. Through the
Board of Education the Mayor could control the
school teachers, through the Board of Health the
patronage of the almshouse and hospitals, through
the Board of Public Works the street contractors,
street railways and paving corporations, and through
the Election Commission he could count the votes
cast at all elections.
How vain to tell people that they may amend a
charter which contains an official invested with these
powers! True, the charter may be amended, but
never without the permission of the Mayor.
The application of the point we make may be un
derstood by a single illustration. Suppose Mayor
Phelan were elected to appoint all these commissions
and should soon after arbitrarily remove everybody
who did not obey Colonel Sullivan, Lawyer Murphy
and his other advisers. The people could then, of
course, petition to amend the section which confers
on him the power of removal. Would Mr. Phelan
permit any such amendment to pass? Would he not
regard the proposition as insulting, revolutionary,
personal, subversive of liberty and a direct blow at
reform politics? Of course he would, and he would
not be a man and a politician if he did not fight.
Could there be any question of the result were he to
swing against the amendment the 25,000 vote,s placed
in his hands by the charter? How silly, then, to talk
about the ease with which the charter may be
amended. It could never be amended without the
consent of the Mayor.
WHEN Congress has provided the legislation
necessary to raise the army and naval force?
of the country to an extent adequate to the
needs of the emergency, the next thing will be to ar
range for defraying the cost of the struggle. This
will be the more difficult task of the two, for while the
people are united on the issue of fighting, they are
seriously divided on every phase of the financial situa
tion.
It is in some respects unfortunate that the long
financial controversy must be settled under the pres
sure of the exigencies of war. It involves questions
of party 'politics and issues of home affairs on which
citizens disagree, with war measures, and that is al
ways to be deplored, for on all problems of foreign
war the people should know no such thing as party
divisions. It is still possible, however, that what
seems to be an evil may turn out to be a positive
good. The patriotism aroused by the war may be the
very thing needed to unite the people on the money
question, as the Civil War united them on the slavery
issue, and so bring about the right solution of its
problems with promptness and efficiency.
In a general way it may be said the United States is
in a good condition to sustain the financial burdens
of even a long conflict. The treasury is well supplied
with money for present needs. The importation of
gold has been notably large for months past, and
Europe still owes us considerable trade balances pay
able in gold, so that we need have no fear of a gold
stringency. The nation itself is rich and prosperous.
Abundant sources of revenue can be found to supply
the cost of the struggle, and there is no feeling of fear
even among the least sanguine of any serious crip
pling of our strength by reason of a lack of wealth
to maintain whatever force in the field the emergency
may call for.
The one issue of importance in the financial situa
tion, therefore, is that of deciding upon the kind of
money we shall use in fighting the war. We have had
one experience with greenbacks, and we are not
likely to try that again. It remains to be seen, how
ever, whether the silver men in the. Senate will co
operate with the administration in putting the war
finances of the nation on the soundest possible basis,
that of an unequivocal gold standard.
On that issue public sentiment should be aroused at
once. No toleration should be shown to men who
for party advantage would weaken the financial
strength of the country at this time. The best money
in the world is none too good to pay the soldiers
who go to the front to fight for the republic, and the
member of Congress who opposes the organization of
our war finances on that basis is not much better than
an open enemy of the nation and its heroes.
Suit has been begun against two straw bondsmen.
As neither has property to make good the bond, and
as the courts know this, the action must be regarded
as a form. Criminal procedure is the course the oc
casion seems to demand.
The trial of "General" Dugan of Christ's Army
was held behind closed doors. It is to be hoped that
the "general" will also be held behind doors simi
larly conditioned for the period of his natural life.
WAR FINANCIERING.
SPAIN'S CRIMES AGAINST AMERICA,
The Maine Affair Only One of a Long List Which Have
Not Been Avenged.
PART I.
The success of the revolution In
Texas In 1836, and the subsequent ad
mission of the acquired territory as a
State into the Union, engendered a
spirit of adventure, especially in the
Southern States, Texas and California,
that broke out in full force at the close
of the war with Mexico. On our coast
William Walker, the "gray-eyed man
of destiny," led filibustering expedi
tions, first into Lower California, and
afterward into Nicaragua, while Henry
A. Crabb invaded Mexico with his
party. Both met a similar fate. Walker
was captured and shot to death at
Trujillo and Crabb at Cavorca.
On the Atlantic side the island of
Cuba became an object of general inter
est, and so early as the commencement
of the term of President Taylor some
adventurous spirits, believing that its
annexation would be of advantage to
the United States, and that its In
habitants only awaited an opportunity
to throw off the Spanish yoke, prepared
to make an armed descent on the isl
and, but the President, in a proclama
tion issued August 11, 1849, cautioned
our citizens against violating the neu
trality laws by engaging in such an en
terprise. The warning was disregarded
and an armed expedition was secretly
organized, under General Narciso
Lopez, a native of Venezuela. At an
early age he had sympathized with the
independence of the South American
States, though he had served in the
army of the King of Spain, from which
he retired in 1822 with the rank of
colonel. He had lived in Cuba, and
when he landed in the United States in
1849, represented that the people of the
island were ripe for revolution, and
that glory and emoluments awaited
those who would go to their assistance.
The first expedition that he organized
sailed in 1850 in the little steamer
Creole and effected a landing at Car
denas on May 19. The place was easiiy
taken, but finding that the Cubans nor
any of the Spanish troops were dis
posed to join them, as had been repre
sented, it was deemed best to re
embark within twenty-four hours after
the landing*. In going out of the har
bor the Creole attempted to pass
through an unfrequented channel and
grounded. She lay there several hours,
and while in that position a Spanish
man-of-war came by and looked in,
but not seeing the Creole in the usual
channel or in the harbor, supposed that
she had gone out in the night, and im
mediately steered for Key West, natur
ally concluding that the Lopez com
pany would make for that port. The
Spanish war steamer reached Key
West first, and not finding the Creole,
left early the next morning. There are
two entrances to the harbor of Key
West â one called the southeast and the
other the southwest, an island lying
between them. The Spanish steamer,
fortunately for the Creole adventurers,
left Key West by the southeast chan
nel, and after rounding the point of the
island discovered the Creole making for
the harbor by the other channel under
a full head of steam. Then commenced
a race which involved the lives of sev
eral hundred men.
The Creole succeeded In reaching the
channel before the Spanish steamer
could brine her guns to bear, but she
followed her into the harbor and the
Creole would probably have been sunk
but for the presence of the United
States revenue cutter Marcy, which
happened to be at Key West. The Cre
ole was stopped by the health officer
and whiln lying to the war steamer
passed her with ports open, guns
shotted and the gunners ready with
the matches. But as she took her
position between the Creole and the
wharf the revenue cutter ran up the
American flag and placed herself so as
to protect the Liopez steamer,- and beat
to quarters. This demonstration un
doubtedly saved the filibusters. After
the health officer left her the Creole
made her way slowly to the wharf,
and in three minutes after she
touched every man that had been in
her was on shore.
On the 3d of August, 1851, Lopez
sailed from New Orleans with a party
of 4SO men in the steamer Pampero, de
spite all the precautions that had been
taken to prevent the departure of the
expedition. The party landed without
opposition on the night of the 11th at
Playtus, twenty leagues from Havana.
The main body of the force marched
to Las Pozas, an inland village, under
the command of Lopez, leaving about
100 men under Colonel William S. Crit
tenden in charge of the stores and un
necessary arms. As on the occasion
of the first expedition the expected up
rising of the Cuban people did not take
place. The day after the landing
Crittenden was attacked by the Span
ish troops â a force too strong for him â
and after a struggle withdrew from the
field, and finding that Lopez did not
come to his rescue, resolved to return
to the United States. They procured
their small boats and had just got to
sea when they were followed and cap
tured on the 15th by a Spanish war
steamer. They were taken to Havana,
summarily tried, and on the 17th Crit
tenden and fifty-two of his men were
shot. The main body was dispersed
on the 24th, and their leader, Lopez,
was executed on September 1. The
prisoners who were not shot were
transported to Spain and afterward
pardoned.
The news of the execution of the
fifty-two Americans created a most
profound sentiment of sympathy and
indignation in the United States, par
ticularly in the South and in Califor
nia. Large meetings were held in the
principal cities, at which inflammatory
speeches were made and hostile reso
lutions passed. In New Orleans the
public feeling against the Spaniards
ran so high that a very serious riot oc
curred, during which the Spanish Con
sul was obliged to seek safety in flight
and the office of the Spanish news
paper.'La Union, was destroyed. Large
contributions of money were made and
volunteers flocked to the seaboard from
the inland States. Some 8000 congre
gated at New Orleans, and about 4000
at New York. The feeling was in
tensified hy the publication of state
ments that the men had been shot
without a trial, and that gross indig
nities had been offered to their bodies.
These statements were afterward de
nied.
On the receipt of the news a call was
published in the San Francisco papers
for a public meeting to be held Septem
ber 24, 1851, at the California Exchange,
and at the appointed time there was
a large gathering. The object of the
meeting, as stated in the call, was for
an expression of sympathy for the Cu
bans, but on assembling there ap
peared to be no general understanding
and no plan for organization or pro
ceeding. General James M. Estell was
called to the chair, and a committee
consisting of General Thomas J. Green,
ex-Governor "Extra Billy" Smith of
Virginia and others was appointed to
draft resolutions expressive of the sense
of the meeting. Several speakers deliv
ered stirring addresses. As one of them
expressed himself, "The struggling Cu
bans have our best wishes, and they
can have our money, and they can
have our blood." Colonel White said:
"I am willing to do my share, either on
the rostrum or In the field. There is
no American â no man that has ever
put his foot on American soilâ but will
cheerfully stand firm when liberty is
the cause. Spain has set her foot on
Cuba, Cuba, the child of Spain, has
borne It and has sent her treasures to
Spain. But it is not the treasure upon
which we are to calculate â it is the
liberty of the Cubans for which we are
to contend. Let the voice go forth
from here; let it not be said that Cali
fornia, which was acquired in a strug
gle for freedom, refuses to send a word
of sympathy to Cuba. I know many of
those who have lately been slaughtered
in Cuba. Why were they shot? Be
cause they had the noble spirit at
Americans to go and plant the banner
of freedom on the island of Cuba,"
At an adjourned meeting held on the
following evening there was an in
creased attendance. Generals Green
and Anderson, David C. Broderick and
others were chosen vice-presidents.
The committee on resolutions made its
report, then opened with this vigorous
preamble:
"Whereas, we have good reason to
believe that the people of the island of
Cuba are now struggling to vindicate
the rights of man, and establish for
themselves a government of their
choice, with a view to secure to them
selves and posterity the inalienable
rights of life and liberty, and the right
to pursue happiness and acquire prop
erty." Therefore, it was resolved
"That as citizens of the United
States, we deeply sympathize with
these struggling patriots, and sincerely
desire that they may successfully and
triumphantly establish a free and hap
py government.
"That we are bound by all the recol
lections of the past, by all the enjoy
ments of the present, and by all the
beaming, glorious hopes for the future,
to send a word of sympathy and en-
couragement to those engaged in a
deadly but holy struggle, and to en
courage the gallant and chivalrous of
our own and of every land to aid and
co-operate by personal exertions those
now engaged in Cuba in the existing
struggle."
The third resolution expressed sor
row and indignation at the barbarous
murder of Colonel William S. Critten- I
den and his gallant compatriots. The
matter was denounced as a cold-blood
ed murder, and perpetrated after a ,
pledge of safety had been made and i
given before the surrender. It was
characterized as "an act of perfidy that !
demanded the execration of every man- '
ly heart, and which cried aloud for !
vengeance â a vengeance that can only I
be assuaged in the blood of the dcs- \
pot minion who perpetrated the heart
less outrage." It was also resolved:
"That we regret to learn the active
efforts being made by our Government
to prevent our citizens from rushing to
the aid and assistance of the gallant
Cubans, and that we cannot admit, but
stoutly deny, the right on the part of
our Government to prevent any Amer
ican, armed or unarmed, from leaving
our shores for any purpose, especially
for the purpose of establishing free and
enlightened government.
"That as soon as the patriots of Cuba
shall establish a provisional govern
ment with sufficient assurance of its
stability, it will be tne duty of the
United States Government to treat
with it as with one of the nations of
the earth."
A committee of five was appointed to
receive voluntary contributions to en
able such as were disposed to render
the Cubans all assistance in their
power. The meeting adjourned with
three cheers for "Cuba, Liberty and
Lopez."
A meeting for a similar purpose was
held at Sacramento on the evening of
the 22d. It was called to order by
Captain Achilles L. Kewen, and or
ganized by electing General A. M. Winn
chairman, and Captain Kewen and Ma
jor Pierson B. Reading vice-presidents.
A committee on resolutions was chosen
consisting of Captain B. D. Fry. Ben
jamin F. Washington. Colonel E. J. C.
Kewen, Dr. John F. Morse, G. Kenyon
Fitch, Captain Joseph R. Beard and
others. At an adjourned meeting on
the 26th vigorous resolutions were re
ported and adopted.
President Fillmore reviewed the inci
dent in his annual messagp to Congress
and stated that the expedition had
been set on foot in palpable violation
of the laws of the nations. He gave
assurance that the Government would
spare no pains to procure the release
of the prisoners who had been sent to
Spain, but declared that it was his
purpose to rigidly enforce the laws
which prevented its citizens from in
terfering with the concerns of foreign
nations. He declared that no individ
uals had a right to hazard the business
of the country or to violate the laws
upon vague notions of altering or re
forming the governments of other
countries, and that every independent
nation must be able to defend its pos
sessions against unauthorized individ
uals banded together to attack them.
The Government of the United States
would rigidly adhere to and enforce its
policy of neutrality, which it was
among the first to proclaim and estab
lish.
The Spanish Government did not re
ceive the message of the President in
the spirit In which it was written. The
bold attacks of the Lopez parties had
alarmed the authorities of that nation
and the constant threats of vengeance
served to keep up the alarm. These
fears and the suspicions founded upon
them Induced the authorities of Spain
to commit various outrages which were
carried to such lengths that a senti
ment was created in the United States
that our Government was justified in
considering them gross national insults.
American steamers and merchant ships
were fired into and searched to satisfy
the auspicious Spaniards that they were
not transporting filibusters and arms
to again attack Cuba. So frequent
and flagrant had these outrages be
come that in 1554 there was a very gen
eral clamor fnr war with Spain. The
New York Herald advised an extra ses
sion of Congress, and declared that
the only hope of President Pierce was
to act with vigor. The National In
telligencer said that the crisis in the
Cuban question had arrived, while the
New York Tribune, whose editor al
ways had felt that the scheme to an
nex Cuba was but to augment the
power of the slave States, declared that
the Southern members of the Cabinet
had determined on a war with Spain.

HOW HAWKINS c
HELPED c
THE TARS. C
the other night when they were sighted
by Coroner Hawkins. Hawkins watched
them for a few moments as they stag
gered in their endeavors to go ahead.
Finally the Coroner, overcome with pity'
began to cudgel his brain in the en
deavor to think how he could help them
out of their dilemma. At last he was
struck by a happy thought, which he at
once started to put into execution. Get
ting well in advance of the seamen and
looking to see that the coast was 'clear,
he turned around, and, taking off his
hat. swung it n round his head, saying,
"Three cheers for the Spanish navy and
perdition to all American sailors."
The effect was electrical. The three
tars stood for a moment as If paralyzed,
and then, with every evidence of intoxi
cation completely gone, started in wild
pursuit of the vanishing figure of the
Coroner, who had not' lingered after the
insult.
Up the street ran Hawkins and up the
street followed the enraged shellbacks,
uttering curses and threats of vengeance
and gaining at every step. Hawkins
made for the Coroner's office, and such
was the rapidity of the pursuit that he
had just time to get Inside and bar the
door when the tars arrived. They camp
ed on the street below, where in a few
minutes they were joined by about a
dozen of their shipmates, to whom they
explained the trouble and by whom they
were immediately joined in the siege. It
required nearly an hour for Hawkins to
explain, as he leaned out a second story
window, that he did not mean anything
by what he had said, and that his re
marks were prompted by charity. Hav
ing witnessed the unsuccessful efforts
of the original three to travel up the
street and noticing that they were under
the influence of liquor he, as a doctor,
saw that they needed a counter irritant,
and had administered one.

FRANK H. GOULD AN ACTIVE AGENT
Much Speculation as to Who Is to
Benefit by the Democratic
Throat=Cutting.
The friends of Congressman Magulre
have j ju t awakened to the fact that
they have been made the victims of a
piece of political strategy that bids fair
to rob their standard-bearer of the
chance of realizing his ambition to se
cure the nomination for Governor on
the Democratic ticket.
Even this is not the worst of the sit
uation. These same friends unwitting
ly permitted themselves to be made
parties to their own undoing, a circum
stance that adds much bitterness to the
pill they will be forced to swallow.
It was at Saturday's meeting of the
Democratic State Central Committee
that the strategic move was executed. So
inoffensive did it appear on the surface
and so quietly and naturally was it un
folded before the unseeing eyes of the
astute politicians against whom its hid
den shaft was directed that not one dis
senting voice was raised against it. It
was presented in the form of the fol
lowing resolution offered by Frank H.
Gould?
Resolved, That the basis of repre
sentation in the next Democratic
State Convention be fixed at one for
each county and one for each 200
votes or major fraction thereof cast
for William J. Bryan at the last
general election.
The resolution was adopted without
a dissenting vote, no apparent signifi
cant. D,.jncr attached to the fact that
Gould is himself a prospective candi
date- f..r the position at tli" head of the
State ticket Sinr^ Saturday, however,
a great light has flooded the minds of
the good Democrats, who have de
] themselves to be for Maguire
first, last and all the time. It has been
borne in upon them that there was a
very definite purpose in the mind of the
framer of the resolution when he fixed
the basis of representation on the vote
for Bryan instead of the vote for Budd.
Even the kindrruartf-n politicians
know that Bryan's vote in the State
outside of Ban Francisco was mu^h
lareer than that received by Budd.
They also know that Budd received
more votes in this city than did the de
feated candidate for President. It is
also well known that Maguire is very
popular in Pan Francisco and that this
popularity does not extend to oth^r
portions of the Ptato, because, among
other things, of the statesman's views
on the single tax question. All of
these things were considered by the
framer of the resolution introduced by
Mr. fjnuld. By means of the new ba
sis of county representation the voting
Ftrength of the convention is increased
by 171 vctes over what it would have

bf>Â«Â»n had the vote cast for Budd been
taken as the basis of representation.
All of these votes are accredited to
counties outside of San Francisco
where Maguire has the least strength.
In this city, where Maguire has the
strongest following, the convention del
egation, under the proposed apportion
ment, will number seven less than it
would if the Budd vote had been taken
as the basis of representation. A few
illustrations will serve to show the
workings of the scheme brought into
existence by those Democrats who
would like to see Maguire out of the
gubernatorial race.
In Alameda County 6758 votes were
enst for Budd and 8394 for Bryan. This
being bo, Alameda County will have 43
votes in the convention, where it would
have had but 35 if the Budd vote had i
been taken as a basis of representation, j
In Los Angeles County Budd received i
7619 votes and Bryan 16.040. The coun- j
ty will now be entitled to eighty-one
seats in the convention where it would ;
have had but thirty-nine. San Diego '
will have twenty-one delegates instead
<>f ten. Sacramento will have twenty
five instead of seventeen. Fresno will
have twenty instead of 13. Santa Clara j
will have twenty-seven instead of
twenty-three. San Francisco cast 32,069
votes for Budd and 30,649 for Bryan. '
The city will therefore be entitled to
134 delegates instead of 161.
While the friends of Congressman ;
Maguire admit that they have permit- j
ted. themselves to be outgeneraled, j
they are entirely in the dark as to the
identity of the lucky politician who is :
slated as the prospective recipient of j
the increased representation in the in
terior counties. They all agree that
Gould is practically out of the running,
and profess to believe that he was se
lected merely as the vehicle for the un
loading of the scheme on the unsuspect- I
ing State Committee. In a recent con- j
venation with the writer Mr. Gould de- '
dared his intention to keep out of the !
fight for the nomination, giving as his
reason the fact that he could not af
ford, in a financial sense, to engage in
a contest where the chances of success
were extremely problematical. He
added, however, that should such a
condition arise where a majority of the
convention demanded that he accept
the nomination at their hands, he
would probably not refuse.
Some of the political guessers profess
to see in the situation an attempt to
promote the candidacy of H. M. La
Rue, the present Railroad Commission
er from Sacramento County. His
gubernatorial aspirations are well
known, and It might be that with Ma
guire out of the way he would be able
to hold his own with Lieutenant-Gov
ernor Jeter, State Senator Seawell,
Mayor Phelan or any of the others who
are at present considered to be on the
list of possibilities. The forecasters are
also considering the possibility of Gov
ernor Budd being a candidate for re
election, in spite of all assertions to the ;
contrary. They point to the fact that
Gould is at present an office-holder un
der the State by reason of t 1 favor of
the Governor, a fact that might b< con
sidered as a reason wh;- Gould would
not lend himself to any scheme that did
not meet with the approval of his pa
tron. On the other hand, it is not for
gotten that the reconciliation between
the Governor and Gould is only a com
paratively recent occurrence. Revenge
is sweet, and after all is said and done,
politicians are but human.
Following will be found a list of
counties showing the number of dele
gates that would have been accredited
tÂ«r each if the Budd vote had been
taken as the basis of apportionment,
and also the number of delegates that
will be accredited to each under the
Bryan apportionment:

War of Words.
Arrival of the Penelope With Gold
Hunters En Route, for Kotzebue
Sound.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Newport arrived from Panama and way
ports yesterday with eleven cabin and
twelve steerage passengers and $118,193 in
treasure. Dr. Jordan, who was acting as
United States quarantine officer, and
Boarding Officer Shepman had a passage
at-arms. As soon as he boarded the
steamer the quarantine officer said to
Shepman: "By whose authority are you
BOUND FOR THE KLONDIKE.
The little schooner-steamer Florence got away for St. Michael yesterday. When she arrives at the mouth of the
Yukon her false keel will be taken off and she will be turned into a stern wheel steamer. The gold hunters aboard her
will dredge all the sandbars from the mouth of the river to Dawson in search of the precious metal.
here?" "The pame authority that sent
you out here," answered the custom-house
officer. "We arc both acting in the in
terests of the United States; at lenst I
know I am." Jordan glared at. Shepman
for a moment and then snapped: "1 shall
make a note of my disapprobation of you
and your six officers being aboard tiiis
vessel before the quarantine officer." "All
right," answered the boarding master,
"and while you are about it just note j our
disapprobation of the fact that the im-
migration commissioner and his deputy
came aboard before you did." It would
appear as though the Federal Quarantine
officer could not live out of hot water. It
is not so long ago that he was at daggers
drawn with tin' State quarantine officer.
Captain McGregor of t lie British tramp
steamer Venus, now in Quarantine, is not
only at outs with the quarantine officer,
but also with the customs Inspectors.
There are six of the latter on board, and
they have to take forecastle fare and eat
with the sailors. Captain McGregor holds
that Dr. Rosenau noted In a high-handed
manner In sending him into quarantine
and refuses to allow his men to go ashore
to he fumigated. In consequence the
quarantine officer refuses to grant the
vessel pratique. During the voyage of the
Venus from Hongkong Chief Engineer
P. Harvey was taken sick with smallpox
and landed at Nagasaki. No fresh cases
having appeared during the voyage l>r.
Hill, the acting State quarantine officer,
passed the vessel, but Dr. Rosenau or
dered her Into quarantine. Captain Mc-
Gregor refuses to be fumigated, the cus
toms officers are making his life misera
ble by searching his rabin every half
hour In the day, the officers are swearing
because their rooms are turned topsy
turvy for the same reason. Dr. Rosenau
insists on the fumigating and the Occi
dental and Oriental Steamship Company
is insisting upon getting Its freight, and
all in all the Venus is more like Bedlam
than a staid British tramp steamer.
The schooner Florence got away for the
Klondike yesterday and passed the
schooner Penelope, bound for Kotzebue
Sound, on her way in here to fit out.
The latter vessel is twelve days out from
San Pedro and will have new masts put
in. She has on board twenty-one gold
hunters, all shareholders In the I -one
Beach Mining and Trading Company,
whoso ultimate destination is the Kubuck
River. Captain Loch of the Penelope
says he can have the new spars put in
and make some other necessary repairs
and still beat the Florence to Alaska.
The Florence is a Queer combination.
She has a false keel, which will be re
moved ai3 soon as the vessel reaches St.
Michael, and she will then be turned
into a stern wheel steamer for use on tho
Yukon. She has a dredging plant on board
and all tho bars from the mouth of the
river to Dawson will be prospected.
There is also an. electric light plant on the
Florence, and any of the small mining
camps at which she may tie up will be
supplied with Incandescent lights.
The British bark Inveramsy was to
have sailed yesterday for Kngland with
a load of wheat, but her anchors were
fouled and it was not until late In the
afternoon that they could bo raised.
AVhen the tug Reliance did finally get them
up It was found that a stray anchor and
lift y fathoms of Chain were attached to
them. The stray mud hook was landed
ami the Inveramsy will go to sea to-day.
The yacht Regina broke away from her
moorings yesterday and went ashore at
Belvedere. She was got off at high water
and was found to be only slightly dam
aged.
The California Navigation Company ap
plied to the Harbor Commissioners yes
terday for the use of the old Sausalito
ferry slip and also the old chief wharfin
ger's orhce when both are vacated. The
slip is to be used by the Ban Joaquin
Valley road when the new 20-knot steam
er Hugh J. Corcoran in completed, and
the wharfinger's oflice will be used as a
freight and ticket office by the same com
pany. The Commissioners granted the
Navigation Company's request.
Chief AVharfipger Root had a tilt with
the executive officer of the sloop-of-war
Marlon yesterday. The five-masted
schooner Louis was docking at Howard
ftreet wharf and there was not enough
room for her unless the Marlon moved
hack a little. This the boys of the naval
battalion refused to do, and the clash fol
lowed. The matter Is now In the hands
of the Harbor Commissioners.
Owing to the d<May In the arrival of the '
steamship Campania in New York the
mails for dispatch by the steamship Ala
meda will not reach San Francisco until |
to-morrow, and in consequence the sail- j
ing of the Alameda has been postponed
until 2 p. m. of that day. ]
MUST PAY A
HEAVY FINE
The Cooks of the Klam
ath Lumber Company
Mulcted.
Judge Morrow Taxes Them
More Than One Thousand
Dollars for Contempt.
An Order of Court Must Be Obeyed
Even if the Order Is Declared
to Be Erroneous.
The Conks, the father and two sons,
who constitute the guiding spirits of the
Klamath River Lumber and Improvement
Company, learned from the lips of United
States Circuit Judge Morrow yesterday
that it is a serious thing to disobey an or
der of court, even by the advice of an at
torney.
That part of the lesson which appeals to
them with most force is the imposition of
j fines and costs aggregating more than
1 $1000. Some months ago the Cooks, John
X.. the father, and \Y. K. and John S.
Cook, his sons, leased to Hervey Lindley
of L'is Angeles and a syndicate represent
ed by him the saw mill, logging railroad
and other property of the Klamath River
Lumber and Improvement Company,
with a three years' option for the pur
chase Of the same. Q("li<- Cooks were in
debt, and for that reason aa well as for
the fact that the lumber market was very
weak, owing 1 to low prices, the advent of
Mr. Lindley and his company, the Poke
gama Sugar Pine Lumber Company, was
halhd as a blessing. But after the Poke
gama people had expended about |7&,O00 in
making various necessary improvements,
ami after the price of lumber rose in the
market, certain parties from the East of
fered to buy the property from the Cooks.
This was the beginning of friction be
tween the Cooks and Mr. Lindley, and af
faira were brought to a climax by the
Cooks, who reto.Â»k forcible possession of
the mill and the railway with a gang of
armed men. After an ineffectual appeal
to the Superior Court of Slskiyou County
til'- Pokegama Company appealed to the
United Si;:t''s Circuit Court in this city.
Judge Morrow issued a restraining order
prohibiting the Cooks from interfering
with the Pokegama people in operating
the works and otherwise enjoying the
property under the lease. The Cooks re
sisted the process of the court, having
been advised to that action by H. B. (Jii
lis, one of the attorneys fur the Klamath
people, who gave the opinion that the re
straining order did not require the Cooks
to give up possession. Thereupon the
Cooks and a score of employes were ar
rested for contempt.
Yesterday morning Judge Morrow deliv
ered an oral decision in the contempt
cast. There were present E. S. Pilsbury,
uttorney for the Pokegama Company, and
Judge 9. C. Denson, Fred Stratton and 11.
B. 61111s for the Klamath Company.
Judge MorTOW began by saying that he
had already announced the opinion enter
tained by him with regard to the restrain
ing order. In his opinion that order was
proper, and the only question before the
court was whether the order has been
violated. The order was a lawful one and
disobedience to it was contempt. If tne
court had ever had any doubt in this case
it would be relieved from that doubt by
the proceedings that had taken place in
a similar case entitled The People of the
State of New York against John Lyman
King. King was a political boss, and when
the injunction was served upon him he
said to the officers, "Injunctions don't go
hero See?" Judge Barnard cited King
for contempt, and it was urged very
Btrongly that the court had no authority
to issue the injunction and that the order
was erroneous. The court in that case
Indicated that the Injunctive order was j
erroneous, but the court very pointedly
and clearly pointed out thiit the court had
the power to issue an injunction, and it
therefore devolved upon the parties to
obey it An appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court, and the Supreme Court sus
tained the decision of the lower court that
even if the order was erroneous it was
not void and should be obeyed.
"I think the violation has been gross,"
â¢ continued Judge Morrow, "and under ordi-
I nary circumstances the punishment
would be severe. I shall, however, take |
into consideration the fact that there were
proceedings la the State court which had
decided that the respondents were not in
contempt in taking possession of the
nronertv I shall also take in considera
tion the fact that when (after March 29)
the respondents were advised by their
counsel to comply with the order, they
showed no disposition to disobey the re
straining order.
"I desire it to be distinctly understood
that the punishment which I am about
to inflict is no criterion of what I would
inflict in other cases, or if there should
bo any further contempt in this matter. I
The punishment will be inflicted not only i
for the purpose of warning those parties,
bttt all other parties having dealings with :
courts not to be guilty of this offense."
The court then fined J. R. Cook, W. E.
Cook John S. Cook, H. B. Gillis, George
W Marsh. George Norris, J. McEnemey
and C Stock $50 each, together with costs,
with the alternative of thirty days' im
prisonment. The remaining employes
â were fined their pro rata of the costs,
the whole amount of costs being $700. W.
Baxter was discharged and Attorney
Topscott was let off on the ground that
he was the junior member of the law firm
which gave the disastrous advice to the
Cooks to take possession of the property
in defiance of the restraining order and
was therefore not responsible.
WAS THERE
COLLUSION ?
City May Have Lost Val
uable Land by Negli
gence or Design.
Twenty Thousand Dollars in
Property Involved in
a Lawsuit.
There May Be a Sensational Investi
gation of the Matter by
the Board.
It may not be many days before the
Board of Supervisors will be in the midst
of a sensational Investigation. The fuse
that may lead to the expected explosion
was lighted yesterday oy the judiciary
committee of the board, when it adopted
the following report to be submitted to
the Supervisors on Monday next:
In the communication of the City and County
Attorney of April 11, 1898, in reference to Mis
sion Creek and Channel street land this officer
reports that prior to the rendition of the Judg
ment in favor of the city and county in the
case of the city and county of San Francisco
vs. John Center et al., ' "the city lost a part
of said lands in the case of James W. Good
win vs. Joseph Sheerer and the city and county
of San Francisco.
"In this case the plaintiff, Goodwin, obtained
a judgment against the defendants which di
vested the city of all title to the land described
in the complaint in that action. This case was
tried in the Superior Court by one of my pre
decessors In office and an appeal therein was
taken to the Supreme Court by me after I be
came City and County Attorney.
"After the most elaborate arguments the
Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of thÂ°
Superior Court on the ground that the city
had shown no title to the land in the trial
before the Superior Court, saying that however
good the title of the city might have heen ?he
had failed to put it in evidence on the trial
in the Superior Court and must take the con
sequences of that failure."
This recital naturally occasions some surprise
and the reasons for the singular action in not
putting the title of the city and county to the
property in evidence in the suit before the
Superior Court demand investigation as to
whether the same anise from negligence or
design or both. There must be some remedy
for actions of this charat-ter which result in
loss of property to the city and rounty.
Your committee, therefore, respectfully 10
port? in favor of re'iuesting the (Mty and Coun
ty Attorney to forward to the board as soon
as practicable a full detailed statement of nil
the procepdlnps had in this litigation, who
rej.rrsented the parties to the suit, before
which department of the superior Court the
case was tried and decided and all other mat
ters which will enable the board to determine
what other or further action can be taken to
assert the city's title to this property and to
set aside this apparently collusive determina
tion ot the litigation.
The land here referred to as having
been lost to the city "from negligence or
dtsign, or both," is bounded by Brannan,
Ninth, New Channel streets and Potrero
avenue, and is valued at about $20,000.
The case was tried before Judge Troutt
and judgment was rendered on December
30, ISH2. On behalf of the city the records
show that the case was conducted by
John 11. Durst, then City Attorney, and
E. B. Williams, Assistant City Attorney.
The attorneys for plaintiff were Horace
W. I'hilbrook, GeorT?.' T. Wricht and the
plaintiff. Whin City Attorney Creswell
took office, a. few days after the judgment
was rendered, he appealed the case to the
Supreme Court, but despite the most
earnest and persistent efforts made by
him he failed to secure a new trial, owing
to the fatal error committed in the first
Instance of not putting in evidence to
prove the title of the city.
There is now only one way by which
the case can be reopened, and that is by
showing fraud in the proceedings hail
before the Superior Covm.
At the time the case was decided there
was considerable talk of collusion, but
nothing of a tangible nature was ever
brought to light. It is possible, that when
the matter comes before the Board of
Supervisors on the report of the Judiciary
Committee, an investigation may be or
dered of the whole affair in the hope that
something may be developed that will
go to show collusion. Should this be the
case. City Attorney Creswell will in all
probability be ordered to have the case
reopened. Mr. Creswell declared yester
day that if he could secure a new trial of

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERY,
A Positive Cure for Dyspepsia.
This may read as though we were
putting it a little strong because it is
generally thought by the majority of
people that Dyspepsia in its chronic
form is incurable, or practically so.
But we have long since shown that
Dyspepsia is curable, nor is it such a
difficult matter as it first appears.
The trouble with Dyspeptics is that
they are continually dieting, starving
themselves, or going to opposite ex-
tremes or else deluging the already
overburdened stomach with "bitters,"
"after dinner pills," etc., which invaria-
bly increase the difficulty even if in
some cases they do give a slight tem-
porary relief. Such treatment of the
stomach simply makes matters worse.
What the stomach wants is a rest.
Now how can the stomach become
rested, recuperated and at the same
time the body nourished and sustained?
This is the great secret and this is
also the secret of the uniform success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. This
is a comparatively new remedy, but its
success and popularity leave no doubt
as to its merits.
The tablets will digest the food any-
way, regardless of condition of stom-
ach.
The sufferer from dyspepsia, accord-
ing to directions, is to eat an abund-
ance of good, wholesome food and use
the tablets before and after each meal
and the result will be that the food
will be digested no matter how bad
your dyspepsia may be, because as be-
fore stated, the tablets will digest the
food even if the stomach is wholly
inactive. To illustrate our meaning
plainly, if you take 1800 grains of meat,
eggs or ordinary food and place it in a
temperature of 9S degrees, and put with
it one of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets j
it will digest the meat or eggs almost
as perfectly as if the meat was en- '
closed within the stomach.
The stomach may be ever so weak
yet these tablets will perform the work I
of digestion and the body and brain '
will be properly nourished and at the
same time a radical, lasting cure of
dyspepsia will be made, because the
much abused stomach will be given, to
some extent, a much needed rest. Your
druggist will tell you that of the many
remedies advertised to cure dyspepsia
none of them has given so complete
and general satisfaction as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets and not least in imÂ»
portance in these hard times is the fact
that they are also the cheapest and
give the most good for the least
money.

CONSPIRED TO
KILL NEVILLS
Sensational Story Told in
a Court at Fresno
City.
Thomas Nolan Claims He Was
Offered a Fortune to
Take Life.
Swear* That Foreman Azhderian
Tried to Have Him Murder
His Employer.
SpeclaJ Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April 19.â The trial of the
battery ca.se brought by M. H. Azh
derian against Thomas Dolan came up
before Recorder Clark to-day and the
alleged conspiracy to kill Captain Nev
ills, the wealthy vineyardist, was
brought out. At the session held to
night Dolan disclosed the whole plot.
On the Bth of the present month
Thomas Dolan, who was employed on
t'aptain Nevills' La Favorita vineyard
when M. 1 Azhderian was foreman
there, met Azhderian at the Grand
Central Hotel and they had a collision
and exchanged warm words. It aDDeaxs
that there was considerable bitterness
between the two, growing out of an al
leged effort to assassinate Captain Nev
ills. It is claimed by Dolan and his
friends that Azhderian and Mrs. Elsie
"Williams had entered into a conspiracy
to have Captain Nevills assassinated
while his wife was away in China.
Azhderian was foreman for Nevills and
Mrs. Williams was his housekeeper. It
is claimed that they wanted Dolan to
do the killing by arousing Nevills' al
ways too-high temper and killing him
if he made for Dolan.
W. D. Grady appeared for Azhderlan
and Judge *Stanton Carter fur Dolan.
He is also Captain Nevills' attorney.
Frank 11. Short and Judge Church, at
torneys in the Azhderian- Xevills cases,
were on hand to help Grady, and, prob
ably, to keep a startling story from
coming out.
Charles C. Toung was called and
sworn. He lives at the Grand Central
Hotel, where he is night clerk. M. H.
Azhderian and Thomas Dulan were at
the hotel on the Bth instant. Azh
derian, he said, came in ahead and
went into the office, closing the door.
Dolan came up to guard the entrance
and called Azhderian vile names. Azh
derian went to a telephone and called
an officer. Dolan dared Azhderian to
come outside. Dolan said: ,
"You coward. You have been threat
ening to kill me; now come out here
and do it."
The witness heard Dolan say: "You
wanted to kill me, Nevills, and be
cause I didn't do it you wanted to kill
me; now come and do it. you !"
R. P. Russell was the next witness.
He said that when Dolan was arrested
Dolan said, speaking to Azhderian:
"I'll get even with you yet."
Henry Russell, a policeman, was
sworn, and said that D<Man had talked
to him previous to the occurenoe. Do
lan wanted to knuw if Russell had seen
Azhderian. He said he was going to
have trouble that night; that he would
meet Azhderian at 11:30 o'clock at the
Grand Central, and he would strike
him. Thought he would be arrested;
said maybe I'd better â
Mr. Carter asked the witness if Dolan
ha-d not told him that Azhderian had
offered him (10,000 to kill Captain Ne
vills. Russell said he did not remember
any such statement. He could not def
initely remember that Dolan had told
him that Azhderian had sent for him
and wanted to kill him because he re
fused to kill Captain Nevills. There
was some such conversation, but it was
vague.
The most sensational testimony was
brought out at the evening Besslon. ML
H. Azhderian, the first witneses, was
asked If he had not sent word to
Dolan that he wanted him. He an
swered that he had not.
"Is it not a fact that Dolan accused
you of attempting to kill Captain Nev
ills?"
The witness did not remember. He
was asked if he had not proposed to
Dolan that Dolan go into court and
deny that there was any attempt to kill
Nevills. An objection to this question
was sustained.
"Did you have a quarrel with Dolan,
accusing him of going to San Francisco
to tell Captain Nevills of the attempt
to kill him?" was asked.
"No." was the reply.
"Did you follow him to San Francisco
to prevent him seeing Nevills?"
"No."
"Did you ever tell Dolan you would
have killed him if he told Nevills?"
This was objected to.
"Did you ever make the statement
that you would blackmail Captain Nev
ills out of $50,000 or get into the pen
within a year?"
"No."
Dolan took the stand and testified in
substance as follows:
"I quit work for Captain Nevills on
July 9, because my life was in danger.
AzhderiaÃ made me an offer to kill
Captain Nevills, offering me $15,000 for
the job. Azhderian said: 'Miss Loose
Miss Williams and I will be there and
the assassination will take place be
hind the house. I will tell the captain
that you ar^ not doing your work and
are stealing tools. He will then come
back of the house and jump on you
and then you can kill him.'
"He said I would be arrested but that
they would clear me. Miss Williams
was to run up stairs and get the cap
tain's pistol and place it at his side
after he had been killed. Azhderian
promised to pay me from the crop In
the vineyard, which was worth $25 000
He said he : ,d the papers already!
Azhderian said the money would en
able me to go away or go into busi
ness."
The witness said he came to town and
told the story to Coon Crutcher, dej-u.v
constable. Afterward he went out to
the vineyard and heard Mrs. Williams
ask whether Azhderian thought he (the
witness) had nerve enough to kill the
captain. Azhderian said if Dolan would
not do it they would.
An adjournment was then taken until
to-morrow !
BANQUET FOR CONVICTS.
Tollers on the Marin Boulevard Par-
take of a Priest's Charity.
SAN RAFAEL, April 19.â Thirty-five
convicts employed on the boulevard in
process of construction between here and
Tiburon received a message of good cheer
to-day in the shape of a substantial re
past, tendered by Rev. Father Lagan,
whose charitable work in lightening
the burdens of those . who have deviat
ed from the path of rectitude has won
for him die admiration of the community.
At noon Father Lagan, accompanied by
Prison Director Wilkins, Judge Angellotti,
County Clerk Bonneau, District Attorney
Martlnelli and County Treasurer Fallon,
went down to where the men were work
ing, the viands being transported In an
express wagon. There were no stereo
typed methods of giving and receiving.
"Eat ami enjoy yourselves, boys," said
Father Lagan, and the "boys" fell to and
did Justice to everything In si^rht without
wore ado.
OREGON CITIES
MENACED BY A
DREAD EPIDEMIC
Two Deaths From Cerebro=
Spinal Meningitis Reported
From Ilwaco.
ASTORIA, Or., April 19.â There was much excitement In this city
to-day when it was learned that there were three or four cases of cere
bro-spinal menir-'tis In Ilwaco, directly across the river from here.
Telegram after telegram was sent for information, and the Health Offi
cer of this city endeavored to learn the facts with a view of estab
lishing a quarantine if necessary. The authorities at Ilwaco at first re
fused to disclose any of the facts, evidently fearing the ill effect it
would have on the reputation of their town. To-night Dr. Redmond.
United States army, stationed at Fort Canby, near Ilwaco, telegraphs
as follows:
"Two cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis of the fulminate form
have occurred in Ilwaco in the past two days in the practice of Dr.
Gosnell. The first case was that of Ralph Finley, occurring Sunday
morning and ending fatally in twenty-four hours. The second case
was that of Leslie Mesrenger, occurring Monday afternoon and termin
ating in death in eighteen hours. A third case is now under observa
tion at Ocean Park, but the symptoms of the latter case are as yet
mild. All were young men from 18 to 21 years of age and 'n robust
health. So far the origin of the disease is not traceable to any particu
lar source. Confirmatory evidence of the diagnosis was obtained by
the autopsy."
Thorough investigation will be made and steps taken to protect
this city against the dread epidemic.

of Health met at the Governor's office
to-day and organized. Dr. Guinan of
Carson was elected president, Dr. Pat
terson of Reno, secretary, and Dr. S.
C. Gibson of Reno, vice-president. The
following was adopted:
Whereas Under the climatic conditions
at present prevailing on the Pacific Coast
our State Is threatened with an Invasion

HARD STRUGGLE
WITH THE SEA
Tug Fearless Arrives at Port
Townsend With the Sin
tram.
Reports That the Cutter Bear I* Still
at Unalaekw. With All Well
on Board.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORT TOWNSEND, April 19.â The
tug Fearless arrived here to-night,
seven days from Unalaska. The Fear
less left San Francisco with the ship
Sintram in tow for Dutch Harbor and
arrived safely with her tow, but not
without a hard struggle with the sea.
Twice the tug and the ship were parted
by the violence of the storms they en
countered.
The first time the vessels were parted
it was two days before the tug could
get a line to the ship again, owing to
the storm. A few days later another
storm was encountered and the heavy
tow line of the tug was unable to hold
the ship and again the vessels parted.
The storm that time was so st-vere that
the tug and the ship were driven far
apart and it was not until after thirteen
days that the Fearless was able to find
her tow.
From the moment the tug passed
Cape Flattery with the Sintram, gales
and snowstorms were encountered and
at times it was almost impossible for
the powerful tug to make any headway
against the storms.
The Fearless is the tug that was re
cently purchased by the Navy Depart
ment for use as an auxiliary cruiser
and patrol-boat for coast work. It has
not yet been decided whether the ves
sel will be turned over to her purchas
ers at one of the Sound ports or go on
to San Francisco to be fitted for ser
vice in the navy.
The revenue cutter Bear was in port
at Unalaska when the Fearless left for
the south and her officers reported that
the crew was in good health. The
Bear left Seattle late in November last
with the relief expedition to the ice
bound whalers In the vicinity of Point
Barrow.

Veterans at Nevada City
Cheer President and
Congress.
Patriotic Demonstration at the
State Grand Army En
campment.
People of the Mining Town Tender
a Reception to Their
Visitors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVAD.. CITY, April 19.â Armory
hall was a scene of gayety to-night, a
reception having been given there In
honor of the visiting Grand Army vet
erans and their ladles. Over 2000 peo
ple crowded Into the beautifully decor
ated structure, filling It to suffocation,
and hundreds were unable to get In.
Hon. E. M. Preston was president of
the evening. Band and orchestra sup
plied mu^lc, patriotic ballads were
sung by a double quartet and speeches
of welcome were made by Hon. Thomas
H. Carr, Rev. W. C. Gray, Fred Searls,
Rev. J. Sims and Judge Walling, with
eloquent responses by Department
Commander Chipman, General Salo
mon, Judge Buckles, W. H. Searaans
and other visiting veterans.
The parade will occur to-morrow
forenoon. It will be headed by Colonel
Guthrie and staff and Companies C and
I of the Second California Infantry. In
the evening the visitors will be taken
to the mines on Deer Creek, below the
city, every available conveyance for
miles around having been brought in to
transport them.
The thirty-first annual encampment
of the Grand Army of the Republic of
California began this morning. Gen
eral N. P. Chipman of Red Bluff, de
partment commander, was In the chair,
and 200 delegates were present. The
morning session was consumed by the
hearing of reports. When the follow
ing passage In reference to the Cu
ban question was read In the com
mander's report the wildest kind of en
thusiasm prevailed; the old veterans
sprang to their feet and continued to
cheer until they were out of breath:
"I recommend that an expression be
given to President AlcKinley of o-ur
confidence in his devotion to the
highest and best interests of our coun
try and in his ability to guide the na
tion with honor through every peril, in
peace or in war, and that we have like
confidence in the American Congress,
without w^ose support all efforts of the
President must be unavailing."
The address concludes thus: "Let us
all rededicate ourselves to our country
and our flag. Let there go out from
this encampment no uncertain voice
in this hour of the nation's peril. Let
our attitude toward any hostile foe
that may rise up against us be ex
pressed in the sentiment, 'Our coun
try'âmay it ever be right; but right or
wrong, our country.' "
At 5 the encampment adjourned un
til to-morrow evening, when five mem
bers of the Veterans' Home Associa
tion are to be elected and candidates
for other offices will probably be placed
In nomination so as to shut off nomi
nating speeches Thursday morning, for
which time the general election is to
be held. To-night's recess was taken
in respect to the memory of those vet
erans who have died during the year.
Lincoln Post of San Francisco held
caucuses at noon to-day and unani
mously indorsed the candidacy of W.
W. Seamans of Los Angeles for de-
partment commander. His friends
claim this move insures his election.
The Woman's Relief Corps was in
session all evening transacting only
routine business, there being a good
average attendance. An hour's session
will be held to-morrow morning. At
night secret work will be exemplified
by department officers, after which me
morial services will be held for the
past department presidents, Mrs. Liz
zie D. Waterman and Mrs. Abbie E.
Johnston, who died during the year.
The ladies of the Grand Army of the
Republic were in session from 2 to 5
this afternoon, and will meet again at
8:30 to-morrow morning. Their elec
tion will probably be held on Thursday
morning. Officers' reports show that
during the year two new circles have
been formed, making twenty-seven in
the State, and the membership has In
creased from 750 to 900.
The principal business to come up
this session will be the renewal of the
effort to raise funds for establishing a
home for veterans and the wives of
veterans. This movement was started
several years ago, but has of late been
dormant. Members believe the time
is now ripe for getting at work on the
proposition again, and will devise a
plan of action.
The Sons of Veterans, after a three
hours' business session this afternoon,
adjourned until 8 to-morrow night.
Twenty delegates are here and more
are expected to-morrow.

at Milpitas.
Whites Cause the Imprison

Accuse Them of Violating thÂ« Cubic-
Air Ordinance in a Cannery
Bunkhous*.
SAN JOSE, April 19.â The trouble be
tween the Oakland Preserving Com
pany and its former employes at the
cannery at Milpitas was renewed to
day in a different manner, and the lit
tle town Is all excitement again. Last
night Antonio Sepulveda went before
Justice Jones and swore to warrants
charging the seventy-eight Chinese
employed in the cannery with violat
ing the State cubic air ordinance. The
arrests were made under the State law
which makes it a misdemeanor for any
persoq to sleep in or occupy a room or
apartment for the purpose of lodging
which contains less than 500 cubic feet
of air. This law, it is claimed, is open
ly violated by the cannery company
and its employes. In the bunkhouse
built for the men the officers found
seventy-eight Chinese packed in like
sardines, with less than 200 cubic feet
of air to each individual.
The men were arrested by Constable
Matthews and taken before Justice
Jones. They pleaded not guilty and
gave bonds of $20 each, with Charles
Cropley and Michael Bellew, as sure
ties. Their trial was set for Thursday
morning.
The people of Milpitas, whose places
in the cannery were taken by the Chi
nese, are determined to drive out the
Chinese. This Is but one of several
moves contemplated to make it hot for
the coolies, and as soon as it is settled
some other action will be taken.

SATTSALITO'S NEW TRUSTEES.
Messrs. Cnimpton and Thomas Take
the Oath of Office.
SAUSALITO, April 19.â Tho new Board
of Trustees met last night. Adolph Sylva, j
Dr. H. J. Crumpton and J. Thomas were j
sworn in. Generel Dickinson and L. G.
Ambjornsen, the hold-overs, took their
oath of office anew. General Dickinson
was re-elected chairman, with Ambjorn
sen voting in the negative.
V. D. Linsley took his oath of office as
town treasurer, and genial "Jack" Han
non as town marshal. The resignation of
O. C. Miller, superintendent of streets, was
accepted. An adjournment was then
taken until May 2.
The keynote of the policy of the new
board is crystallized in the remark of
Trustee Thomas:
"1 am for anything that will increase
the revenue of the town and benefit its
citizens without casting a shadow on our
good name." . .
It is a current "josh" that in case of
war General Dickinson's place as chair
man may be supplanted.

J. Hill to vacate the Mayor's chair, which
It is claimed he holds illegally, according
to Judge Dooling's decision, and to turn
over to Francee all books, papers and
other property which are in any way con
nected with the office. The petition will
be fought vigorously.

February of last year, leaving an estate
of $30,000. She married Shearer six months
ago.

Guests.
Rose Carnival Visitors Certain

Even the Children Have Coma For
ward to Make ths Parade
Attractive.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April 19.â Ab the days
wear on the fact becomes plainer that
the coming rose festival will indeed be
a "thing of beauty," and even if the
joy does not last forever there will be
enough of it crowded Into two days to
satisfy the most carping cynic.
What is causing the committee much
thinking and argument at present is
the matter of a suitable programme
for Saturday evening. May 7. In ad
dition to other minor points this was
discussed at a meeting of the execu
tive committee last evening. Some
were in favor of a display of fireworks
which would undoubtedly be an inter
esting feature. If fireworks should be
agreed upon San Kafael will be the
"strategic point."
Mrs. L. J. Hamm has persuaded the
committee to accept a modification of
the grand arch. It was in accordance
with her ideas that Farnsworth drew
the design originally agreed upon, but
Mrs. Hamm is seldom satisfied with a
first idea and in this instance the town
will profit thereby.
The primary school, the Infant of
the county educational system, has
turned disdainfully away from preced
ent for this great occasion and will
"show off" in the parade as big as any
body. Its float will represent a ship
on which will be a neatly costumed
crew of juvenile aspirants for glory.
The rest of the pupils will haul the
float along. Additional features will
be decided upon soon.

A stenographer for a large law firm in Boston had a rather
common experience : "My work," she said, "is very nervous and ex-
acting, and^l used to leave the office utterly exhausted. At night I
would often have the most horrible dreams, and sometimes wake up ia
a cold sweat. Once I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed clutch-
ing the bed clothes frantically with both hands. I became so dis-
heartened that I finally told my employer I must give up my position,
but he laughed, and said he wanted me to stay, and then suggested
that I try his remedy for such troubles. He gave me half a dozen
Ripans Tabules and told me to take one after dinner and another
before going to bed. I did so, and rested better that very night
Now, whenever I feel nervous, I take just one Tabule before retiring
and I sleep right through till morning, and get up thoroughly rested
and ready for business. For a sleep-producer and a Quieter of tbt

t >-â  Again the girl soon to be left
behind was in evidence, and a second
look at many disclosed a familiar fig
ure, last seen in a corner of the Pre
sidio gun shed or hanging on the arm
of some punniT, waiting for the as
sembly call. They had come down
from the post for another good-by, and
there on tho platform they staid. Cap
tain Potts tried to hurry the men, but
neither he nor his officers interfered
with the leave taking. The gunners
looked out for the guns and the drivers
looked out for the horses, and every
one looked out for the girls, and felt
bad for them and wondered how long
they would keep the buttons the sol
diers, with many a laugh and joke, cut
from their coatsleeves and gave to as
many girls as there were buttons.
Some of those buttons will be kept.
It was not all joke and Jocose farewell.
There were tears and sighs and brave
little smiles that had much better been
hitter weeping; for all the deception
they proved, and there was handshak
ing and then as the last guns were be
ing loaded and every one saw the end
was really near there was many a kiss
many a head that hung low for
fear a glance might cause a break and
spoil the parting.
Again the busy little bugles trilled a
call. It was the assembly, and that
meant the end. fcome boys from Bat
tery F were singing in the midst of a
crowd of friends, but the cry of the
bugle broke the song, and the men
Btarted for their line. One man kissed
i very girl he knew, others looked as if
they would have liked to, but contented
themselves with shaking hands. Flow
ers were tossed to the blue coats and
< the men tried to look brave as they
straightened up under the eyes of their
officers.
' >ne man with his head bound up was
lustily cheered. He had been hit with
the pole of one of the caissons, and be
cause it did not knock him senseless he
was the hero of the hour.
Formed in twos, the two batteries
started for the freight ferry at the Coot
of King street. The boat was not in, so
they waited, and once more those who
had twice saiÂ«l ffood-by were allowed
ther handshake. Then the boat came
In and the cars were run on, and the
order "Forward" was given.
The crowds had again eluded the po
lice, and had taken possesion <>f all the
s and wharf piles in the neighbor-
They had been somewhat silent
f<T quite a while, but as the first bat
tery start.! 1 , steadily down the wharf
tli" enthusiasm broke out afresh, and
cheer upon cheer rent the air. The bat
teriea were cheered: the guns and the
men who would so gallantly man thorn;
the officers, the Hag, and even Sport,
t dog of Battery C, who has
,r wearing a blanket and
Haunting the legend "Cuba or Bust,"
was rh.Â»-red to the echo. And one man,
leaning out froms the top of a fence and
frantically waving his free arm, gave
ry that may be famous, "Remem
ber the Maine."
The boat started at once, and the
locomotive that hrtuled ihe cars down
1 a long farewell, winning an ai;
swering blast from the steamer. The
soldiers gathered on the stern of the
ferry and cheered while the crowd
broke from the police and running
down the wharf answered with a will.
And so they watched until the boat
was out of sight, and as the people
turned homeward the mournful wail of
the siren on that grim lighter tho Mon
terey, saluting the passing ferry,
brought home the fact that the bat

It was a spectacle that made the hearts
of the soldiers leap with enthusiasm.
Ranks were broken immediately and
the men, who all day long had gone
about their duties with scarcely a trace
of emotion, seemed suddenly electrified
and casting aside all restraint answered
cheer with cheer, nor were their voices
hushed again, except during the short

to by the boat's whistle and the bol
diers' cheers.
A short distance further on the moni
tor Monterey was seen lying at anchor
off Folsom street, and the men of the
two batteries clambered on to the tops
of the cars and sent three mighty cheers
over the water to their comrades in
arms. There was a sudden commotion
on the big warship, for the source of
the cheering was instantly recognized.
A bugle rang out the call to Quarters,
and, whilo the crew was forming in line
on deck, three blasts of her siren, loud
er, more piercing than that of any
ship that ever reverberated over the
waters of the bay, gave a godspeed to
the vanguard of warriors that could
be heard from Kearny street to the
Alameda shore.
Then the sailor boys burst into
cheers, and, while the Transit's whistle
was responding, the revenue cutter U.
S. Grant, anchored a short distance
from the Monterey, added her voice to
the roar. The shouts of the throngs
left behind on the dock still came faint
ly across the water, and the soldiers
made no attempt to curb their enthu
siasm. Tiny llaga, that had been thrust
into their hands by school children
along the route or draped around their
Blouch hats by sweethearts or wives.
were waved with a vim while they
shouted until they were hoarse.
Half way to Goat Island the big
ferry-boat Oakland was met. The
boats exchanged the customary salutes,
while the passengers crowded to the
rail and cheered and waved hats and
handkerchiefs. Again the soldiers sent
forth their voices, answering cheer
with cheer until the boats had drawn
so far apart that the sound could not
be hoard.
At the torpedo station in Shelter
Cove, Goat Island, the lighthouse ten
der Madrona lay tied to the wharf, and
she, too, saluted the departing soldiers.
For a brief interval comparative quiet
reigned, only to- be broken as the Tran
sit drew near to Oakland Creek. The
ferry-boat Encinal, lying at the nar
row-gauge slip, was the first to greet
the soldiers, her whistle and the an
swering toots from the Transit arous- j
ing the lightkeeper who lives in the lit- !
tie house perched up on stilts at the \
end of the restraining wall. Hastily j
running up the stars and stripes on the j
flagstaff he dipped the colors three :
times and then started the deep-toned \
fogbell to clanging. The locomotives |
on the pier joined in the greeting, while j
the people there cheered lustily.
It was one long ovation during the
entire run to Peralta-street landing,
and it did not end even there, for the
residents of Oakland had yet to offer
up their tribute. Quite a crowd was
then gathered on the dock, but it was
then 6 o'clock, and many whu had
waited all the afternoon to get a
parting glimpse of the men had gone
home.
There was no time for the exchange
of compliments then, and silently the
men marched off the boat and over to
the long train of coaches â if such they
may be termed â in waiting beside the
ferry slip to convey them across the
continent.
The Southern Pacific receives $40 per
man to Tennessee, more than some
roads charge second class passengers
to New York, and furnish them with
comfortable sleepers, yet the cars pro
vided for the artillerymen were hardly
I fit to herd cattle in. They were the
oldest and cheapest owned by the com
pany, and were practically abandoned
long ago, the only use to which they
have been put for years being to run
to and from the race tracks. They were
at one time used as emigrant sleepers,
but the uncovered board seats have
been nailed up so that they can no
longer be made into the semblance of
a bed. Into these poorly ventilated,
comfortless cars the men tumbled with
out a murmur, and laying aside their
aecouterments hastened to the baggage
cars to procure their knapsacks, blan
kets and overcoats.
A detail was told off to supply the
men with rations from the commissary
i car, for they carry their own supplies
! with them as well as fodder for th"
horses. Great loaves of bread fully two
feet long 'and as light and wholesome
as was ever baked were distributed in
generous quantities throughout the
cars, together with cans of beans, cold
meats and vegetables. There was no
opportunity to make or purchase coffee
so the canteens were filled from the
water tanks and the men proceeded to
attack their cold supper with as keen
a relish as though they were back in
their old quarters at the Presidio bar
j racks.
A Pullman f'-eper was attached for
t the accommodation of the officers, and
twenty minutes after the Transit
i reached the slip the long train started.
It was in one section with two engines
when it left Oakland, the cars contain
ing the horses, guns and baggage being
in front of the passenger coaches, but
! it will be broken up into two or three
j sections when the mountains are
! reached.
There was a long delay In the Oak
land yards, where hundreds of people
had gathered to bid the soldiers fare
well. By this time supper had been
finished, pipes lighted and the men
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APKIL 20, 1898.
WILL MARCH AT 1:30 P. M. TO-DAY.
The First Infantry, Colonel Miles commanding, will leave
the Presidio immediately after the dinner hour to-day.
Tho officers of the regiment expect that they will be in
line and marching on the way to the ferries at lÂ»30 o'clock.
The route will be along Lombard street to Van Ness ave
nue, to Golden Gate avenue to Market and on down to the
boat. Companies A, B and C of the Police Department will
act as the advance guard to clear the street. Then will
come Troop I, Fourth Cavalry, escorting the regiment on
its way to the war as far as the ferry. The band of the
regiment on the way will play many of the familiar old
airs of the soldiers. They will be: "The Girl I Left Be
hind Me," "Hail, Columbia," "Yankee Doodle," "Tenting on
the Old Camp Ground," "Red, White and Blue," "Glory,
Glory, Hallelujah," "Battle Cry of Freedom."
were in the best of humor, answering
cheer with cheer and Joking and flirting
with the pretty girls.
At Sixteenth street a brief stop was
made to enable the few civilians who
had accompanied the troops thus far on
their journey to alight. Although it was
then 7:05 o'clock, fully 500 people were
at the station, many of whom had wait
ed there since 2 o'clock to see the boys.
The crowd had been several times
larger earlier in the day, but most of
the people had grown tired and gone
home.
Among the number in waiting were a
few women with tear-stained faces,
who had bidden good-by to some one of
the soldiers in San Francisco, and had
then hastened across the bay in the
hope of one more word â one more kiss.
Their devotion was rewarded, for the
favored ones quickly saw them and
hastened out of the cars. Their fare
wells were cut short, though, for with
a triple blast from the two locomotives
the train again began to move and
batteries C and F were fairly on their
way to the war, followed by the cheers
and prayers of those they left behind.
The train will reach Los Angeles
about 4 o'clock this afternoon, when
the first stop of any length will be
made. There the horses will be ex
ercised and given the first water they
will have since they left the Presidio.
Only one stop a day will be made for
this purpose, and it is doubtful if they
will be even exercised more than once
after leaving Los Angeles.
ERIN'S SONS ARE READY.
Knights of the Red Branch Rifles
Volunteer for the Flag.
First among the patriotic Celtic associations of the city arise the
Knights of the Red Branch to volunteer for active service on behalf of
the "Stars and Stripes." They feel competent to raise a regiment of vet
erans In two days, and only desire the word to move promptly on the na
tion's foes.
Following is the inspiring, soldier-like application made by the Rifles
yesterday to the chief executive of the State:
TO MAN THE FORTS.
Militiamen Expected to Be
Called to Garrison the
Presidio.
It Is generally believed at the Presidio
that after the First Infantry leaves to
day and the President calls for volun
teers a regiment of California Infantry
will be ordered to take station' at the
Presidio. As soon as war Is declared the
four troops of cavalry now stationed at
the post expect to be ordered to the front,
and that four troops of California, if not
more, will take their place.
No change lias been made in the time
of departure of officers and civilian em
ployes from department headquarters.
General Shafter will leave Thursday
morning for liiakersliold, and the staff will
leave Thursday evening for New Orleans.
The general will join them at Bakersfleld.
Colonel Tames M. Moore, accompanied
by his chief clerk, started yesterday
morning for New Orleans, where the colo
nel will select a camping ground for the
troops.
The following order, from headquarters
of the army, was received yesterday at

NATIONAL GUARD.
Adjutant-General Barrett Es-
tablishes Headquarters
in San Francisco.
The men and officers of the National
Guard now rest on their arms, while
a suppressed excitement of eager ex
pectancy for the word of command en
thuses each patriot.
There is in the quiet prevailing In the
military circles of the State that omin
ous suggestion of the calm before the
fury of the storm. Everything Is now
in readiness, and when the orders come
flashing over the wires from Washing
ton California will be found under arms
and prepared to take her place in the
ranks.
This was the consensus of expressions
given out yesterday by the command
ing officers of the National Guard, who
only await the time to prove the
strength of the patriotic assertions.
No orders have yet been received from
the War Department at Washington,
and none are expected until the Presi
dent calls upon the different States for
their quota of men.
Adjutant General Barrett, Major
General Dickinson and Brigadier Gen
eral Warn" eld paid their respects yes
terday to General Shafter. The visit
was purely one of courtesy, and there
was no conference, as was reported.
They will also to-day formally call
upon General Morriam.
None of these officers has received
any orders beyond those that have al
ready been given to them to be in
readiness. They are not inclined to
talk, for they realize the gravity of the
present situation. The War Depart
ment has not yet issued any orders to
the Governor.
Arrangements were made yesterday
under direction of Adjutant General
Barrett by which the commissary de
partment of each organization of tho
National Guard of this State will be
able to secure all supplies that may be
needed for the guard during the time
that It shall be In service, be that for a
long or short period. .
Adjutant General Barrett has for the
present established his headquarters
at the California Hotel In this city, and
It is probable that within a day or two
Governor Budd, as commonder-in-chlef,
will establish his headquarters here.

PATRIOTIC WOMEN.
Addie L. Bailou Volunteers to
Nurse the Wounded
and Sick.
Palfornia women are coming to the
front in volunteering their services as
nurses should they be required in case
of hostilities. Addie L. Bailou has
taken the initiative in a letter to the
President, offering to do any service in
the field the War Secretary might di
rect. Her letter is as follows:
Room 62. 1170 Market Street,
San Francisco, April 3, 1898.
Hon. William McKinley, Commander-in-
Chief of the Annies and President of the
I'nited States, Washington, D. Câ Dear
Sir: The morrow is significant in the her
aldry of peace or war. American women
love peace, but they love honor more, and
are not second to American sons in that
loyalty which prefers <leath to dishonor,
and the heroic defense of "Old Glory," the
standard of our liberties which insures
protection to our homes, to our free pub
lic schools, free press, free pulpit, free
platform and a free people.
As loyally as in my young yearslenlist
ed for service for the Union and emanci
pation of the oppressed, so now, at your
command, I pledge my more experienced
years and a promise of enlistment of com
panies of either men for the Held or wo
men for the hospitals in honor of the flag.
Very sincerely yours,
ADDIE L. BALLOU.

P. S.â Women desirous of serving as
nurses call upon me almost daily.
The following' reply was received by
Mrs. Bailou yesterday:

Dear Madam: I beg leave to acknowl
edge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd

they be needed, and to inform you that it
has been referred for the consideration of
the Secretary of War. Very truly yours,

LOYAL CITIZENS.
Resolve to Uphold the Presi

Volunteers.
At an enthusiastic meeting of mer
chants and others in the Chamber of
Commerce yesterday afternoon, Vice-
President C. L. Nelson presiding, the
following resolutions, offered by Wil
liam M. Bunker and seconded by Col
onel C. L. Taylor, were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, Signs point to a war with
Spain, and the services of American pa
triots are indispensable; be it
Resolved, That we heartily fridorse the
action of the President and Congress of
the United States and pledge our support
to the national cause; and no it further
Resolved. That we encourage our Na
tional Guardsmen and volunteers in every
way, shape and form, and that we in
dorse the policy of returning guardsmen
and volunteers to their respective posi
tions after the war and encourage the
idea of making allowance for the support
of their families while said volunteers are
engaged in* their country's defense.
IRISH VOLUNTEERS.
Sons of the Emerald Isle
Ready to Defend
Old Glory.
A largely attended meeting of Irish-
American citizens, most of whom were
formerly members of the National
Gfcard of this and other States and of
independent military companies, was
held at K. R. B. Hall last night for the
purpose of organizing an Irish volun
teer regiment to represent "the fight-
Ing race" from California.
Colonel J. Sheehy, formerly of the
N. G. C, was called to the chair. He
explained the object of the meeting,
and In a few moments 243 stalwart
Irishmen had signed the roll. The
efficiency, of the new volunteer regiment
can be judged by the fact that all of
those who signed the roll have served
either as National Guardsmen or as
members of private military companies.
A few of those present, notably Com
rades John Skelly and Thomas Degnan,
served during the Civil War.
Temporary officers were elected as
follows: Colonel, J. Sheehy; lieuten
ant-colonel, M. Mannlx; majors, P. J.
Halligan and W. B. Shorten; commis
saries, John Skelly and T. Degnan;
Drs. John Kilemede and George Egan
volunteered their services as surgeons.
A further meeting will be held at 2
p. m. Sunday afternoon.

The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location giving strength
and development just where It is needed.

THE VIGILANT SOLD.
A Place In the Navy Will Be
Filled by the Speedy
Tug.
The tug Vigilant yesterday was add
ed to the fleet of America's naval ves
sels. The purchase price of $60 was
agreed upon and late in the forenoon
the vessel was again taken to the naval
representative at the Union Iron Works
and the formal transfer was made. A
week ago the Navy Department ar
ranged to purchase the tugs Fearless,
Vigilant and Active from the J. D.
Spreckels Bros. Company's line. An
agreement was reached between the
owners and the representatives of the
navy and the Vigilant and Active were
turned aver to the purchasers. The
Fearless was and is still at sea, but
she will be given to her new owners as
soon as -he returns. Her arrival is now
hourly expected. The text of the
agreement between the representatives
of the navy and the tugboat owners
was telegraphed to Washington, but
there was some misunderstanding as
to the price asked for the Vigilant. The
naval officials telegraphed that the
Vigilant could be purchased for $56,000

and word was sent back to purchase
her ah/ng with the other two. When
the formal transfer came to be made
the mistake was discovered. Sprocket
Bros. Company aprain took possession
of their vessel and held her until the
tangrle was straighter.eil out, and yes
terday the price asked by Mr. Spreckels
was paid, and the tug became one of
the vessels of the navy.
Men acquainted with vessels say
the price paid by the Government for
the tug was a reasonable one. and. In
fact, they agree that all three tugs
were bought at a fair valuation. Mr.
Spreckels says the price he set on the
vessels he sold to the navy was Just
what they were worth to him. The
towing fleet of the "Black Stack" com
pany has been crippled by the sale of
the three tugs, and the managers of it
say that their business will be almost
suspended until the places of the ves

sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low

in summer and colder weather in winter. The

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 19.â There are men In I
Wall street still who believe that not a gun I
will be fired in war between the United States
an<i Spain. It is difficult to find what they
base this assumption on, but they hold it with
sufficient tenacity to decline to sell out their
holdings in securities and they buy additional
securities at any material decline. * These buy
ers were in the market at the opening to-day
and they sustained prices above th? London
parity, thus inviting sales from arbitrage
houses and on account of many thousand
shares of international securities which had
bf-en bought In London at the lower price*
ruling there. The early declines in London
showed a practical abandonment of the hopes I
or peace and the Spanish 4*Â« both in London
and Paris dropped 34 per cent. This weak
ness of Spanish securities was especially de
moralizing on the Paris Bourse. The support
accorded to Americans in New York against
the opening here without change in sentiment
in London and also in Berlin and later deal
ings there witnessed ... . In Americans,
though the Spanish bonds continued to drop.
This tendency continued in London even after
the close of the exchange in the trading on the
street. It was a tendency that gave color
to the belief in certain circles in Wall street
that Spain is preparing to relinquish Cuba as
a last resort. The selling here for London ac
count was nevertheless sufficient to effect de
clines all through the lists. The International
Stocks led in the trading and nearly all Show
ed declines of a point or upward. The bear
traders were to some extent causing a slight
rally from the lowest. There was at no time
any heavy pressure of liquidation. Dealings
were slightly larger than yesterday and were
much better distributed, but the market was
still very narrow and there was no very big |
movement in prices.
Operations in the money market continues
much restricted though there is no apparent
la'-k of money for call loans on the stock ex
change, loans being made at 1 per cent. The
tone of the exchange market was rather firm
er and there were no important engagements
of gold for Import. Holders of money are in- I
clined, to nwait the decision of the Govern
ment as a bond Imue.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 19.â The Evening Post's \
London financial cablegram says: The city
Is relinquishing all hopes of peace between the
United States and Spain, and considers that |
â war can only be averted by a miracle. Con- j
sequently there was a heavy tone In all the
j stock markets to-day, especially for all Paris
j specialties, the bourse there being demoralized j
, by the continued fall in Spanish 4's, which j
I closed at the lowest, 37. Wonder is expressed j
here that Americans hold their own bo well. j
I Many were restrained from selling too freely ;
by the manner In which New York was ab- j
sorbing stock. The close was comparatively
steady. The view is held In some quarters |
that the outbreak of war will stop gold ship- :
i ments to New York because of the high in- I
surance premium. Some well-informed people ''
â¢ think otherwise, having regard to the fact
i that shipments could be made via Canada.
I Gold was in stronger demand for New York j
I to-day. The arrivals of German coin were .
[ large and more Is coming as the result of the !
j Bank of England's policy, outlined In these ]
j dispatches yesterday.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, April 19â The wool market her*
continues very dull, and the actual business
has been the least of any week yet reported.
The fact of the matter'is that with war look
ing very probable there is less disposition on
the part of the manufacturers to buy wool than
Binoe the trouble first began. Dealers as a
rule are accepting the situation as it is, and
where they see no one desiring to buy wool
they are not trying to force business, although
a buyer with cash could probably get conces
sions from present prices quoted on nearly all
kinds of domestic wool.

TO SAVE THE
WATER FRONT
Many Reasons Advanced
for Preventing Any
Change.
E. C. Sessions Publishes His
Views on the Subject at
Some Length.
Does Not. Believe a ChangÂ© in Pier
head. Lines Advisable at
Present.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, April 19.
It being realized that the apparent in
activtty of the Water Front Company at
the meeting in San Francisco yesterday
does not properly represent the feelings of
rporation in the proposed change of
the pier-head line, a protest has been
drawn up l>y the special attorneys for the
tity of Oakland and is to-day being ac
tively circulated. Thi* protest is as fol-
1 rws:
To the United States Board of Engi
neers: The undersigned, residents and
property owners of the city of Oakland,
respectfully and earnestly protest
against the proposed change of the pier-
t of the city of Oak-
la:! '., on the following grounds, viz.:
That the change will be greatly to the
injury of the United States, of the State
of California and of the city of Oakland
and of the harbor itself.
To the injury of the United States. In
this, that it the pierhead line, at which
ships may now lie in twenty feet of
water, is receded to the shore line,
which is bare of water at low tide, deep
water for ships must be made at the
new line, necessarily at an enormous ex
pense to the Government. To retire the
perhead line is to efface the present
harbor, which must be restored by
dredging or digging to a depth of twen
ty feet. The effect of the change would
be not only to give a water frontage
to the owners of the shore line but to
force the Government to make a harbor
for their accommodation.
To the injury of the State or Califor
nia, in this, that the change would take
from the [ate a large area now devoted
to the erection of wharves and other
aids to commerce under the dominion
and control of the State, which would
be to deprive the State of the use of
its property without due process of law.
To the Jury of the city of Oakland,
in this, that the change would, under
the present holdings of the courts shut
up all the avenues of commerce of that
city by giving them Into the hands of a
private corporation, at whose mercy ab
solutely would lie the whole trade of thÂ»
city, and all the approaches by water.
To the injury of the harbor, In this,
that the tidal flow would be sluggish
and nut sufficient to scour this portion
of tho estuary if the width in increased
between the points proposed, and the
curvature of the line is made greater
within and at a distance from the mouth
of the estuary If the width is increased
be a continuous filling in front of the
city.
And further, the petition asking for
the said change of the pierhead line Is
obviously not made in good faith, but
solely for the purpose of vesting in the
Oakland Water Front Company, a mo
'nbpbly'Sf the entire water front under
consideration.
The protest will be presented at the con
ference Thursday.
E. C. Sessions, the agent for the sale of
tin water front in this city, made public a
ment to-night in which he ar
Â£;jrs that the proposed pier-head change
â  only legal but practicable, although
â inlts that there is no need of the
â  present.
He says: "1 concur, however. In the
in that no sufficient argrirrient ap
to hf presented to warant a change
In the line in front of Oakland as at pres
ablished."
While it is not clear to the large major
the citizens what the proposed pier
â¢ hange means, and how it conflicts
the lines as already designated,
is a general feeling based on nearly
half a century of experience that if tne
<f\ plan were not for the benefit of
the Water Front Company, nothing would
have be-on heard of it. It has once more
i attention to the compromise of 186S,
upon which the people of this City voted
rably, an<l which was sanctioned by
the Legislature. One of the best posted
::iost reliable residents of Oakland
t^ald to-daj : "The compromise of IS^S was
undoubtedly the best solution of the wa
â¢ 'lit question yet put forward. Had
it been carried out In good faith by both
the city ami the Water Front Company,
nd'a water front controversy would
have ended then and forever. Unfortun
afely the Water Front Company did not
Improve it, did not do anything to further
Iti development by sales to others, but
hedg< s around with all kinds of
restrictions, all having but one end, that
of keeping out railroad competition. On
the other hand the city has periodically
brought up the matter by throwing all
kinds of clouds over the Water Front
Company's title, so that it could^do noth
ing. At the present time there 'is really
nothing more definite in regard to title
and boundary lines than there was in Ist*.

FAIR WAITED AT
AUBURN IN VAIN
Ex - Fire Chief Beaten
in a Race for a
Mine.
DennJs Wired the Coin and
Has Received the
Deed.
An Arrest Was Planned, but Was
Thwarted by thÂ« County
Line.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 19.
â¢A. D. Dennis, the well known patron of
sport and a Broadway cigar dealer, ran
the liveliest race of his life in his attempt
to buy a gold mine.
During the past two or three years Oak
land has been smitten hard with the gold
fever, and everybody with a few dollars
to spare or that could borrow a few dol
lar? has been speculating in mining stock.
Among the most enthusiastic speculators
was ex-Chief Fair of the Fire Depart
ment. Some months ago he heard of a
good thing In Placer County, and with
two or throe others he obtained an option
upon It, putting up a bond. After doing
so he made every possible attempt to
raise the money to complete the pur
chase.
The option held by Fair expired at mid
night on April 12. About two days prior
to that time A. D. Dennis, himself a great
speculator, heard of Chief Fair's "good
thing," and he sent an expert named
Johnson to the mine, which is located
twelve and a half miles from Auburn, to
report on It. The expert satisfied Dennis
and Frank Searing, who was in partner
ship with him, that the mine was valu
able, and they at once determined to pur
chase it.
On the morning of the 14th Dennis
learned that Fair had taken the coin to
Auburn, there to meet Mr. Triblett. the
owner of the mine, and complete the deal.
He at once went to the telegraph office,
caught his expert, Johnson, at Auburn,
authorized him to go out to the Triblett
mine and make the puschaso without de
lay.
Johnson left Auburn with a fleet rig
just as Chief Fair arrived on the train
from Oakland. He heard of Johnson's
mission, and thinking to get the better of
the expert he hired a rig and took a Dep
uty Constable with him hoping that
something might arise which would jus
tify him In having the Constable arrest
and detain Johnson.
Koth teams flew along the county roads
and each was so anxious to get to the
mine first that the race was considered
as being equivalent to a contest with a
$1000 purse hung up for each mile. John
son kept the lead until they reached the
last eate on the route. While he was
opening it Fair and the deputy caught
up with him. Somehow or other there
was an encounter and Johnson said he
was struck on the head with the deputy's
revolver. However, he managed to get
in his rig, and knowing that he was over
the county line, he defied the constable
to do his worst, and renewed his race to
the ranch.
At this point Mr. Fair concluded that
Triblett would probably be in Auburn
ready to close the deal, and that Johnson
would have his trip to the mine for noth
ing. Accordingly Fair drove back.
Johnson finished the Journey, met Mr.
Triblett and closed the deal. Then,
thinking that Fair would be in Auburn,
Johnson persuaded Triblett that It would
be better to go and have the deeds re
corded at Plaeerville, so he and Triblett
; went to Plaeerville and closed their pur
| chase while Mr. Fair was waiting at
1 Auburn for the mine-owner who never
; came.
Dennis now declares he has a fortune
in sight and is busy telling his friends
how he secured it.
THE CROWDED SCHOOLS.
Another Mass Meeting to Be Held to
Discuss the Situation.
I ALAMEDA, April 10.â The meeting of
the Municipal League last evening was al
most entirely devoted to a discussion of
the overcrowded condition of the public
schools and to the best method for alle
viating it. School Director Tlsdale, Dr.
Scott (president of the Board of Educa
tion) and Superintendent Sullivan spoke
in the matter and set forth the evils com
plained of. Statistics were given showing
â  the rapid increase in the number or
school children and the urgent demand
for relief of some kind.
The work of the committee of thirteen
wa.s referred to and regret expressed that
ii had come to naught. Finally, after a
full discussion, it was decided to call a
mass-meeting for some evening next wefk
for the purpose of having another dis
cussion and if possible devising some
means for providing the much-needed ad
ditional accommodation.
WILL BE UNITED.
FRANCIS W, REID and MISS LYNDA ALEXANDER,
in Whose Marriage 30,000 Endeavorers
Are Interested,
SAN JOSE, April 19.â A home wedding of much interest to California
Endeavorers will occur in San Jose Wednesday afternoon, when the Rev. H.
Melville Tenney, pastor of the First Congregational Church, will unite two

fornia Christian Endeavor Union. Miss Mabel C. Stillman of San Jose will
be bridesmaid, and Burton M. Palmer of the Pacific Theological Seminary,
Oakland, will be best man.
Miss Alexander is a native daughter of Eastern Alameda County, who
during five years' residence in the Garden City has endeared herself by
rare personal qualities and devotion to religious work. Mr. Reid, a na
tive of Ontario, has spent most of his life in Santa Clara County and is
one of the best known young men in the State. He graduated with high
eat honors in 1887 from the classical course of the University of the Pacific

he left a successful architectural practice in San Jose to enter the Pacific
Theological Seminary, Oakland, where he will graduate next week. He Is
identified with many branches of religious work and has served the State
Endeavor Union two years as general secretary. Mr. Reid has accepted a
call for one year to the Congregational church of Clayton, Contra Costa
County, where after May 15, the doors of the cozy little parsonage will be
open to ail former friends of the pastor and wife.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 20, 1898.
SAN FRANCISCO
IS THREATENED
Dr. Chapman Wishes It to
Follow Riverside's
Example.
Liquor Dealers May Find It
Advisable to Send Him to
Europe.
The Evangelist Is Evidently Not
Innocent of Political
Methods.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. April 19.
Dr. E. S. Chapman, who recently re
signed from ministerial work to lead the j
campaign of temperance and prohibition
in California, must have struck terror
into the ranks of the Liquor Dealers' As
sociation in all parts of the State.
If the doctor, who was always popular
in this city, is capable of doing what Is
credited to him in Riverside, he would be
a good man for the anti-temperance peo
ple to subsidize so that he might pass the |
rest of his days in Europe.
In Riverside recently there was a great
campaign. The little town was wrought
up over the question of prohibition. When
matters appeared to be wavering Dr.
Chapman was sent for, and after four ad
dresses his mission was so complete that
Riverside voted for prohibition, and now
it is impossible to obtain within its bor
ders anything more opposed to public
morals than cold tea and iced lemonade.
A report has been received from River
side in which Dr. Chapman is given near
ly all the credit for carrying the temper
ance question at the polls. His addresses,
his dodgers, his eloquence, his versatility,
his methods of canvassing, are all praised
to the skies, and part of the report, unin
tentionally, no doubt, shows that the af
fable doctor is considerable of a politi
cian. It says: "He knew how to reach
after votes and get them: he was wise
enough never to say one thing that would
cost the cause a single vote. For one
night the city band was engaged. All the
ladies were pressed into service," and the
victory was so overwhelming that 846
votes were cast for prohibition and only
469 in favor of licensing the liquor traffic.
Dr. Chapman has been closeted in his
study for the past three days, and Is care
fully laying out a plan of campaign which
he hopes will succeed in securing prohibi
tion for San Francisco. A year ago an or
ganized attempt, commenced rather late,
it is true, was made to bring Oakland into
the temperance columns, but although the
city Is so generously studded with spires
it was unsuccessful, and in fact many
consider this midnight-closing town a
hopeless case. Dr. Chapman, however, is
very much encouraged, and what can be
done at Riverside he believes can be done
elsewhere.
WOODWARD WAS ABSENT.
His Vote Will Be Necessary to Defeat
the Public Interest Again.
OAKLAND, April 19.â The City Council
refused to give Health Officer Dunn an
additional $25 for a horse and bugrgy. His
salary is $150 per month, and the Finance
Committee recommended the addition,
but by the absence of the chairman, Mr.
Woodward, the .measure was lost by a
vote of 5 to 5. The "solid six" can pass
it when Mr. Woodward is present, so
President Heltmann rereferred it to the
committee.
A motion to deny the petition of J. P.
Beckett to sewer Thirty-seventh street,
between Market and West, by private
contract met a like fate. Councilman
Girard declared tnat "the contractors are
in 'cahoots' with some of the Council
men, who sometimes pet a slice of the
spoils. Some of the contractors have
come to me and wanted me to Insist upon
public contracts."
Other members thought that private
work was not as well done as public work
and opposed any private contracts. They
claimed that individuals circulating; a pe
tition for private work were given theirs
at cost at the expense of others.
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLHOUSES.
Board of Education May Erect New
Ones Soon.
OAKLAND, April 19.â Director Myra
Knox wants the surplus $15,000 in the
school fund for new buildings for the in
dustrial school. "We are behind the
times in this respect," said she. "The
children are eager to learn and are doing
really wonderful work. The public does
not appreciate the work, but I tell you the
time will come when people will wake up
to its advantage. We need new buildings
and we need this extra money for it."

HOPPE DROPPED DEAD.
Sudden Death of a Well-Known Resi-
dent of Claremont.
OAKLAND, April 19.â sudden death
of John C. Hoppe last night at his home
in Claremont has cast a gloom in a large
circle of his acauaintances. He was a
member of the firm of Brigham, Hoppe &
Co. 129-131 California street, San Fran
cisco M Last evening he left his office at 5
o'clock and came home. Apparently he
was enjoying good health. . About \ 9
o'clock he was taken with a severe pain
in the heart and died in a few foments. .
For some time he has suffered from his
heart. Dr. J. C. Rowell of Berkeley was
consulted and made his last call late last
evening. He did not find Mr. Hoppe at all
in need of a physician, as far as he was
able to ascertain.
The deceased leaves a widow, a marriel
daughter and two sons, one of whom is
married.

ban of the student body. The resolutions
w.ere carried by a vote of ISS to %.
How the faculty will regard the action
of the students remains to be seen. After j
the Associated Students passed resolu- ;
tions last year prohibiting rushing of i
e\'ery kind, the faculty voiced its approval
and announced Us determination to en
force the students' resolutions. The stu- i
dents who favor the rushing are anxious
ly waiting to see whether the faculty will

A PICKPOCKET SENTENCED.
He Said He Stole a Purse for Fun,
but It Cost Him Six Months
in Jail.
ALAMEDA, April 19.â Ben Meredith j
and Otto Bahrs, blacksmiths, went on a
spree last night, in the course of which
Bahrs stole a purse containing about $10 :
from his companion's pocket. He took
the money out and threw the purse away.
As soon "as Meredith discovered his loss i
he called on an officer and had Bahrs ar- i
rested. This morning when the case came !
before Justice Morris, Bahrs did not deny
taking the money, but said he only did it
in fun. But when asked by the judge
Why he threw the purse away, he could
give no reply and thereupon pleaded
guilty. He was then sentenced to six i
months' imprisonment in the County Jail. \

Alameda News Notes.
ALAMEDA. April 19.â The Native Sons
of this and other cities had a grand time
last night conferring the Nincompoop de
gree upon a new member. The affair
closed with a banquet.
It transpires that the reduction of in
surance rates given by the compact on
the school buildings of this city was not
gratuitous, but was forced by the low
rates offered by non-compact companies.
At llrst it was endeavored to be imposed
upon the public as an example of gener
osity.
Several applications for admission to
Company G have been received, and if
called upon for service it is expected that
the full strength of the company will be
readily obtained.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Sale of the Property of
Behrend and Fabian
J oost
Situated in the Mission and
University ( Home
stead.
Recent Salesâ A View of the Records,
Auctions and Random
Notes.
The real estate market, which has been
I for the past two weeks in a state of in
action, owing to the war excitement, took
a decided boom last week and recorded
one of the largest transfer deals made in
the city for years.
The entire property of Behrend and
i Fabian Joost and others, constating in
' all of forty-two parcels of land in theMis
| sion and University Extension homestead,
; was bid in at commissioners' sale by
I Nicholas and Henry Ohlandt and John
: A. Buck. The property sold for $203,136 64.
This was on a transaction of both real
and personal property amounting to $239,
: G95 64. The indebtedness was for moneys
advanced, secured by two deedsÂ»of trust,
and covered by a subsequent agreement
between the parties. Full judgment for
$335,935 46 was given in October last, with
interest at 7 per cent. Since then, how
ever, there have been a few redemptions;
and the deficiency judgment now amounts
to $116,734 89, on which CTie interest is still
i being paid. The German Bank receives
â  $20,000 from the sale on a lien not included
In the Ohlandt and Buck judgment.
Cattle men throughout the State are
'â  leasing swamp and overflowed lands
wherever possible. The rent paid for
such land averages 50 cents an acre. In
some instances, however, where the land
was found to be better than the ordinary,
I as much as $1, $2 and $3 has been paid.
! Tracts on Venice Island, on the San Joa
quin, where Wiiiiam Ede has rented 876
! acres through L. G. Harvey to dairymen
at 50 cents an acre, are almost entirely
submerged by water. It is the first time
in twenty-five years that the land has
been made available. The firm of Miller
& Lux has leased 20,000 acres of swamp
land for its cattle through McAfee
Brothers, and 10,000 through other bro
kers. In addition to this land the same
firm and many other Btockmen from the
southern and central portion of the State
are still endeavoring to secure additional
pasturage for their cattle, and sheep men
are renting mountainous land in all parts
of the State for their flocks.

LANDED IN
PRISON WITH
HIS BOOTY
William Burroughs,
an Opium Fiend,
Under Arrest.
Was Captured in Oakland
After an Exciting
Chase.
Accused of Entering Several
Houses in the Western
Addition.
EVIDENCE OF HIS GUILT.
The Police Ara Jubilant Â«nd It Is
Proposed to Have a Speedy
Trial.
The police are more than jubilant. For
days, weeks and even months detectives
have been anxiously working to locate
the chief agent in certain burglaries, hold
ups and even highway robberies, and It
Is thought that the desperate character
is at last behind the bars of the City
Prison, or rather confined In the ranks,
where desperate men are usually detained.
Last evening William Burroughs was
taken into the office of the Chief of Police
with handcuffs on his hands, as those in
charge of the prisoner were well aware
of the desperate character of their pris
oner.
For two or more flays the sleuths have
been on the track of the man charged
with many crimes, and yesterday after
noon he was followed to Oakland. After
the arrested man had been followed
throughout the city for a few hours he
was told to surrender, and he was man
acled after a rather desperate struggle.
No trouble was Experienced while cross
ing the bay, and' when searched at the
office of the Chief of Police many articles
of value, including some rare jewelry,
were taken from Burroughs and locked
up in the safe.
The man who was arrested tells a pitiful
tale of poverty and craving for morphine,
and states that while he has attempted
to resist temptation to take what did
not belong to him. he has been led on to
commit wrongful acts through his desire
to obtain the coveted drug.
He, presented a pitiful sight, as he
seemed aware of the fact that his line
had been drawn to a conclusion.
The police are well satisfied with the
arrest and are confident that thej have
arrested the criminal who had caused
them so much worry during the past few
norths.
The arrested man is wpl l known by
many druggists in the city, who are ;
aware of the criminal's condition, and
many of them state that he would not j
hesitate to murder to gain h;s end. "When
the Chief's office was visited it was at !
first supposed that a "dope"' fiond had
been arrested <>n a technicality, but as !
the history of the man was told those J
In charge of the office secretly stowed
the prisoner away in the tanks and will
await a trial to bring out the full extent j
of crimes perpetrated by Burroughs.
Haggard, pale, yet full of determination j
and desire, Burroughs was locked away, i
but repeatedly asked for morphine and
stated that he would again take a chance
of arrest to gain but one single dose nf
morphine, which is slowly taking his !
life away. For many days the police
have been carefully watching him, and it
is supposed he was about to leave the i
State when arrested.
GENERAL DUGGAN
FOUND GUILTY
He Is Convicted by a Jury in
Judge Wallace's
Court.
Little Alice Loy Tells a Revolting
Story on the Witness
Stand.
George Spurgeon Duggan, the man who
posed as general of a so-called religious
organization and the story of whose crim
inal and vicious connections with Alice
Loy, an innocent child but 7 years of age,
was first told in The Call of March 5, was
yesterday morning convicted in Judge
Wallace'? court of the crime of felonous
assault.
The story of Duggan's actions which
was brought out in the Police Court trial
was so vile, so reeking with all that is
vulgar and demoralizing, that even the
doors of the Police Court, where nothing
elevating Is ever seen or heard, were
closed against the morbidly curious mob
which, ever alert for that which Is sensa
tional, surged against its doors.
Little Alice was placed on the stand,
and In her simple, childish way told her
story, scarcely realizing the enormity of
the crimes with which she was charging
the man who pretended to lead a band
the very name of which stood for all that
was good and elevating. How this army
was nothing but an organization of un
principled men and women living on the
sham of the religion which they dis
graced; how the very leader of the band,
on Christmas dayâ that great day of all
days In the Christian yearâ had taken
her into a house on Grant avenue and in
her childish ignorance and innocence most
cruelly wronged her. The whole revolt
ing story, or at least as much of it as is
fit for publication, has already been told
in these columns, and the child's story
was but a verification of the facts al
ready made public.
The innocent, childish story was so con
vincing that after a short deliberation
the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and
the man who has been convicted of' being
a human monster of the vilest kind will
shortly come up for the sentence and be
forced to pay the penalty for the crime
he so artfully sought to hide under the
guis<> of religious fanaticism. The child
has already been placed in the care of
competent persons, who will do all In
their power to obliterate any trace of the
seeds of evil implanted in her by the
self-styled leader of the Army of Jesus
Christ.
IN HONOR OF BUNKER HILL.
Arrangements Made to Celebrate the
One Hundred and Twenty-third
Anniversary of the Battle.
Joint executive committees from the
"Runker Hill Association," "Sons of
Vermont" and "Sons of the American
Revolution" met last evening In the
Occidental Hotel for the purpose of
making arrangements for the cele
bration of the 123 rd anniversary of the
battle of Bunker Hill. Committees were
appointed and it was decided to hold
the celebration on June 17 at Los Gatos.
Those present were: \V. Q. Badger,
chairman; G. W. Caswell, secretary ; S.
G. Chever, assistant secretary; Judge E.
A. Belcher, A. O. Col ton, George Par
tridge. Dr. 8. H. Roberts, U A. Hay
wards, A. O. Perkins. M. T. Ellinwood,
William Mullner, H. Baker, William
Metener, H. YV. Clark, Henry Bulen, F.
Anthes, A. F. Whalton, G. W. Kuehn and
Robert Vandercook.
Invitations have been sent to the prin
cipal patriotic organizations of the coast
risking thorn to tnko part in the celebra
tion, find it If thought by those who have
the affnJr unilor way that the celebration
will excel any attempt heretofore made.
Strike of the Printers.
There Is practically no change in the |
eituation of the striking printers. The
strike committee sees all kinds of vie- j
tories in the near future, while the Typo- j
thetae claims that there is no strike onâ |
at least so far as ita members are con- |
cerned. Whenever a member of the
Typothetae is interviewed he says that
so far as he Is concerned there Is no
strike; the offices are funning and the
work is being turned out the same as
usual. The printers tell stories of work
and machinery being spoiled by the in
competent men and these stories are as
promptly denied by the employers. The
union men claim that the strike will be
ended within a very short time and the
employers claim that it cannot be ended
BO far* as they are concerned, as they re- 'â 
fuse to longer recognize the men who j
were formerly in their employ. Organ-
Iver Galvin has appointed eight deputies
from among the local men to help in car
rying on the fight and Deputy Organizer
Rogers has arrived from Sacramento and
will lend his assistance in the aggressive
campaign.
Republicans Organize.
A Republican club was organized at
Ocean View last night. There was a large
and enthusiastic attendance and the fol
lowing officers were elected: President,
N. F. Taylor; vice-president, C. P. Rob
bins; secretary Thomas Johnson; treas
urer, A. E. Holloway; sergeant at arms,
Joseph Thompson; enrollment committee
â S. Alexander, George Sanger, W. Wolf:
executive committee â James Gray, Fred
Gehring, A. J. Crawford, A. Desdan, Ed
Craven, James Irwin, Thomas Qulnn,
John Lord, C. F. Jordan.
The meeting adjourned after three
cheers for the party to assemble again
at the call of the chairman.

MELBA MAKES HER BOW
LAST night at the California Thea
ter the short season of Italian
opera was commenced with a per
formance of Verdi's "La Travt
ata," in which Melba lived up to the
glory of her name, and at which San
Francisco lived up to the glory cf her
traditions. In fact, the town started a
nice new set of traditions, of which it
has stood in sore need these many
years, during which the old ones lost
their bloom and circumstance in the
shuffle. I feel more than ever con
vinced that we need only a few such
inducements as Melba to get the name
of being the most reckless town of the
atrical spendthrifts on the map, in
stead cf the low-spirited, impecunious
growlers we are now held to be by the
metropolitan managers who have failed
to touch our treasure with second-rate
and second-hand attractions. If Melba
was a success last night â and she was
to the last limit to every one there who
knew just what to expect and how
much â so was Pan Francisco. The
cr. '\vd made n<> moan over the seven
dollar schedule of -prices: it packed the
small theater from orchestra rail to the
last inch of sardine space in the gal
lery; it was something like 2500 strong,
and the box i fflce receipts were exactly
$7800. Ban Francisco cheerfully paid
the price of nut having an opera
house.
Every woman knows that her gowns,
jewels "and other personal scenery and
ts stand less chance of being seen
In the California than in any of the
theaters here. The "inline of the audi
torium, the rise of the main lloor. the
very crowded uncomfortableness of the
seats themselves, all conspire to make
"dressing low" an ungrateful invest
ment. So it is only just to attribute the
:ity of Parisian gowns and priceless
gems i" the theater rather than to the
prices and the times. And I am sure
that no one of sound judgment in these
little matters of elegance paid the
slightest attention to the gossips who
whispered it around the lobby that the
fabulous price of seats had knocked
diamonds out of fashion for several
months to come, and that more mort
gages had been recorded in the last
week than in any other of local record.
This was a base canard, set afloat by
jestful tongues. It is true that
most of the crowd came in cable cars,
that fierce tiaras of diamonds did
not smite the eye at every glance; but
there was a modest string of carriages
along the curb, a necklace or two and
quite a myriad of bracelets, and many
belated earbobs and no end of rhine
hair fixtures burning warmly in
the half lierht of the theater.
And in point of deportment the au
dience struck me as admirably at good
will with Itself and the art it listened
to. It was ;in audience calm, comely
and distinguished, sure of what it liked
and ever, surer of what it didn't: it
applauded at the little applauding sta
tions which Verdi so carefully marked
off in his most ingeniously undramatic
opera, and on several occasions the up
per part of it shouted with an enthusi
asm that was justifiable and splendid
to hear. But I would better leave the
audience to a more capable pen and
get down to the business of the per
formance.
We have heard â 'Traviata" all the
way from Patti to the Tivoli; it is an
old pong. Dramatically it is always
a.n atrocious mutilation of a good play;
musically it is still a gush of good
natured Italian melody, punctuated by
dyspeptic recitatives. The melody of it
is clear, rippling and insistent. As in
everything that Verdi has touched, the
melodic inspiration is beyond question.
But these very tunes, pretty and amia
ble as they are. with theirdainty flut
ings and embroideries, are just the sort
that do not illustrate the story "f
Camilleâ they distort, grotesque it.
There is not one tear of real emotion in
the whole opera. In fact, poor Cam'.lle
is taken not only out of her century
and tongue, but out of her color and
senses as well.
It is "nly when a great singer, a Patti
or a Melba, lifts these incongruities on
the top of her voice and makes every
thing subsidiary to the spell of tone and
WRECKED IN A
DEAD CALM
Two Vess.els Drift To
gether Off Black
Point.
The Garfield and Inveran
say Meet in Mid-
Stream.
In the calm vratorfl of the ba/ last
night two vessels drifted together and
narrowly escaped becoming a total
loss under circumstances so unusual as
to be cause for comment.
Thp schooner James A. Garfleld, Cap
tain Franke, was coming in on the flood
tide with a light wind. When off Black
Point she was suddenly becalmed, ren
dering the rudder useless. Despite all
efforts she began drifting and soon ran
afoul of the British bark Inveransay.
Tlie two vessels struck with that hor
rible rasping sound which strikes ter
ror to the hearts of the most seasoned
mariners, and in a few minutes both
were badly wrecked.
The Garfleld lost her jibboom and
fore rigging and the starboard cathead
was completely carried away, besides
which considerable damage was done
to her decks and starboard sides. The
Inveransay had her main and fore rig
ging carried away, lost her starboard
light and considerable damage was
done on her decks. A boat 23 feet long
which she carried on her decks was
ground to pieces, and not a trace of It
could be found after the two vessels
were separated.
This was Captain Frank's first voy
age as master of a schooner and he
feels very sore over the accident, al
though, owing to the peculiar circum
stances, it is thought little or no blame
can be attached to him. The vessel was
becalmed and totally at the mercy of
the tides. The Garfield was four and a
half days out from Grays Harbor, and
carried a cargo of lumber consigned to
the Simpson Lumber Company of this
city.
The Inveransay arrived from New
castle on March 15 with a cargo of coal

technique, that "Traviata" becomes of
artistic value. Last night Melba reim
mortalized it. You felt that it was a
piece written to sound the perfections
of her perfect vocal instrument. Cer
tainly Melba can sins greater parts
than Violetta, parts wherein are vital
music and strenuous dramatic unities;
but I doubt if there is one other in all
opera that tempts the spontaneity, lis-
Bomeness and polish of her voealism to
a finer triumph. Once free your mind
of the idea that Violetta is Camille,
that "Traviata" bears any relationship
to one of the strongest emotional
dramas that ever came out of France,
and Melba gives to this fantastic part
an identity that is absolutely unforget
able.
The company with which Messrs.
Damrosch and Ellis have s rrounded
Melba is neither more nor less than I
anticipated in touching on the season
last Sunday. Bimboni, with a good
band of thirty-eight, proved himself
an admirable leader, sure and magnet
ic without being in the least tempes
tuous, and directing with quiet author
ity and remarkable refinement.
The chorus seems to have been re
cruited here, if I am any placer of facfÂ«,
and it did its unexacting work very de
cently. And the scenery is not making
its first appearance at the California.
Campana.ri was almost an ideal Ger
mont. His barytone is warm, true, and
his tone beautifully round except for a
few slight affectations.
Salignac turned out to be no* much
a bad Alfredo after all. He wore his
clothes with difficulty and dodged the
key now and then, but on the whole he
was a very comfortable if not entirely
worthy tenor.
However, it was not the company
but Melba that the town went to hear;
Galvahuamo with a load of grain. The
accident will prevent her sailing, and it
will be some time before the damage
can be repaired.
SOLDIERS WILL ENTERTAIN.
A Military Exhibition That Will
Serve a Patriotic Purpose.
The entertainment to be given by the
First Infantry. National Guard, at the
Mechanics' Pavilion next Friday evening
will be a thorough demonstration of
actual soldiering. It will be a strictly
military exhibition, with musical and
dancing features added, and the local
soldiers will surprise the public by their
efficiency in drill, maneuvers, etc. The
twelve companies comprising the regi
m?. nt -,'^ ve boen Practicing for weeks, and
fully 1000 carefully drilled men will partic
ipate. There will be interesting features
aside from the main - display, and the
ladies will be given an opportunity of
witnessing the process of preparing a
camp meal. It will be a novel and most
interesting as well as instructive, exhi
bition, the like of which has never been
seen in this city. The admission price is
2o cents.

and the performance from beginning
to end was her personal victory.
I can recall but one episode in her
singing which was not wholly satis
fying, and that was in the "fors c
lvi," where hef voice Bounded clouded
almost to dullness, but she recovered
herself in the recitative that follows
and traced the fancy work of the
"Seinpro Libre" with untarnished
sparkle and unimpeachable execution.
From then on through the second act,
with the most fragile mezzo voice to
the passionate duet with Alfredo and
the closing trio, and then the "Addlo"
and the Trovatore-like duet of the
last act and the final death seene â to
recount these in detail would be. one
long catalogue of praise.

CELTS TO HOLD
A BIG FAIR
Extensive Plans for Rais-
ing Funds to Erect
an Irish Hall.
Industries Peculiar to the Green
Isle to Be Attractively
Illustrated.
There was a large and enthusiastic
meeting of the Celtic Union, which is a
federation of the Irish societies of this
city, at K. --. B. Hall last evening.
Jeremiah Deasy, president of the ex
ecutive committee, presided in the ab
sence of the president of the union,
Colonel Barry. Routine business was
quickly disposed of so that the dele
gates could hear proposals as to the
contemplated Irish Fair. An Irish Fair
has been under discussion for a year
or more and the success of the fairs
held in Chicago and New York greatly
encouraged those in favor of the plan
here.
The object of the fair is to obtain
funds or rather a good working basis
for an Irish hall in this city.
Mr. Buckley, who has so successfully
1 managed similar enterprises in various
| cities in the East and on this coast, laid
his plans before the union. As a neces
sary preliminary it was decided by the
union to hold a fair in the fall. As an
other necessary preliminary an amount
of money on hand, estimated at about
$1000, was called for. A gentleman pres-
I ent said he was so sure of the success
Jof the undertaking that he was pre-
I pared to advance the necessary amount.
It was decided to begin work at once,
; and accordingly correspondence will be
i at once entered into with those having
I charge of the Chicago Irish exhibits
and with people in Irel'.nd, so that
there will be a very complete exhibit.
The Pavflion will be at once engaged.
Mr. Buckley was engaged as i...ui
ager, and the following executive com
mittee, with full power to act, was ap
pointed:
Colonel Thomas F. Barry, ex-officio;
Jeremiah Deasy. John I.lulhern, Mrs.
H. Mulverhill, C. B. Flanagan, J. H.
McGinney. The committee will meet
next Thursday to begin work. The fair
will last about a month and it is ex
pected that it will be very successful
less laces, no fabulous jewels, no gor
geous gowns.
A few welcomed the great singer in
attire of rustling silk or glimmering
satin, but the majority had its Sun
day best on with an added frill or
Jewel as a sort of concession to the
great event.
The California is not a house that,
managerially speaking, "dresses pretti
ly." Gowns must be more than gor
geous, jewels more than ordinarily
brilliant, to make a showing at the
Hush-street house.
The "fringe" that lined the auditori
um and filled the lobby to overflowing
loomed up beautifully. Lines of swal
low tails and gorgeous shirt fronts
leaned gracefully down either side of
the house, which was dotted here and
there with an enduring music, lover in
handsome toilette and fetching Easter
bonnet.
The dressing was not governed by
seat location. Way down to the front,
within an arm's length of Bimboni's
baton, the tailor-made girl enjoyed the
songstress' dulcet tones, brushing her
well -starched cuffs against the fair
arms and gleaming shoulders of a vi
sion in pink tulle. Even the sailor hat
was present and bobbed with enthusi
asm to the measures in Verdi's Travi
ata.
The same diversity of toilette pre
vail. â <! in the upper realms of the house.
In tho gallery, side by side with the
outing suit, the dainty silk grown and
fluffy chiffon corsage met on equal
terms in the common love of art and
music.
As with the dressing, so with the ap
plause. Smashing all traditions, the
gailery ]od not in the inspiring greet
ing to the singers, but palm met palm
in delightful discord intermittently and
and a large amount will be realized for
the Irish hall.
KNIGHTS AND LADIES.
Session of the Grand Lodge of Cali
forniaâGrand Officers Are to
Be Elected To-Day.
The first meeting nf the eleventh an
nual session of the Grand Lodge of the
Knights nnd Ladles of Honor was hHd
yesterday in Pythian Castle., Grand Pro
tector Mrs. Belle W. Conrad in the
chair.
Tho reports of the grand officers were
presented and referred, after the com
mittee on credentials had certified to
those entitled to scats.
In her r port the grand protector stated
that while the -order in this State had
not made any remarkable advance dur
ing the year it had not retrograded, and
that financially it was in better condi
tion than at the previous session. In her
report she also stated that Berkeley and
Seal Rook lodges had surrendered their
charters and that the secretary of the
last named lodge had departed for the
East, leaving the affairs of the lodge in
a deplorable condition, the minutes not
having been written up and there being
a deficiency In his cash account; but that
nothing could be done as he was not un
der bonds, as the lodge should have re
quired biin to be.
The time of the afternoon was taken
up In tho discussion of the reports. At
11 o'clock this morning the election of
grand officers will be held. For the of
fice of grand protector .there will be three
candidatesâ}}, c. Traphagen, Mrs. L. J.
Wheeloek and Z. T. Whltton, and for
gra^d secretary, vice S. I?. Carleton, who
will tender his resignation, there will
also lie three candidates" Mrs. A. Graff,
H. W. Quitzow and A. Gompertz.
On Monday night the delegates were
entertained by Aurora Lodge and last
night they were entertained by West End
Lodge.
During the day the Grand Lodge re
ceived a telegram of congratulation from
Supreme l'rotector L. B. Loekha.rd.
Tho supreme protector contemplates
moving his headquarters from Bradford,
Pa., to Toledo. Ohio, and after the Ist of
May the publication of the Sentinel, the
official organ of the order, will be in the
vicinity of Chicago instead of San Fran
cisco.
Death of Dr. Bappin.
Dr. G. F. Rappin, who died in this city
on the ISth inst. at his residence, was
one of the oldest physicians in this
city, having been in active practice for
over thirty years. He was charitably in
clined and for years had practiced his
profession without a great deal of com
pensation. He leaves a family which is
highly respected by a large number of
friends and acquaintances.

The only relic of a Pattl night was
the crowd that gathered round the
theater entrance and held its breath
supplied with an unlimited number of
"ohs" and "ahs" for the beauty of the
gowns, the elegance of the opera wraps
and the glitter of the jewels.
That there was not much elegance to
gape at apparently disturbed it not,
and each bang of a carriage door sent
the eager crowd into convulsions of
admiration.

Clarke.
Was Never a Super and Has
Only Managed One Cheap
Show Up to Date.
One Way of Getting Stage Parapher
nalia Over the Road With Little
Expense to the Management
If the man who wrote "What Happened
to Jones" would take a week oft and tell
what happened to the man who told what
happened to Jones he would turn out a
comedy that would be replete with ridicu
lous complications and confusing situa
tions.
It is now over a month since the first
one of Clarke's great aggregation of
planitary attractions drifted into the city
and told her tale of woe, and ever since
there have been periodical roasts of the
eccentric manager by different members
of his once-famoua company as they have
arrived in the city from parts where the
grass was shorter. These interesting and
instructive articles, whenever they have
met the eye s^f Clarke, have been vigor
ously replied to, and so the war has gone
on, first one side obtaining the advantage
and then the other:
The following letter, which is self-ex
planatory, is the latest thing that has oc
curred in the situation:
SAN FRANCISCO, April IS. 1S?8.
City Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: Mr.
Clarke <coimm)etllan> states In this morning's
Call that I (.his manager) was suner for Mr.
Krawlt-y. 1 wish U< say that I was never in
Mr. Frowley'i employ, and that I haven't even
a personal acquaintance with Mr. Frawley. I
have been a manager for the Kmhraans pre
vious to my unfortunate alliance with Clarke,
and his is the first cheap show with which I
was ever Identified. "Charlie's Aunt," "Jane,"
etc., represent the character of the shows I
have been with.
The real "meat" of Clarke's starring failure
has not been published yet. For genuine sen
sations (criminal libel suits, etc.) it can't be
beaten, as any member of Clarke's company,
except Charles Charters, who wai discharged
for drunkenness and reinstated and is conse
quently silenced, will toll you. Mr. Clarke
made the members ft his company pay their
own fares from Salt Lake to San Francisco,
shrewdly got their tickets into his hands and
checked his excess baggageâ scenery, etc. â into
Frisco on their tickets nealnst their remon-
Btsances. You may quote me unreservedly for
this statement. I intend to sue Clarke for my
fare. R. BEERS LOOS.
Late Manager of the late Harry Corson Clarke.

WILL DANCE THE
STATELY MINUET
Mount Moriah Lodge's Colo
nial Booth at the Masonic
Fair.
A Porcelain Exhibit â The Mission
District â The Floral Arrange
ments.
One of the most interesting of the
booths which will he seen at the big festi
val in the Mechanics' Pavilion next month
promises to be that of which the hi lies,
wives and daughters of the members of
Mount Moriah Lodge will have chaise.
In decoration it is proposed to have it <-n
tiniy in the style of '76, and the costim.es
of the ladies will be distinctly colonial. In
keeping with this novel idea during festi
val week the minuet will be danced in the
fancy dress of that period nightly. An
other quite novel thing being done by the
relatives and friends of the members of
Mount Moriah Lodge is the making of a
number of handsome sofa pillows, the
coverings being artistic arrangements of
the various souvenir badges for the fete.
As the material is all silk and of varie
gated color and design, one ca.n imagine
h.iw very easily particular patterns may
be worked charmingly.
Offer has been made by a firm of photo
graphers to tit up a magnificent booth for
the. purpose of showing the latest de
velopment in porcelain work. The process
produces a photograph which it is claimca
is really the only permanent reproduction
of life that is possible. It seems to be
wonderfully clear, too. and the matter is
now under consideration by the executive
committee and may possibly be adopted.
The Mission district of the city is now
coming more enthusiastically to the aid
of the fete than ever before. Meetings
are being held regularly at the new Ma
sonic building, and on Tuesday afternoon
Mission Chapter. O. E. S., had a most en
couraging report to make.
The floral arrangements are scarcely
completed yet, although Mrs. W. Frank
Pierce, who is chairman of the booths
committee, wishes it understood that not
too many can possibly be offered. It is
proposed that fresh flowers, ferns and
palms shall be seen in the Pavilion every
night.
A LITERARY AFTERNOON.
Mrs. Steele Will Discourse on the
Great Pyramid.
The many friends of Mrs. William An
drew of 64(5 Fell street will have the rare
enjoyment of a literary afternoon with
Mrs. Esther B. Steele of Elmira, N. V., on
Friday afternoon next.
Mrs. Steele is a woman of -wide experi
ence and a well-known litterateur. She is
the author of a well-known work on as
tronomy, and several of her works are
now used as text books in the public
schools and other institutions of learning.
The subject of Friday's discussion is "In
the Kinp"s Chamber of the Groat Pyra
mid," and Mrs. Steele is familiar with
this, not only from study but direct per
sonal investigation. Tin" event is one of
those rare ones in society which combines
amusement with a distinct broadening of
the intellectual *<â¢"[>>â .
