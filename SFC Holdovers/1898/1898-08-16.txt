VOLUME LXXXIV.-ISO 77.
MAGUIRE HAS IT ALL HIS OWN WAY.
On the Eve of the Democratic
Convention He Has No
Real Opposition.
Senator Seawell Is Still in the Race, but
Announces That He Is Prepared for
the Inevitable.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 15.â This has
been a day of false alarms, flest'ng
rumors and a general feeling of dis
comfort sprinkled here and there with
an occasional <la^h of practical poli
ticsâ the latter being furnished by a
few of the old-time Democrats who
â were attending State conventions when
General Ju Hamilton was a curly
"headed youth and the na ne of fusion
was unknown to politicaJ literature.
But even the old timers are forced
to admit that there is something in
the present gathering of 1
.delegates that is entirely new to them.
They are Baying that the false-alarms
are being provided by false alarms"â
meaning the - w h" axe com
paratively new to the political game
but after they ha I their fling they are
admit reluctantly enough
that with all their wisdom and all their
lence they are as much at sea
â line: th>- situation as the veriest
- â  at the political same.
There is here th^ customary congre
gates, the usual throng
in and about the Golden Eagle Hotel,
the groups on the street corners and
the ordinary seekers aftt-r the secrets
of others; but there, that is all. There
is apparently no interest taken in the
question of who- is to be nominated
â for the various offices on the State tick
- et, and. what is still more unusual in
.-a- Democratic gathering, tiWfe are
.-places that are groins begging fir want
" .of men to fill them. This apathy
â  - : even applies to the head of the tVcket,
for there are not two score of <^le
. gates here who have even the s^s
.: picion of an idea that the place wXI
'go to any one other than James G\
; ilaguire. '
\ The way has been prepared for him.
./â¢lie has been tendered the honor of the
.place at the head of the ticket of the
â¢inferior half of what was once a proud
party and all that has been left for
the representatives of the Democratic
; party of the State of California to do
-Is to ratify the nomination.
Having a duty to perform the afore-
-sail! representatives have come hither
to go through the formality of affixing
; the seal of their political approval on
.. the certificate of Maguire's nomination
'']Â»>'. the Populist party. Such a task
.lacks the element of excitement, and so
" they have been forced to seek else
â : where for the nerve stimulus that
; makes glad the heart of the youthful
'â¢; 'politician.
â  ..They have scanned the list of State
: officers and have found set onDosite
';: the pome dozen or less of choicer
'â â ;â  places, names unknown in the world of
; .Democrai . , qually uncared for
'â¢â save perhaps by the heretofore obscure
.. earners of thi H,. n . and there.
'Ua true, appears the name of some one
who in times past had endeared him
self to the hearts of his constituents
. and tÂ»e world ai large by heaping op
probrium oh the headH of al^Demo
. crats. It having been decreed, how
â  t-\vr, that these men with the others
should receive the Indorsement of this
Democratic gathering they will all pass
up with a Kitfh of regret and a feeling
not always openly expressed that per
haps the Democratic party was not
Buch a great organization after all.
But Providence and the will of the
Pinto-Populist convention decreed
that a few of the officers should be left
int. Here and then- a few aspi
rants bolder than their fellows have
t d up with the announcement that
ar*> seeking one or another of the
vacant places. This was no doubt in
teresting to themselves and perhaps a
few of their friends, but it does not
seem to interest the great mass of dele
gau-a who have assembled here to fln
The San Francisco Call
ish the work bo well begun by their
distic brethren, and it is right here
that the old timera meet -svith the sur
prise already referred to. To them it
splicable that a Democrat
who has once held office should not
thereafter for all times seek for it
madly.
General Jo Hamilton, the old "war
.'â  explains this feeling by relating
an anecdote at his own expense.
'â When I was a boy." he said. "I
was treated to frequent dissertations
by my parents on the subject of the
evils of strong drink. I accepted their
teachings in good faith until one day in
an upstairs room devoted exclusively
to my father's use I stumbled across a
ftask of old bourbon. To Bee was to
drink, but alas for me my father sur
prised me in the act. He hesitated not
to remonstrate with me, and being a
vigorous old man he punctuated his re
marks with a very stout cane. Be
tween screams I caught the voice of my
mother in the hall below shouting 'Swat
it to him. dad; if he ever gets a taste
of it the fool will never know when to
quit.' "
The only thing that has up to this
time formed a topic of general interest
is the contemplated contest for supre
macy between the Harney delegation
and that other San Francisco delega
tion, which was brought into existence
by the so-called Committee of One
Hundred, appointed by Chairman Al
ford of the State Ontral Committee.
Frank H. Gould, late of Btoekton,
"Whispering" Gavin McNab and their
coterie of dyed-in-the-wool reformers.
Having no other cares to worry them,
the country delegates, following the
lead of the State C-n'ral ( 'nmmtttee.
are occupying their mimls with the dis
sentions of the San Francisco Democ
racy.
That this contest is a bitter one is
not to be denied, and to-night all signs
point to a very lively time on the floor
of the convention hall when Chairman
Alford raps for order to-morrow after
noon.
Both sides are preparing for the
struggle, and even at this time, when
the time for the rap of the gavel is only
a few hours distant, the result is uncer
tain.
The Harney men are making a good
fight and are pulling every possible
string that will bring them a vote. They
claim that their cause is right and just,
and therefore should win, provided al
ways that the majority of the delegates
are the kind of men to whom right and
justice appear. The McNab forces, on
the other hand, are loud in their assur
ances that they have a majority of the
convention on their side, and point with
pride to the fact that the names of
the men in their delegation occupy a
prominent place in the temporary roll.
They, like the Harneyites, have a
strong following, but, strange to say,
these followers fix their reasons for
their faith upon' other grounds than
that of right and justice. Not all, but
some of them, admit, not without re
luctance, that it may be true that right
is upon the side of their opponents, but,
being politicians by right of birth, edu
cation and natural inclination, they
must first take into consideration the
[on of policy and expediency. Hav
ing done so, they find that policy and
expediency win first and second money,
and that right and justice "also ran."
. it goes, with the result still ob
i in the haze of the unforeseen
events of to-morrow and the day fol
lowing.
To-nighl the Harney forces received
valuable ..fercements from the cities
around the bay, and if all promises are
kept the scene of to-morrow's contest
: will be marked by the familiar forms
! and punctuated by the familiar war
cries of such oid-tirners as W. W. Foote,
: M. F. Tarpey, John Daggett, M. J. Lay-
I mance and others who in times past
have raised their voices to the con
fusion of their politieU opponents.
What the end will he no man can
say, but as has already been intimated,
>â  th<-n- is every prospeci ol the warmest
kind of a time for everybody, not to
mention the spectators in the rear of
the hall, who will assemble in antici
pation of a real old-fashioned Demo
cratic mix up.
Here and there is to be found a del
! egation from some of those smaller
counties that have come to Sacramento
i prepared to fight fusion to the death.
| They are earnest in their denunciation
! ol the arrangement by which certain
j self-appointed leaders of the strict
Democracy traded off the party patri
mony, but, unfortunately for them
selves and their constituents, they are
in a hopeless minority. Chief ;imong
these are the Sonoma and Mendocino
county delegations. Up that way they
; have had some experience with fusion
! and still retain a recollection of how
i George W. Monteith, Populist SYnd Âx .
! middle-of-the-roader, assisted the Dro .
| cession attending the entrance of Con
| gressman Barham into the legislative
| halls of the National Capital. They (] e _
I clare that they will never, so loijr as
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, AUGUST 16, 1898.
they are Democrats, become parties to
another such arrangement. They and
others â many others â most solemnly
declare that if the present fusion agree
ment is carried into effect by this con
vention they will go to the polls next
November and knife every Populist and
Silver Republican on the ticket until,
as one of the more emphatic stalwarts
expressed it, nothing but a shoestring
remains.
Something of the apathy that marks
the conduct of the few candidates wh<>
have up to this time displayed sufficient
energy to announce themselves is illus
trated by an incident that occurred or>
the train which arrived in Sacramento
last evening. Among the passengers
was Charles Edelman of Orange
County, candidate for State Treasurer.
Besides being a candidate Mr. Edelman
is a pleasant gentleman, and he had
no lack of company during the ride up
from the city. To those who were with
him he detailed his hopes and fears re
garding his candidacy and sought ad
vice and counsel from such friends as
he considered better acquainted with
the situation than himself. As the train
pulled into Sacramento one of his
friends in a burst of confidence inform
ed Mr. Edelmao that he. Edelman,
"was up against it." Not beintr
versed in slang the candidate received
the Information without comment, but
promised himself that at the first oppor
tunity he would consult a city friend
on the subject. This he did at the
breakfast table at the hotel this morn
ing. The following conversation is said
to have taken place:
"Tom, I heard a funny expression the
other day and 1 want to ask you what
it meant. I heard one fellow say to
another that he 'was up against it.'
What did he mean by that?"
"He meant." replied the friend, "that
he was confronted vÂ»ith a situation
from which he was bound to come out
loser."
"Well, the blankety blank blank,"
ejaculated Edelman, as he left the din
ing room precipitately, followed by the
amazed glances of his friend.
Whether or not Mr. Edelman Is "up
against it" will only be determined
when the vote is taken next* Thursday.
Those who profess to be well informed
declare that the incumbent. Will S.
Green, will be renominated for the po
sition of State Treasurer.
Railroad Commissioner La Rue. who
was at one time announced as a candi
date for the gubernatorial nomination,
has resigned himself to the inevitable
and now says that his name will not
be presented to the convention as an
aspirant to the place at the head of the
ticket. He expects, however, to receive
the nomination for Railroad Commis
sioner, and if so he will accept it. Being
a candidate, he declines to discuss the
fusion arrangement by which all pros
pective gubernatorial candidates were
shut out of the race without ever hav
ing an opportunity to submit their
names to the representatives of the
party. He says, however, that he does
not so much regret the loss of this op
portunity as he does the manner in
which the loss was brought about.
"I fear," he said, "like the man whose
wife had died of small-pox. He
mourned for her and was not to be
consoled. His friends finally ap
proached him and told him that it was
wrong to mourn and that there were
just as good women in the world as his
late wife had been. 'I know it,' he re
plied, 'but you are mistaken as to the
cause of my grief. I don't care so much
for the loss of Nancy, but it is the
blankety, blank, blank disease that she
died of that I am crying about.' "
This may not be complimentary to
the sensibilitVs of the gentlemen who
engineered the fusion arrangement, but
it is no doubt expressive of Mr. La
Rue's feelings.
With the San Francisco fight as an
example it may be that during the time
that will elapse before the convention
gets down to business of nominating
candidates some interest may be shown
in the contest that must necessarily
occur between those who are seeking
the few places that the Populists have
left for the Democrats to nil. At any
rate the proceedings will not lack in
terest, and those who have come to
Sacramento expecting to participate in
a real Democratic good time will not
be disappointed.

McNab When Called Down by
Lawyer Foote Crawfishes
Shamelessly.
Whispered Once Too Often, Was Called
a Liar and Meekly Swallowed
the Affront.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 15.â The other day on
Montgomery street, San Francisco,
Gavin McNab, on leaving a group of
men that had been discussing politics,
looked back over his shoulder and re
marked:
"W. W. Foote is going to Sacramento
to make John D. Spreckels 1 speech."
The remark was distinctly heard by
quite a number of bystanders, among
them M. F. Tarpey. The fact that the
remark was made and the insinuation
thrown out that Foote was wearing a
collar came to the latter's knowledge.
On the boat this afternoon coming from
San Francisco, Foote saw McNab edg
ing away in the crowd and immediately
called to him: "Here, McNab, I want
to speak to you. I understand that you
said publicly on the street that I wore
a collar and was going to Sacramento
to make John D. Spreckels' speech. I
want to tell you now that any man who
says I wear a collar is a d liar and
"You are right, Mr. Foote. but I did
not make use of the language reported
to you. I did not say that you wore
any man's collar," replied McNab.
"I understand from Mr. Tarpey that
i you did use such language, and his
presence I want you to deny it."
"If we have any differences we will
settle them on the floor of the conven
tion," continued McNab.
"This is a personal matter, and it is
not necessary to settle it on the floor
Âi the convention. It can be settleu
now, and T repeat that any man who
aaurtl that I wear a collar Is a liar."
McNab again Insisted that he did not
utter the remark ascribed to him, and
the Interview ended.
Mr. Foote remarked: "This ends the
matter until I can see you with Mr.
Tarpey."
After arriving here this evening, Mr.
Foote related to Mr. Tarpey the details
of the conversation with Mr. McNab on
Montgomery street.
Mr. Tarpey expressed surprise that a
denial of the Montgomery street remark
should have been made, and added:
"McNab said it in the presence of a
dozen people. He turned his head over
his shoulder as he walked away and
said: 'Foote is going to Sacramento to
make John D. Spreckels' speech.' "
A few minutes later Mr. Tarpey went
into the lobby of the Golden Eagle
Hotel, and there happened to meet Mr.
McNab. An ordinary greeting was ex
changed, when Mr. Tarpey said: "I
understand that you deny making the
statement that Mr. Foote was going to
Sacramento to make John D. Spreckels'
speech." Meanwhile Mr. Foote ap
proached, as did many others, and a
large throng soon gathered immediately
around the men.
McNab replied: "I did not exactly use
that language."
Mr. Tarpeyâ "What did you say
then?"
Mr. McNab â "I do not care to discuss
it here. Your recollection is at fault.
The convention is the place to make
speeches."
Mr. Tarpeyâ "When you make re
marks concerning a gentleman you
should be responsible for your utter
ances. You did use the language
ascribed to you and now you decline to
state what you did say."
Mr. McNab â "I cannot help it if you
made a mistake in carrying my re
marks to Mr. Foote."
Mr. Tarpey â "When my friends are
assailed I do not allow the matter to
pass unnoticed."
Mr Foote, who had been listening
eagerly to hear what explanation Mc-
Nab couFB make when brought face to
face with Tarpey, interposed with the
remark addressed to McNab: "I say j
again that the convention is no place \
to settle this question. It is purely a !
personal question. Any man who says ,
I am here to make John D. Spreckels'
speech or that I wear any man's collar
is a liar. I say it here openly."
Mr. McNab to Foote â "The conven
tion is tne place to make these
speeches. You can say what you please
when you make Sam Rainey's speech
in the convention."
Foote â "If you mean to say that I
have agreed to make Sam Rainey's I
speech or anybody else's speech in the
convention you utter an absolute false
hood."
McNab â I Judge from what is said in
the sugar paper that you intend to
speak for Rainey; now, Mr. Foote, if
you want to make any speeches address
your remarks to the Alameda delega
tion. You do not represent me. Why,
you were interviewed in the sugar or
gan.
Mr. Foote â No, I do not represent
you. The Alameda people whom I rep
resent are men of character and not
liars. I couldn't have my interview pub
lished in your organ.
McNab (trying to edge away) â You
must excuse me now, as I am busy.
Foote â If you busy yourself in the fu
ture by making any more lying re
marks about me, I will give you ,more
business than you ever had, and I give
you warning now.
The thronsr eased away to allow Mc-
Nab to withdraw, but a murmur of
jeering comment and laughter at the
expense of the whispering Gavin was
heard. McNab's tongue could not be
controlled, for when he was out of dan
ger he hissed back some insinuating re
marks against the men who had just
called him down In the presence of
State Senators, eminent lawyers and
many other prominent people.
McNab smiled when asked about the
incident. "Oh, it was nothing." he said,
"merely an exchange of persiflage be
tween gentlemen. There was nothing
approaching a row."
He spoke with a rich Scotch brogue,
but the customary assurance was want
ing.
"Didn't Foote call you down about
things you have said concerning him?"
"I assure you, no. There was noth
ing of the sort. Nothing that might
not have occurred in any group of gen
tlemen.
"No,* 1 he continued, "I am not a can
didate for office, at least only an emer
gency candidate." McNab did not like
to discuss the Foote episode and wel
comed a summons from a friend, which
gave him a chance to excuse himself.
HOSPITABLE SACRAMENTO.
Elaborate Preparations Made by the
Energetic Committee of
Citizens.
THK CALL'S HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO. Aug. 15.â San Francisco peo
ple who wish to know what .summer :c
liko necessarily must leave home, and
they could not do better than come to this
city. Hera is summer in all its glory of
wilted linen, its sea of perspiration, its
palm-leaf and its iced drinks, yet those
who venture to complain are comforted
by the information that to-day compared
with days past and days about to arrive is
like a breath from the Arctic. Visitors
from interior points do not seem to mind
the temperature, and some from San
Francisco who were thoughtful enough to
bring along light and airy costumes have
donned them and are strutting about,
pretty to look at and conscious of a defi
nite superiority.
Sacramentans are cordial folk, ana they
appreciate the visitors, every effort being
made to extend a welcome. The town
stayu up late o" nights piloting the strang
ers to the coolest spots and assuring them
that nobody ever suffers from sunstroke.
The heat may be never so intense, but it
Is of a benign character designed by na
ture for expelling rheums and humors
from the blood.
At th* pavilion of the State Agricultur
al Society there has been a scene of trans
formation. The interior of the structure
generally barren and uninviting, has been
changed into a place of beauty. No one
within its gorgeous but harmoniously ar
ranged interior would think of unsightly
rafters or whitewashed walls. So vast la
the space that it has not all been utilized.
An apartment has been made in the cen
eral portion by partitions of cloth, the re
sult being an octagonal enclosure, giving
the aspect of a great tent. I'nder a state
ly arch, along an aisle marked by the na
tional colors, the delegates will pass into
this tent.
Around the sides. intersperseaUat inter
vals with American flags, are the coats of
arms of the various States. Across the
center, apparently suspended on nothing,
so minute are the supporting wires, are
countless flags. Red, white and blue are
draped above and around the platform, in
streamers, shields and general profusion.
Against the background of flags in the
front center is a picture of Washington,
while on each side are arranged those of
Governor Budd, Senator White, Cleve
land and Bryan. Altogether the effect la
fine and impressive. William Boyne. the
decorator, has shown the most artistic
taste. Even county banners, usually
mere transparencies stuck up on poles, arc
red, white and blue, shaped like the Amer
ican shield, and will be suspended the
sam<Â» as the other banners.
The most striking single feature of the
decoration is the canopy overhead. It is
all in red, white and blue, and springing
from the center and spreads like a great
flower, solid In the middle and then the
petals extending separately, the ends be
ing joined to the sides of the octagon,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
forming 1 a complete and splendid ceilittÂ£.
Not only is all this pleasing to the eye,
but the acoustic properties <>f the Pa
vilion are much improved, a test to-day
showing- that the tones go clear and ring
ing to the farthest corner.
There has been every provision made
for the seating of delegates and of spec
tators, and accommodations for represen
tatives of the press. An electric fan has
been put in r>lace and in the midst of
the assemblage there will be a fountain
Sowing with Ice'water. The committees

DWYER DESIRES PEACE.
CALL HEADQUARTERS,
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 15.
â Joseph J. Dwyer, who, â with.
ex-Judge J. F. Sullivan, led the
Democratic reform movement in
San Francisco six years ago, ar
rived here this evening to take
a hand in the fight against the
seating of the Alford-Gould-
McNab delegation. Dwyer has
frequently of late been mention
ed as am aspirant for the Con
gressional nomination in the
Fourth District. He says that
the Congressional fight is a
secondary matter.
"I came here," said he to
night, ''to assist in the batue
that is being waged for Demo
cratic principles. I want to see
the Democrats of San Francisco
given their rights and harmony
restored in the ranks.''
"How about your candidacy
in the Fourth DistrictP" was
asked.
"I am not a candidate in the
sense that I am going around
soliciting delegates to vote for
me. I am more interested in
having the party troubles in
San Francisco satisfactorily ad
justed. When that is accon
plished, if the Democrats of the
i'ourth District choose me as
their Congressional representa
tive, I will fully appreciate th#
honor beÃtowed."2
SEAWELL IS NOT OUT OF THE RACE.
The Senator Says He Expects Quite a Batch of Votes
for the Gubernatorial Nomination.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, Sacramento, Aug. 15.â
While there is a general feeling that the nomination for
Governor is going to Maguire, it must not be considered
that the field is altogether clear for him. Senator Seawell
of Mendocino is not only on the ground but finds the ground
covered by his friends.
â â J have not withdrawn from the fight," said the Sena
tor. "I do not believe there is any one man who is neces
sary to the salvation of the \ arty. Of course, as a loyal
Democrat I will abide by the verdict of the convention.
Some people have an idea that the first man in the field is
the only one entitled to consideration. I do not think so.
Judge Maguire has support, but it remains to be seen
whether he has all the support necessary. He has been work
ing for the nomination and I have not, yet 1 have assurances
â¢ more than a scattering support is ready to stand by me.
I am not urging my cause particularly, but simply state that
I am ready to abide by the decision of the convention."
The suggestion was made that the Populists had named
.Maguire and that his indorsement was regarded by them as
inevitable.
"I do not consider," replied Seawell. "that the Popu
lists are yet in control of the Democratic party. If they are
1 must accept the ruling, but it does not seem to me to be
i on sound reasoning. Why should we give way to
these people? The very fact that they have chosen Ma
guire seems to me an argument against him, and yet I am
only a member of the Democratic party ready to regard its
decision as final. I do not withdraw from the contest.
To do so would be to retreat inder fire."
At this point Seawell was greeted by a delegate.
"There is only one member here from Yolo," said the
delegate, "and he is for you from start to finish."
A number of delegates gathered and the group swelled
to an imposing number. "We are for Seawell." they said.
Meanwhile Maguire was receiving his adherents above
and they were congratulating him that his support in the
convention would be numerous.
At a late hour Seawell was still the center of a. crowd,
and the crowd was for him.

There is a general impression among
politicians that Saturday's primary was
like a meeting of Friends compared to
what is expected next .Wednesday. The
Fardee-Davis primary did not bring out
a large vote. Two years ago. when Hil
born and Frick contested for the Con
gressional delegation from this county,
14,000 votes were polled. On Saturday
last Dr. Pardee, who beat Davis a little
better than two to one, polled but 6907
votes.
On Wednesday the great battle that has
been brewing for a year between Victor
Metcalf and Congressman HUborn will be
decided in this county. Even now the ac
tual excitement of the contest is appar

of the rival candidates are the scenes of

while they believe that they will obtain

with fifteen. He also expects to g>t near

r-ssman Hilborn and his son-in

of the result of the primaries:
"We shall certainly win this fight in
Alameda County. That is to say. we shall
ol tain a majority of the delegates. Af

'â¢in this i tunty every Indication points
to our obtaining not less than half the
entire delegation. Wo do not need more
than two Assembly districts to nominate,
with the help of outside counties. If we
can carry two Assembly districts in Ala
meda we shall s. . ure the nomination, and
rtain of doing this. We confi
dently expect, however, to carry a ma
jority from Alameda."
At Mr. Metcairs headquarters the Kltti

I
"Our canvass has been completed, and
â¢the result, though not unexpected, is
most gratifying. The result of the pri
mary election last Saturday simply
confirmed thai canvass. Mr. Metcalf
will carry every Assembly district in
this county beyond daubt. Hi.s supporters
ure found in all ranks. They represent
the sound, conservative Republicans of
the district, by whom Mr. Hilborn has
been weighed and found lamentably
wanting. Opposed to them are the Fed
eral brigade of Republicans and Demo
cratic office-holders whom Mr. Hilborn
has terrorized with threats and the
â¢push,' to whom he has been lavish
of promises. These are Mr. Hilborn's
â¢elements of strength.' Mr. Metcalf
then will be nominated by Alameda
County alone; but In addition there will
Â«r..me to him at least twenty-three votes
from outside counties."
\V. R. Davis has made public a state

hie friends from any support they may
oave promised him.
R. W. Church, who la a Pardee dele

candidate for Clerk of the Supreme Court.
If the gubernatorial nomination should
come to Alameda It is understood that
Church will not be mentioned, but other

Dick Beamer's Delegates Are Being

CALL HEADQT'ARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 15.â The rivalry for places
on the State ticket is by no means in
tense. The number of candidates is not
small, but what strikes the spectator is
the general apathy of aspirants. Politi
cians account of this state of affairs on
the ground that when the ticket is made
up everything is to be sacrificed for the
election of Maguire. Delegates generally
assert that Maguire will carry the State,
but do not express confidence in the suc
ot the whole ticket.
Delegations from the remote counties of
Trinity and Inyo arrived this afternoon.
A. \V. Eibi-shutz of Independence, Inyo,
reports that his people stand in for fu
sion, but take little interest in the tem
porary or permanent organization of the
convention.
William Condon and James W. Bartlett
of Weaverville, Trinity County, support
Magulfe and fusion. The absence of
John McMurray of Trinity is noted.
This is the first time that he has missed
a Democratic State Convention since Gov
ernor Irwin was nominated in Union Hall
in 187.".
A candidate for the State Board of
Equalization from the Fourth District
entered the race this afternoon, or at
least William R. Burke of Los Angeles
yielding to the earnest desire of his nu
merous friends in that district and allowed
his name to be entered on the list. Mr.
Burke has lived in this State for thirteen
years. He was a member of the Arkan
sas Legislature when James R. Jones and
James H. Berry were elected to the
United States Senate. During his public
career in Arkansas he gave much atten
tion to the subject of assessments and
taxation.
According to the fusion programme the
Populists are to have one nominee for the
State Board of Equalization, but the man
ner of determining the district in which
the Populist will parade as the accepted
nominee of the amalgamated party has
not been settled, therefore the adroit
Populists are looking over the field for an
easy district to win. A report was started
to-day that the Third District, now rep
resented by R. H. Reamer of Woodland,
was deemed a walk-over territory for any
lame Popocrat, but Beamer's friends in the
I >emocratic camp resent the intrusion.
When the forces are lined up for voting
on the choice of nominee it will br found
that Beamer is master of the situation.
Fifteen of the twenty delegates of the
San Diego delegation arrived this after
noon, and the remaining five are en route
from San Francisco. A caucus of the
delegates at the Golden Eagle Hotel has
been called. I. I. Irwin is chairman of.
the delegation.
Dr. Matthews of Tehama, Will S. Green
and John Boggs, of Colusa, John Gaffey
and J. Marion Brooks, of Los Angeles, are
some of the old time Democrats attend

The forty-three delegates from Ala

POPULIST CARLSON SAYS THE SOUTH IS
FOR FUSION.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 15.â T0 the Democrats of the South it appears
that the only fight in the State Convention will be over the contesting
delegations from San Francisco. With the exception of less than half a
dozen delegates from Los Angeles, with whom I have talked, the senti
ment among them is in favor of seating the delegation appointed by the
Committee of One Hundred. As the Los Angeles delegation will be gov
erned by the unit rule a solid vote will undoubtedly be given to the Mc-
Nab faction. The entire South is united on the fusion plan, and I do not
nok for any material opposition to it in the convention. I believe the
" cement entered into at the time of the Populist State Convention will
be carried out and those nominees allotted to the Populists indorsed by
the Democrats.
The Southern Democrats have two candidates for positions on the
*irket Judge Hughes of San Diego seeks the nomination for Supreme
rm.rt" Justice, and Charles Edelman of Orange is a candidate for Treas
urer. In the interest of harmony I am of the opinion that a satisfactory
rnmopomise can be made if necessary.
As to the chairmanship of the convention the South is divided be
tween Patton and Dockweiler. In the event the delegations are unable to
nite on either Mayor Phelan of San Francisco is spoken of as a com
promise chairman. Governor Budd's supporters for the position from the
Â£\nth are few in number. Registration throughout the South is heavier
fi^n in any other section of the State and a fusion ticket would poll the
fÂ«ll strength of the Populists, Democrats and Silver Republicans. There
i^ slight opposition among the Democrats to the indorsement of Barlow
Jor Congress from the Sixth District, and those opposing are in favor of
nostponing action and holding a separate convention somewhere in the
H^trict a few weeks later. I have, however, found many ardent support
ers from the northern counties. Barlow is a tower of strength in the
southern counties on account of his untiring efforts and final results on
the San Pedro harbor matter. Edward L. Hutchinson, Populist nominee
for Lieutenant Governor, is exceptionally popular. All factions are un
nuestionably in favor of his indorsement. His aggressiveness and ability
as a political organizer, coupled with his Â« tpon * " tt^ m * n * ff 1?o^1 ?o^L r ' M<>

PLANNING TO
SETTLE THE
DISAFFECTION
New Primary Election
Is Suggested.
STATE COMMITTEE MAY ACT
WHAT PROMINENT PABTY MEN
SAY ABOUT THE SITUATION.
Some Delegations in Favor of Seat
ing the Harneyites and Let
ting the Factions Do
the Best They Can.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, Sacra
mento, Aug. 15. â The fight between the
San Francisco factions is growing more
intense and the delegates from the in
terior who are n<>\v here confess that
they do not see the way clear toward
settling the trouble. It was at first
suggested to give each delegation a
half vote, but that plan has not met
with favor. It would be an easy way
of adjusting matters so far as the con
vention is concerned, but it would not
restore harmony in the ranks of the
San Francisco Democracy. The war for
supremacy would be renewed with In
creasing bitterness when the delegates
returned home and nothing is more cer
tain than that two local tickets would
be placed in the field. The plan has vet
to be devised that will be satisfactory
to bqth delegations and send the mem
bers home satisfied when the conven
tion work is over. The best suggestion
this far offered is to give both sides
recognition in the hall convention and
then take the party machinery out of
their hands.
It has been suggested that the con
vention instruct the new State Central
Committee t" call a primary in San
Francisco, take complete charge of the
primary election and give recognition
to the successful faction. If this plan
is adopted to secure a local nominat
ing convention, it is also suggested that
at the same primary a new county com
mittee be elected.
The McXab-Sulllvan faction has lost
considerable ground already and seems
to be making a poor fight among the
country delegates.
Major Harney, John F. McGovern
and Samuel Knhlman have been doing
good work on their side of the fight
and many of the delegates from points
outside of San Francisco seem favor
ably Inclined toward them. Francis J.
Heney, who is a member of the Com
mittee of One Hundred, is opposed to
the appointed delegation said to have
been put up in the interests of McNab.
who would like to go to Congress from
the Fourth District.
"I am not here representing any fac
tion," said he, yesterday afternoon,
while discussing the Pan Francisco
fight with Edward MeGettigan of So
lano County. Edward McCabe of this
<ity and Judcre Harris <>f Fresno. "All
! I want is to have the convention take
I some ' definite stand and settle our
! troubles in San Francisco. Unless
j things are straightened out the Demo
cratic ticket will lose many hundreds of
votes Every one will admit that un
less a good majority is given the ticket
in San Francisco the candidates we
nominate for State offices will be
slaughtered.
"It will not do any good to allow both
factions a half vote in the convention.
That will not bring them together. If
the State Central Committee takes the
matter in hand and calls a primary for
the election of municipal delegates and
a new county committee. I feel that all
good Democrats would be satisfied. The
Harney people are in favor of a prim
ary but the majority of the Commit
tee of One Hundred are opposed to the
plan. Unless some way is found out of
the trouble. I will resign from the com
mittee and I know that a dozen others
will do likewise. I am not in the com
mittee looking for office now or in the
future. I want to see the party succeed
and it cannot possibly succeed if we
are to have two factions vq San Fran
cisco."
"This fight in San Francisco," said
Mr. McGettigan, "is a serious one for
the party. I notice in the i-apers of
San Francisco that the registration has
been very light. The light registration,
in a measure, can be accounted lor by
the fight in the Democratic party, ilany
life long Democrats are so disgusted
with the way things have been handXed
in San Francisco that they have nit
taken the trouble to register. I was in
the city last Saturday and I met in
one home three friends of mine who
told me that they had not registered.
When I asked them the reason they
replied that they were so dissatisfied
with affairs that they did not intend to
vote."
Judge Harris also had a word to say
on the subject:
"The Democrats of Fresno want to
see this trouble straightened out," he
said, "for every one realizes that it is
doing the party great injury."
"The Sacramento delegates feel the
same way," said Mr. McCabe, "but how
are we to settle the matter? Show us
the way," he concluded, "and we will
be only too happy to assist in the
work."
A majority of the delegates assembled
here are of the opinion that the Harney
people have right on their side, but are
hesitating because of a doubt of the
policy of turning down the pro
grammers.
A caucus of the Sacramento delega
tion was held in the Senate chamber
this morning and W. D. Carmichael
was elected chairman. It was at first
Intended to take some action in the
Ran Francisco fight, but it was thought
best to wait and see if the factions
cannot agree upon some harmonious
plan among themselves.
The Kern County delegation is said
to be in favor of seating the Harney
ites and letting the San Francisco fac
tions settle their home fight between
themselves.
MONTEITH WANTS
TO GO TO CONGRESS
SAYS THERE IS A COMPACT TO
BEAT HIM.
If Defeated for the Nomination Before
the Convention He Will Run as
an Independent.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 15.â A new factor has en
tered into the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict contest In the person of George W.
Monteith, Populist. Montelth, it will he
remembered, was nominated by the Popu
lists two yeare ago in the First District,
and when the fusion arrangement with
the Democruts was effected refused to
give way to F. A. Cutler, thereby ma
terially aiding In the election of Barham.
Monteitti is now in Sacramento making
a flKht for the Democratic-Populist nomi
nation from the Fifth, though, as he can
didly admits, with slight chance of auc
0688. In order to enter the lists, Mon
teith has removed from San Rafael to
1930 A Eddy street, San Francisco. To-day
he gave some interesting information re
garding the .situation from his point of
view.
"There is a secret compact between Mc-
Nab and Loud," said Monteith. "whereby
tin- paths ar.- to be made smoother for
ea>ch. Under this arrangement Julius
Knhn was changed over from the Fifth
District, where he would have had a
stroiiK following, to the Fourth, in which
district he will cut no figure against Mc-
Nab. For the same reason I will be
turned down for the nomination In the
Fifth on the Democratic ticket by the
Gould-Alford-McNab combination and a
man nominated who will cut no figure
whatever in th.- running. TA ith kahn out
of the way the Reptmlican nomination
will bp easy for T.oud. while McNab will
carry off the Fourth District plum in the
Democratic convention.
"But while I may and undoubtedly will
he defeated for the nomination I propose
to mak-< It decidedly interesting for the
combination. 1 have some strong friends
behind me who are urging me to run in
dependently in the Fifth District, but I
am not pr*-ared to state just yet what
1 shall do in this regard."
While Monteith refused to commit him
self definitely it was evident from Ms
manner that he has fully determined to
enter the fight in the Fifth District as an
Independent candidate if the Democrats
refuse to give him the nomination. He
has prepared the following statement for
The Call outlining his position before 1 the
Democratic convention and giving rea
sons for entering the canvass: ,

HONGKONG, Aug. 15.â Manila has surrendered to Rear Admiral Dewey.
The Americans bombarded the city Saturday and were soon in possession.
The officers of the Kaiserin Augusta, which arrived here to-day, are very*
reticent regarding Manila, but I have heard from a Spanish passenger who was
on the cruiser that Saturday morning Dewey's fleet advanced toward Manila
and demanded its surrender. The demand was refused. The forts were bom
barded and the city taken by assault.
Augusti, who had relinquished the government before to the Military Gov
ernor, was taken off by the German cruiser late at night. Governor General
Augusti and his family arrived here to-day from Manila on the German cruiser
Kaiserin Augusta. I sought an interview with the Governor General. He re
fused to say anything, however, except that he and his entire family were
returning to Spain.
.General Augusti, shortly after
:\hi& arrival, had a conference with
â Sthe Spanish Consul here.

Â;â¢?Â« It is remarked that the fastest
.German cruiser was used to
'bring him to Hongkong. The
;. Kaiserin Augusta brought mail
for the German Consul, who at

It is conjectured that General

tion concerning the fall of Ma

Speculate as to what brought on

BAY, HARBOR AND CITY OF MONILO.
By the Joint Attach of Admiral Dewey and General Merritt on Saturday These Caroe Into Possession of t^e United
States by Conquest.
TIIE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 16, 1898.
It will, of course, be the duty
of the American troops to pro
tect them from the vengeance of
the insurgents.
The reports of the fall of Ma
nila and the flight of Captain
General Augusti were discussed
by the President to-night with
Secretaries Alger and Wilson
and Adjutant General Corbin.
Not any great importance was
attached to the action of the Ger
man commander in permitting
the Spanish commander to es
cape on his ship. It is supposed
that Captain General Augusti
made arrangements with the
German admiral to board his ship
whenever there was danger of the
capture of the city by the Ameri
cans.
From the way the officials with
whom I talked to-night discussed
it, it is evident the administra
tion does not propose to lay any
undue stress upon it. So far as
can be learned the capture of Ma
nila does not change the situa
tion in the Philippines. The only
difference has been to make the
American hold to the island
stronger than it would have been
had the Spanish troops remained
in the field.
The insurgents still have to be
dealt with, but the authorities are
confident of the ability of Rear
Admiral Dewey and Major Gen
eral Merritt to control Aguinal
do, and they do not look for any
further trouble in the islands in
the Far East for the present at
east. It will- now be Major Gen
eral Merritt's duty to proclaim
the Island of Luzon a military
possession of the United States
md put into force the tariff
schedule with which he was pro
vided before his departure from
San Francisco.

NO SURPRISE TO THE
WASHINGTON OFFICIALS,
Augusti by His Flight Lost the Op
portunity of Going Down in
History as a Hero.
WASHINGTON, Aug. l.">.â The Infor
mation contained in Consul Wildman's
j briof message aroused intense interest.
| but created no surprise among those
; officials who read it. For two OT three
(Jays news of the fall of Manila has
j been expected. The last dispatches re
i reived from Admiral Dowey and Gen
> oral Merritt indicated that it was their
purpose to force a surrender of the city
I aÂ« soon as possible.
It is believed that they joined In a
note to General Augusti demanding the
surrender of Manila, threatening to
make a combined sea and land attack
upon the city unless the demand was
acceded to. While no information other
than that received in Consul Wildman's
dispatch has been received by the ad
ministration, it is in a measure con
firmed by a brief dispatch to-night from
Madrid.
If the report of General Augusti be
true, and its accuracy is not questioned
here, the probabilities are that official
dispatches will be received by the Gov
ernment in a day or two at the latest.
The (light of General Augusti from
Manila created some amusing comment
here to-night. As one official expressed
it: "Had he maintained his position,
hard as it was, until the arrival of the
news of peace, he would have been a
hero; but he fled, and he will now be
branded as a coward."

ing the signing of the protocol had

According to Augusti Germans Com-
mitted a Hostile Act.
HONGKONG, Aug. 16.â 1t was ru
mored here last night that Manila had
surrendered, but no news is obtain
able from the Spanish Consul. Gover
nor General Augusti refused to speak.
The German Consul was called upon,
and he informed the correspondent
that thf outskirts? of Manila were bom
barded by the Americans and that the
city surrendered. No damage was
done to the city proper, only "the out
skirts being bombarded. The date of
the bombardment was unknown to the
German Consul, who refused to say
more. ( J?
General Augusti told a lady that Ad
miral Dewey demanded the surrender
of Manila in an hour. The Spaniards
declined to surrender and they imme
diately began the bombardment, and
the Spaniards hoisted a white flag.
General Augusti immediately jumped
into a German launch which was in
waiting and went to the Kaiserin Au
gusta, which sailed before the bom
bardment was concluded. The bom
bardment occurred on the 13th.

SOBER THOUGHT HAS
SUBDUED THE CUBANS
No Ldnger Talk of Continuing Hos
tilities Despite the President's
Proclamation.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 14.â
Hours of sober thought have consider
ably modified the views of Cubans on
the subject of cessation of hostilities.
There is no longer any talk of not rec
ognizing the fact that peace has been
virtually declared between the United
States and Spain. The Cubans have
come to realize that such a view of
affairs might make the situation very
disagreeable for them.
The censorship which was reimposed
here a week ago has been lifted and
I am able to tell of a remark that Gen
eral Shafter made on this subject to i
me Saturday. It had been cut by the j
censor out of my dispatch referring to
the attitude of the Cubans. "I do not
believe," Gen. Shafter said, "th&t the
Cubans will go on fighting in the face
of the proclamation." Here he brought
his fist down on the table by way of
emphasis. "But if they do," he con- j
tinued. ""they will be making an attack
upon the United States and will be
treated accordingly."
What Garcia may do is hard to tell,
but Castillo and other leaders here be
lieve that he will at once cease opera
tions and faithfully observe the procla
mation.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 15.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: President McKinley Is
adopting every means possible to get
in touch with public opinion on the
question of the Philippines and the
final terms of peace with Spain. Pres
ident McKinley realizes that at the
present time public sentiment in this
country strongly favors holding all the
islands of the group, but there are no
indications that he is yet ready to
adopt this policy.
Senator Allison's appointment as a
member of the peace commission Is
now regarded as assured and his name
is added to that of Secretary Day on
the list of members. The appointment
of Former Secretary of the Navy Tracy
as a member of the commission is re
garded as practically assured.
There is no longer any doubt that
Ambassador Hay is to be Secretary of
State upon the retirement of Secretary
Day. It cannot be said, however, that
Whitelaw Reid has been definitely se
lected to succeed Hay.
The President decided to-day to ap
point Major General M. C. Butler, com
manding the first division of the Second
Army Corps, to the Cuban commission.
The other army members of this com-f
mission will be Major General Wade,
who was one of the men originally se
lected. Major General John R. Brooke
still stands at the head of the military
committee to be sent to Porto Rico.
It is now the intention of the President
to associate with him Brigadier Gen
eral Theodore Sen wan.
It is now understood Rear Admiral
Sampson will be the naval member of
the Cuban commission and Rear Ad

DOCKWEILER IS
CAUCUS CHOICE
FOR THE CHAIR
Patton Beaten, Withdraws His
Name for the Temporary
Office.
Production of a Railroad Pass Causes Con
sternation Among the Delegation
From the South.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- !
MENTO, Aug. 15.â As pretty a fight is
on in the Los Angeles delegation as one
could wish to see and which promises
to have a hearing of considerable mo- i
on the convention. Here is tho j
Btory of the trouble as given by one
of the Mitchell followers:
For several years what is known as
the "Tennessee Brigade." among which
is numbered Dr. Hill, chairman of the
County Committee; W. R. Burke,
George S. Patton. Frank James and
John T. Gaffey, have been struggling to
Rain control of the party machinery in j
lea County. Several months ;
ago they began operations looking to
the capture of the delegation to the
Ftate convention. Their programme
included the overthrow of John
W. Mitchell, A. Ramish. M. C. Marsh.
J. Marion Brooks and others of equal
prominence, through whose efforts the
party organization has been kept up in
the southland. These men did not be
gin the work of fortifying themselves
in their positions until a week before
the county convention, but when they |
did start in they made a brave showing.
George S. Patton was one of the lead
ers of the attack on the re-gular or
ganization and directed his attention
particularly to Mitchell. The election j
of delegates to the county convention ;
afforded the opportunity Patton and j
his associates sought.
Mitchell was a candidate for
delegate from the Fifth Super
visorial District, his opponent be
ing a colored man, the only one
pitted against the Southern man to in
tensify his chagrin at being delegate.
Mitchell claims he received a majority
of eight votes, but was counted out and
his seat given to his colored opponent.
The struggle for control of the con
vention was intensely bitter, Patton
and his followers being accused of hav
ing promised everything in sight in the
way of patronage and a whole lot that
â was purely chimerical. One of the
Issues raised was that the railroad was
back of the Mitchell following and was
giving out passes to Sacramento to its
delegates to the State Convention.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the Pat
ton forces thought that possibly the
Dockweiler camp included a majority
of the delegates from Los Angeles
County. They thereupon proceeded to
consider the proposition for a Hank
tnent to utterly demoralize the
enemy.
The flank movement in contempla
tion was this: One of the delegates
from the Fifth Supervisorial District
of Los Angeles County is Robert J. Ad
cock. After Mr. Adcock was chosen a
delegate he claims that he was ap
proached by Thomas McCaffery, chief
train dispatcher of the Southern Pa-
Cific at Los Angeles, and informed that
he would be given transportation to
the convention by the railroad com
pany. As a guarantee of good faith
Mr. McCaffery gave Mr. Adcock an or
der on the ticket agent at Los Angeles
for a ticket.
But Mr. Adcock declined to use the
order and proceeded to pay his fare to
Sacramento at the regular rate. The
order for the ticket Mr. Adcock kept
and turned over to Dr. R. W. Hill, a
delegate from Los Angeles and a Pat
ton man. The order was exhibited dur
ing the afternoon and the announce
ment was made that it would be used
on the floor of the caucus if necessary
as an argument tending to show that
the railroad company was endeavoring
to defeat Patton for chairman by the
free use of passes, orders for passes and
possibly money.
Mr. Adcock said to a Call correspond
ent: "The order for transportation
was given me with a request that I
vote against Patton for chairman and
for another party for chairman of the
Lor Angeles County delegation. I was
also to vote for parties for Railroad
Commissioner and member of the State
Board of Equalization from our district
as should be suggested to me later on.
I consider this proposition to unduly
influence delegates an unfair one and
turned the order for the transportation
to the chairman of our committee ex
plaining how it was given me. I did
not desire to see any man defeated by
the railroad company by such meth
ods" The following is a copy of the
order received by Mr. Adcock:
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 13.â C. S.: The
bearer is Mr. R. J. Adcock. Please fix
him to Sacramento. T. McCAFFERY.
This order was written on a sheet of
ordinary legal cap and in the style and
handwriting of the telegraph operator.
The Mitchellites deny these charges
In toto. They assert that Maguire has
no stauncher supporters in the State
than they, or that no warmer advocates
of fusion can be found. They explain
the Adcock pass affair in this way.
Adcock was a candidate for the
Assembly from t"he Seventy-third Dis
trict four years ago, but was defeated
by Frank Finlayson. Adcock has al
ways been prominent in Democratic
politics in his county, affiliating with
the regular organizations. One day J.
Marion Brooks met Adcock and asked
him if he was going to the State Con
vention. Adcock said he could not af
ford the trip and asked Brooks if he
thought the railroad would give him
transportation.
Brooks replied that he thought the
railroad was not doing anything in that
line this year, but he would see what
could be done. Brooks then saw Mc-
Caffery and asked him if there was any

chance for Adcock to secure transporta
tion to Sacramento.. McCaffery as
sured Brooks that the railroad was not
giving transportation t<> anybody, but
as a personal favor to Brooks he i Mc-
Caffery) would give Adcock a personal
order for a ticket â not a pass. McCaf
fery wrote out the order and gave it to
Brooks and had it ever been presented
and a ticket issued it wo-uld have been
charged to his account, but for some
reason Adcock never made use of it.
The fight between the two factions
has waged bitterly all day. This after
noon the delegation held a caucus for
tho purpose of deciding whether the
delegation should support Dockweiler
or Patton for temporary chairman of
the convention. At the hour named for
the caucus to meet not more than
twenty delegates put in an appearance,
and the caucus was adjourned until this
evening. At 9 o'clock, the hour named
for the meeting, only one of Dock
weiler's supporters was present. In
the meantime about thirty-five of Pat
ton's friends in the delegation had
gathered.
Some of them desired to have the
caucus called to order, but Patton him
self counseled against it. He argued
that no snap judgment should betaken.

caucus for its indorsement, and should Mr. Patton receive
the majority vote of the Los Angeles delegation at the cau
cus I shall be one of his heartiest supporters for the chair
manship honors. Mr. Patton and I are personal friends. I
have always been a supporter of Mr. Patton's political aspir
ations in the past. I believe I have a majority of the I ,os
Angeles delegation at this hour. I base this statement upon
interviews had with various members of our delegation and
reports brought to me by those friendly to my candidacy.
I have been a Magiiire man ever since July. 1897, when
I promised him personally my support. I am unqualifiedly f of
fusion because I believe the same to be for the besi interest
of the Silver forces and an assurance of success in the com
ing campaign. lam not thoroughly informed as to the facts
regarding the San Francisco contest. This will be a matter
for the convention at large to deside. Should I be chosen
temporary presiding officer of the convention I shall take
particular pains to appoint none but representative, fair and
honest Democrats to the committee on credentials.
Do I think that it is in line with the true spirit of Dem
ocracy to take away from the body of the party the right to
select' its delegates to a State convention and place that au
thority in the hands of a self-constituted committee? Speak
ing generally I should say no, but special cases require special
treatment. lam a Democrat and of course as such believe in
the principle that the party should be close to the people at

came rushing into the Senate chamber
Sinâ¢ and out of breath, They an
i unred that the San Francisco train
h id lust arrived and that the Los An
geles delegates on the delayed train
were seeking accommodations Mr.
Snvder asked that the caucus be de
layed until they could have an oppor
tunity to arrive.
Messrs Patton and Dockweiler held
a brief consultation and Mr Patton
later made a statement requesting that
the caucus be adjourned until 11 p. m.,
explaining why the late hour had been
fixed and pleading with his friends to
take no snap judgment. This propo
sition was favorably received and by
unanimous consent agreed to.
With this Mr. Dockweiler and Mayor
Snyder left the chamber and carried
the word to the Dockweiler delegates
at the various hotels.
Then there was a scurrying and a
running here and there of Dockweiler
lieutenants to marshal their forces.
But it was a labor that was not lost
as later proceedings demonstrated. It
was 11:10 p. m. when Delegate Shirley
Ward called the caucus to order. A
request for a few .moments" delay was
made and granted.
When a few moments later Delegate
Ward asked for nominations for tem
porary secretary, and Dal Neuhart was
chosen. M. W. Conkling was suggested,
but he declined.
I. B. Dockweiler nominated Dr. R. W.
Hill for chairman of the delegation, and
he was chos .n with Judge C. C. Wright
as vice-chairman. The roll call dis
closed the fact that 7" delegates out of
81 were present either in person or by
proxy.
TTIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 16, 1898.
At *he conclusion of the roll call all
proxies to the number of about twenty
were given to the secretary. Delegate
Conkling desired to know if proxies
would be returned to the parties pre
senting them. The caucus ordered thia
done. When the proxy of Delegate
Omri Bullis was announced as having
been given to I. H. Messrnore the point
of order was made that as Messmore
was not a duly elected delegate to the
State convention he could not hold the
proxy, as the Los Angeles County con
vention expressly instructed against
proxies being given out sick- of the dele
gation. Colonel Messmore has dele
gated Thomas Carey to act for him.
After some talk a motion was made
that the proxy of J'.ullis given by Mess
more to Casey be allowed. Then a
battle royal commenced and long
winded arguments were presented pro
and con.
After over an hour had been wasted
In debate a vote was taken, with the
result that the Bullis proxy was re
jected by a vote of 46 to 30. The ma
jority of the delegates considered it a
good test vote and that Patton would
certainly be the choice of the caucus
for chairman of the convention.
Chairman Wright then announced
that the next order of business would
be the 'selection of a Los Angeles Coun
ty representative to be presented be
fore the convention for chairman.
George S. Patton was placed in nomi
nation by Major A. McCremmin, who
said that the delegation owed it to
Patton to show that they appreciated
his fidelity to the Democratic party.
D. K. Trask in a brief but eulogistic
b placed I. B. Dockweiler in in'mi
nation. The roll was called and to the
great surprise of the Patton forces
Dockweiler was declared to be elected.
The vote stood- Dockweiler, 40: Pat
ton, 37. After the result of the vote of
the caucus had been announced Mr.
Patton was interviewed and in response
to questions, said: "No, sir. I will not
allow my name to go in-fore the con
vention as a candidate for temporary
chairman. I will abide by the decision
of the caucus."
LAWLOR'S ROUGH RIDERS.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. If>.--A new element \v;is
projected Into the situation this evening
on th*_> arrival of the late train. There
was on board a considerable delegation
shouting for Judge W. I. Lawlor for Con
gressman from the Fourth District. They
arrived with every .'how of confldenc â¢ that
they had the fi^rht won. According to their
figures, neither McNab nor Barry has a
ghost of a show. They declare thai Mc-
Nab is in the fight merely for 1 1 1 * - purpose
of throwing his strength to Marry, but
that tho throw will be futile, as 'Lawlor
has the strength in sight to overcome the
combination.
They scoff at the declaration that Mr-
Nab is not In the fight, saying that he
will do his utmost to win and will only
surrender for the benefit of Harry when
he sees there is no hope for himself.

John O'Leary and <'aptain O'Connell, of

CALL HEADQUARTERS, Sacra
mento, Aug. 15.â Topics connected with
the organization of the convention en
gage the attention of delegates and
candidates. George S. Pattpn and Isi
dore Dockweiler of Los Angeles anivetl
to-day and during the afternoon held
quite a conference in Mr. Patton's
rooms at the Golden Eagle Hotel. The
personal relations existing between
the two candidates who have been
brought forward for the position of
temporary chairman of the convention
are of the most cordial character and
nothing is likely to develop which will
disturb the existing harmony.
Indications point to Mr. Patton as the
winning man. He possesses fine ability
as a presiding officer, bring endowed
with qualities of mind which enable
him to act with prompt decision. Tact
counts for a great deal in the manage
ment of a Large body of earnest dele
gates, and this prime quality is one of
Patton's gifts.
The numerical strength of the Los
Angelee delegation is eighty-one, and
judging by expressions used by Mr.
Patton in an Interview for The fall,
the delegation will act as a unit in the
i main propositions of the convention.
The Sixth Congressional District, by
reason of the large vote cast for Bryan,
will wield a powerful Influence in the
convention which assembles to-morrow.
Apart from the eighty-one delegates
from Los Angeles County, there are
sixty delegates from five other eoun
i ties of the district, making a total
I strength of 141 votes. The Fourth
I Congressional District Of San Fran
cisco swings but 89 votes in the con
vention.
Many of the delegates from Southern
California are supporting tin candidacy
of A. W. Hutton for Justio- of the Su
preme Court, although Van l>yki\ the
accepted fusion nominee, is from that
region. The claim for both Judgeships
is based on tliL- fact that Southern Cal
ifornia has no representative at present
I in the Supreme Court.
The candidacy of It. Y. McÃride for
; State Printer is gaining headway under
the pressure from the south, and his
' nomination is now predicted by many
j who haw given the subject close study.
Southern California comes to the
front with a candidate for Secretary of
i State in the person of Joseph D. Lynch,
i formerly editor of the Los Angeles Her
ald. The fact- that Mr. Lynch has been
j a resident of San Francisco for a year
â : or more docs not deprive him of the
: honor and distinction belonging to a
! citizen of the Bouth land.
For the State Board of Equalization,
Fourth District, Los Angeles comes to
i the front readily with two candidates.
j One is \V. H. Workman, ex -Mayor of
that city, and the other Manuel Mer-
I ritt.
The pleasant and cordial greeting ex
| tended to John T. Gaffey of Los Ange
les tends to establish the knowledge
that the old war horses of the Demo
cratic party are admired if not re
warded.
Major Harney, Harbor Commissioner
and straightout uncompromising Dem
ocratic stalwart, came up from the bay
j this afternoon and at once produced a
I receipt showing that he hud hired a
hall. Fusion may have its allurements,
but still Democrats of the Harney
school have champions. No one can
tell just now what the convention will
i do with the 154 delegates chosen at the
primary elections in San Francisco, but
the common talk among groups of un
trammeled delegates from the interior
is not complimentary to the plan of
appointing delegates by committee and
sending men to the convention by
proxy.
Major Harney is receiving many tele
grams of good cheer from the incom
ing delegations. The wind messages
tell him to stand firm as the boys are
With him. Some of these messages tend
to convince the major and his follow
ers that the vital spark of the old-time
party organization has not been ex
tinguished by the wet blanket of fu
sion.

THE CALL'S HEADQUARTERS,
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 15.â There has
been an industrious effort to show that
Major Harney is no longer in the fight,
and this has been offset by the major
himself, who is not only in the fight,
but in it to stay. The effort is due to
the enemies of the p'rimarj| system who
have taken matters Into their own
hands. They assert that the Harney
ites have been placed bora de combat
and that their claims are not to be con
sidered by the State Convention. The
major, being asked about this, made a
very pointed denial which seems to set
tle the question.
"A 1 the tir.-t meeting of the com
mittee of nine," said the major, with a
show of feeling little hort of indigna

of the two bodies, tlie Harney commit

THREE COUNTIES
AGAINST FUSION
MENDOCINO, HUMBOLDT AND SO-
NOMA FOR SEAWELL
They Call Attention to the Failure of
Fusion in the North Two
Years Ago.
THE OAT.T. HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO, Aug. 15.â The Sonoma Coun
ty delegation composed of nineteen dele
grates, has come to tie convention with
three definite purposes In view. They
are to secure the nomination of J. H. S*-a
w<'!l for Governor, defeat fusion, and aid
in Beating the Hamey delegation from
San Francisco. On these propositions
the delegation will vote as a unit, and
each member hag declared hlfl intention
of declining to recede from the position
that lias heen taken.
In the effort to secure the nomination
of Judge Beawell the Sonoma delegates
will be joined by those from Mendocino
County and probably by those from
Humboldt County. It is also probable
that the delegates from both of these
last named counties will also stand to
gether on the anti-fusion proposition, as
well as in the endeavor to secure the
Beating of tho Harney delegation from
San Francisco.
This sentiment is fostered by a keen
recollection of the incidents of the cam
paign of tw> years ago, when fusion was
agreed to in the First Congressional Dis
trict The Democratic nominee then was
F A. Cutler of Humboldt, the Populist
nominee was George W. Monteith and
the Republican nominee was John A.
Barham, the Incumbent Under the fu
sion agreement it was decreed that Man
teith should resign in favor of Cutffr,
and that Cutler should thereby become a
fusion nominee. Monteith refused to re
sign and remained in the light, thereby
receiving the Populist vote and defeat
ing as the Democrats say. Cutler.
This has been remembered by trie Dem
ocrats of the district, and they now de
clare they are against fusion in any form,
first, last and all tho time.
C O. Dunbar, editor of the Santa Rosa
Press-Democrat, is one of the Sonoma
( '..Kiity delegates. He arrived here to
day and at once began the task of seeur-
Ing Buppori for the Gubernatorial aspira
tions of Judge Sea-well. He also made it
known that he was opposed to fusion as
applied lo State politics, and that he and
his fellow delegates would do everything
possible to defeat the present fusion ar
rang< merit.
"So far as the Sonoma County delega
tion is concerned." he said, "we are lor
BeaweU for Governor, first, last and all
the time. Aside from that we will en
deavor to defeat fusion.
"It is the general feeling among the
Democrats of Sonoma County that fusion
in State politics is a mistake, and the ac
tion of the delegation in opposing fusion
will be in accordance with this feeling.
p ( rsonally. ' 'im opposed to fusion be
cause I believe that the Democratic party,
by making any combination for support
With the Populists or Silver Republicans,
will lose more strength than it will gain.
Fusion in counties is all very well, as
the community is small and the wishes
of the great majority of voters is well
known. But when the proposition Is ap
plied to State politics. I am unalterably
opposed to it, for the reason that 1 be
lieve a groat party should not resort to
such small methods of getting what is
supposed to be a momentary advantage.
We in the First Congressional District,
have had a bitter lesson on this fusion
proposition and we are able to speak from
experience. We accepted fusion two years
ago and the Populist nominee. George YV.
Monteith by refusing to resign in obedi
ence to the fusion arrangement, remained
in the fight and succeeded in defeating the
Pemocartic nominee. F. A. Cutler. The
men who are running the present fusion
arrangement now propose tn make this
same Monteith the fusion candidate for
Congress from the Fir** District. This is
a little more than we can stand for even
II we' were ti"t Opposed to fusion as a
general proposition. If the fusion agree
ment is ratified it will be accomplished
without the votes of the Sonoma County
delegation.
"As to the fight between the twit con
testing San Francisco delegations I do HOT
care to say much at this time. As a gen
eral proposition we are prepared to stand
by the Harney delegation, as we are op
posed to the method* by which the other
delegation was brought into existence. If
the Harney nr-ople do what is right *hey
win receive our ninport and I believe they
will receive, the- support of a naiorit:' of
tho delerares at this eonveni'on."

Edward L. Hutchison, Populist nomi
tfee for Lieutenant O. â v t -rnor,makes the
following statement concerning the
present political .situation: "Present
Indications are that 99 per cent of the
Democrats of this State are in ftvor of
fusion with the Populists and th-Â» Sil
ver Republicans, and nearly every
Democrat is in favor of the plai. of
fusion as outlined at Sacramento Kst
month. It is believed that not more
than 2 or 3 per cent of the Populists
are opposed to fusion according- to the
same plan. So far as known the Silver
Republicans are unanimous upon the
question of fusion.
"The friendly contest over the chair
manship shows a hopeful and health
ful spirit <in the part of all who are
engaged in the contest. Few people
struggle for leadership in a ho-peless
cg,use. As most any of the. men spo-.
1% n of for <h;iirman would be accept
able to those who are interested in the
liberal cause, the hopeful spirit is
shown by the large number of candi
datea for all the State and district of
flces for which candidates are to be
nominated this week.
"While in some i. arts of the State the
registration of voters is less than it
was two years ago, the southern coun
ties win show very large increase over
any previous registration. I believe
that the entire fusion plan outlined
here a month ago will be carried out
by tho Democratic and Silver Repub
lican conventions, and that ihe entire
State ticket will be elected in Novem
ber."
Congressman Moody of Massachusetts,
members of the Postal Commission which
has been investigating the conditions ex

mission are Senator Chandler of New

who will not. however, include this city
in their investigations, leaving: the task
to the three who arrived last night.
"We have Investigated the existing con
ditions of the postal service," said Mr.
Loud last night, "from one end of the
country to the other, forming- compari- i
sons to discover whether the service can j
be made uniform and suiting the particu- i

consideration of this branch of our work
until our arrival in- San Francisco.".
In regard to the public political senti- j
ment In the East Loud said: "The East- i
crn sentiment' seems to lean strongly j
toward the Republican side. The regis
trations on the part of the Democrats
have been noticeably light all through
the East, and a general laxity in politi
cal interest seems to mark the actions of
the Democrats throughout â¢ the country.
The war and the strength of the admin- '
istration, may be the reason for it. At ;
first I was opposed to the war, because !
I saw that the inevitable consequence '
would be the acquisition of new terri
tories and a natural and serious prob
lem would thus- be forced upon us. The
East obtained Cuba and Porto Rico, and
in the spirit of equality it would be no I
more than rfght for us to control the
Philippines, which would be of inestima
ble value, to the Pacific Coast. I do not
think that the problem of managing the
Philippines would prove a.. greater â¢ task i
than that of the islands of Cuba and
Porto . Rico. If 'we acquire them, why
not acquire the Philippines?"
Mr. Loud pleads; his long absence as
the best excuse for an ignorance of local
primary politics. He admits that he is a
candidate for re-election from his dis
trict, and says he will remain here dur
ing the entire campaign. "
A HOT TIME AT STOCKTON.
Governor Budd's Indorsement Was
the Bone of Contention.
STOCKTON. Aujr. ir..-The County Con
vention to-day was turned into riot, when
Governor Budd's friends resurrefU<-<l a
resolution endorsing him. which had been
previously killed in committee. They .hir
ed not put it to a vote, but with a Budd
man in the chair and a party of friends
with strong lung-power in the convention,
they howled "I." The "noes" came back
with a roar. A demand was made i!i;t
the chair recognize an appeal from Its <le
cision. but the friends of the Governor
rallied around Chairman Gibson and he
outgeneraled them. When the commit
tee on platform and resolutions r> ported
to the convention in the morninv not a
word was said comttepdatory ot the Gov
ernor. The commit! :>ti-Budd.
The platform was adopted and it looked
like the convention would be content to
give the Governor the marble heart.
Colonel Nunan was det< mined, how
ever, to get a Budd indorsement through;
it was sprung after resol itions and the
like were out of order. It precipitated a
whirlwind. Dr. Gordon and George Lieg
tager led the opposition, to the resolution.
When Francis mounted the platform
and started to read the resolutions com
mending Budd. Dr. Gordon followed him
and said: "I'm going to read that if any
one does. I am chairman of the commit
:.. "
Francis said it was a majority report
and he was goin.tr to read it
The hall then vommenced to rock again
under the tumult. It was claimed that
the resolutions were adopted and there
was no law to turn them over.
"Is this a l>ear .garden or a Democratic
convention ?'' yelled Mr. Gibson, and
some one replied. "It's all the same "
During this last melee Lieginger jump
ed from his seat and came forward wav
ing a cane frantically. The excitement
bordered on a riot then, and some of the
ladies in the gallery were forced to re
tire.
"Sergeant-at-arms. take that man,"
smd Qtbson.
'Id like to see him put me out," said
Liogingor.
He finally quit, and Francis got a
chance to read the resolution. This was
met with applause on one side and hisses
on the other. Lieginger then said, "They
doctored it while we were at lunch," and
when the deafening noise compelled him
to sit down he tald the convention to go
to ."
When the question was put Dr. Gordon
arose anil took the lloor. He said: "I
would not siKii that report. I deny any
Democrat who will sell himself for mon

Budd did in 1873. He called the Demo

FUSION DISCUSSED.
.San Luis Obispo County Will Lead
the Van in Approval.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA -
J&ENTO, Aug. IS.â lt is apparent that the
â t of fusion as presented by the ar
rangement entered into at the time of the
of the Populist convention has oc
â â¢ â :â  the attention of the Democrats in
almost every county in the State. Opinion
is divided as to the expediency of fusion
' â as a general proposition, and particularly
so as existing under conditions such as
are- to be presented to the Democratic
State Convention. In San Luis Obispo
County there is a strong feeling in favor
' of fusion on any basis, and this feeling
â¢ has made itself manifest in the delegation
' that will represent the county at the con
vention.
â â  T. T. Crittenden, the well-known banker
â¢ of San Luis Obispo, who is a member of
? the delegation, said to-day that the preÃ
ent fusion arrangement was acceptable to
â  the Democrats of his county and that the
egation would support the proposition
â¢â ".of fusion in any form that it may be pre
sented at the convention.
â  "The Democrats of our county," he said,
'. -"are -very anxious to see fusion consum
mated, and we. as their representatives,
â will tk> all that we can to carry out their
. Wishes. . I am not aware that there Is any
- widespread opposition to the plan of fu
sion-is arranged for by the party leaders,
' and I do not think that such opposition as
' there is will be sufficiently strong to af
. feet the result.
â¢ â  "So far as I have canvassed the mem
b.ers -.of our delegation I have gained the
Impression that the majority, if not all
of them, are in favor of seating the dele
. Ration appointed by the Committee of One
' Hundred of San Francisco. We are not t
â  thoroughly familiar with all of the facts,
.'and I should say that our final attitude in
the matter will depend largely upon the
â  manner in which the Harney faction pre
, 6'ents its case 'to the convention. I feel j
certain, however, that Justice will be done
â  : in the matter and that the convention will
.â¢â¢take' such action as will be for the best
Interests of the Democratic party in the
â¢State."

Political Notes.
The leading Republicans of this city
are now of the opinion that the party
will be compelled to nominate for Gov
ernor some man who has not as yet been
considered in the contest. The sectional
fight has become acute. Alameda County
wants Pardee, the south wants Gage and
several other candidates already meu
i tioned have secured scattering delega
tions. This condition leaves the ii*ht
open, and Republicans who have tho Best
interests of the party at heart think a
, man outside of all the sectional contro
versies should be placed at the head or
the State ticket.
Attorney Lester H. Jacobs, one of the
committee of 100 delegates to the Demo
cratic State convention, writes to the edi
tor of The Call, saying he is on the as
sessment roll in this and other counties
in the State. Mr. Jacobs' name api>ear-<l
in the list of McNab delegates published
yesterday, and It was stated that he was
not on the assessment roJl.
Local Republican politics are very quiet.
Major McLaughlln. chairman of the
State Central Committee, was out of town
! yesterday and the Republican headquar
! ters at the Palace were deserted.
FIGHTING IN PORTO RICO.
Spanish Attack on General Schwan's
Column Repulsed.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 15.âGene
ral Schwan's column was attacked be
tween Mayaguez and Lares. As the
Eleventh Infantry, under Colonel
Burke, was descending the valley of
the Rio Grande they were fired upon
from a hillside by a force of 1500 Span
iards who were retreating toward the
north. The fire was returned and the
Spaniards were repulsed with, it is ex
pected, considerable loss.
Colonel Soto, the commander of the
Mayaguez district, was wounded, and
was afterward overtaken in a wayside
cottage. He was attended by two
sergeants, who surrendered. The
Americans suffered no loss. The
artillery and cavalry were not en-
gaged.
General Pchwan had not received
news of" the signing of the peace pro
tocol when the action occurred, but
obtained it yesterday afternoon. The
reports from General Miles are meager.

Father Kozlowski asks that 150,000
damages be awarded against the Arch
bishop and Cardinal because of injuries

NAVAL REVIEW
FOR NEW YORK
Sampson's Fleet Will
Parade.
NAVY DEPARTMENT'S ORDER
PEOQBAMME ARRANGED TOR
NEXT SATURDAY.
Steps Being Taken to Reduce the
Number of Naval Militiamen
Called Into Service From
Various States.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15.â The recon
struction of affairs In Cuba, Porto Rico
and throughout the Spanish West In
dies is receiving earnest consideration
in official quarters and at the White
House. To-day the President saw a
number of prominent callers in refer
ence to this reconstruction in our new
insular dependencies. General Fitz
hugh Lee spent some time with the
President, going over the condition of
Cuban affairs. >Vhile no announcement
was made, the impression prevailed
that General Lee would be one of the
Cuban military commissioners to be
named within a few days. Acting Sec
retary Allen of the navy also saw the
President concerning Cuban affairs.
It is probable that an American naval
vessel will go to Havana harbor be
fore long and at least two naval ves
sels will be ordered to Havana when the
military commission assembles there to
determine upon the details of Spanish
evacuation.
Secretary Day also conferred with
the President and later determined, the
peace terms being matured, to take a
week's vacation. He will leave either
to-night or to-morrow morning, going
probably to Canton. Assistant Secre
tary Moore will be Acting Secretary of
the State Department during Judge
Day's absence. The Secretary's retire
ment from the head of the department
is likely to follow soon after his return
from Canton, and, indeed, it may come
during his absence, although there was
no outward evidence to-day that he
was about to close his connection with
State affairs.
The Navy Department decided during
the day to yield as far as practicable
to the public desire at New York for a
naval review of the ships of Admiral
Sampson's fleet. Accordingly Acting
Secretary Ailen issued the following or
der:
"The department is much gratified at
the desire expressed to see a review of
the warships and cruisers recently or
dered home and, so far as practicable,
is desirous of carrying out the wishes
of the citizens who wish to see the
ships. But neither the officers nor the
men of the fleet are in condition to
participate in a street parade. The de
partment is taking the opportunity of
the armistice to put these ships at once
into the best possible condition for such
service as may hereafter be required
of them. It is expected all other work
will be suspended and the entire avail
able force of the navy-yard directed to
this work, in order to secure the great
est possible dispatch.
"The department will direct that,
upon its arrival In New York harbor,
the fleet will steam up the North River
as far as General Grant's tomb, fire a
salute and steam back to its anchor
ape. It is expected that the fleet will
reach New York on Saturday, the 20th
instant."
The plan is to have Admiral Samp
son met off Sandy Hook with orders
for the procession up the North River.
It is expected that the fleet will be off
Sandy Hook some time Friday night,
but they will lie outside the harbor un
til Saturday morning.
The Navy Department Is taking steps
to reduce the force of naval militia
men called into service from the seve
ral States. The Minneapolis is to trans
fer part of her crew to the Yosemite,
thus releasing the Michigan naval mi
litiamen who man the Yosemite. The
Columbia is also to transfer her crew
to the Dixie and other auxiliary craft,
thus allowing the naval militiamen on
these auxiliaries to go home. In this
way the naval service will be speedily
turned into the hands of the regular of
ficers and crews.
SHAFTER IS GRATEFUL.
Acknowledges the Confidence Re
posed in Him at Washington.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15.â Secretary
Alger to-day received a letter from
General Shafter which is, in part, as
follows:
â¢'Headquarters Fifth Army Corps,
Santiago de Cuba, Aug. 4.â To Hon. R.
A. Alger, Secretary of War, Washing
ton, D. Câ My Dear General Alger:
Your letter of July 25 was handed me
yesterday by Major Sniffen. 1 thank
you and the President for the confi
dence expressed in my ability to
handle the matters intrusted to me
here.
"I cannot fully express my gratitude
to you for all the opportunities that
you have given me and for the confi
dence that you repose in me, as shown
more strongly than in any other way
by leaving me unhampered in my ope
rations against Santiago. lam very
sorry to see that some newspapers are
attempting to throw blame on your
trying to run the campaign from Wash
ington, and I suppose some people be
lieve it. It is one of the things, how
ever, that I don't suppose we can help,
although whenever I have the oppor
tunity I have tried to make it plain
that I have been left to my own de
vices. I am, very sincerely yours,
"WILLIAM R. SHAFTER."
CUSHING'S SPLENPID WORK.
Torpedo-Boat Fights the Last Naval
Engagement of the War.
KEY WEST, Fla., Aug. 15.â T0 the
torpedo boat Gushing, commanded by
Lieutenant Albert Gleaves, will doubt
less go the distinction of having had
the last naval engagement of the Span
ish-American war. Had the peace ne
gotiations been protracted , a little
longer the dishing would unquestion
ably have ended the conflict by glo
riously avenging its beginning, when
Ensign Bagley and his four comrades
ol the Winslow were killed at Carde
nas. At the very moment orders for
raising the blockade reached the Cush
ing she was reaching in for the three
Spanish gunboats which had wrecked
her sister boat, intent on sinking them
or herself going down in the effort.
They were the Ligergo, Alerta and An
tonio Lopez. A few days before the
Cushing destroyed six small sloops and
a two-masted schooner, the Triumph^,
of twenty-five tons.

BLANCO'S ADDRESS
OF RESIGNATION
Captain General Bitter
to the Last.
REGRETS PEACE HAS COME
WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO
ITS PROVISIONS.
Forsakes His Office Rather Than
Participate in Negotiations
With the Conquerors
of His Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA. Aug. 15.â General Blanco
to-day published the following ad
dress to the inhabitants of Cuba:
It having been resolved by the Madrid
Government to conclude peace with the
United States, 1 consider my mission in
this country ended, and have solicited my
relief from" duty. 1 could not urge upon
you a pacific solution of the existing
struggle, when not long ago 1 advised
you to maintain the war in any event.
I came to the island of Cuba, as is well
known to all, in critical circumstances.
without feax of the difficulties which I
must encounter and animated by the nope
of pacifying the island and saving It for
Snatii. with the co-operation of all politi
cal parties; and without any other ambi
tion than to lender a service to my coun
try which I so fervently love. The lack
of faith, and the distrust of some, and
the prejudices and the errors of Others
were Insuperable obstacles to my desires
and aspirations, but, despite these grave
difficulties, perhaps the day was not far
distant when we could have seen realized
so happy a. purpose, though one so con
trary to the wishes of the enemies of our
race and the domination of America. W e
had to accept the struggle at a moment
when it was least expected and under
most unfavorable circumstances. Never
thelesa we sustained the campaign with

Invaders feel the weight of our arms, and
I was willing at the head of the army to
continue disputing. Inch by inch, the land
which with such valor and at the cost of
so much blood, we were defending.
Since the nation's Government, which is
surely inspired with the great Interest Ol
patriotism and a desire also to assure
vnur proper interests and those of the
other colony believes the moment has
arrived to make peace, it is our duty
faithfully to second her in her purpose,
but it cannot !Â»<â  that I am the one called
upon to perform a duty which does not
agree with mv acts anu with my convic

I see myself obliged to leave you it
the present painful and difficult mom- at.
Nevertheless. I will not do it witnout ad

prudence so necessary to save the legit

thus I think I have rendered my last

VICTIMS OF POISON
BURIED AT DOVER
DOVER. Del.. Aug. 15.â Whatever may
be the final results of the Investigation
Into the cause of the deaths of Mrs. J. P.
Dunning and her sister. Mrs. J. D. Deane.
all the Indications at present are that
both women lost their lives by arsenical
poison tnken In the candy sent from San
Francisco by a person at present un
known. The funeral of both the victims
took place to-day from the home of ttuir
father, ex-Congressman John B. Penning
ton.
Dr. Bishop, who attended the women af
ter they bad been taken ill, gave it as his
opinion that the deaths were due to poi
soned candy. No analysis of the candy
has yet been made.
The note signed "Mrs. C" Is written
on ruled white paper In leadpencll, and
the words, "With love for yourself and
baby," are written jerkily and In an en
tirely different hand from fhe superscrip
tion, very like a woman's hand. There
are two kinds of chocolates in the box.
one hard and similar to confectioners'
make, the other soft, with every appear
ance of being homemade. The impression
of Dr. Bishop is that the poison will be
found in the latter kind.
These examinations have given rise to
a suspicion in Mr. Pennington's mind that
the box with pure candy was purchased,
after which it was opened and the pois
oned candy placed along with the good.
He states It â¢â >Â« hif! rr ' rm belief tnat nls
daughters were intentionally poisoned,
but thinks the candy was intended for
Mrs. Dunning and her baby only. He
states that he will make every effort to
solve the mystery surrounding the case.
SAN DIEGO'S "WATER SUIT.
Judge Ross Sustains a Demurrer
Filed by thÂ« City.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 15.â Judge Ross |
In the United States Circuit Court this j
morning decided a demurrer' in the ease
of the Consolidated Water Company in
the city of Ban Diego. The complainant
surd as the owner of bonds issued by the I
San Diego Water Company, secured by a j
mortgage upon the water and water plant i
with which it supplies San Diego with
water for domestic and other purposes.
The complainant alleges that the de
fendant, through Its municipal authorl- \
ties, has adopted an ordinance fixing the
rates at which water should be sold to the j
citizens BO unreasonably low as prac
tically to take away the property secur- |
ing complainant's bonds, contrary to the i
constitution of the United States.
The demurrer questioned the capacity of I
the complainant to sue.
Judge Ross holds that the bill in this
case shows that the mortgagee was not j
the complainant, but two trustees, and '
their interest conveyed by the mortgage |
was conveyed to them in trust, and the j
duty of protecting that interest develops j
upon them: for this reason the demurrer i
is sustained, with leave to complainant '
to amend if It desires. J

His Command the First to Land

Enemy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 15.â The
following is General Lawton's address
to his staff, a part of which will shortly
return home:
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVI
SION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, SANTI
AGO DE CUBA, Aug. 14.â Being ordered
to other duty, the undersigned hereby re
limiuishes the command of the Second Di
vision of the Fifth Army Corps, and in
so doing desires to express to the of
ficers and enlisted men of his command
his thanks for and appreciation of the
gallant and soldierly maiim-r In which
the duties and labors required of them
have been performed, the character of
which is almost unparalleled in severity,
danger and importance.
The Second Division, established a little
more than two months ago. proceeded
almost immediately to embark for the
expedition to Santiago. Arriving off that
coast, it was the first to disembark and
the first American military force to land
on Cuban soil. Without delay or wait
ing to secure rations, baggage or other
m â â¢â < Bsaries and conveniences of any kind
the division proceeded to Slboney. com
pelling the garrison there to retire and
capturinp the town. The division then
resumed the advance toward Santiago,
laboring night and day amid trying con
ditions, in marches, reconnolssances and
scouting, and. while covering the advance,
fighting the decisive battle of Caney.
Unique in the character of its defenses
and the importance of its situation, Ca
ney was defended with a stubborn re
sistance permitting of no surrender, and
was carried by a charge such as is made
only by American soldiers, killing,
wounding or capturing almost every
Spaniard.
Moving thence within an hour, without
one man unaccounted for. toward San
tiago and taking up a position on the
right of the army. and. hastily intrench
ing, it was engaged with the enemy on
the 2d of July. Extending to the right
and covering the bay of Santiago and
threatening the safety of the Spanish
ships, the latter sought safety in flight
to the sea.
Fighting by daylight and digging all
night, the division pressed forward to the
right under the lines and to within ISO
yards of the enemy, the right resting on
the bay of Santiago. The memorable 17th
of July came, and with it the surrender
of the city and the Spanish army, and
later the end of the war with Spain.
When overtaken by the dreaded fever
your courage, cheerfulness and fortitude
did not forsake you. When the history
of the wars for Cuban Independence is
written the Second Division will deserve
and receive a full page on every im
portant occurrence that led up to its
successful termination.
To my staff 1 desire to acknowledge
a special obligation for most loyal and
faithful duties well performed under
circumstances arid conditions too trying
to be described. H. W. LAWTON,
Major General United States Volunteers,
commanding Second Division, Fifth
Corps.

BY CALL-HERALD DISPATCH
BOAT MORAN FROM HAVANA, Aug.
14, to Key West, Fla., Aug. 15.â While
both Captain General Blanco and Sec
retary Congosto refused to grant me
an audience, I learned one important
fact about Captain General Blancoâ
that he had sent his resignation to the
authorities in Madrid and begged its
acceptance, stating that he did not
wish to have charge of the carrying
out of the agreements of the peace pro
tocol.
The Spanish population, which pre
ponderate in Havana, are resigned and
understand that if a steady and strong
government is not founded it will be '
very difficult for them to remain in the |
country, representing as they do the j
wealthy element. They prefer the idea
of annexation to any other kind of rule,
for they believe it would be the only
thing which would guarantee order and
protection of all kinds of interests.
They state that a government estab
lished under any other conditions would
not last very long.
The Cuban element representing the i
financial interests and having social I
standing, who have taken no active i
part in the warfare, have ideas similar
to those Just set forth and believe, also,
that any other government which .
might be established in this country, (
in which certain radical elements
would participate, would precipitate
great disturbances and render impos- j
sible all efforts for pacification by the |
government. In Matanzas, Cienfue
gos, Sagua and other towns and cities
of the Island the situation is similar.
According to the opinion of leading
merchants and manufacturers of those
places annexation is the only feasible
solution for the island's government.
Provisions are very scarce, especially
flour, hog lard, rice, jerked beef, cod
fish and condensed milk. The first
measures of General Shatter have been
very well received by all Spaniards here
and those Cubans who are anxious for
a government of order.
When are the provision ships com
ing? is, however, a question asked by
every one in the Cuban capital and
80,000 soldiers comprising the regulars
and volunteers now in the province of
Havana. This anxiety as to supplies
even takes precedence over the ques
tions as to when the Americans take
possession of Havana, what form of
government they will establish and
whether the Cubans are to be placed
in power.
While almost continuous communica
tion with Sagua and Batanaboa has al
lowed the city to replenish from time
to time the great store of food laid in
before the war, prices are extremely
high. Some forms of food, especially
bread, are rare luxuries, and the diet
even of those who can afford to pur
chase anything in the market has be
come painfully monotonous.
La Union Constitutional, in an editor
ial to-day under the headline "Peace,"
says :
"Rumors regarding peace at last have
been confirmed, but nothing is so far
known about the terms, though there
can be no doubt that such terms were
imposed as would be natural from a
powerful nation to one weak and con
quered."
El Pais also comments on peace, and
says that since it has been accepted by
the mother country it must also be ac
cepted by the colony.
Vessels at St. Michael.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash.. Aug. 15.â
The steam schooner South Coast arrived
here to-night, twelve days from St. Mi
chael, Alaska. Affairs at St. Michael
are reported to be very quiet. There
is still a large crowd of people there try
ing to get up the Yukon River. The
steamer Monarch had arrived with
twenty-six passengers for Dawson.
The tugs Holyoke and Resolute, which
sailed from St. 'Michael for Puget Sound
several days ahe;ul of the South Coast,
ran on a reef outside St. Michael. They
wire hung up twenty-four hours. They
put into Dutch Harbor to repair what
damage they may have sustained.

SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Aug. 15.â 0n
the part of the nativt.-y of the island,
rich and poor alike, there is great re
joicing that the war is at an end, chief
ly because they are a naturally peaceful
people unaccustomed to warfare and
bloodshed and the last two or three
weeks have been extremely trying.
Then.besides.it is useless to deny that
their sympathies have been with the
Americans, and they have welcomed
the first opportunity to make this fuct
plain.
Whether they and the Spanish and
Amerioans will form a peaceful fusion
is a question that is hard to answer.
The sentiment of the native population
is beyond doubt in favor of the Ameri
can, but the Spaniards, both military
and civil, decline to give expression to
their feelings until the exact situation
is known.
Porto Rico has been shut out from
communication with the rest of the
world so long that we are somewhat
In the dark, but I have it from reliable
neutral sources that the Spaniards and
better classes of natives prefer annexa
tion to independence. Captain Gen
eral Macias and the Spanish troops in
San Juan have emerged from the con
flict with honor, and on this point of
ficials here are pleased that Spain has
conceded peace. A continuation of
hostilities here would have meant
much useless bloodshed.
FREEMAN HALSTED.
LOWER-CLASS CUBANS
THREATEN TROUBLE
Do Not Want Peace, and Talk Even
of Attacking and Capturing
Santiago de Cuba.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 15.â
Trouble with the Cubans is brewing.
Their attitude is one of sullen b
ity toward Americans. The b
class in Cuba favor the annexation of
the island to the United States and a
majority of the masses if; ready and
anxious to work and accept the shelter
and protection afforded by an Ameri
can protectorate: but it is influenced
by a certain class of rabid orators and
breeders of sedition and rebellion
against anything smacking of law and
order.
This inflammatory class demands
and urges the recognition of Cuba for
Cubans and spurns all offers or sug
gestions tending to prosperity under an
American protectorate and excites
popular discontent. This is exactly the
class that pushes itself most into evi
dence and whose views and opinions
are most overheard and published. Its
advice to the Cubans is to repudiate
all offers of peace or a cessation of hos
tilities and to look upon an armistice
as an agreement between the United
States and Spain on their own account
and not binding upon the free and in
dependent state of Cuba, whose liber
ating army not only repudiates pacifi
cation, but will ignore the armistice to
the point of continuing to \^ige war
and shoot every Spaniard in the field.
A wild rumor is afloat to the effect
that the Cuban army will attack San
tiago and capture it, to the glory of the
Cuban arms, as soon as the American
garrison is weakened. This is directly
traceable to the same source. The in
fluence exerted by such a body of men
against law and order is formidable.
This hysterical people demands sup
pression with an iron hand. While still
in embryo this influence is already felt
among certain classes who refuse to
work or serve the Government until a
clear statement of the freedom and in
dependence of their country is made.
A knowledge of this condition is im
perative to the molding of future policy
and to explain whatever harsh steps
may be rendered necessary in dealing
with the insurgents.

REPEATING fJ WARNING.
*~p*HAT the Republicans must not be led into over
confidence is a truth daily becoming more ap
* parent. Because the national administration has
been successful, has taken advantage of the oppor
tunity to be brilliant and reflect upon the entire coun
try credit and honor, the idea prevails that victory
must everywhere seek the Republican banners and
perch thereon. This is assuming too much.
The record of President McKinley has little b
with the campaign in California. It has no bearing
on the fact that the Democrats of this State will be
led by a wily politician, a man who has. deservedly
or not. a strung personal following, and who in his
methods is not always scrupulous. Nfaguire can get
oh all side- of all questions and be plausible. He can
linst monopoly, and the discontented, the
hungry for office, flock to his standard. He is the
:â  party and will be the nominee of an
other. These parties have, generally, little in com
mon. With good cause they distrust each other, but,
as to the head of the ticket, they will, so far as nomi
mcerned, be united.
By the time â  the war will be but a mem
ory dimmed by events of another character. The
public mind i- always attracted by that which is of
current interest. It will have been forgotten that the
war with Spain was ably conducted by a Republican
executive, and that it- first acts were denounced by
Maguire as act- of piracy. In the train of Maguire
will gather Democrats, Populists, Silver Republicans,
â  g of the dissatisfied oi all parties, a mass
â  if imposing character except ;'. c to numbers, and
yet not one to be regarded a- a trifle to be swept
ne faith.
The only effective weapons against the Maguire
ipe will be vote-. These cannot be secured
by putting up a weak man. A weak man cannot be
â  ' _ ainst the combination. Then why not name
rong one? There is plenty oi good material in
tlie Republican party.
OIL AND WATER FUSION.
I~*HE oil of Democracy and water of Populism
may be put into one receptacle and violently
agitated, yet will they refuse to mix. The fusion,
so called, upon which Congressman Maguire depends
for election to the Governorship is a delusion.
( "ircum.stances. as shaping themselves at Sacra
mento, where some Democrats are assembling to
take the Populist pill, show that it is regarded by
them as a bitter dose. The gathering thus far has
been marked by its lack of enthusiasm, and the ab
sence of those faithful old timers who have for, many
campaigns given up their efforts and money for the
success of their party. The few who appear feel that
they have been betrayed. They have been forced into
a combination with Populists against their will, and
resentment is open and palpable.
Their enthusiasm has been killed and their senti
ment is one of disgust. Surh F)emocrats as are try
ing to keep in harness consider themselves engaged in
a hopeless task, the one 'gleam of light being in the
possibility of electing the head of the ticket.
To Populists and Silver Republican?; have been al
lotted a large share of the officers, and yet for a por
tion of those left to the Democrats, the Attorney
General, Surveyor General nnd Secretary of State,
there are no aspirants and search is being made for
the available men.
Candidates do noi care to become such only to be
bowled over. The inference is plain that the Demo
crats ' only to elect the head of the
ticket. Greed for the share of the patronage leads
them to concentrate their endeavors in behalf of
They cannot reconcile themselves to the
lhat the Lieutenant Governorship should have
to the Populists, dreading the contin
â  that in the ev< in of Maguirc's election ' and
death the administration might fall into the hands of
â¢ irty in which they have not and do not pretend
to have confidence.
Here and there a sanguine Democrat explains that
by standing in with the Populists Â«ome of them may
ultimately be won over None goes so far as to say
thai tlri- present combination is desirable or that it is
likely to be effective.
Such iÂ« Fusion as now on exhibition at Sacramento:
the o.\ and the
\ war between Great Britain and Russia over the
Chinese question would mean a pressure upon the old

from the Rritish. The combatants would hardly be
injured, but their mutual friend, China, would come
'â¢ut like a squeezed lemon.

cease talking of contracts for street work and refer to
them all hereafter as contracts for street jobs.

MANILA IS OURS.
SWIFT as were the Spaniards to sue for peace
and accept the terms offered, the redoubtable
Dewey was swifter still, and when the news of
the cessation of hostilities reaches the Philippines the
bearers of it will find our flag above Manila and our
troops in undisputed possession of the capital and all
the province around about it.
The opportunities of this war have been propitious
to Dewey, and he has most grandly shown himself
master of all their possibilities. He struck the first
great blow in the contest, and now he has had the
privilege of striking the last. That which he opened
with victory he has closed with glory. By universal
consent it will be agreed that the highest honors of
the war are rightly his, and a grateful country will
expect Congress to revive for him the rank of ad
miral, which was so honorably borne by the great sea
captains and heroes of the Civil War.
The capture of Manila will have a diplomatic as
well as a military significance. When the Commis
sioners of the two powers come to consider what shall
be done with the Philippines they will begin the dis
cussion upon the basis that the city is ours and the
surrounding islands are virtually so. It will not be
a question whether Spain shall surrender them to us,
but whether we shall return them to Spain. They are
ours now.
This last and closing victory of the war is not
widely different from those which have preceded it.
It is another brilliant feat of arms to illumine our
annals. It affords us another occasion for patriotic
exultation and rejoicing. It crowns the work begun
by the destruction of the Spanish fleet in the harbor
of Manila on May i and places us in a position from
which we can dictate what shall be done with all the
rich islands of the Philippine group.
AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP-
THE Louisville Courier-Journal discusses Ameri
can citizenship in the light of what may occur
in the event of acquisition by this country of
the Spanish colonies.
The Wong Kirn Ark case is quoted. Ark was born
in California, and, having visited China, on his re
turn here was denied landing. He claimed citizenship
by birthright and the Supreme Court gave it to him.
The majority of the court held that undefined parts
of the constitution must be interpreted in the light
of the common law of England, which makes the
birthplace the criterion of nationality. It is thereupon
argued by Chief Justice Fuller and Justice Harlan
that such rule excludes from citizenship a large num
ber of Americans born abroad, whose parents were
not m the consular or diplomatic service. Such per
sons are far greater in number than is commonly sup
posed. The late Charles F. Crisp. Speaker 'of the
House, was born in England, where his parents, who
were play actors, were sojourning on a professional
tour.
While the Ark decision is of importance, because
it makes all children hereafter born in Hawaii citizens
of the United States, as will be those born in any ex
ternal possessions of which we may despoil Spain, it
i- of no less importance if it deny citizenship to
Americans born in sojourn abroad.
The Revised Statutes, section 1993, say: "All chil
dren heretofore born or hereafter born out of the
limits and jurisdiction of the United States whose
fathers were or may be at the time of their birth citi
zens thereof are declared to be citizens of the United
States; but the rights of citizenship shall not descend
to children whose fathers never resided in the United
States."
Section 2\~2 provides that naturalization of the
father naturalizes also his minor children and makes
them citizens of the tinted States.
It will be seen that sections 1993 and 2172 intend to
legalize the descent of citizenship through the father;
in the first case through th: father as a native or
naturalized citizen of the United States whose child
is born abroad, and in the second through the father,
alien born, by his naturalization, to his minor chil
dren alien born.
We are not at present aware of any instance in
which section 1993 has been subjected to a judicial
decision, but section -2172 has been in the courts. The
first case arose in Virginia, and the United States Su
preme Court decision is written by Justice Washing
ton. William Currie. a native of Scotland, was
naturalized in Virginia. His daughter Jeanette was
at that time an infant living in Scotland. At Wil
liam's death his real property descended to Jeanette,
then Mrs. Gordon. The action arose upon an issue
of sufficiency of title, turning upon the descent of citi
zenship to her from her father's naturalization, she
being at that time a resident of Scotland. Justice
Washington held, with the concurrence of the court,
that Jeanette became a citizen of the United States
by the naturalization of her father and capable of in
heritance under the laws of Virginia.
This case was followed by the Circuit Court of
New York in the United States vs. Hirschfield,
though the facts were less extreme than in the Currie
case.
Xow. if the Ark case extend incompetence to sec
tion 1993, it must also invalidate section 2172, which
covers the ca^e of tens of thousands of voters to
whom citizenship descended through their naturalized
fathers. If the place of birth determine nationality,
and, therefore, citizenship, the latter quality can no
more descend through a naturalized than a native
father, and the children of each must be themselves
naturalized
It will be observed that the law has treatei nativity
and naturalization upon precisely equal terms, with a
capacity in each for transmitting citizenship regard
less of birthplace of the child. If this capacity be
denied to one it must be denied to both.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL., TUESDAY, AUGUST 16, 1898.
WHILE there are naturally wide differences of
opinion among the people as to the most ex
pedient course for our Government to pursue
in dealing with the colonies wrested from Spain, it
is notable that there is nowhere any feeling of un
easiness or anxiety. The discussion of the i*su<- is
carried on earnestly indeed, but without excitement,
in all parts of the country. Everywhere there is a
firmly founded confidence that the administration will
guard all the interests of the nation, and that the set
tlement of the problems growing out of the war is in
safe hands.
This feeling of confidence in the President is so
well nigh universal that it forms one oi the salient
characteristics of the political situation. More than
one Democratic convention in the East has expressly
declared its approval of the policy of the administra
tion on all war issues, and time and again at Demo
cratic meetings references to the -Preside! t have been
greeted with cheers. When such expressions come
from political opponents on the eve of a general elec
tion it is evident the country has reached an era of
good feeling.
For this fortunate state of things we are, indebted
chiefly to the personal inthiencv of President
McKinley. He is essentially a hnrmonizcr. In
this respect his character is radically different
from that of his predecessor in the Presidency. While
Cleveland's personality was felt as a disturbing influ
ence even in the ranks of his own party, that of .Mc-
Kinley has been recognized as a conciliating force.
He has thoroughly united all factions in the Republi
can ranks, has done much to eradicate all sectional
antagonisms between North and South, and, as we
now see. has actually .removed much of the bitterness
and excitement from our partisan strife.
The President has accomplished this good work by
the exercise of that kind of tact that is the outgrowth
of a genuine patriotism, a desire to servo the whole
country and a willingness to serve it in accordance
with the public wish. He has not attempted to domi
nate those around him or to enforce his will in every
respect by overriding others, lie has made haste
slowly. He has consulted the sentiment of the nation
at every step, and' as a result has had the great ma>s
of the people at his back and ready fb support him
in all the movements he has made from first to last.
A striking illustration of the President's wisdom
in dealing with the emergencies of the war and one
which shows how closely he keeps in touch with the
sympathies of the people i> to be seen it; the policy
displayed in selecting generals to command the vol
unteer army. There was more than ordinary tact
displayed in the appointment of old Confederates like
Wheeler, Lee and Butler to important commands. It
was an actthat roused the North almost a* much as tin-
South. It gave an impulse to a g/cat wave of fra
ternal feeling throughout the L'nion that completely
swept away the last vestiges of sectional antagonisms
growing out of the war.
We may draw assurance from the past that the
President will not act hastily or unadvisedly in the
settlement of any problem arising from our new re
sponsibilities. He will keep in touch with the com
mon people ns Lincoln did. In that confidence the
country can discuss with calmness the issues that con
front it. knowing that the affairs of the nation are in
safe hands.
GREAT BRITAIN AND RUSSIA.
RUMORS of impending war between Great
Britain and Russia have been common in the
world for so long a time that the memory of
man runneth not to the contrary. Ju^t before our war
with Spain began these rumors were of the most
startling nature, and it seemed from them as if hos
tilities between tiie rival powers in China would break
out and be finished before the Cuban question had
passed from the hands pf diplomatists,
While we were lighting we heard little of the ru
mors. There was no time for them. Now that peace
is at hand they return again. The thread is taken up
just where it was dropped about four months ago.
We arc now assured that war between Great Britain
and Russia will break out before the end of autumn
with as much fervor and force of argument a- we
were t<>ld last winter that it would break out before
spring ended. It is the old story told in the old way
and having little of new reasons to sustain it.
Of course there is a basis of fact for these reports
to rest upon. In this, as in all things else where there
is so much smoke, there must be some fire. With
certain kinds of material, however, such as wet straw,
it does not take much of a spark to cause a vast
smoke, and the fuel from which the war rumors come
is very wet straw indeed. The Chinese question i
one of those vast insoluble problems over which/dip
lomatists may wrangle for years without reaching the
fighting point. There arc babies now playing in the
nurseries of London and St. Petersburg who will
grow up, become diplomatists, wax fat. rich, gray
headed and then retire, leaving the controversy still
unsettled.
The talk of war is largely a matter of British poli
tics. The opponents of Salisbury will make Great
Britain how) with denunciations of hi; "cowardly
policy." his "truckling to Russia" and his "surrender
of British interests'' in the East until they get him out
of office. Then a Liberal Ministry will assume charge
ot the Government, draw the salaries of Cabinet offi
cers, distribute the patronage and continue the same
old foreign policy. Rosebery is not more likely to
make war than Salisbury. The denunciations of
Russian aggression in London are aimed less at the
Russians that at the British citizen whose vote is
wanted against the Government.
As a matter of fact the British seem to have gained
more in China than Russia, Germany and France
combined. The Russians have the advantage <>f posi
tion simply because they are reaching China by an
overland route, and the annexation of Chinese terri
tory is a part of the natural expansion of their em
pire. The British wish trade, and the Russians wish
land. The interests of the tiro are not ?o opposite as
they seem. F.ach will use the other as an excuse for
invading Chinese soil or controlling Chinese, trade,
but there is no imperative reason why they should
fight just yet. and they are not likely to do so unless
some cog in the diplomatic machine breaks and pre
cipitates a crisis so suddenly that the statesmen on
one or possibly both sides will lose their heads.
It is asserted that Great Britain has decided to take
a decided step in China, but it is not yet certain
whether it will be forward, backward or a step aside.
A candid expression of opinion from Blanco would
be read with interest, but the trouble is that Blanco
does not know how to be candid.

IN SAFE HANDS.
PERSONAL EQUATION IN NAVAL WARFARE.
Admiral Sicard, In command of the North Atlantic squadron, broke
down a few months ago, and had to relinquish his command. Captain
Clark, after making his famous voyage from coast to coast with the Ore
gon, after annihilating the Spanish fleet off Santiago, has succumbed to the
nervous strain, and has been invalided home. Captain Gridley of the Olym
pia died after the Manila fight.
Those are only a few of the nvu'.y instances in which naval officers,
even during the present brief w;ir. h; ye found that the burden of respon
sibility laid upon them was greater than their system would bear. It is
an object lesson which we cannot affori to neglect.
The world, or, rather, the only portion of it which we need consider,
represented by the great nav.il powers, has stood breathlessly aloof,
watching the conflict between tire, United states and Spain. Everything
was to be learned from the actual experience of warfar. ; all doubts as to
the relative merits of puns and armor, of battleships and cruis <r:3, of tor
pedo-boats and destroyers, w?rÂ« to be set at rtst at our expense. For a
generation the machinists and theorists of every nation have exhausted
their Inventive faculties in order to produce the ideal fighting ship; types
varying in the wiriest degree have been created Ky different powers, yet
none had the ability to predict how their vessels would behave in actual
conflict. The war has come and gone, the struggle has passed throHgh
Its many brilliant phases and is now nearing Its 'glorfoue end, and the na
val constructors of the world are but little the wiser. That more has not
been learned Is not our fault, yet we. have reason to bÂ« thankful that the
utt<r inefficiency of our adversary on the sea has preser\ed many a valua
ble life to America.
The world-old answer has been read to our question. It is the man and
not the ship which wins the battle. The Romans, when theysfought their
many oared galleys on the Mediterranean, and triumphed over their oppon
ents, knew it. The Norse Vikings, when they swept the northern seas, and
gave to the Anglo-Saxon race for all time its birthright of naval
knew it. Drake and Frobisher and Hawkins, all the old Elizabethan sea
lions, when they harried the don in his hold and swept his mighty armada
like spume from the face of the sea, knew it. Blake and Rodney and N !
son, Paul Jones. Bainbridge and Decatur, they all impressed upon their
foes, time and again, the same immutable law. Still later, during the war
between the United States and England, we learned that when vessels
were manned by men of the same race, the results of the desperate cÂ« n
fliet depended more upon chance than upon any actual superiority in size
or guns.
It is difficult now to understand why we expected anything- different
from the present war. Captain Mahan has taught us that although steam,
and armor have superseded canvas and wood, the principles of naval strat
egy remain unchanged. Yet there were many leading- critics, especially
on the other .side of the Atlantic, whu expressed grave doubts as to the
result <>f a struggle between our ships and those of Spain. Theoreti
cally, tin- fighting machines of Spain were just as good as ours, some of
their truis.rs were even faster and more modern, their guns were- of the
latest pattern, and they had the advantage of using smokeless instead of
the Obsolete black powder with which, to the disgrace of our administra
tion, the United States navy is still supplied. Further, the Spaniards- pos
ian arm in which we were entirely deficient. They had a number
of tnodern torpedo destroyers, the fastest type of vessel in the world, from
which much was expected. Yet no use was made by the don of his advan
tage; in every case it was the man, and not the ship, which won the bat
tle. As a result, the vaunted navy of Spain now consists mostly of old iron,
piled up on tin- beaches or sunk beneath thÂ»- waters of two hemispheres.
Thus, as always, everything depends upon the man, and by the man
I mean more especially the man in command. The accuracy of our gun
ners, the gallantry of the sailors who man the guns, is not in question
Tt is the commander of the ship, the man upon whom the whole re
sponsibility tor a successful issue culminates, whom we have to consider.
The question we have to face is whether we have not reached the outside
limits of human endurance, whether the personal equation, which remains
always a fixed Quality, has not been overbalanced by the complexity of
modern mechanism. Appliances undreamed of by our forefathers have
been CTOW^ed into our ships. The cares of a commander have been multi
plied ;l thousand fold. Yet it is doubtful whether the nervous organisa
tion of the fin de siecle sailor, weakened by an overrefined civilization, is
as strong as that of his simple bred forefather of a century past.
Who ever heard of one of Nelson's captains breaking down owing to
the nervous strain forced upon him by a successful naval action? Did Paul
Jones collapse after he had captured the Serapis, or did Bainbridge have
to be Invalided home when he had successfully disposed of the Barbary
Coast pirates? No. The men of those days, unless they had the misfor
tune to !>â â  wounded in action, finished in style, tit and fresh for another
engagement as si>on as the enemy reappeared. The old sailing ship, it
must be remembered, was a very simple, albeit perfect machine. She had
been evolved by centuries of experience, until the types of war vessels had
become absolutely fixed. Every sailor knew exactly what his ship might be
expected to do, ar.d knew how to do it in the simplest and easiest way.
without the necessity for any mental exertion on his part. He knew, also,
exactly what the enemy would do and how to defeat his maneuvers. The
i . st was easy, the captain had only to unleash his sea dogs, and the side
which knew how to fight best won the day.
It was an admirably simple state of affairs, and the pfty of it is that
the conditions have passed forever. The modern captain who takes his
ironclad into action has to face a widely different situation. He is hand
ling a huge, excessively complicated machine, the fighting capacity of
which has never been really tested. The organism is almost human in
its sensibility. Every one of the hundred branching nerves which direct
the action of the ship has to be controlled by the master brain. And it
is this man, shut up in his narrow conning tower, whom we have to rely
upon (dr victory. Through the slits in the armored structure he .can com
mand but a limited view. He knows that at any moment a well aimed
shell from the enemy may blow him into fragments. He has to control
voice pipes and telegraphs leading to every part of the ship. A single
false onler on his part may mean destruction for his vessel, if not annihi
lation for his crew.
Have we a right to expect that the delicate, nervous organization of
any human being will withstand such a strain for long? It is true that
at Manila Dewey, with his officers around him, fought his ships from the
open vantage of the bridge. But it was a risk that it would have been
criminal to take against a skilled enemy. One well aimed shell might
have destroyed the admiral and his staff, the whole brains of the fleet. It
is due alone to Spanish incompetency that such a shell did not arrive-.
In one of the best imaginative descriptions of a modern naval battle yet
written, the captain who fights his ship from the conning tower finds, after
the successful issue of the action, that his hair has turned white from
nervous strain. In real warfare the experience is likely to repeat itself.
Even in times of peace we see that the responsibility of commanding a
great Beet may upset the stoutest brain. In no other way can we account
tdr Admiral Tryon's terrible blunder in the Mediterranean, when a foolish
order cost her Majesty one "f her finest ironclads, and the lives of hundreds
ot her bravest sailors and marines. If this could happen in' peace, what
might not we expect during the heat and excitement of war? Wherein lies
the remedy? It is not for the layman to decide this point. but it is quite
evident that, to meet modern requirements, a new departure is nei
Some way must be devised of subdividing the responsibility, some means
whereby several brains instead of a single one may be Intrusted with the
care ol controlling our great fighting machines. The task has outgrown
the capacity of one man, and we have yet to learn how we can with safety
intrust it to many. j. p. ROSE-SOLEY.

CALL IT "MURPHY BREAD."
How Maize Flour Is Used by the
Bakers of Germany.
Mr. Murphy gives the following par
ticulars of the new bread, which is well
known in Germany and America:
This bread is made of a mixti;:
33 per cent white maize flour, and (i.
per cent of wheat or rye. In Europe
it was first adopted in Germany, ii.
the year of the failure in the .
As to-day we are in an analogous
uation, the present wheat crop- being
50,000,000 hundredweight less than our
needs, it is of interest to know that
white malse flour <-an supply the want,
In giving to the public a far more nu
tritive bread, bettor in taste and at a
far cheaper price than bread made of
all wheat flour. This bread wiil keep
fresh longer, for maize is more absorb
ent than wheat, it is a delicious bread
and excessively tine. ThÂ«? bakt
America made this bread, recomm-nd- 9
by Colonel Murphy of the I'
States Department of Agriculture.
The problem of a cheap bread seems
thus to be solved. The baker can sell
this bread at lv centimes cheaper p< r
loaf of four pounds than the loaf of the
same weight made entirely of wheat,
for the targe sack of maize flour â¢
about 30 francs less than the same size
sa'k of wheat Hour.
The following are the natural advan
tages of this bread, recommended by
Mr. Murr>hy: A remarkable property
of maize Hour to absorb a great quan
tity of water (about the double of
wheat ilourv in consequence this bread
keeps fresh longer, while the bak^r
pets more bread out of it. Maize is
a cereal extremely nourishing. Maize
when it is nut determinated has a dis
agreeable taste, that in such an in
stance would be communicated to the
In-. -ad. Th- grain must be submitted to
a certain i>r.H-ess for degerminaUon,
then the Hour has no longer the dis
agreeable taste referred to. Dr. Du
jardin-Beaninetz says in his book
"Hygtene Alimentaire" that maize is
tin- most nourishing, that it occupies
tin- tirst place, on account of the fatty
matter it contains, and it Is easily to
be understood the present tendency to
substitute in pa^t wheat Hour by thai
,->f maiz â . Mivr-d maize bread has liKhr.
laxative properties, which will be ap
tireciated by the inhabitants of cities.
This American bread gives a perfect
digestion. In Berlin sixty-five special
bakeries make this mixed maize bread.

/Luzon' sailed this morning for Spain,
haVingr on board 2136 Spanish soldiers.

The embarkation of the prisoners is
being pushed with great activity. This
Is rendered imperative by their horrible
condition. The mortality is so great
in the Spanish camp, where disease is
rampant, that no longer are the dead
buried. A funeral pile of ten or twelve
bodies is made, saturated with kero

The Tivoli.
"Lohengrin" sealed the stamp of public
approval upon the Tivoli's venture into
grand opera. The costuming was superb,
the scenery beautiful and the chorus one
of the best that has been heard in San I
Francisco in many a day. The principals
were almost without exception, all that
could be desired. Coupled with this was
ah overflowing bouse, which was more
than satisfied with the performance
Among the principals Miss Mary Unck
as Ortrud. the wife of Telramund. carried
off the honors. She is a capable actress
and this, with a rich, sweet voice, enabled
her to portray the part of the scheming
wife of Telramund delightfully. Miss
Anna LichU-r. who played the arduous
role of Elsa of Brabant, has a very sweet,
wen-balanced voice, but it Is hardY pow
erful enough for the dramat c role she as
sumed last night. This criticism also holds
true in the case of Rhys Thomas, who
played the part of Lohengrin.
SlÂ«. Maurice de Vries was particularly
â¢ good aa Telramund, the unscrupulous no- i
, ble. In the scene with Ortrud. where
i they planned the undoing of Elsa by
1 making her suspicious of Lohengrin, he
was particularly strong. In fact, it was
I the best piece ot netlng and singing in ;

BEGISTBATION IS LIGHT.
The Total Figures Are Ten Thousand
Less Than Those of the Last
Presidential Election.
Although there was quite a rush at the
precinct stations yesterday, the sum total
of registration has been remarkably light.
There has been a general and unac
countable laxity manifested throughout
the city which has driven politicians
frantic. Warnings have been sent out
from time to time, but they were wasted.
j and when the books are finally made out
it will be seen that thousands have will
ingly forfeited their votes. Two years ago
there were 73,000 on the rolls, but this
year's list will be at least 10,000 short of
that figure. Registration has been heavi
est in the heart of the Mission, and it is
also observable that in the districts where
the heaviest registration was expected
there is the greatest falling off.
Registrar liiggy is at a loss to account
for this, but attributes it chiefly to lack
of interest in the campaign generally.
People have been so busy talking war and
laying plans for the demolition of the
army and navy of Spain that they have
i forgotten all about the election.
The work of purging the roll will be be-
K un as soon as possible, and Mr. l?iggy
promises a dean register. "The best
' experts in my office will be put to work
on it " he Bays> "and the people may be
assured of a dean list. The report that I
am in possession of evidence showing that
colonization h^ taken place in some dis
tricts is untrue; but if any evidences
i nolnting toward colonization are discov-
I ered a rigid investigation will be made."
ALLEGED CONFERENCE
HELD IN SANTIAGO
Garcia Said to Have Been Pres
ent and Agreed to Disband
His Army.
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 15.â A
secret meeting was held to-night at
the palace between the commanding
officers of the American army and the
Cuban leaders. The strictest secrecy
was maintained, but it can be said
with good authority that general Gar
cia was present. The meeting lasted
!,' hour and a half. The information
obtained is to the effect that the Cv
i ban situation was thoroughly reviewed.
I and 'it was resolved to disband the
Cuban army and the United States
should pay the men off. This involves
the expenditure of $15,000,000, but it is
most important to the prosperity of the
island of which the wealth is almost
entirely agricultural, nobody daring to
cultivate his lands while the insurgent
ban<:s are in the fields raiding and
burning.
The Herald's Washington corre
spondent says: The report of the se
cret conference in Santiago and the
decision to disband the insurgent army

The American barkentlne C. C. Funk
has been wrecked on Flinders Island, off
the coast of Tasmania, and of the above
people who were aboard, only two were
saved. Among the drowned was the cap
tain and his family.
The C. C. Funk left Tacoma on May 22
with a cargo of lumber for Melbourne,
Australia, and this was Captain NlsÃen's
first voyage In her. He was formerly
master of the Mary Winkelman and trad
ed in her between here and Honolulu. He
left the Winkelman after purchasing the
old bark Rosalie, and ran that vessel In
the inter-Island trade until the Hawaiian
Government condemned her. Captain Nis
sen then brought hip family to San Fran
cisco. He learned that Captain Charles
ton wanted to sell his share of the C. C.
Funk In order to go to the Klondike, so.
as the commanu of the harkentine went
with the sale, Nlssen made the purchase
through W. F. Schultze of South San
Francisco.
The C. C. Funk was the prettiest and
best-known barkentine owned on the Pa-
cific Coast. Nevertheless she was never
a financial success. She was built in 1882
and Captain Glasser was her ilrst com
mander. He remained by her until the
day of his death, and then Captain
Charleston was appointed master. A case
is now pending against her in the courts
at Honolulu. Soon after leaving that port
she was dismasted in a gale and was
towed tv safety by one of the Wilder line
of steamers. When being taken to an
anchorage the hawser parted and one of
the crew wan knocked down by the recoil
and crippled for life. He is now suing for
damages. The Funk was partially re
rigged at Honolulu and then came to San
Francisco, where she was fully repaired.
It was after this that she started on the
voyage that has ended so fatally.
Captain Nlssen was a native of Ger
many and 46 years old. He came to Cali
fornia over twenty-five years ago and for
twenty years has been in command of
San Francisco owned vessels. He has no
relatives living. His wife was 36, his son
Harry 9 and his daughter Rosalie 6 years
old. The l.ark Rosalie, which Captain
Nlssen commanded for so many years,
was named after his little daughter. Mrs.
Nlssen's only relative in this country is
her sister. Miss Stofer, who is now living
ut Tamalpais.
Of the crew given above all the men
may not have sailed from the Sound on
the vessel. They left here on her, but
some may have deserted at Tacoma, and
others may have been put in their places
at the last moment. It Is known that
the two mates and the cook sailed on
the vessel.
There is trouble on the Mall Company's
steamer City of Sydney. On the voyage
to Manila the crew was not properly fed,
and In consequence some of the men
nearly died of dysentery. Yestenlay
twenty-two of the firemen and nearly
all the deck hands quit work, and in con
sequence the vessel is nearly deserted.
The men say they were given rotten
meat to eat and bad water to drink, and
were expected to do a full day's work
on it. All of them assert that they will
never work on the Sydney again.
The schooner Occidental arrived yes
terday from Eureka after a remarkably
fast run of thirty hours. This is steam
boat time.
Large Is Insane.
J. R. Large, who resided at 460 Bryant
street, was committed to the asylum for
the insane at Agnews yesterday. Large
was an usher in the Central Methodist
Church for many months and he annoyed
many of the congregation by writing
them voluminous letters on "scientific"
and other topics. A bale of these letters
was introduced In evidence against the
unfortunate man. They contained all va
rieties of jargon, which the writer termed
"scientific and literary" essays.

SUPERVISORS
DO NOT UPHOLD
THE MAYOR
Stand for the Original
Lighting Contract.
ROTTANZI DECLARES HIMSELF
HIS SEAT IN THE BOARD IS
CHALLENGED.
The Juggled Contract for Repairing
and Repaying Bituminized
Streets Rushed Through
by the Ring.
The Board of Supervisors pushed
through the juggled contract for repair
ing and repaying bituminized streets, de
spite the kicks of the amall minority of
the board. It was the old story over
again, the useless objections of a few out
side the solid ring, the lame rejoinder of
some spokesman of the gang and the final
vote that consummated the act.
As a preliminary to the proceedings of
the afternoon the board wrestled with the
problem of city lighting. The board had
settled the matter once before by award
ing the contract .to the only gas and
electric light company which had been
allowed to do business in the city. The
Mayor had, however, vetoed the award,
on the ground that a chance should have
been given the Mutual Electric Company
to do the lighting, provided that the pro
moters backed up their proposition to do
the city lighting for $40,000 less per year
than the other company, and. moreover,
saved the citizens of San Francisco an
additional $100,000 annually on private
lighting bills. The Mayor said that the
new rival company offered a sufficient
guarantee.
There was a heated discussion. Seve
ral of the Supervisors fought for the priv
ilege of the floor. The Mayor insisted
that Dr. Kottanzi should be heard, and
when order was in a measure restored
the Supervisor, in a moat vigorous man
ner, said:
â¢'Mr. Mayor, there is one feature of your
veto of the lighting contract that, in my
humble opinion, is utterly ridiculous."
The Mayor looked startled, not knowing
what was coming next. "It was ridicu
lous, sir, to ask this board to defer an
award of the lighting contract until the
mandamus proceedings, now pending in
court, are settled. Perhaps your Honor
has had some experience with the courts
of justice. It will as likely as not be
three years before a decision is handed
down from the court of last resort. Do
you want San Francisco to wait three
years for light?"
The question of over-riding the Mayor's
veto ot the light contract came up in di
rect form. Dr. Clinton objected. He said
that it was the duty of the Supervisors
to make the best. possible bargain for the
city. There were some plain facts pre
sented. Two rival companies, each fully
responsible, were willing to do the city
lighting. One wanted more than the
other. Why not save the difference and
give the contract to the lowest bidder?
As for Dr. Hottanzi, it was to be hoped
that he would stand up like an honest
man and vote to uphold the Mayor's
veto.
This was too much for Rottanzi. He
came to his feet with a bound. "Does
the Supervisor say honest? Honest, I
say? My past is honest: i have nothing
to conceal. My past has not the taint of
the demagogue. I have never had a hand
in jobs in this Board! Yet there has been
an attempt upon the part of a newspaper
in this city to coerce me into voting as
its editor wishes on the lighting question.
It threatens me if I do not follow its dlo
tation and vote against my convictions.
Now, I did not intend to come here at all
to-day to vote either way, as I hau im
portant private business that needed my
attention. But when I found out that
this newspaper, the Examiner, was try
ing to boss me, I ca,me to vote as I
pleased, which is against the dictation of
that sheet! It is thoroughly rotten to the
core. Who appointed it a dictator over
me, an honest man? The association of
the Examiner's name with my own is a
stench in my nostrils. Who is the manag
ing editor of the dirty sheet? I would
not care to compare him to myself. I am
a gentleman! If he tries in future to im
pugn my motives In any way he must
settle personally with me!"
"I still think you will stand up as an
honest maÂ«," said Clinton.
"That's rank demagogy!" replied
Rottanzi. "The Supervisor from the
Eleventh knows It, too, when he makes
such a remark. As for the Mayor. I wish
to remind his Honor that he signed a con
tract for the lighting of the public build
ings when I showed him how it could be
done one-half cheaper. I was surprised.
Now he comes and vetoes the .award of
the city lighting. There Is too much dic
tation. Again I wish to state that when
the Examiner tries any of its yellow tac
tics on me it makes a great mistake. I
will stand no more of it. Any further
attempt in that line will get the responsi
ble party into trouble."
"Do I understand you to threaten some
body's life?" asked the Mayor.
"I mean what I say!" retorted the
angry doctor. :
Dodge then took his turn. "I'm opposed
to the contract as awarded," he said.
"The job has been rushed through. It
doesn't require any perception to see that
the committee Juggled the proposals so
that no opposition bid could be made. "We
all understand the merits of this contro- ]
versy. We know what the past ten
dency of this board has been. I'm ready
to sustain the Mayor's veto and make an
end of it."
"If I was in favor of the erection of an
other set of poles," broke in Supervisor
Britt, "I would vote to sustain the
Mayor's veto. It is too late now to re
vise our work. The contract is awarded.
We cannot remedy any mistake that has
been made. Had there been no veto there
would have been no opposition either in
the newspapers or in this board. The
Mayor on the last. day discovered that
somebody had been unjustly treated.
Now we are giving out the contract at a
loss price than former boards. We are
not, therefore, as bad as them. The
proper time for a kick was when the sub
ject was up before the Supervisors."
The question of permitting the Mutual
Electric Company to erect poles came to
the front and was defeated by an 8 to 4
vote. â  'â '.' 'â¢'â 'â¢"
The vote on the Mayor's veto was called
and only three of the Supervisors sus
tained the chief executive.
When the vote overriding the Mayor
was announced the reply of his Honor
was quick. "I challenge the right of Dr.
Rottanzi to sit or vote in this board," he
said, "as he holds two public offices of
profit and is therefore ineligible."
Having disposed of several minor mat
ters, the board settled down to the con
sideration of bids for repairing and re
paying bituminized streets.
"We will not have to repave all of those
streets mentioned in the specifications,"
said Supervisor Smith. "We had better
go slow and not award the contract under
the present arrangements. I favor re
advertlslng for bids and giving an exact
schedule of streets to be repaved. We
can cut the number down very much. If
we have any money to spend it can better
be applied in getting rid of the old cobble
stones than in tearing up pavements that
are comparatively good and that will last
for years."
Lackmann sided with Smith, and said:
"Bingham as a bidder wants it under
stood that he doesn't consider it neces
sary to repave many of the streets men
tioned, and that he expects, if he gets the
contract, tc keep them in repair under his
$23,000 bid and â  only to repave such as
really need it. He states that the total
cost to the city will be far . less than
$50,000. as claimed."
"We should reject all bids and readver
tlse," suggested Supervisor Lackmann.
"I found- the crossing at Stelner and
Haight to-be Intact. Was that not in
cluded under the specifications for re
paying?" asked the Mayor. , : Â« - : .
â  "I ; cannot recall. But the pavements
in many places are rolling and need re
placing. â No extra , amount of money, will
be . needed for ; the work," replied Super
visor Devany, .
"Well, money will not be spent on those
Btrooto if we do not do the work. I know
tHat the croÃflinÃ at California and Front
1b In perfect condition, yet it is mentioned
In the Bpeciflcutlons an In need of repair,"
said Supervisor Lackmann.
The contract, on a vote, was awarded to
the City Street Improvement Company on
Its bid of $37,797 for repairs and repavlng,
the Committee on Streets to be the Judge
of the work necessary to be performed.
Mayor Phelan haa not stated what ac
tion he will take, but a veto Is regarded as
probable. In the discussion he did not
favor tne award under the specifications.

A THOUSAND NEW NAMES.
OAKLAND, Aug. is.â it was estimated
that when the Great Register of Alameda
County was closed at midnight the ap
proximate number of names enrolled was
an Increase over the last enrollment of
1000. allowing for 4500 cancellations. The
transfers from one precinct to another
are estimated by County Clerk Jordan at
7000 to 8000, which was equivalent to reg
istering 20,000 names.
In addition to the work the County
Clerk has placed a supplementary regis
ter at each polling-place for the accom
modation of voters at county primaries.
He is now engaged on a similar one to
be used at the Congressional primaries.
The only assistance asked of the party
managers is that they furnish type
writers to transcribe affidavits of regis
tration.
Two registrations prior to Clerk Jor
dan's term cost this county about $17,000
in addition to the regular salary allow-
Lost His Life Saving Others.
A country boy visiting New York stopped a
frantic runaway team that was about to dash
on the sidewnlk where there were hundreds of
women and children. He saved their lives, but
lost his own. Hundreds of lives are saved every
year by Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. People
who are fast going to their graves with disor
ders of stomach, liver, bowels and blood are
brought back to good health by it. All the
sick should try it.

ance. Mr. Jordan has attended to the
two registrationsâ one absolutely new of
37,000 names, and this one Is equal to an
other new register of 20,000 namesâwith
out a dollar of assistance from the coun
ty. Out of his $16,000 yearly salary the
Clerk must pay all his deputies.
Relief has been denied by the Board of
Supervisors, under advice of District At
torney Snook, on the ground that the act
passed by the last Legislature granting
such relief was vetoed by Governor Budd.

Lady. I gave a handful of Ripans Tabules to an old gentleman of'
Brooklyn, and he- said their effect upon him has bees
most remarkable.
Friend. What was the matter with him, anyway ?
L. He is a weigher, and works about the wharves and ware-
houses. He said that always after eating he would bo
troubled with gases, and there would be a sensation as
of a load on the pit of his stomach which made him
very uncomfortable.
P. Well, what good did the Ripans do him?
X* I don't know how they did it, but he says they were effect-
ive from the start, and he was surprised to see how
quickly one would give him relief. I think it is quito
remarkable, for he is a confirmed dyspeptic and hÂ«
positively sneered when I gave him the Ripans. H*
didn't seem to think anything could reach his case.

Vancouver, Aug. 15.â Great Brit
. Bin is evidently not going: to be behind
; in the matter of '^reparations for
ible trouble with Russia In the
â  East. Some days aero it was reported
In The Call â and the report was net de
â  niedâ that the Canadian Pacific Rail
steamships Tartar and Athenian
being held here for the purpose
.of carrying large bodies of troops to
â  'rient. Now, according to an of
; : â '. ficer on th^ flagship Imperieus", at
it in the harbor, six BritNh war
- will be added to the Ni rth Pa
cific squadron, and will be on the coast
: in a short time. The officer said this
...fact was very significant, in v.
.; Russia's hostile front in the East.
'-. â¢ The addition of thes- I > the
: coast fleet is entirely unexpected. Word
.: was received, it is understood, just
prior to the Imperleuse s departure
..; from Esquimalt, and when it leaked
'.out. it caused no little excJt
arii< ing the Mien.
. : : Coming on the top of these very bus- ;
preparations is the report

â  of the Canadian Pacific Railroad

: 'â¢ â â¢order to rush the work on a large num

: known that in case of trouble in the
.East thousands of troops would be sent
'out to the cast over the Canadian Pa

dently leaving: no loopholes in case of
emergency.
Th" tars on the Imperfeuse look for

Controversy Over the Prevention of
Coolie Immigration to the
Islands Brought to a.
Final Close.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU. Aug. 2.â At the request of
the United States Government Hawaii
has compromised the Japanese claim by
th<- payment of $75,000. The President and
Cabinet felt this to be a very humiliating
return for annexation, but the polite but
Imperative suggestion of the American
Minister that this claim must be removed
from the road before Admiral Miller
could hoist the American flag, was re
garded by the Executive Council and the
Council of State as sufficient reason for
voting the amour* although they denied
the justice of the claim.
The meeting was held on Wednesday.
July 27. the day after the Doric's sailing
and was presided over by President Dole;
the Cabinet, ten Councilors out of the lif
i teen, and Minister F. ML Hatch, wire
present. The President called for the
reading of the resolution adopted by the
Executive Council, to the effect that in
view of the Hawaiian Government having
been requested by the United States Gov
ernment to dispose of the matters In con
troversy between Hawaii and the Govern
ment of Japan before the sovereignty of
this country is transferred to the United
States, and the Executive Council, deem
ing the matter one of great public emer
gency, requests the authority of the
Council of State for paying to Japan the
sum of $75,000 in full payment of that
country's claims, but without in any man
ner waiving tht- conviction of the Govern
ment that it was right in resisting the
claims of Japan according to the facts
and principles of the rase.
In discussing the resolution the Presi
dent said that while the payment of these
claims was very humiliating to his Gov
ernment, yet at the request of the United
i States, and to facilitate annexation, the
Council had decided to yield, without.
however, admitting that tho Government
was in the wrong. He invited Minister
Hatch to make a statement before the
correspondence with Minister Sewall was
read.
Mr. Hatch reported a conversation that
he had had with Secretary of State Day,
who expressed his regret at the circum
stances dictating a compromise, but there
were reasons of state for making It, and
the request was not meant in any way
to bear the construction that Hawaii was
in the wrong. It was very desirable on
the part of the United States that tne
controversy should be determined before
the transfer of sovereignty.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Cooper
sjioke in justification of th>: course of the.
Government. It was, indeed, humiliating
to him to compromise the matter, but,
under the circumstances, it was wiser for
th-- Government to yield. After all, the
settlement was a compromise at half the
amount claimed, and small In comparison
with the probable expense to the. country
"I" arbitration proceedings. The Minister
then read the following letter from Min
lat< r Bewail:
LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,
ronolum*. h. l, July 26, iws.
Honorable Henry E. Cooper, Minister of
F"rtip: : Affairs. Honoluluâ Sir: I have
the honor to Inform you that I have re
ceived instructions from my Government
expressing anxiety to secure an immedi
ate solution nf the question at issue be
tween Hawaii and Japan whereby the
approaching transfer of Hawaiian terri
tory would )<â¢â  fried from any ultimate
questions* tending to embarrass it in its
dealings with a third power.
The instructions assume that to this end
and as the only means of accomplishing
it, your Government will close the inci
dent by tli>- payment to Japan of a rea
sonable Indemnity.
It is not to be understood that thiscourse
of action is urged by thf-Government of the
United States on any other grounds than
as a necessary preliminary to the formal
transfer of sovereignty which is now
awaited.
The instructions make it clear that
until this action is taken by Hawaii a
serious obstacle will exist tv the execu
tion of the instructions whl'h Rear Ad
miral Miller may bring to me ft t any
time. I do not need to point out to you
how unfortunate from every point of
view would be further delay i n effect
ing the consummation which both our
Governments so earnestly wish.
My instructions are imperative to do all
1 can to bring about as speedily as pos
sible this desired adjustment.
Under all the circumstane. r, and hav
ing regard to common interests, I ven
ture to express the hope that you will
lose no time in securing the compliance
of the Hawaiian executive with the views
of the Government at Washington.
I have the honor to b^ sir, your obadi
ent servant, HAROLD M. SEWALL.
Minister Cooper's reply, agreeing to the
Davment only because of the United
States' insistence, also was read
Other speakers followed In the same
strain as the previous speaker, and on
motion of P- C. Jones and Speaker Kau
lukou the money was ordered paid.
Councilor John Philips brought up the
ouestion of the British claimants for com
pensation for illegal imprisonment in 0895.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1898.
He obtained but small satisfaction. In
asmuch as Minister Cooper told him that
It was time enough to cross a bridge when
you come to it. and that there was no ne
cessity of acting on them ; the Attorney
General added, in his blandest manner,
that the British Government was able to
look after itself, and President Dole
joined in by saying that the only reason
for compromising the Japanese claims
was because the United States had re
quested their payment.
And now we are all moralizing in a
very subdued manner over the irony of
diplomacy which compels us to pay $75,000
for being right, simply to oblige our very
great and good friend who has kindly
agreed to relieve us of all future inter
national complications, but before doing
so gives us a gentle spanking for daring
to speak to a bigger boy and running the
risk of a beating.
It is all over, and Shimamura and
Hoshi have outwitted Dole and Cooper.
â¢ The transports have all left us, but we
expect the St. Paul hourly. The City of
Puebla was in a rilthy condition, but has
been thoroughly cleansed. She takes on
board twenty-one cases of convalescent
measles which had much better been left
a few days longer at our quarantine
station. Nothing but praise can be ac
corded to the Rio and her officers and
men. They almost rivaled perfection In
every respect.
There has been an immense deal of local
comment, and deservedly so, In regard to
the other three transports of this expe
dition; but, taking everything into con
sideration, the men have behaved extra
ordinarily well under the circumstances.
It is undoubtedly true that they have In
vaded private premises and consumed
private property and have occasionally
been a trifle undisciplined. It is sauiy
true, also, that many of them were penni
less and sold their underclothing, shoes
and personal property for food which they
could not obtain on board ship: and It is
also very true that never before has Ha
waiian hospitality been so taxed or so
cheerfully given by hundreds of private
individuals, Hawaiians and foreigners as
well as Americans, as during the past
week or so; but some allowance must also
be made for the circumstances surround
ing Inexperienced control â  and manage
ment and the honest record must be
made that no country could have Bent
into a little weakling land like Hawaii
10 000 or 15,000 men of all grades of char
acter and social position who could have
behaved better than have the United
States regulars and volunteers.
Nor could there have been found a finer
body of men physically. Analyze the pro
rata of death and sickness and remember
the crowded transports and changed con
dition of living and note how small that
proportion is. Why. in healthy Hawaii
our local death rate last month was at
the annual rate of 65 per 1000 (an unusual
ly large one), and yet out of nearly 15,000
troops the deaths can be counted almost
on the lingers of thetand^

ABOARD THE RIO DE JANEIRO,
Honolulu Harbor, Aug. 2.â Our ship
swings idly at anchor, while the light |
of a rising moon glitters across the bay I
and casts black shadows from the other
ships. This afternoon we cast loose
from the shore and early to-morrow
morning the Pennsylvania and Rio
start on the long 5000 miles of tropical
ocean travel for the Philippines. It
seemed hard to realize in the midst of
the quiet beauty of this tropical night
that grim business is probably ahead
of us. The transports are full of the
sounds of laughter and song. The
! kindly spirit of this land of sunshine
j and flowers seems to have entered into
the men. During our brief stay here
all has been joyous and generous.
I There have been smiles and welcome
everywhere for officers and men alike.
While out with a party of men for
signal practice yesterday we stopped
in an open bit of ground, where the hill
upon which the utht-r party was sta
tioned was plainly visible. A crowd
of native boys and girls soon assembled
and they were followed by their elders. |
Soon a pail of ice water was brought.
Then came native fruits in profusion.
Then the women brought the circular
wreaths of flowers, and soon the men
were wreathed in flowers. All of it
waÃ done with such a lovely, simple
grace that it was irresistible. And
we of northern birth were taught a les
son in artless good nature and gener
osity.
From the drill we marched to the
banquet, where the ladles of Honolulu
had spread a flower crowned feast for
the men of the Rio. The palace
grounds, where the shaded tables were
laid, was filled with men whom eight
days of crowded transport life had
given a keen appreciation of fresh
fruits and the lighter articles of food,
for, although our men were well fed
on the transport, the menu is neces
sarily somewhat limited, when the
utensils consist of a meat ration pan,
tin cup and knife and fork. Here, in
the midst of palms and strange flower
ing trees, with the band playing and j
waited on by the ladies of Honolulu,
the men had a feast which must have
j touched the most prosaic with its
J beauty and novelty. The officers were
| nicely entertained at the Officers' Club
i on the palace grounds.
There is something in this island
paradise which robs men of all rest- (
lessness and makes the panoply of war i
seem absurd. If war consisted of
moonlight concerts by the band, ban
quets adorned with fruits and flowers
and the pleasing evolutions of march
ing, I grant that Hawaii is eminently
fitted for it.
Beautiful, kindly land! As I look at
these quiet cottages standing back from
the streets in their tropical gardens, I
can well understand why one of the
old residents regretted annexation. For j
it brings the cable, electric cars, north- i
I crn capital and energy, and the rest- |
less surge of commerce and greed. The j
kindly natives, with their simple ways j
and garlands, will learn sterner lessons, j
and the dolce far niente life must give
way to the practical. The officers and
men of these transports have been, in
deed, fortunate to have seen Hawaii be- i
fore it is spoiled. As it is, we carry j
naught but loveliest memories of our
halt at the midocean camp before we
again face the long stretch of ocean
travel and the great unknown of the
Philippines. BY AN OFFICER.

ON BOARD THE RIO DE JA
NEIRO, HONOLULU, July 31.â For
the first day or two out from San
Francisco a great deal of trouble was
experienced In furnishing sufficient and
properly cooked food to the 846 enlisted
men of the First South Dakota Infan
try, recruits for the Utah Light Artil
lery and detachment of the Signal
Corps. But through the untiring ef
forts of Lieutenant Murray, regimental
quartermaster of the First South Da
kota Infantry, who is acting commis
sary of the expedition, the trouble was
soon overcome. A regular army officer
on board, who holds a responsible po
sition on the staff of General Merritt,
said:
"I have never before seen soldiers
better fed on land or sea."
The steamer is not crowded. The
saloons, promenade decks and other
parts of the ship which are used for
pleasure on ordinary voyages are still
employed for the purpose for which
they were designed. During the duy
the men spend most of their time on
the hurricane deck and all meals are
served to them on that deck. The Rio
de Janeiro is probably better fitted out
so far as the comforts of the officers
and men are concerned than any of the
transports that have preceded her to
Manila.
The health of the command has been
exceptionably good.
On July 26 (900 miles out at sea)
Private Newell E. Jenks, Company L,
First South Dakota Infantry, from
Spearfish, South Dakota, died of pneu
monia. Jenks had the measles at Camp
Merritt and was discharged from the
general hospital the day previous to
the sailing of the Rio de Janeiro.
Jenks was buried with military honors
on July 27.

Great Resources Will Be

Former Consul General in Consulta
tion with the President and
Secretary Alger Regard
ing the Island.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. â Major
General Fitzhugh Lee, in command of
the Seventh Army Corps at Jackson
ville, was in conference to-day with the
President and the War Department.
He came here on a special telegraphic
summons from Secretary Alger, and it
was with the latter that he conferred
for an hour with the President. It is
generally expected that General Lee
will head the military commission
which will adjust affairs in Cuba, and
also he has been strongly urged for the
Governorship of that island after the
functions of the commission cease. On
both of these points, however, General
Lee asserts he knows nothing. He ad
mitted, however, that he had been talk
ing over matters in Cuba generally.
Then he added:
"The first work vhieh will have to
be done In Cuba will be to make ar
rangements by which all the munici
pal machinery can be put into operation
in all the towns, and governmental ma
chinery throughout the island. There
will have to be mllltarv control, I sup
pose, until such time as the people in
terested can organize and put into ope
ration a government which should be
stable and strong enough to impartial
ly protect the interests of Spaniards,
Americans, Cubans and the people of
all other nationalities now on the is
land, or who may hereafter go there."
"Is there probability of Spanish in
terests suffering through the Cubans?"
"The Spanish property holders, mer
chants and all other classes of Span
iards naturally would unite with all the
rest of the conservative inhabitants for
the preservation of the interests of alia
the citizens, and I think they will help
the natives and the Americans to main
tain a strong, safe government. This
would be natural, for no class of peo
ple would be more interested than they
are in maintaining property and all
other rights. The most difficult prob
lem to solve is the first organization of
a preliminary form of government, as
later the island will be very rapidly
Americanized, and all such questions
will take care of themselves.
"As to the probability of the Cubans
attaining a stable government, I pre
sume that as soon as possible a procla
mation will be issued setting apart a
date for the holding of a general elec
tion for a chief executive of the island
and for a legislative body to which all
matters affecting the future of the isl
and will be referred. This executive
body probably will adopt a constitution
and make the proper laws to put into
operation the political form of govern
ment.
"As to the army of occupation which
will be necessary to maintain our posi
tion with respect to Cuba, 45.000 men
will be ample to garrison the whole isl
and. Of this number possibly 25,000
would be stationed in and about Hav
ana. Matanzas would be the next im
portant point for a garrison. Other
points should be regulated by the pos
sibilities of disorder that might take
place there, and the number of troops
at the various points will naturally be
governed by circumstances.
"Properly directed, Cuba will have a
great commercial future. Its unbound
ed and great resources will be very
rapidly developed by American push,
vigor and capital."
General Lee says he has no plans
beyond going back to Jacksonville to
resume command of the Seventh Army
Corps. He will leave for that point
Wednesday.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 15.â market for
Etocks was remarkably active and buoyant to
day. There was an occasional halt In the up
ward tendency, when the price of some lead-
Ing stock was advanced to a level which in
vited unusually heavy offerings. But no vol
ume of offerings seemed sufficient to check the
steady upward tendency of the market, and
everything was absorbed, with eagerness. St.
Paul took the lead of the market with a rise
of 3* per cent, and the total transactions for
the day footing up 67,700 shares. This advance
was undoubtedly due to the movement of a
3arge combination of speculative Interests, and
was based primarily on the fact that the ad
vance in the price hitherto has been incom
mensurate with that in the other prominent
Grangers.
The reason for this was probably that the
stock has been more largely held abroad
than the other Grangers and London has been
persistently liquidating its holdings of Ameri
can stocks. England's unfavorable trade bal
ance and the strong market presented in New
York for profit taking, of course have been the
motives for this selling, but It was neverthe
less effective in holding back the price of St.
Paul. It Is now said that these London offer-
Ings have been steadily absorbed by the power
ful speculative clique which started the pres
ent bull movement in Burlington and which has ;
now shifted the leadership to St. Paul. The i
buying was accompanied by rumors that the;
iwxt semi-annual dividend of 2 per cent will :
be supplemented by an extra dividend. The ,
preferred stock was bid up 3* per cent to
day, and the high grade bonds of the com
pany were also very strong. St. Paul was the
conspicuous center of the market, and the other
Grangers were uniformly strong. The buying
"of the Northern Pacific continued very large
and aggressive. The strength spread from the
leaders as the day progn seed and embraced a
continually growing list of stocks, most of
which showed gains of between one and two
points, and many of them in excess of that.
Sugar and Manhattan were depressed through
out. There was no special news to account
Tor the rise which was rather due to the growth
of general conviction that the conclusion of ;
peace will give full scope to the extraordinarily j
favorable conditions in the country, embraced j
in large crops at profitable prices, easy money
conditions and continuing favorable trade bal- j
ances.
Business in bonds was at a somewhat re- j
. -duced scale, and there was a tendency to re- I
action at some points in the list probably due
to the diversion of capital into stocks. Total
sales, $3,615,000. United States threes when Is
sued advanced â â â â In the bid price. Govern
ments were otherwise unchanged.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 15.â Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: Stocks
here were quiet but distinctly firm to-day,
the feature being the strong demand for Amer
icans and Argentine stocks. The latter were
bought chiefly by Berlin. Americana were
dealt In extensively for New York. and
there was also much English and German buy
ing. The demand largely centered in Erie.
Closed quiet at the top with a hopeful out
look. There was a further small recovery In
Grand Trunk. Apart from the directions In
dicated general business remains bo stagnant
that the closing of the Stock Exchange on
next Saturday is mooted. The question Is be
ing considered also whether the exchange shall
be closed every Saturday during September.

1 CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
1 CHICAGO, Aug. 15.â Although Liverpool
â  ! quoted 3d decline in Wheat futures, the mar
| ket here started slightly higher than it closed
i Saturday. It was raining in Chicago, and al
though It was dry in the spring Wheat terri
tory where harvesting is In progress, the ap- '
â  pearance of umbrellas and rain coats on the f
i street dampened the bearish spirit that was bo ,
j pronounced Saturday. The market remained ;
i firm during the greater part of the forenoon, j
< notwithstanding indications of an Increase in
' receipts for the near future. The small visible |
supply decrease and the receipts continuing j
I much under those of last year held the market
j firm, notwithstanding the â  promise of an in
j crease soon. The most bearish feature of the \
news- received was a drop in the price of cash !
I Wheat at Minneapolis of from 5c for contract j
to 10c for certain lower grades. The Italian
crop was officially estimated at 9.000,000 bush
els The day's clearances of wheat and flour .
from Atlantic ports were equal to 365,000 bush- ,
els The dullness of trade, expectation of heav- '
ier receipts and predicted Improvement In the
weather caused a cessation of weakness near I
the end. September closed *@%c lower; De- j
! cember lost %c.
Business in the Corn pit was not up to its j
I recent average activity, nor were fluctuations
: wide enough to stimulate the crowd into mak- ;
! ing fresh ventures. September closed %c higher, j
I Oats were steady with Corn, but yielded on !
a little selling and closed at the low point of
i the day. September declined V4@'/4c.
Provisions ruled dull and barely steady. There :
; was just about cash trade enough to hold the ;
market. Prices of futures moved over a small
range and were in the end a trifle lower than
they were Saturday.

;. Is Said to Be No
â  ' . . Precedent.
San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 15.
.' Mrs. H. F. Williams, whose residence is
in .-the East, came to Oakland a few
weeks' ago to. visit her brother, Henry
â¢;Kv'iu. whom she had not tic-en for twenty
."years. Mrs. Williams had heard a great
' ''. deal of .' Calif ornian hospitality, an had
â¢ expected to meet with some of it upon
â¢ her arrival in this State. According to
â  h.er story- accompanying a suit which has
â¢.been! dismissed in Justice Cliffs court,
her", expectations were greatly disap
â¢: Mrs. Williams feels all the more grieved
In "-that the cause of her disappointment
â¢ is 'her own brother. Some time ago she
cahie to. Oakland and was cordially greet
â¢-.'. ed.li'y Henry Kent and his family. For
" lVve..weeks, she was his guest, and accord;
Mi'.g- to her story the family reunion was
-'â  very, pleasant. 'After an enjoyable visit
Mrs: Williams signified her intention of
â¢* returning: East and was greatly surprised
â¢â  when . her brother presented her with a
i m board bill for $25â five weeks at ?5 per
â week. The guest treated the matter a.s a
' : Joke' until she attempted to take away
â¢ her trunk, when she was informed by her
..brother that he intended to keep ii until
hlsVlaJm was satisfied.
â¢"â¢ After â¢ consulting attorneys Mrs. Wil
â  liams brought a replevin suit to recover j
â  her trunk, but Constable Weidler was
â¢ ordered out of the house. Mr. Kent saying
â  that he. had a perfect right to keep his ,
-.-.sister's belongings. He was informed that
as "he .did not keep a boarding house and
'.'â¢ hail not posted the necessary legal notice
â¢â '"he 1 could not take advantage of the act re
â¢ fetrring to. innkeepers. K< nt then at dead
â¢ 'of-night moved his sister's belongings to
'.'/. his 'office at the- Sixteenth-street depot.
:"': "' and â¢ â w.hen -this came to the notice of his
â¢'. sister's attorney he was peremptorily, in
"V formed that unless the trunk was turned
â 'over 'at once to Mrs. Williams a warrant :
."-â¢for arrest would issue immediately. The i
â  brother then gave his sister her clothes.
" â¢â¢I cannot return East with a very ex- j
â  aJttrd idea of California hospitality," said
â¢' Mrs. Williams to-day; "if my experience
with my own brother be a fair sample."

MURDERER MILLER
SENTENCED TO DIE

John Miller, murderer, of James
Childs, will be hanged by the neck un
til he is dead within the walls of San
Quentin Prison on the 14th of October.
The death sentence was pronounced
yesterday by Judge Carroll Cook. - â¢
The murderer, a hunchback of re- !
pulsive appearance, was. brought- over
from San Quentin that the sentence of j
Heath might be pronounced. He . was,
.led into court and sat quietly during
the settlement of a few preliminary 1
points; but, when he was told to stand
while sentence was pronounced,' his'
eves blazed with anger. He made no j
protest, however, until he heard, the
words concluding the sentence, ."and
may God have mercy on your. soul. ".
Then he lost his head. "May God have
mercy on your soul," he shouted at the
court. "I have been denied a fair
trial and am being railroaded to the
gallows." Two Deputy Sheriffs grap
pled with the frenzied murderer, but
his wasted find warped frame showed 1
the strength of aH athlete's, and it '.va.s
with difficulty that he was conquered.

The crime for which Miller is to suf- j
fer death had no extenuating circum- :

when, without cause, he shot him dead.
Miller lived for years on Clementina
street, near Fifth, with Maggie Ryan,
a woman of bad reputation. Frequent
ly they quarreled and on more than
one occasion Miller attempted to kin
her. On November IS. 1896, after a !
more bitter altercation than usual, he
pursued her from his home at' the point
of a pistol, firing at her as she ran. --
As she fled along Clementina street
shouting for help, Child* attracted by
her cries, went out of his house- to her
rescue. He rushed between. . her and
Miller, who was then almost upon her,
and. catching her, shoved, her" inside
of his own door and' out of danger.

FAST HORSES
RACED IN FORM
Few Reversals at the
Butte Meeting.
C ft ROWDS VIEIW THE SPORT
MORGAN IN THE LEAD OF THE
JOCKEY TALENT.
Many Horse Owners Meet With Good
Success in the Betting Ring.
There Was -Only One
Disaster.
Trre meeting just closed at Butte was |
in every way a success, notwithstanding ;
the several drawback* encountered, the j
most serious of which was the illness of |
Manager Ed A. Tipton. The ener- !
getic and hustling Kentucky horseman
was confined to his hotel during the
greater portion of the meet with an at
tack of fever.
The attendance and betting was hardly
up to the high standard of former years,
but then Butte is no longer a harum
scarum mining camp and people are in
clined now to weigh a dollar before risk
ing Jt on a gambling venture. The last
day was the banner one of the meeting.
An immense crowd viewed the sport and
ill.- betting was of the fierce sort, fully
$65,000 passing through tne auction and
paris mutueJ boxes.
The racing was marked by no astound
ing reversals, unless the acrobatic turn
of the California horse Rauido, ridden in
his five raced by Jockey Ruiz, be except
ed. Rapldo came up from Portland, and
after starting three times without show
ing anything, was passed up as a bad one.
Then he came <>ut on July 29 and won
driving from Kncino in a mile, covered in
l.t;V He next run third to Coda and
Encino in a mile run, covered in 1:43.
This race had a suspicious flavor about it,
but Ruiz explained it away by saying he
had misjudged the pace. Friday. August
ij, the chestnut gelding came out and made
All Smoke, Los Prietos, Twinkle Twink
and Lady Flight look like "dogs" in a
mile and twenty yards, run in 1:43%. For
this Invigorating exhibition, his owner,
.1. M. Capps, was tuhl to take his horses
from the track and Ruiz was suspended.
In the jumping horse division Viking
is now easily the best. He can now
shoulder weightâ a quality formerly lack
ing. Rosamore In good hands would
make a first-class timber-topper. Lord
Chesterfield is rounding up to form and
is due v win before luiik.
The Last night of the meeting a rous
iiiK benefit was given at the Auditorium
for the relief of the parents of Willie
Madden, the unfortunate rider killed
while piloting Lord Chesterfield in a race,
and a substantial sum of money was
raised. Volunteers were there in pro
fusion, and the performance was not over
until a late hour.
Crit Davis" crack colt Hand dOr, the
conqueror of Plaudit; â¢will probably not
be seen at the post in Montana. He re
cently threw a splint below one knee,
and will be touched up with the firing
iron.
Dutch, the giant "quarter horse," ap
pears to be the equal of the gray ghost
Leora when it comes to packing weight.
On August. 5, with 145 pounds in the sad
die, he defeated such fast ones as Pat
Tucker. Omah Wood, Rattler, Lou Wat
kins and Lo Lo with ease, stepping three
and a half furlongs in :41 Hat. He is as
broad as an English surrey, and- weighs
1350 pounds, 500 pounds less than his sire,
a Norman bred . stallion. On Labor, day
at -Anaconda there is talk of having" him
take a shy at the three furlong record,
with i a flat car loaded with ore on his
expansive back.. ':
Fred Edwards and Joe Lahgendorfer j
have met with good success,, their horses j
winning $2945 in purses during the meet
ing. Of -tills amount $1700 was captured j
by Dolore and Estro, leased from J. Nag
lee Burke. Thelma and Eroica appear to
be of but little account. â  â -.â â ' â  -
Lucky Star, who was purchased from
B. C. Holly by Miles Finlen some weeks
ago for $1500, has been given a well-earned
rest.
Of the jockey talent here Morgan head
ed the list with twenty-one lirsts out of
eighty-one mounts. Piggott was a good
second, having hit the wire first on sev
enteen occasions, and Shaw was a close
third with fifteen wins to his credit.
Morgan, an Indian lad, has been seen in
the saddle on the Western tracks for the \
past thirteen years, and he will probably
come to California the coming winter.
Shaw is riding in fine form, and if he j
would refrain from a too-liberal use of
the brnsh and red paint could soon amass
a bank account. Since signing with the
firm of Edwards & Co. Gus Wilson passes,
the three card men up and rides many a
winner. â â '. --:..' . . - ".- ...
Jack O'Brien, a careful handler of
horses, now has charge of the racers

is undoubtedly the beat horse shown at
the meeting. At his first two essays he
raced his fields off their feet, plainly out
classing anything here, but the third
time out was inglorlously beaten in a
race captured by ostler Joe. He was
plainly "off " and if he faces the starter
good and right, the $5000 Labor Day handi
cap will be a gift for him. j
The stable of E. Lanigan, consisting of
Rubicon Roadwarmer. Scotch Rose,
Kaiser Ludwig and Tiny P, has made a j
sorry showing. The showing in recerit !
races made by Rubicon is truly Inex- i
plicable, the ' chestnut horse apparently
being unable to beat the cheapest sell
ing plater. It is said he Is a "dope
horse' If so his party must have lost the
prescription. The stable is managed by
Denny Lynch of Wyatt Earp-Sharkey- j
Fitzsfmmons fame, and he has made a
lorry botch of educating the backwoods
men as to how to bet their coin. â 
Rufus Narvaez. who rode at the Oak
land and San Francisco meltings last- j
winter, Is here, but gets few mounts. His
late efforts are not appreciated. '
On August 6 the chestnut horse Peixotto
outran himself, skimming off six furlongs
handily in 1:13%. A few days before, with
Sullivan on his back, he ran ; ahead of !
his number, spoiling a well planned coup. i
The final day of the meeting saw one of
the closest finishes ever witnessed on any
track May Beach. Maud Ferguson and
El Mido finishing short noses apart in a
five furlong handicap covered in -1:01.

HAWAII NOT
FOR POOR MEN
The Rush of Travel to
the Islands.
CHANCES FOR EMPLOYMENT
CHARLES T. WILDER ON THE
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.
The Laboring Man Is Advised Not
to Rush to Honolulu in Ex
pectation of Finding
Work.
The increase of Hawaiian traffic has
been very great of late and promises to
continue for some time. All classes and
conditions of people have been emigrat
ing to the islandsâ laboring men, artisans,
farmers and professional nun of all de
scriptions. The freight traffic has in
creased in an equal degree, showing a
new and greater activity in commercial
intercourse with the Islands.
But if the men most conversant with
the BOcJal and economic conditions of the
Hawaiian Islands know of what they
speak the emigrants who leave this coun
try with the purpose of gain-
Ing employment may meet with many
hardships before they attain success. The
competition of Japanese and Chinese
tabor si riously affeota the condition of
the workmen in agricultural pursuits anÂ«j
all labor of a low trade. The higher
grades of labor will, of course, be open
to the white population almost exclusive
ly. The men who have lived in the
islands for years fear tins rushing of the
poorer classes of people to an isolated
land for the sole purpose of a living.
Charles T. Wilder, the Hawaiian Con
sul Qeneral, is strong in the belief that
Hawaii Is the country for the rich and
not the poor man. "It Is an undoubted
fact," he said yesterday, "that the
crowded condition of the steamers ply
ing between this port and Honolulu is due
to large increases of traffic, both freight
atnl passenger. When the Mariposa Bailed
she had on board ninety first-cabin pas
sengers bound for Honolulu, three of
whom were residents. The great portion
of these passengers went down on busi
ness of some son. either to make arecon
noissance for their principals or "to ob
serve for themselvirss. Twenty-live com
mercial travelers were on the Mariposa
when she left and they all had a com
mon destination â Honolulu.
"Every day J receive a bundle of let
ters from people asking my idyiee con
cerning employment la the Islands. I
counst-1 them t" stay at home, for it' they
! should prove unsuccessful they would
: then be thousands of miles from home
without the possibility of escape and
would be a burden on the community.
i The man with means will stand a great
deal better chance and there are great op
portunities for him. Tin only industries
that have been tried are Bugar and cof
1 fee raising. Tobacco has never bg< n
: given a trial, and If the proper methods
of raising and curing were put Into use
; Hawaii might produce very fine tobacco.
Hemp can 1" raised without any difficulty
, and r;uni'' alsi â¢.
"The !iusin< M posibilltlei are limited.
With the Increase of population and the
enlargement of industries the chances for
commercial enterprise will certainly be
augmented. The great growth of crowded
steamers may in a slight degree be caused
by the infrequent trips at the present
time, but the bulk of the traffic is due
to the rush of new people to the islands
since annexation."

Gossip.
John Brenock. Ed Corrlgan"s former
friend and partner, jyu now his deadly
enemy, had the following to say in the
Chicago Inter Ocean of Corrigan's state
ment that he (BrenoclO Was a debtor and
not a creditor of the Chicago Racing As
sociation.
For pure, refined and unadulterated nerve
' 'Corrlpan's statement is entitled to first prise.
' â " The tact of the matter Is that in lbSl one of
our land notes became due and the assocla
â¢ tton had no funds to meet the payment on the
earne. Corrigan offered to mortgage his horses
and James C. Burke whatever property he
had that was not then mortgaged; but between
them it was not possible to. raise the amount
dueâ sl7,ol*). It became necessary for me, for
â¢ â¢mv own protection, to raise the money, which
I 'did. through S. W. Allerton. from S. B.
Cobb, I appearing as a signer and indorser
â¢ with Mr. Allerton. The money thus raised
â¢ was placed to the credit of James C. Burke
" I--, error, on account of the Ignorance of Sec
retary Kuhl, who knows very little about
J keeping books. James C. Burkes stock was |
attached to the note as security, but mine- j
never. When the note became due it was paid |
by the association and charged to Burke s j
account, he having erroneously received credit
before. An astonishing fact, not mentioned
â  by rorrigan, is that in the fall of 108 or early
' in 1886 he very generously sent me $20,000
worth of stock In the Ingleslde track. Now,
does it stand to reason that he would do this
â¢were I Indebted to the association some $50,000?
On the contrary, the books will show that I
was a creditor to the amount of 130.000, while
Corrigan was a debtor for something over |
â¢;..J40,000. Any one knowing Corrlgan will ap- I
preciate his generous disposition in presenting
'me with $20,000 and then bringing suit for
- $60,000. I instructed my attorneys last winter
.to have this suit pushed to a hearing, but
they were unable to accomplish It. "The thing
. In a nutshell," as Corrigan says, Is simply j
' "rot," and his suit last year against me was j
. for the purpose solely of bolstering up his
credit fo that he could mortgage the property
for enough to pay his gambling and other per
sonal debts. As to the signature being torn
"off the note, I am Informed by our bookkeeper
. that It was invariably his rule and custom
to tear off the signature of every note we
made after the same was paid.
â  The raid of last Saturday afternoon was
the outgrowth of the trouble between
Brenock and Corrigan, and the former Is j
â¢â said to have directed the movements of I.
the force of deputy constables which was i
so ingloriously beaten back at Cicero with |
clubs clutched by the Corrigan crowd j
â  after an hour's fight. One constable was
. "out" for over an hour, and Corrigan him- i
â self had a fist fight with his former part- '[
tier, John Burke, at Hawthorne. The dis- j
patches did not say which won, but as >
, ''Big Ed" and a lot of his track officials ;
end Lessee George Rose were afterward
placed under arrest by a lone deputy it is
assumed that he was not at the point of
death after the Burke battle. And the end
Is not yet.
. â  The San Francisco firm of H. F. Ed
.. wards & Co., of which Joe Langendorfer
" Is a member, were very successful at Ana- '
conda last Saturday, Lady Ashley and !
Etta H of their string finishing In front in !
good shape. Torsion of the late B. C. !
Solly's stable and Encino, by Imp. Brutus,
also won on the same date. This Is Just a
fair sample of the way California-bred
horses ran at the Montana meetings.
A famous thoroughbred stallion died a
few days aero on Thomas W. Moore's
place near Santa Barbara, CaJ. Refer- I
ence is made to Surinam, son of Joe
Hooker and Ada C. by Revenue. This j
horse finished first in the California an- I
nual and autumn stakes as a two-year- i
old, but was each time disqualified. As
a three-year-old he captured the Pacific
Derby, one and a half miles, in 2:38%, 119
pounds up; the Tidal stakes, one and a
quarter miles, and at the far East, In the
colors of the late United States Senator
George Hearst. Surinam won a mile and
a quarter race in 2:09%, beating a good
field. While racing around New York j
he beat Eurus, the Suburban handicap |
winner, Boas, Goano, Aretlno, Conne- j
mara. The Bourbon and other celebrities.
Among the small lot of Surinams that
first appeared on the turf was the iron
constitutioned Armltage, who won four
straight races against the best young
sters in the far East, and was then sold
at auction to Richard Croker. the Demo
cratic "boss" of New York, for $8000. Ar
mltage won many times, and was sent to
England. Flashlight, a brother to Armi
tage, was a two-year-old stakewlnner
that carried 123 pounds and ran seven
furlongs in 1:27%. This horse has prob
ably run miles in 1:40 or close to it oftener
than any animal ever known, and has
won several times "over the sticks," too.
Others by Surinam were: Palmacita. Ex
aminer, Little Bob (winner of the four
mile stake at Inglesid* In 1897) and Don I
Clarencio. During the past four years ]
â¢Surinam has been on Mr. Moore's farm
â  near Santa Barbara, and that gentleman
has something like twenty-five of his sons
and daughters on the place. It was Moore
who bought Flashlight as a yearling for
$000 and was so enamored of his purchase
that when the sire was put up at auction
'â¢ at the Hearst estate sale late in Novem
ber, 1833, he secured Surinam, who was a
success both as a racehorse and sire.
Tod Sloan has signed to ride the horses
of Sidney Paget and ex-Secretary of the
Navy W. C. Whitney, for the balance of
this season. Some talk was indulged in
relative to his piloting race horses for
Messrs. Paget and Whitney in 1899, but
nothing definite was agreed upon.
Plaudit is dangerously sick at Saratoga
with lung- fever. He is owned by ex
.Secretary of the Navy Whitney. He won
the Kentucky Derby, Clark stakes.Lato
' nia Derby and Buckeye stakes this sea
son, and is valued at $25,000.

by Irish Birdcatcher and Metalre, who
â won a "gentlemen's race" at Ingleside
last winter, when- at odds of 50 to 1.

The Brutus colt was entered as the prop
erty of Mrs. S. C. Hlldreth. , .'--.
Two sons of Imp. Order, for which J. B.
. Haggin gave $26,000 last fall, won at St.
Louis. August 9. They were Ed Farrel
and Rebel Jack. At Saratoga, on the
â¢ same date, Hitee and High Jinks, by
Himyar, won the first two events on the
. day's card, while Estaca and Flavius. by
the Santa Anita horses. Emperor of Nor
folk and Volante, were among the win-
ners.
W. C. Whitney. ex-Secretary of the
Navy, has purchased the grand three
year-old filly Martha II of H. Tommy
Griffin; consideration $4000. at which figure
Phe is a bargain. In the Whitney stable
j* Jean Beraud, the crark two-year-old of
America. The $25,000 Plaudit, now very
Pick is also the property of the multi
millionaire, and the string is managed and
supposed to be owned in part by Sidney
Paget. Mr. Whitney's son-in-law. Martha
started her racing career in California,
and won many good contests while In the
Golden State.
The Jockey Club stewards took cog
nizance of the crookedness practiced at
Brighton Beach by ruling off, at thr-lr last
Wednesday night's meeting. G. B. Patter
eon, owner of the horse Burlesque, and
William Cheritan, owner of the California
bred horse Our Johnny. The famous John
J. MeCnfferty's jockey license was re
voked. The license of Our Johnny's train
er. James Sennet, was likewise revoked.
The entries of G. B. Patterson and Wil
liam Cheritan will be refused on all
courses racing under the Jurisdiction of
the Jockey Club. Patterson Is a brother
of Charley Patterson, formerly owner of
the famous Ornament, and Sonnet was
the senior member of the racing firm of
Rinnet & Warn, who used to own Eclipse
and others.
The New York Sun declares that Tod
Sloan's salary for riding the Whttney-
Paget horses during the rest of this sea
son and during 1899 will be $25,000.
Rebel Jack's owners. Nolan & Tholl of
Texas, who raced here last winter and
spring, have been suspended at St. Louis
for the in-and-out running of the Order
colt. It Is suspected Jaok is now cunning
enough to read the odds on the book
makers' boards.
PUTTING SPAWN
IN STREAMS
Thousands of Trout Fry
to Be Planted.
GOOD SPORT FOR ANGLERS
LAQUNITAS AND PAPER MILL
CREEKS FAVORED.
In the Next Two Weeks Near By
Streams Will Be Filled With
Young Fish.
Local anglers will, doubtless, be pleas
ed to learn that the State Fish Commis
sioners have concluded to thoroughly
stock the Lagunitas and Paper Mill
creeks with trout fry.
The Call has frequently stated that the
prospect for the next few years of trout
flphlng In coast streams was anything but
favorable, because of the past exceeding
ly dry winter and the inability of the
breeding ilshes to reach their spawning;
grounds.
It is n well-known fact that a large per
centage of the steelheads which attempt
ed to reach the head waters of the coast
streams last winter were land-locked in
tide-waters and doubtless many of them
spawned there. But thanks to Fish Com
missioner Vogelsang, a thorough stocking
of the coast streams will very materially
assist to keep up ihe supply of finny in
habitants.
To-morrow Deputy Fish Commissioner
Cross and an assistant will go to San
Anselmo station with five cans of trout
fry supposed to contain 25,000 fishes of the
cutthroat and rainbow trout variety. At
a point about one mile below Libertys in
the headwaters of Lagunitas creek the fry
will be deposited. On Saturday next a
second consignment consisting of 50.000
fry will be placed in the Lagunitas creek
and its tributaries which are within easy
reach of Lagunltas station. In the fol
lowing week the San Gregorio and Pesca
dero creeks will be stocked with trout fry.
all of which goes to prove that the present
Board of Fish Commissioners is alive to
the pleasure and interest of the local an
gling fraternity.
BOBBED A SAILOR.
Frank Clayton and L. B. Barnett Fol-
lowed by Their Victim and
Captured.
Frank Clayton and L. B. Barnett were
arrested at an early hour yesterday
morning by Policeman Clarke and booked
nt the City Prison on a charge of rob
bery. The complaining witness is John
Erlckson, a sailor.
Erickson was walking along Kearny
street and seeing two men standing on
the corner of Pine he went over to them
and asked them to show him the way
to the water front. One of them pin
ioned his arms to his sides and the other
went through his pockets, relieving him
o? $1 50, his knife and scarfpin. He
pleaded with them to return his money,
and they each gave him 10 cents.
Erickson followed them to California
street and Quincey place, and when they
started to run he yelled for the police.
Clarke was close at hand and placed
thi-m under arrest. Yesterday morning
Erickson swore to complaints in Judge
Conlan's court charging Clayton and
Barnett, who were the two men, with
robbery. He got back from them his
knife and scarfpin.
Clayton was arrested about two weeks
ago by Detectives Gibson and Wren
while in the company of a well-known
ex-convict, and wnen searched a bottle
of "knock-out" drops was found In his
pocket. He was charged with vagrancy,
and when the case was tried before
Judge Mogan Clayton put up such a
good defense that the Judge took pity
upon him and gave him a chance to lead
a better life. He obtained employment
in a restaurant at 20 Stockton street, and
the Judge received a letter from his em
ployer stating that he was an exemplary
young man.
BITUMINIZED PAVEMENTS.
Police Judges Not Backing Up the
Police in Enforcing the Or
dinance.
Chief Lees recently Issued Instructions
to the police to arrest all teamsters who
violated the ordinance providing that on
bituminized pavements where there are
car tracks no vehicle shall be driven
with one wheel on the track and the
other on the pavement. Since then thir
ty-seven arrests have been made, but no
fine has been imposed by any of the
Police Judges, on the ground that the
teamsters should receive sufficient warn
ing before punishing them.
The police think- it is about time that
an example should be made of those vio
lating the ordinance. They are put to
the trouble of making arrests and swear-
Ing to complaints without any result. The
ordinance was passed to protect the pave
ments from unnecessary destruction, and
as it entails no hardship on teamsters
to drive on both rails of me car tracks
or on the pavement itself, they think
that their efforts to enforre the ordi
nance should be backed up by the Police
Judges.
BOOTBLACKS FIGHT.
Joseph Rossi and G. Annutzi Have
Each Other Charged With As
sault With a Deadly
Weapon.
Joseph Rosst, a bootblack at Third and
Mission streets, was arrested yesterday on
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
The complaining witness is G. Annutzi, 40
South Park.
It appears that Annutzi called at Rossi's
stand a week ago to negotiate for its pur
chase. He had in his arms his baby, about
a year old. Rossi and Annutzi could not
agree upon the terms and a tight ensued.
Rossi seized one of the foot rests and
struck at Annutzi, but missed him and
hit the baby on the base of the skull. The
baby is now In a critical condition. An
nutzi pulled out a knife and cut Rossi on
the arm. . M
Rossi had Annutzi arrested for assault
with a deadly weapon and the case was
called in Judge Joachimson's court yester
day and continued till Friday. Then An
nutzi swore to a complaint against Rossi.

Days.
l r
Brigadier General Miller will to-day
move the headquarters of the Independ
ent Division, Eighth Army Corps, from
Camp Merritt to the Presidio. The troops
now at Camp Merritt will remain there
at least this week, or until information

THE HONOLULU GARRISON
More New Yorkers Soon to Go
to Hawaiiâ Other Events
at the Presidio.
From the developments of yesterday it
would appear that the remaining compa
nies of the First New York Regiment,
now at th. Presidio, will be sent to Hono
lulu within the next week. Lieutenant
Colonel Stacpole was at department head
i Quarters yesterday to see General Mer
riam. and he stated last night that he
had great hopes that his regiment would
'be sent to Hawaii In a few days. Definite
j orders regarding the sending of the New
I York soldiers will probably be issued by
! General Merriam to-day. It may be that
only three of the five remaining compa
nles will form the next detachment to
i leave. These companies will go on the
transport Alliance, and the other two
companies will follow on a regular pas
senger steamer.
There were no deaths yesterday at the
: division hospital. Four men were sent
I home on sick furloughs and thirty-two
! were discharged as being cured. Trooper
< A. "W. Luff of the Utah Cavalry Is In the
i post hospital, where he lies at the point
of death with bronchitis.
First Lieutenant de Ford, Twentieth

('<>!nnel Funston, in order that he may re
turn to his home at Ottawa, Kans. , to

the most prominent young attorneys of
i Ottawa.
Trouper Miller, Fourth United States
Cavalry, while out with his troop yes
terday was thrown from his horso and

A ENERGETIC OFFICER,
Whose Promotion in the Vol
unteer Service Has Probably
Been Overlooked.
There is at military headquarters in this
i city an officer whose varied and extensive
j duties have been performed with such
i unobtrusiveness that to many of the peo
ple of San Francisco he is not known,
yet his range of services has comprised
the conducting of the business of the
chief quartermaster's office. Department
of California, and the transaction of the
business of quartermaster at the Presidio,
having also in his charge the garrisons
at Fort Point. Fort Baker, Camp Miller
I and ('amp Merriam at Santa Cruz, and
: at the samp time supplying Camp Mer
j ritt. This officer Is Captain C. B. Thomp
son quartermaster, I'nlted States army.
I whose services, so well performed, have
i received the full appreciation of his su
| periors in this department for hia zeal
and ability.
An officer of the general staff yesterday
called attention to the singular fact that
of all the promotions in the volunteers
of officers of the regular service Captain
Thompson Had received no recognition.
"He remains a captain," said the officer,
"when he should be, by reason of his
position a lieutenant colonel. Probably
this Is an oversight by the appointing au
thority at Washington. In that case, it
should be corrected at once by his prompt
advancement."

bee, Governor General Blanco, Admiral
Montljo and other celebrities of the late
war. Several well-drilled companies will
represent American and Spanish soldiers

Although there will be a lavish display
of fireworks nightly the exhibition does
not depend entirely upon them for Its suc
cess; they are simply some of the very
many agreeable features. Twenty Spanish
and American ships will be witnessed in
conflict, and amid the roar of cannon and
explosion of shells the audience will wit
ness the utter demolition of the Spanish
fleet and the triumph of Dewey and his
brave boys. The bombardment of Manila

SOLDIERS TRY
TO LYNCH A
LONE NEGRO
A Mob of Tennessee Men Pur
sue Him and Wreck His
Humble Home.
The Colored Man's Life Saved by the
Timely Intervention of Major
Cheatham.
The social differences as they exist in
the South between the negro and the
white man were the cause of a riot which
nearly culminated in a lynching just out
side the Presidio gates yesterday.
Danny Thomas, an Inoffensive negro
crab-nsherman. had a personal encounter
With two Tennessee soldiers, in which he
worsted them.
An eye-witness of the affair ran to the
Tennessee camp. and. bursting in on the
men. shouted: "A nigger has killed a
Tennessee boy!" In an instant the camp
was in a turmoil. With one accord the
men ran to the scene of the affray and
participated in the most remarkable
scene of its character ever enacted on this
coa-st. While there have been lynchings
here of murderers and horsethieves, there
has? never been one for such a trivial
cause as actuated the mob yesterday.
As the Tennessee men ran from their
camp they were joined by members of the
lowa and Kansas regiments, until they
blockaded the street in front of the house
in which Thomas was in hiding.
The circumstances which led up to the
riot are described differently by the two
parties. The negro affirms that he went
to Borel's saloon to deliver crabs, as is
his daily custom. He had left his home
at 3 o'clock in the morning, and reached
Borel's shortly after 7. He received 20
cents for his goods in that saloon. It was
at this time, according to his story, that
a man. who afterward proved to be Pri
vate Will Davis of Company L, Twenty
first Tennessee, and a companion named
Anderson asked him for 10 cents, with
which to buy drinks.
Ho said he had no money, and in a con
troversy that followed blows were struck.
The colored boy's fist broke the skin
over Davis 1 left eye. and also made a
gnsh in Anderson's face. When he
knocked Davis down the courier, with
oui waiting to note results, started for
the camp with the story that Davis was
killed, and t>y a negro.
This in effect, is the story also told
by Davis, with the exception that he af
firms that the crab fisherman approached
him for the price of a drink, committing
at the same time what, to him. was the
unpardonable offense of placing his hand
on the soldier's shoulder. After the quar
rel In front of Borei's, which must have
been a severe one, as blood was spat
tered all over the fr<>nt window, the
negro Btarted for his home.
He barely had time to give his mother
an outline of his quarrel with the sol
diers when their companions were upon
him. While the mother barred the way
of the pursuers, the younger children of
the family hid their brother in a tiny
attic of their home. The storm gath
ered quickly about the humble cottage.
Greenwich street, upon which it faces,
was soon filled with infuriated soldiers.
There was free access to the house
from the rear also, and that point of

vantage was Boon occupied. Cries of
"Lynch the nigger! Get a necktie!" were
taken up by the sullen mob, who re
peated them over and over again. Neigh
bors tried to summon the police, but all
the boxes in the neighborhood were
held by the soldiers.
The mother struggled bravely to protect
her son. She held the mob back until it
grew to enormous numbers. The men
treated her shamefully. They pulled her
about by the hair, kicked and beat and re
viled her all the time. They broke all the
windows, tore down doors, broke the stove
and its terra cotta pipe, besides tearing
out a portion of the side of the house and
shingles from the roof in their rnau frenzy.
At an opportune moment Major B. F.
Cheat ham, commanding the Second Bat
talion, Tennessee Regiment, arrived. He
at once made his way Inside just ns
Fiery Southerners Bring Their Race War to the Golden Gate.
Thomas was being taken down from his I
attic hiding place. Major Cheatham drew
his revolver and said: "I will shoot the
first man who touches him." He then put
the negro in charge of two non-commis
sioned officers. On gaining the street he
was placed in the center of a guard of six
teen lowa men and marched to the Ten- i
nessee camp. Kn route and after they i
had entered the reservation some one j
Ftruek the negro with a heavy iron hook, ;
inflicting a sculp wound. The Tennessee i
men shouted at the guard: "We don't !
blame you, but we will kill that 'ere nig- !
ger!"
In the earlier stage of the riot Corporal
Mason and Private Fish of the mounted
patrol tried to disperse the mob, but were
severely handled. After Thomas had re
mained at the Tennessee camp for a short
titme he was escorted to the guardhouse
by Lieutenant J. M. Neal and Troop B,
Fourth Cavalry.
The breach of discipline of the Tennes
seeans created a profound sensation at
the Presidio. General Marcus Miller, who 'â 
has charge of the expeditionary forces |
at Camp MilKr, on tne Presidio Reserva- j
tion, was among the first at the Tennes- i
see camp. The colored boy proved to be
well known to him. His father. Zero
Thomas, came to this coast with the
Fourth Light Artillery in 1K72. He was
then the servant of Colonel Hasbrook.
and was a favorite with the officers. He
Is now employed as a janitor in the Ap
praisers' building.
When he saw the wreck of his little
household he stood in the yard, and with
bowed head, prayed for strength and pa
tience to stand the trial through which
he had to pass.
General Miller at once detailed Lieu
tenant Fowler of the Tennessee Regiment
to investigate the occurrence of the morn
ing. Every member of the regiment who
cannot acquit himself of participating in
the riot will be tried by courtmartial. A
board of survey will be appointed to
assess the damages to the house and
property, and this will be paid pro rata
by the men of the regiment.
Private Davis was not under arrest yes
teniay, being merely confined to his quar
ters. Last night an extra guard was
placed around the Tennessee camp, and
but five passes were allowed each com-
pany.
"My boy enme running into the hoime
all out of breath," said Mrs. Thomas yes
terday afternoon. "He hurriedly told me
that he had a fight with a couple of sol
diers and that he hit them. He said they
asked him for 10 cents, and he told them
he had no money. One of them wanted
to pass on, but the other showed fight. I
heard the BOldlerfl coming at this time,
and told my son to hide while I kept them
off. They stood outside the back yard for
a time and I talked to tuem. I heard
some one Bay, The Tennessee men will
be here soon and then we will get him.'
"The crowd gathered quickly and soon
swarmed all over the place. They yelled,
â¢Hang him! Lynch the nigger! Get a
rope! Get a necktie!"
"While this was going on my other chil
dren hid Danny in the attic. The men
soon commenced to run all over the
place and pulled me about by the hair
and kicked and beat me. They pelted the
house with stones and bricks and also had
axes and long iron poles. They knocked
the plastering down, overturned the stove
and broke the cement stovepipe, scatter
ing fishes and soot in every direction.
They abused me shamefully when I went
upstairs where Danny was. I found they
had a lighted lamp looking for him in the
dark corners.
"When they located Danny he reasoned
with them, but to no purpose. It was
about this time the soldiers went up
TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALX, TUESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1898.
where he was and were just bringing him
down when the officer came. As far as I
could see he was not hurt up to this
time."
Major B. F. Cheatham, commanding the
Second Battalion, Tennessee Regiment,
accompanied by First Lieutenant A. J.
Law, Company C, noticing the commo
tion, followed the men out of hip camp.
"I called out to many of them to go back
to the camp, and they did so " he said
yesterday. "When I arrived at the house
I found a mob gathered there, made up of
Tennessee, lowa and Kansas men. I at
once went In and arrived Just at the mo
ment they were bringing the negro down
through the small trapdoor leading to the
attic Just before this the soldiers hesi
tated about going up after him, saying:
'He has a knife, and will cut the first
man's head off who tries to get him.'
Some one volunteered, saying: Shoot me
up through there: I'll bring him down.'
"He was doing so when I entered the
room, and I drew my pistol and said, 'I
will shoot the first man who touches him.'
I placed the negro under guard of the
man who brought him down and of a ser
geant, and ordered the men to fall back
at 'attention.' I then marched him up the
street toward the camp, with an addition
al guard of sixteen men from the lowa
regiment. These were relieved part way
to the Tennessee lines by a guard from
our own rejeiment. We kept him until
Lieutenant J. M. Neals, Troop B of Cav
alry, took him to the Presidio giiard-
Prlvate Will Davis of the Tennessee
Regiment, who created all the strife, made
the following statement:
"Early in the morning I went to the tent
of the Catholic Truth Society, which is
erected at a point near where the Union
street cars enter the reservation, to mail
two letters. Near there I met an old man
named Anderson, who told me he had a
dime and asked me to have a drink. I
went with him to the saloon of Leon Bo
rel, 2840 Baker street, where we each had
a srlass of beer.
"We then went out on the sidewalk,
when Anderson asked me for a match
with which to light a cigarette. I said I
had none and we went back to get a
match. While there I rolled a cigarette.
Just as I finished a young negro came in
and placing his hand on my shoulder said:
'Am t you going to sot me up this drink."
I told him that I had no money, that An
derson had just treated me. The negro
then turned to Anderson and said: 'Why
don't you treat us black folks here like
you do your black folks at home?' Ander
son simply said, 'We do!'
"In the course of this passage of words
we reached the sidewalk. The negro con
tinued the controversy, saying: 'You are
a liar, you don't. We are just as-good as
any of" you white people. Just because
you have on blue clothes, don't you think
you can run over the black folks of San
Francisco.
"Anderson then cursed the negro and the
latter struck at him. They were fighting
when 1 stooped down to pick up a brick.
As I raised up, the negro strucH me ove,r
the left eye with what I think was a pair
of brass knuckles. That staggered me,
but I held the brick and struck the negro,
knocking him down. I hit him and kicked
him several times. By this time a small
crowd had gathered. The negro jumped
up and ran toward his home. When ho
neared there he shouted something back J
at us. We followed to find out what he
said. When we reached him again the
negro struck Anderson and I struck him
with a stone. All this wm in a running
tight. The negro ran In his house and
some one In the crowd, which numbered j
abemt twenty-flve men, proposed that
they get the negro out and lynch him.
I do not remember any of the subsequent
proceedings or how I got back to camp."
PLAYED TAG WITH DEATH.
Raymond Sweeney Killed by a Coalcart and William
Carroll Injured by a Streetcar.
While playing tag, Raymond Sweeney, a thirteen-year-old boy,
was struck by the pole of a coal cart anrl instantly killed about 9
o'clock last evening near the corner of Mission and Twenty-fourth
streets. Immediately after the boy had been killed the horses swerved
and collided with a south-bound Mission street car, No. 1028. Will
iam Carroll, the driver of the cart, was thrown in front of the car
and seriously injured.
Witnesses of the accident place no blame on F. T. Jackson, the
motorman, and although arrested, he was released on his own rec
ognizance. Young Sweeney had been playing with another boy and as
the coal wagon approached from the south and the car from the north,
he dodged in between the two and was struck in the face by the pole,
the force of the blow crushing in the skull. The car was on its last
trip and was going at an unusual rate of speed. The light from the
car falling upon a repair wagon which was standing in the street is
supposed to be what frightened the horses.
The front end of the car was splintered, the glass broken and tho
passengers considerably shaken up by the collision. The pole and
dashboard of the coal wagon were broken and both horses cut by the
car though neither one of them was injured badly.
13. Philkill, living at 2402 Mission street, saw the accident and
picked the boy up and placed him on the sidewalk. Dr. T. C. Park
was summoned, but finding the boy dead, turned her attention to the
injured man. He was in an unconscious condition and hardly breath
ing. He was removed to the City and County Hospital. Up to a late
hour he had not regained consciousness. Carroll is a married man
with three children, residing at 18 V 2 Stevenson place. He has been
driving a wagon for the Tesla Coal Company but two weeks, having
been laid up In the hospital with a broken leg for three months before
he took the position.
Raymond Sweeney was the son of Morgan M. Sweeney, a plumber
and tinner, in business at Crockett. The boy lived with his mother,
six sisters and three brothers at 340G Twenty-fourth street.
RAISE A "SACK"
TO FIGHT FOR
THEIR SHAME
The Action of the Supervisors
In Closing Berry Place
Ignored.
Strange Apathy of the Police in Enforcing
the Recent Decision of the City
Fathers.
Notwithstanding the action of the
Board of Supervisors in ordering Berry
street closed, no attempt has been made
by the Chief of Police to carry out the
edict of the city fathers. At their meet
ing a week ago the Supervisors passed an
order declaring that public decency was
being outraged by the disreputable in
habitants of the houses on Berry place,
and making it unlawful for any person
to rent the property for immoral pur
poses or for any one to maintain any of
the buildings on the street as a disorderly
house. In addition to the ordinance, the
Chief of Police was specially instructed
to carry out the desires of the board.
Mayor Phelan, immediately after the
passage of the order, sent a copy to
Chief Lees with instructions to enforce
it. For some reason the head of the
Police Department paid no attention to
the edict of the board, and as the result
the denizens of the street still flaunt their
shame, apparently safe from police inter
ference.
When asked last night why he had
neglected to enforce the order the Chief
rather innocently replied that he knew
nothing about the character of the women
who infest Berry street. He denied flhat
he had been officially notified by Mayor
Phelan of the action of the Supervisors
and declared that he would not drive out
the horde of disreputable women until he
got ready.
Despite the vigorous derdal of the Chief
it is known that yesterday he ordered one
of th^ clerks In his office to have a num
ber of notices printed calling the atten
tion of the denizens of the street to the
action of the Supervisors and ordering
them to vacate within five days after be
ing served with the notice. In the mean
time the owners of the disreputable
houses are raising a substantial purse,
presumably for the purpose of fighting
the order.
The police claim that the money is to
be used in erecting a massive gate at the
entrance to the street, similar to the one
used In another portion of the tenderloin
district. The owners of the dens are
satisfied that by erecting the gate Chief
Lees and his minions will not interfere
with the inmates of the street.
Notwithstanding- the claim that the
"sack" is to be used in building a gate, It
is whispered that the money is to be
"placed" where it will do the most good.
One of the principal property owners, it
is said. Is handling the sack, and is confi
dent of success. He is said to have re
marked that with the liberal distribution
of money he could influence the authori
ties not to close the street.
Last Saturday a poilce officer verbally
notified the inmates of the dens that they
would have to vacate. As they received
no official notification they refused to
move unless ordered to do so by the
courts. This would seem that they are
determined to make a fight, evidently hop-
Ing that the "sack" (which they helped to
fill) will influence the authorities not to
interfere with them.
A WELSHMAN WHO
EXPLORES VOLCANOES
SEARCHING FOR A DEPOSIT OF
SULPHUR.
Says That a Fortune Is to Be Found
in One of the Right
Sort.
An odd appearing character, with an
odd vocation, jS T. Jl Vaughn Rhys, a
Welshman. lie is a young man, appar
ently about 30 years of age, and frequents
the most expensive hotels in a dirty suit
of canvas. His spectacled eyes of deep
blue, prominent Grecian nose and well
cut mouth are noticeable features of a
comely physiognomy. If Mr. Rhys cared
for his looks he would certainly lind fa
vor with the ladies.
His occupation Is a very lonesome one.
It is searching for volcanoes with sul
phureted moutns. and when he finds one,
no matter whether it l>e in the beetling
regions of Western South America, amid
the Titanic upheavals of Asia or among
the smoke vent holes of Alaska, he
promptly notifies his home office, located
in Australia. At the same time he sends
back samples of the sulphur he finds,
after treatment in a peculiar apparatus
which he carries with him. Mr. Rhys
recently arrived in New York direct from
Australia, crossing the country ).y way of
the Canadian Pacific, and stopped for a
few days in Seattle.
"I am going north in search of suitable
volcanoes," remarked Mr. Rnys. '(:â¢â

have not found one on the American con
tinent that is just to my taste.
"Some of the American volcanoes have
large beds of sulphur, but it is of an in
â  ferior grade. Now 1 am arranging to
make a trip in a schooner along the en
tire chain of the Aleutians, which, I un
derstand, abound in active volcanoes.
Perhaps I shall find ther>i what I want.
The trip will lake me some months, as
the islands streich 1100 miles across the
Pacific.
"If 1 can find :i volcano of the ri^ht sort
1 have got a fortune. Some time ago I
patented in England an apparatus for
handling and purifying sulphur In large
quantities, at tne crater where it is found.
But it doesn't pay to meddle with a poor
grade. You know that to-day nearly all
the sulphur used by manufacturers in
America comes from Sicily. It Is the
best grade that can bo found. But it
costs money to brlnÂ« it so far. If an
American deposit can be discovered which
is almost v good as the Sicilian sulphur
1 will be able to clarify It and supply the
country. Anybody who will put me next
to a good volcano can make a handsome
thing out of it. I have been traveling
now for several years in various volcanic
regions of the worM, but especially in
South America, looking for sulphur, giome
months ago 1 returned to Australia, my
home, where I have several financial
backers, and recently made a fresh start.
"You would be surprised to know the
| value of a good sulphur-producing vol
cano. One of the right sort in America
would be worth more than a gold mine on
the Klondike."
WHEAT HOLDERS MAY
BE OVERCONFIDENT
Reports From All Quarters Indicate
an Ample Supply, Which Prom
ises No Immediate improve
ment in Prices.
The wheat situation during the past
seven days, while .showing a loss of 3
cents in September wheat In the Chicago
market shows more than this to the
trade. On Monday September wheat sold
at 65c. advancing to ST^c on Friday, the
cause being attributed to the urgent de
mand for spot by interior millers.
It is only natural that millers' wants
should be temporarily urgent. Farmers
have their ideas screwed to prires which
conditions will not warrant. They are
not going to realize this fact until the
spot demand becomes a question of find
ing buyers instead of buyers urging sell
ers.
The Government report issued August
10 assures a crop (winter and spring
wheat) of 700,000,000 bushels. Considera
tion must be given actual conditions
abroad. Foreigners are not requiring as
much American wheat this year as last,
simply because crops ahroad are consid
erable larger than requirements. The re
sult will be that producers will arrive at
the true condition all at onre and a rush
of wheat will be thrown upon the mar
ket greater than the demand can care
for, thereby sending prices below a legiti
mate basis.-
The spring wheat harvest hfjj set in
under favorable conditions. Duiuth and
Minneapolis anticipate heavy receipts
during the next sixty days. Winter wheat
holders must now encounter this elÂ«ment
against prices. The demand for spot
wheat abroad was the result of low stocks
held by millers. The English harvest is
not far distant, when millers will have
ample offerings from home farmers. Re
ports early in the week gave the Russian
wheat prospects as very gloomy; actual
facts do not carry out the truth of these
reports. . Private advices from Antwerp,
which may be relied upon, give conditions
as good throughout the greater section of
Schwartz, Dupee & Co.'? special crop
expert cables them from Berlin that the
wheat crop in Germany promises the best
ever made. Conditions throughout Frame
are reported exceedingly favorable. On
Saturday Russia and Koumania offered
wheat 10 marks â equal to about 6 cents â
below America's price, showing behind
this was assurance of a good harvest.
Minneapolis and Duluth reported No. 2
wheat selling 6 cents lower on Saturday
than on Friday. Country offerings
showed a marked increase. The bulls in
wheat tried hard to work up enthusiasm
on war rumors between England and
Russia. Speculators have fought these
wars so frequently they have learned to
smell powder before running.
The situation is one that promises no
immediate improvement in wheat prices.
The longer one waits the lower prices
promise. California producers are now in
direct competition with their more fav
ored friends in the north. Washington
and Oregon wheat will soon be for sale
at prices enough less to admit of ship
ment to California points.
Barley grows weaker as time passes on.
Considerable barley is being received from
the north. The spot market is feature
less. Lower prices are almost sure

SUTRO'S ESTATE INSOLVENT.
It Is Said That the Indebtedness Can
Be Paid if Creditors
. Will Wait.
The Sutro estate is declared to be in
solvent, though capable of liquidating all
indebtedness provided the creditors do not
insist upon forcing their demands for im
mediate payment.
Mortgages to the amount of one-quarter
of its value stand against the estate, a
fact of which the legal advisers and rela
tives of Mr. Sutro were In ignorance until
Dr. Emma Merrltt came into the knowl
edge at the time of taking charge as
guardian.
When the legal declaration of inÂ«>mpe
tency of the millionaire was made by the
courts foreclosures were freely threat
ened. The negotiations for the sale of the
electric railroad, in which Mr. Sutro had
some $260,000 interest, were said to have
been undertaken to relieve the estate of
Its immense indebtedness.
Reuben H. Lloyd persists that there is
no second will left by the deceased mill
ionaire, and alleges that Mrs. Kluge was
not the wife of the decedent.
Zweybruch Died Anyhow.
Berthold Zweybruch. the private in tho
Utah Cavalry who attempted suicide last
Thursday in a drug store by taking
morphine, died yesterday morning of
pneumonia, and his body was taken to
the Morgue.
Autopsy Surgeon Gallapher found on
examining the remains*, that the poison
was not the cause of dni. the deceased
having- recovered Croni3Bfc efforts of th.
morphine. The decease cniad been a drug
gist in the service, of Redington & Co..
in this city, and enlisted in tho Utah
Cavalry shortly after the breaking out
of the war with Spain.
Tea Samples deduced.
The Secretary of the Treasury has de
cided that samples of merchandise that
have no commercial value and not sub
ject to sale may be admitted free of
duty. Tea sampies to be admitted free
must not be of more than one ounce
each.
Denounced as Frauds.
Thomas C.arrett. an ex-employe of The
Call stereotyping rooms, whose recent
affliction of the eyes has made him wholly
blind, denounces the persons who have
been collecting money on his behalf as
being engaged In fraud. He has author
ized no one to solicit money for him.
