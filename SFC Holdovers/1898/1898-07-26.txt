DESPAIR

It Would Seen) That the Madrid
Government Is Ripe for Any
Reasonable Proposition
Special Cable to The Call and the Ssw York Herald. Copyrighted, 189S,
by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, July 25. â Immense importance is attached
here to the words of Secretary Day favoring peace on terms
which would avoid the necessity of Spain having to continue
the war of despair. At present Spain is absolutely keenly eager
to find an opportunity for opening peace negotiations. Secre
tary Day seems to have given the opening, and it n.ay not be
amiss to state that just now peace will be very easy upon what
diplomatists here describe as the only possible basis; that is to
say. the independence of Cuba under an American guarantee
with the good will of Spain. It is estimated here that the
Americans after a brief practical experience in Cuba will realize
the enormous difficulties attending its government without
Spanish assistance. I have tried several times to emphasize the
growing sentiment here that Spain would be willing to accept
any honorable means which would safeguard Spanish interests in
Cuba. That is the dominating note to which the terms of peace
are set. To speak plainly, it means almost any proposition which
would not mean the predominance of the insurgents. It is felt
with satisfaction here that the Americans particularly real
ize the absolute worthlessness of the piratical, undis
ciplined insurgents, who pretend to have the necessary qualities
to govern Cuba. The Spanish feeling is more in favor of Ameri
cans than the insurgents.
AN ARMISTICE WILL
NOT BE CONSIDERED
NEW YORK, July 25.â The Herald's
. ington correspondent telegraphs:
For some reason not yet known the
Washington authorities talk to-night
as if they knew Bomethlng of the re
port that the .Spanish Government had
drawn up a message proposing an ar
mistice. A naei the Cabinet told
me to-night he had reason to believe
the report was true. I asked a mem
ber of the Cabinet if he believed the
President would consent to an armistice
if asked for by Spain.
"No, emphatically no." he replied.
"With the Porto Rican campaign under
way, a part of the army already landed
and other ite, It is ridicul
ous to suppose that the United States
. stop short in its opr-ratk.ns to
permit Spain to think about what terms
of peace she may at some future time
proj.
L<>NDON T . July 25. â It is announced
in a special dispatch from Madrid, pub
lished here this afternoon, that the
Spanish < Juvcrnment has drawn up a
message, addressed to the Government
at Washington, proposing an armistice
for th^ purpose of discussing the terms
upon which peace with the United
States can be arranged.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Standard says: There still is an en
deavor to keep alive the impress!.. h
that something is going on behind the
scenes in the direction of peace, but
the prevailing idea is that the war will
continue until the fall of Manila and
the Invasion of Porto Rico. Peace is im
possible until there is more unanimity
In Spain with regard to the necessary
sacrifices of their territory. The Minis
ters, having arrived at an understand
ing, will await the march of events. A
Cabinet crisis has been averted for the
time being.
Those who succeed the present Cabi
net will be obliged ere long to ask the
country to submit to terms profoundly
repugnant to the national pride. The
prospect of Intermediary Cabinets is
loyal and correct atti
tude of General Pulavieja, who declines
to become th* instrument of politicians
eagfr to create a third party.
The Dally Chronicle claims to know
positively that no peace negotiations
of any sort have occurred between the
Americans and Spanish Governments.
The Dally Chronicle says: Spain has
SPANIARDS REPORT ON
AMERICAN REPULSE
MADRID, July 25.â A private dispatch from San Juan
de Porto Rico says a strong American squadron has appeared
before Baliia Honda, but that the American attempt to dis
embark was repulsed with considerable loss.
The San Francisco Call
made no approach and apparently does
not mean to yet. It is understood that
the Spanish Government is still hope
ful of organizing a European concert
aeainst the United States.
A special dispatch from Rome says
the Pope has communicated to the
powers peace proposals that he con
siders acceptable to both Spain and
the United States, namely the Ameri
can annexation of Cuba and Porto
Rico, the restitution of the Philippines
to Spain and a commercial treaty giv
ing Spain exceptional advantages in the
colonies surrendered.
MADRID, July 25.â The correspond
ent here of the Associated Press has
had an interesting conversation with a
person occupying a high position in the
Queen Regent's household, and whose
duties bring him daily into intimate re
lations with her Majesty. He said the
quarrel between Spain and the United
States is much easier of adjustment
than is generally believed. The Queen
Regent, he continued, naturally en
deavored to avoid war. and she now de-
Bires an honorable ending of it. She
is quite alive to the force of public
opinion, and holds strictly to the con
stitutional laws of the nation. It is an
error to suppose the Queen Regent is
under the pressure of the present or
any Government, or that she Is re
gardless of public opinion when it Is in
the interests of the Spanish people.
This official quoted then added this im
portant statement:
"The present Government will not
initiate peace, but a modified Cabinet,
headed by Senor Gamazo, Minister of
Public Instruction, will conclude the
negotiations and then retire and Gen
eral Polavieja with a combination in
cluding Senor Silvela and General
Campos will reorganize the Cabinet.
Everybody considers that Spain should
treat direct with the Americans, whose
practical good sense will prevail over
'spread-eagleism.' "

PARIS, July 25.â A special dispatch
from Madrid gives the following ac
count of the Queen Regent's daily
life during the present crisis: "Poor
Queen!" This is the exclamation often
heard of late day after day, as matters
grow worse and worse, as the Spanish
disasters repeat themselves and as the
throne of the little King seems slip

given in trust. I see her Majesty look-

LONDON, July 25. â A special dispatch from Shanghai says four Russian men-of-war have
left Port Arthur, and it is supposed their destination is the Philippine Islands.
Another special dispatch from Shanghai says the Japanese warships Woshino, Chin Yen,
Itsukushima and Saiyn Yen have been hastily dispatched to Saiseho to re-enforce the Japanese
squadron there, making it the strongest in these waters. It has been ordered to co-operate with
the British and American admirals in the event of international complications.
While the dispatch does not explain the matter, it is inferred the squadron is desired to be
in readiness for Philippine operations.
BROUGHT HOME TO DIE
OF TYPHOID FEVFR
Hopeless Case of Lieutenant Fiscus,
Second Cavalry â Others Who
May Becover.
NEW TORK, July 25.â A1l hope for
the recovery of Lieutenant William M.
Fiscus of the Second Cavalry, who \a
at Fort Wadsworth suffering from ty
phoid fever, has been abandoned. He
was one of the six officers who came
from Santiago a week ago Saturday.
The lieutenant is sinking gradually.
His father, William Flscua, formerly
Sheriff of Armstrong County, Pennsyl
vania, and his sister, Blanche Fiscus,
cling closer and closer to her boy, as
though to shield him from the dangers
eloping about him with almost fatal
force. It is very touching to witness
it. Her worst enemies recognize in the
Queen personal qualities worthy of the
highest admiration.
The Queen used every means at her
disposal to prevent war. Her great
hope lay in Senor Moret y Prendergast,
the former Minister of the Colonies,
and he would have carried his point
but for Senor Gullen, the former Min
ister for Foreign Affairs. To-day, and
ever since the war began, the great ob
ject of the Queen is to find the quick

other five oflicers continue to improve.
Private O'Heavy of the Twenty-first
Infantry is the most seriously off of
those in the Marine Hospital at Clifton.
He is suffering from a bullet wound in

tients are improving.

Relief is still anchored off Stapleton,

are all improving.
THREAT OF MOROCCO'S
FOREIGN MINISTER
MADRID, July 25.â According to a
dispatch from Cadiz to the Imparcial
of this city, advices from TamdAr say
est way for its determination. At many
of the councils of late held at the pal
ace the Queen has burst into tears,
begging and urging her Ministers to
seek a solution of the terms of peace,
which they seem Incapable of mater
ializingâpeace, which the Queen with
common sense sees to be of such vital
importance, and which her Ministers
keep postponing with the words so fa
tal to Spain, "manana" (to-morrow).
The Queen has taken every chance
offered in the council of putting in a
word for peace, and, little by little, she
has finally managed to bring the Cab
inet to her view and to thoughts ut
peace.
the Foreign Minister of Morocco de
clares that if the Americans enter Mo
roccan ports they will be notified to
leave in twenty-four hours, and, it is
added, if they refuse to do so, Morocco
will place herself under the protection
of the powers.
The^probabilities are anxiously can
vassed at Tangier since the arrival
there of the new United States Consul,
and the special dispatch adds tfiat the
belief increases that the United States
does not intend to deprive Spain of
anything but the Antilles.

REPORTED
LANDING
AT PONCE
Miles' Men Said to Have
Begun to Invade
Porto F^ico.
Be Tfys as It May,
Are Being Hurried to tt)e
Scene of OperatioQS.
ST. THOMAS, D. W. 1., July 25. â The United States
troops are landing to-day on the island of Porto Rico, near
Ponce, on the southern coast.
NEW YORK, July 25. â The Washington correspondent
of the Herald says: Adjutant General Corbin stated to-night
that he had received nothing to confirm the report that Major
General Miles with troops under his command had arrived in
Porto Rican waters and was landing near Ponce. Department
officials with whom I talked expressed a doubt as to the ac
curacy of the report, because, they stated, General Miles would
not land near Ponce, but at Fajardo, on the eastern coast.
BRIGADES ON THE
WAY TO PORTO RICO
NEW YORK, July 25.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: General Wilson and Gene
ral Schwan, who have sailed respec
tively from Charleston and Tampa,
and General Brooke, who is about to
sail from Newport News, have all
three received from the Secretary of
War telegraphic instructions to meet
General Miles and his troops at Fa
jardo. The plan thus far is for all the
troops composing the Porto Rican ex
pedition to disembark at that one
point. General Miles took with him
about 3500 troops. General Wilson
about 3600, General Schwan about 4000.
The troops now established at Newport
News ready for embarkation number,
officers included, about 5500 men. There
are 5232 enlisted men. Orders were is
sued to-day instructing only three
Southern regiments at Tampa to pro
ceed at once to Porto Rico. These num
ber about 3600 men, and are the First
Florida, Second Georgia and Fifth
Maryland.
I am informed to-day a strong effort
will be made to get off to-morrow at
least the St. Louis and St. Paul, the
former taking General Brooke with 1300
men, the latter taking General Haines
with 1300 men. The Massachusetts,
City of Washington and Roumania arc
in the stream, and will soon follow, to
gether with the Seneca, which left New
York to-day for Newport News. The
other transports are now on their way
to Newport News to be in readiness
for other troops from Chickamauga,
Among these transports are the Har
vard, Manitoba and Hudson. The Utah
is now loading at Charleston with me
chanical implements of all kinds, and
on her voyage to Porto Rico will call
at Jacksonville to take on board a
large number of negro laborers. The
distance from Guajitanamo to Fajardo
is about TOO miles, or about seventy
hours. Reckoning on this basis Gene
ral Miles' departure at 3 o'clock Friday
afternoon, allowing for his stop at
Mole St. Nicholas, would probably
bring the time of his landing up to this
afternoon.
TROOPS STILL SWARM
INTO NEWPORT NEWS
NEWPORT NEWS, July 25.â Incoming
trains during the last thirty-six hours
have brought nearly 600} troops to this
city. These Include the Second Brigade
of the First Army Corps in command of
Brigadier General Haines, from Chicka
mauga Park, and five troops of cavalry
from Camp Alger. The first train reached
the city at noon Sunday, and from that
time on until late this afternoon section

arrived they were marched to the

General Halnes' brigade is composed of
the Third Illinois, Colonel Benton; Fourth
Ohio, Colonel Coit, and the Fourth Penn

I the order named. The regiments arrived
in battalions of three trains each. The
first battalion of the Third Illinois Regi
ment reached the city Sunday, shortly
after 12 o'clock, but it was not until 2 this
afternoon that the battalion of the Penn
sylvania Regiment brought up the rear.
Meantime the five troops of cavalry ar
rived from Camp Alger. Troops A and C
of New York reaching the city Sunday af
ternoon, followed to-day by Troops A, B
and C of Pennsylvania. All of these
troops went into camp.
Major General Brooke's special train,
which left Chickamauga Sunday after
noon, pulled in at 2:30 this afternoon. The
last train to arrive t#is that bringing the
brigade hospital service from Chickamau
ga, which included 350 men. No more
troops will come in before daylight to
morrow. The signal corps will arrive at
11 o'clock. Four batteries of light artil
lery will arrive from Chickamauga. They
are batteries A. Illinois; B. Pennsylvania";
A. Missouri, and the Twenty-seventh In
diana battery.
General Haines' brigade will begin to
embark early to-morrow morning. The
transports Massachusetts, Roumania and
City of Washington are now at the p!eTs
taking on provisions. The auxiliary
cruiser St. Louis is expected to come up
Hampton Roads to-morrow morning and
it is probable that the vessel will sail in
the afternoon with General Brooke and
his staff and 1300 troops. The St. Paul is
expected to steam into port to-morrow
morning from New York. She will also
take on troops and provisions.
WAR BALLOON TO BE
SENT TQ PORTO RICO
WASHINGTON. July 25.â The signal
service has succeeded in reclaiming
from the battle-field of Santiago the
tubes which supplied the military bal
loon with pure hydrogen gas, and they,
with the balloon itself, have been
brought over to Tampa on the steamer
Adria. The tubes will be recharged
Immediately, and the whole apparatus
will be dispatched at once to Porto
Rico to assist General Miles In his
campaign there. The balloon is said
to have proved of great value in the
Santiago campaign, and from the char
acter of the country in Porto Rico,
where military operations must be con
ducted, it is believed that it also can
be used to advantage there.
CONCENTRATION TO BE
SPEEDILY EFFECTED
WASHINGTON, July 25.â The War
Department was busy to-day hurrying:
the dispatch of the remainder of Miles'
expedition against Porto Rico. Such
progress has been made that it is
hoped that all of the troops will be on
Porto Rican soil within a week at the
latest. General Miles is not expected
to defer his landing until that time,
but presumably will pick out a suitable
place for encamping his troops and es
tablishing himself ashore, awaiting the
arrival of the other detachments now
on their way.
War Department men believe that
the first official news from General
Miles will come through the press dis2

expeditions the delay will be even longer, as the distance is much greater.

It was stated at the War Department
General Brooke and General

the transportation division of the War
Department, who has just returned
from that place, has reported to Sec
retary Alger that it is well suited to
the shipment of the troops. Conse-
I!y the Secretary to-day ordered
all of" General Grant's brigade, 3000
men, from Chickamauga to Newport

time the soldiers get in, but they will
be encamped on suitable ground there,

PORTSMOUTH, N. H., July 25.â 1t
was learned to-day that a remarkable
demonstration occurred Saturday even
ing at Camp Long on Seavey's Island,
where the captured sailors of Admiral
Cervera's fleet are confined. As the
United States gunboat Frolic passed
the island on her way to Cuba the
Spanish prisoners greeted the vessel
with cheers and waving of hands. The
ovation took the Americans by sur
prise. The outburst was regarded by
those in charge of the camp as a re
sult of the good treatment received
here by the Spaniards, who took this
method of expressing their gratitude.
Surgeon McPheroon said to-day that
the condition of the prisoners in the
hospital showed marked improvement.

ST. THOMAS, D. W. 1., July 25.â
Captain Lotze of the German steamer
Croatia, which arrived here yesterday

three times off San Juan, Porto Rico,
on Saturday, by an American warship,
understood to be the United States

diately stopped, but her captain adds
that two more shots were fired over the
Croatia's bows from close range.
Late, an officer from the New Orleans

ship was injured. Captain Lotze waa
highly Indignant at being fired upon,
as he considered his ship was outside
the blockading zone. He sayÃ he saw
nothing of the invading fleet.
The French gunboat - ulton arrived

Changes Necessary in the Construc

Recently Authorized by
Congress.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Sec
! retary Long proposes to take measures
which will, he believes, insure in
creased speed for the three battle-ships
recently authorized by Congress. Aa
; recommended by a majority of the
board of construction, the minimum
speed of the proposed ships was fixed
at sixteen knots. The minority report
filed by Engineer-in-Chief Melville
urged that he be allowrd to put more
modern machinery in the ships, inti
mating that the result would be to In
crease their speed.
Secretary Long proposes to consult
with the engineer-in-chief to-morrow
Ito learn what can be expected from
the modern machinery which he pro
poses to install, and if a reasonable in
crease of speed can be obtained it will
be adopted. In any event, the Secre
tary proposes, as recommended by the
board, to Insert in the advertisement
i for bids for the construction of the pro
i posed vessels a clause notifying bid
j ders that proposals will be given pref
erence which promise the highest rate
i of speed, and bidders will be allowed
j to submit their own designs of ma
j chinery, which will be adopted by the
: department if it will give greater speed
j than Is possible with the departmental
! design without lessening the efficiency
jof the. vessels. â¢
Secretary Long and all of the officials
recognize the necessity of having faster
battle-ships, because of the speed made

"It is for the best Interests of the world

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 25.â
Everything here is peaceful. The 7000
Spanish soldiers at Guantanamo laid
down their arms to-day. The 3350 men
from Palma, Soriano, San Luis and
Longo surrendered yesteiday to Lieu
tenant Miley and to-day pack trains
with provisions were sent to them.
The only others included in the ca
pitulation are the 2000 at Baracoa and
1000 at Sagua. They have not yet been
turned over, but they are now here in
General Garcia's vicinity. He is at
Jiguany to-day and reached there
without encountering any Spaniards.
General Shafter authorizes an abso
lute contradiction of the report that
Garcia encountered a force of Span
iards who were returning to Santiago
to surrender, and was defeated by
them.
Colonel Ezra P. Ewers of the Ninth
Infantry, acting for General Shafter,
will receive the formal surrender of
Guantanamo.
Yesterday General Shafter released
fojrty Cubans, who had been confined in
the local Jail on political charges. In
deed, some of them were confined
without charges of any character,
others on the most trivial pretexts and
yet others solely because of sympathy
with the insurgent cause. The jail still
is filled with many whose crimes and
sentences are not on record and are
absolutely unknown so far as has been
yet ascertained. A general investiga
tion has been ordered.
American newspapers which have ar
rived here contain articles written ap
parently under a misapprehension of
the facts regarding the conduct of the
campaign and the dictation of the
terms of surrender. General Miles
was here simply as a visitor and ad
viser. In his official capacity he had

Special Dlspktch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 25.â Lieutenant
Richmond P. Hobson returned to the
city to-day, after the second visit to
Washington since his landing from the
St. Paul here on Friday morning. While
in Washington he again conferred with
Secretary Long concerning the saving
of the Cristobal Colon. Upon his re
turn to this city he went to the office
of the Merritt & Chapman Wrecking
and Derrick Company to complete the
preparations for righting and preserv
ing the Colon.
Lieutenant Hobson announced later
in the day that the Merritt & Chapman
Wrecking and Derrick Company had
consented to undertake the recovery of
the Cristobal Colon, and was making
every effort to begin the work as soon
as possible.
"The difficulty of saving the Colon,"
he said, "lies in the complete submerg
ence, upon her beam end, of a steamer
of 7000 tons. Only a short portion of
her stern is clear of the water, which
fills her whole Interior. Her sea valves
and her sides are in a few places per
forated by shells. The beach upon
which she lies is exceedingly shelving,
forming a part, in fact, of the moun
tain which there rises out of the sea.
In short, all the conditions are present
which render the righting and raising
of the ship an engineering feat of large
proportions. At the same time, it is
simple and quite feasible. No new ap
pliances are needed, nothing to be in
vented; it Is simply a question of get
ting to the spot in time with the ac
cepted means and methods on a suf
ficient scale."
As to the plan for raising the Colon
Lieutenant Hobson said: "We will
run the pontoons alongside of the Co
lon, submerge them, and after chains
under the bottom of the ship have been
fastened to the pontoons and tightened
the pontoons will be pumped out. At
the same time, we will use air pumps
in trying to force the water out of her
air chambers and water-tight com
partments. If many of those compart
ments are found to be in good condi
tion, this combined force from the out
side and the Inside will be sufficient to
raise the Colon several feet. If they
are not sufficient, then air bags will
be put In her hold and Inflated by com
pressed air.
"Every time the ship is raised a few
feet from the bottom she will be towed
farther in shore, so that after several
easy stages she will be high enough out
of the water to make all the necessary
repairs. It is thought that her hull
is not in a leaky condition, but that
it was the opening of the sea valves by
the Spaniards which snnk the ship
after they saw It was in possible to get
away. If that is found to be the case
the Colon may quickly be towed to a
drydock in this country for permanent
overhauling.
"I think it will be fully two weeks
before the work of raising the Colon
can begin. As to when it can be fin
ished will depend largely upon the
smoothness of the water. Pontoons
cannot be worked in rough water. For
tunately for us. the weather haa bepn
propitious for us so far."
Lieutenant Hobson went over to Glen

nothing to do with the terms of the ca
pitulation, the entire credit for which
belongs to General Shafter, who on
July 10 received the following dispatch
from Washington, of that date:
General Shafter. Siboney: The Secre
tary of War directs me to inform you
that General Miles left here at 10:4u lust
nipcht for Santiago, but with Instructions
which do not In any manner supersede
you as the commander of the United
States troops in the field at Santiago as
long as you are able for duty.
CORBIN, Adjutant General.
WHAT SHALL BE DONE
WITH SHAFTER'S ARMY?
WASHINGTON, July 25.â Rumors of
various kinds have been int circulation
' as to the disposition of General Shaf
ter's army, but the War Department
I has not come to any conclusion as yet
lin the matter. A sufficient force is to
! be kept at Santiago to maintain the
1 position the United States has taken
and to preserve order. While there
| is yellow fever infection in the army
; no attempt will be made to bring the
: troops to the United States. The War
: Department, it may be intimated, is
; now bending every effort to secure for
! General Shafter's army an ample sup
ply of nutritious food and also will see
that the soldiers have a rest and care
j ful attention, so that they may get in
| the very best condition. The medical
i corps is now making a careful exami
nation of the army with a view of ad
vising the department as to the be3t
methods of restoring the sick to health
and preventing any further spread of
disease. It is not believed at the de
partment that any large number of
tmops will be necessary at Santiago
i after the Spanish prisoners have been
I deported, but the department awaits
\ further developments before de
j elding upon any course in reference to
1 General Shafter's army.

Spain Abandons the Canary Islands

Their Coast Fortifi
cations. I
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 25.-The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
; graphs: Spain is making desperate
i efforts to get her squadron Into condl
j tion for active service. Official lnfor
; mation which has been received In
'â  Washington announces that the
j battle-ship Pelayo and the armored
I cruiser Carlos V are at Cartagena un
dergoing repairs in consequence of
their long voyage. No confirmation
has yet been received of the Herald's
announcement that Admiral Camara
will establish his base at Ceuta in an
i ticipation of the coming of Commodore
Watson's fleet, but no doubt is ex
pressed as to its correctness.
By placing Admiral Camara's fleet
at Ceuta the Spanish Government
| abandons the Canary Islands and the
; northern coast of Spain, their only pro
â¢ tection being their fortifications, which
! probably will not be molested by Com
modore Watson's fleet, it being official
ly announced that the object of Commo
dore Watson's fleet is to find Admiral
i Camara's command and accomplish its
; destruction. By taking station at
| Ceuta Admiral Camara Invites battle,
| which it is the duty of his American
adversary to seek. In view of the de
i termination of the department to give
| the American commodore an over
whelming and thoroughly efficient
j force, no doubt exists in naval circles
as to the result of the combat.
The official admission was made at
the Navy Department to-day that the
battle-ship Texas had been ordered to
New York, the battle-ships lowa and
Indiana are to follow the Texas, and
the Massachusetts will be ordered to
the United States, as soon as she has
performed her part in landing troops
at Fajarflo, in Porto Rico.
Not all of the ships under Rear Ad
miral Sampson's command are to leave
Santiago immediately. It was ex
; plained to me to-day that it is deemed
advisable to retain a sufficient force at
that point until all danger of an attack
on Santiago by the Spanish troops is
gone. This means that after the pris
oners now collecting at Santiago have
been shipped to Spain, Admiral Samp
son and the men-of-war under his
command will be relieved from duty at
their present stations and ordered to
other points. \
BRITISH STEAMER ZETA
HELD UP BY THE DIXIE

TURKS ISLAND, July 25.â The Brit
ish steamer Zeta, which arrived here to
| day from Jamaica, reports having seÂ»n
last Friday fourteen ships of the Unit
ed StateÃ expedition to Porto Rico. The
Zeta was fired upon by the Dixie, but
was allowed to proceed after an officer
from the Dixie had inspected her.
Hobson "Will Not Be Transferred.
NEW YORK, July 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: There

necessary to effeot such a transfer.
RUSSIA'S MOVE
NOT HOSTILE
Will Not Interfere at
Manila.
SUCH IS OFFICIAL BELIEF
SENDS BUT FOTJR WARSHIPS
TO THE PHILIPPINES.
If the Czar Intends to Attempt to
Bestrain American Action a
Larger Fleet Would Have
Been Dispatched.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, 'July 25.â The Wash- :
ington correspondent of the Herald '
telegraphs the following: Washing
ton Is without official confirmation of
the report that four Russian warships
have started for the Philippines, and
that four Japanese men-of-war have
been ordered to rendezvous with the
other Japanese ships at Saischo. The
fact that the report comes from
Shanghai, the hotbed of rumors, and
so far away from Port Arthur and
Tokio, makes the officials doubt its
authenticity. In any event none de
nies the right of Russia to send her
warships to the Philippines if she de
sires to do so, but a collection of four
at that point with a German force of
about the same number will make the
combined fleets far more formidable
than that of Admiral Dewey.
The authorities recognize that the
collecting of a formidable fleet of for
eign warships at Manila will lie very
embarrassing to the American ad
miral, as well as to this Government,
as it would undoubtedly be for the
purpose of exercising moral or re
straining Influence with regard to the
ultimate aims of the United States In
the Philippines.
I was told to-night that, so far as is
officially known, Russia has not entered
into any agreement with any European
nation for the purpose of influencing
the United States in the Philippines,
and it is not believed she would send
such a small fleet if she intends to in
terfere. Russian interests in these
islands are small, and the Czar's Gov
ernment, if it sends ships to the Phil
ippine Islands, cannot therefore have
the excuse made for Germany that the
reason for sending the fleet to Manila
is the necessity for providing protec
tion for her citizens and their interests.
No doubt is felt in administration
circles that England's and Japan's
ships would co-operate with the Ameri
can men-of-war in the event of inter
national complications, but such co
operation will not take place, the au
thorities predict, because the different
ways the European powers are pulling
is a splendid guarantee of non-inter
ference with American operations.
TOMBS IN THE TRENCHES
FOR AMERICAN HEROES
Will Ultimately Be Given Decent
Burial â Officers' Bodies to Be
Sent Home.
NEW YORK, July 25.â A World dis
patch from Santiago says: Many
American heroes who fell during the
heat of the fighting, being compelled to
force every step of their way, have
been buried where they died, with the
ceremony of war.
Near the Quaslna blockhouse, which
the Rough Riders stormed and took
some days previous to the battle of
San Juan, twenty-five are buried in
one grave. Chaplain Vandewater of
the Seventy-first New York conducted
the burial service twenty-five times in
one day. The bodies of Captain Capron
and Sergeant Hamilton Fish were
buried here. Both were taken home
on the steamer Hudson, which started
Thursday, by Nicholas Fish, father of
the dead sergeant.
At the last ford before San Juan hill
It is estimated that forty of our men
were buried in trenches. Twenty He
in the trenches at the foot of the hill
at El Caney. Owing to the necessity
of feeding the starving, caring for the
wounded and establishing an orderly
government in the province, the rein
terment of the brave men buried in
the jungles has been impossible. Ul
timately, however, they will be given a
proper burial. Only the bodies of of
ficers will be sent home. Coffins will
be provided for the men.
YELLOW FLAG FLYING
FROM HER FOREMAST
Transport Hudson From Santiago is
Not Allowed to Land Sick and
Wounded Soldiers.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., July 24.â
The transport Hudson from Santiago
arrived at Hampton Roads at noon to
day. From the foremast was sus
pended a yellow flag, indicating sick
ness aboard. Dr. Pettus, the national
quarantine officer, boarded the vessel
as soon as she cast anchor. He re
mained on board some time, and when
he came ashore it was learned that he
did not feel Justified in permitting those
on board to land. The Hudson is un
derstood to carry a number of sick and
wounded soldiers from Santiago. The
bodies of Captain Capron and Sergeant
Hamilton Fish were on board the ship
en route north for interment. It is said
that Sylvester Scovel, the New York
newspaper correspondent, who was or
dered from Cuba because of insulting
conduct toward General Shafter, Is also
on board.

WASHINGTON, July 25.â Secretary

the victory achieved at Cavite. The

of its authenticity by Secretary of

that Secretary Long in his letter of

the department is thoroughly well sat

We have no wise professionals to write our advertisements,

We cannot make it jingle like those who write in rhymes.
But the prices surely hit the nail right on the head sometimes.
The people know we mean it, though just half what others gret.
Our goods are right, the price is, too; but terms are always net.

STARVING CUBANS
SEND A PITIFUL
APPEAL FOR AID
Cienfuegos Residents Beg That
Sampson Hasten the At
tack on the City.
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
OUANxANAMO HAY, July 25.â The following pitiful appeal has
been addressee by the starving people of Cienfuegos to Rear Admiral
Sampson.
Honorable Sir: The CubanÃâ old men, women and childrenâ resident in
the town of CienfuegtM and this neighborhood are all dying of hunger.
The young men are all in the field with the Cuban troops and have no shoes
or food. All the provisions In this town are in the hands of the Spaniards.
Cubans cannot obtain a piece of bread, as it Is necessary to send every
thing to the field. The Weyler system is in high sway. The situation la
terrible.
If you. honorable sir, do not come quick with your squadron to our help
and take possession of this town we shall be lost. We beg you to precipi
tate your operations, or about 5000 old men. women and children will die of
hunger In this town. Some of these old men have four or five sons fighting
for freedom.
This is our sltuation-a horrible situation! If the great people of the
united States do not come quick to our help we are lost. For God's sake,
come quirk. SOME CUBANS.
Nothing can be done for the people of Cienfuegos until that place
is captured. This will not be for some time.

take up the formal charges filed
against T. T. Tourtillott and Mrs. K.
Madigan by Charles L. Williams. In
this case, also, the groundwork Is
being- laid for a liberal coat of kalso
mlne. Williams will be represented by
an attorney at the investigation. He
declares that his only object In taking
action in this unpleasant affair Is to
vindicate his wife's reputation in con
nection with the charge made by Di
rector Gould that she was suffering
from mental hallucinations. lie says
that he proposes to establish the fact
that his wife's mental condition is nor
mal, and that what she said she had
; seen at the asylum had actually taken
place. In conformity with this plan,
he states, he will further prove that
his wife's removal was due to the fact
i that she "knew too much."

At the opening the meeting prom
ised to be a warm one. Supervisor
Austin took exception to the published
interview of Superintendent Chipman,
in which that official attributed the at
tack upon him to the animus of "Boss"
Rea in an attempt to kill him politi
cally. Austin denied he was acting
for any political clique, and said his
motives were of the purest character.
He denounced the statement in ques
tion as a lie and the author a? a liar.
Superintendent Chipman responded
that if he was responsible for the
statement Austin knew how to obtain
redress and where to find him. Austin
thf>n qualified his statement.
Pettlt grave a lucid explanation of the
charges In hi 3 bill, which covered the
time from May 7 to June 30. He had
done most of his work at home, put
ting in from eight to ten hours a day.
The fact that some of it had been done
at San Miguel was made much of by
the Supervisors and caused acrimon
ious remarks. An attempt was made
to prove that ho. had not performed
some of the services charged.
Miss Cornelia Farley, H. H. Bland
and Elmer Brownell. members of the
County Board of Education, gave tes
timony contradictory to Pettlt. but as
their statements Bhowed animus they
were lightly received by the spectators
present. Bland and Brownell, both
Rea men, are out for the nomination
for County Superintendent of Schools.
Chlpman's testimony supported that
of Pettit.
At the conclusion of the examination
of witnesses the allowing of bills was
postponed until next month's meeting.
It appears now as though the investi
gation has proved a political boom
erang and Rea is anxious to drop it.

A PRIVATE dispatch received by the
Merchants' Exchange yesterday
stated that the American ship Ken

J. G. Baker, Mate H. Piper and a boy
named Hobson were dead. The telegram
was dated at Valparaiso, and the general
impression among shipping men is that
the vessel had caught fire and the crew,
being unable to subdue the flames, had
abandoned her. In the struggle to save
the ship the captain, mate and boy had
lost their lives.
The Kenilworth came here in the early
part of the year from New York with a
general cargo. After discharging she
went from here to Hilo. H. 1., where she

THE TAKING OF A LIFE
One Nevada Man Shoots Another
Who Was on a Still Hunt for
a Third.
RENO, July 25.â Wi1l Chapman, a
"bronco buster," had a fist fight yesterday
with Charles Sailing in the barroom of
ISrubeek's Hotel at Amadee. It was a
drunken row and after they had ham
mered each other for a time Sailing cripd
quits. The two men went in to dinner
and there got at it again. Sailing again
told Chapman that he had enough. He im
mediately left the hotel, went .to another
saloon procured a pistol and came back.
Chapman was in the washroom when
Balling came back. Frank Miller appeared
on the scene, armed with a double-bar
reled shotgun, and said that he allowed
no man to impose, upon a friend of his.
He put the gun to his shoulder and shot
Sailing with both barrels, one charge "â¢â¢
tering his right breast and the other
shooting off the lower oart of the face,

BRINGS BACK
YUKONERS AND
THEIR WEALTH
Steamship Charles Nelson
Reaches Seattle From
St. Michael.
Carries Nearly Two Hundred
Miners and at Least a Million
in Treasure.
SEATTLE, July 25.â The steamer
Charles Nelson arrived to-day from St.
Michael with 173 passengers from Daw
son and gold dust valued at from
U, 000,000 to $1,500,000. Purser M. A.
Tucker said:
"I believe that $1,500,000 is a fair esti
mate. Of that amount I can vouch for
$600,000 which was turned over to me
and placed In the steamer's safe."
One man, Mr. Tucker said, had $175,
000 and another $125,000. He would not
disclose their names.
Professor T. S. Lippy, hiÃ father and
two brothers carried from the steamer
nine canvas sacks which weighed about
100 pounds each. This was the clean-up
from Llppy's claim, No. 16 El Dorado.
Charles Randall, an c-ld-timer, had
$84,000. Other Individual amounts ran
from $1000 to $10,000, $5000 being an
average.
At 5 o'clock this afternoon sixty
seven passengers had deposited in the
assay office about $300,000. Four thou
sand ounces was the largest individual
amount. This did not include the
Lippy and Handall gold. About one
third of the passengers brought no
gold. Some of them had gone in last
spring. Not liking the prospects they
sold their outfits and returned.
People are arriving at St. Michael
every day from up the Yukon, and the
next steamers from there will be crowd
ed to their full capacity. Owing to the
high rates on river steamers many of
the Klondikers are floating down In
small boats.
When the Nelson left St. Michael
there were twenty-six vessels there.
Nine river steamers, laden to the
guards, had started up the river. Some
were drawing four feet of water, and
doubts were expressed as to the
heavier draughts ever getting to Daw
son. There is a large amount of mer
chandise at St. Michael which will in
sure plenty of food next winter if it
can be got up before Ice closes naviga-
I tion.
Moran's fleet of ten river steamers
! was passed by the Nelson just after it
i had entered Bering Sea, about 600 miles
I from St. Michael. The arrival ol the
fleet was anxiously awaited at St. Mi
j chael, as it would enable many of the
steamers to send their passengers up
the river. The passengers were get
| ting very uneasy and discontented.
I Several steamers were unable to sail.
owing to the fact that their passengers
would not disembark until river trans
portation was provided for them.
Among the steamers thus delayed were
the Progreso, South Portland and
Brixham. The noted Cuban filibuster
Laurada, with three tows, was passed
by the Nelson in Bering Sea. The
Conemaugh was discharging her steel
river steamers and they were being
riveted together. The Navarra had
arrived with her tow river steamer
Minneapolis in good condition.
Professor Lippy. who is recognized as
an authority on Yukon affairs, said to
night:
"El Dorado should not be counted
when an estimate is to be made as to
the value of the mines on the Yukon.
It is vastly richer than any of the
others that have been worked up to
date. But the country is good, as an
average, for $10 diggings to the man,
even under the present crude condi
tions. There is no question that the
diggings of the Northwest Territory are
very rich, but I question whether as
much work will be done next winter
as was done this past year, owing to
the prohibitive charges by the Cana
dian officials. From the time a man
arrives at the summit of the passes he
begins to be taxed, and he never es
capes after that. He pays for every
thing.
"That system does not compare at all
with the American side. In the first
place, on the American side the Gov
ernment takes no claims for itself and
the miners make their own laws. No
royalties are demanded and there are
no licenses or fees."
One of the successful old-timers who
left the Charles Nelson staggering un
der a weight of gold dust was C. A.
Bevans of lowa. This evening he gav>^
expression to his experiences and opin
ions as follows:
"I left Seattle fourteen years ago,
and have been in Alaska ever since.
From Juneau I went north, and have
prospected in almost every part of the
country. I was at Circle City when
the Klondike was discovered and
when I heard of the news it was too j
late for me to go there, as I had prop
erty which I believed to be valuable. |
That is the way big men feel â men who are full of power and vim.
When the life's blood is circulating in every part of the system grandly
there is full joy ; there is full manly feeling ; there is pleasure in lifa.
This never can happen when organs are stunted or overworked. "Hud-
yan," the great remedio-treatment of the Hudsonian Institute, makes
weak men feel like kings. The tired muscles, the taxed bladder or tho
tired heart vanish where this great treatment is used. If you have
abused one single organ of your system by misuse or over-use (your
liver, perhaps, but no matter what), ask what "Hudyan" has done for
other foolish men. It will cost you nothing, and the information you
will get you would not sell for thousands of dollars. It is free, we say.
So is medical advice, no matter what you suffer from. Why not get
what you can easily get so freely?
HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, Stockton, Market and Ellis Sts* San f ranciscoJ
I located in the Manook country, and
it was there I met ex-Governor Mc-
Graw. \\V worked as partners, and
when the clean-up tool place I was at
one end of a. sluice box and he at the
other. McGraw has good property,
and so have many other Seattle peo
ple who are located in the Manook
country. I have a one-half interest in
six claims on the Manook and a one
half interest in three claims on Birch
Creek. I know that there is property
on the Manook as valuable as any to
be found on the El Dorado, and all
that is necessary is to have some work
done. It is useless to go t>> any coun
try and open up a broker's office or
stake out cla...is without doing any
actual mining, and that is all that is
the matter with Manook and other
parts of Alaska. The people who are
condemning Alaska never went any
farther than the banks of the Yukon,
while in order to find paying property
it is necessary to go from nine to
ninety miles. The country is better off
without such people and the same peo
! pie are better off out of it.
"Boats going- up the river are now
i loaded down with whisky and hard
ware, but not much provisions, and I
was obliged to come out after another
supply in order to keep my men at
work. You can say with strict regard
for the truth that Alaska miners are
greatly handicapped by a shortage of
food, and it will be impossible to mine
to an advantage until the transporta
tion companies establish posts at dif
ferent points along the river and sell
supplies at reasonable price?."

DISTRIBUTION
OF THE BONDS
Work Involves Great
Labor.
FIRST SHIPMENT SENT OUT
SMALL BIDDERS ARE GIVEN
THE PREFERENCE.
Last of the Issue Will Not Have
Been Forwarded Until After
the Beginning of Sep
tember.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 25.â The fol
lowing statement concerning the new
bond issue was made at the Treasury
Department to-day:
The first shipment of the new war bonds
was made to-day. It consisted of 1000 I
bonds of $20 each and $1000 bonds of $500 â 
each. Tho public mind is poorly prepared |
to comprehend the enormous labor and
multitudinous delays connected with this !
great popular loan. In the first place, af
ter the rejection and return of thousands
of subscriptions to which no allotment i
could be made, there remain about 300,000 |
persons to whom bonds will be allotted
and forwarded in due course by express. )
It is not a question only of 300,000 names.
The name, including State, county, town
and street number of each subscriber i
must be transcribed and rewritten in va- !
rious ways at least ten times. This is j
equivalent to entering once, thus fully ex
tended, 3.1 A.0.000 or more names.
The mere clerical work, however, is but
a part of the problem ; the collection of !
checks and drafts received as payment
for bonds, the computation of interest,
preparation of cnecks in settlement for
same, the engraving and printing of ten
kimls or denominations of bonds, the ac
curate disposition of these in envelopes
properly addressed, all these are a part of
the problem that must be solved without
error or omission. One simnle fact will
impress the mind with the magnitude of
the operation. Each envelope must be
sealed with three seals, which means that j
900.000 seals in wax must be Imprinted on j
outgoing bonds.
Another important feature is the limlta- j
tion i the ability of the express agency to
receive, forward and deliver the bonds
after they are committed to their care for ;
this purpose. This limitation is estimated .
by tne express company at 6000 items a
day.
While subscribers in the sums of $4500 or j
less may rest secure in the certainty that j
the bonds will come to them all in due
time, they must patiently await the oppra
tion of the Government machinery. It Is
understood that deliveries on the sub- i
scriptlons of $n'X> and less, for which the
money has been all received will be made
before the larger subscriptions are at
tended to. Of these email subscriptions i
there are 230.000, and It is estimated that
forty days will be required for their dcliv- '
erv.
From this it will appear that subscrib
ers in amounts larger than $500 will not
hegrin to receive their bonds until after
September 1. From that date on the
In.m'.s will be put in the hands of the
larger subscribers quite rapidly, since, nu
merically speaking, they aggregate leM
than one-third of the number of Bina.ii
subscribers. In the meantime the larger
subscribers will be officially notified by
the Treasury Department when and how
payments in' addition to the 2 per cent de
posit will be required and before remitting
funds they are requested to await such
notice. Much confusion will thereby be
avoided.

ing Our Coin Should Be Moved
to Other Territory.
WASHINGTON, July 25.â Major Snlffen
of the Pay Corps will sail from New York
to-morrow on the Olivette for Santiago,
accompanied by three paymasters. They
will begin the payment of troops on their
arrival and in a very short time will be
joined by other paymasters, who will as
sist in paying oft General Shafter's army
and will then proceed to Porto Rico to
pay off the army of General Miles.
A rather Interesting question has arisen
In regard to the payment of troops. A
telegram has been received from General
Shatter requesting that gold and paper be
sent to Santiago, as tradesmen there re
fuse to accept American silver dollars at
their par value and rate them at 50 cents,
as with the Mexican dollar. It was Pay
master General Stanton"s intention to
send as little silver as ppssible, confining
it mostly to. subsidiary coin for the pur
pose of making change, on account of the
greater convenience of takin- gold and
paper and he will continue to do so.
Considerable indignation is expressed that
American money of any kind is discount
ed, and a suggestion has been made to the
Secretary of War that any tradesman
who refuses to accept T'nited States
money of any kind at 100 cents on the dol
lar should be removed frtm any territory
over which the American flag floats. It is
not known that any orders will be sent to
General Shafter on the subject.
The supposition is that the refusal to
accept silver dollars is the result of the
long use of the silver of Mexico and the
South American countries which have
never passed for more than half Its face
value.

CLEVER AND
FAST FIGHT
Everhardt Draws With
McPartland.
HONORS EVENLY DIVIDED
NEITHER MAN RECEIVES MUCH
PUNISHMENT.
Large Bets Becorded Before the Pair
Enter the Ring, With the New
Yorker a Red-Hot
Favorite.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 25.â Kid McPart
land of New York and Jack Everhardt
of New Orleans fought twenty-five
rounds to-night at the Greater New
York Athletic Club, Coney Island, and
at the end of the twenty-fifth round
both men were able to go several
rounds more. Referee Sam Austin
satisfied every one by declaring the
bout a draw. This was the third time
the men have met, and to-night's co-n
test leaves the question of supremacy
between the two to be settled at some
future time.
The vast building was densely
packed. The betting was lively, with
McPartland a slight favorite at odds of
100 to 90. The followers of McPartland
had pressed their bets while the crowd
waited for the men to appear, and the
odds were forced to 2 to 1 on the Kid.
Just before the men entered the ring
one bet of $1000 to $700 was registered
by a prominent bookmaker with a well
known clubman. The bookmaker took
the MePartland end of it.
Everhardfs seconds were Tommy
White, Joe Fisher, Danny McÃride and
Alexander Fisher. McPartland was
seconded by Bob Clark, Andy Welsh,
Young Jerrow and Charley Duryea.
Everhardt gave his weight at 136
pounds and McPartland owned up to
135.
In the opening round Everhardt land
ed a right swing on the back of the
Kid's neck and at the close McPart
land had forced Everhardt to his cor
ner. The eight succeeding rounds were
simply exhibitions of scientific spar
ring. In the ninth round McPartland
landed a stinging left swing on the pit
of Everhardfs stomach. In the tenth
McPartland landed three hard lefts on
the head and face. Everhardfs right
eye was marked during the round, this
being the only mark sustained by
either man during the mill.
The following rounds up to the nine
teenth were fast and the fighting pretty
even, with the advantage, if any, in
favor of McPartland. In the four
teenth and seventeenth rounds partic
ularly, Everhardt swung wildly and
failed repeatedly to land.
In the nineteenth round Everhardt
swung hJB right hard on McPartland's
head, dazing the Kid. Everhardt rushed
and the round ended in a clinch near
the ropes.
McPartland came up strong in the
twentieth, however, and cut out a
faster pace, which he continued in the
following round. Everhardt was tired
when he went to his corner.
In the twenty-third round Everhardt
took a turn at rushing and took dcs
! perate chances to land a swinging
! blow. He was cleverly blocked and
| failed to get one past McPartland's
; guard.
In the twenty-fourth round Jack kept
| rushing and forcing. He jabbed a
1 straight left on the face which forced
! McPartland's head back, but McPart
; land chopped two lefts on the neck,
i Jack rushed McPartland into the lat
i ter's corner. Jack rushed again and
! McPartland stopped him with a left
uppercut on the mouth.
McPartland opened the twenty-fifth
i with a loft chopping blow on the face.
; McPartland again sent his left to the
face and Jack landed a hard left on the
i ear. Jack rushed wildly and McPart
i land uppercut him with the left on tho
breast. Mac kept jabbing left and right
swings which did not land. Jack up
percut the Kid with his right on the
chest and slipped to his knee. When
Jack got to his feet, time was up and
the fight was ended. The referee de
clared the bout a draw.

KNOCKED OVERBOARD
FROM THE HUNTRESS
STOCKTON, July 25.â The body of the
woman drowned in Middle River last Fri
day has not been recovered. The drowned
woman was Miss Mary Allen of Vallejo,
aged 19 years. She was on the way to
this city on the sloop Huntress, owned by
Antone Hansen, a Vallejo saloon-keeper.
The young woman asked to be brought
to this city, saying she had friend a here
whom she wished to visit. On the way
up she told Hansen that her real object
was to get away from her home, as she
could not bear the treatment her mother
subjected her to.
Hansen and Miss Allen were the only
ones on the sloop. They were standing
just in front of the wheel, when the boom
was swung round by a gust of wind. It
struck Hansen and Miss Allen on the
head, knocking the man backward on
the deck, where he lay unconscious. The
woman was knocked overboard. When
Hansen recovered consciousness he called
for Miss Allen. Getting no reply he
started to rise, but fell. He was unable
to do more than crawl around the deck
in a semi-dazed condition.
A flag was flying on the mast of the
sloop, and, to attract attention, Hansen
lowered it to half-mast. The next morn
ing two young men boarded the boat to
ascertain what was the matter, and they
sailed the sloop into Stockton. The
drowned woman had not been at home
very much of late. She told Hansen that
she had been working out as a domestic
in Los Angeles and other cities.

A COURT OF DEAF MUTES
Two Are Defendants One J
Complaining WitnesSjOne ,
Special Prosecutor and (
a Policeman Who Can \
Talk Will Act as
Interpreter,
One of the most extraordinary
cases ever brought into a Police
Court was called before Judge Mo-
Kan yesterday morning. Two deaf
mutes were defendants, a deaf
mute was the complaining witness
and a deaf mute lawyer appeared
as special prosecutor.
From a written statement sub
mitted to the Judge by Theodore
Grady, the deaf mute lawyer, Isi
dore Bellg, the complaining witness,
who is employed as a clerk by Be
llg Bros., 108 Battery street, was on
his way to his home at IK Van
Ness avenue Saturday evening,
when he was confronted by the two
defendants, Daniel O'Brien and Slg
mund Horn, Just as he reached the
corner of Eddy street. They
pounced upon him, knocking him
down and tearing his trousers.
The defendants also submitted a
brief written statement In which
they said Sellg had been calling
them names with his lingers and
bad been writing about them and
they went to his house to demand
an explanation, when he showed
light and they knocked him down.
. Grady in writing asked for a con
tinuance til! Thursday, as his wit
nesses were not ready," and It was
granted.
The Judge will on Thursday call
into service Sergeant John Green to
interpret, as he is an adept in the
language of the dumb alphabet. He
would also like to get a deaf mute
lawyer to represent the defendants,
to make the thing complete.
O'Brien and Horn are well known
amateur boxers and | belong to the
San Francisco Athletic Club." They
are said to be experts in the manly
art of self defense. It is also said
that one of their principal reasons
for assaulting , Sellg was that he
was able to dress better than they
and gave himself airs. They are
employed in a laundry at Sixteenth
and Valencia streets.

JUNEAU, July 21 (by steamship
Rosalie to Port Townsend, July 25).â
The steamer Dora came in last night
with a few Valdes passengers and a
.number from Cook Inlet. Not much
progress in mining has been made on
the inlet this season, owing to the high
water. The Polly Mining Company,
which is thought to have the best
ground, had Its wing dam carried away.
Other disasters have seriously retarded
work, so the output of gold will net be
as large as it would have been other
wise. No new strikes are yet reported,
though many prospectors are still out.
The Dora picked up a big nameless

The noted Bars Nest gold mine on
Douglas Island was disposed of to-day
at Sheriff's sale for $25,000, Cyrus Dolph
and Mr. Snow of Portland, Oregon,
buying it in for the bondholders.
A party of thirty-six people came up
the river on the small steamers and
out over the Dyea trail last Tuesday,
only eight days from Dawson. Men
are still going down the river, but the
number of boats Is not one-fifth as
many as was on the way from two to
four weeks ago. In all the crowd and
rush It is almost impossible that ac
cidents should not occur. It is won
derful that there have not been greater
casualties. So far only about fifteen
men are known to have been lost in
the water, but about 150 wrecks have
occurred, the boats and outfits being
lost.
The thousands of new comers at
Dawson have looked around them and
begun to realize the stern reality of a
prospecting trip. Camping ground is
at a premium. The best of order Is
maintained by the Canadian police.
The bringing of Dawson within five
days of Juneau, actual traveling time,
is already having a most desirable
effect upon the cuisine of Dawson. It
is now possible to have fresh meat and
such fruit as oranges with considerable
regularity. Juneau bottled beer is now
a luxury at Dawson.
A newspaper carrier came out over
the Dalton trail, arriving here to-day.
He reports 300 men at Fort Selkirk
waiting for Jack Dalton, who Is on the
trail somewhere with several hundred
ponies. Several droves of cattle have
arrived at Dawson over this trail. The
first fresh beef sold at $1 25 per pound.
Hundreds are pulling up the stakes of
their tents and departing down the
river on the lookout for creeks to pros

Quite a number have gone on up the
Klondike, deciding to risk a season's
time on that not well-prospected river.

Bxbkl. For more than ten years I suffered severely from dyspepsia, and dur-
ing that time consulted many* physicians. First it was the family
doctor in New York, where I then resided, and later I had treat-
ment at the New York Hospital, but obtained no permanent relief.
For over a month I had visited my family physician in Bayonne,
twice in every week, and aa a last resort an appointment had been
made when 1 was tarcjibmit to the process of having the stomach
washed out by the sipnon arrangement, which is found a mode of
treatment more beneficial in its effects than enjoyable in the pro-
cess. About this time, however, I had a conversation with a
friend who wn acquainted with the merits of Ripans Tabules, and
he presented me with a box for trial. Well, I did try them, and
oould feel that they did me good, so I bought more, and in mj*
house nowadays you will always find a supply of Ripans Tabules.
I find them easier to take than powders or liquids, or even than
Bwallowing hot water in the morning. My condition is so much
improved that of late I have had no occasion to resort to them
at all Before I found the Tabules, my bill for attendance and
medicine was rarely less than three dollars a week. The Tabulea
have not only improved my condition, but have been efficacious
in the case of friends to whom I have recommended them.

â  The Oregon grain fleet seems to be hav
ing- a hard time of it. The ship Cypro
mene has arrived at Queenstown leaking.
On May 12 last a rivet started and up to
the time' of reaching port the vessel made
more or less water. The bark Tweeds
dale was damaged in a storm and had to
put into Durban, South Africa. A dls
, patch received by the Exchange yesterday
â â â¢sayi she has been in collision with the
.German bark Triton. The damage is not
known. The German ship Emile from
Portland lor Antwerp was also in col
* lision and has put into Hamburg. The
extent of her Injuries is not known.
From midnight to 5:45 a. m. yesterday
the only arrivals- were the steamers Az
tec? and Sequoia and the schooner Mon

was not a bail In sight, but ten minutes
later the schooners Sequoia, Western.
Home, Zampa, Eclipse, Amethyst,' Vik

Like all the steamers that have arrived

vouched for as having been red by the

Captain McMurtry of the fine new
.steamer H. J. Corcoran is about to for
sake, -the sea for a short time and turn
his attention to -gold mining. He has
just, cleaned up $30,000 on a little mining
deal in Tulare County and now intends
developing some fine properties he owns
â¢In Fresno and Calaveras Counties. Cap
tain McMurtry found out yesterday,
much, to his disgust, that had he and his
partners he!d on to the Tulare property
another, week they would have doubled
their money. Captain McMurtry resigns
his command of the Corcoran on Aug
ust L
Owing to a break down on the new
river steamer H. J. Corcoran last Satur
day there were a number of disappointed
people in both San Francisco and Stock
ton. The steamer's cylinder head was
damaged during the run up the river,
and it will be a couple of days before
she is on the run again. When the T. C.
â¢Walker reached Stockton on Sunday
morning it was decided to take the City
of Stockton out of retirement and put her
on the Corcoran's run for that evening,
In consequence F. Daggatt. the able chief
steward of the Walker, had his hands
full. He got his men aboard the Stock
ton, cleaned her up thoroughly, fur
nished up all the rooms, got the 'kitchen
D working order and had a first-class
meal ready and everything in apple pie
>rder when the steamer left her dock for
San Francisco at 6 p. m.
The new steamer Aloha has been
placed on the berth for St. Michael. She
has first-class accommodation for about
=eventy passengers. As she is to tow up
Lhe new river steamer Queen of che i
Yukon, those who go up on the Aloha
nay be reasonably certain of reaching
:he gold fields without delay.
There was a small strike aboard the
steamer Centennial yesterday. The ves
sel la having new plates put under her
oollers and the work goes on night and
Say. The boilermakers and the night
shift demanded double pay, and when it i
was refused them they walked out. The â

H. Tabrett, the marine superintendent
says he had no difficulty in rilling the
strikers' places.
A letter box which Postmaster Mon
tague has caused to be placed at Peter

All the revenue cutters and men-of-war

Now every boat that comes to the Fol

letters to mail. Merchant vessels are
also much accommodated by it and it
will prove a godsend on the sailing day

of the soldiers sends a farewell letter
ashore to be mailed.
The gunboat Iroquois came down from

VALENTINE WISHES
TO DISCUSS MATTERS
DOES NOT WANT WELLS-FARGO
SUED FOR WAR TAXES.
Will Urge the Merchants' Association
Not to Begin Action Against
the Transportation
Company.
From appearances It is safe to conclude
that J. J. Valentine, president of Weils,
Fargo & Co., has decided not to commit
if for his organisation In writing
in the matter of evading: the payment of
war taxes. A few days ago the directors
af the Merchants' Association came to
the conclusion that Wells-Fargo's Ex
press Company Is doing a high-handed
of business in charging its pat
rons with thf- 1-cent war tax, which the
law says shall be paid by common car
riers whf-n the latter give receipts and
furnish bills of lading. No sooner did the
directors rf-arh this conclusion than they
mmunlcatlon to the United
District Attorney, notifying him
that xhv law Is being violated ajid de
manding of him that he prosecute the of
ra. There was nothing for the Fed
eral official to do but to comply with the
aerrands of tho merchants, and after con
ferring with the officer* of the associa
tion as to the br-st mode of procedure
plans to the desired end were adopted.
These decided and speedy actions on the
part of the officials and merchants cvi
â â  Induced Mr. Valentine to bestir
himsf.-lf. for on Saturday afternoon he
;alled upon the officers of the association
md asked that no civil or other proceed
ngs be begun until he could draw up and
present to that body a communication.
While willing to do all possible to ac
commodate the president of the express
company the work of getting the cases
n shape was continued. Yesterday the
officers of the association were informed
ay Mr. Valentine Ah at he did not. desire
:o write what he could tell In much less
:ime and with much less trouble What
le wants now is the privilege of address
ng the directors of the association at an
?arly date. The merchants considered the
request and came to the conclusion that
It would do no harm If it does no good j
to allow the gentleman to say what he i
dexlros.
The line of argument that ho has prom- I
leed to present is to induce the merchants !
not to begin any action against the com- <
pany for violating the laws. In support
of this request he declares that it would
not bo worth while for the merchants of
this city to put the company to trouble
and expense when the same questions
are now before the courts in several of
the Eastern cities and that the decisions !
in those cases can be made to apply to
the local situation. The decision of tha
directors of the association to grant Mr.
Valentine an audience will In no ;
way affect the work in the actions to j
be taken. Meanwhile the association is i
preparing the evidence in several cases j
now on hand on the lines advised by the
District Attorney. Mr. Valentine will
meet the directors of the association to- i
morrow morning.
METHODIST MEETING.
Sabbath Collection and the Anti-
Saloon League Discussed.
Rev. E. E. Dodge spoke before the
Methodist Ministers yesterday morning on
"Sabbath Collections." He said: "The
placing of the general Sabbath collection
before the sermon has been imposed upon
us by the General Conference. In more
than three-fourths of the Methodist
churches outside our large cities the en
tire average income, only excepting spas
modic effort at the close of the year, is
taken on the Sabbath in loose plates, in
envelopes, or in both combined. I think
the average Is increased by one-fourth or
one-third If it Is taken directly at the
close of the sermon and a short prayer. If
before the sermon, over many the spirit of
worship has not yet grained control, while
if the sermon has been spiritual and has
lifted them to a little higher plane of de
votion and sacrifice, as all true preaching
does, even not directly on the Bubject,
they will be far more ready to give liber
ally than at the beginning. I have never
tested it that I did not find the result as
here stated."
Rev. E. S. Chapman addressed the Pres
byterian weekly meeting on the peculiari
ties of the Anti-Saloon League. "Never
was the hand of God more manifest than
in this movement against saloons." said
he. "Nothing so interferes with our work
as the liquor trade. The saloon man
drags down and wrecks what we build up.
The rum power can not paralyze the.
church work with the Holy Ghost in it.
but if you remain indifferent in regard to
It your efforts along church lines are par
alyzed.
"One of the peculiarities of the Anti-
Saloon League is to right the attitude of
the Government. In adopting it we make
no political pledges nor are we pledged to
affiliate with political parties. The Gov
ernment's relation is the worst feature of
the liquor traffic; any drunkenness ia
bad enough. Those who lead others to
drink are as bad. but the worst still ia
that it is done under the protection of the
Government." ... _
Rev. J. B. Dickson addressed the Con
gregationalists on "Should Christianity
Bean Ecclesiastical Unit"" He was lis
tened to with great interest, and his pa
per was discussed at length.
FREAKS OF THE STAMP TAX
It Will Cost Two Cents to Give Away
One on a Bottle of Whisky.
The manufacturer of a brand of whisky
which is specially advertised for its me
dicinal qualities recently sent a bottle of
SUSPECT LOCHNER AND OTHER WITNESSES IN THE
MURDER MYSTERY.
his product to Washington to find out if it
required a stamp. The stamp is required
on all such products when advertised me
dicinally, and the proprietor was bo in
formed." In the wrappings was found a
promissory note which Is packed with
each bottle promising to pay the bearer,
on demand, one cent. This was not.-: by
the eagle-eyed commissioner, and he also
i-strueted the manufacturer of the medic
inal whisky that he must place a two-cent
documentary stamp on each promissory
There are several other mannf ac
re of bitters and whiskies who have
been packing these notes with each bottle,
and the law will apply to all of them. In
the future they will be obliged to pay two
cents for the privilege of giving away one.
OPERATING A BANKING GAME
The Cases of W. D. Valentine and
M. K. Burke Continued Till
To-Day.
W. D. Valentine, charged with conduct
ing a banking game at 19 and 21 Ellis
street, surrendered himself at the City
Prison yesterday morning and was re
leased on his own recognizance by Judge
Conlan.
The case was put on the calendar of the
Judge's court along with that of M. R.
Burke arrested Saturday for the same
offense, and when they were called the
prosecution asked for a continuance till
to-day, hut the. Judge insisted upon the
cases going on. It was argued by attor
ney Cook for the defendants that Valen
tine had been convicted for a similar of
fense recently and on appeal Judge Cook
did not sustain the Judgment of the lower
court.
Finaiiy It was agreed to continue the
cases till to-day at tho request of Assist
ant District Attorney Dunne, who was
called into the prosecution.
AGAINST THE
NEW WOMAN
Rev. Mr, Dodge Saus That
Just the Plain Woman
Has a Mission Far Above
the Platform or the Field,
the Store or the Legisla
ture.
In his talk before the Methodist
ministers yesterday morning on
"New Methods in the Polity and
Customs of Methodism" Rev. E. E.
Dodge touched on one subject In
particular that aroused his disap
proval. That was the representa
tion of women in church councils.
He said: "If we can put off any
real decision of the matter past one
more general conference it will de
cide itself. The whole new woman
movement, of which it Is but apart,
has long passed its highest wave of
influence or power.
"Any foolish but not wicked no
tion is always killed the most easi
ly and surely by giving it plenty of
rope. The whole movement is rap
idly approaching innocuous desue
tude. The highest womanhood is
coming to realize a God ordained
mission far above platform or the
field, the store or the Legislature,
In which mission she, next to the
Almighty, rules the world."
THE SAIST FBAJNTCISCO CALL., TUESDAY, JULY 26, 1893.
NO LIGHT ON
THE MYSTERY
Nothing New Told in the
Carpenter Case.
LOCHNER ON THE STAND
HE HAS PREPARED HIMSELF
FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION.
Lizzie Riley and Prieur Retell Their
Stories â The Inquest Will Be
Continued This
Morning.
The Inquest in the Carpenter murder
case began yesterday morning in the
Coroner's office. The session lasted three
hours, at the end of which time Coroner
Hawkins declared an adjournment until
this morning. All the important witnesses
in the case were examined, but nothing to
establish the identity of the murderer
was elicited, nor was there any testimony
to connect Joe Lochner with the crime.
The witnesses were a cosmopolitan lot
and their testimony was given in con
glomerate dialects. A Japanese, a colored
woman, two Frenchmen, a Spanish
woman, two Irish policemen and a Ger
man (Lnohner), were on the stand. Al
phonse Prieur. the night clerk at the
Hubbard House, told his story in broken
French-English, and became greatly con
fused -when the Coroner questioned him. '
( Lorhner enjoyed the discomfiture of
Prieur and Biniled broadly at his errors.
A motley crowd filled the Coroner's of
id listened with rapt attention and
evident relish to the vile testimony Intro
duced to show the depravity of Joe
â¢ Lochner. Captain Seymour was there, of
â¢ , to prompt the Coroner when lie
oked anything.
i Mrs. J. Q. Anderson, mother of Sadie
Carpenter, dressed in deep mourning, ar
' rived before the crowd. She was greatly
! agitated and with difficulty controlled her
She listened to a portion of the
: testimony and then went to an adjoining
i room, and remained until she was i
S to the witness stand to establish the iden
tity of the deceased.
] >r. John Gallagher, the autopsy sur- i
| geon, was tho first witness called. He
read from notes tak^n when he performed
the post mortem and explained in detail
to the Jury as he proceeded. He said:
I made Internal and external examinations
Of the body "f Mrs. Sa>li^ i 'arpenlt-r. which
are very important. In the first place the l. tdy
was that of a poorly developed, poorly iiour-
Ished woman, weighing about 105 pounds. I
flrÃt maci>- an external examination ol the head,
and found nothing out of the ordinary, except
minute hemorrhages, which gave the skin a
â  and salt appearance on the foreheai.
This condition also existed inside the eyelids
and on the eyeballs. In the rlcht eye I found
a ft"'- of blood which had come out of the right
nostril, which shows that the hpad must have
been tilted veiy far back. The right nostril
was filled with blood and the mouth firmly
closed. <>n thf- right lateral surface of the
neck. Just at the hair line, below and behind
the ear I found a bloody mark one Inch square.
That wafi the only marl; on that side. On t lie
angle of the Jaw. right Fide, there was a blaelc
and blue mane about the size of a dlmSl one
ri^ht below it and another nearer the point
of the jaw. There were no marks on the leit
side of the neck. <Â»n the front of the i> â¢ â k,
just Opposite the "apple" there were two plight
abrasions, and around the neck a faint tracing,
or Btreak. The veins of the body were dls
tendpd with blood. Thrr*- were no visible
marks on the flesh. On the right knee there
was a triangular abrasion one Inch long by
one-half Inch wide. There was also a bruise
on the back of the left .shoulder. By the In
ternal examination I found the tissues of the
scalp filled with dark blood; the brain con
gested and the lungs distended and bulging
out. Hemorrhages were ulso found on the sur
face of the lungs. The heart was normal.
The pharynx and larynx were filled with
bloody mucus, and the middle cartilage of the
larynx was frnctured on both sides and Oiled
with blood. The Inside of the larynx was Â«lUd
with blood down to the continuation of the
trachea. Blood extravasations were found In
the lungs, which were deeply congested. All
other organs were normal.
In reply to a Question as to the cause
of death the doctor gave his opinion that
"death was the result of asphyxiation,
due to strangulation."
Coroner Hawkins handed Dr. Gallagher
the rag which was found around tho
dead woman's throat and asked him if it
could have been tied in any manner to
product- the strangulation referred to
Tho doctor answered In the negative.
Lizzie Riley, "Spanish Lizzie," all
dressed up for the occasion, took the
stand next. She told of being awakened
by a noise which seemed" 1 to come from
Sadie's room. She heard a door slam
and retreating footsteps. becoming
alarmed, she went out and called the
night watchman. Ho did not respond and
sh<- called again. She told him there was
trouble In one of the rooms, she thought
in No. 10. and asked him to knock on
Mrs. Carpenter's door. He demurred and
she told him to waken Lochner. He
rapped twice on the latter's door before
receiving a reply. Lochner came out in
the hall, the night clerk unlocked the
door and the two men entered room 10.
She heard one of them say, "She is
dea." After the gas was lighted she
looked In nnd saw Sadie's face on the
pillow. Thon she went Into her own
room. She swore that she did not say
anything to Lochner or Prieur about
hearing a noise like some one being
choked or strangled.
(Incidentally it might he remarked that
the police have not yet learned the name
of the party who was with the Riley
woman the night of the murder.)
Alphonse Prieur, the night clerk, fol
lowed Lizzie, and corroborated her testl- '
mony as to the incidents In the hall be
fore he unlocked the door. He opened
the door and entered the room ahead of
Lochner. Ho went to the gas fixture In
the center of the room and struck a
match. Lochner had stepped behind
him and gone directly to the bed. When
the light was turned on he saw Lochner
untying the cloth around Sadie's necÂ«.
Lochner remarked, "Oh. xny, I think
she is dead." Prieur went for an officer,
leaving Joe alone in the room. "When he
returned the door was locked and Loch
ner was not there. The police came and
the body was taken away.
Charles Raulet, proprietor of the Hub
bard House, testified that he was in the
halls of the building between 12:45 and 1:20
the night of the murder, and went to the
passageway leading to Lochner's room
Just before leaving to see if t)\e latter was
burning the gas. He swore that there
was no light in Lizzie Rlley's, Sadie's or
Lochner's room. He did not see any one
in the halls and heard no noise of any
kind.
George Yoshida, the Japanese who
makes the beds in the house, testified that
the door between Sadie's and Lochner's
rooms was usually locked with the curling
irons, although on one or two occasions
he had been in her room when Joe's door
was open.
Special Officer Gllioy told of being called
by the night clerk and going to the room.
He ascertained that the woman was dead
and th^n turned the case over to Police
man Tuite.
Deputy Coroner Tyrrell s testimony con
flicted "with Lochner's statement re
garding the position of the rag. Tyrrell
Baya the rag was rolled up under the wo
man's neck, and that he did not think it
had been tied around her throat.
Dennis Linlhan. who was reported by
one of the detectives on the case as the
man who wore squeaky shoes and went
down the stairs at 1:20 Sunday morning,
swore that it was 3 o'clock when he went
to work. He was called at 1, but over-
Coroner Hawkins informed him that he
was not bound to answer any questions
unless he felt disposed to do so, and then
told Lochner, the suspect, to take his
time and tell all he knew about Sadie
Carpenter and her death.
Lochner talked very slowly and care
fully and seemed to be well prepared for
an ordeal. He hesitated between words,
but his manner showed he had read all
the papers had said about him and had
prepared his tale. He is not a fool by
any means, and the "sweating" to which
he* has been suhiected by the police has
given him good practice in turning points
to lils own advantage. He did not devi
ate from his last statement to Captain
Seymour, made last Friday, and he agnjn
declared he saw the rag around Sadie's
neck by the reflected light from across |
the street. Loehner illustrated to the ]
jury the manner in which the cloth was j
knotted and how he untied it.
Lochner again declared that Lizzie
Rlley said something about choking as
j he and Prleur entered the room. He gave
thai as his reason for going so quickly
to the bed. After he saw Sadie was dead
he kissed her three times, "once for my
self and once for each of her children."
When Prleur went out for the officer he
rushed to his room and partially dressed
himself. Then he went to the Bellevue j
saloon and told the bartender Sadie had
I been found dead in her room. He re
turned and found the officers in the room.
'I he body was taken away and he was
taken to the City Prison.
At this point Coroner Hawkins de
clared a recess until this morning at 9.
It has been impossible for the police to
ascertain definitely the condition of the
bed when Lochner entered the room. He
says he did not disturb the covering. He
put his hand beneath the counterpane
and felt her heart. When Special GUfoy
arrived he found the body covered up to
the neck. He disturbed the covering.
When the Deputy Coroner arrived he
found the. bo<ly partially uncovered.
Lochner has told conflicting stories on
this point. Coroner Hawkins hopes to
unravel this tangle to-day. Lochner is
to be rigidly cross-examined at to-day's
lon.
Mrs. Anderson still believes in Loch
ner's innocence.. When the recess was
declared Lochner jumped up and hur
ried over to where she was sitting. She
greeted him warmly and they talked to
gether for several minutes. Later, with
a mutual friend, she called on Lochner
at tne prison nnd remained in conversa
tion with him for more than half an hour.
Unless something startling is developed
to-day Lochner will undoubtedly be re
leased by the police.
WARNING TO KLOFDIKERS.
The Treasury Department Calls At
tention to Unscrupulous Trans
portation Companies.
A warning has been sent out by the
Treasury Department to all person who
contemplate going to the gold regions In
Alaska and the Northwest Territory to
beware of fraudulent transportation com
panies.
Three cases have been brought to the
attention of the department where per
sons were induced to sign contracts with
some of the companies. The contracts
were cleverly worded and promised not
only to bring the gold seekers into the
land of promise, but also to furnish them
with the necessary equipments and sup
plies. In many cases a list of bankers
and business men, who were located as
a rule in Europe or Mexico, is appended
to the prospectus as references.
Instead of taking the promised care of
the Argonauts the wily employes of the
transportation companies have carried
them up to Vancouver or some other
northern port and there abandoned them
As a rule the price charged for transpor
tation and all other accommodations has
been $500. As it costs, as a rule, some
thing less than $50 to carry passengers to
these points the unscrupulous "com
panies" have been making largo profits
out of their enterprise.
The Free Trade Sold.
The schooner Free Trade was sold by
auction in front of the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday by order of the Dis
trict Court to satisfy libels against her
She was purchased by J. C. Hansen for
$356. The sale of the Tiger was postponed
until Thursday.

CAR TRACKS
TO BE REMOVED
Horse-Car Rails Ordered
Off Market Street.
BRITT ASKED FOR MORE TIME
BESOLTJTION TO BEMOVE OVER
HEAD WIBES DEFEATED.
Preparing- to Extend the Police and
Fire Alarm Telegraph System
to Other Districts of
the City.
The Board of Supervisors declared yes
terday afternoon against the further
maintenance of horse car rails on Mar
ket street, between Second and Sixth.
The Superintendent of Streets was au
thorized to remove them after August
6 if the Market-street Railway Company
refused to do so. That portion of Market
street is now being prepared for bitumin
ous pavement and the Supervisors decid
ed that the work of tearing up the rails
should be commenced without unneces
sary delay, inasmuch as the claim has
been made that the company no longer
has the right to maintain or use the
tracks on which the horse cars are be
ing operated.
After the transaction of the regular
routine business Secretary Dodge Intro
duced the following resolution and asked
its passage:
Resolution No. (Fourth Series.)
Whereas. It is advisable and for the put lie
interest and convenience that Market street
from Second to Sixth street should be paved
with bituminous rock on a concrete founda
tion; and whereas, contracts were awarded to
pave a portion of said Market street frim
Second street to Sixth street, on the presump
tion that the different companies operated
tracks on said street and had the ripht to con
struct, maintain or operate two double tracks
under the several anil separate franchises
granted; and whereas, the Market-street Rail
way Company on October 14. ]V<3, by virtue of
the consolidation of the several street railroads,
is the successor in interest of all the rights,
privileges and franchises granted on Market
street and has the exclusive management of
said street railroads: and whereas, the Market
street Railroad Company, under the provisions
fo section 499 of the Civil Code has no power
or authority to maintain or use in any manner
or for any purpose the respective tracks now
laid and operated by horseears on the north
westerly and southeasterly portions of the
roadway of said Market street; therefore
Resolved, That the Clerk is hereby directed
to advertise for proposals to pave that portion
of the width of the roadway of Market street
from Second street to Sixth street from
a point seventeen and one-half U7 I *.) feet
from the curb lines on the northwesterly line
of Mnrket street to a point within two (2) feet
of the track of the Market-street Railway Com
pany on which cable-cars are operated; also
from a point seventeen and one-half (lTVs* feet
from the curb line on the southeasterly line of
Market street to a point within two feet of
the track of the Market-street Railway Com
pany on which cars are operated: therefore
Ri lived, That the Market-otret Railway
Company be and is hereby required to r
fmm Market street the outside tracks of
street railroad now operated by horse cars
under its management as being maintained
on said street without warrant or authority of
law on Or before the fith day of August, 1898,
and the Superintendent of Public Streets Is
hereby charged with the duty and is hereby
required to remove all rails and other obstruc
tions on *;ii'l street on and after the 6th day
of Auguet, 1898, so that the public may have
an uninterrupted use of that portion of Market
street.
Resolved, That the Superintendent of Public j
Streets is hereby required to prepare speciflca- \
tions for pavint? that portion of Market street '
from Second street to Sixth street, excepting i
such portions of sAid street as have her> -
been exempted, where other noiseless pave
ments have been laid between the points
named.
Supervisor Britt said that he would
have to vote against the resolution, in
asmuch as the hoard had requested City
and County Attorney CresweU to render
an opinion on the question of the power
of its members to direct the removal of
the rails. "We should out of courtesy to
Attorney Creswell wait until he has
given us his legal opinion," concluded
Britt.
"I am not desirous of showing any dis
courtesy to Mr. Creswell." said Super
visor Dodge, "for I hold him in the high
est esteem. I believe, however, that we
should act at once. He was requested
to give us his opinion several weeks ago
and we have not yet heard from him.
If the rails are to he removed the work
should he done before the street is bi
tuminized."
Britt then moved that the resolution he
laid over for one week in order that At
torney CresweU be allowed time to file
an opinion.
"The City and County Attorney intim
ated to me to-day, said Mayor Phelan,
"that the company had no legal right to
maintain the horse car rails. He said he
was still looking up the law, but hatl not
been able to give the question all the time
it required, inasmuch as he had many
pressing duties to attend to as a member
of the Board of Election Commissioners."
"I have been informed by two of the best
read attorneys on municipal matters,"
said Supervisor Dodge, "that the railroad
company has no longer any right to main
tain the objectionable rails and operate
horse cars on them."
"I would prefer to wait until we hear
from the City and County Attorney," said
Britt. "If we have the right to order the
rails removed, no harm can come from
waiting another week. If we have the
right to order them removed by the St,-â¬et
Superintendent, I am in favor of exercis
ing ihat right, but I don't want to be too
hasty in the matter."
Britt's motion for a postponement was
not seconded, and the resolution was
passed.
In this connection. It is proper to state
that Street Superintendent Ambrose sent
a communication yesterday to Superin
tendent Vining of the Market Street c'nin
pany, directing him to remove the horse
car rails and also do the necessary re
pairing and bituminizing of that parr of
M.'irket street between Second and Sixth
streets, over which the company opera n-s
the cable road. The franchise gTanted the
company, requires the corporation to keep
the street in repair between the rails and
two feet outside the outer rails.
Supervisor Dodge next attempted to
start the crusade against overhead wires,
but failed. He Introduced a resolution or
dering the Western Union Telegraph,
Electric Light and the Telephone Com
pany, to remove their overhead wires on
Market street between Second and Sixth
streets, and place them underground.
"We should commence at once on the
work of causing the removal of these
overhead wires," said Dodge, "and the
time for starting is opportune. Now that
Market street between Second and Sixth
is being repaired we should see that the
wires are put under ground before the bi
tumen is laid."
Britt and Devany were of the opinion
that all the wires should be placed under
the sidewalks instead of in tae street.
Rivers and Morton remained silent, but
when it came to a vote they sided with
Britt and Devany and the resolution was
lost.
The finance committee was directed to
provide in the next tax levy for a new
central office for the Fire Alarm and Po
lice Telegraph Company and for 150 new
police and tire signal boxes.
Bids were received for the furnishing of
150 boxes and the apparatus for five sta
tions. The Gamewell Electric Municipal
Company made a bid of $35,000 and the
Municipal Signal Company of Boston one
of $38,000. The necessary certified check
accompanied the bid of the latter com
A Philippine Heroine.
One of the Philippine insurgent leaders Is a
beautiful woman whose life seems to be
charmed. She has often rushed bravely Into
the very teeth of death from guns and cannon,
but has never been wounded. Frequently we
see people in this country who live so long that
their lives seem charmed also, but the only
charm about it is that they keep up their
strength and vitalize their blood with that cele
brated remedy. Hostetter'a Stomach Bitters.

pany, but there was none with the lowest
bid. Inasmuch as a certified check is re
quired with all olds it is probable that the
sub-committee will reject both bids and
readvertlse.
The City Engineer was directed to pre
pare a diagram of the property that will
be benefited by the grading of Seven
teenth street, between Uranus and Ash
bury streets, in order that the necessary
assessments may be levied. He was also
directed to fix the official grades of Pre
cita avenue and the other streets on Ber
nal Heights.
A resolution bearing on the granting of
licenses for boxing exhibitions was laid
over until after vacation.
The bid of J. H. Bingham to keep the
bituminized streets in repair for $30,000 a
year was rejected. When the bids were
opened several weeks ago it was found
that Bingham was from $15,000 to $20,000
lower than any other bidder. When ques
tioned yesterday he said that he would
live up to the specifications. It was then
discovered thjat the specifications had
been faultily drawn. The Supervisors in
tended that in aadition to repairing, the
contractor was to do all necessary repay
ing of such strets as have been heretofore
bituminized and are now beyond repair.
The other bidders Included repavlng in
their bids.
A proposal for new bids for the work
will be prepared before the next meeting.
A petition from the Typographical
Union, asking for the use of the assembly
chambers next month when the State
Union meets, was referred to the building
committee.
Supervisor Smith introduced a resolu
tion making it a misdemeanor for junk or
second-hand dealers to buy lead pipe,
boilers, gas or electric fixtures, etc., from
any but licensed peddlers and licensed
plumbers. He said that if the resolution
passed it would go a long way towards
stopping the looting of unoccupied houses.
The resolution was referred to the health
and police committee.
A resolution authorizing the employ
ment of Charles Gildea at a salary of $175
a month, to prepare data from vie assess
ment roll to be used before the State
Board of Equalization, was Introduced.
Action on It was deferred until the next
meeting.

SIEGE OF PABI3.
An Interesting Lecture by the Very
Rev. J. B. Hogan on the "Dark
Days in France."
There â was a large audience In Metro
politan Temple last night to listen to tha
lecture by the Very Rev. J. .B. Hogan.
S.G.D.D., president of St. John's Seinl
nary of Boston, on "Personal Remlnls
eenses of the Siege of Purls." The hall
was decorated with the national colors
and evergreens.
Prior to the appearance of the lecturer
there was presented a varied programme
which included an introductory address
by J. J. O'Toole, president of St. Ignatian
Council of the Young Men's Institute,
under whose auspices the lecture was
given; an address by Judge R. Y. Hayne,
president of the evening; an instrumental
duet by Messrs. Grennan and Brusher;
vocal selections hy the Columbia quartet,
and a selection by the orchestra.
The principal speaker, the officers- of
the council, a number of the local clergy
and prominent members of the Young
Men's Institute occupied the platform.
The orchestra, after rendering a patri
otic overture, played "The Star-spangled
Banner" and before the first bar had
been rendered the entire audience rose
and remained standing till the last note
was played and then gave vent to its
appreciation by l"u<l applause.
Judge Hayne delivered a brief address
in which he alluded to what the reverend
speaker would tell the assemblage.
The lecturer, who was a res
ident of the city of Paris during the try
ing times of the Franco-Prussian war,
gave a most Interesting account of the
terrible days when the capital of France
was in a state of siege, telling of what
he saw from the beginning to the end
and detailed the causes that led to the
war which terminated in the triumphal
entry of the German army into the
Queen City of the world. The speaker
was frequently applauded.
Chinese Without Certificates.
The case of Ah Fook and William Fook,
-who were brought before Commissioner
Heacock for examination, has been post
poned until next Friday. The Chinamen
in question have no certificates, but make
the claim that they were at sea on Ameri
can vessels at the time the Chinese reg
istration lnw was passed and have had
no opportunity to take out certificates.
They arrived here on the steamer R. D.
Rioe from New York on July 4. The cap
tain expresses himself as sick and tired
of Chinese sailors and hopes the two men
will be deported.
Democratic State Convention.
Chairman Alford of the Democratic
State Central Committee has issued a
call for a meeting of the committee of
fourteen appointed to fix a date for the
holding of the State convention. The
sub-committee â will meet to-morrow aft
ernoon :it the California Hotel. It Is al
most certain that August 17 -will be the
date selected. That will give the con
vention time to complete its labors be
fore August 23, when the Republican
State convention will meet in the sam*
hall at Sacramento.
Tea for the Fish.
Forty packages of China tea, recently
seized by the Custom-house officials as
unfit for food, were dumped into the bay;
yesterday.

THE AGNEWS SCANDAL.
ACCORDING to reports from San Jose Mr.
Frank Hood Gould, with his confederate
Trustees of Agnews Asylum, Dr. Curnow and
Mr. Hale, put in most of their time on Sunday at the
asylum, where they had a conference and a lunch
with Dr. Sponogle. As a result of the conference or
the lunch they seem to have parted in a good humor.
Curnow and Hale returned to San Jose and Jim
Rea, while Gould, who has taken up his lodging at
Agnews, remained with Dr. Sponogle.
In the natural order of things the confederated
trustees ought to have preserved for themselves the
attitude of impartial judges of the charges recently
made against Sponogle and certain other employes
of the asylum. This, however, is a case outside the
natural order of things. Mr. Hood Gould has a half
brother and something like a whole girl involved in
the scandals, and, as for Curnow and Hale, they have
heaven knows what at stake, for the San Jose boss
has an ax above them, and were it to fall they might
get such a shock as would cause them to lose their
heads altogether.
So it appears that the three, instead of acting as
judges in the investigation of the acts of the em
ployes of the institution under their charge, are to
appear as participants in the offenses to some extent.
They are to stand or fall with their favorites, and
have prepared the whitewash beforehand so that the
accused parties may be made as decent looking as
possible when the time comes for the three to pro
claim their innocence and embrace them in public.
Whether this style of conducting an investigation
of some of the gravest charges ever made against the
employes of a public institution in this State will be
permitted to pass unpunished remains to be seen.
The State officials will have something to say about
it, and their saying may render futile all the cunning
plans laid at the lunch and the conference on Sunday.
In the meantime there is one thing to be guarded'
against. Mr. Hood Gould has shown as a Commis
sioner of Building and Loan Associations that >he
knows how to make one kind of report to the Gov
ernor and then alter it to please his friends before
printing it for the public. He may try the same game
at Agnews. The State officials will have to watch Mr.
Gould. While he is now in the position of legitimate
game for an official shot, it must not be overlooked
that he is one of these hell diver ducks that is good
at dodging.
Only a few weeks apo a syndicate article by Mil
lionaire Hooley was going the rounds. It told people
how to get rich, and, above all else, counseled
honesty. Now that Hooley has failed, It appears that
he had so much advice to give there was none left
for home use.
Agnews officials charged with misconduct have
planned out just the sort of investigation they think
would be satisfactory to themselves. It may be neces
sary to inform them that a whitewashing matinee per
formance is not the programme.
The six fellows who enlisted in a Nevada company
for the sake of getting Government rations were evi
dently victims of an acute form of hunger. Contem
plation of the rations has given more than one pa
triot pause.
The chaps who while General Wheeler is at the front
fighting are trying to get into his Congressional
shoes may succeed in defeating him, but they are not
going to win the regard of people generally.
A niece of Commodore Schley is going to Madrid
for the purpose of promoting peace. It is believed,
however, that her uncle will be able to do more
effective work in this direction.
Somehow we miss from the Examiner the old
tendency to praise General Shafter. Can it be that
so small a thing as having its correspondents bounced
from Cuba has displeased it?
Even if, as Le Matin says, all Europe has agreed
that the United States must not hold the Philippines,
all Europe has forgotten to take the United States
into the agreement.
There is a dull thud coming, and when it has been
heard the $25,000 head of Aguinaldo will be in the
basket. That man is personally too many.
Judged by the proclamations he is uttering now,
Aguinaldo is as anxious to be king of dudes as Presi
dent of a republic
Shafter's expulsion of Examiner correspondents
was merely a legitimate feature of the effort to stamp
out yellow fever.

cigarettes, but their pink tea privileges are intact.

THE SILVER VIEW.
THE Herald at Salt Lake seems desirous to
make public its confirmed and crystallized opin
ion that Mr. Hearst and Colonelette William J.
Bryan are fighting this war, that the President and
the military and naval strategists of the Government
are mere spectators, whose duty is done when they
cheer as Colonel Bryan bests an army or takes a city,
and Mr. Hearst soars superior to the rules of English
grammar and composition, in communicating the vic
tory to his newspapers.
It is with a shade of regret that we notice that the
joy of the Herald over the feats of Colonel Bryan
and Mr. Hearst is not a purely patriotic emotion.
Its origin does not seem to be m love of country, but
in hatred pf The Call. The Herald is sure that The
Call was displeased when Colonel Bryan went down
into the tropics and took Santiago, destroyed Cer
vera's fleet, threw Pando into a panic and made all
those waters too hot for the paint on any ships but
our own, and therefore the Herald rejoices and re
marks that seven millions of men who voted for
Colonel Bryan for President rejoice also.
It further records the pleasure that is abroad in its
office, from the rubber doormat in front to the out
pipe of the sink where the forms are bathed in a solu
tion of concentrated lye, because Mr. Hearst has es
tablished an edition of his N. Y. Journal in
Santiago, and has a letter from President McKinley
flattering his enterprise. We regret, again, the motive
that impels this pleasure, for it is advertised to be in
the belief that The Call i^ frantic with jealousy be
cause the President adds himself to the means used
by Mr. Hearst for advertising his papers.
The Herald is entirely wrong. Jealousy of Mr.
Hearst's methods is not found among legitimate
newspapers like The Call. Their success depends
upon using the old-fashioned ways of common
honesty and common decency. They are entirely un
affected by the presence of Mr. Hearst. The seller
of good butcher's meat is not hurt in his trade by the
crows which fill on the carrion they find in the roads
and fields. His customers will not eat the carrion
and the crows will not eat good meat. It is so in
journalism. The Call has no market among those
who crave what is spumy and rank. That is Mr.
Hearst's field, and he fills it with the ardor of natural
fitness. It is legitimate to praise him for it, too.
There is no reason why the President should not
commend Mr. Hearst for his zeal in his chosen work.
If a man choose to purvey carrion, why it is all right
to approve him for sticking to it. Of course he makes
sacrifices and gets kicks, but the latter are part of his
assets. They advertise his business. At Santiago, for
instance, the military commander found it necessary
to tear down Hearst's posters and drum him and all
of his correspondents and employes out of the lines
and to forbid their return and prohibit their presence
in any camp of the army or any ship of the navy
within that military jurisdiction. This action, which
has not been necessary in the case of the correspond
ents of The Call and the other decent press of the
country, is exactly in line with the President's letter
to Mr. Hearst. It certifies that he is a purveyor of
carrion, and that the article he furnishes is good
carrion, because it is so offensive that the American
army and navy cannot stand it. In the same sense
The Call highly approves of Mr. Hearst and his en
terprise. We stand in line with the Pope, with Presi
dent McKinley, with Theodore Roosevelt, with Mr.
Cleveland, all of whom have given Mr. Hearst a cer
tificate as a paerless purveyor of carrion.
Now the difference between all of m and the
Herald is, that it insists that Mr. Hearst furnishes
fresh meat.
THE PARTY OF THE PEOPLE.
rROM the responsive acclamation given by Re
publicans generally to Chairman McLaughlin's
declaration of opposition to "boss rule, corrup-
tion in politics and the domination of corporations,"
it is evident the phrase will be made the watchword
of the party in the coming campaign. It is one of
those sentiments which catch the attention of the pub
lic by being uttered at the right time, in the right
place and in the right way. It is the best rallying
cry that can be formulated at this juncture, and will
be potent in rousing loyal Republicans throughout
the State.
As the time for opening the political campaign
draws nearer it becomes more and more evident that
the supreme issue in this State is to be one of elimin
ating corrupting influences from our politics and es
tablishing honesty and a patriotic regard for the pub
lic welfare. The tariff issue is virtually dead, and
the silver issue is dying fast. In support of neither
of these bygone policies could any candidate for office
hope to be elected in California this year. The people
are almost unanimous for protection and sound
money. This being so the one question now before
our people is that of electing honest men to office and
making our State administration and our delegation
in Congress truly representative of the great masses
of the people.
The Call has repeatedly pointed out that this is to
be a year of independent voting, and not a yellow
dog year by any means. Being virtually relieved
from any immediate fear of further free-trade tariff
nnkering or any fiasco experimenting with the mone
tary system of the nation, the people will vote for
those candidates whom they regard as being freest
from any form of subjection to bosses, to corruption
or to the domination of grasping corporations. It
is in fact to be the people's year, and the party which is
most truly the people's party will win.
Chairman McLaughlin has very justly stated in an
interview published in The Call yesterday that "our
party as a whole in this State is more free from boss
rule and outside influence than any other party, bnt
we must eliminate from it every vestige of such in
fluence and prove by our actions and our selection of
various candidates that we and they are in fact of
and for the people." The truth of the statement is
beyond gainsaying. The defeat of the bosses in Re
publican conventions means Republican victory at
the polls. The triumph of the bosses would mean the
defeat of the party.
The State Central Committee has now done what
it could to prepare the way for honest politics and
to assure the accomplishment of victory. It now
rests with the rank and file of the party to profit by
the fair field that has been provided for them. The
primaries will not show victories for the people if
the bosses are left free to control them. All loyal
Republicans must therefore begin now to prepare for
the contest. They must register. They must or
ganize. They must go to the primaries. They must
vote for the election of free, independent and honest
delegates. They must show that the Republican
party is indeed the people's party in practice as well
as in precept and principle.
Perhaps the use of a hatpin in a fight between laun
dry ladies is legitimate. It is when a man is stabbed
by this weapon that the rules of civilized warfare are
violated.
Blanco is reported as making light of Santiago's
fall. That man seems to be a compound of optimism
and general foolishness.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 26, 1898.
ThjE CASE OF LOCHNER.
THE inquisitorial method pursued bythe Chief of
Police of this city in detecting crime is wholly
wrong and ought not to be longer tolerated.
Besides being illegal it is an outrageous violation of
the principles of personal liberty. The method pre
vails in France and is pursued by the police authori
ties of Russia, but no other civilized nation in the
world permits it â certainly none in which the per
sonal rights of the citizen or subject are a matter of
concern to the Government. A sworn warrant is al
most everywhere required as preliminary to incar
ceration, and it ought to be here.
Some days ago a woman was strangled to death in
a Fourth-street lodging-house. No one knows who
committed the crane, but Chief Lees has determined
that a miserable fellow named Lochner who roomed
in the house shall be tried for it. In pursuance of his
method of convicting all persons whom he suspects,
the Chief has placed Lochner in the "tanks" and sub
jected him to a rigid cross-examination. Denied the
services of counsel, securely confined in a dungeon,
and compelled to undergo the searching tortures of
the detectives, it is really a wonder that the wretch
has not broken down and "confessed" the crime. A
weakerman might have done so. Even an acute man
might have so tangled himself up as to run the risk
of a term in prison.
Yet during his confinement no charge has been
preferred against Lochner. He is just as much en
titled to his liberty as Mayor Phelan or the Chief of
Police himself. He has simply been taken by force,
put in the "tanks" and held for days on suspicion of
having committed a crime with which there is no
direct evidence connecting him. Had Chief Lees
"suspected" Auditor Broderick or Assessor Siebe of
this crime there is no reason why they might not
have been subjected to similar treatment.
Perhaps Lochner is really the murderer of Mrs.
Carpenter. It is barely possible that the "sus
picions" of Chief Lees will in this case be verified.
We do not care to discuss the facts of this particular
case at all. The question we desire to ask is simply
this: What authority has the Police Department for
locking citizens up on suspicion and subjecting them
to the torture of a one-sided cross-examination?
Lochner's liberty is just as precious to him as any
other man's. If the Chief of Police can lock Lochner
up on suspicion he can lock Charles Webb Howard,
William Alvord, E. B. Pond or any other citizen.
All he need do in any case is to send a policeman
after the victim and order him incarcerated. If this
method of detecting crime in San Francisco is to
continue, if the "small book" and the "tanks" are to
be used in this manner for verifying the suspicions of
the Chief of Police â in short, if Chief Lees is to con
tinue to be the supreme arbiter of personal liberty
hereabouts â it would be well to make his detective
theories a subject of legislative consideration. At
present he frames his own "rules." This power, at
least, should be taken from him.
Personal liberty has been the jealous care of all
ages. Millions of lives have been sacrificed in
achieving it. A century ago Sir William Blackstone
said that the moment the power is left to any magis
trate "to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his
officers think proper (as in France is daily practiced
by the Crown) there will soon be an end of all other
rights and immunities." This is as true to-day as
then. Yet the custom of jailinp men without warrant
of law prevails in this city. How many persons have
been arrested and detained on "suspicion" by the
Chief of Police during the past year? That is a ques
tion the Grand Jury should investigate. Usually the
Chief is careful to lock up only poor and friendless
citizens. But this fact ought not to influence ac
quiescence in the custom. The Grand Jury should
make the Chief show his "small book" and open the
"tanks." Nobody knows at this moment whom he
has locked up on "suspicion."
AFTER THE WAR IS OVER.
JUDGED by a European critic nothing could
be more absurd than the proposed national con
ference called by the Civic Federation of Chi
cago to discuss the future foreign policy of the Unit
ed States. A debate by an assembly of private citi
zens, however prominent or eloquent, on such a sub
ject, would be regarded by a foreigner as of a mere
academical nature â something like a village debating
society expanded to national proportions. He would
not be able to understand why any considerable
number of men should take the trouble to participate
in such a debate, nor why any organization should
be willing to defray the cost of it. Its arguments and
its conclusions are seemingly to be of no value.
Congress and the President will decide in due time
what is to be done in every emergency of our rela
tions with foreign countries, and the proposed grand
conference so far as an alien can see will be no more
than a species of oratorical circus free for all and go
as you please.
In the United States, however, we are accustomed
to such conferences. They fill a large part in our
political life, and in some respects are hardly less im
portant than Congress itself. It is through them
that our people formulate opinions on new issues and
arrive at definite conclusions. We have had them at
every stage of our recent history to discuss each
broad issue that has arisen. We have had slavery con
ferences, reconstruction conferences, tariff confer
ences, money conferences, irrigation conferences, and
now in the natural and inevitable order of things we
are to have a conference to discuss the much-vexed
problem of what we shall do with the colonies cap
tured from Spain.
While the proposed meeting, like all others of a
similar nature, will end in talk, it will not be wholly
useless. The American people have at present but a
vague idea of the factors in the problem they will
have to solve when the time comes to determine what
is to be done with our captured possessions. Accord
ing to reports from Washington the commercial or
ganizations of the country have as a rule urged the
President to hold all the acquired islands as a means
of extending our commerce, while on the other hand
strong protests against such a policy have been re
ceived from other classes.
These differences of opinion are mainly founded
on differences of interest, bbt to some extent they
rest on different conceptions bf the facts involved in
the issue, and the conference on the subject may have
the effect of removing some of them by eradicating
popular misconceptions of the conditions of the
islands and the responsibilities we would assume in
annexing them.
The Chicago movement is, therefore, one to which
we can look forward with considerable interest. It
is only in America that the people meet to discuss in
large assemblies the policy of our Government,
but the custom harmonizes well with our gene
ral institutions and political processes. What is said
or resplved at Chicago will not settle anything, but
it will help form public opinion, and public opinion
in this country settles everything.
At least there will be some difficulty in inducing
the Spanish to accept the theory that the Oregon was
at the fight off Santiago only in the capacity of spec
tator.
HOW TO FAIL ..A LESSON FROM LEES.
Thanks to Chief of Police Lees' efforts, the mystery which surrounds
the death of Mrs. Sadie Carpenter is deepening day by day. The evidence
taken at the Coroner's inquest held yesterday only increased the gloom,
and the inquiry, so far as it went, achieved no other result than to elicit
from witnesses, male and female, a mass of filthy, unprintable detail
which can have no possible bearing on the case. Do the police imagine that
they are going to find a clew to the crime in the sewers? Do they think
that, from out this - ..ass of garbage, they are going to pick one grain of
relevant truth?
If there ever was a case which required careful, artistic handling, It Is
the present one. The task of detection in this class of crimes is aJways
difficult, often impossible. Witness the famous series of Jack the Ripper
murders, which paralyzed Whitechapel with fear and defied the best efforts
of the Scotland Yard detectives. It requires all the dramatic ingenuity of
a Lecocq, all the subtle analysis of a Sherlock Holmes to arrive at the
true solution of such problems. Of course we do not expect Captain Lees
to rival either of these famous sleuths of fiction, but we may at least look
for a little plain, ordinary common sense in his methods of procedure.
The unfortunate woman, Mrs. Carpenter, who seems to have been
above most of her class in intelligence and culture, lived in a milieu which
Is essentially favorable to the commission of such offenses. She roomed in
a large house, which is literally, ap the evidence shows, a den of vice. De
bauchery, by day time and night time, permeates the place. Most of the
witnesses whom the police have gathered together belong to the lowest
class. Yet no one with any knowledge of human nature would dream of
looking for the murderer within the walls of the building. The people
who lived in it were admittedly vicious, but their vice was not of a kind
which leads to violent outrage. It was too ignoble, too retreating in its
character; its votaries were too effeminate to be capable of such murderous
passion.
Look at Lochner, as he sits in his chair at the crowded inquest. He is
a pure type of the degenerate, such as only great cities â where all that is
worst in human nature focuses itselfâ can produce. Undoubtedly his ap
pearance has not been improved by his illegal detention in the tanks, com
bined with a week's cross-examination and bullying by Captain Lees. Yet
he is self-composed enough as he tells his ignoble tale. If he has any shame
left within him he does not show it. His figure, when he stands erect, still
bears traces of military discipline; his face, before dissipation marred its
outlines, might have belonged to the fine, determined German type. He has
the high, square forehead, the massive chin, the firm mouth and the some
what subdued nose of his race. But drink has played sad havoc with him;
his eyes are we:.k and watery and undecided in color, while his hair is thin
and patchy, and his mustache has lost that military trimness which is the
delight of all Teutons. Of course one cannot look for elaborate toilets from
out a prison, and doubtless, with careful grooming and decent dressing,
Lochner could still be made quite presentable.
In such a being, his whole moral fiber sapped with unmentionable vices,
one does not expect to find much nerve. Yet if Lochner really murdered Mrs.
Carpenter he possesses the most wonderful self-possession ever vouchsafed
to mortal man. Freed from the bully and bluster of the police torture
chamber, he gave his evidence clearly and collectedly. He even took up
the rag which he claims was tied around Mrs. Carpenter's throat, and
though his hands shook slightly, showed by practical demonstration how
the fatal knot was tied. He had an answer ready to every objection, he
knew exactly which shutter in the room was open, so that sufficient light
entered to enable him to discern the murdered form of Sadie Carpenter,
and the bandage round her throat.
All the other witnesses told their tale with equal fluency. Indeed, this
was only to be expected. It was the natural outcome of the long series
of dress rehearsals which Captain Lees has been holding during the past
week. The Coroner's inquest yesterday was but the stage performance
of an empty and unmeaning comedy which the police have been carefully
preparing. Every one of the actors has been painstakingly trained; their
cues are thoroughly known. So they said their little parts with perfect
ease and fluency, and the police, forsooth, expect us to accept this sort of
thing as evidence.
Apart from the illegality of Lochner's detention and constant exam
ination, its utter folly amazes me. Supposing him to be guiltyâ and we are
yet as far away from any proof of this as ever. If there were any weak
points in his story, he has had ample time to find them out without com
mitting himself. He has read in the papers all that the other witnesses
have to say about the case, and has been able to make his story agree
in every point with theirs.
Take, for instance, the light question, upon which Captain Lees has
laid much stress. The police have tried to show that Mrs. Carpenter's
room was in darkness when Lochner and the night clerk entered it. Yet
they claim that Lochner walked straight to the murdered woman's bed
and untied the knot in the bandage round her neck. Obviously, unless he
already knew It was there, it would have been impossible for him to do this in
the dark. Now, if Lochner had been kept in complete ignorance of all that
was going on, if he had not been fully informed of the statements which the
other witnesses were going to make, a question like this might have been
sprung upon him, when placed under examination in open court, with dis
astrous effect. But Lochner, thanks to the police, was fully prepared; he
had no hesitation In stating that the upper blind of the center window was
open, and that thereby sufficient light was admitted to enable him to dis
cern, outlined against the white pillow, the dark line around the woman's
neck.
Take another witness, Mrs. Rlley, an abandoned woman, living In the
same house. She claims to have heard a noise, a gurgling noise, followed
by a sliding sound, as if the bed was being moved slowly across the floor.
How she could have heard a gurgle through two closed doors, and along
a crooked passageway thirty-eight feet long, is not explained. Besides,
the medical evidence shows conclusively that Mrs. Carpenter was not stran
gled by means of the rag round her neck, but was smothered with a pil
low or some other soft article. Persons dying under such conditions do
not usually gurgle. Then Mrs. Riley admits that she was entertaining a
soldier visitor at the time, but she either cannot or will not disclose his
identity. Why have not the police found this man? Possibly he might
furnish the key to the enigma, or at least he could substantiate Mrs.
Riley's vague statements. She claims that the man heard the noise as
well as herself, but that he asked her not to interfere, as he did not wish
to get mixed up in any trouble. Here was a line of investigation which
the police might, with advantage, have followed, had they picked up the
scent at the outset. Now the trail Is confused, and it is too late to do
anything. It remains to be seen -whether Captain Lees has any further
exhibitions of his Thespian tactics to offer when the inquest is resumed
to-day. J. F. ROSE-SOLET.

What, a paradox is presented by the ml

not against their entering as citisens,
because they tiro not oitltens of Hawaii,
but simply against their oomlng In in
bodily presence?. Sinro they ire already
in how can they be prevented from com
ing in?
I take it that to relieve our Govern- ]
ment from the perplexing anomalousncsa I
of this situation there may . speedily bo
enforced wholesale deportation of Ha
waiian Chinese back to the Flowery
Kingdom. It would seem that this la our
only escape. If a Chinaman resident In
New York applied to a steamship agency
for a passage to San F*anclsco and paid
for it certainly there Is no law by which i
he could be prevented from coming to the
latter city. Would this not bo equally
true as to the Chinaman In Honolulu,
since both that city and San Francisco
are in the United States?

SEQUENCE IN CRIBBAGE-K. S,
Pinole, Cal. The following is the law of
sequence in the game of cribbage:
The sequence of the cards is king, queen.
knave, ten, nine, eight, seven, six. five, four,
three two, ace. The are is not in sequence
with 'the kins ami queen. The kins, queen,
knave an.l ten, though they each count ten
i thirty-.. ne in play, reckon in sequence
in the order piven. Thus: Knave, ten nine
are In sequence. If any three cards are
played in such a way that they can be reck
oned in sequence order, either Horn abova
downward or from below upward, without the
intervention of another played card out or se
quence order, the player of the third card is
entitled to mark three, called a run of three.
If a fourth card is similarly played the player
of it is entitled to a run of four; if a fifth
card is similarly played a run of five accrues,
and so on. If there is a break in the se
quence, and in the subsequent play the break
is filled up without the intervention of a card
out of sequence order, the player completing
the sequence is entitled to a score of one for
each card of it.
It i 9 not necessary that the cards forming a
Bequence should be played In the sequence or
der. Thus: A plays a four, B a deuce, A a
flvo B can then come in with a three and
make a run of two, three, four, five. After
the three is played A can come in with an
ace or a six, making a run of five, or with a
four, making a run of four. But if any card
not in sequence intervenes the run is stopped.
Thus if four, deuce, five and five are played
in this order a three or a six will not come
In, as the second five, which is no part of tnÂ«
run, intervenes.
If A plays 6, B B, A 7, A makes a r:m
of 3; if B follows with a 5 he cannc
claim a run of 3, as the Becond 5 inter
venes.

PLANS AT THE PRESIDIO.
General Miller Arranges to Ac
commodate the Troops to
Be Moved From Camp
Merritt.
The removal of the remaining troops
from Camp Merritt to the Presidio will
begin this week. There are five full reg
iments, two battalions and several de
tachments of recruits to be" removed, and
they will be transferred to the Presidio
just as soon as the necessary water
pipes for their camps have been laid. It
is possible that the first of the regiments
may be brought over to-day or to-mor
row. General Miller was at the Presidio
yesterday looking over the ground best
suited for the encampment of the men.
He said: "I have ordered the Alger bat

RECORD OF A GALLANT SOLDIER,
Major James T, Chase, Commanding First Battalion,
First New York Reaiment, U, S, Volunteers.
Major James T. Chase, commanding the First Battalion of the First New
York Regiment, Is every inch the soldk-r and veteran that he looks. He wean
his three-score years admirably, and la as bale, hearty and genial as v.hen,
forty years ago. he entered the National Guard of New York. Major Chase Is a
thorough soldier, and four years of service in the last war with many mentions
for conspicuous gallantry, have given him a just right to the honors that have
been conferred upon him. He entered the National Guard as a private in Com
pany D, Nineteenth Regiment of New York State Militia. Out of sixty men
this company furnished forty-nine officers during the last war, ranging in rank
from second lieutenant to lieutenant colonel. The company was known as the
Washington Continental Guard. Major Chase was at the fall of Charleston.
After two years' service during the Rebellion he was mustered out, but imme
diately re-enlisted and served until the end of the war. Major Chase is a resi
dent of Newberg, and a wealthy retired ship-builder. He is exceedingly popu
lar among men and officers, and his genial nature and continual courtesy have
already made him a host of friends In San Francisco.

tachments will l>e conveniently located
in suitable camps somewhere upon the
reservation. I shall move my head
quarters to the Presidio as soon as all
of the troops have been gotten away
from Camp Merritt."
In view of what was said by General
Miller, a.* well as what could be Learned
from other reliable sources, it appears
that it is now General Merriam's plan to
get the New York ri siment and the bat
talion of engineers away to Honolulu just
as soon as possible, and it is very prob
able that the next two transports that
sail will carry these troops to Hawaii.
Neither Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole nor
Major Langbitt have as yet received any
orders to prepare to move their com
mands, but they are holding themselves
in readiness and are prepared to leave
when the order comes.

Special Orders No. IS.
1. The commanding officer Third Battalion,
Eighteenth United States Infantry, will select
from hie command one non-commissioned offi
cer and six privates for the duty of guarding
the steamer Seandia, said steamer having
been designated for the transportation of
troops to the Philippine Islands. This guard

the foot of Pacific street at pier No. 7, no*
later than 3 o'clock to-day, and should be pro
vided with six days' rations and necessary
bedding. The commanding officer Third Hat
talion, Eighteenth Infantry, will issue the fol
lowing instructions to the detachment selected
to guard the steamer Scandia:
"Two sentinels will be constantly kept on
duty, one on the ship and one on the gangway.
This sentinel will not permit any persons to
hoard the ship unless they are known to be
members of the crew or unless they are pro
vided with a pass from the depot Quarterrnaa
ter ..r from these headquartors. Intelligent
nnn-rommissioned officers should be selected
and ir termed that the object of the guard is to
prevent any tampering with the ship on the
part of persons i:i Spanish interest.
Another significant order was directed
from General King's headquarters direct
ing Colonel Funston of the Twentieth
Kansas, to have prepared immediately a
report of everything necessary to com
plete to the least detail the equipment
of the regiment. It is probable that the
hard w< rk and splendid discipline of the
Kansans will at last be recognized. Upon
this point, however, Colonel Funston re
fuses to be interviewed, paying that
doubtless his regiment will be called for
when his superiors need it.
Lieutenant Colonel Lee D. Stover, com
manding the First Battalion of South
Dakota Volunteers, has been officially
notified that he will bo first in command
of the transport St. Paul.
Throughout Camp Merrltt the appoint
ment of Lieutenant Colonel Stover is con
sidered an eminently fitting one. Besides
being an officer of unusual executive
ability. Lieutenant Colonel Stover has his
battalion drilled to a standard of effi
ciency not exceeded by any troops that
have gone or are to go.
An order was issued to him yesterday
instructing him to detail two officers to
act as commissary and quartermaster for
the boat. The detail will be reported
to-day.

enlisted with the Klghteenth Regulars.
and up to a couple of weeks ago he did
his soldier's duty and with the rest of
his comrades was impatient to get to the

Somehow his identity was discovered,
and yesterday came his reward for his
patriotism in an order from the depart

FIVE-CENT WHISKY.
The Last Effort to Gather In
All the Nickels of
Camp Merritt.
There is a hot fight on among the keep
ers of the dozen or more disreputable
joints near Tamp Merritt on Fifth ave
nue for the few stray nickels that remain
in the possession of the men of the ranks.
"With a .stipend of no more than $13 GO a
month the festive recruit and the sea
soned regular are good things for a Lim
ited season only, and as it has been some
weeks since the last regimental pay day
the aggregate of <ash remaining in tin
ranks is noi bo greai thai the individual
is exempt from rigid economy, even in
his vices. The wherewith is practically
exhausted, but the general thirst goes
right along in the uneven tenor of its
way, and it was to accommodate both
of these conditions, and incidentally to
rake In anything left in sight, that one
of the more enterprising dispensers hung
out a sign advertising B-cent whisky to
soldiers.
The r< pul t of this innovation was por
ceptlble all through camp. The f, r in mill
for a day was crowded with nickel-rich
blue coats, to the exclusion of the neigh
boring resorts, whoso proprietors Btood
before their doors and cursed their lack
of foresight. Next morning the H-crnt
sign adorned every door along the ave
nue, and claret at 10 cents a quart was
listed with the stronger beverage.
The fight was profitable for about
twenty-four hours. At the erkl of that
time roll call at regimental guard houses
hnd nearly doubled, and a search war
rant could not have uncovered a nickel
along the line. As the trade of the offi
cers goes solely to the reputable places
on Fulton street, there is nothing left to
the Fifth-avenue people to fall back
upon, and a general exodus may be ex
pected within a few days. If there be
.any virtue in boasts that have been made,
it will be in the direction of the Presidio.
Every saloon man In the district has used
his pull to have, his license transferred to

WOODLAND WANTS
A NEW COMPANY
Governor Budd Grants Permis
sion to It to Heplace the
Troops Mustered Out.
"Woodland is anxious to retrieve her lost
military laurels and Governor Budd Is
ready and willing to aid her. The citi
zens of that city have felt keenly the
odium brought upon them by the revolt
of their company when about to be mus
tered into the Eighth California Volun
teers and have sought for some means to
wipe it out. They have finally hit upon
a plan which gives bright nromise of be
ing entirely successful.
When the Woodland company marched
out of Camp Barrett Governor Budd at
once issued an order mustering it out of
service and discharging the members
from the National Guard. This action
created a vancacy in the State troops
which the Woodland people are anxious
to fill with an entirely new organization.
Woodland was always proud of its mili
tary organization and citizens formed a
stock company and built for it one of the
finest armories in the State, the allow
ance for rent drawn from the State be
ing barely sufficient to pay the stock
holders' interest on their investment.
Several days ago C. W. Bush, on behalf
of the citizens of Woodland, wrote to the
Governor, calling his attention to the va
cancy existing in the National Guard and
the great desire of Woodlanditcs to oblit
erate the past by filling the vacancy with
a new company. He spoke of the mag
nificent armory now vacant and the hard
ship to the loyal citizens who had built it
because of their inability to use t*ie build
ing for other purposes, it being especially
adapted to military purposes. He con
cluded by offering to raise a company of
not less than fifty men, to be mustered
into the State service.
On Saturday Governor Budd replied to
Mr. Bush's letter, saying, in part:
I fully appreciate the force of what you say.
If a company Is organized to the minimum
number as indicated In your letter. I will be
pleased to muster it into the National Guard
on its making application through the proper
channels.
I have transmitted your letter to the adju
tant peneral's office and Colonel Peeler will
communicate with you, or call in relation to
the matter, if you so desire.
It Is understood that this is to be an eptirely
new company, and that It shall not contain
any of the men or officers mustered out of the
National Guard.
Colonel Peeler came down from Sacra
mento last evening, and said that no re
ply had been received to the Governor's
communication, though he expected to
hear from Mr. Bush within a day or two.
Colonel Peeler said there were certain
formalities to be "-one through before
Woodland could get its company. In the
firrt place a call, signed by fift-" or more
residents of the county, who are citizens
of the United States, must be submitted
to the board of location and organization,
and upon the board's approval the com
pany could be mustered into the service.
Colonel Peeler thought there would be
no difficulty in arranging the prelimina
ries and expressed the belief that Wood
land would soon be represented in the
National Guard by a company that would
be ready and willing to perform any mili
tary service required of it.

the remaining room will be occupied by
detachments of regulars and possibly one
full regiment of volunteers.

formally turned over by her owners to

German flag which had been flying on
the steamer since her arrival in port was
hauled down and the American flag was
soon after hoisted by Mrs. Long, wife
of Major Long, the depot quartermaster,
under whose direction the purchase of
the vessel was made.
Captain A. W. Perry of General King's
staff has been put in charge of the
Scandia, which goes into the stream to
day to await orders. The German crew
will leave for the East this evening. A
telegram has been sent to New York for

Green Fruit Shipments.
The shipments of gren fruit this year
will fall short of those of last year about
1300 cars. Up to last Saturday 1775 car
loads of green fruit were shipped east.
Covering a corresponding period of last
year the shipments amounted to 1600 car
loads. The exportation of this year will
not, however, reach that of a year ago,
â¢which was 5300 carloads. Hardly more
than an aggregate of 4000 carloads is ex
pected for the entire year 1898. This will
show a decrease of 1300 carloads, compar
ing the shipments of 1897 and 1898. The
falling off in the exportation is due to the
minimized crops of pears, apricots and
peaches.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
I CHICAGO, July 25.â A slight sprinkling of
I rain that was falling here when the session
i commenced started corn easy. The market
1 soon freed, however, from this influence. Con
! tinued dry weather was the reason for addl
j tlonal strength and when the signal service
i predicted another thirty-six hours prolonga
'â  tion without rain. thÂ» trade was not slow to
! realize the situation. An active demand from
nearly all the prominent bulls started prices
!up with a rush The country had a few sell-
Ing orders In the pit at the opening. but the
1 offerings were quickly absorbed. When big
! shorts attempted to come In, it was a case of
â  bid and get nothing until the September price
touched 36He. a full cent better than the open
! ing At this point long property came out
; freely and there was active selling against
calls. The increase in offerings caused some
recession, but there were plenty of buyers at
the reduction to again advance September 3jSc
I The readiness with which Liverpool responded
I to the advance here Saturday was considered
i significant. September closed at &>lÂ«Â©3o)kC, a
grain of ! S' J i I * r
Lower quotations from Liverpool and favor
able weather for the coming crop sent wheat
down at the opening. September started at
from 6T4c sellers to 67% c and had touched
I 67Uc when the advance In corn executed a
buoyant effect. When the corn market com
menced to give Indications of having reached
: the culmination of its advances, the bears In
the wheat pit were encouraged to sell with
greater freedom than they had been doing
while corn kept on the rampage. This, to
gether with Indications of enormous receipts
everywhere the rest of the week, coupled with
a declining cash market, caused wheat to be
come very heavy. After a downward reaction
In corn the commodity began another rise,
infusing a bullish spirit into the wheat mar
i ket. September closed Â»Â»@Vjc lower on the day

Higher prices for hogs and the strength of

IN THE NAME
OF CHILDREN
Object to Powder Works
Near a Schoolhouse.
PETITION TO SUPERVISORS
COUNTY AID IS EXTENDED TO
THE HOUSELESS.
Sheriff White Makes a Requisition
That Recalls the Tragedy
in the Melrose Dis
trict, j
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 25.
It is not probable that the people of
Melrose will again have a powder works
built in their midst and close to a school
houso. This morning a lengthy and
strongly worded protest was presented to
the Supervisors signed by 250 taxpayers
In the Melrose district. The petition set
forth the fact that last Tuesday "by the
deliberate act of one of the employes of j
the Western Fuse and Explosive Com- \
pany," a large number of persons were
Killed, the works, many dwellings, and the
echoolhouse were destroyed, and nearly j
every building and residence within a mile j
of the powder magazine was more or less
damaged. The fact is recited that it is
the intention of the company to rebuild
on the old site and to resume business In
explosives. Somo of the disadvantages of
powder works in a thickly settled terri
tory are set forth as follows:
We also desire to draw your attention to
the fact that the proposed new works will
be situated within 100 feet of the Melrose
public echool, and had said explosion oc
curred at a time when the school was filled
with children the . m of life would have
been terrible. We furthermore draw your
attention to the fact that a large and ex
pensive school building costing not less
than $11,000 Is about to be erected by the
citizens of Frultvale upon a site within a
hi. -n Quarter of a mile of said proposed
â works.
We further represent that the resumption
of business by said powder company at this
point will be detrimental to the lives and
property of the people of this township and
should not be permitted.
We also desire to draw the attention of
jour board to the fact that within a com
paratively short distance of these works In
another powder and fuse factory in a
thioklv settled neighborhood and near to thÂ«
Lockwood public school, and that this fac
tory in like manner as that of the Western
Fuse Company U a continued menace to
lffe and property, and should be removed.
The petitioners then called the Super
visors' attention to the penal code section
referring to "crimes against the public
safety and health." '
The. practical side of the situation was
plainly set forth by the application for as
slftance of Mrs. Sibrian. Her home was
destroyed by the explosion, and she want
ed food and lodging for herself and four
little ones. Supervisor Talcott stated that
he had already assisted several unfortun
ates and he reported that the Alameda
Red- Cross Society was working among the
homeless.
Sheriff White also called up the explo
sion with a requisition for four pairs of
handcuffs and four deputy sheriffs r badges
to take the place of those destroyed with
the deputies last week. Edward Weidler
a deputy under Constable Koch, another
victim, filed an application to be appointed
Constable of Oakland Township. J. C.
"Williamson also applied for the same of- ,
flee. . j
KILLED BY A SNEEZE.
A IVhysician Thinks Mrs. Mat

So Caused.
KLAND, July 2S.â Eliza Mattingly, a

AS A BOY SAW THE FIGHT.
Apprentice Shaw of East Oakland Writes
With Pride From His Vessel, the Oregon.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 908 Broadway, July 25.
C. A. Shaw, a member of the well-known East Oakland family
and who Is an apprentice on the Oregon, has sent from Guanta
namo some facts regarding the work of that splendid warship, which
form an interesting supplement to the news already published. He
says:
On Sunday morning, July 3. just when we were clearing the decks for
Sunday muster, a volume of smoke was seen rising from Santiago harbor
and a few minutes later two ships were sighted crossing the entrance.
General quarters were sounded and a six-pounder was discharged while
the Oregon's whistles were blown to alarm the rest of the fleet. Very soon
the Maria Teresa stuck her nose out of the harbor, giving the Oregon and
lowa her broadside, and sending shells all around us. The terrible Vlzcaya
did likewise, but we were not asleep, and our guns were soon working to
perfection. Next came the Cristobal Color* the pride of the Spanish
navy, quickly followed by the Almirante Oquendo and three torpedo boats.
Of the latter two seemed to go up in smoke, for we saw no more of
them from the Oregon, while the third went back Into the harbor. Our
fleet for a few minutes poured out a hot fire on the Spanish ships, but the
Texas and lowa soon fell behind. We made straight for the fleet, bring
ing all our guns to bear upon Its vessels. Shells were flying all over the
Oregon, but they seemed to do her no harm., and after our fire com
menced to take effect the shells rapidly became fewer. The Oquendo was
the first to take fire and was headed straight for the beach, followed
quickly by the Maria Teresa, also on fire. The Oregon was then turned
loose on the Vlzcaya and soon put her out of the fight. We were then go
ing at our very greatest speed, and I never saw a vessel clear the water
so fast. The last of the Spanish warships, the Cristobal Colon, was
ahead quite a distance. But when the Oregon's engines were opened out
and her 13-inch guns brought to bear on her we soon ended her career as
a Spanish fighting ship. We next had to attend to the prisoners, of
whom 800 were taken aboard the Oregon.
We captured a pig (not a Yankee pig), a dog, several kittens and
some chickens, and every mess on the Oregon now has a Spanish mascot.
The Oregon got the credit of destroying four cruisers and one torpedo
boat. I suppose the Union Iron Works people are as proud as peacocks,
and everybody on board the Oregon feels like adding a feather to their
cap.
LITTLE ORTH
RAISES A ROW
Some Prominent People
Called to Court.
MRS. PRESCOTT'S STANDING
MRS. SANFORD REFERS TO A
GRIEVANCE OF LONG AGO.
The Mother Has Suddenly Taken a
Violent Dislike to the Guar
dian Whom She Once
Liked.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, July 25.
Somewhat of a sensation was created in
Judge Hall's court room this afternoon by
the testimony of Mrs. Sanford, secretary
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruel
ty to Animals. The case on trial was that
of Mrs. Dora Orth, who is seeking to have
a new guardian appointed for her little
child. At present the child Is in the care
Of Mrs. Prescott of the Children's Society,
and Mrs. Orth alleges that she is dissat
isfied with little Fauritleroy's surround
ings.
Mrs. Orth, the mother of the pretty lit
tle boy, stated In her petition that she is
afraid that the child will be kidnaped and
taken out of the State, and also that a
few days ago she visited her boy at Mrs.
Prescott's house, found him sick, and in
the care of a young sick girl. On the wit
ness stand Mrs. Orth said many pleasant
things of Mrs. Prescott in answer to the
latter's attorney. She stated that it wan
at her own request that Mrs. Prescott
was made guardian of the child, that she
visited it once a week till two months ago,
that it was always contented, that last
Christmas she was so pleased with its
care that she gave nice presents to Mrs.
Prescott and her daughter as well as the
boy, and that only recently was she dis
satisfied. Mrs. Orth made no attempt to
hide the nature of the life she is living,
but stated that she was quite willing to
pay as Bhe is paying for the support of
her boy, but she wanted him placed in
other hands.
Then came the sensation of the after
noon. About a year ago Mrs. Prescott
and Mrs. Sanford, wife of the County
Treasurer, occupied the same office in the
Central Bank building-. Mrs. Prescott at
tended to the Children's Society and Mrs.
Sanford to the Animals' Society. For
some reason or other they parted com
pany, and this afternoon Mrs. Sanford
was a witness against her former com
panion. ; il" *
"Do you know Mrs. Prescott's reputa
tion for truth, honesty and integrity?"
asked ex-Judge Frlck.
"I do," said Mrs. Sanford.
"Is it Rood or bad?"
I "It is bad."
' "Why do you say so?
"Because I have heard many people
discuss their dealings with her,'.' â 
"Why did she leave your office?" This
Question was overruled.
"Is it not a fact that you requested her
to leave because you found her guilty of
Mrs. Sanford nodded her head in assent,
but the court overruled the question be
fore she gave a verbal answer.
Attoney Will White, formerly a Dep-
II tv Sheriff, was the next witness. He
testified that Mrs. Prescott's character
was bad. He said that while Deputy
Sheriff he had heard Deputy District At
torney Moore say that Mrs. Prescott was
â  i "hard case." He had also heard Pros
prutlne Attorney Melvin say that he
would not believe her under oath. M. C.
chapman was also a witness in the case,
and gave testimony: somewhat along the
line of Attorney White's.
Mrs Carrie Judd Montgomery, Attorney
Bradley, Colonel Dimpfel and several
others are. witnesses, subpenaed by the
petitioner.; . .

keeping the child against the mother's
wish, provided that it be placed in the
care or some worthy person, is deter
mined to controvert all that has been said
about her personally. Not long ago
Judge Greene paid Mrs. Prescott a very
hlph compliment from the bench, and It
is probable that he may be made a wit
ness in the case.
In all her former litigation over the
child Mrs. Orth has been advised by Dep
uty Constable Lent, who was a victim
of last week's explosion. It is partly be
cause she is robbed of his advice that
Mrs. Orth wants a new guardian.
Mrs. Presoott was the last witness and
the case went over for a week.

BORING FOR WATER
IN BARREN HILLS
Berkeleyites Suffer, but the Water
Company Takes Its Time to End
the Drought,
BERKELEY, July 25.â Each day the water problem grows more serious,
with but faint hope of a satisfactory solution being reached within
the next thirty days, if then.
Complaints of residents are increasing; they see their yards and
gardens blighted because the precious drops that would save the plants
and shrubs and lawns and table vegetables from utter destruction must be
hoarded lest the people themselves be reduced to actual want. Fearful
householders keep constant watch on their stoves and grates, flues and
chimneys for the spark that might kindle a conflagration causing the loss
of the greater portion of the town because of the uselessness of the fire
apparatus through lack of water.
The danger of contagion has reached such a stage that It can no long
er be ignored and the meager water supply is being drawn upon to flush
the choked sewers after a primitive fashion. This is not done In the usual
manner, by turning on the water at the hydrant and giving the sewers a
thorough cleaning, and carrying off the accumulation of disease breeding
refuse to the bay. Oh, no. There is not near enough water for that. But
as a partial remedy, sprlnkltng carts are filled and drawn to each manhole
and the few hundred gallons poured Into the sewerâ barely enough to soak
up the refuse, but not to carry it away.
It is admitted that this deplorable condition Is due, primarily, to the
exceedingly light rainfall last winter, whereby the usual water sources have
become exhausted. But the Alameda Water Company, which supplies the
town of Berkeley, comes In for no small share of blame (justly or unjustly)
for not taking proper steps long before this to provide a sufficient water
supply. Early in the spring it became apparent that unless arrange
ments were made for an auxiliary supply the present condition would en
sue. The water company began boring wells in the foothills and at vari
ous piints on the plain, but with the exception of one well on Shattuck ave
nue, the search has been practically fruitless, although to-day the com
pany receieved word that water had been tapped in Wildcat Gulch, two
miles from town at a depth of 190 feeet below the surface. The flow is but
little larger than a thread at present, though the company's officers are
hopeful that a larger flow will be tapped at a greater depth.
But the real complaint is made at the delay of the Alameda Company
in perfecting arfangements with one of the two Oakland companies for an
additional supply of water. Both of these companies have offered to Bell
water to the Alameda company, but as this would necessitate the erection
of a pumping plant, the latter concern has not seen fit to close with
either, trusting to the less expensive method of obtaining: a aupply from
the parched foothills.
The Dingee company of Oakland, which claims to have ample facilities
for supplying Berkeley in addition to its regular customers, submitted an
offer to the Alameda company some time ago to supply 300.000 to 500,000 gal
lons daily, to be measured by a meter. In order to accept thia offer the
Alameda people would have to pipe the water 13,000 feet and lift it 300 feet
into the Alameda company's reservoir. An expensive pumping plant
would have to be put in, and the Dlngee people estimate that it would re
quire two weeks to get it In working order.
The Contra Costa Company has submitted a somewhat similar proposi
tion, although the water would not have to be piped so long a distance to
connect with the Alameda company's system. It would have to be pumped,
however, to as great a height as the other.
The superintendent of the Alameda company to-day admitted that
both of these propositions were under consideration by his people, but that
so far nothing had been decided upon in regard to either. He said, how
ever, that some action might be taken this week and if it were it would
require less than thirty days to make the connection* and put up the
pumps.
Meanwhile Berkeley streets are becoming more dusty, Berkeley sewers
more filthy, Berkeley lawns more withered, and Berkeley dwellings mora
liable to destruction by fire. But there seeme to be no way of hurrying the
Alameda Water Company to a speedy solution of the drought.
GOSSIP LED
TO ASSAULT
Outside Issues Come Up
in the Blackburn Trial.
WAS A POLITICAL QUARREL
TROUBLE CAUSED BY USING A
LADY'S NAME.
The Court Intimates That the De
fendant May Be Held to An
swer to the Charge of
Felony.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 25.
Many Interesting developments are
cropping up in the preliminary examina
tion of Leslie Blackburn, a politician, on
the charge of assalting \V. S. O'Brien,
another politician, with a deadly weapon.
The case opened before Judge Allen this
morning, with A. A. Moore appearing for
Blackburn and Prosecuting Attorney
Melvin for the State.
In his testimony O'Brien stated that he
and Blackburn had been brought to
gether by ex-Judge Frick, as the latter
was trying to locate the author of the
story that was derogatory to Mrs. Frick.
O'Brien said he had charged Blackburn
with originating the story, whereupon
Blackburn called him a liar and imme
diately drew his pistol. He did not shoot,
and Judge Frick prevailed on him to put
the gun back in his pocket. This occurred
last week in the Office saloon. O'Brien
said: "A party consisting of Mr. Frick,
Mr. Rohan and others started out to find
Blackburn and settle the dispute as to
who was the originator of the story. We
met Blackburn on Eighth street and
Rohan brought him to us, and then asked
me if I had told him that Blackburn
started the story about Mrs. Frick. I re
plied that I had, and he then drew his
gun."
Jack Rohan testified that after O'Brien
had told him the story that was in cir
culation regarding Mrs. Frick he thought
the lady ought to know it and the man
circulating it should be made to prove his
statements. Mr. Rowan, who had heard
from somebody that Mr. Blackburn had
eald something about Mrs. Frick, then
told a Mr. McDonald to tell his wife to
tell Mrs. Frick what had been said about
her, and In this circuitous fashion the
story reached the lady most concerned.
The witness said that he would have told
Judge Frick but he was away at the
time. He then detailed the circumstances
connected with the alleged assault.
Attorney A. A. Moore then asked for
a dismissal on the ground that there was
nothing to show any attempt to shoot or
that the revolver was loaded. Judge
Allen differed from counsel and said
enough evidence had been produced to
warrant holding Blackburn for trial un
less (/improved by the defense. The case
was then continued until to-morrow
evening, at which time the defense will
put on Its witnesses.
Public Schools Open.
OAKLAND, July 25.â The public schools

Over 400 registered at the hlph school,
and, as many do not put in an appear
ance the first day, it is expected that the
attendance will be nearly fino this fall.
Half a dozen are from the Sandwich Isl

ASSAULTED
BY A RUFFIAN
Dr. H. H. Hart's Daughter
the Little Victim.
SHE WAS ONLY SIX YEARS OLD
AN OLD PAINTER LURED HER
BY MEANS OF CANDY.
Wild Excitement in the Western Ad
dition Over the Dastardly Deed.
There Was Some Talk of
Lynching.
There was talk of lynching last night
in the ./estern Addition. The neigh
borhood of Bush and Octavia streets
was greatly excited over 'he report of
a ruffianly assault on the six-year-old
daughter of Dr. H. H. Hart, residing at
2236 Bush street.
When the doctor returned home last
Saturday evening he was informed that
his little girl had been basely used by
a miscreant whom he recognized from
the description as a painter employed
in the house. He was told that the
fellow had enticed th>? girl by means
of candy and other childish baits into
the front parlor ard there subjected
her to gross insult.
The doctor did not hesitate an In
stant. He sallied out to find the fellow,
and the police were also Informed, but
in some manner he managed to elude
their search.
Yesterday morning, however, he re
turned to finish the painting at which
he was employed at the family resi
dence. The doctor immediately tackled
his man, and on his repeated denials of
guilt, administered such a thrashing
that it is expected he will have to seek
other medical attention before he can
emerge from his hiding place.
The police in the meantime were on
his trail and he was arrested by Officer
Isaacs, who has the day beat in the im
mediate neighborhood. In some way,
however, he managed to escape, but
it is believed he - 111 shortly be recap
tured and flttiner punishment meted
out for his dastardly deed.
The doctor said last night that while
he regretted any publicity in the mat
ter, he was happy that the affair should
be known as not worse than it might
be represented. He had closely cross
examined his daughter and had sat
isfied himself that while gross liber
ties had been taken by the scoundrel
yet the little girl's health was not per
manently Impaired.
The man is dcs -ibed as between 55
and 60 years of age, wearing long whis
kers, and is engaged as a painter.
Police Officer Alexander stated that
he is satisfied from the description fur
nished him by the little victim that he
knows the assailant. He said last night
that it was undoubtedly a painter who
was concerned in a similar outrage
committed about three weeks ago in
North Beach. Alexander was employed
on that case and declares that the man
is morally perverted so as to be a men
ace to the community.

McCleave Is Safe.
BERKELEY, July 25. â News has
reached the family of Captain McCleave of
North Berkeley that Lieutenant Robert
C. McCleave Is safe. When the list of
those killed or wounded before the en
gagement at Santiago was published, the

them. Telegrams were at once dispatched
to Washington asking if further particu
lars were forthcoming-. As none could be
obtained Lieutenant McCleave was
thought by his family and relatives here
to have fallen in the attack on Santiago.
To-day, however, a letter came from
Lieutenant McCleave himself, written
from Santiago, and dated July 3. It stated
that he wbs riuite safe at the time, and
that preparations were being made for
another battle when the surrender came.
AT A BOUND TABLE.
Interesting Social Gathering of the
Women's Press Club.
A social gathering of the Women's
Press Club Association was held yester
day afternoon in Shasta Hall, N. S. G. W.
building.
The meeting, a "round table," was char
acterized by a delightful informality that
served to put aJI participants at their
ease and draw from each and every one
their very best efforts. Impromptu talks
on twenty subjects, patriotism and the
war coming in for the greater part of the
attention, were the principal features of
the afternoon.
Mrs. Marshall, president of the associa
tion, presided at the meeting and Mrs.
Reamer had entire charge of the "round
table."
Among the speakers of the afternoon
were Mrs. Skklmore, Mrs. Kingsbury
Cooley, Mrs. Eyster, Mrs. Marshall, Mrs.
Hart, Mrs. Dickinson and Mrs. Reamer.
The next social gathering of this club,
which will also be a "round table" affair,
will be held on thÂ« fourth Monday in

that patrons of the game will find little
difficulty in securing their seats, as com

Jack Stelzner is rather disappointed be
cause a second meeting between him and
Greggains looks very slim. The fireman is
not averse to a meeting, but he is so en
grossed in politics now that it will be sev
eral months before he can settle down to
a course of training. Greggains partner
in the saloon business eloped recently
with the proceds of the till, amounting to
'between $300 and $400. and as a result a

on the day of the fight. McConnell la
training hard at Blanken's with the object
of being able to weigh in at or below the
figures mentioned. As the San Fran
ciscan is growing In weight, he will find
it a by no means easy task to scale 145
pounds on August 5. Tracey's friends
state that the Eastern lad will fight at
not over 140 pounds, but then at this
weight he should put up a stiff argument.

If big Jim Jeffries cannot stir up more

doingâ not for the love of the sport, but
for the coin the fighters expect to bag.

J. W. Brooks, handicnpper. clerk of the
scales and third judge for the California
Jockey Club, is back, after making- a trip
to his home ;tt Crab Orchard. Ky., to
Louisville and St. Louis. He reports "the
fame" in a very prosperous condition In
the Missouri metropolis, owing to open
competition In bookmaking circles. Bar
r.ey Schreiber has recently added 100 acres
to his breeding establishment at Bridge
ton, Mo., and now has all the room he!
Seslrea for the breeding of blue-blooded !
race horses. Mr. l'.n">ks s;iys it does not j
require much horse knowledge to be able ;
to pick out every foul shot on the place, ;
bo thoroughly does the New Zealand
horse stamp his Individuality upon his
progeny. In Miss Marion, the genial Ger- |
man has the best two-year-old filly run- j
ning around St. Louis.
The majority of our horses of the gal
loping persuasion are participating in the
Butte. Mont., meeting and Incidentally
they are carrying off close to four-fifths
nf all the purses hung up. The most im
proved animal is Lucky Star, which fro:n
a low-class selling-plater has developed
Into a stake horse and a record-breaker.
The veteran Holly"s training may hHVÂ»
worked the wondrous change, or it may
be that the pure mountain air of Colo
rado and Montana is responsible for it.
Miss Rowena, leased of Burns & Water
house, has won perhaps the largest num
ber of races, while Ostler Joe, Lady
Ilurs;, La Mascotu. Rey Hooker and Vik
ing quite often finiFh in front of their
fields. The attendance has been good and
the meetings at Butte and Anaconda,
running tlfty-elght days in all, bid fair to
be tinancially very successful. In the past
they have been of the "mixed" descrip
tion, but this season the experiment of
doing away with trotting and pacing was
made.
At Sacramento the strings of "Ab."
Stemler, YV. M. Murry, Atkln '& Lottridge,
Dan Dennison and several other well- ;
known turfmen are taking it easy, but
will soon be hard at work preparing f >r
the State Fair meeting, which begins
early in September.
Racing on the other side of the Rockies |
has progressed far enough this season to ;
give one a good "line" on the merit* of
the various contestants. This much has
demonstratedâ that the best two
year-old lilly thus far shown in the Mid
ale West is Toluca, a Los Angeles product
by Nomad; the best three-year-old filly in â¢
the country over any distance of ground
from live furlongs to a mile and a fur
long is Briar Sweet, the sister to Dr. Has
brouck, bred near Sacramento, and by
Imp. Sir Modred from Sweet briar; while
Mary Black (by imp. Islington, returned .
to England, out of Songstress), bred in
this State and owned by the well-known
Montana racing linn, Easton & Larabie,
has tied the world's record at six fur
longs (1:12%) and beaten the best sprinters
holding forth around Washington Park,
Chicago. Toluca and five others were sold
to Charles Kerr of Bakersfteld for a sum
not far in excess of $200 when they were
yearlings. Toluca fetched $500 when
brought to the sales ring as a yearling,
W. M. Murry of Sacramento, a very good
judge of a baby racer, being her pur
chaser. After winning several races with
the filly Sam Hildreth made an offer re
ported to be $2750, and the filly has been
running in that astute turfman's colors
since early last May. Her last good win
was in the Hyde Park stakes at Washing
ton Park, where ?he defeated among
others the supposed Invincible W. Over
ton and the very fair Formero. For the
latter W. B. Sink Jr. refused an offer of
$12,500 from Charley Dwyer over a month
ago, since which time the. Conveth colt
has trained off and gallops very oiten in
the 'also ran" brigade. As young Mr.
Sink gave but VM for Formero he, *n all
likelihood, hns rued the refusal of such a
sum as $12,500 real often during the
past four weeks.
The July sales of yearlings in England
are over, and the highest-priced young
ster disposed of was Simonswood. brother
to Simonside, oy St. Simon from Daisy
Chain. The sum paid was 3200 guineas
and the purchaser was .T. W. Larnach,
owner of Jeddah, winner of this year's
Derby. Mr. L. Brassey gave 3000 guineas
for the filly Winifreda. also by St. Simon
and out of Melody, by Tynedale. The
young Ormes are doing exceedingly well
in England and will be in great demand
next season, no doubt. Orme is by the
unbeaten Ormonde (for which W. 08.

J. R Haggin, the multi-milll vi lire
mining man and the most extensive horse
breeder in America, will, it is reported,
shortly send over 100 thoroughbred year
lings to England to be loid, the majority
being fillies, for which there is a very
poor market in this country. He will be
the first to try the experiment, and the
result will h* watched with interest. Fur
more than ten years past the average for
yearlings In England has exceeded 300
guineas, while in this country the aver
age is perhaps $3do, or about one-fifth.
The alleged methods pursued of keeping
or bidding in certain of the yearlings
supposed to have leen tried and then let
ting trainers have their running qualities,
the latter bringing them to the post and
beating out the flyers of other turfmen
who have paid fancy sums for yearlings,
may have had something to do with the
determination to try the English market.
At any rate, it looks as If Mr. Hafrgin
was not satisfied with the $508 which the
last crop of yearlings averaged w*ien
sold.
Record-making has been quite common
over the Washington Park track this sea
son. Goodrich reduced the mile nnd a
half record made by Buckwa at Oakland
<2:32 1 4.) to 2:"o'i. while- two horses ran a
mile and a quarter In 2:Ct4' ; , the former
record on a circular track being: 8:06,
made by Morello, who died In California.
Mary Black tied the six furlong circular
track record of 1:12 V;.. held jointly by
O'Connell nnd Flora l,ou!se, and the five
and a half furlong record was also tied.
The Woodland boy, Dick Clawson, Is
now considered to have no superior in th<*
ranks of the lightweight Jockeys. It Is
no uncommon thlnrr for this lad to pilot
four winners In an afternoon. Last.
Wednesday, at Washington Park, he put
his first four mounts in front at the fin
ishing line. TI. Martin of Santa Clam
has not been covering himself with much
glory '>f late, and the snrne can hr- said
of M-'Xichols and little Johnny Woods.
Thorpe and \V. Martin are often seen in
front at the wind-up of a race.
MRS. STERRETT'S CONTEMPT.
The Walter Case Is Carried Into the
Supreme Court.
Mrs. Emma Sterrett is determined not
to yield up the papers which Mrs. Jose
phine Walter, as executrix of the estate
of the late Gustav Walter, thinks she is
entitled to inspect. The case of the estate
of Walter Is now before the Probate
Court. Judge Troutt presiding. The judge
directed that Mrs. Sterrett produce for
the inspection of the executrix certain
papers and letters, but Mrs. Sterrett re
fused to do so. asserting that these docu
ments and letters are her personal prop
erty and have no connection with the es
tate under consideration. Her statement
did not satisfy the Judge and upon her
persistent refusal last Thursday no found
her guilty of contempt of court.
However judgment of being ordered Into
the custody of the sheriff, with its attend
ant humiliation, was suspended in order
to give the woman's attorneys a chance
to take the matter before the Supreme
Court. Yesterday the case went to the
higher tribunal on a writ of habeas cor
pus, the petitioner claiming that she is il
legally deprived of her liberty by the
sheriff, and being held on an order of
Judge Troutt for contempt of court. She
goes on to say that ns the papers in ques
tion are her own personal property she
was unjustly adjudged guilty of con
tempt. The writ prayed for was issued
and made returnable to-day at 2 o'clock.
POISONED WITH GAS.
Moses Seligman, an Attorney, Ends
His Life in a Bathroom.
Moses Seligman, an attorney and bill
collector, with an office at 420 Montgomery
street, committed suicide yesterday after
noon at his home, 523 O'Farrell street, by
carbon monoxide poisoning. The family
state that no reason is known for the act.
Mr. Seligman came home from his oJP.ce
and entered the bath room, where he un
screwed the gas fixture, closed the win
dow and door and seated himself in a
chair to await death. Here he was found
about r> o'clock by Gustavo Keil, who, in
passing through "the hall, detected the
odor of gas escaping from the bath room.
The Coroner's office was at once noticed,
but at the request of the family the body
was not taken to the Morgue,
Friends of the family state that Mr.
Seligman was worried over the actions of
an older son, but this is denied r>y a
younger son, who claims that the trouble
had been satisfactorily arranged. Besides
these two sons Mr. Selisman leaves a
widow, whom it is feared the shock of her
husband's death will kill.
Mr. Seligman was a 7iative of Germany
and 62 years of age. He came to Oall'or
nia many years ago and had been engaged
in the practice of nis profession :>inc3 his
arrival.
MORE CARS WANTED.
Property Owners on Bernal Heights
Ask for a Tunnel.
The residents of Cortland avenue and
"Golden Gate City" south of the avenue
are sadly in need of streetcar accommo
dation from the junction of the avenue
and Folsom street, and the matter is now
being warmly discussed by the improve
ment club;--.
At first it was suggested that Folsom
street b< cut through the hill from Pre-
Cita avenue to its intersection with
Cortland avenue, but the proposition fell
through when it was found that the work
would cost about $45,000.
The railroad companies declined to ex
tend branch lines, giving as a reason the
sparse population in the new district to
be traveled. The residents, therefore,
have concluded that the only 1 thing to he
done would be to run a tunnel through
Berna) Heights on a line with Fulsom
street.
Another cause of complaint among
property-owners in that neighborhood Is
the fact that there is no adequate protec
tion against the ravages of fire. The Su
pervisors will be asked at an early date
to assist that part of the city to obtain
the needed improvements.

feited the Ritmn to the Raltlmoros after
half of the fourth inning had been clayed.
The score at that time was 1 to 1. Holmes
when at bat in Baltimore's inning struck
out. A "fan" in the grand stand yelled.
"Oh, 'Ducky.' youlre a lobster!" Holmes
replied that perhaps he was, but he was
glad he was not working for a man of
Freedman's caliber any more. Umpire
Lynch turned around and said something
to Holmes, who went to the bench.
President Freedman. who was Hitting in
the grand stand, sent a representative
down with a request that Manager Hnn
lon take Holmes out of the gamp. Hanlon
referred Freedman's request to the um
pire, who said he had not heard the re
mark and refused to take Holmes out of
left field. Freedman then came on the
grounds and asked for the expulsion of
the player, and on being refused told
Joyce not to play ball. Lynch then gave
the game to the Baltimores, 0 to 0. The
spectators, about 3000. received their mon
ey back.
President Freedman stated afterward
that he would protest the game and that
he would report Holmes to the hoard r>f
discipline. He p.ipo said that people had
been crying for gentlemanly ball playing
and they would pet it on the New York
grounds at any cost.

NEW GUNS

POLICEMEN
Wittman Makes a
Fresh Deal.
-OUR HUNDRED COLTS RIFLES
TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE TO PAY
FOB THE LUXURY.
Nearly Four Thousand Dollars and
the Good Winchesters Given
in Exchange for
Them.
The sharpshooters of the police depart
nent will now have a chance to display
heir marksmanship. As they slgnaily
ailed to bring down Havnes the mur
ierer of Lieutenant Burke, after having
tred over 100 shots at him. Chief Lees and
Captain Wittman decided that the Win
hesters which they used were in a meas
ire responsible for the failure of their
nen to riddle the defiant tinker with bul
ets.
After discussing the matter the lncom
>etent Chief and his blundering Captain
leclded to purchase a new lot of rifles,
ust to show the dear public that they
an shoot.
They sent for the local representative of
he Coifs Firearm Company, and entered
nto contract with him to supply the de
partment with 4Â» of the latest improved
'olt's repeating rifles. Yesterday the lot
.rrtvf-d at police headquarters and were
urned over to Wlttman, he of the cold
eet and clamm;' shake.
Acompanj ir.sr the rifles was a bill for
3612. "Wittman explained that the Colts
,'omnany had "kindly" consented to take
he Winchesters off his hands, allowing
ilm 14 50 for each of the 100 rifles. He be
ame so enthusiastic over the "great bar
rain." as he expressed it, that he affec
ionately poked the old Chief in the ribs,
ausing the latter to scowl and swear.
"We are all right," boastfully declared
he captain of the Central Station to the
landful of policemen, who stood around.
'Isaiah and I know a thing or two when
t comes to buying anything for the de
>artment.
"If we only had had these guns" (polnt
ng to the new rifles) "when Haynes gave
is battle the city would not have been put
o the expense of trying him for the mur
ler of our brave lieutenant."
"Wlttman intends to get a "dummy" re
embling In a way the body of murderer
laynea and have the sharpshooters en
leavor to perforate at a distance of twen
y-flve yards. By these means he hopes
o show the reading public that his men
ire not the poor marksmen that they
lave been represented to be.
SAME SCHOOLBOOKS.
Board of Education Will Continue
the Old Course of Study.
The course of study In the public
ichools will probably remain unchanged. j
Che Board of Education met as a com- I
nlttee of the -whole last night and dis
sussed a new course submitted by School
superintendent R. H. Webster; but fln
illy it was decided that the new course
pi ; ould necessitate the purchase of numer
ous new books, and would cause consider
able confusion in the school department.
Therefore the following resolution, offered
by Superintendent Webster, was agreel
ipon for adoption at the next regular ses
lion of the board:
Resolved, That the course of study for the
rear ISM be contluned and that the Superin
tendent, having consulted with the teachers,
recommend to the proper committee from time
:o time such suggestions as will tend to pro
note and render uniform the standard of effl
rlency of work accomplished In the depart
ment.
There had been much talk of putting
Hitters History In the course, but this
uras knocked out.
All the directors were present and the
neetlng was very quietly conducted.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
WIFE'S
AWFUL ECZEMA
Torture was so Intense Husband
Thought She Could Not
Live Twelve Hours.
Doctors Within Reach Could Not
Even Relieve. No Sleep
For Seven Days.
Tried CUTICURA REMEDIES.
Asleep after First Application.
Cured Well and Hearty.
I desire to inform you whatConcuÃA (oint-
ment) and Ccticcba Soap have done for my
wife. She was in the most horrible condition
of any human being, from that most torturing
of skin diseases, Eczema. She could neither
sit down or lie down, her torture was so in-
tense. I tried all the doctors that I could
reach, but she got so that I firmly believe
that she would have died within twelve hours
if I had not been advised of Ccticcra Rem-
edies and got them. A travelling man on
seeing her condition told me what to get,
and you may believe that 1 lost no time in
getting them. Greatly to my surprise, my
wife went to sleep in two hours after the first
application, although she had not slept for
seven days, nor I myself either. I followed up
the treatment, and two boxes of Cuticura
' (ointment) and one cake of Cuticura Soap did
the work completely, she was absolutely cured,
and is well and hearty to-day. If this state-
ment will do you or anybody else any good,
use it. It is straight facts, and I can back up
all I have said by fifty witnesses. I can't thank

"A GALLANT
SURRENDER"
The New War Drama
at the Columbia.
"TWO ORPHANS," MOROSCO'S
j "EAST LYNNE" WAS NOT TJP TO
EXPECTATIONS.
"The Beggar Student" Cordially Re
ceived by a Good House at the
Tivoli â Orpheum Has a
Big Bill.
"A Gallant Surrender." the new war
drama by Edward Kidder, was given Its
initial production at the Columbia last
night before a large and discriminating
audience. It is quite melodramatic and
was expected to take its place with such j
plays as "Shenandoah," "Held by the j
Enemy" and other patriotic dr.am.is, but
it did not meet expectations. It may be
that the radical change in sentiment af
fecting the North and South, which has
occurred Blnce the beginning of the pres- J
ent war, had much to do with the verdict :
last night, and we think it did, for there j
were lines and climaxes that if given six
months ago would have been greeted with
enthusiasm which were received with in
difference. It is true the production has
some palpable faults, but they can be
modified by experiment and experience,
as, for instance, in the third act. In-
Rtead of a thrilling conclusion there -was
an anti-climax for which there was little
excuse. The audience does not expect to
wait a quarter of an hour for the explo
sion of a torpedo containing "twenty
tons of powder" and not know that the
act has been performed until they learn
by word of mouth. In short, the whole
effect so laboriously striven for is lost in
a situation in which much was antici
pated. In act second the drilling scene
was not only foreign to the situation, but
prolonged to a wearisome degree, spoil
ing what might have otherwise passed for
acceptable comedy. In this connection it
may be said that the part of Mr. Char
ters as the Confederate lieutenant Is not
alone impossible in its lines and action
under such tragic conditions as are sup
posed to exist, but ia disagreeably over
drawn. After the use of a blue pencil the
character could be made quite amusing.
The plot is connected and comprehen-
Bive, but its working out does not bring
about the mental condition of the specta
tor which goes to the making of a great
war drama. Tne climax In the rally
around the flag is the prettiest scene of
I all and most nearly approaches the de
sired standard. "A Gallant ourrender" is
constructed on the regular lines, with
mortal combat, love, somo good comedy
and bright diaioÂ«rue,but the din and shock
of battle, the delicious thrill which the
spectator awaits does not come. How
ever, there Is plenty of pathos and some
really humorous situations which promise ;
well for the play when it shall have been '
properly adjusted. The merit of the pro
duction last evening was largely due to
the efforts of May Buckley, who, in the
character of Jess, again proved her pos
session of a high otvior of creative tal.-nt.
The part is a very emotional one, w<-ll
suited to her, and Is the gem of the play.
She is to be congratulated upon her con
ception of it. Sam Edwards displayed his
versatility In the portrayal of the charac
ter of the loyal and lovable old ex-alave
and made a success of his part.
In the guise of a rebel corporal always
hungry, but possessed of good, bubbling
Irish wit and humor, Thomas Leary was
thoroughly at home. Harry Mainhall
made an admirable Federal officer, and
Theodore Roberts will be quite acceptable
when he learns his lines.
Edward Bell, Alfred Hickman, Theodore
Roberts and Miss Fanchon Campoell
were cast in congenial parts. It Is to be
regretted that the same cannot be said of
Miss Madeline Bouton. Her character of
a young and attractive widow affords op
portunities for effective acting, but she
does not conceive its import and the re~

suit is superficial work that is anything
but patlsfactory. The production suffered
much from this fact.
There is good material in "A Gallant
Surrender," and with the needed improve
ment in the way of vigorous pn alng and
the infusion of more of the genuine war
time vim, which naturally belongs to it,
it can be modeled into a very pleasing
play. It goes for this week only.
Tivoli
The last week of the comic opera sea-
Bon at. the Tivoli is at hand. Last even
ing the initial production of "The Beg-gar
Student" was heard. The singing was
superb and the piece was well cast
throughout. Roma has proved a great
favorite, and iast evening- scored another
success as Laura, daughter of Countess
Palmatica. The opera opens with a pris
on yard scene, behind whose iron gates
Symon, the beggar student, and his com
panion Jan are confined. The character
of the Beggar Student is well carried out
by Phil Branson and John J. Raffael,
whose ability is well known to theater
goers in this city, assumes the role of his
companion. General Ollendorf, repre
sented in the person of Edwin Stevens,
commander of the fortress at Cracow, has
been offended by Laura, and to avenge
himself he offers the Beggar Student,
Symon, his liberty and wealth If he will
Impersonate a groat lord and in this dis
guise gain Laura's hand. This he suc
ceeds In doing. His companion, who has
also been liberated and acts as his secre
tary, in turn gains the love of Laura's
younger Bister Bronlslava, which char
acter is cleverly played by Elvia Crox.
The wedding bells chimed and all were
happy until suddenly the festivities are
Interrupted by the arrival of the jailer,
Entf-rich, played by William H. Wt>st,
with a band of drunken prisoners. This
; uninvited horde tell the story of the Beg
j gar Student's life, and amid general de
! rision he is driven from the Countess'
house. Hero the strongest features of
the opera developâ Laura's grief, her
magnificent singing, as happiness Is
wrested from her, the anger of Symon,
the surprise and griff of Bronislava,
j whose lover is also branded an Impostor,
: the despair of Jan and the cruel Joy of
I General Oilendorf when he Beea that he
is n-venged. The curtain drops on the
i second act with these conditions existing
and rises in the third with the Beggar
Student delirious with the wrongs he has
had to suffer. Later, however, he and
his companion succeed in wresting the
citadel from the oppressors of Poland;
it is proved that Hymon and Jan are
noblemen of rank, and reconciliation and
joy reign again. Many interesting fea
tures are added to the plot and those who
went to enjoy remained to laugh, so- the
performance was a success.
Grard Opera House.
The revival of "The Two Orphans" at
the Grand Opera House last night was a
pronounced success. Morosco's splendid
stock company was strengthened by the
engagement of a number of specially en
gaged actors and actresses, and In con
sequence the performance .left nothing to
be desired. James M. Brophy in his fa
vorite role of the Chevalier de Vaudrey
was a pronounced success and received a
number of curtain calls. His costumes
were most elaborate and set forth his line
figure to advantace.
Lorena Atwood and Jessie Shirley (spe
cially engaged) as the two orphans were
very gooa, while May Nanny as Marianne,
the outcast, carried off the honors among
the ladies. Ynez Dean (who played the
part of Sister Genevievo) gave a fine ren
dering of the drinking song from "Glrofle-
Girofla," "See how it sparkles, "during the
duel scene in the second act. Graeber's
banjo, mandolin and guitar class of llfty
ladies and gentlemen also played a num
ber of selections most acceptably. In the
fourth act Miss Dean sang Gounod's "A.ye
Maria."
The performance throughout was very
even, the staging was good, and all In all
Morosco's has score- another decided suc
cess with "The Two Orpnans."
The Alcazar.
"East Lynne," a drama bo full of
pathetic lines and touching situations as
to excite the emotions of even the most
hardened, was a disappointment to the
audience at the Alcazar Theater last
evening. Lewis Morrison and the Alcazar
Stock Company undertook to present the
dramatic features of the piece, but so fre
quently did the members of the company
forget their lines and fill the embarrass
ing gaps with home-made Improvisations
foreign to the discourse of the play that
the audience made no attempt to conceal
its disapproval by laughing at parts
where other emotions should have pre
vailed. One not familiar with "East
Lynne" might have supposed that It was
a burlesque instead of a domestic drama
Lewis Morrison as Captain Francis Levi
son seemed to have undertaken a part
not suited for his acknowledged ability.
On a few occasions Florence .Roberts, as
Lady Isabel, the erring wife, portrayed
her part in the spirit Intended by the
author, but even she showed that she
had not her lines well committed to mem
ory. Miss Gertrude Foster gave evidence
of the most study, but one swallow does
not make a summer, nor can one or two,
who do fairly well, carry the whole of
such a piece as "East Lynne."
Orpheum.
The Orpheum has another of Its gTeat
bills on this week. It would seem as if
the list of good thl.igs might be exhaust
ed, but the Walter Orpheum Company
keeps right on finding them and their ef
forts ore rewarded by a liberal patronage.
Four new acts are. on this week and there
is not "a weak sister," to use a theatri
cal term, in the lot. The Angela sisters
are a trio of pretty girls who sing and
whistle solos, duets and as a trio. They
scored a hit. particularly their medley of
national airs. Wilton and Stack, the
horizontal bar artists, demonstrated that
they are artists in every sense of the
word. There is a finish to their work
that gives thorn rank among the great
est in their line. The Orpheum has in
times past brought out the greatest acro
bats in the world, and Wilton and Stack
can, after their work last night, take
among the best of them. An equal
ly great act, though along different lines,
is the net of the three Marto sisters on
the tight wire. They are each very clever
and any one of them would be a drawing
card in her work on the wire alone, but
they all thre.i are on the wire at the
same time. When one stops to consider
that the slightest misstep on the part of
one would throw the others out of bal
ance, the performance by the three is
remarkable. In all their work they are
finished and show the training of a Euro
pean acrobat. The climax of their act is
where two of the girls, suspended heads
downward, take each end of the wire
in their mouths and then the third
mounts the wire, all three playing musi
cal Instruments at the time.
W. H. Windom and his Black
etone quartet scored a hit. Mr.
Windom has a remarkable voice. Joseph
Hart and Carrie de Mar appeared in a
new act, "Dr. Chauncey's Visit." In
many points this art serves to show to
better advantage the talents of this ver
satile couple than their opening act. The
quick change by Miss de Mar from a de
mure maiden to the swellest coon in town
is a very clever piece of character work.
The act is full of funny situations which
arise over a confusion of names. Gilbert
and Goldle are still favorites and Val
more appeared in a few new imitations
and the best of last week's work. Lorenz
and Allen on the bill.
The Chutes.
Tony Ryan, the "mad musician," as he
bills himself, made a wild hit at the
Chutes Theater last evening. He nlays on
a xylophone, tosses it up in the air,
catches It on the rebound and continues
one of Sousa's marches and the Inter
mezzo from "Cavalleria Rusticana" as
though nothing had occurred. The Japan
ese acrobats performed some new and
marvelous feats and demonstrated conclu
sively that they are the best of the little
brown men who have ever visited Amer
ica. Colby and Way, the '"ventriloquist
and the dancing doll, repeated their suc
cess of the last three weeks, and Barney
Reynolds, an Eastern character comedian,
made an immediate hit. Henri Maurice
Cannon, the corpulent Swiss gentleman,
continues to receive visitors every after
noon and evening.
Olympia Music Hall.
The Olympla Music Hall has Charles
Reid, a famous barytone; Gibson and Al
len, comedians; Flossie Nash, a clever
soubrrtte; Maud Rockwell, the Royce sis
ters and others on a. bill that served to
till the house last night. The selections
by Fin&ter's orchestra were well re
ceived.
Rosenberg Has Cold Feet.
William Rosenberg, a peddler, who was
arrested on the complaint of Dr. De La
Matyr, Geary street, for persisting in ring
ing his doorbell although the sign "No
Peddlers" was on the door, pleaded guilty
in Judge Conlan's court yesterday and the
Judge fined him $5. Rosenberg had in
timated his intention of testing the valid
ity of the ordinance and had demanded a
lury trial, but at the last moment changed
his mind.

OVER JONES'
CLERKSHIP
Registrar and Com

SHARP WORDS AT A MEETING
BIGGY QUESTIONS THE POWEBS
OF ELECTION BOARD.
City and County Attorney Harry
Creswell Takes Issue With
Him and Carries the
Day.
A conflict of authority between W. J.
Blggy, Registrar of Voters, and the mem
bers of the Board of Election Commis
sioners threatened for a time yesterday
to mar the opening proceedings of the
board. The Registrar felt that his rights
were being trespassed upon when the
Commissioners appointed Parker Jones
as their clerk, ignoring the representative
of the Registrar.
The debate for some moments between
Attorney Creswell and the Registrar was
a heated one. Mr. Biggy volunteered the
remark that he thought he was ex
offlcio a member of the board. To this
the reply was vouchsafed that the meet
ing was not a regular session of the
board.
"I refuse to recognize Jones as an at
tache of my office," said Mr. Biggy.
"Under what construction of the law do
you appoint him?"
"He is acting for us and we are re- [
sponslhle for him," said Mr. Creswell.
"You have nothing to do with him. We
are empowered to employ him, and we
pay hie salary."
The Registrar came back with the as- '
sertlon: "I have plenty of clerks and can '
supply a man to do the work. I will not
consent to your employing another man."
"We are not asking your consent," was
the sharp rejoinder of the City Attorney.
"We have the man we want and now de-
Blre you to go on with our work. Here- >
tofore the Registrar has taken cogni
sance of the man whom we select. \Ve
can employ all the men we want."
"I do not want any friction between the '
board and my office," said Mr. Blggy.
"We have produced no friction, but are 'â 
moving along quietly," was the compla- j
cent reply to this, from Mr. Creswell.
The members of the board were becom- !
ing mixed in the controversy when Mayor
Phelan called a halt. It was then learned
that the board works independently in
the selection of the election officials. It
has no relations with the Registrar until
it is ready to report back to him the re
sult of its work.
When it was all over it was found that
Mr. Klgery was defending his rights in
the matter as he understood them. The
utmost cordiality existed thereafter be- !
twten hin, and the board.
A second controversy developed when
the question was raised as to whether
the names of the election officers must
be on the assessment roll. City and â¢
County Attorney Harry Creswell took |
the position that it was not an indispen
sable qualification that a person be a '
property-owner. He quoted the section â 
in the California constitution referring
to the matter: "No property qualification
shall ever be required for any person to i
vote or hold office."
The aggressive City Attorney was j
ready with his authorities and followed
up the matter by presenting a motion to i
the effect: "That it is the opinion of this
committee that it is not necessary that |
an election officer be on the assessment i
roll." The. matter did not come to a vote. '
The members of the board agreed to i
proceed with their selections without re- i
gard to the presence of a man's name on ;
the roll of property-owners.
The members of the board with the ex- !
ception of City Surveyor Charles S. Til- I
ton were present when the meeting was |
called to order. The remaining members
of the board are: Mayor Phelan, City and
County Attorney Creswell. Auditor Brod
erick and Tax Collector Block. Upon or
ganizing they elected Parker Jones clerk
and immediately adjourned, going Into
executive session.
A crowd of ward politicians and place
seekers thronged the office when the
meeting was held. It was thought best,
in view of a possible clash between the
Harney and Sullivan factions, that the
work of the commissioners be done in
a less exposed place. They accordingly
retired to the private office of Mr. Biggy.
where they commenced their allotted
task.
This consisted of the selection of 60C
Democrats, who will serve first as pre
cinct registration officials and again as
officers of the election. Registration at
the City Hall will close on August 9. The
precinct registration will then continue
for five days. Three men are being se
lected for this workâ two Democrats and
one Republican. This proportion is due
to the complexion of the board, the Dem
ocrats bring in the majority.
Lists of suitable men were presented by
the representative organization of the
Democratic party. In some cases the
same name was on all the lists. Where
there was a conflict among the lists the
commissioners selected men who have
served before or men of known probity
of character.
The Republican names were not pre
sented yesterday. In this case the party
presents a. united front and but one list
of names will be presented. This will be
compiled by the Republican County Com
mittee and will be accepted in its en
tirety by the Election Commissioners.
Registrar Biggy presented the annual
report of his office for the year ending
June 30 to the Supervisors yesterday. It
told of the expenses of running the office
and of the preparations now under way
for the forthcoming election. The total
expense was $42,494 37.
DEATH OF THOMAS LARKIN.
Said to Have Been the First Ameri
can Born in California.
The death Is recorded of Thomas O.
Larkin, after whom Larkin street of this
city was named. He died on Sunday even
ing at hla residence on the corner of
Stockton and Pacific streets, from pneu
monia. He was 63 at the time of his
death.
The deceased was the Bon of Thomas
Oliver and Rachel Larkln, to whom he
was born In Monterey. His father was
then American Consul and the boy was
said to be the first white child of Ameri
can parents born in California. The fam
ily afterward removed to this city, where
Thomas O. Larkin Sr. erected the first
brick building still standing at 1116 Stock
ton street. The deceased took a promi
nent part in laying out the streets of San
Francisco.
Mr. Larkin leaves one son now at school
in "Washington, and a brother, Alfred, to
mourn his loss. On the return of the lat
ter, now in the East, final arrangements
for the disposal of the remains, which are
to be embalmed, will be made.

A HOME FOB BOYS.
New Blood Infused Into an. Old
Charitable Organization.
Several years ago D. M. Carman and
other charitably disposed people created
an Institution, called the Boys' Training
Home, which had for its object the care
and support of homeless, worthy boys.
Schools and reading rooms were provided
and work shops established where young
lads could secure knowledge and learn
some of the useful trades. The venture
was very gratifying and many boys were
benefited, besides having a place which
they could call their home. The promot
ers being called Into other fields, the es
tablishment was allowed to run down.
Last April Mr. Carman resigned, and on
May 1 remaining directors met and vot
ed "the institution out of existence, and
the home at 26 Laurel place was practi
cally closed.
The good work has not been allowed to
die. for yesterday many of tne members
of the Eureka Society for me Protection
of Children decided to revive the institu
tion, and they organized what will be j
known as the Boys' Home. The alms and j
objects of the new body will be the same
as those of the old. At yesterday's meet-
Ing the following officers and directors
were elected:
Mrs. John Pettefl, president; L. R. Goldberg, |
vice-president; Mrs. L. Marsh, secretary; Mr? i
E L. Wadham, treasurer; A. H. Hutchlnson,
resident manager. The board of directors will
consist of the officers and the following mem
bers- Isaac Upham, E. L. Wndham, D. S.

Ahem and Miss Manley.
