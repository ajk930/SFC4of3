SHAFTER'S DEMANDS FOR
SURRENDER ARE REFUSED
ENTRANCE TO HARBOR OF CARTAGENA, SPAIN, FOR WHICH ADMIRAL CAMARA'S FLEET IS SAID TO BE HEADING.
CAMPOS MAY FORM A
NEW MINISTRY THAT WILL
BE FAVORABLE TO PEACE
But tl^e United States Will Not Open Negotiations
Until SpaiQ flooounces Directly \\er Willirjgness
to Er)d the War.
NEW YORK, July 12â The
Herald's Washington corresin ind
ent telegra .s: Advices received
by the- authorities to-day from
entativea of this Govern
ment In London confirm the re
port of the resignation of the Sa
: aata ministry and announce
that General Martinet Campos
will form c new cabinet. The
selection of Campos means, the
officials believe, that the new
ministry will b^ favorable to
peace. In one sense the sel ction
of Campos is in the nature of a
sop to the army, which wields
Btrong influence . Spanish af
fairs, sin . the new Prime Min
ister must be governed to a cer
tain degree by the pressure
which it will exert.
According to official advices it has
always been the cry of the army that
it stands ready to retrieve the losses
of the navy, but should Santiago fall
into the hajids 0 the American troops
the entire army under Lieutenant Gen
eral Linares will be captured with it.
Then this response will be taken from
the army, and General Campos will
probably be relieved from the pressure
of tr t body and will be able to con
sider the proposition tr enter Into peace
negotiations with the United States.
It is known by the officials that Eu
ropean powers and the Vatican have
been making efforts to induce the Mad
rid Government to take measures to
end the war, but Senor Sagasta has
been opposed to such action, and the
: ore rai without result except to
bring .-.bout the fall of the Cabinet of
â which he was chief. A different state
Of affairs will probably exist when
Campos la installed, but untn the new
Ministers assume the reins of govern
ment the officials admit that peace talk
will be merely idle gossip.
It is positively uenied in official cir
cles that any direct peace negotiations
have been instituted or that proposi
tions <>f any kind have been submitted
to Spain by this Government. State
Department officials are chary about
discussing the outlook for the reason
that there is nothing tangible on which
to has.- their statements. They deny
emphatically, however, that this Gov
ernment has in any way intimated
what terms it is willing to give. When
Spain announces directly to the United
States her willingness to end the war
they say that the President will inform
her of the ten. s upon which he will
be v..lling to make peace.
No third power will be consulted in
any way, not even In the way of being
the medium through which the propo
sition will be made or received.
ADDITIONAL SHIPS
NOT REQUIRED NOW
NEW YORK, July 12.-A Washing-
A
ton special to the Herald says: That it
is the confident expectation of the
Navy Department that the war with
Spain will close within the next few
months is shown by the action of the
Board of Construction In recommend
ing against the purchase of four ships
for conversion into auxiliary cruisers
which are under construction at the
Cramps' ship yards.
A special board convened in Philadel
phia to inspect the ships informed the
department that they were in such a
state of completion that it will be a
comparatively easy matter to make al
terations which would result in their
transformation into third-rate cruisers.
The board fixed six months as the time
necessary to put them into conditi(m
for effective service.
It has been the belief of the depart
ment that the ships could be got ready
for sea within two months and a half.
Jn view of the length of time necessary
, to complete the ships and the probabil
ity of peace within that period the
; Board of Construction determined to
I recommend to the department that the
vessels be not purchased. Secretary
; Long will probably approve the rec
ommendation.
MINISTERIAL CRISIS
YET HANGS FIRE
LONDON, July 13.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says: The
crisis hangs fire. The Ministers still
meat in council and the difficulties of
retirement seem even greater than the
difficulties of remaining in office. The
Conservatives are not prepared to ac
cept office and it is hard to imagine a
Liberal Cabinet without an undisputed
Liberal leader. The logical conclusion
is that Senor Sagasta must accept the
responsibility <<f deciding whether or
not to open peace negotiations.
AFTER PEACE "COME
THE CARLISTS
Special cable to The Call ami the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. IKDS. by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, July 12.â Among the most
difficult problems facing the present
Government which individually and
collectively desires peace, is a dispatch
from Captain General Blanco who af
firms that the spirit of the people of
Cuba renders the proposition of a ces
sation of hostilities impossible.
The Government, if it can be so
called, when all members have their
resignations in abeyance, is in a quan
dary as to the peace proposition.
"The public has declared it would
mean a Carlist rising. A prolongation
of the war means the bombardment of
Cadiz." Such are the words to-day of
a responsible statesman. One of the
leading gentlemen to-day said in
speaking of the Carlist question, which
is a serious one of moment: "A Carlist

insurrection would be of the greatest
benefit to the regency, as it woufd con
centrate all the liberal elements around
the throne."
The Government has taken ample
measures against the Carlists should it
to-morrow decide upon peace. There
is now good reason to suppose that no
internal dissensions will be strong
enough to alter the course chosen. The
Government has telegraphed to Mon
tero Rios, President of the Senate, to
come at once to Madrid. The signifi
cance of this lit-s In the fact that Rios
is a stanch partisan of peace.
FEAR AN EPIDEMIC
OF YELLOW FEVER
Precautions Taken by the Medical
Department to Guard the Men
at Santiago.
NEW YORK. July 12.â A Washington
special to the Herald says:
"At this time of the year the city of
Santiago de Cuba is a regular hotbed
for yellow fever," Surgeon General
Wyman of the Marine Hospital Serv
ice said to me to-day.
Although according to the latest re
ports which have been received by the
medical department from Santiago
there is not a case of yellow fever
among the American troops, every pre
caution is being taken by Surgeon (Jen
eral Sternberg to prepare for an out
break of the disease among the troops
Major George W. Dare of the medicai
department has been detailed to go to
New Orleans and enlist sixty immune
yellow fever nurses. These men are to
be sent to Santiago and will be on hand
in case of an outbreak of fever among
the troops.
The Government authorities have re
ceived positive information that there
are now several cases of yellow fever
In the city of Santiago. It is greatly
feared that after the American troops
have possession of the city the disease
will break out among them, and
the authorities want to be in readiness
to successfully meet and keep the dis
ease from spreading.
VESSEL LEAVES TAMPA
WITH FILES' OUTFIT
Military Attaches From Three For-
eign Countries Sail With the
Expedition.
TAMPA, Fla., July 12.â The steam
ship Lampasas sailed from here to-day
for Santiago. She carried General
Miles' outfit. Captain Scott and his
bureau of military information and a
large cargo of Red Cross and engineer
ing supplies. Besides this there were
fifteen horses for artillery use and the
Engineering Corps from the First Regi
mont of the District of Columbia, which
has been here since that regiment left.
A large number of pontoons were car
ried, as well as shovels, picks, axes and
many other implements for the use of
the engineers in road building. The
GENERAL BROOKE
WILL LEAD TROOPS
TO PORTO RICO
Following the pall of SaQtiago the
Men Will H ave a I^est Before

NEW YORK, July 12. â The Washington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: Major General J. R. Brooke will be in command
of the army that will be sent to invade Porto Rico. General Miles
will exercise supervision in a sense similar to that in which he now ex
ercises supervision before Santiago. There will be not less than 25,
000 United States troops, not less than 10,000 of whom will be regulars.
At the fall of Santiago the men will have a brief rest, and will then
mova on Porto Rico. No more troops will be sent from the United
States to Santiago.
""It would be," said a War Department official to me to-day, "like
sending coal to Newcastle."
The place of landing lor the Porto Rican expedition has not yet
been determined upon by the administration. Landing points are scarce
on the Porto Rican coast, but a naval ba.-e similar to Guantanamo will
be captured, and it will not be San Juan. In this connection, how
ever, the Bureau of Naval Intelligence has been for several days turn
ing out matter touching upon the advantages to the United States of
the possession of Porto Rico, and especially of San Juan. One of the
advantages of San Juan as a possession is stated to be that it is al
most in a straight sailing line with the projected inter-oceanic canal.
In advance of the army will go a part of Admiral Sampson's fleet.
military attaches from Italy, Japan and
G?rmany also are on board, and a large
number of Red Cross nurses and phy
sicians. The Lampasas had in tow a
large lighter which will be used for
unloading the transports at Santiago
de Cuba.
MINES TO BE REMOVED
FROM OUR HARBORS
Cabinet Yields to a Deluge of Pro-
tests From Commercial Centers
of the Country.
"WASHINGTON. July 12.â The Secre
tary of War has ordered the removal of
all the submarine mines -which protect
the harbors of the United States against
the entry of hostile ships. This action
was decided upon at to-day's Cabinet
meeting. For weeks past, in fact, al
most since the beginning of hostilities,
the War Department has been deluged
with protests from the commercial cen
ters of the country against th; continu
ance of these mines, which operated to
the great detriment of commerce. In
certain cases influences were brought to
bear that secured an abatement of the
rules, but this only increased the dis
satisfaction in the localities where they
wore rigidly enforced. Practically it has
been impossible for shinning to enter or
leave any of the harbors of the United
States during the last two months be
tween the hours of sunset and sunrise.
The decision of the Cabinet to remove
these mines is one of the most signal
manifestations of the supreme confi
dence of the Government in the future,
and of the exemption of United States
ports from an attack at the hands of
any hostile power.
The order of removal, It Is said. Is
to apply to localities where the Inter
est of commerce demands the same. In
cases where it is safe an effort will be
made to remove the mines instead of
exploding them. Wherever there is any
doubt they will be exploded. The ac
tion of the sea In some instances causes
the dynamite in the ellipsoidal vessel*
to ooze out through the screw threads
where the plug is inserted, and unless
the best care is taken the removal of
the plug may cause an explosion.
It will be some days before the actual
operation of removing or exploding the
mines can be put in practice and the
question as to whether the interests of
commerce demand it will be left to the
discretion of engineer officers having
jurisdiction over the various districts
of the United States. Orders for carry-
Ing into effect the decision of the Cabi
net will be sent to them immediately.
Great care will be exercised by these
officers to avoid any accident.
While the mines proper are to be re
moved all the incidental attachments
necessary to their installation and
operation will be retained, such as the
casements, anchors, the cable connec
tions and the switch boxes, so that if
It is found necessary to replace the
mines it may be done on the shortest
notice.
DRENCHING RAINS
RETARD OPERATIONS
Spanish Trenches Flooded, but the
Men Stubbornly Hold Their
Positions.
Special cable to The Tall and the Xew York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1838. by James Gor
don Hennett.
HAVANA, July 12.â The American
army continued to harass Santiago, but
not in such force as yesterday because
of the heavy rains. Some of the Span
ish trenches are flooded, but the sol
diers do not complain, and continue to
hold their position heroically.
The land batteries of the Americans
bombarded Santia^n yesterday, simul
taneously with the fleet, infiirt'ing some
damage to the Santa Inez and San An
tonto forts. In town three houses were
destroyed, but no civilians were wound
ed. Of the Spanish troops Lieutenant
Francisco Diaz and fifteen soldiers
were wounded and one was killed.
The attack was begun by the Ameri
cans at 4:45 oclock yesterday afternoon.
A heavy fire of musketry and artillery
was begun from the direction of San
Juan and Sueno. The American fleet
joined in the attack an hour later. The
American fire ceased at 7 o'clock. The
Spanish held their position and the
Americans did not advance from their
entrenchments.
Lieutenant Colonel Pascual Herrera
Is seriously wounded, yet he may re
cover.
TORAL YET
DETERMINED
TO RESIST
So flnotrjer Truce Is Ar
ranged at trje City of
Santiago.
Torrents of Rair) Prevent the
Hauling of Artillery and Delay
American Operations.
BEFORE SANTIAGO, via Playa del Este, Guantan
amo Bay, July 12. â This morning General Toral sent out a
reply to General Shafter's second demand for the uncondi
tional surrender of Santiago, made by the latter yesterday
afternoon.
In his reply General Toral referred to his refusal to ac
cede to the American demand made on Sunday and again
reiterated his determination to resist.
Notwithstanding this the American
batteries did not open lire this morning,
and the renewal of the bombardment
will probably be postponed until to
morrow (Wednesday), when it is hoped
that all of General Randolph's batteries
will be in position. The siege guns
landed yesterday will also be brought
up as soon as possible.
Torrents of rain fell last night,
drowning out the boys in the trenches
and making the road almost impassa
ble. This may delay the batteries and
siege guns. The volunteers who are
being hurried on to the front are being
located along the right center in the
positions which have been occupied by
General Lawton's division, while the
latter has moved forward down to the
right, until he controls the road to
Caimes, along which Toral would have
to retreat should he now be foolhardy
enough to make the attempt.
The Cubans under General Calixto
Garcia took Caimes without opposition
on Monday night, and have entrench
ments on either side of the road. The
Americans are now in position to strike
the enemy in the left flank and follow
it up, making the Spanish entrench
ments north of the city untenable.
General Toral, realizing the weakness
of this (lank, has been busy during the
existence of thp truce in doubling back
with entrenchments and fixing his guns
in the direction from which he is
threatened. Most of General Randolph's
guns will be located upon the heights
in the center of General Lawton's new
position, where they command the
town. Yesterday afternoon the Ca
pron and Haines batteries on the right
succeeded In tearing up the emplace
ments for a "palm" battery, as it Is
called, and in plumping shells into sev-
eral blockhouses on salients, but the
shots directed at the Spaniards
in the trenches did not appear
to have much effect. Shrapnel
were rapidly broken directly over the
trenches, yet In five minutes the
trenches at every point of explosion
would be alive with the enemy. They
would watch for the flashes of our
guns and drop before the shells ex
ploded.
Our mortar fire was directed at the
Spanish bull ring, and tore up almost
everything in the vicinity. It is un
derstood the bull ring is being used as
a barracks.
Three large steamers lie in the har
bor alongside the Philadelphia Iron
Company's wharf and a small Spanish
gunboat is anchored at the head of the
bay. All these could be plainly seen
by the Associated Press correspondent.
The First Illinois Volunteers and the
District of Columbia Volunteers are
now located In the trenches that were

RAIN INTERFERES
WITH OPERATIONS
NEW YORK, July 12.â A Washing
j ton special to the Herald says: Rain
: seriously interfered with the operations
â  of the American army before Santiago
j to-day, and dispatches which had been
j received up to a late hour to-night ln
! dicate that while the position of the
. troops has been somewhat strength

i two from Major General Shafter. Gen
eral Miles, in his dispatch, which was
; received this morning, spoke of the
difficulty of transporting artillery and

necessity of having more draught anl

I and appliances for building wharves,
and as indicating the reason for the

General Shafter's second dispatch

he said it had been impossible to ac

POWDER WORKS
BLOWN UP AT
POMPTON, N. J.
Eleven Men Killed, Twenty Badly
Injured and Two Buildings
Demolished,
Fierce Fire. Adds to the Terrors of the Catas
tropheâHeroic Work of New Jersey
Troops.
NEW YORK, July 12.â Two explo
sions, which killed eleven men, wound
ed about twenty others and wrecked
two buildings, occurred at the plant of
the Laflin-Kand Powder Works at
J'umpton, N. J.. to-day. The first ex
plosion was in the house where gun
cotton was being made and the second,
presumably superinduced by concus
sion, was in the drying house, close by.
Throe men were in the mixing room
when the explosion occurred and they
were blown to atoms. Chief Engineer
Craig, who was in the engine room, had
his head crushed to a jelly in the
wreckage of the boiler house, the side
fit' which was blown out. John Phillips
was standing near a tree some distance
from the mixing house. His head was
blown from his body and was picked
up eighty feet away. His body was
friglufully torn by the force of the ex
plosion and his clothing was whipped
from his body.
The foreman of the drying room was
also blown to pieces and a number of
Italians who were digging a trench in
the rear of the building were killed.
The most seriously injured was William
Emmons, a private of Company I, New
Jersey Volunteers. He was horribly
torn by flying splinters. It is not likely
lhat he will recover. Charles Lukes of
Butler was also probably fatally in
jured.
The first explosion was at about 10:30
o'clock. Before the noise and roar of it
had died away there was a second,
louder and more terrific than the first.
The roar was heard for miles and the
concussion broke windows in all direc
tjonp. The explosion was followed by
a fire which threatened to spread to the
other buildings of the plant, in which
tons of hitrh explosives were stored.
Five companies of the Third New Jer
sey Volunteers have been stationed at
the plant since the war with Spain
began, and they were ordered under
arms and went to the scene of the ex
plosion at double-quick time. Within
ten minutes the soldiers had formed a
cordon about the entire works and
soon the firemen were at work trying
to quench the flames. Almost imme
diately after the explosion the anxious
relatives of the men working at the
mill congregated near the scene. The
soldiers tried every means to keep the
crou.l back, telling them of the danger
of further explosions and the impossi
bility of their passing the line. Women,
frantic with anxiety, tried to rush
through and the soldiers w<^re compell
ed to fix bayonets to hold the crowd
back.
As the Injured came through the lines
of soldiers the scenes of excitement
were redoubled. Every one of the
strengthened his intrenchments as
much as possible in view of the storm,
and that he has nrobabh- been able to
bring up some of the reinforcements
and extend his lines so as to more com
pletely invent the city.
Nothing is said in any of the dis
patches about any of the Spaniards
having escaped from the city, but
officials here fear that some of them
may have succeeded in geting out
and escaping in the direction of Hol
guin or Manzanillo.
Secretary of War Alger sent a dis
patch to General Shafter to-day direct- ;
ing him to send a dispatch to-night, de
tailing the situation at Santiago and
informing the department of his plans
for to-morrow. Up to this time this
dispatch has not been received, but the
President and Secretary Alger are j
hourly expecting it.
The dispatch from General Miles re- |
ferring to the difficulty a in getting the I
artillery to the front, it is believed, in- j
dicates that up to this morning Gen
eral Shafter had not succeeded in get
ting all his guns in place in the in
trenchments at the front. The dis
patches from the front to-day have i
produced the impression that Generals j
Miles and Shafter do not intend to â 
make an aggressive movement until
their greatly extended lines have been j
strengthened by reinforcements which
have arrived during the last few days,
but which the heavy rains to-day have !
probably retarded.
General Shafter's dispatch shows that
he has the city completely surrounded
on its land sides, and his lines extend
ing north of the city and down to the
head of the bay, thus shutlng off es
cape to the westward except by cross
ing the bay. _

ANTWERP, Belgium, July 12.â The Spanish auxiliary t
cruiser Cludad de Cadiz mysteriously arrived this morning *
from Corunna under command of Lieutenant Jedenco Ebariez. *
She has had her name effaced and refused to receive a visit *
from customs officers on board. The object of her visit is *
kept secret and she sailed for an unknown port this after- Â«
noon. She carries a crew of 165 men, four 5-Inch guns, two <
3-inch guns and four revolver guns. General astonishment <
was manifested at the mysterious mannerof her arrival and <
departure. *
I workingmen who came out was imme
: diately surrounded and begged foi
j word of those who had been left be
j hind, many of whom are still missing.
The fire was soon under control and
j finally quenched. The search for other
: dead and missing was immediately
I begun and will be prosecuted diligently.
! During the fire two tanks, each of
! which contained a ton of nitro-glyoer
ine, were in constant danger of being
exploded by flying sparks.
The Laflin-kand Company had been
I engaged in the manufacture of brown
i powder, nitro-glycerine, guncotton and
! smokeless powder under contract to
i the Government. The loss to the com
pany will be great, but it is said a
reconstruction of the. wrecked build
: ings will begin at daylight to-morrow
: and that the plant will be in full run
! ning order in two weeks.
After the explosion there was some
| talk of a Spanish spy being implicated
I in the attempt to destroy the powder
j mill, but the theory of the'men connect
ed with the works is that a grain of
| gravel or sand got into some powder
j which was in process of handling in
the mixing room and that as it went
through the machinery the foreign
| substance came in contact with a met
al surface and threw out a spark,
which ignited the explosive.
The list of killed is as follows:
John Craig, chief engineer of the
works.
William Brennan, car driver.
James Phillips.
Daniel Freeman, boss of the drying
room.
William Fisher, inside worker.
William Fisher Jr., helper.
John Bonnntta, laborer.
Casper Cozzino, Italian laborer.
Guido Marino, fragment of a body
found.
Jose Cossene, Italian laborer.
A canvass of Pompton Plains shows
that G. R. Garrigan, an employe of the
company, is missing.
Adjutant Patterson of the Third
Regiment says the men hf the regi
ment showed the greatest coolness in
the face of the greatest danger.
About 5 o'clock In the evening, while
the night guards were being posted,
they came across a body, or rathÂ«r
a portion of one. This made eleven
killed. This man appears to have been
working on the side of the mountain, a
thousand yards from the works. His
head was blown off. Who he was no
one seems to know.
Working in the guncotton rooms
when the explosion occurred was a man
named Fisher. The body found on the
mountain side may be his. as his rer
mains have not been found. A boy, a
son of Fisher, is also missing . He was
working with his father and he may
have been blown to pieces.

inconvenience to the newspaper dis

Guantanamo under the command of
General Perez and the regiment of Col

The rules will also be rigidly enforced
at Camp McCalla, although the general
health of the American marines is re
markably good.
The Spaniards in and around Caima
nera have been show' â erreat activity

their forces have been apparently in
creased from Guantanamo. The bold
ness of thp American launches in ven
turing up beyond the port and the pres
ence of a large number of warships in
the lower bay have evidently led the
Spanish to believe that an attack is
planned at that point.

Navy Department has been compelled
to revoke the orders directing the col

of these ships have not yet arrived at

As the Herald has stated it was in
tended the fleet of 'colliers should leave
that point on Thursday evening under
convoy of the auxiliary cruiser Yankee,
but now it has practically been decided
to send the Yankee to Santiago and
there to transfer the ammunition she

MILES ORDERS
SIBONEY BURNED
WITH ARMY BEFORE SANTIAGO,
(via Playa del Este, July 11.â Major
General Nelson A. Milos promises to
take Santiago within three days.
Shocked at the condition he found in
Siboney, General Miles immediately
ordered that the town be destroyed by
fire. He decided upon this as a sani
tary measure. General Dultield, who is
confined in the hospital, is in a very
serious co-nditlon.
CEREMONY ATTENDING
THE ANNEXATION
Hfw Bear Admiral Miller Will Pro-
ceed Upon His Arrival at
Honolulu.
NEW YORK, July 12.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Instructions are being pre
pared by the President and Secretary
Long under which Rear Admiral Miller
will proceed to Honolulu within the
! r.oxt ten days, and, upon arrival at his
destination, formally proclaim the an
nexation of the Hawaiian Islands to
the United States. It" was stated at
| the Navy Department to-day that
I the cruiser Philadelphia, Rear Admiral
j Miller's flagship, would sail for Hono
lulu by July 20. Before her arrival, it
is confidently expected, the annexation
resolution will have been approved by
act of the Hawaiian Legislature.
The authorities are preparing the in
structions under which Minister Rewall
and Rear Admiral Miller will formally
take possession of the islands. These
instructions will, it is said, merely an
nounce the passage of the joint reso
lution providing for the annexation of
the Hawaiian Islands. Rear Admiral
Miller will lake with him a proclama
tion reciting the provision of the New
: lands resolution and declaring the isl
ands are part of the territory of this
! Government, which will be read when
the ceremony in connection with an
nexation is held. The Philadelphia
will fire a salute of twenty-one guns as
i the Hawaiian Hag is hauled down and
i a second salute of twenty-one guns as
the American Hag is hoisted over the
Government buildings.
In view of the return of Admiral
j Camara's squadron to Spain the Amer
ican fleet in the Philippines will not be
Increased. Admiral Dewey has ef
; fectually disposed of all of Spain's
; men-of-war in the far East and the
j transports carrying troops to Manila
i will not need a convoy, but Admiral
'â  Dewey will dispatch vessels to the north
of jthe Philippines to meet the trans
ports ,and escort them to Manila.
Senator Cullom, who has been named
' as chairman of the committee to d*aw
up such legislation for the government
lÂ«nf the Hawaiian Islands as may be
J desirable, was in conference with the
President to-day. He has been tele
1 graphing to steamship lines regard
1 ing the sajling of the commission
and announces that he hopes it will
; leave San Francisco about August 1.
The character of the government for
t!i^ islands has been the subject of an
informal discussion in Washington. It
! has practically been decided to provide
as liberal a government as possible,
; it being the opinion that the people
; have already shown a capacity for self
i government, which should be consid-
I ered by the United States.
OUR COAL SUPPLY IN
DANISH WEST INDIES
It Is Believed Vessels Will Be Per-
mitted to Take on Fuel at
St. Thomas.
NEW YORK, July 12.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Offi
cial information has been received at
Washington that the Governor of the
Danish West Indies has prohibited the
transfer of coal owned by the United
States to American men-of-war with
out his knowledge. Before the out
break of the war 'the State Depart
ment, at the instance of Secretary Long
on a recommendation made by Com
mander R. B. Bradford, cabled to Con
sul Van Home directing him to buy
practically the entire available supply
of coal at that point. Tn accordance
with this instruction 5000 tons were
purchased and loaded on schooners
ready for transshipment to American
warships when required. Since the war
began two vessels, the Montgomery
and Minneapolis, put Into St. Thomas,
and the Governor permitted them to
take 900 tons, ISO tons on board the
former and the remainder on the latter,
sufficient to enable them to reach the
United States.
There are now, therefore, 4000 tons
of coal belonging to the United States
lying at St. Thomas. No doubt exists
in official circles that American vessels
putting into St. Thomas will be allowed
sufficient coal to carry them to the
nearest port from the supply now at
that point.

- OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 4.â
On the return of the United States
cruiser "Brooklyn to the blockade off
Santiago de Cuba, on the evening of
July 3, the lowa reported to Commo
dore Schley that Admiral Cervera, the
admiral of the Spanish fleet, was on
board. The commodore at once went
over to pay his *-espy ts.
The Spanish admiral was much cast
down by his defeat, but preserved a
dignified and courteous demeanor not
withstanding. He said he deeply ap
preciated the fact that the men of the
Brooklyn did not exult by cheering
when it was learned that he was a
prisoner on the lowa. He replied, 'n
response to the commodore's remark
that it was the fortune of war: "Yes,
but I've lost my career now that I've
been defeated."
Commodore Schley, however, told
him that such a brave deed as that of
bringing out his squadron could never
be looked upon otherwise than a most
gallant feat, upon which Admiral Cer
vera threw his arms around the com
modore and said: "Ah, sailors alway3
are gentlemen."
Cervera spoke of the accuracy and
deadllness of the Brooklyn's fire, say
NAVAL GUNNERY
WITH SANTIAGO
AS THE TARGET
Sampson's Squadron Solves the
Problem of Shelling the
Doomed City.
Aided by Signals From the Shore It Finally Gets
the Range and Can Now Do Effective
Bombardment.
OFF AGT'ADORES, July 11, 2 p. m. '
(via Kingston, Jamaica, July 12, 2:10 j
! p. m.). â The United States navy has '
I the following problem presented to it: j
j What is the best manner of effectually
bombarding a city distant four and a
half miles and concealed from view by
a range of hills 250 feet high at its !
lowest part? i
The problem has been satisfactorily j
solved. So, if the army hereafter never
fires a shot and merely guards the
roads, the navy can make Santiago un- |
tenable, if, indeed, it does not destroy
it in a few days.
Sunday and to-day the sea was calm
er than usual, so the opportunity for
good practice was afforded. In pur- ;
suance of General Shafter's request, j
Commodore Schley, Rear Admiral â 
Sampson being absent at Guanta- j
namo, at^ 3 o'clock on Sunday after
noon ranged the Brooklyn, Indiana and j
Texas within 500 yards of the shore, j
at a point almost due south of the city i
of Santiago, distant a little over four i
and a half miles. The ships were about i
a mile apart. The army signal men ;
were on the beach opposite the ships
and also on the crest of a hill overlook
ing both the ships and the city. These j
men wig-wagged the results of each
Bhot, telling the gunners if the shell j
was aimed too high or too low or not |
in line.
Sunday's practice was good, but it ;
was better to-day, when the firing was
opened by the New York, which re- ;
turned from Guantanamo during the ,
night The New York, Brooklyn and
Indiana were the ships which particl
pated in the shelling this morning.
Each shot was carefully calculated, I
ing that, in the early part of the ac
tion, one of her shells had traversod
the entire length of the gun deck, kill
ing and wounding probably eighty men.
On the Vlzcaya alone there were 110
men killed. Admiral Cervora said he
feared the losses might be greater than
he knew, for many men were below the
decks, and when the ships were on fire
it must have been difficult for them to
escape. Cervera also said that he had
no doubt that at least three ships
would have got away had it not been
for the Brooklyn, Oregon and Texas.
BIG DEMONSTRATION AT
SCHLEY'S BIRTHPLACE
Congratulatory Resolutions Sent to
the "Vice Admiral of the
United States Navy."
FREDERICK, Md., July 12.â An en
thusiastic demonstration in honor of
Commodore Winfield Scott Schley and
j his brilliant victory at Santiago was
! held in this city to-night. The com-
I modore was born here in 1840, and
! many of those who participated in to-
I night's celebration were lifelong friends
!of the naval hero. After a procession
i in which several thousand persons took
part, a mass meeting was held in Court
house Square. Hon. James McSperry,
i chief of the Maryland Court of Appeals,
presided and addressed the assemblage.
Hon. E. R. Wood of Frederick and Mrs.
I Donald McLean, regent of the New
York Chapter, Daughters of the Ameri
can Revolution, also delivered patriotic
addresses. Resolutions were adopted
congratulating Commodore Schley upon
his splendid victory. These were signed
by the city officials, engrossed and for
warded to the "Vice-Admirel of the
United States Navy."

and the wig-wagging signaled from the
shore t<i the ships where each shell fell,
and notified the gunners if they had
I the proper elevation.
The ships ran out their big guns on
the side opposite the firing, in order to
secure the desired list to port or to
starboard. General Shatter signaled
about noon that "some at the shells
fell in the bay and some in the city.
The latter do not appear to do great
Comment on this subject was changed
immediately by a message, saying:
"The last shot struck a church where
powder was stored, blowing up the
same and doing great damage."
The bombardment closed for the day
at 1 p. m., at General Shafter's request,
as he was about to send a flag of truce
into the city, in order to demand its
surrender for the third and last time.
The whole proceeding was business
like in the extreme. The ordinary avo

roar of the big guns, the scream of
projectiles and the echoes from the
mountains in the rear of Morro Castle,
plainly visible to the westward and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, July 8 (by steam
ship City of Topeka to Victoria, B. C,
July 12).â Brad Cole of Douglas Island
and William Lawson have arrived out
fresh from Dawson. They are the
first to come over the up-river trail
this summer, and they bring news that
is surprising. Cole, who is here, will
leave for Victoria in a few days to pur
chase a certain line of goods, while
Lawson has remained at Lake Bennett
to boss the construction of a scow, on
which they will take the Victoria mer
chandise into the great gold mining
camp.
The Klondike, he says, is upholding
even the most extravagant ideas of the
wealth that lies hidden in the gravel of
the creeks that descend from the
mountains, and in general the clean
up will be all that was anticipated. On
the way up the river Cole and Lawson
were never out of sight of a boat, raft
or scow loaded with grub and men
bound for Dawson. Cole says that if
they had stopped to talk to all who
wanted to converse with them about
Dawson and the clean-up they would
not have got out of the country this
summer. Two thousands of men
floating down the river just seem to be
heading for Dawson and don't know
where they are going or what they are
going to do after they get there. When
a man expecting to hunt gold gets into
the Yukon basin his troubles and hard
work are just beginning.
"Talk at-ut San Francisco or Seat
tle," he says, "why you have never seen
a lively town unless you have seen
Dawson. The clean-up was being made
when we left. There was plenty of
grub, everybody had money, and night
found all the people enjoying them
selves. The little. steamer May West,
which stuck on the fiats last fall, got
up the river just before we left, bring
ing some nails. Nails were previously
worth about $1 each in Dawson. Now
building that was delayed from lack of
nails is going ahead.
"Major Walsh decided that no liquor
licenses should be issued, and now
everybody who has liquor for sale is
running his place wide open. The
number of female inhabitants is ten
to one compared with the quota that

BEFORE SANTIAGO DE CUBA,
July 11 (via Port Antonio, July 12, via
Kingston, July 12, 3 p. m.)â When the
fire opened from the American lines
after the conclusion of the armistice
our men were in much better position.
Capron's and Hines' batteries were
posted on the heights on the left of the
line and in the rear of Bates' line. The
Hotchkiss, Gatling and dynamite guns
occupied a crest on the right center,
and on the extreme right Best's and
Grimes' batteries were posted in the
center of Lawton's division. Our right
was strengthened by a brigade of
Kent's division, the Sixth and Sixteenth
Regiments and the Seventy-first New
York, which was pushed to the west
ward until, with Garcia's line, it formed
an arc, reaching within a quarter of a
mile of Camera, which skirts the bay
and forts. The only road by which
General Toral could escape was thus
commanded.
Small detached bodies of Spaniards
had been observed slipping out of town
westward early in the morning, in
cluding a aquad of cavalry. A move
was made to cut off their retreat and
a land bombardment began. A shot
from the Grimes battery was followed
by one of Capron's guns on the left,
and from the right center the Gatling
and Hotchkiss batteries opened fire.
For the first ten minutes the firing was
quite general, .the Spaniards replying
were in Dawson last winter, and when
we left â well, we haven't any roof gar
dens in the Yukon and don't need them
in that climate, but I tell you the town
was gay. Grub? Plenty of it. Its
scarcity last winter was exasperated.
A great deal of it was bought up by
speculators. This year the Alaska
Commercial Company and the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company have 30,000 tons of provisions
coming up the river.
"Contrary to earlier expectations,"
continued Mr. Cole, "there is now
plenty of water in the Yukon. Dawson
is not exactly a Venice, but when we
left people were navigating Front
street in small boats and on any kind
of a raft or tub that would float. In
fact the river has not been so high in
a good many years. Damage to prop
erty was at first threatened, but that
danger is past. This will give an open
river for the boats at St. Michael, so
that they will in all probability be able
to make at least one round trip. But
the snowfall is not heavy and unless
there are heavy rains August and' Se
ptember will very likely show a different
stage of water."
The most surprising news brought
out by Mr. Cole is that many of the
much-vaunted and famous claims on
Bonanza Creek have turned out to be
blanks. Pay streaks have suddenly
pinched out entirely and in some claims
have narrowed down to little more
than barely pay dirt. The dumps on
El Dorado, o~ the other hand, are
large and numerous and look fat with
nuggets. Sulphur and Dominion creeks
are panning out beyond anybody's
highest expectations. The gold in these
creeks is flatter, smaller and more of
a uniform size. It is what la common
ly called coarse gold â a little thicker
than rolled oats. Hunker is reported
to be holding its own and so are all
the other claims except a number of
bitter disappointments on Bonanza.
Mr. Cole would not attempt to make
an estimate of the total cleanup, for
the reason, as he said, that he did not
know and could not form an idea that
he thought would be correct. He said
simply that all the claims had realized
what their owners expected with the
exception of some on Bonanza.
It will soon be possible to leave Pu
get Round with an outfit or any con
siderable quantity of merchandise, .n
season, and be set down in Dawson In
ten or twelve days. The distance from
Puget Sound to Dawson by way of
the down-river route is approximately
1600 miles. The railroad and the steam
ers on the down-river route will en
able the passage to be made to Dawson
in the open season at a great saving
of labor, time and expense as com
pared with the up-river route from St.
Michael. Minors will thus float down
the river instead of bucking the cur
rent.
Mr. Cole says that others are coming

spiritedly, but the rifle fire on both
sides soon waned, and from 5 o'clock
to 6:30, when the action ceased, the fir
ing was confined almost exclusively to
the artillery.
Our batteries soon got the range and
poured shells into the Spanish intrench
ments. The Hotchkiss battery swept
the outer line of the intrenchments
back and forth, cutting down the brush
shelters like a scythe. The Spanish
were soon forced to the blockhouse.
A Spanish battery on the left of the
town, engaged by Capron's battery,
fired only a few shots, but the battery
on the right fired spiritedly until a
gun-cotton shell from Wood's dynamite
gun exploded directly in front of It,
tearing up two trees and dismounting
the gun. It was the last shot of the
afternoon and was greeted with cheers.
Two men in General Kent's division
were killed by a shell and several were
wounded. Sergeant Jefferson, Private

were among the wounded.
A Spanish deserter came to our lines
this afternoon for food. He said: "The

forever."

THE ST. LOUIS SCOOPS
ANOTHER PRIZE-SHIP
Was Flying the British Flag and Car-
ried Supplies for Spaniards
in Cuba.
KEY WEST July 12.â The sloop
Wary, flying the British nag, was
brought in here to-da->- as a prize ot
war. She was captured by the St.
Louis about 110 miles from Santiago
de Cuba, while bound from Jamaica
for Santa Cruz, with a cargo of pro
visions. It was thought her English
registry was a subterfuge to enable her
to land supplies in Cuba for the starv
ing Spaniards, but investigation proved
it to be bona fide, and she appears to
have been engaged in a bold attempt
to land her cargo on the southern coast
of Cuba. Her crew consisted of Cap
tain Jeremiah Moss and three men, all
Jamaican negroes. The sloop, which
is a 21-ton vessel, was captured on the
2d inst., while becalmed. She was
brought in by a prize crew of three
men.
A schooner, the Wyckerson, was cap
tured by one of the converted yachts at
the same place two days before the
Wary was taken. She was owned by
two German merchants, who were
aboard and who protested so vigor
ously that the prize was taken ov^r to
Santiago for a formal report to Ad
miral Sampson. She was bound for
Manzanillo from Jamaica.

minute intervals, using her forward
and after guns. These shells just
cleared the summit of the hills and
then went crashing into the city. Gen
eral Shafter sent word that the shells
were well placed and that all were
bursting and doing good execution.
Signal stations had been established
along the shore to Siboney. and from
there the military telegraph completed
the line of communication to General
Shafter's headquarters. This joint
attack from land an<l sea was answered
by volleys of fire from thÂ« enemy's
trenches. When Spanish heads ap
peared above the rifle pits the Ameri
can troops fired at them. From the
improved position of our troops they
were able to send an accurate and
deadly fire into the enemy's trenches,
and the Spaniards, with the exception
of a few desultory volleys, soon aban
doned all efforts to return our fire.
To the surprise of the Americans, the
Spaniards did not use their artillery,
although the batteries apparently are
still in position. These might be
dummy guns. No signs of life were
visible thereabouts. It Is known that
two of the enemy's batteries on the left
are dummies.
As the morning wore away the Im
pression became general that Toral had
succeeded in getting the greater part
of the Spanish troops out of the city.
General Shafter and his subordinate of
flcors could not account for the enemy's
strange silence under our fire. It was
not characteristic of the Spaniards.
One suggestion I heard was that the
enemy might be running short of am
munition, and that General Toral, ex
pecting an assault on the city, was
saving what ammunition he had left to
be used then.

late of the armored cruiser \ izcaya.
He said:
"The entire squadron was ordered to
devote the fire of tneir guns to the
cruiser Brooklyn, because it was be
lieved that she was the only thip In the
American squaJron that coula overtake
up. When we got out of the harbor our
ship was second In line and I saw our
flagship was getting a terrible baptism
of fire. It \va; frightful. The Texas
and Brooklyn were ! -st riddling her,
and in fifteen minutes I saw she was on
fire. The lowa and Oregon were firing
on the Oquendo, and as yet I had not
been badly hit. The Brooklyn was a
half mile closer to us than any other
ship and I decided to try to ram her so
that the Colon an 1 Oquendo could get
away, and I started for her. She was
a good mark, with her big broadside,
and as I started I thought surely I
would get her, but she had .evidently
seen us. Very quickly she turned about
and, making a short circle, came at our
port side so that I thought she would
ram us. I moved in toward shore, so
that I could avoid her, and then I saw
that the Oquendo had gone- ashore also,
her steam pipes evidently having been
severed by a shell.
"The maneuvering of the Brooklyn
was beautiful. We opened a rapid fire
at her with our big guns, but she re
turned it with .errible effect. The Ore
s' >n also hit us several times, but the
Brooklyn's broadside crashed into our
superstructure and simply terrorized
the men. We worked ail our guns at
her and I don't see how she escaped us.
She -imply drove us into Bhore, at one
time fighting us at 1100 yards. One
shell went along the entire gun deck,
killing half tb' men on it and wounding
' nearly all the rest. A shHI from the
Oregon hit the superstructure and it
was then that, wounded and knowing
that we could not get away, I struck
the flag and started for the beach. T
did not Instruct the men to load the
guns and do not know why they were
loaded.
"We were on fire badly and when
those men who were alive started to
swim for shore the Cubans on shore
shot at us until the American ships ar
rlved and stopped them. The Brooklyn
had prevented me from getting away,
for I could have beaten the Oregon
out, as I had a two-mile lead of her.
My orders were to try and sink the
Brooklyn, and I tried to carry them
out. I did not think that her battery
could be so terrible as it was."

Explained.
CORPORATIONS MUST PAY
THEY NOW ARE DEFRAUDING
THE PUBLIC.
It Is the Duty of the Carrier to Affix
War Stamps to Bills of
Lading or Mani
fests.
Special Plspntch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 12.â 1n answer
to references from the Collectors of In
ternal Revenue, all bearing upon the
question as to whether the shipper or
carrier shall pay for and affix the re
quired revenue stamp to bills of lading,
etc., Assistant Attorney General Boyd
has held as follows:
"The law makes it the duty of every
railroad and steamboat company, car
rier, express company, corporation or
person whose i :cupation it is to act as
such, to issue to the shipper, consignor,
or his agent, or person from whom any
poods are accepted for transportation,
a bill of lading, manifest or some other
evidence of the receipt of goods, wares
or moi-chandi.se received for carriage
and transportation and this bill of lad
ing, manifest or memorandum requires
a revenue stamp of the value of one
cent to be affixed to it and canceled.
In case of failure to Issue such bill of
lading the law imposes a penalty of $50
upon the carrier guilty of such .allure.
The penalty for failure to bo affix
stamp is not more than JIOO.
"The purpose of thÂ»- law is clear. It
was to tax the corporation and not the
shipper and those provisions undoubt
edly fix upon the express companies
and other carriers the duty of provid
ing, affixing and canceling the stamp
and their failure to so provide, affix
and cancel them subjects them to the
Penalties provided by law.
"It is suggested that some of these
carriers are refusing to receive goods
for shipment until the shipper pays the
tax. While it is not my province to
advise as to the recourse which the
shipper may have in instances of this
kind, yet I am sure that the laws are
ample to require public carriers and
express companies to receive goods ten
dered for shipping or suffer damages
for such refusal."

GENERAL MANAGER'S PLANS
INCALCULABLE MAGNITUDE OF
THE PROJECT.
Vast Amount of Capital and Labor
to Be Employed Should Amer

Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, July 12.â The Times says
to-day: According to present plans the
Rio Grande Western Railroad is to be
come one of the greatest railway sys
tems in the world. The idea has been
formulated by Colonel D. c. Dodge,
general manager of the road, to extend
its lli.e from Ogden to the Pacific Coast
and south through California with a
possibility of its being extended into
Mexico.
The only proviso which enters into
the arrangements is that the United
States become possessor of the Philip
pines. It is believed that the com
merce that will result from the annexa
tion of thff Philippines reaching this
country by way of the Pacific Coast
will necessitate Increased railroad fa
cilities. This consideration led Colonel
Dodge to plan the extension of the Rio
Grande Western.
"It will not be started this year,"
said he, "but I am positive that the
extension will l.c made within the next
fivp years and possibly work will be
commenced in ISfw. It is a great under
taking and one that will require an al
most inconceivable amount of labor
and capital. At the present time our
plans are so indefinite that I can hardly
say just how things will come out."

COACHMAN IN THE CASI
SENSATIONAL ESCAPADES OF
MRS. HAMMERSMITH.
Wife of the San Francisco Jeweler
Implicated With a Former
Roustabout in an Al
leged Crime.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, July 12.â A woman's
fickleness and duplicity have again
been the cause of the wrecking of a
good home, with all the comforts and
luxuries that money could buy. This
time the actors in the domestic drama
are John A. Hammersmith of
the firm of Hammersmith & Field,
wholesale jewelers at 118 Sutter street,
San Francisco, and his pretty wife.
Besides the usual threatened suit for
divorce, Mrs. Hammersmith may have
to face a graver charge in the courts â
that of arson. The third in the dra
matis personae is Peter Ennis, who un
til about a year ago was a ragged
roustabout in Ran Jose and Santa
Clara, Now he bids fair to become co
respondent in divorce proceedings.
Hammersmith and his wife lived for
years at 2830 Bush street, San
Francisco. There a well-appointed
home was kept up. Mrs. Ham
mersmith's mother and father, Mr.
and Mrs. Quince. live at Santa
Clara, and she generally spent the
spring months at their home. Her hus
band made her a liberal allowance, and
she had a stylish horse and phaeton.
This last luxury necessitated the em
ployment of a hostler and coachman,
and Peter Ennis secured the place. In
their daily drives a mutual attach
ment sprung up and this ripened into
love Mrs. Hammersmith declined to
return to San Francisco, and moved to
this city. A house was rented on Wil
son avenue, near the Alameda. The
place was fitted up elegantly. Ennis
was brought along, and instead of be
ing coachman he arose to a more in
fluential position.
About this time a coolness sprang up
between Hammersmith and his wife,

and although he gave her plenty of
money, he never visited her. Ennis'
streak of good fortune then commenced,
and he displayed diamonds galore and
had '"money to burn." He introduced
Mrs. Hammersmith as his wife, and
among her new acquaintances she
passed as Mrs. I<:nnis. The woman and
her erstwhile coachman were greatly
devoted to each other and were out rid
ing every afternoon and evening.
Ennis longed to be a man of influ
ence and dabble in politics. In order
to gratify his wish Mrs. Hammer
smith started him in the saloon busi
ness at Pleasant and Santa Clara
streets, this city. The venture was a
losing one. and after a few months was
discontinued. Mrs. Hammersmith had
plenty of money and the couple still
enjoyed life to its fullness.
Their home on Wilson avenue with
its elegant Stings was insured for $2000
in the Globe Insurance Company of
Liverpool. On the night of July 4 the
place was nearly destroyed by fire. The
policy had been made in the name of
John A. Hammersmith, and a few days
later ho and Adjuster Mead of the
company visited the place for the pur
pose of settling the losses. Instead of
traces of costly draperies, bric-a-brac
axid furniture, it could he seen that in
the place there had been cmly the com
monest of furniture *nd matting on the
floor. Mead refused to adjust matters
and detectives were employed to dig"
up evidence for a charge of arson. The
case was reported to the District At
torney, and Constable Haley began to
work on it.
It was found that all costly fixtures,
furniture and Brussels carpets were
removed from the house to Mrs. Ham
mersmith's mother's home at Santa
Clara. Tn their place were substituted
the cheapest kind of furniture and
mattings. This moving was done on
July 2 and 3, and the fire occurred on
July 4.
James Murray, who was engaged to
help do the moving, says five gon
loads of goods wire removed fi a the
house on those days. Ennis told him
he was going to the Tdsemite for the
summer, and they did not like to leave
such fine Roods In the house. Murray
asked if there was no insurance, and
Ennis said there was not.
Mrs. Hammersmith was seen at her
mother's home at Santa Clara to-day.
She intimated the insurance company
was ( .nising trouble to get out of pay
ing the loss. She said Ennis was out
in the country working. She stated
that at the proper time e%-<Â»rything
would be cleared, and that tho matter
was now in her attorney's hands.
Her mother's home gave evidence of
being overcrowded with bric-a-brac
and pretty pieces of household furni
ture, and looked as though several
wagon-loads of these goods had been
but recently dumped in the house.
Ennis, who is n Portuguese, is a fine
appearing young fellow of about 25
years. Mrs. Hammersmith is probably
ten -ears his senior, but is pretty,
plump and attractive.

FUSION POPULISTS WIN
THE INITIAL SKIRMISH
STRENGTH OF ThjE
FACTIONS SHOWN
IN A TEST VOTE
Hutchinsor) Elected Temporary
Chairman Over Webster by a
Majority of 62 Votes.
SACRAMENTO. July 12.â 8y a vote of 171 viu i to 109^ the Buckley-
Maguires won the first skirmish in the State Convention of the People's
party this morning by electing E. L. Hutchinson of Los Angeles chairman
of the convention.
No extraordinary demonstration marked the announcement of the con
test. There was no walk-out of defeated middle-of-the-roadsters; no wild
outburst of applause on the part of the fusionists. The majority gave
three cheers when their candidate was conducted to the chair â not by the
defeated candidate, for Mr. Webster declined the honor â but by Van Meter,
and the work of temporarily organizing was proceeded with.
The middle-of-the-roadsters do not accept this morning's vote as signi
ficant of their final defeat. They say that geography, expediency and
other conditions helped to elect Hutchinson, and that the delegates who
voted for him are divided as to the future policy to pursue. While the ma
jority of them are credited with favoring the indorsement of Maguire,
there are others who oppose this plan as strongly as do the middle-of-the
roadsters and will insist that the nomination for Governor be left open, to
be filled later by the State Central Committee.
This faction holds that the indorsement of Maguire now would make
him practically the only candidate before the Democratic convention, and
while they favor fusion, they believe that exigencies may arise making it
advisable for the combined parties to nominate some one other than Ma
guire.
The middle-of-the-roadsters figure it out that the Buckley-Maguires will
not yield an inch from their stand, and that the liberal fusionists, rather than
surrender completely to Maguire, will come out for a straight Populist
ticket.
Such a ticket is certain now to be named.
The anti-fusionists, in response to a call issued early this morning, met
at the Capitol an hour before the time set for the convention to convene,
and held a long conference as to the best plan to pursue. Some of the
delegates, who had been instructed by their county conventions to bolt in
case fusion prevailed, were in favor of walking out of the convention upon
the election of Hutchinson. Others counseled patience and urged that it
would be unwise to surrender so completely to their opponents. They ad
vised all opponents of fusion to fight for their party to the end, and. if final
ly defeated in this convention, to form another and nominate a complete
ticket from top to bottom, which would appeal to every true Populist.
This plan met with great Javor and after discussing it at considerable
length it was decided to adopt it. Naturally no time or place was fixed for
the bolting convention â such action would be an admission oi defeat in ad
vance, but it is quite probable that in the event of the Maguirc-Buckley
ring securing an indorsement now their opponents will meet immediately
after adjournment and put up a straight-out Populist ticket and make "no
surrender" their slogan.
VICTORY FOR
THE FUSIONISTS
How the First Battle Was
Fought and Won in the
Convention.
SACRAMENTO, July 12.â The open- I
Ing gun of the campaign of 1898 was
fired to-day in the Assembly chambers
of the State Capitol when the Populist
Convention mci to face the grave and
momentous question of fusion with the i
Democratic party. The fusionlsts won
the first battle and the anti-fusionists '
are feeling rather disheartened. They
intend, however, to see the fight out,
although fully realizing that nothing
but party disruption Is dose at hand.
The middle-of-the-road Populists do
not relish playing the part of Jonah
with the Democratic party in the role
of the whale. Biblical history says
that Jonah, after having been swal
lowed by the whale, escaped alive. The
middle-of-the-roadsters intend follow
ing the goerd example he set. They do
not propose being swallowed forever
by the Democracy. While they may
be at present forced to submit to the
lash of the Buckley- Maguire wing of
the Demuvratic party, they are look-
Ing forward to the day when the secret
ballot deposited in the voting booth
will give them 'release from the
shackles of bossism.
The anti-fusionists are saying some
bitter things. They charge that the
Populist party has been by some of the
leaders put up at auction and sold for
a. few promised political plums. The
anti-fusionists declare that the political j
plums to be distributed by Magulre |
will never reach market, if the crop de- |
pends on their votes. Fusion, they say, |
means a loss of party identity and they j
Will not submit. If there is not an open
bolt made before the convention is I
over the political prophets are badly at ;
sea.
E. M. Wardell, chairman of the Stat9
Central Committee, in calling the con
vention together, said that the Popu
list party was meeting under circum
stances unparalleled in the political
history of California.
"We have," said he, "two powers to
fight to-day. While our soldiers and !
Bailors are fighting in distant lands for j
our flag and the cause of justice we i
at home are battling with the money
powers. The Spanish fight will be eas
ily won, but we behind are destined to j
have a long and great fight with the ,
corporations. I trust that the men who
came here to represent the great re
form party will do their duty well. I
trust that there will not be any hot
headed debates and that the delegates
will act calmly and reason together as
men and brothers. There should not be
any shirking or attempt at escaping
from the hard duty before us. I be
lieve and I know that the spirit of fair
ness will prevail. The convention is
not a large one, It Is true, but it must

be Remembered that the railroad is not
Issuing passeÃ for our delegates."
Nominations for temporary chairman
were declared in order after the road
ing of the call for the convention is
sued by the State Central Committee.
Burdette Cornell of Alameda first
caught the eye of the chairnuLn. He
said that he arose to place in nomina
tion for temporary chairman a young
man who was known throughout the
State as a strong, stanch and ardent
supporter of the principles of the Peo
ple'a party.
"lie has long held aloft the banner of
our party," said Cornell in conclusion,
"and he is in every way fitted to pre
side over the destinies of this impor
tant convention. He knows no faction,
nor does he know any section. It is
with pleasure, gentlemen, that I pre
sent to you for your consideration and
I votes, the name of E. L. Hutchinson
of Lms Angeles."
The nomination of Hutchinson, who
represents the fusion forces, was sec
onded by George W. Monteith of Marin,
who said that with Hutchinson In the
chair there need be no fear of the rail
' road octopus getting its tentacles
1 around the convention.
J. M. C. Murphy of Shasta then took
tho floor to place J. V. Webster of San
Luis Obispo County in nomination. He
s.i id W.bster had carried the party
banner in many other fights, and the
convention should show its apprecia
tion of his efforts by placing the gavel
of the chairman in his hands.
T. E. Clark of Tulare County, who
; is one of the leaders of the anti-fu
sion forces, seconded the nomination of
Webster in a ringing speech. Although
not directly saying so, he strongly in
! timated that the chairmanship fight
, would pretty clearly indicate the pulse
of the convention on the question of
; fusion.
"We have n Populist party," said he,
"and let us stand by it. Let us moke
a fight on the principles we advocate
and refuse to listen to the proposition
of fusion. The idea of fusion has been
suggested by our enemies and .1 am
afraid if we are not careful, calm and
deliberate we will be destroyed by those
who now profess to be our friends."
The nomination of Hutchinson was
seconded by Milton Carlson of Los Ang
geles, who paid a glowing tribute to
him.
"We have reached a period," said
Thomas V. Cator, "when we require a
chairman of ripe judgment, and in J.
V. Webster of San Louis Obispo we
have a man who will wisely look after
our interests. The matter of fusion is
now uppermost in the minds of all our
delegates. Let us take a firm stand
against any such programme. We fused
with the Democrats once before and
THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 13, 1893.
NOT A FINAL TEST
SAYS THOMAS V. CATOR
SACRAMENTO, July 12.â T0 the Editor of The Callâ Sir: I do not
by any means regard the vote for temporary chairman this morning
as a final test of the two wings of the Populist party. Many delegates
supported Mr. Hutchinson for reasons other than his position in re
gard to fusion, and at the proper tl me they will be found supporting
the nomination of a straight People's party ticket. On the action of
this convention the very existence of the People's party depends, and
if the delegates allow themselves and their constituents to become ab
solved from our obligations by folly, they will have less wisdom than I
suppose. It is clear to many friends of fusion that a Democrat would
be injured rather than helped by being forced on this convention at this
time. THOMAS V. CATOR.
found when it was too late that the
Democratic party was false to its
promises and pledges. Let us be
warned by the experience of two years
ago and avoid fusion. It is time that
the people's party should determine
what it is going to do in 1900. The
People's party is a party of reform.
The Democratic party only makes a
pretense of reform. No reform that
is genuine will ever come through the
Democratic party. Away with the
Democratic machine and Democratic
methods. If the People's party must
go down let it go down in honor and
with right on its Bide."
George D. Gillospie of San Francisco,
who is head Populist spokesman for the
Jdaguire wing of the Democracy, made
reply to Cator. He said that he was
surprised at the wonderful change of
heart shown by Cator.
"Two years . go, when he wanted to
go to the United States Senate," said
Oillespie, "he advocated fusion. Po
litical conditions have nut changed
since then, but the man has. Are we
prepared to jump from one base to
another becaui -â¢ certain people have
changed? I emphatically answer,
'No. 1 "
The Maguire i'opullsts applauded
these remarks. Then Patterson of
Kings County indulged in a little, ora
tory on behalf of Webster.
"The people of the State are sad and
moaning," said he, "and fervently
praying for relief. They want a gen
eral to lead them in the next battle,
and that we are going to give them one
will be shown if we elect J. V. Web
ster our chairman. They will then
know that we are going to upset the
hellish plotting of the corporations.
They will know that they will be led
into the light by a leader tried and true,
a leader who is a Populist instead of a
half-breed."
The flood gates of oratory were closed
after J. D. Moynahan mad? an appeal
to the delegates to support Hutchinson
for chairman.
The roll was called and Hutchinson
was elected on , the first ballot by a
vote of 171% to 109%. The announce
ment of the r -suit was applauded by
the fusionists, who believe that a test
of the strength of the fusion and anti
fusion forces was made in the contest.
The vote of the counties represented
at the convention was as follows:

F. J. Gregory of Alameda was elected
secretary by acclamation.
"Will Mr. Webster act as a committee
of one to escort Mr. Hutchinson to the
chair?" asked Chairman Ward.ell.
"I have had enough honors showered
on me," replied Webster.
There was a pause for a few seconds
and everyone expected that trouble was
ahead. A delegate from Orange was
quickly appointed to escort Hutchinson
to the presiding officer's chair. Gil
lespie of San Francisco proposed three
cheers for Hutchinson and they were
given by the Maguireltes.
"I esteem it a hijrh honor to have
been chosen your temporary chairman,"
said Hutchinson. addressing the dele
gates, "and I wish to announce at this
time that I am not here in the interest
of any set or clique of men. I am here
â and we are all here â for the purpose
of redeeming the State of California.
We are not the tools of any clique or
any man. We are here to do business
In a businesslike way instead of clutch
ing at one another's throat. We are
not here to hiss or quarrel. Every mat
ter brought up for consideration should
be calmly studied. We hear talk of
fusion on all sides. For myself, I can
say that I am not one of those who be
lieve in fusion at any cost. We have
concessions to make and to ask. If we
go about our work in a methodical,
businesslike way I am sure that when
our deliberations are ended we will
have given California a new political
map."
Hutchinson then announced the fol
lowing list of officers and assistants:
I Sergeant-at-arms. W. E. Bowles; as
i sistant sergeant-at-arms, William
I Daly: clerks, A. Dittmar and Dr. W.
:H. Henderson; pages, Edgar Camp,
Norman Moynahan and Julius Jacobs.
J. W. Hines moved that a committee
of nine on credentials be appointed.
The motion prevailed and Chairman
Hutchinson named the following com
mittee: J. W. Hines, Santa Clara: J.
D. Hammond, San Diego; F. Houghton,
Tehama; H. Huppert, San Francisco;
L,. A. Miller, San Luis Obispo; George
W. Monteith, Marin; G. W. Cart
wright, Fresno; Hiram Hamilton,
Orange, and M. E. Dittmar, Shasta.
As the convention was about to take
a recess to allow the credential com
mittee time to perform its work, J. V.
Webster claimed the floor.
"I think I owe an apology to this
convention and to .our former chair
man. When he asked me to act as a
committee of one to escort Mr. Hutch
inson to the chair, I did not catch
what he said. I thought he was nam
ing me on another committeeand I said
that I had sufficient honors already be
stowed on me. Had I understood his \
request, I would have willingly served." |
Warden replied that he at first felt
Inclined to believe that he had been
treated discourteously.
"I feel relieved," said he, "when
Brother Webster explains that he did
not understand what I said."
"There is no need for any apologies,"
interrupted Chairman Hutchinson, "for
it was a mere mistake."
The convention then adjourned to
meet at 3 o'clock to receive the report
of the committee on credentials.
It was close to 5 o'clock when the
committee returned to the assembly
chamber. There was a contest over
the seats of one of the Sacramento del
egates and the committee had a hard
time settling it to tne satisfaction of
the interested parties.
Delegate Cator introduced a resolu
tion to the effect that proxies be not
voted. He favored a plan of having
the votes of all absentees divided in a
ratio of the majority from the county
affected, reserving the right to cast
the largest part of the absentee vote.
A lengthy debate followed. Some of
the delegates who held proxies insisted
on being granted the right to vote
them, without having to submit to the
dictates of the majority of their county
delegation present. It was finally de
cided to refer the resolution to the
committee on platform and resolutions.
The convention then divided into
Congressional districts to select from
their number delegates to serve on the
committee on permanent organization
and order of business and the commit
tee on platform and resolutions. The
following selections were made:
On organization and order of business â
First district, William Ayers, Eureka;
Second, J. E. Camp, Sacramento; Third,
John Aubrey Jones, Alameda; Fourth,
Georpfo D. Glllesple, Ran Francisco; Fifth,

J. K. Burnett, San Luis' CBispo; Seventh,
J. F. Peck. Merced.
On platform and resolutions First dis
trict, J. W. Warberis and M. E. Dittmar

A. R. Sprague was then elected at
large to serve on the platform commit
tee.
A resolution empowering the State
committee to pass on matters of party
interest when signed by fifteen mem
bers was referred to the committee on
resolutions. An adjournment until 9
o'clock to-morrow morning was then
taken. ______________

STRAIGHT-OUTS
WILL HOLD THEIR
OWN CONVENTION
Decide to Nominate a Full Ticket
if Maguire Carries Off the
Plum.
SACRAMENTO, July 12.â James G.
Maguire stands but a slim chance of
capturing the Populist State Conven
tion. His opponents say he stands not
the slightest chance, while his friends
make no attempt to conceal their
anxiety and to-night are t-lking about
leaving the head of the ticket open.
Since the vote for temporary chair
man was taken in the convention this
morning the situation has taken many
turns. Then the fusionists claimed
everything in sight and talked boast
ingly of having put the middle-of-the
roadsters to rest permanently. They
half expected to see their opponents
walk out of the convention hall and
would not have been sorry had they
clone so, but after the long recess,
when it was found that the anti
fusionists were in their seats and not
showing the least disposition to admit
defeat, the Buckley-Maguires became
apprehensive.
Cator's resolution to have the com
mittees named by the Congressional
districts deprived the chairman of that
much-desired task, but the fusionints
rallied and managed to control the
rules, permanent organization and plat
form committees in the end.
Even this did not disconcert the anti
fusionists. They had attempted to
caucus during recess, but were unable
to muster a respectable number of their
following, so they adjourned until to
night. The mooting was held at the
State House, according to agreement,
and lasted nearly three hours. But it
settled the fate of James G. Maguire,
so far as the Populists are concerned.
"No fusion and no compromise," was
the watchword, and this will be fol
lowed out to the last ditch.
A programme was definitely agreed
upon, which Is nothing less than to hold
a convention of the middle-of-the-road
sters after the present body adjourns,
if necessary, and put up a complete
ticket from top to bottom.
The middle-of-the-ro.idsters will not
bolt now: they are determined to force
the fusionists to terms, and believe
they will be able to do so. The leaders
have held the 109 votes cast for Web
ster as firm as a rock, and claimed
they have gained some accessions from
their opponents. This may or may not
be true, but it is a fact that some of
the Southern delegates are beginning
to ask what the Democrats propose to
give them in the way of patronage in
addition to the minor places on the
ticket that will be doled out to them.
These questioners are far sighted and
reason something like this: With the
war with Spain in progress, the con
servative people will naturaly support
the administration in every way pos
sible even to State and local offices. In I
consequence the State is almost cer- j
tain to go Republican, with the pos- !
sible exception of Governor, and the j
Fusionists can save him only by j
slaughtering the others on the ticket, j
This would leave the Democrats with j
the Governor and his patronage, and ;
the Populists the barren honor of hay- '
ing put up some candidates for other
offices who were defeated. Naturally, !
looking at the situation in this light, ,
these far-seeing ones are turning their '
attention to some of the appointive
places, and they want to know what.
they may expect in that line. And the
more they yonder, the more inclined !
they are to let Maguire severely alone. !
Every hour finds the majority of this |
morning more divided. While some are
Still holding out for Maguire, others are '
becoming more firmly convinced that j
the better plan would be not to mention
Maguire in convention at all, but leave
the head of the ticket vacant, to be
filled later by the State Committee
after conferring with the other parties
and getting the best possible terms.
Still another faction of the fusionists ;
is in favor of a scheme to put up a
dummy ticket to be knocked down
later and Demrrcrats substituted. This j

of such a plan, and at their caucus to

One thing that has cut deeply into
the fusion forces to-night has been the
circulation of the Congressional Record
containing the speech of Maguire, in
â¢which he moved to strike the Income
tax out of the Wilson tariff bill on Jan
uary 31, 1R94. On â¢"age 2nr>6 Judge Ma
guire is quoted as follows:
The amendment which I have offered
strikes out all of the sections of the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Tennessee iMr. "McMilleni. which
provide for the levy and collection of a
tax on incomes, and proposes to raise an
equivalent amount of revenue by a direct
tax on the value of land In the I'nited
States apportioned to the States and Ter
ritories in proportion to their population.
Those who are sincere cannot under
stand this attitude of Maguire against
one of the fundamental principles of
Populism.

MAGUIRE'S NOMINATION
The Populist Mix-Up at Sacramento as Viewed

SACRAMENTO, July 12.â T0 th* Editor of The Callâ Sir: You cannot
determine what is the sentiment of a People's party convention by
methods which enable you to understand the situation in any other po
litical body. A Populist resents leadership and Is prone to vote his in
dividual preferences In all matters of procedure. Votes In Populist conven- *
tionÃ, unless taken upon a proposition directly and plainly Involving the
main Issue, are of little value as Indicators. Yet Mr. Hutchinson was so
thoroughly committed to fusion, had made such a vigorous fight In the
1 ibbies, and was so unmistakably th-> representative of Southern California,
where fusion sentiment prevails universally, that the vote for and against
him was certainly a test Further. Mr. Webster's services to his party In the
past enabled him to command the support of fifty or sixty d legates who
will vote for fusion.
The danger is that the sinister Influence of the energetic Southern Pa
cific lobby, which is here in strength, and, strange to say, in evidence,
will solidify Mr. Cator's following and that Mr. Cator's parliamentary .'x
perlence wiu enable him to euchre the fuslonists out of their victory, un
less they are well led on the floor. That is the game now beha
lf the fu&ionists un lerstanu their position they will view with suspicion
anything proposed by him.
A hand-to-hand canvass enables me to say that about 70 per cent of the
C or.-- :i. Every man who favors fusion is far Maguire. I
do not believe any other Democrat can pet one-quarter of the Populist votes
â u'liich Mapuir- can < â  mmand.
Wie'pla ... tedly bs th" Oregon fusion platform, with a
plank added Indorsing the war with Spain, together with a strong de-
Ltion against i n general and against the Southern Pacific,
with Its Interference in the San Pedro matter and the funding bill in par
ar, V- r the latter plank the railroad has its lobby to thank.
ithern California Democrats will favor fusion with Populists on that
rm, I l><
Whether Maguire -w-.il tvÂ» nominated by the convention or whether the
will be left vacant and Maguire recommended to the Democratic con
vent; in, re-mains und termlned. If it wen' certain that the Democrats
would nominate him h<* would receive the nomination here in ten minutes.
Ir; that event the threatened bolt of Cator, the Tulare delegation and a
eda mieht ensue. Magnlrr's nomination by the Democrats
Is ;- â¢ certain that I believe he will be nominated here.
Th^ Populists hav<* no senatorial candidate since the downfall of Cator.
TVh'.re's successor seems to be conceded to th-- Southern California Dem
ocracy. Abbott Kinney is entirely satisfactory. His availability and ability
both are admitted. He and Mafruire are among the few Democrats who
can g<n united Populist and Silver Republican support without offending
something of th^ <â¢< >nservative element in their own party. In fact if the
legislature ha.s a fuslonist majority and the senatorship goes to the south
no one but Kinney has any chance now.
Speaking to some extent for the Democracy of the south, I believe
that if t! 3 convention adrpts a reasonable platform and indorses or nomi
r.af.-s Masruir^ that the Lieutenant-Governor, the controller, the Super
intendent of Public Instruction and two Congressmen will be allowed them,
with othf-r possibilities.
In view of the bitter Southern Pacific fight made here to prevent Ma
guire's nomination or indorsement this convention owes it to itself and its
party to declare for him. KARL ROGERS.
lasting over an hour, during which
time the best bait to be used for cap
turing the Populists was discussed, the
political warriors walked to the State
}l r 'use to meet the conspirators who are
seeking to wreck the Populist party. A
â  â  rence is now b>-ing held, and It is
probable but little honest work will be
done when the convention meets this
morning in the assembly chamber of
1hÂ» State Capitol. The plan of thÂ» Dem-
ocrats is to prevent any nominations
being made at this time. If it is found
that the middle-of-the-road men are
strong: enough to block the game, some
one will be named for Governor who
will at the proper time get an attack
of "cold feet" and withdraw from the
ticket.
That the Democrats are playing a
deep game is best understood by the
report from the committee on perma
nent organization and order of busi
ness that will be presented this morn
ing. The members of the committee
were pledged to secrecy, but where
more than one knows a secret, it no
longer remains a secret. The commit-
tep will recommend that the temporary
officers of the convention be made the
permanent officers, that a committee ol
Beven, one from each Congressional dis
trict be appointed "for the purpose of
conferring with other political reform
forces with a view i f forming a union
to promote Populist principles."
Here is where the joker will come
and show Democratic strategy. me
committee will recommend that there
be no other business until the confer
ence committee reports. After It re
ports nominations for Governor will be
In order. In conclusion the report
reads:
"The foregoing Is a partial report,
and we ask for further time, to com
plete the purposes for which we were
appointed."
The middle-of-the-road men Bay they
will not consent to any such pro
gramme.
"The convention will be forced to
make nominations at once," remarked
one of them this morning, "and on the
fuslonists* refusal to do so, there are
others who have a deen Interest in the
success of the party who will see that
a straight ticket is nominated before
they leave Sacramento."
John W. Mitchell of L,os Angeles has
been turned down by the Populists â
turned down so hard that he does not
yet realize "where he is at." Mitchell
came up to-night as one of the Demo
cratic conference committee intending
to take part in the proceedings.
When it was ascertained that Mit
chell was her^. Earl Rogers, who has
had his hammer out for Mitchell ever
since he was upset by the latter six
months ago In Los Angeles on a posi
tion promised him, called several of the
fusion Populists together, including E.
M. Wardell, and reminded them of an
incident during the recent conference
of Populists. Democrats and silver Re
publicans in San Francisco, when Mit
chell refused to recognize Wardell
when he attempted to address the con
ference.
Wardell and the others remembered,
and then and there declared they would
have nothing to do with Mitchell.
They sent word to Alford. Maddux and
the rest of the Democrats that they
would be happy to meet them, but that
Mitchell must be left behind. The
Democrats stormed and fumed, but to
no avail. The Populists were obdurate,
and eventually the Democrats sur
rendered as gracefully as they could.
When the conference was held Mitchell
was left out, and he will remain out
to-morrow and hereafter when Demo
crats and Populists meet.
This is the second railway attorney
to fall to-day. George W. Baker be
came disgusted at the attempt to bring
about fusion and sent in his resigna
tion as chairman of the Sliver Republi
can committee. To-night he packed
his grip and stole quietly down to the
depot, boarding the first train for San
Francisco.

TO FUSE OR
NOT TO FUSE
THE QUESTION
A Fusion Committee Appointed
by the State Democratic
Organization-
Governor Budd's Plans Adopted After Some
Kickingâ Chairman Alford Is Confident
of Success.
The nervousness that hns pervndod the
Democratic ranks since the bewhiskered
party went to Sacramento with banners
flying and declarations of Independence
calculated to cause political cold extremi
ties among the most courageous of the
unterrined was to a gnat decree quieted
yesterday. This BUdden gratifying change
In the condition of the leaders of the party
was the result of a meeting <>f the Demo
cratic State Central Committee held at
the California Hotel.
The conference was brought about by
the defiant attitude of the Populists at
the Capitol, who apparently proposed to
open the battle on ttvir own account
without any reference t.> the feelings of
their Democratic friends. The Central
Committee had guarded against a repulse
i by sending seme of it.- ir.'i^t trusted lieu
! tenants to the seem of conflli t, the leader
being no less a personage than ex-Judge
\V. P. I*awlur. !5y keeping the wires hot
with questions and answers an agreement
whs finally arrived ;it by which tne Popu
lists secured concessions sufficiently mo
mentous to induce them to tie up their
convention, which was In full working or
der, and agree to "do nothing" till the
committee representing the Democrats
apj>< ared for a conference. This an
nouncement came after the Democratic
promises had been digested in Sacramento
and the Populist convention had voted for
fusion by a targe majority.
The nir>: :m;.: yesterday was attended by
Borne of th>- most prominent whe>-l horses
i of the party, among whom were: Gover
nor Budd. W. 11. Alford. Frank Could,
"Bob" Pitzgecald, Eugene Deuprey, Hen
Maddox, the Whisperer and many others.
In the haste to get down to executive
business and do something to cheek the
dangerous cane;- Âf the convention at the
capital city, the committee dispensed
with the reading of the minutes of the
previous meeting and proceeded with the
labor or' adjusting the troubles In hand.
The prepared programme wa-s carried out
' to the i redit of all concerned, being helped
, along by more or less entertaining
oratory.
Governor Budd in the capacity of guide
. and philosopher of the conferring leaders
i sidetracked the minutes and started the
ball rolling by moving that the two old
ling committees, that on welfare and
organization and the conference commit
;â  .-. be merged into a Joint committee
and instructed to go to Sacramento to
confer with the Populists as to fusion;
also that suid Joint committee be given
: full power to make final arrangements
with their long-whiskered friends as to
the division of nominations and the nar
row path in which they must walk if
they desire to secure the support of the
Demo< racy inul avoid being sponged off
the political slate as a factor in the com
ampaign.
â  iron-bound proviso in the resolu
tion was that the Populists must keep
hands off In the matter of nominations
that are to be made by the Democrats
and leave such places vacant for the fu
nction of the Democratic convention.
The inference was plain that In any case
where this resolution was disregarded
the Democrat whn was so misguided as
to accept a nomination from the Populists
v, . iid be coolly turned Jown.
The Governor stated that he had been
â¢ notified from Sacramento that the Popu
1 lists would fuse if they were given the
! Lieutenant Governor, Controller and Bu
, perintendent of Public. Instruction. He
' insisted that no one should have a hand
i In the nomination of the State Democrat
ic ticket but the convention of that great
party.
Senator Ostrom, remembering the un
lamented Dolly Varden party, was a 1.1
i tie shy of fusion, except with those who
would "come into the Democratic fold."
He was evidently not a member of the
Inner court, for he wanted the committee
instructed more fully. Clitus Bar:>nir dis
played considerable trepidation as to the
result of the proposed action. He feared
that the Populists would nominate a
Democrat for Governor and place his
party In the position of Indorsing the
nominee, and thus make it possible lor
"the Populist tail to wag the Democratic
dog." He recoenized a number of his old
sand- lot friends in the sonveation ut
Facram< nto, and for this rsason hopt-d
that the Populist* could be induced to
postpone their operations and meet si
mii.ianeousiy with the Demonrats. This
he desired In order to "sit on the George
â \V Bakers and the T. V. Cators."
Chairman Alford declared that tne joint
mittee on platform and resolutions met
to-night. Chairman Milton Carlson pre
siding. The following committees were
then appointed:
Direct Legislation â Majors, Ditmar,
Carlson.
Financeâ Cornell. Mouser. Sprague.
Railroads and Nicaragua Canalâ Kinne,
Davla, McKune.
Warâ Mason, Cleveland, CummlnÃS.
Taxation and Laborâ Barkee, Griswold,
Warboy.
Courts and Injunctionâ
The reports of the sub-committees
were then received and the following
was submitted for the approval of the
general committee:
The People's party of the State of Cal-
fornia, realizing the urgent necessity of
roforni In the State and nation, reaffirm
our convictions in the principles fnun
ciated in our national platform at St.
Louis. We declare Government hy rep
resentation a failure unless the people
retain the right tb Veto bad legislation
and to initiate and vote upon proposed
laws directly; and we therefore demand
an amendment to the constitution pro
viding:
Firstâ That any lnw or ordinance adopt
ed by any legislative body of this State
sh.nll be subjected to a popular vote
when demanded by a proper authenticat
ed petition signed by a reasonable per
cent of the electors of the State, city
or municipality, and If such a vote show
committee wouU. not be all powerful, as I
whatever action they might take would :
be subject to the action of the Demo- |
cratic >tate convention. Mr. Gould of- )
fered an amendment, which was accepted, i
that any agreement or indorsements by |
the Populists should in no way affect the j
full right of the Democratic party in the
formation of any platform or declaration
of principles it may see lit to adopt. Mr.
Gould, the gentleman who is "now of San
Francisco," casually remarked that such
a proviso should be made, and that if a !
platform was drawn that did not suit
him he should bolt. Furthermore, he :
cUdu't like fus.on, but favored a pcheme '
of mutual indorsement, which would not j
get his good, old Democratic doctrine :
hopelessly tangled up with the diverse 1
and often pyrotechnic principles of the j
Populists.
Mr. Otis of Sonoma had similar qualms |
of political conscience, and "Bob" j
Mizgerald shied at the scheme In the |
fear that it would drive tne floating j
Populist vote Into the Republican ranks, i
The resolution was finally adopted by a j
large majority.
This delicate question being settled, the
Governor sprung another surprise that
gave the minority an opportunity to do i
some earnest kicking and declare the:r '
undying allegiance to the lofty principles |
of the party; also their belief that Dem
ocracy would be invincible if Its leaders
would pursue "a bold and courageous
course" without reference to the actions |
of their disesteemed friends, the Republi
cans.
Governor Budd's proposition was that
the same Joint committee should be given
tne power to fix the date for holding the
coming State convention, In order that
they might wait till the Republicans had
called their convention and then convene
the Democratic hosts two days ahead of
that date.
Among the protestors against this trans
fer of autocratic power were Senator Os
trom and Max Popper, who thought such
a course would be an exhibition of cow.
ardice. These gentlemen were carefully
squelched by the Governor, who gayÂ«
them a variation of the proposition thai
discretion is the better p:irt of valor, by
saying if Ilerr Popper had been Sampson
in front of Santiago he would have steam
er right Into the harbor and been "blown
h west and crooked" merely to show
that he was not afraid of any combina
tion.
Mr. Ostrom's amendment that the con
vention be held on the second Tuesday in
August was buried out of sight by a vote
of 70 to 12, notwithstanding the fact thai
Mr. Popper looked significantly at Mr.
Budd and said he was not looking for
anything personally and that Mr. Budd
looked at Mr. Popper impatiently and said
nothing.
The minority having been pocketed a
telegram from Sacramento was read an
nouncing that the Populist convention
had agreed to fuse by a largo majority,
which was greeted by hearty cheers.
The State committee then adjourned.
The joint committee which hns been
given such extraordinary power is com
posed as follows: Welfareâ R. M. Fitz
gerald, \Y. a. Alford, J. H. I'.udd, F. H.
Gould, (1. McNab. B. M. Maddox, E. N.
Deuprey, C. M. Cassin, J. J. Irwin: con
ferenceâJ. W. MitcJtcllj A. Caminettl,
Max Popper, Coloiui W. P. Sullivan Jr.
and J. A. Hix. These gentlemen, who
have the colossal Job of corralling the
Populists, left for Sacramento at 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Chairman Alfoni of the State committee
was in a very cheerful frame of mind
after the successful disposition of the
programme and Immediately sent for a
decorator and ordered a lavish spread
of bunting and emblems placed around
the Democratic headquarters.
"The result of the meeting this after
noon was exceedingly satisfactory," said
hf "The resolutions adopted are in the
proper line for fusion, notwithstanding
the objections made to them, and we feel
quite confident that In the coming con
ference we will succeed in making ar
rangements with the Populists in full ac
cord with the instructions given the joint
comniittee. I have a telegram from Judge
\V P I-awlor saying that the Populist
convention has agreed to fusion by a big
majority, chairman Dorr of the Populist
fusion committee just telephoned me that
the convention would take no further ac
tion till our committee had reached Sac
ramento find mutual propositions had
been considered. I regard this action as
very encouraging and feel sure that a
good understanding will be reached.

It shall be invalid.
Secondâ That upnn petition of 10 per

to the electors therein any question the
submission of which has been demanded

for their approval a law. constitutional ,
amendment or ordinance containing such
provisions as may be demanded by such
petitioners. This method will enable the
people to elect their laws as (veil as I

plete proportional representation.
Thirdâ When legislation has been adopt- \
ed as herein provided by the people no
legislative body shall have the right to
nullify such act without the consent of
the people, given at the polls.
Fourthâ That when the qualified elect
ors of State or county or of cities or
municipalities thereof, shall have cast a
majority vote upon any question so sub
mitted to them, such majority vote shall
settle and determine whether the same
is adopted, rejected or repealed.
At this stage of the proceeding's ex-
Renator Wilson of Tehama County ap
peared with a bundle of resolutions
under his arm, followed by Mr. Mon
teith, who had several suggestions to
offer. The committee, fearing no doubt
an avalanche of similar contributions,
hastily resolved itself into an executive
session and everybody was bundled out.
The chairman announced that the
press representatives would be sup
plied with a draft of the platform when
adopted, but observed that they would
be denied admission to the circus which
will precede the final vote on the Popu
listic platform.

banner to the breeze. He became
in lSf<l a Deputy District Attorney
under \V. D. Tupper. and his prin
cipal not desiring a re-election, he
was chosen as the Democratic
nominee for the place at the con
vention in IS<Â»2. Mr. Van Meter
evidently had nis head enlarged by
thls honor, for not being satisfied
to attend to his own race for the
position he took upon himself the
organization of the County Com
mittee of the Democratic party
and succeeded In defeating the
Hon. John McMullln, president of
the Fresno National Hank, for
chairman of that committee and
electing one Collyer. who was a
deputy in a county official's office.
This was done before the Republi
can convention met.
Mr. Van Meter was duly praised
for defeating the boss' programme.
The Republican convention refused
to nominate a candidate for Dis
trict Attorney. Judge Stanton
Carter, to whom the nomination
was offered, refusing absolutely to
accept It. Later the Republican
County Committee indorsed Fir
man Church, the Peonies nominee,
and Mr. Van Meter, who took upon
himself the naming of the principal
officer Of the County Committee,
was disgracefully defeated.
Hut this did not satisfy his greed
for oftice. The Legislature of 1893
created the county of Madera, and
in May, ISW, Mr. Van Meter
promptly announced his candidacy
in that county for Superior Judge.
He was most inglorlously defeated
by the Hon. William Conley, and
although he got the derisive name
of being a candidate for "Circuit"
Judge he was not cured of his lust
of office, and in IPM secured the
Populist nomination for Judge of
the Superior Court of Fresno
County. He was badly beaten, al
though one Populist nominee,
Judge Rirley, was elected.
Mr. Van Meter is the only man
now recalled who ran twice in the
same year for different offices and
was beaten for both, except J. M.
Cavis. who was nominated for
Lieutenant-Governor on the same
ticket with Phelps in 1575. and de
feated at the election which took
place in September. He also ran
for County .Jurige of San Joaquin
County in October, 1575, and was
likewise defeated.
Mr. Van Meter may have some
solace in the dim distance. He was
Deputy District Attorney of Fresno
County under a Democrat, Mr.
Tupper, and it is possible that he
hopes to enjoy the same emolu
ments from the now Democratic
nominee should he be elected.

HARBOR COMMISSIONERS SCORE ONE
TO be able to commend the Board of Harbor
Commissioners is a pleasure. Opportunities
have been so rare, and the necessity for doing
exactly the contrary so frequent, that the chance is
appreciated.
The Southern Pacific, with that swinish proclivity
which only recognizes the existence of the public
when there is a new way developed for imposing on
it, calmly undertook to keep people out of the depot,
or out of such part of the structure, as the corpora
tion, in its characteristically arrogant style, desired
for its own convenience not to have them enter.
Without consulting anything but their own selfish in
terests the officials of the company caused iron bar
riers to be erected at certain doors. Of course they
had no right to do this, and of course they did not
care whether they had or not. With equal propriety
might they construct a barb-wire fence across the
foot of Market street. They would do this without
hesitation if they had a reason for wishing to divert
traffic to another thoroughfare.
For once the company failed to have its way. Its
barriers attracted attention, its cheek aroused indig
â¢ nation and the Harbor Commissioners had the im
pediments removed. It is worthy of note that this
was done before the Southern Pacific had been asked
for permission. In days gone by nothing so radical
could have occurred The company would have been
humbly petitioned to undo its work, would have
haughtily refused and the incident been regarded as
clofed.
Perhaps this little episode marks the beginning of
a new era. A fond hope arises that the Southern
Pacific hog is to have n ring in its nose, so that its
snouting in the public trough will be done with less
gusto. The Commissioners are to be congratulated
in the course they have taken. Without doubt the
company will remain right at the trough, but It may
not have all four feet in?ide all the time.
THE LACK OF SHIPS.
DISPATCHES from Washington, published
yesterday, in giving an account of arrange
ments made for a proposed descent upon Porto
Rico stated that there will be a delay occasioned by a
lack of transports. The dispatches say: "As yet
the Government has had poor success in chartering
or buying vessels on the Atlantic coast. If, how
ever, it is found impossible to obtain vessels from the
various steamship companies, it is the plan of the
Government to use some of the naval vessels for the
purpose of transporting the army."
We have thus another illustration added to the
many already given during the war of the heavy
handicap under which we are struggling in our ef
forts to get at the Spanish foe. We have battle-ships
enough to destroy their fleets, but, having done so,
we lack the transports required to carry the army to
points where they can reap the benefits of the naval
victories. Even at Santiago our troops have been
hampered by a want of supplies and of siege guns,
and as a consequence the capture of that city has
been the work of weeks instead of days.
All the proceedings of the war have shown that
commercial supremacy is an important factor in naval
supremacy. We need an extensive merchant marine
as well as a fleet of righting vessels. The war drags
along because of a lack of transports. In an attempt
to supply the deficiency the Government has been
compelled to grant American registry to a number
of foreign ships employed for transports, and it ap
pears that even the resort to that expedient has not
been sufficient to the needs of the war in the West
Indies.
Another feature of the problem is worth noting.
It is estimated that the people of the United States
pay annually $300,000,000 to foreign ship-owners for
carrying our commerce across the ocean. That sum
is about one-half what it will cost us to carry on the
war for a year. If we could save the money now
paid to foreign ships we would thereby largely make
up for the expense of the conflict with Spain. Two
advantages in war would result from the adoption of
a policy calculated to promote and expand our mer
chant marine: we' would be better provided for
transporting troops promptly wherever they were
needed and we would be better able financially to
support war. Even from a military view it will be
seen, therefore, that protection to American ship
building is a thing to be desired and demanded of
Congress at its next session.
Russia's attitude toward the Philippines is being
discussed. At this writing Russia ha 3 no business
to have an attitude toward them. She is understood
to have affairs of her own to attend to, anyhow.
There is not help for it. We will be Yankee pigs
so long as liquid Spanish, garlic flavored, shall charm
the ear, and urge the nose to exile.
If Spain is really anxious for peace there is a way
to obtain it.
SHUT THE DOORS ON COOLIES.
IT is to be regretted that the Pacific Coast Sena
tors, who were such earnest supporters of the an
nexation of Hawaii, and whose votes coined the
measure, had not sufticient influence to secure the
appointment of a Pacific Coast representative on the
commission which is to frame a government for the
islands. This coast, and especially California, has
a greater interest in what is done in Hawaii than all
the rest of the country.
It is true that the annexation resolution, which
cleared the constitution at one jump, says that there
shall be no more Chinese immigration to Hawaii, by
virtue of anything therein contained, which is a mere
shuffle and evasion, a pretense at prohibition which
prohibits nothing. The full objection of California
is to Asiatic coolies, whether Chinese, Japanese, Bur
mese or East Indians. The East India coolie has
been domesticated in the American tropics and proved
the same sort of pest as the Chinese here. So, grant
ing that the- doughy and deceptive phrase grafted out
of the treaty into the resolution does exclude Chi
nese coolies, it by no means excludes all Asiatic cool
ies and coolie wages. The interests of labor in Cal
ifornia require that the form of government framed
for Hawaii shall exclude all coolie labor and coolie
wages; that it shall put employes here and there on
an exact equality. This is a necessity for California.
Our laboring people here have felt keenly, and re
sented with spirit, the manufacture of uniforms for
the War Department by coolie labor. If labor is
touched in its dinner pail by the employment of a
hundred coolies in such competition, is it not far
more interested in the competition of 40,000 coolies
under our flag in Hawaii?
The overthrow of slavery in this country came
when it was understood by free white labor that black
slave labor competition was unfair to it, and when
the Northern employer felt himself handicapped by
the Southern slaveholder's chattel ownership of labor.
It presented unequal conditions for both labor and
capital under a government founded upon equality,
and the interests of all were found to require the
maintenance of equality. It was a profound im
pression of this necessity that made Lincoln declare:
"A house divided against itself cannot stand. The
republic must be all free or all slave."
The issue involved then was labor, nothing else.
In the annexation of Hawaii that issue is presented
again, as forcibly as to Lincoln and the men of his
generation. We cannot have one law and servile
labor for an Hawaiian planter and another law and
white labor at white wages for a California rancher,
both under the same flag. A house divided against
itself cannot stand now any more than in Lincoln's
time.
At least one of the Hawaiian commissioners should
have been from this coast. But we are ignored.
With one exception the Western Senarors helped an
nexation, when they could have beaten it, and labor
finds that they have committed its interests to an
old slaveholder from Alabama and two men from
Illinois! It is the old story. The West beats the
bush; the East and South get the game.
What means are left for protecting white labor
should be used at once. Our interests require that
all Asiatic coolies and blackbirds now in Hawaii be
immediately deported, and that our present labor
laws, the eight-hnur day and all be at once extended
to the islands. To this no reasonable objections can
be made. We live and thrive under these laws here
and thrift that cannot be under them has no right to
be at all.
GERMANY fIND THE PHILIPPINES.
DESPITE the official denials of any intention on
the part of Germany to interfere with the
United States in the Philippines, rumors of the
possibility of such interference continue. The fact
that nearly the whole German fleet in the Orient has
been assembled at Manila, avowedly to protect Ger
man interests there, tends to confirm the rumors.
Moreover, the speech of Embassador White at the
Fourth of July banquet at Leipsic inclines the same
way. Evidently our Embassador at the court of Ber
lin would not have made such an address if he did not
fear the possibility of some misconception on the part
of the German people and Government concerning
the position the United States has assumed and will
maintain with respect to foreign intervention.
An explanation of the apparent contradiction be
tween the facts of the situation and the official denial
of any intention to interfere has been recently given
by the Washington correspondent of the New York
Sun, which seems plausible. According to this state
ment the German Government will not object to the
assumption of complete control over the Philippines
by the United States, nor will it oppose the selection
and maintenance by this country of a coaling station
if it is not located at Manila. What appears to con
cern Germany most is an assumption by the United
States of the right to dispose of the islands to other
nations or to the insurgents, retaining only such terri
tory as the Washington Government may see fit.
It is believed that if the United States retains Manila
and a small portion of adjacent territory as a coaling
station Germany will find grounds for protest in the
fact that in holding Manila, the port having the bulk
of the Philippine trade, and not assuming control
over the rest of the island of Luzon and the group;
this country leaves the islands without a settled form
of government, thus leaving the way clear for con
tinual disturbances, which might result in interference
by the great powers and perhaps bring on a war in
volving most of Europe.
This explanation has at least the merit of accord
ing with all the known facts of the problem. It offers
a reason for the assembling of the German fleet at
Manila, and also of the German denial of any inten
tion of interfering so long as our fleet is there. If
the United States desires the islands Germany will
have nothing to say. If we abandon the islands, then
Germany will be prepared to act at once to protect
her interests.
The late British Consul to Havana seems to possess
some peculiar ideas. According to his notion af
fairs in that city are not particularly serious, but
he adds that hundreds are dying of starvation. Per
haps if the gentleman had missed a meal or two his
mind would be in a condition to calch the somber
aspect of events.
Volunteer troops of New York, Massachusetts and
Michigan have been building roads in Cuba. Such
work as this, it will be remembered, was too laborious
and unmilitary for the haughty Cubans. For this
reason many people think less of the Cubans than
they did.
"If we make peace now we deserve to b; shot in
the face," exclaims one excited editor in Madrid.
And if you don't make pea?e you are mighty likely
to get shot somewhere, probably, however, not in the
face.
Possibly the President desired that his Hawaiian
commissioners should go to the scene of their labors
unhampered by any knowledge of the situation.
Cervcra is receiving a more cordial welcome in this
country than he will ever get in his own.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, WEDKESBAT, JTJLT 13, 1898.
BY the speed programme adopted by the Board
of Agriculture, for the coming State Fair at
Sacramento, promise is given of one of the
best racing meetings ever held in California. As
arranged the programme will probably be found more
satisfactory than any previous one, both to the people
generally and to horsemen, and will no doubt prove
one of the successes of the year.
The most noted innovation in the programme is
the adoption of the single dash system of racing in
stead of the old form of heats. On each day there
will be five events, one of which will be a mile and
repeat race, thus providing sport lively enough to
satisfy the most exacting seeker after excitement and
sparing the public the tedious waits between heats.
The new system will also be of advantage to racing
men, as horses can be raced under it every day with
out suffering the ill effects of overwork. Another
advantage will be gained by holding the running and
trotting contests on alternate days, thus keeping
both classes of horses at the fair until the meeting is
over.
The excellence of the Epeed programme adopted
gives promise of an equal excellence In all other ar
rangements to be made for the fair. This promise
there is reason to believe will be fulfilled in every
respect. The conditions of the year prompt to the
holding of a great exhibit of our agricultural re
sources. The drought of the winter and spring and
the hot northers that came with the early summer
have given rise to reports that our rural production
this season will be extremely small. These reports
have been more or less injurious to the State, and
every effort will be made by enterprising men to
show at the State Fair that a drought cannot dry
up all California, nor a hot wind blast all her crops.
The very adverseness of the season will rouse us
to make a State Fair better and finer than any other
of the season in the Union.
The present Board of Agriculture !s composed of
men whose interest in the welfare of our rural in
dustries is undoubted, and from their management
much good may be expected. ThÂ«re should be a
thorough co-operation among all the counties of
every part of the State to make the fair an excep
tionally comprehensive one. We shnll soon be called
upon to prepare our exhibits for the world's great
exposition at Pari?, and this is a good year to have a
full dress, rehearsal of the State display at Sacra
mento.
THE SAN JOSE HIGH SCHOOL.
rOR the time being the San Jose High School
occupies in our educational system a position
more conspicuous than that ot any other insti
tution. It has become the storm center around
which rages the fight of honorable educators and
good citizens against the boss rule of politicians who
seek to make our schools a part of the spoils of poli
tics, and to use the positions and salaries of teachers
as rewards for the henchmen who do tlieir service.
The San Jose gang, desiring to give place and sal
ary to some anonymunculus of their stripe recently
dismissed from the High School its most eminent
and one of its most esteemed professors. The rea
sons assigned by the gang for dismissing him are
peculiar. It was alleged first that he Is a traitor, in
asmuch as he once said that President Grant should
have settled the Cuban question at the time of the
Virginias affair; and, second, that he lacks religion,
being, according to the gang, "an infidel." These
charges w'cre abundantly refuted by the pupils of his
school who heard his lectures. The gang then
abandoned al4 attempts at justifying their course and
fell back upon the old question, "What are you going
to do about it?"
The students of the High School, their parents
and all the host of citizens who believe that our
school system should be freed from the corrupting
domination of political bosses have undertaken to
do a good deal about it. The students will not at
tend the High School under the anonymunculus who,
from his very acceptance of Professor Smith's place,
can be nothing more in San Jose than a servile crea
ture of the gang, no matter what he may have been
elsewhere. The parents support tfte students and
all the advocates of a pure school system support
the parents.
The gang has possession of the school, the salary
and the creature they have chosen to degrade the
one and draw the other. The friends of the school
system have on their side the student body, public
opinion and justice. The fight is on, and through
out the State the attention of all persons who are
interested in our public schools is directed to the
conflict.
It is a bitter contest now, and the prospects are
it will be fought to the end without compromise. If
it should so result, then the San Jose High School
will in a short time be ranked either as one of the
educational institutions of which California has most
ripht to be proud â as a school in which the purity
of education is unstained by the corruption of low
politics â or as a feeding place for the gang, and not
more respectable than any other place where the
bosses resort and henchmen get their pay.
T~N EPORTS from Washington are to the effect
[â J that subscriptions to the $200,000,000 bond is
* sue, which will close on Thursday, have been
received in such numbers and are coming in with
such rapidity that it is now evident the amount asked
will be subscribed several times over.
This will necessitate a discrimination in issuing the
bonds, and in accordance with the plan announced
the smaller bidders will be preferred over those who
subscribed for larger amounts. It is expected that
when the allotment is made the bonds will be dis
tributed among upward of 200,000 persons, thus mak
ing the average subscription about $1000.
This report is in the highest degree gratifying.
The subscription to the loan made by such a con
siderable number of citizens not only attests the wide
spread patriotism of the people, but shows that a
general prosperity prevails in the country. It is no
slight evidence of good times to find that more than
200,000 people have money on hand which they are
able to lend at so low a rate of interest as that of
fered for the war loan. It is also pleasing that the
loan is in this way to be taken throughout the Union
and that the annual interest upon it will be paid in
all sections, and not to holders in the great money
centers only.
The success of the popular loan will impress the
financiers of Europe as forcibly as the victories at
Manila and Santiago have impressed their naval
authorities. It is another demonstration o: the vast
strength of the United States and of the ability of
our people to maintain any war that may come

Clearly, we have the right to sing the jingo chorus,
"We have the ships, we have the men and we have
the money, too," and in our singing there is no vain
boasting. The fact will be recorded in the digni

song itself. The nation is all right. Uncle Sam
has money enough to meet every emergency of peace

$ HOW ANDREWS g
Â» FOUND Â»
B HIS BED. P_
away the heavy hours when business is
slack or the accounts of the clay rounded
up. W. J. Andrews, the Pacific Coast
agent for a number of large carriage fac
tories, dropped in the other day and was
immediately elected a member of the
club. The initiatory rites were dispensed
with, and Mr. Andrews was let down for
a round of cocktails. It was then incum
bent upon him to tell a story which would
reflect upon his own dignity and show to
his fellows that he was of the earth and
mortal. This is the way It went: "I
have just returned from San Jose, gen
tlemen, and there went through a trying
experience. Many years ago I was a
resident in that most beautiful city of
flowers and pure politics, and I left it
just as the population began to move out
ward and inhabit the suburbs. Of course,
since that time the city has grown. Well,
in my present visit I found some old ac
quaintances, and they showed me several
new places with mirrors and beautiful
electric lights, such as the old town did
not boast of. I forgot just how many
such gilded and handsome establishments
I was introduced to, but when the hour
for retiring came I did not exactly re
member the location of my hotel. My
friends said good night and left me. There
I was in a large and comparatively
strange city, with a bed waiting for me,
and I could not recollect its place upon
the map. I wandered and wandered, and
after several hours of fruitless tramping
âI reached Santa Clara, as I afterward
discoveredâ l heard a great noise as of a
fire engine and other such vehicles, rush
ing to a fire. I shouted, 'Where's the
fire?' and the answer came back, 'Second
and Fernando.'
" 'I'm saved,' I cried; 'that's where I
live,' and I chased that engine clean Into
San Jose. I found my bed."

O.SSOSSSSSS salnts> Even the
American boy in
blue, well behaved as he usually Is. some
times lapses from the strict path of recti
tude, as many a saloon-keeper can testify.
When a whole company of men fllo into
a saloon and absorb an unlimited quantity
of steam beer, it is not always easy to
ascertain who Is responsible for the finan
cial end of the transaction, and soldiers
have such an aggravating 1 way of sticking
together that the bartender finds It
dangerous to vent his wrath on any one
individual. True, he can ring for the po
lice patrol,-but this course does not help
him much, as a saloon-keeper on Sutter
street found out last night.
The place, which is noted for the ex
cellent quality of ita beer and the liber
ality with which sausage and sauerkraut
are dispensed to all comers, is kept by an
irascible little German. Mine host's face
simply beamed when a large party of
soldiers marched into his saloon and
lined up with military precision at the
bar. But ten minutes later there was no
German swear word huge enough to ex
press his indignation, as he tried to ex
plain matters to a couple of policemen
who had answered his hurried call.
"Dey comes into my bar," he said, "mit
em little fellow at the head. And he says,
'Halt, boys,' and they halted. 'Eyes front,
face de bar. name your liquors.' I vas
much pleased, and says, 'Gentlemens, vat
vill you hafs?'
"Mem Gott! Some dey takes beers and
some viskey. I puts down der viskey bot
tle, so dat dey may helps demselves, and
it vas a voll bottle, too. Den another
man says, sudden like, 'I guess I'll take
claret.' I turns round to get der claret,
and yen I comes back mit It, lleber Gott,
der vas no viskey!"
Here was a problem for the perplexed
officers of the law to solve. The whisky
had vanished from sight as mysteriously
as your watch does when you lend It to
a conjuror. It was vain to inquire who
took the whisky. The soldiers would not
and the saloon-keeper could not point out
the man. The bottle was gone, and that
was all about it. As it was obviously im
possible to arrest the whole company, the
policemen gave up the job and adjudicat
ed on the bill for liquors actually con
sumed. When this had been settled the
soldiers left, byt as soon as the officers'
backs were turned they lined up on tha
sidewalk, gave three cheers for the
saloon-keeper, and drank his health in his
own booze.

THE OKDERED AWAY.
At the end of each street a banner we
meet:
The people all march In a mass;
But quickly aside they step back with
pride
To let the brave companies pass.
The streets are well filled, but the laugh
ter is still'd;
The crowd is all going one way;
Their cheeks are bleached white, still
they smile with delight,
While lifting their hats to the Ordered
Away.
They smile while a dart deeply pierces i
each heart,
But each eye flashes back Its war
glance
As they watch the trim file march up ;
with a smile
'Neath their flag with their musket and
lance.
The cannon's loud roar Is heard on the
shore,
But the people are quiet to-day.
As, startled, they see how fearless and
free . #
March the soldiersâ the Ordered Away.
Not a quiver or gleam of fear can be seen,
Tho' they go to meet death in disguise;
For the hot air is filled with poison dis
tilled
'Neath the rays of Manila's fair skies.
Hurk! the bugle and fife awake to new
life
The soldiers who "can't get away,"
And wish as they wave- their hats to the
brave
That they were the â Ordered Away.
As our parting grows near let us drive
back the tear â
Let our smiles shine as bright as of
yore;
Let us stand with the mass â salute as
they pass.
And weep when we see them no more.
Let no tear drop bedim the sunlight of
our eye.
Or sigh fall from lips this brave day,
While waving: a. hand to the brave little
band â
"Good-by" to the â Ordered Away.
Let them go In God's name in the search
for their fame â
Face death, where thÂ© fierce cannons
roar;
Let them honor and save the land of the
brave ;
Plant freedom's bright flag on the
shore:
Let them go while we weep and lone
vigils keep.
We will bless them and fervently pray
To the God whom we trust for our cause
which is just.
And our loved onesâ the Ordered Away.
When fierce battles rage we will rise up
each morn,
Teach our young sons the saber to
wield;
Should their brave fathers die we will
arm thorn to fly
And fill up the gap in the field.
Then, fathers and brothers, fond hus
bands and lovers,
March! march bravely on. We will stay
Alone in our sorrow to pray on each
morrow , .
For our loved onesâ the Ordered Away.

WORK OF THE NAVAL AUXIL
IARY BOARD.
The naval auxiliary board was dissolved
on June 30, Its officers detailed to other
duties and no more vessels are likely to
be purchased for the use of the navy.
This board was appointed at the outbreak
of the present war and to it was intrusted
the responsibility of the purchase or
charter of merchant vessels to be used
as auxiliary naval vessels. The few ex
ceptional cases savoring of sharp prac
tice, unpreventable in emergencies such
as existed three months ago, were not
with the approval of the auxiliary board,
and the matter will probably be ventilat
ed when Congress is furnished with the
itemized expenditures incurred in behalf
of the navy. Since April 8 eighty-nine
merchant vessels, embracing thirty-two
steamships and yachts, thirty-two colliers
and special service vessels andtwenty-nvo
tugs, have been purchased, and the four
large steamers of the American Steam
ship line, namely the St. Louis, St. Paul,
Paris and New York, have been char
tered, making a total auxiliary fleet of
ninety-three steam vessels of all descrip
tions. The cost of this fleet can only be
approximated, but will probably not ex
ceed $12,000,000, In which, however, the
enormous charter money, which aggre
gates $20,000 a day for the four liners, is
not included.
To officer and man this fleet the regu
lar force of the navy personnel was en
tirely inadequate, and 693 volunteer offi
cers of all grades have been appointed
up to July 1. Of these 348 are lieutenants,
junior lieutenants and ensigns, forty-eight
assistant surgeons, thirty-eight assistant
paymasters, 225 in the engineer corps and
thirty-four in other grades.
The withdrawal from shore duty of so
many officers of the line and staff to duty
at sea has necessitated the temporary
assignment of IS2 officers from the retired
list and the complement of the fifteen
revenue cutters, four lighthouse tenders
and two Fish Commission vessels. The
total number of officers of all grades in
the regular navy, volunteers and revenue
marine available for sea duty is about
2230, of which a little more than one
half are actually at sea in 168 vessels.
As compared with the navy material
and personnel of 1861 and 1865, the present
Is insignificant as to number of ships and
officers, but the efficiency of the ships la
far greater now, and the personnel com
pares favorably with that of thirty odd
years ago. The regular navy in IS6I, im
mediately after the capture of the Nor
folk navy yard, was reduced to seventy
nine vessels, of which only thirty sailing
ships and twenty-five steamers were ser
viceable. During the following four years
this number was augmented by 178 yes-
Bels-of-war, built in the navy and private
yards at a cost of $64,000,000, and 439 mer
chant vessels were purchased at an ag
gregate cost of $19,674,000, besides fifty
eight prize vessels. In 1865 there were
687 vessels on the navy list; three yeara
later the number had dwindled down to
232, and the reduction continued until
1887, since which time the navy has in
creased in number as well as In efficiency.
The personnel of the navy was in simi
lar bad condition. On January 1, 18*51,
there were 1271 sea-soing officers of all
grades, but resignations and dismissals to
the number of 380 left the navy list in a
crippled condition. To make it still more
embarrassing many of the officers who
remained were found unfit for active ser
vice, and t1.2 large numbers of volunteer
officers which offered their services were
gladly accepted. There is no official in
formation as to the number of volunteer
officers which entered the navy; the Navy
Department, in its report of 1866, gives It
at "about 7500 of these gallant and gen
erous spirits/ and a carefully compiled
resume of those who were discharged, re
signed, died, etc., makes the total rather
more. The largest number of volunteers
were on the Register January 1, 1865, and
numbered 1989 of the line, 2424 staff and &47
warrant officers. The following table
shows what became of these 5260 officers,
and how the members of the several
corps severed their connection with tho
navy:

1106, or one-seventh of the total number,
were found unsuited or undesirable and
disposed of, and that 89, or one out of
every 'JO, took "French leave." But the
record is as a whole every creditable to a
lot of men drawn from the merchant ser
vice without any but hazy ideas of naval
discipline and military duty. ' Quite a
number were absorbed by the regular
navy, such as nearly all the ex-navy offi
cers who had volunteered. Three hun
dred and seven volunteers entered the
several corps in the regular army, namely
83 in the line, 133 in the staff corps and 41
as warrant officers. At the conclusion of
the present war the chances of volunteers
becoming regular officers are but slight,
and will be confined almost entirely to the
medical and pay corps.
WARS CANNOT BE LOCALIZED.
Every suggestion of the acquisition by
the United States of any bit of territory
distant from our present possessions al
ways excites the narrow-minded believ
ers' in a Little America at home and tha
jealous preachers of a Little America
abroad to declare that any such expan
sion would be equivalent to a declaration
on our part that we were going hence
forth to meddle in all the difficulties of
other powers and depart from our tradi
tional policy of being free frum entangl
ing alliances. A coaling station at the
Canaries, they think, would never give U3
a moment's peace, for b.>tV:< ing about
what was going on in Afrits, and the
possession of the Philippines would draw
us into every squabble over the spoils of
China. Why would it? Squabbles of a
most annoying kind have been going on
in Cuba for half a century, but in all that
time with the most extreme forbearanco
we refrained from interference. Mexico
and Central America have had revolu
tions without number, but we have been
less inclined to take a hand than some of
the nations whose holdings were far more
remote.
It is not neighborhood, but disposition,
that makes for quarrels, and the United
States has never shown a quarrelsome
disposition toward the rest of the world,
even though its frankness may at times
have been unsettling to European nerves.
The Americans are essentially a peaceful
people, 1 little inclined to join in other
countries' battles, and as far as possible
removed from all tendency to become a
militant power. â Xew York Tribune.

The full regimental requisition for
clothing and equipage has been completed
and turned into the Quartermaster's De
partment In San Francisco. As soon as
it Is tilled the regiment will be ready to
go anywhere. The requisition for ord
nance was made several days ago and the
supplies are expected shortly.

FOURTEENTH REGULARS.
Five Companies Largely Re
cruited From the Best Young
Men of California.
â When the five companies of the Four
teentb United States Infantry, which loft
this city with the first expedition for
Manila, sailed away, a remnant of Com
pany G, under command of Major Robe,
remained here for the purpose of re
cruiting the regiment up to its required
strength. This has been done with the
gr< atest success, and the five companies
that will march from Camp Merrttt to
day or to-morrow represent as fine a
body of men as are to be found in the
service. In less than two months these
companies have been recruited, equipped
and drilled until they are so nearly per
â  as soldiers that none but the expert
em ed eye can tell them from the regu
lars. This fact is a source of great sat
isfaction and pride to the people of Cali
l and San Francisco In particular,
for these companies have been largely
recruited from the students of Berkeley
and Stanford universities, while by nb
means a few of them are San Francisco
boys. Some of the best young- men of the
city, representatives of the highest cir
cles of Boclety, wear the blue as privates
in the Fourteenth.
The officers <>f the companies are loud
in the praise both of the efficiency and
ict of the men, and it has been com
mented upon at Camp Merritt that the
camp of the Fourteenth Infantry haa
be< n one of the most orderly and best
conducted "f all the troops. The privates
uf this command have shown a willing
nesa t" ':â¢ irn, and so faithfullly have they
â â â ' under their efficient drill mas
ters that it is an acknowledged fact that
they are superior In their drill to any
other body of men that have been In the
service the same length of time. Right
here a very pertinent remark mad" by
one of the officers may be quoted, which
will explain thw- happy state of i
existing in the companies: "We allow the
men every Hberty, but when they are
drilling 1 it means business and that fact
Is bo Impressed upon their minds that
they cannot forget it. Then, too,
an- commanded by men who have been
eduoatci to be army officers."

Death of a Young Volunteer
From Tennesseeâ A Funeral
in 31st lowa Regiment.
Private Charles Gambrill, Company A.
First Tennessee Regiment, died yesterday
at the Marine Hospital of meningitis. His
remains were sent last night to his
parents at Lebanon, Term. The young
soldier's father is a prominent railroad
man in the East, and when his son en
listed he tried to persuade him to leave
t >iÂ»- regiment. He declared when the
regiment left that no ne%-er expected to
Bee his son aga.ri, and gave directions as
to where his remains should be sent, and
he was firmly convinced that the young
Boldier would never return to his home.
The funeral of Private Ritter, Company
M, Fifty-firÃt lowa Regiment, took place
from the French Hospital yesterday
afternoon. The remains were escorted to
their last resting place by the Second
Battalion of the regiment, under the com
mand of Major Hume, chaplain Williams
read the Bervice over the soldier's grave.
Private Mlllard Auxi.-r, First Nebraska
Recruits, was tak-n to the French Hos
pital. He Is very ill with pneumonia.

expeditionary forces. The present dlv'-i ,n
designation will be continued but the duties
of the command will be confined to matte"
arising within the various organizations of
which It is composed. Upon the departure o.

DUNGAN'S "COLD FEET."
Eight Men of Woodland Who Stood True to Their Country
Tell the Inside Story of the Recent Mutiny.
CAMP BARRETT, July 12, 1898.
Editor Call: Having been quiet for a week while all kinds of opinions have been published about us, we
wish to speak through your paper to the Woodland Company, that came here, contracted "cold feet" and re
turned. There are eight of us not tied up to any individual, but who came here in good faith, intending to
follow our flag and do our duty wherever we might be ordered. The secret of the trouble in the "Woodland
Company has not yet been told. It was born and bred by Private Dungan, editor of the "Woodland Mail. In
the first place, we do not believe (and this idea of ours seems to have been proved) that Mr. Dungan ever in
tended to go farther away from his home than the bay. We believe it was his idea to have a nice summer
outing during which he could do a little politics at the expense of the State, and when he saw that there was
danger of our regiment being ordered to Manila, or to Cuba, he was forced to get up some scheme to let him
self down easily. He did it by creating trouble as soon as it was known there was to be a change of cap
tains. Before, he left Woodland he published in his little paper a very pathetic farewell, In which he referred
to the call of duty and to his determination to follow the flag. It now appears that he was merely deter
mined to follow some particular captain so long as he was captain. It is our belief that if Private Dungan
had been substituted for the Woodland captain there would have been no kick. Since returning to Woodland
many of the boys whom he misled and induced to disgrace themselves have telegraphed to Lieutenant George
Peart to see if they could not get back, but they have received no encouragement. The Honorable Governor
Budd can give Mr. Dungan of the Mail the credit for breaking up the company and for being the mouthpiece
of the whole business
Not content with being a subject of "cold feet" himself, he referred to us who remained as "the
scabby eight." We do not believe that the people of California regard us in any such light. Since he left
camp with his pets, the eyes of the boys have been opened and everybody considers it better that Private
Dungan created his little rebellion here in Fruitvale than at some critical time when the necessity for a change
of captain might have been rendered absolute by circumstances which neither Governor Budd nor any other
human being could control. If the Woodland boys and their would-be toy soldier editor were to visit Camp
Barrett again, they would pro-bably be tossed in a blanket and not let down so easy as they would like.

TO ESCORT NEW YORKERS.
Captain Putnam B. Strong Will
Meet the Volunteers From
the Empire State.
Captain Putnnm Bradiee Strong, as
sistant adjutant general of the First Brig
ade on the staff of Brigadier General
Marcus P. Miller, was yesterday relieved
from duty wiih the First Brigade and or-
I to report to Major General E. S.
Otis for duty, and to accompany him to
the Philippine Islands. General Miller ex
pressed regret at losing the services of
Captain Strong, for he has made a most
efficient and capable officer as assistant
adjutant general. Later in the day Cap
tain Strong was detailed by General Mil
ler to meet the First New York Regiment
at the ferry this morning, and escort the
command to Camp Merritt. His selection
| as an escort to the New York Regiment
w .- a compliment paid him by General
Mill- r, as the captain is a native of New
York, and numbers Colonel Harbee and
many officers of the First New York
among his personal friends.
Lieutenant Charles B. Munton, Twenty
third Infantry, has been detailed by Ma
jor <; lale to accompany the recruits in
tend.-d for the First and Second battal
ions of that regiment to the Philippines.
NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS.
The First Regiment Will Prob
ably Reach Oakland Mole
Early This Afternoon.
Definite intelligence regarding 1 the time
that the Now York regiment will arrive
in San Francisco is difficult to obtain.
The train bringing 1304 officers and enlist
ed men is running in four sections, the
first of which was scheduled to arrive
early this morning and the last some time
i his afternoon. Late last night word was
received that all the sections were west of
Carlin and would be consolidated at Sac
ramento this morning and start for San
Francisco in close order. Members of the
New York committee of this city had been
planning to receive tho volunteers at the
Mechanics' Pavilion to-morrow morning,
but as the train will arrive earlier than
was expected, the arrangements must In
changed. Time, is so essential an element
in the preparations for the regiment to
embark for Honolulu that it may be taken
for granted that Colonel Barber will not
allow his men to be detained at the Oak
land Mole over night to await the con
venience of the reception committee In
San Francisco.
AGAIN POSTPONED.
The Troops for the Peru and
City of Puebla Will Em
bark To-Morrow.
The troops that are to sail for Manila
in the transports Peru and City of Puebla
will not embark until to-morrow, and the
departure will not take place until Friday
and probably not until Saturday. The
loading of the baggage will be completed
to-day.
At military headquarters Major General
Otis and his staff are closing up their af
fairs as rapidly as possible. General
Otis is in frequent consultation with
Major General Merriam, commander of
the Department of California, in regard to
various matters needing attention after,
his departure, and also in relation to the
Hawaiian Islands. It is intimated that
the delay in starting for Honolulu and
Manila is due to orders from Washington
to wait for the arrival of important docu
ments from the Department of State.

ACTIVE SERVICE DETAIL.
Seventh California and First
Montana Are Assigned for
Duty at the Philippines.
Major General Otis has practically
finished his plans for the second half of
the fourth expedition. The three boats
comprising It will sail from this port on ;
the 25th inst. The bulk of the Third Bri- ;
gade has been selected to sail. Colonel
Berry, commanding the Seventh Califor
nia, and Colonel Kessler, commanding
the First Montana, have been notified by !
Major General Otis that they will sail on ;
that date. The rest of the expedition will
be made up of either the South Dakota or
Fifty-first lowa troops, with the South !
Dakotas given the preference. Brigadier ;
General Otis, now commanding, will be
in charge, unless at the last minute he
is ordered to accompany Major General
Otis on Thursday.
A number of changes were made late
last night in the preliminary arrange
ments for Thursday's expedition.
The recruits of the Eighteenth Infan
try were erased from the list of those to
to aod a squad of eight men from the
signal corps were detailed to occupy the
vacant space.
The Fourteenth was originally ordered
to break camp to-day. Last night this
order was changed and the boys will not
go aboard until to-morrow.
All extra commissary supplies are being
packed aboard to-day, and by this even
ing all that will remain to be done will
be to drop and pack the tents. Thursday
morning will sc-e the fourth great ex
odus.
Hospital arrangements are completed.
One full steward and two acting stew
ards, with ten privates, will go aboard the
Peru. Two acting stewards with ten pri
vates will constitute the medical force of
the Puebla.
Lieutenant Surgeon Kemp of the Eight
eenth and Acting Assistant Surgeons
Quinan, Richardson and McQuesten will
be in charge.
Relics and a Damascus Blade.
The First Troop of Utah Cavalry has a
couple of relics that are somewhat out of
the usual line of things that bring luck.
One is an old sword of revolutionary pat
tern that saw bloody service through the
earliest struggle, in the war of ISI2,
through subsequent Indian troubles and
finally in the rebellion. The great-grandson
of the original owner is now carrying it
to Manila with him.
The other lucky piece of the troop Is a
camel's hair blanket once the property of
a Major Fairlelgh. who, legend hath it,
wns smothered in his tent before Lucknow.
He was trying to warm himself before an
open charcoal burner. One of Sir Colin
Campbell's staff olHcers kept off the cold
with It during the Sepoy rebellion. Some
years later it went through the rebellion
of Louis Hii-1 in Canada, and it has since
found its eventful way to one of the re
cruits of the Utahs and Is bound again
to the front to do duty either as severrj
abdominal bandug.es or along the. lines ot
previous usefulness.
Captain Guthrie, commanding officer of
! Company H. Sixth California, has already
i had an extremely interesting military ex
perience. He served with the Belgian
; army during the troubles in the Congo
j Free State, South Africa. For distin
! puished service at that time King Leopold
presented him with a handsome Damascus
sword, which the captain now carries.
Cuptain Guthrie*B brother is now Gover
nor of one of the States of the Congo
country.
Wail Over the Departed.
The fourth expedition will not go from
thfse shores to far Manila unmourned.
From among tho flock of trades people
legitimate and otherwise, who infest the
purlieus of a military camp, there is aris
ing a great and bitter cry of disappoint
ment. Many of the departing boys have

Signal Corps Election.
The Signal Corps of the Second Brigade
of the California National Guard last
evening elected Charles Hughes captain,
and Charles Hazeltine first lieutenant.
Major Evans presided at the meeting,
which was a very harmonious affair. The

adjourned to the Good Fellows' Grotto
and, for a couple of hours, enjoyed them
selves at a banquet. Among those pres
ent were ten veteran members of the
corps.

GREAT RACING
AT OAKLAND
Myrtle Thorne Lowers |
Her Record.
BEACHWOOD WINS EASILY j
_ I
THE HE RACE FALLS TO
MUCH BETTER.
A Job in the Last Special Scented Out
by the Judges and Nellie
Bly Takes a,
Â Mark.
The racing: yesterday at Oakland was
exciting though no track record was :
broken, and In the main the books did a I
fairly remunerative business, favorites
about dividing tho honors with outsiders.
Professor lleald's good black mare
Myrtle Thorne at 3 to 2, ably piloted by |
Billy Donathan, won the tirst race, a 2:19 j
trot, over Dr. J, who was tho medium of 1
a strong play and backed down to 4 to 1.
After lying a. comfortable second to the
middle of the back Myrtle moved up at
the half pole, and taking the lead trotted !
the home stretch in :33%: winning handily
In 2:18, thus lowering her record by a
Quarter of a second.
Beachwood, as was expected, won the
2:IS pace off. the reel, she opening at 2 to 3
&nd then quoted at 7 to 10 and closing at
X to 2. It was a Cakewalk for the bilk
wood mare In 2:15, the three-year-old lilly
Dlctatrtss under a drive getting the place
from Butcher Boy. Considerable money j
was played on the chestnut gelding, -
Uutcher Boy, at 6 to 5 and even money '
for a place. William Baker and Fitz
Aymon, on which quite a lot of coin was
Invested, were both behind the money.
The 2:25 pace, heats, two in three, went I
to Much Better quite handily uiter losing I
the second heat to the hoppled Abdine. |
In the rirst heat Mark II had the call in j
the auctions against the lleld, $5 to $5, but !
finished third and ail out in 2:15V4, !
whereon the talent switched to Mucli
Better, and she. JustlrU*d. their coolidence !
by winning the deciding heat in 2:l9V*>. j
after losing tho Becond neat to Abdine â¢
under a. drive by a short half length in
2: 17
The special for named horses, wejit to '
Thompson on sufferance, Mamie Riley be- j
ing once again placed in 2:17. Durfee I
takes advantage of the fact that the |
rules have no Jurisdiction in dash races,
She has been timed the last half in 1:06%,
a 2:l3Vj gait, yet apparently is driven \
merely for place money. Mojave, with
speed to burn. wa,s. once again terribly i
unsteady, losing all chance from the very
etart.
The last race, also a special, fell the
first time of asking to Pilot McLellan,
favorite at 2 to 5, in 2:26%, there being no !
show of a contest, and so palpable was
this that the Judges declared It off and i
gave lifteen minutes for a new book. !
There wus r.o change in the drivers,
which should have been made had there \
been suspicion of fraud, as for example ]
the Dexter D race. By the time the field I
was in the starter's hands the second j
time Nellie Bly was a hot first choice,
although she finished last the rirst time
nut, at Ito 2. Sho stepped away at a 2:20 j
gait to the quarter anu half and at the !
three-quarters it was 1:45& Then pulled
up she won in 2:204. showing that the i
judges' suspicions were well-founded.

four events, but two of them are heat !

Admiral Dewey Honored.
At a meeting of the trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday Admiral
Dewey was elected as a life member, an
honor that Is frequently bestowed upon
men who are worthly of Bpeclal attention
at the hands >>i the business men of this
r-ity. In the case of the Admiral his ser
vice-; to the commerce of the Pacitlc were
of Inestimable beneiu. When the Spanish
squadron was on the Asiastlc side of the
ocean the local rchnnts were in con
stant fear that v. flying trip would be
made to this sid.- and syeclal attention
paid by the foreigners to Western coin
mere**, to tho detriment of local interests
By destroying the Bhlpu of Spain at Ma
nila Admiral Dewey won the everlasting
gratitude of the members of the Chamber
of Commerce and this is one of the waya
by which they express their appreciation.
The election will surely be confirmed at
the meeting of the whole chamber on next
Tuesday. Resolutions memorial of the late
Admiral Ammen, who was an honorary
member of the chamber, were pased.

Suit Over a Mining Title.
Judge Morrow yesterday morning hand
ed down a decision In the case of 8.
"Webber Parker vs. A. 11. Rapp and oth
ers in favor of the plaintiff. On October
2, 189 G. Rapp entered Into an agreement
â with Parker to sell him the Crystalline
mines in Tuolumne County for the sum
of 5150,0 V). After the asrrr-ement had been
made Rnpp claimed that ho could not
give title as it was held by his partnei ,
Shafer. The court held that as Rapp and
Parker were partners in the transaction It
â¢was immaterial which one the power ot
giving title was vested in and awarded
the verdict to the plaintiff.
DEATH OF A TRAVELED CAT.
Tom, Mascot of the Steamer Alameda, Succumbs
The officers nrui crow of the steamer Alnrr.eda were In mourning yesterday.
Tom. the handsome big cat that for thirteen years acted as the shlp'n mascot,
is dead, and its owner. Chief Engineer Little, is disconsolate. Monday Tom
was talc'en slcit ahd Ms master doctored him as best he could and then sent
for a eat doctor. When the chief was going home that night Tom seemed, a lit
tle better, but the next morning he was dead.
Tom was probably the most traveled cat In the world, and had he lived
to reach Sydney. N. S. W., would have earned a gold collar for having sailed
a million miles by sea. When he died he wore a silver collar, which marked
the completion of 700,000 miles of travel. It was presented to him in Sydney and
bore the following inscription: "Old Tom. S. S. Alameda. Presented by his
American admirers, July 4. 1896." When Tom was a kitten he forsook the bark
Alden IJesse and took up his abode on the Alameda. Chief Engineer Little was
the only person aboard with whom he would make friends, and to him he re
mained faithful until the hour of his death.
Of the thousands who have sailed the Southern seas on the Alameda
there is not one but will remember Tom and his owner. They were great sub
jects for the camera (lends and Mr. J.itrle has over fifty different pictures by
various artists of the dead cat.
Tom's remains are not to be buried ashore. They have been placed In a
hermetically sealed linden casket, and when the steamer is in midocean the
burial will take place. He will, therefore, be buried in the waters of the Pa
cific, on which his life had been spent.
DETECTED THROUGH
HIS SWEETHEART
ATTORNEY A. M. HOLLIDAY AR-
RESTED IN OAKLAND.
He "Jumped" His Bonds Over Three
Mouths Ago and Has Been in
hiding Since.
A. M. TTolHday, a young attorney, who
jumped Ms bonds about three months ago
and has b'-en In hiding since, was arrested
in Oakland yesterday and brought to the
City Prison by Detective Dillon. He had
been living In a hotel In Oakland under
the name of A. M. Morton. He was lin
ally traced by his correspondence with
his best girl, who lives in this city.
Holliday was arrested in March last, on
two charges â one of obtaining money by
false pretenses and the other for passing
;; forged telegram. The complaining wn
i.ess in each case was N. J. Bailey, 132
Duncan street. Several months ago he

descendant of General Koehler of Eng
land, who died over a century ago. leav

share of the property.
He pretended to be In communication
with W. E. Sterling, a supposed attorney
in London, and showed a long cablegram
from him about Investigating into the
cii-se and wanting money to carry it on.
Holliday altogether got about $1500, and
finally it was discovered that the cable
gram was a fake, and that Attorney W.
K. Sterling was a myth. It was also as
certained by Attorney Frank P. Kelly,
who represents Bailey, that the Koehler
estate reverted to the crown over half a
i â¢ ntury ago.

AN ATTORNEY REBUKED.
Judge Hebbard Arraigns a Practi
tioner for Breach of Faith.
Attorney Friedlander sufft-red rebuke at
the hands of Judge Hebbard yesterday
morning:. The incident occurred in the
hearing of the action of R. B. Storms
against Washington Irwin to recover on
a promissory note. Last Saturday a motion
in connection with the case came up and
at that time Attorney Collier, represent
ing the plaintiff, and Friedlander repre
senting the defendant, agreed that the
case should lÂ»: tried yesterday. When the
case was called yesterday, however,Fried
lander refused to proceed, claiming that
his client had not been served with any
complaint or summons and In consequence
was not prepared to answor the suit. Vo\-
Her informed Friendlander of the agree
ment reached last Saturday and then call
ed the attention of the Court to the fuet
that the plaintiff was a Stockton man and
had been brought here to attend the trial
at considerable expense and at the loss
of much time. As Kriedlander refused to
yield Judge Hebbard then spoke. "Mr.
Friedlander, this action on your part after
the agreement you reached Saturday ia
yery unexpected," he said. "The moral
responsibility now rests with you to pay
the expenses attendant upon this trial
and also the expi-nsÂ«H of the plaintiff from
Stockton and return. The Tourt cannot
compel you to do so but morally you aro
bound. If you wish to take advantage ot
technicalities the case will have to stand
over until issue has been joined and the
pleadings completed. The Court cannot
prevent you, but it will remember the oc
currence at some future time."
Friedlander made no response and when
the Judge had concluded left the court
room.
HE CAME FROM SAN JOSE.

ing a girl from a den on Sullivan alley.
He went to the Presbyterian Mission
Home and. after stating his object, one
Of the ladies accompanied him, but wait
ed outside till he would give a signal.
The signal never came. When Yep
Shung entered the place on a different
pretext his r<-al intentions were suspected
and ten of his fellow-countrymen, who
were in the house, "didn't do a thing to
him." They stripped him of his silk coat
and trousers and. after giving him an un
merciful thrashing, threw him into the
street, to the consternation of the lady
from the mission.
Yesterday Yep Shung secured a war
rant from Judge Conlan for the arrest

WHITE WOMEN
DEMAND WORK
Widows and Wives of
Soldiers Insulted.
CHINESE LABOR PREFERRED
AN OUTRAGE INVESTIGATED BY
GRAND ARMY MEN.
They Ask That Soldiers' Uniforms
Should Not Be Made by Aliens,
but by American
Women.
The Grand Army of the Republic has
taken hold of the matter of getting the
work of making soldiers' uniforms away
from the sweat-shop contractors and their
coolie operatives and handing it over to
the deserving women who need this em
ployment. According to the story of W.
\V. Allen of Lyon Post the widow.s and
wives of the ofd soldiers have been very
shabbily treated by the people who pre
side over the local commissary depart
, ment. He states that several women
whose husbands fought for the Union
called upon him and complained that they
were unable to secure work, although they
are all competent to make garments for
the soldiers of the present war. Three of
theso women said that they had been
down to one of the contractors for work
and the wages offered were less than is
paid to Chinese.
When they refused a 25 per cent rate
I while tho contractor makes 75 per cent,
they were brusquely told to get out ot the
way and not bother any more. This caused
Mr. Allen to put on hih war paint ami now
he is working to Interest all of the Grand
Army pust* m seeing that Justice Is done.
He will make it his special business to
call at all of the O. A. R. posts and he has
no duubt that the Influence of the old sol
diers will be sufficient to get Major Long
to consider the rights of the white people
why need work, as against the Chinese.
and the contractors who are doing a
"skinning" business on the soldiers' gar
ments.
He added that he knows that tho Gov
ernment does not approve of the contract
system as it is followed here. Heretofore
this work has been duim by direct dealing
with the people who perform the labor.
In his efforts Mr. Allen will co-operate
| with the Labor Commissioner and endeav
or to effect such changes as will give the
I work where it will do the most good. The
Stutw otllcial Ik continuing the registration
of all women who desire to secure, this
kind of employment, and it is surprising'
how many have applied for a chance U
make an honest living. On Monday about
seventy registered their names, and yes
; terday the number was increased by about
: sixty."
Nearly all ftate that they have had ex
| perience in sewing and will be oniy too
I glad to secure enough to keep the wolf
away from the door. While many are
the wives and widows of the old soldiers,
; there is also a surprising number who
i have relatives in the present war and
1 who are hard pressed for the common
necessaries of life. A great many have
i applied by letter and several of these let
j ters are indeed pathetic. Commissioner
' Fitzgerald does not think that it will be
necessary for those who are Interested
j in the movement to hire a place where a
1 factory can be established. Most of tho
; applicants for work have home duties
; that would prevent them from j, r oing to
' v factory to work, and it Is argued that
there is no necessity for them to do so.
as the matter of getting employment can
â  be arranged through committees from the
Patriotic Home; Helpers and other Inter
â  ested bodies. The Home Helpers will
; meet at Metropolitan Temple this evening
, and take up this matter. Their efforts will
be to see if Major Lonp will co-operate
with them In giving the work to white
. women and not to contracting firms who â 
employ coolies. If successful, all well and
': good, but if the Helpers are not successful
; a mighty effort will be made to get the
! situation presented before, the War De

Commissloncr's' > bfn'ce yesterday there was
a small strike among the operatives at thp
Meyerstein factory on Monday. Some of
the gfrls get $1 60 per dozen for making
soldiers' coats ad others only $1 40 for the
same work. Those who eotlld get only the
smaller sum made a protest to the woman
who has Charge of the place and her an
swer was that she would give what she
saw lit and that if they did not like her
way of doing business they could get f out.
The women said that one "Sammy as
sisted in heaping insults on their heads.
The operatives apealed to Meyerstein and
were told that the woman who was in
charge of the factory had full "say in
the matter of setting the prices. So the
fight was lost and the girls went back to
work. It was all they could do.

Australia, but gave it up and came here
to be cured of a cancer. She has been
going from one specialist to mother lor
the last eight months, but as they did
her no good she gave up in despair and
attempted to end her own life.
The steamer San Jose arrived from
Central American ports yesterday. Her
officers report that another revolution is
brewing in Guatemala. A large quantity
Of arms and ammunition was sent from
San Jose de Guatemala to Champerlco
and an outburst was expected at any
time. The election of President takes
place on August G ami the aspirants for
the honor are acting President Cabrera
and Generals Castillo and Fuentes.
When the steamer left San Jose.it was
thought that Fuentes would withdraw
in favor of Cabrera and that the latter
would be elected. This would put Fuentes
also in power, and in that event he says
he v.- ill pay his respeots to Consul Carrillo
of this city. It will be remembered that
when Fuentea was a refugees in San
Francisco he and Carrillo were very bud
friends.
Augustine Glassier, while hurrying to
the ferries yesterday, was struck by a
Market-street car and knocked down,
lie was badly bruised and was removed
to the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Stafford attended to his wounds.
THE STATE'S INTEREST!
Board of Trade Wants to Get Into the
Ferry Building.
The State Board of Trade has consider- i
able legitimate curiosity to know when
It will be able to get Into its new quarters
in the ferry building. A long time ago ar
rangements were made for quarters In the
second story for the exhibit of the board j
and for th<: mineral exhibit of the State I
Mining Bureau, and the time set for these !
bodies to move into their rooms has long
since expired, owing to the fact that the |
work on the big building lias progressed
about as slowly as the contractors could
make it. At a meeting of the Board of
Trade yesterday a committee was ap
pointed to interview the members of the |
State Board of Harbor Commissioners and
learn If possible how soon thÂ« quarters ;
i would be ready. A part of the Hoard of ;
Trade's exhibit Is now hidden away In the
Mechanics" Pavilion, where it has been
since the mining- fair, which closed months
ago. It is one of the finest exhibits ever ;
gathered and the members of the board
feel that no time should be lost in glvin?
the public an opportunity u> inspect It.
Several years ago C. J. Murphy of lowa
\v:is appointed as a special foreign com
missioner to Introduce the products of the
States of the I'nion into foreign roun
1 tries. S>> successful was he that he in
; duced an increase in the exportation of
Indian corn from one hundred to two hun
dred million bushels per annum. His work
along the lines of other product* was
equally meritorious. Now his term is
about to expire and an effort Is being
made by the larger commercial bodies of i
the United States to secure his reap
polntment. The Chamber of Commerce of
this city and the Board of Trade have
been asked to give him their support and .
j the latter body yesterday gave him Its
j hearty Indorsement. Manager J. A. Fil
i clur was granted a vacation of ten days.

RAIN LEAKS FROM THE ROOF
LAST INVALID RAT DIED YEARS

Recorder Glynn Calls Attention to
Dirt and an Annual Deficit
Which Will Go On.
Forever.
Recorder Glynn has called the attention
of the Supervisor? to that standing ahame
In brick and mortar known as the Hall of
Records.
In his annual report filed with the clerk
of the board yesterday he spoke of the
dirty and dilapidated condition of the
l.ui!ding In which the most important rec
ords of the city are stored, gathering mel
lowness and mildew as the years go by.
It is recorded among other things on li!e
in the hullding that the last rat died un- j
der the floor of pneumonia and green mold
five years ago. Mr. <;iynn begins his re
port very mildly, but he throws off the i
chill as he proceeds.
"This building lias never been cleaned or
rf-pairc-d since the .Ly the builders fin
ished work on it, over twenty years ago,"
)i': began. "The ] â â¢.-:- cracked and in ;

CONSULTING A WOMAN,
Mrs. Pinkham's Advice Inspires
Confidence and Hope.
Examination by a male physician is
a hard trial to a delicately organized
â woman.
She puts it off as long as she dare,
and is only driven to it by fear of can-
cer, polypus, or some dreadful ill.
*": Most frequently such a woman leaves
/.â¢'"Cv a physician's office
/Raiz&fir v whore she has un-
flÃ&aS* i* Rt dergone a critical
CKptT A-JI examination with
jjtjg ~?I an impression, more
/JiiSggggr or less, of discour-
&*^gnffÂ£ ''%Â£ y*P~~^ agement.
f<: Â« V^V This condi-
â  â 
minddestroys
~'\ the effect of
Wlm^&%}Wm adrice and
j Â£?Â£s? she grows
t'CSi worse rather
than better. In consulting Mrs. Pink-
ham no hesitation need be felt, the
story is told to a woman and is wholly
Idential. Mrs. Pinkham's address
is Lynn, Mass., she offers sick women
her advice without charge.
Tier intimate knowledge of women's
troubles makes her letter of advice a
wellspring of hope, and her wide experi-
ence and skill point the way to health.
" I suffered with ovarian trouble for
Eevcn years, and no doctor knew what
Was the matter with me. I had spells
which would last for two days or more.
I thought I would try Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Comnound. I have
â¢ taken seven bottles of it, and am en-
C tirely cured."â Josor Fokemax, 26
N. Woodberry Aye., Baltimore, Md.
The above letter from Mrs- Foreman
is only one of thousands.
! many places has fallen under the dome. i
The cement coating on the ext< r is
wi m away and is broken so much that
the rains c ime in."
Then he goes on to speak of "the filthy
and unwholesome odors that emanate
i from the worn out and broken hot air yen
; tilators, which are a constant menace to
! the health of 1 he â¢ mi loyes of ''â¢..- public."
i To cap the climax, "the walls are dark
i with the duat and grime of years' stand-
Ing; and in such places a? ire withou the
r. itch of janitors and can only be reme
died by scaffolding and ainters."
But dirt Is not all the evil, for the report
makes the surprh but truthful asser
tion that 'there i e no method provided for
lighting the building on dark, cloudy daj a
and no means of hf-ating it during cold
weather. The Recorder's private rnce is
no tter that the rest of the building, be
ing stuffy from the presence of the dirty
and Id threadbare carpet that has seen
j years of service and the broken and ill
smelling ventilator that emits foul odors
and Bteam In clouds when an attempt ia
made to heat the room by means of it,
and the dirty walls and dilapidated cur- ;
tains."
According to the -report the building is
not only dirty, but it has a deficit of SS3OO
j for the fiscal year just ended. The Record
er explains In italicized rhetoric that this
deficit is the outcome of the first full
year's work under the provisions of the
county feo bill. He says that aa the

SUPERVISORS ARE
PLANNING A COUP
MAY SURPRISE THE COUNTY
ASSESSOR.
How Mr. Dalton's Record in Not Tax
ing the Water Front May-
Prove a Boomerang.
OAKLAND. July 12.-The Supervisors
â  to spring a surprise on the County
A.-.- Bsor In a day or two.
The new assessment is being approved
by the friends of the Assessor largely on
the ground that he has placed the water
front property upon the roll. Thu Super
rs declare that the property should
.â¢i taken off the roll and
that the county has bc-en deprived â¢! thr<
taxation of the property by the un
warranted action of the Assessor.
The Supervisors as a county board of
n cannot collect taxes under
th< law for any period further back than
ear, and this they intend to do.
This will add many thousands of dollars
to the county's Income: Will H. Hawkett
wan put to work by the Supervisors to
day making a list of all the pieces <if
water fn>nt property that have es< aped
taxation since Assessor Dalton took of-
When the list is complete a resolu
tion will be introduced authorizing the
collection of taxes for the year lv.'iT.
When ex-Assessor Lsckie was in office
hf always assessed the water front, and
taxes have been paid on it for over thirty
years. The present Assessor struck it
from the rolis on the ground that it be
longed to the city, and kept it off for three
y.-ars. The decision of the- Supreme
Court rendered a year ago made it plain
that the property was largely owned by
the water front company, and this year
it is again assessed for $6007000.

TWELVE-YEAR-OLD LAD
CHARGED WITH LARCENY
Assisted in Stealing Two Cows Be
longing to a Poor San Rafael
Woman.
SAN RAFAEL. July 12. - Howard
Boster, a lad only 12 years old, was
lodged behind the bars of the County Jail
i to-night with a charge of grand larceny
I against his name. Little Howard lives on
Pennsylvania avenue in South San Fran
; cisco, his father being night watchman in
I a sugar refinery. A few weeks ago the
boy came to San Rafael to visit his
I cousin, Mrs. Edward Butterworth. a poor
j woman who obtains a livelihood by sell
: ing milk. She had peveral cows, two of
I a particularly fine breed being picketed
together in a pasture.
The boy went back to the city and there
: met a young fellow namrd William Mc-
Carthy, living at 529 Flllmore street, to
whom he mentioned his cousin's cows.
j The lad says McCarthy at once stated !
i that he would steal the cows and agreed
that Howard should return to San Rafael
and tell him wlu-re they were. The plan
i was carried out. He was given 25 cents
to keep still about it.
This was three weeks ago. The hoy â 
acted peculiarly aft^r the cows disap- ,
; peared, and to-day the constable Bwore
| out a warrant for his arrest on a charge
of grand larceny and brought him here
from the metropolis. In his cell the
youngster seemed not to care for his ar- :
rest in the least. He related the story of
his crime very coolly and refused to say :
where the cows are now.
CHINESE RIOTS ASSUME
GRAVP PROPORTIONS
Several Cities in the Hands of the
Rebels â Hurrying Troops to
the Scenes.
LONDON, July 13.â According to a
dispatch to the Times from Wu Chau Fu
the rebellion in that district of China is i
assuming serious proportions. The cities
of Yung Shien, Pc Lien and llu Chuan
have fallen. The Triad Society is con
cerned in the movement. Troops are be-
Ing forwarded to the scenes of the dis- '
turbances.
A special dispatch from Shanghai says:
The leaders of the rebellion in the West
River region are men recently returned
from America. It is believed that the i
rising is a revival of the Taiping move- ;
ment, as the rebels carry Taiping ban- i
r.ers.
The Times, commenting 1 upon the dis
turi/.-irices in the West River district of
China, says: The rising Is of a moment
ous character, If the Triads who are
largely responsible for the great Taiping
rebellion retain their old vitality.

Humors of Impending Rebellion in
Central America Anticipating
the Presidential Elec
tion of August 6.
With the arrival of the Paclflo Mail
steamer from Central American ports
yesterday came rumors of impending re
bellion in the republic of Guatemala,
which has for years been the hotbed of
political intrigue.
The election for President of the repub
lic takes place on August 6, and the cam- ;
paign is being fought desperately by the
incumbent, President Cabrerra, and by
General Castellio. General Fuentes, who
left here but a short time since, is also
said to be a candidate. Cabrerra is
thought to have the best chances in the
elec tion.
He is not the most popular man with
the masses, as he is regarded as a. secnd I
Barrius, under whom he served as Vice
President, and whose policy of adminis
tration he has followed. His chances are
enhanced, as he has been promised, it is
affirmed, the support of General Fuentes,
which will Vie sufficient to turn the elec
tion in his favor.
Fuentes, ac-curding to his friends is
bitter against Consul Carrillo, who rep
resents Guatemala in this city. He is
: credited with the use of the folluwing
sizzling language:
"Tell that man Carrillo to beware, for
I am after him. Until 1 returned here I
did not appreciate tne full extent of the
injury he had expected to do me among
my people. But 1 will repay him as only
a soldier can. I predict that he will soon
be removed from his position in San
Francisco, and with his removal I pur
pose to destroy the influence of his busi
ness associates, who have so long wielded
such a power here and disgraced us \
abroad."
Fuentes declares that he is in a position
to demand hiuch consideration from Ca- ;
brerra. He intimates that his support in
I the Impending election will only be given
I upon certain conditions. One of these
1 will be. he says, the removal fr"rn office
of Carrillo. The latter does not fear the
power of Fuentes.
"There is no outbreak, no revolution in
Guatemala," said Consul Miguel Carr^o
last night. "Everything is quiet dov.'n
: there and all those stut'-ments are false
: and originate right here in this city. They
: are made by scoundrels who have been
trying to make trouble for me for a long
! time. They are men who seek my posi
tion and are doing everything to have me
removed.
"1 have no news regarding Fuentes. I
see no mention made of him as a candi- ;
date for the presidency. The only names
mentioned are those of Cabrerra. who has i
held the offi>e since the death of Barrios,
and General Castiuio. Up to the time the
: steamer left there had been no disturb
ances, no signs of a political uprising or
rebellion. It Is all nonsense; stupid:
"About every fortnight an attack of this
' character is launched at me, but it never
amounts to anything. I often met Fuen
, tes when he was h^re, but he never at
tacked me then. He dare not; nor would '
i I permit any man to do so. Ts'ow he is far
, away, perhaps he says these things.
'â \Vhy did he not say them in my pres
: enoe?
"They surely originate with scoundrels
in this city and I do not fear them nor
rare what they say. I would be informed
if Guatemala was again on the verge of
rebellion, so I say there is no truth in the
; story." _^_^___________
CLAIMS AN EIGHTH
OF ALL SAN RAFAEL
Duncan McNee Files Suit for Posses
sion of a Strip of Land in
the Marin Town.
SAX RAFAEL. July 12.-Duncan Mc-
Nee, who signs himself "secretary of the
Collateral Savings Union, of San Fran
dsco," late this afternoon filed a suit
that, if won. would give him possession of
about one-eighth of the whole town prop
erty, roughly valued at $100,000.
In 1873 the United States Congress gave
Judge A.my in trust for the citizens of
San Rafael a tract of land known as the
San Rafael Township site. South of this
was the Ranclio Punta de Quentin and
State tide lands. Between this rtincho
and the township site the surveyors in
laying off the land, left a strip about 300
feet wide and a mile long. A great many
people settled on this, some having occu
pied it for thirty-five years.
McNee now claims this property and
asks the court to eject all the occupants
now in possession. His suit Involves the
Northern Pacific Coast Railway depot and
the right of way for a considerable dis
tance of its track, the land nwnwl l>y the
Hanson & Lund Lumber Company, the
property of City Trustee William Magee,
all of Mrs. Catherine Magnln's cottages
and the houses and lots of Joseph Hoxie,
L. Smith, William Mulcahey and about
fifty other well-known citizens.
PROBABLY FATAL FALL
OVER A PRECIPICE
San Francisco Society Young Woman
Hurled From a Cliff Near
Sausalito.
SAUSALITO. July 12.â Miss Julia Taut
phaus of 1539 California street fell a dis
tance of forty feet over a cliff last even-
Ing, striking on the jagged rocks lining

of Torpedo station yesterday. A few
were sitting on a log near the edge of
a precipice, when in some manner the log
tilted and threw the unfortunate girl over
the cliff, t.ie lay unconscious on the
rocks beneath until the screams of her
companions attracted some fishermen to
the scene. With the assistance of several
gentlemen of the party they rescued the i
insensible girl from her perilous position.
Dr, Mays was summoned. An examina
tion showed that Miss Tautphaus had
sustained the fracture of a rib and many
contusions, and was perTiaps injured in
ternally. She was taken to Mrs. Miles'
house. Her left side Is wholly paralyzed.

floating docks, the two to cost not exceed
ing $250,000, as recently provided by Con
gress. Chief Endicott of the Bureau of ,

will be secured under the bids asked to

necessary to build the structures.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW rORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July There was a notable
disparity again in tht> activity ol the bond
and slock market, the volume of transactions
in the bond market tlnuing in a very large
tw-alp while the stock market was dull through- !
out. In ihe early trading Alchison preferred j
continued conspicuous. The buying was at I
tributed to the same interest which took this j
stock yesterday. There was no purpose to ad- I
vance the stock, but all offerings were well
absorbed. London sold quite heavily ol this
ptock and a few others ight ther inter
national stocks. The buj g of th< Atchison
adjustments continued u.s confidently or.d as
aggressively as yesterday and led the very
noiable action in the b.ind movement. The
price sold \ off from the top on traders realiz
ing, but the buyli movement maintained Us
force at ihe decline. The demand for Atchi
gon preferred diminished before the close, thus
removing the only movement of positive i
strength in the stock list, which dropped on a
small volume of business. The declines wen â¢
most conspicuous in the st ka which were I
advanced under manipulation last week, nota- I
b:y Omaha and Northwest. There Is an effor
to explain the diversion of speculative activity ;
from the st ck market Inl the â  nd market
on the ground that the new revenue law pro- I
vides no tax on the sale of bunds although
stock sales are taxed it the rate of $2 per
hundred shnres. This small tax does In fact
loom up large in the eyes of the professional
traders who buy and seil stocks for a small
fractional turn on the floor of the exchange.
Hut thl class of transactions Lkes ui> but
a small proportion of the total in an active
market. A movement in bonds upon which
Interest payments are contingent upon earn- ;

that have claims ahead.

that exporters had taken over 300,000 bushels

This, together with heavy foreign market.*,

GRECIAN CURRANTS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK. July 12. -The Journal of Com-
Bays: The limited demand for Grecian
currents for some weeks past, although n.H
â¢ 1 at this season of the year. Is having
a depressing effect upon the market. A re
cent arrival via Liverpool came on a dull
market, and In order to move the Btock Into
nsumptlon the Importers were compelled to
make concessions. The lower prices named,
however, do not seem f> have stimulated the
demand, and this Is partly accounted for by the
activity of sellers of small Beedless California
ralÃlns which product, owing to the compara
tively low prices at which U Is offered has.
It Is asserted, been taking the place of currnjits
to a considerable extent amonn consumers In
distributing centers on the Atlantic coast.

values for dried fruits will probably rango i
higher this year in consequence. This bullish

short crop In California, so the outlook for a

A local circular for Australia says: "There
are thirteen vessels now en route from Aus
tralia with over 33,000 tons of coal which should ]
arrive here prior to September next. There are )
forty-three vessels already chartered to carry j
coal from Sydney and Newcastle with a ca- i 3
paclty or' about 115,000 tons; some of these will
not leave for several months yet. It can be
safely figured that over 00 per cent of the above
mentioned coal has already passed out of first
hands. The last quoted lrelght rates from New
castle are about 20s to 21s per ton for loading
in July-August, and 19s for November-Decem
ber. There are not many buyers locally for
Australian at present covering prices, as our
large consumers will substitute other grades at
lower figures. The brisk demand for tonnage i
to Honolulu for coal for the navy has aided I
to sustain ruling rates for here, but this de- :
mand will necessarily diminish In the near
future. A continuance of high figures for
steam grades will force some of our large con
sumers to utilize oil as a fuel."

A little oro-wd of less than a hundred
people listened this morning on the coun

wheel from the Trestle Glen camp meet
ing to his home In San Jose.
While getting out of the way of an elec
tric car on the Haywards road Werner
rode into a hole filled with stones, was
thrown over his wheel in front of the
car and instantly killed.
As soon as the dead man's companion
r^all-ed what had happened he lifted the
broken corpse away from the track
kneeling over it, prayed fervently, while
the crowd gathered around. Rising from
his knees and while waiting for

Central Christian Church
Going to Pieces.
REV. MR. DAVIS WAS SHREWD
ELDER WISHART HAD HOPES OF
GETTING SOME MONEY.
Thirty Prominent Members Hand in
Their Resignations and There
Are Only a Few Left.
Have No Pastor.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 32.
The Central Christian church is faat
going to piecÂ«s and before many weeks
it is believed the two Christian organ
izations will have united. At last Sun
day's meeting thirty resignations were
handed in, including those of Mrs. Ada
Van Felt, Mrs. M. D. Gracey and Airs.
Laura Hitter.
The congregation is not at all eatislled
with the manner in which Rev. Edwards
Davis was received back into the fold.
They have been Investigating and are con
vinced that there was a little political
worK done, of which they were unaware.
They have satisfied themselves that the
letter of commendation approved by the
church was written by Rev. Mr. Davis
himself, a_nd that he secured Its accept
ance and indorsement In a manner they
do not approve.
The minister is under obligations to
some of the officers of the church. One
Of these is Elder Wishart, who holds a
.gainst the ex-pastor. Mr. Davis
was pressed to pay the notes, but dm not
respond to the pressure. He gave Elder
Wishari some encouragement on condi
tion that Wishurt should help him to
square himself with his indignant con
gregation. Elder Wishart presented the
self- written commendation of the pastor
â¢ it was the duty of the
church to accept it unanimously, and this
whs done.
Now, many of these who voted to take
the pasti r lad; Into the fold regret their
action and are resigning. The church
at present is without a pastor, the last
_ left because It w.-is found Im-
K. ep up his salary. No ef
forts arc being made to secure his suc
r, and at thi present rate of do
â  the congregation will soon be a

The First ( luistian Church, of which
Rev P. D. Butler is pastor, has already

pearances the much-talked-of union ho

chun hea will come aijout independently
of any actual move tc secure it.
A DAVIS MEETING.
Gathering of Friends of the Guberna
torial Candidate Last Night.
ALAMEDA, July 12. â There wa.< a meet
ing of friends of W. H. Davis at Linder

Among those in attendance wer^: Colonel
Babcock, a candidate for Congress; Post

Haskell, John Meyer, George E. Clark, w.

Mr. Davis himself. It was reported that
were eighty-three members on the
roll and membership cards were still be-
Irculated. A public meeting will
be called for the purpose of indorsing
andidacy of Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis
said thai it was time to take action with
regard t<> th>- coming primaries. He
thought it was a mistake to put the most
active men :\t the polls at such a time.
They were needed on tho outside.
"From all the indications," said Mr.
Davis, "there is no doubt as to what the
result will be if we do not have primaries
at which itinerants. Populists and Demo
crats vote.'' It was decided to endeavor
to have the hour for closing the polls at
tii" primaries extended to 8 p. m., as on
former occasions many voters had been
unable to cast their ballots because of the
r closing.

THE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 13, 1898.
LIQUOR WAR
IS PROMISED
Brosnahan May Decide
the License.
CHURCH PARTY TO FIGHT
WILL AFFECT THE TAX LEVY TO
BE FIXED IN OCTOBER.
Dr. E. S. chapman Will Lead the Op
position Against Any Reduc
tion in the Present
Figure.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 12.
The ordinance Introduced Into the City
Council last nip;ht reducing the munici
pal liquor license from $100 to $50 has once
more aroused the periodical struggle be
tween the two pre.'it parties In this city
known as the church party and the sa
loon party. The measure will be bitterly
contested and there is no doubt that its
Introduction at this time Is for the pur
pose of putting the members of the
Council on record. It Is not certain how
the measure will be received by tho
Council. The members are about equally
divided, and this Is most decidedly a fac
tional measure.
Earl, Henr.eberry, Watkinson, Wood
ward and Heitman can almost be de
pended upon to support the measure.
Pringle, Rowe, Upton, Cuvellier and Gi
rard can about as certainly be relied upon
to oppose it.
This leaves the matter entirely in the
hands of Brosnahan. A few months ago
Brosnahan introduced an ordinance grad
ing the license, and requiring ll<iuor deal
ers who conducted both a wholesale and
retail business to pay more than the lit
tle saloon men at Golden Gate. This or
dinance was ridiculed by nearly every
member <>f the Council and Brosnahan
eventually withdrew it. He then openly
dei lared ho would b^ revenged on some
of those who would not vote for his meas
ure, and then changed his vote on the
water ordinance, enabling the extortion
ate Woodward ordinance to prevail.
Brosnahan stated at that time that he
would never again take a hand in "mon
keying" with the license question, and
when the Honneberry ordinance comes up
for final passage Bro.snahan's vote may
its fate.
The anti-saloon element is already or
ganizing for the next city campaign,
which follows dose after the county cam
paign in November. At the special elec
tion a year ago, to determine th<- ques
tion of whether Oakland should have sa
loons or not. the saloon men carried the
day, but not by a majority so large as
tney expected. It was contended by the
anti-Baloon party at that time that with
proper organization they could have won.
Since then Dr. E. S. Chapman has opened
up a vigorous anti-saloon State campaign,
with headquarters in Oakland.
A large lx^rt i< >n of the city's revenue
is derived from saloon licenses, and the
reduction of the tax will materially af
feci the tax levy to be fixed by the City
Council In a couple of months.
BERKELEY GRADUATES.
University of California Students in
Demand for High School Posi
tions.
BERKELEY. July 12.â The department
of pedagogy In the University of Califor
nia lias been uniformly successful thia
year in supplying teachers for vacancies

close the fact that Berkeley students are

Btructors. Within the last two days the
following appointments have been re
ported:

principal of the Oroville High School.
Miss Georgia Reed, .class of '93, as

A RETURN COMPLIMENT.
Berkeley People to Buy Flags for the
New Ferry-Boat.
BERKELEY, July 12.â J. W. Richards,
I president of the Board of Trustees, thinks
that the action of the Southern Pacific
j Railway Company in calling its new ferry
j steamer the "Berkeley" should not be al
! lowed to go unappreciated by the resi
\ dents of the town. At the meeting of the
; Board of Trustees held last night he took
occasion to suggest a way in which the
| compliment might 'be returned. Presi
; dent Richards said he thought that the
j citizens of Berkeley should purchase v
set of flags for the new steamer. A public
subscription ought to he raised sufficient
i to make the present a handsome one. The
! trustees agreed that although no official
I move could be taken in the matter, they
I would further the movement as much as
! possible. Several of the leading citizens
i are known to have expressed themselves
I as thoroughly in favor with the plan and
! there seems little doubt that it will soon
j be carried out.
Newspapers Combined.

BUILDER DAHLBERG
MADE A MISTAKE
WOULD LOSE MONEY ON AN
ENGINE HOUSE.
He Asked the Fire and Water Com
mittee to Release Him From
His Contract.
E. Dahlbcrg 1 , contraotor, appeared be
fore the Fire and Water Committee of the
Supervisors yesterday and voicpd his re
gret at having boon declared the lowest
bidder for the construction of an engine
house at Holly Park. At the labt meet
ing of the board he had put in a bid of
$5881, the next highest bid being that of
J. H. McKay, who offered to do the work
for $i;2'.)5. a difference of $414. The contract
was awarded to Dahlberg and after the
first flush of joy had passed away and he
had had a sleep over it, he ruminated over
the $414 difference in the two lowest hi.]*,
and was repentant. He informed the com
mittee that he had made a mistake in fig
uring on the lumber and that if the board
should hold him to his contract he would
lose more than $600. He asked the com
mittee to release him from his contract or
to arrange some way by which he could
do the work without incurring the loss of
so much money.
Clerk Russell informed him that Super
ior Judge Seawell had ruled recently that
contracts must be awarded to the lowest
bidders and that th^y must be held on
their bonds for the faithful performance
of the work.
Contractor Dahlberp went his way after
promising to state his case In a communi
cation to the board.

OBJECTION TO
THE NEW TAX
A Big Protest Made by
Restaurant Keepers.
APPEALED TO WASHINGTON
CANNOT AFFORD TO PUT STAMP j
ON EACH BOTTLE.
It Is Claimed That a Rigid Enforce- j
ment of the Law Would
Mean Bankruptcy
to Many.
The restaurant keepers of this city, who j
have been in the custom of furnishing a j
bottle of cheap wine with each meal In
place of tea or coffee are protesting j
agalns the new stamp law. A meeting
waa held last week and Revenue Uroker
Youngberg was requested to draw up a
petition to be forwarded at once to Wash
ington. The paper, which bears the signa
ture of almost every deuler in the city, is
as follows:
SAX FRANCISCO. July 12, IS9S.
Hon. N. B. .Scott. Commissioner Internal
Kevenue, Washington, I). Dear Sir: We,
the undersigned, hereby petition that a rulu^
be made by the l>epartment of Internal Reve
nue, which will relieve us from tho require
ment of placing one and two cent stamps on
pint an.l quart bottles ot wine used by us as
Stated herein.
The law reads ns follows:
"Sparkling or other wines, when bottled for
nale. upon each bottle containing one pint or
less, one cent; u:>on each bottle containing
"re than one pint, two cents. â¢ â¢ â¢ It shall
be deemed n. compliance with this act, ns t<
Euch articles on hand in the hands of whole-
Bale or retail dealers ns aforesaid â¢ â¢ â¢ t<
artix the proper adhesive tnx stamp at the time
the packet, box, bottle, pot, phial or other ln
closure with it* contents is sold at retail."
We are held to I"- retail liquor dealers, under
the rules of the department, and pay an annual
tax of twenty. five dollars. The majority 01
Flgners hereto aie in fact boardlnp-house ami
restaurant keepers, whose business It Is to fur
nish meals to those who apply.
Am"!-.K other articles we nrv compelled to pro
vide with such meal is the Item of corfee, wine
or beer, as may be desired by the customer
No extra charge is ma.le where the diner calls
for wine or beer in place of coftVe. The de- I
partment, however, charges and collects S2. r . a 1a 1
year from us for the privilege of furnishing
wine or beer, although we cannot charge for .
the same and are tnerefore mulcted In that j
amount annually.
The wine we furnish, ns a rule, haa beon i
purchased by the barrel at the low price of I
from 10 cents to IS cents per gallon, but Is i
pure California wine made from the ordinary
grapeÃ and is classed as "yin ordinaire." The .
bottles are of the Bize that takes live to one
gallon. If the tax of two cents Is Imposed on
each bottle, it would cost 10 cents extra per
gallon, or from ''â â¢ to 100 per cent Increase of
cost to us, without any compensation whatever
and with no margin of profit from which to i
stand the Increase of tax.
( >ur custom has been to place a quart bottle i
before the customer from which he can fill his
glass and dilute the wine with water. The
glass is refilled with wine and diluted with
water from time to time, during the meal, as .
may suit the customer. Whatever Is left in
the bottle remains clean and uncontamlnated,
and the bottle can be refilled from other par
tially filled bottles, and from the barrel, if the
contents are fresh. Wine is of such chemical
composition that all packages must be kept
full, and the air excluded or else the content
turn F"iir and become unfit for use.
Furthermore^ unless the wine is covered,
dust, flies and othe forelcn matter become
Incorporated with the wine, spoiling the same
and rendering It of no value. The law requir
ing stamps on bottles, we now claim does not
apply to the undersigned restaurateurs for the
following reasons:
The law states that "'wines when bottled for
pale" â¢ â¢ â¢ shall be subject to the stamp
tax. The wines in question in this argument
were not and are not "bottled for sale" unde
the meaning and intent of the law, and there
fore are not liable to the stamp tnx. What is
the meaning of the term "bottled for sale"?
The intention of Congress must be limited and
denned by commercial usage and by the prac
tice "f the trade.
Under commercial usage "wines bottled fo
sale" are those which are bottled In large or
email wine cellars or by manufacturers, in
which the wine so bottled has been blended, clari
fied and aged, which is the only class of wine
that can be bottled. The bottle when fille.
with this commercial wine is tightly corke<
by corks driven in by machine pressure, the
bottle is handsomely labeled, the corks prop
erly sealed and capped. It is then wrapped in
tissue paper, inclosed In straw wrapper an
then finally cased In wooden boxes which are
nailed, wired and properly fastened. Whrn
this is done It becomes, under the commercial
terms and usages, "wines bottled for sale."
This Is the class of bottles that without any
doubt was intended to be etamr>ed with the
Etamps specified In the law.
The argument holds good even In the case
Of very small manufacturers or small bottlers
from the fact that every bottle of wine bottle
for sale, by the large or small dealer. Is pre
pared as above stated: except in some instance
the bottles are placed on shelves for sale, and
not Inclosed in the wooden boxes called "win
cases." The argument also holds good whe
considered in the light of the proviso, which
Etates "that it shall be deemed a compllanc
â with this act as to such articles on hand In
the hands of the wholesale or retail deale
â¦ â¢ â¢ to affix th" proper adhesive stamp a
the time â¢ â¢ â¢ the bottle, pot or other ln
closure with it? contents Is sold at retail."
Under a str:<-t Interpretation of this proviso,
as included in the law. no bottle of wine Is
liable to the stamp tax until such bottle and
contents are Bold at retail. If the bottle and !
contents are not sold and disposed of then
there can bÂ» no liability to stamp tax. The
bottle as a bottle Is not liable to the stamp
tax. The wine as a wine (as in bulk Is not
liable to the Ftamp tax; nor is the wine when
placed in a bottle (pints or quarts) and not
Bold at retail liable to such Ftamp tax. The
wtne may be bottled by any person, and used
by himself, his family or his visitors, without ;
being liable to stamp tax. The essential act, ;
therefore. Is a sale of the "bottle and con
tents at retail" before such liability accrues. I
We. therefore, who almply place a bottle
filled with wine upon the table for the boarder
or dln'-r to take a drink, without labels, with
out wrapping and only lightly corked by hand,
have not "bottled that wine for sale," nor
have we "sold the bottle or its contents at re
. tall," and cannot under the law, unless it be !
by the most arbitrary and forced construction,
be held liable to the tax and compelled to stamp
euch bottles.
Furthermore, when we place a bottle of wine
before a customer he may only use a part of
the contents of such bottle. In fact, It would
be an exceptional case where even half of the j
bottle was used. Heretofore the bottle could
be Immediately refilled from other similar bot- '
tles Hnd no loss would be suffered by us. If the
bottles were liable to tax and compelled to
bear a stamp, we would be debarred from the
right of refilling such stamped bottle, and the
entire quantity would thus be lost to us.
This would break up our business and com- ]
pel us to refuse to serve wine with meals.
This would probably bankrupt nearly all the I
restaurants of this class and cause an Incon- !
ceivable amount of suffering to ourselves, our ;
families and our hired help, reducing all to
abject poverty. Nor would the Government '
receive any benefit from such an enforcement
of an arbitrary rule. No wine being used, no
tax could be collected: but even greater loss
to the Government would follow from the fact
that If we are forced out of business the Gov
ernment would also suffer the loss of $23 per |
annum which we are now compelled to pay for
the privilege of riving our California wine i
away with the meals.
The wine industry of the State would receive
a blow that It would be hard to overcome. ThÂ»
large quantity of ordinary wines are consumed
In the restaurants and boarding houses, and
by them only. Tlemove this source of consump
tion and the demand for this class of wines
would entirely disappear. The vineyards as
well as the wine merchants derive their revenue
from this class of wine, an it forms the great
bulk of production. In fact, some markets de- ,
mand no othÂ»r kind. The poor people of all
large cities, New York, Chicago and othÂ»m.
use no other kind, as their means will not per- j
mlt the purchnse of any choice grade or high
priced wine.
The rule that holds good In San Francisco i
would be the rule Jn all cities and large towns
where cheaper restaurants cater to the wants
of citizens of only moderate means, and who
furnish ordinary but perfectly pure, whole- |
Borne wine at meals to the lahorlng class of
castomer*. The loss to the Government In the
non-renewal of the, $25 special tax would
amount to an enormous sum annually.
It may be rlalmed thnt 1 or 2 cents on each
bottle Ik bo small that it could not affect the
trade as herein claimed. It is true that 2 centH
Is not a large sum in Itself, but the tax
amounts to a large sum In the aggregate.
There .ire five so-called qunrt bottles to a gal
lon, nn<l nbout fifty gallrns to a barrel. This
would be a tax of 2 cents each on 2VI bottles,
or $."â  to each barrel. This class of wine is now
Felling at New Orleans nt 13 cents per gallon,'!
or $C r,O per barrel. The tax. therefore, would
be almost double the present price to the poor
reptnurnnt keeper. Many of these men furnish
meals nt from 15 cents to 2.", cents each, wine
included. It Is therefore plain to he j>een that
the mnrgln of profit must bÂ» very small, nnd
the extra expense will be almost if not quite
prohibitory- .'" â¢ â -â¢ '-
As before stated, the loss Is not only In the
extra tnx, but also In the loss, occasioned by
thÂ» wnste of wine, ns no Government officer
.would permit us to refill a partially emptied
. bottle from others, nor could we set a partially
filled bottle before our customers. The cus
tomer would feel Insulted 1 having the so
called remnants placed before him, and we
would thus either lose the patronage of Buch
mm or we must lose the remainder of each
bottle of wine. .
Therefore, from thÂ» evident Intent of the law
as passed by Congress, nnd from the commer
cial usage as to classification of wlnos bottled
for sale and of bottles and contents sold at re
tail, we think you are not only Justified in
ruling thut our ordinary wine. In loosely
stopped bottles, not prepared for sale In the
markets of the world, are not taxable: but we
Rii further, and state thnt.we believe that any
other ruling would he contrary to the spirit
and plain intention of the law.
We claim further that the loss that must fol
low any ruling that this kind of wine and
temporary inclosure must be stamped, would
be contrary to the good of the Government,
from the great loss In revenue that must re
sult in the retirement from business of hun
dreds of restaurant keepers and consequent
lon in the present payment of special taxes.
We therefore respectfully request that a rul
lnc as petitioned for herein be granted, and
notice Bent to Collector John C. Lynch without
delay.

THE SAtf FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 13, 1898.
RAN AMUCK ON THE WATER FRONT
Oscar Pile, a Hilarious Soldier, Uses His Guns on
Police and Civilians.
Armed with two large revolvers and weighted down with a good load of
fighting Whisky, Oscar P. Pile, a private in Company A of the Sixth Cali
fornia Regiment, essayed to run the waterfront last evening and was
quite successful in the attempt for a time. He was finally rounded up by
Officers Dower and Bailey before he had done any more damage than badly
frighten a number of people and inflict a slight gunshot wound in the right
hand of Charles J. Johnson, a barkeeper at 231 East street.
The police say Pile had been sent to the city from Alcatraz with a corpo
ral's guard to hunt up some of the boys who were missing from the regi
ment He soon wearied of the work assigned him and dropping from the
squad began to enjoy himself. By evening he was in a condition to
imagine that he could run the entire city and started in on the waterfront.
Complaints were made at the Harbor Station that a drunken soldier was
running amuck, Insulting ladies, frightening children and bluffing men with
his guns.
Officers Dower and Bailey learned of the trouble and went in search of
the soldier. After some search they found him and in doing so made them
selves targets for his bullets and consider themsolves fortunate that they
were not killed. Directed by a woman whom Pile had threatened the offi
cers wont Into a yard in the rear of a saloon at 2.'!1 East street. They entered
from Oregon street and had no sooner opened the gate than Pile opened tire
on them sending two bullets in their direction. As he Hred.the soldier retreat
ed toward the door of the saloon, which he entered and then opened fire on
the inmates. The customers beat a hasty retreat, but the barkeeper, Ander
son, went to the assistance of the police who had bravely followed the sol
dier. The officers seized Pile by the hands and disarmed him and in the
scuffle which ensued one of the pistols was discharged, the ball taking effect
in Anderson's right hand.
The soldier was finally subdued, disarmed and taken to the Harbor Sta
tion, where he was charged with assault to commit murder. The weapons
by the aid of which he sought to take charge of the city were a .38 Iver-
Jobnson hammerless and a .45 Smith and Wesson about fourteen inches long.
He carried them in holsters attached to a belt, which was filled with fifty
rounds of ammur.lt kin.
Anderson was taken to the Harbor Hospital, where his hand was dressed
by Dr. Deas. The wound, while painful, is not dangerous.
A GLIMPSE AT
REAL ESTATE
Active Business Still Ex
ceedingly Dull.
NO LARGE SALES MADE
STRIKING CONTRAST IN BUILD
ING PROGRESSION.
General Review of Records, New
Building Contracts, Recent
Sales and Other
Notes.
Progress In the real estate market is j
still slow nnd uncertain, and there ia
nothing tangible at present to base a i
prophecy of what the present stagnation '
may result in. Brokers are sanguine,
however, that after the summer months an
active business will be again renewed, as
the present season is usually the dullest i
in the year. Few, if any, sales of more ;
than passing comment have been negoti- i
ated by the large firms that control the
business of the entire market, and there ,
Is consequently, absolutely nothing to
cheer the smaller brokers, except the rent :
agency departments, which, an a rule
sustain the different firms, both large and
small, through every period of depression
or stagnation.
The mortgages and releases are In the
minority, and have been for the past two
weeks, there being no pledges exceeding
the $30,000 limit, and no releases for more
than $15,000.
Building, however, is increasing, both In
the number of contracts awarded and In
value.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.

nine mrtnm and trust deeds recorded,

UNMASKED
A MYTHICAL
PRIVATEER
A Bugaboo Started by the
Britishers for Their Own
BusiQess Ends.
The Intention Was to Scare Returning Gold
Hunters Into Taking Passage on
British Steamers.
A few days ago a story -was circu
lated to the effect that a Spanish pri
vateer was standing on and off the
coast of Vancouver Island awaiting
the arrival cf the Klondike fleet with
returning gold-hunters and their
hard-earned riches. This turns out
to be a cold-blooded fake engineered
by Commodore John Irving of the
Canadian pacific Steam Navigation
Company to divert traffic from the
American t, British steamers, and
more particularly those of his own
line. As soon as the lie wa3 pub
lished Irving secured copies of the
papers, marked the story and hurried
them off co St. Michael to meet the
returning Kiondikers.
The arrival of the steamer St. Paul
Is anxiously looked for. Friends of re
turning Klondikers besiege the Chief
"Wharfinger's office dally and their first
Inquiry always Is "Has the St. Paul got
In yet?" Frequently the question is,
"Where Is the St. Paul's berth?" and
when told the inquirer goes to section 4
of the sea wall and waits hour after
hour for the steamer that may still be
hundreds of miles from San Francisco.
"What adds to the anxiety of those hav
ing friends on the Yukon is the absurd
Btory started in Victoria, B. C, about
a Spanish privateer. According to the
passengers on the steamer "Walla
Walla that arrived from Puget Sound
yesterday it was started by Commodore
John Irving of the Canadian Pacific
Steam Navigation Company and was
done for business reasons.
In the nature of things, the Alaska
Commercial Company and the North
American Trading and Transportation
any, American concerns, being
eld and well established
and equipped, would handle the bulk
of the Klondike business. The fine
steamers, Pt. Paul and Roanoke.,
Jly for the trade, were
on their nay to Ft. Michael, and It
looked as though th? Canadian line of
nerfl was going to be left out in
the cold. Something had to be done
THREE FELLOWSHIPS
IN THE OBSERVATORY
PROFESSOK KEELER WANTS
SALARIES INCREASED.
Regents Scanning the Intellectual
Heavens for a Successor to
Astronomer Schaeberle.
Professor Keeler, the recently appointed
director of destinies at the Lick Obsrva- â 
tory, received an initial taste of the power ;
exercised by the Board of Regents yester
day. The famous star gazer allowed his â¢
attention to dwell on earthly things the
day after his arrival at Mount Hamilton | |
and feeling that the men about him de- ,
served further emoluments penned a let- i
ter to President Kellogg in which he sug-
Rested that inasmuch as the salary paid â¢,
l'r< fessor Schaoberle, the lately resigned j
member of the staff of astronomers, i
would remain idle, the amount might be
used to advantage by Increasing the sal
cry of 11. 11. Tucker to $2200 per annum,
"\V. J. Hussey's t ) $2200 and C. L>. Perrine's, \
assistant astronomer and secretary, to j
$I.V"'. the total increase over the salary |
received by Professor Schaeberle being
but $6. This he thought might be done
in recognition of the yeomen services
being performed by them. He Btated that :
at present it was diflicu'.t to find an as- â 
tronomer < t!'.'i'nt enough to take Schae- i
berle's place. He also recommended that i
three fellowships be appointed, one to re
ceive $SOO and the other two $648 each.
That some of the regents present did
not take kindly to K.eeler'B first sugges
tion was Bhown after his letter was read. ;
Regents Foote and Wallace were opposed !
.to the raise on the ground that it might;
prevent the employment of an astronomer
capable of filling Schaeberle's place. They
Btated that if the men on the mount de
served more pay it should be appropri
ated to them, but to divide the salary of
the vacant office among them and then â 
take it away again when a successor waa
appointed would be a shame. Both re- ;
gents had the greatest confidence in the
present director, but did not approve of
the plan.
President Phelps then arose and eulo- i
gized the men who were gaining fame for i
the Institution and asked that the re
commendation be acted on.
On a vote being taken the recommen
dation was lost.
Professor ]er's second suggestion,
however, went through with a slight i
modification in figures. Three fellows
were appointed at $600 each for one year.
They will probably be R. T. Crawford, F.
E. Ross and H. K. Palmer. B. F. Cod
lngton, on motion of Regent Budd, was
advanced from $4SO to the same amount.
Other matters suggested in Professor
Keeler's letter were referred to the com
mltt' c
Secretary E. W. Davis was granted a j
two weeks' leave of absence owing to ill ;
health.
Four astronomers from the observatory
â¢will deliver two lectures each during the
second half of the study year.
On recommendation of Professor Ber- I
nard Moses T. \V. Page, a professor in
Macnn College, Georgia, will be offered j
the position of assistant professor in po
litical economy at a salary of $1500 a year.
The office Is worth but $1006. but owing
to the fact that Professor Page is re
ceiving $2000 in his present position, that j
amount was offered him. Regent Halll
die raised his usual mild complaint about
a lack of funds and Regent Reinsteln, on i
behalf of Mrs. Phebe Hearst, stated that
if tho extra $500 could not be raised she '
â¢would m< i â  the amount.
Regent Dr. Powell was appointed to
make an address on behalf of the board
at the opening of the Afflllatod Colleges
building on September a.
Dr. 1.. T. Hengstler, on motion of Re
pent Slack, was given the title of assist
ant professor In jurisprudence, having i
been transferred from the department of '
mathematics.
Recorder James Sutton will at the be- i
Binning of the next fiscal year receive the i
game salary as an assistant professor.
Regent Budd called attention to the I
faulty depot in Berkeley and suggested !
that the Southern Pacific Company be I
asked to erect one suitable to the college
and Its surroundings.
Horseshoers to Compete.
The officials of the recently organized
Mechanics' Athletic Union have determin
ed to extend the Held of its operations.
Branches will be established in all the
large cities throughout the United States.
ThÂ» object for which the Union was or
ganized was to afford suitable facilities
and Commodore Irving struck on the
Idea of a cablegram. An expenditure
of $1S or }20 did tht trick, and soon the
news that a Spanish privateer
would rifle all American vessels, but
w. uld spare British steamers returning
from the gold fields, was spread over
the length and breadth of the United
States and Canada. Copies of every
newspaper in the country that con
tained the story were bought and sent
post haste to St. Michael. And now it
remains to be seen what the outcome
of the scheme will be. Of course, if
the miners have their gold with them
they may believe the etory and come
down in a British vessel. Irving will
have gained his point and will consider
that cablegram cheap at the price.
The Walla Walla's passengers say
that the United States consuls at Vic
toria and Vancouver, B. C, thoroughly
believed the story and kept the wires
hot between the Sound and Washing
ton. The authorities at the capital evi
dently took little stock in the story, as
the consuls' telegrams were not an
swered. Captain Wallace of the Walla
Walla was warned by Consul Smith at
Victoria, but laughed the thing to
scorn, saying It was a lie made out of
whole cloth.
At the office of the Alaska Commer
cial Company they say that the St.
Paul is not fully due until to-day. The
steamer sailed from here on June 11
and was not expected to reach St.
Michael until June 24 or 25. After that
it is all guess work. No one knows
how long it took her to discharge her
freight or wheth-r the river steamers
had got down from Pawson. It nay
have been so rough that the work of
lightering could not be carried on, and
again, the steamer may have been
compelled to stand out to sea. Allow
ing a week for the discharging md
loading of the vessel and thirteen days
for the run to San Francisco, the St.
Paul would therefore not be due until
to-day. This figuring, of course, de
pends upon how matters went at St.
Michael, and it may be several days
yet before the steamer gets in.
for the holding: of contests and exhibi
tions In the various mechanical and in
dustrial pursuits.
The first of these will assume the form
of a horse- shoeing contest and will be
held in Central Park on the 31st met. It
la expected that me entries will include
the principal horse shocrs in this city
and in the neighboring u>wns.
SONS OF VETERANS.
Patriotic Meeting to Encourage Gen-
eral Enlistment When
Necessary.
A mass meeting was held last night by
the Grand Army Veterans at the Red
Men's Hall for the purpose of Instilling in
the minds of the yo;ing the patriotism
which results In enlistment.
It. Plymiro opened with an address
i both stirring and patriotic. He introduced
the presiding officer of the evening, Colo
: nel Charles L. Pierce. Solomon Cohen
followed with a very eloquent appeal for
assistance to the country in this time of
International wnriare. Major Mattocks
j then addressed the assembled patriots on
one's duty to his country. Major Mat
. tocka is an ex-Confederate officer with a.
martial record that has won him fame
The present unity and the cause of fref
dom and liberty constituted his theme
: Speeches were delivered by Major Simp
son and General Salomon, the burden .â :
1 which wore the glorious caus^- of the pres
ent war and the unimpeachable reasons
for its continuance until the pride of that
effete monarchy, Spain, is humbled in the
dust.
The purpose of the meeting was to
arouse the spirit of patriotism in the Sons
of Veterans to fill out the companies al
ready organized and the possible forma
tion of a battalion from this rlty.
The Irish Fair.

among the ladies who have taken an In
terest in the coming Irish Fair. At the

man ran across Market street and sought refuge in a saloon at 7 Stockton street. The mob followed him,
but before the ringleaders had a chance to seize him the bartender, soenting trouble, got him out
through the side entrance. Determined that he should not escape, the crowd followed him along Stockton street
to O'Farrell, where he again sought refuge in a saloon.
By this time several officers appeared on the scene, and after learning the cause of the trouble, they entered the
saloon and assisted the man to escape unknown to the mob. One of the number, however, saw the scared indi
vidual running along O'Farrell street and shouting to his companions, he commanded them to follow him.
As the howling mob was within a few feet of him, the pursued man dashed into a saloon at the corner of
O'Farrell and Powell streets, followed by Police Sergeant Martin and several police officers.
Martin, realizing that serious trouble was inevitable, advised the new defiant man to skip.
Instead of taking the sergeant's advice he made a dash at him as If to strike him.
Martin met him with a half-hook on the jaw, which completely knocked him out. Turning to the Impatient
crowd Martin announced that he had "captured the enemy" and ordered the saloon cleared.
The mob reluctantly fell back; not until, however, several of them were severely clubbed. When quiet was
restored Martin summoned the patrol wagon and had the man taken to the City Prison. He gave his name
as George Ransome. and claimed that he came from Canada. He was charged with disturbing the peace and
using vulgar language.
The trouble, it was afterward learned, was caused by a friend of the prisoner throwing a glass of beer In a
soldier's face. The latter was sitting In the Cafe Royal when Ransome and his friend entered. After ordering
their drinks Ransome's friend, it is said, referred in a derogatory way to the Stars and Stripes, and offered a
toast to Spain.
The soldier, whose name was not ascertained, grew indignant, whereupon one of the men threw the contents of
his glass in his face. A number of people witnessed the incident and at once started to wreak vengeance on Ran
some and his friend. The latter managed to escape, but his companion, who was in a defiant mood, dared them
to touch him. As they started for him he took to his heels and dashed from the saloon followed by the crowd.
Had it not been for the police, It is believed Ransome would have been severely dealt with, as several of the
crowd were determined to lynch him on learning: of the insult heaped upon the soldier.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 13, 1898.
SUFFERING RELIEVED BY DEATH.
EX-JUDGE EUGENE R, GARBER, Who Died at Noon
Yesterday.
As the whistles were signaling the noon hour yesterday. Eugene R. Gar
ber. ex-Judge of the Superior Court, prominent in legal circles, passed away
at the WaJdeck Sanitarium. His death was the result of an operation per
formed on his ear with a view to removing an abscess which had formed
there and which had caused him great pain and annoyance. The patient did
not rally after the operation and after remaining in an unconscious con
dition for nearly twelve hours he succumbed.
During the past few months the Judge had been a sufferer from the
complaint and frequently was compelled to seek his apartments in the Pal
ace Hotel for rest and quiet. Every effort was made to alleviate the trouble
but with only temporary success. It returned with greater pain a few weeks
ago and he had to give up his office duties and take to his room. Leading
specialists were called in and it was decided that an operation was necessary
to relieve him of the .annoyance. He was removed to the Waldeck and on
Saturday last he was operated on but with little success.
Dr. Hopkins, assisted by Drs. Arnold, Bazet and Newmark, after
consultation agreed that another operation was necessary, and on Monday
night It was performed. The patient did not survive the shock and at about
ten minutes of noon he died.
The news of his death shocked professional and business circles where
he was well and popularly known. The iron doors leading to his office over
the California Bank were swung to and a bit of crape informed the passerby
that another prominent citizen had passed away.
Judge 'Garner was forty years of age and was in the prime of life. He
was born In Livingston, Alabama, wiiere he leaves a mother to mourn~hlm.
On his arrival in this State he entered the law offices of Garber, Thornton
& Bishop, and was admitted to practice. He then took up his residence in
Nevada, where he was elected District Attorney and served so satisfactor
ily that he was elected Superior Judge.
After enjoying the honors of the Sagebrush State, he came to this city to
enter a wider field. His pleasing personality and legal ability soon gained
recognition and he was elected by a large vote to the Superior bench. While
a member of the judiciary he gained the favorable opinion of all those who
pleaded before him and his decisions usually met with approval, they being
Just and judicious. Very few of his decisions were questioned by the appel
late court and very few reversals were registered against him. He resigned
from the bench to act as special counsel for Henry Miller, the cattle king.
Soon after resumption of the law he formed a partnership with his cousin,
John Garber, of which firm he was a member when death closed his busy
life.

THURSTON AND
HATCH ARRIVE
THEIR WORK IN WASHINGTON
IS COMPLETED.
Will Go at Once to the Hawaiian Isl
ands, Where They Will See
the Flag-Raising.
Lorln Thurston, ex-Minister of Hawaii,
F. M. Hatch, present Minister of Hawaii,
W. A. Klnne and Senator Henry Water
house arrived in this city from Washing
ton last night and will sail on the Ala
meda to-day for Honolulu. They are all
Jubilant over the success of their mission
and happy that the long fight for annexa
tion has at last been terminated.
Mr. Thurston said last night: "I have
been in Washington about eighteen
months and the struggle for annexation
was a severe light, but now that it is all
over we are satisfied. Our exertions have
not been In vain and we feel sure that
the Hawaiian people will all welcome the
annexation measure of the Unitod
States."
F. M. Hatch has made the fight In per
son and he is now returning to HonoliTlu,
according to his own interpretation of af
fairs, for the purpose of looking after his
legal practice. He said: "The statesmen
In Washington seem to think that there
Is no necessity of any further action on
the part of the Hawaiian Government to
mal<o annexation a complete legal gov
ernroentai change. The admiral who has
been deputed to acquaint the Hawaiian
Government with the legislative actions
of the United States will soon arrive in
Honolulu and act accordingly, and that Is
all that is needed. The flag will be
hoisted and by that symbolic action the
Hawaiian Government will become an
nexed to the States."
Ex-Queen L,iliuokalani is still In Wash
ington and there Is no indication of any
desire on her part to return to her home.
Minister Hatch now occupies a peculiar
position. He is still Minister, but In view
of the anticipated changes consequent
upon annexation he is In a realm of
doubt. After the summer is over he ex
pects his present office to terminate.
HIS MONEY
SECURELY
SECRETED
Complaint of "Gold
Dust" Rodgers.
HE MISSED HIS WALLET
PECULIAR EXPERIENCE OF A
KLONDIKE MIN.tR.
After Having Three Women Ar
rested He Finds Out That
He Had Not Been
Robbed.
"Gold Dust" Rodgers, a recent arrival
from Dawson City, almost created
a panic in i-abst Cafe early yester
day morning when he announced that he
had been robbed of a thousand dollars
and several valuable nuggets.
Rodgers during the evening met sever
al women and invited them to have sup
per with him.
,"I'm a good fellow," he remarked,
throwing out his chest and extending tho
glad hand to his new feminine friends.
"There may be some frost on the arrivals
from the Klondike, "but there is none
on me. I'm out for a good time and want
you all to help me blow the dust that I
picked during my stay in Alaska."
The women, after announcing that they
were also strangers In this city, consent
ed to join Rodgers in supper.
"You're all right," coyly remarked the
prettiest of the trio. "Swiftwater Bill
isn't in it with you."
Apparently llrittered by the remark
â  Rodgers, after producing his wallet,
! which was till.-.} with greenbacks, told
them that he was willing to "blow the
bunch" if they desired.
"I'm no piker," he declared. "Order
what you want and I'll pay for It."
Evidently thinking he was in earnest
the women scanned the bill of fare and
called for the most expensive dishes.
When the bill, which amounted to $7 50,
was presented to him "Golti Dust" got
| cold feet and called for "another deck,"
as one of the women expressed it.
"It is all right, girls." he remarked as
he gingerly handled the bill. "I'm good
for the amuunt; nobody can say that Gold
Dust is not a thoroughbred."
At this juncture Rodgers excused hlm
' self after saying he was going down
stairs to see a friend. He returned in a
; few minutes and announced that he had
been robbed.
"You can't play me for a sucker," he
! vehemently d^clarf-d. "I haven't played
against Wyatt Earp and the tough push
or" Alaska without knowing a trick or
two."
"Give me back my dough or there will
be trouble."
The women, thinking that he had sud-
I denly lost his mind, summoned Police Of
j ficer Keyes, who was standing at the cor
' ncr of Ellis and Powell streets. Detec
; tlves Gibson .and Wren were on the oppo
] site corner, and Keyes realizing the job
lie had before him, asked them to help
him out of the dilemma. On reaching the
: room where the women and Rodgers were
they found the latter sitting on the table
with a carving knife in his hand and
threatening to kill the one who had re
i lieved him of his wallet.
"I'm a bad man, " he hissed as the of
ficers entered. "I would rather see blood
than attend a bamjupt."
The women becoming frightened begged
the officers to take them to police head
quarters. They denied having taken Rod
gers' money and demanded an Immediate
investigation.
As the Klondiker was convinced that
he had been robbed, the officers called
the patrol wagon and had the entire
party taken to the City Hall. Rodgers and
: the women were taken b'fore Captain
i Wittman, and after Rodgers had told
; his tale of woe he was asked whom he
suspected. As he hesitated Wittman or
dered Policeman Keyes to search him.
"This is a waste of time," remarked
I Rftdgers, as the officer proceeded to search
his pockets. "I know the money is gone."
Despite his objection Keyes explored his
pockets, and not finding the supposed
I mlsing wallet, ordered him to take off his
! shoes. As he released himself of his foot
gear the policeman detected the wallet se
creted in the kg of his underwear. When
shown the wallet Rodgers seemed sur
prised and offered to apologize to the
I women.
"I guess I'm a dead one," he rather
lugubriously remarked, "l^ey couldn't
have done that in the Klondike."
The police are inclined to believe that
one of the women "touched" him for his
money, but. becoming alarmed, slipped
it into his trousers unknown to him. The
nuggets were not found, however, but as
Rougers did not appear anxious to prose
i cute the women they were released.

League of Improvement Clubs.
The meeting of the Mission League of
Improvement Clubs at Maennerbund
1 Hall on Howard street was well attended
' last night. T. B. Slevin presided and J.
I B. Vizzard acted as secretary. The execu*
i tive committee reported that the Supev
i visors had acted on the recommendation
I of the club, asking for the grading and
I sewering of the following streets: Hamp
shire, York, Bryant, Shotwell, How.-ird,
and Treat avenue.
Secretary Vizzard reported that the at
! tentlon of the Supervisors had been rll
; rected to the overcrowded condition of
' the street cars running through th-? M!h
1 slon during the morning mil evenh.g
| hours, and requested that body to eon
, suit with the City and County Attorney
as to the power of the board to frame an
ordinance regulating the ntrttilor of pas
! sengers that should be carried on tach
1 car.
Max Popper offered a recommendation
that the Supervisors provide in the next
I tax levy for a street sprink'er, with a
gasoline pump attached, whlcn would
i supply the sprinkler with salt water, to
ibe used in sprinkling San Bruno road
during the summer months. The cost of
this apparatus would be .somewher) in
j the neighborhood of $800, and by it the
' city would be saved the cost of purchas
ing water from the Spring Valley Water
Company.

A MIRACULOUS ESCAPE.
John Rawson, a Soldier, Accidentally
Shoots Himself Through the
Left Side.
John Rawson, a member of Company A,
Alger's Light Artillery of Wyoming, ac
cidentally shot himself in the left side
last night while trying to remove his coat
in a room on Grant avenue. The bullet
passed completely through him and his
escape from instant death was miracu
lous. The wounded volunteer was re
moved to the Receiving Hospital and
treated by Dr. Bunnell. The latter
thinks the wound may develop into in
flammation of the lung. The pistol he
used was an old-fashioned Colt's, which
the owner had filed down, giving it a hair
trigger pull. The handle of the long
weapon became entangled in the lining of
his blouse, and as he turned to reach for
it the weapon was discharged.
