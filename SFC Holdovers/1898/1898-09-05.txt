MME. DREYFUS NOW
DEMANDS REVISION
REQUESTS A
NEW TRIAL FOR
HER HUSBAND
Touching Appeal to
the Minister of
Justice.
HIS DUTY IS POINTED OUT
ONI/? ONE WHO CAN REOPEN
THE CELEBRATED CASE.
In Her Communication the Wife
Tells of the Undying Loyalty
of the Prisoner of Devil's
Island.
PARIS, Â£ept. 4. â Mme. Dreyfus has
Bent In the following: demand to the
Minister of Justice for a revision of
her husband's trial:
M. le Ministreâ l had the honor in the
month of July to place before you a re
quest In which I asked you to exercise the
right conferred upon you by lawâ and
which is conferred upon no one else â to
transmit to the Court of Cessation for
reconsideration the judgment rendered
against my unfortunate husband In vio
lation of article 101 of the Military Code.
I have ihe honor, now, M. If 1 Ministre, to
again address you a second time ap
pealing to you, because the law which
governs such a revision does not permit
me directly and by my own agency to
Invoke justice.
You and you alone have the right of
revlsloti of the judgment bringing with it
condemnation, on the ground of the dis
covery of new facts tending to establish
the innocence of the imprisoned man
quite distinctly and without reference to
or assistance from all the revelations of
many months past which have thrown
so much light upon the judicial error of
IS<M nml which have caused such profound
emotion and excitement throughout the
country. It Is not possible that you.
above all others, should not be struck by
the following facts:
Firstâ There Is the examination of the
bordereau which was made in the trial
of January of this year. The results of
this examination were not communicated
to my counsel, the counsel of war re
fusing them access to it. But I have
certain information that the conclusions
drawn from this examination were not
the same as the examination of 1894.
There is. also, following this exposure,
the confession made by one of the prin
cipal accusers and witnesses against my
husband in his trial, in which he admits
that he forged the dojiimcnt that the
Minister in his speech to the Chamber on
July 7 last declared to be proof positive
of the guilt of my husband, though it was
written long after his condemnation. This
proof, therefore, crumbles to pieces and
destroys the value of the depositions
which convinced the judges in 1894. Since
then this partisan witness of the culpa
bility of my husband has been convicted
of the crime of forgery under circumstan
ces of which you are fully aware.
But M. Le Ministre, as I have just told
you, in case of revision instituted by law
for judicial errors, the right to demand
Buch revision belongs neither to the inno
cent man who has been unjustly con
demned, nor to his wife nor to his chil
dren. This right belones to you alone.
Now. therefore, I beseech you, M. I,e
Ministre, to use without delay the rights
which are conferred upon you by law,
which are only conferred upon you both
for the annulment and revision of a ver
dict which was neither just nor legal.
I beseech you to hear the voice, now al
most unanimous, of public opinion, and
put an end to the suffering of. an Inno
cent man who always has been a loyal
soldier and who has not ceased â even
among the tortures of an unmerited pun
ishmentâto declare his love for the
fatherland and his faith In justice being
finally done him. I beg you will receive,
M. le Minlstre, the assurance of my most
distinguished consideration.

ESTERHAZY AS AUTHOR
OF THE FAMOUS NOTE
Special dispatch to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 18S8. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Sept. 5.â The Gaulols this
morning published under reserve a
statement to the effect that the Mlnls
' ter of War has been officially Informed
that Esterhazy proposes shortly to de
claro himself to be the author of the
bordereau. The Gaulols says doubt is
Â«ast on the story by the fact that when

PROMINENT NATIVES
MANILA, September 4.â According to advices from
Iloilo Governor Rios,*governor of the Vizcayas, is arresting
and shooting suspected persons, including prominent natives
of Manila.
The obstructions on t.ie railway from Manila toCaloocan
have been removed and the first train left yesterday. It is
expected that traffic will be resumed to the Dagupan terminus
to-morrow. The steamers Ohio and Valencia have sailed for
San Francisco.
The San Francisco Call
MAY SUCCEED M. CAVAIGNAC IN THE FRENCH CABINET.
General Pellieux of the general staff of the French army, and of late
an advocate for the revision of the Dreyfus case, is mentioned as the suc
cessor of M. Cavaignac as Minister of War. During the Zola trial In Feb
ruary last General Pellieux especially charged himself with proving the in
nocence of Colonel Esterhazy. and maintained that no other man than Cap
tain Dreyfus could have written the "bordereau." He ended his testimony
by declaring "It is a war on the army that they are making here," etc.. re
ferring to Scheurer-Kestner. Zola. Labori and others who sought to prove
the innocence of Captain Dreyfus. Now, that through the efforts and in
vestigations of M. Cavaignac Lieutenant Colonel Henry confessed the for
gery and ended his life. General Pellieux is for the revision of the whole
matter, while Cavaignac maintains that it Is not necessary, and resigns be
cause he cannot accord with the views of his colleagues.
terhazy mentioned a sum which had
been offered him to make this affirma
tion.
MANY MINISTERIAL
CONFERENCES HELD
PARIS, Sept. 4.â Owing to the resig
nation of M. Cavaignac of the Ministry
of War President Faure returned to
Paris this morning and conferred with
II del Casse, Minister for Foreign Af
fairs; M. Bourgeois, Minister of Pub
lic Education, and General Zurlinden.
The Cabinet will meet to-morrow ex
pressly to deal with a request from
Mme. Dreyfus for a revision of the pro
ceedings of the court-martial that con
demned her husband.
As the Cabinet is now practically
unanimously in favor of revisionâ
partly because the Ministers are aware
that there is no other method of satis
fying public feelingâ the outcome of the
meeting is almost a foregone conclu
sion. â¢
It is not thought that M. Cavaignac's
retirement will involve the resignation
of other Ministers. The fact that Gen
eral Zurlinden had been in conference
with M. Faure is taken to mean that he
will succeed M. Cavaignac at the War
Office.
The Ministerial conferences, which
have been continued throughout the
day, have had to do with the details
of revision. There is no foundation foT
the report that the Chambers will be
immediately convoked.
According to Le Soir M. Faure, who
received M. Cavaignac to-day, strongly
urged him to withdraw his resignation.
The paper also asserts that at the
council to-morrow the President will
endeavor to prevent a decision in favor
of revision. On the same authority it
is announced that General Roger, chief
of M. Cavaignac's military staff, will
retire at his own request.
The name of General Saussier, for
merly Military Governor of Paris, is
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1898.
mentioned In connection with the War
Office portfolio.
In her letter to M. Parrten. the Min
ister of Justice, Mme. Dreyfus says she
addresses him again, since he alone
has the right to demand revision on
the ground of a "new fact." She ar
gues that Lieutenant Colonel Henry's
admission of forgery deprives his depo
sitions and acts of all weight, and con
cludes her appeal by calling upon M.
Sarrien to "listen to the voice of public
opinion and put an end to the punish
ment of a loyal and Innocent man."
The Temps, Liberte and Journal dcs
Debats express regret at M. Cavaig
nac's "obduracy," asserting that it adds
to the difficulties of the situation.
RELIGIOUS SERVICES
WERE FORBIDDEN
PARIS, Sept. 4.â The services at the
interment of the remains of Lieutenant
Colonel Henry at Pochy yesterday were
civil, the Bishop of Chalona having
forbidden religious services. Several
staff officers were present at the cere
mony. *
WEYLER DRIVEN FROM
HOME BY A SCANDAL
BOSTON, Sept. 4.â The surprising an
nouncement was made to-day that Gen
eral Weyler lived in Boston for several
months in 1864, having fled from Spain be
cause of a domestic scandal. Superinten
dent Henry S. Treadwell of the South
Boston postoffice says that he and Wey
ler worked at sandpapering wall brackets
and other fancy articles during the latter
part of 1864 in the establishment of O. L.
Briggs, at the corner of Essex and Wash
ington streets.
Mr. Treadwell says: "I was foreman for
O. L. Briggs. This man was a boarding
house acquaintance. He asked me if
there was any work in my shop for him.
lie said he had been out of work and was
anxious to get something to do. He was
then not more than 30 years of ageâ a re
tined. well educated gentleman, courte
ous and intelligent. He told me he was a
Spanish officer, obliged to leave that
country on account of a social scandal.
He also told me of his father's title and
rank in the army and of his own position,
and said his mother was prominent in
Spain. He went to New York, where he
worked for a while. Shortly after he
learned from Spain that his trouble had
been settled, and he was at liberty to
return, which he did."
TROUBLE IN STORE
FOR PREMIER SAGASTA
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Dennett.
MADRID, Sept. 4.â The Cortes opens to
morrow at 2:30 o'clock. Weyler, who is
said to be full of fight, arrived this even
ing. His friends describe him as resolved
to tell truths which were not possible at
the time of his last speech in the Legis
lature. As I write the Carlists are In
session evolving great plans to torment
the Government. Sagasta declares the
moment has not arrived when peace will
be signed.
The situation is merely this: There Js
an armistice and peace is under discus
sion. Sagasta has to speak. He has put
on his best suit of armor and is well
equipped for a severe political tourna

BLUFFED TO
HASTEN THE
END OF WAR
How Naval Officials
Scared Spain.
SOME "INSIDE" HISTORY
ONE SCHEME THEY DID NOT
HAVE TO EXECUTE.
Sampson Would Have Been Sent to
the Spanish Coast With All the
Armorclads Under His
Command.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â The "Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Spain's action in suing for
peace at the time she did saved her
the humiliation of being the subject of
another bluff on the part of the Wash
ington authorities. The story of the
plan under which the eastern squadron
was to operate is one of the interesting
bits of history which will be officially
published when the correspondence of
the war is presented to Congress in De
cember. The auxiliary cruiser Har
vard, which was returned -to her own
ers only on Friday last, was to have
played the star part in the game which
was destined to hasten Spain's decision
to plead for peace.
To a certain extent the formation of
the eastern squadron itself was merely
for the purpose of frightening the Ma
drid Government and the announce
ment made at the time of its organiza
tion on June 27 that "this squadron
will sail for the coast of Spain imme
diately" was wholly intended to bring
Admiral Camara's command back to
Spain.
The object of the department's an-
nouncement was soon achieved. Then
came the danger of European interfer
ence In the disposition of the Philip
pines, and to impress Europe with
America's strength the attachment crt
all the arm on lads to the eastern
squadron wns ordered.
But the naval war board, after a
conference with the President, was
not through with its policy of scaring
Spain. As told to me to-day by an of
ficial in a position to know, Rear Ad
miral Sampson was instructed to leave
Guantanamo Bay and proceed to a
rendezvous at sea, where he was to
await further advices. The auxiliary
steamer Harvard, of great speed and
coal capacity was held at Hampton
Roads, despite the earnest representa
tions of the War Department, that she
was required for the transportation of
soldiers from Santiago. If at the end
of four days from the date of sailing of
the armorclads, which date was to be
made public and cabled abroad, Spain
failed to sue for peace, Captain O. F.
Goodrich was to be given sealed in
sructions to be delivered to Rear Ad
miral Sampson, directing him to con
tinue to the coast of Spain and de
stroy the ships of the Spanish navy.
If, on the other hand, Spain should ask
for a cessation of hostilities within that
period, the fact was to be communi
cated to Rear Admiral Sampson with
Instructions to proceed to Tompkins
ville.
NOW IN PURSUIT
OF THE KHALIFA
LONDON, Sept. 4.â The War Office
has received the following dispatch
from General Kitchener, dated Satur
day evening: "The remnant of the
Khalifa's force has surrendered, and I
now have a large number of prisoners
on hand. Our cavalry and gunboats are
still pursuing the Khalifa and his
chiefs, who, with only about 140 fight
ing men, are apparently making for
Kordo-lan.
"The left bank of the White Nile is
so difficult of approach, owing to the
overflow and thick bush, that the gun
boats cannot effect a landing. I there
fore can only rely upon the cavalry to
capture them.
"I visited Khartoum to-day. The
town is a complete ruin, but the lower
portions show some of the principal
houses still standing. The people are
naturally delighted to see us. So far as
I can see bJI present, Khartoum is the
best position. Omdurman is very ex
tensive and the stench there is unbear
able.
"I have, therefore, moved the troops
down to Khor Skambat, where we now
are in a good camp on the river. All
the British wounded will descend the
river with this dispatch. There are no
cases that cause grave anxiety."
CAIRO, Sept. 4.â The following tele
gram from the Lirdar, dated to-day
(Sunday) at Omdurman and forwarded
by camel post to Nasri, was received
this evening: "The camp has been
moved outside Omdurman to the river
banks. Our wounded are doing well
and are now descending the river. The
Austrian sister, Theresa Grigolini, and
all the European prisoners have been
rescued. They are well. The jist of our
casualties has not yet been received.
The population of Omdurman maifests
joy at the arrival of the expedition."
Transport Panama Sails.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4.â The follow
ing cablegram was received by the
War Department to-night from General
Wilson:
PONCE, Sept. 4.â Adjutant General,
Washington: Transport Panama sails at
4 o'clock this afternoon with 246 conval
escent soldiers. Surgeon Daly and three
aÃÃlstantÃ on board. Could accommodate

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 4.â Henry T.
Gage went to his ranch near Downey
early this morning and will remain
there three or four days to obtain
rest. He will probably make three or
four speeches, including one at San
Diego, before he goes north. His cam-
paign movements will be governed in
some degree by the directors of the
Republican State Central Committee,
but as the nominee is a man who is in
clined to be independent and out
spoken, he may go whither his inclina
tions lead him and speak in his own
fashion when the spirit moves him.
The great meeting last night is the
talk of the city to-day. The Populists
and the Democrats^ in the Populist
camp admit that the demonstration
was greater than they imagined it
could be. The Silver Republicans are
on the way back to the regular Repub
lican fold. Many of them have al
ready re-enlisted in the ranks of the
grand old party for this campaign.
The rooms formerly occupied as head
quarters of the Silver Republicans on
Main street have been closed and the
sign "To Let" is up.
The Maguire ' Democrats and the
Populists are now building their hopes
of success on an overwhelming ma
jority for their little gaint in San
Francisco. On all sides one hears the
comment:
"The battle ground is San Fran
cisco."
Gage will get a large majority south
of the Tehachapi. So many Demo
crats here of the old school openly an
nounce their intention to vote for the
Republican nominee that the Maguire
followers are inclined to put forward
their main efforts in the San Joaquin
Valley and the Democratic precincts of
San Francisco. All that the Repub
licans in this region of the State ask
is that the Democratic majority in the
metropolis shall be limited to its nor
mal figure. The followers of Gage are
confident that they can offset as large
a metropolis majority as Budd ob
tained four years ago, but they hope
that Gage will hold Maguire down to
smaller figures.
It is understood that Mr. Gage will
visit the mining districts in this part
of the State. He will make one speech
at Randsburg.
TWO BRITISH OFFICERS

CAIRO, Sept. 4.â General Kitchener
telegraphs saving:
"Only two British officers were killed
in the battleâ Lieutenant Grenfell of

Caldecott, Warwickshire Regiment.
Grenfell fell in a brilliant charge by
the Twenty-first Lancers, who lost 21

MANILA, Sept. 4.â Visiting the Ma
late trenches yesterday, I saw insur
gent soldiers in strong force holding
the exact position behind the aban
doned American works from which Gen
eral Greene displaced them before the
fall of Manila. This morning I saw
some Tagallos rebuilding a trench in
the vicinity of San Pedro de Malate
and Santa Mesa, which were aban
doned last week.
"While the more intelligent natives
talk annexation and unruly lieuten
ants continue to commit depredations
within tlie city it is clearly the pur
pose of Aguinaldo to place himself in
the same position he occupied before
American occupation, pending the de
cision of the Paris conference. What
ever may be the outcome, the rebel
leader will insist upon his purpose to
struggle for complete independence,
while protesting his friendship for the
Americans.
There has been no attempt yet made
to cut off access to the country.
DERVISHES SUSTAINED
A HEAVY LOSS
LONDON, Sept. 5. â The war corre
spondent of the Daily Telegraph with
the Anglo-Egyptian forces says: Kha
lifa Abdullah, with his harem and Os
man Digna, his principal general, man
aged to escape, but Abdullah's banner
and thousands of prisoners are in our
hands. It is estimated that 15,000 of the
enemy were slain. Our total casualties
â were about 500.
Besides Colonel Rhodes, another cor
respondent was slightly wounded. Mr.
Howard, the New York Herald corre
spondent, was slain by a shell in Om
durman.
The war correspondent of the Daily
News says: Our victory was not easily
or cheaply won. The Dervish loss was
enormouV It is estimated that the
killed of the enemy were not fewer than
8000. Our whole force was engaged in
fighting from 6:30 a. m. until sundown.
Instead of waiting for us in Omdur
man, where they could have made a
resistance that would â have cost us
thousands of lives, they advanced to
meet us. The right was extraordinary.
Some 12,000 men in four brigades at
tempted to rush our Zereba. With des
perate gallantry they were repulsed,
suffering huge loss. Our Maxim guns
especially made terrible lanes in their
ranks, and our artillery dealt havoc in
the town, which was full of women.
The Dervish army of 60,000 is utterly
broken, but we are fully prepared to
fight to-morrow If they wish it.

O M DURMAN, opposite
Khartoum, on the Nile, Nubia,
September 2 (by camel post to
Nasri) â The Sirdar, General Her
bert Kitchener, with the Khali
fa's black standard captured dur
ing battle, entered Omdurman,
the capital of Mahdiam, at 4
o'clock this afternoon at the head
of the Anglo-Egyptian column,
after completely routing the Der
vishes and dealing a death blow
to Mahdism.
Roughly our losses were 200. while
thousands of the Dervishes were killed
and wounded.
Last night the Anglo-Egyptian army
encamped at Agaiza, eight miles from
Omdurman. The Dervishes were
three miles distant. At dawn to-day,
our cavalry, patrolling toward Omduf
man, discovered the enemy advancing
to the attack in battle array, chanting
war songs. Their fror^ consisted of in
fantry and cavalry stretched out for
three or four miles. Countless banners
fluttered over their masses, and the
copper and brass drums sounded
through the ranks of the savage war
riors, who advanced unswervingly with
all their old time ardor. Our infantry
formed up outside the camp. On the
left were the First Battalion Northum
berland Fusileers, the Second Bat
talion Lancashire Fusileers and the
First Battalion Grenadier Guards, with
the Maxim battery, manned by the
Royal Irish Fusileers. In the center
were the first Battalion "Warwickshire
Regiment, the First Battalion Cameron
Highlanders and the First Battalion
Lincolnshire Regiment with Maxims
worked by a detachment of the Royal
Artillery under Major Williams. On
our '^ht were the Soudanese brigades,
commanded by General Maxwell and
General Macdonald. The Egyptian bri
gades held the reserves and both flanks
were supported by the Maxim-Norden
feldt batteries.
At 7:20 a. m. the enemy crowded the
ridges above the camp and advanced
steadily in enveloping formation. At
7:40 our artillery opened fire, -which
was answered by the Dervish riflemen.
Their attack developed on our left, and
in accordance "ith their traditional
tactics they swept down the hillside
with the design of -^shing our flank.
But the withering fire maintained for
fifter i mm. tes by all our line frus
trated the itter^- \ and the Dervishes,
balked, swept toward our center, upon
which they concentrated a fierce at
tack. A large force of horsemen, try
ing to face a continuous hail of bullets
from the Cameron Highlanders, the
Lincolnshire Regiment and the
Soudanese, was literally swept away,
leading to the withdrawal of the entire
body, whose dead strewed the field.
The bravery of the Dervishes can
hardly be overstated. Those who car
ried the flags struggled to- within a
hundred yards of our fighting line.
When the Dervishes withdrew behind
the ridge in front of their camp the
whole force marched in echelon of bat
talions toward Omdurman. As our
troops surmounted the crest adjoining
the Nile the Soudanese on our right
came into contact with the enemy, who
had reformed under cover of a rocky
eminence and had massed beneath the
black standard of the Khalifa in order
to make a supreme effort to retrieve
the fortunes of the day. A mass, 15,
000 strong, bore down on the Soudan
ese.
General Kitchener swung around the
center and left of the Soudanese and.
seized the rocky eminence, and the
Egyptians, hitherto in reserve, joined
the firing line in ten minutes, and be
fore the Dervishes could drive their
attack home the flower of the Khalifa's
army was caught in a depression and
within a zone of withering cross-fire
from three brigades, with the attendant
artillery. The devoted Mahdists strove
heroically to make headway, but every
rush was stopped, w r hile their main
body was literally mown down by a
sustained deadly cross-fire.
Defiantly the Dervishes planted their
standards and died beside them. Their
dense masses gradually melted to com
panies and the companies to driblets
beneath the leaden hail. Finally they
broke and fled, leaving the field white
with jibbah-clad corpses, like a snow
drift-dotted spot.
At 11:16 o'clock the Sirdar ordered
an advance and our whole force. In2

line, drove the scattered remnant of the
foe into the desert, our cavalry cut
ting off their retreat to Omdurman.
Among the chief incidents of the bat
tle was a brilliant charge by the
Twenty-first Lancers, under Lieuten
ant Colonel Martin. Galloping down
on a detached body of the i-nemy they
found the Dervish swordsmen massed
b. hind and were forced to charge home
airainst appalling odds. The Lancers
hacked through the mass, rallied and
kept the Dervish horde at bay. Lieu
tenant Grenfell, nephew of General Sir
Francis Grenfell, was killed, four other
officers were wounded and twenty-one
men were killed and twenty wounded.
The Egyptian cavalry were in close
fighting throughout with the Baggara
horsemen. For a short period the
enemy captured and held the gun, but
it was brilliantly retaken.
The heroic bravery of the Dervishes
evoked universal admiration. Time
after time their dispersed and broken
forces re-formed and hurled themselves
upon the Anglo-Egyptians, their Emirs
conspicuously leading and spurning
death. Even when wounded and in
death agonies they raised themselves to
fire a last shot.
Among the wounded is Colonel
Rhodes, the correspondent of the Lon
don Times and a brother of Cecil
Rhodes.
HOW THE EXPEDITION

LONDON, Sept. 4.â The Daily Tele

following details of the movements on
"Wednesday and Thursday, telegraphed
from Nasri:

men were moving west upon the Egyp
tian right, and the lancers on the
left, trotted to intercept the enemy, the
camel corps supporting. But the Der
vishes slipped back to their camp in
the bush a mile 'iland.
"The lancers advanced throueh the
hill passes and got within a mile of
Kerreri. Then officers went ahead and
discovered that there were many flags
in the Dervish camp. They were fired
upon and eventually the entire force
returned to Sur-Urab, inside the Zer
eba.
"During the afternoon the gunboats
shelled the Dervish camp for several
hours, apparently doing much damage.
A number of Dervishes who had fled
to the bush to escape the shells sur
rendered during the evening. Among
the refugees were the Sheikh of Jerrerl
and a grandson of Khurshid Pasha,
"This (Thursday) morning, in spite of
a fierce rainstorm, which continued all
last night and until 9 o'clock to-day,
the army advanced at 6 o'clock and
found Kerreri deserted. The lancers
on the left and the Egyptian cavalry
and camel corps on the right advanced
six miles ahead of the infantry, which
marched in a square. The lancers got
within a mile of Omdurman and saw
the dome of the Mahdi's tomb and the
palm trees of Khartoum.
"Drawn up in five divisions, with a
wing thrown back, was the Khalifa's
army, its spears and swords glistening
in the sunshine, arrayed northwest of
the town in the desert. In the central
division was an enormous number of
banners, including one of blue and one
of black.
A number of mounted Dervishes gal
loped forward and our dismounted
troops fired upon them, hitting several
and driving off the remainder. Two
squadrons of our cavalry pushed to
within 800 yards of the enemy, who
then advanced, our lancers and the
Egyptians retiring. The gunboats are

CAMP "WTKOFT. MONTAUK
POINT, Jept. 4.â This great camp will
dissolve during the coming three weeks
and by October 1 it will have shrunk
to slender proportions. The well men.
according to the War Department's set
designs, will leave the camp as fast as
transportation can be conveniently
provided, probably at the rate of 3000 |
or 4000 a week. The ->nvalescentÃ from |
the transports, instead of being again j
sent into camp, will go to their homes.
The President, Secretary AlÂ£ r and
General Wheeler had a talk about it
yesterday, and although General
Waeeler thought the men would do well
in camp until October 1, it was deter
mined to continue sending them away.
The regulars taken from the posts east
of the Mississippi will, according to the ;
present directions, be sent where they j
were before the war. The War Depart- j
tnent has not transmitted the order to
General Shatter yet, but it will no
doubt be received by Tuesday.
The Eighth Ohio and First Illinois
Will break camp on Tuesday. The
Rough Riders will muster out toward
the end of the week probably, and will i
not parade. The Rough Riders had re
ligious services in their camp to-day.
Colonel Roosevelt. after ChaDlain
Grown had concluded made a little
Bpee&h, a sort of farewell, some of the
men took it to be. Colonel Roosevelt
commended the daring and gallantry
of the men, and their skill in managing
horses and in the use of arms.
When the regiment was forming, he
said, many men had offered themselves
who announced they were ready to
"storm the Morro or right hell," but |
would not take kindly to camp rou- j
tine and drill. All such men had been
rejected. The Rough Riders had all
the forces of individual strength, and
in battle were as coherent and effective
as a projectile.
General Wheeler said that Lieutenant
Colonel Smart of the medical staff of
the army, had come to chemically ex
amine the water supplies to the camp.
He was at th-e top of his profession and ;
would, in about three. days, be able to
give â an absolutely authoritative deci
sion as to the purity of the water.
Women passing through the camp I
were displeased by seeing that RJme j
of the tents did not have floors and
fancied that the men must sleep on
the ground. They were wrong in sup
]>"sing that. In tents without floors
were wooden bunks or thick straw. As
for himself. General Wheeler said, he
liked the camp better every day and
â would like to live in it until October 1.
The season oÂ» September gales is ap
proaching and the War Department
forseea that the Long Island Railway
i may not be able to move conveniently
i more than 1000 men a day. Plans have
been partially made to transport troops
I to New York by water if it should be
advisable.
The troopship Roumania, five days
j from Santiago, came in to-day with
â  several companies of the Ninth Massa-
I chusetts and convalescents from vari
ous companies, in all about 600 men.

TOO WEAK TO WALK,
BUT NOT COMPLAINING
DETROIT, Mich., Sept. 4.â Members
of the Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth
Michigan Volunteers, who arrived last
night, were quartered in the leading
hotels and to-day in the lobbies and
corridors were to be seen great piles of
guns, canteens, equipments, blankets
and other paraphernalia of the soldiers.
In the comfortable chairs and sofas
were found many of the Michigan sol
diers, who, while not sick enough to be
sentto the hospitals, still were too weak
to move around. In all, 200 of the men
were removed directly from the depots
to the hospitals. Although many of
them were in a serious condition, there
were no deaths among them to-day.
The men are being sent to their homes
as fast as transportation can be ajS
ranged for them.
The men of both regiments did very
little complaining most of what was
done being at the medical facilities in
Cuba, which they said, were very inef
fectual. The reason assigned for this
by many of the volunteers was that the
regimental surgeons were taken from
their regiments and sent to the gen
eral hospitals.
Praise for Camp "Wikoff was heard
In nearly all directions, most of the
men saying their treatment was all
that could ba desired.

New York.
WELL SUPPLIED WITH FUNDS
BUT KNOWS NOTHING OF THE
TWELVE MILLION FRANCS.
An-xious to Learn the Outcome of
the City of Mexico Adventure
Which Led to a Sanguin
ary Duel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. s 4.â The story
from Havana that General Luis N.
Pando, former commander of the Span
ish troops at Manzanillo, had secretly
fled from Cuba on the French steam
ship Notre Dame dv "Salut for Spain,
with 12,000,000 francs, was proved to be
unfounded to-day when the Ward liner
Philadelphia came to her do-ck on the
Kast River front. General Pando was
the first to land of the forty-two pas
sengers who arrived from Havana on
the vessel. He was plainly dressed
and wore nothing to indicate his high
rank in the Spanish army. He looks
more like a Frenchman than a Span
iard, being short and stout and wear
ing a thick black beard. He claims Ur
6p< ak no English, and after arranging
for the removal of his five pieces of
baggage drove to a hotel, where he en
gaged a suite of rooms.
The customs officer who examined
General Pando's luggage said that the
visitor was well supplied with funds.
Chatting with some of the Spanish
passengers during the voyage to this
city General Pando is said to have- told
ol his recent experience in Mexico.
While at the City of Mexico, according
to the Story, General Pando was the
guest of the Marquis de Casmera. One
night the general was aroused by the
Marquise de Casmera screaming that
there were thieves in the hacienda. In
the dark corridor General Pando grap
pled with a man whom he found there
and was stabbed in the neck before he
discovered that the supposed burglar
was really the marquis, who had re
turned late from the theater. The
wound wa.s slight.
Owing to remarks made concerning
the occurrence and the rellections made
on the character of the marquise by
Baron Starke, the Iron king of Du
rango, the Marquis de Casmera chal
lenged him to a duel with pistols. The
men met at Piedra Loma, in the State
(ff Hidalgo, and both were wounded.
The Marquis de Casmera was shot in
the body and Starke lost one of his
eyes. The Mexican authorities, on
learning of the duel, arrested the prin
cipals and the seconds, and Pando said
he was anxious to know the outcome
of the prosecution.
The Philadelphia brought a cargo of
647 bags of sugar and 231 packages of
tobacco and cigars. The latter are con
signed to firms in Boston, Chicago, San
Francisco, Canada, England, Hamburg,
Bremen, Florldp. and this city.

Awaits Transportation
Southward.
MOST OF IT IS FROM DAWSON
SOME FROM NEW DIGGINGS ON
LAKE ATLIN.

to the Latest Stam
pede.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 1 (by steam
ship City of Seattle, via Victoria. B.
C), Sept. 4).â lt has been a lons while
since so much gold has been stacked uv
here as has been jammed in ft hotel
safe for the last three days waking for
transportation south. The hinges of the
safe were almost strained. The srold had
to be packed in buckskin bass of
smaller size in order to allow it to lit
into the available space.
Not considering the trays in a bank
vault, so much gold has never been
packed into so small a space before.
Most of it came from Dawson. though
there were three sacks of line dust from
th.c new diggings on Lake Atlin. It
weighed in all about 800 pounds, and
that v.eight of sold at the offered Drice
of $17 per ounce is nearly $900,000. to say
nothing of the Alaska Commercial
Company's checks in the wallets of the
owners.
In all there is not less than $190,000
going out on this steamer, and there is
about half a million more now coming
up the river. The tide of travel has
turned and It is coming up the river
from Dawson instead <>f going down.
The gold carried south from here on
this trip is about equally divided be
tween \V. H. Schroeder, C. Luehmitt.
L. E. Beebe and Pat Lynch. Beebe has
about 200 pounds of Eldorado and Four
Mile dust. He left some of it in a safe
ty deposit vault here as a nest esre for
his return. He Is going to San Fran
cisco, thence to San Diego, and will re
turn by way of Ottawa, Ontario, where
he will register a, kick, he says, on the
royalty exacted by the Canadian Gov
ernment.
The new diggings, from all reports
so far, are holding up us well as ex
pected. The Call's expedition of inves
tigation will arrive out in a few days,
when an exhaustive and thoroughly re
liable report, obtained only at consider
able expense, may be expected. The
Call is the only newspaper which has
taken interest enough to learn the facts
in regard to the latest stampede.
Many are coming in from Atlin Lake
for provisions, with the intention of re
turnin" for the winter. Dawson will
have a lively rival this winter on the
shores of Atlin. Next summer the
whole country will be scoured In that
vicinity. The season is now too far ad
vanced for much prospecting this y<ar.
HAL HOFFMAN.
NOT EQUALLY DIVIDED.
Lucky and Unlucky Passengers of
the City of Seattle.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 4.âAccord
ing to Pursc-r Thorndyke, the steamer
City of Seattle, which reached port this
evening, had about $200,000 in gold and
drafts aboard. This was dividedâ not
very equally, however â between about
sixty Dawsonites, who came up the
river on the river steamer Ora, which
left the Klondike capital on August 19.
Among the rich men who came down
were A. Beebe, who is credited with
from $60,000 to $100,000; C. L. Dimond,
a Seattle and San Francisco shipping
man, a former owner of the steamer
Farallon, who had $43,000 he got by
speculation at Dawson; A. L. Esterley,
son of the Auditor of the Treasury at
Washhington, who had a big pile in
drafts; Dr. L. A. Blanc and Dr. Cham
bers, who had each about $10,000. There
were also two w '11-known newspaper
men among the new comers â H. S.
White, Keuter's agent, who is on his
way back to London, and A. C. Allen,
editor of the f-'iondike Nugget. Both
newspapermen say that not the slight
est fear is now expressed as to the food
question.
The Seattle brought news of a se
rious shooting affray at the White
Horse, as a result of which the stew
ard of the steamer Ora, James Cowie,
is said to be dead, and T. C. Burnett,
the purser of the Nora, is on his way
to Dawson to be tried for murder. The
two men had been enemies for some
time, and when the two steamers con
nected at the White Horse they had
words and a fight ensued. Burnett's
eyes were blackened and several abra
sions were visible on his face when the
two were separated. Burning for re
venge, he went to his steamer and se
curing a gun, shot Cowie, who is said
to have since died.
T. G. Lawrence, who with several
other prospectors seturned from Prince
William Sound, brought news of rich
gold and copper finds on Glacier and
Latoche Islands. The Alaska Commer
cial Company are also developing sev
eral rich prospects on Land-Locked
Bay and on Bilge Island, where thi-y
have found both gold and copper in
richly paying quantities.
There were also on the Seattle about
seventy sadly disappointed miners from
the Copper River, who had a terrible
tale to tell of privation. They say a
large number of deaths have resulted
in the stampede out, ten or twelve hav
ing been lost in the wreck of their rafts
on the Copper River, and several hav
ing fallen tc their deaths in crevasses.
There is not one of the party but talks
disparagingly of the country, and rays
it Is the greatest fraud ever perpe
trated.
rWO PROSPECTORS SLAIN.
TACOMA, Wash., Sept. 4.â The
schooner J. M. Colman, which arrived
on the Sound to-day from St. Michael,
brings news that two prospectors were
ambushed and killed while drifting
down the Yukon in a boat. Indians
fired on the boat, killing one and
wounding the other. The wounded man
escaped and reached a police camp.
Police started and found the Indians
enjoying the prospectors' supplies. They
were brought to Dawson, where one of
the Indians made a confession.
Mr Frank, who came on the Colman,
says' that when he left Dawson there
was a stampede to Dewey and gamp
son creeks, from which fine reports
came Both are in American territory.
BED BLUFE MYSTERY.
Leg of a Man Found Floating in the
River.
RED BLUFF, Sept. 4.â The leg of a
man was found floating in the river half
a mile below town to-day, by two boys
in a boat. It was the right leg and had
been broken off above the knee. Part of
the clothing was still clinging to it. but
there was no shoe. From its condition
the amputation was probably the result
of a railroad or steamer accident, as
great force must have been exerted to
mangle it as it was.
SECRETARY ALGER
AND MR. SHERMAN
Head of War Depart-
ment Explains.
THE OFFICIALS WORKED WELL
BUT HE CANNOT REVEAL STATE
SECRETS IN DEFENSE.
Statement of the Ex-Secretary of
State That War Could Have
Been Avoided Is Now Vig
orously Combated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW V _IX, Sept. 4.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Secretary Alger, after care
fully reading the interview with John
Sherman, former Secretary of State,
which was printed in the Herald this
morning, said to me:
"There is nothing for me to reply to.
The alleged charges against me are
contained not in anything that Mr.
Sherman has said, but in the head
lines. Mr. Sherman has said that as
Secretary of War I was responsible for
the army administration. That is true
and the officials in the War Department
did all that was possible coming, as
the work did, in such a vast volume."
Secretary Alger has already express
ed himself as much gratified with the
report of General Boynton, which re
port, he said, had shown that the con
ditions at Chickamauga had been much
exaggerated. The Secretary was agree
ably aware, moreover, that Governor
Black had come back from his tour of
investigation satisfied that the condi
tion of the New York regiments had
been misrepresented. Secretary Alger
said he would not be drawn into any
contention with J.lr. Sherman.
"Our relations are friendly," said he.
"I do not desire to be drawn into any
controversies now being agitated."
When asked about the proposition of
Miles to parade in New York, Secretary
Alger said: "I do not believe General
Miles ever had such an intention. The
men with him who are free from fever
have been ordered mustered out and
will be taken on their arrival to their
several States to be mustered out."
The Secretary said it would be mani
festly improper for him to reveal what
happened in the Cabinet, as that would
be revealing a state secret, and for this
reason he declined to discuss for pub
lication that part of Sherman's inter
view in which the former Secretary of
State stated he could have negotiated
a treaty by which Spain would have
peacefully evacuated Cuba, It is this
portion of Sherman's interview that
received the most attention here, as it
charged Congress with having plunged
the country into a needless war. There
has been much discussion of Mr. Sher
man's statement.
A person with whom I talked and
who is in a position to know, said that
at no time was Mr. Sherman in a posi
tion, as he states, to procure evacuation
with peace: that the best proposition
made to this Government was a "di
luted" form of autonomy which was in
no wise adequate to the contention of
the people; that Mr. Sherman was no
more heartily in favor of peace than
the rest of the administration, the only
difference being that he was for "peace
at any price," as it was expressed to
me. The administration realizes now,
I was informed, that war could not
have been averted, even if the Maine
catastrophe had not occurred; that it
was among future events th^t had to
be; that leaders in Congress were fully
in accord with the administration and
knew that the claim of Mr. Sherman
was impossible. There is no conceal
ment of the fact that the future of
Cuba is now a grave problem before the
administration; that the question of
suffrage "' basis of the future Gov
ernment has been studiously avoided in
the instructions to the commissioners.
This will be the basis of Congressional
action, and the form of government and
time of turning it over to the Cubans
are among the perplexing uncertainties.

KENTUCKY'S GOVERNOR ,
PRAISES CAMP THOMAS
FRANKFORT, Ky., Sept. 4.âGov
ernor Bradley and his corps of sur
geons and nurses returned to-day with
the Kentucky hospital train from
Chickamauga. The Governor, after
personal inspection of Camp Thomas,
does not credit many stortes of neg
lect of soldiers at Camp Thomas by
their officers and says the situation
there is much more favorable than he
expected to find it. Fifty-three sick
soldiers from the Second Kentucky
Regiment were brought back on the
hospital train. Surgeons in charge o-f
the train were very complimentary in
talks concerning Sternberg and Leiter
hospitals, and say they think the prev
alence of typhoid fever in camp is due
to lack of sewerage and failure to re
move garbage from the camp grounds.

Learned Man's Advice to the Fresh-
men of Stanford.
FTANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 4.â
The first religious services of the colleg-e
year were held in the chapel this morning.
The sermon, delivered by Dr. W. W. Tho
burn, was on "Liberty." Tn the course of
his remarks the speaker said that a man
wafl free when he could do as he pleased,
provided he pleased to do what was right.
Liberty, he said, was not freedom from
service. .
In his address to the freshmen. Dr.
Thoburn cautioned the new students to
be careful lost they broke with their prin
ciples In breaking with tneir past. He
called their attention to the fact that the
most sailing chains were not the phys
ical chains. In speaking of their duties
toward society, he remarked that more
effective work could be done as members
of organizations than as free lances, and
said that as society had no use for out
siders they must prepare themselves for
work and show their beliefs by their acts.

Gallantry of Califorr)iar)s in Their
First Battle in the Phil

How th)e Nigh)t Attack by Spaniards or) the
Trenches Before Can)p Dewey Was
Repulsed.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY SOL. N. SHERIDAN.
CAMP DEWEY, Aug. I.â The man
"who places his trust in regulars racier
than volunteers should have been with
the First California when the boys
made their way to the trenches last
night through a storm of lead and iron,
which made the whale length of the
Calle Real one hell. I have cabled you
the story of the first battle, the mid
night alarm and the death list which
shows how bravely the boys gave their
lives for their country.
I was asleep in Colonel Smith's tent
when the firing began out on the lines.
It awakened me, but at first neither
the colonel nor any man in camp paid
a great deal of lieed. There had been
firing on the lines every night.
"That is more than a fight between
Spaniards and rebels, " said Colonel
Smith.
He was fully dressed, the whole camp
Was alarmed, before the call to arms
came â as it did come, to be greeted
with a cheer by the California lady.
Before midnight the First California
was under arms, had reported to Brig
adier General Greene and had been or
dered to relieve the menin the trenches,
hard pressed by the Infanteria de Ma
rina, the best soldiere of Spain.
Being the first to report Cali
fornia was given the honor of go
ing first to the front. It was
not a time to pick and choose.
Luck was with the general command
ing in placing reliable men for work at
his hand. Major Boxton, commanding
the First Battalion, moved down the
Calle {teal, with orders to make his
way at once into the trenches at the
front. Major Sime, commanding the
Second Battalion, moved in column
of fours through the camps of the Aator
Battery and of the Third Artillery to
the rice and peanut fields beyond, where
the men marched steadily forward, de
spite the rain and the deep water-holes
and the plowed land through which
they were compelled to make their way.
With this battalion I acompanied
Coionel Smith on the hardest march of
my life. It Is only two miles from
Camp Dewey t<> the front. To the boys
who marched last night, full of the ar
dor of battle, not even the obstacles
of the ground could make the way
seem longer. Majc-r Sime's orders were
to advance to the second line of
trenches, 800 yards from the front, and
deploying from the beach to Pasay to
caver the right. The Third Battalion,
commanded by Captain Cunningham
in the absence of Major Tilden, moved
last, with orders to lake pubition as
reserve halfway between Ciuny Dewey
and the Pasay road.
Behind the Callfornians the First
Colorado Regiment moved down across
the fiel<ls as a second line of reserve,
but never came Into action. Neither,
for that matter, did the Third Califor
nia Battalion, although the boys were
within range of the ripanlsh guns.
The First Battalion was folio-wed by
the band boys as ammunition carriers,
although every musician was armed.
Right here let me mention the gal
lantry of Band Master Holliater, who,
shouldering his musket with the rest,
led his men through the hell of fire at
the second line of trenches, on a quick
run and then, getting his right to the
front, fought as bravely as any man
in the ranks. Let me mention likewise
th" youngest member of the band, St.
Clair Moore, commonly called the
"Kid." He is a mere lad, and yet, in
the early gray of the morning I found
him on the firing line, beyond the
trenches to the right, and although he
â¢was blue with cold and wet, his one
regret was that h* had not seen a
chance to shoot a Spaniard.
Major Boxton carried his men down
the road almost to the second line of
trenches. Here was where brave Cap
tain Richter, standing up to lead his
men, who were crawling through the
danger zone, was shot in the head, a
Mauser bullet pulverizing the skull
â¢where it struck, glancing. Ho fell,
eaying: "I am dead, boys. Leave me,"
and lost consciousness.
The medical corps, Dr. McCarthy in
charge, assisted by Dr. P. J. Farrell
and Dr. O'Brien, had come up with the
rest, and had field hospitals established
while the men were advancing. Three
times these hospitals were removed to
seouro safety, but even in the
farthest removed of them the bullets
sung through the sides and thatched
roofs of the native huts selected for the
sick, while the doctors worked on the
wounded.
At the point where Captain Richter
m-as phot most of the casualties to the
Callfornlans occurred. Sergeant Justh
â¢was killed farther to the front. In the
advanced works. He was leading the
company, in the line, of duty, as a
brave man should have been. "I am
gone, boys," he said, and fell dead,
the first Californian to give --his life for
liberty in this distant land.
The First Battalion reached the
trenches almost upon the heels of the
regulars of the Heavy Artillery. Col
onel Hawkins' men, when help came,
had not more than four rounds of am
munition to the man remaining. They
liad held their grnnn-1 gallantly, but
without bullets could not stay the
Fj.nn'sh rushes, . although Company
D had already done srood work with
the bayonet. The "Terrible Tenth"
fell back, therefore, and the Califor
nians, rushing forward, divided cart
ridges with them, while Major O'Hara
took the exposed position on the left
with one i battery, heavier equipped,
The Callfornlans and what was left
of the Pennsylvanians held the center,
and the Caljfornians wer* at the ex
treme left, covering thÂ«Â» beach. Still
the battle raged. The Spanish fire, for
three hours, did not slacken percep
tibly, and there were forward rushes
after the reinforcements came up and
after the Utah Battery i had secured a
nÂ« w supply of ammunition, but there
never was a chance for Spanish success
after the regulars and the gallant First
reached the scene. The battle was won
when the fresh troops came up, the
battle of the Convent de Seledad,; al
though the Infanteriade- Marina died
hard. How ; hard wns seen from ; camp
to-day, when all the flags in Manila
â were at half-mast. *
â¢ And all < this time our allesred : allies;
the followers of Dictator â  Agnlnaldo,
were silent. There were, In fact, no
insurgent soldiers in the trenches that
night, although General Noreal was
supposed to cover the American right
at Fasay. This bears out some of the j
stories 1 have heard recently, stories of i
the disaffection of Aguinaldo, and pos- j
sibly it explains the conduct of the To
gallos, who have apparently lost all ;
their enthusiastic admiration for their j
American friends, i have heard that
Aguinaldo has come to distrust the in
teat of the Americans. The whole
world knows Aguinaldo for a purchas- :
able Knave, for sale to the highest bid- j
derâ and not at all ready to stay
bought.
The most trying position held by any
men in the American army all through
thut dark night was that of Major j
Sime's battalion on the second line of j
trenches. Exposed to the flre of the i
whole Spanish force, right in the dan- I
ger zone, where the bullets from the
Spanish Hanking party met the shells
from the Malate battery on o-ur left and I
the balls from the Spanish right and j
center,- his men, up to their waists in t
water collected in the abandoned in
surgent trenches, lying down under I
heavy punishment, compelled to see j
their comrades shot as they lay, yet un- '
able to tire a shot in return lest they j
shoot their comrades in the advanced ;
trenches by reaso-n of the darkness, the
boys of the Second Battalion were' as !
cool under the strain as a battalion of
Scotch Presbyterians. They laughed i
and chatted, but there was about them .
a grim earnestness which would have
boded ill for Spain if the boys had been
given their chance.
Un the extreme left, close to the
beach, where the sheen of the water j
gave some light. Senior Lieutenant !
Otto Huber, commanding: Company I ;
in the absence of Captain Richter, fired
three volleys over the heads of the reg
ulars lying down in the first trench j
and checked the Spanish advance at
that point. Then, when Huber ceased
firing, the regulars leaped to their feet
and the Spanish line at that point fell
back, broken all to pieces.
The sad side of war was shown
to me, later in the day, when the First
California buried poor Maurice Justh
and the Pennsylvanians buried their ,
six dead and one of the regulars killed ;
in one large grave. The little mound !
covering all that is mortal of First
Sergeant Justh stands a little to \he
right of the others, in the convent yard
at Maricabaji, under a spreading
acacia, and upon ths mound each day
some comrade places a small bunch of
flowers. Perhaps it was hysteria, pos
sibly the night of exposure in the
trenches and in the mud had produced
a physical reaction, yet I know that the
tears came to my eyes as the clods fell
upon the coffin, and that many were
gathered about that lonely grave in a
distant land, strong men, who wept j
freely. Justh was burled with all i
military honors, the officers and com
rades gathered about the grave and as
the chaplain of the Pennsylvania regi
ment closed the simple service the '
boys of his company began singing,
clear and high, "Nearer, My God, to
Thoe."
It was the one death coming home to
the Callfornians in th*> first battle be
fore Manila, although many were close \
to death. One narrow escane was that i
of Lieutenant Tobin, who, going down
the Cal!^ Real toward the front, had a
shell burst almost directly above his
head. Incidents like this could be
multiplied indefinitely. It is only nec
essary for each man who took part to
tell his story of the battle of the Con
vent de Soledad.
The Americans lost in battle nine
dead and forty-six wounded.
UNEVENTFUL VOYAGE
OF THE MONTEREY
Exceptionally Fine Weather Favored
the Monitor in Its Trip Across
the Pacific.
MANILA Aug. 4.â The United States
coast defense vessel Monterey and the
collier Brutus arrived here to-day with
all well on board, after a lons and un
eventful trip, having left San Fran
cisco on June 7 last and San Diego on
June 11. The trip was remarkable for
nothing save the wonderfully fine
weather that both vessels had all the
way over with the exception of one gale
on July 31. During this voyage of 7600
knots the Monterey was towed 3725
knots by the Brutus and two stops
were made, one at Honolulu, th 3 other
at the Island of Guan in the Marina
group. At each of these places the
Monterey was coaled, in Honolulu from
the shore and at Cuan from the Brutus.
As an experiment the trip has proved
nothing more than that with phenom
enally fine weather the vessel intended
for coast defense may with her own
steam and a tow cross the Pacific
Ocean. What tale there would have
been to tell had much rough weather
been encountered is of course another
story. There is reason to believe that
such a voyage can be made even in
heavy weather. And in the Pacific
Ocean it is always possible to choose a
route along which favorable weather
will probably be encountered.
ENLARGING SANTA FE
SHOPS AT ALBUQUERQUE
Will Be Expanded Until They Give
Employment to Fifteen Hun
dred Men.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Sept. 4.-
The Santa l'c Railway Company has in
creased li.c working force in its shops at
this place by the addition of log, men,
making the force now regularly employ
ed here a little over COO. Enlargements
and additions in the way of new build
ings and machinery are going on all the
time, and the superintendent of construc
tion states ti.at he has orders to rush 'â¢he
work of expansion as rapidly as possible
until the plant has a capacity for working
l. r ,OO men. The company determined some
months ago to concentrate all its build
ing and repair work at Topeka and Al
buquerque, making the shops at these
two places of equal capacity, and both
immense establishments. Since that
time the force here has been increased
from 2SO to over 600, and new men are be

STATE QUESTIONS
TO BE DETERMINED
Grave Matters Confront
the President.
WILL REPLY TO THE CZAR
SAMOA AND CANADA NEXT TO
BE CONSIDERED.
Then Will Come the Closing TJp of
the Peace Commission and Com
mencement of Work by
That Body.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Besides instructions to the
peace commissioners the President will
have several matters to dispose of upon
his return. He will have to prepare
an Instruction to the American Em
bassador at St. Petersburg in reply to
the invitation of the Czar to participate
in the disarmament co-nference. While
the administration officials with whom
I have talked look upon the Czar's
proposition as quixotic and not di
rectly applicable to the United States,
still there is no doubt .that the Presi
dent will find it desirable to approve of
the Czar's plan and to inform him that
an American representative will at
tend the conference.
A representative will also confer with
members of the Canadian commission
regarding its work and the concessions
it will make in return for equally val
uable favors.
The Samoan question, which Ger
many is trying to bring into life again,
will also have to be considered.
It can be stated oh excellent authority
that Justice White has not officially ac
cepted the appointment as a member
of the peace commission. I was told
to-day that the question is still open,
and this would seem to Indicate there
is a chance of Justice White accepting
a membership on the commission. It
is known, however, that President Mc-
Kinley has several other men in view
in case Justice White's declination
should be final. It is confidently be
lieved by the administration olllcials
now in Washington that the fifth mem
ber of the American commission will be
selected in the early part of this week,
and that the first session of the com
plete commission will be held at th*
State Department the latter part of the
week to study the important work be
fore it and receive instructions from
the President.

ENCAMPMENT OPENS TO-DAY
REFRESHING RAIN AFTER THE
HOT WAVE.
Already the Contests f or Commander
in-Chief and the Next Place
of Reunion Have
Becun.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Sept. 4.â Over 20,000
excursionists are estimated to have ar
rived here to-day for the thirty-second
national encampment of the Grand
Army of the Republic, which begins to
morrow. The depots and the streets
presented every appearance of the
great annual reunion as the excursion
ists arrived and were soon seeing the
sights.
No-ne of the posts arrived to-day in
bodies, and yet there were many uni
forms among the excursionists. Rain
In the morning made the day pleasant
for the early arrivals in visiting Camp
Sherman and other attractions, and
there is every indication that the hot
wave is over so far as this locality is
concerned. The arches and other struc
tures were illuminated again to-night
and thousands viewed the decorations.
The first parade occurs at 6 o'clock to
morrow morning, when the Naval Vet
erans form to escort Rear Admiral
Daniel F. Kelly and staff from the de
pot to the naval headquarters. The
local posts and others will form a pro
cession at the depot when Commander
in-Chief Gobin and staff arrive at 10:45
a. m. to-morrow and escort them to
their headquarters. The loca 1 ' posts
and naval veterans will be engaged all
day to-morrow.
Owing to his work in connection with
the Ohio special (hospital train) Gov
ernor Bushnell and staff will not arrive
until Tuesday evening, and like duties
with the sick Michigan soldiers will
prevent Governor Pingree and staff
from arriving until Wednesday morn
ing. The Governors of all States will
be met on their arrival with escorts.
The friends of Oolc-nel Fred D. Shaw
of New York, James A. Sexton of Illi
nois and I. E. Mack of Ohio are at work
early in the contest for commander in
chief and there is also a contest be
tween Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Denver
and other places for the next national
encampment. I
Assistant Secretary^of Agriculture J.
H Brigham is here from Washington
to participate in the reunion of his old
regiment, as is also Chaplain Couden
of the House of Representatives at
Washington.
In connection with the encampment
there will be an unusually large Labor
day demonstration here to-morrow.

LAST SAD RITES
OVER THE BODY
OF A VOLUNTEER
FuQeral of Captain Rjchter of the
First California F^egimeQt at
Camp Dewey.
Comrades Weep at trje Bier of a Brave Officer
Wr;o Fell in t\)e F orefro Ot of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BY SOL. N. SHERIDAN.
CAMP DEWET, Philippine Islands,
Aug. 5. â One of the saddest yet most
impressive functions in the world I
have just witnessed. Poor Rhinehold
Richter, captain of Company I, First
California, died of his wound received
in the battle of Sunday night at a lit
tle past 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The surgeons had been hopeful to the
last. He had regained consciousness
after being taken to the hospital, and
had expressed anxiety to get back to
his company. He wanted, he said, to
get up his company report for the
month. He did not know, even then,
that the dark waters were closing over
him. His friends were more anxious
than himself.
On the day before yesterday it be
came apparent that the end was near.
He had intervals of delirium and
Father McKinnon gave him the last
consolations of the church. This was
one more touching incident In connec
tion with the death of the brave sol
dier. Captain Kichter was born and
bred in the Roman Catholic faith. As
he grew to manhood he had, like so
many men, neglected his religious du
ties. Father McKinnon, himself a good
man, saw the good that was born In
Richter and aeUrfimself to win the wan
dering one back to the faith. It was
not a task attended with great diffi
culty. On Saturday night the two had
their last discourse upon religious top
ics. On Sunday night Rhinehold Rich
ter was stricken down in battle. It is
one of those strange coincidences, to
give it no other name, which make men
of little or no faith come to pause in
the attention they give solely to affairs
of the world.
The bullet that caused Captain
Richter's death entered his skull. When
picked up, within live minutes of
being wounded, he was in a mori
bund condition. His wound was dressed
on the Held and he was hurried back
to the brigade hospital. After the sur
geons trephined and elevated the de
pressed bc/ne he regained conscious
ness for a few hours, but the injury
to the brain was too great and with
the symptoms of inflammation uncon
scic-usness ensued and death followed
three days and a half later.
The end came peacefully. Colonel
Smith announced to the regiment that
the funeral would be held at 10 a. m.
to-day, and under the great" mango
tree in front of the headquarters tent
Father McKinnon had erected an al
tar â fit altar to the God who
created a temple of such beauty. Here
with the officers of his regiment
grouped about the bier and the brown
clad men of the ranks standing, file
after file,, reposed in a coffin of Span
ish cedar all that was mortal of the
comrade dead.
, The ceremony and the funeral ora
tion delivered by Father McKinnon
was most impressive. Those who were
nearest to him, those who had known
the dead man best, wept as strong
men weep, with great sobs that seemed
about to wrench their frames apart,
and in the eyes of all those present the
tears were standing when the utter
loneliness of the widow and orphans,
who would never see the loved one
again, was gently touched upon.
After the military mass six com
rades took the coffin upon their should
ers and the whole regiment moved to
the plot of ground beside the muddy
Pasanaque River, where the Govern
ment has secured ground for a ceme
tery. It is a bit of waste land, not
even a' tree upon it, but the whole
place is fragrant with spearmint and
there are possibilities that it may be
made a place of beauty hereafter. The
rain, which has ben falling almost
without cessation for days past, held off
during the ceremony under the mango
tree. It came upon us as we marched
to the oetnetery and ceased again as
the first clods fell upon the coffin. The
camp has been a camp of sorrow all
day. It will be a camp of sorrow for
many days, for the memory of the
comrade dead will not die, although he
is gone. He was a brave man, and he
gave his life for his country. No

were unloaded from the vessels by the
naked men, is rather the laughing
stock of the camp. There is good ma
terial there, nevertheless, and the men
have reloaded the shells for the wicked
little guns. They will give a good ac
count of themselves yet, when the final
assault upon Manila Is made.
BAYARD'S CONDITION
IS VERY CRITICAL
Former Embassador to England Suf-
fering From Debility, Aggra-
v ated by Extreme Heat.
DEDHAM, Mass., Sept. 4.â The condition
of Thomas F. Bayard, former Embas
sador to England, who is at Karlstein,
the home of his daughter, Mrs. Warren,
was critical to-day. So pronounced has
been the change in *.ie past two or three
days that it was thought the patient could
not survive many days.
Mr. Bayard came to Karlstein, the
summer horns of Mr. and Mrs. S. F.
Warren, about three weeks ago. His
health was not good, and during the first
two weeks It did not Improve. A week ago
a change came which appeared to be a
gradual breaking up of the system com
bined with kidney trouble. At first it was
not thought likely that his case would
prove serious, although it was admitted
by those in attendance that the end of a
groat career was not far off. The extreme
hfat of the past few days has had a de
pressing effect upon the patient, and on
Fr.day anxiety was keenly felt. A con
sultation of physicians was held. Late on
Friday a favorp.ble turn was noteu, but
vosterday the change was for the worse.
To-day he was semi-conscious, with a
fair pulse.
SALT LAKE MOURNS.

AUGUST BROKE ThJE RECORD.
AUGUST made a brilliant trade record. Its
clearings were the largest ever known in that
month and were 23 per cent heavier than in
August, 1892, the year preceding the panic. Its fail
ures were the smallest for live years, and their ratio
to solvent business was only $108 70 in $100,000.
As August is usually the quietest month in the year
this heavy increase in business has attracted atten
tion, and it has been found that while much of it was
due to the resumption of contracts suspended on the
outbreak of the war and to, heavy purchases of se
curities, it has been definitely ascertained that the
major part of the increase was due to a legitimate
expansion of domestic trade, such as the distribution
of manufactured goods, provisions, etc. The in
crease is the more noteworthy when it is considered
that prices, being much lower than in 1892, just so
much more business is necessary to produce the re
markable gain in the bank clearings mentioned above.
The bankers and financial authorities of the East
have all along been predicting a pronounced increase
in trade, and it seems that they are right. They are
now predicting a further increase as the fall advances,
and it is to be hoped that they will be right in this
case, too. Certainly present signs indicate continued
improvement. Reports to the recognized commercial
authorities show a brisk fall opening all along the
line, except in the extreme East, which has been
dragging more or less for several months. The
West and Northwest still lead the rest of the coun
try, and are doing a large business in boot, and
shoes, hats and caps, machinery, hardware, clothing
and similar lines. In the South a good cotton crop
and slightly firmer prices give that section a strong
tone, and a slight advance in print cloths at Fall
River tends to infuse more animation into the trade
circles of New England. As for the iron and steel
trade, it continues to keep up its phenomenal record,
and the mills, especially in the West, report themselves
unable to fill all their orders. Wheat shipments from
Atlantic points continue to fall behind those of last
year, those for the past week being 3,687,000 bushels,
against 6,265.000 for the same week in 1897. The
other staples show no new features worthy of note.
The woolen mills report rather better orders, though
their purchases of wool are restricted by the tenacity
of Western holders in asking more than the
condition of the Eastern markets justifies.
Wall street shows a slight reaction from the ab
normal activity which has prevailed for the past two
or three weeks. There is less disposition to specu
late, even in Government bonds, and a small decline
in prices of many securities is apparent. But no im
portance is attached to this lull, as it is considered
merely one of the regular breathing spells of this
high pressure mart.
In California conditions remain very much the
same as for several months, and no particular ten
dency in any direction is apparent. Wheat has shown
rather more animation during the past week, but this
was due to the covr-ing of contracts by the Produce
Exchange shorts rather than to any intrinsic strength
in the cereal. As soon as the shorts were covered
the price, which had advanced sharply for a day or
two, fell back again under decreased trading. Still,
the market is in better shape than for some little
time. Barley has advanced somewhat, but oats have
declined. Hay is lower under enormous receipts, as
the farmers have been rushing it in to escape the pos
sible early rains, which everybody seems to be ex
pecting this fall â for what reason nobody seems to
know, except that last winter was a dry one â if there
be any reason in such reasoning.
The fruit trade has held up remarkably well this
year, and prices are even higher than they were some
weeks ago. With the exception of prunes, which
have not opened yet, quotations for dried fruits are
extremely high, and at the rate buyers have been lay
ing in supplies there will be little stock left in the
State by Christmas. The output of canned fruit has
also been small this season, so there will be no sur
plus of any kind of fruit in California this year. This
means a good market for fruit next year, though it
is not to be expected that prices will range as high
as they have this season.
Importers and jobbers of merchandise report trade
fair for the season and collections average. The
money market is tame and without feature, there
being plenty of funds for all solvent borrowers at the
usual rates of interest.
The foreman at the Wclls-Fargo building upon
whose head a metal casting weighing fifteen pounds
alighted after a fall of six stories is to be congratu
lated that he was not hurt. Neither was the casting
fractured.
The "war board" of Los Angeles will probably
have its hands full in inducing Colonel Berry to sub
scribe to a gcacc protocol.
MR. GAGE fJT LOS ANGELES.
THE address of Henry T. Gage at Los Angeles
on Saturday evening in response to the cordial
welcome of thousands of his neighbors greeting
him on his Teturn home as the chosen standard
bearer of the Republicans of California may be ac
counted in some respects as the opening of the
Republican campaign, and as such will be given care
ful consideration by all intelligent voters.
In its form the speech is not that of a campaign
oration. It was not intended to be so. It was the
talk of a man to his friends and has all the fluent
ease of conversation. At the outset the speaker put
himself in the attitude of a friend talking to friends,
and said to them frankly: "During the time that I
have moved in your midst you know whether I have
walked as an honorable, upright citizen or not. If
I have failed anywhere to comply with the dictates
of common honesty or common manhood, I implore
you at the coming election to cast a vote against me
and not for me."
Beginning with that straight, direct statement of
his life among them, Mr. Gage went on to talk to his
Los Angeles fellow-citizens of the issues of the cam
paign with an equal terseness and directness. As a
matter of course he referred to the attack made upon
him by Maguire during that gentleman's recent visit
to Los Angeles, and with a keen wit exposed both the
absurdities and the dangers of the candidacy of the
leader of what Senator Bulla felicitously called "the
amalgamated errors."
It was in those portions of his speech that the Re
publican candidate for Governor showed himself at
his best. It has been so frequently boasted by the
Democrats and the Populists that Maguire is invin-
cible on the stump, that this demonstration of the
ability of Mr. Gage to refute his sophisms by strong
argument, and to turn aside his ridicule with ready
wit, will carry confusion into the ranks of the fac
tions. It will not be surprising after this if the course
of the campaign should prove that Mr. Gage is not
only a safer citizen, a better business man and more
fitted for the office of Governor 4 han his versatile
opponent, but even a better campaign debater.
Certainly in the first conflict between the two the
honors have* been won by Mr. Gage. He has riddled
Maguire's Los Angeles speech, and has furnished
the Republicans of the State with as good a campaign
document as could be dqsired. The State convention
clearly chose the right man for the work before him.
He will not only be a good Governor, but he is going
to be a good fighter as well as leader in the con
test for conservatism and prosperity against erratic
theorists and political confusion.
THE GERMANS IN SYRIA.
REPORTS that the Governments of Great
Britain and Germany have arranged for joint
action and co-operation in Egypt and in Syria,
with a proviso for an offensive and defensive alliance
under certain conditions, will occasion no surprise.
Such an agreement has been long foreshadowed, not
only byÂ»speeches of British statesmen, but by the
drift of events, which for years past have tended to
make some alliance necessary to both countries.
The time has gone by when British statesmen ex
ulted in a separation from European alliances and
boasted of the '"splendid isolation" of their kingdom.
The mighty coalitions of the Continent have made it
evident to them that, strong as Great Britain is, she
will need a friend when the shock comes, and, more
over, that the knowledge of her having a strong ally
may prevent the shock from coming at all. Germany
is naturally the Government to which the British
would look for an alliance, and it so happens that re
cent developments of German energy have brought
about a situation that renders British friendship about
as important to the Germans as their friendship to
the British.
One of the most forceful and far-reaching move
ments which has taken place in Europe and Asia
Minor in recent years has been the influx of German
energy, German capital and German commerce into
the Turkish empire. The movement has been a
silent one, and until a few years ago was not much
noted. Then it was suddenly discovered by an inves
tigator at Vienna that while the Russians had been
seeking a dominating influence in the Balkan Penin
sula and over Turkish territory generally by diplo
matic methods, the Germans had been building rail
roads, starting factories, extending commerce and
absorbing the banking business of the people of those
countries. The Turkish problem, therefore, assumes
a new phase, and it is now German industry in place
of British diplomacy that stands as an antagonist to
Russian domination around Constantinople.
If it turn out that the terms of the treaty are such
as have been reported the chief public interest in it
will lie in that portion which relates to these German
interests in Syria. The world has long since accepted
British domination in Egypt as a settled fact, and the
agreement of Germany to co-operate in maintaining
it does not materially alter the situation. The agree
ment with respect to Syria, however, is a new thing
altogether. It creates a condition never before in
existence, and may prove to be the beginning of a
movement that will have a worldwide effect, changing
and sweeping away every aspect of international re
lations as seen to-day.
That German supremacy in Syria would be of im
mense benefit to the people of that country and in
directly to the whole world cannot be questioned. It
would carry into those rich lands and among those
sluggish, tax-oppressed communities the law, the or
der, the industry and the science of one of the master
races of the globe. It would prepare a way for the
eventual redemption of all Asia Minor, a region that
was once powerful in the world, and would assure to
Europe a protection against the menacing advance of
the colossal despotism of Russia toward Constan
tinople.
LABOR'S FESTAL DOY.
LABOR in the United States will awake this
morning to the enjoyment of the day set
apart for the annual celebration of the accom
plishments of industry and a recognition of the honor
due to the workingmen by whom that industry is
carried on. It, is, moreover, a day which all citizens
should observe as far as possible, for in American
society we have few idlers; nearly all men are
workers, and all have a clear understanding of the
high position labor rightly holds in every civilized
community.
The date selected for Labor day is somewhat un
fortunate. It falls so near the date of Admis
sion day that it is lost sight of by a good many
people who are engaged in preparations for the cele
bration of what is distinctively California's natal festi
val. In addition to this there is the further draw
back that there is a California Labor day to be cele
brated later in the year, and that fact confuses the
public to some extent.
The conditions of industry throughout the com
monwealth are as a rule favorable to the celebration
this year. The farmers, indeed, have suffered from
droughts, but the prices of all farm products have
been good, and on the whole the crops have been re
.munerativc. The restoration of the protective tariff
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1898.
has revived all manufacturing trades, and the main
tenance of the gold standard provides every worker
with wages of the highest purchasing power.
The war with Spain, while of little magnitude itself,
has opened before the nation wide fields for expand
ing commerce, and that in turn will call for increased
activity in all lines of industry. The Pacific Coast
will reap a large share of the increasing profits of the
new trade, and our workingmen will be among the
first and largest beneficiaries. All the prospects of
the future, therefore, as well as all the conditions of
the present, cheer the hearts and the homes of our
workers, and it will be with joyous voices they hail
one another as they assemble to do honor to their
crafts and celebrate the festival of their labor.
I â J OR some time past it has been apparent that the
j yellow press of copperhead tendencies is trying
*â  to make political capital for the factions it sup
ports as well as sensations for readers of depraved
tastes by describing the various military camps of the
country as plague spots, and asserting that the War
Department of the Government has been criminally
neglectful of the welfare of the sick and suffering
soldiers.
These charges from comparatively small beginnings
have now gone to the extreme of malignant lying.
The officials of the army have been accused of of
fenses which morally amount to murder. The coun
try has been excited by fearful reports of disease,
pestilence, starvation and cruelty in the camps of the
volunteers, and women whose sons, brothers and
husbands are among the soldiers have been in many
cases driven half distracted by the anxieties and fears
the reports have caused.
The outrage of this vicious attack upon the admin
istration' is augmented by the fact that the very pa
pers whose yellow instincts now prompt them to the
circulation of the lies were but a short time ago
clamorous against the Government for not sending
the troops to Cuba without even a month of prepara
tion for the campaign. If papers of the type of the
New York Journal and its Hearstiform appendix, the
Examiner, could have had their way, the President
would have been forced to dispatch troops to the
tropical jungles of the West Indies as fast as they
could be hurried to the front, and set without equip
ments to the task of besieging Havana as well as
of capturing Santiago.
The main cause of the hardships borne by the vol
unteers during the war was the utter unpreparedness
of the nation for undertaking such a campaign within
the short time between the outbreak of hostilities and
the beginning of the sickly season in Cuba, For that
military deficiency the Democratic party is mainly to
blame. For years past the representatives of that
party in Congress have opposed every measure de
signed to increase the strength of the army or im-
prove its equipments. It would be a grotesque mock
ciy of justice if a party which has always denounced
all efforts to strengthen the military power of the
country should now gain an advantage in politics by
reason of the evil that has befallen the nation through
the iack of a larger army.
It is 'gratifying to be able to say that up to this time
no Democrat of national reputation has made him
self in any way responsible for the foul campaign
started on this subject by the yellow journals. On
the contrary, such Democrats as General Lee and
General Wheeler, who have nobly borne their part in
the battles for the nation, have been foremost in re
futing the slanders. At present the ocherous editors
have it all to themselves, and they only are. to be con
demned by an indignant public.
It must be remembered, however, that we are on
the eve of a , olitical campaign whose genuine issues
afford, no re?dy topics for the professional agitator,
the calamity howler and the venomous copperhead.
To these classes of stump orators the stories started
by the yellow fakers will be as acceptable as a gift
from the devil himself, and before long we may ex
pect to hear them ringing from every platform
around which can be gathered a rabble to listen to'
them.
TRAVELING LIBRARIES OGAIN.
NOW that the time is approaching for the elec
tion of a new Legislature all persons who are
interested in the advancement of the general
culture of the State can with advantage press upon
the attention of legislative candidates the importance
of enacting a law which will permit the use of the
State library in providing for California a traveling
library system similar to that which has accom
plished so much good in New York and other pro
gressive States of the East.
To establish and maintain such a system will not
entail any considerable expenditure on the part of
the State, while it will confer a great benefit upon all
sections, and particularly upon those where no pub
lic library exists. At present the volumes in the
State library are of very little use to any one, and
of no use at all to the great majority who are taxed
to sustain the institution. By providing for traveling
libraries a considerable proportion of these volumes
now unused could be put into general circulation
and made available for the reading and the study of
the great masses of the people.
As has been repeatedly pointed out by The Call,
the operation of the system is simple. A number of
books useful for reading and study by those persons
who wish something better than the cheap novels
that are now so plentiful could be classified by the
State library trustees into sets containing anywhere
from twenty-five to one hundred volumes. These
sets would be sent to any part of the State where
three or more taxpayers would guarantee the freight
charges and be responsible for the safe-keeping of the
books. When a set had been read in one locality it
would be passed on to another, and thus the expense
of shipping would be very little.
Traveling libraries, it must be borne in mind, have
parsed beyond the experimental stage. They have
been in active operation in several Eastern States for
a number of years, and the success achieved has been
remarkable. The trustees of our library could ob
tain from the East abundant information concerning
every detail of the working of the system and learn
exactly how to put it into operation here without
running the least risk of losing the books or involv
ing the State in heavy expense.
Until the Legislature so authorizes the State li
brary cannot be used for the proposed purpose. It
is for that reason that advocates of the system and
all who wish to give the whole people a fair and free
use of the books bought with their money should at
once impress upon all candidates for the Senate or
the Assembly the expediency of enacting the require!
legislation this winter.
The question is one of considerable importance, for
owing to the widely scattered condition of the popu
lation there are thousands of cultured Californians
who are out of reach of a public library, and it i?
but justice to expand and extend that at Sacramento
so that they may profit by its volumes.
Correspondents seem to have absorbed the notion
that the world is wrapped in anxiety as to the divorce
of old General Clay. But it isn't
YELLOW COPPERHEADS.
MAGUIRE CRITICIZES GAGE.
I have read the speech of Mr. Gage [
delivered in Los Angeles on Saturday .â 
evening. I was greatly surprised by its I
tone as well as by much of its matter. |
It seems to me that he displayed unrea- !
sonable anger at my pleasant allusions to i
his Sacramento speech, which he con
strued to be abusive "verbiage."
As to hiÃ personal criticisms of myself j
and of opinions held by me on questions j
not involved in the campaign, I shall have
nothing to say. How far a candidate for
Governor may properly proceed in such |
personal denunciation is wholly a mat- ;
ter of propriety which must be deter- ;
mined by each candidate according to tvS f
own taste and judgment. For my own j
part, I have always avoided personal at
tacks and have refused to notice them !
except under great provocation. I choose i
to deal only with his discussion of ques- |
tions of fact and of principle involved in
the campaign.
Referring to the passage of the funding
bill at the last session of the present Con
gress, Mr. Gage is â¢reported as saying:
"We had no opportunity to vote upon
that question, but there came a time j
when James G. Maguire occupied a place
in the Congress of the United States
when he could have voted upon it. A i
short time ago, you remember, a law in !
reference to that matter was adopted in j
the United States Senate, and it passed j
the Congress. James G. Maguire stood
there, and had he raised his voice, had !
he simply said, 'Mr. Chairman, I ob- |
ject to the consideration of that bill," it |
never could have been considered. He i
made no such objection. Then what right
has he to stand upon the rostrum to-day !
and assail the acts of that body? Tell i
me, if you can, as honest, fair-minded
citizens, whether that conduct becomes
an hottest official or not?"
Is it possible that Mr. Gage knows so i
little of Congressional procedure as to I
believe that statement? But he must !
have been deceived into believing it, i
as otherwise he would certainly not have !
repeated it. Does he not know that the
refunding provision in question came
back to the House from the Senate as a
part of the general deficiency bill? That
general deficiency bill carried appropria- !
tions to \he amount of nearly $220,000,000 j
to meet deficiencies already incurred for !
the support of the army and navy of the !
Lnited States. Does he imagine that a j
single objection from anybody could nave j
prevented the House of Representatives i
from voting on that bill or from voting on
the question of concurring or non-con
curring in the Senate amendment? Does
he imagine that the House of Representa
tives is such an impotent or imbecile body
as to be paralyzed and prevented from
making: appropriations for the support of ,
the army and navy in time of war by a j
single objection, or by a hunured objec
tions, to the consideration of an appro
priation bill? The proposition is so absurd
that its very statement should have con
vinced him of its incorrectness. Mr. Gage
has been grossly deceived in this matter. '
The fact is that there was no possibility i
of either defeating- the refunding provi- I
slon or of striking it from the general de- i
flciency bill except by a majority vote of
the members of the House present at the |
time of its consideration.
As to Mr. Gage's deduction concerning I
my official honesty, based upon his belief
that I could have defeated the refunding '
provision by simply saying "Mr. Chair- i
man, I object to the consideration of that '
bill," I presume he will withdraw his de- 1
duction when he discovers that he has i
been imposed upon concerning the facts I
His suggestion that "a drunken man j
sometimes has better sense than the lead- i
er of his party" I must, of course, pass
without notice.
Again, Mr. Gage, referring to me, says: j
"He may not have said, as the Republi- !
can platform declares he did. that the
taking of Spanish ships by American sail
ors was an act of piracy, but he did thisâ ;
he stood there in Congress talking and j
THE TSUNG LI YAMEN.
The average newspaper reader who reads a good deal of heated Inter
views between foreign envoys and the Tsung Li Yamen may be excused
if he feels slightly mystified as to the nature of the latter body with its
outlandish name.
The Tsung Li Yamen is, In fact, the Chinese Foreign Office. In times
gone by the Chinese Kmperor (or the "Son of Heaven," as he calls himself)
scorned to receive the foreign Ministers (or "outer barbarians"), and all
matters relating to other countries were handed over to Li Van Yuen, a de
partment of the Ministry of Kites, which dealt with dependent and tribu
tary nations, the pleasant Chinese theory being that all foreign people are
subjects of the great Emperor.
But the joint Anglo-French expedition of IS6I rather upset this idea of
imperial dignity, and a special foreign board (the Tsung Li Yamen) was
established as a medium between the sovereign and western states. It
started off with three members, the chief of whom was the famous Prince
Kung, a younger brother of the then reigning Emperor; in 1862 four more
members were added, and in 1869 the number was raised to ten, while in
more recent times it has varied between eight and twelve.
No one knows on what principles the members are selected, and being
chosen from the War Office, the ceremonial and even the criminal depart
ments, they display a delightful ignorance of their own especial line of
business. According to one writer, Austria and Holland are hopelessly
mixed up in their mind. They had never heard of Tunis, and as for their
late war they were firm on the point that only their freedom from the rail
way pest had saved Peking from capture.
Their methods of transacting important diplomatic business knock the
"new diplomacy" Into a cocked hat. They sit around a table loaded with
sweetmeats, while attendants hand round cups of tea to the foreign diplo
matic "devils," and any other visitors who may care to drop in. Then
there are secretaries and attendants and pipe bearers; and at this splendid
free-and-easy the diplomatic situation is discussed.
The foreign Minister is invited to argue the whole matter out with the
board, and then tremendous discussion takes place, which is largely a mat
ter of lung power and physical endurance, for aH the Tsuntr Li Yamen go
at him at the simp time (all speaking together), and if the foreigner is not
in good condition it's a hopeless case for him altogether.
The board never makes a decision if It can possibly help it. It will argue
your head off If you like, but no resolution, if you please. Everbody 1
anxious to put the responsibility on everybody else, and bent on putting off
his final day of judgment to as remote a period as possible. "To get a de
cision from the Tsung Li Yamen," said one unhappy diplomatist, "is like
trying to draw water from a well with a bottomless bucket."
Between the foreign devils and the deep sea of Imperial displeasure the
poor old Tsung Li Yamen must be having a warm time at the present mo
ment. I should not forget to say that they occasionally go out visitine
the foreign envoys, but It will go hard with them if the patriotic Chinese
small boy catches them at the game; mud and stones are sent flying at
them in awkward quantities. But every year they give an annual banquet
at their official residence to all the diplomatic corps. c E

NEWS OF FOREIGN ' NAVIES.
Japan has ordered five torpedo-boat
destroyers of 360 tons and 31 knots speed,
to be built by Yarrow at Poplar, England.
The mortality In the British navy dur
ing 1897 was remarkably low. The total
strength afloat, embracing officers, blue
voting along lines opposite to those from
which American bullets were flying."
That Is a serious statement which Mr.
Gage should be able to substantiate by
producing or referring to the Congression
al Record. It is sufficiently serious to
justify if not to require him to Quote the
language used by me in talking along
lines â¢'opposite to those from which
American bullets were flying." and to re
fer specifically to the votes which he says
were cast along those lines.
Mr. Gage has been deceived in this mat
ter. Evidently he does not examine the
Congressional Record himself.
He further says that I "voted against
the revenue bill." That is true. The rev
enue bill imposed substantially the entire
burden of the war upon the poor, and
comparatively poor, people of our coun
try. I opposed not the raising of revenue,
as he intimates, but the Republican meth
od of raising revenue, which involved the
exemption of the accumulated wealth and j
great incomes of the country from taxa- j
tion while imposing the burden of the war
upon the poor.
Again, still referring to me, he says:
"He voted against the bill that was to
prov.^e our sailors and our soldiers with
drugs, with clothing and with general
sustenance." I trust that he will in his
next speech designate the bill to which
he refers and the record of my votÂ«
against it. I say to him that in this mat
ter also he has been grossly deceived;
that I voted for every bill providing for I
food, clothing, medicine and all other
supplies for our sailors and soldiers. I
further say that, by the votes of the
Democrats, Republicans and Populists in
Congress, ample provision was made for
supplying our soldiers and sailors with
all these things in abundance, and that,
in so far as they have suffered for lack
of these things, It has been due to mal
administration or to inefficient adminis
tration.
He charges me with responsibility in
some measure with the Cleveland bond
issue of two hundred and sixty-two mil
lion dollars. If he will examine the rec
ord he will discover that I denounced that
bond issue and denounced the method
adopted for the sale of the bonds. And
I reiterate the statement that, in my
opinion, the recent Republican bond Is
sue was unnecessary, and could not have
become necessary before the next session
of the present Congress when, if the war
continued, it might or might not be nec
essary to issue the bonds.
Bonds have been sold to the amount of
$200,000,000 within the last sixty clays; and
it will be found, when Congress assem
bles in December next, that there will
be an available surplus In the Treasury
of nearly, If not quite, $300,000,000, with the
power vested in the President tp raise
$100,000,000 additional on temporary certifi
cates drawn against the revenue expected
during the present fiscal year from the
war tax.
Mr. Gage complains of my statement to
the effect that the late Republican State
convention wnÃ dominated by railroad in
fluence, and asks upon what authority I
make that statement. I made the state
ment largely upon observation: upon the
reported notorious liberality of the rail
road company with respect to the trans
portation of delegates and others to at
tend the convention; upon the statements
maae by leading Republican newspapers
of California (notably the San Francisco
Call) during the three weeks preceding
the meeting of the convention upon the
fact that every person known to be the
choice of the Southern Pacific Company
for nomination was duly nominated by
the convention and upon the fact that
the entire Republican Stato ticket, includ
ing all candidates for State offices, all
candidates for the offices of Railroad
Commissioner, members of the Board of
Equalization and Representative in Con
gress was selected and publicly announced
before the convention had considered the
nomination of any candidate for any of
fice.
If Mr. Gage will look to the columns of
the San Francisco Call of August 24, IS9B
(published early on that morning and long
before the convention had considered any
candidate for office), he will find the en
tire ticket, as afterward nominated, duly
published. Where did The Call get the
ticket? JAMES G. MAGUIRE.

The Ariel, torpedo-boat destroyer of 300
tons, built by Thorneycroft. has had
three hours' trial on August 9. In con
fÂ£ m? !!2 r . tvt v the custom of steam trials in
the British navy the vessel was flying over
eight Inches light, and with 5650 horse
power made an average of 29.92 knots per
hour. v
Oil fuel was used at sea for the first
time in the British navy in an experi
mental cruise of the new torpedo-boat
destroyer Surey last month. Two boilers
were flred with oil fuel and two with coal
but the trial was disappointing in giving
only 14 knots speed when 16 knots was
expected. The experiment, however, will
not be abandoned.
The great firm of Schneider & Co. at
Creusot, France, is almost as important
to the Government as a couple of the
regular dockyards. Since 1539 the firm
has built about 170 marine engines for
war vessels and 110 engines for merchant
ships on ocean, lakes and rivers. The
first engine was for the corvette Pluton
of 660 horsepower, and it has now in hand
the engines of 19,600 horsepower for the
armored cruiser Dupetit Thiers.
The Neptune Salvage Company of
Stockholm has entered into a contract
with the Russian Government to raise the
turret-ship Gassgoot, which sank in the
bay of Bothnia last year. The ship lies
on her side in ninety-six feet of water,
imbedded in twenty feet of mud. For the
successful raising of the ship the con
tractors are to receive $712,000, and in the
event of failure the Russian Govern
ment agrees to pay $200,000 for the ef
forts made.
The London Engineer of August 12, in
a review of the battle of Santiago, ex
presses the opinion that "the Spaniard
had not a chance." This is somewhat at
variance with its comparative tables last
April of the Spanish and American
navies. The Engineer then proved, to Its
owq satisfaction, that tbÂ« Spanish aavy
was superior to the American in speed ana
power of guns, but since the battle re
ferred to has proved the contrary to be
the facts, the Engineer disposes of th*
subject by asserting that "the Spaniards
had not a chance." : -
The British cruiser Vindictive, built at
Chatham, had her full power trial of
eight hours on August 6. The ship was
five Inches light and made a speed, by
log, Qi 20.1 knots, the engines developing
10,262 horsepower. The Vindictive of SSOO .
tons and three others also built at dock-
yards during 18SW-98 somewhat resemble
the United States steamer Olympia ..in
so far as relates to size, but the British,
cruisers are far inferior to the American. :
in speed and armament. The Olympia
has developed 17.363 horsepower and a
speed of 21.69 knots, and her armament of .
four S-lnch and ten 5-inch quick firers fit ;
the main battery is twice as efficient as\
the Vindictive type carrying four 6-inch
and six 4-7-inch quick flrl- guns. .
The French Minister of Marine, Mr. :
Loekroy, has determined to carry into ;
effect certain reforms essential to the
usefulness of the navy. Being a civilian â 
he is, of course, greatly hampered in .
carrying out his plans, for the legions of
official functionaries constituting the
bureaucracy is content to let things go as
they are and always have been goings
but the younger naval officers are heart. .
and soul with Mr. Loekroy. Experiences,
of the recent Spanish-American war will
be taken advantage of, among which are
the elimination of interior woodwork in .
ships and a departure in torpedo-boat â 
building by adopting the American style -
and size of 120 to 160 tons, instead of the '
86-ton type, which is entirely useless In /
rough water. The squadrons in the Pa
cific and China waters are now composed ..
of vessels little superior to the Spanish
fleet which Dewev so easily destroyed,
and more modern and efficient ships will
be sent out to these stations, without .
which the French colonies in Asia would
be practically defenseless.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENTâ Miss J. C...
Clement, Cal. Capital punishment haa
been abolished in the States of Michi
gan, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Maine
and Colorado. The reason of the
abolishment of capital punishment is that
it Is believed that life imprisonment is a
punishment that is more dreaded than
hanging and will prove more of a deter
rent to those who contemplate the com
mission of a high crime. The argument
is also advanced by the friends of the
abolishment of capital punishment that it
has occurred that innocent individuals
have been hanged, and that it is to avoid
the possibility of such mistakes that im
prisonment should be substituted, be
cause if it should be discovered that the
individual has been convicted but was in
nocent, he could be released and com
pensated for his sufferings. The effect of
the abolition of capital punishment as to
crime is not yet decided enough to prove
that such a course is advisable or un
advisable.

Elaine. Elk, Mendocino County, Cal. It
was William Haynes Lytle, born In Cln

touching poem, "I Am Dying, Egypt, Dy

are from "Antony and Cleopatra," act 4,
scene 13, and are spoken by Antony, who
says :
I am dying, Epypt, dying,
Give me some wine and let me speak a
little.
Lytle was one of a number of brilliant
young writers whose early ambition was

H. H. ELVERSON STILL ALIVE
HIS NAME GIVEN TO A. DEAD
COMRADE.
A. Grave in the Nation's Ceme
tery That Contains the Body
of an Unnamed
Hero.
Tl> died and was burled, and Is alive
a pain.
These are the facts in the life of Private
Harry H. Elverson of Company A. Tenth
Pennsylvania Regiment. This statement
appears to be a paradox, but It is not,
for the death register of the division
field hospital sets forth that Elvera >n
died at the French Hospital on July 21 of
pneumonia, and the .certificates of death
and burial were duly signed and for
"warded through the proper channels to
the War Department at AYashlngton,
â where the name of Private Elverson was
erased from the living and consigned to
the list of those heroes who died in de
fense of Old Glory. After having de
parted this life and Fojourned in the
celestial realms for the brief space of two
â¢weeks. Private Elverson decided *.;at he
was not just ready for his gold â¢ i harp
and milk and Money diet. He p. (erred
the beans and bficon of his soldier:-' men,
and besides the angels were not congenial
to him, so he decided to return, and the
first of last month ho awoke from the de
lirium of fever that had attended his ill
ness, and when the nurse asked him is
name he stated that he was Private
Elverson of the Tenth Pennsylvania Regi
ment. The attendant told him that he
was mistaken, and by way of explana
tion tried to prove to him that he had
been gathered to hi a fathers pome two
weeks past, but Elverson would not
have it, and he stoutly maintained that
he had been a corpse long enough and
that he wanted to be a soldier, and that
the nurse might talk until he was black

know what could be done under the cir
cumstances, for dead Elverson was. and
buried, to make matters worse, and the
War Department had boon so informed
and there was no hope for it. This was a
woeful dilemma for the young soldier, but
he sent for his company commander and
proved his identity and was permitted to
take his' place once again among the liv
ing.
But the story does not end here for it
appears that if Eiverson was not dead
and buried, then some soldier had dit>d
and been buried under his name, and if
such was the case, the question that Was
before the medical authorities was, who
was the soldier who had passed for El
verson. iiere lies the mystery that the
medical officers must explain. The facts
in the case are meagre, but such as they
are they show that some soldier died and
was buried as Elverson.
It appears that at the time the Penn
sylvania soldier was taken to the French
Hospital another soldier from some other
command was also taken to the same in
stitution at the same lime. On tho way
-i'ital or .iust after be arrived
there this man died, and In some man- j
nor. which no onr- seems aMo to explain, I
the doctors of the hospital ascertained
that the dead man's name was Elverson
and so reported the death to the division
hospital. It is said that the man died
in the ambulance while being transforrod
to the hospital and that the drlvor of the
ambulance told the doctor in charge that
the man's name was Elverson. Ho that
as It may, the man was buried under El
verson's name, and tho record of his d^ath
and burial forwarded to the War Depart
ment. After he recovered Elverson was
transferred to the division hospital at the
Presidio as a convalescent where he now
is as lively as a cricket and none the
â¢worse for his two weeks of non-exlstencf.
Inquiry at the division hospital does not
reveal the name of the soldier who died
and was buried as Elverson, and no one
peems to be able to throw any light upon
the identity of this unknown hero. Ei
verson stated yesterday that he did not
know who the soldier was, but that it was
not himFclf. and that was all he was
positively certain of. I
.Eiverson Is from near Pittsburg, and
after it was learned by his friends at
home that he really was not dead he was
the dally recipient of a lr.rgo mail, in
which he was told what his friends had
paid and thought of him after his death,
and to use his ,own expression. "It is
worth dying for two weeks to find out
how good and howmeany our friends think
you are." ___________^__

FRANK TYRRELL EXCORIATED

Characterized as a Bully and a Hood

The Judge, in passing sentence of $200

the defendant, said:
"This defendant on Wednesday even-

the purpose of seizing a valuable spaniel
belonging to Mr. Tassi.
"The butcher-shop, of Tassi at the said

The defendant in the presence of the

was asked by a number of citizens who

on account of the presence of women, but
Instead of desisting, the defendant re- I

angry and threatening manner. Mr. Tassi i
is a quiet, respectable citizen and tax- !

VOURAKY TENDERS
HIS RESIGNATION
THE LINGUIST OF THE FORCE
SURRENDERS HIS STAR,
Fearing Another Hearing Before the
Commissioners, He Wisely
Concludes to Resign.
Policeman Vouraky, the linguist of
the Police Department, has tendered
his resignation to the Police Commis
sioners.
Harassed by his creditors and dis
gustfd with the life of a policeman,
Vouraky, acting under the advice of his
father-in-law, decided to sever his con
nection with the department. A few
weeks ago Vouraky was before the
Commissioners charged with unofFicer
like conduct. The evidence showed
that he and his wife had boarded a
street car intending to go to Golden
Gate Park. Vouraky tendered the con
ductor a ten-cent piece and not know
ing that he was a member of the police
force he rang up two fares. Not re
ceiving the nickel in change that he
had expected, Vouraky showed his star,
and in a boisterous manner proce-eded
to call the conductor to an account.
The latter explained that he did not
know that Vouraky was a policeman,
but as he had registered both fares he
advised him to see the superintendent,
who, he thought, would rectify the mis
take. Vouraky subsequently went to
the office of the superintendent and ex
hibiting his star threatened to "pinch"
those present unless the nickel which
he claimed he was robbed of was
promptly forthcoming.
Instead of being received with open
arms, as he thought, the superintend
ent rather coldly informed him that if
he wanted the nickel he would have to
commence suit against the company.
Vouraky then left, after vowing ven
geance against the superintendent and
everybody connected with the railroad.
Angered at his conduct the superin
tendent on the following day visited
po-lice headquarters and reported the
occurrence to Chief Lees. The latter,
after listening to the story, advised
him to prefer charges against the po
liceman. The case was heard by the
Commissioners and Vouraky was se
verely reprimanded for what Judge To
bin, the president of the board, termed
his consummate cheek. Since then his
creditors have been "hot on his trail,"
as one erf his superior officers expressed
It, and knowing that he would again
be brought before the Commissioners
for refusing to pay his debts he wisely
concluded to hand in his resignation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 189 S.
RODENTS WERE HIS
PARTICULAR FANCY
DEATH OF "BOB," A DISTIN
GUISHED CANINE.
A Sagacious Dog Who Passed Away
Recently at a Ripe Old
Age.
"Bob" Is dead. He was not a human
being, but a plain, ordinary Scotch ter
rier who gained distinction by living to
a ripe old age and killing nearly two
million rats.
These rodents were crushed between
the jaws of the sagacious canine dur
ing his twenty-four years' lease of life
In and about the vicinity of the Cali
fornia Market.
"Bob" was beloved by the visitors to
Collins & Wheeland's saloon, and his
death Will be sad news to them. He was
known as the pioneer dog, and was
celebrated the world over for his
steady habits and clever ways. "Bob"
drifted into the well-known resort
when a puppy and was so well satis
fied with his surroundings that he took
up his abode there.
He soon arrived at an age when the
rats in the neighborhood feared him.
"Bob" In his prime averaged forty
rodents a day.
The dog's regular habits won him
recognition. Every day between the
hours of 12 and 1 o'clock he would
nudge a customer on the shin and ap
peal for a drink. Water would always
be given him and he would follow his
usual custom of making war on the
enemy. In the evening he would dig
nifiedly trot to Hush and Montgomery
or Sacramento and Montgomery for ex
eroiFc. This trip he never missed.
The dead dog was the especial pet of
old-timers. George Barnes, the well
known newspaper man, now passed
away, devoted a haJf column to de
scribing his habits. Many tales are
told of his cleverness.
"Bob" followed his favorite pursuit up
to a few hours of his death. A dead
rodent in the corner attested to his
success in that line. The rat must have
been a frisky one, as the exertion
proved too much for "Bob," and he
Joined his enemy.
"Bob" will be cremated to-day. This
his sorrowing/ friends say was his dy
ing request apd it will be carried out.

NOTRE DAME
CONVENT IS
CONSECRATED
Structure Blessed by
Archbishop Riordan.
OBJECTS OF THE SCHOOL
BENEDICTION CONCLTJDES THE
SACRED CEREMONY.
A Large Congregation of Visitors
Listen to an Address in tho
Little Chapel of tha
Convent.
The new addition to the Notre Dame
Convent on Dolores street was solemnly
consecrated yesterday afternoon by Arch
bishop Rlordan. ,
Immediately after the formal blessing
of the new structure, with Incense and
prayer, benediction was solemnized in the
convent chapel before a large congrega
tion of visitors to the new home of the
sisters.
The Archbishop in a brief address out
lined the purpose of the new structure,
and the necessity of education in the
principles of religion.
"We have assembled to-day," he said,
"to congratulate the Sisters in their reali
zation of a hope of many years. In the
erection of the imposing and magnificent
structure which is sacredly blessed to-day
they have asked for no aid from the pub
lic. Through frugality and saving they
have amassed sufficient money to dedicate
to God and to those who are sent under
their cure the building which bears the
name of their order. Now that these
hopes have been realized we, their friends,
have come to offer them our heartteit Con
gratulations.
"This beautiful home of the Sisters rep
resents a great Catholic principle. It rep
resents the thorough and the careful de
velopment of the souls entrusted to the
care of the noble women in charge.
"It has ever been a most important
question as to what our duty should be
toward our children. They are growing
up part and parcel of the community, and
attention should be given to their devel
opment. The development and cultivation
of the soul's faculties should be our para
mount thought. Therefore, the soul from
the very inception of reason should be
taught the love of God by a thorough and
gradual inculcation of religion. The first
words on the lips of a human being should
be In praise of his Maker.. The world in
which we live is simply a trial, a prepara
tion as It were, for the world to come.
The proper education of children is the
most important question m church and
state. Upon It depends the future of the
country. This education, in order to ac
complish the end for which it Is given
must be coupled with religious training.
"The future of our church depends not
largely but entirely on the education Of
our children. We rejoice, therefore, that
a home for Christian education has been
provided by these, good Sisters of Notre
Dame. For forty 'vears these good nuns
have given their lives in the education of
thousands of girls, who have loft them
and their school to exert a salutary In
fluence in the community."
The benediction service was sung by
graduates of the corrvent, present en
rolled pupils and friends. Among the
principal singers were: Sopranos. Miss
M. Noon. Miss Julia Sullivan and Miss
M. Flood; contraltos. Miss Mary Noon,
Miss T. Pamba, the Misses Marie and

THEIR LITTLE GAME
HAS BEEN SPOILED
TWO BUNKO MEN WERE TRYING
TO KOB A MINER.
W. H. Brown and James McDonald
Arrested for Vagrancy to Keep
Them Out of Mischief.
A little bunko game hatched by "William
11, Brown and James McDonald, who
hoped to relieve a returned Klondiker of
his hard earned gold, was stopped by the
two worthy gentlemen being arrested on
the charge of vagrancy by Policeman
Leonard, who had heard of their desire
and efforts to fleece Robert Brown, who
is stopping at the Russ House.
Mr. Brown returned from the gold fields
something over a week ago anti took a
room at the Ahlborn House. -While there
he was spotted by his namesake and Mc-
Donald, who immediately investigated his
financial condition and finding that his
year's labor in Alaska had netted the
miner a goodly share of nuggets, began to
devise ways and means to secure the gold
for their own use. They soon made friends
with him, and one or the other was with
him constantly.
The friendship of the men was at first
rather acceptable to the returned Klon
diker, who was a stranger in the city, but
their attentions at last became too con
stant and he began to tire of his new
found friends. Without any suspicion that
the men had any designs on his gold, but
simply wishing to be rid of their society.
Brown changed his quarters to the Russ
House, neglecting to inform them of his
removal.
It tonk the shrewd McDonald and
Brown but a short time to find their pros
pective prey and they soon had him in
tow again. Their little scheme would
probably have succeeded had not W. H.
Brown been so well known in the city. A
banking man in business directly across
from the Russ House happened to know
him as a bunko man, and when he noticed
him being with the miner so much sus
pected something in the criminal line was
contemplated and notified the policeman.
The policeman knew both the men as
persons who would bear watching, and
believing, as his informant, that they
were planning to rob the miner, arrested
them on the charge of vagrancy. W. H.
Brown is a well known bunko man, and
the police think that the public is much
safer with him and McDonald behind the
bars.
STABBED IN REVENGE.
A Discarded Suitor Murderously As
saults the Sister of the Girl
He Loved.
A young woman, who gave her name as
Annie Reed, called at the Harbor Receiv
ing Hospital yesterday to have two knife
wounds dressed. Dr. H. E. Morrison
sewed an eight-inch wound on her arm
and a two-inch gash over her eye.
The patient gave an assumed name and
a tfrong address in an effort to hide her
identity. She said she was stabbed by an
intoxicated man on Francisco street while
returning from a dance early yesterday
morning. Her cousin, who accompanied
her to the hospital, said her assailant
was a man who had a grudge against her
for spoiling his chance of winning her
sister. The wounded woman declines to
report the murderous assault to the po
lice, fearinsr the attendant notoriety.
DISEASED MEAT
FOR THE EIGHTH
Contractor Samson to
Be Prosecuted.
DENIALS OF WHOLESALERS
ENOUGH BACILLI TO INFECT
THE WHOLE BJBGI MENT.
Dr. Baker Maintains the Beef Was
Never Passed by the United
States Government
Inspector.
CAMP BARRETT, SATHER TRACT,
Sept. 3. â The only two topics of discus
sion among the men of the Eighth Reg
iment to-day were the discovery of in
fected and diseased beef mentioned in
to-day's Call, and the fact that the
regiment is not included in the mus
tered out regiments. Over this latter
fact the soldiers are rejoicing. From
the day of their arrival in camp they
have contented themselves with what
ever fell to their lot. They have neither
grumbled over not being sent to the
front nor petitioned to be sent home.
The men are considerably agitated,
however, over the meat scandal. The
diseased beef in question contained suf
ficient bacilli of tuberculosis to spread
this dread disease throughout the en
tire regiment, and, as one of the offi
cers put it to-day, "the action of Sam
son's market in supplying such infect
ed meat for personal gain and with
out any regard for the health and wel
fare of the men who are willing to sac
rifice their lives for the nation is out-
rageous."
Dr. Baker, head of the Government
inspection service on this coast, was in
Oakland to-day and inspected the meat
â which was seized by the health au
thorities. He declared that no United
States inspector had ever passed such
meat. It was claimed that the beef
was received by Samson from the
Western Meat Company, but a repre
sentative from that concern denies that
it came from their slaughter-houses at
Baden. The health authorities now
propose to prosecute Samson under the
Oakland ordinance.
M. M. Samson, the contractor who
supplied the meat, states that the pres
ent difficulty comes from the enmity
existing between Inspector Pierce and
himself, and because he is not a mem
ber of the butchers' association. He
admits, however, that one of the car
casses had a boil on its neck, but that
it was all inspected meat and therefore
wholesome.
The funeral of George Perry of Com
pany B, Eighth Regiment, who died at
Fabiola Hospital yesterday from
typhoid fever contracted at Camp Bar
rett, took place this afternoon from
Albert Brown's parlors in Oa'-'^d.
His comrades gathered under cor i,.and
I of the officers at the parlors and after
' ward escorted the body to the train for

i reside. Perry was 19 years of age and
\ nis was the first case of typhiod in the
camp.
The funeral of Barton J. Brown, the
lowa soldier who died across the bay,
was held about the same time at the
same place and about twenty-four com
rades escorted the remains to the train
for shipment to lowa,

CALIFORNIA
VOLUNTEERS
TO GO HOME
Work of Mustering
Out Begins To-Day.
ALL QUIET IN THE SEVENTH
COLONEL BERRY, HOWEVER,
NOW MAKES A DENIAL.
He Declares That He Has Never
Made Use of Any Expression
Reflecting Upon the Secre
tary of War.
Tho mustering out of tha Sixth and
Beventh California regiments begins to
day, under tho direction of Captain Pratt,
of the Third Artillery, and Captain H. C.
Panes, acting assistant quartermaster,
commissary and acting ordnance officer,
these officers having- been designated for
the work by the War Department.
The first thing to be done will be to
issue an order to the commanding offi
cers of the two regiments instructing
them to have prepared a complete list of
ull officers, and report to the quartermas
ter general, commissary general of sub
sistence, surgeon general, chief of engi
neers, chief of ordnance and chief signal
officer, a list of thÂ«^se officers who are,
or who at any time have been, respon-
Bible for public property. The physical
examination of the men will take some
time. This wiil be rigid in order to guard
against false claims for pensions that
may be fllfd against the Government. It
will also require some time for the mus
tering out blanks to reach San Fran
cisco. Captain Pratt said yesterday that
he thought that the two regiments would
be mustered out in this city.
Colonel Kerry now denies the report that
he has ever given utterance to an ex
preÃsion reflecting upon the Secretary of
War, or that he ever said that his regl
jnÂ«!it would be disgraced by being mus
tered out of the service. He is of the
opinion that since tho Eighth is to take
the place of the Sixth and Seventh, that
it was political influence that brought
about the mustering out of the regiments.
General Miller has recommended that
six companies of the Eighth be sent to
Benicla, four to Fort Point to relieve the
Sixth, one to Santa Cruz and one to Al
catraz. The buttalion assigned to Fort
Point will not be brought over from Oak
land until the Sixth" and Seventh have
been mustered out, as there might be
Borne friction between it and the two regi
ments now about to make their exit.
Company F. Seventh' California, re
quests The Call, in a petition containing
the signatures of seventy-nine men of
the organization, to state that It desires
to go on record as not having asked to
he mustered out. The petition says that
the statement in one of the morning
papers that eighty-nine men had ex
pressed themselves as desirous of being
discharged is unfounded, as no such poll
has been taken. "We have always been
ready and willing." says the petition, "to
obey the orders of our superior officers
whether such orders sent us to our homes
or to the front." Only six men of the
company refused to sign this paper.
GRATEFUL TENNESSEEANS
Present a Beautiful Souvenir
to Mrs. French, "the Angel
of the Camp."
Thp members of Company B, First Ten
nessee Volunteers, have performed a very
graceful act in publicly and tangibly ex
pressing their gratitude to Mrs. Frank J.
French for her many kindnesses to them
during thoir campaign here. Thoy have
presented her with a beautiful gold medal
In the shane of a broad Maltese cross,
having in the center an engraving of the
coat-of-arms of Tennessee, and the let
ters, "U. S. I. V." at the points of the
cross, and on the other side Is the inscrip
tion. "To Mrs. Helen S. French, with
gratitude." The medal was the result of
a suggestion of Captain Whitthorne. The
presentation speech was made by Coun
tess Lovl'hu â  " avanne, who referred
to Mrs. French as the "angel of the
camp field." Mrs. French. In acknowledg
ing the gift of the beautiful souvenir, said
that "God had taken one of her boys and
had given her a hundred others."
RETURNED TO DUTY.
Private Anderson Acquitted of
Complicity in the Attack
on Dan Thomas
In the case of Private Charles B. An
derson, Company L, First Tennessee Reg
iment, recently tried by court-martial for
being Implicated in the attack upon Dan
Thomas, tho court found from the evi
dence that the soldier was not guilty of
the charge of conduct prejudicial to good
order and military discipline. He was
yesterday released from the guardhouse
ami returned to his company for duty
It was predicted in The Call some time
ago that the evidence against the sol
diers was not strong enough to convict
them, and from the finding of the co m
It would appear that it was Thomas who
was at fault. The cases against Privates
Scruggs, Davis and Clarke have not Â»-et
been completed by the court.
Feeling Among the lowans.
Colonel L,oper of the Fifty-first lowa
declares that his men are contented in
the service and that they are willing to
remain until General Merriam gets back
and it is settled whether they are to go
to Honolulu. If the regiment is not to be
sent away the colonel says that he is as
anxious as any of his men to return
home. The general desire among the men
Is to be mustered out.
Two Deaths Yesterday.
Private Jacob Ebert, Company A
Twenty-third Infantry. and Private
Oliver F. Hock. Company D, Fifty-first
lowa, died yesterday at the division hos
pital, the former of typhoid fever and the
latter of spinal meningitis.
EUROPEAN ARMIES TO DISARM.
The Rev. Cryor in a Stirring Sermon
Last Night Stated His Views on
the Present European Crisis.
The Rev. S. B. Cryor, pastor of the
Westminster Pesbyterlan Church, de
livered a stirring sermon last evening to
a large congregation, taking for the topic
of his discourse the proposed disarma
ment of Europe ac haa been outlined by
the Czar of Russia.
"Russia's proposal to disarm the stand
ing armies of Europe," he said "has
filled the whole world with astonishment
The RuHSian.s have always been looked
upon as an aggressive force; {hey have
always shown a great amount of diplo
macy, Touching out for new territory
I still consider Russia the moat dangerous
power in Europe. I believe the Czar was
sincere in his proposal, but I can under
stand why he reasoned himself into the
problem. America before the late war
had only a standing army of 25,000 men
but when the President placed over
325,000 men In the field a few days after
war was declared the Czar recognized
how useless and extravagant a thing it
was to keep a standing army. This late
war also proved that a volunteer army
is superior to a regular army and that
merchants, clerks and mechanics that
are educated and clever are far superior
and will defeat the average regular sol
dier in battle. I do not think that the
Czar's suggestion will be acted upon for a
long time, because God overrules and
ordains everything, and I do not believe
that the European armies will be dis
banded until the Turks are driven out of
what we may call the gateway of Europe
and a righteous war pitched against
them.
AN ELOQUENT PAULIST MISSIONARY
Rev. P. McCorry, Who Will for a Time Take
the Place of Father Dougherty.
The Paulist church In this city has received in Father Patrick Mc-
Corry, recently sent to this city from the East as a substitute for Father
Dougherty, one of the brightest jewels in the entire Paulist community.
Although but an ordained priest of a little over a year and a half he
stands pre-eminent as one of the most eloquent preachers In the Catholic
church. Wherever he has gone he has met with favor and a well-earned
laudation of his talents.
His worth as an orator cannot be better described than In the follow
ing published criticism in one of the Eastern papers:
If the Roman churrh has a more brilliant exponent of her doctrines, a man
with a more refined and powerful control of the English tongue than Father
McCorry he is yet to be heanl from. The man's personality Is simply irresistible.
He speaks to the heart, and differ from his creed as we may, we yet must
love him. He has the power possessed by few living preachersâ to bring Christ's
gospel hopefully, helpfully into the lives of his auditors and make It a living,
vital part of their existence.
Father McCorry will tour the coast on missionary work In the abpence
of Father Dougherty, who Is now in performance of the duty of chaplain
In one of the regiments of United States volunteers at Manila. His initial
appearance In this city was made at St. Mary's Church (Paullst) yester
day morning In a sermon on the "Christian Home." His power of ora
tory from the commencement of the address was manifest; and long be
fore he left the pulpit many were moved to tears, and those incapable of
outward appearance of emotion gave vent to their feelings in congratula
tions to the young priest immediately after mass.
How long the young priest will remain on the coast Is a matter of con
jecture. It is hoped, however, by those present at mass yesterday at St.
Mary's Church that he will be allowed to remain after the return of
Father Dougherty.
SEVEN INNINGS
OF FAST BALL
Babies Make a Showing
for a While.
DONLAN FORCED TO EASE UP
SAN FRANCISCO WITH A RUSH
EASILY WINS OUT.
Watsonville in Urgent Need of Out
fielders Before It Can Hope to
Make Much of an Im
pression.
For seven Innings yesterday the league
Infants played tn* finest kind of cham
pionship ball. Then Donlan let down In
his pitching, the in and out fielders sud
denly became hypnotized and San Fran
cisco was handed up a game it wns no
more entitled to than frosty-footed Witt
man is to levy on his subordinates for his
parade plumage.
Watsonville needs Borne outfielders. It
can never hope to cut any flexure In base
ball circles until it replaces its present
choice statuary with some real ball
players who can see the sphere when it
gets out in their territory and can con
nect with it at the plate. Peters labored
under a great disadvantage all day. His
right hand was badly injured In Satur
day's game, but he went in again yester
day and received Donlan's delivery, with
the result that his record looks bad, much
worse than It really was, in fact. Donlan
hud the speed of a jackrabbit and was
fully as wild, so It Is small wonder that
Peters had an uncomfortable time of it
trying to hold wild pitches and rapid-fire
shells with his sore wing.
Donlan, with a judicious application of
cold compresses to his head to reduce the
enlargement and more experience in the
box, will become a good pitcher. But he
must gain better control of the ball and
realize that there are a few points in the
game he haa not vet mastered. Up to
the unhappy eighth yesterday he kept
Bunker's pygmies down to three scattered
hits, but then he went to pieces and a
terrific cannonading ensued. Three clean
hits were all that were obtained during
the Inning in question, but there was
much hard swatting, which, with the
statuesque outfielders behind him, netted
runs and won the game for the locals.
The work of Monahan of the home team
was as ragged as a Kansas volunteer, but
he knows 4iow to do better and generally
does, so he may be charged with merely
suffering from an "off day." With that
exception and their inability to make
schedule time with the ban. the San
Franclscos put up a pretty game, grace
fully trimmed with a trio of clever double
plays.
Watsonvtlle got down to business right
at the start- Franks opened up with a
single and completed the circuit on Held's
double to leftneld fence. It was not until
the fourth that the locals broke the ice,
when a base on bails, a single, Courtney's
fumble and a wild pitch let two runs In.
The visitors Immediately took the lead
again. An error by Monahan, a single, a
sacrifice and Hammond's muff netted a
brace or tallies. One more cam.Â© to them

in the sixth, when McCarthy laced out a
v, Â°,Â», an , d scored on Albright's single,
â  L v the locaJs struggled along until the
eighth piling up rings instead of runs.
l ut w " en they did begin tney took more
than they needed. Smith was safe on a
m ssed third strike and H. King followed
with a dinky infield hit. Murphy's long
single to right scored both runners, the
batsman going to second on the throw
home and third on a passed ball. Mona
han hit to McCarthy and Murphy tallied
on the overthrow to the plate. Ham
mond sent another down to McCarthy and
kept on to second on the latter's high
throw to first. After K. King had fanned
Stroeeker drove a single over short, scor
ing Monahan and Hammond. The b Â»ti
stole second, but was caught in trying
for third.. Croll was given his base and
fame home on Shea's double to right
Smith ended the trouble by striking out'

One world's record was broken and an
aquatic feat, similar to that performed
by Swimmer Hanlon some years ago,
which resulted in his death, was success

record established in the East some time
apo. The crowd applauded the feat, and
the record breaker was awarded the
medal. Dan Green made a complete
triple turn from a swinging trapeze some
thirty feet abow? the water and completed
a beautiful dive. Hanlon, the noted
swimmer, attempted the same feat, but
struck the water sideways and received
injuries that resulted fatally.
In the 50-yard dash James Cartwright
was declared winner, J. Walters second.
F. Burnett won the spring board diving
contest, O. Schulte second. Dan Carroll
carried off the first prize in the 120-yard

REFUSED TO LEAV :
HIS DEAD MASTER
DE. HALL DIES AND HIS DOG
GUARDS THE BODY.
The Faithful Animal Ley on the
Dead Man's Breast and Would
Not Leave His Post.
â¦
Dr. Samuel Hastings Hall, who was
but rccentiy on trial In the courts of the
city, died suddenly on Saturday while at
the house of a friend, and after his death
a dog,- of which he had thought a great
deal, took up his position. on the breast
of the dead man and refused to leave
the body of his master.
The doctor went early In the evening
to the house of Louis Doerr, at 1712 Baker
street, where he had been invited to din
ner. After the meal he comnlalncd of
pains in the region of the heart, and
when they grew worse Dr. Laid law was
summoned, but was unable to save the
physician's life. Dr. Hall had suffered
from heart ; trouble for some time, and
when first attacked last night seemed to
know that he would not live.
During the short time preceding the at
tack and tho death of the doctor, the
dog, a bull terrier, whioh had been the
constant companion of the physician,
realized that all was not well with his
master and whined until allowed to take
a place near the sick man. When the
doctor had passed away the faithful ani
nutl took up a position across the body
and for a time refused to allow the friends
of the dead man to touch his deceased
master. ' . _
Dr. Hall leaves a widow, who is In San
Jose at present; a daughter, Josephine,
whom he was to have visited at the Irv
ing Institute last evening, and a son,
Dr. S. S. Hall, residing at 509 Guerrero
street.
Deputy Coroner O'Brien did not remove
the body to the Morgue, as Dr. : Laidlaw
is willing to sign a death certificate, giv
ing aneurism of the heart as the cause
of death.
Sin r.nd Satan.
"Sin and Satan" was the subject of Dr.
J. A. Anderson's discourse at the San
Francisco Theosophical Society's meeting
last night. He explained the allegories
which seem to find a place In every ethical
system, though under different forms and
names. The attendance was large and
the lecture proved very interesting.

PLEDGES TO BE REDEEMED
ONLY MERIT CAN CONTROL A
STRONG PARTY VOTE.
A Few Manipulators and Chronic
Place-Hunters Can Easily
Tarnish a Good ;
1 Record.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call.
903 Broadway, September 4.
The voters of Alameda County want
Some other argument than the fact that
President McKlnley has added to the
honor and standing of the Republican
party by his conduct of the recent war to
Induce them to support a local Republi
can ticket. There is and always has been
in Alameda a strong inclination to dissect
the man who is put up for office rather
than to take it for granted that he is
worthy of support simply because his
name Is on the Republican ticket.
The following state of affairs is some
thing that should be considered at this
time, because within two weeks the party
will meet to name a ticket for the No
vember election, and It is incumbent on
every individual Republican to take a
hand in the preliminary stages of the
campaign and not wait until after nomi
nations are made and then condemn the
ticket.
At the last election Alameda guve a
Republican majority of 5200. At the pres
ent time her county offlcera are thus
filled:
herig â â  â  .â â m~ Populist .
Treasurer Populist
Superintendent of Schools Populist
Assessor _ Independent
Plutrict Attorney _^. Republican
Public Administrator.... ...... Republican
Tax Collector..... Republican
Recorder _^ â....^.....Republican
Coroner .i_~._^. . Republ! l
County Clerk... â .. Republican
County 5urvey0r..â........... .Republican
Auditor Â..,. v. -Republican
It is seen that the four offices with the
largest patronage were lost to the party
because of its putting up men who could
not command the confidence of the vot
ers. Just at this time there seems to be
a possibility that some similar mistakes
may be made, and that Alameda, Instead
of upholding her reputation, which was
considerably augmented recently at Sac
ramento in the ranks of Republicanism,
will appear somewhat as a political freak
county after the November election. It
be regretted that the control of the
is in the hands of such a limited
â¢r. The effect of having a few men
ao all the work for the party has been
to create a feeling among the masses to
lollow their leaders Instead of thinking
working out their own salvation.
There is no reason that can be advanced
Why. a strong Reublican ticket should be
knifed, but it is not to be expected that
the bulk of the conservative party vote
will digest everything that may be of
lt. In the past this element has
wonderfully pati-nt, but it has grad
ually grown to dislike having nauseous
fori-'M down its throat. This was
exemplified two years ago when the
duso was very forcibly ejected.
The convention that will meet at San Le
andro in two weeks' time has a more lm
â :t duty to perform than any Re
publican convention that has ever met In
da County. Many of the men who
1 take part in It were at Sacramento
9 ago. They Justly boasted of
- Republicanism, and when
irdee withdrew his name they one
an ali declared that Alameda County
work and vote as energetically for
ate ticket as though Dr. Pardee's
were at its head. Still later, when
â  i Mclaughlin stated that Ala
: 'â  favorite Republican must certain
ly be the next standard bearer in this
Alamedans again pledged them
to Five such a heavy Republican
his fall that all the State should see
that she is a generous loser, and at the
same time would lay the foundation for
success four years hence.
Still later Air. Gage came to Oakland
ana was introduced to a truly representa
tive Republican gathering by George Par
deo. Again were tho pledges renewed.
The county convention will meet with
tho full knowledge that these pledges
have been made, and it is its solemn duty
to carry them out. This can only be done
by rujning local candidates who are be
yond criticism and who are not stale
place-hunters. It is an absurd proposi
tion to imagine that a fabric can be
Btronger than its foundation, and it is
lust as absurd for party manipulators to
lull themselves into indifference to con
m->i ;<--nces by the thought that this being
a Republican year anything resembling
Republicanism or masquerading as such
will be accepted without comment.
Already the warnlngfrof what may be
expected in case the convention does not
do its whole duty is very apparent. Setae
Independent candidates who can com
mand a moderate amount of support, are
busy laying their wires for the purpose
of honeycombing the Republican ticket.
Experience has shown that this can be
done. Under the present system of pri
maries it docs not always follow that
because a man can bring forward a little
delegation from his own ward that he
must, therefore, be the strongest man for
the position in the county. While it is
true that there is at this time more har
mony in the ranks of the party in Ala
meda County than has been known for
eight years, it is also true that should
this increased prestige be misused to
the advantage of the few, It will react.
Among- the independent candidates is
one George C. Hunt. Since Mr. Hunt is
now a public man and has issued a state
ment to the voters, of whom I am one,
It cannot be out of place to refer to
him. Mr. Hunt says: "In consequence
of ring politics and boss manipulation
which excludes the possibility of a man
not Identified with those methods secur
ing- a nomination at a county convention,
ring to .â void any such alliances
â ^Rations herewith announces him
.'-pendent Republican candidate
' cc of Sheriff of Alameda Coun
1 by so doing take from the hands
f'f politicians the control of the selection
of t!;;u officer and. instead, place the
â¢ belongs, In the hands of
tne whole people <>f this county to decide
day instead of at the primal y
as they have I sen <<;nductpd."
I will ru.t undertake to analyze Mr.
Hunt b Kmmmr.r. imt I presume lie means
v that borausp lie cannot run the
j.nrtv himself he w!M he a little boss on
his own account. His railing at the pri
maries is somewhat refreshing, for it is
i record that Mr. Hunt was ever a
furi^t. However, those trifles matter not.
do not think Mr. Hunt will be the next
Republican Sheriff of this county.
It fs somewhat surprising that so little
Interest has hitherto been shown in the
legislative ticket to be nominated in less
than two weeks. While the nominees for
the two Senatorial districts are pretty
there is so far very little
â¡ as to who will fill the Assembly
men'i chair in the next Legislature. As
it 1h very probable that a man from this
end of the State will succeed Senator
White, it ffiiffbt be supposed that there
would b< a lig scramble for these nomi
nations. There are some of the Assembly
districts in which not a single name has
â  n mentioi cd. However, there are
thousands of solid Republicans capable of
Qg the county, and it is per
ter that iney should be picked
out at the convention than forced upon it
in advain c.
There is certainly no foundation for
George C. Hunt's reference to bossism.
There never was a time when Alameda
was freer from a political boss than now.
It is true that certain individuals might
be termed bosses in their respective pre
cincts, but no one can control a ward,
and certainly no one can dictato to the
â whole county. The beat proof of this is
that there are more than two complete
nets of candidates and each one is
trembling with fear that the other may
be the stronger. It remains for the con
vention to make the choice, and if the
disgrace of '94â so far as county offices
are concernedâ be not wiped out this fall
It will be just so much lost prestige for
Alameda County In the State campaign

SCORCHERS ON THE
ELMHURST TRACT
AMES DEFEATS TREAD WELL IN
A MILE HANDICAP.
Came TJp to the Tape in a Bunch,
and the Judges Were in Doubt
Who Was the Winner.
The Elmhurst bicycle velodrome re
opened yesterday with a programme of
match races between A. P. Deacon of the
Reliance Wheelmen and A. T. Smith of
the Encinal Cyclers, and a one-mile han
dicap race for amateurs.
The grand stand was filled with an en
thusiastic crowd of spectators, who
cheered the exciting finishes and hissed
the loafing which characterized the first
heat of the handicap race.
It was a great day for the Reliance
wheelmen, for their club captured every
thing in sight.
The match races between Deacon and
Smith proved beyond a doubt the su
periority of Deacon over his rival of the
Encinal city.
The first heat of the match was half a
mile, ridden without pace. In this heat
Smith bore the brunt of the pace
throughout, but could not hold it when
Deacon sprinted by him on the bell lap.
The second heat was one mile, with
single pacemakers, and here Smith looked
like a winner, but again Deacon's sprint
was too much for him, and he was left
far behind at the tape.
The third heat was ridden more with a
view to pleasing the spectators, as the
two victories had already given Deacon
the race. Smith, too, thought to recoup
in a measure in the third heat, but was
again beaten. This heat was ridden with
tandem pace.
The one mile handicap attracted a good
entry and was run in three heats. The
llrst went to the credit of A. Reddy of the
Acme Club, and the second to Ivan
Troadwell of the Bay City Wheelmen,
who rode in good style and finished yards
in front of his field.
The final heat was a rather mixed up
and unsatisfactory affair, not from a
spectator's point of view, for it was full
of excitement, but from the fact that a
dispute arose over the decision of the
Judges after the finish, which will long
rankle in the minds of many a clubman.
TnadwfH. Holmes, Kennedy and Ames
rode in a bunch from the beginning ot the
bell lap. and as they neared the tape it
was seen that a close finish was inevit
able. Whon the riders had passed in a
bunch the judges, four in number, con
sulted one another and it was discovered
that two gave the first place to Ivan
Treadwell while the other two were
equally positive that Ames was the
victor.
Referee Thorn was called upon to de
cide the matter and he gave the first
place to Ames.
Treadwell and his followers are very
angry, and rumors of a match race be
tween he and Ames are given credence
among the clubs.
J. P. Thorn acted as referee and starter
and the timli- was In the handÃ of
Messrs. Morehouse, Bradbury and Gross.
The summary followsâ One mile handicap,
amateur. First heatâ A. Reedy, Acme, first-
C. Holmes, Reliance, second. Tlm<>, 2:29 2-5. '
Second heatâ lvan Treadwell, Hay City, flrnf

How did Camp Merritt come to be lo

could be Quickly introduced was the pa
rade ground near the Lombard -street en
trance, where there was a large main.
To carry water to the higher points of the
reservation would require a month's time.
| The troops who lirst arrived, among them
j the First California and the Second Ore
i gon, were accordingly located near the
I Lombard-street gate of the Presidio res
â  ervation.
/ Ail the available space that was sup
j plied with water was soon taken up, and
I owing to the rapid concentration of
I troops it was necessary to have more
! ground and more water at once.
Now here Is where the Spring Valley
I joker comes In. The company, through
| Its engineer, suggested that the Bay Dis
trict race track ground would be an ex
cellent camp site, as the company had re
cently surrounded the blocks with water
I mains, and If any more were needed they
could be quickly laid. Furthermore, the
I owners of the property â the Stanford and
I Crocker estates â would be willing to al
j low the land to be used without any com
j pensation.
General Merriam inspected the pro
! posed camp site and found it rather
| pleasing to the eye, as it was level and
, was then growing a crop of barley, which
i had been planted to form a sod to hold
! the sand from drifting. Soon after the
I selection of this site by General Merriam
all the troops were turned over to the ex
peditionary forces, as they were called,
under command of General Merritt. in
whose honor the camp was named. When
' General Otis arrived the handling of these
j forces was placed in his hands, and he
; concentrated all the troops at Camp
; Merritt. even taking the Seventh Cali
fornia over from the Presidio. He gave
! as a reason for crowding all these troops
at ('amp Merritt that It was necessary to
have them all together for the better
handling, training and disciplining them.
The fact Is that had he allowed a fair
portion to occupy the grounds at the
Presidio there would have been no over
i crowding at Camp Merritt. He had plenty
lof brigadier generals "lying around
J loose," as it were, and could easily have
spared one of them to take charge of a
1 brigade or two at the Presidio.
The barley soon disappeared from the
'. surface of the sand of Camp Merritt. and
as a conseo.uence the ground became
damp and retained Its moisture, which.
with the fog, caused much of the illness
that began to be rather alarming early
in July and kept on increasing throughi
| out August.
The Seventh California was moved from
i Camp Merritt over to Point Lobos
j avenue, where the typhoid fever was de
1 veloped owing to the camp being located
lon a place which included within Its
limits a sink, the fact not being dis
covered until some time after the disease
had broken out. Finally the move back
i to the Presidio was mnde.
The Spring Valley Water Company was
I paid about $2000 for making the connec
j tions and supplying water at Camp Mer
ritt. The pip*-, about 16.000 feet, one and a
half inches diameter, has been taken up
! arA relaid at the Presidio. The cost of
restoring the Camp Merritt site to its
j former condition, the work of which Is
| now in progress, will be $8500, which Is to
be paid by the Govenrment.
THE EIGHTH REGIMENT.
Camp Barrett Likely to Move
Soon as a Precautionary
Measure.
CAMP BARRETT. Sathcr Tract. Sept 4.
â It has been practically decided, as a
precautionary health measure, to change
the location of the Eighth Regiment, and
it is most likely that the regiment will
soon be removed to a site in the neigh
borhood of Haywards. Regimental Sur
geon Dudley and a board of survey have
made a careful analysis of the water used
at Camp Barrett, which comes from
Lake Chabot. and the result has caused
them to advise that the water be here
after boiled before it is used by the sol
diers.
"The Eighth Regiment has been sta
tioned in its present camp over two
months," said one of the officers to-day,
"and naturally the location becomes
more or less contaminated after such long
use by a large body of men, and the ob
ject of moving to other quarters is a
purely precautionary measure."

VACAVILLE, Sept. 3.â The Republi
can County Convention yester
day was provocative of excitement. A
combination between Vallejo, Benicia
and a part of the Suisun delegation was
supposed to have programmed the
ticket to the exclusion of the upper
part of the county. The political guess-
Ing proved correct, and early in the af
ternoon it looked as if there would be a
bolt of the entire Northern Solano del
egates. The threat to bolt made by a
section assessed for $9,000,000, and com
prising over a third of the population,
unless a fair proportion of the offices
were allowed It, simmered down to a
threatening disregard for what was
going on in the convention and a
studied lack of participation In the
business.
Nominations followed, each being rat

DOINGS OF DEMOCRATS,
Hotly Contested Primaries Held in
Monterey County.
SALINAS, Sept. 4.â Democratic primar
ies were held in Monterey County yes
terday. Besides the regular ticket
there was a determined opposition by a
faction oDposed to the methods of the
leaders of the Democratic committee in
county politics and the Court House offi
cials. The heaviest vote ever cast at a
primary in Salinas was polled, being 1 near
ly one-half the full vote. The "regulars"
carried the day by an overwhelming: ma
jority. The principal fight was centered
on candidates for the nomination for
County Assessor. From outside precincts
the reports are that the delegates are
evenly divided. Those elected here are
for fusion with the Populists, but the
delegates of that party say they will op
pose all attempts at fusion and will nom
inate a middle-of-the-road ticket.

POISON AND
TOOLS FOUND
IN HIS ROOM
Arrest of a Supposed
Crook.
TAKEN WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
THE POLICE THINK HE IS A
REAL SAFE-CRACKER.
Gub Winters, for Whom the Police
Have Been. Looking, Locked
TJp in the City Prison
Tanks.
"Gus" Winters, a desperate crook, was
arrested last night by Detectives Ryan
and Dinan, and locked up in the tanks
pending an Investigation. In his room the
detectives found a valise containing two
bottles of arsenic, a bottle of chloroform,
some "knockout irops," a bag filled with
black powder, a number of skeleton keys
and a piece of lead pipe filled with gun
powder. Attached to ono end of the pipe
was a long fuse. It is supposed that tno
deadly instrument was to be used in blow-
Ing open a safe.
A short time ago Detective Ryan ob
tained a description of Winters, and
knowing he wa.Â« a tough character he
started out to find him. While he was
searching 1 for the crook word was re
ceived that Winters had been identified as
"GUS" WINTERS, a Supposed Safe
Cracker and His Varied Outfit.
being one of tho men who was systemati
cally robbing tool chests, the property of
carpenters who were engaged in con
structing buildings. Several pawnbrokers
were seen and they admitted that Win
ters hari sold them a varied assortment of
carpenters' tools which he had stolen.
Shortly after 10 o'clock last night Ryan
and Dlnan, while walking along Market
street, espied the much-wanted crook
standing on Grant avenue.
They slipped up behind him and prompt
ly placed a pair of handcuffs on his
â wrists. Winters did not offer any resist
ance and was Immediately taken to the
City Prison, where his name was regis
tered on the "small book."
Subsequently the detectives located his
room at 735 Mission street. The valise
"which contained the poison and the piece
of "loaded" pipe was found bidden under
the bed. Winters persistently refused to
tell why he had the deadly articles In his
possession.
"They were found in my room." he re
marked, "and I suppose they must belong
to me."
Further than this he refused to say any
thing.
The detectives are reasonably certain
that the prisoner is a desperate crook.
They also think that ho ;,s the "short
mnn" who has been operating throughout
the interior, blowing open safes ana rob
( blng unsuspecting victims. He is about 40
years of age. has a light mustache and is
shabbily dressed. When taken into cus
tody he told the officers that ho lived on
Sixth street, but when sharply questioned
he finally admitted that he was stopping
at the house where the articles and poison
were found.
While waiting for the patrol wagon an
ex-convict accosted Ryan and calling him
aside told him that \\ inters had served a
term with him in San Qu^niin. H>> also
spoke to Winters, but the latter pretended
not to know him. In a small book which
â was found on the prisoner was a memor
andum showing that he had been taken ill
at Suisun and was sent to a hospita.l.
To-day an effort will be made to con
nect him with some of the numerous safe
burglaries in th<> Interior.
Sport in the Handball Court.
The day's sport in Ryan's handball
court, 858 Howard street, was up to the
usual standard yesterday. The single
game for a bet of $50 between Hampton
and Collins was undecided Jn consequence
of the desire of other players to take
a turn before the close of the day. As a
consequence it was continued until next
Sunday afternoon. As fnr as it went it
was considered to be one of the best
single-handed games ever played in this
city.
At the conclusion of the game as far as
It went the score stood as follows:
Hampton 21, 21, 19; Collins IS, 20. 21.
The other four-handed games wore as
follows:
W. Hassell and B. Clements defeated T.
Clements and W. Manlon. Score, 21-13, JC-I'l

Socialists Meet.
Professor Kendrlck Charles Babcock of
Berkeley lectured to a large audience last
night before the People's Socialist party
at Washington Hall. His theme was the
social settlement movement, on which he
talked interestingly for the better part of
an hour. Other speakers followed on
topics of Bociallem and labor problems
from the socialistic standpoint.
MAUDE S WON
THE OPEN STAKE
Defeated the Fast Ones
Easily.
RUSTY GOLD WAS. RUNNER UP
A BIG CROWD VISITED UNION
PARK.
The Nimble Hares Set a Very Warm
Pace That the Fleet Hounds
Had Trouble to Dupli
cate.
Several thousand people visited the
Union Coursing Park yesterday and were
treated to a good day's Bport. It was
rather a hard layout for the long shot
players, as the only dog that they cashed
their tickets on was Minneapolis at 6 to 1,
which defeated the crack bitch Rosette,
in the fourth round. McKlnley showed
a great improvement of form and was not
shut out until the fifth round, being de
feated by Rusty Gold with a few points
to spare. In the second round Minne
apolis and Gilt Edge were the only short
t-nders that won, the balance of the
courses all going to hot favorites.
The hares were unusually fleet and
game, anr^his resulted in several long
and exciting courses, the match between
Maude S and Gilt Edge being exception
ally line. The stake was eventually cap
tured by Maude S, the bitch easily de
feating Rusty Gold in the finals. Tho re-
suit was a surprise to the talent, as the
latter dog was favorite at ouds of 5 to 3.
It is to be hoped that the management
will in the future cut down the number
of entries in the various stakes, as last
night the final race was not run until long
after 6, and it was so dark that It was
nearly impossible for the spectators to
see the running of the dogs. The results
were as follows:

CONNEMARA WINS HANDILY.
Readily Accounts for the Stake at
Ingleside â Brilliant Sport.
There was no greyhound running at In
gleside Coursing Club yesterday that was
capable of extending J. Dean's great
black dog Connemara. He worked his
way through the various rounds and in'
the final was pitted against Lowe &
Thompson's Prince Hal. The latter had
been running consistently throughout the
meeting, showing considerable speed.
In the final there was nothing to it but
"Con." He showed remarkable speed
opening up a decided lead from the mo
ment the brace of dogs left the hands of
Slipper James Grace. The hare proved
a speedy one and led the dogs a merry
chase. It was Connemara ali the way,
the hare finally making its escape.
The sensational course of the day was
the meeting of False Flatterer and' Koo
lawn. It required three trials before
Judge Grace named Koolawn the winner.
The first was "no race," the second an
"undivided," each scoring six and one
half points.. In the third trial Koolawn
won all the way. scoring twelve points
to two for the English dog. The severity
of the course ruined any chances Koo
lawn might have had for the stake, as
she wont out in the next round being
retired by Prince Hal.
The final of the puppy stake was be
tween Billy Gladstone and Mayflower
both owned by J. Eagan. It was not
necessary to send hIH dogs to the slips
but In a sportsmanlike spirit he elected
to run them. Gladstone was a 2 to 1
favorite. The first trial proved an "un
decided. In the second trial Gladstone
was played as though there was noth
ing else to it. The result was a surprise,
Mayflower winning handily. She led up
to the hare, and killed without turning
to the evident delight of the shortend
ers.

CALIFORNIA MEN IN
RATTLING TENNIS
The Invitation doubles at the California
Tennis Club Saturday afternoon proved
a success In every detail. It has been
some time since the courts were so well
filled with players, and the spectators
crowded around the sides from the initial
to the final matches. The young and old
participated In the tournament. Promi
nent as one of those actively engaged was
Walter Hobart, who is now returning to
the game with his old-time enthusiasm.
The tournament was of the "round
robin" order, in which every player met
every other player in a single set, the
team playing the most games being ad-
Judged the winner. Weihe and Adams
won the tournament, although they were
tied by Hunt and Stone of Alameda, who
also lost but one game; but as Weihe and
Adams played more matches, their per
centage was greater. Weihe and Adams
and Hunt and Stone then played a match
game to decide the question of superior
ity. Hunt and Stone won this match,
proving themselves the champions, al
though the honor of first place was not
their lot.
The scores for the matches are as fol
lows:
Robert N. "Whitney and Stauf defeated Wal
ter and Root, 6-4.
Adams and WeihÂ« defeated Hobart and
Chepobrough, 6-1.
Adams and Weihe defeated MoGavin and
Code, 6-1.
Hunt and Stone defeated Henly and Broem

Hunt and Stone defeated Smith and Mc-
Gavln, 6-2.

Stone and Hunt defeated Tale and Buch
ley 6-0.
McGavin and Code defeated Hobart and
I Chrsebrough, 6-3.
Root and Walter defeated Kilgarlft and Da
vis. 6-2.
The match between Adams and Weihe
and McGavin and Smith, which resulted
In a victory for the latter, was the most
hotly contested one of the day, and came
in the nature of a surprise to all. The
"pony" team was more than confident of
victory, and its defeat was a bitter pill
for it to swallow. This was the only Bet
Adams and Weihe lost during the entire
day.
CUP WINNEBS IN THE LEAD.
The elevens of the Pacific and the Ala
meda clubs met on Golden Gate ground
yesterday for the fifth cricket match of

first innings fell SI runs short of their
opponent's score. Six of the Alameda
players obtained double figures, the best
scores being J. J. Moriarlty's 3S and J. J.

It was a great day for the riflemen at
the Shell Mound range yesterday, the oc
casion being the fortieth annual outing
and shooting festival of the San Fran
cisco Schuetzen Verein. The members of
the organization assembled at their hall
early In the morning and marched to the
boat headed by a band. On reaching the
park many went to the pavilion where
there was dancing all day, but nearly all
of the men gathered on the shooting
, range, where they banged away at the
i bullseyes until 6 o'clock. As there was
, $400 in cash prizes offered there was lively
I shooting and several made very credlt
; able records during the day. All of the
j public shooting was done on the point
I target, on which the tv.elve-inch black
lis divided into three points, counting
I three, two and one. All of the three-
Inch cardboard centers struck were taken
I off to be measured by the machine and
I for the twenty best centers prizes run
ning from $25 to $1 were offered. Prizes
of similar number and value were offered
for the most points made during the day.
As premiums prizes amounting to $75
were offered for the marksman making
the most red flags (three-inch centers) In
thirty-shot tickets, the straight tickets
being six shots. This sum was cut into
lots ranging from $12 to $1 50 for the
twenty prizes. In addition there were
$2 50 and $1 offered to those making the
tirst and last bullseyes In the forenoon
and afternoon. The winners of these
were: First in the forenoon, J. C. Wal
ler; lapt In the forenoon, D. W. Mc-
L,nughTln; first in the afternoon, F. At
tlnger; last in the afternoon, D. W. Mc-
Laughlin. A. Strecker won the first pre
mium prize of $12 for the most red flags
ten; D. W. McLaughlln second prize on
eight, and Utschlg third on seven. One
of the best runs of the day was by Mc
laughlin, who on two thirty-shot tickets
put forty-eight bullets into the six-Inch
circle and the other twelve shots were
kept within the twelve-inch circle. ITt
s. hip:. Strecker, Finking, Factor. Papo,
Clindemann and a number of others held
well, but they did not keep their shots

"Went to Other Targets.
Owtns to the fact that the annual Sep
tember schuetzen fest of the San Fran
cisco Schuotzen Vereln was held at Shell
Mound yesterday, the attendance at the
Schuetzen Park targets was not quite so
large as usual. So many of the California
Schuetzen Club members attended the
fest, it was found expedient simply to
tally the scores made by the marksmen
in the monthly medal shoot and let the
absent members have their turn next
Tuesday. The great annual prize shoot
of this club, to determine the "king"" for
the year, will take place on the 25th inst.

Club O. Bremer carried off the honors
with a score of 428, and will acquire tHe
medal unless he is outshot by an absent
member next Sunday. In detail the score
was as follows:
O. Bremer, 425: F. E. Mason, 425; Captain
F. A. Kuhls, 402; J. H. Suss, 402; C. Eeging,
SM; C J. Walden, 397: N. FrieMerlrhs. 387; A.
Hamprt, 373; C. F. Waltham, 371; L. C. Babln,

C. Jlagerup. 341; F. C. Muller, 314; F. Schu
mann, 303; G. Kuhlmann, 279.
Besides the California Schuetzen Club,
the San Francisco Grutll Shooting Sec
tion and the Schuetzen Section of the
Verein Elntracht had a day at the butts.
The Grutlis held both a bullseye and a
medal shoot. In the former Karl Sussll
won out first, and In the latter Joseph
Fetz triumphed with a score of 403. The
following were the complete scores:

MRS. BOTKIN FREELY ADMITS
SHE BOUGHT THE ARSENIC
POISON USED
TO BLEACH
HER HATS
Says Three Witnesses
Will Corroborate Her
Statement.
REQUISITION PAPERS ARE
HERE.
Character of Toxic in the
Candy a Fateful Point.
Knight Has Fun
With Lees.
Calmly and without a shadow of hesi
tance Mrs. Cordelia Botkin yesterday ad
mitted she bought two ounces of arsenic
at the Owl Drug Store on June 1.
Suspected, and almost morally con
demned, nf i. i> wickedest, wanton double
murder of the century, she makes this
admission without reserve, although it
assists the crime sleuths In welding a
chain which may lead her to the gallows.
To this damning acknowledgment she
vehemently reiterates her innocence of
any complicity In the awful death of Mrs.
John P. Dunning and Mrs. Joshua D.
Deane, who unsuspectingly ate arsenic
laden sweets sent over 3000 miles to ac
complish the devilish purpose of a fiend.
Sitting in the warm rays of the bright
Sabbath sun which streamed through the
barred window of her cell, < xstlng broad
shadows on the cemented floor, the ac
cused woman related the circumstances
and details of the purchase and use of
the poison. She said she went to the
Owl Drug Store to get arsenic, because she
knew Frank S. Grey, the clerk who waited
upon her; that she was accompanied by
a friend and that Fho gave her true name
and address for entry on the poison reg
ister.
This fact alone. Bhe thinks, exonerates
hrr from the accusation ,that she plan
ned to murder sixty-five days before the
death package was started on its fateful
journey to Dover. She told the clerk she
wanted the poison to bleach a straw hat,
and solemnly swears she used it for that
purpose, and further that two witnesses
were present at the cleansing operation.
The names of these two witnesses are
now jealously guarded by Attorneys
Knight and McGowan.
The requisition from the Governor of
Delaware asking the Governor of Cali
fornia to surrender Cordelia Botkin to an
officer now h^re arrived yesterday at
noon. In a few days, when Chief Lees
has completed his search for evidence
and Joined it with that forwarded from
the place the crime was committed. Gov
ernor Budd will be asked to issue a war
rant which will send the alleged murder
ess to Dover, that she may be placed on
trial for her life.
Experts skilled in chemistry and toxi
cology will have much to do In deciding
the fate of the accused woman. Eastern
dispatches have said the arsenic in the
bonbons was crystalline, the form which
Is used only for medicinal purposes. The
arsenic which Mrs. Botkin bought was
the adulterated powder used by taxider
mists and for vermin poisons.
Mrs. liotkin's admission that she bought
the arsenic obviates the necessity of
Clerk Grey's identification of her.
MRS. BOTKIN ADMITS
SHE BOUGHT ARSENIC
Bays a Friend Was With Her When
She Purchased tire Poison and
Two Others Saw Her
Use It.
Attorneys Knlpht ;tn<l McGowan, Mrs.
Botkin's legal champions, called on her
early yesterday forenoon. Their visits
were of longer duration than usual. Both
lawyers emphatically refused to discuss
the purchase of arsenic by their client at
the Owl Drug Store and positively de
clined to state whether she admitted buy
ing the poison.
I wfore the watchful newspaper men who
Interview every visitor leaving the ma
tron's room had arrived at their posts
yesterday one of Mrs. Botkin's closest
friends called .and had a long chat with
the prisoner. This friend, whose name is
suppressed by request, gives Mrs. Bot
kin's version of the purchase of the ar-
Fenlc on June 1. The friend referred to
8.-ild to a Call reporter:
"When I arrived at the prison Mrs. Bot
kin had read the morning papers, and
when I mentioned the significance which
the police attached to the sale of the ar
penic at the Owl Drug Store on June 1
Bhe said, with the utmost frankness and
without hesitation:
" 'The police need not worry about that
matter. I did buy two ounces of arsenic
on June 1 from Frank Grey. I used it
for the purpose which I stated when he
nsked me the customary questions pre-
Bcribed^by law.
" 'It will not be necessary for Mr. Grey
to come here and identify "mr. I frankly
admit I made the purchase. Furthermore,
I gave my right name and address. Does
that indicate that I contmplated sending
the poison over oowj miles to kill a woman
I never saw and never knew, except that
Bhe was the wife of J. R. Dunning?'
"Mrs. Botkin told me," said the friend,
"the purchase of the arsenic had slipped
from her mind, as it was only a slight in
cident, but she appreciates the effect the
discovery will have on her case. She ex
pressed the deepest regret that she for
got the circumstance, and declared she
would have mentioned It in her statement
to the Chief of Police had her memory
not been at fault. She then gave me all
the details of the purchase. She said:
"I went to the Owl to get aresenlc to
bleach my straw hats, because I was ac
quainted with Frank S. Grey. I had
known him for a long time when he was
employed at the Baldwin Pharmacy.
Whenever I needed any prescriptions
filled I went to him. I sincerely hope Mr.
Grey remembers all that transpired when
I bought that poison. I was in the store
quite a long time and chatted with 1 lrn
on several subjects. Why, when he was
questioning me and making the entry in
the poison register his interrogatories
wore interspersed with all manner of
commonplace remarks.
" 'An important point Mr. Grey ought
to recall Is that I was accompanied by a
friend that afternoon. This morning I
gave the name of this friend to my attor
neys, and have already received assur
ances that my story will be corroborated.
I told Mr. Grey I wanted the arsenic to
bleach my straw hats and he said there
â¢were other chemicals better adapted to
that purpose. I replied that I had used
arsenic before, and he gave me the poison
without further delay. He wrapped the
package, handed it to me, I paid for it
and left the store.
" 'I went directly home from the Owl.
prepared a solution with the arsenic I had
bought and cleansed my hats.
" 'Two reputable witnesses, whose
names are now in the possession of my
attorneys, were in my room and watched
me bleach the hats. They will take the
witneFs stand and substantiate what I
say or they will make affidavits in ad
vance of evidence in court if they are re
quested to do so.'
"Mrs. Botkin," said her friend, "does
not wish the names of her witnesses to
appear In the newspapers. She fears they
would be harassed and persecuted by de
tectives and reporters, and desires to pro
tect them from all annoyance."
EXTRADITION PAPERS
HERE FROM DELAWARE
Lees Hunting for More Evidem
Then He Will Lay tne Case Be
fore the Governor.
At noon yesterday Chief Lees received
from Governor Tunnell of Delaware the
long-expected requisition papers. With
the requistory document came a numer
ous bundle of affidavits of Delaware wit
nesses, and it is upon the showing of
evidence made In these, and upon af
fidavits that will be taken here, that
Governor Budd will be asked to turn
over to the Delaware authorities the per
son of Mrs. Botkin that she may be tried
for her life upon the charge that stands
agamst her.
Chief Lees is confident that he has, or
will have, within a very few days evi
dence to bring his plans to successful is
sue. The plan of the Chief is best told
in his own words. In an interview yes
terday lie said:
"We are at present busy gathering col
lateral evidence on the four main points
that characterize the case; the hand
kerchief, the arsenic, the candy and the
handwriting in the numerous letters. I
am now positive that the person who
wrote and addressed the anonymous let
ters and the person who sent the poison
ed candy are one and the same. lam
also satisfied beyond a doubt that both
box and candy came from the store of
Mr. Haas and that they were bougnt on
or about July 31.
"I have not yet succeeded in connecting
Mrs. Botkin with the purchase of the
candy, neither can 1 prove as yet that
she bought from the City of Paris the
handkercheif that accompanied the box.
On that point I am working to-day. I
have here the delivery and charge tags
of the store and they are being carefully
examined. The fact that a tag was dis
covered noting the sale- of a single hand
kercheif on August 4 is of no signficance,
as Mrs. Botkin could have bought one
on any of the numerous shopping trips
that we know she made at about that
time.
The arsenic purchase is the one clew
V/itta which we have directly connected
her, ar d 1 certainly do not believe that
sin: be light it for the use that appears
on the poison register of the Owl drug
store. 1 have the opinions of a number
of chemists and through them know thac
nrs< nic has no efficacy as a bleaching
agent. All of these matters 1 hope to
clear up within the next few days mj
that we may deliver the requisition
papers to Governor Budd.
"I do not feel at liberty to malte public
the text of either that document or the
affidavits as they are directed to the
Governor personally. As soon as they ar
rived I turned them over to Assistant
District Attorney Hosmer, and he prom
ised that by to-day he will have mapped
out a plan of action to pursue from now
on."
That Chief Lees considers the arsenic
clew a strong one is evident in that as
soon as the fact of its purchase by Mrs.
L'otkin had been laid before him he or
dered that every precaution be taken to
protect her against herself. No one but
her lawyers are permitted to see her with
out the presence of some one o' the de
partment. Every one who enters her cell
is carefully scrutinized, particularly the
members of her family whom, it is feared,
may seek to put in her possession some
means for ending her life.
This close surveillance has greatly wor
ried Mrs. Botkin. Last evening she
called for Captain Seymour and asked
him If she were to be deprived of the
visits of her relatives. Captain Seymour
promptly informed her that she was not,
nor of any one else she cared to receive,
pieviding no suspicious circumstances.at
tached to their presence.
To back up his contention that Mrs.
Botkin did not use the arsenic to bleach
her hat Chief Lees is searching for the
cast-off head gear worn at that time in
order that an analysis may be made of
the texture for traces of the poisonous
wash.
HAVING FUN WITH
THE AGED CHIEF
Attorney Knight Laughs at the Ef
forts of the Police Department
to Convict Mrs. Botkin,
"What do I think of the new 'arsenic
â¢discovery' of the Police Department?"
said George Knight yesterday evening in
reply to a question. "Why I was so
much interested in it that I haye 1 been
out on the bay all day throwing scud in
the faces of some of these fellows who
think they own fast launches.
"Coming to the point I did not consider
It of sufficient importance to inform Mrs.
Botkin of it. In fact, we are not par
ticularly concerned as to what Chief Lees
has done or may do. Notwithstanding
his 'forty years of experience' > c is in
many ways making a show of himself.
Oh, he is a bright one. He had the whole
business corraled in Stockton, in his
mind, and when that imaginary case van
ished into thin air he gathered himself to
gether and went on an entirely different
lay. He and his detectives searched the
records at the Owl Drugstore and suc
ceeded in finding nothing. Then a couple
of idle drug clerks looked the book over
and found that a Mrs. Botkin had bought
some poison on June 1. These amateurs
gave the old gentleman his cue, and it re
quired himself and four lieutenants to
verify the fact. Result, he returns to his
star chamber and Jollies himself with the
idea that he has his case made.
"Even granting for the sake of argu
ment that Mrs. Botkin did buy some
arsenic over two months before the crime
was committed, as a single fact it does
not amount to anything.
"Do you suppose he will search any
further In this great city to learn whether
or not anybody else bought arsenic?
There are very many women in this town
who know the man Dunning in a mannear

"Who is this man Dunning who dares
to stand forth as accuser and judge?
The betrayer of a good, true wife and

flying to the dogs here. He stays 2000
miles away and hides himself behind an
affidavit. May heaven help such a biped
for he needs some elevating assistance. '
"So far as Lees is concerned he ought
to be ashamed of his attitude in this
matter. That superannuated Argus of

more than one Stockton slough before he

to publicly announce that he proposed to

make statements to that Jury as Chief of
Police that he would not have dared to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1898.
LEES SUMS UP HIS EVIDENCE.
Last night Chief of Police Lees summarized the case against Mrs. Cor
delia Botkin in these words:
"In this city we have secured four important facts in the Dunning-
Deane murder case.
"First, the candy was bought at the store of George Haas & Son
about the 31st of July last, but the date Is not yet definitely fixed. On that
day Mrs. Botkin returned from a visit to Sto'ckton.
"Second, the handkerchief, which was inclosed in the bonbon box
was bought at the City of Parts dry goods store. We are now hard at
work to ascertain if Mrs. Botkin made that purchase and the date.
"Third, the superscription on the package, the note within and the
anonymous letters were undoubtedly written by the same person.
Whether that person is Mrs. Cordelia Botkin I am not prepared to say.
Experts will analyze and compare her known writing with these examples,
and their reports will have an important bearing on the case.
"Fourth, which is the most direct and important circumstance against
the accused woman, is the purchase by her on June 1 of two ounces of
arsenic, the toxic which caused the death of the two women.
"We are now gathering collateral evidence to join with these facts,
and in a few days will be prepared to go before Governor Budd and ask
that this woman be delivered to the authorities of Delaware.
"I cannot express an opinion as to the guilt or innocen^ of Mrs. Bot
kin, nor can I foreshadow the action of the Governor."
under a rope's end for years, but that
man is now practicing his profession in
this city. .
"It is the same in this case. With his
hundred eyes he can see nothing but this
woman he now has behind the bars.
"Let him go ahead. I propose to give
him all the rope he wants, and when he
ban succeeded in tangling himself up
thoroughly I suppose "he will announce
his readiness to proceed. However, if he
is not ready on Tuesdayâ if he wants
more time to dig up evidence or to wait
for some more candy clerks to give him
a helping handâ he can have it. We are*
ready now. Furthermore, we will favor
him in another way. He can have his
choice of a court in which to bring this
action on extradition to a hearing. Either
In the Federal or Superior Court or the
United States Supreme Court. That is
certainly a fair proposition. However, if
there is anything we have overlooked
that we can do to help the Chief along in
this painful complication we might also
extend that favor.
"There is a whole lot of quibbling and
hair-splitting about the arsenic In the
candy and that purchased at the Owl
'drug store. The latter is known to have
been in the powdered form, while that in
the candy was announced to have been
cr> stals. "You mark my words, when the
public accusation is made the people will
learn th.it the drug placed in the bon
bona was in the powdered form. That
will be all right, too. It can go along
with the other stupid blunders that have
been made in the case.
"It is a surprising sight to see Lees
using his utmost power to railroad this
woman to Delaware to stand for her
life. He ought to get somebody to blush
for him. What is the matter with our
courts? Why, over in that benighted land
they are still living under the blue laws.
They don't allow street cars to run on
Sunday and they cling to that brutal relic
of barbarism â the whipping post âto
which colored people and tramps are par
ticularly sentenced and carefully beaten
with a cat-o'-nine-tails. Just think of It.
If you and I were to be so unfortunate
as to go there with our San Francisco
customs we would stand a good chance of
getting a few welts ourselves that
wouldn't do us any good. It's too bad,
though, that they overlooked Dunning.
That kind of dissipation might have put
a little of the fear of the Lord in him.
"We have no misgiving as to the out
come of this affair. On the contrary we
propose to have some fun with the Chief,
and before he gets through with the Bot
kin case we will teach him some things
he has teen unable to learn In his 'forty
years' of experience."
THE POISON USED NOT
THE POISON BOUGHT
Pulverized Arsenic Was Purchased
at the Owl, but Crystallized Ar
senic Was Found in the
Candies.
An unexpected development may oc
cur in the case of Mrs. Botkin, the al
leged poisoner, when the chemist's report
on the poisoned candy is known. It has
been stated in Eastern dispatches that
the arsenic which was placed in the
chocolates sent to Mrs. Dunning was
materially different in form from the
arsenic sold to Mrs. Botkin by the Owl
Drug Store. That which was found in
the candy, if the dispatches are correct,
was medicinal arsenic in the crystalline
form, while the article which the accused
woman bought was the ordinary powder
used for vermin poison. Arsenic, or more
properly speaking, arsenous acid, once
pulverized, cannot again be crystallized,
or even caked, without the application of
Intense heat, applied in iron vessels, or
retorts. The process Is difficult and not
available to any one not possessing a
thorough knowledge of chemistry. Even
had Mrs. Botkin possessed the requisite
skill to perform this operation, there was
no possible reason Tor the act, as she
could have purchased the crystalline
arsenic just as well as the powdered.
Manager Blaisdell, of the Owl Drug
Store made a study of the matter bun
day, and last evening said: "There is a
grave doubt after all as to whether the
arsenic used in the chocolates came from
our store. If the crystalline form was
used as is claimed, then the Owl Drug
Store did not sell it to Mrs. Botkin. She
purchased the fine white powder. It can
not be changed into crystals or small
pieces by any action of moisture. Ar
senous acid will not cake, even when ex
posed to dampness for a long time in a
cellar The moisture in fresh chocolate
would not make it cohesive in the slight
est The powdered form of arsenous acid
is not always as pure as the crystalline.
Both kinds are sold. The powdering of
crystals is sometimes done in the drug
stores. In this case it is for future con
venience. Again powdered arsenic is
sometimes adulterated and is utilized In
the arts and for vermin poison. It is not
for medicinal use.
"It is easy to see how impossible it
was for Mrs. Botkin to have used the
powdered arsenic we sold her, if published
statements are correct. Once powder ar
senic and it cannot be again constructed
into crystals or even dough balls made
out of the fragments, unless great heat
and special apparatus is used.
"One thing that puzzles me is the way
Mrs. Botkin proposed to use the pow
dered arsenic which she did buy. It is
not customary to employ arsenic in
bleaching, especially on hats. Sulphu
rous acid is the common agent. Perhaps
she knew of a process, but it was cer
tainly an unusual one. ...
"The main point to be determined just
now is the form of arsenic placed in the
candy If it was crystalline then Mrs.
Botkin did not get it at our store."
Following up the arsenic clue, a Call
reporter visited the Victoria Hotel yes
terday and asked the landlady, Mrs.
Price, if she ever Baw Mrs. Botkin clean
a "No I saw nothing of 'the kind," re
plied Mrs. Pric6. "It is possible, of
course, that Mrs. Botkin may have used
the arsenic she purchased in bleaching
her straw hats, but I knew nothing of it.
She did not appear to have an unusual
number of hats. Her best was a black
straw She would not bleach that. But
really I cannot give any definite informa
tion on this point. The Japanese servant
who made up her bed every day, and who
might possibly have noticed if
she did any bleaching, has left the city.
There is no other person who could know,
and it is very doubtful about the Jap.
He only went to the room occupied by
Mrs. Botkin for a few minutes each
morning. Since many facts concerning
Mrs. Botkin have been sifted out," I have
studied very much over the case, trying
to hit upon some new evidence, but am
at fault. She was but one of many per
sons in my hotel, and I did not have any
reason to observe her particularly."
Inquiries made of more than a dozen
leading druggists in San Francisco re
vealed a general lack of knowledge of
the use of arsenic for bleaching pur
poses. Not one druggist would say that
he ever sold the poison for that purpose.
No reference is made to it as a bleaching
agent in the druggists' books. If Mrs.
Botkin used It for this purpose, It was
evidently on the strength of some pri
vate formula which she possessed.
Assistant District Attorney Joe Dunn
asked Dr. H. E. Morrison of the Harbor
Receiving Hospital yesterday as to the
possibility of powdered arsenic crystal
lizing in the mouths of those who eat it.
He referred to an article stating that
arsenic had been found in a crystallized
form in the mouths of those who had
partaken of the poisoned candy at Do
ver.
Dr. Morrison said in his opinion the
transformation under such circumstances
was impossible.
A SERMON ON THE
DOVER MURDERS
Rev. W. E. Dugan Draws a Lesson
From the Life of Mrs. Botkin
and the Charges Against
Her.
So keen is the popular Interest in the
murder of Mrs. J. P. Dunning in Dela
ware by the sending of a box of poisoned
candy from this city, that even the. pul
pit has taken the facts in hand and made
them the theme of a discourse. "Is Mrs.
Botkin Guilty?" was the subject of an
eloquent sermon by Rev. W. E. Dugan,
pastor of the Stewart Memorial United
Presbyterian Church, on Guerrero street,
near Twenty-third, last evening.
Rev. Mr. Dugan seems to favor the
theory that Mrs. Botkin is the gunty per
son, though withholding judgment until
more definite proof is obtained. In
dramatic language he pictured the story
of the murder and the clews leading to
Mrs. Botkin's arrest, and drew the in
ference that it was the mysterious work
of God that brought the facts to light in
order to show sinners the thorns in the
pathway of evil. In part the sermon was
as follows:
Mrs. Botkin has not yet been proved to be
guilty of the Dover tragedy, but It Is begin
ning to look in her case as if truth Is really
stranger than fiction. Circumstantial evidence
Is the strongest kind of evldeoce if It Is of the
right sort. While no human eye saw the
slim arm of deceit stretch across the continent
to lay Its finger of death on Mrs. Dunning, yet
the circumstances seem to be rising and point
ing with flrey fingers of justice at Mrs. Botkin
and saying, Thou art the gulltyÂ«one. The provi
dential circumstances of God seem to have
thrown their threads around that dark and
mysterious arm. and, winding themselves
tighter and tighter, are about to lead the guilty
one to Justice. The fact that the police can
trace the sale of that candy box to the indi
vidual clerk a month after the sale, whrn
millions of boxes of candy are sold daily, is
wonderful evidence of a God who works In the
affairs of men, and if It is shown that Mrs.
Botkin purchased that box who will dare to say
there Is not a God of justice whose all-seeing
eye looks out along every thread of circum
stance upon which the actions of men are
strung?
rWe have in the case of Mrs. Botkin an lllus
ration of the futility of selfish carnality to
give real lasting pleasure, and especially of
the tremeDdous guilt of trifling with the sanc
tity of thf married life. There are three
divine institutions, the State, the church and
the home or married life, and to trifle with any
of these incurs the wratn of the heart that
drives the resources of the universe. We shud
der at the presumption of the anarchist who
would destroy our State and give us instead a
howling mob of cutthroats; we are horrified at
the falsifier and fiend who would pull the
foundations from our churches, but to be
equally dreaded Is the enemy of mankind that
would destroy the third divine institutionâ the
family. If Mrs. Botkin is Innocent she is to
be pitied, but If guilty the punishment of per
dition Is too sweet for her.
THE IRISH FAIR.
Many Novel Attractions Provided
for the Closing Week.
This Is the last week of the Irish Fair
at the Mechanics' Pavilion and the at
tendance will be commensurate with the
attractions. Beginning with to-day,
which is a legal holiday, and with extra

big importance each day until the close
next Saturday night. The Celtic Union,
under whose auspices this fair Is being
held, will realize a considerable sum of
money.
For the holiday-seekers to-day there
will be souvenir Iriaii Fair spoons given
out to ladles buying tickets at the box
office. These spoOns were made for the
management and are put In separate

THE LINE OVER
THE PASS IS
NOW CERTAIN
A Private Corporation
Will Build It.
LOCAL CAPITAL INTERESTED
INCORPORATION PAPERS TO BE
FILED SOON.
The Beginning of a Transcontinental
System of Which the Valley
Road Is to Be a
Part.
The l!no over the mountain pnss south
of Bakersfleld will be built without the
shadow of a doubt. Within a few days
incorporation papers will bo filed with the
Secretary of State by a private corpora
tion formed for the purpose of building
a railroad over the celebrated Tejon Pass.
This will be the first step in the way of
another transcontinental system with San
Francisco as the western terminus.
Everything is in readiness for the new
company to begin work at once. The
articles of incorporation are already
drawn up, the officials named and all the
minute details necessary to be perfected
before the final stroke have received the
most careful attention. The members of
the corporation are all business men of
this city.
When the Valley road wished to extend
its line some time ago before the present
terminal was reached it was decided to
Issue new bonds. The people most inter
ested In the Valley road's success feared
that these bonds could not be floated on
this coast and that they would be forced
to place them in Eastern markets to ef
fect a sale. A great surprise was in store
for the Valley road promoters when they
discovered that the local financiers were
eager and even anxious to purchase these
bonds. The San Francisco capitalists took
them up with avidity. This was an in
dication of what might be expected in
case of the extension of the road south
of Bakersfield.
Shortly " after the completion of the
road to Bakersfield some of San Fran
cisco's prominent capitalists came to
f ether and decided to form a corporation
or the building of a road over the pass.
The magnitude of this undertaking is in r
comparable with any other railroad con
struction in the State. The road over the
mountains from Bakersfield south to con
nections with an Eastern line is seventy
miles long,, and the heaviest problems of
railroad building will have to be met In
the construction of the line. The capital
that will of necessity have to be invested
must also be great. The fact that the
necessary capital is forthcoming for the
building of this road bespeaks a com
bination of big and wealthy investors.
The line over the mountains will cer
tainly have Eastern connections. With a
terminus in San Francisco and a chain of
road to the East, the Valley road is des
tined to become one of the greatest roads
of the West. The officials of the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Railway have
known of the formation of the private
corporation to build the road over the
pass for some time. When it leaked out
there was a general reaching for Valley
stock and they then notified the holders
not to sell unless at par.
THROWN OUT OF A
SCENIC RAILWAY CAR
FOUR PERSONS INJURED AT
THE CHUTES.
Occupants Land on the Roof of the
Zoo and Are Conveyed to the
Park Hospital.
An accident occurred on the scenic rail
way at the Chutes last night that caused
Injuries to four persons and created in
tense excitement among the throng of
visitors. Rumors were quickly afloat
that very serious results had followed the
collison of a running car with another
that was standing on the traefc. But the
rumor was soon dissipated by the fact
that the four persons occupying the
standing car were thrown onto the roof
of the low building used as the Zoo.
Mr. and Mrs. J. S.. O'Reilly of Vallejo
and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Wessllng of 1515
Geary street were the Injured persons,
the most serious hurt being the sprained
arm sustained by Mrs. WeÃsling. The
others were bruised about the legs and
generaly shaken up, without lasting
hurts.
The car they occupied was obstructed
by something thrown on the track and
was struck by the one coming down be
hind it. The force was not strong enough
to demolish the car, but lifted it bodily
off the track and dumped me occupants
out. Their escape from more serious in
jury is a marvel, though in the conduct
of the railway all precautions are taken
to prevent accidents.
WHO WILL SUCCEED MORSE P
Directors of the German Hospital to
Appoint the New Surgeon on
Tuesday.
Much Interest centers in medical circles
as to who â¢will be appointed to fill the po
sition of staff surgeon of the German
Hospital â the place made vacant by the
recent death of Dr. John F. Morse.
During Morse's recent fatal illness and
since the lamented pnysician's demise Dr.
P. de Vecchl, consulting surgeon of the
hospital board, has kindly filled the po
sition of staff surgeon. Cognizant of Dr.
de Vecchl's skill and ability, and with the
Interests of the hospital at heart, the
board of directors were anxious that Dr.
de Vecchl present himself as a candidate
for the position. This honor, on account
of the stress of private practice, Dr. de
Vecchi was obliged to decline.
The candidates for the vacant post in
clude Dr. Fehleisen, Dr. Max Salomon,
Dr. Conrad Weil, the present Police Sur
geon; Dr. j>evison and Dr. Kugeler.
Drs. Fehleisen, Weil and Salomon have
the greatest following, and the contest
between these three gentlemen will prob
ably be a heated one. Many friends of
the hospital predict that the position will
be awarded to Dr. Fehleisen.
DEATH OF MISS TAYLOR.
Passes Away After a Brief Illness, a
Victim of Appendicitis.
Bessie Taylor, the accomplished daugh
ter of John Taylor, who is connected with
tho Spring Valley Water Company, died
yesterday afternoon after a brief Illness.
The unfortunate young woman was taken
ill two days ago with appendicitis and
at once removed to a private hospital.
Despite the efforts of two physicians she
breathed her last yesterday afternoon.
Always kind and gentle Miss Taylor
had endeared herself to everybody who
knew her, and her death Is severely
felt. She was possessed of a remarkable
voice, which was frequently heard at
church socials and other gatherings. Miss
Taylor was 23 years of age, and lived at
1419 Baker street. The funeral will take
place to-morrow from her late residence.
