SPAIN SUES FOR PEACE
AND ADMITS HER DEFEAT
A DIRECT
APPEAL TO
McKINLEY
Made Through the French
Embassador at Wash
ington.
The United States As^ed to For
mulate Terms for Concluding
the War.
NEW YORK, July 26.â The
Herald's Washington corre
spondent sends the following:
Spain has sued for peace. Ap
preciating the futility of indirect
methods of inducing the Ameri
cans to consent to terms of
peace, the Madrid authorities
have come out openly, frankly
admitting their defeat and direct
ly asking the United States for
a statement of terms upon which
it would be willing to end the
war. This important and deli
cate mission was intrusted to M.
â "Camborir the--Frertch-Embnssa
dor, the official representative of
Spain in Washington since the
beginning of the war. Embassa
dor Cambon, accompanied by M.
Thiebaut, first secretary of the
French Embassy, called at the
White House shortly after 3
o'clock and formally presented
President McKinley a message
from the Spanish Government,
the purport of which was subse
quently officially announced by
the Embassador in these words:
The French Embassa
dor,on behalf of the Gov
ernment of Spain, and
by direction oF the Span
ish Minister of Foreign
Affairs, presented to the
President thisafternoon
a message from the
Spanish Government
looking to the termina
tion of the war and the
settlement of the terms
of peace.
Momentous was the mission intrusted
to M. Cambon, and correspondingly Im
pressive the scene which occurred dur
ing its execution. A Cabinet officer
who learned all the details of what
passed between President McKinley,
â¢Secretary Day and his distinguished
callers described them to me to-night.
The message which he presented to the
President had been sent in cipher by
the Madrid Government to the French
embassy via Paris. Ab soon aa the
message reached the Embassador it
was translated and a note was drawn
up In English.
The mfssage was described by a high
official as a dignified and courtly docu
ment, thoroughly good in terms, but

SPAIN'S CABINET
COUNCIL DISCUSSES
THE PEACE QUESTION.
MADRID (via Paris), July 26. â The Government de
nies that the Cabinet council occupied itself with the ques
tion of peace, although Senor Gamaza, Minister of Public
Instruction and Public Work?, made a long speech on the
subject.
Senor Sagasta denies the existence of official peace ne
gotiations, but Duke Almodovar de Rio, Minister of For
e-gn Affairs, says negotiations of a private character have
been opened, due to private initiative.
The council discussed the landing in Porto Rico and its
consequences. Nothing new was announced with reference
to the situation in Cuba or the Philippines.
The San Francisco Call
' suffering as a result of the war. It was
! taken to the White House by M. Cam
! bon, who was accompanied by M. Thie
' baut, first secretary of the embassy.
I The President and Secretary Day had
previously been notified of their call,
I and Mr. Day had been closeted with
] the President half an hour before the
' arrival of the diplomats. The French
j representatives were escorted to the
blue room, and later, at the invitation
of the President, they ascended to the
second floor, where they entered the
| private room of the President. Mr. Mc-
Kinley, who entered by a side door,
walked over and greeted the Embassa
dor, and then his secretary closed the
: door by which they had entered and
courteously invited his callers to be
seated. Before complying the Embas
sador announced in French, which was
translated by M. Thiebaut. that with
the. consent of his Government he called
to deliver from the Qu^en Kegem of
Spain a message having: as its object
the. termination of the war between the
United States and Spain, which his sec
retary would read.
M. Cambon then took his seat, the
President sank into an armchair just
before him and Secretary Day occupied
a chair to the right of the President.
M. Thiebaut remained standing and
: read the message. As told to me to
night by an official familiar with its
contents, it is briefly:
. "The Government erf the United
States and the Government of Spain
are unhappily at war as a result of the
demand of the United States that Spain
would withdraw from Cuba, which de
mand she refused to comply with. In
the contest of arms which followed
Spain admits that she has been worsted
and that her sufferings as a result are
very great. She believes that the time
has now come when she can properly
ask the co-operation of the United
States in terminating the war, and,
therefore, asks to be furnished, through
the French Embasador, with a state
ment of the terms upon which the
United States would be willing to make
peace."
That the President appreciated the
gravity of the message, I am told, was
evidenced by the close attention he
gave to M. Thiebaut aa he was reading
the document. The light coming from
the south through three broad windows
in the circular wall fell upon the Presi
dent, seated in a great armchair, listen
ing intently to the words which slowly
dropped from M. Thiebaut's lips. Di
rectly in front of a large white sofa sat
the Embassador, dressed in diplomatic
garb, his monocle in his right eye. To
the right of the President and at one
end of the sofa; silent, Impassive, his
legs crossed, was Secretary Day,
weighing each word, each sentence, and
preparing to raise questions which he
would put to the Embasador for reply
when the reading was concluded. To
the left of the President stood the Sec
retary of the Embassy, several pages
of the message closely held in his left
hand, reading the words slowly, as if
he desired the President and Secretary
of State to consider each word aa he
dropped it. Just back of the President,
unrolled on a circular table, was the

cause of the message â maps of Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines.
When M. Thiebaut had finished read-
Ing he nan-led the message to the Em
bassador. Mho pave it to the President.
The President then invited M. Thie
baut to be seated on the sofa next to
his chief. He expressed gratification at
the receipt of the message, saying lie
was very glad to receive it from the
hands of the French Embassador, that
in view of its gravity he would like,
before making reply, to discuss it with
his Cabinet, and he begged the Embas
sador to kindly call for an answer,
whl^h he would be g!ad to make to the
Queen Regent of Spain through him,
and that the BSaabaftsador would be ad
vised by the Secretary of State when
to return.
This olosed the official ceremony. A
general conversation thon began be
tween the President and Embassador
with Secretary Day occasionally ask
ing a question, the questions and an
swers being translated into French by
M. Thiebaut. Embassador Cambon
was unable to tell the President what
concessions Spain would make to ob
tain peace, and Mr. McKinley did not
Indicate what terms his Government
would be willing to give. Then there
were a great many sentences in the
message which the President desired to
more perfectly understand and he
asked M. Cambon to explain them at
length. The time passed quickly in
such conversation, and when the
French diplomat arose to leave It was
found that their call had lasted three
quarters of an hour.
Before departing the President sug
gested that it would be wise to prepare
a statement for the press, and M. Thie
baut volunteered to take it down. Sec
retary Day dictated to him upon a
piece of paper torn from an envelope in
which the message had been inclosed
the statement which begins this report
of the proceedings.
Spain having Inserted the entering
wedge in the direction of peace, the
great question now is whether an
agreement can be reached as to the
terms. Upon President McKinley de
volves the duty of making the first
definite proposition. He has a very
good general idea of the minimum de
mands which he will make, but it will
be several days before he will commu
nicate with Embassador Cambon.
Meantime he may be influenced by
what he can learn about public senti
ment throughout the country, and es
pecially among the Senators who will
have to ratify any treaty of peace that
may be agreed upon with the Spanish
representatives.
Although no formal statement will
now be made as to what the Presi
dent will demand, it may be safely
stated as a result of the conversations
I have had during the last few days
with members' of the Cabinet that
these, briefly, are the minimum terms
to be acceptable to the administration:
Complete independence of Cuba un
der the protection of the United States;
absolute cession to the United States
of Porto Rico and the Ladrones; a
coaling station in the Philippines.
The extreme concessions that Spain
is supposed to be willing to make are:
Cession to the United States of Porto
Rico; cession to the United States of
Cuba rather than recognition of the
Independence of the island. It will be
! seen that there is comparatively little
'â  difference between the demands of the
; United States and the extreme con
cessions of Spain as to Cuba and Porto
: Rico. If these islands alone were to be
' considered there is reason to believe
the basis of peace could be soon agreod
upon. Questions that will arise M to
the disposition of the Philippines and
the Ladrones will probably give the
negotiators Berloua trouble. Spain will
probably first yield to the demand for
the cession of the Ladrones and will hold
out to the last to preserve intact her
I Philippine colony, which will be her
1 only possession of Importance outside
I of thp peninsula after Cuba and Porto
! Rico have been Riven up. Neither v
i ernment, however, will allow the qu< i
i tion of the Ladrones to delay peacr-.
The United States will dema.nd a.Â«
absolutely ess, tlal to peace the ces
sion of a coalinrr stati-m and a port in
the Philippine*, and whether anything
more will be demanded in these islands
will depend on the progress of events,
and perhaps !n no small degree upon
the expressions of public opinion in the
United States, between the present
and the time when actual negotiations
as to the details of the peace treaty
are taken up.
A.s to Cuba, Spain Is believed to bÂ«
ready to give more than the United
States asks. The President will de
mand that Spain give up the Island in
trust to the United States, to be turn
ed over to an Independent Cuban gov
ernment as soon as such government
can be established on a stable basis.
Spain, it is believed, would prefer to
turn Cuba over to the United States
absolutely and have the island annexed
to this country.
The reason for this, as explain^ to
me by a person In a position to know,
is that the Spanish Government feels
that Spanish life and property will be
safer in the island under the Govern
ment of the United States than under
any government the Cubans might set
up. It is feared that if the Cubans
should be allowed an independent gov
ernment they would find means per
haps under the form of law to oppress
those residents of the islana who have
remained loyal to Spain throughout the
war and have refused to aid the insur
gents in any way.
The message from the Queen Regent
did not ask for n cessation of hostili
ties pending negotiations for peace,
and had such a request been made, it
would not have been granted. The ad
ministration will go on with the vigor
ous prosecution of the war in every di
rection Just the same if no peace prop
ositions had be^n received, and hostili
ties will not cease until some definite
understanding has been reached as to
the basis on which negotiations for the
final treaty are to he conducted.
If, after receiving the propositions of
Mr. McKinley, Spain indicates a will
ingness to make the basis of a final
treaty, and asks for an armistice, her
request will be complied with. It is
recognized here that the course of the
Spanish Government will probably de
pend in a great measure upon the tem
per with which the people of Spain re
ceive the propositions of the United
States. If it should appear that the
Spantsh people are bo tired of the war
that they are willing to pay almost uny
price, there may be little haggling over
the Philippine Islands, which will form
a bone of contention, and an armistice
will be speedily agreed to.
If, on the other hand, there are indi
cations that any yielding by Spain on
this point would cause grave civil dis
orders, thf final termination of hostil
ities wouirl be delayed. The Spanish
Ministry probably realizes, however,
that every day of delay will make the
conditions imposed by the United
States more onerous, and will increase
the danger of the absolute loss to Spain
of the entire Philippine group.
I have reliable information that the
action of Spain In proposing peace ne
gotiations at this time was brought
about by :i desire to save thÂ° Philip
pine Islands. General Merrltt is due
to arrive at Manila In a few days with
4000 more troops. The Monterey and
Monadnock will arrive about the same
time to reinforce Admiral Dewey's al
ready formidable fleet, and then, un
less peace should intervene, active land
operations against the Spanish army in
the islands would begin. Should Spain's
land foives in the Philippines be as
thoroughly defeated r>s her navy, and
there is reason to believe this will be
so if the war is continued for only a
few weeks longer, the problem for the
final disposition of the islands will be
greatly complicated. It is difficult to
see how Spain could regain control
over them with Aguinaldo and his in
surgent followers ready to oppose
every attempt in that direction. Pres
ident McKlnley may be compelled, by
the existing situation, to Insist upon
terms which would leave the United
States practically in control of all the
islands.
Of this question of the disposal of
the Philippines the President will hear
a great deal in the next few days. He
will be strongly urged by the extreme
advocates of territorial expansion to in
sist upon their retention by the United
States as a colonial possession. Others
will urge him to set up a native gov
ernment under a protectorate by the
United State*, and still others will im
press upon him the importance of end
ing the war and preventing the sacri
fice of more American lives, and will
urge that the question of the Philip
pines be not allowed to stand in the
way of reaching this end.
Secretaries Alger and Long were at
the White House during the afternoon,
and in the evening the President was
joined by Secretaries Bliss and Wil
son and Postmaster General Smi:h.
There was no Cabinet meeting in the
ordinary sense, but these talks with
individual members were as a formal
meeting.
It is considered likely that one means
likely to be proposed is to author;ze
direct negotiations between Spain and
this country, Spain being represented
by Senor Leon Castillo, Spanish Em
bassador at Paris, and the United
States by General Horace Porter, our
Embassador to France. Senor Castillo
is one of the foremost diplomats of
Europe, and General Porter, while not
a veteran in diplomacy, is regarded as
able and tactful, and every move
would be regulated by explicit instruc
tions from Washington. This plan is
quite tentative, however, and it is
rather doubtful whether the United
States Government would consent to
have such negotiations removed so far;

SURRENDER
OF MANILA
Augusti Is Said to H ave
Yielded to Admiral
Dewey.
Probably Prefers Falling Into the
Hands of the American
Forces.
MADRID, July 26 (n p. m.). â Information has been re
ceived here to the effect that Captain General Augusti has sur
rendered the city of Manila to the American forces commanded
by Admiral Dewey and Generals Anderson and Greene.
The Spanish garrison was short of ammunition, and food
and water were both scarce, the insurgents having" control of
the pumping works, and having surrounded the city so as to
prevent any supplies being sent to the enemy.
It is believed that rather than yield to the insurgents the
captain general decided to give up the city to the Americans.
Several days ago a message was received by the Minister
of War from Augusti, stating that an attack on the city by the
American forces was expected at any moment, and that grave
events were about to occur. It is now believed that this was
intended as a warning to the Ministry that the city would be
given up to avoid useless bloodshed.
Conditions at Manila have been causing the deepest anx
iety of late. The Government believes that the town has been
bombarded by the American warships, and that it was simulta
neously attacked on the land side by 12,000 Americans and 20,
000 rebels.
Captain General Augusti has about 10.000 European sol
diers, sailors and marines. He has been sorely embarrassed by
the non-combatants, but he was nevertheless expected to make
a prolonged resistance, unless the lack of provisions and water
compelled him to consider the sufferings of the inhabitants.
In any case, it has been understood that he would only surren

LANDS TO BE TAKEN IN
LIEU OF INDEMNITY
LONDON, July 27.â The London
morning papers agree that it will be
impossible for Spain to pay indemnity,
and that it is impossible that the
United States will demand money com
pensation. They all concede that the
Spanish flag has gone forever from
Cuba and Porto Rico.
The question of the future of the
Philippine Islands is universally admit
ted as presenting grave uifficulties, ow
ing to the impossibility of granting in
dependence, rhe general opinion is
that the Lnited States will retain a
coaling station and have a reversion
in the islands.
The Daily News says: "It would be
an act of extreme generosity to leave
Spain in possession of the Philippines,
but generosity is often the best policy.
If the United States should be content
with such a reward of its labors as
would leave the Philippines to Spain, it
would set the world an example of con
spicuous magnanimity."
The Daily Chronicle thinks that some
kind of International protectorate over
the Philippines should be arranged.
The Dally Mail says: "We hope
President McKinley will be moderate.
Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines
should be ample compensation without
indemnity."

MADRID, July 26.â The Ministerial El Correo, in an
important article declaring that the seizure of Porto Rico is
"only an afterthought on the part of the United States,"
says: "The Washington Government cannot ignore the

international law, acts posterior to these steps cannot be ta

inevitable, advises her to "face the
facts of the po tical situation with the
same frank courage which secured the
respect of the Americans on the battle
field."
Discussing the probable terms of
peace, the Times says: "The United
States will probably take Porto Rico
in lieu of a money indemnity, and it
would be best for the world at large if
America boldly undertook the burden
of giving Cuba and the Philippines a
strong, honest government through
American officials. If Spain is permit
ted to reassume sovereignty over the
Philippines, she will have to engage in
a war v. conquest, which might be at
tended with serious consequences to
American and other international in
terests in the Pacific."
GERMANY TO RAISE
A CLAIM AT MANILA
LONDON, July 26.â The Berlin corre
spondent of the Times says: The Cologne
Q&xette, in an article evidently inspired,
â¢Â«ays it would be difficult to claim com
pensation for the loss of German linns
at Manila, because, though Spain is offi
cially mistress of the Philippines, she
has no voice there, but when a settled
Government has been provided for the
islands, then Germany will raise a claim.
The Gazette says, also, that Germany has
a* fleet at Manila for no other purpose
than to protect German interests while
anarchy reigns.

Bhlp was in the position mentioned above
when the Spanish squadron appeared In

The distance of the vessels

Imately the' positions of the vessels
as described above:
The Spanish vessels came rapidly out
of the harbor, at a speed estimated at
rrorn eight to ten knots and In the fol
lowing order: Infanta Maria Teresa
(flagship), Vizcaya. Cristobal Colon and
the Almirante Oquendo. The distance
between these ships was about 800 yards
which moans that from the time the first
one became visible in the upper reach of
the channel until the last one was out
of the harbor an interval of only about
twelve minutes elapsed. Following the
Oquendo at a distance of about 1200 yards
came the torpedo boat destroyer Pluton
and after her the Furor.
The armored cruisers, as rapidly as they
could bring their guns to bear, opened a
vigorous fire upon the blockading vessels
and emerged from the channel shrouded
in the smoke from their guns
The men of our ships in front of he
port were at Sunday "quarters" for in-
BPecUon. The signal was made simul
taneously from several vessels. "Enernv

was sounded. Ihe men cheered as they
sprang to their guns and fire was opened

Bhe was making sixteen and a half knots
and was rapidly closing on the Cristobal
Colon. She was not at any time within
the range of the heavy Spanish ships, and
her only part in the firing was to receive
the undivided fire from the forts in pass
ing the harbor entrance, and to fire a few
shots at one of the destroyers, thought at
the moment to be attempting to escape
from the Gloucester.
Tho Spanish vessels, upon clearing the
harbor, turned to the- westward in col
umn, Increasing their speed to the full
power of their e-npines. The heavy block
ading vessels, which had closed in to
ward thf Morro at the Instant of the en
emy p appearance and at their best speed
delivered a rapid fire, well sustained and
destructive, which speedily overwhelmed
and silenced the Spanish fire. The initial
spped of the Spaniards carried them rap
idly put the blockading vessels and the
rattle developed into a chase, in which
the Krooklvn and Texas had at the start
the advantage of position. The Brooklyn
maintained this lead until the Oregon
steaming with amazing speed from the
commencement of the acton, took first
place. The Towa and Tndlana had done
good work, and not having the speed of
the other ships, were directed by me In
succession at about the time the Vizcaya
was beached to drop out of the ehas* and
resume blockading stations. These ves
sels rescued many prisoners. Tho Vixen
finding that the rush of the Spanish ships'
would nut her between two fires, ran out-
Bide of her own column and remained
thfre during the battle.
The skillful handling and gallant fight
ing of the Gloucester won the admiration
of every one who witnessed It and merits
the commendation of the Navy Depart
ment. She is a fast and entirely unpro
tected auxiliary vesselâ the yacht Cor
picanaâand has a battery of light rapid
fire guns. She was running about two
miles from the entrance to the eastward
and immediately started out, firing upon
the large ships. Anticipating the appear
ance of the Pluton and Furor the Glou
cester was slowed, thereby gaining more
rapidly a high pressure of steam, and
when the destroyers came out she steam
ed for them at full speed and was able
to close at short range, where her fire
was accurate, deadly and of great vol
ume. During this fight the Gloucester
was under thp fire of the Socapa battery.
Within twenty minutes from the time
they emerged from Santiago harbor the
careers of the Furor and Pluton were
ended and two-thirds of their people
killed. The Furor was beached and sunk
in the surf; the Pluton sank in deep wa
ter a few minutes later. The destroyers
probably suffered much Injury from the
tire of the secondary batteries of the In
diana, lowa and the Texas, and yet I
think a very considerable factor In their
speedy destruction was the fire at close
range of the Gloucester's battery. After
rescuing the survivors of the destroyers
the Gloucester did excellent service in
landing and securing the crew of the In
fanta Maria Teresa.
The method of escape attempted by the
Spaniardsâ all steering in the same direc
tion and in formationâ removed all tac
tical doubts or difficulties and made plain
the duty of every United States vessel to
close in and immediately engage in pur
suing these ships which was promptly
and effectually done. As already stated,
the first rush of the Spanish squadron
carried it past a number of blockading
ships, which could not immediately work
up to their best speed, but they suffered
heavily in passing. The Infanta Maria
Teresa and the Oquendo wore probably
set on fire by shells fired during the fif
teen minutes of the engagement. It was
afterward learned that the Infanta Ma
ria's fire main had been cut by one of our
first shots and that she was unable to
extinguish the fire. With large volumes of
smoke rising from their lower decks aft
these vessels gave up both fight and
flight and ran in on the beachâ the Infan
ta Maria Teresa about 10 : 1 "â  a. m. at Min
amina, six and a half miles from Santi
ago harbor entrance, and the Almirante
oquendo at about 10:30 a. m. at Juan
tj'.nzales, seven miles from the port.
The Ylzcaya was still under the fire of
the leading vessels; the Cristobal Colon
liad drawn ahead, leading the chase, and
soon passed beyond the range *of the
guns of the leading American ships. The
Vizcaya was soon set on tire and at 11:1:"
she turned in shore and was beached at
Aserradero, fifteen miles from Santiago,
burning fiercely and with her reserve of
ammunition on deck already beginning
to explode. When about ten miles west
of Santiago the Indiana had been sig
naled to go back to the harbor entrance,
and at Aserradero the lowa was sig
naled to "resume blockading station."
The lowa, assisted by the Ericsson and
the Hist, took off the crew of the Viz
caya, while the Harvard and the Glou
cester rescued those of the Infanta Ma
ria Teresa and the Almirante Oquendo.
This rescue of prisoners, including the
wounded, from the burning Spanish ves
sels, was the occasion of some of the
most daring and gallant conduct of the
day. The ships were burning fore and
aft, their guns and reserve ammunition
were exploding and it was not known
at what moment the fire would reach the
main magazines. In addition to this a
heavy surf was running just insid^of the
Spanish ships. But no risk deterred our
officers and men until their work of hu
manity was complete.
There remained now of. the Spanish
ships only the Cristobal Colon, but she
was their best and fastest vessel. Forced
by the situation to hug the Cuban coast,
her only chance of escape was by superior
and sustained speed. When the Vizcaya
went ashore the Colon was about six
miles ahead of the Brooklyn and the Ore
gon, but her spurt was finished and ihe
American ships were now gaining upon
her. Behind the Brooklyn and the Oregon
came the Texas, Vixen and New York.
It was evident from the bridge of the
New York that all the American ships
were gradually overhauling the chase and
that she had no chance of escape. At
12:60 the Brooklyn and the Oregon opened
fire and got their rangeâ the Oregon's
heavy shells striking beyond herâ and at
1:10 she gave up without firing another
shot, hauled down her colors and ran
ashore at Rio Toruquino, forty-eight
miles from Santiago. Captain Cook of
the Brooklyn went on board to receive
the surrender. While his boat was along
side I came up in the New York, received
his report and placed the Oregon in
charge of the wreck to save her, if pos
sible, and directed the prisoners to be
transferred to the Resolute, which had
followed the chase. Commodore Schley
whose chief of staff had gone on board
to receive the surrender, had directed
that all their personal effects should be
retained by the officers. This order 1 did
not modify. The Cristobal Colon was not
injured by our firing, and probably is not
much Injured by beaching^ though she
ran ashore at high speed. The beach was
so steep that she came off by the working
of the sea. But her sea valves won,
opened and broken, treacherously, I am
sure, after her surrender, and despite all
efforts she sank. When it became evident
that she could not be kept afloat she was
pushed by the New York bodily upon the
beach, the New York's stem being placed
against her for this purposeâ the shin
being handled by Captain Chadwlck with
admirable- judgmentâ and sank in shoal
water and may be saved. Had this not
been done she would have gone down In
deep water and would have been, to a
certainty, a total lorb.
I regard this complete and Important
victory over the Spanish forces as the
successful finish of several weeks of ar
duous ard close blockade, so stringent
and effective- during the night that the
enemy was deterred from making the at
tempt to escape at night and deliberately
elected to make the attempt In daylight
That such was the case I was informed
by the commanding officer of the Cris
tobal Colon.
It seems proper to briefly describe here
the manner in which this was accom
plished. The harbor of Santiago is nat
urally easy to blockade, there being but
one entrance, and that a narrow one
and the deep water extending close up
to the shore line, presenting no difficul
ties of navigation outside of the en
trance. At the time of my arrival before
the portâ July Iâ the moon was at its
full, and there was sufficient light during
the night to enable any movement out
side of the entrance to be detected. But
with the waning of the moon and the
coming of dark nights there was oppor
tunity for the enemy to escape or for his
torpedo boats to make an attack upon
the blockading- vessels. It was ascer
tained with fair conelusivenesÃ that the
Merrlmac, so gallantly taken into the
channel on June 3, did not obstruct it I
therefore maintained the blockade as fol
lows:
To the little ships was assigned the
duty In turn of lighting the channel
Moving up to the port, at a distance of
from one to two miles from the Morroâ
dependent upon the condition of the at
mosphereâthey threw a searchlight beam
directly up the channel and held it

steadily there. This lighted up the entire !
I readth of the channel for half a mile
inside of the entrance bo brilliantly that
the movements of small boats could be â â 
detected. Why the batteries sever open- !
ed fire upon the searchlight ship was al
ways it matter of surprise to me, but i
they never did. Stationed close to the
entrance, of the port were three picket
launches and at a little distance farther j
out three small picket vesselsâ usually '
converted yachtsâ and when they were
available one or two of our torpedo boats. :
With this arrangement there was at least I
a certainty that nothing could get out j
of the harbor undetected. After the ar- I
rival of the army, when the situation !
forced upon the Spanish admiral a de
clslon, our vigilance Increased. The night
blockading distance was reduced to two j
miles for all vessels and a battle-ship was !
placed alongside the searchlight ship
with her broadside trained upon the
channel In readiness to /ire the instant
a Spanish ship should appear. The com
manding officers merit the greatest praise
for the perfect manner In which they en
tered Into this plan and put it into exe
cution. The Massachusettts. when, ac
cording to routine, was sent that morning
to coal at Guantanamo, like the others,
had spent weary nights upon this work,
and deserved a better fate than to be ab
sent that morning.
I Inclose for the information of the de
partment copies of orders and memor
anda Issued from time to time relat
ing to the manner of maintaining the
blockade.
When all the work was done so well
it is difficult to discriminate in
praise. The object of the blockade of
Cervera's squadron was fully accom
plished and each individual bore well his
part in itâ the commodore In command of
the second division; the captains of ships,
their officers and men. The fire of the
battleships was powerful and destructive,
and the resistance of the Spanish squad
ron was, in great part, broken almost
before they had got beyond the range of
their own forts. The fine speed of the
Oregon enabled her to take a front posi
tion In the chase and the Cristobal Colon
did not give up until the Oregon had
thrown a thirteen-inch shell beyond her.
This performance adds to the already
brilllant record of this fine- battleship and I
speaks highly of the skill and care with
which her admirable efficiency has been
maintained during a service unprece
dented In the history of vessels of her
class. The Brooklyn's westerly blockad- |
ing position gave her an advantage in |
the chase which she maintained to the i
end, and she employed her fine battery
with telling effect. The T*xas and the
New York were gaining on the chase
during the last hour, and had any acci- !
dent befallen the Brooklyn or the Oregon, !
would have speedily overhauled the Cris
tolbal Colon. From the moment the Span
ish vessel exhausted her first burst of ;
speed, the result was never in doubt. She i
fell, in fact, far below what might rea- j
sonably have been expected of her. Care- '
ful measurements of time and distance
give her an average speed, from the time
she cleared the harbor mouth until the
time she was run on shore at Itlo Tar
quino, of 13.7 knots. Neither the New !
York nor the Brooklyn stopped to cou- I
pie up their forward engines, but ran
OUt the chase with one pair, getting
steam, of course, as rapidly as possible j
on all boilers. To stop to couple up the
forward engines would have meant a de- !
lay of fifteen minutes, or four miles In !
the chase.
Several of the ships were struck, the I
Brooklyn more often than the others, but
very slight material Injury was done the
greatest being aboard the lowa. Our
loss was one man killed and one wounded
both on the Brooklyn. It is ditncult to'
explain this immunity from loss of life
or injury to ships in a combat with mod
em vessels of the best type, but Spanish
gunnery is poor at the best, and the su- :
pertor weiafht and accuracy of our fire j
speedily drove the men from their guns
and silenced their fire. This is borne out i
by the statements of prisoners and by i
observation. The Spanish vessels as I
they dashed out of the harbor, were fa- i
vored with the smoke from their own
guns, but this speedily diminished in vol
ume and soon almost disappeared. The
fire from the rapid-fire batteries of the I
battle-ships appears to have been remark- |
ably destructive. An examination of the
stranded vessels shows that the Akni
rante Oquendo especially suffered terribly
from this tire. Hgr sides are everywhere
pieroed and her decks were strewn with
the charred remainÃ of those who had
fallen.

A board appointed by me several
days ago has made a critical examina
tion of the vessels, both with a view of

rMODORE SCHLFY'S
THRILLING RFPORT
WASHINGTON, July 26.â The fol
lowing is Commodore Schley'L report:
North Atlantic Fleet, Second Squadron,
United States Flagship Brooklyn.
GUANTANAMO BAY, July 8, 1898.
Sir: I have the honor 10 make the fol
lowing report of that part of the squadron
under your command which came under
Imy observation during the engagement
with the Spanish fleet on July 3, 1898.
At 9:35 a. m. Admiral Cervera, with the
Infanta Maria Teresa, Vizcaya:, Oquendo,
Cristobal Colon and two torpedo boat de
stroyers, came out of the harbor of San
tiago de Cuba, in column at a distance,
and attempted to escape to the westward.
Signal was made from the lowa that the
enemy was coming out, but his move
ments had been discovered from this ship
at the same moment. This vessel was
the farthest west, except the Vixen, in
the blockading line. Signal was made to
the western division as prescribed in your
general orders, and there was immediate
and rapid movement inward by your
squadron and a general engagement at
ranges beginning at 1100 yards and vary
ing to 3000, until the Vizcaya was de
stroyed about 10:50 a. m. The concentra
tion of the fire of the squadron upon the
ships coming out was most furious and
terrific and great damage was done
them.
About twenty or twenty-five minutes
after the engagement began two vessels,
thought to be the Terror and Oquendo
and since verified as such, took fire from
the effective shell fire of the squadron
and were forced to run on the beach
some six or seven miles west of the ..ar
bor entrance, where they burned and
blew up later. The torpedo boat destroy
ers were destroyed early in the action,
but the smoke wan so dense in their
direction that I cannot say to what ves
sel or vessels the credit belongs. This
doubtless was seen better from your flae
ship.
The Vizcaya and Colon, perceiving the
disaster to their consorts, continued at
full speed to the westward to escape
and were followed and engaged in a run
ning fight by the Brooklyn, Texas, lowa
and Oregon until 10:30, wnen the Vizcaya
took fire from our shells. She put her
helm to port, and with a heavy list to
port stood inshore and ran aground at
Aserradero, about twenty-one miles
west of Santiago, on fire fore and aft
and where she blew up durin"- the night'
Observing that she had struck her col
ors, and that several vessels were near
ing her to capture and save her crew
signal was made to cease firing. The Ore
gon having proved vastly faster than tne
other battleships, she and the Brooklyn
together with the Texas and another ves
sel, which proved to be your flagship,
continued westward in pursuit of the Co
lon, which had run close inshore, evi
dently seeking some good spot to beach
If she should fail to elude her pursuers.
This pursuit continued with increasing
speed in the Brooklyn, Oregon and other
ships, and soon the Brooklyn and the
Oregon were within long range of the Co
lon, and the Oregon opened fire with her
13-lnch guns, landing a shell close to the
Colon. A moment auerward the Brook
lyn opened fire with her S-inch guns,
landing a shell just ahead of her. Sev
eral other Bhella were fired at the Colon,
now in range of the Brooklyn's and Ore
gon's guns. Her commander, seeing all
chances of escape cut off. and the de
struction awaiting his ship, tired a lee
gun and struck her flag at 1:15 p. m., and
ran ashore at a point some fifty miles
west of Santiago haroor. Your "flagship
was coming up rapidly at the tin;
was also the Texas and Vixen. A little
later, after your arrival, the Cristobal
Colon, which had struck to the Brooklyn
and the Oregon, was turned over to you
as one of the trophies of ihis great vic
tory of the squadron under your com
mand.
During my official visit a little later
Ccmmantjer Eaton of the Resolute ap
peared and reported to you the presence
of a Spanish battle-snip near Altares.
Your orders to me were to take the Ore
gon and go eastward to meet her, and
this was done by the Brooklyn, wl;n the
res,ult that the vessel reported is an
enemy was discovered to be the Aus
trian cruiser Infanta Maria Teresa, seek
ing the commander in chief.
I would mention for your consideration
that the Brooklyn occupied the most
westward blockading position with the
Vixen and. being more directly in the
route taken by the Spanish squadron, was
exposed for some minutes, possibly ten,
to the gun fire of three of the Spanish
ships and the west battery at a range of
1500 yards from the ships and about 3000
; yards from the batteries; but the vessels
j of the entire squadron, closing in rapidly,
I soon diverted this Tire and did magnificent
! work at close range.
I I have never before witnessed such
| deadly and fatally accurate shooting as
! was done by the ships of your command
! as they closed in on the Spanish squad
j ron and I deem it a high privilege to
commend to you for such action as you
! may dpem proper the gallantry and dash
; ing courage, the prompt decision and
skillful handling of their respective ves
i sels. of Captain Thilip, Captain Evans,
I Captain Clark and especially of my chief
I of staff, Captain Cook, who was directly
: under my personal observation, and
whose coolness, promptness and courage
were of the highest order. The dense
i smoke of the combat shut out from view
I the Indiana and Gloucester, but as these
vessels were closer to your flagship no
doubt thrir part In the conflict was under
your immediate observation.
Lieutenant Sharp. commanding the
Vixen, acted with conspicuous courage.

ships of the enemy with his light guns,
he, nevertheless, was close in to the bat
tle line under heavy fire, and many or
the enemy's shot passed beyond his ves
sel.
I beg to Invite special attention to tn?
conduct of my flag lieutenant, James H.
Sears, and Ensign Edward McCauley Jr.,
aid, who were constantly at my side dur
ing the engagement and who exposed
themselves fearlessly in discharging their
duties; also to the splendid behavior of
my secretary. Lieutenant B. Wells Jr.,
Wiio commanded and directed the lighting
of the fourth division with splendid ef
fect.
I would commend the highly meritori
ous conduct and courage in the engage
ment of Lieutenant Commander N. K.
Mason, the executive officer, whose pres- I
ence everywhere over the ship during its :
continuance did much to secure the good
results of this ship's part in the vic
tory.
The navigator, Lieutenant A. C. Hodg- i
son, and the division officers. Lieutenant i
T. D. Griffin, Lieutenant W. K. Rush, '
Lieutenant Edward Simpson, Lieutenant
J. G. Doyle, Ensign Charles Webster and
the junior divisional officers were most
steady and conspicuous in every detail of
duty contributing to the accurate firing
of this ship in her part in the great vic
tory of your forces.
The officers of the medical, pay and en
gineer and marine corps responded to
every demand of the occasion and were
fearless in exposing themselves. The war
rant officers, Boatswain William L. Hill,
Carpenter G. H., Warford and Gunner F.
T. Applegate were everywhere exposed in
watching for damage, reports of which
were promptly conveyed to me.
I have never in my life served with a
braver, better or worthier grew than that
of the Brooklyn. During the combat,
lasting from 9:35 until 1:15 p. m., much of
the time under fire, they never flagged for
a moment and were apparently undis
turbed by the storm of projectiles pass
ing ahead, astern and over the ship.
The result of the engagement was the
destruction of the Spanish squadron and
the capture of the admiral and some 13UQ
to 1500 prisoners, with the loss of several
hundred killed â estimated by Admiral
Cervera at 600 men.
The casualties on board this ship were:
G. H. Ellis, chief yeoman, killed; J.
Burns, fireman, first class, severely
wounded. The marks and scars show that I
the ship was struck about twenty-five I
times, and she bears in all forty-one 'scars I
as the result of her participation in the
great victory of your force on July 3,
1898. The speerl-cone halyards were shot
away and nearly all the signal halyards
The ensign at the main was so shattered !
that in hauling it down at the close of the
action it fell in pieces.
I congratulate you most sincerely unon
this great victory to the squadron under
your command, and I am glad that I had
an opportunity to contribute in the least
to a victory that seems enough for all of
us.
I have the honor to transmit herewith
the report of the commanding officer and
a drawing in profile of the ship, showing
the location of hits and scars; also a
memorandum of ammunition expended
and the amount to fill her allowance
Since reaching this place and holding
conversation with several of the cap
tainsâCaptain Eulate of the Vizcaya and
the second in command of the "Colon
Commander Contrerasâ l have learned
that the Spanish Admiral's scheme was
to concentrate all fire for a while on the
Brooklyn and for the Vizcaya to ram
her, in hopes that if they could destroy
her their chance of escaping would be
increased, as it was supposed she was
the swiftest ship of your squadron. 1..,.s
explains the heavy 'fire mentioned and
the Vlzcaya's action in the earlier mo
ments of the engagement The execution
of this purpose was promptly defeated
by the fact that all the ships of the
squadron advanced into close" range and
opened an irresistibly furious and terri
fic fire on the enemy's souadron as it
was coming out of the harbor.
j. am glad to say that the injury sup
posed to be below the Brooklyn's" water
line was due to a water valve being
opened from some unknown cause and
flooding the compartment. The injury to
thÂ»: belt is found to be only slight and
tne leak small.
I beg to inclose a list of the officers
and crew who participated in the com
bat of July 3. 1898.
T cannot close this report without men

E. Clark of the Oergon. His vessel's

CAPTAIN CLARK TELLS
OF THE OREGON'S PART
WASHINGTON. July 26.â Following
is the report of Captain C. E. Clark
of the Oregon:
U.S. S. OREGON, First-rate. Off Santi
ago de Cuba. July 4, 1898.â Sir; I have
the honor to report that at 9:30 a. m.
yesterday the Spanish fleet was discov
ered standing out of the harbor at San
tiago de Cuba. They turned to the west
ward and opened flre, to which our ships
replied vigorously. For a short time
there was an almost continuous flight of
projectiles over this ship, but when our
line was fairly engaged and the lowa had
made a swift advance, as if to ram or
close, the enemy's flre became defective
in train as well as range. The ship wa3
only struck three times, and at least two
of them were by fragments of shells.
We had no casualties.
As soon as it was evident that the ene
my's ships were trying to break through
and escape to the westward we went
ahead at full speed with the determina
tion of carrying out to the utmost your
order: "If the enemy tries to escape
the ships must close and engage as soon
as possible and endeavor to sink his ves
sels or force them to run ashore." We
soon passed all of our ships except the
Brooklyn, bearing the broad pennant of
Commodore Schley. At first we only
used our main battery, but when it was
discovered that the enemy's torpedo boats
were following their ships, we used our
rapid-fire guns as well as the six-pound
ers upon them with telling effect. As
we ranged up near the sternmost of their
ships, she headed for the beach, evi
dently on fire. We raked her as we
passed, pushing on for the next ahead,
using her starboard guns as they were
brought to bear, and before we had her
fairly abeam, she, too. was making for
the beach.
The two remaining vessels were now
some distance ahead, but our speed had
increased to sixteen knots, and our flre,
added to that of the Brooklyn, soon sent
another, the Vizcaya, to the shore in
flames. Only the Cristobal Colon was left
and for a time it seemed as if she might
escape, but when we opened flre with our
forward turret guns and the Brooklyn
followed, she began to edge in toward
the coast, and her capture or destruction
was assured. As she struck the beach
her flag came down, and the Brooklyn
signaled "Cease firing," following with,
"Congratulations for the grand victory;
thanks for your splendid assistance."
The Brooklyn sent a boat to her and
when the admiral came up with the New
York and Texas and Vixen she was taken
possession of. A prize crew was put on
board from this ship under Lieutenant
Commander Coggswell, the executive of
ficer, but before 11 p. m. the ship, which
had been filling, in spite of all efforts to
stop leaks, was abandoned, and just as
the crew left she went over on her side.
I cannot speak in too high terms of the
bearing and conduct of all on board this
ship. When they found the Oregon had
pushed to the front and was hurrying to

FIGHTING 808 EVANS'
INTERESTING STORY
WASHINGTON, July 26.â Captain
Robley D. Evans, commanding the
lowa, gives the following account of
his ship's action during the engage
ment:
U. S. S. lOWA. First-rate, Off Santiagode Cuba, July 4, IS9S.â Sir: I have the
honor to make the following report of
the engagement with the Spanish squad
ron .oli Santiago de Cuba on the 3d of
July:
On the morning of the 3d. while the
crew was at quarters for Sunday inspec
tion the leading vessel of the Spanish
squadron was sighted at 9:31, coming out
or the harbor of Santiago de Cuba. The
signal -Enemy's ships coming out" was
immediately hoisted and a gun fired to
attract attention. The call to general
quarters was sounded immediately, the
batury made ready for firing and the en-
Birtes run full speed ahead.
The Position of this vessel at the time
or sighting the squadron was the usual
blockading station off the entrance of the
Harbor. Morro Castle bearing about north
nd distant about three to four miles,
bteam at this time in the boilers was suf
licient for a speed of five knots.
-iuer sighting the leading vessel, the In
fanta Maria Teresa (Admiral Cerveras
flaeship). it was observed that she was
followed in cession by the remaining
tnrte vessels of the Spanish squadronâ the
\izcaya. Cristobal Colon and Almirante
Oquendo. The Spanish ships moved at
a speed of about eight to ten knots,
which was steadily increased as they
cleared the harbor entrance and stood to
the westward. They maintained a dis
tance of about RÂ».i yards between vessels.
The squadron moved with precision and
Its stations were well kept.
Immediately upon sighting the squad
ron the lowa headed toward the leading
Spanish ship. About 9:40 the first shot
was fired from this ship at a distance of
about 6000 yards. The course of this ves
sel was so laid that the range speedily
diminished. A number of shots were
fired at ranges varying between 6000 and
4000 yards. The range was rapidly re
duced to 2500 yards and subsequently to
2000 and to 1200 yards.
"When it was" tain that the Maria
Teresa would pass ahead of us the helm
was put to the starboard and the star
board broadside delivered at a range of
2T.00 -yards. The helm was then put to
port and the ship headed across the bow
of the second ship and as she drew ahead
the helm was again put to starboard, and
she received in turn th* full weight of our
starboard broadside at a range of about
ISOO yards.
The lowa was again headed off with
port helm for the third ship, and as she
approached, the helm was put to the
starboard until our course was approxi
mately that of the Spanish ship. In this
position, with a range of 1400 yards, the
lire of the entire battery, including the
rapid-fire guns, was poured into the ene
my's ship.
About 10 o'clock the enemy's torpedo
boat destroyers. Furor and Pluton, were
observed to have left the harbor and to
be following the Spanish squadron. At
the time that they were observed,
and in fact most of the time
that they were under fire, they
were at a distance varying from 4500 to
4000 yards. As soon as they were dis
covered the secondary battery of this
ship was turned or. them, while the main
battery continued to engage the Vlzcaya,
Oquendo and Maria Teresa.
The fire from the main battery of this
Fhip. when the range was below 2500
yards, was most effective and destruc
tive, and after a continuance of this tire
for perhaps twenty minutes, it was no
ticed that the Maria Teresa and Oquendo
were in flames and were being headed for
the beach. Their colors were struck about
10:20. and they were beached about eight
miles west of Santiago.
About the same time (about 10:25) the
fire of this vessel, together with that of
the Gloucester and that of another small
vessel, became so destructive that one
of the torpedo destroyers (the Pluton)
was sunk, and the Furor was so much
damaged that she was run on the rocks.
After having passed, at 10:35, the
Oauendo and Maria Teresa on fire and
ashore, this vessel continued to chase and
lire upon the Vizcaya until 10:36, when a
signal to cease firing was sounded on
board, it having been discovered that the
Vizcaya had struck her colors.
At 11 o'clock the lowa arrived in the
Vicinity of the Vizcaya, which had been
run ashore, and as it was evident that she
could not catch the Cristobal Colon and
that the Oregon, Brooklyn and New York
would, two steam cutters and three cut
ters were immediately Bent to the Viz
caya to rescue her crew. Our boats suc
ceeded in bringing of a large number of
officers and men cf that ship's company,
and in placing many of them on board the
torpedo boat Ericsson and the auxiliary
dispatch vessel Hist.

These two â wounds fortunately were not
of serious importance. Two or three other

flicting trifling damage, and four other
smail projectiles struck the hammock

There are no casualties among the
ship's company to report. No officer or
man was iniured during the engagement.
Nav.-il Cadets Trank. Taylor. Evans and
John K. Lewis and five men belonging to
the Massachusetts were on board the
lowa when the enemy's ships came out.
They wero stationed at different points

have done more' gallant service.
I take pleasure in stating to you, sir.
that the coolness and judgment of the ex

Raymond P. Rodgers. deserves, and will,
I hope, receive a proper reward at the
hands of the Government. The test of

The coolness of the "navigator. Lieuten

on th<^ upper deck, are worthy of the
greatest commendation. Other officers of
the ship did not come under my personal
observation, but the. result of the action
shows how well they did their duty.
I cannot express my admiratifin for my
magnificent crew. So long as the enemy
showed his flag they fought like Ameri

they were as gentle and tender as Ameri

special to the Herald says: Concern- j
ing the report that General Shafter re- I
fused to permit Admiral Sampson to |
sign articles of capitulation at Santiago j
until ordered to do so by the President, j
I am informed that neither General i
Shafter nor Admiral Sampson signed j
the document. There was, however, ;
some question raised about the pro- I
priety of Admiral Sampson partlcipat- j
ing in the negotiations for the surren

I am told that Admiral Sampson rep- >
r<=-s~r:ted to General Shafter* that as a
matter of right he should be allowed to i
sign the articles of capitulation.
At the time he made this request the j
papers had already been placed In the
hands of Colonel John Jacob Astor to |

Shafter found it Impossible to comply
with Admiral Sampson's request even

the additional information that m* had j
not signed the articles himself and that j
they were signed only by the commls- '

WASHINGTON. July 26.â The War
Department feels that It has reason to
be gratified with the results established

It is explained that th^ dlscr<=-pancy
in this statement and the one published
a week ago, which paused sn much
criticism and put several States, in
cluding Massachusetts, Nebraska and
North Carolina In the unenviable posi

counted for by thf fact that, owing- to
the failure to make prompt reports,
these States appeared to be deficient.

DIES FOR LOVE
OF SAN DIEGO
Invalid Prefers Suicide
to Returning East.
ENDS LIFE WITH A BULLET
MILWAUKEE WOMAN'S TRAGIC
LEAVE-TAKING.
Daughter of Editor Aiken Kills Hei# i
self Rather Than Depart From
the xTetty City of the
Southland.
l
Special Dispatch to Ttoe Call.
SAN DIEGO, July 26.â Mrs. Alice
Aiken Bremer of Milwaukee, who ar
rived here six months ago for her
health and since was a guest of the
Horton House In this city, committed
suicide in her room at the hotel last
night by shooting herself through the
head with a revolver, the bullet enter
ing the brain behind the right ear. She
was about 39 years of age and of at
tractive appearance. Her husband,
Hugo Bremer. a retired real estate
dealer of Milwaukee, arrived here
three weeks ago to join her. So far as
known they were on good terms, but
occupied separate rooms at the hotel.
It is said the woman was attached
to San Diego and was determined to
remain here. Her husband came to
endeavor by personal solicitation to get
her to return East with him. ShÂ»
steadily refused his Importunities until
recently and they finally agreed to
leave for the East this morning. He
would not leave without her and after
a consultation last night she evidently
decided to end It all by the suicide
route. She wrote a letter addressed to
her husband, which she left on a table,
saying that she had concluded this was
the best way to end her troubles.
As nearly as can be ascertained Mrs.
Bremer at about midnight laid down
on her bed fully dressed and fired the
fatal shot.
The body will be cremated at her re
quest, made in the letter referred to.
The Coroner's jury this morning evi
dently concluded at its first session
that th<=> cause of death was not en
tirely definite and ordered a po^t mor
tem examination to be made.
During her six months' residence
here Mrs. Bremer had improved in
health materially, her trouble having
been nervousness and insomnia. She
was delighted with the place and its
beneficial effecta She was bright and
cheerful and made many friends. She
made a specialty of the study of sea
moss and plants and other forms of
vegetable life, spending conslderaable
time on the seashore making collec
tions. Mrs. Bremer seemed less cheer
ful the r>ast few days and made no se
cret of the fact that she regretted hav
ing to leave here for the East.
Th^re was nothing In her letter to
her husband hinting of unpleasant re
lations between them. It merely stated
that she had decided to take her life
and to end her trouble, and asked that
her body be cremated; that her jew
elry, except her wedding ring, be given
to her sister. The ring she wished left
on her hand.
Mrs. Bremer was a daughter of Edi
tor Alken <>f the Evening Wisconsin of
Milwaukee, one of the leading dailies
of that State. She had been married
fourteen years, but had nn family. The
revolver she used had been in her po
session many years. The course of the
bullet showed conclusively that the
shot was self-inflicted.
SHE POSSESSED WIDE
SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
MILWAUKEE. July 26. -Mrs. Brem
er, who committed suicide in Ran
Diego, was a daughter of A. J. Aiken,
proprietor of the Evening Wisconsin in
this city. Her maiden name was Alice
Aiken. Phe had been in California some
months, and latest advices received re
garding her health were to the effect
that she was improving. Mr. Bremer
left Milwaukee recently to visit his
wifp at San Diego, after which he in
tended to cross the Pacific for a trip
to the Orient.
Mrs. Bremer left Milwaukee in Jan
uary for the West. For years she had
beeq an earnest biological student, and
had looked forward to the trip to the
West to find and study certain species
of seaweed. Her scientific knowledge
was wide, and extended to other
branches, notably astronomy.
In Milwaukee she was a member of
thÂ« Woman's Club, the College En
dowment Association and the Ladies'
Art and Science Class. Last year In
Massachusetts she read a paper on
"Biology," which attracted "wide at

United States, which left Guantanamo
Bay during the evening of Thursday
last, July 21, was landed here success
fully to-day, after a skirmish between
a detachment of the Spanish troops and
a crew of thirty belonging to the launch

MADRID. July 26.â An official dis
patch from San Juan de Porto Rico
confirms the report of an American
landing at Puerto de Guanica. The
Spaniards had one officer killed and
three soldiers wounded. The Ameri
cans, with strong artillery forces, have
established themselves on shore.
WASHINGTON. July 2Câ Secretary
Alger said to-night that the troops on
transports for Cuba had already re
ceived orders to proceed to Guanica,
where General Miles has landed, in
stead of going to the point first agreed
upon.

OUR FIRST FOOTHOLD IN PORTO RICO.
Map of the western third of Porto Rico, showing La Punta de Guan
ica on the southern coast, where the First Division of the American army of
Invasion, under General Miles, landed on Monday, and Barcelonita, on the
northern coast, where a second division will most probably land to-mor
row or the day after, with their strategic relation to Ponce, Yanco, Maya
quez and Areoibo, which, after San Juan, the capital, are the most popu
lous and important cities of the island.
La Puerta Guanica, the landing place chosen by General Miles for the
expedition under his command, was a most apt selection, whether designed
as a base of operations looking to the permanent occupation of the western
part of the island of Porto Rico or for more Instant and direct operations
in connection with other expeditions against San Juan itself.
After San Juan it is the best harbor on the whole coast, a landlocked
expanse of water offering commodious anchorage for a large number of
Bhips except those of deepest draught, with a roadstead in front, sheltered
by the high hills on all sides except the south and southeast.
Having long been the most important port on the island for the shipment
of coffee, it is well provided with landing wharves and piers, safely ap
proachable by small vessels and boats, besides having a number of large
stone warehouses used for storing coffee, etc., which will form a valuable
adjunct to the commissary department of General Miles' army.
Eight miles to the northeast of Guanica, and reached by a good road,
is the city of Yanco. with about 25,000 Inhabitants, at the terminus of the
railroad running through Guayanilla to Ponce, a place of some 30,000 people,
and the principal city and department headquarters of the southern and
southeastern part of the island. A good wagon road leads from Yanco to
Ponce, fifteen miles distant, and from the latter place, over the central
Cordilleras, via Coamo, Cazey and Cagjuas, a well-paved road, the "Camino
Real de Porto Rico." leads to San Juan, the capital, some one hundred and
twenty miles distant on the northern coast. The intervening country is high
and healthy, and ricM in resources.
From Ponce a coast road, more or less practicable for moving troops and
supply trains, runs by way of Adjuntas and ITtuado to Arecibo, on the
northern coast, a few miles to the east of which, at Barcelonita, a part of
General Brooke's command is expected to land within the next day or two.
These two landings give the Americans practical possession of one half of
the island and excellent co-operative bases for the reduction of San Juan
ajid the rest of this last Jewel of the Spanish crown.
at San Juan de Porto Rico, will also be
a passenger by the dispatch-boat.
WASHINGTON, July 26.â The news
of the landing of General Miles at
Guanica, on the southwest shore of
Porto Rico, came as a genuine surprise
to the War Department. It had all
been carefully planned that he was to
make his landing at another point, as
remote as possible from the place
where he actually landed, so there was
little wonder that the officials received
the first news of the landing with in
credulity, and even went to the length
of supposing that the story had been
put afloat in order to distract attention
from the point which had been selected.
Just why General Miles made this
wide departure from the plans of the
department is not known, but it is sup
posed that he had gathered some infor
mation since he left Siboney that in
duced him to make the change. The
result, however, has been to perplex
the department officials deeply and to
considerably derange their carefully
prepared programme for the remain
der of the expedition. It will now be
necessary to intercept the sections of
the expedition already at sea, heading
for certain selected points on the coast
of Po-to Rico and to advise them of the
change in the plans.
It Is another exhibition of the reli-
ance placed by the Government in the
dispatches of the Associated Press that
It proceeded to act at once in the direc
tion indicated and to take steps to noti
fy the sections afloat without waiting
for news from General Miles himself.
General Wilson's brigade is now ap
proaching the island, being due there
to-day or to-morrow, and reinforce
ments will follow at intervals of one
or two days until the whole force of
30,000 men is landed, unless events con
nected with the peace negotiations
make it expedient to stop future move
ments. However, it is a matter for
congratulation to the War Depart
ment that General Miles has managed
to set foot on Porto Rico before the
first overtures for peace, and thus
to place the island in the same posi
tion as Cuba and the Philippines,
namely, as territory at least partially
in the possession of the United States
at the beginning of the negotiations.

SHAFTER TELLS OF
THE SITUATION AT
SANTIAGO DE CUBA
Throws New Light on His Controversy
With Garcia, the Unreasonable
Cuban Leader.
Colonel Wood Installed as Military Governor==The
Health of Troops Improving Under Sani
tary Reforms.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 25 (via
Playa del Este, July 26).â Major Gen
eral William R. Shafter, commander of
the American forces in the campaign
against Santiago, to-day gave me for
the Herald an Interesting interview on
the situation here. General Shafter
throws much light on his controversy
with General Calixto Garcia, the Cu
ban leader, and now makes public for
the first time the fact that he and the
Cuban general had some correspond
ence about their differences prior to the
open break between them.
"You may tell the Herald," said Gen
eral Shafter when I called at the pal
ace in which he is now comfortably sit
uated, "that the situation in Santiago
la much improved. Twenty thousand
Spanish soldiers in the province of San
tiago have laid down their arms, leav
ing less than 5000 to be accounted for.
I hope all the Spanish army will have
been accounted for by the end of the
week, so that the work of loading
troops on the transports will be over as
soon as possible and the campaign in
the province be brought to a close.
"Colonel Wood has been installed as
military governor, with full power to
ict as circumstances may warrant. If
occasion should arise, it would be a
3lmple matter for him to suspend oper
ation of the existing civil government
and institute a military dictatorship,

HOBSON FULL
OF BUSINESS
Pays a Flying Visit to
Boston.
AFTER TWO HUGE PONTOONS
PLANS TO FLOAT THE COLON
AND TERESA.
Will Put the Wrecking Company to
Work, and Then if Occasion
Requires Will Rejoin the
Fleet.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
BOSTON, July 26.â Just before the
train left, Lieutenant Hobson said to
The Call correspondent: "I go to New
York and then directly back to the
fleet. I have found here two 200-ton j
pontoons belonging to the Boston Tow
boat Company. This fact I simply re
port to the department. You know !
my friends are al. talking for me, and i
what they haven't said it would be j
hard to say. I came to Boston solely i
on business, and my stay here was just
as brief as I could make it. Of course,
I would like to spend a little time in '
this interesting city, where I have been
received so kindly, but Government !
business necessitates expeditious work j
here and a quick return to Washing- i
ton.
"I went to the office of the Boston
Towboat Company and consulted them
in regard to obtaining two large pon
toons which it is proposed to use in
connection with the raising of the
Colon and Maria Teresa. These pon
toons have a lifting capacity of about
800^ tons each and I expect to get th^m
without any trouble and start for San
tiago in a couple of days.
"Our plan is to run the pontoons,
which have great buoyant power,
alongside at low tide and sink them.
They will then be fastened to the ship
by chains and pumped out at high
water. When the vessel .Â«hall have
been lifted off the bottom, the pontoons
will be filled again and the same pro
cess repeated Thus she may be
brought far enough out of water to en
able uj to close the opening in her hull,
pump her out and tow her to this
country.
"The Colon at last accounts lay on a
elope, with only a small part of her
bow above water. It will be a matter
of lifting 7000 tons to get her off.
Structurally, she is all right and was
foundered by the removal of her sea
cocks and Kinkston valves. She is ly
ing on a reef with her bows wedged in
between two coral reefs, and I feel cer
tain we caji save her. Of the Maria
Teresa, I have hopes that she caii
saved as well a.s the Colon.
"An to my future plans, I really do

culty will be met. The people of Santi
ago are quiet add orderly and they
i seem delighted that the campaign is
' over. They have been cooped up so
| long that whatever regret they may
feel is overbalanced by the compensa
tion' tion of peace. In the country many of
the Spanish troops have gone to work,
while here in Santiago, as you can see
1 for yourself, business has been resum
ed. Food is coming in more liberally
and in another week there should be
plenty for all. The health of the city
, is much better than I had anticipated,
i yet there is a great deal of sickness
and constant care will be required to
i prevent the spread of disease in the
; army. Our troops have withstood the
! great ravages of fever and the great
discomforts of the heavy rains. They
: are remarkably well. The sanitary re
' forms which are now being instituted
I will, I think, improve the health of the
i community in general.
"As to the political situation, I have
| little to add to what already is known.
j I regret that General Garcia should
| feel offended because he was not per
| mitted to be a signatory party to the
i Spanish surrender. In a letter to him,
written in reply to his protests, I made
' it plain that the ceremony of surrender
j and retention of Spanish municipal of
i fleers and tariff duties must be treated
jas temporary measures, quite apart
1 from the final purpose of the United
States in Cuba. I told General Garcia
that we were at war with Spain; that
; we would be held responsible before
' the world for the treatment of the sur
rendered territory, and pending con
' elusion of the war the Cubans could not
1 reasonably expect the recognition
not know what they will be. I expect
to superintend the raising of the two '
Spanish warships. As soon as I get
through my business here to-day I shall
take the first train for New York and
thence proceed direct to Washington. I
suppose I will at once leave there for
I Santiago."
During the conversation with the
! newspaperman it was remarked by one
of them that he (Hobson) had a pretty
' lively time in getting through the dense
j crowd to his carriage.
The lieutenant smiled and said: "My j
old football practice stands by me these
times. There is nothing like a good ath
letic training; it fits a man for many
things.
"I announced my conviction to the
1 department, and the Government be
! came convinced that the Colon and the
'. Maria Teresa could be raised. They
! will become valuable additions to our
navy. Both ships are the best types of
j their class, and with Americans behind
the guns they would make a marvelous
showing.
"The wrecking company will push the
1 work as rapidly as they can. You must
! understand that it will be no easy mat
: ter. Pontoons cannot work in rough
I water, and the hurricane season is at
hand.
"Well, I shall go south in a few days,
but not on the wrecking boats nor on
the St. Paul. After my visit to Boston
my movements will be uncertain. When
I arrive at Santiago I shall stay by the
Colon for a while to get the wrecking
company at work, and then if there is
an opporunity for work with the fleet
i I shall apply to be put aboard."
PROFESSOR ANDRR/VS
ON EUROPEAN POLITICS
Predicts a Great War in the Near
Future Into Which This Coun
try Will Be Dragged.
MADISON, Wis., July 26.â E. Benja
min Andrews, recently elected Super
intendent of Schools of Chicago, in his
address before the Winoma Lake As
sembly, spoke on "European Politics."
He predicted a great European war in
the near future, into which the United
! States would be dragged, If it did not I
go in of its own accord. He described
the strengthening of the fortifications
and preparations for war in every
country in Europe.
"You may ask what force in Europe
j preserves peace in Europe," he said.
"This peace force is the money power,
: the great financiers, whose interests |
; are entirely opposed to war. There are
i large numbers of people, intelligent,
thoughtful people, who believe that a
general war would kill off enough of
the laboring population to temporarily
! solve the labor question. Those who
were left could be paid larger wages
and live on a higher plane.
"It is interesting to consider which
' nation of Europe would benefit most
:by a general European war. That na
j tion undoubtedly would be Great Brit
â  am. She has the navy, the men and
the money. England is far better sit
uated in a financial way for war than
any other Europea,. ,x>wer.
"England's present friendliness to
ward the United States I believe to be
sincere and not expressed for the pun
pose of making capital out of us. We
should respond to the sentiment. Be
| sides the ues of blood, we would be
| wise to have a powerful ally in case
of friction wi..Â» any other European
power.
"We shall probably be compelled to
take a place in the settlement of the
Eastern question. There are many peo
ple who insist that we shall keep up
the role of the 'Hermit Nation'; that we
must keep aloof from the world. In
my judgment there is no choice before
the American nation. Whether we
wish to or not, we must take our place
among the powers of the world.
"The United States may be dragged
into the company of the powers by the
heels, or we may take our place volun
tarily, and call to the world: 'Here is
Jonathan. He is six feet two; he has
come to stay; he waits to be counted;
you must reckon with him.' "

which he sought. At the proper time,
I added, the terms of the President's
proclamation undoubtedly would be
made good. The letter was personal
and very friendly in tone, but General
Garcia made no reply to it. The next
news I heard of him was that he had
withdrawn with his army to Holguin,
near the north coast.
"The fact is I did recognize General
Garcia as far as I could by inviting
him to be present at the surrender of
Santiago as my guest. He declined to
come, sending this message: 'I cannot
be your guest under the Spanish flag.'
"I have the most kindly feeling for
General Garcia and sincerely regret
that he has cause for complaint. It is
idle, however, to argue the point, for
no matter how warmly one may sym
pathize with the Cubans, the proposi
tion to install them in power Imme
diately after the surrender of the Span
ish is untenable and lacks support
among the Cubans themselves."
The palace in which General Shafter
is nuartered is a large and roomy though
somewhat antiquated building, facing
the plaza. General Shafter to-day in
spected the city on horseback, being
accompanied only by two members of
his staff. He was well received along
the route, but there were no cheers.
General Shafter is a strict disciplina
rian, and he is rapidly bringing several
branches of the army into one cohe
sive body, capable of coping with any
situation that may arise. The commis
sariat is much improved.
A railroad will be opened to-morrow
and troops removed to Woodland.
Transports are unloading as rapidly as
possible and are awaiting orders from
Washington.
FLEET NEEDS
OVERHAULING
Why Watson's Cruise Is
Delayed.
VIEWS OF NAVAL OFFICERS
THOROUGH PREPARATION IS
NECESSARY.
Besult of Investigation of Effects of
the Naval Bombardment at
Santiago Told in a
Bulletin.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
GUANTANAMO BAY. Santiago,
July 26.â The Vixen and the Suwanee
returned to Santiago yesterday morn
ing convoying the prize ships brought
here for disinfection. The main body
of the fleet is here coaling and clean
ing as well as the facilities Z the bay
permit. The Texas will leave for New
York shortly, In order to undergo re
pairs.
The movements of the other ships un
der Rear Admiral Sampson's command,
except those engaged in the 1 orto Rico
expedition, depend upon the decisions
of the authorities at Washington, and
the impression Is growing among the
naval officers of high rank in these
waters that it is not advisable to send
a fleet to Spain without previously en
abling the ships t< under~o thorough
preparation, including going into dry
do^k in several cases.
The list of vessels in Guantanamo
Bay Includes the New York, Brooklyn,
lowa, Indiana, Oregon, Marblehead,
Detroit, Newark, Yankee, Yankton,
Hornet, Ericsson, Rogers, Wampatuck,
Samoset, Vesuvius', Celtic, Vulcan, Al
varado, five colliers and one transport.
A bulletin just issued in regard to the
investigation of the navy's bombard
ment of Santiago de Cuba says:
"Twelve houses were completely
wrecked inside and one house was
burned. Sixteen eight-inch shells struck
, within three blocks on the Calle de
' Marien. These excavated the ground to
a depth of about four feet and about
ten feet lengthwise. The street was
macadamized. It is judged from the
fact that many of them struck near the
water's edge that a number of shells
must have gone into the bay. Army
officers have stated that thirty or forty
went beyond the northern edge of the
bay into the Spanish lines.
"A dozen or more of the shells had
not exploded. In four of them the base
had been simply blown out. In one
â  case a four-inch shell which was prob
ably a 'stray' fired during the demon
stration at Aguadnres on July 1, had
gone through a tree and exploded in
the ground beyond.
"When the severe effect of the eight
inch shells is considered, it is a matter
j of congratulation that it was not neces
sary to continue the bombardment
longer and fire thirteen-inch shells, as
the squadron had prepared to do. The
I effect of these latter would undoubtedly
have been of a most disastrous charac
ter to the town.
"The board has completed Its Investi
gation and will make a detailed report
later."

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 26.â
General Shafter and Senor Ros, Civil

been lifted, I am able to give the full
details of this latest phase of the situ
ation here. In fact, this is the first
unscored dispatch to be sent from
Santiago.
Senor Ros, with the idea of trimming
his sails to suit Cubans, who, he be
lieves, will eventually possess the city,
had been making wholesale removals
of Spanish officials and replacing them
with Cubans of the extreme type. He
had been carrying on these proceedings
without the knowledge of General Shat
ter. His policy was at variance with
that of the commander of the Ameri
can forces, who desires to preserve or
der in the city while he gradually insti
tutes a new government.
Three members of the Institute of
Justice â Senors Barraco, Vila and
Riestra â called upon General Shafter
yesterday afternoon and said that in
view of President McKlnley's guaran
tee that the rights of the Spanish resi
dents were to be protected they wished
to protest against the high-handed
manner in which the Civil Governor
had removed Spaniards from office.
They informed General Shafter that
Senor Ros had sent communications to
the Spanish officials whom he had dis
missed, telling them that they had been
removed upon the order of General
Shafter. General Shafter immediately
summoned the Governor before him.
"Is it true," demanded General Shaf
ter, "that you have dismissed these of
ficials in my name?"
"Yes," replied Senor Ros, "they are
Spaniards, and I understood that all
such were to be removed."
"Your action, sir," said General Shaf
ter, "was totally unauthorized. You've
no right whatever to use my name. In
any case, you should not have taken
such a step on your own responsibility.
very strong effect upon President Mc-
Kinley. The authorities were totally
unaware, before this appeal was made,
of existing conditions. It heretofore
has been impossible to send supplies
into such large cities as Cienfuegos, but
President McKinley.in case peace prop
ositions do not prevail, will now direct
that Cienfuegos be captured as soon
as possible after the fall of San Juan.
President McKinley, I understood,
this morning laid the proposition of
capturing Cienfuegos before the Secre
taries or the Navy and War. They
were asked to carefully consider the
advisability of taking the place.
Of course, no move will be made
against Cienfuegos or any other port
on the Cuban coast until after the sur
render of San Juan. The officials with
whom I have talked are of the opinion
that the navy would have little dif
ficulty in forcing the authorities of
Cienfuegos to surender. The great dif
ficulty would be the occupation of the
city after its capture. It would not be
wise to send any troops not immunes
to Cienfuogos until after the rainy sea
son has ended in Cuba.
The proposition, as it now stands, is
to have the American navy force the
surrender of Cienfuegos as soon as pos
sible after the Porto Rican campaign.
Food and other supplies could then be
sent to Cienfuegos and distributed
among the suffering people now in that
city. It would not require a very
large body of troops to garrison that
city, and in all probability the Govern
ment would order two of the immune
regiments for such service.

Senor Ros returned shortly afterward
with the resignations of the high court
justice, consisting of the president, four
magistrates, three attorney generals
and two secretaries. The officials said
that as loyal subjects of the King of
Spain they could not perform their
functions under the authority of an
enemy of Spain and could not take an
oath acknowledging the supremacy of
the United States.
General Shatter was exceedingly in
dignant when he saw the resignations
were directed to the civil governor
through whom the court usually trans
acts its business. General Shatter
strongly objected to such course and
said the resignations should be made to
him direct, as Senor Ros had nothing
whatever to do with the matter. The
court is closed until new appointments
are made.
Senor Ros says he will resign to
day. His dismissal of the Spanish offi
cials had caused the Cubans to feel
considerable elation. Since the offi
cials have been reinstated the Cubans
seem ripe for anything. A meeting was
held last night at the San Carlos Club
when it was resolved to send a com
munication to President McKinley pro
testing against the action of General
Shafter.
Although General Garcia has with
drawn into the interior, a few of the
insurgents still linger near the city.
General Demetrius Tillo, with Brebece
and two hundred Cubans, is Just out
side the city walls, awaiting the action
of the American administration when
Spanis^ prisoners are deported. Gen
eral Castillo was appointed military
governor of Santiago by General Gar
cia, and declares he has the right to
enter the city. Dr. Joaquin Castillo,
brother of the general, who is in the
city, said to me the Cubans were much
disappointed and disgusted at the ac
tion of General Shafter prohibiting Cu
ban troops from entering the city.
"We have," he said, "carried on this
war fnr three years. We have borne
the toils and hardships and brunt of
the fight. Now that it is partly won we
are treated worse than the Spaniards,
our common enemy. We see Spaniards
parading the streets clad in the uni
form of Spain and filling lucrative po
sitions, while our troops suffer hard
ships and privations in the interior. We
see men bitterly opposed both to Cu
bans and Americans still retaining
posts of honor under the pretense of
preventing a cessation of the machin
ery of the civil government."

Warring on Liquor Traffic.
SAN RAFAEL, July 26.â The war in
Mill Valley over the sale of liquor has
begun and bids fair to develop into a
bitter contest at law. The Tamalpais
Land and Water Company brought four
separate suits yesterday, two against
John H. Mclnnes, Eliza Mclnnes, Andrew
H. Mclnnes and W. A. Sutcllffe; one
against Joseph and Dora Landgraff, and
one against Jesse E. Bundy, Lottie Bundy
and Henry Mason. It is stated in the
complaints that the contract of sale of
the lands to these persons provided that
no liquor was to be sold on the premises
until May 31, 1915, and it is alleged that
this clause has been violated in an
"open and notorious manner."

SANTIAGO PRISONS
RIVAL THE BASTILE.
Special Cable to < . Cabana t^NewJorkHerald. Copyrighted, 1898, by
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July Conditions in the Bastile are
equaled by the state of affairs in the prisons here, as revealed by the
prison commission which was appointed by the commander of the
American forces. The commission consists of Captain Lunan of the
Rough Riders, Major Groesbeck (judge advocate) and Mr. Annas,
formerly a lawyer of this city and now an aid on the staff of General
Castillo.
The commission began its Investigation with the common jail, where
it found a horrible state of affairs. It ascertained that many of
the prisoners had been confined there for years without ever having
been sentenced. Others were serving terms double and treble the ex
treme legal penalty for offenses of which they had been convicted.
One man had been confined six years for a crime the maximum pun
ishment for which under the Spanish law was two months. Among
the prisoners were many Spanish soldiers, who will be sent back to
Spain.
The commission was able to examine only ten prisoners yesterday.
Some of these will be liberated soon. The commission will be in session
to-day.
Sixty thousand dollars was deposited in the branch. Banca Espana
Habanawhen the city surrendered. It has disappeared. General Shafter
had Jose Bravo, governor of the bank, before him yesterday after
noon, and vainly endeavored to elicit from him the secret of the dispo
sition of the funds.

My mother's headaches were of the sort that people call sick
headache. They always were in some way the result of a disturbed
stomach. She would have them sometimes more than once a week,
and then she might go several weeks without having one. Generally
an attack would only spoil one day, but sometimes she would be sick
for two or three days. When she learned about Ripans Tabules, she
found that they always relieved her decMedly, and her attacks are
now much less frequent than they used to be. She continues to make
use of the Tabules when occasion arises, but she says that now one or
two will not produce the effect they did in the beginning. She keeps
a supply of them in the house all the time, and I believe if she worild
take them according to directions, they would cure her entirely. You
know her life is that of a farmer's wife. I suppose her experience is
that of thousands of others who stay pretty closely at home and de-
pend for food mainly upon those things which the farm produces.
Under such conditions the stomach will get upset now and then unlesi
precautions are taken to avoid it. Ripans Tabules are precaution*.

While trje State Lunacy Comn)ission Is

SAN JOSE. July When It was
redicted in The Call In reference to
he Agmews investigation that there
:ould N 1 applied as artistic a coating
f whitewash as ever was laid on by
n investigating body, a mistake was
lade. The application was not artiÃ
c. It was made to-day. The coatings
ere thick and plentiful, but through
hem all the impartial observer was
asily able to discern the big black
lntches.
There was ample evidence of the
andiwork of Director Frank H. Gould,
II showed that his recent retire
nent to the seclusion of the asylum
vas not for the purpose of obtaining 1
pst or recreation. His well-drilled wlt-
K'Spps did credit to his tuition.
Not less creditable to the coaching
ibilities of the would-be Moses of the
-ratic party of California was the
exhibition of railroading and gag rul
ngs given by Chairman James R. Cur
aow of the Agnews board of managers.
)â¢â¢â  racked through" his master's bid
3ing in a manner that must have
aroused thf> envy of Gould himself, who
nas no mean abilities in that line. Di
rector 0. A. Hale took the programme
ike a well-seasoned veteran takes or
ders from his superior.
There were two investigations In
progress under the same roof at the
=ame tim-\ in the language of the clr
â us showman, -ut they were not under
>ne management. While the State com
niFsion in lunacy was sitting in execu
:ive session in one room to determine
a-hat line of action should be taken in
Agnews Attaches Who Figure Prominently in the Asylum Scandal.
nvestigatinK the Agnews State Hospi
&}, the local board of managers in dis
regard and in virtual defiance of the
mperlor body entered upon Its farci
:al performance.
Governor Budd, who was present at
he session of the State commission, de
â¢.lared that the action of the local board
it this time was ultra vires, and would
jot in any way influence the proposed
:ourse of the commission. If the latter
'ound there was ground for an In
vestigation of the charges made by
?harles L. Williams against T. T.
fourtillott and Mrs. Madigan, such in
rf-stigation would be ordered and
night be undertaken by the commls
lion.
But Gould and his programmers have
i substantial advantage now. The tes
timony of witnesses examined to-day
will be transcribed and each witness
a-ill have ample opportunity to again
ttudy and prepare for his and her part
n th^ next performance.
Williams, who preferred the charges,
i-as not notified until 6 o'clock last
evening that the Investigation was to
>c held to-day and thus had little or
10 time to secure the attendance of his
vitnesses.
After the State Commission had an
lounred its intention of making a pre
lmlnary examination in executive ses
lion before deciding on n course of ae
ion all idea of making an Independent
nvestlgation was seemingly abandoned
>y the local board. It was only late in
he afternoon, when bodies of this kind
iÃually adjourn, that it decided to hold
in investigation of Williams" charges.
This was after it discovered that Wil
lams' attorney had taken his departure
n the confident belief that nothing
vould .be done by the local board to
lay. Williams essayed to conduct his
Bide of the rase, but was sadly handi
capped by his Inexperience, by the bull
dozing: tactics of Gould and by the gag
rulings of Curnow. So shamefully har
assed was ho thiit he left the room in
disgust before the session was over, and
after his departure an attempt was
made to besmirch the reputation of his
wife through the testimony of Miss
Louise Bambauer. one (if Gould's pets,
imported from Merced. This action
Btood out in darker colors by reason of
the fact that all of the previous wit
nesses had testified to the extremely
good character and reputation of Mrs.
Williams.
The full membership of the State Com-
mission In Lunacy was present when
the session was called to order by Gov
ernor Budd In Agnews Asylum at 10
O'clock this morning. The board con
sists of Governor Budd, Secretary of
State L. H. Brown, Attorney General
W. F. Fitzgerald, Dr. F. W. Hatch
and Dr. W. I\ Matthews. Governor
Budd was still suffering from a severe
cold, but owing to the importance of
the affair under consideration he made
special exertion to be present. As
stated by the Governor, the purpose of
the meeting was to examine all mem
bers of the local board and officers of
the institution in order to determine
upon the course of action In reference
to the Investigation or Investigations
and to decide by which body BUCh in
vestigation or investigations should be
made. Matters that affect the general
management of the institution are to
be investigated by the State Commis
sion, and those that merely relate to
the disciplining of individual attaches
and employes will be turned over to the
local board for action.
On being asked In whnt category the
charges against Tourtlllott and Mrs.
Madtgan would be placed, the Governor
said that could not at this time be de
termined. If it were shown that there
was reason to believe that the Tour
tillott-Madigan charges had a demoral
izing effect on the institution the?
would be made Â«. subject for the State
Commission to act upon.
Director TTpham was the first witness
before the commission, as he had made
the request for the intervention of the
commission. His examination covered
all charges and counter-charges that
had been published In the newspapers
within the past two weeks and also
matters that had been made subjects of
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 27, 1898.
Investigation or dispute before the
board.
Director White was second on the
carpet. He was examined on the same
matters that had been called to the at
tention of the preceding witness, but
entered larpely into the manner in
which patronage of the institution had
been obtained by members of the local
| board. ' Among other things, he said
| that Miss Ella Royse, who, after hay
! ing resigned as matron of the institu
tion, had, in a fit of pique, destroyed
some books that she kept, was ready to
I make all reparation in her power. She
I was ready to furnish whatever infor-
I mation she had concerning the entries
in these books. The Gould faction of
\ the local board has been holding the
destruction of the books over Miss
I Royse' s head, it is claimed, to prevent
her telling what she knows of the Tour
itillott-Madigan affair and other alleged
irregularities in the asylum.
Director Gould followed. His test I -
I mony was largely contradictory of that
j given by Mr. White, and it made clear
that there was serious friction in the
[< .al board between the witness and
\Yhit-\ It is not improbable that un
d-r th^se circumstances Gould may be
'â  Inspired to again tender his resignation
! as a member of the Agnews board, and
thus restore harmony in that body.
Should he be moved to such a course
'< it is not likely that the Governor will
irrasa him by again refusing to
The State Commission finished its
day's labors at 5 o'clock, before Gould's
examination had been completed. It
adjourned until 10 o'clock Thursday
I morning.
About an hour and a half before the
State Commission adjourned the local
board got the notion of holding a meet-
Ing of its own. A room was quickly
j selected and in a few minutes a troop
of witnesses, mostly employes of the
i asylum, was in attendance. Prominent
among them were T. T. Tourtillott and
Mrs. Madigan, the two accused of un
becoming conduct by Charles L. Wil
liams. There were present also Dr.
Sponogle and Miss Louise Bambauer,
acting matron by grace of Dr. Spo
nogle and the will of Director Gould.
Dr. Cnrnow occupied the chair. Di
rector White was before the State
Commission and Directors Upham,
Hale and Gould began the investiga
tion.
Mr?. Madigan came in pale, self-con
scious and exceedingly nervous. It
w.-i.s some time before she ceased biting
her lips and twitching them in a vain
effort to appear unmoved. Tourtlllott
bore the ordeal with somewhat less
embarrassment.
Chairman Curnow announced the |
purpose of the meeting to be the in- j
vestlgation of the charges filed by
Charles 1,. Williams against T. T. |
Tourtlllott and Mrs. Madiean. After j
the secretary rend them, as they have I
been published in The Call, Hale asked
for an expression from the board as to
whether Gould was to be considered
competent to sit In the case, his I
brother, Tourtlllott, being one of
the persona accused. It was fin
ally decided to allow Gould to partici
pate in the proceedings, but not to
v t. on any question or take part In
the final decision. Hale then moved
to proceed with the investigation, and
the motion was carried.
Mrs. Olivia B. Williams was the first
witness. She related her story in a
clear manner. The facts she pave were
the basis of the charges of Immoral
conduct made against Mrs. Kate Madi
gan and T. T. Tourtillott. She said
thai about the middle of last October.
somewhere near 5:30 o'clock in the
morning, when she opened the door
leading into ward F in the female part
of the hospital she heard the latch of
Mrs. Madigan's door click. A few
minutes later Mrs. Madigan came out,
looked around, and again retired to her i
room. The witness walked to the end
of the corridor and then down the
stairway, at the foot of which she |
waited. A few minutes later she saw i
Tourtillott coming toward her and she j
met him face to face. He passed with- |
out speaking to her. Mrs. Williams re- i
ported the matter to Dr. Christal. A i
few days later and about the same j
time wrote to Gould and told him of
Tourtillott's actions In the women's
ward, and asked him to speak to his j
brother. The witness also related th<Â» :
circumstance to her husband and
Nighlwatehman Kerns.
Dr. Christal reported the matter to
Dr. Sponogle and the medical director
summoned Mrs. Williams to his office
and questioned her about It. He cau
tioned her that unless she told the
truth she could not stay In the lnstitu
tion two minutes. Shortly afterward j
Mrs. Williams saw Gould at the asy
lum. Gould called her into the office
and asked her why she told Dr. Chris
tal of the affair when she had written j
to him (Gould). He said he did not
believe her statement, and made
threats that If she did not keep quiet
h^ would give her a long vacation.
Gould tried to shake Mrs. Williams'
testimony by a number of questions
and asked if he hnd not said that Dr.
Sponogle and he had arrived at the
conclusion lhat there was no truth In
the statement. At this time Gould was
called before the State Lunacy Com
mission and White took his place in
the board.
Mrs. Williams explained the position
of Tourtillott, Mrs. Madigan and her
self on the morning in question. She
had told Dr. Christal of Tourtillott be
ing in the female ward because Dr.
Christal waa In charge of thnt ward.
Hale then took a hand in the ques
tioning. He asked when Mrs. Williams
was married nnd wanted to see hÂ»r !
marriatre certiliente; also who per- i
formed the ceremony and whether she j
had seen the marriage license. Will- j
iama answered this question for his i
wife. He said they were married in j
San Francisco on September 8, 1897, by
a Justice of the Peace. The license was
procured from "Cupid" Danforth, and
was a matter of record in San Fran
cisco County.
Mrs. Williams said the lights were
out in the corridor at the time she dis
cerned Tourtillott and Mrs. Madigan.
Hale doubted whether it was light
enough to see distinctly at f>:3o o'clock
in the morning in the middle of Octo
ber. The calendar was consulted and !
it showed that on October 1R the sun
rose at 6:18 o'clock.
About two months after her mar
riage Mrs. Williams informed Dr.
Christal and Dr. Sponogle of the fact.
She said they had gone up to San Fran
cisco on her day off, got married and
returned the next day.
At this point Williams, who was art-
Ing a.s counsel for his wife, attempted
to question her, but Hale gagged him.
He held that during the absence of
Gould, who represented Tourtillott,
Williams had no right to question the
witness. White said Williams had as
much right as Gould to question the
witness, as he was her husband and
counsel. Williams was not granted the
privilege.
Mrs. Williams further stated that one
night Mrs. Madigan's light was burning
at 12 o'clock, and Night "Watchman
Kerns told Miss Fogarty to turn out
the light. At 5 o'clock the next morn-
ing Mrs. Madlgan returned to her
room. She often went to her room at
that hour. About the month of Janu
ary Mrs. Madigan confided to Mrs. Wil
liams that she and Tourtlllott were
married. This was in explanation of
their conduct, and Mrs. Madigan asked
Mrs. Williams not to mention it to any
one.
Mrs. Z. B. White had been employed
at the asylum for two years. She had
never seen Tourtillott in the woman's
ward near Mrs. Madigan's room. When
Mrs. Williams was discharged she told
the witness that her knowledge of the
acts of Mrs. Madigan and Tourtillott
had been the cause of her dismissal.
The witness never saw anything about
Mrs. Madigan or Tourtillott that was
improper. She stated positively that
j she knew nothing of the matter. She
had no recollection of having remarked
to Mrs. Williams that the Madigan-
Tourtillott scandal was common talk
about the building. Miss Rose Ryan,
an attendant, knew nothing of the af
fair before the board. She denied
ever having been sent by Miss Royse
to Tourtillotfs rocim to tell Mrs. Madi
gan to go to her own room.
Miss Rose Ryan further testi
fied that she knew nothing about either
Tourtillott or Mrs. Madigan that was
not to their credit.
Dr. Sponogle testified that his recol
lection of the story Mrs. Williams told
him In October did not agree with that
told to the board. She had told him
that she thought it was Mr. Tourtillott
whom she had seen, but was not posi
tive.
"I also asked her," continued the wit
ness, "if she had seen him at any other
time at the came place, and she ans
wered that she had not."
To a question of Director Upham the
witness replied that he had not heard
of a report from any other person, and
added that the accused always had the
reputation of being a lady and a gen
tleman, respectively, in every regard.
In response to Director Hale, Dr.
Sponogle said that after he had been
told of the affair by Mrs. Williams, Mr.
Hale had given him instructions to
have the nlghtwatches keep a sharp
lookout for a repetition of the occur
rence. He had done so. but nothing
further had been reported to him. He
had then investigated the matter close
ly, but had been unable to obtain any
evidence from any other source.
Director Hale corroborated the latter
part of Dr. Sponogle's testimony. Un
der cross-examination by Mr. Williams,
who was allowed to appear as a cour
tesy, Dr. Sponogle stated he did not
remember that Mrs. Williams had told
him she had informed Nightwatchman
Kerns of the early morning meeting
with Tourtillott.
"Did she ever tell you," continued
Williams, "that she had seen Mr. Tour
tillott and Mrs. Madigan together in
the laundry? I think before we get
through we will be able to show that
this is a fact."
The witness replied in the negative.
"Didn't she say that she did not want
it to go any further, as she did not
want to make any trouble for Mr.
Gould, who was a friend of hers?"
asked Williams.
To this Dr. Sponogle made an evasive
reply, which caused Williams to re
mark:
"It seems that this Institution has
been terrified to such an extent that
every one lias to guard his tongue, nnd
the truth is not so important to them
as their bread and butter."
Dr. Sponogle further testified that he
had reported the matter to the chair
man of the Management Committee,
Mr. Could, but had not reported it to
any other member of the board.
Williams wn.s frequently interrupted
In his cross-examination by Gould's
and Hale's objections, which were in
variably sustained by Chairman Cur
now, notwithstanding that whenever
Williams offered any objections to mat
ter clearly irrevelant he was overruled
by the Chairman. Gould brought out
the opinion from Dr. Sponogle that the
work of Tourtillott had always been
satisfactory and that his conduct had
been the same. Witness had never
heard the moral character of Tourtil
lott questioned before this accusation
was made and he added that he did not
believe the statement made by Mrs.
Williams.
"State to the board," requested Mr.
Gould, "what the mental condition of
Mrs. Williams was during the latter
months of her employment here."
This brought an objection from Wil
liams, who informed the board that he
had recommendations from the offi
cials of the institution as to her com
petency, moral character, intelligence
and truthfulness. He was not allowed
to offer them in evidence, though
Chairman Curnow admitted he had
given Mrs. Williams such recommenda
tion. Williams added that if his wife's
sanity was in question at any time dur
ing her employment it was clearly the
duty of the board to have discharged
her.
At this point Gould gave the cue to |
the chairman to apply the gag to Wil- j
Hams, and it was duly and promptly
done. Dr. Sponogle continued:
"I think she acted peculiarly at times.
I think she passed eight months or a
little longer in this way. She im
agined she had become a great news
paper writer, and at other times she
thought she had become quite a singer.
She also tried to become a great pen
man, and instead of retiring in
the morning when her duties were
over she would practice penmanship.
From observing these peculiarities I
thought it was undesirable ior her to
remain in this institution. I did not
think that with her family history she
would be benefited in this institution.
Her mother had died in an asylum, but
of her father I know nothing."
This was all brought out by the
questioning of Gould.
Williams asked the witness If he had
not promised to give Mrs. Williams a
recommendation, and if he had not
stated that* she was conpetent. faith
ful and truthful. Dr. Sponogle made
no answer.
F. P. Kerns, the ni^ht watchman,
testified that he had never seen any
thing blameworthy in the conduct of
either Mr. Tourtillott or Mrs. Madlgan.
Dr. J. F. Christal testified that Mrs.
Williams had told him of the Tour
tillott-Mr.d'^an 1Â» Ident two Âays after
it had occurred, and that he had re
ported it to Dr. Sponogle.
Tourtillott and Mrs. Madigan were
called to the stand and made general
denials of all the charges.
Mrs. E. Templeton, Mrs. Watkins. H.
A. Braden and Miss Julia Creighton,
all employes of 'he asylum, testified to
the good character and reputation of i
the accused, and also that of Mrs.
Williams. They knew nothing of the
alleged misdoings of the accused.
Detective Erwln Frost said Williams
had come to him to get his services in |
the case. Williams wanted to force the [
managers to reinstate his wife, so that :
he could go East and study law. Frost i
said Williams put him on the track of !
certain things against Dr. Sponogle,
which, if true, ought to cause the doc
tor to leave the State. Williams had no
money to pay the witness and agreed
to liquidate the Indebtedness as soon
as Mrs. Williams got at work again.
It was during Frost's examination
that Williams and his wife left the
room and departed for home.
Chairman Curnow declared the case
closed, and intimated that he desired
the board to go at once into executive
session to decide the matter, though
Williams had asked previously for the
opportunity to produce additional wit
nesses whom he had not been able to
reach, owing to the extremely short
time he had been given to notify them.
Gould pleaded to have another witness
examined, and his wish was not rain
said.
F. A. McDonald, an employe, was
called He stated that Mrs. Williams
had told him that she was sorr- that
she had gone into the matter, but that
she had been urged to do so by her hus
band.
Last of all, when nearly every one
had left the room, came the attack on
Mrs. Williams' reputation. It was made
by Miss Louise Bambauer. She stated
that Mrs. Williams had confided to her
that she was infatuated with Mr. Tour
tillott and that she had desired the
witness to bring about a meeting be
tween herself and Tourtillott. She
added that she thought Mrs. Williams
had brought about this "disturbance"
in the hope that Mrs. Madigan would
be sent away and "she would then have
absolute control." Miss Bambauer con
cluded her testimony and the farce of
bearing witness to the good character
of the accused.
Gould moved for an executive ses
sion, but his motion received no second.
On motion of Hale, an adjournment
was taken until Thursday morning at
10 o'clock.

sented figures by which to show that the
road had been unequally assessed and
that it in proportion paid more than other
classes of property. The road last year
paid the State and counties $36,500 for

WHERE MILES LANDED.
ZZJ VER since the beginning of the war The Call
has made an intelligent study of the situation.
* It has not only printed accurate news from the
front, but has endeavored with more than gratifying
success to foreshadow the outcome of army move
ments as indicated by the logic of events. Thus it
announced where, in its belief, General Miles would
land in Porto Rico, and had enough confidence in
its judgment to publish a picture of the place. The
picture was also accurate.
Circumstances sustained the conjecture. General
Miles had not announced his plans in advance. The
War Department had guarded them carefully, and
yet an analysis of the situation made plain that there
was only one course for him to pursue. The Call
merely assumed that he would follow this course, in
stead of attempting another, which could but result
in failure. It is not the habit of this paper to venture
haphazard guesses.
RESPECT FOR THE FLfIG.
ALL over the city the national colors have been
flying for months. The flag floats above pub
lic buildings, from lofty staffs without number
and in front of many residences it has been unfurled.
All this is gratifying. It shows an American spirit
aroused to expression by the crisis through which
the country is passing. But there is still something
lacking.
Many of the flags put in place weeks ago have
received no attention. Buffeted and tugged at by
the breezes during the day; they have been left out
at night, exposed to the fogs and mists. As a re
sult they have been soiled, and in instances not only
whipped to tatters, but the remains do not present to
the eye the inspiriting red, white and blue. On the
contrary, the colors have merged to a draggled
combination hardly suggesting the flag. This strikes
the observer as neglect.
There is no particular reason why the flag should
fly after night. Let it be on view during the day.
Let it catch the glint of the morning sun and throw
its shadow eastward when the sunset gun booms
at the Presidio. Then it should be taken down. To
see it flaunting torn, bedraggled and forgotten is
worse than not seeing it. The impression created
is that enthusiasm has passed, and that the impulse
which caused the flag to be run up was momentary.
Common sentiment protects the flag against dese
cration. It is forbidden that one should deface it.
And in exposing it to the elements to be shredded,
stained, raveled, to become only a hint of what it
was when first displayed, is a form of desecration.
NOT ASKING PERMISSION.
AGAIN there comes the report that the powers
of Europe will not permit the United States
to keep the Philippines. So far as known, this
country has not asked their permission. It does not
care what they desire, and will go ahead on the lines
which seem wisest, regardless of Kaiser, Czar or any
other variety of potentate.
There is a strong party in this country opposed to
the taking of the Philippines. They object to it as a
matter of policy. They think it contrary to the
spirit of the constitution. But even these do not
weigh the opinions of the "powers." They think, in
deed, that in attending to affairs which concern them
selves the powers will be amply employed. In com
mon with the rest of America, they resent the im
pertinence of interference. Perhaps the United
States will not keep the Philippines. It may be the
conservative element will prove dominant, and that
the impulse toward territorial expansion will never
get further than a vague and unformed ambition.
But there is one way in which Europe can force
the United States to keep the islands, and this is to
emphasize the dictum that the United States must
give them up. We are not looking for trouble.
There is no chip on our shoulder. The nation prays
for honorable peace. But there is not in all Europe
a nation big enough, nor a combination big enough,
to tell us what we shall do. This is our fight, un
sought It is American blood that Is being spent;
American money pays the cost of campaign. We
want no advice, and we will not tolerate orders.
Naturally enough the Spanish hare Deen relat
ing some of the rules of surrender. If there are
any rules they do not know about they have only to
be told of them and they will with the same cheerful
celerity violate these also.
John Sherman should not submit to interviews, and
his friends ought to guard him against the tempta
tion. There was a time when his opinion was of
value.
Cubans are now afraid of American annexation,
but if they were not scared about this they would be
torn by fears of something else.
The war has developed the singular and pleasing
fact that every regiment is a crack organization.
THfIT WOODLAND FELLOW.
THE editor of the Woodland Mall, who volun
teered to serve his country in a military ca
pacity, with a string to his patriotism, has been
left unnoticed, until he should fill out the catalogue
of his deficiencies in decency and good character.
In a recent issue of his paper he seems to have
finished the list, and we pay him now final attention.
He publishes a telegram sent to him from Carson
City, Nevada, dated July 23, as follows:
"Sam Leake of The Call asked his Carson cor
respondent to find out the names of the four Wood
land men who refused to muster in."
The editor thereupon says: "This demonstrates
the malignant spirit of this man Leake and the Budd
organ he is running. He seems bent on persecut
ing the Woodland men who defied his boss, Jim
Budd."
Now let this fellow take a look at nimself in the
mirror of the facts. On July 22 it was wired from
Carson that "six members of Company A failed to
muster in to-day, having skipped out. All of them
came from California originally."
Anxious to save the credit of California by spot
ting these six skulkers, and by getting their names
to make the responsibility personal and lift it from
the State, The Call wired its correspondent at Carson
this dispatch, see files of Western Union office :
"Davis, Carson, Nevada: Send particulars failure
members Company A to muster in, giving names and
places they came from. CALL."
This was filed at 12:30 a. m., the 23d. It made no
mention of Woodland or any place, even of the
State, and by using the word "places" proved that
no one place was in mind. The answer published
In our issue of the 23d gave the names of the men,
said they were hoboes, picked off brakebeams at
Reno and Winnemucca, who enlisted to get a few
square meals, and giving their residence as California.
This relieved the State of responsibility for the va
garies of a lot of tramps, and the incident closed, un
til it was reopened by the editor of the Mail, who
persists in showing a fellow feeling for skulkers by
taking up their cause and abusing all who rebuke
them.
To go back to his grievance. He was an enlisted
man in the Woodland company. The Governor of
California, by virtue of his legal authority, appointed
the officers of the company. This was seized as a
pretext by the editorial warrior to escape from the
service with a whole skin, which he seems to value
more highly than he does his country. Industrious
cultivation of discontent gained recruits to his pur
pose, and many members of the company refused to
be sworn into the Federal service, and were after
ward mustered out of the State militia. The Gov
ernor is the commander-in-chief of the National
Guard. He acted within hii plain grant of author
ity, and whether his act was distasteful or not to the
men, their oath required their obedience to it. If
the commander-in-chief had withdrawn his action
at their dictation, discipline would have been at an
end. He did just what the President has been called
on to do nearly every day since war was declared.
Not every private in the ranks is expected to be
pleased with the brigade and division officers desig
nated by the President, but a soldier's first duty is
obedience and he has to accept the officers ap
pointed over him by the final authority. Perhaps
no appointment was ever more strongly opposed than
that of Brigadier General Harrison Gray Otis. The
most bitter criticism of it came from California. But
the President made it, and The Call, which had given
the opposition a chance to be heard in Its columns,
at once set the example of good citizenship by cheer
ful acquiescence in the act of the final authority. The
editor of the Woodland Mail, under similar circum
stances, showed that in his makeup there is not a
single fiber of good citizenship, nor in all his blood
a drop that is reddened by patriotism. It is evident
that he enlisted in a spirit of vainglory, for the tem
porary titillation of the flattery of his neighbors, and
retreated on the first opportunity to back out of a
promise he had not the courage to keep. With
him. no doubt, went several gallant men whose sense
of duty was for the moment obscured by the griev
ance he invented and propagated. They were placed
in a painful position they will long rrgret, and which
their friends will gladly forget, if this scribbling
coward, who had not the courage to swap his scissors
for a sword, will permit the incident to pass into ob
livion. But the incorrigible poltroon seems deter-
mined to glorify his skulk into a virtue, by lying
: about The Call. If he be a patriot, if his enlist
i ment were in good faith, he has had opportunity to
1 p r ove it by re -enlisting in any other company. But,
â  omitting this proof, the world is warranted in the
: conclusion that the army is stronger for his absence
from the ranks and that civil life is degraded by his
return to it. His neighbors will long remember
when Dungan, the dunghill, went briefly into busi
ness as a gamecock, but soon skulked back to scratch
and crow in the same old place.
INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY,
f~\ T the present time we have among the political
/ \ factions of the United States a Conservative
* Democracy, a Bryanite Democracy, a Fusion
Democracy, a Populist Democracy and a Social
Democracy, not counting the Coxey Democracy
which still lingers in Ohio to some extent. Now
we are to have another Democracy, if certain Los
Angeles men have their way, for in that city there
has been started a movement to form an "Industrial
Democracy."
Under normal conditions an organization calling
itself "industrial" would be devoted to the pursuits
of industry. If it did not undertake some vast work
like the Nicaragua canal it would at least help its
votaries to get a job at fruit picking. At all haz
ards it would keep out of politics, for nothing is so
destructive to genuine industry as the political habit.
It might, therefore, be supposed that the proposed
Industrial Democracy is to be an association to pro
mote the industries of the land on the Democratic
plan of making every man his own boss, but that
supposition would be erroneous.
We do not live under normal conditions, or at
least Democracy is no longer normal. Coxey's army,
it will be remembered, called itself an "industrial
army," though its campaign began and ended in a
tramp, and its force dispersed when ordered by a
policeman in Washington to keep off the grass.
Therefore it will surprise none to learn that the pro
posed Industrial Democracy of Los Angeles is to
be, when organized, a political faction, and cherishes
the hope of eventually becoming a political party
with a candidate for the Presidency and every local
office.
The platform of the organization is one of the
kind designed to sweep everything of a public na
ture, except the streets. It calls for the public
ownership of all monopolies, including land and
trusts. Now, imagine a government owning a trust
and trying to make it work industrially. Next it
calls for entire civil service reform and "the ap
pointment of all officials on their merits for the par
ticular office in which there is a vacancy." Direct
legislation, the initiative and the referendum, propor
tional representation and the imperative mandate fol
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 27, 1898,
low, as a matter of course. Every new party in
these days has to have those things, or it won't be
allowed to play.
Up to that point there is nothing in the platform
of principles that in the slightest degree refers to
work or industry. Just here, however, the framers
of the instrument seem to have had a second thought,
for in the typewritten copy of the circular sent to us
by the organizers there is at this point inserted with
pen and ink a fourth plank, demanding "immediate
employment of the unemployed upon public work."
For the rest the circular contents itself with an ap
peal to the people for support on the ground that
the time has come "for an honest declaratiop of is
sues that will deliver us from bondage to monopoly,
and from industrial and political practices that are
destroying the higher American life."
We have no desire to comment on the scheme as
a political movement. The more kinds of Democ
racy there are the merrier life is, and the less impor
tant is it to fight any of them, since they fight them
selves with such a Donnybrook gayety. But as an
industrial proposition we cannot forbear four words
of reproof t the thing won't work.
AN incontrovertible evidence of Judge Maguire's
political insincerity is furnished by his willing
ness to desert his post in Congress for a quest
of the Governorship of California. This he is bound
to do in the coming campaign, unless the Democrats
can discover some plan by which they can run him
for Governor and Congress at the same time. We
know of no instance in which this has been done, but
nothing is impossible to Democrats and Populists.
According to the Democratic leaders the great is
sue of the campaign will be the railroad funding
amendment, worked through Congress shortly be
fore adjournment by the Ã¼biquitous Huntington.
Now that that amendment is law we do not exactly
see how the Democrats are going to defeat it, but
this also may be one of the things which are not
impossible to the fusionists. To a rational man it
would seem that the only thing now to be done is
to await the action of the Funding Commission and
disagree with it
At all events, whatever the result, Judge Maguire
cannot, as Governor of California, defeat Hunting
ton. If, as his admirers fay, he is the bete noir
of the railroad magnate, his place is in Congress,
where he can occasionally meet and give the old
man a battle. Huntington visits this State once a
year, and then only for the purpose of looking over
his property. Unless Judge Maguire calls at the
yellow building during office hours and sends in his
card, he will never even see the millionaire, much
less be presented with an opportunity of meeting him
in forensic contest.
The truth of the matter Is, Judge Maguire, like
all demagogues, is ready at any moment to abandon
important work anywhere for a fat office. He has
no stomach for fighting Huntington-s Central Pa
cific funding schemes when there is a desirable office
In prospect. His predominant instinct is place
hunting, and no sacrifice of principle or neglect of
duty is too great to appall him. If Maguire were
a man of steadfast purpose, devoted to the mainte
nance of the principles upon which he has founded
all the reputation he possesses, he would stay in Con
gress and fight Huntington, Instead of seeking an
office in which his chief duty will consist of appoint
ing notaries and jobbing in patronage. His anxious
desire to make a change at this time is proof positive
that he knows no duty except the duty of at all
times getting, if possible, into the best office in
sight.
SPAIN'S DESIRE FOR PEACE.
\A ADRID dispatches announce that immense
/ \ importance is attached there to the recent
* * statement of Secretary Day favoring peace
on terms that would enable the Spanish Government
to avoid the necessity of continuing a war of despair.
Spain, it is said, is keenly eager to find an opportun
ity for opening peace negotiations, and will gladly
profit by the first that occurs. The recent repre
sentation made to the President by the French Min
ister confirms the report, and proves that Spain is
really eager for peace.
As a matter of fact, what Spain needs at this time
is some official who will tell her plainly it is time
to quit. It will be remembered that when the Maine
was blown up in Havana harbor, the â¢seaman on
watch, a certain Bill Anthony, as soon as the shock
was over, walked quietly up to the officer in charge
and with the formal naval salute said: "Excuse
me, sir; I have to report that the ship is blown up
and is sinking."
Doubtless the officer in charge was well aware of
the fact from personal observation, but it was grati
fying to him to have it announced in the regular
way, so that he could act upon it officially without
disarranging the etiquette of the navy. What Spain
lequires at this juncture is some straightforward Bill
Anthony, who will report in due form to the Queen
Regent and her Prime Minister that the nation is
blown up and is sinking. With such a report be
fore them, they would be able to deal wisely with
the situation without an infraction of the high re
quirements of Spanish honor and punctilio.
A proposition coming from our Government for
the opening of negotiations looking toward the re
storation of peace would be absurd. We have every
thing to gain by pushing the war vigorously, and
nothing to expect from an armistice. In all our
dealings with the Spanish Government in reference
to Cuban affairs, the Madrid officials showed them
selves past masters in the art of diplomatic evasion,
delay and tergiversation. They could give us cards
and spades and beat us at the game. It was not
until the ultimatum of war was given that we at
tained a superiority over them.
With that experience fresh In our minds we can
hardly be expected to agree to an armistice for fur^
ther negotiations. When Spain sues for peace in
the proper manner it will be forthcoming. In the
meantime the Spanish Government should take note
that the nation is sinking, and that if it desires to
save anything from the wreck it must act at once.
That Miss Schley should have been sent out of
Spain is altogether proper. She went there to see
the Queen Regent and discuss affairs of state. That
she was quietly requested to make herself scarce, in
stead of being conducted to the Lorder and ordered
to skip, is the first indication there has been of an
effort on the part of the Spanish to be polite.
Colorado is another State which resents the official
report that it was lax in offering the number of vol
unteers asked of it. As a matter of fact, the only
trouble with Colorado was that many more men of
fered their services than there was a place for.
It is to be hoped that Miles will waste no time
in splicing cables so as to talk with Washington.
The war in the West Indies has been marked by a
surplus of conversation.
Camara is to take refuge at Ceuta. It is fortunate
there is something a Spanish admiral can take.
MAGUIRE'S INSINCERITY.
THE CARPENTER MYSTERY-EXIT LOCHNER,
The second act of the little police comedy based upon the tragic murder
of Mrs. Sadie Carpenter was performed at the Coroner's Court yesterday,
and the result was, as everybody anticipated, the triumphant acQuittal of
Joseph Lochner. That is to say, Lochner was acquitted as far as it is pos
sible for a man who has never been charged with an offense. Though in
custody, he was legally free, yet practically, owing to the devious pol
methods of administration, he was on his trial before a Jury for the crime
of murder.
The man, who has endured his anomalous position with wonderful pa
tience, realized this himself. He actually took the trouble to address
Jury in his own defense, a proceeding which was entirely unnecessary,
considering the complete ruin into which the police case against hw
fallen. He pointed out, with logical clearness, that he had absolutely no
motive for committing such a crime; he had never even had a quarrel
with Mrs. Carpenter, but had always lived on the best of terms with hei
Further, if robbery had been his motive, where were the missing watch
and the money supposed to have been in the murdered woman's purse?
They were certainly not on his person when arrested, and he had had no
time to dispose of these incriminating articles.
The fact that the night clerk did not notice Loohner come home that
evening does not count for much, because night clerks in an establish
ment of this kind are frequently busy away from their offices. Indeed, the
evidence showed that this particular clerk used often to make up the beds
at night. Therefore, there is nothing to controvert Lochner's statement
that he came home late and went straight to bed. In support of It we have
evidence showing that at the time of the murder he was undressed. At
first the police claimed that Lochner could not have had time to dress be
tween his awakening by the night clerk and the arrival of the police. But,
on the other hand, we have the evidence of two men in the saloon opposite,
to whom Lochner announced the murder, wearing a nightgown, over which
hia clothes had been hastily thrown. It does not take an active man
long to throw on a pair of trousers and a coat, and we may reasonably as
sume that Lochner had ample time in which to hurriedly dress himself.
This clothing question deserves much more attention than the police
have placed upon it. Mrs. Riley, whooccupied the room next to Sadie Car
penter's, states positively that twenty minutes after the scuffle was over
she heard the door of the murdered woman's room slammed and footsteps
as of a person wearing creaking boots proceed down the passage. How far
the steps went she could not be sure, but as the hallway turns at a right
angle at the corner of Lochner's room, she could only have heard them for
a short distance, whether the man went Into that room or took his way
down the stairs.
Now, if this was Lochner, he must have been fully dressed, for It is ab
surd to Imagine a man putting on a pair of creaking boots and nothing else
in order to slip from one room to another, over a few yards of hallway.
But the point need not be discussed further. I have definitely settled the
fact that Lochner did not wear creaking boots on the night in question.
Boots that creak must be new and in good condition; hence the popular
saying that squeaking shoes have not been paid for.
Talking to Lochner in the courtroom yesterday, I asked him, casually,
â¢what kind of boots he wore that night. "The pair I have on now," he re
plied readily, "I have no others." I looked at the shoes. They were very
old and very shabby, and had but the merest pretense of worn-out soles.
Anything less likely to creak could hardly be imagined.
This settles the question. It was not Lochner who slammed the door and
creaked his way along the passage. If it was another man he must have
either made his way down the stairs, or else have concealed himself some
where in the house. In either case it was strange that the night clerk did
not see any one, for we are told by Mrs. Rlley that she found him in his
office shortly after the event. Could a man, carrying a large bundle, have
passed unobserved and made his way into the Btreet? Mrs. Anderson, the
mother of the murdered woman, made a very significant statement yester
day, though it did not appear In evidence. She asserts positively that most
of her daughter's best dresses are missing, aa well as her watch, and other
minor articles. But most Important of all, a very gorgeous silk bedspread
Is gone. Mrs. Anderson is absolutely sure her daughter would never have
parted with this elaborate lace trimmed article, because once she refused
an offer of forty dollars for it. All these things, if done up together, would
have made a very big parcel, a parcel so large that the improbability of
any one carrying it unobserved out of the house at such an hour in the
morning is very great.
This bedspread, conspicuous and easily recognizable, furnishes us with a
most valuable clew, and the man who finds it will have advanced far to
ward solving the mystery. If robbery was the only motive, he must have
been a daring thief who, after murdering a woman, ventured to carry such
a noticeable bundle away with him. If the things were not removed from
the house, they ought to have been found long ago. Had the police acted
promptly, and taken reasonable methods at the outset, much might have
been discovered ere this.
Of course It is easy to reason after the event, but that is no excuse for
blunders. Let us Imagine the course a skilled detective would have pur
sued if called on to follow up such a case. He would certainly have asso
ciated Lochner with the crime, but then he would have done it in a scienti
fic way. He would have treated the man purely as a witness, examined
him closely, but would never have allowed him to suppose for a moment
that he was suspected of complicity. Instead of shutting him up in prison
where he could furnish no possible clew, he would have left him at liberty'
under close and skillful espionage. In short, he would have given Lochner
plenty of rope, never letting him know that he was watched. If the man
had been guilty of the offense, he would have been sure, sooner or later to
betray himself; he would have been compelled to take some steps to disDose
of the stolen articles.
The loss of the clothing, and especially the bedspread, should have been
ascertair i long ago, and the whole house shoulu have been cloÂ«, P ly

diers' last tribute to the hero of the war.
The following- patriotic poem was read by Major Otey the well knnwr,
Confederate officer, at the high jinks of the Bohemian Club eighteen 1
ago. Aside from its loyal ring, it is interesting by reason of its D lh!
which is fulfilled in these war times. tS *> ro P h ecy.
Along the Rappahannock two mighty armies lay;
One displayed the loyal blue, the other wore the gray
Yet the sentries hailed each other, when the autumn day was donÂ«
Then brother asked for brother, and father asked for son
For in that mighty struggle that reft our native land
How many brave hearts perished beneath a kindred hand!
How many loving mothers at night knelt down to pray
That God would watch their boys In blue, and save the ones In gray!
And here beside the river, with its peaceful flowing tide.
The sons of a loving mother were camped on either side.
Who spoke of home and kindred across the tranquil stream
While their eyes put on a far-off look, like people in a dream.
Their voices, too, grew tender, as they spoke of bygone years-
And every word was freighted with almost boyish tears.
At length the words were uttered: "Is mother alive and well?"
"She Is!" "Thank God!" across the stream in tender accents fell.
And thus they, talked of boyhood, as on the banks they lay-
While far off in the glinting the bands began to play.
One played "Off to Dixie," to fight with Massa Lee;
Another played "The Starry Flap " from the mountains to the sea.
And then the heart's full tribute went up to heaven's dome,
As the bands along the line swelled out "Home, Sweet Home."
Then from those mighty armies, in a chorus wild and grand.
Rang out, "Three cheers for horne â God bless our native iand!"
Their honest eyes grew brighter, while the welkin rang with cheers;
Their faces (not less manly) became bedewed with tears
Wore that night a happier look, as they grasped each other's hand.
In that noble first-born Union, love for their native land.
A Union that's grown stronger with them through changing yearn-
That some review with honest pride, and others see through tearsâ
A Union firm cemented throughout the land to-day
For the boys in blue are building homes for those who wore the gray.
And In our old Virginia home our mother wears to-day
A knot of ribbons on her breast, of colors blue and gray,
Beside her sits a veteran, who fought with Robert Lee,
While his brother's bones are resting where Sherman reached the sea.
But when you speak of Union her face lights up with pride
And her hands rest on the curly heads that are playing at her side
And she tells of her dead hero, with a mother's fond regret
And of her rebels, little boys. "Who'll protect the Old Flag yet."

NO WOMAN IS EXEMPT.
Regularity is a master of importance
in every woman's life. Much pain is,
however, endured in the belief that it
is necessary and not alarming", when
in truth it is all wrong and indicates
derangement that may cause serious
trouble.
Excessive monthly pain itself will
unsettle the nerves and make women
old before their time.
The foundation of woman's health is
a perfectly normal and regular per-
formance of nature's function. The
statement we print from Miss Ger-
trcde Sikes, of Eldred, Pa., is echoed
in every city, town and hamlet in this

" Dear Mrs. PntKHAx: â I feel like a

A man named Burns, who was riding
furiously to the fire on a bicycle, ran
into Mrs. A. Goldmeyer, an aged lady,
of 574 Howard. She was knocked down
and rolled on the cobblestones in the
middle of the street. Her face was
badly cut and bruised and it is feared
she sustained internal injuries which
may result fatally. Burns did all in his
power to assist the injured woman. She
was taken to a nearby drugstore, her
wounds dressed, and then she was re
moved to her home. District Engineer
MoClusky's horse was badly cut on the
right foreleg and the rear axle of h:s

driver who left his team standing on
Howard street. McClusky tied his
horse near a pile of iron on the south
side of Howard street, near the cor
ner of Fremont. The patrol came dash
ing up, the horses excited by the run.
The patrol driver got down from his
seat and left his team standing near
MoClu.sky's rig. The team became
frightened and bolted, striking the en
gineer's horse, throwing him into the
pile of iron. Engineer McClusky tele
phoned the veterinary of the depart
ment to come and attend the injured
animal.
The result of the driver's negligence
would have hoc-n very serious if his
team had not collided with McClusky's
horse. The frantic animals were run
ning straight toward the crowd at the
corner when they were stopped by the
collision.

It was announced positively at the

EARL OF ABERDEEN
SNUBS CONSUL DUDLEY
Turns His Back Upon the American
When an Anglo-Saxon Alliance
Is Broached. s
VANCOUVER, B. C, July There
was a mild sensation in Consular cir
cles to-day over a direct snub adminis
tered to Consul Dudley by the Queen's
representative in Canada, the Earl of
Aberdeen, Governor-General of the Do
i minion, while paying his official visit to
this coast. There were present the Con
suls of Chile, Ecuador, Hawaii, Japan,
Norway and Sweden, Spain, Germany,
France and the United States.
The American Consul made a tentative
remark regarding an Anglo-Saxon alli
ance. Aberdeen fenced the question, say
ing the English-speaking race should be
friends. Consul Dudley fenced for an
opening and again made a courteous re
mark on the alliance subject, which nec
essitated a reply. Aberdeen attempted
to change the subject pointedly, by say
ing:
"Canada has a rich country in the Tv-
The American Consul felt injured, and
pressed his point, when Aberdeen ndget
ted in his hair, turned partly around and,
leaving the United States representative
unanswered, carried on small talk with
other representatives.
Consul Dudley, who is a very courteous
and diplomatic gentleman, is said to have
been much annoyed at the affront. As a
matter of fact. Dudley simply wished to
be pleasant to the Queen's representative.
While Aberdeen, ever hypercautious,
feared to commit himself.

CALLING FOR BIDS FOR
FOUR NEW MONITORS
Limit of Cost Fixed by CongTess Is a
Matter of Regret to Naval
Deoigners.
"WASHINGTON. July 26.â The Navy
Department has Issued an advertise
ment calling for proposals for con
structing by contract the four harbor
defense monitors provided for by the
naval apppropriatlon bill. The bids
will be opened on Saturday, October 10.
It is a matter of regret to the naval
designers that the limit of cost for
these vessels fixed by Congress is so
low as to make it necessary to build
monitors of such small tonnage and of
lighter battery power than is desirable
in these advanced days, but the Con
struction Bureau has managed to pre
pare plans that will, after all, result in
a very serviceable type of harbor-de
fense vessel.

A ROMANCE OF SANTA ROSA
YOUNG WOMAN CASTS ASIDE A
WIDOW'S WEEDS.
Mrs. Edith McCarthy Learns That
the Husband From Whom She
Separated Is Among
the Living.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, July 26.â Mrs. Edith
McCarthy, a young woman of good
family in this city, has just learned
that the widow's weeds which she has
worn for months should never have
been donned. She has received the
surprising Information that her hus
band Is yet among tho living, though
his death was believed to have occurred
some time ago.
In \he city of Fresno, on October 14,
1894, Miss Edith Davis, a young lady
well known in Santa Rosa, having
lived here all her life, was married to
George T. McCarthy of San Francisco.
It is said that the marriage did not
prove a happy one, and a short time
later McCarthy went East. Soon word
was received In this city that he was
ill. His wife started for his bedside
at once, but shortly after she had ar
rived at Wheeling, West Virginia, her
destination, a tHe^ram was received by
relatives in this city containing the
news of McCarthy's death. In a few
weeks she returned quietly and alone
to her home in this city.
To-day a lettor was received from
McCarthy stating that he had just seen
a notice of his death published in the
Santa Rosa Press-Democrat, and that
he wished to correct the impression
that he was no longer in the land of
the living. This letter was written from
Pittsburp, Pa.
When ween to-day Mrs. McCarthy
said that upon her arrival in the East
she met her husband. While he un
doubtedly had been ill, he was not se
riously so. She thereupon continued
her journey to New Manchersville, not
far from Wheeling, W. Va., where she
visited relatives. She had been there
but a few days when she received a
telegram from F. W. Adams, whose
name she recognized as that of a per
sonal friend of her husband, stating
that McCarthy was dead, and asking
what disposition should be made of
the body. Upon receipt of this infor
mation she states, she telegraphed to
her relatives in this city.
The letter received from McCarthy
to-day states that his wife left him un
less she started from Wheeling for New
Manchersville. This was after she had
seen him the time she started East, be
lieving him to be very ill. McCarthy's
letter also quotes what he alleges in a
portion of a note his wife sent him
when she starteu from Wheeling. This
extract is to *\e effect that Mrs. Mc-
Carthy did not care to have anything
more to do with her husband.
Mrs. McCarthy has many friends in
this city. Since her return from the
East it has been generally Buppoaed
that she was a v.idow.

ADMIRAL MILLER SAILS TO-DAY
TO HOIST THE FLAG OVER HAWAII
RRAR ADMIRAL JOSEPH N.
MILLER will sail to-day at
2:30 p. m.. for Honolulu, on the
rnilser Philadelphia. Ho goes
to Honolulu for the purpose of
formally raising the American
flap over the Hawaiian Islands, when
the annexation proceedings are com
pleted and the transfer is flnaHy made.
When this transaction is to occur Ad
mlral Miller is unable to say. It will,
however, take place in the near future.
The Hawaiian commissioners are to
sail from San Francisco on August 10.
and nothing definite will be done until
after their arrival at Honolulu. It If
expected also that the First New York
Regiment, under Colonel Barber, who
is to be the iÂ»^t commandant, will be
landed at Honolulu on or before that
time, thus enabling the authorities to
make both a land and navul demon
stration.
Admiral Miller takes with him no
special instructions. H<Â» has simply
been directed to proceed to Honolulu to
await orders, which no doubt will be
transmitted to him at the time the
commissioners sail from here.
The Philadelphia, which has been un
dergoing repairs during the hint six
months at Mare Island navy yard,
came down yesterday to the bay and
anchored in the stream opposite Harri-
Bon street.
She'has been put in first-class condi
tion in every respect, and carries a
crew of 880 men.
At > o'clock this morning Admiral
Miller will transfer his flag; from the
Albatross to the Philadelphia, and the
fla.g will be given th^ usual rear-ad
miral's salute of thirteen guns.
lieutenant Commander Curtis of
the Albatross will, during Admiral Mli
ler's absence, have command of the
auxiliary forces, including the revenue
cutters and tugs.
The Adjutant General's office at
Washington now makes the admission
that every State has filled its quota of
troops under each call of th.- President.
The inaccurate reports emanating from
the War Department last week provok
ed a storm of indignation throughout
the country- The misleading state
ments concerning California were so
quickly corrected by the official records
from this State that the Adjutant 'Gen
eral In Washington, was no doubt
prompted to look further to ascertain
if other States had not been misrepre
sented in the figures given to the Asso
ciated Press. In looking up the records
he found that all the troops called for
had been enrolled but that some of the
States had not officially reported the
enrollment.
The official order directing: the move
ment of troops from Camp Merritt to
the Presidio la at last promulgated.
The departure of regiments from Rich
mond will begin to-morrow, when the
Seventh California will break camp
and-.march to. the reservation.
EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Receives & Large Quantity of
Hard Headed Cartridges.
Private Bush Overheated,
Â«"AMP BABRETT. father Station, July
26.â There is . not a .day now which does
not bring' to camp a new feature which
reminds all? that it- is no boys' play but
real grim war which awaits the regiment.
THE NEW TROOPSHIP SCANDIA.
Uncle Sam Is to Have a Permanent Fleet of Transports on the Pacific, and the Newly
Purchased Scandia and Arizona Are to Be Fitted Out In the Very Best of Style for
That Purpose. They Will Be Followed by the Fine Big Steamers Athenian and
Tartar, Now at Puget Sound, and Probably Two Others. These, With the Collier 3
Brutus and Nero, Will Make a Fleet with Which 10,000 Troops Could Be Moved to
Any Part of the World at a Three Days' Notice.
The sight of 260,000 fixed ball cartridges,
over 200 to the man, being hauled Into
camp to-day excited curiosity among the
visitors and showed the men that they
were gradually. If slowly, drawing \o the
â¢day when they would be r-alled upon to
do their share of the fighting. The con
signment come 1000 In a box and arf
SS^O-graln ball with solid head. Most of
the supply is from the Winchester Arm
Company, but a little Is from the United
Staf-s Cartridge Company. The ammuni
tion is stored in the adjutant's head
quarters, making the place quite warlike.
The Army Christian Commission tent
has not yet been moved from its position
In the old camp, much to the regret v!
the unlisted men. Each night the guard
line is extended so as to inclose the tent
while the evening service la being held,
but this does not allow of Its use by the
men for writing and reading purposes.
Chaplain Miller Is trying to secure a lo
cation within the guard lines for the tent,
iso it will be open at all hours for the use
of the men. Rev. R R. Lloyd spoke at
the tent to-night, while D. Kdwards will
speak to-morrow evening. H. J. McCoy
â will be present Thursday while the mem
bers of the regiment will give a pro
gramme Friday and Chaplain Miller will
occupy the tent Saturday.
Private Bush. Company F. Oakland, fell
to the ground senseless while drilling this
morning. He was carried to the hospital
by the hospital corps, and did not regain
consciousness until late this evening.
Over-exertion In the heat caused his
trouble, but the surgeon does not con
sider the case at all serious. One of the
men was overheated yesterday, hut is all
right to-day. The pneumonia patient is
able to be about, while the case which
threatened to be measles proved to be
only a serious heat rash with some fever.
He is doing finely and will soon he dls- !
charged as cured.
The guard detail was materially in- j
creased to-night. It consisted of: Cap- !
tain H. M. Simpson, Company <J. Ala- |
meda, officer of the day; lieutenant C. H. |
Holmes, Company E, Santa Rosa, officer >
of the guard; Lieutenant P. M. Miller, \
Company I, Grass Valley, super officer of
the guard: two sergeants., six corporals, ;
.sixty-three private's and twelve supernu- |
merarieg. The latter are to take the i
place of any of the regular guards who ,
may from any cause be detained from i
service when their tour of duty comes
around.
Lieutenant Colonel F. de I*. Carring
ton and Lieutenant Surgeon I). C. Mc-
Gtottigen went to San Jose to-day, where
they will be the guetp of the local lodge i
of Klks at the Installation of officers, j
They will return to camp to-morrow. In :
the absence of Colonel Carrington at regi- .
mental parade Captain William lOlliott, (
Company L>. Sail jÃafael, the senior cap
tain of the regiment, commanded the ;
First Battalion in a most satisfactory :
manner.
Mr?. Carrie McLean of San Francisco
wan in camp to-day, looking for her
cousin.David Drinkwater, who. it is be
lieved. haÂ« enlisted. She says the boy ;
left homo in anger and bus not been |
heard of direct, but from other sources
it was learned that he had been in and
about S;:n Rafael, Potaluma and Santa â 
Rosn. She believed he was going under
the name of David Waters or some other '.
assumed name. xvx v one answering her
cousin's description could be found.
The hospital rr.ws hits been established. :
and in a few days the regimental non- !
commissioned staff, hospital stewards
and corps will be enjoying their meals
together. Heretofore the men have had .
to live with the companies with which :
they came into camp.
HONOLULU GARRISON.
Colonel Barber Expects That
the First New York Will Sail
Early Next Week.
In an Interview with a Call reporter
yesterday Colonel Barber of the First
New York Regiment Bald: "My regi
ment in it? entirety will leave
here on the first of next week
for Honolulu to do garrison duty
upon that Island. The command will sail
by August 3. Three- transports have been
secured, and the regiment will embark
upon them. They will be ready the last
of this week, and they are the Lakme,
North Fork and the Charles Nelson. The
three vessels will accommodate 1330
men."
<'..lonel Barber stated that he would
leave for Honolulu on the St. Paul, which
sails on Friday, as it was the wish of
General Merriam that he should go ahead
of his regiment, for the purpose of Belect
lng a place for its encampment. The First
Xew York will, therefore, be under the
rummand of Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole.
These vessels mentioned by Colonel
Barber will not be accepted until they
have been thoroughly Inspected by the
officers of the Government, and fuiind to
be in every respect worthy. From other
than a military source the Call obtains
this view uf the ships said to be engaged
to transport the First New York:
"The first of the New York troops were
to have sailed iast Monday, but not a
steamer is us yet ready to sail. It ap-
I>t-;u* that sti-am schooners are to be
used, and Just how the soldiers will like
a trip to the tropics in vessels built for
the lumber trade remains to be seen.
Some of the vessel! named as likely to
go have been in the Klondike trade," but
a trip north is a very different thing to a
voyage to the southern fieas.
"Among the vessels mentioned as trans
ports are the Charles Nelson. Samoa,
Lakme and North Fork. The latter ves
sel Is now being fittt-d out cis 'a troop
ship.' while the Lakme will bo due from
the sound to-day, and the Charles Nel
son and Samuti are expected any time
now. The Lakme will have to be over
hauled, as when she arrived at Seattle
from St. Michael her decks were said to
be leaking. The Samoa is a small ves
sel and will have to be built up, while
the <"har!es Nelson is ready for service.
For the Klondike trade the fleet was all
right, but as troopships they will not be
able to handle more than !W> or 600 men."
It is now almost definitely settled that
the corps of engineers will accompany
the New York Regiment. A portion of
the engineers may be transported on otic
of the ships secured to carry Colonel
Barber's regiment to Honolulu. Major
Rice of the California Heavy Artillery is
very hopeful that the two batteries now
here under his command may be sent to
Honolulu, while It is also very highly
probable that the Wyoming (Alger) Light
Artillery will be given a chance to demon
strate its usefulness by being sent to
Honolulu. These two commands are
ready and equipped for duty, and the men
have been drilling constantly for the past
three months, until they have become
nearly perfect In their drills.
Captain Stoats of thp First New York,
the recruiting officer of the regiment, has
been very busily at work for the past
few days, with the result that he" has
recruited the regiment up to its required
strength, with the exception of about six
men, and these he hopes to have by to
day or to-morrow.
SEVENTH CALIFORNIA.
The Regiment Is Ordered
From Camp Merritt to the
Presidio.
The Seventh California, under Colonel
Berry, will move Its camp from Camp
Merritt to the Presidio to-morrow, and will
go into camp upon the cavalry parade.
Just between the New York regiment and
the Alger Battery. Yesterday a force of
workmen were busy laying the neces
sary pipes to supply the camp with water,
and by the first of next week nearly all
of the forces now at Camp Merritt will
have been moved to the Presidio.

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 27, 1898.
OFF TO HONOLULU-
THE U. S. CRUISER PHILADELPHIA, Flagship
of Rear Admiral Miller.
I Washington Regiment, yesterday as
1 sumed command of the two battalions
1 now at the Presidio, relieving Major
Welsenburger. The officers of this regi
ment are In hopes that the ordering of
tlie Third Battalion here, thus mobiliz
ing the regiment as a whole, means that
it is to be sent to the front for active
service.
There were five burials at the Presidio
yesterday.
Private Joseph C. Wheeler, a recruit
for the First California Regiment, died
at the Marine Hospital on Monday night
of pneumonia.
Both the division and post hospitals are !
fillci to thuir utmost capacity, and it
has been found necessary by both to
erect tents to accommodate the over- '
flow.
A PERMANENT FLEET.
Transports to Be Fitted Out in
the Best Manner for Carry
ing Troops and Supplies.
T'nrle Sam will soon have a permanent
fleet of transports on this coast. They
are being secured one and two at a tlmo,
and they are all to be fitted out in the
very bost manner. The Arizona and Scan
ilia, now in port, are to be turned Into
model transports, and the Athenian and
Tartar, now in Fuget Sound, will be their
equals when Captain Horace Z. Howard
has finished with them. All of these ves
sels are to be fitted with the Turner pat
ent Imnk. nnd everything possible ia to
be done for the comfort of the troops.
; The Athenian and Tartar were owned
! by the Union Steamship Company of
! England, but were under charter to the
Canadian Pacific Railroad, and have been
! engaged in the Alaska trade. Both of
j them are fitted with refrigerating ma
i cnlnery, and as the Arizona Is slmilarlv
supplied and the Scandia has large ice
I chambers, there will be no difficulty In
; ( nrrylng < nough fresh meat for the voy
] age and also a supply of California mut-
I ten for the boys in camp at Manila. The
; Athenian was built in 1881, and is 3582 tona
I gross and 24-10 tons net burden. She Is
365 feet long, 45 feet 8 inches broad and 23
feet deep. The Tartar was built in 1883
: and is 4425 tons gross and 27tÂ» tons net
; burden. She is 378 feet 5 inches long 47
feet 2 Inches broad and 30 feet S inches
deep. Both vessels are about the same
size as the Scandia, and, like her will
accommodate 1500 soldiers. The Arizona
cÂ»uld be fitted out to carry 1800 troops
but considerable of her space is to be
used for freight, and she will only carry
the same number of troops as the others
There wan trouble on both the Scandia
and Arizona yesterday. The German
crew on the former vessel refused duty
| as soon as the German flag wan hauleil
down, and in consequence the food for all
i hands had to be brought aboard from res
! tauraius along the front. Herman Fuk
! Mann, the baker, was the first to strike
! According to him, the hoisting of the
i Stars and Stripes was tantamount to a
! breach of the shipping articles, and he
| at once demanded two months' pay and
! transportation back to Hamburg. The
| cooks, sailors, messboys and firemen fol-
I lowed suit, and then everybody took a
day off and proceeded to form a close ac
quaintance with American beer. The cap
tain could get nothing dune, and had to
hire thirty longshoremen to take his own
and his owner's property ashore. Last
night all hands were paid off, and to-day
they will start for New York on their way
back to Gi-rraany.
Captain Crosky, late chief officer of the
Pennsylvania, 1b temporarily in command
of tho Scaiidla, and (.'hief Engineer
French, late of the Pacific Mail employ,
is in charge of the engine room. When
the Mariposa arrives from Australasia
to-day the chancea are that Mr. Hart,
her chief officer, will be made captain of
the Scandla and Mr. Crosky will be llrst
mate. To-day the big steamer goes on
the drydock and to-morrow she will go
to Angel Island to be thoroughly fumi
gated, after which she will be turned over
to the contractor* to be fitted out.
On the Arizona the trouble was over a
Chinese, and Uncle Sam will now have to
fine himself for neglect of duty. The big
transport has a coolie crew, which she
frocured lv China when she was in the
longkorv*j trade. The Chinese came to
San Francisco on her and are still aboard,
waiting for a vessel to take them to
China. Yesterday morning early one of
the Chinese thought he would pay a visit
to Chinatown. Ho accordingly slipped
past thn guard on the ship arid on the
wharf, and made his escape. When the
crew was mustered in the morning Ah
Sing was mlnalng. and a hue and cry
wfin raised. It was useless, however, and
it will be many a long day before that
Chinese Is sent back to China at Uncle
Sam's expense. Had the vessel been In
charge of her old owners both captain
and ship would have been liable for the
escape of the coolie, but now Uncle Sam
has no one to blame but himself.

REGISTRAR BIGGY
AND PARKER JONES
QUESTIONS THE APPOINTMENT
OF THE CLERK.
It Is Probable That the Courts Will
Be Asked to Decide the Elec
tion Commission Wrangle.
The appointment of Parker Jones as
clerk of the Board of Election Commis
sioners will be stubbornly contested by
Registrar Biggy. The Registrar says that
he will appeal to the Treasurer to refuse
the payment of Jones' demand, and, if
necessary, will carry the case Into ihe
courts.
When the commission met yesterday
morning in executive session to continue
the work of selecting precinct registra
tion officers. Registrar Biggy appeared
before the board to protest against the
appointment of Jones. He contended that
the clerical work of the commission
should be performed by either the Regis
trar or one of his deputies. Biggy took
the stand that it was an unnecessary
waste of public money, to employ a clerk
for the eommisÃion when the Registrar
waa fully able to attend to the duties.
The Commissioners, headed by City and
County Attorney Creswell, announced
that Jones had been retained by them
and that he would" act as secretary dur
ing its present session.
Registrar Biggy then withdrew from
the meeting room and the Commissioners
resumed the work of selecting the pre
cinct registration officers. They will con
clude their labors to-day, and at a meet
ing to be held to-morrow morning will
make public the names of those selected.
The Registrar is confident that he will
be able to prevent the payment of Jones'
demand. He clt"es as authority the case

similar circumstances. The Treasurer re

brought and the case was bitterly fought.
It eventually reached the Supreme Court
and a decision was rendered by that
tribunal adverse to Falk and the Elec

EX-QUEEN LILIUOKALANI'S DE
PABTUBE FOB HAWAII.
A Suspicion That the Deaths of the
Captain and Mate of the Ken
ilworth Were Not DvÂ»
to an Accident.
Tho cruiser Philadelphia came down
from Mare Island navy-yard and an
chored in the stream yesterday. Soon
afterward Rear Admiral Miller's pennant
run up and a salute of thirteen guns
fired. The warship is all ready for her
trip to Honolulu, and will probably get
ti way to-morrow or as soon as her fresh
provisions have been put aboard. On his
arrival at the capital of Hawaii, Admiral
Miller and the Commissioners who will
go down on the cruiser with him will
hoist the Stars and Stripes, and the lsl
ands will thenceforth form part of the
great American republic.
Among the passengers who went away !
on the steamer Gaelic for Hawaii yester- !
day was ex-Queen Lilluokalani. She was
accompanied by Dr. \V. English, her phy- i
Blclan; Joseph Heb-lehue, her private sec- !
loncl John Richardson.
Other notables who sailed on the Gaelic
â were Lee Yuk Wn and I.cc Yuet Fung.
AY a is president of the Ning Tung, the
biggest and n;"St powerful of the Chi- j
nese Six Companies, and tung Is one of 1
the largest buyers of California products
in all Hawaii. There was an immense
concourse of Chinese down to see their
fellow-countrymen away.
The gunboat Iroquois -.formerly the tug
Fearless) now has company. The Vigi
lant came down from Mare Island yester
day and the Active will follow to-day. All
three vessels are now ready tor sea, and
the Vigilant may be ordered out for a
cruise at any moment. The Fearless is
w the Tacnma t>' Manila, and the
Active may be sent to Honolulu as a dis
patch boat.
E. T. Colnon, president of the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners, is about
to take a well-earned vacation. In order
to gc-t away from all business cares and
worries for at least ;â . month he has
shipped as an "ordinary seaman" aboard
the American clipper ship R. D. Rice.
The vessel is going to 1 !>e sound to load
for tho islands, and Mr- ' olnon will leave
her as soon as she dock.' 1 at Tacoma. Of
course, he is going as the guest of Cap
tain Carver, and the signing of articles Is
a matter of form.
J M M. Cabe, buyer for Redington &
Co., died In the Harbor Receiving Hospi
tal yesterday. He was subject to epilep
tic fits and fell in one la< t Monday night.
l>r. Deas attended to him, but he never
came out of the fit, aid died at noon,
surrounded by his mother and relatives.
The body was removed to the home of
his mother at WZK Fols'.m street.
The Kenllworth added a little more
notoriety to her record as a "very hard
ship" while last In Hilo, Hawaii. She
had a very hard crew, anyway, but, as
usual, there were a few who were as
bad as deep water men come; there were
Eeven who showed their hands soon after
the ship arrived In the harbor. They re
fused to work in port, and attempted
to desert, but the master appealed to the
American Consul and they were arrested
ly ihc loon I police and returned to the
custody of the ship, vowing to have ven
geance on the officers the first opportun
ey had. They were placed In irons
nrown in the sail locker. But they
did not remain there long before they
: c to a set of new sails, which were
mostly consumed. The Consul took a
hand after numerous appeals from Cap
tain Baker and the mutineers were turned !
over to the local police again. They had '
another trial and were remanded to the
iy of Captain Baker. This time he
Incarcerated them in a more secure place
j'roniised to starve them until they ]
turned to. Under this diet their senses !
returned and they were liberated. Soon :
ward three made their escape in one
of the shore boats. The remaining four,
S no other chance of escape, and
the ship being loaded, jumped over the
Fide, thinking to make the shore, a good
milÂ© and a half, unaided, but they were
drowned, as the current was strong and
the wind blowing hard. It Is now be
lieved, by those familiar with thp cir
cumstances that the mutineers who failed
to escape vowed to fire the ship, and the
report of her lorn off the coast of Chile
is a natural sequence.
MRS. STERRETT IS FREE.
Judge Troutt Exceeds His Jurisdic-
tion in the Contempt Case.
Mrs, Emma Sterrett has vanquished
Superior Judge Troutt in the matter of !
the contempt case growing out of the
Walter estate controversy. The Supreme
Court has decided that the Superior !
Judge exceeded his jurisdiction in de- I
manding that Mrs. Sterrett deliver over j
to Mrs. Josephine Walter certain Mt^rs
and papers and also ordered that phf- be '
d from the custody of the Sheriff i
Into whose keeping she had beon ordr-rpd
fÂ«>r contempt of court. Mrs. Sterrett had
refused to deliver the property to Mrs. I
Walter, executrix of the Walter estate j
claiming that the documents asked for
were her personal property and had noth
ing to do with the estate.
Judge Troutt declared her guilty of con
tempt of court and ordered 7Tef into the
custody of the Sheriff. Judgment was]
Fuspended pending an appeal to the Su- '
preme Court, which she took in the form j
of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,
which was issued on Monday. Mrs. Ster
reti was represented by H. L. Hart and I
the lower court by R. A. Friedrich. The

MANAGER VINING
IS VERY IRATE
SAYS THAT THE STTPEBVISOBS
ACTED ABBITBABrLY.
He Declares That a Fight Will Be
Made Against Bemoving the
Horse Car Bails on Mar
ket Street.
The Market Street Railway Company
will, if General Manager Vlning Is au
thority on the Intended action of the cor
poration, fight the municipality in the
courts to prevent the removal of the
horse car tracks on Market street, be
tween Second and Sixth.
"The Market Street Company," Bald
Vlning yesterday, "nas been carrying out
tue terms of its franchises. The action
taken by the Supervisors on Monday or
dering the removal of the horse carrails
was. to say the least, very arbitrary,
lhat method of declaring a franchise in
valid is a bad one and can never succeed.
Our company will do all that the law re
quires of it, but it cannot be forced
to pay the cost of repaying Market
street. The city has already ac
cepted the street and is, therefore, re-
Bponsible for any changes made in the
matter of pavement. The city claims that
when the horse car lines were consoli
dated with our electric and cable sys
tems the original franchises for horse
cars went out of effect. We claim that
such Is not the case, and that the fran
chises still remain In force and effect
while we live up to the terms of the fran
chises. Under these circumstances the Su
pervisors have no right to order the re
moval of the horse car rails and we will
stand by our rights."
Mayor Phelan, on the other hand, says
that the best legal authorities In the city
declare that the Market Street Railway
Company has no claim to the street now
covered by the horse car rails. "I am
determined." said he yesterday, "to force
the issue. If the company does not com
mence the work of repaying the street
and removing its horse car traces at the
expiration of the ten-day limit action will
be commenced by the city. I do not know
what steps will be taken, but this I do
knowâ the proper steps will be taken
and taken wtih vigor. The railroad com
pany will be forced to conform to the
laws of the city."
TWO WOMEN FIGHT
IN THE COURT ROOM
BOTH LOVED FRANK DANEBI
AND WERE DECEIVED.
He Gave the Earring's of Madame
Georgette to Emila Capelli, and
a Hair-Pulling Match
Followed.
Madame Georgetta and Em!la Capelli
are to-day phy on hair and sore In body.
They had a battle In Justice Groezinger's
court yesterday afternoon, but owing to
the Interference of mutual friends no
other decision than a draw could be
given.
The fight was not for a purse. The tro
phy was a pair of diamond earrings and
the affections of Frank Daneri. Both
â¢women have a fondness for Daneri, but
did not know that they were rivals until
yesterday, when they met In the court
room. Madame Georgetta had sued Ca
pelli for the earrings, claiming: that they
were her property. Capelli replied by
stating that the jewels belonged to her,
being a present from Daneri. It was Just
at that moment that the battle began.
Madame Georgetta In an instant was af
ter Capelli. They did not wait for the
call of time. Both women went to the
center with fire in their eyes and a de
termination to fight to the death. They
clinched and when separated both had
a handful of hair to mark the first round.
Without taking the minute rest allowed
under Queensberry rules they went at one
another again. There was another hair
clinch and shin-kicking match. The
si>potators protested against a continu
ance of the match, as neither of the con
testants was fighting fair.
Madame Georgetta, full of anger but
minus many golden tresses was led out
<>f the courtroom and taken away by her
frk-mls. Madame Capelli was escorted
from the impromptu prize ring five min
utes lat<Â»r and the "white winged angel
of peace" resumed her place on the head
of the "wingless angel" on the dome of
the new City Hall tower.
Justice Groezinger will render his de
cisionânot on the merits of the fight
but as to the ownership of the earrings,
when the janitor removes the "evidences"
of the "mill" from the courtroom.
KICKED OUT OF A RESTAURANT.
Complaint of Charles Heath, a Col

case in Judge Mogan:s court yesterday
morning. The defendant, was Spaso Java.
vich, who keeps a restaurant on the water
front.
Heath testified that he went into the
restaurant Monday and ordered a cup of
coffee, and chops. After finishing his
meal he offered 10 cents in payment, when
Javovich grabbed him by the coat collar
and kicked him out of the place.
Javovich a"sked for a continuance until
to-day, when he will present his side of
the case.
B. B. Roberts ActÂ«d Fairly.
The statement in last Sunday's Call |
that B. B. Roberts, agent for the Tesla
Coal Company, had taken a five-dollar
gold piece from two newsboys and re
fused to return it until arrested is now
satisfactorily explained. The facts in the
case are that Mr. Roberts, suspecting the
boys had received the coin from some one i
who thought it a nickel, took the money
with the intention of giving It to a po
liceman. One of the officers to whom he
offered the gold piece refused to take it
but told Mr. Roberts, whose card he took
to give it to Captain Splllane. Subse
quently Mr. Roberts saw the two boys
in conversation with two policemen in
a saloon. He voluntarily went up and
giving his version of the affair, turned
the money over to the officers, who ex
pressed their belief that he had done the
proper thing.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 27, 1898.
REAL ESTATE
AT A LOW EBB
A Week Brings Little
Encouragement.
THE SALES SMALL AND FEW
PBOGBESS IN BUILDING FOBMS
A STBIKING CONTBAST.
The Beview of the Becords â New
and Becent Building Contracts
and General Bealty
Notes.
The condition of the real estate mar
ket t\a.s Improved but little during the
past week. Few, If any, sales of more
than ordinary importance have been
negotiated and the general current of
the realty stream seems to be in a state
of stagnation. The brokers, however,
content themselves with and abide by the
hope that the present dullness cannot
last much longer and that prosperous
times will inevitably follow the summer
monthsâ the dullest period in tho entire
year.
Building operations are steadily In
creasing and form a striking contrast
to the lack of business progress in real
estate. Many contracts, both for large
and for email amounts, have been let
during the past seven days with a good
prospect for more in the future.
The record for large mortgages Is
small, there being few aggregating In
value more than $10,000. Releases and re
conveyances, as shown by the records are
likewise few, and not for unusually largo
pledges.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
During the week there were nfty-four mort
gagee and trust deeds recorded, amounting to
1162,071. For the same period fifty-eight re

O F yon Rheln reports the completion of
his 'buildings on Third and Jessie streets,
which have been under construction for the
last six months. The fact that before the
buildings passed from the contractor to the
owner the principal portions have been leased,
each for a term of years to responsible parties,
seems to prove that an up-to-date structure in
a central locality, even In these times, need not
go without tenants in San Francisco.
The following are the lessees of the three
stores: Llndh the tailor; Pacific Electric Mo
tor Company and Messrs. Hurtzlg & Sehmelz.
The last named firm are druggists.
The upper part, used as a lodging house and
consisting of forty-six rooms, has been leased
to r-lark W. Phillips.

furnished with sidewalk elevators and nave
been so constructed as to be as light as the

strictly modern flats on the northwest corner

cants are already being Hated for them.
LOCHNER OUT
OF THE TANKS
Coroner's Jury Fonnd
Nothing Against Him.
MURDER MYSTERY UNSOLVED
WOMAN "STBANGLED BY PABTY
OB PABTIES UNKNOWN."
Police Are Now Industriously Look
ing for the Missing Husband
and the Stolen
Watch.
After being imprisoned for nine days
with no charge against him Joseph Loch
ner, degenerate, who was suspected of
murdering Sadie Carpenter in the Hub
bard House, Is now free. He was re
leased yesterday immediately after the
Coroner's jury brought in a verdict that
the woman "came to her death by stran
gulation at the hands of party or parties
unknown." The verdict was approved by
the Coroner.
When the inquest wajs resumed at 9
o'clock yesterday morning Lochner took
the stand and completed the tale of his
connection with the tragedy, which was
begun the day before. He made a little
speech to the jury before leaving the
stand in which he reviewed the testimony
which had been given at the inquest and
called the attention of the jury to incon
sistencies in the evidence' given by Lizzie
Riley and others. He alluded to the
statement of Mrs. Riley that she heard
some one wearing squeaking shoes leave
Sadie's door and go down the stairs, and
then referred to Night Clerk Prieur's
testimony that he saw no one leave the
house. Lochner said he often came home
late at night and saw the clerk dozing in
his chair and on other occasions Prieur
was nowhere in sight. He denied that
he had ever quarreled with Mrs. Carpen
ter and wished the jury to take cogni
zance of the fact that her watch, money
and some of her wearing apparel are
missing. His final wurds were:
"Gentlemen, I am a law-abiding citi
zen, and innocent of any crime."
Coroner Hawkins and one of the jurors
cross-examined Lochner, but he made no
admissions which would in any way con
nect him with the murder. He was then
excused.
Thomas McDonough testified that he
went to his room in the Hubbard House
about 1 a. m. on the night af the murder,
but he did not hear or see anything un
usual. "Darby" Glynn followed him and
told of Lochner's visit to the Bellevue
saloon, when he told the bartender and
himself that Mrs. Carpenter had been
found dead in hfer bed. Deputy Coroner
took the stand and said that he
had found Sadie's purse in the bureau
drawer and opened it in the presence of
Lochner. ((Lochner denied this.) Sol
dier Carsten, who had been a friend of
Sadie's for two years, was sworn, but
he could shed no light on the mystery of
her death. George Weissgerber, barten
der at the Bellevue saloon, gave testimo
ny similar to that of Glynn.
George Dolan and D. W. Shea, two new
witnesses, swore that they were in Sa
die's room about two months ago and
had a conversation regarding Lochner.
She told them that she was afraid of a
crazy Dutchman who occupied a room
connecting with hers, and showed them
the curling irons with which she bolted
the door. She told them that he was
jealous of her and became wild when he
saw her talking to other men.
This concluded the testimony. The Jury
retired and remained out fifteen minutes,
returning with the verdict.
After approving the findings the Coro
ner discharged the jury- As they were
leaving thoir seats Lochner jumped up
and said: "Gentlemen, I thank you."
"You needn't," replied one of the jur
ors, as he passed him, with a loathing
look.
Lochner was taken hack to the City
Prison and about an hour afterward was
released by Captain Seymour, indorsed by
Chief Lees.
The Chief and Captain Seymour had no
fault to find with the Coroner' 3 verdict.
They both admitted that there was no
evidence against Lochner. The depart
ment has resumed and redoubled its ef
forts to get some trace of the missing
watch. A systematic search of the pawn
shops and repair-shops is now being
made. A strenuous endeavor to locate
Carpenter, the mysterious husband, is
also being made.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Anderson
called on Captain Seymour and gave Jiim
a list of things which she thinks were
taken from Sadie's room either at the
time or after she was murdered. The
list includes: One brown dress skirt (Mrs.
Carpenter's wedding dress); one silk bed-
Bpre&d, with white hand-made lace bor
der and a silk handkerchief in the cen
ter (Mrs. Carpenter made the spread and
intended to give it to her younger daugh
ter); two night-dresses; one pnir of fÂ»ltÂ«>. - s;
one pair of slippers; two pairs of cotton
hose; a fine tablecloth; two linen towels
and six napkins.
Mrs. Andorson says she is positive Sa
die did not dispose of these things, as she
had them only a few days before her
death and intended to send them to Mon
torey. The mother is also sure that Sa
die had considerable money, because a
few days before her death â¢Vne wrote her
mother to make up a list of groceries
and other things she needed for the home
and the children. At intervals whenever
needed Sadie bought a large supply of
necessities and sent them to her mother.
A DRUMMER'S ILL LUCK.
A. Parker of Los Angeles Seeks Rest
in the Receiving Hospital.
A. Parker, a respectably dressed young
man, walked into the Chief of Police's
office yesterday afternoon and complained
that he was under the hypnotic spell of
a Dr. Pierson of San Luis Oblspo. He
said he had met the doctor in Oakland
and the spell had come over him again.
Corporal Geimann, who is specially de
tailed to look after rrnnks visiting police
headquarters, took Parker to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where a dose of "d. t." mix
ture was administered to him.
After a while Parker said he was a
traveling salesman for the White Manu
facturing Company of Los Angeles, and
he had been all through Lake County
without doing much business. As it was
his trial trip he worried so much over
his lack of success that his mind had
become affected. He forgot all about the
hypnotic story he had told in the Chief's
office, and said all that he wanted now
was rest for his troubled mind.
Fractured Her Skull.
Mrs. Morgan, 221 Fifth street, met with
an unfortunate accident early yesterday
morning. She was going from the bed
room to the kitchen to see if it was time
for her husband to get up when she
missed her footing and fell down a flight
of stairs. She was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where she was treated for
a lacerated wound of the scalp and' pos
sible fracture of the skull.

What Mariani Wine Does to Soothe,
Strengthen and Sustain
. the System.
Yin Mariani (Mariani Wine) is recom-
mended as a tonic by. the medical pro-
fession all over the world. It has re-
ceived written recommendations from
more than 8000 American physicians.
Mariani Wine soothes, strengthens
and sustains the system and braces
body and brain. It gives strength;
therefore may it be described as the
conqueror of disease and the promoter
of health and longevity.
Mariani Wine is especially indicated
for malaria, fever and ague and all
miasmatic fevers.. It promptly dispels
chills, abates malarial fever, and gives
a sense of buoyancy and vigor.
' Mariani Wine is furthermore of espe-
cial value in cases of Neuralgia. Nerv-
ous Debility, Muscular Relaxation,
â¢Mental and Physical Depression and
Exhaustion, Overwork or Overstrain,
Insomnia, Headache, Nervous Dyspep-
sia, Loss of Appetite, Emaciation and
Consumption. It builds up the vital
forces and is a powerful rejuvenator. It
gives strength to the nervous system,
firmness and elasticity to the muscles,
and richness to the blood. It benefits
all and injures none.
Mariani Wine is palatable and suited
to the most delicate stomachs. In the
cases. of pale, puny, sickly children it is
invariably used with great benefit.
For overworked men and delicate
women Mariani Wine works wonders.
'.. Mariani Wine is sold by all Druggists.
Try It and you will find that it will well
sustain its reputation. One word of
caution, howeverâ let no representation
or explanation induce you to accept a
substitute. "Just as good" usually leads
to disappointment.
To every one writing to Mariani &
Co., 52 West 15th street, New York City,
will be sent, free, an interesting little
book containing portraits and auto-
graphs of Emperors, Empress, Princes,
Cardinals, Archbishops and other dis-
tinguished personages, indorsing Yin
Mariani. '

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 26.â A combination of
causes was responsible for the awakening of
the stock market to-day from the lethargy
that has held It for nearly two months. The
bears had their innings early In the day, a.Â«
eisted by a lower range of prices for Americans
from London. Later Northwest and its sub
sidiary road, Omaha, had a rally, and from
them the movement broadened and strength
ened all through the railroad list. Strength
â was also radiated from a group of bituminous
r 'ads. The activity and strength In
Eusrar also exercised an Influence In the mar
ket, accompanied thoueh it was by all sorts of
sensational rumors, and very obviously manip
ulated to squeeze the shorts. Peace runors
were renewed In the later dealings and the
announcement of the successful landing of the j
United States forces in Porto Rico also added I
to the buoyant tendency of the trading. But |
the most potential fact in the situation was the
growing certainty that an abundance of money
would continue at the command of the busi- i
ness of this country. Sterling exchange fell !
%c additional in the actual rates and %c in
the posted rates.
The surplus of Idle money was very evident
in the bond market seeking all issues except the
â class of gilt-edged bonds which have risen to
practically prohibitive prices. Total sales, !
$4,305,000.
United States old 4s registered advanced %
and the new 3s (when issued) declined % in
the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 321,500
shares, including: Atchison preferred, 14,100;

Americans was good, but investment stocks
were lower on indications of possible dearer
money. The markets were quiet, but the close
was decidedly firm on New York support. The
discount market is rising on the fall of Ameri
can exchange. The question of gold exports
to New York Is freely discussed, some people
affirming that gold may go next month. Such
talk, however, is premature.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 26.â Weather of the most
favorable character for the spring crop and
reported depression of prices at Liverpool and
London caused a weak feeling here at the
opening. July was much weaker than more
distant deliveries, owing to the freedom of
the movement of new wheat and the conse
quent greater reluctance of millers and ship
pers to continue paying premiums for imme
diate. The weather in the United Kingdom
and Continent was said to be favorable. Har
vesting was reported progressing In Russia
and Koumanla, with prospects of an enormous
yield. The spot price here was down four
cents, and outside markets reported a corre
sponding decline. Futures became heavier un
der that break in the cash market and prices
continued on the downward course until the
close of the session. July closed 3%c lower;
September 2'ic and December l%igl%c down.
Scattered showers and cooler weather start
ed corn lower. Scalpers were disposed to do
considerable selling and some of the promi
nent bulls also sold freely. The country, how
ever, was a good buyer through commission
houses, and a steady feeling waa developed.
The close was %<S%e lower than yesterday.
Oats were almost steady on a good seaboard
demand. September closed %c lower.
Provisions opened easy on the soft feeling
in corn and lower market for hogs. The mar
ket had an appearance of firmness at about
5c decline until near the close, when prices
slumped off on the break in wheat. Pork clos
ed 37^c lower; lard lufiUVs off; and ribs 15Â®
17Hc lower.

WIFE OF SAMUEL CROWLEY
VICAR GENERAL GAVE PERMIS
SION TO WED.
Anxious to Avoid Much Ceremony
They Crossed the Bay and
Surprised Their
Friends.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 26.
The season of elopements has again
come around In the Interior of the county.
To-day Mr. and Mrs. Samuel L. Hooson-
Crowley sent word from San Francisco
to their parents that they were married
yesterday in St. Mary's Cathedral by Rev.
Father Dempsey.
Yesterday Mr. Crowley. the stepson of
Mr. Ilooson, le-^ Haywards on an electric
car -without telling any one his business.
At San Leandro Miss Frances M. Bowers
joined Mr. Hooson and they crossed over
to San Francisco. The meeting had been
prearranged and two friends had been
tak.'ii Into the confidence of the young
people. They were Dan Sullivan and
Bliss Lily Bowers, sister of me bride. The
quartet," on arrival in San Francisco, at
once procured a marriage license and
started out to find a priest wno would
perform the ceremony. All was not
smooth sailing, for when Father Demp
sey was approached he refused to marry
the young couple and advised them to go
back and be married b'- their parish
priest. Mr. Hooson and Father Dempsey
wore fellow students at St. Mary's Col
lege some years ago, and finally the
father consented to submit the matter to
the Vicar General. The young couple vis
ited Vicar General Prendergast. and on
his authority Father Dempsey performed
the marriage ceremony in St. Mary's
Cathedral yesterday afternoon.
Samuel Crowley, who has been known
nearly all his life by the name of his
stepfather, J. Hooson, is one of tP / ~ best
known young men of Washington Town
ship. He has taken a prominent part in
bringing different fraternal conventions to
Haywards, and has frequently attended
various gatherings aa a delegate from
his town.
"We did not want any unnecessary
ceremony." said Mrs. Crowley this after
noon, "and so we thought it better to
cross the bay and get married as quietly
as possible. I suppose it was an elope
ment, hut Mr. Crowley and I made up
our minds several days ago and took his
friend, Mr. Sullivan, with us for best man,
while my sister came with us and acted
as bridesmaid."
The City's Western Boundary.
OAKLAND, July 26.â The Southern Pa-
I cific Company has refused to pay any
1 tax upon the personal property upon the
â  mole or long wharf beyond the line of
low tide to City Assessor Snow. It does
this in view of the late decision of the
Supreme Court in the water front case,
which held that the city only extended
to the low tide line. The western boun
dary line of the city has always been con
sidered at the three-fathom line. As the
assessment Is on the books It may er.d
in the matter being taken to the courts
and the city's boundary judicially de
termined.

clares that the house was moved on the
property by mistake. It was intended to
place the house upon an adjoining lot.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 27, 1898.
STRANGE CASE OF POISONING
Miss Haines of Berkeley Died After Four Hours'
Sickness in a House in Which a Man Was
Shot Dead a Short Time Ago.
BERKELEY, July 26.â 1n the Halnes residence In South Berkeley,
Miss Mabel Haines died yesterday after a sickness of four hours with
all the symptoms of poisoning.
The case was so unmistakably one of poisoning that Dr. W. Allen,
the family physician, refused to sign the death certificate, and reported
the case to the Coroner.
Miss Haines was taken sick yesterday afternoon about 2 o'clock.
Dr. Allen, the family physician, found her quite unconscious when he
reached the house shortly before three. She continued in an uncon
scious state for four Jiours, passing away a little after six. Mr. and
Mrs. Haines were away in San Francisco during the greater part of
their daughter's brief illness, but a telegram brought them to her bed
side before the laat moments came.
Dr. Allen waa unable to determine the cause of death at once,
and so deemed a Coroner's Investigation necessary. Deputy Coroner
Streightlf communicated to-day with Coroner Baldwin, who must or
der a post-mortem examination.
It is understood that the family believe some blackberries, of
which the unfortunate girl partook at luncheon, to have been pois
oned. The Coroner said this evening that he would await develop
ments, and could not decide whether an autopey would be held till
later.
Later It was learned that the attending physician certified to the
death as being caused by cerebral hemorrhage resulting In apoplexy,
and brought about by -violent vomiting.
D. E. Allison does not like the statement made about his wife by
Mrs. Haines, mother of the dead trirl, anl to-night he prepared the fol
lowing statement, which Mrs. Haines refused to sign:
"I hereby retract the statement made by me that my daughter
Mabel was poisoned by carbolic acid, nor did I imply that Mrs. D.
Allison was instrumental in administering said poison."
Coroner Baldwin has determined to hold an inquest and autopsy
to-morrow morning. The Allisons are neighbors of the Haines, and it is
alleered that Mrs. Allison was in some way connected with the girl's
taking the poison. Dr. Allen, who attended the girl for a few hours
before her death, signed the death certificate this afternoon.

OAKLAND, July 26-Henry Strobel of

BARNETT SAID
TO BE CRAZY
Has Lived in the Tules
for a Generation.
MAY HAVE USED SOME POISON
KNOWN TO THE TOWNHIP AS
"TULE-HOG HARRY."
He Has Been Considered Not Re
sponsible for His Actions
for Many Years
Past.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 26.
It Is not at all unlikely that Harry
Barnett of Pleasanton may be examined
as to his sanity at the Instance of some
of his frlende. Barnett Is the man who
Is charged by his daughter with poison
ing her Infant child about a month ago.
The remains of the baby are now in the
hands of Professor Colby of the State
University for the purpose of testing the
truth of the girl's story.
Harry Barnett has long been known as
"Tule-hog Harry," and so commonly Is this
name applied to the old fellow that many
people in Murray Township did not know
that the story of young Mrs. Hoover had
any reference to him, as they hardly
ever heard him spoken of as Harry Bar
nett.
"Tule-hog Harry" Is one of the best
known characters in the township. Ho
has lived In a small house among the
tules for many years, and has always
been considered more than half crazy.
He has always been the butt of small
boys and on several occasions has re
pulsed theMr levity in such a manner as
to create small riots.
"Harry Barnett, under the name of
'Tule-hog Harry.' " said William Kelly of
Pleasanton, to-day, "has been a char
acter for years. If it should transpire
that there is poison in the baby's body
and that Its grandfather administered it,
little surprise would be expressed by
ihos>e who know old Harry. He is er
ratic, quarrelsome, and of a vicious dis
position, and this is partly due to the
continual annoyances to which he has
been subjected by the little rascals who
live near him. There is no doubt that
the old man is not responsible for his ac
tions. On one occasion he shot my broth
er's dog because he said 1J; annoyed him,
and was so careless in doing it that he
came within an ace of shooting my
brother. The old man should be exam
ined, for I do not think It is safe for
him to be at large, and In this opinion
1 am sure many others concur."
TAKING A MUCH
NEEDED VACATION

MRS. STANFORD
GETS DIVORCED
She Will Probably Marry
Friend Barmore.
CASH DOWN PAID FOR HER
iHE JOCKEY FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE SCHOOLMA'AM.
He Turns Her Over to the Man He
Befriended and Will Ride
Through Life for a
While Alone.
The marital troubles of Steeplechase
Jockey Stanford and hie wife, Gertrude,
are over. A compromise has been ef
fected whereby the co-respondent In the
Australian's divorce suit, Barmore, by
the payment of a certain goodly sum,
takes Mrs. Stanford off the hands of her
husband for good and all.
That Stanford is pleased does not ex
press It. and that Barmore will marry
the erring woman who Is now allowed
a divorce Is fairly certain. The story
back of the trouble of the Stanfords la
a rather remarkable one.
Rider Stanford married Gertrude back
In Chicago something over three years
ago, when under contract to Messrs. Cor
rigan and Brenock. Being Impressed
with the fact that she was an educated
woman, he grew to have affec
tion for her and married the woman,
bringing her to California. Here he told
his friends that she was a schoolma'am.
She had been one In a little town in Wis
consin some years previously, so that no
person out this way suspected that the
meek little woman had been other than
what he represented.
Some time after the Stanfords had come
to the Golden State they met Barmore,
who was connected with a wholesale
jewelry establishment. Barmore went to
the races, and, according to the steeple
chase rider, lost considerable money, fin
ally becoming "short" $200 in his ac
counts. Stanford influenced him to bet
$200 upon Gold Dust (his mount) one day,
and as the horse won at odds of 8 to 1,
the young jeweler was enabled to make
good his shortage and to have a neat
sum with which to continue his turf
operations. Naturally Stanford thought
Barmore would ever be his friend.
Early last spring the horse pilot was
suspended indefinitely by the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, and not seeing any
signs of being reinstated, he went to
India, where he had formerly ridden race
horses. While in Singapore he received
a letter from an old friend living at
Benlcia, Cal., which led him to believe
all was not well within his household.
I- urthermore, it was hinted in the epistle
that his wife and others had plotted to
get him out of the country.
Stanford immediately took the steamer
for San Francisco, coming by way of
Shanghai. One of the first persons he
met here was Barmore, who informed
him that Mrs. Stanford had gone to Chi
cago. Barmore kindly offered to let Stan
ford have the money to take nim to the
Middle West metropolis and urged him
to go at once. In a day or so,
when rested up. he left. On his arrival
at Chicago he met Hand, the handicap
per, who had known the couple well In
California. Hand not only informed
Stanford that his erring wife was not
there but that he suspected she had sold
all the household effects and was living
with Barmore as Mrs. Barmore.
Upon his return here the timber-top
ping jockey found that Hand's suspicions
were very correct. While Stanford was
in the Windy City his wife had brought
suit for divorce on the grounds of cruelty
and desertion, and he returned in the nick
of time to defend himself. So Infuriated
was Stanford over what he had learned
that upon meeting Barmore he "took a
shot" at the despoiler of his home, the
bullet doing no further damage than to
lacerate the jewelry man's coai tails.
Barmore, for some reason best known to
himself, merely had Stanford arrested
and charged with threatening his life,
saying nothing of the shot the rider had
taken at him.
Stanford pot out of the Barmore trouble
and his lawyer wanted to have the Jew
elry man arrested.
Then followed the compromise by which
Stanford is enriched considerably and
Barmore is now entitled to wed Gertrude,
the Wisconsin schoolteacher, etc.
To Dance in a Good Cause.
An entertainment and dance for the
benefit of the Red Crops Society will bÂ«
Riven by Junior Court Pride of the Gold
en West No. 3. F. of A., at Social Hall,

pecially enjoyable time Is anticipated.

SAILS HOPEFUL
AND IN HEALTH
Liliuokalani Leaves for
the Islands.
HAS NO TRACE OF CANCER
CHANGE OF CLIMATE CAUSES
DEPRESSION.
The Ex-Queen of Hawaii Has Politi
cal and Financial Worries,
but No Organic
Disease.
Hawaii's ex-Queen, Lllluokalanl, sail
eel yesterday to revisit her late king
dom. She loft in the best of health and
sjiirlts. Her companions, after the
pretty Hawaiian custom, showered
flowers upon her to brighten her de
parture. TherÂ« was not a trace of
tears, for was not the Queen going back
to hÂ«=r <>wn people, even though they
were no longer her subjects? She knew
that faithful hands would greet her,
that faithful hearts would sustain her
through the many trials which beset
her rath.
The statement which appeared in an
evening paper yesterday that the ex-
Queen was suffering from cancer on
the right side of the neck is absolutely
untrue. She has no trace of any such
disease. The worst ailment with which
she has been afflicted is an occasional
attack of nervous depression.
"I can easily understand how such a
misapprehension arose," said Colonel
Macfarlane last night. "Her Majesty
has suffered a good deal from the
change of climate during the past two
years, during most of which time she
has resided in Washington. When com
ing to this coast, feeling nervous and
out of sorts, she thought it better that
Dr. English, a well known Eastern
practitioner, should accompany her.
"Dr. English, after arriving here,
thought he would like to try his luck
as a medical practitioner in Honolulu,
so he obtained her Majesty's permission
to accompany her to the islands. Now
thÂ« doctor has achieved fame in the
East as a cancer specialist, and there
you have the explanation of the story."
Colonel Macfarlane is remaining be
hind in San Francisco to watch the
ex-Queen's interests. He admits that,
in addition to climatic influences, polit
ical and financial worries may have
had a good deal to do with her fits of
nervous depression. "The Queen," he
says, "has mortgaged nearly all her
private property in order to meet the
expenses of her two years' residence in
Washington. She has refused all of
fers of aid from private friends, being
confident that her own resources Would
suffice to bring her through.
"She had almost attained success, the
annexation scheme was on the point of
defeat, when the war name, altering
the whole situation. Until then she
had kept up well through all trials, but
the shock was too great. Her nervous
system gave way for the time, and
hence the necessity for a medical at
tendant.
'"The Queen is not going to Hawaii
with any aggressive motive. She is
quite content to accept the Inevitable
nr.d will not offer any active opposition
t<-> annexation. Of course she expects
to receive Just treatment from the
T'niteii States and to obtain a fair com
pensation for the crown lands, which
have been taken from her by the re
public of Hawaii. But she wi'i not id
vise her subjects to resist and unless
th<"'y call upon her, by an overwhelming
vote, to oppose annexation, she will do
nothing to prevent the union of Hawaii
with the I'nited Stare*. She realizes
that her cause is lost, but her beloved
People are still left, to her and their
will is hers."

NO MECHANICS'
FAIR IN 1898
This Year's Exposition
Has Been Abandoned.
TOO MANY FAIRS THE CAUSE
NATIVE DAUGHTERS ROAST
INSTITUTE TRUSTEES.
They Say They Were Treated Like
Prize-Fight Promoters and Tell
How â Some Caustic State
ments.
There was a rumor current on the
street yesterday that the trustees of the
Mechanics' Institute were greatly wor
ried over a shortage or deficit of several
thousand dollars in the receipts for the
last fiscal year. According to the state
ment of Rodney Kendrlck, vice-president
of the institution, however, the shortage
hns not materialized, hut there has been
much anxiety as to whether the institute
would be able to hold its own during the
balance of the calendar year.
Some time ago financial conditions be
came so unsatisfactory that it was found
necessary to appoint a committee to In
vestigate the situation and report the re
sults with suggestions as to means to be
adopted to turn the adverse tide into one
of prosperity. The results of the labors
of this committee have not been made
public, but one particular point they em
phasized was the fact that if the loss of
membership In the library continued aa
it had been maintained In the preceding
three months the institute would find it
self at the end of the current year with
a very awkward deficit to provide for.
The knowledge of these bad conditions
led to a general discussion of affairs
among the trustees regarding the policy
to be pursued under these circumstances.
It had been Intended to hoid the Me
chanics' Fair as usual in the hope of add
ing to the general fund, but after long
and earnest consideration it was tacit
ly agreed that it would not be wise to
give an exposition this year lest it prove
a losing instead of a paying proposition,
ar.d the announcement win probably be
made at the next regular meeting ot the
âmere Is no deficit at the present
time." said Yice-Pfesident Kendrick yes
terday afternoon. In speaking ot the
rumor regarding the institute, "but we
feared at one time that (or several rea
sons particularly on account of the heavy
loss of membership that came with the
prospect of war, that we wonld surfer a
loss. Lately, however, we flnd that the
roll of members is increasing Bteadlly, and
if that keeps up we will be all right. We
hud intended to hold a fnir with special
features this year, but after looking over
the situation "we concluded it was not
promising.
"Thert- have been the Miners' Fair, the
Masonic Fair, the several military exhi
bitions, and now cotnes the Irish Fair.
It was not reasonable to suppose that the
merchants and manufacturers, on whom
. irgely depend for the success of our
exposition!", would care to do more of that
kind Of advertising this season, and a.s
a conseo.uer.ee we have decided that we
would not be displaying good business
sense to hold a fair, bo there will be
none this year at least. Between now and
the time to hold the exposition in Kk>
\\n will endeavor to devise some new
and taking features which will assure its
success.
"Of course the Institute is quite
wealthy, tor instance, our pavilion prop
erty alone is worth anywhere from $750,uu0
to Jl,u<'w,ikiO. Then we have the. Mission
blocks, which are very valuable. How
ever, that property is not all paid for, as
will be seen by the fact thai we arc now
paying $c>Ot per month interest on the in
debtedness. This drain, jrittt other regu
lar expenses, has to lie met, and you
know we always want to show a good
substantial net proilt at the end of each
year. 1 think things will run along nicely
from this time on.'
'ihe Native Daughters, Red Cross Aid,
which gave the highly successful drill of
tne Seventh Regiment at the Pavilion last
Thursday night, has something to say
with reference to what It calls "The
penuriousiiess of this wealthy public in
stitution." The entertainment was given
for the purpose Of raising money to send
to Colonel Smith for the benefit of the
First Regiment. California Volunteers, at
Manila, and the public responded to the
worthy call in a most gratifying manner.
"We innocently hoped when we under
took the work," said one of the officers
of the Native Daughters' organization,
"that It 3 charitable object would receive
some consideration from the Mechanics'
Institute. The Seventh Regiment pre
pared for and did its arduous work gladly,
and the Native Sons' band volunteered to
furnish concert and dance music, but
when we approached the trustees of the
Institute we found that we had sterner
stuff to deal with. We naturally supposed
that an institution that counted its wealth
by tiie hundred.-- 02 thousands of dollars
and which derived its property and sup
port from the public would In these jimes
of war and its horrors display charity
and patriotism ,is the thousands of citi
zens of tiiis city nnd State have been
and are now doing. When we asked for
terms on the use of the- Pavilion we were
curtly refused, ami to our surprise found
that we were, so far as rental was con
cerned, classified with the promoters of
prize lights and every other private en
terprise. We appealed to their patriotism,
and asked for a reduction, but could not
get one dollar concession. They charged
us .tlijp for the use of the binding, and
saiti the gas would cost $J'i. When we
got the bill we found that we had not
only been charged $14 for gas. but *2 for
turning It on and %'i for the fact that the
fixtures were equipped with a 'patent
burner.' The public, we believe, will
agree with us tn.it this was a display ol
a miserly s;.irit and what makes It worst
is the circumstance that it comes from
tho managers of this great popular pub
lic institution. '
"I must not forget to mention the
smallest and meanest thing done by the
trusu-ep. After charring us the top tlg
ure w<' were Informed that we must send
two free tickets to each trustee. Think
of that, and they were twenty-five cent
tickets too. Compare this with the fact
that every one of the women who organ
izi<l the entertainment paid for admis
sion, and the daily press gave us columns
of their valuable space to assist in mak
ing this charity work a success.
"However, without any thanks to the
trustees of tin- Mechanics' Library, and
with heartfelt thanks to the thousands
of citizens and soldier boys who cheer
fully gave their aid, the Native Daugh
ters are proud and happy to say they
cleared nearly $Wj at that drill. ' Every
cent of this money will be cabled to
Honrkorst and fmm there forwarded
to the First Regiment boys to provide
for them In sickness and hardship."

MAGUIRE MAY
SOON HAVE TO
TURN HIS COAT
His Position in the Democratic
and Populist Parties Still
in Doubt.
The Statesman's Opinion of His Own Party
as Set Forth Over His Own
Signature.
Since the pinto Populist convention
nominated James G. Maguire for Gov
ernor a change seems to have come
over the spirit of the Democratic po
litical dream. The good Democrats
who have all along professed to see in
the "little giant" the man o^ the hour
are beginning to suspect that they have
been handed a gold brick by the king
of all political bunko sharps.
The Democrats who have not looked
unkindly on the proposition to fuse
â with the Populists flnd that the Con
gressman has so manipulated things
that the only way in which fusion can
te brought about is by the placing of
Maguire's name at the head of the
Democratic State ticket. Maguire, be
sides being a statesman and a politi
cian, is a lawyer, and among lawyers
such tricks are classed under the gen
eral head of "'sharp practice." Sharp
practice tricks are not in high favor
with honest men, and that is why
honest Democrats are scratching their
heads and thinking instead of wearing
overalls and letting their beards grow
in honor of the action taken by the
tenderloin portion of the late lamented
Populist convention.
Now that the men who form the bet
ter element of the Democratic party
have begun to speculate as to the de
gree of their servitude they are mani
festing a disposition to inquire more
closely into the character of the man
who called the men of the American
navy pirates, and who, not so very
long ago foreswore allegiance to the
party which he now asks to join with
the Populists in honoring him with the
nomination for Governor of the State of
California. Not only did Maguire
withdraw from the party, but he called
it bad names, just as he did the men
who, with Sampson and Schley and
Dewey, have been fighting for the
honor and glory of the nation. He said
that the Democratic party held wealth
as the standard of respectability; that
it was a bidder for the affection of
monopolists, and that it ignored the
masses. He said much more to the
same effect and then proceeded to rub
it in by accusing the party in the fol
lowing language:
"The entire solid area of our great
country, including the natural oppor
tunities of all our peopleâ the natural
resources without which none of our
c can liveâ has been made the ex
clusive property of a few thousand
alien and domestic landlords, who by
â \ irtue of the absolute control which
they do thus, as owners, exercise over
the only means of living of our land
less millions, are robbing the latter
continuously of from one-half to four
fifths of the fruits of their labor, and
are daily driving them to lower and
lower depths of slavery and hapless
misery. This !s a system of servitude
just as complete as chattel slavery and
in many respects more atrocious; yet
the so-called Democratic party, while
claiming to be the friend of the la
borer, expressly defends this system
and bids for the support of those who
profit by it. As a self-respecting man
I feel justified and bound in honor to
â withdraw from a party which haa
fallen to such levels."
That is what the statesman once
thought of the party he now asks to
give him the highest office in the State.
As the party has not changed since the
Congressman penned those bitter
â words It is to be presumed that he has
experienced a change of heart consist
ent with his ever growing desire to
keep his hand in the public purse.
"THE GHOST"
SHOT MILLS
Solution of a Murder
Mystery.
IMPORTANT CLEWDISCOVERED
POLICE LOOKING FOR AN EX
CONVICT NAMED SULLIVAN.
Perpetrator of a Crime Committed
Three Years Ago â Suspect As
sisted McNulty to
Escape.
The police believe that If they can lo
cate "Ghost" Sullivan, a notorious
crook and ex-convict, they will have
cleared up the mystery surrounding the
tragic death of Richard Nevills, an un
fortunate carpenter who was shot and
killed by a masked robber about three
years ago.
Nevills on the night that he was
murdered visited a saloon kept by a
man named Hlldebrand at Greenwich
and Pierce streets, intending to have a
drink. A few minutes after he had
entered the saloon two masked robbers
appeared, and, covering Nevills and
Hlldebrand with their revolvers, or
dered them to throw up their hands.
Nevills lost no time in complying with
the request, evidently realizing that he
was in the hands of two desperate men.
Hildebrand, howc^ver, seeing a chance
to escape, crawled under the bar and
got into a rear room. The next instant
a shot rang out, and Nevills fell, mor
tally wounded. The desperate robbers
at once left the saloon, without having
attempted to rob the place.
A short time after they had disap
peared Hildebrand mustered up suf
ficient courage to emerge from his hid
ing place, and, going to a saloon about
a block distant, he notified the proprie
tor of the killing of Nevills. The police
were then notified, and they proceeded
to make an investigation. Several sua
pects were arrested, but as they suc
There are those who are not unwill
ing to believe that Maguire's former
demonstration of his ability to change
his political coat at a moment's notice
will stand him in good stead in the
emergency that now confronts him. He
has received the Populist nomination
for Governor and to accept it he will
have to become a Populist. In nomi
nating him the Populists attached a
string to their act by imposing as a
condition the proviso that the nomina
tion would not be valid unless Ma
guire accepted the Populist plat'orm
within fifteen days after his arrival
within the borders of the State. But
such n condition is no obstacle to a
statesman of Maguire's ability. He is
still in Washington, and even were he
to start for California immediately he
would not arrive here until after the
first day of August. The Democratic
convention will probably be held on
August 16, or before the fifteen-day
Populist time limit would expire.
Should he be so fortunate as to secure
the Democratic nomination for Gover
nor he could then accept the Populist
nomination, condition and all, with
thanks, and the Populists could inaug
urate a guessing contest on the ques
tion of his sincerity. If he does not
receive the Democratic nomination he
would then be In a position to reject
the Populist proposition with scorn and
to reiterate his adherence to the Dem
ocratic principles which he once upon
a time so gayly Spat upon. To the
man up a tree it would appear that the
wily statesman has his beloved Demo
cratic party on the hip and the piebald
Populists in chancery-
Maguire's expressed belief that the
men of the American navy are no bet
ter than pirates has apparently been
followed by a public display of affec
tion for the Spaniards. An evening
paper which has all along evinced a
fondness for the statesman publishes a
Washington telegram under the follow
ing scare head:
MAGUIRE WILL
NOT TALK MUCH
Says That the Condition of Coast
Politics Will Not Per
mit It.
He Had Great Difficulty in Avoiding
the Crowds That Followed
Him About.
Is Fond of Cervera and Desires to Visit
and Thank the Admiral for His
Kindness to Him.
It would appear from this that Ma
guire has a special liking for the Span
ish admiral and has received favors
at his hands. In the light of this
publication it is even possible of belief
that some secret understanding existed
between the statesman and the Span
ish admiral at the very time when the
former called the operations of our
navy acts of piracy. The matter
might well be made the subject of a
searching inquiry were it not for the
fact that the paper which published
the story is noted for inaccuracy, and
the additional fact that on another
page of the same paper there appeared
a telegraphic item concerning the ar
rival in Washington of Lieutenant
Hobson. It is barely possible that the
latter part of the scare head referred to
Hobson and not to Magulre.
ceeded in satisfying the police of their
innocence they were released. A short
time after the commission of the crime
two detectives who were detailed on the
case heard of a conversation which
clearly proves that Sullivan, alias "the
Ghost," was one of the masked robbers.
After leaving the scene of the murder
the robbers headed for the water front,
and realizing that they were safe from
arrest entered a saloon kept by a man
named Kerwin. Sullivan seemed dis
appointed at not "getting the stuff," as
he expressed It, and, turning to his
companion, accused him of being a
"dub."
"If you had held up that Dutch
man," he is said to have remarked, "I
would not have been forced to have shot
the other guy."
His companion replied that he did
not want to kill him, which seemed to
anger Sullivan.
"You wanted me to kill the other fel
low, though," he angrily retorted.
"If you had been on to your Job you
would have stored the boss from en
tering the rear room, and we could
have copped off the dough."
Trembling with â¢ fear his companion
in crime declared that he was glad
that he had not shot Hildebrand.
"You didn't have to kill him," re
marked his murderous accomplice. "If
you had placed your gun under his nose
he would have quit. Instead of making
the play good you let him get away. I
had to stand for the other guy (mean
ing Nevills) and when he kicked I
pumped it into him. I hope he is dead,
as he had no right to interfere, as we
were not after his stuff."
After having several rounds of drinks
the men left the saloon, evidently un
mindful of the fact that their conver
sation had been overheard. A hanger
on who had listened to their conversa
tion informed the police, and several
detectives were sent to find Sullivan
and his accomplice. Despite their ef
forts the men escaped, presumably
having taken passage on a Bteamer
bound for the north.
Several days ago word was received
at police headquarters stating that Sul
livan was In Seattle. A dispatch ask
ing for his arrest was sent to the Chief
of Police of that city, but no answer
has been received as yet.
Sullivan is a desperate character and
the police are satisfied that he will not
be taken alive. Some years ago Sulli
van, who is a physical wreck, from the
excessive use of opium, was arrested
for burglary and committed to the
County Jail. He became acquainted
with John McNultv who was under
sentence of death for the murder of a
man named Collins, whom he killed In
cold blood. Evidently thinking that he
would be hanged, McNulty took Sulli
van Into his confidence and together
they planned a way to escape. They
were assisted by several other convicts,
who were In the Jail at the time. The
desperate men bored their way to the
outer wall of the jail, and during an

HIS FLOCK WILL MOURN HIM.
REV. M. M. GIBSON, D, D., Pastor of the First United
Presbyterian Church, Who Died Yesterdau While
on a Vacation in Oregon.
Rev.. M. M. Gibson, D.D.. pastor of the First United Presbyterian
Church of this city, died very suddenly yesterday morning at 4 o'clock at
the residence of his daughter, Mrs. Percy Young, at Albany, Or. The sad
Information came In a dispatch received yesterday by Assistant District
Attorney A. P. Black, who is president of the board of trustees of the
church.
No details of Dr. Gibson's illness were given in the telegram, but It has
been known to his friends here for a long time past that he has been suf
fering from throat trouble, and also had a slight affection of the heart. The
remains will be brought here for interment, and will arrive by the Oregon
express at 8:15 o'clock to-morrow morning.
On April 3 last Dr. Gibson and wife left here on their annual three
months' vacation to visit relatives in the East. Leaving here he went to
Pittsbur- to visit his wife's parents. The weather was exceedingly bad at
the time, and he wrote to friends here that he was suffering from a severe
cold, which had aggravated his throat trouble. From Pittsburg Dr. and
Mrs. Gibson went to Chicago to visit John Marshall Jr.. an insurance man
well known in San Francisco. Then they journeyed to Monroe, lowa, to see
Dr. Gibson's brother, the Rev. J. B. Gibson, and to Monmouth, 111., to his
brother-in-law. Pr. Hrown.
From there they c^ parted for Albany, Or., to spend the balance of their
vacation with their only surviving child, Mrs. Percy Young, who as Florence
Gibson was very well known in the foremost church and social circles of
this city.
Dr. Gibson's health did not return, as he had hoped for after arriving
in Oregon, and he wrote to the trustees of the church and was granted an
additional month's leave of absence. He kept up his correspondence with
many friends here, and none had any idea that his illness was anything
more than temporary and hoped for his speedy recovery. Its fatal termin
ation will be a sad blow to his flock, who had looked forward with pleasur
able antlcinations to his early return to the pulpit of their church.
Matthew McCormick Gibson was born in Central Pennsylvania about 63
years ago. Ho attended various ecclesiastical colleges at Allegheny City
and other places in Pennsylvania, and allied himself with the doctrines of
the United Presbyterians. Early In lSt><> a Dr. Cooper came to San Francisco
and established the First United Presbyterian Church of this city, holding
its meetings in Swan's Hall, on the south side of Market street, about
opposite O'Farrell. After remaining here about four months and seeing
the church well established Dr. Cooper resigned the pastorate and recom
mended to his followers a young man named Gibson, then at Pittsburg. Dr.
Gibson was called and accepted, arriving here on a Sunday morning In Oc
tober, 18C6, and held his charge up to the day of his death, nearly thirty
two years.
The church thrived under Dr. Gibson's management, and soon moved to
larger quarters at the City College, Stockton and Geary streets, where the
Spring Valley Water Works building now stands, in 1870 the church erected
an edifice of its own on the west side of Mason street, near Eddy, which
was sold in 1593, when they moved to the present commodious edifice at
the corner of Golden Gate avenue and Polk street.
Dr. Gibson was loved by all who knew him for his kindly disposition
and beneficent temperament. Over six feet in height, with a kindly face
and Mowing silvery beard, his appearance marked his calling, and his sunny
nature never turned a deaf ear to a deserving charity.
The loss of his son nearly twenty years ago was a terrible blow to him,
but he bore up under it with true fortitude. He leaves surviving him a
widow and one daughter, residing in Oregon.
Dr and Mrs. Gibson resided at the manse, 1518 Fulton street, built by
the church in 1894. It was Intended to make this the initiative some time
In the future in the forming of a new church organization.
opportune moment, when the guard
was absent, they removed the bricks
which prevented them from gaining
their freedom. McNulty was the first
to pass through the aperture, and after
satisfying himself that his escape had
not been discovered, he signaled his
companions to follow hjm. Sullivan,
after his escape, boarded an outgoing
steamer, intending never to return.
When the steamer was opposite Fort

HIS OWN PATIENT.
Dr. Zabala and His Ambulance Col
lide With a Street Car.
While taking a patient to the Harbor
Receiving Hospital last evening the am
bulance was run into by Valencia-street
car No. 1231. The ambulance was pretty
badly injured, the patient considerably
shaken up and the surgeon in charge
thrown to the ground and severely
"caffs'to Oritz was the injured man, and
as he was in a drunken stupor when re

he may have a possible fracture of the
skull As the ambulance was crossing
the Market-street cartracks at East
street the collifiion occurred. Dr. Zabala,
who was in charge of the patient, was
thrown violently to the ground and sus
tained several abrasions of the leg and
his ankle was badly wrenched. He treat
ed both cases. -â _,-- ... .
The driver escaped without injury, but

"JIM" REA PROMPTLY
CALLED TO ACCOUNT
Major Frank McLaughlin Satiates
the Former Boss' Desire for
Satisfaction.
James W. Rea, bully and former
boss of San Jose, smarting over his
downfall, came up from San Jose yes
terday morning "full panoplied for
war.' Since his ejectment from the
Republh an party by the State Central
Committee last Saturday Rea has been
furious, and on the train yesterday his
loud-mouthed boastings of what he tn
tended to do to those who had acoom
phehfed Ms exit from the political arena
disgusted all the other passenger.
With the proverbial chip carefully
balanced on his shoulder, Rea made h's
way up town looking for trouble, and
found it before he had hardly begun
his quest.
Almoft the first man he met was Ma
jor Frank McLaughlin, the author cf
fill hi.s troubles, and on him Rea opened
his batteries. The return flre came so
promptly and vigorously that the bully
was Instantly cowed. Quickly assum
ing a conciliatory air Rea forced a grin
on his features and lamely at
tempted to pass his words off as a Joke.
Major McLaughlin, however, could not
see the humor of the affair, and gave
Rea to understand that such Jokes did
not go with him. The late boss be
lieved him, for he removed the chip
from his shoulder then and there and
sought no further for the scalps of his
executioners.
Burglars Scared Away.

WON COLD
CASH BY A
COMPROMISE
Famous Foley Case Is
Concluded.
SEQUEL TO THE SHOOTING
THE NEVADA SENATOR'S ES
TATE BATED AT $100,000.
Eastern Heirs Consider That They
Gained Materially by Settling
the Complicated Case Out
of Court.
George W. Baker returned yesterday
from Reno, Nev., where he has been
engaged for a week or more in the con
test of the petition for the distribution
of the late Senator Foley's estate. By
a compromise which was made at the
eleventh hour Mrs. Oscar J. Smith, the
Senator's widow, paid the Eastern
heirs, whom Mr. Baker and Judge
Blgelow represented, $25,000 in cash.
Mr. Baker considers this even better
than the winning of his suit, for if he
had secured a decision giving them all
the interest in the estate they asked it
would never have realized this amount.
In speaking- of the case last evening,
Mr. Baker said: "This was a very com
plicated and peculiar case. Senator
Foley was shot and killed by a Mrs.
Hartley in 1894. She was tried, con
victed and sent to prison for ten years.
After serving two years, she was par
doned last year by Governor Sadler.
"The Foley estate was appraised at
over $100,000, but shrank in value with
everything else in Nevada. He left no
will, and under the State law the widow
secures afl of the community property
and half of all the rest. Mr. Foley's
mother, three sisters and brother in the
East employed us to look after their in
terests. The widow signed an agree
ment to divide the property equally,
taking half and giving the Eastern rel
atives half.
"Just at this time Mrs. Hartley was
pardoned and came upon the Bcene
with a son, whom she claimed was Fo
ley's offspring. She filed a suit for
half of the property for this boy. Just
before the case went to trial the boy
died. She had her father appointed
administrator of the child's estate, con
sisting of this claim against Foley's
estate. The suit was tried last sum
mer, and as his claim would prevent
the Eastern relatives from securing
anything if he won, we fought and de
feated that case. No appeal was ta
ken, and in this way Mrs. Hartley
dropped out of the case entirely, al
though she watched it constantly, at
tending every session.
"Mrs. Foley, who had remarried,
then repudiated the agreement to di
vide the property equally, claiming
that her attorney had misinformed her
and not given her the proper advice.
She secured the services of Messrs.
Campbell, Clark and Rand. The case
was tried in Washoe County before a
jury last fall and we secured a ver
dict for a half of the estate. Mrs.
Foley's attorney, who drew up the con
tract for an equal distribution of the
estate, was on the stand at that time
and in every way possible tried to
make it appear that the contract did
not mean what it said, but to no avail.
The case was appealed on some point
of instructions, reversed and sent
down for another triai.
"This began on July 18 and continued
all last week- We had a good case,
but it never reached the Jury for a ver
dict. Before the close the attorneys
for Mrs. Smith advised a compromise.
This was decided upon and Mrs. Smith
paid us $25,000 for the Eastern heirs,
which is more than we could have re
alized If the Jury had given us all we
apked, for I do not believe that the en
tire estate could be sold to-day for 550,
000. The settlement took place on Sat
urday last."
ENTERTAIN MANY
CALIFORNIA BOYS
Sixth and Seventh Regiments Guests
of California Street M. E. Church
Society.
Nearly 1000 members of the Sixth and
Seventh Regiments, California Volun
teers, were the guests last night of the
Epworth League of California-street
Methodist Episcopal Church.
An excellent musical and literary pro
gramme was rendered in the auditorium
of the church by soldier boys and by
members of the church under direction
of EL B. Paamore.
The Seventh Regiment band rendered
the "Star Spangled Banner," the audi
ence standing. The band then struck up
a lively march, during the rendition of
which four little girls: Edith Brant Car
rie McLane, Violet Laflln and Maggie
Kenny, went among the guests distribut
ing bouquets.
The address of welcome was delivered
by J. H. Northon, president of the Ep
worth League of the church. The quartet
from the Santa Paula Company, E, con
tributed several vocal numbers. Misa
Gardner sang sweetly, and M. F. Pears,
solo clarinetist of the band, astonished
his auditors with several whistling solos.
Mles Mabel Brown recited "Elder
Lamb's Donation," Mrs. Bertha Eckman
sang "Remember the Maine," and Mr.
Spencer, of Company D, sang a ballad.
At the conolusion of the programme re
freshments were served by the ladles of
the church in the assembly room.
Polk- Street Merchants Jubilant.
The fact that the Supervisors have rec
ognized the necessity of illuminating the
business streets of the city by an extra
supply of electric lights has pleased the
Polk street merchants, and they are con
gratulating one another on their fore
sight in being the originators of the
swinging lamps in the center of the
streets for the lighting of that thorough
fare.
By the called-for contract for lights for
the city for the next two âears all the
prominent business streets will oe sup
plied with extra electric lights until mid
night.
Having succeeded so well in this matter
the Polk street merchants will gather to
gether in the near future and reorganize
on a more substantial basis. The first and
most important movement /ill be to get
the Sutter Street Railroad Company to
join with the Union street line and extend
its route along Polk street to the waters
of the bay, the company having already a
franchise for that part of Polk street
through the hogsback, which Is now cut
to the street grade.
As soon as this cut gets paved and ac
cepted the privilege of running teams on
Van Ness avenue, which has been de
clared a boulevard, will be withdrawn
and all traffic will be directed to Polk
street.
Since the Bush street boulevard "scare"
has passed by the people residing on this
street would gratefully contribute for the
purchase of a leather medal for the pres
ident of the Sutter Street Railroad Com
pany if he would instruct the superin
tendent to fill in the furrows left, in the
middle of the street by the removal of
the rails over which the ghost car used
to materialize once a day.

Major Harney's Followers Meet and
Prepare Plans for State, District
and Municipal Conven
tions.
War has been declared in the Demo
cratic camp, and from this time until the
day of election hostilities of the blood
letting kind are to be the order of the
day.
It has all along been an open secret
that the so-called Harney Democrats,
who were relegated to the political bone
yard by the Gould-Alford-McNab com
bination in the State Committee, would
contest the right of their enemies to hold
the organization of the party, but it was
not until last night that war was for
mally declared. The campaign committee
of the Harney General Committee met at
the Baldwin Hotel last evening and
mapped out a plan of campaign for the
undoing of their hated rivals. It was de
cided to send a delegation to the State
Convention and there contest with the
so-called reformers the right to take part
in the deliberations of that body. In the
meantime the Democrats of the State will
be appealed to through the medium of an
address setting iorth the history of tne
San Francisco Democracy during the
past eight years, as well as a detailed ac
count of the high-handed methods by
which the State Committee, through the
machinations of a few disgruntled poli
ticians, has sought to constitute itself the
governing body of the party in this city.
Hostilities are not to be suspended
even in the event of a failure of the con
vention to recognize the Harney delega
tion. District conventions are to be held
for the nomination of Congressmen, mem
ber of the Board of Equalization and
Railroad Commissioner. A municipal
convention will also be held and a full
municipal ticket will be put in the field.
These, in brief, are the things decided
upon at the meeting last night, and steps
were taken to carry the plans of the com
mittee to a successful conclusion.
An enrollment of voters was made at
the time the present Harney general com
mittee was brought into existence. This
enrollment is to stand, and in addition
there will be a supplementary enrollment
during two days of next week to give all
Democrats who are not on the former
rolls an opportunity to become eligible to
cast a vote at the primaries that will be
held for the selection of delegates. The
time for the holding of the primaries has
not yet been fixed, but it has been agreed
that they will be held during the week
after next.
All of the members of the campaign
committee declare that the die has been
cast and that the courts will be asked to
decide upon the merit of the contention
that has disrupted the local Democracy.
CONVENTION DELEGATES.
Apportionment to Be Based
Upon the Bryan Vote at
the Last Election.
The members of the Gould-McNab-Al
rord Democratio County Committee met
last night and decided upon the plan of
apportionment of the delegates to the
State Convention at Sacramento. After
a lengthy discussion it was determined
that the apportionment be based upon
the Bryan Democratic vote in the differ
ent Assembly districts in that campaign.
This means * victory for the district
south of Market street, which now gets
equal representation in the convention.
Heretofore the district north of Market
street had four-fifths of the delegates,
thus being in control. Under the present
management they have but two-fifths of
the votes.
According to the apportionment made
last night the Twenty-eighth District,
with two county commltteemen, gets
eleven delegates to the State Convention;
the Twenty-ninth, with three, gets ten;
the Thirtieth, with two, gets ten; and the
Thirty-first, with one, gets twelve. This
covers all the districts on the south side.
The other plan which was suggested at
the meeting and rejected, was that of
equal representation. Under this system
the 153 delegates would be equally divided
among the eighteen districts.
The result of the meeting will be sub
mitted to the County Committee on Tues
day next for its acceptance or rejection.
