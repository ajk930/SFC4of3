Spaniards Now Demand to Be Per

Weapons.
But the Dons (3re Informed That They Must Yield
at Once or the flrmy arjd Navy Will f^e

NEW YORK, July 16. â The correspondent of the Herald at Washington telegraphs
as follows early this (Saturday) morning: An assault upon Santiago may yet be necessary
to secure the fall of that city. The terms of surrender have not yet been fully agreed upon.
At i o'clock this morning, as Secretary Alger was leaving the White House in company
with Secretary Bliss and Postmaster General Smith, he said he was authorized by the Pres
ident to thus state the situation:
"The Spanish general does not want to lay down his arms. He desires to carry them
back to Spain with the troops. This proposition has been positively and emphatically re
fused. General Toral must surrender on our own terms. Otherwise the city will be attacked
from land and sea and occupied by American troops."
Thus it appears that the question of allowing the Spanish troops to take their arms
back to Spain is the one point standing between the peaceable or forcible taking of San
tiago.
One of the members of the Cabinet with .whom I have just talked expressed the
opinion that when General Toral received our ultimatum he would yield.
Another expressed doubt, and suggested that General Toral's negotiations for peace
were solely for the purpose of delay to enable him to strengthen his position by reinforce
ments from other points in the Santiago district.
"As diplomatists," this Cabinet officer remarked, "the Spaniards can beat us, and it
looks a little as if General Toral, realizing his inability to cope with General Shafter on the
field of battle, had resorted to trickery in the hope of rinding some escape from the diffi
cult position in which he is placed."
SPANIARDS MUST
SURRENDER OR FIGHT
WASHINGTON, July 16.â Dispatches
received at the War Department from
General Shafter late last night con
tained the disappointing news that the
arrangements of the Spanish and
American commissioners for the sur
render of Santiago had come to a stand
still through the insistence of the Span
lards that they be allowed to retain
their arms.
Orders were telegraphed to General
Shafter not to grant any concessions
beyond those agreed to In the first In-
stance â transportation of conquered
army to a Spanish port. The instruc
tions sent to General Shafter were em
phatic and Imperative.
After an extended conference with
the President last night at which three
other members of the Cabinet were
present Secretary Alger was asked if it
was not the expectation that when it
was known that no otner terms would
be granted the surrender would take
place and replied that such was the
case. In any event no other concession
â would be afforded by this Government.
It was nearly 1 o'clock when the con
ference at the White House adjourned.
Besides Secretary Alger there were
present Secretaries Bliss and Wilson
and Postmaster General Emery Smith.
Adjutant General Corbln was present
during the last hour of the conference.
General Shafter will be immediately
instructed to carry out the determina
tion of the President, with whom the
matter has been thoroughly discussed.
Secretary Alger did not say how much
time would be allowed the enemy to
reach a conclusion, but it is known
thnt the administration will make it
very short and submit to no further
parley with General Toral.
The next move Is surrender upon the
terms which the United States Gov
ernment proprrses or immediate attack
upon the Spanish forces by the army
and navy.
ANXIOUS WAITING
AT WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, July 15.â There was
a long and anxious wait to-day to hear
further news from the Commissioners
who had been charged to make ar
rangements for the surrender of the
Spanish army at Santiago. For eight
een hours no word came from either
General Shafter or General Miles, al
though there was the keenest desire on
the part of th<> President and the Cab
inet officers to learn what was to be
done and whether the actual surrend
ering Of Santlagq and the Spanish
troop* had been carried out.
When the Cabinet met at 11 o'clock
there was nothing from the front
which would serve as a guide for the
deliberations. It was thought that thy
The San Francisco Call
cable had been Interrupted, but In- I
quiry of General Greely, chief signal j
officer, eavo assurance that the cable i
was Jntact. Thereupon Secretary Al
ger pent a dispatch asking for the sit
uation up to the latest moment and
particularly inquiring as to how far
the surrender had proceeded. No an
swer came while the Cabinet was in
session.
In the meantime, General Greely
had cabled, and he was the first to
hear from the front. A dispatch from I
Lieutenant Jones, military censor at j
Playa del Este, reported that the mes
sage from the Secretary of War to
General Shafter was only six minutes
in passing from Washington to Playa
del Este. The message received by
General Greely came at 2:23 p. m. and
indicated that negotiations were still
in progress, but as the dispatch was
submitted to the President no details
were given o.ut.
Toward the middle of the afternoon
uispatches from General Shafter and
General Miles began to arrive. In re
sponse to Secretary Alger's dispatch.
They were not given out in full, but
such portions as were made public
showed that the negotiations were still
in progress and that the Spaniards had
raised some rather unexpected ques
tions. Most important of these was an.
insistence that the Spanish troops
should retain their arms when they re
turned to Spain. There was an entire
willingness on the part of General
Toral to turn over the arms to General
Shafter at the time of the surrender,
but with this was to bo the understand
ing that tho arms were to be restored
to the Spanish troops when Spanish
soil was reached. This was a condition
which had not be^ri anticipated. The
authoritios here did not regard it as
serious or as likely to overcome a final
settlement, as It was attributed to the
Spanish sensitiveness against the hu
miliation Involved in the laying down
of their arms. One of these dispatches,
after specifying that this difference had
arisen, added that a settlement would
be reached before the day closed. Gen
eral Shafter himself summed up the
situation by saying: "It cannot be pos
sible that there will be a failure in com
pleting arrangements."
Here are the official telegrams from
the front:
"PLAYA. Balquiri. July 15.âSecre
tary of War. Washington: Commis
sion on behalf of the United States was
appointed, consisting of Generals
Wheeler and Lawton and Lieutenant
Miley, to act with Spanish commission
to arrange the details for carrying into
effect the capitulation. I will reach
Slboney to-morrow. MILES."
The second dispatch Is signed by
Jones, a signal officer in charge of the
terminus of the military line at Playa,
and is as follows:
"PLAYA, July 16.â The commission
appointed to arrange the details of the
surrender held a meeting yesterday

lasting until a late hour. They met
agaii. this morning at 9:30 o'clock, and
It is supposed the terms will be settled
to-day."
"HEADQUARTERS. SANTIAGO
(via Playa), July 15.â Adjutant Gen
eral, Washington: Sent you several
telegrams yesterday as did General
Miles, in regard to the surrender. Gen
eral Toral agreed yesterday positively
to surrender all the forces under his
command in Eastern Cuba upon a dis
tinct understanding that they were
to be sent to Spain by the United
States; this surrender was authorized
by General Blanco, and it was agreed
that its submission to-morrow was
merely formal. The commissioners to
arrange details were appointed â
Wheeler. Lawton and Miley on the part
of the United States. Points were im
mediately raised by tho Spanish com
missioners. The discussion lasted un
til 10 o'dmjk last nicht. My commis
sioners think the matter will be set
tled to-day and met at 10:30 o'clock this
morning. There are about 12,000 troops
in the city and about as many more In,
the surrounding districts. Twenty-five
thousand in all will be transported.
General Miles was present, and said
the surrender was as absolute and
complete as possible. It cannot be pos
sible that there will be failure In com
pleting arrangements.
"Water famine in the city is immi
nent. Have the supply cut. This was
told Lieutenant Miley by the English
commissioner. Will wire frequently
when conditions are progressing.

SUBORDINATE OFFICERS
PREVENT CAPITULATION
NEW YORK. July 15.â The Tribune's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
General Toral is ready and able to sur
render the city of Santiago and the
forces immediately under his command
at that point, but in his corps there are
between 8000 and 10,000 men, under regi
mental officers, constituting the garri
sons of Guantanarr.o, Baracoa and
other places, which seem to be in open
rebellion against the Spanish general.
They have appealed to Madrid, declar
ing they will not passively lay down
their arms, but will fight to the last.
From the failure of Admiral Sampson
to send any of his ships into the har
bor, the authorities here fear that the
garrisons of some of the harbor forti
fications are among the recalcitrants.
General Blanco is known to be encour
aging rebellious colonels to resist, since
tie learned that yellow fever had broken
out among the American troops.

to Spain has proved to be a serious
problem to the administration. It has
to-day been the chief matter under
consideration. It has brought together
at intervals for conferences the offi
cials of the various departments,
among them Mr. Meiklejohn, Assist
ant Secretary of War; Secretary Alger,
Surgeon General Sternberg, Commis
sary General Eagan, Adjutant General
Corbin and Colonel H. J. Heckner,
Chief of the Bureau of Transportation.
President McKinley has been kept
Informed of these conferences.
"Such a thing," said an army officer,
In the War Department to me to-day,
"has hitherto been unheard of in mili
tary annals, and while the new situa
tion is curiously interesting, it is never
theless perplexing^ Health, food and
means of transportation have been the
chief points of consideration, and the
safety of American seamen and Amer
lean ships has not been neglected. For
example, Colonel Heckner has advised,
I am told on excellent authority, that
American bottoms be not considered.
This suggestion nearly prevailed, and
in the proposals for bids only neutral
bottoms will probably be considered.
For it is frankly admitted at the de
partment that American transports
would require convoys. It is suggest
ed that neutral bottoms would have a
right to put these prisoners off at any
port In Spain. Another point consid
ered was as to who should feed the
men. It was at first suggested that
this contract should be turned over to
steamship companies, but it was de
cided that no risks should be taken of
having the prisoners half- fed; that it
would not be worthy of this nation,
and that this Government must under
take the problem of rations."
The printed formula of a "Cuban ra
tion" is upon the desks of those in
charge of this matter, and the calcu
lation now is to furnish to the commis
sary of each transport rations for 800
daily for fifteen days. This is the basis
of the food solution.

HAVANA, July 15.â Ramon Blanco,
Captain-GeneraJ of Cuba, to-day de
clared that if he could prevent it there
would be n<> peace between the United
States and Spain on a basis of Cuba
passing from Spanish control, and that
he favored waging incessant warfare
against the United States.
Owing to General Blanco's great In

Spain, his firm determination not to
encourage peace proposals contemplat
ing Cuban independence is of much im
portance. When I solicited an inter
view with him Governor-General
Blanco said he would talk to the Her

emphatic in all his statements.
"It has been reported in the United

of the latter on the way down, as a
result of which she was hove to for
seven hours. As soon as she arrived it
was given out that she would coal as
fast as possible and hurry on to Manila,
without regard to the other vessels of
the expedition in port.
The men on both vessels were allowed
shore leave and were marched to the
executive building, where they were
furnished a lunch by the people of
Honolulu. While they were eating or
ders were issued by General Merritt
for all the men to be on board re
spective ships at 3 o'clock and each
Fhip was ordered to get under way as
Boon as possible for Manila. The City
of Para and the Ohio were ordered to
anchor outside as soon as possible and
to sail as' soon as it was known that all
the men were on board. Coaling on the
Morgan City, Valencia and Indiana was
rushed as much as possible.
At 5:30 this morning the Indiana drew
anchor and moved outside the harbor.
She was followed closely by the Ohio
and the Morgan City. At 9:30 the City
of Para moved outside and joined the
fleet. Just before noon the Valencia
and Newport, the latter with General
Merritt and staff on board, left the
harbor, the signal to sail was given and
the vessels moved off.
All the troops were cheered on leav
ing port. The regimental bands on
board were playing and cheers were
given for Honolulu. The whistles of
the monitor Monadnock and island
steamers saluted as they passed by.
Before dark a telephone message
from the lookout station conveyed the
information that five of the transports
were returning to port. When the ves
sels arrived off port several officers of
the Indiana, the flagship, came ashore
and reported that a boiler had sprung
a leak. The chief engineer said that
repairs could be effected in twelve
hours, so the fleet, with the expection
of the Newport, which went on ahead,
will make another start early to-mor

General Miles had been acting as adviser, but General Shaf

to hurry the occupation of the city under any honorable

I regret to add that Major General Chaffee, whose in

trary, has fully recovered his health and is actively in com

"I shall always oppose all negotiations
for peace which have not as their foun
dation the acknowledgment of Spanish
sovereignty in Cuba. This sovereignty
has been universally recognized, and it
has been disputed by no one since the
discovery of the island."
"What, in your opinion, are the
prospects of peace between the United
States and Snain on some amicable
basis?"
"I have heard no one speak in favor
of peace," General Blanco replied with
great energy, "with the country which,
in return for all it owes to the United
States, goes to the extreme point of
believing us to be intentional authors
of the explosion of the Maine and that

THIRD MANILA BXPEDITION, AT
HONOLULU, July 6.â The third Manila
expedition, with the exception of the Va
lencia and the Newport, which are ex
pected to-day, has reached the first sta
tion on their long trans-Pacific voyage.
As we passed out through the Golden
Gate, far up on the heights of the Pre
sidio a h. liograph flashed "Good-by and
God bless you." That was the last link
that connected us with home and friends; i
all partings were at an end. The fleet
went courtesying out to sea, and the ;
third Manila expedition was on the broad
waters of the Pacific, on its race of 8000
miles. At 8 o'clock the Farallon Islands
were on the beam, and nearly all of us
were over the rail, bidding a reluctant
farewell to the good things the Red
Cross Society had furnished us the day
previous. Night shut in with the trade
winds blowing heavy seas over the lar
board side, drenching the decks and roll
ing the ship about much after the fashion
of a signal flag in action.
The second day out it was discovered
that the coal on the Indiana was poor and
the fireman inexperienced, which meant
a slow voyage. By the aid of the signal
corps, the Ohio, City of J'ara and Mor
gan City were signaled to proceed to
Honolulu by their own route with all the
speed possible, and then began a race with
the Ohio in the lead, the City of Para

attempt was a failure. Our bill of fare j
averaged up about as follows:
Breakfastâ Black coffee (an unadulterated
abomination); bosom of female swine (very
fat) ; boiled potatoes.
Dinnerâ mark coffee; roast or boiled meat (a
la touKh) ; potatoes boiled.
Supperâ Black coffee; hardtack.
The ship's crew was made up mostly of
Englishmen with a decidedly cockney ac
cent, who were about as stingy with their
courtesy as they are with their h's and
| final g's. However, they made a pretty
good "rake-off" from the soldiers by sell
ins sandwiches, pies, coffee and fruit.
| From one of them I learned that they had
i had a fight over the division of, the pro- i
I ceeds and that the cook had narrowly '
! escaped having his throat cut. The com
missary department also opened up a
store and sold the boys canned fruit and
other luxuries at wholesale prices. Fully I
I $2000 was spent by the recruits for neces-
I sities. I think it, will be advisable for
j those who follow us to bring a small sup

The Fourth of July was a beautiful day

considering the fact that we were in mid

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
BEFORE SANTIAGO, July 14, by The
Call-Herald Dispatch Boat Somers N.
Smith to Port Antonio, Jamaica, July
15. â As a result of a conference which
lasted from half-past 2 to 5 o'clock this
afternoon, Santiago and much of the
provinces have become American pos
sessions. This news, although it had
been confidently expected by Ameri
cans, caused tremendous enthusiasm.
Cheer after cheer went up along the
lines, and the American troops were
completely happy over this early end
ing of the Santiago campaign.
As The Call-Herald dispatch boat
Somers N. Smith was returning to the
fleet off Aguadores just at dusk the
men on the fleet were making a great
demonstration. The Smith spoke the
flagship, asking what had happened,
"Enemy has surrendered; that is
all," came back the reply from the flag
ship.
Santiago's fall and the passage of the
eastern part of the province into the
hands of the United States was con
summated at a conference this after
noon. Representing the United States
in the gathering, with full power to act,
were General Wheeler and General
Lawton. Lieutenant Miley was made
recorder and Lieutenant Mistre inter
preter. The Americans met General
Toral under a big tree standing be
tween San Juan Hill and Santiago,
about midway between the American
and Spanish trenches. Much time was
spent in discussing the details of the
surrender, and Generals Wheeler and
Lawton came to an understanding
with General Toral at 5 o'clock, and the
surrender of the beleaguered city and
adjacent territory became an accom
plished fact.
liere are the terms of surrender
agreed upon at the conference:
Spain abandons the city of Santiago
and all of the province of Santiago
east of Aserradero on the south and
Sagua on the north. All Spanish
troops are to be taken to Spain by the
United States Government. These
troops number 20,000 men, half of whom
are in~the city of Santiago.
The United States takes all the ene
my's forts and guns, the Spanish offi
cers being allowed to keep their side
arms. The American troops will not
enter the city until after the Spaniards
have embarked. Guards from the
American forces will be stationed
around the city. Members of the Red
Cp->9s will enter the city at once and
refugees will return to their homes to
morrow morning.
While the Spanish troops are prepar
ing t<Â» embark American and Cuban
sentinels are to keep out stragglers and
marauders and the Spanish are to po
lice the city.
The news that an agreement had been
reached traveled fast from the big tree
in the valley. There were cheers on
both sides when it was known definitely
that the matter had been settled. The
fact that General Toral agreed to sur
render was signaied to Admiral Samp

to-day that arrangements have been
perfected by the Government with
Commodore Watson whereby in case
the colliers should not arrive at the
appointed rendezvous at the same time
as the battle-ships and cruisers Com
modore Watson is to divide his squad
ron, leaving an adequate force behind
to thoroughly protect the colliers from
the enemy's fleet in case they should
fall in with it. The adoption of this
plan will naturally cause an increase
of the squadron, and the authorities
are therefore carefully considering this
matter.
Reports received from the fleet show

Many of the American troops ex
pressed disappointment that they had

there were 2060 Americans killed,
wounded or missing in the fighting
about Santiago. This loss was much
greater than had been expected, and
the authorities in Washington, hoping
to avert the loss of life as much as pos
sible, instructed General Miles to take
any honorable steps to terminate tht
siege without further fighting, provided
the city would be surrendered by the
Spanish. General Toral attempted to
get better terms for the Spaniards, but
the American generals reminded him
that his position was hopeless and that
he must agree to give up the city at
once or prepare to resist an immediate
assault by an overwhelming force and
bombardment by the entire American
licet. He was reminded that all of Ad
miral Sampson's vessels were in a po
sition to bombard and that gunners
were ready to fire the moment the sig
nal was given.
The Archbishop of Santiago, I am
told, had much to do with bringing
about the surrender of the city. He
had persistently objected to deferring
the surrender until sickness might dec
imate our army.
General Miles, General Shatter, Ad
miral Sampson and all of the high offi
cers in both the American army and
navy feel great relief now that the
campaign practically has ended. Ow
ing to the marked increase of sickness
and the impossibility of transporting
an adequate supply of food over the
roads now made worse by the heavy
rains of the last few days, American
officers welcome the new opportunities
which Santiago's surrender presents.
General Miles, I learn to-night, will
leave for Guantanamo in the morning
on the Yale. He is likely to go to Porto
Rico at once, study the coast and find
a suitable landing place for troops.
This done General Miles will be free
to complete his plans for invasion
while the troops are being transported.
It is the plan to have the American
troops now in this vicinity leave as
soon as possible. Twenty-seven regi
ments, it has been decided, shall go to
Porto Rico at once. Only a force suf
ficiently large to hold Santiago will be
left here.
A hospital capable of accommodat
ing 2000 persons will be established in
the hills near Santiago immediately.
Despite the great mortality and suffer
ing in the city, it is believed that the
American troops for Porto Rico can be
placed on board the transports in San
tiago harbor. The work of removing
the mines from the harbor will he
gin at once. It is feared the Spaniards
will resort to lawlessness and will at
tempt to pillage the city before leaving.
In that event General Shafter will send
a sufficient force into the city to restore
order.
General Miles and the members of his
staff have refused to talk with per
sons from Siboney who have not been
fumigated, so bad are the sanitary con
ditions there.
At the front matters are becoming
more threatening all the time, the
heavy rains having exposed the bodies
burled in the shallow graves and pol
luted the streams.
that the lowa is very foul, and this
grave objection may prevent her de
parture for Spain, notwithstanding the
desire of the department to add her to
the eastern squadron. The bottom of
the battle-ship Indiana is in practically
the same condition, so that the author
ities may have to take either the Texas
or the Brooklyn. In case the Brook
lyn is selected Commodore Schley
will transfer hiÃ flag to one of the
protected cruisers, perhaps the Cincin
nati, which has flag quarters.
The delay of the American troops in
occupying the city of Santiago neces
sitate? the retention erf Commodore
Watson's fleet there. Rear Admiral
Sampson has instructions to start him
on his mission whenever he thinks the
condition at Santiago such that no fur
ther use can be made of the battle-ships
attached to the eastern squadron.
GIBRALTAR, July 15.â Three Span
ish infantry regiments at Seville have
received peremptory orders to proceed
to Algeelras. One arrived there this
evening. The troops are actively em
ployed in digging trenches in the vi
cinity of San Carbonera, near San
Rogue.
PRIZES BROUGHT IN BY
THE DIXIE AND UNCAS
They Were Flying the British Flag
and Laden With. Provisions
for the Enemy.
KEY WEST, July 15.â Three prizes were
brought In to-day. The captures were
effected with only ordinary Incident. The
English - built steamer Grenow Castle,
which for several years plied on the
Cuban coast under the Spanish flag, but
on June 8 laÃt returned to her British
register, was taken by the Dixie off Cape
Cruz last Thursday. She was bound from
Kingston, Jamaica, for Manzanlllo with
a large cargo of food supplies. The crew
of the Grenow Castle consists of Captain
Rust, six Spaniards and four Jamaican
negroes.
The day before the capture the Dixie
took also two schooners â the Three Bells
and the Pilgrimâ both flying British flags
Rnd bound from Montego Bay to Man
zanillo with cargoes of food supplies. The
Throe Bells was originally a Nova Sco
tian boat. She is of about 125 tons and
the Pilgrim of about twenty-five tons.
Lieutenant S. M. Blunt, with two sailors
and two marines, was put in charge to
bring the Three Bolls to Key West, but
she has not yet arrived.
The British schooner E. P. Niekerson
was also among to-day's arrivals. She
was becalmed off Cape Cruz on June 30,
when the Hornet came alongside and in
formed her commander that the vessel
was a prisoner. There was no attempt
at resistance. Thf Niekerson has a negro
captain, three seamen and a cook. Two
so-called pasesengers. who turned out to
be agents for the cargo, were on board.
They are Avon Gouthard and Frank Ber
ger, and they vehemently protested
against the capture, declaring that as
British subjects they could and would
claim indemnity from the United States.
The vessel's cargo was food, including a
deckload of pigs, goats, chickens, flour,
pork, potatoes and the like. She was
bound from Jamaica for Manzanlllo.
The American auxiliary gunboat ITncas
towed in to-day a little Spanish sloop, the
Bella Yanez, taken off Cardenas. ThÂ«
sloop had no cargo and when caught was
close in shore. Four of her crew of six
jumped overboard and got to land.
The gunboat Castine brought in to-day
three Sp.-tiiiurds who had deserted from a
Spanish gunboat in Havana harbor and
put off to the blockading fleet in a small
boat.
Will Be Used as a Transport.
TACOMA, July 15.â The big Northern
Pacific liner Arizona, recently purchased
by the Government, will sail early to
morrow morning for San Francisco, where
she will be armed and equipped for a voy
age to Manila as a transport ship. The
Alaska, now at Glasgow, will take the
dace of the Arizona.
SHAFTER HASTENS
TORAL'S DECISION
TO CAPITULATE
American GeQeral p rm but Coq
siderate in Dealing With
tl)e Spaniards.
WITH THE UNITED STATES |
TROOPS BEFORE SANTIAGO DE |
CUBA, July 14 (via Kingston, Jamaica, j
July 15). â The great blow to the Span- i
ish army in Eastern Cuba has fallen, i
Santiago is lost and with it all the east- '
crn end of the island. General Toral, the
Spanish commander, agreed to the gen- j
eral terms of the surrender at a per- j
sonal Interview with General Shafter I
this afternoon, at which General Miles j
was present. The armies have had a i
campaign of three weeks of unprece- j
dented hardships both for officers and j
privates.
The victory of the Americans is
greater than was expected at first. The
Spanish troops in the Fourth Corps, the
military division of Santiago province, j
from a line drawn north from Aserra- j
deros, eighteen miles west of Santiago, j
through Los Palmas, Palmas Sorian, j
Alcantaza to Sagua de Tanamo on the |
north coast, and eastward to Cape
Maysi, are surrendered and the terri
tory is abandoned. Between 18,000 and I
20,000 Spanish prisoners are taken, j
about 10,000 of whom are in Santiago, j
The remainder are at Guantanamo, and '
others are garrisoned in the towns of |
Eastern Cuba. All these troops are to j
be embarked and sent back to Spain j
under parole.
General Shafter bears his honors
modestly. To a correspondent of the
Associated Press he said:
"The enemy has surrendered all the
territory and troops east of Santiago, j
The terms were dictated from Wash
lngton. It has been a hard cam
paign, one of the hardest I ever saw.
The difficulties to contend with were !
very great. Never during our Civil War j
were more difficult problems solved. !
The character of the country and the !
roads made it seem almost impossible '
to advance in the face of the enemy.
The transportation problem was hard, ;
too, but all the difficulties have been
successfully surmounted. Our troops j
have behaved gallantly. They fought '
like heroes and I am proud to have
commanded them. During all the hard- I
ships they have suffered they have j
shown resolution and spirit. They de- j
serve to conquer.
"The resistance of the enemy has |
been exceedingly stubborn. General â 
Toral has proved himself a foeman '
worthy of any man's steel. The nego- }
tlations which culminated in the sur- i
render of General Toral have been i
dragging on for ten days with the in- j
i termission of Sunday and Monday, .
when our batteries and fleets bom- I
barded the enemy's position. Through- i
out these periods of truce General Toral I
has shrewdly fallen back, when hard |
pressed, upon the statement that he j
was simply a subordinate and power- |
less to agree to the proposals without ,
the sanction of his superiors except un
der penalty of being court-martialed.
At the same time he seemed to inti
mate that, personally, he thought it
useless to hold out any longer. But he ,
and his garrison were soldiers, he said, j
and could die, if necessary, obeying !
orders."
It was at the personal interview be
tween General Shafter and General To
ral that the American general made the
Spaniard understand that temporizing
must cease and that before noon to- j
day a categorical acceptance of his of- I
fer must be received or the bombard- !
ment of the city would begin in earnest, j
! In the meantime all our plans had been j
i perfected. The delay had been utilized !
to good advantage. Our lines had been j
extended until Santiago was nearly
surrounded and our light batteries had ,
been so posted as to be able to do more j
effective work. In addition, arrange- j
ments had been made to land troops
at Cabanas, west of the entrance of I
the harbor of Santiago. The Spanish
batteries opposite Morro Castle were to
be bombarded anJ stormed, their guns
were then to be turned upon the city
and General Lawton's division at the
same time was to fall on the enemy's
left flank under the cover of our artil
lery fire. We could then have enfiladed
their lines and have driven them into
the city
General Toral must have realized that
he was trapped and that to hold out i
longer must mean a useless sacrifice
of his men, but he made one last effort
to gain more time this morning. While
nominally yielding to the terms General â 
Shafter proposed, before 8 o'clock he ,
sent a communication to General Shnf
ter inclosing: a copy of a telegram from
Captain General Blanco explaining that
the surrender of such an important po
sition as Santiago and the abandon
ment of Eastern Cuba would require
the direct sanction of the Madrid Gov
ernment and requesting more time to
hear from Madrid. At the same
time Captain General Blanco author
ized General Toral, if it was agreeable
to the American general, to appoint
commissioners of each side to arrange
! the terms of capitulation of the forces
i under his command on the condition of
their parole and transportation to
Spain, pending the sanction of Madrid.
He also communicated the names of the
commissioners he had selected, namely 1
Robert Mason, the British Vice Consul; !
General Toral's chief of staff. Colonel
Fontaine, and General Escarajao.
This communication was so ambigu- i
ous that it might all be upset by the !
refusal of Madrid to sanction the terms
agreed to by the commissioners and |
General Shafter resolved to have all |
the ambiguity removed before proceed- !
ing further. At 11 o'clock he mounted |
his horse and together with General :
: Miles and his staff he rode to the front. ;
iAt General Wheeler's headquarters j
General Shafter, General Miles, General i
Maus and an interpreter left their re- |
tinue and passed on over our trenches j
with a flag of truce to the mansro tree
under which the interview was held !
yesterday. They were soon joined by
General Toral. his chief of staff and
the two other commissioners appointed
by him.
General Miles took no part In the ne
gotiations. He has been careful since
his arrival here not to assume the di

After eating, sour stomach and belch-

rectlon of affairs or to detract in the
least from the glory of General Shaf
ter's achievement.
General Shafter insisted at the out
set that the commissioners to be ap
pointed should have paramount au
thority to make and conclude the terms
of surrender, in accordance with our
demands. After parleying, General
Toral acceded to this, explaining that
since his last communication he had
received direct authority from General
Blanco to do so. This being the main
point, the interview was soon con
cluded.
Before parting General Shafter com
plimented General Toral highly upon
the skill and gallantry of his resist
ance.
j Upon return to General Wheeler's
i headquarters the news of our complete
victory was communicated to General
I Lawton and to General Kent, and to
â¢ the brigade commanders. A scene of
j general rejoicing followed. General
I Shafter held a regular levee before he
dismounted and was congratulated and
complimented by all. He immediately
| appointed General Wheeler, General
â  Lawton and Captain Miley to become
commissioners on his behalf to treat
I with those appointed by General Toral.
He then issued orders to permit our
j troops to retire from the trenches, but
, absolutely forbidding any one soldier or
! civilian going into the Spanish lines.
The refugees are to be permitted to
return to their homes, but neither our
troops nor the Cuban auxiliaries are to
j be permuted to enter the city at pres
i ent.
The order as to the Cubans is very
specific. They have shown a disposi
tion to loot anything and any place.
They are not to have the privilege of
glutting their appetites for plunder in
Santiago.
A guard is to be maintained about
the city and the camps of our soldiers
are to be removed just to the front or
j to the rear of our present lines, as in
1 individual cases is most practicable.
The change of the camp sites will un
doubtedly improve the health of the
troops. The whole purpose of the
American commander now is to protect
' the health of the army, especially from
j the dreaded contagion. It is claimed
j there is no fever in Santiago, but the
I city is full of filth and stench, and if
our men are allowed to go in it will
undoubtedly become a pesthole.
The boys in the trench holes were
ignorant of the outcome of the nego
tiations until a heavy luncheon of cof
i fee, hard tack and corned beef had
been served to them.
Then General Shafter appointed
Colonel Astor and Captain McKittrick
to convey the welcome intelligence
along the line. Some of the officers fa
vored celebrating the victory with
bands and noisy demonstration, but
| General Shafter vetoed the proposition.
jHe said there was no occasion to
! humiliate the enemy, who had fought
bravely. Not even cheering was to be
permitted.,
â  (Before Colonel 'Astor and Captain
McKittrick could warn the soldiers the
i latter broke out into wild hurrahs.
! Some danced about, threw .their hats
| into the air. hugged each other
, and congratulated themselves upon the
'â â  prospect of getting out of Cuba in a
few days.
General Shafter Instructed the Com
; missioners that the inside harbor en
! trance be immediately opened to al
j low Clara Barton of the Red Cross Co
i ciety and the supply ships to enter, and
that the railroad from Siboney be
opened for a similar purpose.
"We are to supply the Spanish prison
ers with food pending their concentra
| tion and embarkation. General Toral
: requested this, saying there was very
little food. It is probable thsi the
Spanish steamers in the harbor will be
used in part for the transportation of
the surrendered men to Spain. The
. Spaniel troops abandoned the en
| trenchments early this afternoon and
! went into the city.
Our Commissioners, attended by
!an interpreter, entered the Spanish
. lines shortly after 2 o'clock and had not
returned when the correspondent left
with this dispatch.
General Miles and his staff arrived
at Siboney from the front and went
aboard the Concha. On the wharf Gen
eral Miles said:
"PnntiaÃO has surrendered on our
terms after vainly trying 1 for a lone
time to Ket hotter ones. The result is
highly gratifying. The Spanish prison
ers will be transported to Spain by us.
The surrender carries with it not only
the city of Santiago, but the entire San
tiago military district, being the east
ern portion of Cuba, west to a line

WINKS AT IMMORALITY
TAKES NO ACTION
TOWARD PURIFYING
THE INSTITUTION
There May Not Be Ever) an In
quiry Unless Governor Budd
Demands It. .
SAN JOSE, July 15. â No resignations
have been tendered, no requests for an
investigation have been made by the
accused, and no definite steps have
been taken by the management of the
Agnews Asylum to clear the moral at
mosphere of the institution under their
charge.
Each day since the startling charges
of murder and immorality were first
given publicity the people have been
expecting one or all of these things to
occur. As the matter now stands the
â¢indications are that at least a month
will go by before the work of moral
fumigation will begin unless the Gov
ernor has the courage to perform his
duty by demanding that something be
done immediately by the board of man
agers of the establishment to show the
public that It is desirous of having the
State hospital freed from the terrible
incubus of suspicion that now weighs
it down.
Chairman Curnow, who has the
power to call a special meeting of the
board, evidently is disinclined to take
the responsibility of doing so. while
Trustee Hale is of the opinion that a
suggestion for a special meeting would
nut come with good taste from him.
Said Chairman Curnow to-day, after
remarking that The Call's history of
the method by which the appointments
wer* 3 made at Agnews was correct:
"I shall communicate with the other
members regarding the calling of a
special meeting to Investigate the
charges against some of the attaches
of the asylum and see what they are
inclined to do.
"I don't think those charges against
Mr. Tourtillott and Mrs. Madigan are
well founded. I have been investigat
ing and the evidence is very weak.
"So far as Dr. Sponogle is concerned,
I know nothing of his prior history ex
cept- by hearsay."
Dr. Curnow did not care to discuss
the character of the hearsay history he
had heard.
When Mr. Hale was asked what he !
was disposed to do in the matter of I
having a special meeting called he said:
"If a special meeting is thought" de- J
sirable by the chairman of the board :
u/id the chairman of the management I
committee t'Gould), I am ready and
willing to attend it at any time and ,
place for any purpose whatever."
Asked as to what he thought of the
advisability of calling a special meet
ing he answered:
"I think the chairman of the board
and the chairman of the management
committee ought to determine that |
matter."
In endeavoring to explain the serious j
charges of murder and criminal assault
made against him by Detective Erwin
Frost Dr. Sponogle induced the yellow
journal of San Francisco to publish a !
statement attacking in a most unmanly !
and unwarranted manner the former j
matron of the asylum, Miss Ella Royce,
who took no part whatever in the pro- I
ceedings at the board's meeting on
Wednesday last. Part of the medical |
superintendent's explanation was as i
follows:
These charges are purely the result of j
malice and have no foundation in fact.
The persona at the bottom ot,them are '
parties who have been practically dls
missed from the asylum. Why they j
should assault mo is a mystery, aa I was ;
in no manner responsible for their dis- i
charges. While Miss Ella Royce, the late â 
matron of the asylum, was here our re
lations were not very friendly. Sho was a
young and impetuous woman, in no way !
qualified for the position to which Fhe !
was appointed, and it became necessary !
for me sometimes to correct her mis- j
takes. This was always done in a gen- !
tlemanly manner. She, however, took a j
pledge before the board of managers to I
use every means to injure me, and it :
seems she is trying her best.
Miss Royce has absolutely declined,
since the sensational exposures of this |
week, to be interviewed regarding what I
she knows of the affairs of the asylum, \
but in view of Dr. Sponoffle's action In j
bringing her name into the matter she j
made- the following statement to-day:
"So far I have had nothing to say
about this affair, but as Dr. Sponogle j
has attacked me I feel that in Justice '
to myself I must make an explanation. '
1 did not take any pledge before the I
board or anywhere else of the charac- j
ter the doctor ascribes to me. I don't j
understand why Dr. Sponogle should
Bay this.
"At the time I was before the board
on May 26, the day that I resigned, in
answer to a flimsy charge mude by
Miss Bambauer, they questioned me
a! out the nurses under my charge, and i
1 told them, as was the case, that their
work was very satisfactory. There was
no occasion for such an inquiry what
ever, and I intimated as much and sug
fested that their attention might be
turned v lth more profit to Dr. Spon
ogle, who was present at the time. I
told the board that he wes unfit for
the position he held; that he was an im- i
moral man; that" he lacked manhood ;
and integrity, and that no lady could ,
asosciate with him without losing her ,
self-respect. All the members of the
board were present except Mr. Upham.
"And as for Dr. Sponogle having oc
casion to correct m*> I think it would
be well for the State to employ a guar- j
dlan for him, as he Is irresponsible for j
any thing he does."
Objections have been urged by some
members of the board who have been
identified with the Gould combination
to going into an investigation without
formal written charges being filed.
They evidently have furgoten that Miss
Royce, less than two months ago, was
placed on the carpet to answer to some
Petty charges brought against her by
Miss Bambauer, Gould's Merced impor
tation. But the situation was differ- i
ent then. Gould cracked the whin and !
his creatures in the board sat ready !
to "crack through" his programme, re
gardless of legal or other formalities.
They also overlook the fact that these
charges were directly called to their at- j
tent ion in an oj.e n â¢ meeting of the !
board, and that there is at their dis
posal an affidavit which states facts
sufficient to warrant an* in fact, mor
ally compel the board u> take imme
diate cognizance of them. The docu
ment referred to is that of Mrs WII- I
liamp, which was published in The Call
of Thursday.
But, to paraphrase, the trail of the
serpent Is over it all. Gould accepted
the responsible position of trustee of I
\
1 the Agnews State Hospital, not for the
' good he could do for the State or for
i the institution, but for the means !t
; afforded of making political cap
! ital for Gould for Governer.
This fact he made perfectly
plain when the grab for patron
| age was at its height. He openly re
â  marked to one of nis colleagues of the
board that he simply wanted the posi
j tion as a means whereby he could con
trol influence to inflate his self-inaug
urated boom.
Another insurmountable reason why
Dr. Sponogle should not occupy the po
i sition of medical superintendent at
, Agnews has been discovered. He is
not legally qualified. At the last ses
! sion of the Legislature an act was
; passed which made it necessary that
the gentleman appointed to the position
mentioned must have had five years'
previous experience in an institution of
this kind. Dr. Sponogle has not had
: this experience. An explanation is due
: from the board as to why they appoint-
I ed him under these circumstances find
| why he continues to be retained.
The public is now asking, "What do >s
: the board of managers propose to do in
this matter, and when?"
"AGNEWS ASYLUM IS
ROTTEN TO THE CORE."
< Mrs. Chaplin, Once an Attache of
the Hospital, Makes Sensa
tional Disclosures.
"Agnews Asylum is rotten to the
: core! I know all about that lnstitu
; tion and what has been going on
there."
So said Mrs. M. D. Chaplin last even
i ing. She was employed at Agnews for
! the year ending February IS last, when
she was suspended for two weeks, un
til the board met, by Dr. Sponogle, who
could give no reason for this ac
| tlon other than that he was carrying
; out the Instructions of Mr. Gould. Mrs.
; Chaplin was head attendant of one of
â¢ the wards, and was suspended with
several other women.
"I at once went to Mr. Gould and de
manded the reason for my suspension,"
; said Mrs. Chaplin, "and he told me it
was cruelty. I thought this was very
i strange, indeed, as I had been doing
! very well for six months, and particu
, larly so in the violent wards. I then
went to Mr. Hale, who said he had
signed a paper because Gould had sent
it to him for that purpose. Mr. Up
ham and Mr. White are never consult
ed, and they are entirely out In the
cold. They cut no figure whatever, al
though they are honorable men.
"When the board met, Gould came
! into the board room and asked me why
I was trying to slander him and his,
meaning his half-brother, Tourtillott.
; I replied that I was not slandering any
â  body, but was simply doing my duty,
i The scandal had been told to Dr. Spon
! ogle and the matron, but had - never
i been acted upon.
"To go back a little, let me tell you
j that Gould's appointees could /do any
: thing they pleased. During Dr. Hatch's
j time, Gould sent to Agnews a woman
1 named Miss Bambauer, who at once
! began makir~ so much trouble that the
i doctor was obliged to send her home.
; Six or seven months ago, after Dr.
\ Sponogle was In charee, this woman re
' turned. The matron was out that even
. ing, and I was attending to her du
ties. I assigned Miss Bambauer to a
room which didn't suit her. She be
came indignant and said that Mr.
i Gould had told her she could have a
; certain room and she wanted It. No
â  other room was good enough for her.
"She immediately began domineering
! over everybody, and would take privi
! leges allowed to no one else, such as
I taking a bath in the middle of the day
! and going to sleep. She soon got the
matron Into trouble. The matron is
; gone, arid now Miss Bambauer is the
1 acting matron. Whenever Miss Bam
j bauer wanted a day off she simply said
j she was going to the city, and away
j she went. At all times she ran things
with a high hand. When Gould was
married the announcement acted like
jan electric shock upon Miss Bam
bauer. You can draw your own in
ference.
"There are others in the institution
i who ought to come out and tell what
they know about Tourtillott and Mrs.
Madigan. Kerns, the night watchman,
; could tell enough about that happy
pair to fin a volume of a decidedly racy
character. He has often found them
holding a session In the laundry as
I late as 12 o'clock at night, as well as
I in every out-of-the-way place about
\ the institution. Mrs. Madigan's light
has been seen burning as late as 4
o'clock In the morning, she not having
, returned to her room. Miss Fogarty
has frequently gone into her room and
turned out the light, and always
noticed that the bed had not been oc
cupied.
"One night a supernumerary attendant
came to see mo about being relieved
I from duty, and together we went to ask
Miss Royce. the matron, about It. We
knocked at Tourtillott's door for some
considerable time, and finally out
walked Mrs. Madigan. It was 12
j o'clock. Now, what do you think of
j that? It was her business to be on the
j ward at 10 o'clock. If any of the rest
of us had done anything like that we
wouldn't have remained there twenty
four hours.
"When the board met I exposed all
! these things. Gould said I was slan
i dering everybody, and some of the
trustees asserted that I was simply
talking for spite. Dr. Sponogle was
asked if ho had any charges or any
complaint to make against me, and he
said he had not, as I had clone my duty
jin every respect. As to cruelty, he said
i not one of the charges could be proved.
I accordingly took it for granted that I
would be reinstated. Gould, however,
stormed around and said that I had
! caused all the mischief, that I could not
! get along with the other girls, and that
1 I had to go, and I went.
"The Madigan woman Is about 30
years of age, of medium height, with
dark hair and dark eyes, and rather
1 attractive both In manners and appear-
I ance. Miss Bambauer is as lank as a
telegraph pole and a good ways from
being youthful. She 1b the terror of
Agnews. I took a five days' vacation,
and while I was gone she bribed the
| patleuts with candy to tell a lot ofc

cnaiged the girls."
SPONOGLE ACCUSED BY
HIS WIFE'S SISTER
.cull Investigation of Mrs. Spono-
gle's Death Was Demanded,
But Never Made.
A woman prominent in Oakland social
circle-s, who prt-fers not to have her
name mentioned in connection with the
Agnews Asylum scandal, in an inter
view yesterday stated that while acting
as secretary of the Mutual Companions'
Endowment Society of Healdsburg
some ten years ago, she received a let
ter from a sister of Dr. F. M. Sponogle'a
former wife, now deceased, in which he
was charged with having compelled
her to join the society so that in the
event of death he could reap the in
surance of $3000, and that since Joining
she had been in fear of her life. She
demanded an investigation of Mrs.
Sponogle's sudden demise, but her wish
was not granted owing to the pleadings
of Charles Weitman, a brother of the
dead woman.
The lady further stated that the let
ter was suppressed at the earnest and
tearful request of the brother and
would still be in her possession but for
a trick played on her by Dr. Kauffman,
a resident of Healdsburg at that time,
but now in the East.
"Dr. Kauffman," she said, "was a
bosom friend of Dr. Sponogle until they
fell out over a question of compensa
tion. Dr. Kauffmann came to my home
soon after Mrs. Sponogle's death and
asked to see the letter, basing his right
as a member of our organization. I
brought it to him and after he had ex
amined it he smiled in a satisfying
manner and said he would return it to
me after he had 1 shown it to his brother
Masons. That is the last I have seen
of the letter.
"After Dr. Sponogle recovered from
his injuries received In being thrown
from his buggy he and his wife went
on a visit to Sacramento. While there
she was taken suddenly ill and died. It
was afterward learned that a pimple
made its appearance on her face and
the doctor attended her. Whether he
used his own Instruments in trying to
remove the excrescence or another phy
sician did was not definitely learned.
At ail events she died and the cause
was assigned to blood-poisoning. The
news of her sudden taking off caused
every resident of Healdsburg to suspect
foul play and open charges were made
against Dr. Sponogle. Mrs. Sponogle's
body was placed in a receiving vault at
the Oakland cemetery pending develop
ments. When an inspection was made
of the body as it lay In the vault it was
so distorted that it was unrecognizable.
"The $3000 insurance was paid over to
the doctor by the society without a pro
test, the check being signed by Mrs. S.
B. Wood, a bosom friend of the dead
woman."
SPONOGLE SPEAKS,
BUT TO NO PURPOSE
Accuses His ex-Brother-in-Law and
Is Promptly Branded as
a Liar.
Dr. F. M. Rponogle has at last been
Induced to break the silence with which
he had shrouded himself after the ter
rible charge of murder was informally
made, against him at a meeting of the
board of managers of the Agnew Asy
lum for the Insane by Detective Erwin
Frost. On that occasion Frost de
manded an investigation Into charges
against Sponogle in connection with his
office as medical superintendent and in
his remarks to the board said that
Sponogle had murdered his first wife
for the insurance money on her life.
In response to Frost's request for an
investigation Sponogle hung his head
and maintained a science that created a
very unfavorable impression against
him. It was expected that in the face
of a charge so terrible, so damning,
tho accused nerson wouLd indig
nantly deny the charge and denounce
its author as a scoundrel and a liar.
It would not have appeared unnatural
even if the doctor had sprung upon the
detective then and there and killed
himâ that is if the doctor were Innocent
of the charge. That is what most other
men would have done under similar
circumstances. But the doctor con
trolled himself. There being no woman
in the case but a dead one the task of
self control was easy.
As before stated the doctor has con
sented to speak. His reply Is given
to a morning paper in this city. It con
sists first of a general denial of all the
charges. "I didn't do it," !s the key
note of his sad song. While denying
the accusations he abuses the witnesses
against him and would have the public
infer that those witnesses had con
spired together to ruin him without any
possible gain to themselves. His state
ment is most part as follows:
Frnst is, I consider, purely acting as the
agent of those who have employed him.
His charges, I suppose, were given to him
by a brother-in-law of mine, Henry S.
Weltman, who Is my bitter enemy, be
cause I stopped supplying him with money
with which to carouse and gamlile. This
man. who is known to be worthless, was
in San Jose a short time ago, and I sup
pose told Frost a list of false stories re
garding me. i
Frost accused me of poisoning my first
wife in order to secure Insurance money,
when, as a matter of fact, my first wife
died in Sacramento of acute meningitis
in ISB3. She was attended by Drs. Cluness
and Nelson of that city at the time of
her illness, and no such thing as a sus
picious circumstance In connection with
her death was ever dreamed of until this
brother-in-law came from the East and
tried to make me support him under the
throat of accusing me of poisoning his
sister. T will never consent to be black
mailed by anybody.
The story of a difficulty In Fresno with
a young girl whom Frost intimates that I
mistreated and paid $4<VN) as hush money
has for its meager foundation the fact
that in 1593 a widow German woman in
that city, who owed me a large bill for
medical services, tried to blackmail me
by crying out from my operating room
that I had Insulted her. I demanded an
investigation, which was held before
Judge Austin, and produced evidence to
show that the woman had not been In the
operating room for a minute and that the
allegations she made were impossible and
utterly false. I was completely exoner
ated from the chargo and the affair was
recognized as a blackmailing scheme by
all familiar with the circumstances
The charges of Charles Williams before
the board of .managers were a great sur
prise to me. Before Mrs. Williams,
known to us as Miss Barnheisel, was
dropped, she took occasion to come to
me and express her thanks for the cour
tesy I had shown her while here. I never
subjected the young woman to any medi
cal examination whatever and only pre
scribed for her on one occasion here. I
am open to Investigation at any time.
S. H. TVeitman, whom Sponogle des
ignates as a "worthless" man, was re
cently In the drug business on Broad
way, Oakland, and Is at present a stu
dent in the California Medical College.
He brands Sponogle's statements re
ferring to himself as unqualifiedly
false. He says that he never saw
Sponogle to know him since 1882, when
he met him in Battle Mountain, Ne
vada. Since that time he has seen the
doctor only once, and that was in Oc
tober or November, 1889, when Weit
man was employed in the California
Pottery and Terra Cotta Company at
the intersection of Market and Larkln
streets in this city.
On that occasion T. S. Chambers, an
uncle of Sponogle's second wife, was
with the doctor.
"I told Sponogle at that time," said
Weltman, "that he had murdered my
sister for the $6000 insurance upon her
life. He then asked to see the man
ager and I told him that the manager
was out; that he would be in shortly,
and that I would be there, too, when
Sponogle talked to him. I then or
dered him out of the place and I said:
'You , I'll kill you.' I went and
got a gun, and he left. That Is the
only time I ever saw him to know him
since 1882. I told him then and there
that he murdered my sister and I will
tell him the same to-day. My sister
died in Sacramento in 1883. The mat
ter was hushed up and there was no
public investigation. I was in the East
at the time."
The tears stood In Weltman's eyes
when he Bpoke of his dead sister.
"With reference to his statement that
he had refused to supply me with
money with which to carouse and gam
ble, I wish to say that I never asked
him for a cent and never got a cent
from him, and I defy him to prove it,"
added Weltman.

HONOLULU, July B.â The Legisla
ture of Hawaii was prorogued at 6 !
o'clock last evening to the great relief I
of the members and the greater satis- I
faction of the people. In viciousness of
conduct in matters of vital interest to j
the welfare of the people it has trans- I
cended the efforts of the worst legisla- I
tive assemblies which preceded it in the ;
days of the monarchy, when personal â 
influences occasionally influenced legis- |
lation but had the honesty to allow the \
people to have a fair proportion of the
profits emanating from the deals.

out of a population of over 100,000, of j
whom 26,000 are Hawaiians or part Ha
waiians and 13,000 Americans and Eu- ;
ropeans, represented themselves and .
the interests they were elected to rep- i

obtaining annexation they have made j
themselves ridiculous and obnoxious by i
perversely working against the will of j
the people in every way and in pander- |

PRINCESS OF CHIMAY DEAD
Passing of the American Heiress Who Wedded
Prince and Eloped With a Gypsy.
NEW YORK. July 15.â The Princess of Chlmay (nee Clara Ward) is dead at
Buda Pest. The cause of her death is said to have been milk fever.
Clara Ward was the only daughter of Captain Eber Ward, the millionaire
Michigan ship builder. She was born In Detroit during the panic of 1873, which,
though It diminished Captatn Ward's great wealth, leit him still a multi-mil
lionaire. After his death Mrs. Ward went on extensive travels, marrying Alex
ander Cameron, a banker-lawyer of Windsor, Canada, on her return.
Later the Camerons moved to Toronto, where Clara lived until 14 years old.
She went to school In London for three years. Clara received from her father's
estate $40,000 a year. She spent all that and more. Her mother oegan to think
the time had come for a suitable alliance. They sought the Italian sky and
sunlight, the home where so many romances have been written for centuries.
At Nice Mies Ward met a Belgian nobleman of high degree, who was to make
her Princess of'the great house of Chimay and Cnraman. It only required little
coaxing on the part of the mother. She pressed the Prince's suit and the daugh
ter was won.
The betrothal was Interesting to conti nental society, particularly to the circle
In which the Prince moved. His life had been gay and Interwoven with experi
ences.
The mansion of the family Is In the little city of Chimay, south of Belgium. Tho
nuptials were held on May 30, IS9O, in Paris, Monsignor Rotelle, the papal nuncio,
giving the benediction. The wedding presents were gorgeous. Lord Lytton and
Mr. Whitelaw Reid, the American Minister to Franco, wore witnesses for the
bride, and Baron Deyens, the Belgian minister, and the Due de Frezensac, were
witnesses for the groom.
It was very romantic for a while, but the Princess' nature was opposed to so
cial life and the spirit of adverture began to assert itself, much to the displeas
ure of the Prince. He began to hear rumors of his wife's infidelity and at one
time threatened to bring suit for divorce, but fear of a scandal prevented It. Not
even the birth of two children could bridge the chasm that separated the
couple.
On February 21 1894, the anniversary of her twenty-first birthday, the
Princess gave a grand dinner and ball in Paris. Meanwhile her subtle nature
was seeking for relief from the fashionable world. She wandered among the
cafes of Paris Incognito, trying to please her whims. It was a hunt for happi
ness. Her nature had not found it in wealth and titles.
She fastened her fancy on a Hungarian gypsy, who had nothing she had ex
cept the keen spirit of adventure and love of song. She heard him play one night
In one of the Parisian cafes. He was tall and well proportioned. The thrilling
"Rokoczy March" charmed the Princess and after a few nightÃ' visits she had
fallen a victim to the music and song of the strolling minstrel Janos Rlgo.
So It did not surprise those who knew the Princess Chimay and Caraman to
hear afterward that she deserted her husband and two children and became
the companion of the Hungarian Tzlgano,
The Princess separtated from Rlgo in 1807 and commenced suit for divorce.
The following month she was granted a divorce with alimony. It was reported
in April, 1897, that tho Prineeas was to como to New York and appear on the
vaudeville stage. She afterward was engaged to appear on a muslo hall stage
at Berlin, but was prevented by the police.
board bills should they bÂ« ousted from
office by annexation.
They have foully murdered the
bill introduced by Mr. Gear to re
peal the obnoxious penal clause of
the labor contract law; that bill
which they so faithfully promised
the people of the United States
should be triumphantly passed if
they would only vote for annexation.
When they found that the necessary
votes had been obtained they turned
around and tricked the people on the
last day of the extra session by lay
ing the bill on the table at the be
hest of their bosses, the planters.
But perhaps one of the most re
markable incidents that has ever oc
curred in a so-called respectable
Legislature took place in the throes
of its suicidal agony yesterday.
That was the railroading through in
a very few minutes of the bill of
Minister Cooper to amend the laws
relating to Chinese Immigration. As
I have already pointed out in this
correspondence this bill practically
permits unlimited and unrestricted
Chinese labor immigration and un
less some action is promptly taken
by the United States Chinese labor
ers will within the next few months
be flocking in by the thousands.
Another bill which was railroaded
through on the same afternoon In a
most extraordinary manner was the
rapid transit act, granting: a franchise
for an opposition street railroad com
pany. This bill had already passed
with an amendment, which had been
1 carelessly engrossed. It might have
been purely a typewriter's error, but It
contained the wholesome sized "nig
ger," giving to the company the right
of eminent domain over public as well
as private property.
Another bill slaughtered was the
opium licencing bill, or, rather, a bill
to regulate the use of opium and abol
ish smuggling.
A joint resolution, suggesting to the
executive the retention of the Hawaiian
flag as a State or Territorial nag in
the event of annexation, was passed
by the House, but killed by the coolie
loving Senate.
Another measure which was much
desired, but which was eventually
slaughtered by one vote by the Senate,
vtas the income tax bill â a plan by
which the rich would contribute their
fair share to the burthen of taxation
as well as the poor.
A number of excellent bills were
also killed, and the voluminous reports
on the inefficiency of the condition of
the public service were practically pig
eonholed by reference to the Ministers
of the several departments.
A resolution of suggestion to the ex
ecutive for the pardoning and restora
tion to civil rights of the political pris
oners of 159," was defeated, and. In fact,
all that could be done to prevent the
consummation of harmony between the
Hawaiians and the aliens was done by
this Legislature.
Owing to the anticipation of the ar
rival of annexation with the United
States transports there was no Ameri
can or Hawaiian celebration of the
Fourth of July, except by a horse race
and a baseball game. The American
Minister, however, held an official re
ception, to which were Invited the
members of the Government, the dip
lomatic and consular corps, the officers
of the United States warships then in
port, the Mohican, Monadnock and
Nero, and the editors of the local press.
Mr. Sewall was in excellent spirits and
freely expressed his opinion that an
nexation was closer than anticipated
by its opponents. He held that he
had been selected for this post of honor
to promote and obtain annexation, and
that it would be obtained during his
incumbency. He admitted that in this
respect hr> was a very bitter partisan.
but none the less preserved his respect
and friendship for those who conscien

RETURN LADEN
WITH GOLD FROM
THE KLONDIKE
Twenty Dawsorjites F^each Seat
tle With Over a Half-Million
SEATTLE, July 15.â The steamship
Cottage City arrived on the sound to
night with twenty men from Dawson
City. They came up the rivers and
lakt s in boats and over the pass to
Dyea, carrying gold bullion and drafts
to the value of over halfi a million dol
lars. A similar number of Klondikers,
with about the same amount of wealth,
are aboard the steamship City of Se
attle, which is due in this port to-mor
row morning. The latest of the parti
left Dawson on June 28.
Among the Cottage City's passengers
are Phil Dobson of Los Angeies, Henry
Cheney of Rochester, N. ST.. and Miller
and Vines, Eastern men, all of whom
have considerable money In drafts.
There axe also four brothers named
Butl.r of Ellsworth, Minn. As the re
sult of three years' work one of them
has about $200,000, the proceeds of the
spring wash-up and the sale of two
claims and a part of a third on Bo
nanza Creek.
Another passenger is H. M. Coleman,
representing companies from London,
England. He bought a, number of claims
in the Klondike country and he says
Dawson is now fairly humming with
excitement. The wash-up, which is
nearly concluded, has been perfectly
satisfactory and up to all conservative
calculations, '-he required payment of
royalties has resulted in an under es
timate of the reported amount taken
out. He estimates the output on which
duty is being paid to be over ten mil
lions. Mr. Coleman says that claims
24A, 688 and part of 21A on Bonanza
have proved quite rich. They were
bought by a Klondike pioneer from
Butler Brothers. Hunki r. Bear and
Eureka are exceeding highest expecta
tions and wonderfully rich strikes have
been made on bench diggings of El
dorado, Bonanza and French creeks and
Skoottum Gulch.
The passengers on the Cottage City
Bay thai most of the gold dust will go
<i"\\n the river and come out via St.
Michael. The banking facilities at
Dawson are now in good shape an>l
drafts are being issued for dust
brought in. Mounted police are guard
ing the gold belonging to the banks and
commercial companies that awaits
Bhipment to St. Michael. The Bank of
British North America received $250,
000 during the day prior to the depart
ure of one of thf- passengers.
Other men were corning into Dawson
laden with dust, which was in tins and
oth<r receptacles bound to horses,
which were heavily weighted.
The returning Klondik- -i -s report that
four river steamers â the Hamilton,
"Weare, Bella and May West â had ar
rived in Dawson. They had all win
tered at different points up the river.
No boat had arrived up to the latter
part of June from St. Michael.
BACK FROM COOKS INLET
WITH HARD LUCK TALES
Return of Thirty Prospectors Who
Embarked in a River Dredg
ing Enterprise.
TACOMA, July 15.â Thirty disgusted
prospectors who have arrived from
Cooks Inlet on the schooner Gold> n
Gate tell of great suffering and hard
ships experienced in trying to find gold
there. Ten passengers are from Troy,
N. V., where early this year H. Y.
Fuches organized them into a company
to dredge the streams running into
Cooks Inlet for gold. They paid Fuches
from $400 to $600 ea-oh, with which the
dredger was purchased. They found
the river beds full of rocks, through
which their clam-shell scoop could not
get to the golden sands below. The cur
rents were too swift to permit taking
the dredger far up the streams. The
dredger was sold for passage money
back to Puget So-und. Each member
except one had some money left, A
collection for the one man's benefit was
taken up aboard the schooner. It is
claimed that when Manager Fuches
declined to contribute some of his per
sonal effects were seized and sold for
$8. which was taken as his contribu
tion.
Every passenger on the Golden Gate
has a tale of woe to tell. Some tell of
mortgaged farms in the East, others
how they spent the savings of years on
this trip â how they staked everything
and lost. They declare that, while col
ors are numerou everywhere around
<V"k.s Inlet, all gold claims have been
taken and new-comers could not make
wages. Blistered hands and torn
clothes are shown In evidence of their
efforts at mining. Some of these men
intend earning money to take them to
Klondike. Others have wired East for
passage money home.
Another party of ten from New Ha
ven, Conn., prospected Little Sushitna
River, found colors and staked claims,'
but could not make them pay. Many
of these returned men admit that ex
perienced miners might succeed where
they failed.
One passenger claims that twenty
nine men have been drowned in Cooks
Inlet during the last four months. He
was unable to give the names oTthe.se
unfortunates, but says steamers com
ing later -will bring them. They were
"tenderfeet" and got caught in great
tide waves 20 and 30 feet high, which
rush up the inlet, sweeping everything
before them.
"SOAPY" SMITH'S CAREER
OF CRIME ENDED
Notorious Confidence Man Shot and
Killed by the City Engineer
of Skaguay.
SEATTLE, July in. â The Cottage
City brings news of the killing of the
celebrated gambler "Soapy" Smith. He
was shot a week ago by City Engineer
Smith of Skaguay.
"Soapy's" gang had robbed a man
named Stewart of $2700. Stewart came
from Dawson via the Dalton trail. He
reported his loss to a citizen's meeting
especially called, and held on the
wharf. "Soapy" and his gang pro
ceeded to break up the meeting.
"Soapy" was armed with a Winchester
rifle. City Engineer Smith, whose duty
it was to guard the wharf, refused to
allow "Soapy" on the wharf, whereup
on ho attempted to force his way, beat
ing the engineer on the head with the
butt end of his rifle.
In the scuflle "Soapy," it is believed,
intentionally shot his opponent in the
groin. The city engineer thereupon
drew his revolver and shot "Soapy"
twice, once in the leg and then in the
heart. He died instantly. An inquest
was subsequently held and his body
â¢was lying in the morgue when the Cot
tage City left.
About twenty of "Soapy's" gang
â¢were arrested, <md men armed with
rifles are patrolling the streets of
Skaguay, their determination being to
prevent any outbreak. The man who
killed "Soapy" was held for his own
safety, but no proceeding was taken

against him, as it was clearly evident
that his act was in self-defense.
"Soapy's" real name was Jeff Smith.
He was born in Southern Tennessee
and came from a good family. At the
time of his death he was 45 years old.
Ho was credited with the killing of
right men. As a sure thing gambler he
was known to nearly every man in

SECOND SHIP ARRIVES
WITH MEN AND GOLD
City of Seattle Brings Eighteen
Dawsonites and $600,000 in
Gold and Drafts.
VICTORIA, July 16.â The City of
Seattle arrived at 1 o'clock this morn
ing. It has on board eighteen Dawson
men with $460,000 in drafts and $143,000
in dust.
The City of Seattle brings the news
that Captain Teatman, with his troops
of soldiers, has reached Skaguay and
placed the town under martial law.
His men are now patrolling the town.
The Dawson men say the river is
very low and no more steamers will be
able to reach Dawson from down the
river. The steamers Hamilton and
May West left for St. Michael the day
before they left with $7,000,000 on board.
The steamer Tartar will be here to-day
with about a half million in gold on
board.
CONSIDERING THE
FORM OF GOVERNMENT
WASHINGTON, July 15.â The politi
cal status of Santiago, its method of
government and administration is now
receiving earnest attention from the
authorities here. For the present It Is
expected the military authorities will
have charge of affairs.
If the precedent of Manila is followed.
in which case General Merritt was sent
as military governor, then a military
official will be designated to administer
affairs at Santiago city and there
abouts. But it is appreciated that the
conditions are quite different at Santi
ago from those in Manila, as the Gov
ernment has disclaimed a purpose to
make territorial acquisition in Cuba
and has directed its efforts thus far to
making Cuba free and placing the Cu
bans in control. This condition may
lead to a consideration of the expedi
ency of allowing the Cubans themselves
to establish an administration of San
tiago, thus giving them an opportunity
to try their ability at directing civil
affairs and also giving them a foothold
on the island. In that event General
Garcia, being on the ground, would
doubtless figure prominently in the ad
ministration, although President Masso
and his Cabinet are said to be in the
adjoining province of Puerto Principe
and readily accessible at Santiago. No
determination has been reached, so far
as can be learned, as to the form of
administration, for until the surrender
itself is completed the authorities here
are not disposed to settle the details
of questions which naturally follow the
surrender.
It is felt, however, that an important
question of general policy hinges on the
action at Santiago, as it is the first Cu
ban territory to be acquired by our
army, and to some extent determina
tion as to its method of civil adminis
tration will serve as a precedent for the
civil administration of other parts of
Cuba when It is overrun by our army.
BROKERS AND BANKERS
PLAY POKER FOR BLOOD
Vast Sums Change Hands in a Little
Game of Draw at a New
York Hotel.
NEW YORK, July 15.â Wall street was
talking to-day of a game of draw poker
which was played on Wednesday in a fa
mous old hotel near the Stock Exchange,
in which the magnitude of losses sustain
ed by several of the players eclipsed any
thing heretofore heard of this side of the
Mississippi River. According to the story,
which was told from one end of "The
Street" to the other, four leading bro
kers and members of the Stock Exchange,
a railroad magnate from the West, who
controls one of the largest systems of
railroads in the country, and two bank
presidents, in whose vaults is deposited
wealth enough to take up several bond
issues, sat in a "little game."
A suggestion was made by one of the
players over an afternoon cocktail that he
would like to "win out" his expenses for
a European trip. Chips were valued at
$20 for whites^ $100 for reda and $100 for
blues, and when the banker dealt them
out in stacks of $5000 it was plain that thÂ»
game was to be for "blood," as tho West
erner expressed it. Luck varied as the
game ran on. The Westerner "ran up
against" three aces with two small pairs
and then hold four threes against a pair
Of kings, drawine down only about $100
on tho hand. Then one of the Wall street
men drew to. a neart flush .and filled, but
when he calledâ as he did when $f>ooo or
$>;mxi was in the center of the tableâ he
found that he was beaten out by three
fours and a pair of kinÃs. So the game
ran on with varying fortunes.
A rest was taken for dinner at 8 o'clock,
and then the game continued until dawn
was just breaking. A final jackpot of
the consolation variety wound up the
evening's entertainment, wnich had cost
one or the players between $26,000 and
$30,000 and another $21,000. Tup gentleman
who siiKgested a little game as a moans
of winning the expenses of his European
trip signed checks for a larger amount
and decided to draw still another check
for the expenses of his anticipated trip.
Dangerously Wounded Home.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., July 15.â The
United States transport Olivette arrived
at Old Point this afternoon, having on
board a number of men who were danger
ously wounded at the battle of Santiago.
None of them were landed, and the yes-

DEWEY CAPABLE
OF HANDLING THE
KAISER'S SHIPS
The Washington Authorities Trust
Him to Control Affairs at
Manila.
NEW YORK, July 15.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Although admitting that the
attitude of Germany in the Philippines
is extremely irritating it is the confi
dent belief of the authorities that Em
peror William will not push this Gov
ernment to extremes. This belief is
based on information which has
reached the authorities through official
channels of the causes wl ich actuated
the German warship Irene in prevent
ing the insurgents attacking the Span
iards at Subig Bay. I was told to-day
that the German Government holds the
position that Aguinaldo and the men
operating with him have never been
recognized l s belligerents by the United
States or by any other power and that
this Government does not publicly
recognize them even as allies. The Irene
prevented the insurgents from attack
ing the Spaniards for humanitarian
purposes and because her commander
did not think they had a recognized
place in warfare to conduct military
operations. As soon as the American
warships put in an appearance the
Irene, although almost equal in tonnage
to the two American ships, withdrew
and paid the representatives of the
naval power of the United States due
deference.
There is no disposition at present to
formally dispute this position, but the
explanation is looked upon with sus
picion. The treatment of Hear AdmiraJ
Dewey by the German commander-in
chief which has been reported to the
department is a matter for severe con
demnation, especially the non-observ
ance by the Germans of regulations
prohibiting vessels from moving about
the harbor at night. The authorities
are willing, however, to leave control
of matters at Manila in the hands of
Rear Admiral Dewey, as he is showing
excellent judgment and plenty of tact
in his treatment of disagreeable mci
WRECKED ON
TRIAL ISLAND
Steamship Tepic Goes
Ashore.
HAD A LARGE BARGE IN TOW
ENCOUNTERED A GALE IN THE
GULF OF GEORGIA.
Fate of the Captain and Crew in
Doubt, but It Is Believed That
They Escaped to the
Beach.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, July 15.â The
Union Steamship Company's steamer
Cuteh, which arrived from Wrangel
this morning, brought the news that
the steamer Tepic, owned by Captain
Cates, a well-known stevedore of this
city,, and her tow, a large barge, had
been wrecked on or near Trial Island
in the Gulf of Georgia. A gale was
blowing at the time and the captain of
the Cutch did not delay his vessel to
make inquiries, thinking he could be of
more assistance by hastening to this
port with the news.
A dispatch from Victoria late this
afternoon confirmed the report, and
help was immediately sent to the
distressed vessel. The Victoria report
stated that the Tepic had broken her
shaft in a gale and became unmanage
able. Her tow bothered her and she
drifted hekplessly on to Trial Island.
No particulars were received as to the
safety of the crew, but it is believed
all were landed safely.
The Tepic left here last night with
an immense barge, on which were
twelve patent dump coal cars for the
Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway. The
barge was to be towed to Nanaimo.
The cars were costly affairs, and,
strange to say, not a cent of .nsurance
was put on them. When the Tepic
left the weather was calm, but an hour
later a gale sprang up.
The Tepic was a stanch little steamer
and for some time past has been en
gaged in towing in the harbor. It is
reported that she did not carry insur
ance. About twelve men all told
went with her and the tow.
Pending further particulars, friends
of Captain Cates and his crew are very
anxious. Trial Island is within a few
hours 1 sail of this port.
HE NEVER SAW TROOPS
DO BETTER FIGHTING
Bravery of the Americans at Santi
ago Declared Marvelous by a
German Officer.
NEW YORK, July 15.â A Portsmouth
(N. H.) special to the Herald says:
Count yon Goetzln, military attache of
the German Embassy at Washington,
who arrived here on the United States
steamer Harvard this morning, ex
pressed his opinion of the fighting of
our troops at Santiago. Count yon
Goetzln had made a careful study of
the movements of Shafter's army from
the time of its mobilization at Tampa
until after the battle of July 1 and 2.
He had made a large number of maps,
sketches of which he had with him this
morning, and from these and his report
to the German War Office the Emperor
and military men of Germany will form
their opinions of the value of the work
done by the contending armies from a
military point of view.
"The fighting of the Americans was
wonderfully done," said the count; "in
deed, it was a highly creditable battle
on both sides. I was on the hill at El
Paso, near Graham's battery, so that
I did not see the infantry charge on the
hill of San Juan. I only learned how
formidable the place was after It had
been taken. It appeared to me that
with a stronger enemy it would have
held out longer. The Spaniards at San
Juan fought well, but the Americana
fought better. The shooting of the
Spaniards was fairly good, but that of
dents which arise.
The Monterey, according to the de
partment's advices, left Honolulu on
July 1. It is believed in naval circles
that she will reach Manila by July 27.
The Monadnock will probably reach her
destination a few days later. With these
two monitors in Manila Bay Rear Ad
miral Dewey will have a force much
superior to that of Germany and will
be able to follow up any threat he
makes in case of formal Interference on
the part of Emperor William's ships.
Within five days the authorities ex
pect that the second army expedition
will reach Manila. I understand that
troops forming the second expedition
will land at Cavite and put themselves
in readiness to attack Manila just as
soon as Major General Merrltt arrives
at his destination. It is expected he
will reach Manila Bay with the third
expedition about August 1.
HARDLY COMMENTED
UPON AT BERLIN
The Irene Incident Regarded as "a
Rumor Intended to Create
Bad Feeling."
LONDON, July 16.â The Berlin corre
spondent of the Times says: "The Irene in
cident is hardly commented upon here,
but the fact that no official denial is
forthcoming is worthy of note. The North
German Gazette declared that, so far as
it knew, no confirmation of the incident
has been received in official circles. The
National Gazette dismisses it as a 'rumor
intended to create bad feeling between
Germany and the United States.'
"The Vossische Zeitung recognizes the
importance of the fall of Santiago, but
emphasizes the fact that Cuba is in no
way lost to Spain, as Santiago is of 'no
strategic importance, now that Admiral
Cervera's squadron is destroyed."
"The military expert of the North Ger
man Gazette's staff suggests that it was
only the Spanish knowledge of the im
mense superiority of the American artil
lery which led to Santiago's capitulation."
the Americans was surprising. The
men sprang to their work with tremen
dous vigor. It was an important les
son, by which other nations may profit.
The dash and spirit displayed by the
Sixth and Sixteenth Infantry, which
came under my observation, was mar
velous. I never saw troops fight bet
ter."
ITALIAN SQUADRON IN
COLOMBIAN WATERS
Cerruti Claim Will Probably Be Set

Custom-House.
WASHINGTON, July 15.â The State De
partment has been Informed that the Ital
ian squadron, under Admiral CandianJ,
has reached Colombian waters prepara
tory to making a demand on the republic
of Colombia for the Immediate payment of
$250,000 awarded by President Cleveland to
Ernesto Cerruti, an Italian citizen. It Is
not known that the squadron hay as yet
made the demand or that any force to
execute It has been exerted. On the con
trary, the department has been officially
advised that the admiral's instructions
are confined to making a demand for tho
"complete and speedy settlement" of the
award made by the President of the
United States. His Instructions do not go
to the extent of directing him to seize the
custom house at Cartagena as was at
first reported. Although the admiral Is
now prepared to exert force, the impres
sion prevails that the settlement will be
reached without the actual display or
arms.
ROME, July 15.â Admiral Candiani. It Is
asserted, has been instructed to await tho
assembling of the Colombian Congress at
Bogota, on July 20. and the election of a
new President of Colombia before taking
any definite action with reference to en
forcing the Cerrutl claim.
THE CRUISER HARVARD
MAY BE QUARANTINED
Much Sickness Among Spanish Pris-
oners Brought From Santi
ago to Portsmouth.
PORTSMOUTH, N. EL, July 15.-The
auxiliary cruiser Harvard, having on
board 100S Spanish prisoners, arrived In
Portsmouth harbor this morning. The
port physician boarded the vessel, and In
company with the Spanish doctor made
an investigation. It disclosed the fact
that nearly half on board are ill. Six
Spaniards died on the passage from San
tiago to Portsmouth, another death oc
curred this afternoon and three patients
were not expected to live until night.
There were forty serious cases In the
sick bay and forty equally as bad in other
portions of the ship. All these patients
are said to be victims of malarial fever,
with which disease those who died were
affected. The physicians will make a
further inspection of the vessel and de
termine whether or not she shall be sent
to quarantine. Owing to these conditions
nothing has been done in the line of prep
aration for landing the prisoners.

NEGOTIATIONS
WITHOUT DELAY
Spain Proposes as a Basis Re

Cuba.
LONDON, July 16.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph
says: The Government has definitely
decided to open peace negotiations
without delay; proposing as a basis the
renunciation of all rights over Cuba
and the immediate discussion of any
other reasonable proposals the United
States may make. Informal negotia
tions for peace are continued.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Standard says: The Curlist agitation
is assuming proportions in many of the
northern provinces, which may serve
as a fresh argument for intervention
on the part of Germany. The civil and
military authorities, according to in
structions from Ministers of the Inte
rior and War, are closely watching the
movements of Cariist emissaries.
MADRID, July 15.â A decree of the
Captain General of Madrid, which has
been affixed to the walls of this city,
says decrees suspending the constitu
tional guarantees throughout the king
dom have been published, and, a state
of war existing, it is ordered that no
meetings take place without the previ

The decree concludes with specifying
the punishment which will be meted out
to those who disregard theorders is

The peace tendency is Increasing. The

The Minister for "War, General Cor-

: that he thought peace might be ar
ranged on the following terms:
The United States and Spain to
agree to let the Cubans decide by a
plebiscite whether they desire inde
pendence or autonomy under the suzer
ainty of Spain. The Governments to
agree to abide by. the result of the
plebiscite. In the event of the Cubans
voting for independence the United
| States to allow Spain nine months in
j which to withdraw her army, gradual
| ly and dignifiedly, from Cuba as sol
! diers should, after having fought like
heroes.
Continuing, the Minister for War
said: "We ought to retain Porto Rico
' at all costs, in order to be always near
J Cuba, of which the Americans will be
I able to despoil us in course of time,
! and in order to more easily communi-
I cate with the South American repub
lics, which daily display the greatest
enthusiasm for Spain.
"As to the Philippine Islands, it is
certain we will retain them, even
though the Americans succeed in oc
cupying Manila, of which place their
occupation will be most brief. An offi
cial dispatch announces that the rebel
chiefs and Americans will not always
agree, which is to Spain's advantage.
"The Government has formed a
scheme which will not only assure
Spain the possession of the Philippine
Islands, but which will restore their
tranquillity."
Premier Sagasta declares that neither
government in Cuba has interfered in
j the negotiations for the surrender of
j Santiago de Cuba. He adds that the
! surrender came within the province of

i bility, and the general simply an

TROUBLE WITH GERMANY
NOT ALL DUE TO WAR
Exclusion Decrees Against American
Products the Cause of Much
Friction.
NEW YORK, July 15.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: In addition
to the trouble relating to tne Philippines,
there is considerable friction between this
Government and Germany in relation to
the exclusion decrees of the German Gov
ernment directed against United States
products. It appears that, acting upon
very scant evidence, as it was regarded
by our officials, German customs officers
have denied admission Into Germany of a
very large and valuable consignment of
boned ham from a Chicago packing
establishment of highest reputation. The
matter has been placed in the hands of
Embassador White, he being thoroughly
familiar with all the aspects of the meat
exclusion decree. Vigorous correspond
ence has since been in progress.
FOUND DEAD IN BED.
Sudden Passing of a Newspaper Man
at Portland.
PORTLAND, July 15.-Frank M. Green,
a newspaper man aged 28, who came to
Portland from San Francisco, was found
dead in his room in the Imperial Hotel
this morning. Death had resulted from
paralysis of the heart and congestion of
the lungs.
Dr. Hamilton Meade knew Green in
Minneapolis seven years ago. Green, the
doctor said, had come to Portland from
San Francisco about a week ago and was
employed by an Eastern newspaper syn
dicate. He was sent to San Francisco to
write up the departure of the troops for
the Philippines and had been there since
Camp Merritt was established.
CHINESE STORES BURNED.
Conflagration Rages in the St. Helena
Chinatown.
9T HELENA, July 15.-Half of the local
Chinatown was destroyed by fire to-night,
causing a loss of about $8000. The fire
began in the joss house from an over
turned candle, and quickly spread to the
stores on the floor below. The Chinese
were dazed and made no effort to subdue
the flames, nor even to give, an alarm.
Finally, after six stores had been burned,
a volunteer fire brigade managed to check
the flames, which were confined to the
Mongolian district. The owners of the
buildings destroyed are Dr. T. E. Davis,
J. R. Logan and Frank Sciaroni.

and Three Rings.
The "Annex," a resort run In connec

corner of Ocean boulevard and B street,
was burglarized In a clever manner yes
terday morning. The burglars secured a
large quantity of liquor and three dia
mond rings which had been left in the
cash register.
Henry Doscher, the proprietor of tha
saloon, closed up about 12 o'clock Wednes
day night, and when the place was opened
at 6 the next morning it was discovered
that an entrance had been made through
one of the front windows. The burglars
had been very systematic in their work,
creating but little disturbance about tha
place. The putty on the window gla^s
had been carefully removed, the pane
taken out and laid on the ground without
breaking. After gaining an entrance tha
robbers took about twenty bottles of
whisky from the shelves and three dia
mond rings, which Fred Aldrich, the step
son of the proprietor, had left in the cash
register.
The police have been notified of tha
burglary, and as they suspect who fs re
sponsible for it the chances are the guilty
ones will soon be apprehended.MAJOR GENERAL OTIS AND
REGULAR TROOPS SAIL
THE event in the Eighth Army
Corps yesterday was the sailing
of the fourth expedition of troops
to the Philippines. An Incident,
attaining almost the dignity of
an event, was the moving of the New
York regiment from Camp Merritt to
the Presidio. From this tinâ forward
the Presidio will gain in Importance as
a military' station. Several regiments
are under ord rs to leave Camp Mer
ritt for the scene of operations in the
Orient and their departure will ma
terially diminish the size of that camp.
Meanwhile a pressure Is being exerted
to obtain authority to move the lowa
and Kansas regiments to the reserva
tion.
REGULARS SAIL
FOR THE ORIENT
Depnrture of the Peru and City
of Puebla With Troops of
Fourth Expedition.
The fleet of small craft out to pee the
transports away was not a large one. The
river steamer Alvlra was out with the
Red Cross and their friend?, the Grace
Rarton took a large crowd of excursion
ists, and the Millie also hud a crowd
aboard.
The State tug Governor Markham con
veyed the friends of the Harbor Commis
sioners, while the Governor Perkins had
the friends of the Hoard of Health. Sev
eral gasoline launches were out and all
were gay with bunting. The best dressed
boat In the bay was the red stack tug
Joseph 11. Redmond. It had on board a
party of friends of the directors of the
Shipowners' and Merchants' Towboat
Company.
About 1 p. m. Major General E. S. Otis,
Brigadier General 11. O. <>tis. Major Gen
eral Merriam and staff and a number of
Infantry officers boarded the quartermas
ter's boat. General McDowell, and wei t
out to the transports. At the Puebla
Major General Otis went aboard, after
saying good-by to bis friends on the
steamer. The McDowell then went over
to the Peru and back to the Puebla again.
A visit was paid the major general
aboard, and about 3 p. m. the transports
TOM GRANT OF THE NEW YORKERS
I 'tan to heave up anchor preparatory
to B start.
Into the teeth of a wind that was blow-
Ing a veritable pale from the west, the
transports Peru and the City of Puebla
passed through the Golden Gate shortly
after 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. ThÂ«
scenes attendant upon the departure of
the two vessels were similar to those that
have been witnessed when former expedi
tions have sailed away, and there was no
lack In the enthusiasm or cordiality with
which the departing were accorded a
royal good -by. It was a few minutes
after 3 o'clock when the shrieking 01
every whistle in the harbor and along the
water front announced the fact that the
ships had weighed anchor and were off
for their long voyage to the distant East.
The Peru led the way with the City of
I'uc-bla bringing up the rear a half a mile
tern, and with a number of small ves
sels escorting both. The latter turned
back when oft Black Point owing to the
roughness of the water. The bay was
covered with a mass of white caps, whila
off Fort Point and In the Golden Gate
the waves were running rough and high
Out beyond the Heads the sea was ex
ceedingly heavy, and when the vessels
left the choppy water of the bay and were
fairly out upon the Pacific, they began to
roll and plunge In a manner that indi
cated an alarming degree of "mm de
irer for the poor unfortunates aboard
There was an exceedingly large crowd
out to bid the soldiers and General ! OUs
oO iy and Rodspeed. From the Pacific
Mail dock to Black Point the water front
was lined with people, who cheered and
waved flags until the two vessels passed
and were lost to sight through the Golden
oate. The men aboard both vessels lined
the decks, climbed the masts and hung
out of the portholes to have a last
view of their native land. Between the
noise of the whistles and the cheers of the
people upon the shore the boys In blue
Bent back a wave of counter cheers that
could be heard even upon the top of Tele
graph Hill, despite the howling of thÂ«
wind. Those that had provided them
selves with flags waved them to their
friends upon land, while those that had
not the national ensign made their hats
Ferve the same purpose.
Many people went out upon tugs, and
for a while after the vessels left they
kept pace with them, but after rounding
the point at Telegraph Hill the smaller
craft began to fall behind until when Fort
Mason was reached the transports had
left the smaller vessels astern, and they
then turned back, blowing a last good-by
with their whistles.
From Aleatraz and Fort Mason salutes
were fired in honor of Major General Oils
and the men who have sailed under him.
The guns from the Island were the first
to begin, and as the Peru was passing, the
Iron dogs of war barked twelve times In
quick succession. The men acknowledged
the honor by cheering so loud that their
voices could be heard above the noise of
the guns. Ah the Peru breasted Black
Point the guns of Fort Mason took up the
salute begun at AJcatraz, and for fifteen
minutes the n6J*e of the whistles along
the shore was drowned by the deeper and
stronger reverberations of war. While the
City of Puebla passed the forts without a
palute being fired, the men upon this
vessel were cheered to the echo, and they
answered with a will that bespoke the
Intense determination in the heart of each
to ,Â°, , or die if that extremity need be to
uphold the honor of Old Glory.
Not only was the entire 'water front
lined with people, but the prominent
points of vantage In the city which com
mand a good view of the bay were nlso
crowded with persons. It was generally
remarked that an unusually large number
of ladles were out to see the vessels sail.
Many of th , ; gazed at the transports as
they glided through the water and said
not anything, for since the departure of
the First California" Regiment no expedi
tion has carried away bo many brave sol
diers who were native to the 'State The
majority of them are In the companies of
the Fourteenth Infantry and the Fourth
Cavalry. - ..- -
> After passing Fort Mason both vessels
bore across the bay toward Lime Point
In order to. take as much advantage as
possible of the smooth water caused by
that promontory. Then they headed
straight for the ocean and passed over the
bar and out of sight. The crowd lingered
until the ships had disappeared from view
and nothing more remained to he Keen,
and more than one turned with reluctance
anA with heavy hearts sought their homes
to hegln their long wait until news shall
come from the dear ones who have gone.
It was a noticeable fact that after the
vessels had started the City of Puebla
seemed to be making the greater head
way. She did not breast the point of Tel
egraph Hill until the Peru was a half
mile farther out, but then ft was Been
that she was slipping through the water
with greater ease and more speed, so that
when the transports reached tHe Golden
Gate the Puebla had closed up nearly half
the sap that separated her from the Peru.
So close were the vessels together at this
point that there is no doubt but that the
soldiers on one vessel could easily distin
guish friends on the other steamer.
The majority of those who witnessed
the departure of the vessels sought the
water front, and next to the Pacific Mail
dock the greatest crowd was upon Meiggs
wharf. Many hundreds of people congre
gated thero and tn the vicinity, and when
the ships hove In sight they did all in
their nower tn let those aboard know
that thoy were sorry to have them go.
Many of those on Meigps wharf shouted
messages to the boys in blue, all forgetful
that their voices were lost in the noise of
the whistles and th.> booming guns. In
numerable good wishes for success and
a safe return followed in the wake of
those two vessels as they sailed so brave
ly out of a friendly harbor, and one old
woman who stood among the crowd upon
the shore breathed a prayer so loud for
the return of her only son that those
about her heard it. and as if in respect
ror hrr sacrifice and sorrow drew apart
that sho might be alone with her thoughts
that were too sacred for intrusion All
that she asked, and she did no more than
hundreds of others, was that God would
be with her boy nnd bless him. and that
if !t was his will she prayed that ho
might be scared to return in safety and
health to gladden her declining years
Thus the fourth expedition sailed away
Into history and the distant Orient.
EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Colonel Henshaw Solves the
Problem of Draining the
Camp.
CAMP RARRETT. Bather Station. Ca!..
July 15.â Colonel Park Henshaw believes
he has solved the problem of camp sani
tation as far iis waste water from the
kitchens is concerned. When the regiment
went Into ramp a large catch ba^in was
dug in the center of the space south of
the line of company streets. A small
trench from each company's kitchen car
ried the waste water from the faucets.
but ft was discovered that the adobe
would not absorb it. and In a short time
the basin would be overflowing. Wells
w. re sunk to the gravel bed. and the
water will be turned Into them. It is be
lieved that the water will be carried off
In the gravel. If this falls, then connec
tion will be made with the Fruitvale
sewer. The sanitary condition of the camp
is all that could be desired.
A detail of men placed a flapnole in
front of Colonel Henshaw's quarters this
afternoon, and Old Glory was run up for
the first time. The detail saluted the flag
with three cheers after their work wan
completed. A*ter dress parade to-night
one of the companies marched to the col
ors and gave three cheers. The band
paraded at 7:30 o'clock and played
â â America" while the flag was lowered.
It will be raised at reveilleâ 5:20 o'clockâ
each morning hereafter, the band turning
out in force for the ceremony. Colonel
Henshaw will make application for a gun
to tire at sunrise ami sunset while the
regiment remains in camp, so as to have
the regular army ceremony.

to-day. 1p one of the b*>st ttu liclans !n
the regiment. While on duty this after
noon he approached the guard tent, but
no attention was paid to his movements.
Finally he called to the sr-ntry and asked:
"What is the matter with post No. 1?"
No answer was received until the third
summons, when the sentry replied:
"Nothing."
"Why don't you call out the guard?"
was the next question.
The guard was caught and stood look
ing on in wonderment. One of the ser
geants saw the trouble find, running to
the sentry, tolil him to call out the guard.
The sentry was unable to comprehend
the situation and stood motionless. Some
one else broke out with:
"Officer of the day. turn out the guard."
In a moment the men were in line, but
it took the young captain a half hour or
more to drill the guard In this duty. He
read them a strong lecture and advised
all to study up on guard duty before they
were again detailed for sentry service.

MORE BAD BACON.
Colonel B^-rry, Seventh Cali
fornia, Will Ask for a
Board of Survey.
There wns mutiny yesterday In the
ranks of the Seventh California, and for
good reason. The men of Company G got
up to a breakfast of bread and gravy,
and none too much of that. It was an
unstable diet for a crowd of husky men
of whom six hours' hard drilling was ex
pected, so the men flativ refused to go
out to drill until a fit meal should be
furnished them. After promises of full
rations and argument on the part of their
officers the men finally fell In and did
their duty as soldiers without further
complaint.
The reason for the troulle Is the vil
lainous bacon that has been issued by the
commiHsary department.
Colonel Berry last evening made re
quest upon Brigadier General Otis for a
board of survey, which will be detailed
to-day.

THIRTY-ONE YEARS IN THE GUARD.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL HORATIO POTTER STACPOLE, First
New York Volunteers.
Tall and as straight as an arrow, of a goodly six feet, nnd with a most soldier
ly and commanding appearance, Lieutenant Colonel Horatio Potter Staepole looks
every inch of him th.j soldier that he Is. Governor Black in appointing him to J.he
lieutenant colonelcy of the First New York regime*, paid but a fitting compli
ment to his thirty-one years of faithful service In the National Guard of his na
tive State. Colonel Btacpoie is 49 years of ape and was burn in Albany, N. V.,
where he has resided ever since. On the 6th of May, ISG7. he enlisted as a private
In Company B of the Tenth Battalion of Albany. Ten years later he was elected
captain of the same company and served In this capacity for fourteen years, when
he was chosen major of the famous battalion. He held this office when the war
broke out. but resigned it to accept the lieutenant colonelcy of the First New
York, inasmuch as the entire Tenth Battalion, composed of Companies A, B. C
and D, all of Albany, were selected by Governor Black to form the First Battalion
of the regiment now here. Colonel Staepole's connection with the National Guard
of New York has been a brilliant one. and to his own personal endeavors is largely
due the high state of efficiency of that guard. The Tenth Battalion Is considered
to be the finest military organization in the State. Company B was organized in
1554, Company A in 1880 and companies C and D shortly afterward. During the
war the Tenth Battalion was known as the One Hundred and Seventy-seventh
Volunteers, of the Tenth Regiment, but resumed Its old name after being mus
tered out of the service, ami Colonel Btacpoie declares that if the four companies
are spared to return to their native State they will again ba known as the
famous and reliable Tenth Battalion of Albany.
prevent a spread of the two or three Infec
tious diseases that are constantly being
found in one corner or another of the
camp. Typhoid fever claimed another
victim yesterday in Private Zeb Stafford
of Company C, First Tennessee, who died
at the Marine Hospital.
To preclude a possibility of any spread
of diseases among soldiers or civilians.
General Miller yesterday issued the fol
lowing rigid order. It excepts no one:
General Order No. 2.
Pursuant to recommendation of chief sur
geon. Independent Division, Kiphth Army
Corps, nil persons, whether officers, enlisted
men or citizens, not connected with the Hos
pital Corps of this command are prohibited
from entering any of the hospitals within this
command without first procuring a written
consent of the commanding officer of the regi
ment or detachment, or of the surgeon In
charge of the hospital. Consent to visit hos
pitals will be granted only for urgent reasons.
By command of
BRIGADIER GENERAL MILLER.
In a day or so another order will issue,
requiring regimental surgeons who wish
to send men to outside hospitals to send
them first to the division hospital. This
order is necessary so that the records
may bo kept complete. A number of cases
have arisen where, all trace of men from
different regiments has been lost for a
week at a time, through their having been
rushed off to one or the other of the nu
merous hospitals.
Major Owens of the division hospital has
received word that his requisition for a
1200-bed hospital and medical supplies
had been approved at Washington. He
â will immediately begin putting: matters in
shape for the Philippine*. His equipment
and supply are based on vi sick rate of 10
per cent., the. pro rata required by British
army regulations in the Indian service.
Private Bartlett of the Twentieth Kan
sas, who died on Wednesday from spinal
meningitis, was interred yesterday in the
Presidio plat.
Private Albert Stowell of the Seventh
California died at the French Hospital
yesterday after several days of suffering
from pneumonia.
Woodland Recruiting Office.
A recruiting office for the regular army
will be established rff Woodland to-day.
The office will be opened by First Lleu
tenant Delamere Skerrett, Third United
States Artillery, and all applicants who
are able to pass the mental and physical
examination will be readily accepted. The
Third Artillery is one of the best regi
ments of the army, and will soon be re
cruited up to the maximum strength
under the law. The grade of the service
is high and the standing of this particu
lar regiment is not excelled.
EIGHTH ARMY CORPS.
Plans of Sailing Changedâ The
Steamers Not Required to
Sail in Squadron.
Orders left by Major General Otis yes
terday materially change the original
plans for dispatching the fifth Philippine
expedition.
Instead of sailing as a flotilla on or
about the 25th, the boats will sail Inde
pendently and just as soon as they can be
loaded.
The Pennsylvania, carrying the First
Montana and recruits of the First Cali
fornia, will get away on Monday. Colonel
Kessler will have his heavy equipment
loaded aboard to-day, and exiects to
break camp on Sunday, possibly not until
Monday morning.
Pursuant to orders from General Miller,
he yesterday detailed Quartermaster Sea
dorf and Lieutenant Knowlton to take
charge of the quartermaster's and com
missary's departments, and detailed Ser
geant Klpley and six privates to guard the
steamer.
Colonel Frost, with two battalions of
the First South Dakota Volunteers, ex
pects to get away on Tuesday on the Rio
de Janiero. Lieutenant Murray and Lieu
tenant Horting. quartermaster and com
missary, will begin loading heavy stuff to
day. Sergeant Dool'.ttle and six privates
have been detached to guard the vessel.
ATTORNEYS ACCUSED
OF SHARP PRACTICE
J. J. GUILFOYLE AND B. HAS
KELL IN BAD ODOR.
They Entered a Dismissal to a Suit
in Violation of an Order Made
by Judge Hunt.
Although the amount Involved in the
litigation over a one-quarter Interest In
the schooner "Christina Steffens," in
which Dietrich Poll appears of record as
plaintiff, and R. A. Gilbridge as defend
ant, is not large enough to startle a capi
talist, the attorneys in the case appear to
have, taken too great an interest.
Two of them, in consequence, Haskell
and J. J. Gullfoyle Jr., are in bad odor
in Judge Hunt's department of the Supe
rior Court and, in the mind of the court,
are guilty of "sharp practice."
Attorney Andrew Thome originally rep
resented the plaintiff. Last Friday Has
kell, who represents the defendant, ap
peared in court and stated that he had
an affidavit which he wished to tile charg
ing Thorne with dereliction of duty.
Thorne immediately demanded that the
affidavit be filed, much to the surprise of
Haskell, and in consequence the latter be
gan to wilt. No demand made by Thorne
was obeyed and he called upon the court
to compel Haskell to make good his
charges. Haskell still refused, and the
court exonerated Thorne and sarcastical
ly touched Haskell up for his backdown.
Yesterday Haskell appeared in court
with the plaintiff, Poll, and Attorney Guil
foyle, and on the motion of Poll, Guil
foyle was substituted as his attorney in
place of Thorne. In making the order
substituting the attorneys, however,
Judpo Hunt remarked that it looked like
an effort to deprive Thorne of his fee. In
order to defeat such a purpose the court
made an entry on the order stating that
no dismissal of tho action should be en
tered or filed and that all proceedings
should be stayed. Notwithstanding the
order of the court, Guilfoyle and Haskell
went to the County Clerk's office and en
tered a dismissal of the action. The fact
was discovered by Ambrose Watson,
clerk of Judge Hunt's court, and he in
formed tho court. Judge Hunt immediate
ly ordered the entry of dismissal canceled
and the papers returned to the attorneys.
This was done, but the end is not yet.
In all probability the lawyers will be call
ed to time for the flagrant disregard to
the order of court made in their presence.
HORSESHOERS WILL MEET.
Officers of Mechanics' Athletic
Union Preparing for the Forth
coming Tournament.
Preparations are being actively pressed
for the opening meeting of the Mechan
ics' Athletic Union at Central Park on
July 31.
From present indications the new or
ganization will be ushered into existence
in an auspicious fashion. The initial con
test will be in the form of a mammoth
horse-shoeing tournament, the first event
of its kind to be held in America, or, for
that matter, nny place in the world.
Turning contests have been held before
where prizes were given for the best
horseshoe turned out in the shortest
space of time, but races wherein not only
are the shoes turned out of the solid bar
but fitted to a horse as well, will be first
produced at the coming tournament at
Central Park.
The event Is already attracting great
interest among the army of local horse
shoers us well as among the many
knights of the anvil in several of the in
terior cities. Yesterday President Miller
received the first batch of entries, the en
try blanks having but just been issued.
Among these were three of the most not
ed horscshoers in the cityâ Frank and
Thomas O'Rmirke and Albert Draeger.
Frank O'Rourke is looked upon as the
most likely candidate for championship
honors, as in thÂ« opinion of the knowing
ones there Is no better or quicker per
former in the business than he.
Thomas O'Rourke, the youngest man in
the tournament, is one of the speediest
shoe.rs in the city.
Albert Draeger has already won many
honors in competition, especially In turn
ing out horseshoes. He won the eham
uionship of Germany and later at the
World's Fair in Chicago was awarded the
etttd medal. This was followed by a slm
11 Vr medal at the Midwinter Fair in this
city. He has won two medals at the Me
chanics' Fair.
WOMEN TIBED OF LIFE.
Mrs. Catherine Hoff and Dora
Heaney Attempt Suicide by
Different Boutes.
Two women, one married and the other
single, were taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal yesterday for treatment, after having
attempted to end their existence, owing to
despondency. Both will recover.
Mrs. Catherine Hoff went to 920 Central
avenue Thursday to do some work. Yes
terday morning she was discovered un
conscious in bed with the gas turned on.
At the hospital the usual remedies were
applied and she was soon pronounced out
of danger. She said her husband, Robert
Hoff, a carpenter, had left her in April
last and was now in Tulare County. She
had been forced to work for a living, ana
becoming despondent, thought it better to
die She has a child in Mount St. Joseph
Orphan Asylum, and, in the care of
friends, a daughter, 9 years of age, by a
former husband.
Dora Heant-y is only 17 years old, but
yesterday afternoon she sought to end her
life by swallowing a dose of strychnine.
She had been living with a friend, Mrs.
Hanson, at 2 Brennan Place. The only
reason she would give for her foolish act
was that some one called her a bad name,
which made her despondent. She was em
ployed at the Pacific Metal Works, but
lost her job. Her father and mother are
Lieutenant Colonel Lee Stover will fol
low some days later with the remaining
Dakota battalion, sailing on the St. Paul.
The men of the two regiments are in
splendid physical condition and in fine
fettle for a right or anything else in the
way of trouble. At Camp Merritt they
are the envied of the whole camp. The
Seventh California particularly Is blue.
Though they are resolved to be good sol
diers and do no kicking, it is impossible
for the officers and men of the Seventh
to conceal their disappointment. Splen
didly equipped, well drilled and finely set
up. they have been compelled to sit on
their own little sand heap and watch four
expeditions sail through the Gate. They
were the second command to come into
camp, and they declare now that they
have given up every hope of getting
away. "That's why there is no glad
smile in the camp of the Seventh," as
Adjutant Alphonso puts it.
The Twentieth Kansas Volunteers yes
terday moved their camp to the lot va
cated by the New Yorkers. Surgeon
Rafter of the Twentieth Kansas con
demned his camp the other day. and Col
onel Funston requested permission to
move his camp to the Presidio. New
York got the plum, and Kansas must con
tent itself with a change in sand heaps.
MOVED TO THE PRESIDIO.
New York Regiment Is Now
Located on the Plain West
of Camp Miller.
The First Regiment of New York Volun
teers marched in a body yesterday morn
ing from Camp Merritt over to the Presi
dio, where they are now encamped. Tho
afternoon was spent in erecting the tents,
and by evening the camp, which is located
west of Camp Miller, was in fair shape.
The camp work will be completed to-day.
The New Yorkers are very much pleased
dead, but she has a married sister in thÂ«
city.
COST OF REPRODUCTION.
Expert Curtis Still Testifying in the
Big Railroad Case.
The cross-examination of Kxpert Cur
tis In the case of the Southern Pacific
Company against the Board of Railroad
Commissioners, before Commissioner in
Chancery Heacock, was resumed yester
day in the apartments of Mr. Hayne in
the Parrott building. Most of the Inquiry
was with reference to the rails on the
main and side tracks of all the roads of
the system in this State. Expert Curtis
testified that there are still seventy miles
of the original iron rails In use on the
main line and the remainder are steel,
fifty-four pounds to the yard. The rails
on the sidings had been used on the main
lines, and where steel is used it is lighter
than that of the main tracks. He said
that the steel rails in this city cost $32
per ton and the cost of reproduction on
the main tracks and seconds runs up to
85.51 tons per mile, and that the sidings
amount to 28.58 tons per mile. The for
mer cost $3222 58 and the latter $771 18 per
mile.
He also testified that the engineering,
incidental and contingent expenses
amounted to $3200 85 per mile, or $10,000,000
for the whole road. Mr. Curtis was
questioned in regard to the general and
legal expenses of the reproduction. The
purpose of this line of inquiry is to as
certain the expense of reproduction of
the tracks of the company in this State.
NEGLECTED HIS FAMILY.
Mrs. Olive V. Barnard, wife of Frank
Barnard, a well-known coal dealer, whose
place of business is at 609 Battery street,
filed suit for divorce yesterday. Mrs.
Barnard alleges as a cause of complaint
that her husband has failed to provide
her with the common necessities of life.
The married lot of the couple seems to
have been a most unhappy one. Mrs.
Barnard alleges that shortly after the
marriage, which occurred on April 17,
1595. her husband began to neglect her
and, not a great time later, failed to pro
vide for her. The plaintiff is at a loss to
assign a cause for her husband's action.
Every request of hers Â£or aid was denied,
although her husband is in receipt of $250
a month or more. Mrs. Barnard states
that thi>re is no community property and
asks the court to grant her suitable ali
mony.

MRS. IDA L FLOOD
GRANTED A DIVORCE
SPEEDY TERMINATION OF A
SUIT FILED THURSDAY.
Plaintiff's Charges of Cruelty Well
Founded â Division of Property
Rights Arranged.
The marital troubles that have long ex
isted between Dr. Philip H. Flood and his
wife, Ida L. Flood, terminated yesterday.
Thursday afternoon Mrs. Flood filed suit
against her husband for divorce, setting
forth many specific acts of cruelty, upon
which the action was based. The case
came up before Judge Troutt yesterday
morning, and in less than twenty-four
hours from the filing of the suit a de
cree had been granted.
Dr. Flood did not make answer to hla
â wife's charges. A written appearance,
handed to the court by George D. Shad
burne, was de< mcd sufficient. Flood did
not intend to contest the case, and Mr.
Shadburne, who represented the defend
ant, stated that he had no evidence to in
troduce, but simply wished to be apprised
of the nature of the evidence to be in
troduced by the plaintiff in substantia
tion of her allegations. Mr. Shadburne
was not disappointed. Mrs. Flood was
put upon the stand, and told again of
her unhappy life as the wife of Dr.
Flood; how he had abused her and driven
her from his home in fear. '
Mrs. Mary Ennes and Mrs. J. Frat
tinger were also placed upon the stand
on behalf of the plaintiff. The witnesses
corroborated the statements of. Mrs.
Flood, and when their testimoy had been
Introduced the case was submitted. Judge
Troutt immediately entered a decree
granting Mrs. Flood a divorce from her
husband on the ground of extreme
cruelty.
The division of the property of the liti
gants was arranged amicably. A short
time ago Dr. Flood conveyed certain val
uable real estate to Mrs. Flood, and this
the court verified. Property of greater
value, however, will be conveyed, but just
where It is situated will not be known un
til a stipulation has been placed on file.

EVADING TriE WAR TAX.
THAT corporations should be evading the war
tax is to be regretted on more than one ground.
That the Wells- Fargo Express Company should
be among the flagrant offenders is a matter for sur
prise. As a corporation, it has always been liberal.
It has seemed to appreciate the fact that it enjoys
the protection of the Government. Yet, when there
is pressing need of revenue, this corporation sneaks
with the rest, and tries to make somcoody else pay
the tax Congress has laid upon it. The clause of
the war revenue bill governing the matter is so clear
that it is here given:
"It shall be the duty of every railroad or steamboat
company, carrier, express company, or corporation
or person whose occupation is to act as such, to issue
to the shipper or consignor, or his agent, or person
from whom any goods are accepted for transporta
tion, a bill of lading, manifest, or other evidence of
receipt and forwarding for each shipment received
for carriage and transportation, whetner in bulk or
in boxes, bales, packages, bundles, or not so enclosed
or included; and there shall be duly attached and
canceled, as in this act provided, to each of such bills
of lading, manifests or other memorandum, and to
each duplicate thereof, a stamp to the value of I
cent/
The war tax was so devised as to reach people in
every walk of life. It was intended, and with entire
justice, that each citizen, according to his means or
his occupation, should contribute to the common
cause. To submit without grumbling was the sim
luty, a course suggested by jÂ»atriotism and a
sense of fairness. It had not been expected that
tho>e most able to pay would shift the responsibility.
Vei this is exactly what the Wells-Fargo Company
is attempting to do. It forces its patrons to pay
that which it should itself pay, as the law provides,
and equity demands.
The corporation under consideration has in this city
its principal place of business. Most of its stock is
held at the East. The profits conic out of Cali
fornia, and, in great measure, go to people living far
away. J. J. Valentine is the president. He doubt
less knows that an imposition is being practiced, and
he does not prevent it. Instead of doing so he
would put the blame for the ungenerous and repre
hensible course of the corporation upon the vice
president, a resident of New York. In words apt
and familiar, this is too thin. The wicked partner
business has been worked to death. Mr. Valentine
cannot permit a subordinate to override him and then
assert that the fault is something the burden of which
does not rest with himself.
Plainly enough the provisions set forth that the
express company shall supply the stamps, and there
is no hint that it can make the patrons of the concern
pay for the stamps. Yet Wells-Fargo, after ex
acting the regular tariff, charge the price of the stamp
for which the Government has said it must pay.
This borders on theft, and is wholly indefensible.
The patron has already paid the extra tax. He has
paid it on wine, tobacco, chewing gum, the daily
checks he has written; on necessities and luxuries of
all sorts. The law was not framed to strike him and
permit the fat and prosperous corporation not only
to escape the payment, but actually to exact from him
the money it should advance without question or
demur. He will not submit. He is willing to be
good for his share. He objects to robbery for the
benefit of a protected and powerful corporation.
For the sake of its fair fame, Wells-Fargo should
desist. It is injuring itself, irritating the people, and
lending to the denunciation of agitators the shadow
of justification. It is such exhibitions of arrogant
superiority that cause corporations to be hated, an
archists to rant, and Coxey armies to spring into ex
istence. The Wells-Fargo Company is recreant to
the country from which it gains support, under whose
statutes it finds opportunity to do an immense busi
ness. It refuses to pay a just and reasonable tax
made necessary by war with a foreign foe. Yet this
war has brought to it thousands of dollars of reve
nue. The company has carried tons of powder and
munitions at the high rates charged for such ma
terial. To pay the tax would be but the relinquish
ment of a fraction of added profit. The Wells-Fargo
Company extorts money from private citizens, not
under the pretense of having a right to do so, but
because it can. It deserves the severest rebuke,
prompt awakening to the limitation of its thrifty ar
rogance, and official information that it must pay its
share or be haled into court like the small offender.
But, regardless of fines, very shame should force it
in this instance to the honest and fair methods by
which it has heretofore been guided.
Pugilism might as well acknowledge Itself dead.
The only fighter this country cares about now is the
one who carries a rifle and commits comparatively
little havoc with his jaw.
Sampson and Schley can afford to divide the glory
in the middle and would have glory to spare then.
THE HAWAIIAN COMMISSION.
IT is proposed that the Chamber of Commerce en
tertain the members of the Hawaiian Commission
at they pass through this city en route to Hono
lulu.
This is welL CaJifornia hospitality Is of world-wide
repute, and its established reputation should be sus
tained.
The members of the commission all favored the
policy which, when accomplished, has given them the
position they hold. They do not come to us needy.
A large sum is appropriated out of the public treasury
for their benefit. The tendering of public hospitality
to them should have among its objects an impression
of the interest of California in the work they have on
hand.
The three American Commissioners, Cullom, Hitt
and Morgan, are in an environment which prevents
experimental knowledge of the industrial problem
which is presented in Asiatic coolie competition with
white labor.
Frceport, the principal town in Mr. Hitt's district,
probably never saw an Asiatic coolie even in transit,
for it lies off the trunk line for Pacific Coast travel.
In Senator Cullom's town, Springfield, there is one
Chinese washhouse, but its principal patrons are ne
groes and its competition is not felt. As for Senator
Morgan, environment and experience count for noth
ing, and none of them will get any knowledge of our
labor situation at a banquet which will be devoted to
gush and boasting. Will some one tell them that
California asks something for all that she gives?
She is even denied the right to have one of her regi
ments sent to Hawaii on garrison duty. That is
given to New York, and soldiers are transported 3500
miles across the continent to go to Honolulu, while
California troops rest in camp or are shipped to hard
duty and death in the poison fens of the Philippines.
As the matter now stands, California is called to make
all the sacrifices required for the benefit of Hawaii
and gets nothing in return. These Commissioners
should be told that we want something.
We demand the prohibition of all
| Asiatic coolie immigration to flflavrnii.
We demand the deportation of all
coolie labor vow in the island*.
We demand the extension thereto of the
labor law* of this country, with the
eight-hour day.
We demand that the sugar planter of
Hawaii be put on an equality with the
sugar planter of California.
The interests involved are not felt in Illinois, which
State has two members of this commission, nor in
Alabama, which has one member. They are inter
ests as to which Hawaii, with two members of the
commission, destructively antagonizes California,
with no member at all.
We have been delivered over, bound hand and foot,
to our competitors who live on coolie labor. But
while we are bound we are not gagged, and therefore
should not leave our demands unvoiced. Much has
been said about coolie competition in manufactures.
Unless the coolies in Hawaii are deported we will see
that competition set up in Honolulu under the Ameri
can flag and the American tariff. The opportunity to
do this is one reason why Mr. Thurston thinks
Hawaii an excellent place for men with money. Cali
fornia demands that men with money be put on an
equality as to the wages they pay to labor, here and
in Hawaii.
SINGLE TAX AN ISSUE.
THE attitude Judge Maguire is bound to assume
in this campaign will, we think, finally stamp
him as an office-seeking politician without prin
ciples or convictions. On his behalf his organ an
nounces that his acceptance of the gubernatorial nom
ination of the Populists does not make him a Popu
list. "It is seldom," says the $30,000 railroad con
tract sheet, "that a party goes out of its own ranks
to find a candidate for its most important nomina
tion." And then it adds, in order to clinch the idea:
"Mr. Maguire is a Democrat, and not a Populist, and
if he accepts the nomination it will doubtless be as a
Democrat."
The political morality disclosed by the policy out
lined â the acceptance of a party nomination with a
repudiation of the party â is not likely to strengthen
Judge Maguire in the estimation of intelligent people,
nor make him votes among such Populists as are not
entirely devoted to conferring a fat and influential office
upon a Democrat. But if Maguire is a Democrat he
will conduct a Democratic and not a Populist govern
ment. Therefore, in nominating him, the Populists
have placed a political enemy at the head of their
ticket who will do what he can, should they elect
him. to destroy their party.
But all this concerns the machine and not the peo
ple. The real test of Judge Mag.uire's sincerity, and
the one by which he will be estimated among non
machine voters, is the platform he will be compelled
to indorse when he accepts the Populist nomination
for Governor. In this platform, unless we are mis
taken, will be found the evidences of his office
seeking propensities already referred to. Prior to
his nomination Maguire telegraphed the delegates
that the Oregon fusion platform would suit him. The
platform adopted at Sacramento is not the Oregon
'fusion platform, though in some respects there
is a resemblance between the two. The Oregon plat
form does not indorse the single tax theory; neither
does it declare in favor of any other theory. The
Sacramento platform squints at single tax and at the
same time indorses a new theory which is entirely at
variance with anything Judge Maeruire has ever pro
posed or advocated. What could be more definite
and indefinite than this:
We demand a reform In our system of taxation,
to the end that taxes shall so be laid as to secure
as far as possible equality of sacrifice. We favor
the repeal of all poll taxes and demand exemption
from taxation of small homesteads and personal
property, the amount to be fixed by the Legislature.
We also favor a graduated State, Income and Inher
itance tax. We also favor the submission to the
people of a constitutional amendment which will
give to counties and municipal corporations the
right to adopt such a system of taxation for local
purposes as the people of such locality may desire.
Judge Maguire has already told the Oregon Popu
lists that the single tax theory is the great issue of
the day; that until it is put into practice the masses
will never escape the thralldom of the classes. He has
also written the Democrats of California that single
taxation is not an issue of this campaign â that the
time is not ripe for an agitation looking to placing
all taxes upon land, and that he will not attempt any-"
thing of the kind should he be elected Governor. In
view of these declarations, what does the plank above
quoted mean?
It is well known that local option taxation is a
single tax method of achieving results. The exemp
tion of personal property â bonds, notes, money,
horses, carriages, works of art, silks and satins â is
another method the single taxers adopt for reaching
the ultimate taxation of lands alone. Henry George
did not favor income taxes, but Maguire has done
so; whether, however, as an amendment to thÂ«
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, JULY 16, 1898.
theory or as a temporary expedient nobody knows.
If Maguire accept the nomination of the Populists he
will have to indorse this plank. The platform con
cludes by saying: "And to the support of this plat
form we pledge each and every candidate nominated
by this convention." Furthermore, if Maguire ac
cept the Populist nomination and the Democrats in
dorse him they will indorse this part of the Populist
platform. Thus the Democracy will, in addition to
becoming a Maguire party, become a single tax party.
So after all single taxation is an issue. How do the
owners of land in California like that?
THE FREE-MARKET EXPERIMENT.
BY the adoption of a resolution setting aside the
Jackson, Washington and Clay street wharves
for the use of a free market for perishable
products coming into San Francisco the Harbor
Commissioners have afforded a foundation for the
most important experiment that has been undertaken
in this city for a long time. The results of the move
ment will be watched with close interest, for they will
not only affect large and powerful interests, but will
in a marked degree concern the people at large.
As was set forth in the report of the free market
committee of the Producers' Association, the object of
the free market movement is not alone to provide
some special facilities for farmers to sell their own
products, but to concentrate the entire trade from first
hands in perishable products upon the water front,
separate it from all other trade, subject it to regula
tion by State authority, give to farmers desiring to
sell their own produce equal advantages with those
preferring to sell through commission men, and per
mit any one to buy there who so desires.
A committee, composed of Major Harney of the
Harbor Commission and E. F. Adams as a represen
tative of the producers, was appointed to formulate
regulations to govern the proposed market. It is
needless to say that the work to be done by this
committee will largely determine the success or fail
ure of the proposed enterprise. If rules can be
adopted which will assure the transaction of the per
ishable product trade at the market under conditions
that will yield to the producer better returns from his
product than he receives under the existing system,
the great plan will succeed beyond doubt. If, how
ever, the producer does not obtain that benefit it will
r it be possible to make the free market a perma
nent institution of the city.
The undertaking is so full of promise to all con
cerned there will be a well nigh universal hope for
its success. The present method of handling fruit and
vegetables entails a vast waste of such products, im
poses a heavy cost upon consumers of them, and
yields a small and insufficient return to the growers.
There have been times when hundreds of pounds of
good fruits and foods were thrown into the bay for
a lack of a market for them, while at the same time
hundreds of families in the city would have been glad
to purchase them at fair prices. The producer and
the consumer have, in fact, both suffered to a large
extent from the lack of closer relations to one an
other, and this loss may be eliminated to a consider
able extent by the free market.
Bright as are the expectations raised by an enter
prise that promises so much of good to both con
sumers and producers, while at the same time carry
ing a benefit to honest middlemen also by ridding
them from the unscrupulous competition of more or
less dishonest dealers, it is not to be overlooked that
many obstacles are in the way of the successful ac-
complishment of the plan. An oversanguine expec
t?tion now may lead to a disappointment that might
cause a hasty conclusion that the scheme is imprac
ticable. The free market, having been launched,
should be given a thorough and a prolonged trial be
fore it is condemned, even if at first its machinery
should not work well. It has been undertaken for
the general welfare and should in its operations have
the support of all.
MONKEYING W!Th| FATHER TIME.
T"HE excellent lady who in rhythmic pathos pe
titioned Time to turn backward in his. flight
probably did so under the impulse of poesy and
without an idea that Time would do anything of the
sort. The Examiner is different. When it wants
Time to jump backward, forward or sidewise it does
not ask his consent, but makes him jump.
Santiago fell at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, General
Shatter thinks. The Examiner boasts that it bul
letined the information at 11 o'clock in the morning.
How it could have done this without going into the
realm of prophecy, where it has often been before to
its damage, is a little hard to figure out. There is the
easy slid natural solution that it has lied some more,
but as a matter of fact the bulletin was in evidence
with the promptness claimed for it. It was on dis
play announcing an event which had not yet occurred,
and the transgressor has the pleasing nerve to brag
about the deception.
Ths difference in time between Santiago and San
Francisco is 3 hours 6 minutes and 6.58 seconds. To
.simplify matters let this difference be regarded for the
present as exactly three hours. Then at Santiago's
3 o'clock San Francisco was hearing the stroke of
high noon. But, taking into account the parts of the
hour, at Santiago's 3 o'clock it was in San Francisco
precisely 53 minutes 53.02 seconds past 11. This is
near enough 54 minutes to be considered as really so.
When time is being monkeyed with we can afford
for convenience to throw aside the small fraction of
a minute. In other words, the Examiner bulletined
the fall of Santiago 54 minutes before Santiago had
fallen. There must be on the staff the seventh son of
a seventh son of a gun, both born with a caul, seeing
visions and dreaming dreams.
As to the message from Santiago, there were neces
sarily delays. These calculations have been made
without considering this possibility. It is hardly
reasonable to suppose that the news was on the wire
as soon as it reached the understanding of those who
beheld the white 'flag, or that in the vicissitudes of
transmission it did not experience an occasional de
lay. Yet we give to the Examiner the benefit of the
dcubt. If the news was an hour in reaching this
country, instead of coming as in the twinkling of an
eye, the Examiner lie gains in magnitude. We do not
press the point. Toward the erring and representa
tives of the genus Mephitis humane instincts counsel
kindly correction rather than rude buffets. There is
no hope of reforming the Examiner, but it might be
taught to work out its fabrications on a mathematical
basis and thus once in a while escape exposure.
If we have misjudged the yellow sheet in this In
stance there will be no hesitancy in saying so later.
We think it lied, and thus frankly affirm; but per
haps Hearst sneaked up on the beleaguered city and,
together with Headsman Lairyc, took it himself, thus
scoring a scoop on the American army and laying the
foundation for acquitting his bulletin board of having
been too soon.
Sagasta must be a queer old man. He laments
thus: "Had we our fleet the situation would be very
different." Well they had a fleet once, and all they
managed to do with it was to get it in front of some
big guns. However, there is no doubt, as Sagasta
observes in effect, that if things were not the same a
variation might be noted.

His friends know that this occupation is
remunerative and they do all they can to
steer the Europe-bound passenger in the

his breath leaving his lungs in panting ex

promised Fugazi a bundle of prospective

at the palms to pack that bundle off. Fu

Where was that trifler Stateler and wh>

mental churnlngs, the telephone bell rang
and Fugazi was called to the phone.
Stateler had called him up. This is the
way the negotiations went:
Stateler: "Hello, Fugazi. I have the

must divvy up on the commission propo

I guess It will have to be. All right, I
will give you a half. Now tell me, Statty,

THE OLD ARMY HARDTACK
How dear to my heart are the war-time me

In the days when I tramped through the du9t
of Virginia,
Or splashed through its mud with the rest of
the boys;
There' 8 a rusty old saber I never will part
with,
A faded old cap and a Jacket of blue,
A battered canteen and a haversack holding
Some squares of tha hardtack we all had to
chew !
The iron-bound hardtack!
The moss-covered hardtack!
The old army hardtack we all had to chew!
There was hardtack from wars of a part gen

Which remained unconsumed till about '63:
It was rumored that some, which defied masti
cation.
Was marked "Vem Cruz" or was lettered
"B. C."
What a triumph Was this for the skill of the
baker!
Indestructible product, defying time's tooth!
But it could not resist the assaults of our

The grinders we had in the days of our youth.
Tin- Blinker Hill hardtack!
The ISI2 hardtack!
The old army hardtack we ate in our youth!
Oh! youth can make feasts of the coarsest of

And never apaln shall wp veterans feel
Such a zest In our lives as 'way back in the

When hardtack sufficed to create a "square"
meal.
Though now we may dine at more sumptuous
tables.
We'd gladly exchange all the dainties they
yield
For the hearty enjoyment, the youthful diges

That seasoned the hardtack we ate in the

WHY P JNISH THE NAVY?
The Introduction of a bill restoring the
grade of lieutenant general invites again
an inquiry into the discrimination which
Congress seems so persistently to make
against the navy. If a lieutenant general,
why not a vice-admiral, and if, as report
ed, this great official honor is to be held
open for the officer most distinguished la
land operations, why should an equal in
centive not be given the sea officers in
trusted with the fortunes of the fleet?
No reward can be too great for our suc
cessful officers, but, above all, let there
be fair play. At this moment the navy
is asking Congress to make its pay equal,
grade for grade, to that given the army.
Many sinister rumors are afloat that this
bill will pass the House, but be killed" in
the Senate. This will be a grievous wrong,
and will send our seamen into battle no
less loyal or courageous, but with the
galling certainty that after all republics
can be ungrateful. â New York Herald.

B. Steinauer, proprietor of the Eastern
Hotel at 435 Pine street, had a narrow
pÂ« from instant death yesterday
morning. He purchased the hotel about
Fix months ago and a few weeks ago he
started to have the entire building fixed
up. He stepped out on the staging op
posite the fourth floor to see how the
painters were getting along, and mak
ing a misstep fell to the sidewalk. ii<.

AND HER SISTER SMASHED HER.
Tried to Steal Her Husband, So Mrs. John Frace
Administers Punishment,
Two souls with but a single thought and two hearts that beat for the
same one (masculine gender), were the romantic causes of a most unromafitlc
encounter on Ellis street just below Hyde, on Wednesday afternoon.
At precisely 4 o'clock Mrs. Fraca, the wife of the handsome custom house
officer, John Frace, faced her sister, Miss Tillle Degener, and without engag
ing in any preliminary sparring, led out with one lily-white hand, gaining a
hammer-lock hold on her victim's fluffy golden tresses. Then with the dis
engaged right she landed a stiff uppercut on the "point," disabling her an
tagonist and sending her to earth.
In a spirit of unsatisfied fiendish vengeance and with a most flagrant dis
regard of the rules approved by the Marquis of Queensberry and accepted by
all votaries of the manly art, Mrs. Frace continued to administer punish
ment to her fallen sister, who was flushing the Ellis-street drains with a
rich gore that flowed from a dainty Grecian nose.
A broken hatpin also played a conspicuous role in the scrimmage, which
would have been prolonged beyond the usual number of rounds had not a
young gallant who viewed the fracas from the platform of a passing car
come to the rescue of the hapless damsel.
Mrs. Frace went into the fight with a wrong to avenga. She claims that
her sister was trying, and not unsuccessfully, to win from her the affections
of her husband.
Miss Degener affirms that these charges are the veriest nonsense evolved
from a mind diseased.
Tillie Degener is an unusually pretty girl and resides with her parents at
207 Gough street. She is about IS years old and looks out on this wicked
world with a pair of deep blue orbs that by a strange freak at times show
black and again a catty gray. A wealth of fluffy golden hair frames a spir-
Ituelle face, in which the lily and rosb play at hide and seek. A good square
chin shows that Miss Tillie is not wanting in determination.
"My sister's mind is unbalaced," Miss Degener said, when called upon to +
explain her sister's conduct. "John Frace ie an old man, past 40, and I +â 
wouldn't have him. I had nnt seen my sister for many months when I called +
upon her Wednesday afternoon. She met me at the door. Her conduct was +
most strange. 'You know who I am,' she said to me, "you know who you +
are,' and then she extended her left hand and pointing to her wedding ring +
said in a most awful tone: 'See!' Thereupon she gave me a dreadful look +
and before I could move out of her way she had me by the throat and threw +
me down the stairs and flat upon the Bidewalk. She also poked me with a +
broken hatpin, but I was really too excited and frightened Just to know what +
she really did." +
Miss Degener has not told her parents of the meeting between +
and her sister. She declares that Mrs. Frace, about a year ago, was a patient +
in a private sanitarium at San Mateo, and hopes that her brother-in-law -+â 
will s-'e fit to place her again in restraint. +
+ Thia victim of a sister's wrath is not without a Just appreciation of her +
+ charms. "I wouldn't have Mr. Frace," she scornfully said, and then her +
+ blue eyes took on their gray tint, as she smiled and continued, "although I +
-â¦- could get him If I wanted to." +

WANTED TO
WIPE OUT
THE INSULT
Threatened War in
Chinatown Averted.
HIGHBINDERS ARE AT OUTS
HOSTILITIES PBEVENTED BY
THE CHINESE CONSUL.
The Kidnaping of a Pretty Woman
the Cause of the Trouble â Sha
Was Spirited Away to
San Jose.
What thrf-ntr-nnd to be a serious out
l>reak In Chinatown was averted yester
day by Sergeant McManus and posse and
the Chinese Consul.
A short time ago two highbinders vis
ited a den on Sullivan alley, and by the
indiscriminate use of their revolvers com
pelled one of the Inmates, a rather pretty
girl of 17 years, to accompany them.
After leaving tho house the highbinders
took the pirl to a lodging house on Sac
ramento street, where she was held a cap
tive for several days.
Evidently thinking they were safe from
arrest, the highbinders subsequently
forced her to assume a disguise, and sum
moning a hack they had her driven to
the Southern Pacific depot, where they
purchased tickets for San Jose. The
owner of the girl, who is president of one
of the highbinder societies, In some way
learned that sho had been taken to the
Garden City, and he determined to wreak
vengeance on her captors.
Summoning the hatchet men of the so
ciety, he informed them of what had hap
pened, and ordered thr-m to put the brace
of highbinders out of the way. While the
murderous gang was preparing to carry
out the instructions of their "chief" the
girl suddenly returned, having escaped
from her captors. The following day the
highbinders also reappeared, apparently
bent on rrg.unlng possession of her. Go
ing to the house of their intended victim
they attempted to force an entrance, but
were driven off after a hard struggle,
during which one of the highbinders was
struck over the head with an iron bar.
Smarting under the humiliation of being
beaten by the slave owner, the two men
reported the occurrence to their society,
and war was at. once declared.
The tong of which the slave-owner is
the presiding officer learned of the bellige
rent action of the rival organization, and
after a heated debate, it was decided to
give fhe enemy battle.
Just as the rival tongs were preparing
to wipe each other off the face of the
Â«rrth, the Chinese Consul, hearing of the
threatened outbreak, appealed to the pol
ice to prevent hostilities. Accompanied by
a number of men from the California
Street Station, Sergeant McManus and his
squad visited the headquarters of thw
warring factions and threatened to arresi
the ring-leaders if they persisted in en
gaging in a battle. A.s a precautionary
measure, MoManus had the officers patron
the 'alleys of Chinatown with instructions
to search every highbinder for weapons.
Evidently alarmed over the presence of
the extra detail of police, the rival tongs
notified the Chinese Consul that a tempo
rary truce had been established and askea
him to notify the police. As the- Consul
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 16, 1898.
was satisfied that the Intended battle
would not take place. Sergeant McManus
withdrew his men. after giving the ring
leaders to understand that he would not
brook any foolishness.

WHITE WOMEN
NEED THE JOB
Ready to Make Uncle
Sam's Uniforms.
HUNDREDS ASK EMPLOYMENT
AMERICAN SEAMSTRESSES ARE
WILLING TO WORK.
They Form a Cohporation to Dis
pense With Chinese Coolie
Labor on Soldiers'
Clothing.
The agitation against Chinese making
uniforms for the soldiers of Uncle Sam's
army, while hundreds of worthy white
women were In need of this work, hoa
been productive of good results. As soon
as the labor unions called attention to the
injustice their committees, assisted by
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald and hia
deputies, began a systematic Investigation
to learn why this work was being given
to contractors who employ coolie labor
and how many white women could be
found who are able and willing to make
soldiers' garments. The reason for the
first is given in one word, "indifference."'
In order to get information on the latter
subject the Commissioner opened a regis
ter in his office for all who desire this
work to so announce. To his and others'
surprise the number ran up into the hun
dreds and many are yet to be heard from.
Many women anxious to secure the priv
ilege of making soldiers' clothing called
upon "W. W. Allen, the attorney, knowing
that he is a member of the Grand Army
of the Republic and that his patriotism
would induce him to assist them to get
the work. They reasoned well. Veteran
Allen has at last perfected a plan by
which the desired end can be accom
plished. He has taken upon his shoulders
the responsibility of forming a corpora
tion to be composed of women entire! v
the purpose of which is set out in the foll
owing statement of the objects which
appears in the articles of incorporation:
WOMAN'S HOME SEWING COMPANY.
Incorporated.
The object of the corporation Is to protect
working women and enable them to secure full
value for their labor.
To contract sewing of all kinds and distribute
the same to deserving women at prices eoual
to the value of the work to be performed
To iurnlbh work to deserving women at both
factory and home, so that the families shall
receive the benefits instead or enriching con
tractors.
To establish, maintain and conduct a fac
tory and depot for Fupplylng women with sew
ing of all kinds at all times at prices in pro
portion to their ability to perform and grade
the same np to the full value of the character
wo-k performed, upon each class of
Mr. Allen said: "When these ladles ex
plained the situation to me I found a
great many of them to be wives and
wnlows of soldiers of the late war and
not a fow are relatives of the soldiers of
the present war. All are deserving of the
employment they ask for, and I set about
to see what could be done for them In
order to remedy an evil you must' find
something better. This something better
is a corporation, and this will be
rully organized as Boon as the
proper ladies can bÂ« found to serve
as directorsâ ladiea who will faith
fully perform the duties as outlined
In the stated objects. I have parties now
engaged In selecting ladies who are will
ing and competent to fill the positions.
This cannot be a failure. I have the as
surance of several of the agents of sew
ing machine companies that they will fur
nish all the machines necessary at a nom
inal figure. A large room can be rented
cheaply and power put in at small cost
At present the contractors make 75 per
cent out of their contracts, and the people
who do the work get only 25 per cent. We
will reverse the proposition, giving the
women who do the work the 7"> per cent
reserving only 25 per cent for the payment
of rent, cost of power and rental of the
machines. In addition to these will be the
salary of a woman to keep the books and
of another who will have charge of giv
ing out the work and handling the stock.
Ihe corporation will make contracts direct
with the Government officers and give se
curity for the faithful performance of the
work. Those women who cannot go to
the factory may take their work home
giving some recommendation of their wor
thiness and ability."
The new scheme will be launched form
ally in the early part of next week and
work contracted for as soon as possible.
CAROLINE SCHERK
SENT TO AN ASYLUM
UNFORTUNATE YOUNG WOMAN
DECLARED INSANE.
Action in the Case of Her Sister Was
Deferred Until Monday â Her
Actions to Be Observed.
Caroline Scherr was committed to the
asylum for the insane at Ukiah by JudÃe
Hebbard yesterday. Action in the case
of her sister Helen was deferred until
Monday, in order that the physicians on
the Board of Insanity Commissioners
might have an opportunity of observing
her actions before giving their opinion
regarding her mental condition.
Policemen Coleman and Butterworth
gave evidence as to the insanity of the
unfortunates. They again told their story
of their visit to the Scherr household at
the Instance of the Board of Health, and
described at length the condition in which
they found the family. They advanced
the opinion that both the women were in
sane, but Judge Hebbard examined them
personally. Both of the girls were fright
ened, and tried to hide their faces when
approached, but Judge Hebbard managed
to get Caroline to speak. She said tnat
she did not properly care for herself and
attend to her personal wants because her
hands were "full of splinters." The un
fortunate woman cried for drink, how
ever, and gave the opinion that her in
firmities are in a great degree due to in
temperance. Her general demeanor, how
ever, bo clearly indicated insanity that no
delay was allowed in her ease, and she
was ordered to be sent to Ukiah at once.
As her sister acted more rationally, it
was decided to postpone the investigation
of her case until next Monday. Sub'penas
were issued for the brothers of the young
women. For some unexplained reason, tho
brothers did not appear at the examina
tion of Caroline. They have not visited
their sisters since their arrest, and it is
thought that they fear arrest and are. in 1
consequence, keeping away.
The Late Mrs. A. S. Blake.
Mrs. A. S. Blake of this city, whose fu
neral will occur to-day, was a woman of
charming personality and a writer and
artist of no mean ability. Bhe was a
member of the Women's Press Club of
San Francisco and a contributor to the
Detroit Post, the Detroit Free Press and
other Eastern publications, and was for
years a serial writer for prominent New
York papers. She was a native of Massa
chusetts and resident of Boston, and her
country home near the latter city was
noted for the warm hospitality she ex
tended to her numerous guests. For three
years past she has lived a secluded life at
Santa Cruz and in this city, owing to
partial paralysis. Nevertheless, she won
the love of all with whom she came in con
tact by unvarying sweetness and patience
during her continuous suffering. She was
a member of the Washburne family of 1
Massachusetts, and left a large circle of
friends here and in the Eastern States.
A Conspiracy Alleged.
Thomas Marks filed sulf yesterday
against Thomas R. Evans, Ann Dunn,
John Rodda and the California Fuse As
sociation to recover $25,000. The plaintiff
alleges that the defendants entered into
a conspiracy to defraud him, and he now
asks for a Judgment to reimburse him for
his loss.
BID PARTNER
IN NEW YORK
He Will Not Stamp Ex
press Packages.
WELLS-FARGO'S OLD TRICK
PATRONS OBLIGED TO PTJNGLE
WAR DUTIES.
Blame Shifted From the San Fran
cisco Tail to the New Yonc
Head and the Band
Plays On.
The war revenue law, among other
provisions, for the raising of money
to pay Uncle Sam's army and navy
their wages for teaching Spain a les
son on humanity, has Included ex
press companies In the catalogue of
public Institutions that should contribute
their pro rata to the fund. On this and the
language of tne act thore seems to be a
conflict of opinion as between the express
companies and the consignors.
Wells-Fargo's Company in this city has
thrown down the gauntlet and has re
fused to place the one cent stamp on the
bill of lading or receipt, as the case may
be. This view as held by the company's
manager in this city has been the cause
of considerable friction between the com
pany and its patrons. One in particular,
of the firm of Jones Brothers & Co., mar
ble dealers at Second and Brannan
streets, has led to almost a business rup
ture. The firm In the course of its busi
ness had a box to send to Marysvllle,
which was taken to the express com
pany's office to be shipped. When it ar
rived there the coi pany refused to place
the one cent stamp on the bill of lading.
A similar refusal was made by the ship
per, and neither would yield. Ultimately,
however, Jones Brothers shipped the
goods by the railroad and took It for
granted that the express company lacked
patriotism in not willingly contributing to
Uncle Sam in his trial with a foreign foe.
A.ll of which Is indignantly uenied by the
local managers of the express company.
In explaining the company's position on
the tax, L. F. Rowell, the manager in this
city, said to a Call representatives who
waited on him:
"Far be it from the Intention of this
company to oppese in any way the collect
ing of the revenue tax for the suportof the
Government; on the contrary, we will aid
In every way we can the President and his
iidministration in carrying the war to a
final and successful end. To prove this, I
i'tend to show our good Intentions. When
the new laws came out a few weeks ago,
Mr. Valentine and myself had a consulta
tion over the section of taxing bills of
lading by express companies, and we
unanimously agreed to comply and did
comply and placed stamps on all such
bills. In the mean time Colonel Evans,
3econd vice president and New York man
;i.ir'-r. had joined in with the heads of the
New York express companie-s, and he
with the others, agreed to make up a test
case and have it submtted to the Federal
court at that place the result of which
we will most cheerfully abide by.
"It will thus be seen that it is not the
company in this city that is setting itself
up as against the law and the people. Our
representative in New York having taken
the stand he did. as a matter of course
tied our hands here, though we were ever
so willing to bear our share of the public
burden, which we are at all times in the
paying of our taxes and licenses. But un
til the case is settled, and we hope it will
be soon, we must decline to place the
1-cent stamp upon the bills of lading."
Registration Picking Up.
There is a marked increase in the num
ber of citizens registering at the central
office during the past week, yet there is
considerable of a shortage as compared
with the corresponding number of days
in which the office was opened two years
ago. On this, the thirty-seventh day, the
number registered two years ago was 16,
012, whereas this year the number is only
10,525. But during the last five days there
has been a marked increase in the num
ber as compared with what had been the
case in the earlier days after the office
opened. Now the registration runs up
close to 1000 daily, whereas during the
earlier periods it did not exceed 200.
Citizens would do well to remember that
the last day in which they can place
their names on the voting register at the
central office is the 9th of August.

One tie game to be played off by these teams.
The mighty Gilt Edges, who will be
with us to-day, still lead In the cham
pionship race. Close upon their heels,
however, and crowding them hard are the
Florists of San Jose.
This aggregation has been putting up
excellent bull nearly all season, yet bar
ring the pitching department is not
stronger than the majority of the other
clubs.
It la In the pitcher's box that they are
particularly strong and to this reason
more than any other do they owe their
present standing.
In the In and out fields the leaders are ;
Undoubtedly their superiors, but I am in- j
clined to believe that in tho pitching de- j
partment matters are about even, liar- j
ney is admittedly a great pitcher and Is j
ably supported by Mr. Doyle, a man of ;
ability.
I berg, on the other hand, has been
pitching great ball all season, backed up
by a' team which, as 1 said before, is !
Inferior when compared to the leaders.
Dunlin, the new man recently launched
before the baseball fraternity, did good .
â¢work. If the game he pitched on his first
appearance ut Recreation Park is any
criterion he is the filial of Doyle. How- ;
ever, as 1 have seen liarney. Doyle and j
Dunlin perform but once it is rather dif
ficult for me to compare their abilities
and do them justice.
The San Joses with their present team
are going to -give an -argument' and if
they do not catch the mighty Gilt Edges
It certainly will not be the fault of their
pftcherto. They must not, however, at- i
tempt to take things easy, for following
them at not a very great distance are
teams Just as good as they are, save in i
the ..pitcher's box, and .playing superb ;
ball. too. , ,
The Athletics have apparently struck
their gait, as have the Fresnos . and
Beachcombers, and the battle from now
on. considering the improved style or
play should be Interesting. If they are
able to offset the advantage the San Josea
have" over them by playing superior ball
the race will be extremely exciting and
well worth seeing. |
The coming games will make great ,
changes in the percentage table, and if |
those last three teams do not hurry up
all chances of participating in the dis
tribution of the prize money at the ex
piration of the season will be lost.
It Is really sorrowful to note the stand-
Ing of the Oaklands. This team, as I have
said on former occasions, contains many
good players. Why they should allow
themselves to be in seventh place grows
more puzzling every minute. \\ hat iaej
must do immediately is to wake up t..e r
pitchers. Both of them display mo'.e wild
ness In a single game than most pitchers
In the league do In a month. It all comes
G^t LL ff f C terÂ°thlm . C Ewmg. or the Stocktons
will forge ahead; and also acquaint your
players wiih the fact that the," are .a
seventh place. ,
The San Franciscos are gradually wend
ing their way toward the bottom or thÂ»;
list, and I fear ihat it Is only a matter or
lime before they will wrest the honors
from Its present occupants.
They woke up last Sunday long enough
to participate in one of the grandest
games of the season. If they will only
continue to play as they did on that oc
casion a glorious surprise awaits the root
ers of this city. , , .
There is Indescribable consolation to be
derived from the fact that they still lead
the boys from across the bay. A player
remarked to me only yesterday. "Wbtt a
beautiful struggle the Oaklands and
FrISCOS are having for last place: It
certainly does take on such an appear
ance yet In view of that thirteen inning
game I considered the Joke ill-timed. Had
It been delivered a week ago, however, I
must confess that it would have been ap
preciated to an astonishing degree.
All this talk about Mr. Raver going- to
take charge of the team has dwindled
down to a proposition of "almost impos
sible." However, a few of th isÂ« in a po
sition to give information insist that such
Is the case and that it will only be Â£ mat
ter of time. Others claim that the re
doubtable Colonel T. P. Robinson has
been offered the management, but I am
Inclined to believe that T. P. in perfectly
satisfied with his position in thi league
He would no doubt, with his experi^n^e,
considerably Improve the team. It does
not make much difference who takes
charge, so long as the team wins and
plays good ball. If it is not beyond the
possibilities for this team to line up to its
superb work of last Sunday, who knows
but what Murphy or Hammond will Ye
candidates for the position. The. team at
any rate has played one good game this
season ; we can but wait and see what
they will do next.
To-day the crack Gilt Edges will be vis
ible at Recreation Park for the first time
this season. It is needless to say that
the game will be a good oneâ it could
hardly be otherwise. Oposed to them will
be the Athletics, with Fitzpatrlck in the
box. The line up:

PROPOSED REVISION
OF DOG SHOW RULES
Changes Suggested by Fanciers,
Members of the Various
Kennel Clubs.
The San Francisco Kennel Club has not
received many replies as yet to the Invi
tation to a. conference, sent out to the
different kennel and specialty clubs of
the roaÂ«t. The St. Bernard Club of Cali
fornia has refused the Invitation, stating
that Its members are quite satisfied with
the rules on classification as last amended
by the American Kennel Club.
The meeting of the Pacific Mastiff Club
is scheduled for next Thursday night,
and the report of the committee on rules,
if adopted, will Instruct the delegate of
that club to propose to the convention the
following alternative set of rules:
First, puppy class, as at present; sec
ond, novice class, optional with club hold-
Ing show; third, open class, open to. all
dogs; fourth, junior class, open to dogs
not having won four first prizes, wins in
puppy and novice classes excepted; fifth,
senior class, open to dogs having won four
or more first prizes In open or Junior
classes; three wins in senior class to en
title to championship; sixth, champion
class..-.'.
These rules have been indorsed by dele
gates of other clubs, to whom they have
been submitted. It is claimed that they
have the merit of providing competition
by means of the class open to all dogs, and
yet, that they prevent the cheapening of
championships, so much deprecated by
fanciers.
The report of the Pacific Mastiff Club's
committee on rules embodies a recommen
dation that no win In the senior < lass
should count toward a championship, un
lees there has been competition in the
class.
'George Bell, the Judge of the recent San
Francisco Bench Show, will be summoned
as a witness by the board of directors of
the Kennel Club to give evidence in the
matter of Mr. Samuel's complaint In the
case of the bull-terrtor, Scaldy Mike. It
[a claimed by competent Judges that Mr.
Bell's disqualification of the euphoniously
named bone of contention was not sound
ly based. An examination of the standard
of the bull-terrier club discloses no clause
authorizing the disqualification of a dog
on acount of a black spot.
A. Bennett, who Is taking Emmet Sulli
van's setters across the continent to com
pete in the Eastern field trials, reports
t that his proteges are doing well. Ho
claims that the "string" from the Golden
State will make our Eastern compatriots
open. their eyes, He seems certain of be
ing in the money. There can be no ques
tion .that dogÂ» with the reputation of
Hope's Hill. Dash Antonio and Lock will
prove to be a combination equal to the
best that they will meet, even though
those be the best "that come out of the
East."
FUTURE CYCLING
MEETS
BUT NO TOURING.
Since the annual State meet at Sacra
mento on July 4 affairs have been dull
in wheeling circles ami there Is little
likelihood of a revival until the end of
August. A race meet at Stockton on Au
gust 28 and the succeeding events on Sep
tember 9 and IS and October 9 will at
tract attention. As a general thing there j
is little doing in cycling at this season j
of the year, as the roads are too dusty j
and the weather too warm for comfort- j
able touring in the country and clubs and
Individuals wait for the fall months.
The Terminal City Wheelmen of Stock
ton will hold a race meet on the Good
water Grove track on Sunday, August 28,
and work has already commenced to
place the track in first-class shape. The j
events will Include a ten-mile county i
championship, two-mile handicap, one- !
half mile scratch and one-quarter mile
dash, the latter three events open to all j
amateurs. Liberal prizes will be awarded
and many entrants from this city. Oak- :
land and San Jose are expected.
The San Francisco Road Club will have '
a run to Petaluma to-morrow, taking the |
8 a. m. Tiburon ferry-boat and train to i
Saji Rafael. Robinson, O'Malley, E. Lew

Dr. Thomas L. HIM "of the " Ray City

Lucien Prince, who won the amateur

year, is now here with tin- Tennesai c
Volunteers encamped at Camp Merritt,
being orderly to Colonel Smith. He is
eaid to be one of the fastest amateurs
in the United States. ranking with Pea
body, Powell and Kenna. The local men
would like to see him in a match with
Wing, Peck and "Bunt" Smith.
Henry F. Wynne, the organizer and
backbone of the California Cycling Club,
has gone, back to his first love, the Bay
City Wheelmen, having recently rejoined
the latter club.
The recent accident to two Oakland
riders, Mortimer MrCowan and Gainford
Hughes, in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
when they were both badly bruised and
their wheels demolished by attempting to
ride a dangerous hill, brings vividly to
attention the good work the California
Associated Cycling Clubs are doing in
this direction. In all parts of the Stf.te
where the association officials are aware
there are dangerous inclines sign boards
are put up. notifying cyclers of the dan
ger. This work cannot all be done in a
day, and it takes money to carry it on,
and tne hill upon which the Oakland
riders met with an accident has not yet
been marked with a sign board. The
moral is that every touring wheelman
should be possessed of a road book telling
of dangerous grades and curves, and
should also help the work being done by
joining the association and contributing
his mite to the fund. One dollar a year
is surely cheap Insurance for a rider who
travels much, and the two On.klanders
would gladly have given ten times that
amount apiece to have been In a posi
tion to avert the accident which befall
them, spoiling their outing. Send to the
cycling editor of The Call for application
blanks and full data regarding the asso
ciation.

AT SAUSALITO.
This evening there will be & dance at
the San Francisco Yacht Club house.
Sausalito, under the management of the
house committee, consisting of Port Cap
tain Dr. A. W. McKenzle, Secretary
Charles B. Hill and Financial Secretary
\Y. G. Morrow. For the convenience of
visitors a tug will leave Mission-street
wharf 1 at T:3O p. m., returning from Sau
salito at 11 o'clock.
Commodore T. 1.. Hill and Mrs. Hill
started last Saturday for a cycling trip
through Yellowstone Park, leaving the
flagship Cygnus in the charge of E. C.
Bartlett. formerly financial secretary of
the San Francisco Yacht Club. Last Sun
day B. C. Bartlett with a party of friends
sailed to El Campo, ac did also Arthur
D. Naylor in his sloop Twilight and
Messrs. Eaton and Lowell in the yawl
Frolic.
At th'> last meeting of the directors of
San Francisco Yacht Club the commo
dore appointed as delegates to the Pacific
Interclub Yacht Association: Arthur D.
Naylor of the sloop Twilight. L. Q. Haven
Of the sloop Sappho, and George S. An
<lrÂ«>s. who is not a yacht-owner, the con
stitution of the association requiring that
one of the delegates from each club shall
be a non-owner.
The Pacifies have a cruise to Vallejo
and return and the Corinthians a cruise
to Marlu Islands and return scheduled
for to-day and to-morrow. The Kncinals
have their annual class flag regatta
scheduled for this afternoon, but so few
of the boats are In racing trim that the
event has been postponed. The yawl Em
erald and the sloops Vixen and Fawn
are cruising up the Sacramento River.
Among the Corinthian yachts cruising
In the upper bay last Sunday were Com
modore Carl Westerfeld's sloop Aeolus,

and <;. R. Lauinger.
There is an open date on the programme
of the California Yacht Club and the
event arranged for to-morrow is the re
gatta for the Wallace trophy. The re
gatta "will be postponed until the end of
August, as by that time George Miller's
sloop Occident, which goes into commis
sion and makes her first cruise to-mor
row, will be in racing trim. The later
date will afford a good opportunity for
trying out the club yachts for the Pacific
Interclub Association's regatta on Sep
tember 4.
Secretary Gaither's sloop U & I Is still
on the mud at Vallejo. The owner and
his crew will go up to Vallejo to-day to
bring her down.
The crew of the sloop Hazel, which
went on the rocks off Selby's Smelting

In commission shortly. Her rigging is at
the clubhouse.
Sydney Marshall of the Callforniaa has
joined the Alameda contingent and is

E. N. Walter's sloop Embla had on
board last Sunday Commodore and Mrs.
C. J. Lancaster and Frank Langstroth.
Dan O'Connell clears up a Sausa

RIFLEMEN AWAIT
THE NEXT
BUND FESTIVAL.
Since the officers of the National
Schuetzen Bund have decided to hold the
next shooting festival in Son Francisco
in 1901, this event being held every three
years, the riflemen of this city have talked
of nothing else. Those who are the most
Interested have plenty of work to attend
to before the festival Is an assured fact.
According to the latest Information the
holding of the contests here Is conditional
upon the raising of $100,000 as a guarantee
fund. Large as It appears to be, the local
enthusiasts are confident that they can
eaÃlly place this amount at the disposal
of the Bund.
The question may be asked why so large
a sum as this is 'necessary for such .vn
event. The answer is that the holding of
the festival here, as well as at any place,
is a big undertaking. In the first place
the prizes must be of such a value as to
induce men to cross the continent and to
come from Europe. Although it Is neces
sary for this amount to be guaranteed. It
does not follow that all or even any part
of it will be expended. With a good at
tendance and liberal entries the festival
will pay of itself, even though the cash
prizes and medals amount to thousands
of dollars. The marksmen have to pay
for every score they shoot, and the rev
enue from this source is always a large
sum. This is shown by the receipts of
entrance money at the festival in ISKi. In
all 10.127 point tickets were sold, amount
ing to $10,127. Ring tickets, 1892. netting
$3784. Man target tickets, 1145, $2290. mak

All of the local rifle clubs have agreed
to unite and make the coming event a
success in every particular. A 1 the pres
ent time there are only two clubs mem
bers of the bund, but it Is expected that
before the time of meeting arrives all the
Pacific Coast organizations will be united.
This can only lie done by burying the
hatchet In the matter of old differences,
for it is useless to pretend that the best
of leeling has always existed among the
clv.bs. To accomplish the desired resuiui
the responsibilities, work and honors of
preparing for the festival must bo fairly
divldt-d among the several clubs. An at
tempt for one club, one clique or one man
to "run the whole shooting mutch" 1 will
end in discord that would throw the affair
into a disgraceful muddle.
Now Is the time for the riflemen to Join
hands and adopt the motto "Unity iinrt
Success," A move in the right direction
has already been taken. The San Fran
cisco Schuotzen Vermin Is the largest and
wealthiest organization of the kind in th.Â»
West and It is a member of tha bund. It
was thin body that took the first steps in
the matter, and its efforts wÂ°re seconded
by the Columbia Pistol and KinÂ» Club,
the only other member of the b.md on thl*
coast The i\: st brought together the rep
resentatives of all the other clubs, whU h
promised to give their support. Within
the last few days the Turner Schuetzen,
Cal'fornla Schuetzon, Krleger '/ereta, Han
Jcse Turner Schuetzen and three cluba of
Sacramento have promised to loin the
bund.
The members of the California Srhuei
zen Club are preparing for their annur.l
shocting festival, which will take place in
September. At the next meeting commit
tees will be appointed for the event.

SPEEDY HOUNDS
OUT FOR
VALUABLE STAKES
There is much good coursing scheduled
j for to-day at botn parks. At Ingleside
j two stakes will be runâ an event for dogs
j that have not won third or better during
the past six months and a special cham
pion contest. At Union Park there will
I also be two stakes, a contest between
; eight veterans and an all-age, open event
I embracing fifty-six candidates.
The latter and the non-winner stake at
! Ingleside embrace many keen performers
i and are of about the same quality, while
the champion stake at Ingleside has In
deed brought out champions. The run
: ning at both parks will begin at the usual
i hour and continue through to-morrow.
According to the talent False Flatterer
I has a pipe cinch on the open stake at
! Union Park. Still, the books are giving
1 4 to 1 against him.
Jim Edmonds has a new one In at Union
! to-day In Master Mate. As he Is up
1 against Minneapolis he must needs be a
good one to save entrance money.
Magoulto bids fair to run strongly at
! Ingleside to-day. Last week he was tried
' out with Duncan's Royal Chief and won.
Duncan alleged that his dog did no: git
1 a sufficiently long slip. They were put
: In again, and this time the slipper held
â  the dogs until, in response to his ques-
I tlon, Mr. Duncan declared himself satls
| fled. It was a remarkably long slip, but
j again Magneto won. Magneto is
, only a pup. but he is a Magnet pup, and
1 Magnet's many victories at Ingleside long
â  since made him famous.
Besides the two chief stakes at Union
Park, a consolation event will also be
run. to which no entry fee will be
charged.
Handy & Smith's Ida, now in kennel
at Ingleside, Is fast getting into shape.
Ida's record beyond the mountains is one
of many victories. She stood the trip out
very badly, and it will take another week
or two to bring her back to top-notch
shape.
The so-called "boxing" method recently
adopted at I'nion Park In slipping the
hares receives much commendation. It
certainly saves much delay.
It is reported that Cashier, a young and
promising Eastern dog. has been pur
chased by a local leashman, and will
shortly arrive on the coast.
Commencing: about August 1, the Inter
state Coursing Club officials contemplate
many Improvements at Ingleside. One vt
the first, and best, will be the changing
of the drawings to Thursday nights.
Koolawn is back at Ingleside again this
week, after a brief rest. She has only
had one week's training, but at that she
should do some torrid work. Koolawn Is
a dog that comes back in a very short
time.
The aggregate money disbursed at both
parks this week In prizes Is over $1500.
Five years ago the stakes were deemed
liberal at $50. Over 10,000 people will view
the sport at the two parks to-morrow. A
like period ago 200 constituted a crowd.

TROUT RISE TO
THE FLY
ON THE TRUCKEE
The fishermen who have visited the
Sierra Nevada Mountains this season
have enjoyed grand sport. M. J. Geary,
sporting editor of The Call, and a recog
nized authority on angling, has been at
Boca for a fortnight. He writes enter
tainingly of the trout fishing, saying:
Trout llshing on the Truckee River Is better
now than it has been for some years past.
Angl-rs who Intend visiting this vicinity, how
ever, must not think that with the mere cast-
Ing 01 a hook in the stream It wiil return
with scales. Trout, ulthough very plentiful In
this stream., are not to be fooled by every Tom
Dick and Harry who may wet a line w"lth the
sole Intention of creeling in the so-called
"speckled beauties." Truutâ l refer to fish of
from ten inches up to eltfht pounda in weight
have, in the language of the turfite, "horse
sense," and will not be fooled as easily as
many anglers imagine. Still an expertâ a man
who has had practical experience and wh<Â»
understands how to present a fly properly to
the king of the mountain streamsâ can always
rely on good sport In the Truckee Illver. There
are times when trout fishing Is comparatively
good and bad, and that n;t-uns either joy or
OlagUft to the emulators of Walton. I am
pleased to have the opportunity of stating that
the fishing Ik now really good and anglers who
are anticipating a trip to this section of the
country should not postpone their proposed out
ing. The river is extremely low this year be
cause of the scarcity of snow on the moun
tains, consequently fly fishing at certain times
of the day Is first-class. AVhen the sky is over
cast the sport Is good from morning until
night, but >.n bright days the best angling
hours are from 2 to ."> o'clock and from 7 until
8:30 p. m. The largest fish are caught from
sundown until after dark. The flies that aro

Al dimming, one of the best known and
most thorough sportsmen on the coast,
has just returned from his annual vaca
tion, and is loud In his praise of the grand
fishlnj? to bo had at Webber Lake and the
Streams within ten miles of that resort.
Our party, which consisted of P. J. Tormey,
Captain George Cummlne, Eli Marks. David
Pachs and myself, left here on June 2, said
Mr. Cummins; yesterday. We made our head
quarters at Webber Lake and had the best
possible sport. I averaged thirty-five trout
a day for three weeks and the general aver
age of all our party was twenty. Our favorite
tiles were the "Blue Wing," "Bumble Bee."
"Black Ant." "March Brown," "Professor"
and "Blue Bottle." With them we used N'n.
2 and 3 hooks. From Webber I went to White
Rnck Lake with "Jack" Samml and A. B.
Finch. I killed thirty-three. averaging from
three-quartern to one and one-quarter pounds.
AVlth Mr. Finch and George Gage I went to
Jackson Creek on the old Hennls Pass road,
ten miles (mm Webber. My companions fished
up-stream, while I went down the stream. Be
tween them they secured forty trout of the
cm-throat variety, while I was more fortu
nate and caught thirty that weighed eighteen
pounds.
Our next trip was to Fore Pyce, eight miles
from Webber by the wagon road. The first
day we landed eigfcXy-sf:ven, averaging a half
pound each, while the next day our total catch
whs io~. I tried the Little Truckee River at
the outlet of Webber Lake and secured twenty
four fair fish. The best fishing on, the Little
Truckee is over the mountain from Sage Urn,
a small stage station.
In Webber I^ake are Loch Levin, Bon dÂ» Bar,
Eastern red-speckled brook trout, land-loikea
salmon anil cut throat trout. Two hundred and
fifty of the Loch Levin trout were placed In
the lake two years since and 2500 last year.
They have thrived wonderfully and will pro
vide the greatest possible sport three years
hence. When caught now they are Invariably
turned back by the sportsmen, although re
ports to the contrary have been circulated In
this city. They are the most beautifully col
ored fish In the world and the gamest. Some
pound-and-a-half nsh have been landed only
after the most desperate struggles, and what
they will do when they attain the weight of
four pounds Is hard to conjecture. They will
play havoc with five-and-a-half-ounce rods.
From the size of the fish that have been taken
it is evident that they are breeding and will
multiply rapidly. We made our headquarters
at S. T. Burton's at "Webber Lake. This is
off the line of the railroad, an equal distance
from Boca and from Truckee. From here all
points can be reached readily.
All through the Sierra Nevada Mountains Is
simply a sportsman's paradise this year.
Owing to the light snowfall deer are plentiful
and bears are also to be found. Grouse and
mountain quail are doing exceedingly well and
will provide magnificent sport in September,
when the season opens. There have been but
few sheep in the valleys this year, no that they
have not injured the nests as in the past. In
Sierra Valley snipe shooting is at its best.

TO-DAY. 1 P. M.-TO-MORROW. U A. M.BUT CHIEF LEES SLEPT,
Pandemonium and Cries of "Murder"
Merelu Lull the Drowsu Ear of
the City's Senile Warden,
Chief Leefl was sleepingâ sleeping the sound, exhausted sleep of the aged.
T'p the street came the noise of men's voices, raised in angry altercation,
followed by the sound of swift Mows, fiercely dealt. Agonized screams en
sued, cries* of "Don't hit me again! You're killing me! Murder! Murder!"
Nearer and nearer they came, the voices of two men mingling In a
drunken brawl, by the house, under the very window of the supposed protec
tor of the public peace, but no sound stole o'er the drowsy senses of the
sleeping Chief.
Out Into the stillness o{ the night rang the frenzied shriek of a police
man's whistle, blown by a frightened woman, whose slumber had been dis
turbed Tn the windows of the hotels that decorate the block where Chief
Lees' habitation rears Its haughty head figures appeared one after another,
in their Blumber robes, which were distinctly visible In the light of the lamps
that dimly winked upon the corners.
Crazy drunk and Bhrieking as though pursued by angry devils, the man,
who had now been deserted by his companion, chnse as the base of his oper
ations a hotise not five doors from the Chiefs. He ascended the stairs, and
belligerently and vociferously demanaed admittance. This being refused, he
force it by breaking through ihe glass panel of the door. Then,
Btumbling <i wn the steps, he peeled Â»iff coat and vest and hat, dropped them
in a heap upon the sidewalk, and started down the street again, still shout-
Ing and yelling, the blood from his wounded hand making a distinct track
behind his wavering footsteps.
All this in the "woo, sma' hours" of the morning. To the policeman's
whistle, to the Bummons ttleplioned to police headquarters, nor policeman,
nor night-watchman (.and there are two paid to watch the block) put in an
appearance. Nor did the old Chief once awaken to the fact that his dear

but that of the Chief never once shook off the dark mantle that night had

\\ hai it the neighborhood was frightenedâ what If. drunken soldiers did
Invade the block? All that was as nothing in comparison with the fact that
Ia es needed his slumber, for every one knows that he has long since
arrived at the period when exhausted brain and body need all the sleep that
they car. get.
And so, the senile Chief slept on.

The bicycle, if used in moderation, will

CHEAP GAS FROM GARBAGE.
; Gigantic Project Under Consideration
by Charles L. Fair and Other
Capitalists.
I A gigantic project is under considera
tion by Charles L. Fair and other capi
ta Ists with the view of making and fur
nishing cheap gas to residents of towns
, and cities throughout the State, by what
!is known as the Harris process. By this
process, it is said, illuminating gas can
I" manufactured at an average cost of
! about 3 cents per 1000 feet, from garbage
; of almost any character.
During his recent visit to the East Mr.
Fair became interested in the new pro
cess and studied it carefully. When he
returned he established an experimental
station at the junction of Ray and Fill
more streets, and fur several* weeks ex
perts have been making tests with satis
: ry results. They have shown that
Illuminating gas can be produced by this
proi ess at 35-candle power as against 16
furnished by local companies.
It is expected that there will be no dif
ficulty in arranging with the crematory
cfimpany for a supply of the necessary
kimls of garbage here, and Mr. Fair has
been already in consultation with ex-
Mayor Ellert on the subject.
Mr. Harris, the inventor of the new pro
cess, is expected here on Monday, wh^n
plans for erecting suitable building's on
the Fair property at North Beach will be
discussed and action taken to perfect the
enterprise. .

forged the name of Irving M. Scott to a
check for $300 upon the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank, must spend the next seven
years of his life behind prison bars. I,ast
Friday when the case of Craig was called
Eugene Deuprey, who represented the
prisoner, created a sensation by stating
that his client had not had a fair trial;
that the court had refused to issue an
attachment for State Controller Colgan
when requested to do so, and that Col
gan's evidence was of great importance.
Judge Wallace at the time was angry,
and he put the case over a week to look
up the record, but contrary to expecta
tions no allusion to the incident was
made yesterday. Deuprey quietly submit
ted ;i motion lor an arrest of judgment
and for a new trial. Both were overruled
and the court sentenced Craig to seven
y ;Â»rs in Folsom.
Oscar Stegrenberg, who on the 21st of
last February robbed John Johnson of $25,
was sent to Folsom for a term of twenty
years. J. E. Tibbett.s, who pleaded guilty

DEMOCRATS
DISGUSTED
Unwilling to Be Tin Can
to the Populist Tail.
HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF
BEPRESENTATTVES SNUBBED
AT SACRAMENTO.
"Better Go Down With the Old Flag
Flying Than Be Second Fiddle
to Any Political
Party."
The nomination of Judge Maguire by
the Populist convention at Sacramento
was unexpected and It may be truth
fully said undeslred by the mass of
Democratic voters In this city. While
Maguire Is the choice of many who ex
pressed their opinion, they seemed to
be unanimous upon one proposition,
that It would appear to the people at
large as If the Democrats, in case
Judge Maguire should be nominated by
their convention, were following the
lead of the Populists and allowing
themselves to be placed In the position
of being compelled to select the man
chosen for them by a supposed hostile
political party.
A number of gentlemen who com
posed the committee sent to Sacra
mento to represent the Democratic
party have returned, and while ex
hibiting the caution and secrecy which
are supposed to belong to drained dip
lomats, once In a while drop hints of
their real feelings to the effect thatthey
were incontinently sat upon by the
Populist convention and treated with
scant respect.
Almost every leading Democrat who
has spoken has expressed his regret
that the Populists acted as they did.
John W. Mitchell, a true and tried
Democrat, although by reason of per
1 sonal feeling upon the part of a lead
; ing Populist his anti-monopoly record
i was questioned, unhesitatingly says,
in effect, that he was for Maguire. but
I the action of the Populists will cause
j the Simon pure Democrats to believe
that they are coerced into nominating
him, and thus cause bad feeling.
i ' James H. O'Brien, one of the old
timers of San Francisco Democracy,
'â¢ says- the same thing â and that In the
, language of Governor Budd it would
I be better to go down with the straight
i Democratic flag flying than to be the
â ; tail of any other political kite.
Eugene Deuprey, a supporter of
Judge Maguire, does not like to have
it appear as though the Democrats had
boen coerced by the Populists.
These gentlemen have expressed the
almost universal sentiment of Demo
crats outside of once in a while an
office-seeker who believes that his in
terests can be better boosted by boost
ing Maguire.
These men are not wanting in ex
amples. They point to the fact that
in 1879 those who had supported the
new constitution formed themselves
into a party with the avowed purpose
to place in power only those who had
advocated the adoption of the new
organic law. They called themselves
the "New Constitution" party. A con
vention was called and delegates were
sent to a convention at Sacramento.
The members were in earnest and al
most zealots in the cause for which
they were organized. But when the
convention met, although it had been
supposed that some one who had been
prominent in the fight for the adoption
of the new constitution would be nomi
nated for Governor, when the ballots
were counted it was found that Hugh
J. Glenn of Colusa had beaten by a few
votes J. V. Webster of Alameda.
Glenn was the largest farmer in the
State. Until then he had taken no part
in State politics.
J. V. Webster is the same Webster
! who was the last Populist nominee for
I Governor and recently defeated for
chairman of the convention at Sacra
mento. He had been a member of the
constitutional convention and was a
; stanch supporter of the adoption of the
constitution submitted to the people.
Before the meeting of the nominating
, convention it seemed as though he
i would be nominated by acclamation,
! but the Democratic politicians got in
then as they did Wednesday at Sacra
mento; they said Glenn had, supported
' the constitution; that he was^thorough
ly in accord with them in all material
matters; he would indorse the platform
and would do anything else required of
hirh. Their specious arguments availed.
I Glenn was nominated by a majority
about as small as that received by Ma
guire. There was a Democratic con
vention held later and after he had
been nominated by a very small major
ity a resolution was passed that no
other person should be put upon the
| ticket who had indorsed any other plat
! form. There was presented the specta-
I cle of a candidate for Governor on two
\ tickets not daring to support any other
[ man on either ticket with him. The
' result was what might have been fore
j seen â what it was two years ago in
I the case of Bryan and Sewall and
Bryan and Watson. Glenn was beaten
more than twenty thousand by Perkins.
The men who forced Maguire's nom
ination in the Populist convention have
taken the contract to have him nom
inated by the Democrats. But what of
the rest of the ticket? Will history re
peat itself? The Democrats who have
spoken seem to think it wilL
POPULISTS IN A SNARL
Shanahan May Not Have Been
Legally Made a Candidate
for Governor.
Lawyers of this city are much averse
to expressing opinions as to the law in
regard to the case of the bolting Popu
lists who nominated Shanahan at Sacra
mento, but the general belief is that his
nomination will be declared invalid If
the case is taken to the courts.
Garret McEnerney said he deHired to
give no deJinite opinion as to the law, but
stated that the chances were largely In
favor of a court declaring Shanahan's
nomination illegal. He said that the sec
tion of the Political Code on which the
fusionists ba.se their claim that the bolt
ers have violated the law has never been
repealed and Is consequently still in
force. The section is as follows:
No certificate of nomination shall contain
the name of more than one candidate for each
office to be filled. No person shall Join in
nominating, under the provisions of this code,
more than one nominee for each office to be
filled, and no person who has voted In a con
vention for or against a candidate for any
office thall join in nominating in any manner
any other nominee for that office, and no per
son shall accept a nomination to more than
one office.
This was passed in IS9I and is a portion
of the law in regard to the Australian
ballot system. The Penal Code provides
a penalty of fine and imprisonment for
the violation of any election law, but the
legal lights think that there could prob
ably be no .conviction for violation of the
above section, as it is hardly more than
a definition of what shall constitute a
valid certificate of nomination. Laymen
can hardly see the distinction and by
some it Is believed that the bolters have
overstepped the bounds of the law.
Attorney General Fitzgerald was called
upon at his home, 2226 California street,
but declined to give expression to any
opinion whatsoever on the subject. He
contended that his official position would
not permit it and said that it was a
matter more particularly for the courts
or District Attorney to consider. He
would give no opinion except called upon
in his official capacity.

MEAD'S HEAD FALLS
INTO, THE BASKET
HE IS OUSTED FROM THE MINT
BY TELEGRAPH.
Dismissed by the Secretary of the
Treasury Without Investiga
tion â The Victim May
Retaliate.
The head of Assistant Coiner M. H. Mead
of the Mint is now in that metaphorical
basket made for politicians and those
that love them.
Superintendent F. A. Leach yesterday
received a telegraphic announcement
from the Secretary of the Treasury that
Mr. Mead was dismissed from the service.
This action at Washington followed on
the arrival there of the documents in the
case forwarded from here.
As related a few days ago In The Call,
Coiner Spotts recently suspended Mead,
and in a report to Superintendent Leach
wrote: "I have reason to report a want
of fidelity and reason to suspect the in
tegrity of Michael H. Mead," and also
charged "dereliction of duty, delinquency
and misconduct in office," and recom
mended dismissal from the service.
No further particulars of ex-Senator
Mead's delinquencies were given out at
the Mint. Superintendent Leach forward
ed Coiner Spotts' order and recommenda
tion, with his own indorsement and with
testimony in the case which has not come
to light. It appears from the prompti
tude of the action at Washington that no
investigation was wanted.
"The incident is closed," was all that
Superintendent Leach was willing to say
about the case y-^terday. and as to the
succession the news obtainable was em
braced In the information that "some
names :ire being considered."
Mr. Mead was yesterday reported out
of town for a week, and his attorney,
Frank McGowan, was off on a trip to
Humboklt.
Mr. Mead's Intimate friends assert,
however, that he has by no means given
up the fight to hold his place and reputa
tion, and will carry the war even into
Washington.
CELEBRATED TWO
FOURTHS OF JULY
PASSENGERS ON THE GAELIC
JUGGLE WITH THE DAYS.
Miss Alice Neilsen Entertains With
Song Wjhile on the Ocean
Deep.
But few Americans have an opportunity
to celebrate two Fourths of July in the
same month of the same year. This Is
no paradox, as the passengers of the Gae
lic, which arrived yesterday from the
Orient, will attest. They had their first
Fourth of July when we were celebrating
the stirring victory of Schley at Santiago
and their second Fourth was sandwiched
in on the ISOth parallel.
All on board participated in the cele
bration on the ocean wave and so suc
cessful was the first day's jubilee that
the second Fourth was also given over
to fireworks and a popping of fizz bottles
by the more patriotic. The captain prom
ised to supply champagne for all on the
Fourth of July, and as there was much
debate as to which was the only genu
ine and exclusive Fourth his promise was
adjudged by a court of last resort to ex
tend to all Fourths that might occur in
the year 189 S.
The feature of the exercises was the
singing of "The Star-spangled Banner"
by Alice Nellson. She was costumed as
the Goddess vt Liberty and rendered
many of the patriotic songs of this coun
try, winning high praise from all. The
celebration was the most noteworthy
ever hold on board the Gaelic. All ap
proved of the twn days' celebration wit'i
the exception of an Englishman, who did
not think it was quite the proper thing
He agreed with the rest that the Fourth
of July was a great day, but he could
see neither rhyme nor reason in running j
it throuKh forty-eight hours. J
SANTA ROSA'S
CITY OF TENTS
Canvas Spread at Camp
Montgomery.
READY FOR ITS OCCUPANTS
OUTING OF THE LEAGUE OF THE
CROSS CADETS.
Pretty Spot Selected for the rendez
vous of the Young Men und
Their Expected
Visitors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, July 15.â Camp Mont
gomery, as the beautiful spot chosen
for the summer outing of the League
of the Cross Cadets will be known, is
fast taking the appearance of a mili
tary rendezvous. The advance guard,
consisting of thirty men under the
command of Lieutenants Mahoney and
Carroll, arrived last night in full
marching order, with knapsacks and
rolled blankets on their backs, and
marched to Camp Montgomery, where
they passed the night.
Bright and early this morning the
first of the 120 tents which arrived on
Thursday were erected In their proper
positions. The march was continued
all day and to-night the city of tents
gives a fair idea of the view which the
first sight of "Camp Montgomery" will
present to the main body of the cadets
when they arrive to-morrow night.
The spot chosen for the carrip is In
the rear of the beautiful park known
as the City Gardens, situated only a
few blocks from the center of the city.
The boys will be camped right on the
banks of Santa Rosa Creek, and as the
park is supplied running water,
electric lights and a splendid dancing
platform, the accommodations are all
that could be desired.
Colonel Adolph Huber, who has
charge of the commissary department,
was among the first arrivals upon the
scene. Having had charge of the same
branch of the work during the lust sea
son's encampment he appreciates the
enormity of the contract he has on his
hands in feeding the 400 young men
who will spend the coming week in this
city, and he proposes to take no
chances of not being properly prepared
for their arrival. He already has the
long tables arranged in the way they
are to be placed, and the camp kitchen
was this morning tested for the first
time. It was found to work admira
bly, and his corps of assistants ex
pressed themselves as pleased with the
arrangements.
The main body of the cadets, about
400 strong, will arrive on the 6 o'clock
train Saturday evening. They will
bring their own splendid band. During
the week many out-of-town visitors
will be their guests. Excursions from
San Francisco have been arranged and
plans for accommodating the visitors
at the regular mess tables have been
perfected.

o'clock this morning the public school
I house was discovered on fire. The alarm
\ was given and the fire company responded

Both fires were started by Charles
; Wedgewood, a young man whose parents
1 reside here. He was committed to the
Insane asylum at Napa about a year ago,
but was let out on a furlough a week ago.
He confessed the crime and told how he
started both fires. The people of the town
: censure the officials at Napa who allowed
i him to leave the institution.
The school house was built at a cost of
' $0000. and there was an insurance policy
! for $3600 unon It. The other building's de
i stroyed were not insured.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 15.â The bears who coy- '
ered their short contracts in haste yesterday I
afternoon on the fall of Santiago sold stocks j
again to-day and raided prices down with none
to Fay them nay. The bull element refrained
entirely from offering any support, and prices :
of the whole list dropped away easily and
without any Important Interruption. There
Was an entire absence of any outside interest, !
and dealings were very small and confined to
a narrow list. The sharp break In Metropolitan
Street Railway in the afternoon accentuated
the general weakness and the bears were ap- j
parently content to leave their contracts open !
over night, for there was no covering move- j
ment manifest. The closing was near the low
est, with net losses. in many cases a point or
mnre. A break in Metropolitan Street Railway
was accompanied by rumors that the addi
tional issue would be $15,000,000, Instead of |
$in,ooo,oo'>, as heretofore reported. The state
ment of earnings for the June quarter was also
considered disappointing. The stock went, down
easily and closed only one point above the
lowest. .V. very large amount of stock was j
dislodged by this sharp decline, business being I
confined almost entirely to I'M share lots on the |
break. The recent weakness of the coalers also i
persisted, the offerings of [leading first pre
ferred Indicating some continued liquidation of
long stock. People's Gas was also prominent
for weakness. There is a growing feeling in |
the stock market that the successful termina- i
tion of the war and peace with Spain have I
been discounted. The reception both of the I
destruction of Admiral ("ervera's fleet and of
the fall of Santiago point to this conclusion.
Vail street entirely Ignored the disposition of
London to buy American stocks on Toral's I
surrender and th* advancing tendency of
Spanish 4s on the talk of peace. The definite
assurance that none but individual bids for
probably not more than (5000 would secure any ;
portion of the Government loan had no appre
ciable effect in the money market to-day. The
New York banks have lost nearly $4,000,000 to !
the sub-treasury during the week on account i
of the loan, but there is no pressure for money i
from interior points.
There was a further falling oft In the bond
transactions and prices yielded In the late j
dealings. Total Bales, $2,625
United States old 4s declined '4 per cent In
the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 219,7-">0

markets were firm during the day, but closed
dull. Spanish 4s touched 3SÂ»i. but closed at 37.
the bonds being offered for sale on disquieting
reports from Madrid about the proclaiming of ,
a military dictatorship.
Americans fell back to-day In the absence,
of New York support, not the least inclination
being shown here to buy. Many, however,
still showed gains on the day. Stagnation

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. July Hradatreefs Finan
cial Review will say: More than customary
irregularity prevailed In the market this week.
At its conclusion there was marked weakness
developed on the basis of the surrender of i
Santiago and the apparent willingness of the
j Madrid Government to negotiate. Before this
! point had been reached, however, the market |
I passed through several changes of speculative i
I sentiment. In the beginning of the- week it ]
1 was strong on the belief that Santiago would ;
soon be taken, but by Wednesday it experi- ]
enced a depression on the reports of a yellow ;
fever outbreak among the American troops i
there. At the same time there has been a .
' strong undertone, though the public has been
; Inactive, and London was, up to Friday, a ;
I considerable seller here. Activity in the stock
! list has also suffered from the stamp tax and
the professional element In the board room and ;
"street" have adoptedÂ» bonds as a speculative |
vehicle, owing to the fact that transactions I
in the latter are not subjected to the stamp
tax.' This resulted in very active buying in a
number of classes of railroad bonds, the trans
i fer of speculative Intention to that part of the !
market having a tendency to improve values |
of bonds all around. There was the best atten- :
, tion paid to matters apart from war news than I
; for some weeks back. The great success of I
I the Government bond subscription must, how- j
ever, be counted among the bullish factors,
I and has given financial interests generally de
| cided satisfaction. The absence of disturb- j
ance in the money market from this cause
would prevent it having, however, any Imme
diate effects upon speculation, though the be- I
lief Is that the success of the loan and Its
having been entirely absorbed by individual
subscribers, will bring large amounts of cor- !
poration funds, which have been held to pay,
; for new bonds, back into the general Invest- j
ment market. The crop news and rumors have \
ceased to be much of a factor in the market, ;
; but. on the other hand, a good deal of atten- ;
tion has been paid to the reports of rate cut- ;
ting, which, with the decreases In gross earn- |
ings which many roads are displaying for the
present, has created some bearish sentiment
ion railroad stocks. This has not taken the I
: form of selling of the granger and trunk lino
shares. On the contrary. Its effect has been to j
turn the speculation more completely toward :
industrials and bonds, while the weak feature
was supplied by coal stocks.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 15.â Wheat started with ;
' prices a shade easier on lower Liverpool cables
j and exceptionally fine weather for threshing
i and marketing the new grain. The weakness
1 did not last long, however, as the Corn mar
j ket quickly developed strength on a report
i that the Corn was not affected by drought In
many sections, and this soon had Its reflec
tion in Wheat. It was found while the arrivals
I of new Wheat were on the increase they could
j by no means be called liberal, and were being
taken freely. This, together with the fact
that July still holds at a big premium, caused
a growing reluctance to sell September at the ,
j discount, and shorts were disposed to cover.
Thin business of covering was largely by the \
scalping element. The big traders held off, ;
recently having little confidence In the present
strength and yet feeling that the short side !
: was hardly safe so long as the new crop was
moving so slowly and the premium was 90 well
maintained. There was not much Wheat for
sale, and hence the comparative firmness. Sep- 1
tember closed %g%c higher.
Continued dry weather, with favorable pros
pect of more of It. was sufficient to affect the
Corn market for an advance. The opening
trades were at about yesterday* closing figures
but quickly began to Improve, and while some
realizing sales caused Â»ie reaction after a lc
advance, the strongest phase was In the mar
ket during the last half hour. A big business
was done In cash Corn and shippers found diffi
â  culty in picking up cargo lots. Hipteinber
! closed with an advance of l^(&:iÂ»ic.
The firmness In Oats was due to the strength
displayed In Corn. September roÃe %c on the
day.
The consideration In Provisions won a good
1 cash demand, both domestic and foreign, to
gether with the high prices for hogs at the
yards. Pork left off 10Â®12%c up and lard and
ribs 2%c each.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. July 16.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say in to-mor
row's issue: The destruction of a Spanish fleet
and Europe's quick appreciation of the feat,
the wearying flags of truce at Santiago and
at last the surrender, have all Influenced some
markets day by day. Hut Americans have
grown and traders see that not many outside
matters greatly Influence the husiness which
enables them to market $1,210,274,015 worth of
domestic products abroad in a yar, against
6616,012,844 worth Imported. The new loan has
proved a stupendous success, over $1,300,000,000
having been subscribe*], and It is now the
question of chief Interest whether any banks
will get enough, after personal subscriptions
have been accepted, to support further circula
tion. Industries and business are at the natu
rally lowest point for the year, and therefore
the records are the more impressive.
The decrease )n the output of piglron from
21.". "s tr.ns weekly June 1. to 216.311 July 1.
mostly due to usual stoppages fur repairs a
little before July 1. carries with It a decrease I
of 4L'1 I 5 tons weekly In unsold stocks. If the
first and last of the month so presented the
average production, the quantity consumed In
manufacture would be 3.S per cent less than i
th>' highest ever attained In May. a small de- I
crease for midsummer, but. In fact, the aver- â 
Bge production was larÃer and the increase in ;
consumption was smaller. Just when stagna
tion Is customary very many mills are crowded
with orders for months, the Illinois rail mills
until December or later, with Bales this week
of 15,<XiO tons, and structural works with a few
contracts for lO.CkiO tons or more, while a larger
demand appears for cars and sheets and better
demand for bars at the Went. A heavy sale of ,
billets fn>m Pittsburg to Eastern Pennsylvania
at a concession of 50 cents is the only real de
cline !n quotations, though Eastern steel bar?
ar>- a shade lower. It Is still between seasons
: for wool, but a few larye purchases Indicate
( some disposition for business, and the demand
' for woolen Roods is better, though prices for
i some have been reduced and the competition '
â  as to series seems likely to be excessive. Sales
I of wnol were but 7,441.000 pounds, 5.521.200 being
domestic, for two weeks of July, against 24,
fi"2.&00 pounds lost year, of which 11.y60.600 were
domestic. One sale of 1.500.000 pounds of Ter
'. rltory at price? lower than are being paid by
Boston parties In Montana looks like business ;
In the future. Wheat has been dropping In '
1 price under estimates of 880.000,000 to 700,000,- j
000 bushels this year, which seem to be at least .
well warranted, as over conservative estimates :
rum" from the same parties last year. West
ern receipts are moderate as yet, but the At- !
lantlc exports for the week were 1,719,759 bush
els, flour Included, against 1,611.490 last year,
and Pacific Coast exports 521,514 bushels. '
against 130, 763 bushels last year, and for two ,
woeks the ex ports from both coasts have been
1.K84.412 bushels, against 3.587.909 last year. The
foreign outlook has much Improved and the
decline In price during the week was about
E Â«â¢â¢ nts for spot and SVic for nearest option.
Failures for the week ending July 7 were
t1.8M.854 In amount. 1946.411 manufacturing and
$W!),7iJ3 trading. Failures for the week have
l.orn 21." In the United States, against 263 last
' yi-fir, and In Canada 23, against 27 last year.
BRADSTRKET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July I.".â Brndstreet'B to-mor
row will sny: Pending the Initiation of new
I fall buHiness, preparations for which are ac
i tivcly under wuy in many markets, there ex- ]
Ists quite a mldnummer condition. Accom- j
panlitd. however, In most cases by price steadi- i
j ness nnd confidence in a promising outlook for I
fall trudo. Retrospection and review continue
to furnish many transactory illustrations of
I tho favorable conditions during the first half
i of the present year, some of which seem bound
to be duplicated during the second half. While
there was ltttlÂ»< reason to expect anything like
the excited buying Â°f cereals this year which
occurred last season, the world's wheat crops
; all pointing to exceptionally large If not record I
. breaking yields, still the situation of carried
over supplies, visible and Invisible, Is such as
to lend to confidence In a good demand for
most of this country's surplus, thongh the out
look favors a considerable shading of prices
! obtained from such products,
j There Is a little more hopeful feeling In the
Iron and steel trade, the result partly* of re
! d,uced output nnd stocks on pig, and partly ow
ing to the large business reported offering, '
, particularly at th<- AVest. where pome mills
will fon'go their usual summer shutdowns, and
others will curtail the vacation period materi
ally.
More Is doing In steal, and some Western mills
1 are reported booked for orders until next wln
i ter. Some large export orders are reported
I from Chicago. Except for some shading in
: cereals, caused by the usual tendency to dls
! count Government crop reports and look for
i larger than indicated crop yields, the price \
j situation Is one of considerable steadiness.
Contradictory reports come as to the volume
of export trade In wheat and corn at the de
cline, but a good business for this time of the
year Is undoubtedly doing. The movement of
I now wheat at the Southwest Is also freer,
though farmers are rather independent at pres
ent prices.
Trnde continues of a midsummer dullness at
! the East, hut more Inquiry for raw wool Is a
j feature, and prices are well maintained on a
! fairly large business for this time of the year.
: Features of the trade movement at the West
: are the proposed demand for Iron and steel nt
i Chicago. Louisville and St. Ixiuls report the
; fall trnde outlook as good.
| Our exports still continue In excess of cor
' responding periods of previous yenrs. wheat
| and flour shipments aggregating 2.910,287 bush
els, as against 2.725,4fi2 last week, and compar
ing with 1.522.092 bushels â¢-> this week a year
! ago; 2.953.949 bushels in 1896: 1.652,892 bushels in
i JOS, and U87J.850 bushels In 1R94.
Business failures in the T'nlted States number
23R as against 241 last week: 247 In this week
a year ago, 255 In 1596, 214 in 1895. Business
failures In Canada number 2SI against 16 last

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS â  FRUITS.
It looks as If there would be a boom In Bart
| lett Pears. The crop Is light everywhere, and
I along the river, where the greater part come
from every year, there Is no crop at all worth
speaking of. The canners have raised their
bids In the Santa Clara Valley to $30 per ton,
but with indifferent success, as the growers
are not selling. The trade look for still higher
prices.

weak. Berries are doing better, arrivals being
light.

County Equalizers Take
a New Departure.
MITCHELL AS A LAWYER
OVERRIDES THE OPINION OF
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.
Railroad Applications Are Disposed
Of With More Alacrity
Than for Years
Past.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
008 Broadway, July 15.
E. Black Ryan, ; >x agent of the South
ern Padflc, made his* customary annual
visit to the Board of Equalization this
afternoon. He did not bring so much ma
terial as usual, nor tiid lie tile his ordinary
number of applli ations for reductions of
assessments. He practically conceded that
the assessment of railroad property as
adjusted last year by the County Board
:s about Just, ajid asked that it bo main
tained for this year, although the Asses
sor has added largely to those ligures.
The company asked for a reduction on
the broaii-sraupre ferry depot from $125,000
to $86,000. It \\iia reduced to $115,000. On
the improvements at the end of Long 1
wharf the assessment was $16,000. A re
s7ooo was asked, and the board
'. The narrow-gauge
was assessed ai $45,000. Mr. Ryan
. that it v d last year, on
motion of Mr. Roeth, to $25,000, and they
asked for the same figures this year. The
applli granted.
The water front property next came up,
and a dispute followed as to the legality
of the descriptions of the property and as
to whether the Assessor's descriptions
would legally carry a tax, District At
torney Snook decided that the descriptions
were defective and that no tax could be
levied on them. Mr. Roeth wanted the
Supervisors to go and view the property,
to that they could form personal opinions.
None .i the other members seemed to
consider this necessary, and Mr. Roeth
could eel no second to his motion. Chair
man Mitchell said that ac no member
would make a motion either to reduce or
sustain the assessment it would go before
the committee of the whole. Roetb said
that he would not go into committee,
as he did not think it necessary, and the
matter was passed.
In previous years the railroad assess
ments have occupied the time of the board
for several weeks, and ambitious poli
ticians have taken advantage of the inci
dent to make cheap political records. This
year there is an evident desire on the
part of the board to prevent such small
methods, and applications are being dealt
with very expeditiously.
When the railroad's tax agent asked
for reductions on the ferry boats assess
ments they were denied.
Applications for reductions on the Oak
land Railroad Company's franchise, the
Berkeley local, the sidetracks at Niles,
Irvingto'n and Newark and the Seventh-
Btreet local franchise were denied by the
vote of Mitchell. Roeth and Wells. Church
and Talcott voted to reduce.
The nth-street local and the Berke
ley local are assessed for $735,000 and
,000. They have never been oh the coun
ty assesment roll before, and Supervisor
Mitchell changed his vote this year, stat
ing that he aid so to give the railroad
company a chance to take the matter into
the courts.
Mr. Mitchell in explaining his change of
vote said: â  , , ....
â¢â¢The question before us is . simply this:
Are the pieces of steam railroad known
es the Seventh-street local and the Berke
ley ranch to be assessed by the State
Board of Equalization as is other road
way of the railroads in this county, or are j
they to be assessed by the County Assess
or?" If they are parts of a railroad oper
ated in more than one county in the State,
the constitution says they shall be as
tepsed by the State Board of Equalization
and not by the County Assessor. The Dis- j
trii~t Attorney las year advised and still
adises that the facts show these pieces of
railroad are parts of a railroad operated
In more than one county in the State, and
h^nce have no place on the county assess
ment rolls, and that it is our duty to re
move them.
"Now, 1 followed this advice last year
because I believed that under the consti
tution the State Board alone had the right
to assess this property. I still think bo.
There are a great ma people, however,
in this community who erroneously think
that the Seventh-street local and the
Berkeley branch escaped assessment last
year because we voted to remove them
from the county assessment rolls. This is
a mistake. The State Board of Equaliza
tion assessed them and the county re
ceived Its share of the tax. It is a fact,
however, that if these pieces of railroad |
could be assessed by the County Assessor
we would get a larger revenue. The con
stitutional provision has never been passed
upon by the courts and some people think I
it might be decided that the County As- j
sessor is the one to make the assessment j
and that this property ought to be left on â 
the roll so that a test might be made. I '
am not a lawyer and I am willing that
the courts should pass upon this question â 
and settle it once for all. For that reason
only I vote to sustain the assessment. I
still believe the County Assessor has no
right under the constitution to assess this
property, and I predict the courts will s.i
decide. I wish to say further that in case
this matter is taken Into the courts and
is not decided by next year, and this prop
erty again appear^ upon the assessment i
roll I shall vote to remove it." i

The appraisement of the estate of the
late George W. Patterson was filed this i
afternoon. It is one of the largest es
tates ever offered for probate in Alameda

Another Special Meeting of the
Board of Trustees to Be Held
This Evening.
ALAMEDA, July 15-Anni^' i,
meeting of the CitY KStSKS ffSS
this evening to 'â¢* Om Â« action with re
gard to the use of the Alice street brides
for team and pedestrian traffic while the
Webster street structure Is being rebuilt
The burden of the cost of converting the
bridge from a railroad to a wason struc
ture must fall upon Alameda, unless sor^e
Wean be found to persuade OakllnH?
the Supervisors to stand part of the coat
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
On the Oakland side all that is necessary
is a little grading, which can be done at
nnminal cost. On the Alameda side, how
ever, a tnstle must be built across part
of the marsh from the present Webster
street grade to the railroad bed at Alice
street bridge. As the maintenance of
communication Is largely for the benefit
of Oakland in much greater proportion
than for Alameda, the people or this city
think that at least an equal division of
the cost should be made. It is thought,
too, that the Supervisors have no right
to shut up one bridge without providing
another.
However, as both Councils are to meet
this evening and are to report to the Su
pervisors on Monday, It is expected that
some way out of the trouble will be
found which will be mutually satisfac
tory.
DEEDED BY MISi'AKE.
The Realty Syndicate Returns J. S.
Emery His Rightful Land
Interest.
OAKLAND. July 15.â The Realty Syndi
cate to-day released the old Emery es
tate, valued at $600,000, to J. S. and Amelia
M. Emery. The realty includes the Watts
tract, a large tract on San Pablo avenue
near Park avenue, block No. 9 on Park
avenue, a large tract at Park avenue and
Taven street, block No. 14 bounded by
Yerba Buena avenue and Hollis street,
another block directly opposite on Hollls
street, a portion of block No. 23 in thÂ«
same section, and a tract bordering along
the right of way of the Northern Railway
Company. Besides these, there are fifteen
other tracts of similar size situated la
the same section of country.
The Realty Syndicate purchased thÂ«
property from Mr. Emery In March or
last year subject to a heavy indebtedness
secured by a trust deed to Henry C.
Campbell and Thaddeus B. Kent. On
April U of this year the company satisfied
the claim and the parties named recon

COACHMAN ENDS HIS
LIFE IN A STABLE
O. ROBERTSON IS FOUND DEAD
ON THE MEEK RANCH.
Was Hanging From a Baiterâ No
Reason Can Be Given for His
Desire to Suicide.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. July 15.
O. Robertson, . coachman for Harry
Meek at San Lorenzo, committed suicide
last night by hang-ins himself In the har
ness room on the Meek ranch.
Last evening the Chinese cook passed
the stable and saw a buggy standing on

i that the buggy was still in the same posi
tion and had not been washed, and he
looked around for the coachman. He
! opened the door and saw Robertson
I hanging from a large hook in the wall.
! The coachman was dead, and after bring
| ing a few other employes to the stable
the Chinaman cut the body down and it
w:is taken to the branch morgue.

employment office, lie said he recently
came ; om the East and told some of the
! men that he was quite satisfied with his
j position. He did not drink and sceme-1 to

! can be given for his suicide, except th.a
i at times he had acted in an absent-mhid
ed r.anrer.
Deceased was a native of Sweden and
! wa3 about 42 years -of age. So tar as can
be i earn eel he was unmarried.
Woodward With a Deciding Vote.
OAKLAND, July 15.â result of the
proposed ordinance reducing the liquor
license from -$100 to $50 per quarter- is not
assured 'by v the~'eonlmittee's'- favorable
recommendation. The men counted on to
favor the measure are Councilmen Henne
berry, Karl, "Watkinson. Brosnahan and
Heitman. Councilmen Upton, Rowe, Cu
velller, Glrard and Pringle are counted on
to oppose the measure. This leaves
Councilman Woodward with the deciding
vote. When asked to-day he replied that
he was open to argument, but thought
it best to let good enough alone. He felt
that his attempt to reduce the license
would act as a boomerang upon the sa
loon men.
Cigarettes More Fatal Than Whisky.
OAKLAND, July 15.â "1 believe that
cigarettes are killing more men to-day
than whisky," was the astonishing re
mark made by Councilman Henneberry
last, evening when his ordinance- to pro
hibit the sale or giving away of cigar
ettes to minors or the smoking of the
same by minors in the streets or other
public places was being considered by the
Ordinance and Judiciary Committee.
"They are responsible for the reject
of so many of our boys," he continued,
"who apply for admission to the army.
I believe that it is an evil that should
be suppressed." The rest of the commit
tee agreed with him and the ordinance
was recommended for passage. â

The Congressman Makes

HIS OPPONENT ON A TOUR
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE IS
CALLED TOGETHER.
Keen Contest Developing for the
Seat in the County Committee
Vacated by Tom.
Robinson.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 15.
The Third District Congressional Com
mittee will meet In this city a week from
next Monday, which Is two days after the
mettlng of the State Central Committee.
As Oakland has two candidates for Con
gressman from this district the details of
the primaries are naturally of great lo
cal interest, and neither Mr. Metcalf nor
Mr. Hilborn feels that he can do any
more than very general work until the
method and date of the primaries are
fixed. They can then go ahead, arrange
their ticket for the seven counties in the
district and prepare for the linal struggle
at the polls.
It is very probable that the committee
will decide to hold the primary at the
same time that delegates are elected to
the Republican State Convention. In
such event they would have separate offi
cers and separate ballot boxes, but the
polling booths would bo the same, and
by following such a method it Is believed
a large vote will be polled and a fair ex
pression of the district obtained. Mr. Hil
born, who is in Washington, is not ex
pected here for Borne time, but his
friends, headed by W. H. Friend, who
will succeed to the Oakland postmaster
ship in two weeks, are busy distributing
copies of his record in Congress, claim
ing that this is the best foundation on
which to base a claim for renewal of
support.
v ictqr H. Metcalf, Mr. Hilborn's oppo
nent, is now making a tour of the dis
trict in the interest of his candidacy for
the nomination. He is putting much per
sonal effort into the campaign, and, like
Mr. Hilborn's friends, is very confident.
The County Committee will not meet
until the State Committee has decided on
the details of time, place and apportion
ment of delegates of the State conven
tion. At the present time the choice of
the County Committee Is supposed to be
about equally divided between W. R. Da
vis and Dr. Pardee. T. M. Robinson, from
the Fifth Ward, has announced himself
as a candidate for Tax Collector, and in
accordance with a resolution adopted at
the county convention four years ago, h^
must resign from the committee. He says
he intends to do this as soon as it meets.
This will lt-ave twelve members in the
County Committee, and naturally, as they
are evenly divided, the new man will have
the deciding vote.
As there Is much to be done in arrang
ing for the primaries, a majority of tho
County Committee can materially assist
or hinder the chances of either guberna
torial candidate, and hence the struggle
for the seventh vote, will be very bitter.
The candidates at present are ex-Super
visor Johnston, who is a Davis man. and
Clarence Crowell. who is a Pardee man.
It is probable that neither of these wi.ll
be appointed by the balance of the com
mittee.
OXFORDS TRIBUTE.
The English University Compliments
the State University at Berkeley.
BERKELEY. July 15.â Oxford Univer
sity has already shown publicly its appre
ciation of the significance of the far
reaching architectural plans which are
being made for the enlargement of the
University of California. This feeling
1 was manifested at the commemorative
exercises of the great English university
held on the 22d of last month. The public
i orator. Dr. W. M. Merry, rector of Lin
coln College, in his Latin address, made
a very complimentary reference to the l\i
ture which lay before the institution at
Berkeley. He foresaw tho great results
of the full development of these plans,
which, he said, would require a long time,
: but were sure of success If designed upon
a consistent system. He especially ad
mired the direction to the architects "to
spare no expense" In adopting the plans
to the unique marine site.
President Martin J. Kellogg says he
feels the Incident is especially notewor
thy as an additional token of the kindly
i feeling of English scholars. He thinks
it all the more gratifying as Dr. Merry's
words- were heartily applauded by the
learned commemoration audience.
A Frenchman's Valuable Gift.
BERKELEY, July IS.â The library of

house in Rome. The Due do Loubat be
came interested in the University of Cali
fornia during a recent visit here, and this
is not the first of the favors he has ac

YOUNG OSBORN NOT ROBBED.
Attorney Pistolesi Vents His Opinion
of Secretary Frank J. Kane.
Frank J. Kane, secretary of the Pacific
Society for the Suppression of Vice, is
handled without gloves by Attorney L. C.
Pistolesi. who charges him with making
an untrue statement when he said that
Frank Osborn was being defrauded out
of three estates by George and John Engel
and Mary A. Druschel.
The attorney, in behalf of the Engels,
who are well and favorably known in the
community, makes the following state
ment:
Frank Osborne la 21 years of age, and since
his birth has been clothed and provided for by
the Kngels without compensation. Osborn' s
grandfather, Henry J. T. Engel, died in 1892,
and left a small estate which he devised by
will to his wife and children. Osborn was not
mentioned In the will. In 1893 his uncle, J. T.
Engel, died, leaving a will in which he left
Osborn a quarter Interest, appraised at $75, in
a email cottage on Haven street. This estate
was duly distributed and Osborn was given his
share. Early this year his grandmother died
intestate, leaving surviving her three children,
one of whom was appointed administrator of
her estate. As a question of law is Involved,
however, the estate comes before the court
on the 20th of July, not having as yet been dis
tributed, Mr. Kane's sworn statement to the
contrary, notwithstanding. When Mr. Kane
desired the court to save him the expenditure
of lliing a petition, he swore that Osborn was
a pauper and had no estate or means. Kane
was ty the court forced to withdraw his peti
tion. Again, when the matter came up* in
Judge Hunt's court on a new petition filed by
Kane a sworn statement was filed that a cita
tion had been duly served on Frank Osborn.
This statement was proved to be false, and
after investigation by the court the citation
was dismissed.
The&e are but a few instances of the good
faith of Mr. Kane, who. while posing as a de
fcnoer of one whom none seek to injure, does
not hesitate to traduce an honorable family.
FAMOUS STARS
FOR THE TIVOLI
A LIST OF CELEBRATED GRAND
OPERA SINGERS.
The Season Which Will Open Next
Month Will Be a Note
worthy One.
"Doc" IjÂ«ahy, manager of the Tivoll
Opera Company, returned from the East
last night after an absence of several
weeks. The trip has been anything but
one of leisure, judging from the amount
of business transacted, for the doctor has
secured a number of stars for the grand
opera Efason, which will be-fin on August
1; and the labors attendant upon collect
ing them in a constellation have reduced
the Tivoli's manager ten pounds or more.
The present aggregation of operatic
singers is by far the most noted that the
Tivoli has ever brought together. Marie |
Brandis, formerly with the Damrosch !
Opera Company, will be the leading prima !
â  donna. Anne Lichter, at one time prima |
; donna of the Tavary Company, is another
jof the stars. Mary Linck, a contralto oi
! rare ability, forms the third of a trio as
strong as are seen in the biggest opera
companies of this country. An attempt has
â  been made to secure the services of Ber
| nice Holmes and it is very probable that
she will again grace the Tivoli boards.
The male singers are of equal reputa- !
tion, some of thi-m occupying a lofty rung
i on the ladder of operatic fame. Signor
Edgardo Zerni will head the list of tenors.
He Is an Italian, lately arrived from Italj
' but sings with facility in English, French I
| and German. Ernest Brazil Is another i
! tenor whom the TlviOi Management has ;
engaged for the coming season. Critics
place this young man in the class of the ;
De Rezskes. Maurice De Vries, the bari- !
tone, is well known to the San Francisco ]
public and does not need an introduction.
The other baritones will be William ;
Pruett, the much-sought-after singer, who
; has a reputation which places him among *
j the foremost operatic stars of the day ,
j The bassos will be Signor Wan roll and
| William Schusslcr, both of whom have !
won their laurels in the very best com-!
panics before the public.
The season will begin with a presenta- '
tion of "Aida," followed by "Queen of j
j Sheba," "La Boheme," "Carmen," I
"Faust," "RigolettO," "Huguenots" "rial
Juive," "La wavarraise," "William Tell " I
"Manon Lescaut," "Lohengrin." "Gio
conda," "Mignon," "Romeo and Juliet "
; and Boito's "Meflstofele."
DRUGGED BEER LOST
PRIVATE PILE'S PILE
DID NOT REMEMBER HIS WATER
FRONT EXPERIENCE.
In View of His Previous Good Repu
tation Judge Mogan Gives
Him His Liberty.
Oscar C. Pile of Company A, Sixth Cal
ifornia Regiment, was up before Judgo
Mogan yesterday on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon. He was repre
sented by Attorney Barrett.
Pile ran amuck on the water front
Tuesday night and fired a shot at Police
men P.ailey and Dower in the yard of the
saloon 231 Kant street. He had a revol
ver in each hand and after he> entered
the saloon by the rear door and while
the policemeivand the bartender, Charles
J. Anderson, were attempting to take
the weapons from him one was accident
ally dischnrged and the bullet went
through Anderson's hand.
In his defense Pile said he came to the
city Tuesday to buy a revolver. He I
bought one at Shreve's gun store, and |
later another from a friend on Folsom
street. He had a valise with him and in
the evening he was in a saloon on Sac
ramento street, when he met a man who
showed him a Grand Army badge. They
had a glass of beer together and then ho :
asked the Grand Army man to drink with
him again. After that he remembered
nothing more till he found himself in the
City Prison. He felt sure the second glass ;
of beer was drugged, as his purse \
was emptied of its contents and his valise
was Stolen.
Major Grant of the Sixth Regiment tes- ;
tl!!< <1 that he had known Pile since he
was a boy. Pile and his brother owned a â 
big ranch on Roberts Island near Stock- ,
ton, and the major gave Pile a splendid
character for peace and quiet, which was |
supplemented by Captain Dksher of
Company A. Sheriff Cunningham of I
Stockton also sent a U-logram to the i
Judge speaking highly of Pile's character. I
As it was proved by Anderson, the bar
keeper, that Pile was accompanied by
another man whtn he. entered the saloon
from the rear and it was arguod that the i
other man might have llred the shot at
the policemen the Jinlge, In view of that
fact and Pile's previous good character, j
gave him the benefit of the doubt and i
dismissed the case.

CHILD KILLS
A BIG RATTLER
Adventure in a Camp at
Niles Canyon.
GRACE JORDAN IS PLUCKY
FOUGHT THE REPTILE TO A FIN-
ISH WITH A CLUB.
Brought the Battles Back to Camp
as Proof of Her Narrow
Escape From the
Fangs.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, July 15.
Grace Jordan, the 15-year-old daughter
of County Clerk Jordan, had a fierce
struggle this afternoon with a large rattle
i Bnake in Niles Canyon and succeeded in
| killing the reptile. The Jordans are camp
i ing at Stonybrook, near Nlles, and this
afternoon Grace, who has inclinations
similar to those of Diana and Nimrod,
went off on a hunting expedition.
The young lady has a record for using
the rifle and also is quite an authority on
fly fishing. When about half a mile from
their camp she heard a noise in the brush
and at once went to investigate.
To her surprise she found a large rattle
snake, which reared its vicious tietÂ»d $y-.d
hissed at her. The encouragement to
fight the animal overcame any fears she
might have had and Miss Jordan grasped
a stick and started to beat the viper. For
a few mfnut'.s the battle was lively, for
she was able to hit the rattler In almost
eveiy part of its body but a vital part.
Several times tho poisonous fangs were
Within a few inches â¢Â£ her flesh, but she
succeeded in beating Jk off and finally
! gave it a blow on the head which stunÂ»ed
I it. after which it was speedily killed.
The young lady brought the tail of the
â  animal, containing ten large rattles, into
I camp as proof of her adventure. This is
i the largest rattler seen in the canyon foi
several years, and in the locality W'het-e
the Jordans are camping it was thought
that the reptiles had become extinct-
ARE PREPARING FOR
THE NEXT CAMPAIGN
REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMIT
TEE ORGANIZING ITS MEN.
Representatives Appointed to Facili
tate the Naturalization and
Registration of Voters.
The members of the Republican County
Committee are preparing against the day
when they -will be in the heat of the
forthcoming campaign, in which both lo
cal and State officers "will be elected. The
regular meeting of the committee was
held on Thursday and but few delegates
were noted absent by Secretary P. H.
Prondergast.
The small registration up to the pres
ent time is causing the leaders of the
party much anxiety and strong efforts
will be put forth to stir up the citizens
to a sense of their duty in the premises.
The total registration at present does not
exceed ten thousand names. At a corre
sponding period in the last campaign it
totaled some, thirty thousand voters. As
the registration closes on the 15th of Au
gust the time is short in which to make
up this wide discrepancy.
In order to facilitate the naturnlization
and registration of persons in sympathy
with the Republican party T. D. Riordan,
who presided in the absence of Chairman
Chariea W. Manwarlng, appointed the
following committee: J. F. Ahearn, chair
mnn: Felix Dugan, P. J. Walsh, P. H.
Prendergast and P. E. McCarthy.
Upon motion of Harry X. Gray it was
determined to open campaign headquar
ters at once in some central location.
The matter was placed in the hands of
the officers, who will select an abiding
place for the committee immediately.
It was announced that names of men
wlix> will act in the booths on election day
must be submitted not later than next
Wednesday, to the end that they may be
submitted to the Board of Election Com
missioners. The list sent in by the coun
ty committee will be accepted without
question by the commissioners. A motion
by L. E. Savage that the county commit
tee be especially represented before the
election commissioners drew forth the
only discussion of the evening. It was
strongly opposed by Jesse Marks and
others on the ground that the Republican
party was well represented. On his
showing the motion was withdrawn. The
reorganized Republican County Committee
for the forthcoming campaign follows:
J. F. Ahearn, Grove P. Ayers, G. Bacigalupl,

Beachwood was the star performer of

race and was not much outclassed after |
all. He made bad breaks, but showed i
heaps of ppee.l. The winner was at 1 to j

Gaff Topsail at 3 to 5 to win It. Again :

grandslre was that famous campaigner,
Palo Alto, 2:05%. so no wonder. Lady Â«;
went, a very good race and must have
beaten 2:25 each heat. Dr. Frasse was at
1 to ;; In the betting and sold at 10 to 3 I
in the auctions over the bunch. He
should reach 2:15 this season and is the
best of his age yet shown hereabouts.
President Knight's three-year-old Lyn

PRIDE OF NORTH POINT.
The Nellie C, a Slood Yacht Constructed hu Three
Lads at Spare Moments,
i The Nellie C, a sloop yacht, will be launched from the foot of Stockton
: Street, at North Reach, on Sunday, July 31. The Juvenile element, and for
â  that matter, adults as well, in the entire, neighborhood will rolebrate the
â¢ launching In true style, because the constructors are mere hoys.
> Paul B. <1<- Martini, James Powell and James Cooper, the two former
1 ape<l 18 jreara and the latter 19, have been toiling away nt the Nellie C
since October 2fi of last year, on which day the keel was laid. The craft Is
about completed, and looks like a well-modeled boat, out of which the
â  three owners expect k"o<"'<i .speed.
The Nellie C is 33 feet over all. 11 feet 4 Inches beam. She Is 3 feet 6
inches In depth of hull, and will draw 2 feet 6 inches in water. Tho iron
shoe weigMta 1000 pounds. She is a center-board boat. 9-foot forward deck
with a 14-foot cabin; cockpit 7 feet 6 inches, and her after-deck is 3 feet 6
inches; 5 feet 6 inches overhansjing stern and 2 feet forward. She will
carry a sail of 21 feet 6 inches hoist, 32-foot boom, 12-foot paff.
The three Juvenile constructors are half-orphans, having mothers to sup
port, and they worked on the boat on Sundays, holidays and after business
hoursâ sometimes aa late as 10 o'clock of nights. They built a KkifTâ the
Ocean Waveâ a few years ago. and subsequently sold her for $30 which
went toward the purchase of lumber for the Nellie C, which will stand
them over SfiOO.
Miss Nellie Clark, residing on Howard street, near Third and the
â Weetheart of young Powell, will "break the bottle" at the christening
"We forewent every pleasure almost," said Do Martini, spokesman and
foreman of the trio, "In raising enough money to purchase the lumber for
our boat, and not a man even so much as drove a nail on her."
The craft would be a credit to older builders, and is to see her first
race, shortly after launching, with John Cassidy's yacht Irene, which has
thus far beaten everything in her class about North Beach.
The three boys are now putting the finishing touches to their craft on
a lot next to the D. H. Bibb Lumber Company's yard on Stockton street near
North Point.

when the time goes up."
Maben Isn't confident as to Aster, and
thinks the fast l><xter Prlnc horse is
doing well to drive tho winner out In
2:10 "t- better, as he hasn't .sat behind him
since his arm was Injured. "Oh. he'll go
a couple of Teat heats, mark that, but
I've an Idea they are going to hurry right
back when Mr. Cohen lets them away."
Williams thinks Monterey not at hlm-
Belf and may not .start him. "If he isn't
good I'll merely delay the scoring and
spoil the afternoon's sport for many, and
if I can't trot a steady lot of miles I'll
not injure some one else's chances of vic
tory, for I can enjoy it from the grand
stand, I think." The summaries y

JUDGE SHELDON PRAISES CALIFORNIA
"The Red Cros? movement received its greatest single impetus from
California. Its generous spirited men. led only by that matchless ora
tor and splendid specimen of American manhood, Thomas Starr King,
made the movement contagious and memorable forever. In no country
has the humane instinct been more pronounced or intelligent than in the
American National Red Cross under the presidency of Miss Clara Barton.
Its work in times of peace has been in a high degree excellent and
satisfactory to the people of the United States, and nowhere in the
world has the organization shown more to be proud of than in the State
of California.
"The work of California in the present war has been such as gives
promise for the State, the country and for the soldiers, whether in the
hospitals or in the field or on the marc!;. It will be as it was in the
Civil War, an inspiration to the whole country."

TELLS WHY
CALIFORNIA
WAS IGNORED
Our Delegation Was Taken by
Surprise When the Hawaiian
Commission Was Named.
Senator Perkins Gives the Story of Lament
able Failureâ Coolie Labor Problems in
the Annexed Islands Now De
mand Attention.
California, by reason of the geo
graphical and commercial relations ex
isting between the State and the re
cently annexed Islands of the Pacific,
had a right to expect representation on
the Hawaiian commission. Apart
from questions of trade and proximity,
there are labor problems Involved in
the acquisition of the islands which
deeply concern the people of the Pacific
Coast. It was accepted, an a matter of
course, that the members of the Cal
ifornia delegation in Congrers would
give earnest thought and effort to pro
tect the interests of the State in the
proceedings following annexation, but
tc the surprise of the California public
the announcement enme by wire from
"v\'ashingt"n that the President had ap
pointed two Commissioners from Il
linois, one from Alabama, two from
Hawaii and none from California.
Senator Morgan of Alabama, one of
the Commissioners, Is a nice enough
gentleman of the old school. He repre
sents in Congress a fine stretch of
country extending from the Tennessee
Itiver on the north to the Bay of Mo
bile on the south His constituents are
good people whose only knowledge of
Hawaii consists in knowing that the
Sandwich Islands are on the map of the
world. They are not concerned in a
single material or moral interest af
fected by the acquisition of the islands.
The two Commissioners from Illinois
are well known men. Doubtless they
are familiar with every township of the
Illinois prairie from Egypt to Elgin
Park, and probably know to a dot
everything of importance connected
with the construction of the Chicago
river drainage canal, but the manufac
turing and pork-packing interests of
their constitution cannot be affected by
annexation problems.
Senator Perkins was asked how It hap
pened that no one from the Pacific
Coast was selected to serve on the com
mission and that two statesmen from
Illinois and one from Alabama were
chosen. He told the story of the fail
ure In this style:
"The measure passed the Senate
Thursday evening and the next morn-
Ing I called on Jud?e Day, Secretary ol
State, and submitted to him that tht
Pacific Coast, by reason of proximity
and commercial relations with the Is
lands, was entitled to recognition, on
the commission. He was of the same
opinion, holding that one of the com
missioners should be a resident of this
coast. Thereupon I said that I knew a
man, a lawyer of ability and a public
man of wide experience who would be
able to render the country good service
in the capacity spoken of. I said this
man was Morris M. Estee. On my own
responsibility I mentioned Mr. Estee's
name. I had no authority from him to
do so, but I was convinced that he
would fill the position to the satisfac
tion of the people of the Pacific Coast.
Judge Day commended the suggestion
and expressed the hope that the name
would be presented to the President
without delay. I had an appointment
elsewhere but I went at once to see
Judee McKenna, knowing that the
Judge was in the confidence of the
President and that he might exercise
much influence in securing the appoint
ment of Mr. Estee. Judge McKenna
approved the suggestion to ask the
President to appoint Mr Estee and we
started to see the President, when we
learned tha t the appointments had been
announced.
"I was taken by surprise," continued
Senator Perkins. "It seemed to me that
the President used the same pen, before
the ink was dry, with which he Bigned
the message to sign the appointments
of Morgan, Cullom and Hitt. I ex
pected some time would be given to the
consideration of names for the pla.ee.
No, the delegation from California did
not go with me to see the President,
the Secretary of State or Judge Mc-
Kenna. I was In a sense doing the work
of a John the Baptist, going before to
clear the way for the delegation."
The Senator, whose cries in the
wilderness did not prepare the way for
his followers, was asked if the members
of the delegation had good reason to
believe a week before the bill passed
that annexation would prevail, and In
reply said that it was known to all of
them that the bill would pass. He was
asked further if the Congressmen of
this State had met to consider the ap
pointment of a California man in the
event of the passage of the bill, and
admitted that no meeting of the kind
had taken Hace while the bill was
pending. The Senator had intended
after performing the John the Baptist
work to notify his fellow workers in
Congress that the path to the White
House had been blazed and then the
delegates were all to go to the - resident
and ask for Mr. Estee's appointment
as one of the commission.
The annolntment of two men from
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L SATURDAY, JULY 16, 1898.
Illinois was thus explained by Senator
Perkins: "The President desired Mr.
Davis, chairman of the Senate Commit
tee on Foreign Relations, o acci pi ;i
: place on the commission but he de
; clined. and so Senator Cullom was ap
i pointed to represent the majority on
! the committee. Mr. Morgan was named
to represent the minority of the com
' mittee. Mr. Hltt. chairman of the House
Committee on Foreign Relations, was
| appointed. It so happens that Cullom
land Hitt are from Illinois."
According to Senator Perkins' own
admissions, the delegation did not hold
a single meeting to discuss the subject
of recommending the selecting of a
Commissioner from the Pacific Coast.
No thought was given to the subject
until the bill had passed and gone to
the President for his approval. Sena
tor White and Representatives Hil
born, Loud, Maguire, Barham and the
others seem to have been as idle as
Perkins himself. Apparently there
was no discord in the delegation. It
would seem that there was not suffi
cient animation for a discordant note.
Mr. Estee, whose name was suggested
to Judge Day after the President had
appointed the Commissioners, was not
even consulted. But this omission to
consult Mr. Estee does not amount to
much, as the public mind is quite well
made up that Mr. Estee would have
served if he had been urged by the
President and his fellow citizens to ac
cept the office. The point that strikes
the California public with bewildering
force bears on the utter lack of enter
prise and State loyalty In the delega
tion from California in the Congress
of the United States. "
As to coolie and contract labor in
' Hawaii, Senator Perkins Is convinced
that under the law It cannot come in
j competition with the free labor of the
' United States. He holds that the laws
I of this country relating to the hours of
labor must be observed now that the
I islands have been annexed to the
United States. He claims to appreciate
the fact that California for the past
twenty-five years has been making a
I determined stand against the Introduc
tion and recognition of low grade coolie
and contract laborers, and expresses
i the opinion that the administration of
. affairs in Hawaii should not be allowed
to set aside the good work which has
I been done here in behalf, of Intelligent
I American industry.
"It may become necessary," said
1 Senator Perkins, "to deport the coolies
I and low grade laborers now in Hawaii.
| Surely the laws of this country for the
protection of the worklngman will be
enforced in the annexed territory. This
labor problem is one of great impor
j tance to the people of the Pacific Coast.
I am not unmindful of the strong re
i pistance the people of this coast and
particularly the people of California
have made to the introduction of
Asiatic labor. Having this in mind, I
was anxious that a citizen of Califor
! nia should be on the commission to ad
! just the new order of things. I am con
vinced that the Commissioners -will
give this subject earnest consideration.
Existing contracts can be annulled, and
if necessary the coolies Imported to
the islands can be deported."
In regard to the general work of the
California delegation In Congress Sen
ator Perkins remarked that there was
a disposition to censure a Senator for
what had not been done, but there was
no inclination to give credit to a pub
lic servant for what had been accom-
I plished. Speaking of his own work, he
I said he had succeeded in getting an ap
propriation of $500,000 for Mare Island,
$133,000 for Oakland harbor lmprove
j ment, $500,000 for the Postoffice in San
Francisco and $17,000 for water sys
tem at Angel Island. One of the three
new battle-ships and several of the tor
pedo boats had been secured for this
city. The Senator enumerated many
other appropriations for smaller meas
ures of public good and remarked that
he had worked diligently to promote
1 the welfare of this State.
MRS. MERRY'S
ANSWER TO
THE CHARGES
Those Cooking Receipts Making
Trouble for the Woman's
Exchange.
The Institution Declared to Be Used to Pro
mote Social Ambitions of the Very
Nouveaux Riches.
Several weeks ago an article appeared
In the Call with reference to Internal
troubles in the Board of Managers of the
Woman's Exchange, pertaining to the
puMi.-atlnn of a receipt-book published
by a baking powder company, in which
the nameÃ and receipt of the leading
members of the board and organization
were used.
It was charged at the time that Mrs.
Minnie Merry, superintendent of the Ex
change on Post street, had obtained the
receipts improperly and It was suggested
that she had received a large sum of
money from the company for delivering
the goods.
The supposition was that the difficulties
were at an end, but it eeems that Mrs.
Merry has only been more or less patient
ly waiting for an answer to her letter
written in the fore part of ,last month,
asking and demanding an Investigation of
the charges. This demand was Ignored
and Mrs. Merry has decided to take the
benefit of stating her side of the case pub
licly.
"I have tried hard to avoid any news
paper controversies on this unpleasant
case," said Mrs. Merry, yesterday, "but
after the manner In which I have been
treated by the Board of Managers of the
Woman's Exchange, I feel that I must do
justice to myself and state the trouble
from my standpoint and let the public
Judge between us.
"For eight year I was the superintend
ent of the Woman's Exchange and per
formed my duties satisfactorily to the
board. The baking powder company had
all these years been furnishing us with all
the cereals and baking powder used in the
exchange, free of charge.
"Some months ago the manager of the
company asked me if I could not assist
him in getting some receipts for the com
pany for publication in a cook book. I
mentioned the proposition to several
memoers of the board, and they thought
it was proper, In view of all the kind
nesses the company had extended the ex
change. Mr. Ames of the baking powder
company had the letters of request writ
ten out. and I, as superintendent of the
exchange, signed them. The ladies of the
exchange answered promptly, and later
proofs were forwarded to me for revision.
They were read over In the office of the
exchange, and some of the members were
present while I was making the correc
tions find saw me doing so. What was
my consternation when that article came
out in the Wave charging me with using
my position to secure the receipts and
then selling them to the baking powder
company. Why, those peonle had the
audacity nnd Injustice to say that I had
received $5000 for their work aid that it
was not fair for me to take all the money
and not divide it with the exchange. The
Idea of even insinuating such a base act
on my part after all the hard and earnest
work I have done for the organization.
It naturally made me angry, anu I wrote
the board of managers the second letter,
of which this is a copy:
To the President of the Board of Directors
of the Woman's Exchange â Dear Madam:
Some time since I communicated with your
bi ard concerning an article which was pub
lished in the Wave on April 2 reflecting dis
credit upon my actions as former superintend
ent oi the Woman's Exchange. I explained
my position relative to the subject matter of
that libclous article and asked your board to
Investigate the matter and accord me ordinary
Justice by taking official action vindicating
my honor as your former superintendent. 1
nlrve heard nothing In response to this com
munication. Yosterday the Morning Call, in
an article entitled "A Tempest In a Teapot,"
reviewed the subject. I now feel that patience
has ceased to be a virtue, and I intend to de
fend myself; but before doing so, disliking
nf-wspaper controversy, I demand that the
Board of Directors of the Woman's Exchange
take action In the Tnattpr. If this Is not done
within a reasonable time I shall feel con
strained to use the only alternative, and that Is
through the daily newspapers In an open letter
to the Woman's Exchange, in which I shall
lay the entire subject before the public.
It is an action that I feel loth to take, but
It will become necessary in the absence of a
complete vindication by you, us I deem my
honor paramount to my regard for your organ
ization. Ynurs truly, MINNIE MEHRV-
June 10, IS9B.
"After some time, during: which I was
totally ignored by the board. I finally re
ceived, much to my surprise, a letter
from Henry E. Hiphton. attorney for the
board, of which this is a copy:
Dear Madamâ Your letter of June 10, 189S, ad
dres.sod to the president and board of direc
tors of the Exchange for Woman's Work. ha 3
been referred to me. Only a day or two ago I
had written an answer to a former letter ad
dressed by you In the same way, and had
apologized for my delay.
If, in your opinion, the article you refer to
in the Wave was llbelous. I know of no reason
why ym should communicate to the ladiesof the
Exchange your intentions to commence an ac
tion for your vindication. These ladies had no
connection with the publication of the Wave,
and you hnd no right to assume that they had.
Nor is there any reason which can be legiti
mately assigned for an investigation by the
president and board of directors of the Ex
change for Woman's Work in aid of any pro
ceedings you may see fit to take with respect
to the author or publisher of the article In
question.
I am quite convinced that you have been
treated with the utmost delicacy and considera
tion by the ladles with whom you were so long in
official relations. Nor have I any doubt that
In furnishing the recipes with the names at
tached to the Cleveland Baking Powder Com
pany, however Innocently, you overstepped any
possible authority you had. The printing of
these recipes with the names attached In the
pamphlet Issued by the Cleveland Baking Pow
der Company was and ought to have been re
sentt-d by the ladies whose names were Im
properly used, and who were thus placed In a
fulse position. The best thing that could have
happened for all parties concerned after the
suppression of the pamphlets, for which the
Cleveland Baking Powder Company denerves
credit, would have been to allow the whole
matter to pass Into oblivion. If, however, you
feel Impelled to avail vourpelf of this oppor
tunity to ventilate the matter through tlie
newspapers, that, of course. Is exclusively
within the province of your own private Judg
ment.
The ladies of the Exchange feel that the de
livery of the recipes with the signatures was
an indiscretion, the consequences of which
were very unpleasant to thpm, but they have
marie no attack of any kind upon your "honor,"
and, therefore, bo far as they are concerned,
there Is no vindication required.
â  There may be a desire in some quarters to
generate a '"tempest" out of this matter, but,
if they act under my advice, the ladies of the
i Exchange will not furnish the "teapot." Re
! spectfuliy, HENRY E. HIGHTON.
i Mrs. M. Merry. 1433 California street. City.
"The publicity brought about by the
publication in the papers also brought a
letter from Mr. Ames, manager of the
baking powder company, to Mrs. Schmie
dell, president of the board. The letter
related to the circumstances of the case
and contained these .sentences: 'Mrs. Mer
ry's action in the matter was exclusively
j and entirely prompted in the interest of
! the exchange and not through any
! thought or expectation of personal bene
fit. Being desirous, however, at all times
to conform to the wishes of your manage
ment we would be pleased to hear from
you with suggestions and expressions of
your wishes in relation to the matter in
hand.'
"Whether the board answered this let
ter I know not, but I do know that the
baking powder people called in and de
stroyed all available copies of the book
without reference to their pecuniary loss.
"It was my original intention to sue the
Wave for libel, but my attorney advised j
me that in the event that I secured judg- i
merit it would i" v valueless. Therefore,
against my wishes, I must get my vindi- !
cation through the columns of the daily
press. These charges are all false, and
I am at a loss to know who or what in
spired them; and, furthermore, the board :
! has never ceased berating me for resign- ;
' ing. I had to resign or ruin my health, j
'' The -work was hard enough, but the ]
J worry of trying to please that board of
lady managers was too much. Tuesday
was 'board day,' and we approached it
; with mortal dread and bade it good-by
with heartfelt thanks.
"The Woman's Exchange is not what it
! used to be, nor is it carrying out the work
for which it was founded. It is supposed
to be and was once conducted for the
purpose of assisting needy gentlewomen. !
Such is not its mission now. It is now
used as the stepping-stone to good society
by the nouveaux riches who could not suc
ceed in getting on the front doorstep of
such society people as they now reach
were it not for the Exchange. The needy
gentlewoman is an unknown quantity
' now unless she has social Influence, which
lis a rare case. It is the women of the
! middle class who do not need the assist
i ance who have the patronage of the ex
changeâthose who want to earn some
thing extra for pin money.
"The board passes upon the work of
new applicants, and if she is not the cou
sin, the niece or some other relation of
some one of influence in the sacred swim,
her work is rejected, and the managers
say, 'Oh, no; we can't do anything for
her'; but if a member says: 'She is all
right; she Is related to Miss So and So,
and we will have to handle her work';
and they do.
"Now, as to the real work of the board.
It is supposed to be a charity. It is no
more a charitr than any commission
houre on Front stroot. for a commission
of 10 per cent Is exacted upon every sale
be it small or large. Furthermore, the
women who work in the Exchange are
held to their hours and work as rigidly as
any employe of the large stores of which
the Labor Commissioner has so often
complained.
"If the Woman's Exchange Is ever to
fulfill its mislon there must be a grand
reformation, that will not only aid the
needy gentlewoman to sell her handi
work, but to do so without having to
give charity one-tenth of the returns of
her labor for assisting her.
"I am sorry to have to â¢ say these
things, but they are true, and after the
outrageous manner in which I have been
treated by these ladles I feel that in jus
tice to myself I must give the public an
opportunity to judge between the board
and me.
"They know that they cannot substan
tiate the charges that" have been made
against me, and they choose to treat me
with contemptuous silence as an answer
to my demand for a just vindication.
Matters having come to this acute stage
we will see what the outcome will be."
Assemblage of Ohioans.
The regular monthly meeting: of the
Ohio Society of California was held last
nipht at Mystic Hall, and an enjoyable
evening was spent. The following new
members were elected: Charles H. Watt,
Edward L. Baldwin, Elmore Ellis Ewing,
wb&Â«n aU â¢- Johr \, s - Mumaugh and Z. T.
v\ hitten. This makes a total of forty new
members elected during the last two
months.
â¦ Th pO fftl t at Â£ c Preceding meeting that
the .Fifty-first Regiment of Ohio Volun
teers" was" expected to arrive in this city
soon was found to be erroneous and no

the Fifty-first lowa Regiment.
Although organized but little over a
year /the society was found to be in a
flourishing condition, with a neat balance
in its treasury.
El Campo
Continues to draw thousands every
Sunday. It is hard to say whether it
is the bay trip or the charm of the
place itself which attracts old patrons.
The Ukiah is so commodious and the
views of the bay are so delightful on
the El Campo route, that feature alone
is a drawing card. In addition the
dancing platform and the shady walks
and bath beach are always inviting
with their varied pleasures. Four round
trips every Sunday is the schedule of
the steamer.
DemijohnL Must Be Stamped.
The following decision regarding the
| stamping of demijohns was received from
the Treasury Department yesterday bj
Collector Lynch:
Demijohns containing wine exposed for sala
which are manifestly substitutes for uncovered
| bottles are liable. The fact that a bottle la
surrounded with wickerwork would not relieve
] it from taxation, provided It were not so far
beyond the size which is In common use to
contain wine as to plainly show it to be a vâ¬b
sel not within the intent and meaning of the
law in this respect. The question of the lia
bility of demijohns or other bottle-shaped ves
sels containing- a gallon or upward will be re
served for consideration upon receipt of fur
ther Information touching the custom of the
trade as to offering wine for sale in such pack
ages. Wine must be stamped when bottled,
except ac to stock in hands of wholesale and
! retail dealers on July 1. IS9S. which need not
be stamped until sold. The woW retaU. as
used in this connection, Is taken In its ordi
nary commercial sense, applying to any quan
tity that Is purchased directly by consumers,
whether it be a case or bottle.
