THE MUTTERINGS OF WAR
ARE GROWING YET LOUDER
IS GOVERNMENT
KEEPING BACK
INFORMATION ?
STATESMEN
ARE GETTING
VERY CURIOUS
Believe That the President
Wants Time to Prepare
for Battle.
â 
There Is a General Strengthening
of Coast Fortifications and
the South Atlantic Fleet Is
Hurrying Northward.
Are the administration officials sincere and honest in
the expression of the belief that the Maine's destruction re
sulted from accident, or do they merely assume this con
servative attitude to gain time in which to put the army and
navy upon a war footing ?
This is a question which members of Congress are ask
ing. It is certain that leading Senators and Representatives
in Congress who are members of the Naval and Milrary
Affairs Committe3 have been in private consultation win
the President, and the fact that they are secretive naturally
creates a belief that these conferences were important. It
is known to be an absolute fact that the President requested
the Washington Post and Star to assume a conservative
attitude, so as not to incite jingoes in Congress to radical
action which might precipitate a crisis.
But whether the President and his advisers are really
of the opinion that an accident caused the Maine's destruc
tion, or whether the officials wish to temporize in order to
put the army and navy on a war footing, is a question ex
cited by the unusual activity in army and navy circles.
It is a significant fact that Senator Perkins and Repre
sentative Hilborn, of California, both of whom are members
of the Naval Committee of their respective houses, are
unusually cautious and discreet in their expressions of
opinion. But, however careful they may have been, it is
known by their friends that they regard the situation as
very serious, and both men are at this time deeply engrossed
in the study of naval matters.
I asked Congressman Hilborn to-night if in his opinion
the United States was prepared for war.
" Perhaps not," said he, "but we will be prepared in
short order should the findings of the naval court at Havana
show the Maine's destruction to have been caused by
design."
It is very evident that Mr. Hilborn thinks the Maine
was blown up by a submarine mine, for in casual conversa
tion to-night he said: "The fact may not be generally
known at large, but we have our own harbors planted with
torpedoes and submarine mines. New York harbor is thus
fortified, and so is San Francisco harbor. A diagram is in
the possession of the officers. The entire harbor is checked
off into squares or subdivisions, and each one is numbered
as accurately as the chairs in an opera-house. Lookouts
posted â¢on "the bluff have such an accurate knowledge of
these harbor subdivisions that they can, by a signal, a flash
to the gunners, show the exact location of a hostile ship,
and the gunners have their range-finders so adjusted that
they can fire a shot and strike any one of these squares.
As tor the torpedoes and submarine mines in San Francisco
harbor, 1 of course do not know where they are located.
Neither does any civilian. These secrets are, for obvious
reasons, jealously guarded by the War Department."
HAVANA, Feb. 21.â The board of at 10 o'clock this morning, with
inquiry into the Maine disaster met Captains Sampson and Chadwick
on the lighthouse tender Mangrove and Lieutenant-Commanders Potter

and Marix present. XJaptain Samp
son presided, and Lieutenant-Com
mander Marix, recently executive of
ficer of the Maine, acted as recorder.
Captain Sigsbee, the commander
of the Maine, was the first witness
called. He was under examination
until 1 o'clock this afternoon, at
which hour an adjournment was
taken. It is probable that no fur
ther witness will be heard to-day,
but the board will make a careful
personal examination of the wreck,
near which the Mangrove is an
chored.
Captain Sampson received a cor
respondent immediately after the
morning session of the board. He
said in the course of an interview:
"I would be glad to give news,
but owing to the delicate situation,
the board has decided to make noth
ing whatever public. Ido not know
what testimony may develop, and
when, and it is only fair to the
Spanish Government not to tell the
public the testimony until all has
been received and the findings have
been considered.
â¢ "You may say that this rule is
absolute. Due care will be taken
for the rigid enforcement of it. I
have no idea as to how long the
court will remain here. No one is
authorized to fix the time, as the
members themselves do not know. I
shall give such routine news of the
proceedings as is proper."
Captain Sigsbee, on board the
Mangrove, told the correspondent
that he was quite pleased with the
examination, and that he was able
to answer all the questions asked,
not only as to his own acts, but as
to those of his subordinates on the
Maine.
Gunner Charles Morgan, of the
cruiser New York, arrived on the
Mangrove and is in immediate
charge of the divers. The latter
have heen at work all day, but up to
the time of sending this dispatch no
discoveries have been made. It is
believed that the salvage by the
wrecking company will be consider
able and valuable.
LATIN REPUBLICS
SHOW FRIENDSHIP.
Deny That They Would Form an
Alliance With Spain against
the United States.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â The state
ments that Spain, through her agents
In South and Central America, is en
deavoring to form a Latin alliance
against the United States are denied
in Mexican cable dispatches to the
Herald from the principal cities of the
Southern republics. From Argentina
comes assurances that the Government
would not permit Spain to make over
tures in this direction. Mexico's senti
ments are entirely with the United
States, as against Spain and Chile, it
is said, would not embark in any dan
gerous alliance against the United
States.
President Zelaya of Nicaragua tells
the Herald that his Government sym
pathizes with the United States, and
President Pierola of Peru, extends con
dolences for the Maine disaster.
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 21.â T0
the Editor of the Herald: Domestic
affairs have prevented the Nicaraguan
people from hearing of the recent in
cidents between the United States and
Spain. Owing to that fact, we are
unable to give an opinion thereon. I
can, however, assure the Herald that
in Nicaragua there is a heartfelt sym
pathy for the American people.

In reply, will say that the Peruvian
Minister in Washington must by this
time have expressed to your Govern
ment the condolence of the people of
Peru and mine for the painful accident
to the Maine. PIEROLA.
Buenos Ayres has never attempted
to influence the policy of Argentina,
nor would any diplomatic effort in
that direction be permitted by the
Government. I am able to say this on
high authority. The officials of Ar
gentina heartily disapprove the act of
Senor De Lome, formerly Minister to
the United States, in criticizing Presi
dent McKinley, and applaud the en
ergy of the American Government in
the matter. The disaster to the Maine
has been widely commented upon, but
public opinion as to the cause has not
taken definite form. The public
anxiously awaits the result of the
Government's investigation.
VALPARAISO. Chile. Feb. 21.â The
assertions that Spanish diplomats in
the South American republics are
working to obtain their support
against the United States took every
one here by surprise, and as far as
Chile is concerned they are absolutely
unfounded. It is true that Chileans,
in spite of their old quarrel with the
mother country, are deeply attached
to Spain, and Spanish residents in
Chile are numerous, but Chilean
statesmen have often proved their
disinclination to embark in dangerous
enterprises, such as an alliance
against the United States, for which
they have sincere friendship. Besides
this, Chile's hands are full now with
the settlement of questions with Peru,
Bolivia and Argentina,. and she has no
time to listen to such propositions
from Spanish representatives,' even if

DELVING AMONG

Divers Encounter a Horrible Sight
Among the Ruins of
the Ship.
NEW YORK. Feb. 21.-The Sun's
Havana cable says: To-day has been

ing inside the Maine adder! to the dark
ness and greatly hampered the divers
in their work.
To prevent all this trouble it is an
nounced that to-morrow the divers will
carry a wire and place an electric search
light inside the Maine. The wire will
be connected with the Mangrove, and
the tender's dynamo be used to
throw the light inside the wrecked
battleship. The divers have received
strict orders to refuse to reply to any
question about the cause of the dis
aster or the results of their investiga
tion.
Inside the hull of the ship the divers
found many bodies. About this they
talked freely, saying it was one of the
most horrible spectacles that human
sight could endure, s.n efforts to re
cover these bodies were useless to-day.

PREVENT AGITATION.
Leaders of the House Now Think It
Good Policy to Remain Silent.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21. âIt was
stated to-day that it will be the policy
of the House leaders to prevent, as far
as possible, any agitation of matters
relating to Cuba or the Maine disaster
in the future. Pending the result of
the official investigation they believe
it is wise and the part of good public
policy, to maintain silence. As Chair
man Hitt, of the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, is confined to his home by a bad
cold, it is probable that no more meet
ings of the committee will be held un
til he returns to his seat in the House.
It is understood that the report of the
State Department to be made in an
swer to the House resolution of in
quiry regarding the situation in Cuba
will not be made for a week or ten
days. It is explained that the work of
preparing the consular reports which
will be transmitted will require consid
erable time. Besides those reports, it is
said, must be scanned by Assistant
Secretary Day in person and the de
mands upon his timi> at present are
very great am] he has little leisure to
give to this work.

NEW YORK, Feb. 21.-A Bridgeport
(Conn.) special to the Herald says:
The American Ordnance Company re
ceived an order this afternoon from the
United States Government for forty
spven six-pounder rapid-fire Hotchkisa
guns, which are to be delivered as soon
as possible. The company is making
preparations to turn the pruns out with

it been so pressed with orders as now.

OFFICERS OF THE MAINE
EXPECTED THEIR SHIP
WOULD BE DESTROYED
One of Them Said to Have Written That the Worst
Would Happen if the Vessel Remained in
the Harbor of Havana After the 15th
of February, the Fatal Day.
"An officer of the Maine in a re- '
cent letter to his wife said, 'If we do {
not get out of here before the 15th ,
of February something serious will (
happen.'" '
This announcement made from the
pulpit of the Church of the Advent by {
the Rev. J. A. Emery Sunday night (
created a profound sensation. <
In almost every city or village of <
the United States, no matter how <
large or small, it is safe to say that J
some reference was made from at
least one pulpit yesterday regarding <
the terrible disaster to the Maine. <
When Mr. Emery entered his pulpit J
Sunday evening and announced his in- ,
tention to dwell upon this topic the (
congregation took it as a matter of â¢
course. His subject was "Be Thou |
Faithful Unto Death," and as he en- (
tered into it his words were followed (
closely. (
"It may not generally be known," he said,
but it is nevertheless a fact, that when the
ship entered the harbor of Havana her gal
lant crew knew they were risking their lives,
but they never murmured nor sought to
swerve from the path of duty. Yesterday I
was talking to an intimate friend of mine, a
retired naval officer and a man in whose
word I place implicit confidence. In speak
ing of the disaster he mentioned a very dear
friend of his, who was a prominent officer on
the Maine, but whose name I will not men
tion. This officer, in a recent letter to his
wife, spoke in no uncertain terms about the
perilous position of the Maine in Havana har
\ bor, and furthermore stated that he was
positive if the Maine did not leave Havana
â  harbor before the 15th some catastrophe
' would result."
On the evening of the 15th the Maine was
blown out of the water by some unknown
agency, and there in the mud and filth of the
bay with the gnarled and twisted iron lie the
bodies of the brave boys who were "faithful
unto death."
At the close of the sermon the preacher
was surrounded by a number of his congre
gation, among whom were many of the cool
est heads in the city, eager to learn more of
the sensational incident he brought to light,
but beyond reiterating his former statements
he would have nothing to say. Mr. Emery is
not by any means a sensationalist, and the
members of his congregation are satisfied
\ that he would make no statements without
j having fully investigated them and having
[ full confidence in their authenticity.
GOING TO HER DOOM.
The American battleship Maine pass
ing Morro Castle on the way to her
anchorage in Havana harbor, at the
point where her wreck now lies, and
where so many of Uncle Sam's brave
boys in blue sleep beneath the murky
water.
Yesterday afternoon a Call reporter visited
him at the diocesan house on California
street, where he was in company with a
number of prominent Episcopalian clergymen,
and questioned him regarding the story. He
was very reticent, and positively refused to
divulge the name or rank of the author of the
sensational letter.
"The incident I mentioned in my sermon
Sunday evening is perfectly true, and were
I at liberty to mention the name and stand
ing of my informant the doubts in the minds
of a great many people would at once be set
at rest. As it is I feel almost sorry that I
mentioned the incident in my address Sun
day evening, and had I known there was a
reporter in my congregation I would never
have done so, as the story was related to me
casually in conversation and I feel now al
most as though I had betrayed the confidence
of a friend. The letter in question was re
ceived by the officer's wife a few days prior
to the dreadful explosion which sent over two
hundred of our brave boys to an untimely
grave in the bottom of the bay. She at
once wrote to my friend knowing that he, as

"He was not greatly alarmed at first,

STATESMEN STILL TALK OF PEACE
SPANISH FLEET
IN CUBAN WATERS
TO BE STRENGTHENED
It Is Clear That the Dons Are -Preparing â¢Them
selves for Any Result of the Maine Inquiry
Now In Progress at the City of â 
'Havana.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â Spain has not neglected to take pre
cautions for any emergencies that may arise. According to official
information which has reached Washington, there are now en route
to Cuba the Almirante Oquendo â a sister ship of Vizcaya, which is
now at New York â the Cristobal Colon, an armored cruiser, and four
torpedo boats â the Ariete, of 97 tons displacement and a speed of
26.1 knots per hour; the Halcon and Azore, each of 108 tons displace
ment and 24 knots speed, and the Rayo of 97 tons displacement and
25.6 knots speed. It is expected the Vizcaya will proceed to Havana
within a few days.
Besides the vessels mentioned Spain will then have in Cuban
waters the Alfonso XIII, a cruiser of 3090 tons displacement, built in
ISB7, and carrying a main battery of 6.2-inch and 2.7-inch guns; the
Reina Mercedes, a cruiser of 3090 tons displacement, built in 18S7, and
carrying a battery of two 4.7-inch and four 6-pounders; the Reina
Cristina, of 3520 tons displacement, a speed of 17.5 knots and a bat
tery of six 6.2-inch, two 2.7-inch, three 2.2-inch and two 5-inch guns;
the Conde de Venadito, Infanta Isabel and Isabel 11, each of 1130 tons
displacement, 14 knots speed and batteries consisting of four 4.7-inch
guns, two 2.7-inch guns and five machine guns, and the Marquis de la-
Ensenade of 1030 tons displacement, a speed of 15 knots and armed
with four 4.7-inch and five smaller guns of rapid firing type and four
machine puns.
In addition to these cruisers the Spanish fleet in Cuban waters
consists of the torpedo vessels Filipinas, 20 knots speed; Jorge Juan
of 13 knots, Galicia and the Marques de Molirs and Neuva Espana
of 16 knots speed. The Spanish flag also flies over twenty-four ves
sels having displacements of 300 tons, 200 tons, 100 tons and 40 tons
each and nine yachts purchased in the United States and doing ser
vice as patrol boats.
Tho Cristobal Colon left Spanish waters for Cuba via the Canary
Islands on February 1, in company with the torpedo boats named.
This ship was only recently placed in commission and is accounted
one of Spain's most formidable vessels. She carries a battery of two
10-inch guns, ten 6-inch, six 4.7-inch and ten 2.2-inch rapid firing
guns.
the best light to put the matter in. I could
not reasonably accuse the Spanish of hav
ing destroyed our vessel, prophesied war
and given a long dissertation on war, its
calamities and the uncertainty of life in
great disturbances, nor could I draw a possi
ble moral from the fact that our Government
has not taken every precaution to guard
against accident, as lam very familiar with
conditions aboard a man-of-war and know
that every precaution which human ingenuity
can suggest is a/ready in use.
"/ walked donntown. debating the ques
tion in my mind, and incidentally met my
friend. He was Just the man I wanted, and
we at once entered into conversation on the
chief topic of the dayâ that terrible explo
sion in Havana harbor, Mhich may jar the
world before its last detonation is heard.
While discussing the matter he incidentally
spoke of his friend, hoping that no harm
would befall him, and mentioned how brave
he was in the face of a hidden danger.
"I naturally expressed some surprise at
the mention of 'hidden danger,' and to my
great astonishment he informed me that the
wreck was not altogether unexpected â that
the officers knew they were face to face with
death, but could not tell in what form it
would be visited upon them. He then spoke
of the letter from the Maine's officer, in
which the evening of the 15th was men
tioned as a day of impending death, and I
at once drew my lesson: These men knew
they were face to face with a calamity of
some kind ; had an inkling of the day, per
haps the hour, and yet never faltered, never
flinched, but bravely stood at their posts
until the 'something of the 15th' happened â
they were awakened from their slumbers by
a deafening roar; the plank that separated
them from the deep was shattered; from
the arms of slumber they were aroused to
find themselves clasped in the arms of the
angel ot death. I chose my text of 'Be
Thou Faithful Unto Death,' but my discourse
found myself at a loss for a fitting illustra
tionâsomething which would fully show how
faithful these men were to the charge im
posed upon them â and the words of the offi
cer of the ill-fated cruiser flashed upon me.
Thinking that they might pass unnoticed, and
being fully convinced of the absolute relia
bility of my informant, I narrated the inci
dent of the letter.
"The stir it created in the congregation
and the many eager inquiries afterward were
more of a surprise to me than the news I
unwittingly gave forth was to my congrega
tion, and I was sorry for it. My desire is to
be anything but a sensationalist, and, aside
from this, in the present heated condition of
things it is bad policy to arouse the people
and start a clamor for war when an investi
gation may prove that Spain had nothing
whatever to do with the disaster.
"No ; I must positively refuse to give you
the name of either my informant or the au
thor of the letter, as I have refused many of
my congregation. It would be premature at
this time, and it would be necessary for me
to gain the consent of my friend first. I
think I have already gone too far with you,
and hope you will not publish any of what I
have told you, while I fully realize that it is
your business to do so.
"The lady who received the letter is not
living here at the present time, and her hus
band was among those who were saved. I
am confident, however, that if you should

obtain her address she would give you no
further information, but would deplore the
fact that so much has already been made
public. When the naval board of inquiry
sits in a few days all these facts will be
made public, as the officer in question will no
doubt testify at that time in effect as he has
already written. I know him to be a man of
such integrity as not to be guilty of writing
such a message to his wife from any mere
hearsay or rumor. He knew what he was
about, and evidently wished to fortify her
against any possible shock which might re
sult from sudden news of the loss of the
ship. She had an ink/ing of what was com
ing, and was in a measure prepared for it.
Once again I must assure you that this is true
and express my regret that it has been made
public prematurely, but business is business
with you, and I know what to expect. This
is positively all I will say regarding the mat
ter â at least until after the board of inquiry
has met, and then I will be guided by its
verdict."
While Mr. Emery was speaking a group of
clergymen gathered about him, who listened
to his words with undisguised interest and
immediately pressed around him with a
series of questions which would have done
credit to a professional interviewer. He
stood himself up in a corner, however, and
at once became as communicative as the
Sphinx on matters regarding the disaster.
WORK AT THE MOUTH
OF CAPE FEAR RIVER.
Government Mounts Heavy Ord
nance and Will Man the Mon
itor Nantucket.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â A WUraington
(N. C.) special to the Herald says:
Since the Government began the erec
tion of fortifications at the mouth of
Cape Fear River no visitors have been
permitted to inspect the work being
done. Everything contemplated has
nearly approached completion. Heavy
rilled ordnance, mounted en barbette on
disappearing carriages, have been
placed in position, ammunition has been
received and an artillery officer with
a few men has recently arrived to take
charge.
As an adjunct to the land works the
United States steamer Nantucket â a
monitor of the old type, however â is
stationed in this harbor. Orders have
recently been received to place the ves
sel in first-class condition. The battery
of the Nantucket consists of two 12
inch cannon in the turret, with sev
eral rapid-firing guns as a secondary
battery. This ship is to be manned by
the North Carolina reserve force, con
sisting of about 250 men, and an officer
of the regular navy has arrived to in
spect and instruct them. Lieutenant
Commander George L. Morton, with his
whole command, is very enthusiastic
and ready at any time to respond to
the call of the Government.
Greater confidence is now felt here in
the security of our poTt, and, while
more extensive fortifications may be
needed, still the opinion prevails that a
hostile ship would have difficulty in
passing the batteries without serious
injury being inflicted upon them. Be
sides these means of defense and pro-
tection, torpedoes will be provided to
be placed in the channel both outside
and along the bars, which at high wa
ter would admit of the passage of ves
sels drawing twenty-two feet. Our re
serve will give a good account of itself
should an emergency arise, and many
of the recruits care not ho-w soon.
Lee Remains at Havana.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â There is no
truth in the report from Tampa, Fla.,
stating that General Lee left Havana
' this afternoon by the Government yes
, sel for that port, and that a train had
been ordered to take him to Washinu
, ton on his arrival there. A dispatch
'â¢â  from Havana late to-night says:
I "General Lee is still here. He is not
going to Washington to-night."

FRESNO, Feb. 21.â General W. M.
Muller, commanding the Third Brigade,
National Guard of California, has is
sued the following orders to his sub
ordinate officers:
"Ascertain immediately the business
and residence address of each member
of your command. From this informa
tion divide your command into squads
of corporals. Each corporal must
keep both the business and residence
address of each man in his squad and
also familiarize himself with the usual
whereabouts of each man bath day and
night, so that every man can be quick
ly found.
"You will ascertain immediately what
per cent of your command can be de
pended on for active service and how
many are unfit from physical disabili
ty. Ascertain how many ex-National
Guardsmen in your vicinity who can
be depended on for active service, and
make a roster of these men, showing
name and both business and resi
dence address. Report the approxi
mate time you would require to recruit
your command up to the maximum of
103 members who are physically fit for
active service. Make two rosters, one
of ex-National Guardsmen and one o*
men who are willing to volunteer, show
ing business and residence address.
Place a copy of each roster most con
veniently into sections of indefinite
number in charge of each sergeant for
purpose of prompt notification. Load
immediately all effective shells you
have necessary to bring your supply
of ammunition up to 100 rounds per
man on a basis of present membership,
being extremely careful to properly
size each shell. If your finances per
mit, it would be well to provide a re
serve supply beyond this quota for pos
sible recruits.
"Can you in case of emergency pro
vide'your command with six days'trav
eling rations per man from your local
source of supply? This ration to com
ply as nearly as circumstances will ad
mit to United States army standard.
You are hereÃy' oAlered to assemble
J your command for an inspection in the

STOCKTON, Feb. 21.â Major Gus
I Grant received to-day an order from
j the headquarters of the Third Brigade,
calling him to inspect Companies A
i and B of this city next Thursday night
and giving certain instructions whicn
show that the object of the inspection
| is to ascertain the condition of the
[ companies for service in case of war.
i The order directs that the business and
residence address of members and ex
members of the National Guard be se
cured, and that the officers familiarize
themselves with the whereabouts of
the men, day and night. The order also
directs that effective shells be loaded
l at once, sufficient to bring the amount
! up to 100 rounds per man, and asks if
! six days' traveling rations per man
can be supplied in case of emergency.
The number of men physically fit for
actual service is asked for, and an In
spection in heavy marching order is
ordered for Thursday night. The fol
lowing accompanies the orders:
"The primary object of this inspec
tion is to ascertain the condition of
property and its fitness for active serv
ice, more especially the ammunition on
â¢hand, and the condition of the pieces
generally and also the number of men
present and absent and their general
fitness for service. It is not contem
plated to devote much time to drill or
company movements, but information
as to the deficiencies of equipment in
any particular will be ascertained. Re
ports will be made in duplicate within
twelve hours, one copy forwarded im
mediately, direct to brigade headquar
ters and the other to regimental head
quarters."
The orders have occasioned quite a
stir among the local militiamen.
EXPLOSION ON BOARD
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
The Ship Was Lying Quietly at
Anchor and the Magazine Should
Have Been Locked.
That an explosion could take place
in the magazine of a war vessel at
night when its hermetically sealed door
is locked and the key hidden away in
the commander's cabin, or when the
ship is lying peacefully at anchor in
harbor seems well within the limits of
impossibility. To those who have wit
nessed the care which is taken of the
powder storeroom on board ship there
is no such thing as such an occurrence.
Every hour, day and night, the sleep
less vigilance # goes on, for officer and
man know the power of the deadly
mine just under the deck they walk.
Before a magazine door is opened all
fires, all open lights, must be extin
guished. The captain's cigar and the
sailor's pipe is put out. Should the
gunner or any of his mates enter the
sacred place they must change their
clothing, donning garments on which
there are no buttons or any hard sub
stance that might rub against a stray
grain of powder. Shoes with metal
nails in their soles are replaced by rub
ber slippers. Even rings are removed
from fingers and every* precaution
known to human ingenuity is taken to
prevent the deadly friction that may
send a shattered hulk below the waves.
Relative to the awful disaster that
has stricken the noble battle-ship
Maine, many causes have been mooted
for the deadly explosion. Spontaneous
combustion in the coal bunkers or
among the high explosives in the mag
azine Itself has been advanced as a
probable eauF 1 . Gun cotton has been
mentioned as an agent of destruction
to the vessel. On the subject of this
fulminating compound a representative
of The Call Interviewed H. J. Tresselt,
a retired gunner of the United States
navy, now residing in this city. He
was serving on board the Trenton
when she was wrecked in Apia harbor,
and his retirement from active service
was caused by injuries received in that
disaster.
The officer stated that gun cotton is
used on board ship for torpedo work
and carries 30 per cent of water and is
usually stowed below decks in its spe
cial magazine. When charged with
this amount of moisture it is consider
ed perfectly harmless. However, it is
officially inspected at intervals for
signs of the dangerous deterioration
which may be taking place. Special
pains is also taken to keep the contents
of the torpedo cases up in â weight,
which may fall below through evapo
ration. If loss of weight is noted pure
rain or distilled water Is added. As a
rule wet gun cotton of 30 per cent
moisture cannot be detonated except
with the assistance of a certain
amount of dry gun cotton called "a
primer." About three pounds of dry
are required to detonate thirty-five
pounds of wet. The dry is exploded
by a detonator composed of a certain
number of grains of fulminate of mer
cury. All the dry cotton and the de
tonators are carried either in the cap
tain's cabin or above decks. They are
separated into small quantities .and
distributed about the vessel that the
explosion of one package will not be
communicated to others.
Fire could not cause an explosion in
guncotton as it would simply burn
slowly, and it Is practically impossible
for the wet guncotton to lose enough
moisture to render it explosive and
dangeroois. It is likewise impossible
that the powder could have been heated
from the fireroom or coalbunkers. The
magazines are generally well away
from these places, and protected from
them by heavy steel bulkheads. All
powder charges are sealed in copper
cylinders and stowed so that they do
not come in contact with the bulk
heads. The magazines are guarded
and Inspected constantly. They are
lighted by electricity, each lamp so ar
ranged that it may shed its glow with
in the storeroom and yet not be a pos
sible source of danger to its inflamma
ble contents. The illumination is
thrown into the magazine through'
heavy glass deadlights, which are pro
tected on the magazine side with a
heavy wire screen. As no part of the
lamp or its wires enters the magazine
proper, there is no possibility that the
Maine's explosion came from this
source.
Even the powder itself is frequently
tested to determine if there is any de
terioration from 'standard power. So
it will be seen that the magazine and
Its death-dealing contents are never
left alone, day nor night, and under
this everlasting vigilance it is nearly
Impossible that explosions could take
place therein^

DESTROYED BY
THE SPANIARDS
One ;of the -â¢Sailors 1 ' Who Survived the Explosion
/_. Does Not -Hesitate to Express Has Opinion
.. of the Dastardly Treachery of
â the Dons,
PROVIDENCE, R. 1., Feb. 21.â A United States Steamship Maine
sailor who was serving in the anchor watch, that is, the members of
the crew on duty on deck in Havana harbor at the time of the explo
sion, arrived in Newport to-day and went to Conanticut Island, in Nar
ragansett Bay, to visit friends. He came from Cuba on one of the first
Government steamers to leave the island after the disaster, and is now.
in apparently as good health as ever in his life, though he suffered
some at first from the shock and the fall on board.
The member of the anchor watch does not want his name revealed,
for he is now on furlough and under orders not to talk to newspaper
writers. His home is not in this State and he is not a Rhode Islander.
All day yesterday this survivor of the Havana horror narrated to dif
ferent friends on Conanticut Island the details of the affair when they
recurred to him.
He said in substance: "I was on duty at my post. About 9:40 the
Maine was lifted from twelve to fifteen feet out of the water into the
air. There was an explosion under the ship, in my opinion. An in
stant later a second explosion occurred and then a third. It is my
belief that the Maine was blown up by the Spanish, for no one else
would have the opportunity in that harbor, which is sentried to beat
anything I ever saw or heard about. The first explosion was the
most fearful, and I was tossed into the air. I went up with the ship
fifteen feet or so, and then when my feet left the vessel I went up still
further into the air, and when I struck I landed in the black waters
of Havana harbor some distance away from the sides of the Maine. I
was picked up in about five minutes. I surely swam about as long
as that. The rescue of those swimming about was quickly
done, but some who were blown overboard were drowned. My opinion
is that the magazines will be found intact, for I don't think they ex
ploded. There was on the Maine at the time she was blown up a lot of
fixed ammunition, and this was probably exploded. I think this caused
the second and third explosions, and it came from the flames that fol
lowed the upheaval of the mine or torpedo which exploded beneath
the vesel. The fixed ammunition was for instant use in any emergency.
"There are a good many reasons why I am sure the vessel was
blown up by Spanish design. We all feared it for a week before it oc
curred, and none of the survivors are astonished that the plot was car
ried out just as we expected it would be. The investigation by divers
and the naval inquiry will demonstrate that I am right in saying the
disaster was no accident."
Regarding the volcanic upheaval of the explosion, the sailor says it
was awful, and that he never thought a naval monster like the Maine
could be lifted out of its element in such a manner. The wreck when
last seen by the departing survivors was a sunken, tangled mass of
iron, steel and armor. In his different statements the sailor adheres
to his opinion that the first explosion lifted the vessel high In the air,
and he is confident that whoever planned the job intended to destroy
both vessel and crew.
TURRET MERELY
TOPPLED OVER
Divers Make an Impor
tant Discovery on
the Maine.
It Was Impossible for the For
ward Magazine to Have
Exploded.
Startling Evidence That Tends to
Bear Out the Treachery-
Theory.
Special Dispatch to The Call..
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â A special ca
ble to a morning paper from Havana
says: I am informed that the result
of the divers' work to-day on the hull
of the Maine is considered by the naval
experts as going almost as far as cer
tainty in demonstrating that the Maine
was destroyed by an outside force and
not by the explosion of her own for
ward magazine.
Immediately over this magazine was
the immense turret. If the magazine
had exploded the experts believe that
the turret would have been blown to
pieces, or, at least, carried far away
from the ship.
What the divers discovered to-day is
that the immense turret has simply
been toppled over and is sttll part of
the Maine, although covered with de
bris.
Although the divers have not actu
ally explored this forward magazine,
it is now considered in view of the con
dition in which this turret was found
that there was really no explosion in
that Compartment.
The facts thus far presented to them
are held by the naval officers to demon
strate almost to a certainty exactly
how the ship was destroyed. The ex
plosion must have taken place under
the boilers between the forward and
after magazines.
The force applied in that place would
break the vessel in two parts and leave
the wreck in the general condition in
which it now appears In the water.
Also an explosion there under the
boilers and furnaces would have
thrown up the volcano of flre and ce
ment which was observed by those on
shore at the time. While the force of
this upheaval would be very great it
would not have smashed and broken
up the turret nor blown it away, but 6Ti
the contrary this immense mass of

â¢ Â»
CITY OF MEXICO, Feb. 21.â The general feeling In Mexico !s
that McKinley has been careful in his desire not to wound Spanish
susceptibilities in the De L,ome incident. As regards the Mama dis
aster, the first idea was that it would lead to war, as everybody be
lieved a Spanish officer caused it. President Diaz sat up until half !
past 2 o'clock Friday morning to. read the dispatches sent to the Daily
Two Republics, and was Intensely Interested.
There is no truth in the statement that Spanish diplomats have !
endeavored to influence the Mexican Government to support Spain in
case of war with the United States, as they know this would be utter
ly useless. Mexico's sympathies are with the United States against !
Spain. The Mexican people are thoroughly Imbued with hatred to 1
Spain. This dates back to the conquest by Cortez. They prefer that
Cuba shall be a free republic, but w.ould rather see her annexed to the
United States than remain a Spanish colony, and are astonished at
the forbearance of the Americans.
steel would have fallen inâ toppled
over practically as the divers found it
to-day.
It is for this reason that the naval
experts,, as I am informed, while they
have not reached a conclusion, have
been strongly impressed toward the
theory of the submarine mine by th â Â»
peculiar position and all but uninjured
condition of the turret.
The officers who were attached to the
Maine have held this belief all along,
and it is now known to many Ameri
cans in Havana that Captain Sigsbee
and his officers have little doubt that
the mine was exploded under the bal
ers between the two magazines, and
that when a thorough investigation is
made it will be found that neither of
the latter helped to destroy our war
ship. w

VISITS OF
VIZCAYA'S
CAPTAIN
Eulate Received With All
Due Courtesy by Army
and Navy Men.
$ut at the Office of the Mayor of
Greater New York It Would
Appear That There Was
Frost in the Air.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â Clad in the
resplendent uniform of the Spanish
navy. Captain Antonio Eulate of the
cruiser Vizcaya made his formal visits
to-day to official heads of the army,
navy and municipality. Captain Eulate
was accompanied by Senor Arturo
Baldasano, Spanish Consul-General,
and was received cordially and with fit
ting ceremony by Rear Admiral Bunce
in the navy yard and Major-General
Wesley Merritt on Governors Island.
The reception which Mayor Van
Wyck accorded to him was so cool that
Senor Baldasano quickly made an ex
cuse for withdrawal. Speaking of the
courtesies extended to him. Captain
Eulate said: "I was given a most cor
dial reception by the admiral and by
General Merritt. I also called on the
Mayor."
Captain Eulate started on his round
of visits at 9:30 o'clock in the morning.
He was taken from his ship to the
ferry at St. George by the navy yard
tug Narkeeta. He was in civilian's
dress, but a sailor carrying a tin box
containing his uniform was with him.
Detect ivf- Sergeant Davis of the Cen
tral Bureau, who has been assigned to
duty on the Vizcaya during her visit,
and two of the captain's aids, accom
panied him. They took the ferry boat
which landed at the foot of Whitehall
street, whence they walked to the office
of the Spanish Consul-General, where
Senor Baldasano embraced Captain
Eulate in genuine Spanish fashion, and
expressed his pleasure at seeing him.
The captain disappeared into an inner
office, and when he emerged a few min
utps lattr he was in full uniform and
wore white kid gloves.
Accompanied by Senor Baldasano. he
entered a cab which stood at the door.
and with Detective Davis on the seat
with the driver, and two other head-
j quarters men following, the party pro
â¢ ceded to the Brooklyn navy yard. In
order to avoid crowds, the cab went by
way of Wall street ferry instead of the
bridge.
At the gate of the navy yard a lieu
tenant's guard of thirty-four marines
was drawn up awaiting the visitor.
They stood at attention as the cab
passed. Ensign Frederick R. Payne
stepped forward and directed the cab
to the commandant's quarters in the
Lyceum building. He held the door
open while Senor Baldasano and Cap
tain Eulate alighted. They were met
at the entrance to the building by
Commander /Lyon of the Dolphin, act
ing captain of the yard, and Lieuten
ant Ward, junior aid to Admiral
Bun^e.
Senor Baldasano presented Captain
Eulate and the visitors were escorted
by the American officers upstairs to the
reception-room and presented to Ad
miral Bunce. Senor Baldasano and
Lieutenant Ward acted as interpreters.
Captain Eulate expressed sympathy on
the part of himself and his officers for
the loss of the Maine. He informed the
admiral that he had ordered the flag of
the Vizcaya at half-mast and that all
Invitatfons of a social nature would be
declined and the officers and men of the
Vizcaya would mourn the loss as
though the Maine belonged to their
own navy.
The admiral thanked the captain for
the sentiments and expressed the hope
that his visit to this port would be
pleasant. He tendered the services of
the department to the Captain during
his stay and invited the captain and
his officers to be present at the usual
festivities in the yard in honor of
"Washington's birthday.
Captain Eulate replied that he would
hoist his ensign to full mast and dress
the ship in honor of the day and would
remain on board all day for the pur
pose of answering salutes. When the
Invitation to attend mass for the
Maine's dead in the Church of the
Sacred Heart at Clermont and Park
avenues. Brooklyn, was handed to
Captain Eulate he asked if the cere
mony was official.
Admiral Bunce explained that the
church and state are separate in this
country and therefore the mass could
not be oflicial. Captain Eulate then
said he would write a letter declining
the invitation, as he had decided to ac
cept no invitations except those pre
scribed by official etiquette.
After a visit of fifteen minutes Cap
tain Eulate and Senor Beldasano were
escorted to their cab. As they left the
yard the consular salute of nine guns
was fired at the Cob dock. Returning
to Manhattan, the Wall-street ferry
routf was followed. When the cab
reached pier 3. East River, Governors
Island, the boat had just left the pier,
and half an hour's wait in the rain waÂ»
avoided by driving to the Barge Office
landing, where the Custom-house cutter
Manhattan was placed at the disposal
"f the visitors.
Accompanied only by the Consul-
and three detectives. Captain
Eulate was taken on the Manhattan
to Governors Island, to return the call
he had received before leaving his ship
from Captain Gilman, Company B,
Thirteenth Infantry, who presented the
respects of General Merritt. It was
half-past 12 o'clock when the visitors
reached General Merritt's quarters.
They were received by the head of the
Department of the East and his staff
in full uniform. Greetings and good
wishes were exchanged, and there was
informal talk for half an hour. Then
Captain Eulate and Consul-General
Baldasano boarded the regular Govern
ment boat which plies between the city
and Governors Island. This was the
third Government vessel the visiting
captain had utilized during the day.
Arriving at pier 3 the cab was again
pressed into service, and the Spanish
captain and Consul were driven up
Broadway to the Mayor's office. Detec
tive Davis carried the cards of the
visitors into the Mayor, and a moment
later ushered in the visitors. Word
had been passed through the City Hall
corridors, and a hundred or more law
yers, politicians and newspaper men
were gathered in the Mayor's room and
about the entrance when Senor Bald
asano and his companion appeared.
In anticipation of the formality of
the presentation to the chief executive
of Greater New York. Captain Eulate
had removed his cape overcoat and ar
ranged it on his left arm, and carrying
his laced chapeau. he stepped into the
presence of Mayor Van Wyck, who
arose and stood at one side of Vns desk,
as Seno* Baldasano said: "I wish to
present Captain Antonio Eul.i:e, of the
Spanish warship Vizcaya, to you. as
you are the representative of the city
of New York."
Captain Eulate bowed with Castilian
grace and said in good English, "Com
pliments." Mayor Van Wyck bowed,
but said nothing. Senor Baldasano then
said, "The captain wishes to pay his
respects to you." If the Mayor made
any reply it was inaudible. The visi
tors waited a moment, evidently ex
pecting to be welcomed to the city, but
as the Mayor remained silent Senor
Baldasano relieved an embarrassing
situation by saying: "We will not de
tain you longer, as you are so busy
having to see all these gentlemen."
With that he shook hands with the
Mayor, the captain shook hands and both
bowi-ng low took their departure. They
were driven back to the Spanish con
sulate, ar.d Captain Eulate, having
made his official calls, changed his un
iform for civilian dress. ' Senor Bald
asano sent for the detectives and told
them their services were no longer
needed.
Senor Baldasano said the ship will
probably remain off Tompkinsville five
or six days, and will then proceed to
Havana. Captain Eulate dined with
Senor Baldasano at his home this even
ing, and then returned to his ship.
THE STAY OF THE
VIZCAYA SHORTENED.
Spain's Powerful Cruiser Will Prob-
ably Soon Leave New York
for Havana.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â The social
courtesies which the Government in
tended to extend to the officers of the
Vizcaya have been abandoned on ac
count of the Maine catastrophe.
As a result, the stay of the Vizcaya
at New York probably will be material
ly shortened, and she is likely to sail
within the next three days, probably
on Thursday next. The ship no doubt
will proceed direct to Havana, not
stopping at Charleston or other ports,
as had been suggested during the ear
lier preparations.
The Vizcaya will not coal at New
York, according to the understanding
here, nor will it be necessary for her
to take coal before reaching Havana.
This determination gives relief to the
authorities here, as the taking of coal
in time of public excitement is attend
ed with more or less risk, the coal af
fording an opportunity to extremists
for the secretion of explosives, despite
the utmost precaution that may be
taken.
CAPTAIN BOYTON
TRACKED BY SPIES.
Yellow Correspondents Wrongly
Stated That He Would Blow
Up the Vizcaya.
NEW TORK, Feb. 21.â A Norwich
(Conn.) special to the Herald says:
Sensational Journalism is making no
end of trouble for Captain Paul Boy
ton, who is an inmate of the sanitar
ium at South Windham. He has been
quoted freely as willing to attempt to
place torpedoes under the Spanish
cruiser Vizcaya by the aid of his water
walking suit.
"This business," he said to me to
day, "has made me un object of sus
picion of the Spanish Government."
According to Captain Boyton, a
Spanish spy has been on his track for
several days. He noticed a stranger
following him last night. On Friday
a stranger attempted to enter the san
itarium, but was stopped by Superin
tendent Donahue. The man was very
anxious to see Captain Boyton, but
when he found out that the captain
was in the building he was apparently
satisfied and left hurriedly. Another
time Captain Boyton was interviewed

by an alleged newspaper man. The
captain is sure the fellow was a detec
tive and not a newspaper man.
"They want to be sure I am still
here," he said. Captain Boyton once
placed a dummy torpedo under the
British vessel Garnet. Captain Boy
ton's representative said that while
Captain Boyton was a warm follower
of Cuba's freedom, he had not thought
of making any attempt against th"
Vizcaya, as newspapers had quoted
him.
FIVE DIVERS SENT
TO CAPTAIN SIGSBEE.
There Will Be Plenty of Men to
Carry on the Work of Exam-
ining the Maine.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â Admiral
Sicard telegraphed from Key West this
afternoon that he had sent five divers
to Captain Sigsbee, and asked if that
was sufficient. The acting chief of the
Navigation Bureau, Captain Dickens,
at once took the sensible course of di
recting the admiral to put himself in
communication with Captain Sigsbee
and learn his needs at first hand. The
business of the Navy Department is
getting back to its normal condition, as
is evidenced by the fact that an order
has been issued to discontinue the
special telegraph service which was es
tablished with Key West, and hereafter
the office at that place will close at 10
o'clock at night, as formerly.
Commander Forsythe. the command
ant at Key West, has also asked per
misssion of the department to stop his
daily bulletins, and this has been
granted, with an understanding that
he will report any deaths that may oc
cur among the sufferers In the hos
pitals there. To-day he reported that
they were all getting along nicely. The
exchange of official condolences still
continues.
To-day Secretary Long sent a tele
gram as follows to Captain Eulate:
"Commanding Officer of the Spanish
Cruiser Vizcaya, Tompkinsville, N. V. :
I have the honor to acknowledge the
receipt of your telegram of condolence
for the loss of the Maine and thank you
for the expression of sympathy."
A similar response was made to a
cablegram from Vice-Admiral Spann
at Vienna, expressive of sympathy for
the terrible disaster to the Maine.
SPAIN IS BUILDING
UP HER NAVY NOW.
Orders Given for a New Cruiser to
Be Laid Down in the Dock
Yards at Cadiz.
MADRID, Feb. 21.â The Spanish Gov
ernment has ordered a cruiser of mod
erate size and power to be laid down
at once in the dock yards at Cadiz. The
dimensions of the vessel are as fol
lows: Length over all, 289 feet; ex
treme beam, 36 feet; displacement, 2000
tons.
She has unusual armor protection for
a ship of her size, carrying on her pro
tected deck eight-tenths of an inch at
the water line, and 3.2 inches except
over machinery and magazines, where
this will be increased to 4 inches.
The armament consists of four 5.6
inch rapid firebreech-loadingsteel rifles,
four 4-inch breech-loading rapid fire
steel rifles on the Hontoria principle, and
four 3.3-inch Nordenfeldt rapid fire
pieces. She is also furnished with two
torpedo tubes.
The designed speed fs twenty knots
an* hour and her radius action is 6000
knots.
â¢ Admiral Bermejo admits that Spain
is seeking three new warships. He says
also proposals have been made, but
that none have been accepted.
Beading Militia Ready.
READING. Pa., Feb. 21.-Captain
Samuel Willits of the Reading Artil
lery says that their quartermaster has
received orders to secure the name and
residence of every enlisted man and
verify the same, so that in case they
are needed, the members will be ready
to rendezvous at any place within
twenty-four hours. To-day another
military cc/mpany of sixty men was
formed, and efforts are being made to
increase the number to 300 within the
next three days.
UNDOUBTEDLY
DESTROYED
BY DESIGN
Passengers From Havana Tell
of Circumstances Attending
the Blowing Up of the
Maine.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â The Ward!
line steamer Seguranca arrived at
quarantine to-day from Tampico and
Havana. The Seguranca arrived at
Havana at 10 o'clock on the morn
ing of me disaster to the Maine and
passed close by the wreck. The Se
guranca's passengers snid that great
excitement prevailed at Havana, and
at the time of sailing the foreign
population were generally of the
opinion that the Maine was de
stroyed by design. They cited,
among other things in support of
this theory, the fact that the
Spanish man-of-war Alfonso XIII,
which was anchored near the Maine,
changed her moorings just previous
to the disaster. One of the passen
gers, William L. Carbin, went so far
as to say he saw a boat go near the
Maine a short time previous to the
explosion. He said he would go to
Washington to make a statement
before the proper authorities.
C. P. Holcomb of Newcastle, Del.,
general manager of a street railway In
Philadelphia, one of the passengers on
board the Seguranca, was outspoken in
his belief that the investigation at Ha
vana would reveal some startling cir
cumstances.
"I went to Havana," said Mr. Hol
comb, "not at all in sympathy with the
insurgents, but on Wednesday, when
we got to Havana, I believe any of the
Americans on board was in a mood to
commit murder. The flags of the Span
ish warship were not half-masted. The
vessels of all other nationalities had
paid thia slight tribute to the dead.
"The contrast between the bearing of
the Spaniards and Cubans is strong.

the Cuban women in the streets were
almost all dressed in mourning, while
the Spanish women wore colors. The
only American flags I saw in the whole
procession were two small ones, about
three by six inches. I went aboard the
Alfonso XIII and was received po
litely. The only expression of regret I
heard there was from an officer, who
complained that the force of the Maine
explosion had broken his toilette bot
tles. There can be no mistaking the
indifference of the Spaniards in Ha
vana over the loss of the warship and
those on board. On Thursday, while
driving to the cemetery with two Amer
ican friends I was assailed with jeers,
and some one threw a large stone at
our carriage."
F. W. Bobbette of this city, who was
with Mr. Holcomb in the carriage,
added:
"That's perfectly true. In fact,
one or two children yelled after us
i that they had blown up the 'Ameri
\ cano,' and that they were glad of it.
I did not hear a single expression of
[ regret for the terrible loss of life
i from any Spaniard during the time
1 I was in Havana."
Frank Weinhlmer of this city, an
eye-witness of the explosion and a fel
low passenger of Mr. Holcomb's, told
the following story:
"On Tuesday evening I strolled down
to the river front for a breath of fresh
air. I was about 300 yards from the
Maine. The first intimation I had of
an explosion was a crunching sound.
Then there came a terrible roar. Im
mense pieces of debris flew skyward
from the Maine. Some of them must
have been thrown at least 300 feet. It
looked as though the whole inside of
the ship had been blown out. Many
persons on the pier were nearly thrown
from their feet by the force of the ex
plosion. The air became stifling with
smoke."
Mr. Weinhimer said he heard an ex
cited Spaniard declare shortly after the
explosion that if the "Americanos"
Bent another warship it also would be
blown up.
M. J. Naghton, an insurance man of
Chicago, who was staying with his wife
at the Grand Hotel, said he was seated
in front of the hotel when the explo
sion occurred. It was followed, he
said, by another and a much louder
one.
"We thought the whole city had been
blown to pieces," said Mr. Naghton.
"Some said the insurgents were enter
ing Havana. Others cried out that
Morro Csstle was blown up."
Continuing his description of the
panic which existed in Havana short
ly after the explosion, Mr. Naghton
said:
"On the Prado is a large cab stand.
The minute after the explosion was
heard the cabman cracked their whips
and went rattling over the cobbles like
crazy men. The fire department turned
out and bodies of cavalry and infantry
rushed through the streets. There was
no sleep in Havana that night. The
Spanish officials were quick to express
their sympathy and acted very well
as a whole, but. l think their expres
sions of regret lacked the warmth
which would have been characteristic
of an American city had such a dis
aster occurred under similar circum
stances."
William L. Carbin. the passenger who
professed to have important informa
tion about the explosion, refuses to
make any further statements than he
made at quarantine.
SAYS A GREAT CRIS'*
IS NOW IMMINENT.
An Alarming Dispatch Sent From
New York and Published in
a Madrid Paper.
MADRID, Feb. 21. â An official agent
says: The Imparcial publishes a
dispatch, for which it must assume
full responsibility, as it does not ac
cord with the relations actually
known to exist between the , Spanish
and American Governments. It is dated
from New York and reads: "Great
military preparations are being made.
The forts are being reinforced. Three
hundred artillery men have been sent
to Sandy Hook and the Naval Reserves
have been expected to hold themselves
m readiness. The gun cotton and
smokeless powder factories are work
ing night and day, and it is generally
believed that a great crisis in the re
lations between the United States and
Spain is imminent."
IT COSTS
MONEY TO
WAGE WAR
Uncle Sam Has Got the
Credit for the
Game.
Some of the Ways in Which
Revenues Could Be Increased
If It Should Be Found
Necessary.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald |
sends the following: The successful j
prosecution of a modern war depends ;
as much on a well-filled money chest !
as on a well-filled powder magazine.
Should the United States be plunged j
into war the taxpayers of the country j
would have to pay the bills, which
would be even larger than they ought i
to be because the shortsight parsimony
of Congress has prevented the army
and the navy being put upon a footing
which would make such a war quick
and decisive.
That the resources of the country
would be equal to the strain, there can
be no doubt. At the close of business
in the Treasury to-day the net cash i
balance in the vaults amounted to $225,- !
143,969. Of this amount $100,000,000 con- â 
stitutes the gold reserve held for the ;
redemption of legal-tender notes, and
the balance, or a little over $125,000,000,
would be quickly absorbed by extraord
inary expenditures which would be re- j
quired. The present average receipts
ef the Government do not quite equal
the average ordinary expenditures, and
all extraordinary expenditures that
would be necessitated by war would
therefore have to be provided for in two j
ways â by increased taxation and by i
borrowing money. Increased taxes '
would doubtless be imposed by Con- j
gress without delay. The tariff law â¢
would have to b<? carefully revised to
see just where and how additional rev
enues could be derived from customs
taxation. In some instances increases
could be obtained by increasing duties,
while in others where' duties have al
ready been placed above the maximum
revenue producing point for the pur
pose of protection increased revenue
rates imposed.
Most of the increases would have to
come from internal taxes, however, and
these would have to be very largely in-
creased. At, present the principal
sources of internal revenue are whisky,
beer and tobacco. Th? tax on whisky
is at present about the maximum reve
nue producing point and it is doubtful
if the increase of this tax would in-
crease the receipts appreciably. Beer
does not pay as much as it ought to,
even for peace times, and should war
taxes become necessary there would be
little difficulty in raising $30,000,000
more a year by doubling or tripling the
tax on beer. The policy of Congress for
some years has been to decrease taxes
on tobacco and to 'exempt from taxa
tion some kinds of tobacco. These
taxes could be restored as a war meas
ure and $15,000,000 or $20,000,000 addi
tional could be raised from this source.
Other millions could be raised by
taxing proprietary medicines and
other preparations of this character,
including cosmetics and toilet, articles,
and stiil other millions could be
brought in by stamp tax on legal and
commercial papers. Still other taxes,
such as an income tax or other form of
direct taxation apportioned among the
States in proportion to population so
as to be constitutional, might be im
posed if necessity were urgent.
At best these additional taxes would
not yield enough money to meet the
current expenses of a. war and to sup- |
ply the ready money for the necessary
outlays for procuring, while the war
was in progress, the enormous sup
plies of materials of all kinds which
ought to have been provided gradually
during the years of peace so as to be
on hand for an emergency. They would I
be useful in raising money to pay a ]
war debt after peace had been re- i
stored, but the great bulk of the money
that would be required for the prose- I
cution of the war would have to be j
secured by borrowing.
The credit of the United States is j
good in spite of the efforts of the |
Bryanites to break it down, and even j
with a foreign war on its hand and a
conservative administration of the
Treasury Department, it would be
possible to borrow all the money needed

at reasonable rates of interest. ThÂ«
interest would not be so low as it
would if Congress should pass a law
making the bonds of the country ex
pressly payable, principal and interest,
in gold. The contingency would be one
calling for the highest patriotism, and
it is possible that the President might
realize this and break off his political
coquetting with the international bi
metallists, and that a majority of the
Senate might follow his example
and aid the House in passing a law
which would put the credit of the coun
try out of the question.
Most of the Republicans in the Sen
ate, as well as the Republican majority
in the House, would vote for a gold
bond bill under such circumstances, and
there ought not to be any doubt that
Democrats who do not come from the
silver-mining States would be willing
to join with them. Men like Senators
Murphy of New York. Smith of New
Jersey, Gorman of Maryland, Kenny
of Delaware, Mclnerny of Louisiana
and others ought not to hesitate in
such an emergency between loyalty to
the flag and loyalty to the Chicago
plaform.
As for the little group of gold-stan
dard Democrats, Senators Caffery of
Louisiana, Gray of Delaware and Lind
say of Kentucky, they would be even
more ready than the Republicans to
support the treasury at any and all
times.
Even if Democrats in the Senate
should fail to rise to be patriotic enough
in the face of a foreign foe to turn
their backs upon the Chicago platform,
the Government would obtain the
money necessary to carry on the
war, but in the end it would
cost the taxpayers of the country
many hundreds of millions more for
additional interest.
THREE WAR VESSELS
WILL BE MADE READY.
Work Being Hurried on the Min
neapolis, Miantonomah and
Katahdin.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â A Philadel
phia special to the Herald says: Ac
tivity now prevails at the navy yard
and the whole atmosphere of League
Island is unmistakably one of business.
It is said that an extra force of men
will be put at work to-morrow to get
some of the war vessels at the yard in
readiness for service. Some of the men
are to be placed at work on the cruiser
Minneapolis, which has been in the
drydock for some time. It is thought
by the officers that the necessary re
pairs to the cruiser can be made with
in five days, when she will be in con
dition to leave the dock.
Work on the double-turreted moni
tor Miantonomah. which has been ly
ing at the wharf for two years, is also
being pushed rapidly by a large force
of workmen. It is believed that the ne
cessary repairs can be completed in a
short time and that she will soon
mount the navy puns designed for her.
The ram Katahdin. which has been
put out of commission, is also being
placed in shape and a new ventilating
apparatus will be put in. This is an
important equipment, as a great part
of the vessel is under water.
The cruiser Columbia, which Is in the
harbor, can be taken at a moment's
notice.
MUCH AMMUNITION
HAS BEEN RECEIVED.
War Supplies for the Fortifications
in the Vicinity of
Newport.
NEW YORK. Feb. 21.â A Newport
(R. I.) special to the Herald says: A
very large amount of ball and car
tridge ammunition has been received
at Fort Adams. The officers, though,
say this is not extraordinary. Other
than this there is no evidence of spe
cial preparation for defense at any
Government station near Newport.
Parts of mortar carriages which were
brought here for the mortar battery at
Fort Adams have been found unsatis
factory, and will be sent back to Wa
terfc-rd. Conn., to-morrow. Guns for
the battery at Dutch Island are ex
pected soon. Work on them has been
rushed for several weeks. Their mount
ings are already in position.

When Foreign War ThreateQS It Is
Not Meet to Haggle Over the
Exper)diture of a pew
Dollars.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald
says: So strong is the opposition
of many members of both
houses of Congress who live
In the interior of the country
to adequate preparation foT pos
sible war that it is doubtful if
they will be taught a lesson by
the present emergency when the
diplomatic relations with Spain
are strained to the point of
breaking, or whether they will
vote appropriations which will
prepare the country for possible
future contingencies.
Representative Hilborn of California,
a member of the House Naval Commit
tee, said to me to-day: "Though we
have not enough ships what the navy
most needs for an emergency such as
exists at present is drydocks and am
munition. The ships we have cannot
fight without powder and projectiles,
and if they should be disabled they
cannot be repaired without drydocks.
These two factors of naval strength
should not have been neglected so long.
Former Congresses should have provid
ed fc-r them."
Another man with whom I talked
who fully appreciates the responsibili
ty of Congress for the present, condition
of the navy and coast defenses is Rep
resentative Cousins of lowa, one of the
most conservative members c.-f the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, who
said:
"I have favored adequate appropria
tions for the army and navy, and had
proper steps been taken years ago we
would be all right. The time when
steps ought to have been taken was
twelve years or so ago, when we had
in the treasury a cash balance cf $400,
000,000. Had this or half of it been ju
diciously spent for national defense
there would have been no difficulty in
meeting any emergency that might
arise."
That the responsibility of Congress
for national defense is fui.y appreciat
ed by leading Senators is shown by
these talks I had with a number of
them to-day.
Senator Foraker of Ohioâ lt seems to
me that nothing but fifty tons of dyna
mite is able to move this country: I
believe we are criminally negligent in
not providing most liberally for
strengthening our coast defenses and
building more ships for our navy. I al
ways advocated liberal appropriations
for the army, navy and coast defense
before I came to Congress, and I have
continued to do so at every opportunity.
I do not know that my efforts in that
direction will do any good if the policy
of the administration is to cut down
appropriations -M along the line. I am
one of those who believe that the public
money cannot be better expended than
in the protection of our people from
foreign assault.
Senator Murphy of New York, mem
ber of the Committee on Appropria
tionsâl am in favor of the most liberal
expenditures for the increase of our
navy and improving the efficiency of
our army and seacoast defenses. Our
committee without hesitation voted to
double the amount for fortifications,
and I would cheerfully double the
naval appropriation bill if necessary
and provide for the building of several
additional ships if the House wishes to
do so. I hope the war scare which is
now on will pass away, but I trust
nothing will prevent Congress making
ample provision for the protection of
our country against the threatened at
tack of a foreign power.
Senator Hanna of Ohioâ l am in favor
of liberal appropriations for the army
and navy, for I believe in the old adage,
"In time of peace prepare for war." I
am not a member of the Committee
on Appropriations, but, as one of the
committee on naval affairs, I will will
ingly support any reasonable proposi
tion calculated to increase the efficiency
of our navy. We have not yet consid
ered the naval appropriation bill, but
from the present trend of things it does
not seem to be in the direction of con
struction of more battle-ships. The
Secretary of the Navy tells me that we
have several new ships on the stocks,
and he only recommends one additional
ship. However, I believe the country
will ratify any reasonable expenditure
we may choose to make in the interest
of self-preservation.
Senator Vest of Missouri â Under ex
isting conditions I am in favor of the
most liberal expenditure for fortifica
tions, seacoast defense, the army and
navy. I do not believe it is wise to put
so much money into great battle-ships.
My idea is that the money can be bet
ter expended fn the construction of
fast cruisers to be used in destroying
the enemy's commerce, and monitors
and torpedo-boats for the protection of
our harbors. With strong fortifications
and monitors and torpedo-boats great
battle-ships are, to my mind, unneces
sary. As commerce destroyers we could
employ cruisers to great advantage. ,
We have no commerce to lose, because
it is all carried in foreign ships. We
have but little part In the carrying
trade of the world, and for that reason
we are in greater need of cruisers than
battle-ships.
Senator Platt of New Yorkâ We can
spend our money to no better advan
tage than by protecting our seacoast
cities and building war ships. I will
vote for the most liberal appropriation
on that line, and I believe every loyal
and patriotic citizen will Justify our
action. We can well afford to econo
mize in other directions, but when we
are threatened with war by a foreign
power it is our duty to take every pre
caution to protect our people, even at
the cost of being charged with ex
travagance in the expediture of pub
lic money. I do not know what the in
tentions of the Naval, Military and
Appropriations committees are in this
respect, but I will give my vote and
whatever influence I possess for gen
erous appropriations.
PLANS FOR RAISING
THE WRECKED MAINE
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.-Captain
Lemly, the Judge-Advocate-General of
the. Navy Department, with Captain
Bradford, chief of the Equipment Bu
reau, and Commodore Hichborne, chief
constructor, were in consultation for
some time with Secretary Long, re
porting to him the plans they had
formed for the wrecking of the Maine.
Captain Lemley suggested some further
changes in the details of contracts
which are now being drawn with the
wrecking companies and it is expected
that within a few hours after Congress
shall have enacted and the President
shall have signed the necessary bill
making an appropriation for the work,
the contracts will be eigned.
The incoming mail at the Navy De
partment brought a most interesting
contribution to the news of the day in
the shape of an excellent photograph of
the wrecked Maine, as it now lies in
Havana harbor. This was forwarded
to the Secretary of the Navy by Lieu
tenant Hood, lately attached to the
Maine. It is a view from the port side
and in features represents the last
newspaper cuts of the wreck. Secre
tary Long took it to the White House
and gave it to the President, who was
much interested in the details as shown
in the photograph.
The Navy Department has not yet
determined definitely which of our
warships sha!! reDlace the Maine in
Havana harbor, although it has deter
mined that, as a matter of policy, an
other ship must be sent there. The
choice may be the Montgomery, now
on her way from San Domingo to Key
West, or the Nashville, a gunboat, now
at Galveston participating in the Mardi
Gras festivities. If the latter termin
ates some time this week, as expected,
the Nashville will probably be selected
for the trip, as the Montgomery is just
returning from a cruise in the West
Indies, including two ports of Cuba,
and has been on patrol duty also.
MEN ON THE MAINE
PREDICTED DISASTER.
BOSTON, Feb. 21.â Mrs. Timothy
Toomey received the following letter
from her brother, Michael J. Downing,
of the Maine: "I would not object to a
little scrap, providing we Were outside
the harbor, as they say the harbor is a
network for torpedoes. Anyway, pre
pare for a fight if we do net leave here
for a month."
The following letter, written by John
H. Bloomer, a seaman on board the
Maine, was received by his mother be
fore the disaster: "There are torpe
does set at the bottom of the harbor,
and all that is necessary is to press an
electric button on the shore, and we
would fly sky-high, ship and all. We
can't go ashore here, as they would kill
us in a minute. If they get the chance
they might blow up the ship. As it is,
they are a bad lot, and we can't trust
them."
The following letter was sent by
Bloomer to his friend, U. H. Osborne of
Deering: "The Cubans sank the dry
dock by sending a diver out from the
shore, and he bored holes In the bot
tom of the dock and it filled with water
and sunk. The Spaniards might do the
same thing to us before we get out of
here. None of the crew of the Maine
is allowed to go ashore, for the offi
cers are afraid that some of us will get
killed."
WAR VESSELS IN
BRITISH SHIPYARDS.
LONDON, F^b. 21.â Six armored ves
sels, six protected cruisers, thirteen
torpedo-boat destroyers and five tor
pedo-boats are now building in Great
Britain for foreign Governments, of
which a number are purchasable, al
though Japan is supposed to have an
option on several of them. The war
ships which have been ordered for
South American Governments are con
sidered as being for sale to the highest
bidders.
Thompson Bros, state that Spain
has arranged to man the two remain
ing destroyers of the four completed
some time ago at the Clyde Bank
Yards, but not delivered, presumably
owing to the lack of payments.

STOCKTON, Feb. 21.â One of the
most unique services ever held in this
city was in progress all day to-day at
the house of Rev. D. L. Munro, pastor
of the Independent Church, at the cor
ner of Channel and Sierra Nevada
streets. Rev. Mr. Munro is the pastor
who retired from the First Presbyterian
Church a few years ago, and since
founded an independent congregation,
who worship with great seclusion. Rev.
Mr. Munro conducts a school in con
nection with his church, and to-day he
told the children that there would be
no session, but that the hours would
be devoted entirely to prayer for the
men lost on the battleship Maine and
the intervention of Providence in the
outlook for war. The small coterie of
converts gathered in the room, and
there they prayed on bended knee for
the greater part of the day, offering
supplication for the seamen who went
down in the waves of Havana Harbor.
CHICO, Feb. 21.â Mourning day was
generally observed in this city, and all
business houses were closed this after
noon. Memorial exercises were held in
Armory Hall, the largest building in the
city, but entirely too small for the
crc-wd. Hundreds were turned away.
The hall was beautifully decorated with
flags, evergreens and pot plants. Pa
triotic addresses were made by Mayor
Rodley, General John Bidwell, Jo D.
Sproul and Rev. Seneca Jones. "Amer
ica" and other patriotic airs were sung.
Never before has Chico seen such a pa
triotic demonstration.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 21.â A1l flags at
Santa Rosa were at half-mast to-day
out of respect to the memory of the
seamen who lost their lives in the
wreck of the battleship Maine at Ha
vana Harbor. The war spirit runs
high to-night. A number of leading
citizens and business men have signi
fied their intention to offer their serv
ices as soldiers should hostilities begin.
In a few hours a big company of vol
unteers could be raised from the best
men in town should war ensue.
WATSONVILLE, Feb. 21.â The Wat
sonville flags were flying at half-mast
all day here in memory of the burial of
the Maine's dead.
OWENS WILL BE HANGED.

In a verdict of murder in the first degree,
fixing the penalty at death. Owens killed
his wife, shot his daughter, Mrs. Tiede
mann, in the breast, and then put a
bullet through the top of his own head,
but failed to kill himself. The cause of
the trouble was the desertion of Owens
by his wife because of his cruelty.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 2.â A Key West
special to the Herald says: Consider
able speculation is indulged in as to
the course of the negotiations now
pending to send a tug from this port
to Havana to assist the investigations
I now being made by the naval authori-
I ties to ascertain the cause of the dis
! aster. The tug Right Arm, Captain
| McGee, owned by the Merritt Chapman
Derrick and Wreckage Company, which
arrived yesterday from Norfolk to tow
the schooner Belle O'Neil to New-
York, is still here awaiting orders as to
â  her final destination.
Several correspondents of northern
papers, following the lead of the Her
j aid, which with its characteristic enter
! prise has, since the Maine disaster,
j sent two steam vessels to Havana for
I its exclusive telegraphic service, have
endeavored to negotiate a charter for
the Right Arm. The negotiations, how
' ever, went no further than to ascertain
the price for which she could be se
cured and submit the terms to their
\ papers. There is no danger whatever
that the Right Arm will be employed
as a dispatch boat. I learn on the best
, authority that the Right Arm will be
employed by the United States Govern
ment to assist in savi.ig the Maine, if
; such a thing is practicable, and, if not,
, in recovering her armament and what
| ever else aboard that can be reached.
Before the departure of the lighthouse
! supply steamer Mangrove for Havana
I yesterday evening with members con
i stituting the board of inquiry, those
i officers visited the Right Arm, and
I were pleased with the size of the tug,
[ and were much gratified at the com
i pleteness of her equipment for prose
cution of the work which will be re
quired to make the investigation. I
' am told the admiral was so favorably
i Impressed with the tug that he ex
pressed a determination to secure her
: services at any cost and dispatch her
\to Havana without delay. This deter
; mination was communicated to the
i authorities at Washington late last
! night, and a favorable answer ia
j awaited.
I saw Captain McGee to-day relative
to the matter and asked him when he
; expected to leave for Havana. He said
he was not at liberty yet to say any
thing on the subject, except that the
naval authorities had requested the use
i of his tug and negotiations were pend
ing. He had come here under charter
to tow the schooner Belle O'Neil, but
I if the Government desired his vessel
i to go on the more important mission of
, assisting the Maine at Havana, the
i schooner's charter could be annulled
: and another tug sent here to tow the
O'Neil to her destination. He said the
Right Arm was thoroughly equipped
with every available appliance for the
purposes of wrecking, had ample power
to easily handle the Maine's heaviest
guns and experienced divers to make
I a critical examination of the ship's bot
tom. An ordinary diver, no matter
how willing, could not render decided
services for various reasons. The
waters of Havana harbor are not clear,
on the contrary are foul and muddy,
making it questionable in his opinion
if anything could be discerned under
the surface even by the aid of electric
lights.
Again the Maine is known to be set
tled deep in the mud, making it im
possible for a diver to go under her
bottom except with the assistance of
the most modern appliances. These are
found aboard the Right Arm, and a
diver could dig an eight-foot hole
clean under the vessel.
SENATE INVESTIGATION
OF THE DISASTER
Passage of a Resolution Directing
the Naval Affairs Committee
to Make an Inquiry.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â The gal
leries were filled to-day when the Sen
ate convened, the crowd of spectators
doubtless being attracted by the prob
ability of further debate upon Cuban
affairs or matters connected with the
catastrophe to the battle-ship Maine.
Allen of Nebraska introduced the fol
lowing resolution:
"Resolved, That the Committee on
Naval Affairs be and is hereby directed
to make a thorough inquiry into the
destruction of the battle-ship Maine in
Havana harbor on the 15th inst. and
to report to the Senate."
The resolution was passed â without a
word of debate.
The joint resolution providing for the
taking of the bodies of officers and men
from the wrecked battle-ship and for
the recovery of valuable property on
the ship, which was passed by the
House of Representatives last week,
was presented to the Senate and
passed, and it now only needs the Pres
ident's approval. It carries an appro
priation of $200,000.

NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â There was

any day since news reached it of the
destruction of the battleship Maine.
Officers in full uniform paraded about,
there was an extra force of yard po

tions to become blue jackets to equip
several such vessels as the unfortunate
Maine.
Fully 800 applicants presented them
selves to Lieutenant Purcell, recruiting
officer on the Cob dock. When he had
inspected them they were questioned
by Chief Yeoman John Cross, who in
turn passed them to Surgeon John M.
Edgar and Assistant Surgeon James
Dunbar. As the Government needed
only ninety-one sailors immediately,
the majority of the applicants were
turned away. Their names and ad
dresses were taken, however, as is the
rule, and they stand first on the list
for future calls. All the needed men
were soon obtained. They are twenty
landsmen, twenty coal passers, forty
apprentices of the third class, six ma
chinists of the second class and five
shipwrights.
WARSHIPS
ARE MOVING
NORTHWARD
South Atlantic Squadron
on trje Way to the
Caribbean Sea.
Both the Navy and War Deparl
ments Actively Preparing
Defensive and Offensive
Measures.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21. â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: In accordance with the
administration's policy of being
prepared for emergencies, the
vessels comprising the South
Atlantic squadron are now on
their way to the Carribean Sea,
and orders were issued to-day
directing the completion of re
pairs to the monitor Terror
within forty-eight hours.
The Navy Department has kept se
cret the orders sent some days ago to
the cruiser Cincinnati, the flagship of
the South Atlantic station, and the
gunboat Castine, to come north and
join the vessels of the North Atlantic
station. I learned to-day that the gun
boat Castine left Para, -Brazil, several
days ago for the Barbadoes, and that
she will be joined later at that point by
the Cincinnati. It is officially stated at
the department that the reason why
vesssels have left Para, Brazil and
come to waters within the North At
lantic station is that yellow fever is
raging in Brazilian ports and in order
to prevent any of the men catching
the disease it was determined to have
them come farther north.
On the other hand, I understand that
the vessels were ordered to leave Mon
tevideo some weeks ago and proceed
to Bahai, Brazil, and upon their ar
rival at that point they were directed
to continue their voyage to Para. In
structions were sent to ships upon their
arrival at Para directing them to pro
ceed to the Barbadoes, and it is ex
pected that the ships will arrive at
that point within a few days. The dis
tance from Para to the Barbadoes is
1150 miles-a five days' voyage for the
Cincinnati and Castine. With^ these
two ships at the Barbadoes the Lnited
States will be represented in the waters
south of Cuba by the armored cruiser
Brooklyn, protected cruiser Cincinnati,
and gunboats Wilmington, Castine
Annapolis and Vicksburg. The gunboat
Newport is at Greytown, Nicaragua,
with the Nicaragua Canal Commission.
Orders issued in regard to the com
pletion of repairs to the Terror con
template getting that ship ready for
service in two days. Naval Constructor
Stahl has been informed that the de
partment authorized him to employ
men night and day on the monitor.
Captain O'Neil, Chief of the Bureau
of Ordnance, directed the ordnance of
ficers at Norfolk navy yard to place
ammunition on board the Terror, 'and
when completed she will drop down to
Hampton Roads, where she will await
sailing orders. The department has not
definitely determined where to send
the ship. The probabilities are that
she will proceed to New York harbor
and remain there for the protection of
that port in case of emergency.
The department has taken measures
to protect several ports along the
northern coast by monitors. For in
stance, the monitor Amphitrite is at
Port Royal, and could in case of neces
sity proceed to Charleston in a very
few hours. The monitor Puritan, the
repairs to which are also being pushed,
will be kept at Hampton Roads for
service in protection of Norfolk, Rich
mond and Washington. The monitor
Miantonomah could be quickly placed
in commission at League Island for
the defense of Philadelphia, and the
Terror will probably be stationed at
New Tork.
What course the authorities will pur
sue for the protection of Boston, Port
land and Augusta in case of emergency
has not yet developed, but the depart
ment arrangements are very complete
and those cities will be taken care of
when it is evident there is danger of
trouble. Acting Secretary of War
Meiklejohn said to me to-day:
"The War Department is not pro
ceeding on the assumption that there
is shortly to be an outbreak of hos
tilities between the United States and
Spain or any other country than there
has been for many months past. The
department at no time failed to appre
ciate the necessity of increasing the
military resources of the country to as
great an extent as the available ap
propriations permit. Perhaps It is bet
ter to say that the department au
thorities are not allowing any oppor
tunity of putting themselves in as good
condition as possible for emergency to
be neglected.
The quartermaster general will im
mediately contract for 45,000 army
blouses and an expenditure of about
$200,000 in various clothing and other
quartermaster material to be made.
The available supply of quartermaster
stores now on hand which have not
been issued to the service is consider
able. lam told by a high official of the
quartermaster department that more
than 25,000 tents are stored at the vari
ous depots ready for issue if needed.
These tents are of different styles and
capable of sheltering between 75,000 and
80.000 men. In addition to this, over
5,000.000 yards of canvas duck is on
hand that might be made into tents in
a short time. There Is likely to be
requisitions of considerable size on tha
department for accommodation of tha
artillery which is being detailed to the
ungarrisoned sea forts. At most of
these points where there are any bar
racks at all they are dilapidated, and
it will be impossible to erect suitable
buildings for occupancy before next
winter. The absence of such buildings,
however, in case of actual hostilities i 3
not a great loss, as in the event of ac
tive operations the conspicuous build
ings at the artillery posts would be de
molished by order of the department
that they might not present a large
target to the enemy's fire. There is on
hand at the quartermaster depart
ment at this time a sufficient supply
of uniforms which will clothe about 50.-
000 men. The sustenance department is
in excellent condition to furnish, am
ple articles of food at short notice for
the sustenance for as many troops as
the quartermaster department is able
to clothe 7 and its facilities for obtaining
large supplies are complete, and the
quartermaster department is fully pre
pared by arrangements made some
time ago to meet an emergency of
transportation of troops and supplies.
ARIZONA COWBOYS
ANXIOUS TO SERVE.
Will Tender a Regiment of Fiying
Cavalry in the Event of
Hostilities.
PRESCOTT, Ariz.. Feb. 21.â As the
result of the sinking of the Maine in
Havana and the feeling prevailing that
volunteers will be called for, initial
steps are being taken in this city to
form the First Regiment of the Ari
zona Flying Cavalry and turn th-k
same over to the service of President/
McKinley in case of war with Spain.
The regiment will be 1000 strong,
equipped with Winchester rifles, forty
five Colt pistols and the horses to be
native-bred. The personnel of the force
will be made up principally of cowboys,
all of whom in addition to speaking the
Spanish language are expert marks
men and skilled horsemen. Colonel A.
O. Brodie, a graduate of West Point,
class of '68, is to chosen the comman
der- of the regiment and in a few days
he will be en route to Washington to
officially ask permission to organize the
body.

DID SOBRAL
ACT AS SPY
FOR SPAIN?
Too Much Information Has
Been Obtained by the
Naval Attache.
With the Disgraced Ex-Minister de
Lome the Officer Has Acted
in a Most Suspicious
iVlanner.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21â Lieutenant-Commander Pobral stated to-day
that he is still the naval attache of the Spanish Legation in Washing
ton.
NEW YORK. Feb. 21.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: With
the submission of all the facts in the
case to the Spanish Government
through Minister Woodford, the Sohral
incident will be closed as far as this
government is concerned.
The State Department officials ac
cept in good faith the statements of
Senor Dubosc that the recall of Lieu
tenant-Commander Sobral as navrxl at
tache at the legation in Washington
vas gazetted at Madrid on January 21,
and on account of the pressure of work
at the legation the communication to
the State Department of the fact of
Sobral's recall was neglected. Thus,
if these are the facts. Lieutenant-Com
mander Sobral's statements, as pub
lished in the Herald, were those oniy
of a Spanish naval officer on waiting
orders.
Senor Dubosc, Charge d'Affaires of
the Spanish legation, called upon As
sistant Secretary Day this morning in
response to a note pent to him by the
Secretary of State on Saturday even
ing, after Secretary Long had com
municated to the State Department the
facts regarding the Herald interview.
At the department he left a written
statement to the effect that Lieutenant-
Commander Sobral had been gazetted
at Madrid as recalled on January 24,
and that Lieutenant Ramon Carraza y
Reguera had been designated as his
successor. Senor Dubosc then ex
plained that the former Minister, Senor
de Lome, had overlooked the matter
nv.ying this intelligence to the
Department.
Shortly after his departure the As
sistant Secretary paid a visit to the
"White House. In the conference with
the President he informed the latter
of Senor Dubosc's call at the depart
ment and his apology for not com
municating before the intelligence of
Lieutenant-Commander Sobral's recall.
Minister Woodford will be informed of
all the details of Sobral's interview in
the Herald and of Senor Dubosc's ex
planation regarding the date of his
recall made at the State Department
to-day by mail. Minister Woodford
will then communicate this to the
Madrid authorities, and when he has
done this the interest of the United
States in the whole matter will be
ended.
It will remain for Spain to censure
or ignore Lieutenant-Commander So
bral's indisretion and the negligence of
the members of the legation as she sees
fit.
Notwithstanding the explanation of
Dubosc that Lieutenant-Com
mand, r SobraJ has not been the naval
attache of the Spanish legation since
January 24, the telegram of condolence
at the Maine disaster signed "Sobral.
naval attache," received several days
ago. is on file at the Navy Department.
It is stated upon the most reliable
authority that Lieutenant-Commander
Sobral in the last two years has visited
every important fortification on the
Atlantic Coast, and has gleaned from
his observations detailed information
of the greatest value. He has in
spected many ships of our navy, both
in commission and while under con
struction, and he and Senor de Lome,
in the last administration, obtained
p< issession of such unpublished charts
and plans in the possession of the
Navy Department as they desired.
While it has not been known that
Lieutenant-Commander Sobral has ob
tained information by illegitimate
methods, the suspicions of irregular
acts on his part in the vicinity of the
fortification in Charleston harbor last
summer and of his making sketches
and investigations in New York harbor
in a pleasure boat some months ago
are being revived and are believed to
be warranted by many who were ac
quainted with his movements. It is
understood that the plans and draw
ings of the submarine torpedo system
in Xew York harbor never came
into Lieutenant-Commander Sobral's
hands. They are in the personal charge
of Brigadier-General John M. Wilson,
chief of engineers of the army, and
they are not known to have ever gone
out of his possession and that of his
immediate assistant, and have never
been shown to any but authorized of
ficials of the War Department.
CLOSE CONTEST FOR

Election.
WOODLAND, Feb. 21.â The postof flees
in the Second District have been giving
Congressman Hilborn a great deal of
worry. Indeed he regards tht'm as the
greatest stumbling block in the way of
his renomination. At Dixon the party
was so evenly divided that he declined to
make a choice between the contestants,
E. J. McÃride and Claus Frahm. He ad
vised an election, otherwise he would al
low the incumbent to hold over.
McLfride and Frahm accepted the con

WOODLAND, Feb. 21.â A deal was con
summated to-day by which there will be
a change in the ownership and the politics
of the Dixon Tribune, the only Demo
cratic newspaper in Northern Solano.
A. L. Henry, for many years editor and
half-owner, sold his interest to F. A. Hut

LOADING SHELLS AT BLACK POINT.
iII : SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1898.
JAMES R. KEENE
A BIG BEAR
Credited With Lifting Mil
lions Out of Wall
Street.
The Old San Francisco Oper
ator Is Not in Good
Humor.
It Is Apparent That He Haa Inside
Sources of Information on
Cuba.
Bpeclftl Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 21.â James R.
Keene is said to be on top in Wall street
again. He and D. O. Mills are credit
ed with being the chief factors In a
bear movement in the market to-day,
which made immense profits and losses
for speculators. Reports in Wall street
say he made a fortune this morning.
He has been a pronounced bear for
some days, and upon the slight re
covery this morning put out addition
al short lines. On the scales on which
he generally conducts operations he
stands to win close on to $1,000,000
when he has cashed in his profits.
Lines of a hundred thousand shares
is an ordinary business for Mr. Keane.
He is apparently in a position to have
advance information of all the facts
in connection with the Cuban matter.
He has been assisted in his bear cam
paign by the scare which is prevailing
through the banks.
Mr Keene was seen this afternoon
at the office of Talbot J. Taylor, his
son-in-law. "Mr. Keene, it is report
ed on the street that you have made
to-day a cool million. It would be very
interesting to know how you made it,"
said the reporter.
"Oh, no\ it isn't true," said Mr.
Keene, In an irritated tone. "You must
not listen to all the stories you hear on
the street. If I could tell you anything
I would be glad to do so, but there is
nothing to tell."
He walked into his private office, and
declined to be further interviewed.
Notwithstanding the assertion of Mr.
Keene that he did not make a million,
the street was confident that when he
realizes his profits it will not be far
from that figure.
The fact that it was reported that D.
O. Mills was alsu a heavy bear manipu
lator gave rise to a report that the two
men had been working in conjunction.
This was a mistake. They operated in
dependently. The heaviest attacks of
Mr Keene were upon sugar, though,
during the day, he took a fiver at al
most everything that promised a profit.
Under the combined pounding ot Keene
and others, sugar fell from 128 to 125%.
; Burlington fell from 97% to 97%, Man
! hattan from 112% to 109, St. Paul, 94%
! to 93V4. and Union Pacific, 31% to 30.
i Standard Oil liquidating certificates,
i which have for a long time been the
j feature of the outside market, broke 23
! points to-day. Saturday's closing price
was 413. The opening price to-day was
399, from which it receded by steady
degrees to 390. The entire market on
the "curb" was weak, in sympathy with
the general market.
BIBLE AND "OLD GLORY"
NMLED TO A BRIDGE.
A Peculiar Find Near Salinas, to
Which Is Attached Deep
Mystery.
SALINAS, Feb. 21.â A Bible nailed to a
bridge is a rather peculiar thing to find,
but when an American flag is draped
arouml it the idea is still more romantic.
A vivid imagination could surmise all
kinds of reasons why the book was first
â¢. â â¢ â â¢â <Y t thr> stnrs and stripes and
then nailed to the bridge. Tom Watson, a
... . ... im ile Terra country,
while crossing the Salinas bridge on the
Monterey road yesterday found a large
family Bible opened at the book of Job
and all four corners nailed down to a
large upright beam of the first span. An
American Hag was draped around the Bi
ble and the effect produced a weird fancy
in Mr. Watson's mind. After a thorough
examination he decided to notify the au
thorities in this city.
Deputy Sheriff Nesbit upon receiving
the information proceeded out to the
scene this morning. While there he made
a thorough search in the river bottom
lands, thinking perhaps some one had
committed suicide. His quest was unsuc
cessful. It is thought that some peculiar
ly tragical facts will be disclosed when
the thorough investigation is made.
GENERAL MILES'
WARLIKE PLANS
CARRIED OUT
San Francisco Now Has
the Best Fortified
Harbor.
While the Defenses of the Country
Are Being Strengthened There
Is a Prospect of an Official
Clash.
While army officers stationed In this j
department uo not entertain the feeling
that war between the United States
and Spain Is Impending or inevitable,
they contend that It is prudent for
our Government to get ready for war.
They do not admit that the present ac
tivity can be accounted for by reason
of the disaster to the battle-ship Maine
In the harbor of Havana, but assert
that orders to hasten the work of
mounting guns and strengthening the
fortifications were issued before the la
mentable catastrophe occurred.
Major-General Nelson A. Miles, com
manding the United States army, seems
to have views of his own, which may
not be in strict harmony with the no
tions of Secretary Alger and his as
sistants of the War Department. Miles
doubled the force of sentinels on the
works defending the coast. He ordered
troops to take station wherever high
power modern guns were in position.
He ordered forward supplies of ammu
nition to be placed in readiness for im
mediate use. He ordered proper vigi
lance to protect the ordnance and mu
nitions of war from destruction by acts
of treachery. When The Call an
nounced that such orders had been
-iven to the army the Assistant Secre
tary of War in Washington denied that
such measures of vigilance and prepar
ation had been authorized by the Secre
tary of War. It is the impression now
that General Miles means to command
the army in case of war. It has come
to be the recognized policy that the
Secretary of War commands in time of
peace When General Sherman was at
the head of the army he found that he
had less inlluer.ee in the direction of
army affairs than a clerk in the War
Department, so he left Washington in
disgust and established his headquar
ters in St. Louis General Sheridan
had a similar experience. There may
be a design now to ignore Miles, but
his orders to the department command
ers are being executed.
Eighty tons of empty shells for the
fifteen-inch guns at Lime Point were
placed aboard lighters at Fort Ma
son yesterday and conveyed to the
Fort Baker wharf on the Marin shore.
The quartermaster's department sup
plied the lighters and tugs. The trans
fer of powder for the shells will soon
be made.
Colonel James M. Moore, chief quar
termaster of the department, sent a
train of four mule teams yesterday
from the Presidio to Fort Baker. The
mules and wagons went by ferry to
Sausallto. The train will haul the
ordnance stores from the Fort Baker
wharf to the post over one of the steep
est grades in the country-
Fort Baker (Lime Point) is garri
soned by Battery L, Third Artillery,
Captain Frank W. Hess commanding,
and Lieutenant Edwin O. Sarratt.
General Shafter has issued orders re
lieving First Lieutenant William E.
Birhimer, Battery C, Third Artillery,
and Captain Euclid B. Frick, assistant
surgeon, from duty at the Presidio, and
directing them to report to the com
manding officer at Fort Baker for
duty.
The high power modern guns â
twelve-inch riflesâ at Fort Baker are
supplied with ammunition from Be
nicia Arsenal. The present supply for
the modern breech-loading rifles is
limited, but will soon be augmented.
Troops of the Third Artillery are on
duty at the extensive works on the
bluffs near Fort Point. Sentinels are
posted to warn away intrusive specta
tors. The guns and carriages have
been closely inspected. The maga
zines contain a fair supply of ammuni
tion.
Two more of the ten-inch breech
loading rifles arrived from the East yes
terday. The big guns are in the
freight yard of the Southern Pacific
and will soon be placed on disappear
ing carriages near Fort Point. The
emplacements are ready and but little
time should be required to place the
guns in position for use.
Apart from the fire of effective mod
ern batteries of Fort Baker and Fort
Point the fire of sixteen heavy mortars
and three powerful dynamite guns
could be concentrated on an approach
ing fleet. The work of fortifying San
Francisco is well advanced. The har
bor, if not impregnable, is better pro
tected by heavy guns and natural ad
vantages of defense than any other
harbor of the United States.
Officers and enlisted men of the army
are gratified to hear that Congress is
now ready to authorize two more
regiments of artillery. The additional
artillerymen are needed to man thÂ«
new guns recently placed in position.
In emergency the infantry coy.id be
called on to perform service at the
batteries and the National Guard
might be utilized as a reserve force,
but neither class could take the place
of trained artillerymen. The first de
mand now is for ammunition, and the
second is for soldiers_to man the guns.

CLAIMS A SAN
RAFAEL ESTATE
Putative Widow of George E.
Dixon Demands Legal
Recognition.
Declares She Was Married by Con
tract to the Man Who Com
mitted Suicide.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 21.â A woman call
nig herself Mary E. Rise Dlckson ap
peared here to-day, claiming to be the
widow of the late George E. Dickson,
who committed suicide at the Grand Cen
tral Hotel on January 11, 1597. The woman
filed her application for the distribution
of the estate to her In the Superior Court
this morning, and it has created a sen
sation in San Rafael. She claims that
she and Dickson were married by con
tract in January, 1897, just before Dlck
son committee! suicide.
George E. Dtckson came to Marin Coun
ty in the early sixties and took up the
dairying industry on White's Hill, after
ward moving to Fairfax and engaging in
farming. There he accumulated about
$40,000. He came to San Rafael and lived
at the Central Hotel, and was known by
everybody in town. Frequently he said
that he would never get married, as he
was afraid a woman would not marry
him for himself but for his money.
Mary Rise was formerly engaged as a
domestic at the Parisian House, at this
place, and It was there she met Dickson.
She claims they grew fond of each other,
and when he lived at the Central Hotel
they became engaged, and finally married
by contract.
Dickson's suicide was tragic. He cut
his throat and his wrists and allowed
himself to slowly bleed to death in his
mom at the Central Hotel. Just before
his death he made some peculiar trans
actions as regards money matters, and in
a case before Judge Angellottl it was
held that he was insane at the time he
made them.

EXPLAINING A SPASM.
PERHAPS it is due to the New York Journal
to explain why it made itself ridiculous by of
fering a $50,000 reward. for the wrecker of the j
Maine. The freak did puzzle people who while con- j
scious that the paper in question failed to represent a j
high order of intelligence or morals believed it con- |
trolled by something above idiocy. The matter has j
been cleared away. The Journal was scooped on the \
great tragedy of the Maine. The Herald came out |
with a full story, the Sun with a fairly good one, the j
Journal with nothing. Imagine the grief which must j
have held sway in the office when the proprietor ;
found that all his young men had been sleeping.
A coup d'etat was necessary. The anguish must j
be assuaged. To fire everybody was not practicable, j
To conceal the fact of having been beaten was equally j
out of the question. So it was decided to make the
silly offer, not that it was expected to be impressive, i
but that there was hope it might attract enough at
tention to divert the public eye from the awful scoop, j
Straightway the Journal went into hysterics. Whether j
it offered a billion dollars or a pound of caramels j
made not the slightest difference; it just had to do
something.
GETTING INTO LINE.
GENERAL GROSVENOR, in his recent ad
dress at a meeting of the Republican Con
gressional Campaign Committee, pointed out
the importance of organizing for work at once, and
directed the attention of his colleagues to the elec
tion in Oregon, which is to take place in June. That
election is to be the first State contest to be waged
this year, and the result is certain to have more or
less effect upon the popular mind throughout the
country.
The struggle is the more important because it is
to include national as well as local affairs. Con
gressmen in addition to State officers and members
of the Legislature are to be chosen. Moreover, the
financial issue will form the dividing line between the
opposing parties. Such at any rate is the outlook at
present, and it is not likely anything will occur to
materially change the situation.
At a convention held in Portland a short time
?.go the Republican League Clubs of the State re
affirmed the last national platform, indorsed McKin
ley's speech at New York as a true exposition of the
monetary policy of the party, and resolved: "That
we are in especial accord with the administration and
its wise and efficient Secretary of the Treasury, Ly
man J. Gage, in their efforts to resist silver mono
metallism and to give additional stability and strength
to our present financial system."
The League Clubs, of course, do not bind the
rank and file of the party like a State convention,
but nevertheless as these clubs represent much of
the strength and leadership of the Republicans of
the State there can be little doubt the State platform
will be substantially the same as that adopted at Port
land. The Republicanism of Oregon is therefore on
the side of sound money. It will make a straight
fight on that issue and accept no compromise of any
kind whatever.
While there has been no binding action on the
part of the various factions in the State opposed to
sound money, there are abundant evidences that fu
sion will be accomplished and Democrats, Populists
and so-called Silver Republicans will act together in
the contest. The financial issue, therefore, will be the
dominant one in the struggle, and Oregon will be
the first of the States to record the vote of her citi
zens on the present phase of this momentous prob
lem.
The beginning of energetic work on the part of
the Congressional Campaign Committee and the
rapidity with which the opposing parties in Oregon
arc lining up for the contest, are incentives to the
Republicans of California to set about preparing for
the battle. This is the time to start the formation
of clubs and to make arrangements for a complete
organization of the rank and file of the party
throughout the State. The Republicans of California
cannot afford to be laggards on the eve of the great
battle for honest money and national honor. An
appeal for Republican organization has been made
at Washington nnd we should be among the fore
most in responding to it.
That bodies of the dead are being robbed at any
of the city hospitals is an ugly rumor. The officials
ir charge of the hospital should be the first to de
mand investigation. If they arc innocent the fact
can doubtless be established and if they are guilty
to send them to the penitentiary would be actual
flattery.
THOSE WHO DRAW INTEREST.
THE Bryan Democratic manifesto, to which
we have referred, devotes to destruction
the drawers of interest who avoid the
risk of active business. The Populist mani
festo characterizes the same class, but calls
them "traitors," who are to be shot down,
and "Tories," who are to be expelled from the coun
try. The red rhetoric of the Populist manifesto be
comes pale pink in that of the silver Republicans,
which accuses these pernicious drawers of interest of
an "assault of the enemy on the last ramparts of our
social and industrial independence." In all three of
the documents the phraseology of bloody war and
stirring military movement is used.
Again we ask who are these drawers of interest,
these "traitors" and "Tories," this "enemy" assault
ing "the last ramparts," within which Mr. Bryan and
Senators Jones and Butler are standing under arms
to repel the foe?
Will some organ of these three proclamations in
California name some of the men in this State who
"avoiding the risks of active business merely draw
interest," with the purpose of transferring to them
selves "the property of all those engaged in active
business"? â¢
In this State 159,000 depositors in savings banks
draw interest on $131,000,000 of capital. A' vast ma
jority of them are laboring people who have thriftily
saved their wages. Another large class among them
are small shopkeepers and vendors of one kind and
another. Are they "traitors" and "Tories"? Life
and fire insurance companies are another class of in
terest drawers. They insure for the premiums paid
by the people. These premiums they invest at in
terest to accumulate a surplus out of which to pay
losses. If they insure a man on a life policy for
$1000 they become his trustee for that amount of
money. In this way they are trustees for hundreds
and hundreds of millions of dollars to the American
people. Are they the drawers of interest who avoid
"the risks of active business"? Are they the
"traitors" and "Tories" deserving of death or
exile?
Another very large class of interest drawers are
the building and loan associations, a favorite means
for the investment of a small surplus by millions of
people. They have enabled the working classes to
own their homes all over the country and have given
to hundreds of thousands of families that safe and
happy anchorage which comes with possession of
their shelter. Are the building and locin associations
the enemy "avoiding the risks of active business" for
the purpose of gaining all the property of the coun
try? Are they the "traitors" and "Tories" who are
besieging the last ramparts?
What class of interest drawers is left to the oblit
erating besom of the patriotic partnership of the
three wings of fiatism? Is it the commercial bank
ers who loan on personal security? Do they take no
risk in active business? In truth and fact they carry
all the risks of every kind of business. The risk of
every crop that grows, of ever}' train that moves and
every ship that sails, is theirs. They distribute and
are trustees of all that part of the loan fund of the
country that animates trade on the credit of commer
cial paper. Take one business enterprise in San
Francisco as evidence of the criminal machination of
these commercial banks, denounced in these procla
mations for "confiscating the lives and liberty of-the
laboring millions." Within a few weeks thousands
went jocund as to a holiday to witness the launching
of the Chitose at the Union Iron Works. She cost,
say, a million. The company that built her employs
in that and similar construction 3000 men. Their
wages, feed, clothe and house 12,000 people, young
and old. In its work that company may be a bor
rower of millions on commercial paper, carried as a
credit by the commercial banks. Let us suppose that
it borrows a million of the loan fund handled by the
Bank of California, the property of 10,000 depositors.
If the commercial bank were not there as a trustee of
that loan fund the million could not be borrowed, for
a separate transaction with each of its 10,000 owners
would be a business impossibility. The bank as
trustee does it in one transaction, on one note. The
company draws on the resulting credit to buy mate
rial and to pay the wages of 3000 men. When the
ship is finished Japan pays its price and the company
pays its note and the million goes back into the loan
fund to be used over and over again in like opera
tions in every department of active business. This,
then, is the process denounced by these politicians as
"the repression of life and happiness," the "cruel con
fiscation of the lives and liberty of the laboring mil
lions," "the most stupendous crime that has been
committed in the annals of civilization." In the hy
pothetical case of the Union Iron Works ask the
12,000 persons dependent on this distribution of the
loan fund by banks if they have thereby been put
"under a hard and bitter burden." Let these three
gangs of politicians who issue these three proclama
tions â not one of whom earns wages or pays them â
let them make plain to the laboring millions where
the credits will arise necessary to the great lines of
business in which their bread is earned when these
drawers of interest have been suppressed and these
"traitors" have been put to the sword and these
"Tories" have been expelled from the country.
SEE TriflT Th|E SHIPS ORE SAFE.
THE rush of travel and freight to Alaska has
already been characterized by the loss of life
and property, probably through the unsea
worthy condition of craft used in that trade.
When the '40 excitement in California broke out
everything that would hold together long enough to
float out of port was drafted into transportation
service. By loading beyond capacity many ships
were made unseaworthy and there were appalling
tragedies as the result.
Our Government regulations for inspection of
hulls and boilers were not as good as now. There
is also more knowledge of the safe stowage of a
cargo and the dangers of overloading.
In the present demand for transportation many
ships, on both coasts, that have been long out of
commission, are being put in now, and many that
were built for an entirely different service are being
diverted to this.
It has been assumed that Alaskan waters are very
safe to navigate, but the striking on unknown rocks
and subjection to strange currents seem to prove
that caution is needed in those quiet waters to a
greater degree than on the open ocean.
Already there has been sufficient warning to
stimulate the strictest official oversight. The Gov
ernment provides a survey of ships which is a guide
to the load they may safely carry and also an inspec
tion of hulls and boilers.
There is every reason to believe that this official
oversight is rigid in the port of San Francisco, and
that . its efficiency will be maintained here. It is
already noticed that this is an element in the at
traction of Alaska transportation. Travelers and
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1898.
cargo seek a port of departure where official vigilance
will be a guaranty against overgreed. The marine
underwriters are also affected by these considerations
and are willing to give better and cheaper indemnity
on risks than where events prove that there is official
laxity. While there is an element of adventure in
these mining rushes that blunts caution for the time
being, the lesson of a few disasters restores ordinary
prudence in the conduct of men and brings such
business as travel and transportation back to the.
plain principles of certainty and safety. This port
having the largest continuous trade, coastwise and
deep water, of any on the Pacific Coast, has of
necessity the best official inquiry into all the means
of making that trade as safe as possible against dis
aster," and this fact is not unnoted among the cal
culations of Alaska travel and commerce.
OUR SPECIAL NEWS SERVICE.
\A OST gratifying in every respect have been the
/ \ manifold evidences given of public apprecia
* tion of the special' service provided by The !
Call to supply the popular demand for news of the
latest developments at Havana. In every town to
which the swift trains have carried it The Call has
been eagerly received by the people and every copy
placed on sale has found a prompt and early pur
chaser.
This service is an illustration of the zeal and
energy with which The Call fulfills the duty of a
great journal to the public. As soon as the startling
news came ofthe destruction of the Maine the man
agers of The Call recognized that there would be an
intense and impatient eagerness on the part of all
classes of people to learn every detail and circum
stance of the disaster. They, therefore, at once set
about providing for the swiftest possible transmission
to the public of every item of news, or information,
that could be gathered by the Associated Press, by
the special correspondents of The Call and those of
its ally, the New York Herald.
In performing the work of distributing the news
bulletins were sent as rapidly as received to all the
principal cities of the State and promptly displayed
on The Call bulletin boards. That was much, but
it was not enough. The popular excitement de
manded far fuller reports than could be given by
bulletins. To meet this demand The Call started its
special trains carrying the paper to Sacramento, San
Jose, Fresno, Monterey, Marysville, Woodland,
Ukiah, and all intermediate points, in time for the
people to read at their breakfast tables.
There was no attempt on the part of The Call at
self-advertising or self-laudation in this matter. It
was an enterprise of legitimate journalism undertaken
to meet a popular demand for news at a great crisis
in the affairs of the nation. It was not done for
rivalry with other papers, nor to cause factitious in
terest in The Call itself. It was done solely as a
means of meeting a need of the time, and conse
quently may be accepted by the public as a proof
that The Call will always furnish the news as swiftly
as any emergency or popular demand may require.
As was foreseen and announced yesterday the en
terprise of The Call forced the Examiner, now in
the sere and yellow leaf of decadent journalism, to
make a spasdomic effort at enterprise itself. How
severe the strain of the spasm was upon the jaundiced
system of the faker was displayed by the way the
paper screamed in type yesterday over the fact that
it had followed The Call and sent out special trains
of its own. It filled so many columns with steaming
and puffing descriptions of the trains that an unin
formed reader who chanced to see the paper would
have thought no such feat had ever before been ac
complished by a newspaper in all the history of
journalism.
The Examiner was two days late in following The
Call. Our special train service had impressed the
public and ceased to be a wonder before the slow
going faker had found out that important item of
local news. Not until the second day of our special
service, when we published an announcement of it,
did the Examiner know what was going on. Even
at the present time it is not giving The Call the
complete imitation that is needed to meet the emer
gency. The people demand special trains only for
the sake of the news the trains bring, and since the
Examiner has been threatened with prosecution for
violating copyright and stealing news from The Call
and the New York Herald it has been compelled to
get out Klondike editions, or devote whole columns
of space to florid descriptions of its special trains in
order to make a show of having any news at all.
THE experiment in city government known as
Greater New York is turning out very much
as was anticipated by observing students of
local government throughout the country. It was
estimated prior to consolidation that the amount of
money which would be required annually to con
duct the consolidated government would not exceed
$75,000,000. Indeed, some of the enthusiastic advo
cates of the charter thought that the expenses could
be brought down to $60,000,000. It is now found
that the budget for the first year will be at least
$100,000,000, and there is every prospect that when
the greater city is placed in thorough working order
a great deal more than this will be required.
As in most experiments in municipal government
something "new" has caused the kicrease. In the
case of New York it is the borough system. While
the charter creating the greater city was pending the
borough system was regarded as the most wonder
ful discovery of the age. The politicians solemnly
reiterated that the only thing necessary to make the
people of New York the happiest people on earth
was the adoption of the borough system. Yet nearly
all the department estimates made by the various
heads of the new government show that many hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in addition to the com
bined sums expended on the different cities prior to
consolidation will have to be spent in caring for
them under the new dispensation.
It is found, for instance, that the Health Depart
ment of the greater city, which it was thought would
cost less than it cost under the old law, will require
an expenditure of at least $350,000 more than was
spent upon all the Health Departments of all the
cities under the old system. This is caused by a
multiplication of new offices and the general intro
duction of higher salaries.
The charter merged the various park boards into
a single organization. The new board is going to
cost a quarter of a million dollars more annually
than its little predecessors. On the other hand all
the departments want more engineers, more lawyers,
more experts, higher salaries, more clerks and more
money. The interesting thing about the entire ex
periment is that Boss Croker is spending the money
through Mayor Van Wyck, and that gentleman is
taking good care that none except loyal Tammany
ites get the offices. On the whole it may be said
that the people of the greater city are in a fair way
to be soon treated to a dose of "economical" gov
ernment which will last them for a long time.
GREATER NEW YORK-

The premature explosion of a shell In
a six-inch quick-firing gun on the Brit
ish gunboat Bouncer killed two and
wounded six men. The accident occurred
January 26, while the vessel was at gun
practice near the Nore. Some seven or
eight rounds had been fired, and on the
weapon being again loaded the cartridge
prematurely exploded from some cause
yet unknown. As the breech had not
been locked, and there being no resist
ance, it flew open, the cartridge shell
struck a petty officer and a seaman, kill
ing them on the spot, and the fire severe
ly burned six other men around the gun.
An inquiry into the accident was ordered
the next day, the proceedings of which
were held with closed doors, and its re
sults have not yet been made public.
The Russians have taken out the Dv
Temple water-tube boiler of two torpedo
boats and will replace them with Yarrow
straight tube boilers. The cause alleged
is the rapid deterioration of the Dv Tem
ple boiler tubes owing to Inability of
properly cleaning them out as they have
curved ends at top and bottom.
The British cruiser Diadem, 11,000 tons,
has completed her four hour trial under
forced draught with satisfactory results.
Steam was carried at 291 pounds; the
revolutions were 116, air pressure only
.3 inches, developing 15,861 horse power
and a speed of 20.5 knots. The coal con
sumption was 1.95 pounds per horse
power per hour.
The British admiralty have ordered gas
buoys laid in the roadsted of Spithead to
indicate the anchorage for ships of war.
At Vladivostok a dock, 560 feet in
length* ninety feet wide and thirty feet
of water over the side, has just been
completed. This dock was cut out of the
solid rock, and has been under construc
tion about five years.
The ponderous ice-breaker built in
Denmark for use at Vladivostok has
proved its utility in breaking ice twenty
eight Inches thick and progressing at the
rate of three knots an hour. The prob
abilities are that the harbor can be kept
open barring exceptionally severe win
ters, and the Russian Government has
ordered two more ice-breakers.
The Britsh cruiser Powerful did not
develop any extraordinary speed during
her recent voyage from Portsmouth to
Shanghai. Her average speed did not
exceed thirteen knots. On her last stage
of the trip from Singapore to Shanghai
the orders were to make the distance at
the rate of twenty knots, but for some
reasonâ said to be due to condensers get
ting out of order â the cruiser averaged
only thirteen and a half knots.
The Spanish armored cruiser Cristobal
Colon has just made a run from Cadiz to
Geneva and averaged nineteen and five
eighths knots under natural draught.
This ship is of practically the same de
sign and size as the Garibaldi recently
delivered to the Argentine Government,
but the latter's speed under the same
conditions as the Cristobal Colon has not
exceeded eighteen and three-eighths knotp.
The Spanish ship is 6#40 tons, and was
purchased from Italy, taking her off the
hands of the builders, as the Govern
ment was in financial straits. She was
then named the Varese and rechristened
when sold to Spain. The sister-ship
Garibaldi, sold to the Argentine, was re
named San Martin.

Jest let that chestnutty idee lay
Till it starves to death in yer cranky head!
Don't stand an' holler
About the dollar
A beln' the idol to which we kneel
While we grind our honor beneath our heel,
An' say we think more o' the greenback rag
Than we do of our Yankee Doodle flag!
Jest stop yer unpatriotic blow,
Fur I tell you, pard, an' I say it slow,
Sech-talk-don't-go!
Jest look at that incident t'other night
When the pride o' the navy, the peerleea
Maine,
With her steel sides shattered went out o' sight
An' the rumor flew It was done by Spain
Like a llghtnln' thrill,
Or a 'lectric chill
The news went scootin' from east to west,
An' right on the altar of every breast
The fires o" loyalty flashed an' blazed.
An' hot-eyed men at the bulletins gazed
An' sot their teeth, while their breath come
hot
As a sulphur breath from the devil's pot.
An' they itched an' twitched fur a chance
to go
An' prove their loyalty by a blow
At the haughty foe!
It want the loss o' the noble ship.
It want the lives o' the gallant crew.
That made men bite at their under lip
An' swear till the winter air was blue!
'Twas the insult hurled
At the Hag unfurled
In regal pride In the Cuban air
That roused the patriots everywhere
To the mood fur a suddent scrap, an' fed
The loyal flames that you say are dead
An' buried so deep ol' Gabriel's trump
'D /ail fur to start 'em on the Jump!
It's a lie, you chump!
So don't you talk in that sassy way
'Bout loyalty seemin' to mope an' lag,
Fur It blazes up till there's hell to pay ,
When an Insult's aimed at that good ol' flag!
From coast to coast
There's a countless host
O' patriots feedln' the loyal fires
That was built by our Revolution sire 3.
An' a chip's on the shoulder of every one
That Is old enough fur to pack a gun'
Our loyalty dead? Say, pard, if I
Had a thought that way I'd go off an' die
Fur a man with them idees hasn't got
No right on earth to a breathin' spot
In a country with patriotism fraught'
That's what!

THE DIPLOMAT'S GREATEST PERIL.
Washington Post.
The Dupuy de Lome episode serves to
recall to mind the fact that the theft of
confidential letters and papers is the one
peril to which diplomats are exposed
more than to any other. The entire Drey
fus affair 1b said to be baaed either on
the theft of a letter from one of the em
bassies, or else on the tampering with a
private letter passing between two for
eign diplomats. Four years ago a clean
sweep was made of all the French ser
vants of the English embassy at Paris,
many of whom had been in the employ
thereof for more than twenty years, ow
ing to Lord Dufferin's confidential old
man servant, Noel, who had been with
the Marquis for the major portion of his
life, seeing one of the French servants
opening the Embassador's dispatch box
with a false key. A trap was set for
him, and the same man was caught in the
act of opening the box and reading the
contents by Mr. MacFerran, who was the
Embassador's private secretary. The
Germany embassy at Paris went through
identically the same experience, and has
now nothing bui domestics of its own
nationality, finding that either through
patriotism, or through love of gain
French servants always try to spy for
the benefit of their own country upon
their foreign masters. Every diplomat
has in hip possession at one time or an
other confidential papers, the betrayal of
which to the Government to which he is
accredited is calculated to do irreparable
injury. Yet the experience of Lord Duf
ferin, as well as of many other equally
shrewd and clever envoys, shows how dif
ficult it is to shield against this peril

men at the nation's capital, and failing
in his attempt, returned to San Francisco,
where he yesterday tried to square him
self by taking a fall, out of an inoffensive
Englishman.
Yesterday morning: President Dole went
out for a drive, accompanied by his sec
retary. They were In an open hack, and
enjoyed Immensely the mild breezes and
warm sunshine, all the more for the
pleasant contrast they afforded to the
terrible frosts the two distinguished vis
itors have lately been experiencing in the
East. So much were they impressed with
the beauty of San Francisco's environs
that when at last they were forced to
return to the hotel they did so with much
regret.
Finally they arrived in front of the Oc
cidental, where Mr. Dole started to alight
just as Valentine Seasons, a loyal subject
of her Majesty Victoria I, Queen of Great
Britain and Ireland and Empress of In
dia, was passing. Valentine has not been
In this country long enough to forget his
native traditions and customs, and had
his trousers rolled up to a point midway
between his ankle and knee. The trousers
were large and baggy, and Mr. Dole, mis
taking one of their checks for a flag in
the pavement, placed his foot on it, with
the result that the scion of a hundred
earls measured his length on the pave
ment. The secretary at once picked Him
up, and expressing in the language of dip
lomacy his profound sorrow for the oc
currence, extended every courtesy in his
power to the unfortunate victim of the
disaster. Owing to the friendly relations
at present existing between England and
Honolulu, it is not thought that any
serious complications will result from the
incident, unless further investigation
proves that the accident was the result of
malice and was authorized by the Ha
waiian Government.
Mr. Seasons threatens to bring the i
matter to the attention of the English
Government and insist that an indemnity ;
be exacted from the Hawaiians to com- ;
pensate him for his loss of dignity and
the damage done to his unmentionables,
which have been rendered utterly worth- '

about the couple. It was confided to her
by Mrs. Brown with a strict injunction
to keep it a profound secret, but, woman
like, she told it to another lady friend,
also with the understanding that secrecy
should be maintained, and in that way
the story became common property, and
is now going the rounds among the
friends of the popular married couple and
causing no end of amusement.
The story goes that Brown woke up one
morning rather earlier than usual, and
addressing himself to his better half, who
had also awakened from her peaceful
slumbers, informed her that he had just
had a dream in which it seems that he
had gone into a millinery store and pur
chased for his adored life partner a beau
tiful. $20 bonnet, incidentally telling her
that it was a delicious dream of a bon
net, to which she sarcastically replied
that most probably it was "only a
dream," and the price had been to him a
hideous nightmare.
Disdaining to notice the cruel reflection
contained in that remark. Brown con
tinued to relate thafin his dream he had
wished to surprise his dear devoted wife,
and instead of ordering the bonnet de
livered he had brought it home with
him. He had laid it down somewhere,
but to save his life he could not remem
ber the precise spot where he had placed
the feminine headgear. He had looked in
every room of the house, still dreaming,
but was unsuccessful in his search, and
concluded: "Mary, I was looking for the
bonnet when I woke up." Mrs. Brown
looked at her husband with a merry
twinkle In her eye, and innocently said:
"Theo, suppose you go to sleep and look
for the bonnet once more, maybe you'll
find it this time." and then she softly
hummed the refrain of that tuneful song,
"I Wonder if Dreams Come True."

roundabout manner:
"I was taking a romantic ramble in
my brother's garden." he said, "and on
coming to a gate I discovered that I had
to climb over it, by which I came into
contact with the first bar and grazed the
epidermis of my leg, which has caused a

BORING FOR STEAM.
The deepest well in the world will soon
be completed near Pittsburg. It is now
more than one mile deep, and when fin
ished it may reach down two miles into
the earth. It is being bored in the in
terest of science. The object in pene
trating so det-ply is to determine just
what the interior of the human footstool
is like. It Is the intention to continue
the boring until something entirely new
is developed. It has long been the the
ory that if it is possible to go deep enough
some new geologic condition or economic
feature would be found to exist. As the
temperature increases the notion grows
that the "natural steam" wilt be en

PARIS. Feb. 21.â The rains to-day
t the crowd about the ap
proaches to the Assizes Court of the
Seine in the Palace of Justice, though
the interior was packed with people.
M. Zola was hissed when he reached
the court.
When the Advocate-General com
menced .his address he declared that
M. Zola's assertions that the Esterhazy
court-martial acquitted a guilty person
In accordance with superior orders re
mained entirely unproved. Major Es
terhazy. he added, could not be the au
thor of the bordereau, and he protested
against certain newspapers accusing
officers of seeking to overthrow the re
port. In conclusion the Advocate-Gen
eral expressed confidence that the jury
would condemn M. Zola.
M. Zola read an address to the court
in which he said that the Premier, M.
Meline, "had the air of giving the jury,
who are charged with the national \
honor, an order to find me guilty."
(Loud protests.)
The presiding Judge said: "You can
not say that the Premier has given an
order to condemn you."
Continuing, M. Zola said: "Such pro
ceedings are an abominable piece of
political manners. I have never insult
ed the army, as has been said, but I
have raised a cry of alarm, and I leave
history to judge and to appreciate my
acts. Thos? who dishonor France are
those who mingle cries of 'Vive l'Arme'
with 'A bas les Juifs' and 'Vive Ester
hazy' after the letters he has written.
(Murmurs.) If lam here it is because
I wished â I asked â to appear before
you, who are the voice of Justice. It
Js for you. gentlemen, that I raise the
cry of alarm and that I wish to bring
out the truth, perhaps unsuccessfully;
but here I stand before you and await
your Justice."
M. Zola complained of the prevail
ing state of lassitude, and exclaimed:
"Your thoughts, which I think I can
read on your faces, are: 'We have had
enough of it. The matter must be
brought to an end.' I am not defend-
: my liberty, gentlemen. In present
ing myself to you, I am defending the
truth. Look me in the face, gentlemen.
Have I been bought, or am I a traitor?
I am a free writer who intends to re
sume his vocation and again take up
his interrupted labors. I indignantly
protest against the charge of being an
Italian.
"No," he added; "I am not defending
my liberty, condemn, then, if you
-wish. It will be but an additional er
ror. It will be the seed which will
germinate and prevent France from
falling into indifference. If the country
is in trouble, the fault lies with the
Government, who, in the hope of saving
pome culprit, has tried to prevent the
truth from coming into the light of
day. The very life of the people Is at
stake. It is for you, gentlemen of the
jury, to utter the truth upon this af
fair and render justice."
M. Z>>la dwelt upon the fact that the
â¢ tire people had been thrown Into
painful anguish through doubts of the
guiltiness of Dreyfus, and said:
"The Government. \yho know all, and
who, like you, are convinced of the in
nocence of Dreyfus, will one day make
it known and will publish it without
running any risk."
Then, raising his voice, M. Zola three
times proclaimed the following>
"Before all the world I swear Drey
fus is innocent."
Loud murmurs and hisses from the
back of the court greeted this utter
ance. M. Zola concluded by saying:
"The day will come when France will
thank me for saving her honor." (Pro
longed uproar.)
M. Laborie, counsel for M. Zola, fol
- lowed with an eloquent speech. His
* opening words, "We are here In defense
of justice and right," were hailed with
loud protests from the back of the
courtroom, and counsel continued, re
proaching the authorities for being "led
astray by passing interests," and with
"not wishing to deal with the Dreyfus
affair, although there are few Senators
or Deputies who doubt his innocence.''
"Nevertheless," continued M. Laborie,
"truth will prevail. The elections will
hot be allowed to pass amid mystery
and ambiguities." (Renewed protests.)
M. Laborie then thanked "all those
- .;ia?<-B of the Intellectual elite of
nee who have had the courage to
for truth and light." Counsel re
<l to the "inspired articles in the
â -," intended to deceive the country.
If a syndicate exists it is a syndi
of good faith and loyalty, whose

-pts of the entire country, and this
ndicate has the greatest faith In

This caused a violent uproar, against
v M. Laborie vehemently protest-
An individual In the back of the
â  i orn shouted:
much have they paid you?"
M. Laborie reiterated: "If we
:. paid such people would have
i us."
M. Laborie then proceeded to re
}> U:e Premier for refusing to al
!ow generals to be judged before a jury,
he ;;sked:

have confidence in It; but it is
tn insult to the army to raise a cry
alarm as M. Zola has done. He
' â  in strong terms, but he did not

In "inclusion, M. Laborie declared
he intended to prove Zola's good
i'h and review the whole affair,
piping into things hitherto un
known." and ihe c/urt adjourned.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 21.â The steamer
Queen had an exciting voyage on her
last trip north, according to letters just
received from Miss Lydla Hatch, a
passenger to Dyea. The steamer was
supposed to carry 550 to 600 passengers,
but Miss Hatch was informed and be
lieves that there were 911 aboard. She
says the captain and crew were new to
the Queen and seemingly did not know
how to handle either so large a steamer
or such a crowd. The table service was
poor, tips being necessary to procure 1
even slight attentions. The jam was I
frightful, the second-class passengers j
monopolizing the public cabin so far I
as possible and devoting their energies
to vaudeville songs.
All this was not a circumstance com
pared with the situation when the
Queen grounded in Wrangel Narrows
after the breaking of a rope connecting
the steering gear and rudder. Whilt
repairs were being made she drifted I
ashore. As the tide went out she listed i
badly and the passengers learned that j
she came within three inches of turn
ing squarely over. The water came
within two inches of her firebox before
the tide turned. The dishes slid off the
table, and from 6 p. m., when the first
table was through, until midnight, the
serving of dinner was suspended.
The scenes aboard were indescrib
able. Miss Hatch and her friends took
a position on the upper deck, where
they had to hang on to the rigging and
railing to prevent falling off. Their
feet hung outside and for five hours
they waited in this uncomfortable posi
tion, ready to jump if the steamer went
over. It rained and hailed during ihis
time and they suffered intensely. Pas- j
sengrers in the cabins and steerage were
greatly excited, many feeling certain
the steamer would soon roll over. Sev
eral women went into hysterics. One
French woman fought her way through j
the crowd and ordered the captain to j
lower the boats, declaring that if he
did not she would cut them down and
then shoot him.
By that time the decks -were almost
perpendicular and the boats on the
upper side could not be touched. Those
on the lower side were lowered after ;
much delay and several men sent j
ashore to watch the tide.
Those were anxious moments for the
Queen'B passengers and crew. Three
inches more and the steamer would
turn over. Another inch and passen
gers and provisions must be hastily
landed on shore. Shouts of rejoicing
went up when the men ashore finally
signaled that the tide had come to a
standstill and would soon be receding.
On the lower deck baggage and freight
had shifted, causing a mix-up of
horses, dogs, freight and steerage pas-
Bengers that is described as frightful !
and terrible. Two mules were killed
outright and some of the animals had
to be hauled out from under the freight. !
The Lynn Canal towns are described
as cold, cheerless, desolate and more or j
less rough, particularly Skaguay. The
writer advises friends going to Alaska
to go first-class, saying that the fare
then is none too good.

town, formed a procession and marched
through the old Spanish town to New
Monterey and thence to Chinatown.
The procession was full of color, many
banners were displayed and firecrackers,
gongs and other nnisy instruments sup
plied the requisite Chinese din. A large
crowd witnessed the display.
The procession was a preliminary to the
annual ring: tournament, one of the great
Chinese festivals, which was celebrated
here this year. Prominent Chinese from
all the surrounding towns and San Fran
cisco were present 'and participated in
the day's ceremonies.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â This was pri

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1898.
BEGINNING OF A KLONDIKE VOYAGE.
The steamer Australia, chartered by the Pacific Coast Steamship Company from the Oceanic Steamship Company, got away
on her maiden trip to Dyea and Skaguay yesterday. There was a big crowd of people down to see heroff. She
took 250 passengers from this port and 350 more will join her at Seattle. All her flags were at half mast on ac
count of the Maine disaster.
KLONDIKE RUSH
IS INCREASING
The Australia Left on Her
First Trip With a
Big Crowd.
She Will Be Followed by the
Steamers Humboldt and
Excelsior To- Day.
An Opposition Line of Steamers Ee
tween South America and This
Port Talked Of.
Three steamers were to have sailed
; for Dyea and Skaguay yesterday, but
only one of them got away. The Hum
! boldt got in early in the morning from
Seattle, and some few repairs have to
be made, but as all her passengers and
freight are ready for her she will prob
ably leave some time this afternoon.
j The Excelsior, for Copper River, was
; also late in completing her round trip,
and she will receive freight and pas
sengers to-day and will get away some
time this evening. The Australia did
come very close to getting away on
schedule time. She was to leave at 2
p. m., but owing to the rush of freight
at the last minute it was two hours
later before she moved away from her
dock. She took away 75 cabin and 170
steerage passengers, and nearly 400
: more await her at Seattle. This trip
will be made to Seattle, Juneau, Dyea
and Skaguay, but thereafter she will
â  run from Seattle to those points dl
i rect, connecting with the Walla Walla,
Umatilla and City of Puebla from this
1 port and with the State of California
] and Columbia, also from this port,
through the George W. Elder and Ore
i gon, which will run from Portland.
The Australia has been fitted out in
a first-class manner to carry 600 pas
sengers. The old steerage has been
! fitted up for first-class passengers and
! quarters for the steerage have been
I fitted up in the 'tween decks forward.
j Electric lights have been carried
i throughout the entire ship, and an cx
i tra force of men has been put to work
! in the steward's department and extra
! cooks employed, so that everybody
i who travels by the Australia will be
\ well taken care of. All the old heads
of departments, save the purser, have
staid by the ship. Purser Campbell,
who for years has been a favorite on
I the Umatilla, but who lately has been
on the Victorian, running to Dyea and
Skaguay, was brought from Puget
Sound to join the Australia. He arrived
yesterday and at once took charge of
affairs and will remain with the Aus
tralia as long as she is kept on the
Dyea-Skaguay route.
The Australia took away quite a
number of mules and over 100 dogs.
She is the first vessel that has left here
with the proper accommodations for
the latter animals. Up over the house
built for the accommodation of mules
and horses kennels were put up for the
dogs, and they will be fed and cared
for during the trip. As the vessel will
carry a rather small amount
of freight in comparison with the num
ber of passengers, nearly 300 tons of
pig iron was put in her hold before the
work of loading began. She will thus
be in fine trim to make quick time,
and Captain Houdlett expects to make
a record-breaking run from here to Se
attle.
The talk of an opposition steamship
line between South and Central Ameri
can ports and San Francisco has been
revived. Two large and wealthy cor
porations, The Compania Sud Ameri
cana de Vapores, and the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company, are said to be
engaged in the venture. The former
company will run its steamers between
South America and ports in Panama.
They will leave Valparaiso once a
week, touching at Coquimbo, Antofa
gasta, Iquique, Mollendo and Callao,
arriving at Panama in ten days. Then
the Pacific Steam Navigation Com
pany will take up the running, touch
ing at the principal Central American
and Mexican ports, making the run to
San Francisco in twelve days. In this
way the passage from Valparaiso, can
be made in a little over three weeks.
Boone's Petition Denied.
The United States Circuit Court, Judges
Ross, Gilbert and Hawley. sitting in bank
yesterday denied the petition of John L.
Boone, the disbarred attorney, asking for
a rehearing. His affidavit wherein he
charged certain other lawyers not con
nected with the case with turpitude was
ordered stricken from the record on the
ground that it was irrelevant.
NATIONAL CLUB
GETS A PERMIT
Wordy War at the Meet
ing of the Super
visors.
Mr. Britt Says That He Is in
Favor of Boxing
Contests.
Bateman Brothers Ask for Another
Extension on Their
Contract.
A petition for a b \-ing permit pre
sented to the Supervisors yesterday by
the National Club precipitated a wordy
war and showed the position of a num
ber of Supervisors on the subject.
When the matter was presented Super
visor Stiuehan supported the petition
stating that in this matter the com
munication of the Grand Jury should
cut no figure. He urged that the Na
tional Club had already expended be
tween $500 and $600 in arranging for
the exhibition and should be allowed
to carry out its programme
Supervisor Clinton stated that in
view of the circumstances he would
not oppose the issuance of the per
mit, but he called upon Chairman De
lany of the Health and Police Commit
tee to state what the future policy of
the committee would be in regard to
such privileges. Supervisor Delany ig
nored the question, stating that the
committee would be guided by circum
stances.
Supervisor Clinton then called upon
the Mayor to state whether or not he
had the signing of permits, but the
Mayor was uncertain just what his
power was in the premises. It devel
oped later that the Mayor cuts no fig
ure in matters of this character.
Supervisor Britt said that he was not
adverse to granting boxing privileges
and that if the request came from re
putable clubs he would vote to grant
the privileges, the Grand Jury notwith
standing.
Supervisor Britt declared that boxing
was no worse than football as far as
brutality was concerned, and should be
permitted, if conducted within legiti
mate lines.
When a vote was taken Supervisor
Smith was the only one that voted
against the permit, Supervisor Clinton
explaining, however, that he would op
pose the issuance of any more such
privileges in the future.
Permission was granted the Chil
dren's Hospital to erect a tent in Union
Square for the purpose of giving a
floral fete during April. The order im
posing a quarterly license of $3000 on
stamp-trading concerns was finally
passed.
It Avas decided not to fit up quar
ters for the insane in the rooms now
occupied by the carpenter shop of the
Police Department, because of the op
position of Chief Lees. One-half the
quarters in the Receiving Hospital
now used for the detention of inebri
ates will probably be used.
The demands of Joseph Lalb for fur
nishing street-corner signs that were
refused payment by Auditor Broderick
were referred to the Street Committee
for the purpose of giving Laib a chance
to explain his position.
On motion of Supervisor Smith a
vote of thanks was tendered to Ed
ward B. Coleman for his efforts in sav
ing $1500 for the city out of the ex
penses of the Golden Jubilee.
- The Southern Pacific Company peti
tioned the board to permit the corpora
tion to erect a hospital for the care of
its injured employes at Fourteenth and
Mission streets. The petition stated
that the structure would cost when
equipped from $.'O,OOO to $60,000. The
matter was referred to the proper com
mittee.
The ordinance requiring the street
railways to select fenders and begin
the work of building them and to fin
ish within 120 days was finally passed.
Bateman Bros., contractors for the
Hall of Justice, sent in a petition for
another extension of time on their con
tract. The firm urged that though
the building was progressing favora
bly it was not sufficiently advanced,
through difficulty in obtaining mater
ial, to enable them to turn it over to
the city within the time named in the

ter was referred to the Public Build
ings Committee.

SENATOR WHITE IS
OUT OF THE RACE
WILL NOT
STAND FOR
RE-ELECTION
A Final and Decisive
Statement of His
Position.
Intends to Devote Himself
Henceforth to the
Law.
Leaves t,he Senate With Regret,
but Will Profit by
Retiring.
HIS LAST FIGHT WON.
ThÂ« Hawaiian Annexation Treaty, He
Says, Is Doomed to Certain
Defeat.
BpeclaJ Pisr-itch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Feb. 21.âSen
ator Stephen M. White is not
a candidate for re-election. The
derisive announcement of his
flnal withdrawal from politics
was made to-night, in an inter
view with The Call correspond
ent. No event of the future, he
says, will alter this intention.
While he has received many as
surances of Democratic Bupport
should he stand for re-election
the interests of himself and of
his family demand that he
thrust aside the possibilities of
future honors and devote him
self to his more profitable law
practice.
In about ten days Senator White will
leave for the north on his way back
to Washington. He will stop in San
Francisco for several days, and will
there meet the Democratic leaders, all
of whom are insistent that the Sena
tor shall stand as a candidate for re
election.
Senator White says that the Ha
waiian treaty is dead. It will never
be favorably acted upon by the United
States Senate. Annexation, in his
judgment, will never be brought about
through the adoption of a joint reso
lution. It could not receive sufficient
support in the House and Senate to in
sure its passage.
The Senator is still firm in his be
lief that there will be no war with
Spain. He does not think any causus
belli has existed or will exist.
When Senator White stepped off the
westbound overland there was quite a
delegation on hand to greet him, most
ly clients, who were desirous of having
a word with him and who did not wish
to take chances on being able to see
him after he had once reached his of
fice, where there was a volume of bus
iness demanding his attention. The
Senator was ;it once driven to his of
fice and later he received the corre
spondent of The Call.
For weeks past the people of the
State have iivn awaiting an answer
from the Senator as to whether or not
he would be a candidate for re-election
to his present position before the Leg
islating of 1899. To a Call correspond
ent the Senator, before his departure
for Washington, made the announce
ment that he did not think he would
be a candidate unless something inter
l between then and February 15
to cause him to change his opinion.
I pon this subject he said this evening:
"I see no reason for altering the de
termination I expressed to The Call be
fore I left Washington, which was to
the effect that 1 would not be a can
didate for re-election. I meant what I
Bald then, and 1 mean it now I then
said that of all the labor I have ever
been called upon to perform, my duties
as Senator oÂ£ the United States are
most pleasant and congenial to me, if
my personal desires were to be consult
ed and if nothing else was to be con
sidered. It will be a sacrifice for me to
leave the Senate, and it will be a sac
rifice for me to return. If my constitu
ents, the people of the State of Cali
fornia, were to desire me to return and
I were to consent, I would be able to
render them much more effective serv
ice on my second term than I did on
my tirst; and, as the work is a pleas
ure to me, it is a sacatice to give it
up.
"On the other hand, if I remain in
the Senate for another term I will leave
it with comparatively nothing. My
law practice will be scattered and my
clientele gone. 1 will have passed the
prime of my life, and my ability to act
for my clients will not be as great as
it is to-day. I have my family to pro
vide, for, and my first duty is to them.
What shall I do? I can see but one
pathway open to me, and that is to
retire from the Senate and resume my
practice. Then another thing: My
family prefers to reside in Los Angeles.
It does not desire me to return to
Washington after the expiration of my
present term.
"From all sides, and more particu
larly from the leaders of the Democrat
ic party in California, have I received
assurances of support if I decided to
make a campaign for re-election. In
fact, they have urged me to stand once
more. Governor James H. Ikuld has
personally assured me that he would do
everything' in his power to secure my
re-election if I would consent. To these
kind friends I feel very grateful, and
it is a desire to comply with their
wishes that causes me to halt in my
wish to temporarily at least retire from
public life.
"Before I go back to Washington I
fWn going to visit San Francisco and
have a conference with my friends. I
will have, however, no further an-
nouncements to make of my candidacy
than I have given to you."
Senator White's failure to stand as
a candidate will come out as a ivet
blanket to Democratic hopo*s and aspi
rations in Southern California. If the
Senator were a candidate the Demo
npÂ«.ts would enter the campaign this
UNITED STATES SENATOR STEPHEN M. WHITE.
year with a great deal of vigor, and the
appeal to the people to elect Demo
crats to the Legislature to re-elect
White would have unusual force. But
if White is not a candidate Southern
California will have no Democratic
aspirant for the honor who will cut any
figure in the contest and there will,
therefore, be lacking the inspiration a
local candidate always arouses with
which to rally the somewhat scattered
forces of the Democracy. White can
bring them together, but no other
Democrat can.
Speaking of the Hawaiian treaty-
Senator White said:
"The Hawaiian treaty is doomed. It
will never receive the two-thirds ma
jority necessary in the Senate to ef
fect its passage. I speak by the card,
for we have polled the vote and know
exactly where we stand. I was agreed
upon as the leader of the forces op
posed to annexation. Before I left we
had a little consultation and Senator
Faulkner was agreed upon as the proper
man to act in my place in my absence.
He is a very able and tactful man,
possessed of all the necessary knowl
edge of the subject to handle it and to
meet all arguments of those favoring
the treaty. He is at the same time able
as a parliamentarian to meet our
friends, the enemy.
"The treaty was, of course, discussed
in executive session, and what trans
pired in the way of discussion of the
subject never reached the people. This
was a matter of great regret to us who
were of the opposition. We made an
earnest endeavor to have the doors
opened during its discussion, but we
did not succeed. There existed really
no reason why they should not be
opened, and there were many reasons
why they should. The people of the
country, taken as a whole', really know
nothing about this matter. I have
found that wherever it is discussed
and they become fully posted as to the
facts they are opposed to it. I should
have liked very much to have had the
arguments against and for annexation
made during the executive sessions of
the Senate gone before the people of
the United States. During the dis
cussion with closed doors nothing of a
sensational nature transpired, and if
there had been it would have leaked
out almost as soon as it was uttered or
developed in the executive session.
Executive sessions of the Senate are
now executive only in name.
"It the treaty should come up for ap
proval during my absence it would
make no difference, as I have two votes
in favor of the treaty paired with me.
â¢"As soon as the treaty is defeated, I
am inclined to think an endeavor will
be made to annex Hawaii by joint reso
lution. Should a measure be intro
duced I feel confident that it would be
defeated. It would be open to discus
sion, and it would give us an oppor
tunity which we have not had yet to
educate the country on the subject.
There would be an open debate, and the
whole matter would be presented with
the invincible arguments we have
against the proposition, to annex these
islands. The result of this debate, I am
certain, would be the defeat of the joint
resolution.
"With regard to the disastrous catas
trophe to the Maine In Havana harbor
the other day, I see no reason to change
the views I expressed at Chicago. There
is no cause as yet for any war with
Spain, and I do not think there will be
any. The affair looks to me at this
distance as though it was purely an
accident, and I do not see how it can be
regarded in any other light until we are
in possession of evidence to the con
trary. That can be given us only by
the naval board of inquiry. There is no
reason for any war scare, and there
will be no conflict at arms between the
United States and Spain."
The Senator gave an exhibition of
true Senatorial courtesy in what lie
said of Marcus A. Hanna of OhÂ»o. He
was questioned as to the possibility of
Mr. Hanna losing his seat in the Sen
ate, and he said: "I feel very delicate
about speaking for publication in re
gard to a matter of this kind. Up to
this time there is nothing before the
United States Senate upon which to
base any question as to the legality of
Mr. Hanna's eiection by the Ohio Legis
lature. If there were it would not be
good form for me to express any opin
ion as to the case or what I thought
about it. I would be called upon to sit
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1898.
as a juror to try the case, and certainly
opinions In advance of the evidence I
would be called upon to listen to would
render me ineligible."
The Senator takes a most hopeful
view of the outlook for his party's suc
cess in the elections of 1898 through
out the country, and more particularly
In California. In discussing this fea
ture he said:
".My honest judgment, formed as a
result of association with leaders from
all parts of the country and hearing
reports from every section of the coun
try, is that the sentiment in favor of
bimetallism and the restoration of sil
ver to its old position as a money has
not taken any backward steps since the
Chicago convention of IM>6. On the
other hand, my opinion is that our par
ty is more solidly united than ever be
fore; the principles which were em
bc/died in our national platform of
eighteen months since are stronger in
the minds of the people to-day than
they ever were. In my position as
chairman of the Democratic Congres
sional Committee I have opportunities
of obtaining a great deal of information
on this subject, and I, therefore, speak
with more or less authority.
"The views of Senator James K.
Jones, chairman of the National Com
mittee, so far as they advocate the
union of all the silver forces in the
coming Congressional and State cam
paigns, are generally indorsed by the
Democratic party everywhere. The
gold people will not derive any satisfac
tion from the proceedings of the pres
ent Congress, for, although there is a
solid Republican majority in the House
of Representatives, that body cannot
agree upc/n any affirmative financial
legislation.
"Here in California, I think, the pros
pects for the success of the Democratic
party and its allies could not possibly
be brighter. We are going to carry
this State and by an overwhelming
majority.
"I shall return to Washington in
about ten days, and shall not be in Cal
ifornia again until after the adjourn
ment of Congress. In about eight days
I shall leave for the north, and after
a day or two with my friends there I
shall go on to Washington by the
northern route without again return
ing to Southern California."
The Senator is literally buried be
neath an avalanche of business, and
his friends call upon him in legions.
THOUSANDS AT
THE CITRUS FAIR
CLOVERDALE, Feb. 21.â The Citrus
Fair is still a great drawing card, every
| incoming train bringing visitors by the
score from all points within a radius of
100 miles. There is nothing so fascinat
ing to look upon as an orange tree laden
with its golden fruit, and when the rich
ly colored products of the orange and
| lemon trees are heaped together in great
i pyramids, constructed into buildings,
! fountains and designs of every conceiv
| able shape that art can devise, sur
rounded by elaborate and artistic decora
tions, tropical and wild ower's and other
fruits, they prove an irresistible attrac
tion. In addition there is a local pride
in this semi-tropical belt which has
caused local fairs to become popular.
Providence seems to smile upon Clover
dale. Yesterday being the Sabbath the
I fair was closed, so when the flood gates
of heaven opened early in the morning
to pour forth needed rain it acted as no
detriment to the fair. This morning the
I clouds had rolled ;Â»way, delightful warm
j spring day followed and to-night the
pavilion was thronged.
This afternoon the Healdsburg Glee
Club of twenty male voices supplied en
tertainment at the pavilion. Flags floated
at half-mast to-day oil over the city in
token of the mourning over the dead
j marines of the Maine. The programme
of the Cloverdale band to-night included
many patriotic airs, which were received
with the wildest applause by the large au
dience, which showed intense anti-Span
ish feeling. "The Star Spangled Banner"
was encored often.

HOME RULE
FOR IRELAND
Local Government Bill
Passes Its First
Reading.
â 
Meets No Opposition in the
British House of
Commons.
Hailed as a Great Improvement
Over the Measure of
1892.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 21.â The House of
Commons was crowded to-day when
the Chief Secretary of Ireland, Gerald
Balfour, introduced the Irish local gov
ernment bill. In so doing Mr. Balfour
said he thought it possible the new or
der of things would at first seem a fail
ure, but he believed It would work
through failure to success, which would
be the beginning of better and brighter
days for Ireland.
The Government, Mr. Balfour contin
ued, proposed that the local adminis
tration be distributed between county
councils, urban and rural district coun
cils and boards of election, the election
of which would be by parliamentary
franchise, with the addition of peers
and women. The qualifications and
disqualifications for election of the
councilors would be the same as in
England, except that ministers of religion
would be disqualified from sitting in
the county or district council, the Gov
ernment acting therein in accordance
with precedents.
For the sake of convenience, Mr. Bal
four further explained, the boundaries
of the existing: unions and also of the
ecrunties would be modified and the
county councils would take over the du
ties of grand Juries, but only in fiscal
matters, and would not include crimi
nal jurisdiction or questions of compen
sation for malicious injuries. (Irish
ohs.) The elections for county and
district councils would be triennial, and
all would retire together. The coun
ty councils would be the sole rate-col r
lecting authority, and would control the
expenditures. They would alsa be re
sponsible for dealings with exceptional
distress, and would decide when the re
quests of boards of guardians for out
door relief should be granted. Dublin,
Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Londonderry
and Waterford would be constituted in
dependent county councils. The coun
ty would be responsible for half the ex
tra expenditures.
Mr. Balfour also pointed out that the
bill provided that the occupier was lia
ble to both the county, cess and poor
rate, whether in a town or rural dis
trict, which would involve a readjust
ment of rents, an equal sum to be
granted from the Imperial exchequer
as an agricultural grant. Mr. Balfour
said he thought the bill was based upon
broad, democratic lines.
John Morley, Chief Secretary for Ire
land in the late Liberal administration,
welcomed the bill as being "a genuine
democratic effort."
Timothy Healy, Irish Nationalist,
praised the bill, and Michael Davitt,
Irish Nationalist, threatened opposition
to that part c-f the bill promising relief
to the landlords in the shape of an ag
ricultural grant.
The bill eventually passed its first
reading.

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21.â The Call's
expose of official corruption in the
town of Washington, Yolo County,
will bring about a complete reforma
tion there and for the first time in
many years the gamblers will be
ABE MORRIS OF WOODLAND.
driven out of the place. District At- j
torney Hopkins, in speaking of The
Call's publication this morning of the
deplorable state of aaffirs in Washing
ton, said:
"For my own protection and in de
fense of my own honor, I shall do
everything in my jpower to procure the
passage of a new ordinance which will
enable the Sheriff to close every game
now running in the town of Washing
ton. At this time, under the present
ordinance, nothing can be done. The
Sheriff of this county has been un
justly criticized for not closing these
gambling houses in Washington; as a
matter of fact there is nothing to pro
hibit the selling of pools from the steps
of the South Methodist Church. I feel
quite certain, however, that at the next
meeting of the board an ordinance will
be passed which will enable the law
officers of Yolo County to close the
games in Washington."
When asked if he had read the state
ment in The Call concerning the prac
tices of bribery, Mr. Hopkins said:
"Yes, I have read them, and while I
am not surprised at the publication, I
must say that the Sheriff of Yolo
County and his deputy, Mr. Brown,
have been unjustly censured. I know
very well that there have been many
rumors afloat involving us all over
there. In speaking for myself I ran
say that I worried at first over these
reports, but of late I have paid little
attention to them. If Mr. Morris ever
received any money for me I can only
say that he did so without my au
thority or consent. I do not believe
that he ever did. Mr. Morris is my
friend politically and that is probably
the reason why our names have been
associated together."
"Did Mr. Morris ever act for you on
any matter pertaining to the pool
room and gambling house in Washlng
! ton?"
"Not with my consent."
"Did you ever talk to Mr. Morris
about such matters?"
"We never exchanged a word."
"When was your attention first called
to the situation of affairs in Washing
ton?"
"A long time ago. I tried to convict
some faro players over there, but they
demanded a jury and were acquitted.
By the way, one of Mr. Castleman's
brothers "was on this same jury- and,
if I remember rightly, he had a cousin
or two. This man Castleman subse
quently swore to a warrant, and I told
him I could not make the ordinance
stick, but for him not to dismiss the
case and I would secure the passage
of a new one. He went, notwithstand
ing my suggestion, and had the case
dismissed."
"Why was this amended ordinance
not passed?"
"It was my own fault. I had some
other matters to attend to and neg
lected it. I will see to it, however,
when the board meets next month; and,
as I said before, I am quite certain
that a new ordinance will be passed
which will be legal and one which can
not be avoided on constitutional
grounds."
Abe Morris, who was present while
Most Complexion Powders
have a vulgar glare, but Pozzoni's ia a true,
beaut i fier , whose effects are lasting. j
Mr. Hopkins was speaking, said:
"If I were in your place I would do
it. Of course when the games stop it
takes money out of my pocket, but I
can get along without it if I am com
pelled to."
"How do the games put money In
your pocket?" he was asked.
"Well, it is like this," Mr. Morris re
plied. "Rider and Daroux give me 10
per cent of every dollar I send to play
on the races. It makes no difference
whether thj persons sending it win
or lose. I get my 10 per cent just the
same, and of course I would like to
see the games go on."
"Then you did have some interest in
the protection of the gamblers?"
"Yes, I have always been a gambling
man myself and have always looked
out for their interests when I could, i
am making about $100 every month and
I would naturally feel like doing what
I could for them. What money I make
is legitimate."
Deputy Sheriff Brown was then seen
and made the following statement:
"In the first place, I believe this is a
trick to injure me in my political am
bitions, and I believe some one is be
ing well paid for it. I was seen with
Morris in Washington and afterwards
in Sacramento, but I never made a de
mand on any one for a cent and every
word of Castleman's story so far as I
am concerned is a lie. The time
when Castleman says he saw me with
Morris was when we happened to be
together in Washington and not a word
was said by us in the way of demand
ing money."
"Did you ever demand money from
George Vice?"
"I did not."
"Did you ever demand money from
George Green?"
"I did not."
"Was there any arrangement or un
derstanding ever entered into between
you and Abe Morris?"
"No."
Sheriff Griffin was equally emphatic
in his denial of every charge involving
him.
"Some days ago," said he, "a young '
man came to me in Woodland and said
be wanted to open s poolroom in Wash- j
ington, and that he wanted to know I
how much it was going to cost him for |
protection. I told him the present or
dinance could not be enforced and he r
required no protection. That is all the
talk I have ever had with any one."
The Sheriff denied that he had been
paid $40 on one occasion in the pool
room at Washington, and further stat
ed that he did not know half of the
people mentioned.
The two Supervisors being out of the
city, Mr. Snyder was telephoned to
from Woodland, the first question be
ing:
"Have you read Castleman's state
ment in to-day's Call?"
"I have," he replied.
"Do you wish to say anything in con
nection with it?"
"I will say nothing, unless it is in
the presence of my attorneys."
That being the case, The Call cor
respondent came to Sacramento, and
later saw Mr. Snyder in the office of
his attorneys, Bruner & Brothers.
Speaking through them, Mr. Snyder
simply said:
"I deny everything that has been
said."
When asked if there was anything
more he wished to say, his attorneys
instructed him to say no more. Mr.
Snyder did say, however, that Mr. Cas
tleman was not responsible for what
he was reported as having said.
"He is wrong in the upper story and
his friends have known it for a long
time," he declared.
The expose in The Call was the chief
topic of discussion all day in Wood
land, Washington and Sacramento. The
Bee to-night published a greater por
tion of the article, but made no com
ment. Whatever may be the extent
of the uneasiness caused by to-day's
publication, there is one thing certain
and that is, the games will soon be
stopped in Tolo County.

Popular Interest Increasing in the Proposed Semi-Centennial Exposition to Mark the Fiftieth Milestone
in the History of California as a State.
3-ovemor ILorcL of Oregon Approves of tlie Movement â Committees StLOialol
Be Appointed, to Commence "Work.
Public interest is daily Increasing 1 in
the proposed semi-centennial exposition
to be held here In 1900 to commemorate
the fiftieth anniversary of theadmission
of California into the Union. The pro
position meets with general approval,
for no one can dispute the fact that an
exhibition of our products and resources
â vv-iuld prove of great value, not only to
California, but to all the coast States.
We have already received assurances
of aid from neighboring States; the
latest one to add words of encourage
ment being Governor Lord of Oregon.
A letter received from his private sec
retary yesterday assures California of
his best wishes for success.
There is no time to lose in getting
down to the preliminary work, for a
year and a half is not any too long to
make the exposition a success. It will
first be necessary to have a committee
appointed to map out plans for carry-
Ing out the project. Mayor Phelan
pays that he will appoint such a com
mittee when he is certain that the men
he will appoint will enter into
the movement with spirit and
not falter until the exposition is
made a success. The committee can be
enlarged from time to time as the work
progresses, so as to not throw too
much responsibility on the shoulders of
a few.
Governor Budd will also be asked to
appoint a committee of prominent busi
ness men from the several counties of
the State, so that there will be a work
ing body in each county. An appeal to
the next State Legislature for an ap
propriation would undoubtedly meet
with a prompt and hearty response.
There is no reason why the semi-cen
tennial exposition should not be made
a success and one worthy of the occa
sion it will commemorate.
UNDERTAKING
VERY GREAT.
Will Require a Man of Brains
and Unquestioned Ability
at Its Head.
WENDELL EASTONâ The idea of
marking the semi-centennial of the ad
mission of California into the Union
in some distinctive manner, is good.
The proposed exposition, however, is
an undertaking: of such magnitude that
it would be well to give the subject

Maudlin Melodrama That
Is Quite Unfor-
givable.
Miss Marie Wainwright, Too,
Is Very Much to Be
Regretted.
A Real Comic Opera Â«t the Tivoli.
Timely Sensation at Moroseo's.
Vaudeville.
Miss Marie Wainwright appeared at
the Columbia last night as the wronged
heroine of a play by the inquisitive title
of "Shall We Forgive Her?" The piece
is a maudlin English melodrama,
anonymous and rankly unforgivable.
In the lobby its authorship was
vaguely attributed to Frank Harvey,
%vho, if guilty, is to be congratulated
that his name does not figure in the
play bill.
I thought that after the weeks and
weeks and weeks we have had of noth
ing but farce, vaudeville and Jingle,
anything in the nature of a serious
nlay would be as a tonicâ but this one
careful attention before fixing upon
some specific plan. The pulse of the
community would, of course, indicate
whether or not the support of the bus
iness interest of San Francisco could
be relief upon not only to assist" in
promoting the exposition, but to see
that it is made a success.
From my experience with the Mid
winter Fair I know that a great
amount of real, hard work will be ne
cessary. It will require a great deal
of time on the part of men of ability
and persistence to secure the money
with which to open the exposition.
The head of the exposition must be
a man of pronounced firmness and
great executive ability. In such a
position it requires both brains and
stamina. Such a man must be found.
Personally I would be more than
pleased to see these proposed plans car
ried out, and I will not be backward
in assisting to the best of my ability,
but not as a member of the committee
having the affair in charge. I believe
that it would be well to have a new
element represented in the manage
ment.
I hope the holding of an exposition
will be the means of uniting all inter
ests, those of the newspapers as well
as of business men. If this can be
accomplished we can have a celebra
tion worthy of the occasion. â  It would
indeed be the dawning of an era of
prosperity.
ALL ARE PROUD
OF CALIFORNIA
The Golden Wedding to the
Union Should Be Properly
Commemorated.
COUNTY CLERK CURRYâ By all
means let us have an exposition on the
lines suggested by The Call. We have
every reason to be proud of our State,
and our golden wedding to the United
States should be properly and fittingly
celebrated. We should start the work
of organization without further delay.
The Native Sons have been working for
months to get up a grand festival for
1900, and they would assist in carry
ing out the exposition project. We have
no time to lose. It should be a matter
of btate pride â yes, of coast pride, to
get up an exposition that will properly
draw attention to our wonderful re
sources. What benefits California bene
fits the entire Pacific Slope. We have
the assurances of the Governors of ad
joining States that they will aid us in
carrying the movement to a successful
issue. We should start the work at
once, for it will take months of time

Is four acts too many for me. Of all
the pleas that dramatists have made
for the lady with the stained past,
"Shall We Forgive Her?" is the worst
that I can. put on record. It has not
even the merit of unconscious humor.
It is an endless orgie of tears and
moans aggravated by spasms of
funereal "comic relief."
Grace, the heroine, is left an orphan
and goes to her sweetheart in the wilds
of Queensland. He neglects the formal
ity of marriage, and when she thwarts
his attempts to rob a young engine-r
to whom she had given shelter, he pub
licly insults her in the presence of his
companions, whereupon she flies back
to London. There she marries a vir
tuous and uninteresting person who
knows nothing of her past. But the
villain still pursues her, exacts hush
money, and the transaction is over
heard by hubby's housekeeper, who
gives the whole thing away. As a
climax the husband goes indignantly
blind. And this results in another act
in which the tearful heroine resorts lo
literature as a means of secretly sus
taining blind popper and their child.
And then â forgiveness and melancholy
felicity.
The acting calls for no comment.
With the exception of Henry Napier,
who contrives to secure several mo
ments of humanness in the part of the
young engineer, the company deserves
the piece. Miss Wainwright has seen
better days, but there was nothing to
suggest the fact in her monotonous
work of last night. She rubbed In the

HARBOR COMMISSIONER HAR
NEY-I am heartily in favor of an ex
position in 1900, and will cheerfully aid
in making it a success. We have been
too slow in advertising California to the
world. The Midwinter Fair proved a
grand success, and an exposition such
as has been advocated by The Call will
prove a far greater success. Many
thousand people were attracted here by
the Midwinter Fair, and many of them
remained with us. Our climate and re

that Is up to the standard of the house.
It is a little odd, these days, to see Stev
ens in a comedy role that Is not gro
tesque, for In the "Vice Admiral" he
suggests his younger days In the more
legitimate comic operas. As Don Mira
bolante he has not his usual monopoly,
but quite enough for an admirable evi
dence of versatility. Raffael and Tillie
Salinger were especially acceptable to the
audience. Leary, as the Donna Quesada,
rather forces the comedy.
That "The Geisha" will be given a
sumptuous revival next week will be good
news for many.
Orpheum.
Five new acts entertain Orpheum goers
this week. Lima Pantzer, the high wire
artist, does some remarkable feats which
are new. The Carl Damman acrobatic
troupe, and M. C. Lawrence with his
bicycle tricks, present novelties In their
lines which are good, and George W. Day
does a monologue skit that is out of the
ordinary. The sketch of Matthews and
Harris is very laughable.
Morosco's.
The sensation of the hour was turned
to profitable account last night by Man
ager Morosco, who presented for the first
sources so favorably impressed them
they decided to make California their
wme. The Trans-Mississippi Congress

i success, and we should emulate the
good example set by Nebraska. Of
course, it will take time and labor to
set up the exposition, but no public

when the time comes for all to put a
shoulder to the wheel.

PRIMARY LAW
ON APPEAL
Question Carried From
Tulare County to the
Supreme Court.
T. V. Cator Attacks Its Consti
tutionality, but Is
Defeated.
F. S. Stratton, Who Framed the Law,
Appears in Its Defense and
Argues Forcibly.
The case of Charles A. Spier vs. Rob
ert Baker et al. was submitted In the
Supreme Court yesterday, and Its de
cision will settle the fate of the new
primary law passed in the Legislature
last year.
T. V. Cator appeared for the appel
lant and F. S. Stratton, father of the
law, appeared as amicus curiae.
The act, Mr. Cator said, aside from
being in conflict with several provi
sions of the constitution, was an ex
tensive burden upon the people, and
was also a law well devised to assist
political trickery, to disfranchise vot
ers and promote political despotism;
The provision that in 1898 and every
four years thereafter there shall be a
general primary election for the selec
tion of delegates to the State and dis
trict conventions to nominate candi
dates to be voted for at the next gen
eral election was taken up, and Mr.
Cator said that as such a convention
could only be held once in four years,
and in the intermediate Presidential
years, the State conventions could only
nominate Congressmen and district
nominees. There was no method of
nominating a Justice of the Supreme
Court or any State officer In Presiden
tial years.
The question of compelling election
officers to serve without remuneration, '
he claimed, was depriving a man of his
property without due process of law,
as a man's time was equal to his prop
erty. This error he dwelt on at con
sklerable length. He wound up by de
claring that it was not in the power of
the State to donate public moneys to
provide ways to help persons to nomi
nation to office.
Attorney Stratton, for the constitu
tionality of the act, met every argu
ment advanced by Mr. Cator, and after
dealing with the general scope of the
law as provided in the act, he took up
Mr. Cator's constitutional points seri
atim and argued them at length. As to
the point which has caused more public
criticism than any other, perhaps,
namely, that the labeling of the boxes
destroys the secrecy of the ballot, Mr.
Stratton declares that the act of vot
ing at a Republican or Democratic box
no more stamps a man as a Republican
or Democrat than the act of voting at
a Republican or Democratic primary on
separate days. In either oase the voter
indicates his politics, and the new law
no more violates the secrecy of the bal
lot than the old.
In a general line of argument sweep
ing In its force the objections ad
hand that would be required to make
the exposition a grand success. The
fact that the World's Fair at Paris
will also be held in 1900 should not in
any way deter us from carrying out the
project. Every one is in favor of the
movement, and no time should be lost
in getting ready for the event. A com
mittee should be appointed within the
next few days to take the matter in
hand and arrange the preliminary de
tails. By concerted action we should
be able to present an exposition that
would make the semi-centennial anni
versary of California's admission into
the Union a grand historical event.
SUGGESTIONS
OF INTEREST.
A Hotel Man's Ideasâ Fraternal
and Other Societies Should
Participate.
EDWARD HOLLAND, proprietor of
the Commercial Hotelâ The prelimin
ary course of The Call has been of in
estimable value in promoting the hold
ing of an exposition in 1900 commemo
rative of the semi-centennial of the ad
mission of California into the Union. I
fully agree that the proposed plan of
making the exposition a grand affair
is the best way of marking the fiftieth
milestone in the history of the State.
I would suggest that the Governor
of the State be called upon to issue
invitations to the Mayors of the dif
ferent cities in California and also the
chairman of the Board of Supervisors
of each county, they to meet in San
Francisco for the purpose of formu
lating plans of organization.
The scope of the exposition should
take in the whole coast, but conducted
under the patronage of the State of
California and should be planned broad
enough to be both non-political and
non-sectarian.
I suggest further that all fraternal
and other societies be communicated
with, with a view of having them con
sider the abvisability of fixing the date
of holding their annual sessions to
come within a period during which the
exposition will be held. This would
not only aid materially in attracting,
many people to the exposition, but
would also give the different societies
an opportunity to have special days
at the fair in which to make demon
strations representative of the society.
To illustrate: The Masonic frater
nity could have a day, the Odd Fellows
another day, the Knights of Pythias
vanced by Cator were brushed aside
as being trifling in their character as
against the good that would follow the
law as contemplated by the Legislature
when passing the bill.
At 4 o'clock the case was submitted.
SAD CASE OF INSANITY.
Mrs. Allie Ogilvie Sent to the Asy-
lum at Napa the Second Time
Mrs. Allle Ogilvie, niece of the late Dr.
Luke Robinson, who resided at the Fair
mount Hotel, was committed to the asy
lum for the Insane at Napa yesterday.
The case of Mrs. Ogilvie is in many re
spects a sad one. She imagines that she
is the victim of a conspiracy to get her
out of the way, and in the strange con
dition of her mind her suffering Is as
intense as though enemies were in fact
plotting against her liberty and her life.
When told that she had been committed
the patient wept bitterly and protested
against the action of the Insanity Com
missioners. Mrs. Ogilvie has been in the
asylum before, and it is now thought
that her delusion will result in a com
plete breaking down of her mind, and
will forbid her release during this life.

idea to have each county compile such

represented therein, the book to con
tain no individual or corporate adver
tising.
The idea of the book Is to furnish
reliable data regarding the resources
and industries of the State and to put
the same in such form that the attrac
tions of each county could easily be
referred to. It should be a well-bound
volume which would be preserved for
years to come and be placed in every
public library in the world.

AN EXPOSITION FOR 1900.
Merced Evening Sun.
The San Francisco Call has taken up
the matter of holding a semi-centen
nial exposition in San Francisco in
1900, to commemorate the admission of
California into the Union. It is to be
on the style of the Midwinter Fair,
but more extensive. 'ihis proposition
should and no doubt will receive sup
port from every section of the State.
Several little one-horse celebrations
have been held in San Francisco during
the past few years, all designed to draw
suckers in from the country to boom,
business in the city for a few days.
But the proposition of holding a
fair or exposition in 1900 on such a
large scale as would attract people
from all over the United States will be
looked upon with favor by the country
people of California. While the Mid
winter Fair was a great thing for San
Francisco, it was also a great thing for
the whole State, and brought many
thousands of Easterners to the Pacific
Coast. Something of the same sort in
1900 would be the means of brining
many people and much capital to the
State permanently, and every section
of the State would be benefited.
temperance. The action of Samuel A.
Wells against Alma M. Wells is now on
trial before Judge Seawell. and a decision
is expected to-day. Mrs. Wells appeared
in court yesterday with her children, five
in number, and made many charges of
cruelty against her husband as a de
fense to his allegations.
PINCHED HER ARMS.
T. R. Simpson was arrested yesterday
on a warrant charging him with battery.
The complaining witness is his wife,
Theresa, who alleges that on Sunday af
ternoon her husband met her on Geary
street and insulted her by pinching her
arms and almost tearing her cape from
her shoulders. She had been married two
years, but owing to her husband's con
duct she left him about two months ago
and has since been living with her mother
at 523 Pine street.
Simpson is a son of the late Dr. James
Simpson, and through his father's death
fell heir to considerable property. He de
nies the assault upon his wife, and says
it is a case of spitework. He was released,
on his own recognizance by Judge Conlan.

end The ("all and other newspapers
"that are aiding in the fight for good
government. Nolting has made It his
Jproud boast that he is a member of the
gang, and is prouder still of the fact
that he has never refused to follow
the gang programme, no matter how
.-Utterly against public good it might
be or how bitter it might be to him
eelf. No political boss ever found a
more pliant and subservient tool than
t! 11 ' 0 name Nolting.
1 The pretext he used for defaming
lome of the best and most reputable
citizens of San Jose and the organiza
tion to which they belong was the
proposed investigation of Police Officer
John H. Scully. Instead of standing
the fire of an investigation Scully sent
iv his resignation. On the motion of
Councilman Julius Krieg, one of the
Councilmen accused of having re
ceived part of the bribe money paid
for Scully's position, the resignation
was laid over for consideration until
later. Krieg then moved that the in
vestigation be taken up, and this mo
tion was carried.
It was at this Juncture that Nolting
took the opportunity to do the dirtiest
imaginable kind of politics for the
gang. He took cowardly advantage of
his official position to calumniate and
defame absent men. He brought his
alleged honor and his "mother's proud
head bowed down in shame" Into the
situation in a way that made every lis
tener have only added pity for the
mother and only deep contempt for the
son. And all this was done at the be
hest of the gang.
Nolting's record is notoriously crook
ed, as incontrovertible* shown by the
records. More than one big sum of
money has been illegally taken out of
the city treasury, and the tax-payers
of San Jose been thus robbed by the
aid of his vote. The individuals he
singled out for attack "were H. E. Schil
ling, the president of the New Charter
Club; J. P. Jarman and A. K. Whitton,
two of the gentlemen named as possible
candidates for Mayor on the New Char
ter Club ticket; W. B. Hardy and (_}. W.
Peckham. Mayor Koch also came in
for a jolt from Nolting's tongue.
No one expected that the gang would
; resort to any other than a campaign
of mud-slinging and villiflcation, but
few thought to see it show its hand bo
early ir. the fight. It is argued from the
sang'F early entry into the arena that it
already feels its weakness in the coming
election, and is therefore starting in
betimes to blind the real issues and
eituation.
No one but a man permeated with
the vicious virus of the gang would
Jiave the foolhardiness and indecency
to thus make an onslaught on the New
Charter Club and seek to injure it, and
thereby the cause of good government
for San Jose. People are trying to
.guess to-night who was* engaged to
write the document which Nolting
read before the Council to-night.
Not the least amusing feature of the
performance before the Council was
Nolting'3 spasmodic efforts at decla
mation. His attempted simulation of
indignation against the Mayor toward
the close was particularly embarrass
ing to the audience. His words were as
follows:
Your Honor and Gentlemen of the Coun
cil: This is the time set for the Investi
gation of the charges against Police
Officer Scully, who stands accused of
having obtained his position on the po
lice force through the bribery of at least
two members of the Council by which he
â¢was elected. In view of the fact that
this charge has been made the subject
of wide public interest and of large sen
sational comment in the pages of the
fjress, and in view of the fact also that
t has been made the occasion for an in
discriminate assault not only upon the
fair name of our city, but also upon the
individual characters of members of this
Council. I deem it the proper time and
place to make certain remarks upon a
question of privilege, during the course
of which I hope to clear the atmosphere
of all uncertainty with reference to who
are responsible for any malfeasance in
office and for any disgrace which may
have fallen upon this city by reason of
past or present mismanagement of her
public affairs.
I claim the right to indulge in these re
marks at this time for the reason that I
have been included in the general attack
upon the members of the City Council of
San Jose, and I have come to a time
when I do not propose to longer sit silent
In the hearing and presence of dastardly
assaults upon my personal character, nor
do I propose to permit such attacks to
be made without giving some facts so
that the people of this community may
â¢ ciearly understand who It is that is re
sponsible for -any past misgovernment of
her affairs, and also who should be held
accountable for any present attacks upon
her reputation as a well governed city.
I have been a member of this Council
for the past four years, and I have at all
times endeavored to fulfill the trust re
posed in me with the utmost fidelity and
honor. I have lived in this community
all my life and 1 have established. I
firmly believe, a reputation for integrity
in the conduct of my business affairs. I
am endeavoring to acquire a like repu
tation in the profession which I have
chosen and for which I prepared myself
while still engaged In another occupation.
My family resides in this city and my
mother believes her son to be an honest
man, and I do not propose, at this late
hour of life, to have her proud head
bowed down in shame .it my lack of
courage in defending the right. I do not
now propose to have any character-assas
sins, whether they be disappointed poli
ticians banded together in a political club
for the purpose of again gaining control
to fleece the city, or members of the
press actuated by motives which they
dare not divulge, make any assault
upon me involving my public or private
honor without proclaiming my defense.
In the first place, Mr. Mayor and gen
CHARLES E. KNIGHT.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â Charles E. Knight of San Francisco, son of
Colonel George A. Knight, was to-day notified by Comptroller of the
Currency Dawes of his selection as National Bank Examiner for the State
of. California. Mr. Knight has been :n the employ of the Crocker-Wool
worth Company of San Francisco for a number of years, having entered
their service as a messenger, and is now one of the bookkeepers. He had
the recommendation of President Crocker and Cashier Kline, and was re-
commended for the appointment vy Senator Perkins also. Colonel Knight,
who is now in Washington, said that his son would leave San Francisco
to-night to receive his instructions from the department.
Charles E. Knight was bom in this city twenty-six years ago. He re
ceived his education in the public school's, completing it in the Boys' High
School (now the JLowell High School), ot! Sutter street. He left for New
York to-night, accompanied by his father.
tlemen of the Council, let it be remem- i
bered that at the time John H. Scully
was elected a member of the police force
of this city the City Council which elect- I
e<l him was composed of eight men, a
majority of whom was necessary to the '
election of a member of the police force. !
Why is It now, when Policeman John H. |
Scully stands accused as either the giver
of bribes or a victim of extortion, that
all the members of that majority who
selected him are not accused of crime?
The reason, gentlemen, is, that some of
the former members of the Council are
not now in office, but some of tliom at j
least are endeavoring by devious political !
methods to get back into office, and these I
and their allies in crime are willing to j
cast any stain upon the characters of I
their former associates or the fair name
of the city in order to gain their ends.
We are all aware that the election of
the city officers is about to take place,
and that the offices of Mayor and Coun
cilmen are more remunerative under the
new charter than they were under the
old. They are. therefore, more sought
after by fhe chronic office holders and
political pap-suckers of our city. In or
der to obtain them these political para
sites have banded together under the
sweet-sounding name of the Charter Club.
I do not mean to charge that every mem
ber of that club or even a large portion of
Its members are of that class, but I do
mean to say. and 1 expect to clearly
prove, that the leaders ana prominent
members and manipulators of its politics
are the same old set of soreheads, the
same old gang of office seekers, the same
old crowd of chronic feasters at the pub
lic crib, who in the past have been large
ly guilty for any mismanagement that
there may have been of civic affairs; who
have been willing to be the assassins of
character on all occasions, and who are
largely responsible for any stain which
their reputation put on our city.
Let us analyze this Charter Club and
see who and what its leaders are: Who
iÂ« its president? H. E. Schilling. Who
is H. E. Schilling? He is the man who
became Mayor of this city by an accident,
and who, by his slavish subserviency to a
certain corporation and by his watchful
mismanagement of the city's affairs, had
iiunk so low in public estimation by the
time his time expired that he is only now
beginning to emerge from the deserved
oblivion Into which lie ran. The records
of this Council show that under his ad
ministration, and by his approval, a con
tract for street sweeping was granted for
a term of three years to his political as
sociates, Thomas Bodley and others, un
der iiie fictitious name of Maguire, which
raised the enormous sum of $900 a month,
and when he had less streets to sweep than
we have now. It Is also a matter of
public record that the fire engine property
on Third street was purchased during his
administration, and that the cost of re
pairing the old house on the property was
far in excess of what, under proper man
agement, the cost of a new engine-house
would have been. H. E. Schilling was
nominated for Councilman of the Fourth
Ward by the deciding vote cast by an em
ploye of the San Jose Water Company,
and he was elevated to the office of Mayor
by manipulators of the same corporation,
lie did its bidding durinp his entire term
of office as Councilman and as Mayor.
He is doing its bidding now, when he is
acting president of the Charter Club and
is endeavoring, through that organization,
to bring about the election of a Council
which will be subservient to the will arid
interests of the San Jose Water Company.
Who is another of the purifying leaders
of this Charter Club? W. B. Hardy. Who
is W. B. Hardy? \V. B. Hardy is the man
who for nearly ten years held the office
of City Attorney of this city, and now
aspires to occupy it again. He is the man
who, while holding that office, was ac
cused of having accepted money from pri
vate citizens having business with the
city for doing a service for which he had
already been paid out of the public treas
ury. There is something else with refer
ence to W. B. Hurdy which the public
ought to know. He Is another of the
friends and is one of the chief manip
ulators of the San Jose Water Company.
His brother-in-law is the secretary of
that concern, and both in the capacity of
City Attorney and a member of the
charter club Mr. Hardy is doing the bid
ding of that corporation,, which has fat
tened upon the pockets of the citizens of
San Jose for over a (juarter of a century,
and which is using Mr. Hardy to good
advantage at the present time to prevent
an opposition company from obtaining a
foothold in the city of San Jose, whereby
its people might be relieved of the ex
orbitant water rates which they have
paid for years, and which the new com
pany agrees to furnish at one-half the
rate.
Who is another of the leaders of the
Charter Club who poses as a political pur
ist, and who is seeking an office like the
n-st? It Is J. P. Jarman, who sat for one
term in the City Council and who made it
secondary to the interests of his paint
shop on every possible occasion. He was
one of the members of the Council and
chairman of the Street Committee, who
very readily purchased the steam roller
for 'almost $4000. He is the man who, while
still a Councilman, was so hungry after
office that he ran for Supervisor, and dur
ing the campaign, while a member of the
construction committee, spent $2000 in use
less repairs upon the city hall, as it was
rumored, that he might set enough men
at work to insure his election to the of
fice of Supervisor. J. P. Jarman was
elected Councilman as an honest man,
and by the aid of my political friends,
to whom he became a traitor by the dic
tation of Wilbur Wilcox, his brother-in
law and superintendent of the San Jose
Water Company. He is another tool of
the water company, and as Councilman
never failed to do its bidding, and who
hopes to be elected Councilman again In
order that he may help it in its fight
against the opposition water company,
who are striving to get patrons at half
the present charge. While in the Coun
cil he voted with Messrs. Dittus and
Krieg on each and every occasion and
they were known all over this commu
nity as "the solid."
Who is 3till another of the office-seeking
leaders of the Charter Club? It Is A. K.
Whitton, the candidate for Mayor of the
club. Who Is A. K. Whitton? He is the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1898.
secretary of the Oak Hill Improvement
Company, which has at present a contract
with this city which it is violating most
flagrantly and by means of which it is
robbing the city out of large and valuable
property; and I am told it robbed old
Millus Gay, the original owner of the land
now occupied by Its cemetery. Not con
tent to rob the Jiving, they have levied
tribute upon the graves of the dead. I
hold in my possession a report of the ex
amination of the Oak Hill Cemetery af
fairs by J. H. Leonard, which has been
made under my direction as a member of
the cemetery committee, and which I sub
mit to this honorable body and to the
public in general so that they can see for
themselves what I say is true, and which
1 think will show the motive of that cor
poration for joining hands with the water
company to control the selection of a
Mayor and Council.
\\ ho Is making the fight for Mr. Whit
ton for Mayor in and out of the club?
The San Jose Water Company is mak
ing it through Wilbur Wilcox, its super
intendent, brother-in-law to J. P. Jarman,
who aspires to be Councilman; through
W. B. Hardy and H. E. Schilling, who
hope by the election of J. P. Jarman and
A. K. Whitton and others to maintain
in power this monopoly and hold up the
high price of water as they have done
for years; M. B. Williams, who was in
dicted by the Grand Jury for embezzle
ment and only escaped State's prison by
the mercy of the public and the skin of
his teeth; Samuei N. Boring, who, as
County Clerk, failed to account for cer
tain moneys from the fees of his office
which his bondsmen will have to pay;
Tim Bodley, who, while holding the of
fice as City Clerk, was interested in the
street-sweeping, which cost the city over
$900 a month, which his friend Schilling
assisted him in securing; G. W. Peckham,
who with several other character-assas
sins, members of the Charter Club
were arrested a few years ago for a vile
and dastardly assault upon the character
and reputation of Adolph Greeninger, and
who would have been sent to State's
prison, or at least subjected to a serious
fine, had not Mr. Greeninger taken pity
on the families of the wretches and con
sented to withdraw the charge.
These are a few of the pure-hearted
patriots, who, under the masquerade of
"charter clubs," are now endeavoring to
besmirch the characters of honest men
in this community. The success of such
!'>â¢Â«, He in their attempt to build them
selves up by ruining the reputations of
other men would not be great if it were
not for the fact that they are supported
by certain members of the public press,
who. for motives of their own, have re
solved to blacken and befoul the reputa
tion of San Jose as a well governed city
and a lew-abiding community. 1 refer to
those two San Francisco newspapers
which are at present endeavoring to out
vie each other in the indecencies of yel
low journalismâ the San Francisco Exam
iner and the San Francisco Call. The
former of these sheets has always been
the enemy of this city. It is a newspaper
whose millionaire owner, after outvieing
all of his fellows in the indecency and
immorality of his private life, went into
journalism resolved, if possible, to create
a newspaper which should be as vile and
disreputable as he himself haa been. This
is the newspaper which by its advocacy
of the Sewell assessment "bill before the
State Legislature, enabled the railroad
company to rob the State out of more
than a million and a half of dollars for
which service this harlot in journalism
was placed upon the pay roll of the rail
road company and drew the sum of $22 -
000 in payments of $1000 a month.
The position of the San Francisco Ex
aminer relative to the San Jose Charter
Club would, be distinctly a detriment
were it not for the co-operation of an
other newspaper from which this com
munity had a right to expect nobler and
better things. I refer to the San Fran
cisco Call, which has recently added it
self to the list of yellow journalism and
has chosen San Jose as the mark for its
shafts of misrepresentation and libel.
In its recent article upon the Scully
matter The Call linked my name and that
of my associate, J. P. Fay, with that
transaction, and insinuated that part of
the money reached our hands. I now
brand that statement as a malicious and
willful lie. and now charge that newspa
per with having entered upon a campaign
of dirty politics in order, if possible, to
elect a Legislature and a body of State
officials which shall be subservient to the
interest of the gigantic sugar trust of
which it is the organ, and which, through
its aid, is expected to increase the mighty
millions of the Spreckels family at the
expense of the people of the State of
California.
Mr. Mayor and gentlemen of the Coun
cil: I have made ihesc remarks prelimin
ary to the disposition of the Scully case
1 am glad to say ihat the matter has al
ready been presented to the Grand Jury,
which intends, as 1 am informed, to probe
it to the bottom. So far as I am con
cerned, I court and invite investigation of
the proceedings of this Council during all
of the time which 1 have been a member
of it. My own conduct as a public official
satisfies my own conscience. My reputa
tion as the holder of a public office is
as sacred, to me as my good name as a
private citizen has ever been, and I do
not propose that any man or set of men
shall attack that reputation or make any
insinuations that assail my personal
honor without my fighting back.
I trust that I have said enough to show
the people of this community the secret
and unworthy motives which actuate
some of those who are active In defaming
the officials of this city. In an investi
gation either before the Grand Jury or
before this body I intend that every de
famer shall be dragged to light and his
motives fully known; and I further intend
and pledge myself to the people of this
city that both in this investigation and
every other, whether here or elsewhere,
every rascal, whether he be now in public
office or whether he has been in public
office in the past and is seeking office
again, shall aiso be uncovered and
scourged with the lash of public scorn.
Now. Mr. Mayor, the real motive which
has spurred my soul to action and caused
me to rise to-nls;ht in my exposure of
these Charter Club leaders is more par
ticularly this Julian street Bcandal In,
which Mr. Hardy appears in the double
role of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. William
B. Hardy, the lnpsiration and controlling
manipulator of the Charter Club came be
fore this Council as the attorney of the
Julian street contractors who have re
cently been charged with having organ
ized a raid on the city treasury, now
known as the Julian street sewer scandal.
It was he who represented to this Council
with the honest air with which he can be
seen entering the Christian churches of
this city on a Sunday, that the sum of
$32,000 was a just and honest claim in pay
ment of the job which we find cost less
than $20,000. and who, after having suc
ceeded in slipping his fraudulent claim
through this Council at the unseemly
hour of half-past 8 o'clock, the next morn-
Ing after its passage made a demand in
the office of the City Treasurer for $800 as
his share for acting as a corrupt lobbyist,
and made a request upon your Honor to
segregate the $1600 warrant so that he
could receive that $800 himself, giving as a
reason, when pressed by your Honor, that
$400 of the sum was to be divided among
the members of this Council in equal pro
portions, myself included, at the rate of
$100 apiece. And so far as I was con
cerned, Mr. Hardy knew when he made
the statement he lied.
And you, Mr. Mayor, my associate as a
member of this Council for the past two
years, went to a reputable citizen of this
town and a friend of mine, to prove to
him my vulnerability and my political dis
honesty. Did you not make that state
ment? Unseal your lips and speak the
truth to the people of this city. My
sacred honor is at stake and I demand the
truth from you.
Now. as far as you. Mr. Dlttus. and
you, Mr. Krieg, are concerned in this mat
ter, you can speak for yourselves. You
know and so does everybody in this city
that you were the candidates of the San
Jose Water Company and were elected by
their influence and their money at the
last city election, assisted by the leading
spirits of the so-called Charter Club;
that we never voted together upon this
Council except when we were forced so
to do or absolutely stop the business of
the city.
In conclusion, gentlemen, permit me to
say that I am not a candidate at the com
ing election, and these remarks are only
made in defense of my personal and pub
lic honor, and I leave the selection of the
incoming Mayor and Council to the hon
est men of this city, who, I hope, have
now information enough to proceed to act
intelligently.
The tirade was not once Interrupted
by any sign of approval by the audi
ence present. At its conclusion Nolt
ing argued against any investigation
of the Scully matter by the Council
on the ground that Scully's resigna
tion ended the whole affair. It was
common report previous to to-night
that the Council would not dare to go
into an investigation of this case.
Investigations were evidently the
order of the session. A communica
tion from City Electrician J. W. Chute,
which under normal conditions would
have excited great interest, was read.
It opened as follows:
A certain newspaper of this city known
as the San Jose Daily Herald has recent
ly made certain charges against me as
regards my duties as City Electrician. If
the charges of carelessness, neglect, in
competency and mismanagement made
against me by the Herald are true there
certainly should be an investigation of the
management of my office. 1 deny the
charges made by the Herald.
After reviewing the charges in detail
and denying them seriatim, Mr. Chute
closes his letter to the Council in the
following drastic style:
In conclusion I will say that when the
Herald says 1 urn responsible for the
damaged condition of the fire alarm re
peater, it lies. When the Herald says
that I do not attend to the lire alarm
system myself, it lies. When the Herald
says that I had anything to do with the
so-called fire alarm or storage battery, it
lies. When the Herald says that I have
let the tire alarm system run down, it
lies. I am ready at any time for an in
vestigation of my management of the fire
alarm system.
As part evidently of the plan of cam
paign of the gang, Nolting introduced
an ordinance lixing water ra,tes at half
of the present charges. This was a
blow struck In revenge at the San
Jose Water Company, which furnishes
its present supply of water to the city.
The consideration of the matter went
over until next Monday. The rates
must be fixed this month.
REV. ALEXANDER
SPANKS A DAUGHTER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. 21.â Rev. T. W. Alexan
der, a Baptist evangelist, was arrested
yesterday for whipping Lillie Alexander,
his 17-year-old daughter. Rev. Mr. Alex
ander lives at 410 M street. He reproved
his daughter, but she did not submit
tamely to her father's rebuke, and defied
him. When taunted by the headstrong
daughter, the Rev. Alexander conclud
ed that the time for action had arrived,
and started in to give her a spanking..
The girl resisted and managed to escape,
after receiving several slaps. Lillie ran
out Into the back yard screaming at the
top of her voice. Neighbors heard the
cries and thought that some one was
being murdered.
It was soon discovered that only a little
parental discipline was being adminis
tered. Some one telephoned for the police,
and Officer Henry Russell responded,
placing the preacher under arrest. Dur
ing the afternoon Rev. Alexander was
released from jail by order of Recorder
Olark, who had been interviewed by one
of the older daughters. To-day Rev.
Alexander expressed himself as humiliat
ed by the' disgrace of being placed under
arrest. He would not explain the cause
of the disturbance of the day before.
He came to California from Tennessee
in 1884, and first located in Woodville,
Tulare County, where he was pastor of
the Baptist church for five years. At
one time he was pastor of the Malaga
Baptist Church. His wife has been ill
with fever for the past five weeks. The
indiscretions of Lillie and her younger
sister no doubt caused the family rupture.
For some time the young women created
a great deal of unfavorable comment. For
a while they were on the streets nearly
every night, and finally the police noti
fied them to stay at home. One evening
they were taken from the back room of a
saloon.

WILL NOT AGAIN
BE PROSECUTED
BpÂ«ctal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 21.â The nine additional
charges of bank wrecking against H. M.
Leonard, ex-president of the Santa Clara
Bank, were to-day placed on the trial
calendar for March 14 by Judge Lorigan.
This was done at the request of Attorney
H. V. Morehouse, counsel for Leonard,
and is but a preliminary step looking to
their dismissal.
The Santa Clara Bank failed in 1894. An
investigation showed Leonard had been
dabbling in stocks, and that he had
embezzled about $200,000 of the bank's
money. He was indicted on ten charges
of embezzlement 'and falsifying the rec
ords of the bank. The trial of the first
charge resulted in his conviction, and
he was sentenced to Folsom prison for
two years. He was released about a year
ago, and since then has been living at
Santa Clara.
The remaining nine cases against Leon
ard were never brought to trial nor form
ally dismissed. It was generally under
stod that there would be no further prose
cution of the ex-bank official after he
had completed his term of imprisonment.
He has, however, for some months been
very anxious and worried because his
record in the Criminal Court was not
clear. He feared that the charges might
at any time be brought up against him
in case he should embark in a business
venture..

Los Angeles Water Com
pany Continues Its
Defiance.
Fails to File an Inventory
Within the Allotted Two
"Weeks.
City Council Takes No Action to
Bring the Corporation to
Terms.
Special Dlspatrh to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21.â As was
predicted in The Call, the water com
pany failed to comply with the demand
of the City Council to give an inven
tory of the amount of the property it
received from the city when it took its
lease thirty years ago, and of the im
provements since made. The two weeks
given in which to comply with the de
mand have expired. Not one word has
been received from the corporation.
With its customary arrogance it has
not only failed to give the information,
but it has not given any reason for its
failure to comply.-
The Council stated in its original
resolution that if the information was
not forthcoming the Council would pro
ceed to enter a default upon its con
tract; but it did not enter the default,
nor did it take any action. When
asked afterward about this failure sev
eral councilmen said that they thought
a week more should be given, but if
within that time no answer was filed
they would be in favor of taking a de
fault.
The Council to-day fixed the water
rates for the ensuing year. The ex
isting schedule was adopted. It will
not go into effect until July 1. This
will give the water company the bene
fit of the schedule for only twenty-two
days, as the contract expires on July
22, and if the law is strong enough and
the corporation is not above it, the
plant will then pass into the possession
of the city. This the company will en
deavor to defeat with the aid of the
syndicated dailies and all the powerful
pressure from the outside that the cor
poration can bring to bear.
Should the corporation retain posses
sion of the plant after the expiration
of the lease a petition will be pre
sented to the Council asking for an
immediate reduction in rates of .5 per
cent This would have the effect of
making the business of serving Los
Angeles people with water through
streaks of rust of but little profit to
the corporation.
BEMOVE THE SECRETARY.
School Directors Heed the Howl of

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21.-The perpetual
hounding of School Director A. M. Bragg
by the syndicated local press has had Its
effect as was shown to-night when he
voted' with the League for Better City
Government combine in the board.
Director Bragg gave his vote to a po
litical trade made by the truly good ele
ment, whereby the schemers in that band
were enabled to name the secretary of
the school board and the superintendent
of janitors and buildings. It required five
votes to do this and in order to get the
fifth vote the strait-laced combiners
traded the position of superintendent of
janitors, who was named by the good Dr.
Mathus, the director from the sixth ward,
who in turn voted for the pure combina
tion's candidate for secretary.
It became necessary for the board at its
session to-night to elect a secretary. The
City Attorney gave an opinion that at its
session two weeks ago it had elected N. S.
Averill, but that last week it had declared
H. G. Johnson secretary of the board.
This was done at the last meeting by the
vote of Director Bragg, who for the first
time took his seat in the board. Ever
since then Mr. Bragg has been subjected
to daily attack and threatened with worse
by the syndicate press. So to-night he
reversed himself and lined up with the
self-confessed reformers who are making
a hot fight to control all the patronage
they can get. â¢ ' â  n
A motion was made to declare Averill
the secretary of the board, and it was
carried by the deciding vote of Bragg.
Then the board did a most extraordi
nary thing. By a unanimous vote a reso
lution was adopted thanking H. G. John
son, the retiring secretary, for the abili
ty, honesty and integrity he had shown as
secretary of the board. This being the
case, Mr. Johnson's friends are asking
why the League for Better City Govern
ment and only self-confessedly pure mem
bers of the board were so anxious to and
finally did, with the aid of Director
Bragg, remove from office a competent
and an honest man, who had served the
board for over a year and who was fully
informed as to the duties of a position
which calls for a great deal of technical
information. No charges of any characr
ter had been or were llled against Mr.
Johnson.

Birthday at the City of

Delivers :an Address atÂ«the Exercises
of the University of Penn
sylvania.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 21.â President
McKinley, accompanied by his secretary,
J. Addison Porter, arrived here this after
noon. They were driven direct to the
residence of Charles C. Harrison, provost
of the University of Pennsylvania, whose
guest the President will be during his
stay in the city. The President will to
morrow deliver an oration at the Wash
ington birthday exercises of the Univers
ity of Pennsylvania at the Academy of
Music. The Pennsylvania station and the
streets adjacent thereto were crowded
with people eager to see and greet the
chief magistrate. A double line of police
men kept open a passageway from the
train to the street, and the President, with
his hat in his hand, bowed his acknowl
edgment of the handclapping and cheer
ing. Two companies of mounted police
escorted the carriages to Mr. Harrison's
residence. Cheering crowds greeted the
President along the entire route. To
night an informal dinner was given in the
President's honor by Provost Harrison.
Seth Low, president of Columbia Col
lege, and Mrs. Low were present.
In view of the condition of public af
fairs, every arrangement had been made
to keep the President in touch with all
the departments at Washington and to
keep him fully informed of developments
at Havana. Direct telegraphic communi
cation had been established between
Washington and Mr. Harrison's house,
and in addition to this a long-distance
telephone was placed at the disposal of
the President.
Both the front and rear of Provost
Harrison's residence are guarded by
policemen to-night, and in all his move
ments while in the city the chief exec
utive will be closely followed by a cordon
of officer*.
MONEY FOR SAN
PEDRO HARBOR
Sundry Civil Appropria
tion Bill Carries
$400,000.
Likely to Go Through Despite
Opposition in House and
Senate.
Large Sum to Bo Voted for Im
provements in the Oakland
Harbor.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 21.
The advocates of a deep harbor for
San Pedro have beaten Huntington and
the Southern Pacific, for, as predicted
in last night's dispatches to The Call,
the sundry civil appropriation bill re
ported to-day carries $400,000 for the
work at San Pedro during the next
fiscal year. This is a triumph for Judge
Maguire and Congressman Barlow.
There may be a bitter opposition to it
on the floor of the House and Senate,
but the friends of San Pedro are con
fident that it will go through.
Oakland harbor also gets a large
amount. The limit of cost was fixed
at $666,000 in the original bill and $133,
000 is to be appropriated for this fiscal
year. This amount, with the unexpend
ed balance of $33,000 from last year's
appropriation, will make a total of
$166,000 available for the next fiscal
year. It is assumed by Congressman
Hilborn that the work on the tidal ca
nal will be included, although this is by
no means certain, for it is discretionary
with the War Department whether or
not the tidal canal project will be un
dertaken. Congressman Hilborn is of
the opinion that the Oakland harbor
project proper will receive the first at
tention, and that work on the tidal ca
nal, whether a tidal canal for sanitary
purposes, may properly be undertaken
by the Federal Government.
The decision in this matter is not final,
however, and it may be that the War
Department will eventually use a part
of the ' Oakland harbor appropriation
In continuing the tidal canal work. No
appropriations were made for the re
moval of Arch and Shag rocks and
other obstructions in San Francisco
harbor for the reason that the sundry
civil only makes appropriations to
carry out contracts already made by
the War Department. The removal of
these obstructions will have to be pro
vided for in the river and harbor bill,
if one is passed at this session, which
seems doubtful at this time.
Other items included in the sundry
civil bill are as follows: For continuing
construction of public buildings in San
Francisco, $500,000; for the establish
ment of telephone connections between
lightship and lighthouse at Point
Arena, $860; for fish culture stations
at Baird and Fort Gaston, Cal., $4620;
for enforcement of the Chinese exclu
sion act, $100,000; for surveys and re
surveys of the Pacific Coast (including
Alaska), $54,400, of which $15,000 is
made immediately available; for sur
veying and temporarily marking a
portion of the eastern boundary of the
State of California, $10,000; for continu
ing work on the wall at the Presidio,
San Francisco, $5000: for defraying ex
penses of the California Debris Com
mission, $15,000; expenses of Soldiers'
Home at Santa Monica, $25,000.

DON'T BREAK DOWN.
So Many Men and Women Do When It Is
Entirely Needless.
Strong men often die early, not because
their vital forces are exhausted, but be
cause they abuse their powers, waste
their energies and break down their con
stitutions. Hence, careful people often
live long, while people who are robust but
rash go down to early graves. But
strange as it may seem, many men ana
women by adopting the right means have
been able to overcome dangerous ailments
that would have killed the strongest man.
With care they have eventually gained a
remarkable degree of health and vigor
Some interesting examples of this fact
have recently come to light, among which
are the following:
Miss Anna Maxoy of South Solon. Ohio,
recently said- "I suffered from nervous
prostration, indigestion, and sleeplessness
following a spell of sickness until my life
was despaired of. I took the best tonics
my physician could prescribe without re
ceiving the least benefit. Finally he ad
vised me to take a course of Duffy's Pure
Malt Whiskey. I did so, and am now able
to eat well, sleep well, and am rapidly
gaining strength."
Mr J M. Gaverick of Harrisburg, Pa.,
says: "For several years I was in very
bad health, as my work is very confining
and I do not get enough exorcise to digest
my food. By taking Duffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey, however, I experienced a re
markable change. I now feel better than
I ever felt before. I honestly believe there
is nothing better for an appetizer and
strengthener."
People in sound health and people who
do not feel as well as they ought to feel
can profitably heed these words. They ara
sufficient to prove that both as a preven
tion and a cure this remarkable whiskey
is absolutely unequaled. __^

Chinese Opium Dealers
Who Will Probably
Be Surprised.
Orders Issued to Pay Up Fees
Within Twenty-Four

CONSULTING THE CONSUL.
A Te6t Case to Be Inaugurated Be
fore the Courts at
Once.
As a result of startling and yet mys
tericms events that have happened dur
ing the past few days License Collect
or Bonnet has decided to bring the Chi
â¢pium dealers up with the round
turn.
The dealers have been trying to
"reach" the license collector, and.
though the effort has never gone as far
as a direct offer of a bribe, probably
because the dealers discovered that they
had tackled the wrong man. the inten
: â â ' use corrupt methods was so
palpable to Mr. Bonnet that he decid
ed to act without delay.
The Board of Supervisors passed an
ordinance some time ago imposing a
license on the sale of opium, but since
that time no particular effort has been
made to enforce the measure because
there was a question as to the legaliti
es the ordinance, and Mr. Bonnet did
not care to jeopardize his position in
the matter by hasty action.
It recently came to the license col
lector's ears, however, that a member
of a well-known firm of attorneys was
receiving 5400 per month from the opi
um dealers to keep them advised of the
legal aspect of the case.
Following closely on this information
came the intelligence from a friend that
the latter had been approached by an
agent of the Chinese, who desired "to
do business." The agent asked Bon
net's friend whether or not the license
collector was open to "conviction."
He intimated that some of the Chi
nese though that Bonnet was getting
a portion of the legal expenses because
no movement had been made against
them and that they thought that they
might as well deal direct if such a pro
ceeding was possible. Bonnet's friend
communicated with him immediately
and the result of their fishhig excur
sion will probably astonish the Chinese
dealers.
Startled by the phase that the mat
ter had taken Mr. Bonnet immediately
called on the Chinese Consul and stated
the facts of the case, inquiring whether
or not the dealers would receive any
encouragement from the consulate. He
was told that Chinese subjects were
expected to obey the law and the con
sulate would not interfere.
Thereupon Mr. Bonnet caused to be
issued, after consultation with the City
and County Attorney, a notice to the
effect that opium license fees must be
paid within twenty-four hours. These
notices were served on twenty-one
dealers and unless the license fees are
paid to-day arrests will follow at once.
The plan is that Mr. Bonnet shall
himself purchase a flve-tael tin of
opium from one of the dealers and then
rause the latter's arrest for selling the
drug without a license. A contest will
doubtless be made by eminent legal
counsel employed by the dealers and
the legality of the ordinance will be at
once determined.
KLONDIKE INQUIRERS.
The Alaska Committee Keports Hay-
ing Received a Letter From
Senator Perkins.
Inqulrles are coming into the Alaska
Trade Committee rooms as to the possi
bilities of securing miners' certificates at
Victoria while the steamer is waiting.
The committee has secured assurances
from tbe steamship lines that they will
hold their steamers there sufficiently
long to accomplish this.
A letter was received from Senator
Perkins, conveying information for which
the secretary had written concerning the
working of the late ruling of the Ireas
nry Department in relation to the trans
portation of goods across American terri
tory and en route for the Klondike. The
essence of these rulings Is that a man
reaching Dyea or Skaguay with Cana
dian-bought goods must either pay brok
ers' fees and cost of a bond, or deposit
money sufficient to cover the same at the
port of entry, and then upon arriving at
the British line he must send back his re
lease of the bond or a certificate In order
to get his money back, the only alter
native being that of paying $6 a day for
an escort through American territory.
A letter was received yesterday from
Governor Sheakley, with his final report
from the Chicago office. The Governor
assures the committee that good work
has been done in Chicago and that San
Francisco is s,ure to see the results, but
that these will be more apparent after the
Yukon all-water route is open.

The captain of the United States rev
enue cutter Rush reported to Collector
Jackson yesterday that ho found the Can-
. ndian Bealer Mary Taylor at anchor In
r>rakee Bay, with a sprung mainmast.
There were no evidences of poaching on
her part. She had not been there longer
than the twenty-four hours allowed In
such cases, and at the request of the
commander of the Rush the sealer set out
for the open sea.
MERCHANTS GREET PRESIDENT DOLE.
The Chamber of Commerce Formally Receives the Executive Officer of the
Island Republic.
President Sanford B. Dole of the Hawaiian Republic was the guest of the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce yesterday. The reception was a formal one, and when the visiting President was escorted into the hall of
the Chamber of Commerce building the room was crowded with the merchants and business men of the city. Presi
dent Dole was escorted from his hotel to the reception by E. R. Dimond and G. H. Newhall. The navy was rep
resented by Lieutenant T. Porter, Lieutenant H. M. Dombaugh and Assistant Engineer Armin Hartrath of the
Mohican.
Charles Nelson, vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce, presided and welcomed the guest of the day. in
his address he said the representative business men of this city were pleased to welcome and ontertain the execu
tive officer of the island republic. "We are much pleased to have him with us after his visit to Pi 'sident McKinley,"
he said, "because we believe he has done much to further the cause of the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands.
We as merchants and business men believe that the Hawaiian Islands should be a part of op: Republic. This
Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly by resolutions and by memorials to our legislators placed itself on record as
desiring that the islands should' be a part of our territory."
President Dole in reply said it pleased him to be back in California, where by family ties ai d close business
relations he was among friends that made him feel at home again. "But, indeed, in my travels a< toss the Ameri
can continent," he said, "I found the people so friendly and they greeted me so cordially that I felt at home where
ever I went. They made me feel that I was an American, and that is what I hope soon to be. I prize much the
opportunities while in Washington to place before the Congressmen and Senators there the advantage's of annex
ation, and 1 I feel that it is in good hands and that we Hawaiians will soon be a part of the American people."
Mayor Phelan, speaking as a member of the Chamber of Commerce and not as an officer of the city, said the
traditional feeling of the American citizens not to acquire territory that is not contiguous to our continent should
be a thing of the past. "This is not a time for traditions," he said. "In the last few years space has been anni
hilated. Hawaii is now much nearer to us than California was to the seat of our Government when she was ad
mitted to the Union. Hawaii is a point of great strategical importance. It is the key of the Pacific Ocean, and
we cannot afford to play dog in the manger with it much longer. If we dc not annex the islands some other coun
try will, and it will always be a source of menace to our Pacific Coast ports. It is now time for Conpress to act,
and we as citizens should not let slip the opportunity to advocate annexation when our business interests are so
much at stake."
A telegram was read from Hugh Craig, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, dated at Grafton, W.
Va. It offered congratulation to the visiting President and urged the advocacy of annexation.
Irving M. Scott, in a short address, advocated annexation of the islands. He said Hawaii was tied to us by
friendship and commerce, and the question of annexation was a plain one. "Hawaii," he said, "will increase in
importance to this country as the commerce of the Asiatic shores grows."
MAMMY REIGNS
NO LONGER
Fred Bell Wins a Victory
in Judge Coffey 's
Court.
His "Mother" Must Make an
Accounting and Furnish
a New Bond.
This Deprives Her Aged Servant of
All Her Power and May-
Bring Peace.
The days of the aged "Mammy"
Pleasant's rule in the "House of Mys
tery." in the home of the Bells, have
ceased to be. By a decision rendered
by Judge Coffey yesterday the scepter
that has long been wielded over that
household by the stalwart negress has
been stripped of its power, and the
reign of "Mammy" is at an end.
With the downfall of "Mammy" j
comes a victory for young Fred Bell, i
who has long been held by his foster i
mother In fact, Mrs. Theresa Bell, the â 
only obstacle in her pathway of con- !
tent. Several months ago Fred brought
a suit against Mrs. Bell, whom at that
time he had good reason to believe ;
was his mother, to remove her as his
guardian as well as the guardian of j
his brothers and sisters, five in num
ber. He also asked that Mrs. Bell be j
ordered to make an accounting of the ;
funds that had come into her hands :
since the death of her husband, Thom
as F. Bell, which occurred five years '
ago. The applications of Fred Bell \
were bitterly contested by Mrs. Bell,
and when, as the Â«case progressed, she
saw defeat was probable, she took a
desperate step to strengthen her case,
went on the stand and repudiated the
young man and the eldest daughter of
Thomas F. Bell, swearing that they
were not her children. The woman's ;
statement, under oath, fell like a thun- j

derbolt, but those who had long ex
pected a sensation from the Bell man
sion felt that they had been rewarded.
The case progressed, and last Friday
Fisher Ames, who represented the de
fendant in the action, argued the case
on behalf of his client. Ames grilled
the young man from the opening to the
close of his argument. He referred to
him as a "leech," a "house hog," and
repeated anew the story of how Fred
erick some time ago indulged in a hi
larious escapade with a company of
1 young people In which several ladles of
1 color participated. Ames was merci
less in his roast, but between his words
1 of vituperation he worked in the legal
i end of his case, contending that under
: the law in event Mrs. Bell was re
' moved as guardian the court could not
1 demand an accounting. He contended
| that she might do as she pleased with
| the monthly family allowance.. He
; averred that she had always conduct
j ed the duties involved in the matter of
â  the guardianship of her children In a
satisfactory manner and should not be
interfered with.
Yesterday Attorney W. H. Schooler,
who has been prosecuting the com
plainant's interests, made his argu
ment. For Mrs. Bell he had but words
of sympathy; for "Mammy" Pleasant
i but words of condemnation. He reit
i crated the oft-told story of the influ
i ence of the negress in the Bell house
hold and appealed to the court if Just
ice was to be done that the mother
should be removed as guardian of her
children and the young people whoso
; maternity she had repudiated; that she
! should be forced to make an account
ing and that in event she had not ful
filled her obligations to those the law
demanded when she was appointed
guardian, those who went on her bond
I should be forced to assume the deficit.
1 When Attorney Schooler had finished
his argument the court rendered its de
cision. Judge Coffey held that it
was the policy of the law whenever
possible to refrain from sanctioning or
committing an act that might lead to
! a disruption in a family that might
: never be healed. The act of removing
; Mrs. Bell as the guardian of her chil
i dren, the complainant and his sister
'â  might result in such a culmination, anJ
j for that reason the court refused to
; grant the request of the petitioner on
: that point. The court, however, or
| dered that Mrs. Bell make an account
ing within ten days of all the moneys
i she had expended since the death of
â¢ her husband. Attorney Ames mildly
' protested, but the order stood as de
1 livered by the Judge. "The next issue
in this case," said his Honor, "will be
ito reduce the family allowance. Al
\ though I have allowed Mrs. Bell to re
; tain her charge as guardian I feel that
: it is incumbent upon the court to some
what deter the influence of Mrs. Pleas
! ant. For this reason the family al
: lowance must be reduced. I further or
| der that Mrs. Bell produce a new bond
, for the performance of her duties as
guardian." The order of the court
: compelling Mrs. Bell to produce a new
bond relieves "Mammy" Pleasant and
her faithful friend, Rebecca Boone, of
that responsibility. For past errors
in the usage of money in the home of
the Bells, however, the colored "bonds
women" will be held responsible, says
Fred Bell's attorney. In the decision
of yesterday young Bell holds that he
has won a substantial victory in his
fight for his rights, but he says that
before the name of Bell ceases to be
heard in the courts of law he will have
succeeded in gaining ali those things
that are here.
DROWNED IN MAD RIVER.
William Lees Loses His Life in Try
ing to Ford the Stream.
A letter was received fh this city a few
days ago from Edward Cotter, a resident
of Humboldt County, in which he speaks
of the death by drowning in the Mad
River of William Lees, an English
rancher.
The accident occurred a week ago Sun
day, and as yet his body has not been
recovered. He had forded the stream
earlier in the day without any trouble,
but on his return found that it had risen
and was racing along like a torrent. Al
though advised by many people not to
cross, the undaunted rider did not
heed. He rode his horse into the stream,
and was half way over when the full
force of the current struck him. The
horse struggled to regain the shore, but
was swept off its feet and drowned. Lees
was swept down the river by the cur
rent and away from the view of those on
shore who were powerless to help him.
It is thought his body was carried to the
mouth of the river and swept into the
ocean.
Lees was well known throughout Hum
boldt County, and his death is deeply
deplored. He was unmarried, and owned
one of the best ranches In his district.
Intoxicating Malt.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch yes
| terday notified half a dozen keepers of
! cigar shops within the university mile
\ limit of Berkeley that they must walk
|up to his office and pay the revenue
I license on a liquor which they are selling,
| and which is called malt ale, manufac
tured in this city. The stuff contains
some hops, and for this reason the Col
lector claims that it must pay a license,
! although the sellers contend that it is not
! an alcoholic intoxicant. The tax will be
I enforced.
Must Wear Uniforms.
Surveyor of the Port Spear has given
; orders that the regulation of the Treas-
I ury Department requiring the wearing of
; uniforms hy customs officers while on
duty must be observed. His attention has
i been railed to the fact that the regula
i tion is not being complied with, and he
Is determined that the abuse shall not
be allowed to be perpetuated.

WAKENED BY A
PISTOL SHOT
Thomas Morris Rudely
Aroused From His
Slumbers.
He Thinks an Attempt Has
Been Made on His
Life.
An Old Enemy Lately Seen Lurking
in the Vicinity of His
Home.
Thomas Morris, a well-known citizen
living at 33 Juniper street, had a nar
row escape from death at the hands of
some miscreant last Sunday evening.
Mr. Morris owns considerable real es
tate in the vicinity of Tenth and Fal
som streets, and occupies a room on
the first floor in the rear of one of his
houses on Juniper street, a cul de sac
running off Folsom, between Tenth and
Eleventh. Sunday night he went home
at about 10 o'clock, and retired as usu
al. He was just falling asleep when
he was aroused by a pistol shot which
seemed just over his heajd, followed by
a crashing of glass. Fully alarmed, he
arose at once to make an investigation,
and found that a bullet had crashed
through a window just over his bed,
narrowly missing him, and buried it
self in the wall.
Too frightened to go out into the
yard and make an investigation, he
peered through the window, but could
distinguish nothing in the inky dark
ness without, although he imagined he
heard footsteps in the yard outside.
The man who fired the shot evidently
was not lacking in nerve to carry out
his nefarious design, as it is necessary
to pass through a covered passageway
and climb half way up a flight of out
er stairs to fire a bullet which would
follow the course pursued by the one
which entered Morris' window.
Morris has lived in the vicinity for a
great many years, and has a host of
friends who testify to his good habits
and exceptionally upright character,
and what should have tempted anyone
to fire the shot is a mystery. Some of
the neighbors suggest that the ball
may have been fired at pestiferous cats
and gone astray, but a casual investi
gation of the premises scouts any such
theory, as the bullet could only have
been fired from one place, and that is
the stairway leading from the first floor
to the yard.
Morris hints darkly at an old enemy
who has recently made his appearance
in the neighborhood, and says he will
put detectives on the case. He seems
to be In great fear of his life, and
dreads spending another night in the
room. Last night, however, he risked
it again, but securely fastened the al
leyway gate leading into the back yard
and placed a set of thick shutters on
the inside of the window.
SUICIDE OF JOSEPH DEVOTO.
He Made His Last Stop at a Saloon
Before Plunging Into the Bay.
Joseph Devoto, who worked for his
brother, David, at the latter's coal yard,
430 Pacific street, committed suicide yes
terday morning by drowning himself in
the bay near the foot of Union street. He
had been given $85 by his brother on the
day before to pay off some of the bills
against the coal yard, but instead had
gone on a spree and spent or had been
robbed of the money.
The last time he was seen was at 6
o"clock yesterday morning, when he en
tered the saloon of R. Sohottler, at 401
Broadway, and took a drink, paying for
the same with a f>o-cent piece. When the
change was tendered him by the bar
keeper, Devoto told him to keep the
change; that that would be the last he
would see of Devoto. The body of the
unfortunate man was discovered floating
near the foot of Union-street wharf at
7 o'clock yesterday morning and was
taken to the Morgue.
ANXIOUS TO RE-ENLIST.
Retired National Guard Officers
Beady to Fight in the Event
of War.
Retired officers of the National Guard
are anxious to show their patriotism, and
many have signified their intention of re
enlistihg in the event of trouble between
this country and Spain.
The question that confronts them is
whether they would be assigned to the
same positions they ocupled on their re
tirement. Major-General Dickinson of
the National Guard, when asked about
the matter yesterday, said: "If a retired
officer wanted to enlist again he would
have to take his chance of being detailed
by the Governor to duty equivalent to his
old office; otherwise he would have to
take the chances of any other enlisted
man and go into the ranks. Should we
have trouble, however, there is no doubt
in my mind that there will be plenty of
positions to fin."
Held for Murder.
Charles Dean, the Chinese who mur
dered Tit Sing in her rooms on Bartlett
alley on Sunday night, February 13. was
yesterday held to answer before the Su
perior Court by Judge Joachimsen with
out bail. No evidence was put in for the
defense.

A stenographer for a large law firm in Boston had a rather
common experience : My work," she said, " is very nervous and ex-
acting, and^l used to leave the office utterly exhausted. At night I
would often have the most horrible dreams, and sometimes wake up in
a cold sweat. : Once I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed clutch-
ing the bed clothes frantically with both hands. "I became so dis-
heartened that I finally told my employer I must give up my position,
but he laughed, and said he wanted me to stay, and then suggested
that I try his remedy for such troubles. He gave me half a dozen
Ripans Tabules and told me to take one after dinner and another
before going to bed. I did so,. and rested better that very night
Now, whenever I feel nervous, I take just" one Tabule before retiring
and I sleep right through till morning, and get up thoroughly rested
and ready for business. For a sleep-producer and a auieter of the
nerves, these Tabules are simply wonderful." . :

THE RAIN.
Sunday's rain was a disappointment to the
grain trade. It was liberal where it was not
particularly needed and scant where It was
needed badly. The Salinas Valley got only .06
to 08 of an inch and the Pan Joaquin Valley
only .03 to .10, while the bay and northern
counties received from .40 to .S5, and in some
places over an inch fell. Barley went up in
consequence of this showing. Wheat futures
also advanced and Hay was flrm at Saturda> s
figures.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flg
cres at station indicate maximum temperature
for the days; thOM underneath It, if any, the
amount of rainfall, of malted snow In inches
and hundredth." during the past twelve hours.
Isobar*, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usur.lly accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south a'.ong the coast, rain 1b probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is lm-
Fr^hable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
daho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
Jn summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
epposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NKW YORK, "Feb. 21.-To-day's heavy de
cline In the stock market was made without
another actual new development in the situa
tion, but was rather to be attributed to a com
bination of impressions which have been the
underlying force In speculation for a week or
more. To-day's market demonstrated for one
thing that last week*! decline would have been
much heavier on the developments in the Cuban
question, had it not been for the support of
powerful interests who desired an opportunity
to realize. The entire absence of support to
day gave color to the supposition that those
Interests had completed their liquidation and
were indifferent to the course of the market.
The motives assigned for the selling had less
apparent basis in fact than were furnished by
the developments of last week. So far as they
turned on the Cuban question they dealt with
the speculations on possible future events and
on abstruse points of international law without
any convincing authority to back them Ap
prehensions growing out of the rate war for
passenger business between the Canadian Pa
cific: and our own transcontinental linea had a
more substantial basis, though a soothing sug
gestion was offered that the profits and divi
dends were not largely dependent on passenger
business anyhow. There seemed to be no real
izing sense that this suggestion was inconsis
tent with the large advances which had been
forced in the price of securities on hopes of
Klondike traffic. The great snow storm In the
West was also a factor of real importance,
both by reason of the interruption to railroad
traffic and the possible damage to crops. What
ever the real motive. It was beyond dispute
that there were large offerings of securities for
which there was no adequate demand, and
selling orders to stop losses were uncovered on
the descending scale. Declines were so great
that the prices that looked attractive as bar
gains were reached in many cases and buying
thus invited steadier prices and worked re
coveries. This was repeated several times dur
ing the day, and the market closed with an
other rally In full force, thus leaving the net
declines decidedly smaller than the extreme
declines during the day. A feature of the day
â was the marking up of call loans to 1% per cent
in accordance with the reduction in the sur
plus reserve. The local market paid no atten
tion to the firmer tone on foreign exchange
due to the subsidence of apprehension over the
West African situation, which was regarded
with such acute misgivings on the local ex
change on Saturday. London was a buyer on
balances in 'he New York market to-day.
The course of the bond market was in ac
cordance with stocks in both declines and
rallies. The loss at one time was from 1 to 2
! per cent in many leading bonds. Total sales,

LONDON MARKETS.
I NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â The Evening Post's
[ London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here opened flat to-day on politics. A
recovery at midday was followed by a further
sharp fall, mainly on bear operations and
New York sales of Americans. Paris bought
steadily through the day. including Ameri
cans, but this was powerless to support the
â  market. Unless there should be a sharp rally
i to-morrow morning big differences are to be
! met. notably In Grand Trunk and Americans,
by weak operators. At the same time there
have also been commitments In the last few
1 days.
New York's heavy selling to-night, occur
ring on the eve of the settlement here and the
holiday In the United States to-morrow, de
moralized the market and caused a gloomy
feeling, Grand Trunk .and Canadian Pacific be
ing $3 to $6 lower than at the last settlement.
Argentines were better. Mines were dull. The
settlement in that market is featureless.
; Gold Ik in fair demand at 77s 9\A. but the
I demand is now confined to South America.
! There is good reason to believe that but for
i this bar gold might go to the Bank of Eng
land French exchange has been easier, but
closed firm at last week's high rate of 25.27.
It is expected that resumption of purchases of
, stocks here by French capital will induce a
1 further rise. France will also find it neces
| sary to make large purchases of wheat.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
1 CHICAGO, Feb. 21.â 1t looked at the open
' ing in wheat as though there was to be an
| other wild day In the pit. May was bid for
; at the commencement all the way from fl 06 to
j $1 07%, the higher of the figures being an ad
: vance of l%c over Saturday's closing Â»>rlce
j Most of the bidding was at $1 06 and the prices
settled there for a moment. Then it roÃe rap
! Idly to |1 07%. declined a cent and worked back
more slowly to II 07. July was affected also,
though not showing such rapid or violent flue
â  tuattons. The break in New Vow stocks and
i the war talk in the morning papers undoubt
; edly had a good deal of influence on shorts,
; whose anxiety to cover was responsible for the
I nervousness the market displayed. The Leiter
representatives claim they did nothing at to
1 day's market. The crowd believed that a good
| portion of the buying was done on every soft
spot for his credit, and this belief added to
the general nervousness. Wheat on ocean pass
age showed an Increase for the week of 2,320,
000 bushels. This provoked lively selling fr./tn
â¢â¢ scattered longp. Up to midday the market
â  showed a series of fluctuations more or less
i violent, May being bid up at one time to $1 08,
but dropping at once to $1 07%. July acted
heavier and did not get at any time above
93% c. The visible figures were a disappoint
| ment to the hulls. They showed a decrease of
I but 301,000 bushels, and but for the heavy de
j crease at Chicago, owing to the Leiter ship
ments, there would probably have been an in-
I crease. Free selling both of July and May fol
lowed this announcement. Toward the close
a sudden bulge In New York, and the good ex
port b'lsinees from the Atlantic ports, 572,000
bushels, injected some strength Into the drop
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TTJESDAT, FEBRUARY 22, 1898,

There was heavy selling of corn from every

cables flrm. May closed %c lower.

STARVING FOR PLEASURE.
Prolonged hunger is without doubt
the most terrible suffering to which the
human frame can be exposed, said a
physician recently, to the writer. Yet
I have known cases where a man has
actually, of his own free will, deprived
himself of the necessities of life, al
though well able to procure them. I
do not speak of professional fasting
men, but what may be termed ama
teurs.
Not very long ago a well known
young fellow in society very nearly
killed himself in this way. He made a
heavy wager that he would abstain
from food of any sort for the period of
seven days, drinking only a little water
during that time. At the end of the
third day his condition was so serious
that medical advice was necessary, and
the young man is likely to feel the re
sults of his foolhardy experiment for
some time to come.
In these days, when realism is the
keynote of much of our literature, one
can hardly be surprised at anything
which the authors of it attempt. I
have under my hands now a young
writer who was engaged on a book â
not yet finished â in which the hero un
dergoes the experience of being with
out food or water for several days.
Anxious to describe the sensations of
such a position with exactitude, the
author actually conceived the idea of
suffering the privation himself, with
the result that he will be incapacitated
from continuing his work for some
months at least.
Not nearly so extreme as the above
is the case of a wealthy capitalist, who
suffered from the curious malady of
never, in the least degree, feeling hun
gry. One day, out of charity, he took
a gaunt looking beggar into a restau
rant and paid for as much as he could
eat. The rich man would have given
anything to possess the poor one's ap
petite, and on giving vent to his
thought he learned that his guest had
eaten nothing for twenty-four hours.
That gave the provider of the feast an
idea, and he now eats but one meal a
day, and he says that he has recovered
his appetite.â Tit Bits.

Society Stirred to Action
Because Young Men
Won't Dance.
A Chaperon Takes a Young
Lady From the Co
. tillon.
Indignant D.imes Read the Riot
Act to Dainty Young
" Rovers."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, Feb. 21.
Oakland society has declared against
the "rovers" at the Saturday Evening;
Cotillon Club. This declaration has
created a sensation and resulted in the
riot act being read to the ballroom
ornaments, and also in one chaperon,
. a mother, taking her daughter from
â¢ the hall after expressing her indigna
l tion.
The trouble all. arose at the last
dance of the Cotillon. For some time
the chaperones have been quietly nurs- |
. Ing their wrath, caused by the laziness,
indifference or pride of Oakland's so- j
ciety young men. As is well known. |
when the german Is. concluded, th
young ladies and gentlemen are at lib
erty to dance with whom they please,
[ and it is owing to this fact that many
fof- the youths stand around the walls
waiting to be asked to dance." â To such
a point has this come, that several of j
:''[ the chaperones, including Mrs. H. C.
â â¢ raft, Mrs. Gorrill and Mrs. Belden, de
;â¢â¢* cided that it is time to call the young
'.' \rnen to order. This they have done
;â¢;..'â¢ iri no measured terms. At the last
:. . : .nee there were so many young ladies
.â¢;â  unnoticed that it was determined to
â¢'â .'â â  make an advance on the wall orna
â â  ..nients. Mrs. Taft led the way, and
V.' those young men heard more in two
;;i.; minutes than they could dream of in a
. week.
!':"â  -.-They had borne their distress and
I /'-'chagrin long enough and as a result
.; = v -.fiofflne little maiden sat out the even- j
jâ¢" Ing alone, as several have done on
K. â  '-every previous occasion.
I".;' Mrs. Charles McCoy of East Oaklanc
:â¢.':. was so annoyed at the stupidity, or
I--' : "'Â° rs e. of the young gentlemen, that she
~i.\ .took her daughter frcrm the ballroom
find went home. Others threatened to
lo the same, t>ut it is now believed that
tiiere will be no necessity for such ac
.tion.
The chaperones have been at a great
deal of trouble to lend their patronage
t'> these dances for the benefit of
younger society, and the mothers who
â nsign their daughters to their charge
are naturally anxious that the young
ladies should dance. If the cotillon is
to degenerate into an ordinary ball,
then there is no necessity to go to the
nse "f ball dress* and carriages,
in addition to subscriptions to the club.
Their grievance has been that the
voting ttt>ii arc ton exclusive, and if
they cannot dance with the special
girla on whom they aeign to smile
with favor, they will dance with no
others, but with glassy and marble
hearts and stony stares they pose like
statues in the corner, even though pret
ty girls may not be dancing, and may
very reasonably expect to- be asked by
. the ornaments.
It is believed, however, that the
plucky action of the cbaperones has
ended all this, and that henceforth the
li"Uim of the club will be â dance or get
uut.

WOMEN'S WAR
IS RENEWED
Mrs. Baldwin Issues a
Circular Asking for
Help.
Aid Wanted for Suffrage in
South Dakota and
Washington.
Some Local Workers Opposed to
Helping the National
Association.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 21.
Mrs. Isabel A. Baldwin, president of â 
the Alameda County Political Equality
Society, has issued a little circular ask-
Ing for money for the National Suf
frage Association, and there is a re
newal of the division of opinion among i
the suffragists of this county regard- ;
ing the value of the National Associa
tion to California.
Mrs. Baldwin's appeal says:
Oakland, Feb. 9, IS9B.
Dear Friend: The National Suffrage
Association has sent us an earnest appeal j
for assistance to enable them to carry on
their work during the coming year. Every
year the National Organization Commit
tee undertakes a vast amount of work.
Besides the large amount done at the
home office, it sends organizers and work- i
ers in every direction to arouse interest in <
ciew and unplowed fields, and to encour- i
and stimulate others. Each year;
greater demands are made upon the Na- j
tionaJ Association. In many States and j
Territories, where the women are Just
awakening to the importance of the !
movement, little bands of workers are j
calling for help, and the National Com
mittee tinds itself continually crippled by ,
the small amount of money it is obliged j
to \\..rk with. We must aid them, other- j
wise little work can.be done. Washington ;
and South Dakota have each an amend- '
ment pending to be voted upon in No
vember. They have suffered more there
than any other section, probably, from j
the hard times and have little to work .
with and are looking to the National As
sociation for aid.
Now, will you kindly give us a little I
help? fXo matter how small the sum, it i
will be gratefully received, and the money j
will be called for gladly by a member of
the society. Very sincerely.
ISABEL A. BALDWIN.
President Alameda County Political
Equality Society.
This has opened up the question that
resulted in a secession from th<j coun
ty society over a year agu.
Mrs. Baldwin and the board of offi
cers believe that the national society
is worthy of encouragement and de
serves help from California. Her cir
cular states the rest.
Mrs. Borland, who was an officer un
der the old board, is of the opinion that
the Eastern suffragists who came out
here in 1596 lost the cause to Califor
nia, and, on the whole, fared very well
financially and socially while they Avere
here.
"It is a peculiar fact," said Mrs.
Borland this afternoon, "that in the
sc-uthern part of the State where the
Eastern suffragists were not wanted
and where they did not go, suffrage
carried. In Alameda and San Francis- â 
co counties, where tjje ladies from the ;
East were lionized, suffrage was a fiat
failure. From this we argue that if the
Eastern people had come out here in- I
tending to help us, instead of dictate
and show us by inference that they
thought we did not know the tempera
ment of cur own people, they could be
of help to us. We believe that Cali
fornia women are the only women in
the world that will ever convert Call- j
fornia men to woman suffrage, and we
do not feel that we are under any debt
of gratitude to the National Associa
tion. As near as I can learn, it was the
Eastern suffragists who on a former oc
casion defeated suffrage in Washing
ton and South Dakota, and we do not
see why we should give money to help
them. Neither can we see that these
two States have had any harder times
than California.
"It is our opinion that if the next
campaign for suffrage is left to the
women of this State they will make a
far better job of it than those clever
ladies that were out here in the fall of
â¢96."

As the Oakland teams have won six
out of the ten games played thus far

OAKLAND SOLD OUT
Shamelessly Delivered Over by the Council
to the Water Companies.
A Barefaced and Arbitrary Schedule Forced Through by
the Majorityâ Termed an Outrage and
a Farce.
OAKLAND, Feb. 21.â The most bare
faced outrage ever perpetrated on the
people of Oakland by a majority of the
City Council was carried out to-night,
and it is now known why A. Fibusch
resigned last week and why a person
named E. W. Woodward was appoint
ed as his successor.
After five minutes' consideration by
a committee of three named by the wa
ter companies, through Councilman
Henneberry, the water rate of this city
was fixed by a resolution that will pro
vide an income of 12 per cent or over
on the cost of both the water compa
nies. The only bright spot in the Infa
mous transaction is that City Attorney
Dow declared before the vote was taken
that it would be clearly illegal, as it
would be a water rate fixed absolutely
without investigation, and would be
arbitrary. The plan was all carefully
thought out and planned, and the al
lied corporations which, it is now fully
believed, have combined had their men
on hand to see that the Councilmen,
whose votes they could depend upon,
did not fall down.
Councilman Henneberry started the
job by introducing a resolution fixing
water rates at figures his ignorance
of which showed clearly he had not
compiled himself. He said that he was
; satisfied that the water rates as fixed
I by the ordinance now in print did not
! allow sufficient income and was unjust.
I He then handed the clerk a resolution
which was a complete schedule, and
contained enough matter to occupy
several nights of consideration. The
members of the Council who had not
been informed qf what was to take
place were surprised. They were at a
loss for even a remark, as there is a
very carefully prepared ordinance now
in print that will come up for final pas
sage next Wednesday night.
Mr. Hennebery proceeded and said
that the matter was urgent, and moved
I that a committee of three be appointed
I to look over the ordinance and report
back at once to the Council. Mr. Hen
nebery, contrary even to precedent,
which leaves the naming of special
committees to the chair was provided
with the names of the committee whom
he would Ilk.- appointed. It consists of
Upton, Watkinson, and to the surprise
of all. Woodward, who to-night attend
1 ed his very first meeting of the Coun
' oil, and knew nothing whatever about
; the water nites.
This made no difference, however,
and a few minutes later the following
â  report was presented:
Your special committee on the
resolution fixing water rates hereby
favorably reports on same.
W. W ATKINSON,
E. W. WOODWARD.
I emphatically dissent.
M. W. UPTON.
The affair was so barefaced and far
cical that the five Councilmen who re
spected their positions were forced to
laugh.
When the report was read President
Pringle said: "Gentlemen of the Coun
cil, this thing is at once a farce and an
outrage. It is illegal, because no in
vostigationhas been taken on this
schedule, and no one knows what Is in
: it. The proper thing to do is to refer
it to its proper committee."
This brought Heitman to his- feet.
The matter had been so carefully
planned that Heitman was prepared to
prove that the resolution
had been brought before the house by
the appointment of tho special com
mittee, and must therefore take its
course. President Pringle ruled against
Heitman, who appealed from the chair,
; and then came the sensation of the
â¢ evening when Brosnahan discovered
MINERS' DAYS AT THE FAIR.
Very Attractive Features, Eiracii a Grand
Toflrnament of Streigtli ami 81.
To-day, to-morrow and Thursday have been set apart by the man
agement of the Mining Fair as miners' days, and for these days fea
tures of especial interest have been provided.
Hon. Jacob H. Neff. president of the California State Miners' Asso
ciation, will have charge of the arrangements for these special days,
and W. C. Ralston, the well-known mining operator, will superintend
the different sports and contests.
Governor Budd will be present this afternoon, and wiil make an ad
dress of welcome, as also will Mayor Phelan, Judge John R, Davis of
Amador and others, and President Dole of Hawaii will be a visitor to
morrow.
Arrangements have been made for excursions from all the mining
counties, and a very large attendance from those sections is assured.
One thousand beautiful sterling silver badges have been provided
for visiting miners and association members, and $1000 will be distrib
uted in prizes for the various contests.
The principal contests will be in the line of Cornish miners' wrest
ling and rock-drilling. The latter are divided into three classesâ single,
double and three-handed drilling. For these contests the most noted
experts on the Coast are entered. The first feature in this line will
occur at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon, consisting of a three-handed drill
ing contest, in which Kitte, Dingle and Page are matched against Lar
kin and Pat and James Feeney. The struggle lasts fifteen minutes,
and the drilling will be in granite. â 
At 8 30 o'clock this evening will occur the first bout of the Cornish
miners' wrestling-a most exciting form of athletic sport. These wrest
ling and drilling contests will be prominent features each afternoon
and evening during these three days.
The wrestlers entered, with their weights, are as follows: J. Jef
ford Santa Clara, 197: Fred Trebilcox, Grass Valley, 21u; Thomas
Whalen Grass Valey, 171: Fred Webster, Randsburg, 187%; James
Rodda 'Grass Valley. 156^; Charles Hoskins, Amador, 160; Oliver Phll
lins Nevada City. 14S; unknown, New Albuquerque. 164. The Judges for
these wrestling matches are Eugene Van Court and David Pulkinham,
and the referee is George S. Miehling of the Olymp'c Club.
These contests will all be full of excitement and will be greatly en
joyed by all admirers of manly skill and strength.
Bible for Dr. Pardee.
OAKLAND, Fob. 21.-Dr. George C.
>ardee will spend the next two days in
electing the articles of his late father's
lousohold which haw not yet been dis
ributcd under the will and which he
laims are his, and carting them away,
'he balance will be left at the storehouse
or his father's widov.-. This was agreed
0 just before the court adjourned to
ilght. and was sanctioned by It. The
aa llxtures, statuary and pictures weâ¢
warded. Mrs. Pardee this afternoon, and
"he had made a mistake" and voted
against the chair.
President Pringle then denounced the
outrage from the chair and used very
strong language. Councilman Rowe
also made a speech, which every per
son who pays water rates will read
with interest. He said:
Gentlemen, I am dumfounded. I can
not express myself. I know perfectly well
that nothing that I can say will Influence
any vote In this Council because it is all
out and dried, and I can clearly see that
this infamy has been carefully planned.
I cannot understand how gentlemen elect
ed by the people can come here and act
like this. Here Is a schedule whose con
tents no one knows. It comes from the
allied water companies, and yet at a mo
ment's notice it can secure a bare ma
jority of the vote of this Council. I am
at a loss to say what I think. I cannot
believe you are sane. There Is an ordi
nance in print which will come before
you next Wednesday which has been
carefully considered. We took testimony
for weeks and allowed rates that we
proved by the company's own figures
would allow them 6 r>er cent on their
plant and allow a margin of $38,000. The
resolution introduced here to-night is an
insult to this Council. No one knows,
or can know, what is in it unless they
have studied it before hand, and I am
sure from what little I have heard of it,
that it will give the companies not less
than 12 per cent upon the only plant that
can supply the whole city.
Here is a resolution prepared by men
who do not know what their plant is
worth, and yet we allowed them a good
interest on their property and they are
not satisfied.
Mr. Dingee came before us, and when
we asked for figures as to the value of
his plant he could not produce any. Al
though we gave him a week, and al
though he only started in the water busi
ness three years ago yet not a voucher
could be found or a book produced, all
destroyed. The only information we
could get as to the value of his plant was
that the old Piedmont Company was sold
to the Oakland company for $3,000,000 of
stock, $1,000,000 and he would not take an
oath that he spent $200,000 on his original
property. The same is true in principle of
the other company. Yet these companies
can come here and find six votes to pass
a schedule of their own making. I cannot
understand it and denounce it as the vil
est outrage of which I have ever heard
Councilman Brosnahan, who has al
ways opposed the company's demands
hitherto, and who was so frightened
three weeks ago that the companies
would in some way juggle with the
ordinance so as to defeat it and intro
duced a precautionary resolution,
thought differently to-night.
"I have been jollied on the street,"
he said, "and told that I am being car
ried along by the rest of the majority
till I am tired of it. I know that for
several years I have voted for water
rates that were too low, and to-night
I am going to make a change."
And Councilman Brosnahan changed.
The vote stood:
For the water companies â Wood
ward, Brosnahan, Henneberry, Earl,
Heitnxan and Watkinson.
For the people â Cuvellier, Girard,
Upton, Howe and Pringle.
As soon as the vote was announced
Mr. Girard was on his feet and said:
"Now our eyes are opened. When he
was appointed last week the new mem
ber (E. W. Woodward) stated in the
public print that he was for the oeonif*.
and had no strings on him. We now
see what people he meant. We can
now see why Mr. Woodward was ap
pointed."
The blunt speech of Mr. Girard
seemed to pain Woodward, for he
pleaded with the clan to stop "personal
remarks," but there was no necessity
for his doing so, for Mr. Girard said:
"I've finished: I've told all."
When the meeting was over City At
torney Dow said the proceeding was
clearly illegal, that he had advised the
Council before they vote.d of its illegal
ity, and if the case were taken to the
courts he would not attempt to defend
the outrage.
After the vote Woodward was asked
if he wished to defend his vote. "I
don't want to say anything," was his
only reply.

ticles will be distributed a week from to

THE TALENT
IN CLOVER
Favorites About Swept
the Board at Ingle
side Track.
Trolley Could Not Maintain
Her Speed, Finishing
Third.
Lord Marmion Won in a Romp.
Collins Scored Again in Easy
Fashion.
The card for the opening day at In
gleslde was a lierht one so far as the
number of entries were concerned, and
the crowd had a great day of it cashing
tickets. Every favorite with the ex
ception of Trolley went down the line
and the twenty-six bookies doing busi
ness in the ring were hnrd hit. As
tounding prices were lai.l against some
of the winners, due probably to a lack
of business and the ever-expected
"good break."
The rain left the track sloppy, but it
did not prove bothersome, for the best
horse won in nearly every instance. As
usuai on Monday the attendance was
only fair.
The defeat of Trolley at odds-on in
the final six-furlong run put quite a
crimp in the talent's winnings. Blar
ney Stone, with "Skeets" Martin in the
saddle, beat the barrier, and leading
throughout downed Prince Tyrant a
length at the wire. The favorite was
a poor third.
The two-year-olds were first to sport
silk, eight lining up in a four-furlong
spin. The Conveti colt, Formero, was
made a 7 to 5 favorite in the betting,
and though outrun the first part fin
ished strong at the end and won easily
from the Corrigan entry. Frank Ire
land. Thorpe, on Odd Eyes, in trying
his usual smart tactics at post, was
practically left.
The six-furlong event, with the
weights raised ten pounds above the
scale, looked a certainty for Lord
Marmion, but the play on the race was
so light that the books finally offered
4 to 5 against his chance. With Willie
Martin up. he skipped to the front
when the barrier was released and won
under a half dozen wraps. Mainstay
the second choice, was beaten out for
the place by Triumph.
The brown gelding. Collins, was
again ready money in the mile and a
furlong selling run. Two to one was
always obtainable about him in the
ring. Jones, who had the mount,
hustled Dr. Rowell's horse to the front,
and cutting out the running was eased
up at the finish five lengths in front of
Can t Dance, the third choice. Little
Cripple, with Conley in the saddle, se
cured show honors. Paul Pry couldn't
untrack himself.
A five-furlong scramble for maiden
three-year-olds replaced the declared
ofl fourth race. Ping, with Lonnie
Clayton up. looked a legitimate 1 to 3
chance, but the books laid 9 to 10
against him at post time. He led all
the way. winning hands down from the
second choice. Roulette Wheel. Joe
Levy ran into show.
Fashion Plate, with Thorpe up, had
the call in the betting on the seven
furlong purse affair. Harvey's mare
was headed for half the distance by
Won't Dance, when she assumed the
lead and found no difficulty in leading
Veragua past the judges by three
lengths. Tulare was a handy third.
Track Notes.
The $2000 California Oaks for three-year-old
fillies will be the feature of the card this
afternoon. The high class number of entries
should furnish one of the prettiest races of the
season.
Priigrammfr J>x? Langendorfer says the
souvenir score card to be sold to-day will be
the finest of Its kind ever issued. Joe never
(ices things In halves, and It will undoubtedly
lie a hummer.
The Incleside management and the Western
Tni.>n Telegraph Company could not reach an
understanding as to what matter should and
should not be sent over its lines from the track.
aX a result of which the company removed its
Instruments and no messages were sent to any
of the poolrooms.

SMITH TRIPLETS
WIN THE PRIZE
Three Sets of Twins Were
Also Exhibited at thte Baby
Show.
Jack and Rose Stewart Won the
Trophy for the Great Cake
Walk.
The cake walk at the Mining Fair last j
i night failed to prove the drawing card ,
! that it had been expected, and with
i two exceptions the walkers were very or- j
dinary in their efforts at the grotesque. <
i The judges awarded the cake to Jack ;
! and Martha Stewart. "Pink Shirt"
O'Brien and Retta Sears were second,
while Harry Mangles and Rosa Taylor, a ,
I diminutive couple, captured the third
i prize. ,
The chief feature of the day was the :
i baby show, which was held in the after
; noon. There was an unusually large ;
! crowd in attendance, and much interest
' was manifested. It is said that the hnest i
! lot of babies ever seen at any baby show
held in this city were on exhibition. The
triplets materialized this time, and easily
! captured the *20 gold piece offered by the
management. They were members of the
Smith family, and were girls. This beau
; tiful bunch of small females are named ,
1 Mary, Frances and Marguerite.
Over sixty mothers were present with :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1898.
A RULE AGAINST
THE DIVORCED
Discussion by Presbyte
rian Ministers of Its
Advisability.
Mrs. P. D. Brown Suggests a
New Law for the Pastors
of That Denomination.
The Doings at the Many Weekly
Meetings Yesterday of the
Local Clergy.
There was considerable excitement in
theÂ»Presbyterian ministers' meeting yes
terday when Mr 9. P. D. Brown of the
Occidental Board addressed the as
sembled clergy on the subject of di
vorce.
She stated that there was a law in
this State which forbade people who
had been divorced for less than a year
from marrying again within that time.
Nevertheless she said this law was
evaded and many people went to sea
and had the ceremony performed. She
suggested to the ministers to form a
rule by which all the Presbyterian min
isters would bind themselves not to
marry any divorced person whose de
cree was less than a year old.
This remark started a debate, many
of the ministers contending that if the
County Clerk issued the license it was
no business of theirs, while others said
they would not marry a couple di
vorced less than a year for all the
money in the United States.
One gentleman stated that if a min
ister refused to marry a couple after
they had procured a license he was lia
ble to get into trouble.
A suggestion was made that it would
be well if a law were passed in the
church in this State similar to one in
New York, declaring all couples must
be closely questioned before the cere
mony is performed.
There was no decision at yesterday's
meeting, but the ministers decided to
take the question up again.
Elder Cornell read a paper before the
same denomination, and in it he ad
vised the clergy to discontinue read
ing their sermons.
"You never saw," he said, "a success
ful lawyer standing before a jury read
ing his argument, did you? Rather he
is standing before them looking square
ly in their faces and pleading his cause
with an earnestness that cannot be
mistaken. Your auditors can hear if
you face them squarely and will be
more impressed if you look into their
eyes occasionally."
The Methodist ministers listened to
an interesting paper on "Socialism" by
Dr. Bovier, who showed where social
ism had been the cause of much strife
in the world. He said: "In looking
back over the march of events as traced
in the world of God we find many dif
ferent forms of government, but we
find none that conforms essentially
to a system of socialism." He then
went on to tell how the Franco-
Prussian war was caused by socialistic
theories or principles.
Dr. Dille spoke before the Christian
ministers on Methodism.
The Congregational ministers held
their regular meting, as did also the
Baptist clergy.

EXAMINER DESECRATES CRAVES OF MARTYRED HEROES
Calmly Robs tie Widows and Orphans of Bead Firemen of Charity Funds and Seizes a National
Calamity as an Occasion to Advertise the Alleged Patriotism of Hearst.
The Superior Court has been
called upon l>> the infant son
ot'a bra-re fireman who died at
his post of duty to compel the
San Francisco Examiner to
disgorge funds which it col
lected for him.
The funds were obtained
from the public under the false
and fraudulent representation
that they would be siren to the
families of the dead firemen
-without delay.
Ilislu months have passed
since the agents of W. K.
Hearst collected S7OOO, but the
w idows and the fatherless have
not seen si cent of the money
which the deluded contribu
tors pave to the newspsi per con
fidence tuen on Hission street.
"Weary of poverty and dls
conrujred after fruitless ap
peals for even a part of the
fluids sog-eiieroii*lj- donated by
the .sympathetic public, the
principal mifiVrrr haw conclud
ed to inuke a test suit, The
newspaper sliell-eranie artists
will lÂ»e compelled to explain
their shameful conduct in n
court justice.
Thomas E. Hallinan, infant son of
Timothy Hallinan, the heroic fireman
â who perished at his post of duty on
June 6, has sued W. R. Hearst for
$23r:3 33, being funds collected by the
yellow journal on Mission street from
the public, as the Examiner stated, "to
aid the families of the three brave men
who suffered death to perform their
duty."
The money was donated under the
statement of the paper that the family
was in pressing need of funds.
The sum asked for by the minor, on
complaint of Edward J. Linder, his
guardian, is what would be his share
of the 17000 donated by the public for
the instant relief of the families of
John Moboly, Timothy Hallinan and
Frank Keller, all of whom died at their
posts.
If the infant now fighting the news
paper millionaire should win his suit
a large part of the money contributed
by the public in good faith, under the
belief that the Examiner would be
honest and prompt in disbursing the
charity fund, will have to go to the
attorneys who have charge of the suit.
Immediately after the fire the news- \
paper which makes haste to advertise !
Itself by shedding crocodile tears and i
sending subscription agents to the j
grave of every person that dies under j
pathetic circumstances, appealed to
the public in a hurrah way for imme
diate contributions to save the be
reaved families of the dead from destl â¢
tution and to pay funeral expenses of
the dead.
After eight months of quibbling the
unfortunate widow of Tim Hallinan
has been obliged to have a guardian
appointed for her babe, so he can lay
claim to his share of a fund that the
misguided public expected would reach
the sufferers soon after it went to the
coffers of the Mission street boodler.
In the fables that children read there
is a story of a selfish monkey that was

FALLING HAIR
appealed to in a case where two cats
quarreled about a piece of cheese. The
monkey settled the case by eating the
cheese.
The gross failure of the yellow jour
nal on Mission street to fulfill the let
ter and the spirit of the trust imposed
upon it by the sympathetic public is a
striking illustration of the folly of en
trusting affairs of grave importance to
a dishonest monkey. The result in the
case of the unfortunate firemen who
perished at their posts last June illus
trates how justice may go astray when
matters of charity are left to time
servers and tricksters rather than to
honest persons of sober business judg
ment. Again the Examiner has bun
koed the public and defrauded the
weak and the defenseless.
Believing that the money donated
would go to the immediate relief of the
families of the firemen who perished,
the impulsive public gave the Exami-

ncr the sum of $7000. Not one person
in the entire number of the contribu
tors thought for one moment that the
donations were to be withheld in so
! shameful a manner from those for
whom the money was intended. The
question now uppermost in the minds
cf the contributors is how the coin has
| been used by the newspaper. How
{ much of the voluntary donation has
j been retained by the fakers as com
i mission, and how large a sinking fund
i have the yellow Journal's agents re
( talned to cover exorbitmt advertising
! bills, as was the case when baseball
i funds were Juggled by the same unholy
; tribe?
Beginning on June 7 the Examiner
printed hysterical appeals rfor aid. In
its issue of June 8, preceding the list
of contributions for the families of the
deceased, the following spurring re
quest was made:
â¢* Appeal if* made to all who
honor heroic deed* to Join in
frvrelfin? thin fund, which -will
sÂ«fforÂ«l timely aid to the
widowed and tbe fatherleÂ«Â»."
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBKUARY 22, 1898.
In the spirit of the old-fashioned ex
horter the appeal closed by asking,
"Who will be next?" In the light of
the present pathetic appeal of an infant
in distress it will probably be a long
time before the bunkoed public will
again trust its purse with a dealer in
gold bricks.
So it has come, after long months of
patience and privation, that the suf
ferers left by men who died like heroes
are In a worse condition than if the
Examiner had never polluted the coin
which willing hands would have
given to the distressed without delay.
Why did the newspaper appoint itself
trustee for the public and cling to the
funds with the tenacity of a boodler?
This question will have to be an
swered In court.
Why did not the pretended philan
thropist deliver the people's money to
the sufferers without a day's delay?
That is another question which the
court will have to decide.
It is the opinion of Attorney McKen
na, who represents some of the other
defrauded sufferers, whose names ap
pear technically as defendants, that
the Examiner has grossly abused the
confidence of the public and shame
fully destroyed the purposes of the
gift.
When the Examiner induced the
public to surrender its money under
the representation that the entire
amount was for the immediate necessi
ties of the dead firemen's families it
became bound by the implied condi
tions of the trust, the terms of which
cannot be changed to the prejudice of
the beneficiaries. This is the reason
that there is nothing for the sufferers
to do but expose the bogus philan
thropist in court and show its shame
ful conduct to the world.
The mother of Edwin Hallinan, the
son of the deceased fireman, was seen
at her home on Eddy street
last evening. She stated that she had
done everything possible to obtain the
money donated by the people to the
Examiner for the families of the de
ceased firemen, but with no avail.
"I do not want a nickel of it myself,"
she said, "but I think that the money
should be paid over to my son now, and
not be put in trust until he reaches the
age of 21. I believe in sending him to
college now, as an education will be
valuable to him in after years. If he
knows that he is to fall in for a sum
of money when he reaches man's es
tate it may cause him a great deal of
harm. Then again if the money Is
placed in trust he may die and the
money will be given to the Fire De
partment. As long as neither the Ex
aminer nor the Fire Department
donated the money to my boy, but
the people, in their kindness of heart,
did. I think that he is rightfully en
titled to it. My brother has gone under
bonds to act as his guardian. He is of
the same opinion that the money
should be paid over now, as it can be
used to advantage. If we have to lose
every cent in trying to recover the
money given by the people we d6n't
care, for we will have the satisfaction
of knowing why the Examiner with
holds it."
Thomas E. Halllnan, although a boy
of tender years, remained from his bed
late last nightand brooded in his childish
way over the strange chapter that had
come into his life since the death of his
father beneath the crumbling walls of
the Standard Biscuit Company's fac
tory.
Knowing last night that the courts
had been called upon to give him his
rights, but not knowing the great pres
sure that would be brought to bear
against him to prevent him from gain
ing them, he immediately assumed that
in a few days wealth would be his and
many of his chfldish wishes would be
answered.
"I want the money to go to college,"
he said. "I don't want some one else to
keep it until I get older, because it will
do me more good now. If I get it I will
have my father's grave fixed up, as I
don't like to go out there now and look
upon it, as it looks so lonesome and
deserted. Father used to care for me
so much when he was living, and I care
so much for him that it makes me feel
strange, and I cry when his grave looks
like no one cared to remember him
now that he is dead. When he was
alive I used to visit him at the engine
house once a week and spend the day
with him. and now I miss him so much.
I hope to get the money my mamma
says belongs to me, as I want to fix up
father's grave and go to school that I
may be a smart man." Such is the
story of a child left fatherless by the
hand of adverse fate, and who now in
his youth and innocence is deprived of
the gold a charitable public chose that
he should have.
DEATH A YELLOW
CIRCULATION AGENT
WHILE the nation still mourns
its dead, some of whom sleep
on an alien and hostile shore
in graves which must ever be
nameless, some of whom
found rest in the deeps of Ha
vana harbor, the common heart yearn 3
to show in a meet and proper way the
pity it feels. The taking off of the
men of the Maine was a tragedy too
terrible, the shock too great to be
passed over with a tear and a word
of regret. Whether they were victims
of treachery or of accident the country
views them as martyrs, their memory
belongs to the whole people. The half
masted flags are in token of a wide
spread grief. '
Perhaps nothing could be more fit
ting than a shaft to mark the somber
event of their perishing. Such a mon
ument would have to be erected by the
free offerings of American citizens.
The country feels that the brave sac
rificed to the cruel exigency of peace
are as truly worthy as those who have
been called ""upon to yield their lives
amidst the tumult of war. These brave
men are not destined to be forgotten.
But nothing could be less fitting than
to have the monument reared, not to
the men whose titles it shall bear, but
to the greed and selfishness of an in
dividual who feeds and fattens on no
toriety, who is stirred by no generous
impulse, and who would as readily se
cure advertising through the destruc
tion of a ship and its crew as by print
ing the grotesque figure of a yellow
kid. It is hardly necessary to say the
individual is W. R. Hearst, that the
unclean sheet he conducts in New York
Is the instrument by which he is mak
ing his appeals, and that the other un
clean sheet, an echo and a shadow of
the filthy one on which he bestows a
greater affection, is doing all it can
to raise funds to perpetuate in marble
the Hearst belief that he is a patriot.
What does he care for the sailor
dead? Yet even had Hearst for once
been prompted by decent motives he
would have won applause and support,
albeit his haste demonstrated not that
he wished to have the memory of the
Maine's crew perpetuated, but rather
that he feared another would make the
suggestion and he be robbed of glory.
His motives, however, are apparent,
and they lack a redeeming quality.
The dispatch from Seattle shows the
scheme all divested of the glamour of
unselfishness. It is a cold-blooded
proposition to set a man collecting
funds and permit him to retain 10 per
cent for his trouble. By what right
does the proprietor of a paper so dis
reputable as to be barred from many
places where decency is regarded as
sume to pay 10 per cent or any sum
out of money given for a specific pur
pose, and money not his own? If a
citizen, touched by the pathos of the
case, anxious to express his grief at
the fate overtaking fellow citizens, sub
scribe $100 for a monument fund, he
does not expect that he is giving less
than that amount and donating the
difference to the agent of decadent
Journalism.
If a monument shall not be provided
by public act, at least let It be pro
vided by clean money, or not at all,
and not built from such funds as
Hearst may choose to allow to remain
after he has had a share to pay his
hireling. The arrogance of the Hearst
scheme is past all understanding when
considered apart from that person him
self. For him it seems natural, al
though the expllcitness and indelicacy
of its exposure is surprising even to
those familiar and disgusted with his
methods.
PERRY DROVE A "RINGER."
Ex-Senator W. J. Dunn has a fast
horse. Sid Perry has a horse that might
be fast if it had a chance to show itself.
A few days ago the two men were prats
ing the quality of their horses and each
man declared his animal was the better
for speed. The result was that a race was
arranged for a purse of $300 a side and It
took place Sunday afternoon at the speed
track at the Park.
The two men were for several days pre
vious to the race training their horses,
and as the day for the race drew near
Perry got a hunch that his animal was
not quite so speedy as Dunn's and he
stood a good chance of losing his $300. A
friend across the bay had a horse that
was a "ringer" for the one he was driv
ing, and it was an exceptionally speedy
horse. He borrowed his friend's trotter
on Saturday and yesterday Perry went
out to the track behind the borrowed ani
mal. Dunn was "there with his horse and
unconscious of the trick that Perry was
playing on him. Charles Newman was ap
pointed judge and the two animals were
started over the course.
The borrowed horse was perhaps the
faster and he got away well at the start,
but Perry did not understand how to drive
him. Soon after the start the animal
broke and Perry , was unable to get it
down to a trot again until about half the
course had been gone over. By that time
the ex-Senator was close to the finish and
he came out an easy winner. Perry wants
another race to decide the merits of the
animals and he says he will give bonds as
a guarantee that he will drive his own
horse.

ROBBED OF
HIS GOLD
BY A FRIEND
Isadore Degorski the
Victim of a " Boodle
Ringer."
Claimed He Owned Sev
eral Gold Mines in
Alaska.
Relieved of His Money While
on the Way to the Safe
Deposit Building.
CLEVER RUSE OF A CROOK
Old Iron Was Substituted for the
Coin of the Realm With
Success.
Isadore Degorski, a tailor doing bus
iness at 333 Eddy street, was cleverly
robbed of one thousand dollars last
Saturday afternoon. Degorski was
about leaving his place of business
when he was met by a notorious "boo
dle ringer," who Is known to the po
lice as "Joe" Blanchard. The latter
represented that he had just arrived
from the Klondike, where he had an
interest in several gold mines.
After a short conversation, during
which Blanchard depicted In glowing
colors the vast resources of the frozen
north, he exhibited a "dummy" roll,
which he claimed contained $21,000 in
greenbacks. Blanchard asserted that
he did not care to carry so much
money on his person, as he feared that
he might be stood up and robbed. Be
ing told of his victim's honesty he
asked him to take care of the "money."
Degorski innocently informed him that
he had $1000 in gold which he intended
to place in the bank.
"Don't trust any bank," remarked
the confidence man. "You will surely
lose your money if you do."
Blanchard then suggested that they
rent a box in the safe deposit, where he
claimed their money would be safe.
Degorski, thinking that Blanchard was
an "honorable gentleman," as he ex
pressed it, readily acquiesced. Blanch
ard then produced a sort of cash box,
and, placing his roll of "greenbacks" in
it, handed it to the unsuspecting tailor.
The latter, at the suggestion of Blanch
ard, also deposited his $1000 in gold in
the box. The two men then started for
the safe deposit to rent a box in which
was to be stored the money. The box
was duly deposited, and Degorski was
congratulating himself in having met
such a "nice gentleman," when he met
a friend, who was acquainted with the
methods of the "boodle ringer."
He told him he had been robbed, and
suggested to him to return to the safe
deposit and examine the box. To his
surprise he found that it contained a
number of "washers," such as are used
on garden hose, and a bundle of paper.
The gold belonging to the unsuspecting
tailor had been abstracted by his new
found friend while they were on the
way to the Safe Deposit building. After
realizing that he had been robbed De
gorski visited police headquarters and
reported the matter to Captain Bohen.
The latter at once detailed Detectives
Gibson, Wren, Reynolds and Dinan to
arrest- the clever boodle ringer, but de
spite their efforts, he is still at large.
They believe he hap left the city.
CHIEF LEES
ON THE CARPET
Accused of Failing to Per
form the Duties of
His Office.
His Attention Frequently Called
to Open Violations cf
the Law.
Attorney Regensburger, acting in be
half of a number of property owners in
the vicinity of Mason and Eddy and
Mason and Ellis streets, presented a
petition to the Board of Police Commis
sioners last night in which were em
braced charges of neglect of duty
against Chief Lees. The charge was to
the effect that the Chief of Police had
willfully and persistently refused and
declined to perform the duties of his
office in- closing certain disreputable
houses at Nos. 111. 113, 115 and 117
Mason- street.
Regensburger, in his petition, says a
number of citizens and taxpayers of
this city who own much of the prop
erty in the vicinity of the notorious
places notified the Chief of Police in
January last of the character of the
inmates of the houses. His attention
was called to their open violation of
the law, and he was asked to act in the
I matter.
Subsequently the Chief of Police
asked for a statement of facts concern
\ ing the character of the inmates of the
i houses. This was given, and it was
' shown to the Chief of Police that the
I statements could be proven, yet it is
said he refused to act.
The attorney, in his petition, says:
I have been put off by excuses from
time to time, and each and every time the
1 Chief made an excuse; such and all of
I said excuses were, to my mind, subter
i fuges, and on Friday, the 11th day of
j February, 1898, I was informed by the
said Chief that the Police Courts were
, overcrowded and that the Juuges would
', not issue warrants; and at the same time
j I was further informed by him that all
of his time was taken up by the charter
and that he could not attend to the
matter.
The following persons signed the peti
tion to the said Chief of Police to abate
the business carried on in those houses:
Mrs. Harriet McCarthy, Mrs. J. C. Mc-
Cauley, H. J. McCoy, John P. Gallagher,
! F. Nigro, C. G. Larsen, I. N. Kowalsky,
1 M. J. Somers, Claus Spreckels (by A. B.
i Spreckels), Ann Albreckt (by D. J.
I Oliver), Alexander W. Wilson. R. J.
Techau. Mrs. Ernestine Krelrfng and Mr.
Greenwald.
I charge that the actions of the said
Chief of Police are unwarranted and are
flagrant violations of his duties, and I
respectfully request, In submitting tnia
matter to you. that you set a^tlrne and
place for the hearing of this matter so
that I and my witnesses may ha\e an op
portunity to present the same to >ou.
The Commissioners held that the
statement presented to them regarding:
the character of the tenants of the
houses and the unsavory uses to wnlcn
the houses were being put were not
facts. Regensburger replied that ne
could prove the statements he made.
The Commissioners asked why the
Grand Jury had not been apprised of
the character of the places and why
that body had not taken the initiative.
The attorney replied that he had made
a complaint to that body, but he had
been referred to the Police Depart
ment.
The Commissioners, however, refused
to take any notice of the petition or
the charges it embodied and informed
Regensburger that if he would swear
to warrants charging the inmates,
lessees and owners of the property
with breaches of the law the warrants
would be served.
Regensburger said he had notified
the owners of the property of the
character of their tenants and they
had promised to remedy the violations
of the law. They have not done so as
yet and he proposes on Wednesday,
when the courts open, to swear to war
rants charging them as well as their
tenants with breaches of the law.
USED ALL THE
AMMUNITION
Many Gun Tests Made by Dr-
Shiels in the Figel
Case.
All of the Tes imony Given for th.
Defense Seems to Point to
Suicide.
"When the Figel case was reopened beÂ»
fore Judge Cook and jury yesterday
morning, Dr. George Franklin Shiels, a
â¢well-known medical expert, was called to
the stand for the defense. Much stress
seemed to be laid on his testimony
and the cross-examination was long and
thorough.
The witness testified as to his gradua
tion from various colleges and his experi
ence in this city, as well as in European
cities, regarding bullet wounds. The wit
ness stated in response to questions
asked by General Barnes for the defense
that he had experimented with a Smith
& Wesson revolver extensively. The wit
ness stated that the pistol found in tha
office of Hoffman, Rothchild & Co., on
the evening of June 1, was identical with
the one which he had used in experiments
on various bodies, and the witness fur
thermore stated that without doubt a
human being could Inflict upon himself
such wounds as were received by the de
ceased merchant, and that It was prob
able the wounds were self-inflicted. All
the testimony given by the witness tended
to prove the theory of suicide and the
testimony given seemed to carry much
weight, as the opinion of the witness has
j proved valuable on previous occasions.
