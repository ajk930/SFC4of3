THE BALDWIN HOTEL BLOCK
ENTIRELY GUTTED BY FIRE
Appalling Conflagration in the
Very Heart of the City.
CAPTAIN A. J. WHITE'S FEARFUL
DEATH.
Many Others Are Believed to Have Per
ished â Wild Scenes of
Panic.
The Baldwin Hotel is a ruin. The most tremendous conflagration that has ever happened in San Francisco burst forth in the Baldwin Hotel shortly j
after 3 o'clock this morning. From the very interior of the building a shaft of fire ascended with tremendous volume, and the sky burst forth into thou- .
sands of f falling sparks. I
Terrified inmates of the hotel rushed from the building and crash after crash was heard as explosives in the theater told the origin of the fire and j
| the imminent danger of those that were within the structure. The flames roared and twisted and mounted scores of feet above the building, and long before t
the firemen were at the scene the building was hopelessly lost. I
The tremendous fire, having its origin in the kit. hen, attacked what is known as the Baldwin annex, and then spread with inconceivable rapidity to- j
ward the Ellis street side of the Baldwin Hotel. In a very few minutes the firemen were at the scene, and on Ellis street they saw the figure of a woman .
outlined against the sky and the seething mass of crimson flames as she sought, almost a hundred feet above the ground, to escape with her life. |
The ladders of the firemen were placed with inconceivable rapidity gainst the side of the building. The shadowy figures of men mounted the ladders.'
The woman who was standing on the very verge of the tremendous fiery furnace was grasped in somebody's arms, while a thousand voices gave vent to aj
tremendous cheer as one life was saved from the building. j
While this incident attracted the attention of thousands on Ellis street glass was crashing, walls were falling, floors were tumbling and the boom of"
each resounding crash told of the crumbling of the great structure on Eddy and Market streets. Men and women were rushing from the building with J
what clothes they could gather and the hasty warning of approaching death and the waters of the engines were plying ineffectually upon the terrible j
furnaces that ate the heart out of the building. â¢
At fifteen minutes to five o'clock part of the two upper stories of the Baldwin Hotel crashed outward and a tremendous sheet of .flame descended to'
the street. j
The police had warned the thousands that had gathered around the building to retire to Powell street, and no one was injured In the crash. Flames,
burst forth from Powell and Ellis street, and at each moment it seemed as if the great cupola would crumble. I
Th cene as the side wall on the Powell-street ide of the building crashed to t-e ground was magnificent. A myriad of stars spangled into the air, I
and it seemed as if the very heavens were falling in sparks. From adjoining buildings stream after stream was poured upon the burning buildin-- but.
each jet of water seemed to add fury to the flames, and great masses of black smol:e arose to serve only as a background for new Jets of living fire that |
twisted an, turned and licked the superstructure until it crumbled and spread in "littering mas: s of flame on the streets. â 
There has never been in San Francisco a conflagration of such dramatic interest where the lives of so many men and women were involved and where '
so many escaped unscathed from a furnace that raged upward until the very sky itself seemed in flajnes.
It has come at last!
The Baldwin Hotel, which for years
been looked upon as a fire-trap, burst
into flames early this morning, and
is rapidly becoming a mass of charred
and blackened ruins.
It was a few minutes after 3 o'clock
this morning when the alarm came in,
and even as the bell clanged it out the
skies lit up with the flash of the burn- i
ing building. The fire started in the j
kitchen near the well between the hotel \
and theater, and springing upward, it |
was soon leaping high from the roof. J
It spread like the wind and from a
single torch like flare It ran along the
â¢walls until it was a sheet of flame.
The hotel alarm, a contrivance sup
posed to warn the sleeping guests of
their danger, was rung and rung again, j
but it needed all the assistance a j
score of attendants could give to rouse j
the inmates. They ran screaming up
and down the hall, kicking at rooms j
and yelling to the people to fly.
Within a few minutes the halls in â 
the upper floor were full of smoke, and
Into this the frightened guests plunged
and made for the stairway. Men half â 
dressed dragging Trantic women, j
screaming wives and shouting hus
bands, people bearing burdens of all
kinds and all with staring eye* and j
gaping mouths made for the stairway |
and flung themselves down.
Through the office they rushed, and
out into the street; but the flames fol
lowed them so fast they licked the
skirts of the Hying women and made
the men drop their last bundles in
their rush for safety.
Line 6of ho were hurried up the
Htairs, It the flames soon beat the
firemen back, and then the police
cleared the building, and they fought |
from the outside.
Higher and higher the flames leaped
until they enveloped the cupola on the
corners and hid the sky with their
Binoke â and then in the midst of it all
people began to crawl from the win
dows far up near the roof and scream
frantically for the fire escape.
The crowds groaned, and the men
rhouted and called to one another to
go up and save them, and the flames
reached for their victims until the peo
ple on the street turned their heads
away and waited.
Some women were seen on the Mar
kot-Btreet side, standing in a window
and screeching for help.
They were far above the reach of
ladders, and there seemed no hope un
til a man appeared beside them with
a rop^ and 'arted to let them down to
the firemen Just below him on the
fourth l >or. Five of them he lowered,
and these were all taken in through
The San Francisco Call
j the fourth floor corridors and down the
main stairway.
Then he fastened the rope for himself
; and commenced to descend. He was a
â  heavy man and the rope was small. It
stretched, snapped, and the man
plunged down to the stone sidewalk.
It was a guest of the hotel, A. J. White,
a well-known capitalist of this city.
1 He was dead before they raised him
| from the pavement.
It burned fler ->st toward the Powell
! street side, and coon the police began
Ito clear the strr-t. Then the engines
drew away and pulled the hose as far j
toward the corner as they could.
The wall was falling.
It had not moved, but it was only a
thin slfeet of flame, and as the crowds
stood breathless it began to totter.
It leaned already out toward the
: street, the sound of rending timbers
! rose above the roar of flames and wind
and throbbing engines, and then with
I a mighty crash it threw itself down
j into the street and lay heaped high in
' ruins.
On the Ellis- street side a man was
seen running along the cornice, wav-
I ing his hand to the crowd below and
trying to understand the frantic cries
the people below sent up to him.
He passed the fire-escape again and
! again, but it seemed as if he had com-
I pletely lost his head, and to save him
| Foreman Keogh of Truck 3 started up
the fire-escape, cheered by the crowd
and deluged with sparks and cinders.
But there were more cheers when he
made his way slowly down again with
the* half-crazed man with him.
The building burned from the Inside,
and the brilliant glare lit up the win
dows one by one as it crept downward
until every pane was a blaze of light,
! and every sach was wreathed in smoke.
Down the elevator shaft it came,
and the flames bursting through the
door on the office floor warned the last
loiterer in the office to be grone.
There was no attempt to save the
building after the fire had been fif
teen m' *es in control. It was a case
of saving adjoining property.
The theater was a mass of flare and
roar and leaping flames. In the annex
fire gleamed from every window and J
it seemed as If the whole block, from
Powell to the gore, was doomed.
There were 200 guests in the hotel
and scores of servants. They say they
all were warned and all got out, but
about the servants up on the upper
floor they are not so sure.
Every door accessible was wrecked
by those who ran through the halls, but
the rooms away up there were many,
and the fire raced like a hunted deer, j
so if there were any who did not hear j
tho cry Ood help them. j
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1898.
OUT OF SLEEP
TO FACE DEATH
Men, Women and Children
Join in a Mad Race
For Life.
A few minut after 3 o'clock this
morning fire broke out in the kitchen
| of the Baldwin Hotel on the easterly
end near where the main structure
I joins with the annex and spread with
i such frightful .pidity that the
I splendid structure, erected from the
winnings of the famous race horseman,
is now a mass of seething ruins and
other buildings in the vicinity are
complete wrecks.
The fire was first discovered by occu
pants of the upper floor, but those who
j should have sounded the ala.ro fled like
I frightened sheep, thinking only of their
own safety. In a few moments The
blaze had broken through the roof, and
as the lurid flare lit up the sky the cry
of "Fire, flre," was taken up alon>? the
street. Almost simultaneously an alarm
was sounded by one of the employes,
who fortunately kept his head, and a
wild scene began inside the structure.
Wild employes and wilder guests ran
shrieking through the corridors and
pulled terrified sleepers out of their
beds.
Men, women and children came
crushing and tumbling down the stairs
in mad haste â forgetful of one another
and thinking only of the red-tongued
demon pursuing them down the stairs.
Some were fully dressed â others par
tially dressedâ while all attempted to
carry something down in their arms,
and as is the usual case the articles
saved were those which might best
have been left behind.
Outside the howling, jostling mob
only added to the confusion. As soon
as a frightened face would appear at
a window a hundred Jumbled voices
shouted unintelligible instructions,
and the poor occupants of t rooms
Itnew not whither to turn. Meanwhile
the flames were gathering in volume,
and rapidly creeping down the elevator
and air shafts.
The Fire i >epnitir.ent gnon arrived
and two rmie alarms were hurriedly
turned in, bat the red flar* on the sky
told truer than words the doom of the
colossal stru ? - vi p.
Guest 9 were scrambling down flre
escapes and ladders to the accompani
ment of clinking glass and hoarse cries
from the sidewalks, frenzied wives were
searchii for missing husbands, and
fathers and mothers were trembling
over the fate of children 1 ' behind
during the flight.
Thanks to the able efforts of the flre
and police departments chaos was
turned into order and the work of
fighting the flames was soon begun.
WHEN THE FIRE
BROKE OUT
Panic Among the Guests.
Grave Fears That Those
on the Upper Floors
Could Not Escape.
Five minutes after the flre alarm
was given the scene In the office of the
hotel was one pandemonium. For some
reason the lights throughout the great
caravansary were extinguished, leaving
the guests to grope their way through
the long dark corridors and down the
winding stairs.
The result was that men, women and
children came tumbling d nvn into the
office in all conditions of habiliments.
Women, who had succeeded in don
ning their dresses had the strength to
reach the ground floor and then fainted.
Willing hands carried them to places of
safety.
One woman went into wildest hys
terics when she found that her little
boy was not with her. She became
senseless and was temporarily taken
into the barber-shop. A moment later
the child appeared, having been taktm
In charge by one of the guests.
The clerk, notwithstanding the tre
mendous excitement that surrounded
him, lent all the assistance and atten
tion to the police and firemen possible
and hurried messengers throughout the
big building to arouse any guests on
the floors, from the second to the fifth,
who might possibly have not been
awakened by the noise.
He expressed great anxiety for the
safety of people on the fifth floor,
from which the flames first burst. He
thought that the fire and smoke In the
corridors would shut off the escape of
many, and that the only hope lay In
the assistance of the hook and ladder
companies.
When asked where the flre started
he said he had not the remotest idea,
but thought that it must have begun
on the top floor.
A guest who came from the second
floor with an armful of clothes and two
hats on his head said that it started
in the parlors of the second floor and
from there spread until it reached the
elevator, where a fierce draft carried
the flames to the inflammable upper
story.
This cut off all possible escape for
guests by the elevators and at the same
time gave the flre a tremendous start.
Some of the people on the first floor
succeedc " in saving their trunks and
carried them to the 'doorways on the
opposite side of Market street, where
men, women and children were tempo
rarily camped until they gathered their
wits Buflficientl; to seek shelter else
where.
DROPPED FROM
THE THIRD STORY
A. J. White Falls to a
Horrible Death on the
Pavement.
The first fatality know to have oc
curred was the horrible death of a
wealthy, retired dry goods merchant
named A. J. White, who had his apart
ments on the fifth floor of the hotel on
the Market street side.
White it was who heroically liberated
the three young: women who were
penned in the cupola.
When he sought to make his own es
cape he founc. the egress below the
fifth floor cut off by the flames, and in
a last endeavor he sought the life rope
that dangled from the hall win
dows.
He reached the third floor and there,
while he dangled in midair, the thin
rope parted and he fell with a horrid
thud to the sidewalk. He was dead be
fore the firemen could pick him up.
The women whose lives White died
to save were Miss G. Johnson and Miss
K. Richardson, For fully half an hour
the women stood on the cornice of the
cupola while the flames and smoke
curled about them.
Just without their reach was the too
short ladder which truck 1 had raised
in the hope of saving them. Their wild
shrieks for help were drowned out by
the noise of the pumping engines, but
their frantic gestures expressed to the
anxious crowd the agony they were
undergoing.
Several times they seemed about to
jump in their frenzy, and at each mo
tion indicating that they were about to
leap to the ground, firei. 1 and spec
tators would lift their voices in cries of
warning and promise of help soon to
come.
A rope was finally secured. Brave
Mr. White volunteered to perform the
dangerous task of rescue and succeed
ed In his attempt, but paid for his brav
ery with his life.
Mr. and Mrs. Wagner had rooms on
the fifth floor on the Ellis-street side.
When they heard the alarm of flre
they sought to escape by the stairway,
but found their way barred by flames.
They found their way through the
smoke to a window, and from there
were rescued by means of a rope.
Frank Noon, a well-known man
about town, made his way to the sec
ond story and being unable to go far
ther, jumped from a window. He was
seriously bruised, but his injuries are
not dangerous.
White was formally employed by
Keane Bros., the old dry goods firm on
Kearny street. He was a trusted head
of a large department and remained
with the firm for a number of years.
He afterward started a business in his
own name opposite the house of his
former employers. This was in about
1885. He retired from business about
six years ago, and since that time he
has lived In ease, drawing upon the
fortune which his business netted him.
He is characterized as a man who
never felt a fear and on one occasion
before performed a service in which he
took his life in his o .*n hands. His
disposition was gentle and he pos
sessed all the traits which constitute
the true man. The courage and brav
ery displayed this morning is only proof
of his nobility.
NARROW ESCAPE
OF SOME GUESTS
Well-Known People Who
Were Almost Suffo
cated by the
Flames.
In the southwest corner of the fifth
floor, the servants' apartments, a dozen
men and women huddled together at
the windows, striving to keep away
from the suffocating smoke in a des
perate effort to preserve life for a few
moments longer, although there seemed
no hope of escape. There was no flre
escape within reach and the longest
ladders were too short by far.
Tom Walton, captain of Engine 6,
valiantly climbed up and by means of
a rope rescued all he could see, but the
chances are that several sank to the
floor from exhaustion before their res
cue could be effected.
C. R. Sabin lay sick on the top floor
and was carried down by E. A. Mona
han.
D. Weiler, a traveling man, who was
in room 444, escaped in his night
clothes, and Major Whitmore of the
Sixth California, who was in room 424,
also had a narrow escape.
Henry Frolich, a bookmaker at the
racetrack, and his wife, who were In
room 208 on the third floor, were driven
from their bed by the fierce burst of
smoke and flames. Escape by the hall
way was impossible and they jumped
from their window to a balcony sev
eral feet below and climbed down the
fire escape.
Sandy McNaughton, the well-known
horseman, occupied rooms 69 an 3 70 of
the annex. He escaped in his night- j
clothes just as the ceiling fell in and
loses $3000 worth of property.
* r . "\V. Freeman, manager of the Gay
Coney Islai.d Company, had a narrow
escape from room 210. He says that
Toma Hanlon, the leading lady. occu
pied a room on the top floor, and he
fears she is lost. It was afterward
learned that she had escaped.
BALDWIN AND
KOWALSKY SAFE
They Were Dragged Half-
Stupefied From Their
Rooms.
Colonel Kowalsky was asleep in his
rooms and was with great difficulty
awakened. His door was locked and
the rescuers were obliged to break it
in. He was found in his bed breath
ing heavily and half stupefied, but
soon revived when brought to the air.
All the splendid paintings and costly
furniture and hangings of his rooms
are a total loss.
"Lucky" Baldwin also had a narrow
escape from perishing with his splen
did building. Amid all the din he slept
peacefully until his room was broken
into and he was drapsred from his bed.
Truly his "luck" was with him then,
as few of the inmates were thoughtful
enough to smash in a door for the re
li f fa fellow occupant.
PANIC REIGNED
IN THE VICINITY
Denizens of Adjacent Lodg
ing Houses Rushed to
the Streets in
Deshabille.
The entire scene about the streets
surrounding the hotel was something
never seen In San Francisco before.
Ellis street, from Powell to Stockton,
was visited by a shower of living fire
I with chunks of burnt wood which had
been carried skyward by the force of
the flames until thrown back to the
earth, striking the pavements and
spreading out in a mass of fire, until
the street looked as if it had been
paved with bricks of flre.
When the electric lights went out
in the hotel the confusion became a
panic. Guests ran through the hall
ways, running against each other,
sometimes throwing the weaker body
down and invariably walking over the
prostrate forrr
Police officers could be seen running
along the streets carrying valises and
bundles which had been thrown from
the windows by half-crazed guests, who
had evidently despaired ft saving their
effects.
From the numerous lodging houses
in the tenderloin about the hotel
women rushed out on the sidewalk In
anything but street promenading cos
tume.
GALLANT DEED
OF A TRUCKMAN
One Guest Prepared to Cut
His Throat to Avoid
Incineration.
One of the most thrilling incidents of
the catastrophe was the extremely nar
row escape of A. H. Christie, one of the
! guests of the hotel, from th? horrible
fate of being incinerated while in the
full flush of health.
For fully fifteen minutes, in full
view of the terror-stricken multi
tude down below, on Eddy street, he
i crawled, or ther dragged h.mself,
hither and thither along the edge of the
| roof of the hds elry, in a vain effort to
! find some avenue of safety to the
thoroughfare, eighty feet beneath.
During all thiÃ time futile shouting
was being done by nearly every one
who was a witness to the scene. He
I was on the Ellis street side, about
i twenty feet from the corner of Powell.
Just below, but with its highest point
at least fifteen feet beyond his reach,
was a fire escape ladder. Firemen
scaled this and endeavored to throw
him a rope's end, but without even a
faint approach to success.
After a quarter of an hour had been
thus spent, E. H. Kehoe of Truck No.
3 thought of the fire escape near the
eastern end of the structure, also on
the Ellis-street side.
He rapidly ran to the top of it, which
was within a foot or two of the roof,
ran westward along the roof, took hold
of Christie and led him back to the fire
escape and *to safety, amid the cheers
of the throng of spectators.
While in his precarious perch,
threatened momentarily by death In
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the fiery caldron that was seething and
roaring Just a few feet below him,
Christie made a thrilling picture,
silhouetted against the flames and wild
ly and pleadingly waving his hands to
those below.
Of death in the abstract he had no
fear, but he declared that he had de
termined to escape the torture of. being
burned to death.
"That fifteen minutes on the edge of
that roof were the longest I or any oth
er man ever lived," he remarked, when
interviewed after his rescue. "I gave
myself up for lost several times. Once
or twice I was nearly overcome by the
smoke. I had an open razor in my
hand, which I had the precaution to
take when I was driven out of my
room by the smoke."
"What did you expect to do with the
razor?" he was asked.
"What do you support? To finish my
self, of course. If I saw that I was a
goner. You don't think that I wanted
to be roasted in the furnace."
He added that he had occupied room
514 on the fifth floor of the hotel.
He was awakened by the Bmoke pour
ing into his apartment. All the ordi
nary avenues of escape were then cut
off, so he made his way to the roof,
with the result described.
He is a traveler for the Milwaukee
firm of Abel & Bach,, manufacturers
of trunks and valises. Â.Â«_.
FIRED THREE
SHOTS AT THEM
Bold Thieves Attempt to
Get Away With a Val
uable Trunk.
During: the progress of the fire three
thieves entered the hotel and stole a
trunk containing considerable jewelry
and wearing apparel. They succeeded
in passing the police line and started
up Powell street. On reaching O'Far
rell street the desperate thieves stopped
as If exhuasted from their heavy load.
Special Officer Judge happened along
at this juncture, and suspecting that
the men had stolen the trunk, awaited
developments.
In a few minutes they again picked
up the trunk and hurriedly walked up
O'Farrell street.
Judge lost no time In notifying Po
liceman Harry Hook, who was stand
ing at Ellis and Powell streets, and to
gether they started after the thieves.
As they ran up O'Farrell street they
saw the men engaged in breaking open
the trunk.
Catching a glimpse of Hook thÂ»
thieves ran away. Hook, who is one
of the crack shots of the department,
called upon them to stop, and as they
paid no heed to his command, he drew
his pistol and fired three shots at them.
One of the men was seen to stagger
and it is believed that Hook succeeded
in winging him.
The officer being anxi >us to return to
the scene of the disastrous fire did not
pursue the thieves, evidently satisfied
to recover the stolen trunk.
Subsequently it was conveyed to the
Golden West Hotel, where it will be
held until the owner calls for it. The
owner is an agent for an Eastern jew
elry house, and it is said that the
trunk contains a miscellaneous assort
ment of diamonds and jewelry.
The thieves were evidently aware of
this fact, and in the excitement due
to the fire managed to get away with
the trunk.
A CHAMBERMAID
BELIEVED LOST
Fire Marshal Towe Hit by
a Falling Cornice on
Market Street.
Sadie Hart, a chambermaid, has not
been seen since she went to bed early
In the evening, and is believed to be
lost.
Miss Herrold and Mrs. Sharpe who
occupied rooms on the first floor were
carried out unconscious and taken to
the Lion Pharmacy.
A young lad" and intimate friend of
Baldwin's was also rescued in a faint
ing condition from a first floor room.
Shortly after 5 o'clock a cornice fell
and struck Fire Marshal Towe on the
head, knocking him down in front of
Engine 1 which was lumbering ud the
street. The extent of his Injuries in not
known.
NO INSURANCE
ON BUILDING
At 5 o'clock the walls were tottering
and the policemen were ineffectually
struggling to keep the crowd back.
"Lucky" Baldwin was racing around
like a madman trying to find some one
who would go into his room and bring
out somethingâ what it was he would

set of gold mounted harness valued at
$7000.

SHARKEY GETS
DECISION IN THE
NINTH ROUND
S MAR KEY
Referee J^elly, Scerjting Fraud, Declares Â£JII Bets
Off--Sailor Has the Better of the Figbt
prom Start to Finish.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22. â "Sharkey wins; referee declares all bets off.'*
That was the startling announcement made to-night in the Lenox Athletic Club..
where more than $50,000 was spent by the public to see a twenty-round fight between
lames J. Corbett and Thomas J. Sharkey. Nearly 10,000 persons who heard the decision
groaned and hissed, raged and fumed, called the men in the ring hard names and then
went, swearing, out into the rain.
Corbett lost because Con McYey, his sparring partner, who was one of his seconds, entered
the ring about the middle of the ninth round, when the fighters were hugging each other in a
clinch. Policemen and others tried to stop him. The crowd saw him climbing desperately
through the ropes, screamed '"Foul!" and demanded that he desist. He went on, exclaiming to
"'Honest John Kelly, the referee:
"Why don't you get them apart?"
Corbett saw him after a second and knew that his fight was gone. His temper got to fever
heat in a trice and in the clinch he struck Sharkey again and again, and Kelly had a difficult job to
get the men away from each other.
Referee Kelly told The Call correspondent later that he believed in his heart that the inter
ruption was a prearranged affair in Corbett's corner, and the reason he declared bets off was that he
could not stand by and see the public robbed.
Meanwhile thousands of throats were bellowing out denunciations. More than a thousand
shouted "Fake!" and fully as many yelled that Corbett was growing weak and could not win, and
was saved the humiliation of a knockout by the unwarranted action of McVey, who has been in and
around the prize ring for years, and know r s that a second who enters the ring during a fight loses
the battle for his principal.
Corbett was not his old self in any of
the rounds, and a half dozen times his
tottering knees, heaving chest, half
power blows and feeble swings led the
crowd to believe that the beginning of
his end was near. He rallied as many
times as these signs were seen, but not
to the full strength of the days when
he won his championship.
From the time when the men shook
hands and the impatient thousands
cried "Fight!" Sharkey proved himself
a surprise. "When he stripped to his
breech clout there was a burst of ap
plause in admiration of his splendid
muscles. But still he looked heavy,
lumbering, slow, but the same hard
hitting fighter that people here found
him before. In contrast with Corbett,
sitting smiling in the opposite comer,
lithe and o:newy, he looked as does a
bull in the presence of a leopard. If he
could hit he might win.
That was the opinion of three-quar
ters of the spectators. Even those wh
had their money on the sailor counte.
on that one piledriving blow to win. I:
Sharkey could hit Corbett once, they
said, ne could get at him again and
drive him to sleep with muscle. Shar
key did hit Corbett that onee â a fright
tui blow, near the spot made famous b;
Fitzsimmons. Then he hit Corbet
again and again. He had science, too
the very thing the least of which w i,
expected. And, stranger still, his au
vancement in the knowledge of how t<
use his fists, both for protection an>.:
aggression, was so great that even Cor
bett did not show himself his superio:
in skill.
Sharkey was not so quick on his feet
as was the former champion, but he
stood in close at every opportunity,
took what little punishment was lightly
given him and replied with sledge
hammer force.
Corbett's ring tactics for a while were
his old onesâ hit and get away â but the
sailor was determined on close quarters
and insisted on having them. He tried
jabbing for a time to worry Sharkey
into a rage that might mean a foul, but
Sharkey's temper was under curb and

revenge. He sent Corbett to the floor
early in the second round, met him
when he arose with terrible punish- j

Around the ring there were shouts of j
triumph and disgust. Staid lawyers

groaned in disgust. There were physi

muster, but a second blow made him
totter, and again it looked as if Shar
key might finish him soon.
"Hit him low," cried Tom O'Rourke,
manager of the club, who was one of
Sharkey's handlers.
This advice coming from the man
ager of the club, who would not tolerate
such action in anybody else, angered
a Corbett sympathizer in the crowd. He
offered to b:t O'Rourke $1000 and there
by caused him to be si'ent.
In the fourt' 1 round Sharkey's new
science came splendidly into evidence,

DESCRIPTION OF THE
FIGHT BY ROUNDS
"EW YORK, Nov. 22. â The technical story of the Corbett Shar
key fight by rounds follows:
SHARKEY THE AGGRESSOR.
ROUND IâThe1 â The men fiddled for several seconds and Jim made a
left lead for the head. Tom responded with left and right in the
same spot. Corbett led again. Tom responded with a left swing for
the head, which landed. Sharkey ripped in left and right for the
body, with some effect. He kept forcing Jim into the various cor
ners, punching with right and left on the body, which seemed to be
his objective point. Jim feinted and tried to draw his man on. Shar
key was always ready with his left jab and right swing, which in
variably landed on the body. Corbett failed to show any of the great
cleverness with which he has been credited. The round ended with
Sharkey at his man.
SAILOR FLOORS H*S MAN.
ROUND 2 â Corbett with the left landed lightly. Then there was
an exchange of lefts and rights on the head in which Sharkey had
the advantage. Jim kept trying to push his left into Tom's face and
the sailor would come right back with a swing for the body. Tom
was inclined to be a trifle wild, and was frequently cautioned by
O'Rourke, his chief second. Tom put out a straight right on Jim's
nose, which seemed to bring the blood to that member. Sharkey put
In a right-hand smash on the jaw which sent Corbett down. He at
tempted to repeat the dose, but was foiled, Â£â¢ Jim clinched. The
round closed with Tom all pver his man.
SHARKEY COUNTERS WELL.
ROUND 3â Corbett led with his right for the body, landing.
Sharkey responded in klnJ. Jim reached the body several times, but
Tom came right back with lefts for the head. A right on the body
staggered him. Sharkey whipped over a tremendous right-hand
smash on the jaw. The sailor's leads were Ineffective, his counters
being the blows which cut the figure. Corbett kept jabfbing lightly
for the head and Sharkey came right back at him with right-hand
smashes on the wind.
CORBETT LONDS A FEW.
ROUND 4 â The sailor was right after his mar. and es: -.yed lefts
and rights for the head, landing each time. Corbett clinched and
acted entirely on the defensive. Corbett led left for the head, land
ing on the neck, and Sharkey sent back a hard right on the body.
Corbett began then to do some punching and jabbed his man at will,
but at long range, but Tom always had a counter ready. Corbett
repeatedly led his left and damaged Sharkey * face considerably.
The sailor chased his opponent into the latter's corner and received
a series of jabs for his action.
JIM'S BLOWS LfICK STEfIM.
ROUND sâ Corbett started right off with a left jab on the face
and was apparently attempting to fool with his man. Sharkey, h)\v
ever, was not in a playful mood and brought his right hand over with
force enough to make Jim wince. Jim hooked his left rather low
on Tom's brdy and lifted Sharkey off his feet with his shoulder.
Corbett appeared to be a trifle weary and his blows lacked steam,
vhereas there was a %\ -Tld of force behind Sharkey's blows.
FIGHTING AT CLOSE RANGE.
ROUND 6 â Corbett reached the head with his left, but Sharkey
was right after him like a whirlwind. Tom started In to mix it up
and whipped in some corkers on the body. Corbett retaliated with
like light jabs on the face and fairly forceful blows on the body.
Midway through the round there was a rattling mix-up, both ex
changing lefts and rights on the head and body, with the sailor
having a shade the better of it. There were cries of "Foul, foul,"
when Corbett hit his man in a breakaway which the referee had
not called. The men were clinched at the bell, after participating
in a very fast mix-up.
TOM DOES ALL THE LANDING.
ROUND 7 â Sharkey ran across the ring and planted left and
right on the head, Corbett clinching. Corbett acted on the defens
ive and seemed unable to withstand Sharkey's rushes. The latter
wW In a beautiful left hook on the wind and followed It up
with a right on the jaw. The sailor kept doing all the work and
was always ready *to mix It up on the slightest provocation. He al
ternately^ threw over left and right' on head and body, occasionally
changlng to left hooks on the wind, which were slowly but surely
attending to Corbett'3 case. It was Sharkey's fight so far. The pace
was terrific. T
SHARKEY DAZED BY A BLOW.
ROUND BâSharkey8 â Sharkey was first to lead, landing a left chop on the
neck. They clinched frequently and the referee vas kept busy sepa
rating them. Tom tried a left chop blow whicl. fell short and Jim
jabbed his left hard on the nose. Sharkey sent a right straight on
the face, which made Jim's head rock, but Jim was ready with a
left hoik, which grazed Sharkey's face. Both men fought fast,
clinching repeatedly. Jim hooked his right hard on Tom's jaw, half
dazing him. He quickly recuperated and went back at his man
hami Â»Â»r and tongs.
McVEY'S PREMEDITATED f?CT.
ROUND 9 â Corbett landed with his left. Ton. went right back
at the same moment Clinches were frequent and the men refused to
break together. Corbett then struck Tom rather low on the body
and the sailor appealed to the referee. Corbett shoved Tom from
him and said: "Oh, you go away." The men were In the center
of the ring mixing it up In the liveliest manner, O'Rourke calling to
Tom not to mind Corbett's low hitting.
Just at this moment, for some unaccountable reason, McVey, one
of Corbett's seconds, jumped through the ropes, protesting that Shar
key had done something wrong to Corbett. The moment McVey
climbed through the ropes Inspector McLaughlin grabbed hold of
him, while he crowd frantically yelled:
"Foul, foul!"
"Crbett loses! Look at his second in the ring!"
Referee Kelly seemed to pay no attention to the matter, but kept
looking at th^ fighters, who continued their aggressive work. Mc-
Vey tried to pull away from the inspector, while the spectators kept
yelling at the referee, who finally separated the fighters and ordered
them to their corners. Corbett seemed not to understand why the
referee should interfere and protested, but Kelly was obdurate and
stopped It.
Meanwhile the spectators stood up and yelled that bets should
be declared off, as they believed McVey committed a breach of ring
rules premeditatedly. It looked for a while as if a riot would ensue,
but as soon as the referee declared Sharkey the winner on the tech
nicality he announced all bets off, as McVey's action was undoubt
edly prea; anged. As soon as this announcement was made the spec
tators resumed their seats and awaited the departure of the men from
the ring.
SHARKEY WILLING TO
FIGHT HIM AGAIN
NEW YORK. NÂ°tf- 22.â SharRey, who was as
happy as a schoolboy after his victory, said :
'' 1 .could have goQe on for a hundred rounds, and
was just commencing to get to myself when that
fellow caused the fight to be stopped. Of course I
won, but I would rather it had been on other than
technical grounds, fit that time I would have at
tended to Corbett's case, as his blows had not steam
enough to feaze me. Yes, I'll meet him again at any
time or place, and now stand reody to do battle for
world's champioQship honors, which are all n)ine, in
the heavyweight class .at least.",.
"HONEST JOHN" KELLY,
Referee of the SharKey-Corbett Fight.
CORBETT SAYS HE
WOULD HAVE WON
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Corbett has this
to say regarding his defeat:
"If that unfortunate action of McVey j
had not brought on defeat I would surely
have won. Before commencing what
proved to be the last round I remarked
to Charlie White that I was all right and
in decidedly good fettle, ready and willing
to go a long journey. The sailor could not
whip me in a week."
made Sharkey's great bulk shiver. Clinch
after clinch came in the eighth and
ninth, and at last the one that was the
indirect cause of Corbett's loss.
When McVey got into the ring pande
monium biuke loose, and whether there
was or was not a foul to cause his ac
tion, foul followed foul thereafter. Mc-
Vey was dragged out by Inspector Mc-
Laughlin.
"Put-up job!" yelled the chorus at the
ringside.
"Fake!" came the reply from another
crowd.
"He did it to save Corbett!" was an
other shout.
Then when the referee declared that
all be .3 were off there was a bedlam
of fierce epithets: hisses drowned the
voice of the official announcer. The
crowd seemed unable to move for won
der at the way Mo.Vey, himself a fight
er, had acted. At last 'hiy pulled them
selves together and began moving
noisily to the street. Men from San
Francisco jammed against Chicagoans
and helped them out with a vocabulary
of swear words. Men from Vermont
and Louisiana compared noisy notes
with Canadians and New York club
members, but r.bove the general din on
the way to the street the words "Fake"
and "Put-up Job" were heard above all
others.
The crowd was splendidly handled.
Chief of Police Devery himself was
there in command and Inspector Mc-
Laughlin helped him. Everybody was
seated quickly. The order was perfect,
even when the great strain came at the
end. In the streets thousands were
moved along quickly. They were so
anf-v at the ending of what might
have been a great battle that they hur
riedly quit the scene of the fiasco.
One of the humorous aspects of the
affair was the appearance of "Kid" Mc-
Coy, who had passed the doors dis
guised as a typical Westerner, with
long black beard and mustache, black
fedora hat and dark suit. He looked
the part of a bearded minister and at
tracted so much attention after he was
seated that the spectators almost guyed
him, until his little brown eyes showed
that he was not what he seemed, and
at last the secret was out that it was
"Kid" McCoy, whom Tom O'Rourke had
forbidden the courtesies of the club.
He occupied a box with some friends at
the ringside. He was not long seated
before the management of the club was
notified and a few special officers were
sent to request him to leave the house
peacefully and have his money return
ed. He had paid for a ticket. While
he was marching through the aisles
in advance of the officers there were a
few comments, but not many, as the
assemblage was more interested in the
contest that was going on than in Mc-
Coy, who acted very gentlemanly and
retired gracefully.
John Kelly gave his reasons for de
claring bets off as follows:
"There was no other course left open
for me. McVey has been seconding

25-27 Market St., S-F.PROFESSOR C. F. HOLDER'S PLOT TO RUIN
THE REPUTATION OF AL GERBERDING
The Editor Schemed an Alliance Be
tween the McDonalds and the
Railroad.
How One Tool of the Dishonest Bankers At
tacked a Man's Honor to Control the
Bank Commissioners.
Among the many men who surround
ed the McDonalds during the history of
the Pacific Bank and the People's
Home Savings Bank there were few
who so jeopardized their reputations by
their letters as did Professor C. F.
Holder, who occupied only the position
of editor of the Californian Illustrated
Magazine as far as the public had any
opportunity of judging. Professor
Holder, however, was not only the edi
tor of that magazine, but he was one
of the most trusted and one of the most
serviceable employes of the McDonalds
in many a shady transaction.
Professor Holder took upon himself
the duty of silencing any adverse criti
cism that might be attempted in the
daily papers of this city and of Oak
land. He concocted an elaborate
Bcheme by which Dick McDonald might
form an alliance with the Southern Pa.
cific Company either for political or j
financial purposes or for both. Profess- \
or Holder knew of Dick McDonald's
ambition to become Governor of the
State, and with a hope of pleasing his
master the professor did everything in
his power to advance ihat ambition
toward realization.
Professor Holder also knew that the
McDonalds were in deadly dread of the
interference of ex-Bank Commissioner
A. Gerberding. Gerberding was alto
gether too watchful to please the Mc-
Donalds, and his demand that the Pa- !
cific Bank and the People's Home Sav
ings Bank be placed in a solvent condi
tion gave birth to a plot to retire him
from his position as Bank Commission
er. As one of the conspirator? in this
plot Professor Holder went to Los An
geles to interview Governor Markham
and to ask him if he would retire Ger
berding in January, 1593. Governor
Markham, who was then the chief ex
ecutive of the State, declined to accede
to Holder's demands, and Holder sug
gested to Dick McDonald that they
concoct some scheme by which they
could ruin the reputation of Gerber
ding and, through attacks upon his
character, deprive him of his office, j
Holder suggested In this scheme that
the influence of Dan Burns might be
obtained. These facts are proved in
the handwriting of Professor Holder
himself. This man, who posed as the
dupe rather than as a confederate of
the McDonalds, went farther than most
of the other conspirators in his efforts
to assist his master. His letters are of
exceptional interest.
The Call also publishes this morning
some of the letters of O. T. Dyer, who
was manager of the defunct bank of
Riverside. In these letters Dyer makes
it very clear that there was a dishonest
understanding between TV. H. H. Hart,
who was then Attorney General, and
the Riverside Bank, the agreement be
ing made in the interest of the Pacific
Bank.
An outline of the letters of E. A. Da
vis and R. J. Davis is also given this
morning to illustrate how these men,
as agents of the McDonalds, operated
in their service.
PROFESSOR C. F. HOLDER IN A DU
BIOUS DOUBLE LIGHT.
Professor C. F. Holder is, therefore,
another of the agents of the Mc-
Donalds who is revealed in the se
cret history of the Pacific Bank
in a dubious light. Professor
Holder was the guiding spirit of the
Californian Illustrated Magazine, which
cost the depositors of the People's
Bank and the Pacific Bank something
over $60,000. The publication was
founded by Dick McDonald to gratify
his absurd egotism and to advance and
if possible satisfy his political ambi
tion. Dick had an insatiable desire to
be in the public mind.
It was his weakness to pnse when
ever and wherever he could, and the
Californian Illustrated Magazine be
came one of the instruments for this
posing. Professor Holder was chosen
as the editor and practical manager of
the concern. He had a score of women
for his assistants and was supposed to
present Dick in every possible position
that appealed to the young banker's
vanity. Dick's picture Illuminated the
pages of the magazine whenever an op
portunity could be found to use it.
Long articles signed by the young bank
er and written by impecunious literary
hacks filled the pages of the paper. Pro
fesor Holder guided the destinies of this
concern and enjoyed the admiration of
a select coterie of literary enthusiasts.
He was supposed to be acting solely In
the capacity of an editor, but his du
ties as a matter of fact were far more
complex and very much more question
able. Professor Holder used the Cali
fornian Illustrated Magazine to boom
the localities and the schemes in which
the Pacific Bank was interested either
as an investor or a speculator.
â¢ THE PROFESSOR UNDERTAKES TO SI
LENCE ADVERSE CRITICISM IN
THE NEWSPAPERS.
In fulfillment of his editorial duty
Professor Holder undertook the task of
silencing any adverse criticism that
might have been threatened by the
daily newspapers. Professor Holder
volunteered to pave the way for a
meeting between William H. Mills and
tJje Huntingtons and Dick McDonald.
This meeting the ingenuous and unso
phisticated professor declares would be
a preliminary step for a combination
between the McDonalds and the South
ern Pacific Company, in which the rail
road could be worked either politically
or financially to the advantage of the
McDonalds. Such letters as this
reveal Professor Holder in a new light
and perhaps may suggest a meaning
for his enormous note for $135,000. The
. professor was quite as valuable in his
j efforts to help Dick secure control of
I the local School Department and use it
i as a lever with which to move the Gov
ernor's chair. As an illustration of his
| influence with certain daily newspa-
p ers of this city and of Oakland Pro
fessor Holder on August 16, 1893, wrote
to his employer, R. H. McDonald Jr.,
as follows:
My Dear Sir: I visited the evening
papersâ Post. Report and Bulletinâ
and each promised to say nothing. I
will attend to the morning papers this
a. m., and have a good notice, if any
thing. I telephoned to the Oakland
Enquirer, and the editor regrets the
publication. Will take It back this
p. m. In answer to my demand for his
authority for the statement he said It
was the young man who represented
you in Oakland. Very truly yours,
C. F. HOLDER.
PLANNING A POLITICAL AND FINAN
CIAL ALLIANCE WITH THE
RAILROAD.
On September 5, 1892. Professor Hold
er wrote a very important letter in ref
erence to Collis P. Huntington, William
H. Mills and Southern Pacific interests.
The professor was emphatically of the
opinion that it would be wise for Dick
McDonald to secure the services of his
friend, Sheldon, of Los Angeles, and
make him a figurehead for a weekly
paper, the publication of which Dick
; had then under consideration. Holder
i made this suggestion with a belief that
| Sheldon was closely in touch with the
railroad officials, particularly W. H.
; Mills, and could be used as an instru-
I ment to bring about an alliance be
j tween the McDonalds and the railroad
people. Professor Holder's letter is a
significant document and shows the
public how very learned men sometimes
have time enough to familiarize them
selves with the devious paths of diplo
macy.
In opening this important letter Pro
fessor Holder was unlike a majority of
the men who surrounded the McDon
| aids. The learned man modestly re
quested X>ick to give him an extension
of time on his note. The letter is as
follows:
Sept. 6. 1892.
My Dear Sir: Will you kindly oblige
me by extending the time of payment
of my note for another thirty days? I
want to have a talk with you about
Sheldon. His wife called upon Mrs.
Holder the other day, and I gained
the Impression that she is not partic
ularly anxious that he should go to
Africa, and a note from Sheldon this
a. m. tells me that if anything turns
up in the meantime he will not go. In
brief, I think he would accept some
thing at moderate terms if offered now
or if he had a general idea when he
would be needed. I think Sheldon
would make a good figurehead for your
weekly. His reputation, name, large
acquaintance, etc., would all be valu
able, I should think, and he would,
in my estimation, be of no little service
to you in the way of aiding you in the
preparation of articles, speeches, etc.,
which you are too busy to devote your
time to entirely. I think a proposi
tion of $50 a week on the weekly and
$400 a year from the magazine for work,
he might do or extra work for you
would get him for the first year, or
probably $2500. I make this sugges
tion as S. is waiting and expecting to
hear from Mr. Mills every day, and
will undoubtedly accept if nothing
else turns up. I learn from Mr. Mills
that he has a high opinion of Sheldon,
and it seems to me that the latter
could be made valuable to arrange
things between you and the railroad
If found desirable. You, of course,
understand my Interest in the African
trip. It was to make the magazine in
Fnme way the official mouthpiece of
Huntington's expedition (in America).
In other words, the report and articles
would be given to the American peo
ple through the magazine, for which
we could obtain some equivalent, either
political or financial. I have caution
ed Sheldon, if he goes, to have entire
control of the writing up of the coun
try, and he will, of course, throw it
our way if he can. Very truly yours,
C. F. HOLDER.
HOLDER'S UNDERHAND ATTACK ON EX
BANK COMMISSIONER A. GER
BERDING.
Professor Holder wrote many let
ters, but most of them possessed only
an incidental interest in connection
with the Californian Illustrated Maga
zine. On December 30, 1892, Professor
Holder indicated that as an agent of
Dick McDonald he had entered the po
litical field and was suggesting schemes
by which certain candidates for gub
ernatorial favor might be defeated.
The genial professor earnestly urged
Dick to secure the co-operation of that
literary star, Dan Burns.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 30, 18fl2.
My Dear Mr. McDonald: I met the
Governor this morning by appointment
and the result of his talk with Mxrk
ham was that the latter had already
decided to continue the appointment
o f g â to the full term. He did the
same with all, my case as trustee of
the Normal School was an example, so
we were met by something that can
not be overcome by anything except
great pressure, which cannot be decid
ed upon until you are consulted. Dr.
J. and myself had a conversation with
Governor Sheldon this a. m. and the
doctor goes north to-night and will re
port to you.
Governor S. thinks there is a chance
if charges can be brought against O.
and he will go in if there is any show.
He, Governor Sheldon, is on good
terms with Burns and other influential
politicians in San Francisco and my
advice is that you have Governor Shel
don go up Monday and make the fight
against this fellow from every point
with all the force he can bring to bear.
I believe something can be done. At
least it is worth trying. If it can be
shown to Markham that there is any
thing against G. in any way I think
something can be done and I think
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1898.
HOLDER MAKES AN UNDERHAND ATTACK ON GERBERDING.
During the later days of the Pacific Bank and the People's Home Savings Bank, Bank Commissioner Al Gerberding was
thorn In the sides of the McDonalds. Gerberding insisted upon demanding from the McDonalds a better showing for
their banks The Commissioner could not be handled and every effort was made to paralyze his official actions. Profes
sor Holder went farther* than most of Dick McDonald's tools In his efforts to checkmate Gerberding and to prevent
him from clogging the dishonest progress of the bank. Holder went to Los Angeles and attempted to secure from
Governor Markham a promise that he would not appoint Gerberding for the full term as Bank Commissioner. Gov
ernor Markham declined to give this promise, and then Holder suggested to McDonald that an attack be made upon
the character of Gerberding, that charges in some way be preferred against him and that he be dishonored. In this
blackguard scheme Professor Holder suggested the propriety of securing the assistance of Dan Burns.
Sheldon would be able to do something
with Burns, anyway. Very truly yours,
C. F. HOLDER.
THE PROFESSOR ASSISTS HIS MASTER
IN HIS AMBITION TO BE
GOVERNOR.
Shortly before the election in No
vember, 1892, Holder wrote a letter to
Dick McDonald severely criticizing the
action of a woman who was then in the
employ of the Californian Magazine.
This woman, so Holder alleged, was
telling Dick's secrets in political mat
ters and flouting about the streets the
interesting fact that he was to capture
the School Department and use it as
an Instrument in his guberna
torial campaign. The woman's name
is of no public interest, the letter being
of importance only as an illustration of
the relationship existing between Hold
er and McDonald. Excerpts from the
epistle are as follows:
My Dear Mr. McDonald: Would it
not be a good plan to let this â â â
return to her work until after election.
She has a long tongue, is ugly and at
this time, when every point counts,
might do some harm to your plan to
secure control of the schools in the in
terest of the Governorship, etc. I write
aa I know she is prepared to talk and
has already told one person, my In
formant, your plans for the capture of
the schools, etc., and a lot more stuff
that would make disagreeable reading
if she should get hold of some black
mailing sheet to publish it and during
election times such papers are fairly
easy to find. You can put her back
until election is over and then make a
new deal. Some of your friends must
leak or she would not get hold of these
things. Sincerely yours,
C. F. HOLDER.
0. T. DYER DENIED THAT THE BOOKS
OF THE RIVERSIDE BANK HAD
BEEN FALSIFIED.
There are only a very few letters of
importance or general public interest
that were written either by O. T. Dyer,
the manager of the Riverside Bank, or
his sister, Miss E. C. Dyer, the cashier
of the institution. While Dyer and his
sister played a most important part in
the history of the Pacific Bank, they
wrote but very few letters that shed
new light on the relations between
the Pacific Bank and the People's
Home Savings Bank. It has been
demonstrated that the McDonalds and
the Dyers understood thoroughly the
wretched condition of their own banks.
It has been shown that the Dyers had
the McDonalds by the throat and made
the very existence of the Pacific Bank
a pledge for the continued life of the
Riverside Bank.
The Dyers were as fearful of the
Bank Commissioners as were the Mc-
Donalds, and schemed to avoid an hon
est investigation with McDonald. In
both cases absolute reliance was placed
upon the dishonest support and co
operation of W. H. H. Hart. Hart had
placed himself practically in the power
of the Pacific Bankers and in exchange
for his services received financial ac
commodation whenever he needed it.
Reference to this fact and to the un
denied interference of A. Gerberding in
the affairs of the dishonest bankers is
frequently made in the letters of O. T.
Dyer. These references, however, while
they are important in the estaDlish
ment of the proof that The Call under
took, form no new elements to the
story. When it became evident in the
middle part of 1892 that its collapse
seemed inevitable, O. T. Dyer was sent
to New York to assist the other con
spirators in the gigantic task of nego
tiating the worthless securities of the
Riverside Bank.
As a matter of course these securities
were not negotiable, but Dyer remained
in the East, while his sister, stationed
in the bank at Riverside and possess
ing absolute control of the institution,
continued to increase the enormous
overdraft that was killing the Pacific
Bank. Time and again R. H. McDonald
Jr. wrote letters bitterly accusing the
brother and sister of gross neglect, bad
faith and dishonesty. Many of the leu
tors written by the Dyers, were in an
swer to these accusations. These epis
tles possess no particular public inter
est. On August 16, 1892, O. T. Dyer
wrote a bitter letter to Dick McDonald
warning him to keep his spies and his
agents away from Riverside or through
his absurd policy he would precipitate
the very thing the conspirators were
seeking to avoid, a run on the Riverside
Bank.
"No ordinary fool," declared Dyer,
"has a million dollars to place. Leave
our negotiations alone." In another
letter O. T. Dyer wrote scathingly to
Dick McDonald, denouncing him for
the insinuation that there were dis
honest entries in the books of the
Riverside Bank. Dyer begged Dick to
remember that Gerberding had been
most scrupulous and exacting in his ex
amination and under those circum
stances it had been impossible to in
troduce any crooked entries, even if the
managers of the bank wished to make
any. "You know," said Dyer, "that
Gerberding watched your father like a
cat when he was at Riverside and San
Diego."
DYER CONFESSES THE DISHONEST COL
LUSION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
HART.
On October 6, 1892, Dyer did pen a
1 letter of general public interest. Ex
cerpts from this epistle, which was ad
dressed to R. H. McDonald Jr., are as
follows: "With some one pushing me
at every turn I make here and a dyna
mite bomb in every letter the mail
brings from there, and yet with all this
you have the coolness to say in your
last letter, received to-day, that I shall
learn that I have you to deal with and
no one else. As though I did not realize
that fact as forcibly as any one could.
No, sir; notwithstanding your insinua
tions as to my intentions you shall get
your money, every dollar, unless by
some act of your own you drive me to
the wall, and the time shall yet come
when you shall look me in the face
and acknowledge that I have been
honest with you. Your brother, in his
anxiety to get matters in a different
shape before that Jew Gerberding
should visit Riverside again and en
tirely unbeknown to me, sat up one
whole night, or until 3 in the morning,
to draft out a letter and proposition to
you, and when I came into the office the
next day he handed me his rough draft
of his proposition, saying he had spent
nearly all night working on a proposi
tion, and that if I would accept right
away so that he could get off by the
first mall he could get through by Oc
tober 1, the date we had agreed with
Hart to make a statement to him, and
before Gerberding could get down there
and raise another rumpus, as he would
probably not go until Hart got his
statement.
"As to the proposition, it may be a
late day to discuss it, and I will only
say that it does strike me that an
ordinary unbiased mind could only look
on it as a proposition written in your
interest, its provisions not only adding
to but strengthening your present se
curity without costing you one dollar
in money or additional liability. Its
effect would be to sustain and build up
the credit of our bank and stock, mak
ing it possible for us to raise money for
you and making our stock and our in
dorsement good collateral for you, also
relieving both you and us from the
severe strain and blackmail we are
subject to on account of the Commis
sioners, as they then could not object.
So entirely Independent of your broth
er's proposition we can begin to see our
way out at no great distant day if you
continue to stand by us and Mr. Hart
don't go back on us."
While Dyer was writing such letters
as these his sister was increasing the
overdraft and leading the Pacific Bank
more deeply into the hole. Every de
mand of McDonald for money met with
promises and nothing more. This con
dition of affairs continued until shortly
j before the collapse of the Pacific Bank
came and then the Riverside went down
in disgraceful bankruptcy
THE SCHEMES OF E. A. DAVIS AND
R. J. DAVIS OUTLINED.
Among the many men who received
favors, financial and otherwise, from
the McDonalds in exchange for flat
tery and servility were E. A. Davis
and R. J. Davis. R. J. Davis was the
secretary of the Mohawk schemes into
which Dick McDonald had been in
veigled and in which many thousands
of dollars were lost. E. A. Davis was a
clerk in the Pacific Mutual Life Insur
ance Company, and through his friend
ship with Frank McDonald secured
many financial favors and the promise
of more. The letters of these men are
Interesting, as they suggest several
schemes in which the deluded bankers
sank money. One wanted to be a Bank
Commissioner and wrote that he would
turn over to Dick McDonald every
month his salary in payment of a note
that was absolutely unsecured. The
other suggested foolish plots and plans
in reference to the Colton Marble Com
pany and the Mohawk schemes, of
which he was secretary.
A Uttle more than two months before
the banks failed R. J. DaviB suggested
a wild financial project to Frank V.
McDonald to buy out the Pacific Mu
tual Life Insurance Company and conÂ«
duct It in conjunction with the People's
Home Savings Bank and the Pacific
Bank. Davis declared that no other
man in the world was so well qualified
as Frank McDonald to accomplish such
a scheme and establish the strongest
financial combination in the United
States. It will only cost, Davis said.
$125,000. But Frank did not bite at ths
bait. He did, however, go to the Pa
cific Mutual Life Insurance Company a
few weeks before the Pacific Bank
failed and insure his life for $10,000.
To the surprise of the manager,
Mr. Beaver, McDonald insisted on
paying the entire premium at once.
This premium amounted to $4600 In
cash, and Mr. Beaver suggested that
Frank McDonald might better leave
the sum in his own bank, where it
would draw interest. Frank replied
carelessly, however, that he preferred
to have the matter off his hands and
would pay the premium in full. He
knew then that the Pacific Bank was
on the very edge of ruin and must soon
go down with a crash. The money was
paid and the depositors of the Pacific
Bank gave their deposit for another
benefit for the McDonalds.
The letters of E. A. Davis show that
the young man was deeply enough in
the confidence of Dick McDonald to
suggest and plan at least one shady
transaction in the sale of Pacific Bank
stock.
The Call will continue to-morrow
morning the history of the confidential
correspondence of the Pacific Bankers
and will exploit other gigantic frauds
to which reference has not yet been
m^ide.
DORA WILSON GETS
THE QUENTIN ESTATE
Succeeds in Breaking the Rancher's
Will by Which She Was Dis
inherited.
REDWOOD CITY. Nov. 22.â The large
rs;nte of James Quentin was to-day given
into the possession of Mrs. Dora Wilson,
formerly Dora Horn. Quentin died in this
county about two years ago. leaving an
estate valued at about $125,000, of which
$st'>.ooo was money in bank, the balance
consisting: of a 1300-acre ranch known as
the San Gregorio ranch, and a lot of per
sonal property. He left a will by which
all of his property was disposed of. He
claimed to have had no living relatives
and willed his estate to friends and to
the Protestant orphan asylums of San
Francisco and Sacramento.
Soon after the will was admitted to
probate a contest was instituted by Dora
Wilson, who claimed to be the daughter
and heir of the deceased. She alleged
as grounds of the contest undue influence
and fraud on the part of certain of the
legatees of the will. In the will Quentin
expressly disinherited Mrs. Wilson and
failed to make any provision for her on
the ground that she uad no claims upon
him. Mrs. Wilson proved her claim to
the property, and as a result gets the
whole of It with the exception of $12,500,
distributed to the asylums mentioned in
the will, this probably being a compro
mise between Mrs. Wilson and the asy
lums. .

RAFAEL IGLESIAS
VISITS AMERICA
Costa Rica's President
at New York.
TRAVELING FOR PLEASURE
TRIP NOT CONNECTED WITH
STATE AFFAIRS.
He Intimates That Costa Rica May
Prevent the Construction of the
Isthmus Canal by Grace
Syndicate.
SpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Rafael Igle
sias, President of Costa Rica, arrived
here to-day on the Atlas liner Altai
from Port Limon and Kingston. With
President Iglesias were Ricardo Igle
sias, his brother; Colonel Leonzo Bo
nila, aide-de-camp; Dr. Antonio Guis
tana and General John S. Cazament of
the Costa Rican Railway. The party
will stop at the Waldorf for a few daya
before proceeding to Washington.
Shortly after the Altai left quarantine
for her dock she was boarded by Col
onel William Carter of the War Depart
ment, representing President McKin
ley, to welcome President Iglesias.
President Iglesias said that he was
traveling practically Incognito and not
on national business. He was opposed
to display. He had simply come herÂ©
for pleasure and for the benefit of his
health. He expects to take a trip to
England and France, and on his way
home he will spend some months in the
United States.
The visit here of President Iglesias at
the present time, when there is so much
talk about building the canal across
Nicaragua, is believed to have been
brought about by the recent concession
granted to the Grace syndicate, which
goes into effect in October, 1899. When
this concession was announced it was
said that Costa Rica's opposition could
not in any way affect the new grant.
President Iglesias, when spoken to
about the proposed canal to-day, said
Costa Rica had important rights, which
it had reserved, and intimated that all
would not be plain sailing for the new
syndicate. Further he would not dis
cuss the matter.
Dr. Ulloa, Consul General of Costa
Rica, however, explained what was
meant by Costa Rica's rights. The Con
sul General until last May was Vice-
President of the country, and he re
signed In favor of Don Dometrio Igle
sias, the President's father, who is now
acting for his son. Dr. Ulloa said that
his country had equal rights with Nica
ragua along the San Juan River, an
important waterway, which divided the
two republics.
The building of dams across the river
for an interoceanic canal, it is said,
will inundate considerable land in Costa
Rica. Without the latter country's
sanction, it is asserted, the concession
held by the Grace syndicate is virtually
valueless. There is said to be a strong
feeling in Costa Rica in favor of allow
ing the United States, instead of a pri
vate corporation, to build the canal,
and that country will do its best to
thwart the scheme planned by Nica
ragua.
Dr. Ulloa said that the reason that
Costa Rica has not joined the Republic
of Central America, which was com
posed of San Salvador, Nicaragua and
Honduras, was that the combination
was looked upon as an experiment and
not by any means as a stable compact.
The revolt now in progress in San Sal
vador, he added, was a serious one, and
was the outcome of the union which
went into effect November 1.

GAGE MAKES
HIS INITIAL
APPOINTMENT
Foley His Private
Secretary.
BESIEGED WITH APPLICATIONS
COMING NORTH TO CONFER
ABOUT THEM.
Declares He Has Made No
Pledges and Will Consider
All Names Very Care
fully.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22.â William I.
Folpy will be the private secretary of
Governor-elect Henry T. Gape. This
announcement was authoritatively
made this evening by Mr. daw him
self to the correspondent of The Call.
Mr. !â¢ uley for ten years past been
associated with Mr. Gage in the prac
tice of law in this city. He has been
the confidential advisor and counselor
of the Governor-elect in many matters
not within the strict confines of busi
ness. As sen as >lr. Gage became the
candidate for tht Republican nomina
tion for Governor, Mr. Foley took ac
tive charge of his campaign. After the
nomination was secured he accom
panied the head of the Republican
State ticket on his tour, and remained
with him until election day. Mr. Foley
is about 40 years of age and is a highly
cultured gentleman. In his profession
his standing is high, and in local liter
ary circles he has attained quite a rep
utation as a student of the classics.
A story was current this evening that
Colonel Ueorge Stone of San Francisco
had been selected by Mr. Gage as the
successor of Adjutant General A. W.
Barrett. This statement is unauthor- I
iztd. The Governor-elect stated posi
tively to-night that he had not as yet
given thy matter of his appointments
the slightest consideration, further than
u> name his private secretary.
"You can reiterate what I have before i
Btated," said Mr. Gage, "I have not
made a single Bolitary pledge or prom
ise to appoint anybody to any office.
The matter of appointments has not us
yet been taken up by me. I have not
h d an opportunity so far to get around
to those subjects. I propose when the
time comes to take them up and con
sider carefully all names before any
appointments are made.
It is known that Mr. Gage has re
ceived an extraordinary mail fur the
past ten days, weighted down with ap
plications. There is an army from
Southern California that desires to be >
placed, but Mr. Gage has absolutely
declined to consider any personal ap
plications, and letters containing re
quests have never reached him. They
have been filed by Mr. Foley.
Mr. and Mrs. Gage, accompanied by
their daughter, Lucille, will leave for
the north to-morrow. They will be
present at the launching of the Wis
consin, which is to take place at the
Union Iron Works on Saturday. Miss
Lucille is to be the star performer on
that occasion, as she is to press the
button which will slide the frame of j
the big naval monster from the stocks i
inio the water.
I?< fore his return Governor Gage will
ibly consult with some of the
northern leaders of the Republican
party as to his appointees. He will not
return to Los Angeles for several
It la given out by friends of Assem
blyman L. H. Valentine this evening
that he has retired from the contest as

Fight in Santa Clara
County.
SAN JOSE \'ov. 22.â The Board of
Supervisors to-day declared Joseph A.
Lotz, candidate for Treasurer on
the Republican ticket, entitled to
the certificate of election. The re
canvass started yesterday overcame
Conant's lead of one and gave Lotz a
majority of two. Conant lost one in
the Ninth Precinct of San Jose and one
at Robertsville and Lotz gained one in
Highland. The official count as an
nounced gives Lutz 5384 votes and
Conant 5382.
The tally sheet of the Thirteenth Pre
cinct showed "int to have 115 votes.
The latfer's friends claimed this should
be 119. The tally sheet kept by In
spector F. J. Clark was asked for. but
Clark, in violation of the law, refused
to let any one see it. Finally a threat to
arrest Clark caused Supervisor Stern,
his employer, to issue an order for Clark
to produce the sheet. This tally sheet
showed Conant 117 votes. The Super
visors â Ayer, Stern and Rea â refused
to allow the extra two votes and gave
Conant 115 votes in the precinct.
SHIP SAMOENA SAFE.
Reaches Port After Having Encoun-
tered a Series of Gales.
ASTORIA, Or., Nov. 22.â The overdue
British ship Samoena. sixty-two days
from Nagasaki, in ballast, arrived to-day.
The Samoena has been classed with the
missing vessels Laurelbank and Valky
rian and 40 per cent reinsurance was
taken on the vessel. Captain Boyce states
he ran into the equinoctial jraies after
passing the one hundred and fortieth
meridian. They lasted several days and
afterward encountered two heavy ty
phoons. One of them was very severe, his
chip being under bare poles for fifteen
hours. The Samoena weathered the storm
â¢without injury and on the 24th of October,
in 163 east, another heavy northwest gale
was encountered ami seas continually
washed over the vessel. Approaching the
Pacific <'<;ast continuous heavy weather
was experienced.
Captain Boyce brings no news of the
missing vessels Laurclbank and Valky
rlan.

GOVERNOR
HASTENS TO
PARDON THEM
Persecuted Boys to
Go Free.
WILL LEAVE SAN QUENTIN
THE CALL'S STORY AROUSES MB,
BUDD'S INDIGNATION.
Executive Will Lose No TimÂ© in'
Causing the Release of the Lads
Who Were Railroaded to
Prison.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Nov. 22.â
The pardons for the three boys who
were railroaded to the penitentiary
from San Luis Obispo County have al
ready been signed by the Governor, and
as sunn as a minor legal technicality j
has beer, complied with the lads will be
given their liberty and sent home to
their parents in Bakersfield.
When the facts of this flagrant pro
ceeding and the action taken by the
Board of State Prison Directors were
read in The Call by the Governor his I
indignation rivaled that of the board
itself. The public is already familiar
with the details of the case; how the!
boys in question, Earl Touseley, Guy
Lamb and Christian Portlock, the eld
est of whom is aged 16, were arrested
while on a camping tour for having
made use of an old horse that had been
turned out to die, pleaded guilty on
being told by the Sheriff and the Dis
trict Attorney that they had been
guilty of horse-atealing, had their pre
liminary examination and were sent to
San Quentin for a year; how they were
even sent one at a ::me in order that ;
the fees of the Sheriff might be aug- j
mented, and how the parents of the !
boys were kept in ignorance of the j
whereabouts of their children until they j
wrote to the postmaster at San Luis;
Obispo. >t |
"I have already signed the pardons,
paid the Governor to one of the direct
ors to-day, "but the law requires that \
before the boys be released the District |
Attorney of the county from which
they were sent to the penitentiary must
have ten days' notice. He can, of
course, waive his rights in the matter,
and I telephoned him with the inten
tion of asking him to do so, but was
told that he was out of town. I never i
heard of such a case as this before and j
I will get those little fellows out of ,
there just as soon as the law will per
mit."
Director Wilkins has not only acted
in conjunction with his fellow-members j
of the board in inducing Governor Budd j
to pardon the boys, but has taken so ;
deep an interest in the affair as to see
the Governor personally and explain
the facts of the case at greater length,
and more specifically than could be
done merely by sending him the docu
ments.
â¢I am always loath to criticize a pub
lic official and his actions," he asserted
to-day, "but I think I put it mildly
when I assert that the excuse offered
for sending these boys to the peniten
tiary is pretty flimsy. District Attor- j
in v Dorn was not previously acquaint- j
ed with them, and I fail to see how he i
could have learned they were dime- :
novel fiends without speaking to some
person acquainted with them. Anyhow, j
that Is not an offense warranting such j
suffering and disgrace as they have en- I
dured, even if it be true."
SACRAMENTO CAR SHOPS
WILL BE REBUILT
Orders Which Discredit the Report
That They May Be Removed
to San Francisco.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 22.â A San Fran
cisco paper this morning contained an
article announcing that the railroad car
shops in Sacramento might be removed
r San Francisco. The article is based
upon the discovery by Supervisor Rot
tanzi of a petition from the Southern Pa
cific Company for the closing of certain
streets in San Francisco which run
through property upon which '.the com
pany expressed a desire to erect car
shop? No action was taken on the peti
tion at the time and the present Board of
San Francisco Supervisors decided to re
fer the matter to the Street Committee,
which is to meet on Wednesday, for ac
tion provided the railroad company is in
the frame of mind it was at the time it
filed the petitionâ October 31, 1892.
The publication referred to, with the
headlines asserting the probable removal
of the Sacramento plant, scarcely agrees
with the conditions visible at the shops.
The fire of a f>w weeks ago destroyed
only a small portion of the plant, which
covera many acres, and gives constant
employment to some 2200 meji. The ruins
had scarcely stopped smoldering when
orders were received for the immediate
reconstruction of the shops. Machinery
haa been ordered from the East and ma
sons are at work putting up the walls of
the new buildings, which, when complet
ed, will be better than the ones destroyed.
Railroad men here pronounce as absurd
the story that the shops or any portion
of them are to be removed to San Fran-
Cisco.
HEAVY FALL OF SNOW.
Beneficial Storm in the 7)lountains
Around Redding.
REDDING, Nov. 22.â A heavy snow for
this season of the year fell in the Trin
ity Mountains on Monday, insuring an
abundance of water for hydraulic and
placer mining throughout the Summer of
]599 A good flurry of anow early in the
fall with a subsequent freeze and fur
ther snowfall, constitute a favorable win
ler for the principal Interests of Trln
it'v Countyâ hydraulic and placer mining.
The annual gold yield of Trinity County
amounts, under normal conditions, to
something like $1,500,000, and since yes
terday's snowstorm it is predicted that
Trinity County will make a new record
the coming year.
Snow was falling at Dunsmuir, Slsson

JESSIE PYLE LOSES.
Supreme Court Decides the Breach of
Promise Case.
SAX JOSE. Nov. 22.â The State Supreme
Court to-day reversed the $12,000 judg
ment obtained by Jessie Pyle ngainst Ed
ward If. Pierey, the local capitalist, for
breach of promise to marry. Miss Pyle
sued for $20,000. She alleged that Pierey
had wronged her under promise of mar
riage and was the father of her two
children. The case was tried here before
Judge Reynolds in 1896, and was one of
the most stubborn contests ever waged
In the county. The Jury awarded her
$12,000 and Pierey appealed. The ground
for overruling the decision was that the
court erred in the admission of testimony.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1898.
STRANGE FATE OF
THE MARIA TERESA
Mystery Concerning Her
Abandonment.
RODE GRACEFULLY TO SHORE
LITTLE WATER IN HER HOLD AT
THE TIME.
Belief Prevalent That Her Destruc
tion Was' Due to a Delib
erate Purpose to That
End.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22. â The steamer
Antilla is at present in this port. Her
second officer, Edward Webber, said to
day that when the steamer was
at Cat Island the Infanta Maria Teresa
was lying in about fifteen feet of water
and the surf was breaking over her.
She was lying easy and not on the
rocks, but with her nose in the sand.
"Had the surf not been so high I be
lieve that we could have pulled her
off," said Mr. Webber. "I questioned
the natives and learned from them
that the Maria Teresa first appeared in
the offing about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, the Thursday after she was aban
doned. She rode in gracefully, but had
she been brought in under skillful
guidance she could not have gone
j ashore at a better place. She went on
j the shore at 11 o'clock the same morn
ing in which she was sighted.
"It is my opinion, as well as the
opinion of the others on Cat Island,
that for some reason an attempt was
made by those on the Maria Teresa to
have her sink. She had drifted far in
the storm. All the square portholes
above the waterline were left open, but
in spite of this there was only three
feet of water in her when she came
ashore. I believe that the crew when
i they left her were anxious that might
!be the last of her. She is lying at
! present with a very slight list to port.
j As her stern is pointing to the breakers
: the waves as they break .near the stern
; run alongside, making little vibration.
I The pumps were all right and the
working parts are above water. I be
lieve that the vessel will not go to
I pieces, but will remain where she is for |
years. Her military masts have gone
I by the board and are lying on each side
of her."
NORFOLK. Va., Nov. 22.â The Curt
of Inquiry appointed by the Secretary
of the Naw to ascertain why the Span
' ish cruiser Maria Teresa was aban
doned' doned and to fix the responsibility be
â¢ gan its labors to-day. Several of the
j crew of tusrs of the Merritt Wrecking
Company and the Leonidas were heard,
but members of the court would not
give out anything for publication.

DEWEY MAY BE
A CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT
Such Is the Belief Prevalent
Among the Political Sharps
at the National Capital.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â The
report from New York that Ad
miral Dewey had been offered
and declined an offer of $500 for
an article on the naval battle of
Manila and the future foreign
policy of this Government was
much discussed in Washington
to-day.
This coupled with his congrat
ulatory telegram to Theodore
Roosevelt and his letter to
Friend, published to-day. ex
pressing himself in favor of re
taining the entire Philippine
archipelago leads political sharps
to believe that Admiral Dewey
is really an aspirant for the
Presidential nomination in 1900.
There was some talk of this at
Manila amone the American col
ony there this summer, but the
naval officers at that time char
acterized it as "idle gossip."
NOBLEMAN'S SON IN
PRISON FOR MURDER
The Slayer of an Aged Couple Falls
Heir to a Large Estate in
Scotland.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Nov. 22.â One of
the half-forgotten histories of Canadian
criminal annals, in which interest is just
renewed, deals with the antecedents of
Walter McWherrell, who is now serving
r life sentence in Kingston Penitentiary
for having killed an aged couple named
Williams near Port Creit five years ago.
Although captured and ultimately con
victed, the mystery of McWherrell's iden
tity was never really solved.
Within the last few weeks a woman
giving the name of Mrs. O. M. K. Tru
man, Mount Hope Cottage, Queen street,
North Hamilton, began to intercede with
the Minister of Justice for the pardon of
McWherrell, who, she stated, was a rela
tive of hers and connected with a dis
tinguished family in the old country.
Living among the poor and no better
off herself, Mrs. Truman tells her Hamil
ton neighbors that she is Lady Klnnaird,
the wife of the rightful heir of one of the
greatest estates in Scotland, and that she
obtains her title In virtue of being the
duly wedded wife of Walter McWherrell,
the'eondemned murderer, who, she claims,
is the scapegrace son of a Scotch noble,
and who ran away and joined the army
and now. through the death of Lord Kin
naird, becomes the heir to the title and
estates.

CHANGES IN THE
CIVIL SERVICE
New Order to Be Issued
Shortly.
POSITIONS IT WILL AfFECT
THOUSANDS EXEMPTED FROM
THE PRESENT RULES.
Quite a Number of Openings in
Various Departments Will
Be Made in San Fran
cisco.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Nov. 22.
It is said that by next week President
McKinley will have prepared and pro
mulgated his new civil service order,
exempting many places from the opera
tion of that law.
Nearly all of his time is now occupied
In preparing his annual message to
Congress and with State Department
affairs, but his Cabinet secretaries are
tabulating data for him and It was
said to-day that the civil service proc
lamation would probably be ready for
his signature within a week or ten
days.
Thousands of government positions
placed under the civil service by Presi
dent Cleveland will be exempted and
room made for faithful Republican
party workers. This is a pleasant pros
pect for those anxious to enter Uncle
yam's service, but is viewed with con
siderable apprehension by many who
are now protected.
Democratic officeholders are naturally
most apprehensive, while the Repub
licans under civil service are reason
ably sure of holding on to their jobs,
at least until the end of President Mc-
Kinley's administration.
Most of the changes will be made in
the Treasury and Interior departments,
but there will be some in the Postoffice
and Agricultural departments.
Thousands of pension office examin
ing surgeons will be exempted as well
as deputy collectors of customs and in
ternal revenue. It is not definitely
known which officers of these depart
ments will be exempted, but in general
the proclamation will affect subordi
nates who handle money and for whose
conduct of cash transactions their su
periors are responsible to Uncle Sam.
Many collectors of customs and of in
ternal revenue have repeatedly repre
sented that these employes should be
selected by themselves since collectors
are responsible and liable for fiduciary
acts. In many instances postmasters
and collectors of customs and revenue
have been held liable for shortages of
deputies and cashiers, whereas, if men
of their own selection and in whom
they had confidence had served under
them such would not have been the
case.
It is said that President McKinley
was quick to see, the Justice of this con
tention and thaj. his order will exempt
these subordinates from civil service
rules.
Though nothing defir '*- Is known, it
is the general understanding that his
forthcoming o d^r will e.nbrace this
class of employes.
Thii w 1 affect California deputy col
lectors of internal revenue, pension
examining surgeons, some employes of
the Postoffice and perhaps deputy
United States marshals.
In the custo is service at San Fran
cisco the place of William Hamilton,
cashier, may, and likely will, be ex
empted, as well as the auditor and chief
clerk and others who by law are liable
in an emergency to be made deputy
collectors of customs.
STEPS FROM A CAR
ON A HIGH BRIDGE
Freight Conductor Falls Fifty Feet
and Receives Fatal In
juries.
REDDING, Nov. 22.â While the reaT end
of his train was standing on the Schoon
over bridge on Monday night H. O. Steele,
a freight conductor, stepped off the ca
boose in the darkness and fell fifty feet
to the rocky bed of the river. When
picked up he was conscious, though suf
fering Intense pain. The injured man was
hurried to Redding in time to catch the
train for Sacramento, where he has a
wife and family. It is doubtful if the man
can recover. Steele was a new conductor
on the road and unfamiliar with the line.

spanning the Sacramento River at the
first crossing above Redding. This makes
the third accident on the 8choonover
bridge, two of which were fatal.

In Death .the Erring President of j
the First National of Emporia
Seeks to Make Partial
Reparation.
Special Dispatch to the Call.
EMPORIA, Kans., Nov. 22.â Since the
sensational failure of the First Na
tional Bank, which was followed by
the suicide of Charles S. Cross, presi
dent of the bank and owner of the cele
brated Sunnyside Stock farm, there
have been rumors of a written confes- {
slon left behind by the suicide. This
letter was made public to-night by
William Martindale. vice-president of
the bank, and has caused a sensation
in Emporia, for It is an acknowledg
ment by the suicide that he had sys
tematically deceived and defrauded, not j
only the patrons of his bank, but his :
business associates. The letter fol- j
lows :
Emporia, Kans., May 12, 1898, 12 m.
I desire to state that the misfortunes of
myself and the bank have been caused j
through my faults and errors. I Inherit! -d
a large debt, which I endeavored to meet ,
by going into other schemes, which have .
all been practical failures and only got me j
deeper into the mire.
As to the bank matters. I desire to say I
that I have carefully laid plans to deceive |
both the board of directors, the cashier
and employes. Mr. Martindale will now
learn for the first time how I have care
fully deceived him, principally by way of
substituted paper, of which he has no
knowledge. The reports and letters writ
ten the Comptroller have been by me mis
represented to the board. They had signed
on the last page, and I had sent others
than the ones read to them, changing
every one but the last sheet.
I have had a hard luck story most of my
lifetime, the only pleasant feature being
that of my present wife, who has been a I
good and true woman. Mr. Davis, our !
cashier, has never made an improper en- I
try on the books and knows nothing of
this whole miserable business. Death I |
do not fear; it is preferable to the agony
of the past year.
I know of nothing 1 further to add except
as to Mr. Martindale â this is a terrible j
thing for him. He trusted me without re- I
serve. I have given him a bill of sale of j
all my personal property. C. S. CROSS.
FATAL SHOOTING AT~
SANTA BARBARA;
Result of a Quarrel Between a Man !
and Woman, Induced by
Jealousy.
SANTA BARI.vRA, Nov. 22.â William
Silva and Miss Jose Rluz were shot this j
evening about 7 o'clock. Silva was hit :
just above the heart, the bullet lodging j
In the back, and is expected to die at any !
moment.
The woman is shot through the shoul
der and has an ugly wound, but not nee- 1
essarily a fatal one. Their stories so ;
conflicting that it is puzzling the authori- |
ties to place the crime on one or the other.
His story is as follows:
He and the woman were at supper and
had just finished a bottle of beer, when in I
the course of conversation she accused
him of keeping company with another !
woman. He denied it and she insisted j
that she was right.
Thereupon he jumped up and said he 1
would leave her. She immediately arose, |
picked up a cuspidore and threw it at him. j
then snatched his pistol from his pocket ;
and as he faced about tired. He says he ;
ran out of the house, entered Dr. Beoes
eke's yard across the street, and fell on i
the doorstep. He says that he had not !
been drinking, although in the dining
room were several empty beer bottles.
She is very hysterical and has not been \
able to speak rationally. She repeatedly
says: "He shot me first." The bullet
entered her shoulder from th^ rear, mak
ing it almost impossible for her to have
done it herself. The bullet was a 44 cali
ber and inflicted a very bad wound.
Silva is a man of 28 years and for sev- !
eral years has been clerk in a cigar store, j
His reputation has been that of a harm- I
less fellow, with not much principle. She I
lived with him for some time.

greatest sympathy. They will have con
trol of the only patronage offices won by
the one hundred job chasers and their sat

during the campaign were as nothing

CHICAGO'S WAR
ON SILK SKIRTS
San Francisco Ladies Say It Is Not
Likely to Be Taken Up
Here.
EFFETE Chicago has raised Its voice against the wearing of silk
petticoats, and that article of feminine apparel is doomedâ in the
Windy City at least. It seems that a woman's club in Atlanta
sounded the first note of protest against the "frou-frou" of the dainty
undergarment and the cry was quickly taken up in Chicago.
It appears that the swish of skirts is exceedingly trying to the
nerves of those who have to listen to them and even the pulpit and
stage or that part of the profession commonly termed the "front of
the house," have joined forces in the crusade against the offending
garment. It is asserted that members of congregation or audience
who have reached their seats in good season are distracted by late ar
riving silk-skirted ladies sailing grandly down the aisles. To the
average male Chicagoan, who seeks the church for a quiet hour to
figure on the price of pork, all such worldly sounds must indeed prove
distracting, but in other places where religion is not mixed with busi
ness, like whisky with quinine, there is small probability of any out
cry being made against the wearing apparel of the dear girls.
At least there is little or no danger of San Francisco joining in the
crusade, and if it did it would in all probability prove a failure, for
San Francisco women wear just what they fancy and their tastes are
more than pleasing to the men. A number of the most prominent
members of the fashionable set were visited yesterday for the purpose
of obtaining their opinion on the Chicago uprising, and the probabil
ity of its reaching San Francisco. Some of the ladies declined to dis
cuss the mat'- at all, others merely smiled and called the whole affair
absurd, while same declared there was no likelihood whatever of San
Francisco agitating the question, and if it did it would not accom
plish its purpi 3e. The ladies would wear silk skirts if they wanted to,
but really they are rapidly going out of fashion.
MAX POPPER
CHASTISED
BY CORBETT

for Backbiting.
THE INDIGNITY UNRESENTED
MAKES HIS ESCAPE AFTER THE
PUNISHMENT.
Gentleman Jim's Brother Frank's
First Attempt at Pugilism.
The Beal Cause of the
Assault.
There were two Corbett fights yester
day, one in New York and a local one
right in San Francisco. Frank Corbett,
a brother of Jim, dealt "Maximilian"
Popper the hardest blow he has received
this year; in vet it was more severe
than the shock he received when he
learned that his pet nominees for Super
visors were defeated on November 8.
The trouble all arose from Maximilian's
long tongue. Yesterday afternoon about
4 o'clock Frank Corbett met Popper on
Market street, near the Phelan building.
Stepping up to him he told him that he
would like to talk to him, and after a
short and animated conversation Corbett
landed a right swing on Popper's face.
Popper was staggered for a second by the
blow, but evidently thinkrng discretion the
better part of valor he hurried down the
street, vehemently asserting that the
chastisement was unwarranted.
Frank Corbett was very willing to give
his side of the story. "I am very sorry
the thing happened," he said, "but I was
compelled to do what I did to teach Pop
per not to talk about people behind their
backs. The trouble arose through
per saying some very disrespectful things
about "me just because he heard that I
might go out to the City Hall after the
first of the year in an office different from
that where lam now employed. I met
Popper on the street to-day for the first
time since I heard he was 'knocking' me,
and stepped up to him and accused him
of the trick. He denied that he had ever
said anything about me, but I called him
a liar and just slapped his face, only hop
ing that he would retaliate; but I am sor
ry to say he refused to take It up.
think I have taught him a lesson, and I
POPPER LEMS THE CORBETI BLOW
do not think he will talk about me in the
future." m ..
Max Popper was seen soon after the
trouble and said he had nothing to say
about the affair. He denied that he had
spoken disrespectfully of Corbett at any
time. _ _________^_

THE SPEAKERSHIP CONTEST
THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER
OPPOSITION.
practically the Entire Vote of the
Assembly Pledged to Alameda
County's Favorite
Son.
Another chapter has been added to
the somewhat one-sided contest for
the Speakership of the next Assembly.
Yesterday Assemblyman-e!ect Charles
M. Belshaw of Antioch, Contra Costa
County, withdrew from the contest in
favor of Howard E. Wright of Berke
ley.
The withdrawal of Mr. Belshaw sets
at rest any doubt that may have ex
isted as to the success of Mr. Wright's
candidacy, and as the case now stands
practically the entire membership of
the Assembly is pledged to the support
of Alameda County's favorite son.
Mr. Belshaw's claim for the honor of
being named as Speaker of the next
Assembly was based on the fact that
he had served as a member of that body
during two successive terms, his record
being such that he was again re-elected
at the election held on November 8.
When asked yesterday for his reasons
for withdrawing his candidacy for the
Speakership he said:
"I announced my candidacy for the
Speakership soon after the election,
and since then have received assur
ances of support from friends in many
parts of the State. To-day I decided to
withdraw in favor of Howard E.
Wright of Berkeley, believing that by
so doing I will serve the best interests
of the community at large. It is im
portant that the business of the coming
session of the Legislature should not
be hampered or retarded In any way
by personal contests. I served with Mr.
Wright during the last session of the
Legislature, and I know him to be a
man in whose hands the duties of
Speaker may well be trusted. He is
not only competent to discharge these
duties, but he has the trust and respect
of all who know him â a condition that
will have a very marked effect on the
manner in which the business of the
Assembly will be transacted.
"It is also due to Alameda County
that she should have this recognition
for one of her representatives. Ala
meda is the banner Republican county
WELLS-FARGO CASE
CROPS UP AGAIN
Attorney General Will Apply to the Superior
Court To-Day lor a Writ ol Mandamus.
ATTORNEY GENERAL FITZGERALD is determined to press his case
against Wells, Fargo & Co. and compel that highly patriotic corpora
tion to pay its share of the war tax if there be a court in the land
which will uphold him. The story of the fight against the corporation
has already been told.
Suit was first brought in the Justices' court and a decision against the
express company was given, but that concern continued to extort the tax
from its patrons. Mr. Fitzgerald then applied to the State Supreme Court
for a writ of mandate compelling Wells, Fargo & Co., as a common carrier,
to stamp its bills of lading in accordance with the law. This application
was denied on the ground that the showing made was not sufficient to
warrant that court in issuing the writ. The Superior Court was pointed out
as the proper tribunal to handle the case. v
Mr. Fitzgerald is in the fight to stay. The papers are all drawn up and
will be presented to-day. In speaking of the case M. Fitzgerald said: "I
fully intended bringing this matter before the Superior Court at once, al
though I think it almost useless. If the court issues the writ I am confi
dent the case will be taken into the United States Courts. As decisions
have already been handed down in the lower courts and the whole thing
has been taken to the Supreme Court of the United States and advanced on
the calendar there will be a decision from that tribunal long before our case
here could be reached.
"I will not pay any attention to that litigation, however, as I have my
own views and intend presenting them to the court. The case has many in
teresting phases and I do not intend letting it slip through my fingers."
Mr. Fitzgerald was informed that newspapers are not required to affix
stamps to the receipts before packages are dispatched, and was asked for
an explanation for this discrimination. "Well, I can see but one explana
tion." he said. "This fight was started by the newspapers, and I suppose
the company thinks it can muzzle the press by showing a little favoritism.
I know that private individuals are still required to pay Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s share of the tax, and presume they will be until the highest court in
the land brings the corporation to time."
of the State, and it is right and proper
that her representative should be the
leader of one branch of the Legislature.
I know that the selection of Mr. Wright
as Speaker will meet the approval of all
good citizens. For this and the other
reasons that I have enumerated I feel
that I can best serve my constituents
by promoting his candidacy."
Mr. Belshaw's intimate knowledge of
legislative work is so well known that
since his withdrawal from the Sneaker
ship contest became known his friends
have signified their intention of urging
him to seek the position of Speaker pro
tern. This is a responsible position and
requires the exercise of abilities of a
high order.

A Footpad Behind the Bars.
John Sweeney was arrested yesterday
by Officers Furlong and McGovern on
a charge of assault with intent to com
mit robbery. John Schmidt is the com
plaining witness. He told the officers
that Sweeney met him on Pacific street
and asked for money, and that when his
demand was refused he struck Schmidt a
violent blow in the face and knocked him
down. The footpad then began searching
the pockets of his victim, but was fright
ened away by the approach of the offi
cers. When they heard Schmidt's story
they went in search of Sweeney and
found him two hours later drunk.
CLOSING THE NEVILLS CASE
Heel B. Terry Begins Building a
Structure to Support the Pros
ecution's Contentions.
Reel B. Terry opened the argument for
.the prosecution in the Williams-Loose
'Azhderian extortion case yesterday aft
ernoon. The morning session of the trial
was occupied in the further examination
of Mrs. Williams, one of the defendants,
and Captain Nevills, whose complaint led
to the arrest of the trio of alleged black
mailers. No additional facts of material
weight were drawn from the witnesses.
The argument advanced by Terry was
both critical and analytical. The char
acteristics and oersonalities of the de
fendants received a severe grilling and
the mass of testimony was segregated
piece by piece and placed in the structure
the prosecution is building to support its
theory. The case goes on to-day.
The Brown Murder Case.
Albert Bierwirth, proprietor of the
Globe lodging-house. 821 Howard street,
was arraigned in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday on the charge of murdering
Arthur F. Brown last Sunday night. The
case was continued until November 28,
and in the meantime the inquest will be
held. May Bennett was by order of the
court detained as a witness.
Sues for Big Damages.
Mary Flaherty filed suit yesterday on
behalf of herself and minor children
against the San Francisco and San Ma
teo Electric Railway Company to recover
$50 000 damages for the death of Simon
Flaherty, plaintiffs husband. Flaherty
was run intc and killed by one of defend
ant's cars at Eighteenth and Church
streets on September 2 last.

AMATEURS ESSAY
BULWER LYTTON'S
GREATEST DRAMA
Creditable Production
of "Richelieu."
EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD CAST
PRESENTED BY THE GENTLE
MEN'S SODALITY.
Many Representative Catholic Cler
gymen Enjoy the Performance
Given for the Benefit of the
Francesca Relief Society.
Lord Lytton's masterpiece "Richelieu"
â was presented last evening at St. Igna
tius Hall by the Gentlemen's Sodality
before a large and appreciative audience.
Probably for the first time in the history
of amateur theatrical efforts In the city
the piece was played with success and
merit. From the roll of the curtain oa
the initial scene until the final words in
the Immortal .drama was spoken the in
terpretation of the various characters
was unusually good, reflecting much
credit on those who impersonated them.
The role of the Cardinal was played by
Frank P. Haynes. To his ability and
unusual talent is due principally the sig
nal success of the production. Probably
there is no character in modern or ancient
historical drama that is more severely
criticized than that of Richelieu. Few
men succeed in the attempt to portray it
as the writer has written it. The crafti
ness, the designing and cruel nature, the
conditional liberality and the passion of
the greatest Frenchman of the seven
teenth century was portrayed last even
ing with a certain trueness that would
have reflected merit on the efforts or
many professional actors.
Adrien de Mauprat, as impersonated by
Thomas W. Hickey, was also good and
deserves special praise. Every gesture
and every word uttered marked the re
sult of hard and painstaking study. Bar
adas as presented by William Ogilvle
was above the ordinary, as was also the
other principal characters in the play.
The production was under the special
and immediate direction of George M.
Hermance and was for the benefit of the
Francesca Relief Society.
The complete cast is as follows:
Cardinal Richelieu, Minister of France.
Frank P. Haynes; Adrien de Mauprat,
chevalier of France, Thomas W. Hickey;
Baradas, favorite of the King, William
Ogilvie; Louis XIII, King of France, Will
iam Wallace; Gaston, Duke of Orleans,
brother to Louis XIII, J. L. Mulrennan;
Sieur de Beringhen, in- attendance on the
king, one of the conspirators, G. C. Fox;
Joseph, a friarâ confidant of Richelieu,
Charles A. Sweigert; Huguet, an officer
of Richelieu's Guards, a spy, J. L. A.Jau
nette; Francois, first page to Richelieu,
D Edward Hanlon; Julian de Mortamar,
orphan and ward of Richelieu, Master W.
I Lonergan; Duke de Lorme, a spy in
Richelieu s service, Frank Meaney; Cler

Cunningham; Governor of the Bastile.

BODLY MANAGED SCHOOLS.
IX his annual report. School Superintendent Web
ster notes the interesting fact that between the
years 1806 and 1898 the cost of maintaining the
schools of this city increased from $32 43 per pupil
in the former year to $37 58 in the latter. In other
words, the expense of maintaining the School Depart
ment has jumped $5 per pupil in the short space of
two years, or at the rate of $2 50 per year. During the
period of two years the number of teachers has in
creased 143, while the increased attendance amounts
only to 1608. The payroll of teachers has increased
$93,412 since 1896.
These figures indicate that the management of the
schools of San Francisco has simply become
wretched. Every Board of Education during the
past five years has contributed to this result, and it
will not do to place all the blame upon the present
combination of politicians who are running the de
partment. The fact of the matter is, the schools are
in politics, and so long as they remain in it will be
impossible to effect a change.
. The pressure on each successive Board of Education
to make places for teachers is enormous, and Direct
ors seek their offices for the sole purpose of increasing
the payroll. Some years ago the Supreme Court de
cided that the board could not dispense with the
. services of a teacher without cause. Hence the an
nual habit of dismissing large numbers of them and
filing their places with favorites had to be dispensed
with. As a substitute, the Directors have simply
added to the number without providing work for
them to do.
Under the new charter it is thought the department
will be taken out of politics. The Mayor will appoint
a Board of Education, which will practically be con
tinuous in office; that is to say. the terms of the mem
bers will expire alternately. One of the first duties
of this board will be the complete annihilation of the
present system. Exactly how the work will be done
cannot be foreshadowed; but that the public will de
mand a decrease in the expenses of the department
of from 10 to 20 per cent goes without saying.
If the present system should continue for a while
Irnger it would swamp the taxpayers.
BARE FIST POLITICS.
TWO Alameda politicians have just had a six
round contest with bare knuckles, their object
being to settle some mooted question which the
campaign did not seem to have adjusted satisfactorily.
Whether the disputed point is any clearer now is not
certain, but both of the fighters were bruised and one
of them was licked. Out of evil may come good.
Perhaps the plan is not so bad as it seems at first
glance. Every campaign is marked by more or less
bickering and punctuated by the dull thud of the hos
tile ward-workers fist. This tends to make of the
polls a place of disorder, unpleasant for the quiet
citizen who prefers not to hit nor be hit, nor yet a
wit. less in the Police Court. If the scrappers would
consent to deter their scrapping until after the count
ing of the ballots and then retire to a secluded barn,
there to arrive at conclusions, the public weal would
be promoted.
To be sure, there is a law against fighting; but as
nobody pays any attention to it and husky tribes of
pugilists make a business of defying it. while the
world looks on and bets, there is no reason why a
politician who knows his enemy needs thumping and
who in all probability needs thumping himself should
be denied the privilege of getting into the ring and
being knocked out of it.
REFORMER DELONY.
WHEN a public official has a large yearning to
elevate the morals of his fellow-men; when he
begs nis colleagues to stand by him and gets
from them that which is known in political purity
circles as the "trim down," the case is a sad one. It
causes us to ask anew, "Whither are we drifting?"
and once more to view with alarm.
Supervisor Delany, his heart swelled with appre
hension for the public good, his pocket possibly
lightened through having tried to wipe out gambling
b> tackling it in its lair, sought to deal it a statutory
death-blow, and the blow lias glanced. People still
gamble. They buy chips and squander them. They
buy pasteboards from a poolseller, and a little later,
looking at these scraps ruefully, toss them into the
gutter. In fact, they refuse to know when they are
well off or to recognize the sincere and saintly ardor
of the man who would clear temptation from their
paths so as to enable them to save their money for
bread and potatoes. It isn't right to give Delany the
laugh, while to offer to lay wagers that he has been
making a bluff is little short of crime.
,vUtah made a mistake in sending a polygamist to
Congress. That body is not perfect, but it is a stick
ler for appearances.
I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, IS9B.
THESE CUMBER THE EARTH-
IF there is any specimen of the human race who is
useless and annoying he is the pugilist. The aver
age prize-fighter has no redeeming traits. He will
not even fight. If he were sincere in his protestations
of desire to match his prowess against that of others
of his kind much might be forgiven him. But he is
above all else a liar and a fraud. He has no wish to
enter a contest on his physical merits. When he goes
into the ring it is with the understanding that he is
to win or that he is to lose, and the purse has been
divided in advance.
We do not wish to defend prize-fighting, even if it
were to be conducted fairly. At the best it would be a
miserable business, without legitimate excuse. For
a man to have a fair knowledge of the art of self
defense is not a bad idea. If he never has occasion
to call his ability into active demonstration, there is
health in the necessary exercise. But the man who
makes a business of "fighting" is of necessity a brute,
and by rapid gradations becomes a swindler. The
average '"pug" is by instinct a vagrant and a tramp.
He will not work. Criminals are his associates. He
is willing to be defeated if he can secure a share of
the gate receipts. He ought to be in jail or breaking
rock on the highway.
If recollection is not at fault, Sullivan was the only
decent fighter this country has had in recent years,
and the only element of decency about him was that
he was ready to meet any foe and put up the best bat
tle he could. Corbett met and defeated him. In those
days Corbett was a giant in strength and a marvel of
agility, graceful as a leopard and like a lion for cour
age. He had not learned the tricks of the ignoble
trade. To-day Corbett is a wreck of his former self.
Sharkey, a simian-browed deck-scrubber, never
fought a fair fight and never will. They are a pair of
fakers, and they are as good as the best.
That a pair of rowdies, ready to swindle the public.
should be capable of attracting so much attention is
a disgrace to the nation. Everybody knew in advance
that the contest would be a sham. Everybody rea
lized that even if not a sham it was a matter of no
more consequence than a bar-room brawl. Yet from
sea to sea the public flocked to the bulletin boards,
and in every city the poolsellers made unholy money.
The ideal prize-fight is yet to occur. Occasionally
a pugilist is killed in the ring, which is a good thing
so far as it goes. In the ideal prize-fight a Corbett
and a Sharkey will exchange mutually fatal blows.
Perhaps Sharkey can whip Corbett; perhaps not. In
any event, no matter. The women who quarrel across
the alley fence and are ultimately led into the Police
Court to explain are of more consequence.
We favor an utter suppression of prize-fighting, the
conviction of every pugilist as a vagrant. They would
be bad enough if honest. As a set of confidence-men
they utterly exhaust the patience. Morally they rank
with the purveyors of gold bricks. That they should
be petted and pampered and tolerated by the police is
a reflection on the common intelligence.
THE EFFECT OF CARTOONS.
A CORRESPONDENT of the New York Times,
who claims to be a social philosopher as well
as a student of politics, has reached the con
clusion that the election of Theodore Roosevelt was
due to the cartoons of the Democratic press repre
senting him as a wild, ranting cowboy, riding a buck
ing broncho, loaded up with whisky and bowie-knives
and waving pistols and lariats around his head in
promiscuous confusion.
His argument is that these cartoons had no effect
upon any one except young men who had just come
of age. Fresh from their youthful reading of Dead
wood Dick, Red-Handed Bill, the Bandit of Bloody
Gulch, and other thrilling tales of a like character,
the cartoons appealed to their love of adventure.
Their excited imaginations saw in Roosevelt the ideal
fighter from the headwaters of Bitter Creek, and
every one of them worked for him, shouted for him
and voted for him.
From the standpoint of this view of the effect of
cartoons it might be argued that the election of Gage
in this State was due to the votes of barbers and bald
headed men. The pictures of the Republican candi
date with a mass of hair waving above him like a
sunburst of luminous beams above a mountain-top
must have appealed to every barber who wished a job
of hair-cutting and to every man with a billiard-ball
cranium who wished for hair to cover it.
Possibly also the great Republican victory of 1896
may have been due to that cartoon representing Mark
Hanna in a suit of clothes spangled all over with dol
lar-marks. In those hard times, when every man was in
need of money, many an impecunious cuss must have
felt strongly attracted to this citizen, who, starting
with nothing, had become so rich that he not only had
his pockets full of coin but could wear hundred-dollar
checks on his trousers and his coat. To many a voter
that picture must have seemed a representation of the
ideal American, and they voted for him because he
looked like an image of prosperity on a monument
smiling at poverty.
Imagination reels in an attempt to depict what a
dizzy landslide of votes would occur if the next time
Belva Lockwood or any of her sister suffragists runs
for the Presidency she should be depicted as a ballet
dancer tickling the jocund earth with one pirouetting
toe while its light fantastic fellow pointed to the
eternal stars. There would be no stopping either the
young voters or the old boys. Youth would be fired
and age enraptured. The country would be very
nearly unanimous.
The conclusion of the whole matter is that the car
toon is a boomerang. It is as likely to come back as
to go forward. The grave and serious American is,
after all, the most humorous of men, and there is no
telling how a picture may appeal to him. It pleases
him to depict his revered Uncle Sam not as an up-to
date man of the world, as he is, but as a clock
peddling Yankee of a hundred years ago. So it
seems the American not only likes caricatures but
likes the men who are caricatured. At any rate, the
effect of a cartoon is clearly one of the things "you
can't most always sometimes tell."
While boys are prone to get into mischief, there is
nothing to show that one of them, for playing on the
sidewalks, merits the severe punishment of being
killed. The tipping over of a box of goods resulting
in the death of a lad was a sad affair. Possibly the
victim had no business there; yet the sidewalks are
provided for people rather than for the storage of
merchandise, and if merchandise is to be piled there,
certainly the fashion of piling .so as to produce fatal
ities should be rigidly discouraged.
It is worth while finding out the brutal wretch who
sent a dead babe to the garbage crematory. He or
she deserves to be sent to one of the repositories
society has provided for human garbage. .;

WORSE WEATHER THON OURS.
OUR dry weather and fair skies this late in the
fall are not wholly pleasing to vs â even the
few showers that have fallen have not satisfied
vs â and the voice of the complainer is heard in the
land. Nevertheless, when reports are read of the
weather in the East it is probable the most dolorous of
Californians will comfort himself in- the sunny days
and rejoice that he is not smitten by the blasts that
rage beyond the Rockies.
The fall weather has been unusually severe over the
entire eastern portion of the country. Snowstorms
here and there and occasional blizzards were reported
as early as October, and now the winter seems to
have come down upon them in earnest. A cold wave,
accompanied by high winds and snow, starting from
the Rocky Mountains, has swept over the East and
carried suffering, destruction and death with it.
The sweep and range of the storm were enormous.
Beginning along the line of the mountains and ex
tending from Dakota to Texas, the blasts continued
with a scarcely mitigated severity across the conti
nent to New York and disappeared upon the Atlantic.
From every portion of that wide area come reports of
disaster. Hardly any locality north of Mason and
Dixon's line seems to have escaped the effect of the
wave.
So heavy was the snow that railroads were block
aded, and in some cities streetcars were stopped. The
telephone and telegraph service was crippled. Busi
ness was seriously interfered with and nearly all in
dustries more or less injured. Nor did the disaster
end with damage to property. Even in the large cities
persons were found frozen to death in the streets, and
there can be little doubt that when reports come in
from the rural districts it will be found that many
perished on the bleak prairies or the desolate plains
ever which the storm raged unchecked.
In comparison with the disasters of weather like
this the drought in California can hardly be accounted
a serious evil. The damage done to property by the
single blizzard that has opened the Eastern winter
has probably entailed a greater loss in one fierce
sweep than was inflicted upon California by tlie
drought during the whole season. Certainly, with
such reports from the East, we have no good reason
for complaining of our weather. Moreover, as the
winter comes in and progresses we shall have further
cause to be satisfied with California. Too many fair
dnys are, of course, not to be desired, but they are
better than too many blizzards.
FINANCIAL REFORM NECESSARY.
IT is well not to lose sight of the pledge of
financial reform and the immediate necessity for
its redemption. The measures have been well
digested, and the next Congress should lose no time
in their consideration.
The only way in which the case is to be closed
against the fiatists is by legislation. The need of a
better currency banking system than we have now is
felt at all times and in all conditions of trade. Of
course, its weakness is not so apparent in good times
as in bad; but that weakness is one of the causes of
bad times, and the system contributes nothing to
good times, which come in spite of it.
We have heretofore shown the complex nature of
our financial system* â a mosaic of emergency legisla
tion. It can best be reformed when the"re is no emer
gency. It began during the Civil War, when the
Government was driven to any and every expedient
in a struggle for its existence. The devices to which
a man resorts to avert destruction are never such as
he calmly adopts in promotion of his interests when
no danger is present. The same rule is true of na
tions, and yet we have adhered to expedients and
systems which were adopted to avert national death.
It is time to return to the ways of life in our finances.
The banking system proposed is largely that so
long known and successfully administered in Scotland
and in Canada. It contemplates the extinction of the
national debt and the end of using Government bonds
as the basis of a safe paper currency. It provides for
the gradual substitution of bank assets and the lia
bility of stockholders as the security of circulation
and, by arranging the taxation' of such currency on a
sliding scale, guards against inflation. The country
will never willingly return to State banks of issue.
The convenience of a national system, with its cur
rency of uniform value, will not be given up by the
peor-le. The new system* proposed is, therefore, na
tional, under constant authorized official oversight.
All the banks contribute a redemption fund to secure
the bills of any bank that may fail, and if this ever
prove insufficient the Government will assess all the
solvent banks to replenish it and keep the fund equal
to any demand upon it.
The system has every feature of security and adap
tation to the public needs that the soundest State
banking ever had; therefore the advocates of State
banks of issue cannot find a valid objection to it.
Those banks- issued a convenient paper currency,
which became a redeemable medium of exchange,
based upon bank assets.
If Indiana, New York, lowa and Illinois could suc
cessfully administer such a system, as they did before
the war, there is no valid reason why the Federal
Government should not do it now. The vast accu
mulation of experience in the running of a national
system also stands the Government in good stead, and
is reflected in the guarantees and security added in
the proposed change.
The great purpose of it is to put -the surplus loan
fund where the farmer and planter may have as cheap
'and easy access to it and as economical use of his
credit as the merchant or manufacturer. There is
some reason why there should be a difference in the
rate of interest between New York and Texas, but
there is no good reason why that difference should be
as. great as it is.
To approximate the rates of interest exacted for the
use of money and more nearly equalize it between the
trading and manufacturing centers and the producing
districts in the country is one of the great objects to
be accomplished by this legislation.
When the system is put in operation its existence
â¢will not depend upon the payment of the national
debt and consequent withdrawal of bonds, as is the
case with the present national banks.
A condemned murderer, sentenced to life imprison
ment in Canada, alleges as a plea for pardon that he
is an English Lord. It is not easy to see what bear
ing this has on the matter. If it have any at all it
should be in the direction of making the sentence
more severe, which obviously would be difficult.
Disinclination on the part of the courts to show
mercy to highbinders is a little late in putting in an
appearance. Highbinders are not particularly given
to mercy themselves. They deserve the judicial
hatchet.
An explanation of the hiring of Chinese for the

same on all lines, but from Ogden to this
city on the Central Pacific the questions
that are asked with the expectation of
receiving an intelligent reply are so nu
merous and, to some extent, so absurd
that the answering of them all would
plant gray hairs in an ordinary mortal's

me in answering such queries as
'What's the name of that river?' 'What
mountain is that?' and others, but when
some of the travelers want to know
'Whose house is that?' 'Do all those
children in the yard belong to that lady
who is waving her hand to us?' '.What
is that man's name and is he married?'
and many others of like tenor I gave the
task up as hopeless and turned my in
quiring friends over to the porter, who
began to wrestle with the situation after
casting a reproachful look on me.
"He sthuggled for about an hour and
was doing the best he knew how when
one of his interlocutors, a lady who had
been worrying him half to death,
said, 'What was the name of that sta

"The porter replied, 'That was Orton,
ma'am; it's a deserted sheep station.'
" 'Well, don't we stop there?' said the

THE MISSION
HIGH SCHOOL
WELL HEATED
Fifteen Furnaces in
the Basement.
GLARING FRAUDS UNEARTHED
CRIMINAL RECKLESSNESS IN
PURCHASE OF FURNITURE.
Superintendent "Webster Makes an
Inspection and Finds Evidence
of Jobbery at Every
Turn.
There appears to be any quantity of
trouble in store for the members of the
Board of Education over the building and
furnishing of the Mission High School, a
large proportion of which will come when
they attempt to explain their connection
with the job to the Grand Jury.
Bills for many thousands of dollars are
awaiting payment by the board, in which
are included a large amount on account of
the Mission High School, and if all these
bills are paid the board will go out of of
fice leaving a deficiency of not less than
$180,000.
It was for the purpose of looking into
the justice of these bills before signing
them that Superintendent Webster, ac
companied by Deputy Superintendent
Stone, made a tour of inspection of the
new school building yesterday morning.
Bills for furniture and supplies amounting
approximately to $20,000 are awaiting pay
ment, and Mr. Webster determined to sat
isfy himself of their accuracy. The two
officials went over the entire building,
from basement to garret, and their dis
coveries caused them to gasp in astonish
ment. Not being expert architects or
builders they could not tell, of course,
whether the building had been put up ac
cording to specifications, but they did iind
many things that "were not as they should
be. For instance, the beard sought to ac
cept the building as cornjiieted two weeks
ago, but for some reason failed to do so.
Now, the specifications provide that the
walls shall be sand finished and tinted,
but the tinting has been dispensed with,
and the rough, dull gray walls are any
thing but pleasing to the eye.
Down in the basement, however, is
where the inspectors were most deeply In
terested, for the most extravagant and
complex system of heating that probably
ever went into any building has been put
in. No less than fifteen furnaces, scat
tered throughout the basement, were
counted, while the splendid area is ruined
by the multitude of steam, water and air
pipes that extend in every direction, at all
elevations. Many of them are so low that
one has to bend nearly double to pass un
der them, although it would have been as
easy to put them all high enough to allow
the pupils free range of the basement.
Why fifteen furnaces, or a third of that
number, are necessary to heat that build
ing is something- Messrs. Webster and
Stope are still pondering over.
Principal O Connor complained, and
justly, too, that the school is sadly lack
ing in many articles that are absolutely
necessary to the health and comfort of
the pupils. As an illustration, not a
single shade has been provided for the
windows and the children are obiliged
to tax their eyes in the glare of the sun
without any prospect of relief.
Yet up in the "practical" department
the board has put in thirty solid oak
standing desks at a cost of $18 25 each, but
they have never been used and are not
likely to be for some time, because the
board refuses to employ a teacher for that
branch; $547 50 tied up in useless and ex
pensive furniture, while the eyes of sev
eral hundred school children are being
ruined for proper window shades.
And then the price of those desks is
to be carefully inquired into. Weber &
Co. had the contract for furnishing them
at $18 25 each. They sublet the contract
for making them to a Shotwell-street
firm, and it has been freely asserted that
a practical cabinet maker has offered to
duplicate them in every particular for
$7 50 each.
Then up in the auditorium Messrs.
Webster and Stone found 1003 handsome
opera chairs, which cost the city $3 i 5
each. Now the auditorium is convenient
for the occasional assemblage of all the
classes for entertainments and the like,
but that there was any urgent necessity
for fitting it up when the School Depart
ment is bankrupt, not even the Directors
who voted for this useless waste of money
will dare assert.
In the physical laboratory auditorium
the inspectors found another instance of
what they mildly termed extravagance.
The place, which may in time be required
to accommodate a class of thirty-five or
forty pupils, is supplied with 208 combina
tion chairs and tables of elaborate de
sign, with springs, hinges, hooks and
what not, that must necessarily be ex
pensive. Not half of them will ever be
occupied at one time.
The drawing department is most beau
tifully fitted up: it is said there is noth
ing like it on the coast. It has thirty
elaborate drawing tables supplied with
every convenience and the most expensive
materials obtainable.
When all the supplies for the chemistry
and physical department that have been
ordered have arrived, it will be as conf
plete as the most exacting professor could
ask. Bills for $2600 worth of apparatus
and supplies have already been allowed,
while bills amounting to $2900 are waking
to be signed, and there is a quantity of
stuff coming from Europe, the bills for
which are yet to come in.
So it was throughout the building
Webster and Stone found all the furniture
the city had been charged for, but some
of It was \mavallable for the present,
much more entirely useless and all show
ed the most reckless extravagance in its
purchase.
PROSPECTORS FOOLED.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of Joseph.
Arthur tor Obtaining Money
by False Pretenses.
A warrant was sworn out in Judge Jo
achimsen's court yesterday for the arrest
of Joseph Arthur on a charge of obtain
ing money by false pretenses.
The complaining witnesses are E. Mld
dlecoff and George Black, prospectors.
They were prospecting in the Northwest
with some others and last spring went
to Seattle, where they met Arthur. He
told them of the location of a rich gravel
mine in British Columbia and got them
to accompany him to locate it. They
wandered around for some time and final
ly Arthur admitted that he was at fault,
but he knew a Captain Hill living in
Oakland who knew its exact location.
Arthur took a fancy to Mlddlecoff and
Black and told them that if they would
pay his expenses to Oakland he would
introduce them to his friend Captain
Hill. They arrived here on November 10
and they provided Arthur with a new
suit of clothes and gave him money so
he could make a presentable appearance
to Captain Hill. Arthur kept them on the
string for several days by various Bles
and finally arranged a meeting with Cap
tain Hill at 2061 Central avenue, Alameda.
They went there, but neither Captain
Hill nor Arthur was known to the people.
Then they concluded they had been swin
dled.
Embezzled Diamonds.
M. Bravalatsky. a watchmaker at 289
Seventh street, swore to a complaint In
Judge Mogan's court yesterday for the ar
rest of to. Garten on a charge of felony
embezzlement. On November 18 he gave
Garten a pair of diamond earrings valued
at $110 a diamond pin valued at $60 and a.
gold pin valued at $9 to dispose of and
he alleges that Garten has appropriated
the articles to his own uses and purposes.
Accused of Forgery.
John Anderson, who the police allege
is John Nelson, was booked at the City
Prison yesterday by Detectives Dillon and
Crockett on a charge of forgery. He was
released on $500 bonds. About two years
ago Fred Albrecht, a half-interest swin
dler, John Lundin and John Nelson went
to Mrs. Emma Dorn, a saloon-keeper at 32
Spear street, and made overtures to pur
chase her saloon. They gave her a check
for $600 and got a number of drinks on
the strength .of it. The check proved to
be forged and Albrecht and Lundin were
arrested. Albrecht got clear but Lundin
â¢was sentenced to three years in San Quen
tln. _

Smith received a majority of 4000 that
means that he received 4000 more votes
than the aggregate of the votes cast for
all other candidates for the same office.
If there was but one candidate against
him it would be proper to say that he
received a majority of 4000. If it is said
that he was elected by a plurality of vMi
that means that he "received 4000 more
votes than the next highest candidate for
the same office, there being more than
two running.
ALWAYS GIVE THE COUNTYâ To
Correspondents. When an individual
writes a letter and dates It at the place
in which he is, he should always add
the name of the county to the name of
the place, as often there are several
places of the same name in a State. A
few days since a correspondent of thl3
department wrote for information, and
inclosing a stamp requested that the an
swer be sent by mail. After giving his
name he Simply added "French Camp,
California." The letter was sent as per
direction, but it may be some time before
the correspondent receives it, as the
Postal Department may have to send it
to each of the following places of the
same name before the party Is reached.
There is French Camp in Amador County,
French Camp, in Butte County, French
Cnmp in San Joaquin County and French
Camp in Siskiyou County.
FOR THE NAVAL ACADEMYâ H. M.
J., College Park, Santa Clara County.
Cal. There is no regularly appointed and
fixed board of examiners to examine can
didates for admission to the Naval Acad
emy at Annapolis, nor are sample, ex
amination papers given out. When a Rep
resentative from one of the Congressional
districts is notified by the Secretary of
the Navy that thtre" is a vacancy in his
district, and that it is his turn to nomi
nate a candidate for the academy, if
there is to be a competitive examination,
he calls upon educators in his district to
act as a board of examiners for the pur
pose of ascertaining who, among the boys
who present themselves, will acquire the
highest and second highest percentage.
The names of these two are sent to the
office of the Secretary of the Navy, the
one having the highest percentage being
the nominee and the other the alternate.
Bright boys with an eye to the future
generally go to Washington, D. C, where
they place themselves under some retired
navy officer who will instruct or prepare
them for the examination they will have
to take at the academy, as they know
what the general course of examination ia,
but they do not know what the specific
line of questions win be. Such boys learn
as much as possible in the line of sub
jects in which they are to be examined.
When there is no competitive examina
tion the Representative simply selects the
candidate and alternate and sends in
the names. When there is to be a com
petitive examination the fact is made
known through thp papers in the district,
and those who wish have an opportunity
to appear before the board.

"It makes no difference who tells me to
talk, whether it Is my attorneys or any
one else. I will answer no questions nor
niuke any statements. I have talked too
â much already and am sorry for it."
The foregoing was the answer of Mrs.
Albert Brandes, who is supposed to have
I the death of her stepdaughter,
Lillian, by the administration of a brutal
g, to the suggestion of Attorney
Bennett that she tell what had led up to
the trai
Mrs. Brandes was in a chronic lachry
oondition and had a tear-3oaked
handkerchief pressed to her nose. She
also had tears in her voice and seemed to
eatly alarmed at her situation, the
durances of her attorneys that
she was in no danger not sufficing to
allay her fears.
"1 broke my word with my attorneys
t"-day," continued the woman regret
fully. "A lady came in here and cried on
my neck and said how sorry she was for
me, and 1 talked to her. Now I wish
1 hadn't. So that settles it," and she
turned to her attorneys, Bennett and
r, for consolation. "I wan asked,"
continued the frightened prisoner, "If I
had killed Lillian, and I replied:
" "No. For (Jud'.s sake, you don't think
1 could do such a thing. 1
"Then 1 was asked if my husband did
it. and 1 said:
" 'He could no more commit such a
crime than I could.'
"Aftei; that I told just what had hap
pened. About the. trouble with Lillianâ
the whipping and her falling down stairs
and bruising herself; also that it was iwo
days after the trouble and she had been
around us usual that she strangled her-
Ther^- was no harm in saying that,
was there?" turning to Attorney Sawyer.
".No," replied the latter, "we only want
you to keep from getting excited when
you testify to-night."
"Well, what am 1 to say?" asked Mrs.
Brandes in an alarmed voice.
"You are to tell the truth. It is not
necessary for you to make a voluntary
ment, You simply answer questions
and tell the facts as affairs happened," re
plied Attorney Sawyer. "If you do this
no harm will come to you and we will
have you out of this trouble in short
order."
"Oh. heavens, do you really think so?
Then I will do my best to obey orders and
be calm, tor God knows these tttings they
say about me are not true; but I am so
nervousâ so nervous."
More tears, followed by encouraging
words from her lawyers and she ttnany
quieted down and listened to further in
structions as to how to conduct herself at
the inquest.
"The way the public are viewing this
affair," said Attorney Bennett, "is aJI
wrong. They are trying to make anoth
er. Durrant case of it. but it won't go. We
will promptly show that there is nothing
in the murder theory, and if they are not
exonerated by the Coroner's jury to-night
wi will have this woman and her husband
out on habeas corpus to-morrow without
doubt.
"The facts of the tragedy are these:
Mrs. Brandt s received $15 from Brandes to
send the girl to a convent, but she did
not want to go. She stole the money and
refused to surrender it. You know what
a row of this kind between women is.
The girl resisted punishment; the mother
whipped her severely, and the girl finally
fell down stairs. That's where she got
lises.
â¢This theory about beating her to death
Is all rot. Why, the girl was around as
visual for two days after the whipping,
and made no complaint of her Injuries. In
Bhe was out in the yard on the sec
ond day and borrowed 50 cents from a
man who was passing by. At that time
she was as lively as usual.
"The whole thing in a nutshell is that
the unfortunate girl was rebellious, an
gered at the punishment she had received
and determir.f-d that she would not go
to the convent. The result was, she de
liberately made her preparations and
strangled herself. That she was not beat
en to death, as is alleged, is proved by
the fact that a man occupied the ad
joining room and heard no disturbance at
the time the girl expired. There you are
and no murder can be shown In the case "
It is evident that the people of Berkeley
did not accept the views of the attorneys
for the prisoners, a fact that was made
very evident to Sheriff "White during the
afternoon. Messages were sent to him by

THE SIMPLEST CURE FOR
INDIGESTION,
As Well as the Safest and Cheapest.
The new medical discovery, Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, digest the food in-
stead of making the worn-out stomach
do all the work, give it a much needed
rest, and a cure of dyspepsia is the
natural result.
You get nourishment and rest at the
same time because these tablets will
thoroughly digest all wholesome food
taken into the stomach whether the
stomach works or not. A cure is cer-
tain to result because the digestive
organs are given a chance to rest and
recover their natural vigor and tone.
The Tablets are then no longer re-
quired. . â¢

remedy acts on different people and
how quickly and effectually it cures

him that the people of the college town
were in a dangerous temper, and had de

he were taken to the inquest.
"I suppose it is some of the irresponsi

visited my office and told me that the
best element of the place is involved and

then announced that he would follow
these Instructions and not take any
chances unless he received subsequent or
ders.
BRANDES CHARGED
WITH MURDER
His Wife Made an Accessory by
the Coroner's Jury.
BERKELEY, Nov. 22.â After fifteen
â¢ minutes' deliberation last night the Cor
oner's jury in the Brandes case brought
in a verdict charging William A. Brandes
j â¢with murdering his 13-year-old daughter
i and making his wife an accessory to the
crime. Neither Brandes nor his wife
were present at the inquest. The authori
ties feared they would be summarily
dealt with if they were brought within
reach of the ominous gathering which
thronged the streets here all day.
As the hour approached for holding the
inquest an immense crowd collected in
front of the morgue, evidently waiting for I
the appearance of the alleged murderers.
Sheriff White had been informed that an
attempt to hang Brandes would surely
be made If he was brought to Berkeley. I
Coroner Baldwin, also heard that all
preparations for a lynching iutu been
made, and when he saw the crowd and
heard some of the expressions flying
about he immediately telephoned the
Sheriff not to bring the defendants to the
inquest.
Hundreds of men and a score of women
fought almost wickedly for admittance, to
the inquest room. A solid mass of hu
manity was packed in and about the
morgue doors, and the jurors and officials
only gained admission after a desperate
struggle. Seven special constables were
detailed to hold the crowd in check, but
they were absolutely powerless. When the
doors opened the room was filled in an
instant, and by order of the Coroner the
doors were locked, leaving scores on the
outside who noisily clamored for admit
tance.
The inquest began shortly after 8
o'clock and was conducted by Coroner R.
O. Baldwin. District Attorney Allen was
present, and assisted the Coroner in the
examination of witnesses. Following
were the jurors: Henry C. Barrows, D.
w rP'fiV **â  M " McNulty, W. J. Mortimer,
W. D. Wooster, Washington Wilson. Har
i' >' W aterbury Thomas Harm, L. P.
Meinhert and C. H. Townsend. After
viewing the remains the jurors took their
seats and the inquiry began.
W. J. Richardson and wife and Lewis
Long told of overhearing a fracas in
Brandes' house last Tuesday night
Brandes was beating Lillian arid accus
ing her of stealing some money. They
heard the child's pitiful pleadings- for
mercy and protestations of innocence.
The beating ceased for a few moments
and Brandes played a tune on the piano.
Then he again whipped Lillian. Finally
the noise ceased and nothing further oc
curred that night. On Wednesday, the
day following the beating, the Richard
sons saw Lillian digging around the yard
from Â»a. m. till 4 p. m. That was the last
time they saw her alive. The Richard
son home is only a few feet from
Brandes' nouse.
Mrs. M. Godfrey of Piedmont, an ac
quaintance of the Brandes', was visiting
at the house on that Tuesday evening.
She corroborated the testimony of the
first three witnesses. While Brandes was
beating his child Mrs. Brandes sat in the
parlor with her guest. Brandes told Mrs.
Godfrey that Lillian had stolen some
money, and he was trying to force her to
tell where she had hidden it. Mrs. Bran
des added that Lillian was a thief, a liar
and a nuisance. '..Â».-â¢
J. S. Harvey, Brandes' assistant as
night watchman, told of the daily life in
the Brandes home, where he had lived
since July up to last Saturday morning.
He said the child was frequently abused,
and once last week the brutal father came
home at 1 a. m., got the child out of bed
and beat her with something which sound
ed as if the blows were administered with
a slipper.
He could not remember what night that
was. He last saw the girl alive Friday at
dinner time, between 5 and 7. Saturday
morning Harvey got to bed at 5 o'clock,
and about 8 o'clock Brandes awoke him
and said Lillian had taken poison and
hanged herself. Harvey did not enter the
child b bedroom, but advised the father to
go for the nearest physician. Harvey then
dressed himself and took the first train
for the city, because, as he said, he did
not wish to be mixed up in the affair.
Dr j George F. Whitworth. who was
called by Brandes, testified that he went
to the house and found the girl dead,
stretched out on her bed. He saw an
apron tied to the bedpost, which Brandes
told him the girl had used to hang herself
with. He believed Brandes and made no
critical examination of the body or the
room.
Dr. S. H. Buteau, the autopsy sur
geon, swore that the girl's death was not
oaused by asphyxiation or poison, but
that she died from the effect of wounds
on the head which were evidently inflict
ed with a blunt, smooth surfaced, flexi
ble instrument. Brandes' club was shown
the doctor and he said such an Instru
ment might have been used. Dr. J S
Eastman rorroborated the autopsy sur
geon's testimony.
Coroner Baldwin then closed the in
quest and cleared the room, leaving the
Jury to deliberate. In about fifteen min
utes the following verdict signed by all
the jurors was handed to the Coroner,
who also signed it:
"We, the jury, find that Lillian
Brandes, aged about 13, came to
her death some time between
8:30 p. m. November 18 and
8:30 a. m. November 19, 1898,
and that death was caused by
injuries on the head inflicted by a
blun,t instrument in the hands of .W.
A. Brandes; and we hereby charge
said Brandes with the crime of mur
der, and his wife with being acces
sory thereto." .
BRANDES HEARS THE VERDICT.
OAKLAND. Nov. 22.â When Brandes
was Informed that the Coroner's jury
charged him with murder he appeared
stolid and indifferent, very much as
though he had expected nothing else.
"I have nothing more to say, he re
marked," "and I expect my enemies will
spare no efforts to railroad me.'
It was not deemed advisable to inform
Mrs Brandes of the result of the inquest,
and the fact that she is charged with
complicity in the crime. She is still in a
highly nervous state and will not be dis
turbed until to-morrow morning, when
she will- be fully advised.

WEALTHY, YET A THIEF.
Charles Holderer Deliberately Stole a Fifty-
Cent Can of Lard Rather Than
Pay For It
Although possessing 180 acres of valuable land in his own right Charles
I Holderer. rather than draw upon hi s own exchequer to buy the necessa
) ries of life, yesterday afternoon stole a 50-cent can of lard from a restau
i rant at 135 Ellis street. He was detected by the cashier, who promptly
i summoned Policeman Keyes.
I Holderer had the can of lard secreted under his coat, and as the officer
: entered he handed him the stolen property. He waa then taken to the City
i Prison and charged with petty larceny.
i Holderer's valuable possessions are in Santa Clara County. He arrived
i in the city several days ago and after claiming he was in need of work
i was given employment in the restaurant where he was arrested. Shortly
after 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon he announced his intention of "throwing
i up the job," and started to leave the place. The cashier noticed a suspi
i clous looking package under his coat and, seizing him by the collar, asked
i him for an explanation.
I Holderer readily admitted his guilt and begged not to be arrested. De
spite his entreaties Policeman Keyes was summoned and the rich culprit
was taken into custody. To a reporter the prisoner said he stole the lard,
as he intended to use it after he returned to his ranch.
"It is true that I own valuable land in Santa Clara County," he re
marked. "As everything points to a dry season I concluded to visit this
city in the hope of procuring employment. I went to work in the restau
rant expecting to remain only a few days. The work did not agree with
me and I resolved to quit. As I was about to leave I saw the can of lard
on a shelf and could not resist the temptation to steal it. After I had se
creted it under my coat the cashier held me up and forced me to disgorge
the stolen property. I don't know why I stole the stuff, as I could have
bought several cans with the amount I had earned as waiter, ll the police
will only give me a chance I intend to return to my ranch and never leave
It again."
The arresting officer says that considerable silverware has disappeared
from the restaurant since the employment of Holderer and he is inclined
to believe that the prisoner stole it. He will be held pending further inves
tigation.

Decoyed Away From His Home, Ho
Is Forced to Disgorge Under
Penalty of Being
Shot.
John Sweeney, who conducts the Es- I
mond lodging house, at 43 Sixth street,
was held up by four men in front of the
Cafe Zinkand on Market street early yes
terday morning and robbed of a pistol and
a small amount of money. According to
his story he received a telephone message
saying that he was wanted by Detective
Egan on important business. Sweeney,
whose career as the "go between" for
bunko men was one time thoroughly ex
ploited in The Call, lost no time in repair
ing to the trysting place. As he was
about to enter he was attacked by four
men, who were evidently waiting for him*
They quickly seized him and after threat
ening to kill him if he made an outcry,
proceeded to relieve him of his money and
valuables. After taking his pistol and
money one of the men saw a policeman
walking on the other side of the street,
and becoming alarmed he informed his
companions. They at once released their
hold on Sweeney and ordered him to
"skip," under penalty of being riddled
with bullets.
Sweeney lost no time in complying with
their request, evidently satisfied to get
away with his life. Yesterday he told a i
police officer of the hold-up, but refused to
have the robbers arrested.
"They are all friends of mine." he re
marked. "I suppose they wanted to have
some fun with me."
For some time past Sweeney has boasted
of his "pull" with the Police Judges, and
unless the members of the "sure thing"
fraternity consulted him before "turning
a trick" it is said he would Inform the
police He even claimed that he could in
fluence Chief Lees not to molest the
horde of grafters who infest the city, pro
viding they "squared" him.
Last Monday four of the gang were ar
rested and charged with vagrancy. They
claimed that they had r&fused to "divide

with them he had Detective Egan throw
them in jail.
Determined to be revenged, the friends
of the prisoners conceived the bold plan
of holding up the alleged informer. Know
ing that Sweeney was on intimate terms
with Detective Egan, the men telephoned
to him. claiming that he was wanted by
the well-known sleuth on Important busi
ness. Sweeney readily fell into the trap
and immediately repaired to the Cafe
Zinkand.
That he recognized his assailants the
police have no doubt, but fearing further
violence at their hands he refused to have
them arrested.

EXPERT KILPATRICK
COMPLAINS OF WELCH
THE SCHOOL BOARD'S SECRE
TARY SCORED.
Grand Jury Orders Welch to De
liver All Bills to the
Expert.
The Grand Jury held a short session
last evening, hearing no witnesses, but
receiving a communication from Judge
Belcher, in which he commended the jur
ors for their faithfulness and stated that
he should continue the present Grand
Jury in office until the last of December.
The ' Judge stated that School Board mat
ters needed special attention. He hoped
that the jury would devote plenty of time
to -the bills of the board and also to the
proceedings of the Buildings and Grounds
Committee.
It developed during the session that
Expert Kilpatrick was having consider
able trouble in securing access to all of
the bills of the School Board. He com
plained that Secretary "Welch was acting
as an obstructionist and had taken away
from him a large batch of bills which
had been unearthed on the allegation that
the Finance Committee of the board had
not as yet passed on the bills. On the re
quest of Kilpatrick the jury prepared a
special letter to Secretary Welch, in
structing him in explicit language to turn
over to the expert all bills and accounts
of the School Board, including the bills
which had not been approved as yet by
the Finance Committee. This letter will
be presented to Welch to-day.
"We don't like the way in which Secre
tary Welch is acting," remarked one of
the jurymen. "He seems to be trying to
shield those fellows in the School Board
who are guilty of rascality. As soon as
we are through with the bills we shall
devote considerable attention to the
school-book question and incidentally to
the pull which Weber & Co seem to have
with the board."
The Grand Jury adjourned to meet next
Tuesday evening, when it is expected that
the report of Expert Kilpatrick will be
presented, and aggressive measures can
be Inaugurated looking to the finding of
several Indictments.

NEW. YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says, under date
of November 17: .
"Raisins come forward freely, but there !
are few orders being placed now. Most ,
forward shipments are on previously placed ,
orders, for which consignors have waited
past lie time ' specified for delivery, because j
of the" yellow fever blockade. Few orders j
lor forward are being placed now. Prices i
are firm, owing to the position of the as- |
sociation, and the reported shortage creates |
an advancing tendency in all grades. Busi- â â 
ness is upon a narrow basis, for the rea- j
soirs outlined, but prices are stiff at quota
tions there are increased mail orders,
chiefly small, evidently to nil depleted stocks
and put retailers in safe position to meet in- !
crta.sed Thanksgiving demand. Four-crown :
range at trV<Ji s ic. Malaga clusters are quoted :
at $2 25&5 25. About 4>~c is the quotation for i
two-crown.
Prunes are steady and prices virtually un- I
changed. Large sizes or very small are !
about all that are wanted. These, however, j
are unobtainable, except in small quanti- I
ties. Consequetly prices rule stiff on ail. ;
Liberal si. pments have come forward lately '
but they are said to be deliveries on previous
orders, and few changes have neen noted. De- j
mand increases at this season, reaching its j
height as the available supply of green fruit i
is at its lowest. Business in all sizes shows .
some improvement, but trade is n< more than I
Pteady. Few large orders are received, though
mall requests for small quantities are more
numerous.
Apricot* are steady, quotations ranging as i
previously reported. Export demand Is light, !
and trade for domestic consumption small. ]
Prices are too high to permit free movement. ,
Holders are firm in their views, and are de
termined to make no concessions to secure busi- ,
ness, believing that buyers must meet their j
demands for prices later. Spot supplies are
small ami trade Is narrow in consequence.
Peaches attract attention because of high
prices, but movement is small for the same
reason. Unpeeled in bags were variously quoted '
yesterday, from SV.@9c for inside figures to 12c j
for outside. In boxes quotations were 9@l3c, ]
and new peeled in boxes ranged from 20@25c." I

EASTERN MARKETS.
NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
Prices were sharply advanced at the open
ing to-day and for a number of stocks closed
near the bent. But the market In the mean
time went through a period of depression and
the bulk of the day's business â¢was done below
the best prices and in some very prominent
stocks below last night's closing prices. The
opening advance was emphasized by the dis
covery of the spurious character of yester
day's report of Senor Montero Rios' refusal to
proceed with the peace negotiations at Paris.
The bears who sold short yesterday hastened
to cover this morning, and there were be
sides a large amount of orders in commission
houses from the country at large. Rock
Island, Atchison preferred, Baltimore and Ohio,
arid lii.j Grande preferred and Norfolk
and Western preferred were up about a point,
aril Federal fc-teel, Manhattan, Tobacco and
People's (Jus rone from 1 to I*4. This sharp
advance In prices invited realizing on a very
.-â . ale. and there was, in addition, re
. heaviness in the Northwestern railroad
rtlea on revived reports of an embittered
war in progpect between Northern Pacific and
Oregon navigation and its extensive allied in
terests. There was a slackening up also In the
advances in the Grangers, probably on account
of the prevailing storm in the West. Very
marked weakness developed in the Federal
Mccl stocks, the preferred stocks dropping 2%
per cent. The reported grjund for this weak
ness is the alleged unwillingness on the part
01 some of the small financial institutions to ac
cept these newly floated securities as collateral.
There was a* very marked falling off in the
lately conspicuous movement in Atchison after
the heaviness in the general market developed
in marked degree. These special points of
weakness appealed for support to some of the
most powerful interests at this financial cen
ter and the support was forthcoming in quite
a vigorous manner toward the close of the day.
The rise in .Northern Pacific was attributed
to the large banking interest which exercises
the dominant control in the property. It was
regarded as that the stocks of other
companies which the same interest has been
dominant in reorganization or formation ad
vanced simultaneously with Northern Pacific.
Such stocks were Southern preferred which
rose to i-xtreme 2Vi, the Reading stocks, the
Krie ><u>ck<- and Federal BteeJ stocks It was
the inside support and manipulation in this
group and in Federal .Steel which rallied the
market. Incidentally there was a recovery of
2H per cent in Delaware and Hudson and of
nearly 6 points in Chicago and Alton. New
fork bank clearings ran up to-day to over
(220,000,000. The bon<l market also showed de
cided activity to-day and prices yielded at
some points, while advancing in others Total

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: . |
| The stock market here was better generally, â 
j the factors operating being the continued ea-se
i of money and the trade agreement between
; France and Italy. Italian stocks rose over 2
'â  per cent, and there was an important exchange
on London. Americans were good and closed
steady, but there was, perhaps, less activity
owing to the improvement in other markets.
The recovery in Italian stocks caused con
siderable realizations from Berlin, which is
important as placing that market in funds for
dealing in Americans or for other purposes.
Copper shares were strong, notably Anaconda,
â which was bought heavily. The money outlook
here is perplexing. The Bank of England still
borrows from the market, but the heavy ma
turity of German bills held here, and not re
newed, adds daily to the unemployed cash bal
ance. I learn on undoubted authority that a
Eehe:v:? is under discussion at Berlin for abol
ishing the tax payable by the Imperial Bank
when the note issue exceeds the fixed amount.
The idea is opposed by the best banking au
thorities. It is impossible to say whether the
proposal will be formally made or not.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 22.â The first hour and a
half in Wheat trading was marked by excep
tional dullness, and prices during that period
scarcely moved from the point at which the
market started. It seemed as if the blizzard
had frozen up all inclination to buy and sell
Wheat, and trades of any importance were re
markable for their scarcity. There was some
i selling pressure at the start, enough to cause
decline in the leading options. Early
Liverpool quotations marked a very small ad
vance. The selling, however, was apparently
almost altogether by shorts. Liverpool receipts
for the past six days ha\'e been entirely from
this country, and this and the decreasing

shipments from Russia and the Danubian
countries had evidently left a permanent im
pression on the speculative mind, :as very lit
tle long Wheat was fop sale. A remarkable
feature of the Northwest market was an ad
vance of 1 cent for caeh Wheat. ~ This was a
starter for a notable advance â " here. ' After 11
o'clock the market became active and very
strong. The blizzard was raging throughout
. I the West and Northwest and was expected to
. : result in a great falling off in receipts, and
also caused fears of an early closing of the
straights. This frightened December shorts
, and heavy buying- from that source continued
for some time, sending the December price
at one time to a premium of l%c over May. â¢
The cash situation was too strong for . ] the
market to be held down, and near the close
buying. became very .active again, the market
advancing and holding firm to the end. De
cember closed at 6S%c and May at 67%@6<%c.
The market for Corn was active throughout.
Early there was a slight dip on the theory that
tha cold weather would improve the quality of
new Corn. There were buyers for every bushel
offered, however, and the market got very
strong. â¢ May closed %Â®%c higher. â 
I Oats followed Corn closely, opening weak and
j closing strong. There was a good deal or
short selling by scalpers early in the day, and
their covering helped materially to strengthen
the market. May ranged from 26@2t>VgC ana
closed %c higher. '
Provisions, though rather quiet, were -firm
â  and closed at an advance. Packers were mod
! crate sellers, but there was an Increased com*
mission demand and all offerings were taken.
At the close January pork was 12% c higher at
$<J 22%, January lard 5c higher at $5 10 and
January ribs 7%@10c higher at $4 701*4 <2%.

THE LEMON MARKET. Â
NEW YORK. Nov. 22.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The Sicily lemon market has been
unsettled for some . time past as a result of
liberal receipts on a dull market. . From the
beginning of the season to date there have ar
rived in round numbers 177,000, against about
173,000. boxes for the corresponding, period last
year and about 100,000 in the previous year be
tween these dates. Last year and . the year be
fore California was a prominent * factor and
supplied a considerable part of the Western
demand. This season, while offerings have not
been so great from the coast, enlarged ship
ments from Sicily influenced by comparatively
high prices ruling at the beginning of the sea
son seem to have overstocked the markets
East and West. .-â¢,:.â¢â  â¢ .-.â â¢â â¢â â¢ ; â¢
Speaking or the condition of the market a
prominent jobber said to-day that the uncer
tainty as to the future was about done. . - â¢
"The market," he said, "Is gradually assum
ing a normal condition statistically. The
available supplies in sight are slightly less
than the quantity at the dock and en route at
this time last year. -'- â â  -.
"Advices from California," he continued,
j "indicate that - there will be >no heavy ship
i ments from the coast until after January 1,
| while the few .carp now being shipped from
there are mostly green and therefore not avail
able for immediate consumption. The recent
receipts of Sicily lemons . have been of good
quality and have shown a large percentage of
perfectly ripe fruit available for immediate
use." - - â  â¢ " â â  /â¢ â¢ , . â¢ â  . . A â â â â

Hops continue in demand, and arrivals are ;

but there are none coming in. Hides stand |
about the same. Wool shows some change.
Fall descriptions being lower,, A local circu
lar says: "While the volume of business in
the East has been liberal for the past three 1
weeks, it has not reacted upon the West. This j
is chiefly for the reason that the banks of Bos- !
ton of late demonstrated the fact that con- \
slderable wool paper was being carried, anid |
that it should be diminished. This was done
by making large sales of wool at extremely low
prices. Our local market is dull. Occasionally
a^ order comes along on a low basis, but such
orders are so few and so limited as to quan
tity that it oi.lv cuts a sorry figure In reduc
ing the large stock held here."

RULE OVER
THE MINERS
Re-election of the Veteran Chief Heals All
Dissensions and Ends the Seventh
Annual Convention.
For another year Jacob H. Xeff will
direct ilic destinies of the California
Miners' Association. That much and
more has come nut of the seventh annual
ntion. Yesterday, the eecond day
and last of this year's session, meant
more to Mr. Nefl than did all the honors
that were heaped upon him in the recent
election that raised him to one of the
highest political offices in the gift of the
â¢ of the State.
Nearly the whole day was given over
to his eulogy, and the -50 delegates who
hau gathered to the convention voiced the
love and esteem in which they hold their
veteran chief and contributed to his elec
tion.
The coming election of Mr. Neff was
heralded in the morning by Secretary
Julian Sonntag, who, against W. C. Rals
ton, had been making a hard fight for the
presidency.
Shortly after roll call Mr. Sonntag quiet
ed the bustle and confusion among the
delegates, and turning to Mr. .N'eff, said:
"Mr. Neff, If your honored self will
again accept the presidency of this asso
ciation 1 shall deem it my privilege and
pleasure to withdraw from the campaign.
No personal ambition of mine shall in
trude to mitigate the success that has
crowned this association' under your guid
ance and 1 shall give you my undivided
support."
. A roar of applause rewarded Mr. Sonn
tag for his voluntary effacement.and from
right and left the delegates came to take
him by the hand and commend him for a
manly action.
Others followed Mr. Sonntag, and In the
afternoon Governor Budd opened proceed
ings.
â¢Mr. Neff," said the Governor, "four
years ago officiated at my birth into pub
lic life. He was a private citizen then,
but in a few weeks the same 'Jake' Nell
Is going to play pall bearer at my political
funeral. I am . going to make my talk to
you a prophecy, and the burden of it is
that Mr. Neff will hold a longer term as
Lieutenant Governor of the State of Cali
fornia than any officer that was ever in
ducted into office. How much I have
thought of Uncle "Jake" Nefl is a matter of
record, and how much of this association
my official actions on mining matters have
proved, and before I cease to be an offi
cial I want to make a suggestion: That
Is, that at the next Legislature you have
the 5*50,000 that the State has given you
for debris dams put aside in a special fund
bo that it shall be out of reach of legisla
tion. â¢;-..-.-. -â 
"I regret that my successor, Henry T.
Gage, one of the best men and most able
lawyers in the State, cannot be with you,
but I know that he is in heart and spirit."
. Major McLaughlin followed the Gover
nor to the stage to read a telegram of re
gret from Governor Gage, in which the
new executive .gave renewed assurances of
his friendship to mining interests.
Ex-Congressman Caminetti presented
the report of the Debris Commission, and
Congressman Julius Kahn was called to
the platform for a short pledge of his
vbice and vote for all measures that may
conduce to the enhancement of mines and
mining.
; President Neff then announced the spe
cial order for the afternoonâ election
of officers for the ensuing year, and
turned over the gavel, temporarily, to
Colonel George M. Stone.
The clang of Colonel Stone's introduc
tory rap had scarce eased sounding when
Judge Niles Searls of Nevada rose, turn
ed ,io his fellows, and said: â  .
â  F>flow i S at;-.Â« â¢: , the"M!TTers' Convention:
TTe Tiave been for years felicitating ourselves'
upon the harmony which has prevailed among
us. (Applause Universal harmony, I thfnk
1 may sa >\ has prevailed now for- seven years.
When we mixed it was feared that the
Intense antagonism between the farmers and
the miners would be Intensified by our action,
tut the wisdom exhibited by our several con
ventions, anJ by the officers whom we had
the E'icr! fortune to -select, was -such that those
animosities were swept away, and to-day the
era of good feeling "between miners and agri
culturists lias arrived.
Now we are largely indebted for this result
to the equitable conduct of the gentleman
whom we faava had to preside over us. (Ap
plause.) His love of justice, his uniform ur
l>anity to all With â wham he came in contact
have been such, that the whole people, irre
spective of their vocations, have come to re-
Bpect and admire him. Well, it is sometimes
Bald when you get the right man in the right
place- you- had better keep him there. (.Ap
plause.)
My object here to-day, and my sole object.
Is. to keep him there. (Applause.)
My action la not put in motion by reason of
aiiy objection I have personally to any other
gentleman who may .have been or who may
now be a candidate for the position of presi
dent of this association. I know two of them
Who have been mentioned, and I have an un
limited 'admiration for them, and were I going
to lick, out two courteous gentlemanly young
men from this audience I think Ralston and
Sonntag would be among the first I should se
lect. But unfortunately their friends have
been- more zealous, , perhaps, than they have,
and I think I foresee that if we shall elect
any one except our present president for the
next year we will involve ourselves in peril,
and Injure. If not the success,' at least the
present financial status of the institution.
I know, Mr. Neff. that you do not desire to
serve any longer as president of the associa
tion. 1 know that you have labored long and
faithfully for us. I know you have said it was
stated to you last year if you would only serve
us 'Just this one more year we would excuse
you. Now let me say if such a thing as that
was said (and like enough it was). It was by
a .Democrat, and I heard a stalwart Republican
say not six weeks ago that a Democrat wouia
lie on credit when he could get cash for tell
ing the truth.
Again, Mr. you said to us the other day in
your address, which seemed like a farewell ad
dress, that you had served us for seven years.
Well. It !s not the first time that. men have
served seven years and been disappointed.
Again, it has been said that your position a?
lieutenant Governor and as president of the
Senate may In some way which has never been
defined Interfere with your duties as the presi
dent of this association. I cannot for the life
POSTUM CEREAL.

have quit the use of coffee and taken to
Postum Cereal Food Coffee.
You may be sure thai I have aban-
doned the use of common jjoffee alto-
gether.
A number of my friends in Ohio.
Michigan and here in Canada have
been greatly benefited by discarding
coffee and ~ usin? J'ostum. I have
known cases where people. disliked the
taste of Postum, but upon inquiry I
havf discovered that it is because
they <liv not allow it to boil lone:
enough, and I know that this is always
true in such cases. No one can get a
good cup of Postum without it is prop-
erty made, and that is simple and easy
enough if one will only follow the direc-
tions.
| of me see how any question that affects the
I general public should Interfere In any way in
I your position as Lieutenant Governor. If mat
ters arise for legislation wherein your private
interests are involved and yet you may pre
side over the Senate, why in the name of all
that !s great and good may you not when my
interests are involved and those of all these
gentlemen here preside over our association?
Again, it has been said that your health was
not a-! strong as it lias been heretofore. Now,
sir, that remark is the most tender point to all.
You have not a friend In this broad State who
would undertake to do anything which in his
Judgment would Interfere with your physical
condition or place undue pressure upon your
mental condition. But 1 will tell you what
we will do. We want your influence. We
n^ed it, and we want a man at our head who
in the future as he has in the past will elicit
universal confidence. In the name then of
high heaven I implore you: In the name of this
association" I ask you as an old, true and tried
friend, as a man who has stood by us when we
were in childhood, in our youth, and until we
have reached our early manhood, that you do
not at this critical moment leave us to our own
devices when we are old. And I think you
must realize that you can do much for us.
As to the matter of overtaxing you. let us
select a good stalwart vice president, who will
do the work, who will become an entered ap
prentice and go on and become a journeyman
during this year, that we may make him our
commander for the next. ",' ' ' :
You. sir, have been our Admiral Dewey. Do
you think Dewey would quit and go home even
if his health was not very good in case some
trouble wculd arise down in Manila? I rather
think not. I think he would stick It out and
fight it out and continue to abide in the hearts
of the 1 American people, as you have done, and
I trust whatever your action may be, as you
will ever Co.
While the applause that followed Judge
Searls' remarks was quieting. Judge F.
Adams of El Dorado took a position near
the platform and in a ringing speech' sec
onded Mr. Neff's nomination. He was
followed by Tirey L. Ford and Judge
Bush of Shasta, and when the vote was
put every man in the house rose to his
feet with a shout and a cheer for Neff.
Julian Sonntag again won the. cheers of
the convention by rising to place in nomi
nation for the vice presidency William U.
Ralston, his erstwhile opponent, and Mr.
Ralston was seated by acclamation.
Tirey L. Ford nominated Samuel J.
Hendy, incumbent, for treasurer, and
Mr. Hendy was elected with no more dif
ficulty than the others. â¢
The only fight was on the secretaryship.
R. H. Turner of Nevada City was placed

Invitations to attend were read from thÂ«

Won cleverly. Second and thin! driving.
ttlo Chlco had bf-st luck and liked the going. Stamina don't seem to be of much ac-
count. Gilt Edge is a big lumbering fellow that requires hard riding. He was out of
his class. Ocorona is on the improve.

THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1898.
MORELLITO IN
FRONT OF TWO
STURDY MILERS
Mistral II and Ostler
Joe His Game.
i
FOUR FAVORITES FINISH FIRST
RIO CHICO TOO FAST FOR SAM
McKEEVER.
Marplot Won Again â Mainstay-
Picked Up a Purse â Lodestar
Beaten in a Hard Drive by
Judge Stouffer.
Seldom has a better equine bout been
witnessedâ that Is from a spectacular
standpointâ than the mile special furnish
ed at Ingleside yesterday. There were but
three starters â imp. Mistral, Ostler Joe,
each with 112 pounds up, and the three
year-old Morellito, shouldering 106. The
latter won, chiefly through the superb
saddle work of "Skeets" Martin. The bet
ting favored Ostler Joe, the black horse
at one time being an even money choice
In the ring. Mistral was an extensively
backed second choice, with any amount
of 3 to 1 obtainable about Mat Storn'3
colt.
Caldwell let the trio away to an even
break, and, locking horns on the back
stretch, they raced almost head and head
to the bend for home. Piggott, on Mis
tral, here carried the others wide, Thorpe
being compelled to take the black horse
back and come down on the inside. It
cost him the race. In a furious drive
Morellito beat Mistral a head, with the
Montana Hindoo a neck further away.
"Skeets" earned a round of well deserv
ed applause from the "bleachers" and
stand.
The track was slushy, but the crowd
invariably managed to pick the right one,
to the intense disgust of the ring. Sam
McKeever and Ostler Joe were the only
beaten favorites.
Garnet Ferguson's Montana purchase,
Sam McKeever, was installed favorite for
the five and a half furlong sprint for two
year-olds, and though putting in a strong
bid was led over the line by Rio Chico,
with Beauchamp in the saddle. The win
ner was well backed at odds of 4 to 1.
Marplot seems to experience no difficul
ty now in running up to form. The big
bay colt went to the post a 7 to 5 choice
for the seven furlong run next decided,
and catching Imperious in the run to the
wire beat the Schrieber entry with appa
rent ease. In a long, hard drive Ever
son with Inverary II snatched show
honors from Daisy F by a head.
The original seven furlong nurse event
was declared off and a six furlong run
substituted. Mainstay was an overwhelm
ing public choice, and won as he pleased
from Zorazzo, an outsider with quite a
following.
The four and a half furlong spin pro
vided for maiden two-year-olds fell an
easy victim to Jerry Hunt, the entry of
Barney Schreiber. Backed from 7 to 5 to
even money. Jerry showed the way from
the start, winning with little in reserve
from Felieite, a 25 to 1 shot. Silver BeA-UX,
owing to his rider's stupidity, was vlr
tuallv left at the post.
Judge Stouffer. the favorite, and J>o<le
star, carrying the select money, engaged
in a duel in the last event, at seven fur
longs. The Judge struck the stretch in
front, and, stalling off Thorpe's chal
lenge with Lodestar, Martin got. the first
choice over the line a neck in the lead.
Track itfotes,
The Antrim Stock Farm yearlings will be
sold at Occidental Horse Exchange to-night.
Hill I-angford. formerly sheet writer for
George Rose, dropped in from Chicago yester-
day.
'Kid" Weller, the plunjrer, will not get out
this way until well into December.
Ed Purser, after a fairly successful season
East, is here again. He was busily engaged
yesterday studying up the "dope."
Pete Rlley. the well-known penciler, and a
fresh arrival from the Eastern country, strung
quite a bunch of coin on the chances of Mistral
II In the mile special.
Charley and Tom Quinn are expected within
a few days. Charley should infuse some life
Into the game, as he lays it down in good
sized chunks.
"Moose" Taylor states that Harry Landeman
will be out here shortly to book.

The Story Was Too Straight.
United States Attorney Foote made a
novel exception yesterday in the United
States District Court in the case of Hui
Gnow Doy. a Chinese immigrant, wno
claimed to be a Native Son. The testi
mony given by the "professional uncle"
dovetailed exactly with the statement
made by the young "American" on board
the steamer, and left Commissioner Hea
cock no other course except to recommend
his release by the court. When the report
was presented to Judge de Haven. Mr.
Foote excepted to the recommendation.
He argued that the remarkable unanimity
of the statements made by the witnesses
was the most suspicious fact about the
case. The stories dovetailed too niceiy
to "be true. There was no doubt that the
applicant was a Chinaman. He could not
speak a word of English, and it should be
the rule in such cases that wherever there
was a doubt the ooubt should be applied
In favor of the Government.

KEEP THE WELL, WELL.
â¢* I suspect that I may attribute my recent headaches to
doing so much night-work of late," said a lady who earns her
own living. " I had an order to address a large number of en-
velopes and as I was paid by the thousand and others wanted
the work, too, I sat up pretty late and perhaps worked in a room
not so well ventilated as it might be. As a consequence I have
more than once had a headache the next day. I have found,
however, that if I swallow a Ripans Tabule just as soon as I
have a premonition of the trouble, it staves it off and I escape
ijcot free. That is why I say that Ripans Tabules are a medicine
for well people, for I am certainly a healthy woman, but I use the
Tabules now and then and would not like to be without them.**

SHARKEY GETS
THE DECISION
Continued from Set md Page.
t. en long enough to know the rules and
his man had to suffer. While I know
of no precedent for declaring all bets
ciV it waa compulsory on my part, as it
looked preconcerted and my decision
rning bets went as it did because
1 could see no reason why many should
suffer for the offense of one of the
seconds."
Following are some of the opinions
regarding Kelly's decision:
Inspector McLaughlin â I think the
referee's action fair and equitable to
all concerned, winners and losers alike.
There was no other course left open to !
him than to decide the fight and bets
as he did.
Joe UHman, bookmakerâ The decision
regarding bets wus the worst I have
seen. The referee certainly had
no precedent and I am at a loss to j
know where he got his ideas frum. It
was outrageous and I don't think
everything in connection with the af
fair was open a' 7 above board.
Ahe Levy bookmaker â I never saw
anything like it in my life. When did
that refere come in to declare all b.-ts
off. I'd like to know. In all probability j
"â¢J.ere was something doing which was j
*ot in every way open to inspection.
Dan Stuart, promoter of the Carbon
City fight â The referee's decision was |
Just, and showed conclusively the m-.?tal
of which T :eily warf made to render ;
such a verdict in the face of certain
disapproval by the host which had
S on Sharkey.
A. B. Erlanger. theatrical managerâ
I agrev with the referee in regard to
his 'edsion. and his action simply |
made his sobriquet all the stronger.
"Jimmy" Wakeleeâ l think the ref- I
eree's action as to declaring off bets j
the only thing he could have done un- !
der th>* circumstances. Of course, he j
was in a peculiar position, but at that
I -ht. an<l I was with those who
applau ! 1 hin
"Jim" Kennedyâ lt's pretty hard to [
say what you would do until placed in ;
such a position, but as John's action I
seemed to mcc' with almost universal
appi .1 I guess his point was pretty j
* ;ken.
Con McVey said: "I jumped into the ;
ring because I saw Sharkey hitting in
almost every clinch, and sometimes so j
low that anybody ought to have been ;
able to see it. I called out to the referee '
time after time in the last round, and
then I could stand it no longer and ;
stuck my head through the ropes, but j
Kelly did not see me. Then I saw
Sharkey hit Jim in another clinch. I
guess I lost my head and put my foot
over the rope, when they gave the fight
to Sharkey.
"I nm sorry that T am the cause of ;
the decision being given against Cor- >
bett. He would have won to a cer
talnty. He had Sharkey whipped, but :
I could not stand seeing him get fouled |
without making a protest."
SHARKEY WOULD HAVE
WON THE CONTEST
Corbett Slowly but Surely Fading
Before the Onslaughts of
Jxe bailor.
NEW YORK. Nov. 22.â McVey's Inter
ference In the Corbett -Sharkey fight to
night was absolutely inexcusable and
the referee, believing that there was a
"job" in McVey's action, took it upon
himself to declare all bets off. Before
Kelly did so, however, many of those
who had bet on Corbettâ and they were
legion â annealed to the referee to take
such action, while Sharkeyltes shouted
against su' v interference on Kelly's
part and protested that he had no au
thority to declare the bets off. How
ever, the referee's word went with the
majority of the spectators and conse
quently all money paid on wagers will
be refunded.
It was an unfortunate and abrupt
ending to what promised to be a most
interesting fight. For weeks both Cor
bett and Sharkey had trained faithfully
and carefully for the contest, and whei
they stripped they both showed to be
in good condition. Sharkey was very
confident of success, and the manner in
whi^h he acquitted himself in the ring
while the fight lasted showed plainly
that his confidence was founded on
good grounds. Those who believed that
Sharkey could not fight fairly changed
their opinion after the bout had gone
one round.
On the other hand, Corbett hit the
sailor in the body rather low and Shar
key protested. Sharkey's quickness and
aggressiveness were astonishing from
the very beginning, and from the first
It was evident that he had Corbett safe.
In the second round there were wild
yells from the admirers of the Irishman
when he floored Corbett with a right
swing on the head, preceded by a pow
erful blow on the body.
Sharkey's rushes were successful In
variably and Jim's leg work was tested
to its utmost in trying to evade the ag
gressive sailor pugilist. That Sharkey
has improve 1 wonderfully goes without
saying, and on the other hand that
Corbett is not the Corbett of New Or
leans is beyond question. At no time
had the Californian the upper hand of
his younger and more sturdy rival.
Sharkey is a fighter and a clever one
at that, and his work to*night stamps
him beyond all doubt as being second
only to Fitzsimmons.
From the second to the eiehth round
Sharkey held a decided advantage. In
the ninth round, which was so produc
tive of disappointment and unlooked
for Incidents, Corbett seemed to be
stronger than at any time during the
fight, but it was apparent that he was
slowly but surely fading under Shar
key's onslaughts. It was two to one
on Sharkey after the second round, and
had not McVey acted as he did there
Is very little doubt that Sharkey would
have won handily.
Some of the most prominent bankers,
brokers, lawyers, doctors and business
men In this and other cities were pres
ent during the mill, and not one of
them could see any reason for inter
ference by McVey. The general belief
is that McVey acted from some unex
plained motive, and some persons said
that he .lumped into the ring to pre
vent Corbett going under. When Mc-
Vey first put his leg through the. ropes
the referee evidently did not or would
not look in that direction, but contin
ued to pay close attention to the fight
ers, who were mixing it up in the cen
ter of the ring. Inspector McLaughlln
caught hold of McVey to pull him out
again, but the latter was evidently
more than anxious that Kelly should
see him. j Tn this he was successful, but
not until half the people in the house
had y< ': .Â«d repeatedly to Kelly to dis
qualify Corbptt.
When the big Californian realized
v.-hat had occurred he was. furious with
passion and rushed nt McVey. Had he
f'mirht the latter there is no telling
"hat Corbett would have done in his
frenzy, but the police were on hand
nnd rushed between the men. thus
avoiding a scene which would have
added to the discrneeful exhibition.
Just what effect the untimely incident
will have on boxing: in this vicinity in
he future cannot well be paused, but
that It will Injure puerilism in this city
is beyond question.
A olopp Â»9timate niaced the nttend
&n.ee to-night at 9000, and It is now
learned that the receipts exceeded
$45,000.
RINGSIDE SCENES
BEFORE THE FIGHT
Every City in the Country Repre
sented in the Gathering of
Sports.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â The twenty
round glove fight between James J.
Cort tt of California, the ex-champion
heavyweight boxer of the world, and
Tom Sharkey of Dundalk, Ireland, who j
first showed his prowess as a fighter j
we - c : ving the United States as si !
bluejacket in the navy, dn an enor
m u v. J. of sporting men to the I
Lenox Athletic Club house to-night. In j
fact such a representative gathering
of the sporting element from all over,
the country was never in the city limits
at one time before. The ract that the j
contest would certaimy take place
without any legal interference induced
many hundreds of followers and ad
mirers of the art of self-defense to
make long journeys in order to be at
the rinrside when the tight took place. ,
Nearly every city of any prominence in |
the United States was represented by \
parties of at least a dozen, and in many
instances dele- tions numbering over a
hundred each in charge ot well-known
men in different sporting ce.ters.
Weeks ago. when the seats were first
put on sale, the shrewd people who
lived quite a lone: distance from this ;
city either wrote or wired for seats to \
be reserved and by doing so saved j
themselves a lot of trouble on their ar- ,
rival here. Those who saw far enough I
ahead to do this were only a compara- ,
tlve few however, and the past few !
days there was a lively scramble to se
cure good seats. To-day not a seat was i
to be had at the club after 1 o'clock i
and those who had not made early pro
vision had to pay exorbitant prices to
the wide awake speculators. Tickets
for seats in the immediate vicinity of
the ring brought fabulous prices to- |
night. The original cost of these paste- I
boards was $20 each, but to-night twice j
that sum could not purchase one of
them and in two instances they brought
$100 apiece. The other tickets, costing
from $5 to 515. brought prices two and j
threefold and the club management did i
not put any of the $3 admission tickets
on sale.
The gambling instinct, which is a
necessary adjunct to all manner of
fistic contests, was in evidence as soon
as the sports began to gather in the
boxes.
Corbett's stock was always in pref
erence and the odds on the San Fran
ciscan opened at 100 to SC. The betting j
did not take on as lively a turn as on I
former occasions when fighters of less ,
note have met in this arena. So much |
betting had been done during the last
forty-eight hours, however, in the
sporting resorts throughout the city
that the slackness of the wagering on
the spot did not indicate any loss of
interest in the heavy-weight bout.
By half past 8 o'clock nearly every
seat in the house w.as occupied. Bank
ers and brokers of prominence, lawyers
of note and business men representing
nearly every phase of trade, mingled j
with "well known politicians and held
animated conversations in close prox- j
imity to the ringside. One well known
member of the Produce Exchange took
the Sharkey end of one of the largest
â wagers of the night, which was JISOO |
to $1300 on Corbett. Joe Vendig laid j
the odds on the Californlan.
Corbett's backers forced the price of
the Callfornian to $100 to $70 just as it
was learned that the ex-champion had j
reached the club house and was in his j
dressing room.
At 10:23 a buzz of excitement ran
through the buildinrr and Tom Sharkey
pushed his way through the butting
"CYRANO" DONE TO A FINISH IN FIVE ROUNDS.
THE first fall to be taken out of
"Cyrano de Bergerac" in San Fran
cisco -was accomplished at the Com
edy Theater last night by our old spec
tacular friend Dave Henderson. Accord
ing to the bills there were eighty persons
on the stage, and according to the rows
of vacant plush there were as many more
in the audience. Mr. Henderson was mas
ter of the situation, and the overnosed
hero of Rostand s romantic comedy was
done to a finish. The thousands of pa
trons of art who preferred to stand in
front of the newspaper offices and take
stereopticon views of the Corbett-
Sharkey battle got but little satisfaction
for their pains. The few who went to txie
Comedy Theater saw a contest that was
full of steam and danger and received a
decision that was just and final. Rostand
and his boasted masterpiece went under
in five fierce rounds, and David Hender
son and his dauntless play actors are the
heroes of this morning's papers.
After last night's work I would l/ack

crowd. He vrâ ~+tired in a light blue
dressing gown, under which he had an
American flag wound around his waist
for a belt. He was accompanied by his
manager, Tom O'Rourke, John T.
Dougherty, George Dixon, Bob Arm
strong and Jack Reid, who acted as his
seconds. Professor "Jimmy" de Forest
held the watch for the Irishman.
Sharkey never looked better in his
life, and said he weighed 178 pounds.
He was very confident and showed no
signs of nervousness. Announcer
Charley Harvey called the attention of
the onlookers to the fact that the prin
cipals wished them to refrain from
smoking, and immediately all the
cigars which were being industriously
puffed were trodden underfoot most
willingly. The crowd was beginning to
be uneasy at Corbett's delay in making
his appearance, when some one in the
gallery shouted:
"Three cheers for Sharkey."
This was given with a will and re
peated.
Corbett did not reach the ringside un
til 10:38 o'clock, just fifteen minutes
later than Sharkey. There was a wild
cheer as hÂ«- was seeking his way to
the ringside. When he reached the
steps leading up to the ring Corbett
stopped for a moment to shake hands
with some friends. Then he jumped
through the ropes and rested his arms
on them for a few minutes, during
which time he smiled across the ring
to O'Rourke, who stood in front of
Sharkey.
Corbett was enveloped in a dark olive
green dressing gown. His hair was
parted in the middle and carefully
combed and brushed. His seconds were
Charley White. George Considine, Jack
McVey and John Considine.
John Considine of Detroit acted as
his time-keeper. Both men had their
choice of the sets of gloves. Corbett
selected his pair, which were n.ade for
him in California. They were a pair
of typical fighting gloves, being just
shaped to the clinched fist, whereas
Sharkey's were the long, tapering
gloves usually donned by boxers. They
were nearly an inch and a half longer
than his opponent's, which would give
him an opportunity of forcing the hair
in the gloves away from the knuckles.
The gloves were of the regulation
weight of five ounces as pi ided by
the Horton law.
Corbett wore white trunks and a red,
white and green sash, which his
seconds took off as soon as he stood
erect. Sharkey wore green splits, held
by a belted American flag.
There was n long confab between thÂ°
principals, the seconds and the referf-o,
after which the men retired to their
corners. After having agreed not to hit
in clinches or in the breakaways and
that they would step back when or
dered to break, everything was in order
for the bout to begin.

FITZSIMMONS SAYS
IT WAS A "FAKE"
CHICAGO. Nov. 22.â Robert Fitzsim
mons, the champion pugilist, is now in
this city. He r-as all along declared
that the fight between Corbett and
Sharkey â v uld be a "fake," and when
seen to-ni ' after the result was made
known, he exclah.ied:
"What did I tell you? I said it was
going to be a fake, and it was nothing
but fake. McVey jumped into the ring
on purpose to stop the fight, and it was
all fixed for him to do it. You can bet.
too, that there were men right at the
ringside to hold him. The whole thine:
was a put up job .and I tell you it
Â»er was on the square."
fVhat will you do in regard to any
challenge that Sharkey or Corbett may
send in your direction?"
"Do?" said Fitz, with great scorn,
"I'll do nothing. I'll pay no attention
to either one of them. They have put
themselves further away from any at
when they set out to do a boasting author
they do him. . â¢
And still, no i^atter how well earned
the victory is, one can't help but feel
some sympathy for the vanquished.
Until last night my acquaintance with
"Cyrano" had been confined to the print
ed book, from which I had learned to
love him well. His dash, his valor, his
wit, his strength, passion, poetry, even
his monumental nose, filled me with ad
miration anfl amaze. He was the old
spirit of romance, swashbucklery and
literate elegance, sublimatedâ crystallized
into a classic. He was going to bring
about a renascent boom for poetic drama
and duplicate the wit and ardor of
"Romeo and Juliet." If T had any taste
for Ibsen. Sudermann. Shaw and other
rank realists. Cyrano would cure me. He
would alter the entire dramatic policy of
The Call. That's what I thought might
happen. T
But how different the sensations when
I saw him bathed in public calcium and
exposed on an open stage to the fury of
the Hendersons. The noble Cyrano of
books and dreams se<'n behind th nose
tention from me than ever. Let them
go and get a reputat ;<--.. There's Peter
Maher, why don't they take him on a
little? I won't pay any attention to
them. Let them go lirk somebody and
get a reputation.
"This kind of fighting makes me
tired, anyhow," went on the champion,
warming to his subject. "It ain't on
the square. There is only one honest
fighter In the world, anyhowâ and his
name is Robert Fitzsimmons."
Fitz was full of disgust over the end
ing of the fight and dccl red over and
over that it was a job and "not on the
level."
Jimmy Barry, the 105-pound cham
pion of the vorld, merely remarked:
"It's too bad. The big fellows are kill
ing the game."
THRONGS VIEW THE
BATTLE FROM AFAR
The crowd which watched the pro
gress of the fight as it was depicted on
the bulletin board of The Call was one
of tne largest ever gathered in this
city. It even outnumbered the multi
tude which awaited with eager interest
the outcome of the recent election.
Both men are claimed as San Fran
ciscans and the outcome of the battle,
which was practically for the heavy
weight championship of the world,
aroused the sporting instincts of the
local people. The crowd commenced
to gather early and soon grew so dense
as to preclude the possibility of locomo
tion. Away up the street men with
keen foresight had provided themselves
with glasses and from the outskirts of
the crowl read the bulletins aloud to lit
tle knots of people who had gathered
around them. The Call bulletins
throughout the bout were always from
one to two rounds ahead of those dis
played by the other papers. This was
soon recognized by the crowd, which
cheered lustily for their favorite boxer
as he scored on his opponent.
Sharkey had a large following, which
gave vent to its feelings at every op
portunity. As the tidings "Sharkey
Wins" were flashed on the canvas the
crowd cheered the victor and then dis
persed rapidly.
Of the fight and its results sporting
men expressed different opinions. The
consensus of opinion, however, was
that th referee should not have de
clared all bets off because of the fact
that McVey, io was Corbetfs second,
jumped into the ring, evidently for the
purpose of saving his man Jim from a
knock-out blow.
In speaking of the contest, a promi
nent bookmaker said he could not un
derstand why Referee' Kelly declared
Sharkey the winner and then all bets
off, as long as there was not any police
interference.
The local betting was very heavy. !
Harry Corbett, the poolseller, took in !
over $50,000, and In the mutuals he sold
5870 tickets. Those who purchased
tickets in the auction pools will have
their money returned less 2% per cent.
Those who played the mutuals at Cor
bet's and Crowley's rooms on the win
ning round will fare well.
Crowley will pay 510 75 to those who
hold tickets from six to ten rounds. '
and Corhettâ if he cashes at allâ will
pay $7 30 to those who are In possession
of cards calling for coin on rounds that
run from seven to twelve.
Corl-ett was undecided last night
whether it would be right on his part
âthat is according to ruleâ to cash
mutual tickets on the decision as ren
dered by "Honest" John Kelly.
Prominent sporting men who were
questioned on the matter did not hesi
tate to say that the pool sellers should
most assuredly pay off winning mutual
tickets as those who had purchased
them did so with the intention of win
ning if the fight came to an end be
tween certain figures which denote
rounds.

cene hero of a comic opera. The lovely
poetry was garbled and cut and man
gled and soiled; the wild heroism was
tame farce-comedy; the brilliant comedy
was brutal burlesque, and the lofty sen
timent was inarticulate drivel. The very
name Cyrano was a josh, for his pals and
enemies called him everything from "Seer
aino" to "Seerino." The balcony scene,
that was to out-Shakespeare William, was
like a funeral march In rag time; and the
brave Gascon cadet? were half of them
melancholy young women who looked as
though they might have been on ice ever
since the old days of Henderson's "Sin
bad."
The fragrant Roxane turned out to be
a deliberate old party with a designing
voice and the handsome Christian a large
young gentleman whose only anxieties
were nls costume and his feet. The stage.
a tiny one at best, was crowded and
congested with unmartialed supers and
Cyrano's nose. This nose was as big as a
foot and twice as homely. The orchestra
dodged whenever Mr. liell poked it over
the footlights.
I have suffered disillusion before, but
never as 1 have at the hands of Mr. Hen

a few weeks ago he was thumping the
pride out of Sardou and Dumas, and last
night at the same Bush-street arena he
smashed the nasal masterpiece of modern
French poetry. I'll wager that In a week
Mr. Henderson could make William
Shakespeare a name of reproach.

REINSURANCE
AND THE BANK
LINE OF SHIPS
Rate on Laurelbank
Cut 20 Per Cent.
OPINION ABOUT HER DIVIDED
ARRIVAL OF THE OVERDUE
SAMOENA AT ASTORIA.
Terrible Experience of Captain James
Boyd of the Thornliebank and
Springbank in Aus
tralia.
The arrival of the schooner Prosper at
Port Townsend with news of the sup
posed speaking of the overdue ship
Laurelbank caused quite a flutter in re
insurance* circles yesterday. On Monday
it was conceded on all sides that the
stout vesel had gone down in the ty
phoon that so nearly wrecked the steamer
Zealandia and the British ship Heath
field, and 90 per cent to reinsure was free
ly offered with no takers. Yesterday the
rate dropped to 70 per cent, and one gam
bler, who stood to win $3500 on a WOO in
vestment, refused $2500 for his risk.
The facts of the case are about as fol
lows: On August 31 the British ships
Heathfield left Shanghai for Tacoma and
the Laurelbank for Astoria. On Septem
ber 23 the British ship Glendoon left Yo
kohama for Astoria, arriving at her des
tination on October 23. In his report Cap
tain Morrison said that the Laurelbank
and the Heathfield had been caught in a
terrible typhoon. The Heathfield put into
Yokohama dismasted, her bulwarks and
stanchions gone and her ballast shifted.
From that day until the Prospers cap
tain "thought" he saw her nothing has
been heard of the Laurelbank.
In the meantime the Heathfield's dam
ages were repaired at Yokohama and she
reached Tacoma on the 11th inst. The
Hawthornbank, a sister ship to the Lau
relbank, left Hongkong on the 22d of.
August, nine days before the Laurelbank
sailed from Shanghai, and reached San
Francisco on October 7. Since then she
has discharged and loaded, and is now
almost ready for sea again. From this it
would appear as though the chances were
all against the Laurelbank ever being
heard from again, and that the rate of 90
per cent was fully warranted.
The chances are that the captain of the
Prosper was mistaken in the vessel. He
Is not sure whether she had painted
ports or was lead colored. The Laurel
bank never was a painted port ship, as
just about the time she and the Spring
bank (now In port) were launched the
owners of the "Bank" line abolished the
painted pftrt and adopted the lead color
style. The chances are that the vessel
seen was the Samoena, which arrived at
Astoria yesterday from Nagasaki. She
was sixty-two days out, anu 50 per cent
reinsurance was paid on her. The takers
of reinsurance, however, look upon this
aa a good sign. They won largely on the
Samoena, and contend that if she took
sixty-two days to reach Astoria from Na
fasaki the other vessel Is not overdue
rom Shanghai. Never before has the
fate of a vessel caused so much discus
sion in shipping circles, and there are just
as many old salts to uphold one conten
tion as the other. Those who remember
the Heathfield's experience put the Lau
relbank down as "lost." Those who know
the strength and equipment of the Bank
line of clippers contend that the vessel ia
dismasted and is coming along under
a jury rig. In support of their side they
point to the Wlllscott, that came In here
under a jury rig, and to the arrival of the
Samoena at Astoria after 50 per cent re
insurance had be<=n paid on her.
Andrew Weir & Co. (the Bank line)
own forty vessels, seven of which are
steamers. Many of these they purchased
from other firms, but the "Banks" were
all built to their order. They are the
Beechbank, Cedarbank (on her way here
from England) , Clydebank. Comllebank
(on her way from here to England), Falk
landbank, Fernbank, Forthbank, Haw
thornbank (now in port), Heathbank
Glenbank (arrived at Queenstown from
Oregon yesterday after jettisoning part
of her cargo In a storm). Levernbank
Oakbank, Olivebank (on ber way here
from Australia). Springbank now in
port), Thlstlebank. Thornliebank (now at
Tacoma) and Laurelbank.
The Elmbank will be long remembered
in San Francico. She came here from
Japan with a cargo of sulphur and while
she was lying at Green-street wharf it
caught fire. It was finally smothered out
and the vesse, savedl but on her next
voyage she became a total wreck on the
Irish coast. The Comliebank and Spring
bank did not make unusually long: pas
sages here, but yet 8 and 10 per cent re
insurance was paid on them.
Captain J. Boyd of the Springbank has
had one hard experience in the "Bank"
line. A year ago he was master of the
Thorn.liebank and took that veisel to
Melbourne. Australia. After dischaig
ing his vessel was towed to sea on her
way to Newcastle, Australia, to load coal
for San Francisco. While setting the
topsails a rope broke and a block came
swinging along and struck the captain on
the right jaw, breaking the lawbone into
splinters. The tug was gone and dark
ness had set in, so the mate had to do the
best he could and run for Newcastle, ror
six days Captain Boyd suffered terrible
agony and then reached the hospital in
Newcastle. He had to undergo two
operations and his jaw had to be broken
and reset twice. In the mean t.me the
Thornliebank had sailed for England and
the Sprln^rbank had arrived in port. The
day Captain Boyd was able to leave the
was brought in suffering from heart fail
ure. In consequence Captain Boyd took
hospital Captain Dobie or the Springbank
charge of the vessel and brought ncr here
while Captain Doble remained at New
castle. On the voyage two pieces of the
broken Jawbone worked out of Captain
Boyd's face and it is only a week or bo
ago that the wound healed up.
The torpedo boat destroyer Farragut is
to have another trial. The Government
has granted the request of the Union Iron
Works and the boat will have another run
against time this day week.
The cruiser Philadelphia sailed for
Acapulco yesterday. She will coal there
and proceed to San Salvador to protect
American interests during the fighting in
that country If there is any.
The Harbor Commissioners and the
Postoffice authorities are at outs over the

It has not been run properly and yester

Chief Steward James Glidden of the
Coptic is one of the most popular em
ployes of the O. and O. Steamship
Company. Just prior to the ar
rival of the vessel in port last Monday
the passengers got together and presented
him with a purse and a testimonial wish-
Ing him a merry Christmas and a happy

May Forfeit Their Franchise.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 22.â The Realty Syndi
cate Company, which operates the Ala
meda electric line, will lose Its San Jose
avenue franchise unless it greatly im
proves its service. The city authorities
nave notified the superintendent, Ira
Bishop, that the provisions of the fran
chise must be obeyed or the tracks, poles
and wires will have to be removed. The
trouble arises from the fact that the com
pany's agreement with the city is to make
fifteen minute trips over the San Jose
avenue line, whereas the cars have been
run at irregular intervals, never more fre
quently than half hourly. The superin
tendent claims that the patronage of i.ie
branch line does not pay for the oil used
in the cars. The franchise was granted
about four years ago against the almost
unanimous protest of nearly every prop
erty-owner along the line.

IDENTITY OF
THE MOTHER
STILL A SECRET
The Garbage " Mys
tery" Unsolved,
TWO SCAVENGERS ARRESTED
THEY WERE THE LAST TO
LEAVE THE WORKS.
A Suspicions Case on Franklin Street
Which Is Now BeinÂ£ Inves
tigated by the
Police.
The body of the one-day-old infant,
which was found in a pile of garbage at
the crematory works Monday evening,
etill remains unidentified at the Morgue, j
Unless the unnatural mother voluntarily
makes a confession it Is very unlikely;
that her identity will ever be known.
Yesterday afternoon Detective Dillon I
I'oliceman Bakulich arrested two ,
scavengers who are strongly suspected of j
being Die men who carried the remains
to the crematory. They are J. Rossi of j
12 Lafayette street and Antonio Prignoli j
of 444 Union street. A short time prior to |
the discovery of the dead infant, the two j
men, who are partners in a garbage i
wagon, drove up to the works and dump- ,
ed the' load of refuse which was in their ,
cart. They seemed anxious to get away, j
even refusing to answer the usual ques- j
tions put by one of the employes at the
works. A few minutes after they had!
]eft the body of the dead infant was dls- ,
covered.
After learning of their apparent haste
to leave the works Detective Dillon and
Policeman Baku*uh concluded that they |
knew something about the cruel disposi
tion of the infant and vainly endeavored j
to find out where they lived failing to I
locate them Dillon and his fellow of
ficer, thinking they would return with
another load of garbage, awaited their
C< Snortiy before 4 o'clock the two men ,
apeared and were at once placed under j
arrest To Bakulich, who speak tne
Italian language, the men said they knew
nothing of the attempt to get rid of the j
c* started out' shortly after 6 o'clock |
on Monday morning." he said, "and vis
lted over eighty houses. It was after 4 ;
o'clock wh.-n we finished our work, and,
as usual, drove to the crematory. W e ar
rived there about 5 o'clock, and as we j
tvp-e anxious to return to our homes we i
lost no time in disposing of the garbage]
i collected.
"We then drove away, and did not
know of the finding of the Infant until we
were placed under arrest."
Rossi seemed determined to prevent thfl
officials from getting any information
from his partner. When they started to
question Prignoli he advised him to keep
his mouth closed.
"Don't talk too much, he said in Ital
ian. "These fellows are trying to pump
you."
Officer Bakulich, who was listening to
his remarks, quickly ordered him to "shut
up "
Prignoli. after being warned by his part
ner, positively refused to answer the ques
tions of the officers. They were then
locked up in different cells, so as to pre
vent them from communicating with each
other.

CALIFORNIA AND STANFORD
RESTING FOR THE STRUGGLE
The Cardinal .Has Improved Greatly, Wfeile the Blue and Sold
.Meets With Jleeidents at the Eleventh .Hour, Which
Weaken the Team.
THE work of the football season Is over and the red-shirted sons of Stanford and the blue-and-gold-striped
athletes of California are anxiously awaiting the exciting moment when the signal will be given for the
clash of arms. The last practice was held yesterday on the gridiron at Berkeley and on the field that has
been temporarily laid out at Congress Springs. It was a disastrous practice for the blue-and-gold eleven,
injuring two of their men at the last moment. Whipple, the left half, whose shoulder has been giving him
more or less trouble during the past few weeks, received a bad wrenching that forced him to retire. There is some
doubt about the seriousness of the injury, but it is thought it will not prove of such severity as to keep him out
of the game. "Locomotor" Smith was the second to feel the necessity of retiring. In a scrimmage the flesh between
two of his fingers was torn apart. Throe stitches were necessary to sew up the wound. Smith will undoubtedly play
in the Thanksgiving game, although his catching will have to be done under difficulties.
Practice at both Berkeley and Congress Springs yesterday changed the football situation entirely. The game
of the ame They will shake the dust of Berkeley from their feet early on the day when they are to cross swords with their time-honored adversaries
o gan^j ht e io the rt Nicholas Hotel. The reason of this is to have the team away from the rush and excitement of the howling and ecstatic stu
dents^ iVthe evening the team will go to Odd Fellows' Hall, where a specially arranged show is prepared for the night.
Th betting on the game is slight as yet, owing to the demands of the Stanford supporters for big odds. The California men are asking for even
but there is not much of it In sight. The favored odds are 10 to 8, with California on the long end. There is little Stanford money in town at
"^"ent Things will be different to-night when the advance guard of the cardinal rooters reach this city. To-morrow morning there will be a glut
money, but it is doubtful if the odds will gravitate to even money.
WILL NOT WEAR NECKTIES FOR A YEAR
IF BERKELEY'S COLORS ARE LOWERED
NO football victoryâ no necktie.
This is the somewhat ludicrous
alternative to which almost
every college man at Berkeley
â will pledge himself. It is the
latest development of the great wave
of enthusiasm which surpasses any
thing that the University of California
men have ever known. Everything
about football goes. The sale of em
blems, badges, streamers, flags, rib
bons has been simply enormous. The
anti-necktie club has become a perfect
craze. With a haste that betrays only
too well the unbounded confidence as
to the outcome of the Thanksgiving
day game nearly all the men students
are signing its pledge. In effect it
means simply and plainly that unless
Berkeley wins the game hardly any
Berkeley man will a-ppear upon the
that Rossi knows something about the
taking of the body to the crematory.
"He is a very cunning fellow." remark
' ed Dillon when asked if he had the right
men. "1 am morally certain that he
â  knows from whom the body was received,
I and that he assisted in taking it to the
garbage works. His partner no doubt is
equally guilty, but for lack of evidence we
are unable to positively accuse them."
To-day Dillon and Bakulich will visit
! the houses from which the two men col
i lected the garbage in the hope of finding
a clew which would lead to the identity
i of the unnatural mother who sought to
hide her shame by having her dead child
! cremated as garbage.
Dr. Gallagher yesterday made an au
topsy on the body of the dead infant and
found that the child had been still born.
Its neck was broken, presumably by be
ing tossed in the si-avenger's wagon.
The mystery may have its solution in
a clew which came into the possession of
the police last night. One of the officers
ascertained that a woman living in a
1 boarding house on Franklin street, near
McAllister, a few nights ago gave birth
!to a child, which is said to have been
i spirited away by its father. The child ia
1 reported to have been born dead. Its
' mother is Spanish and has been living
for some time at the boarding house on
Franklin street, with a man who is not
, her husband. The man, it is said, works
in one of the cheap South Side restaur
ants. A few nights ago the woman sent
I for a midwife and doctor. When the child
was born it was dead. The doctor ad
; vised the man, so it is reported, to burn
the child or get rid of it in some way.
Not having much ready money the father
: of the child took the doctor's hint, and
wrapping the dead infant in a pU -c of
cloth, carried it from the house, Saying
he would see that it was buried. When
; inquiry was made at the house late last
1 night only the landlady's husband was In,
TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1898.
which California played on Monday afternoon was meteoric in its brilliancy,
and in comparison with anything that Stanford has done this season was
at least 25 per cent better. All the California supporters were elated over
the prospects of the team. Their enthusiasm received a severe shock yes
terday afternoon, when the blue-and-gold varsity lined up against the sec
ond eleven for the last time. The dash, vim and vigor of the attack of the
preceding day had evanesced and in its place was a listless, half-hearted
offense that brought harsh words to the lips of the coach and exhorta
tions from all the old varsity men on the field. The practice lasted but
fifteen minutes, but it was long enough to lay out two of the men on the
team. Whipple's injury is likely to prove the most serious to the team. He
played left tackle and was developing into a strong and heady player. Op
posite him will be Wilson, the great linesman of Stanford's eleven. The
wrenching that Whipple's shoulder received yesterday may i rove but
slightly injurious to his play, but it is sure to weaken him.
The work of the blue-and-gold team yesterday afternoon was a complete
setback to the coaches on the other side of the bay. It demonstrated one
thing, and that is that the California eleven is not consistent in its per
formances. If they play the fast game they did in practice on Monday
night they ought to defeat the cardinal, but unless they buckle down and
work for every inch another cardinal victory will decorate the trophy cabi
net at Stanford. It is this variable quantity in the California composition
that makes the outcome of the game this year uncertain. |
At Palo Alto, on the other hand, the stock has risen a number of points.
The team did not play hard practice games yesterday, but took things
easy, working at signals, +he execution of new plays and kicking. Since
the church-going at Congress Springs the drooping spirit of the team has
been dispelled and the boys are now happy and even confident of victory.
The condition of the men will be all that can be desired when they line
up on Recreation Park gridiron Thursday afternoon. All the first eleven
men were out, with the exception of Freeman, who is still kept out of the
play on account of his injured shoulder.
There is no doubt in the world that the springs were beneficial to
the cardinal. Their so-called malaria was dissipated as by the touch of a
magic wand. With Freeman in good condition the team will be able to
appear on the field in perfect form. The mountain retreat has done its work
and the Stanford athletes will be right ready for the fray.
Coach Cross spoke encouragingly last night of the condition and marked
improvement of his team. He said: "I feel much better to-day, for I see
that we have a fine fighting chance for victory. The mountain air, the iso
lation and the concentrated work that the team has done in the last few
days has given me great satisfaction. We certainly have improved in in
dividual play, in team work and chiefly in physical condition. I do not
know whether Freeman will play center or not, but I think it is very likely.
The backs win be the quartet that has played together during the last two
weeks Fisher, full; Dole, left half; Clinton, right half, and Murphy, quarter.
They are playing faster and more in unison than they have been of late.
The rest of the time will be devoted to signal practice, and we will have lots
of it."
It is not definitely decided where the Stanford eleven will go after
they leave the springs, which will be some time this afternoon, but it will
be one of three placesâ the Vendome at San Jose, Menlo Park or the uni
versity. They will come to the city on Thursday morning, making the Pleas
anton their headquarters. After the football show the team will be ban
queted and then finish off the day with the "Gay Coney Island" perform
ance at the Columbia.
The California men will not leave their training quarters until the day
campus for the rest of the term with
anything resembling a necktie.
In a short time after the craze had
started some 200 names were on the
list. The number is increasing contin
ually, and before the referee blows
the whistle at 2:30 o'clock Thursday
the men of the student body will be
supporting the idea as a unit. The
prospect of going without a cravat
does not make the rash resolve any the
more unpopular. If Berkeley loses
Berkeley will go in mourning for a
month, and it will show its grief in
the display of some 400 or 500 white
shirt bosoms and bare collar buttons
every day upon the campus. John P.
Irish will be made an honorary mem
ber of the club.
The pledge with its present list of
names is as follows:
We, the undersigned, declare that
and to all questions asked of him he re
plied in a doubtful, hesitating way that
he did not know. He would affirm noth
ing and at the same time would not
make any positive denials. He only an
swered to every single question asked of
him that he did not know.

to the Suey Sing Tong, whose members
believed him to be a Suey Ting. This
murder leaves the score standing at
four to nothing in favor of the Suey
Sings, but from the excited actions of
the Celestials the game seems only fair
ly started.
At 6:15 o'clock last evening Wong Ah
Jung was walking up Clay street, be
tween Spofford alley and Stockton
street. When he reached a point di
rectly in front of 836 Clay street two
shots rang out and Jung fell into the
street, shot in the forehead directly
above the left eye. He died a few mo
ments afterward. Two Chinamen were
seen to run up the steps of the lodging
house and disappear in the darkness of
the hallway. Officers Burke and Tracey
heard the shots and immediately made
a search of the house. In an ash barrel
standing in the hallway they found a
45-caliber Colt's revolver containing two
discharged and four loaded cartridges.
A Chinaman giving the name of Ah
Pon was turned over to the police as
the murderer by Ed McGreeney. a
printer, residing at 1734 Greenwich
street. McGreeney was standing at the
corner of Clay and Stockton streets
when the shooting occurred. He saw
the murdered man fall, and saw the
man who did the shooting. According
to his story there were two Chinamen
standing together when the shots were
flred and these ran into the lodsrinsr
house. Later the Chinaman who Mc-
Greeney thinks fired the shots camej
