MANILA, May 30 (via Hongkong).â
General Aguinaldo has already de
feated the Spaniards in several skir
mishes and one considerable engage
ment. He sent 600 troops across
Bacor Bay last Thursday, They took
a position between Old Cavite and
Bacor, near the powder magazine on
the beach, where the Spaniards had
a strong force of marines and infantry,
which attacked the rebels on Satur=
day morning and was repulsed. The
insurgents captured 224 Spaniards,
and 194 more Sunday night, including
fifteen officers.
The country where these skir
mishes were fought was covered
with thick tropical undergrowth,
with streams and swamps, where
no regular military order could
be maintained.
Before dawn yesterday General
Aguinaldo reinforced his troops
on the mainland with about iooo
men. Crossing the bay at Incan
ces, according to agreement, I
joined the rebel forces, expecting
to witness a charge over the nar
row neck of land connecting Ca
vite Peninsula with the mainland,
where the Spaniards were known
to have the bulk of their troops
and at least one field gun. Gen
eral Aguinaldo told me, however,
that he had changed his plan,
owing to the success of two pre
vious skirmishes, as the Spaniards
still held the peninsula in such
force that an assault would be un
certain in its results. He could
not reinforce his men on the oth
er side of the bay except under
fire of the Spaniards stationed at
the Bacor magazine and at the
harbor. If, therefore, the Span
iards brought heavy reinforce
ments from Manila, his men
would be caught between two
fires, where they might all be cap
tured. Consequently he refused
to give me any assistance to go
to the front, not even to show me
where to land in my own boat on
the other side. I could not induce
him to alter his decision, and,
having drawn the fire of the
Spanish troops at the end of the
peninsula by venturing out from
the cover of the trees, I could see
no hope of further progress in
that direction, except as a target
for several hundred Spanish
rifles, and returned to Cavite.
I. went partly across the bay in
my own boat again. Zip! Mauser
bullets gave a warning that the
Spaniards were on the alert
against the arrival of any more
boats from the rebel side. Sud
denly a sharp pattering fire broke
out on the extreme right of the
Spanish position, followed by the
continuous rattle of a machine
gun.
The Spanish troops from Manila were
evidently coming down the road well
back from the beach, being: only about
a, mile from the Spanish post maga-
Blne. On the beach I could see soldiers

waving their hats wildly on hearing the
approach of support from Manila.
For twenty minutes the steady rattle
t>f the machine gun and the incessant
: patter of the magazine rifles showed
that a hot action was in progress,
stopping finally as abruptly as it had
begun. Then on shore, near the scene
: of this fight, a slender column of smoke
went up, evidently a signal to Aguinal
do in Cavite.
I had not been watching what was
; going on behind me and was, therefore,
. a good deal astonished to hear the roar
of a heavy gun and for an instant sup
1 posed our warships might have taken
' a hand in the fight, as I could tell by
the scream of the projectile passing over
: me that it was fired from a rifled gun
;of large caliber. I could not see where
it stnuck, but I made out on the wall
! of Cavite groups of rebels around four
muzzle-loading rifles pointing toward
the Spanish position.
This was the card Aguinaldo had been
keeping up his sleeve. In front of the
guns was a stovepipe, throwing out a
column of smoke, like the one on the
distant beach. Aguinaldo was letting
his partisans know that he was ready
ito take part in any action, for two

SHIPS SAIL FROM GOLDEN GATE FOR MANILA.
The United States coast defense steamer Monterey and the coal ship Brutus sailed for Manila yesterday. It was expected that they would get away early in the morning, but
the coils of the distiller were not put aboard as soon as expected, so it was 1:30 p. m. before the vessels departed. Passing along the front almost every steamer in the bay saluted them and
all the flags were dipped in good-by.
The fljfet stop will be at Honolulu, where the Monterey will recoal. She will then probably proceed in tow of the Brutus or she may go along under her own steam and run in
under the lee of one of the many Islands on the way to Manila and recoal from the cargo in the hold of the Brutus. It 1b expected that the Monterey and Brutus will make the passage
in about thirty days.

MANILA, May 5 (via Hongkong, May

to those I have already cabled to the
Herald of the destruction of the Span
ish fleet In Manila, Bay by Rear Admir
al Dewey:
When the squadron sailed from Mirs
Bay on April 27 no one was aware of
ficially of the declaration of war,
though private cable advices had given
this news. At inspection on Wednes
day evening this news was communi
cated to the men and every division of
the squadron sent up cheers that
aroused the echoes.
The bandmaster of the flagship, filled
with the spirit of the occasion, made
an especial programme for the even
ing, which included all the old war
songs, among them "The Boys in Blue,"
"When Johnny Comes Marching Home"
and others, that cheered men's hearts

TERRIBLE HAVOC
WROUGHT DURING
THE BOMBARDMENT
Spaniards Retreated Before the Deadly
Aim of American Gunners and Sus
tained Severe Losses.
ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL DISPATCH BOAT SOMERS
N. SMITH, OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 7 (via Kingston, Ja
maica, June 7). â Within three hours this morning the American
fleet silenced nearly all the fortifications at the entrance of the
harbor of Santiago de Cuba. The formidable Estrella and Cayo
batteries failed to reply during the last hour of the bombardment.
They were so shattered that it is doubtful whether they can be the
least service to the Spaniards in the future. There was a heavy
fog and steady rain during the engagement.
American gunners, however ;
rose superior to the mist, and
their keen eyes, supplemented by
high skill, directed shot and shell
with terrific effect. Again the
Spaniards proved to be miserable
marksmen. They managed to
hit the battleship Massachusetts
once. Her fighting top was
struck, but that was all the dam
age. The other ships did not suf
fer, so far as can be learned.
Not one of our sailors
is reported killed. One
man on the Suwanee
was injured. I do not
know whether his inju
ries are serious. It is
believed that he was the
only sailor wounded
during the bombard
ment.
The formation of the American
ships was in double column.
About 6 o'clock in the morning
the war vessels stood off from
beetling Morro Castle.
The weather was nasty, but no
rain nor fog could depress the
spirits of the jackies, who were
eager for the tray. The ships
moved slowly to within 3000
yards of the shore. One line,
composed of the Brooklyn,
Texas, Massachusetts and Mar
blehead, turned westerly. The
flagship of Commodore Schley
led.
In the second line w r ere the
New York, New Orleans and
Yankee. The New York was at
the head of the line. The second
line moved eastwardly. Far out on
the left were the Vixen and Su
wanee, whose crews watched the
riflemen on the shore. The sail
ors on the Dolphin and Porter
guarded the right flank. Admiral
Sampson's column directed its at
tention to the new earthworks
near Morro Castle. Commodore
Schley's vessels went opposite the
Estrella and Catalina batteries.
There was no firing until the
American ships were in a most
strategic position for fighting,
fhe bad weather had evidently
caused the Spaniards to believe
that there would be no bombard
ment while the heavy rain and
fog lasted. The movement of the
ships had not been noticed appar
ently until they were close to the
batteries.
But the battleship lowa waked
the sons of Castile and Aragon
from their reveries. A shot from
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
one of her great guns hit the bat
tery with serious effect. Both
columns of the ships then poured
a fusillade of metal into the fortifi
cations and earthworks on either
side of the harbor entrance. The
Spaniards rushed to their guns
and started to blaze away wildly.
What they lacked in skill they
made up in passion. But fiery
temperaments with poorly train
ed eyes and bad nerves behind
the guns were no match for the
superior gunners of Sampson's
and Schley's columns. The Amer
icans fired with great effect, but
the Spaniards' shots were reckless
and wide of the mark. There was
a splendid chance for the enemy
to display any proficiency in
marksmanship, for the United
States war vessels remained at
their chosen stands, and did not
resort to maneuvering.
In this grand battle, great
clouds from the guns increased
the heavy fog. It was a magnifi
cent spectacle, even though the
conditions were opposed to a
thoroughly accurate survey of
what was taking place. But
glimpses left on the memory ter
rors of a bombardment by great
modern warships. Admiral Samp
son had instructed that no firing
should be directed upon Morro
Castle, for in it were imprisoned
Lieutenant Hobson and the other
seven heroes of the Merrimac's
volunteer crew.
But several shells did
strike Morro Castle on
the promontory and left
gaping wounds. It is be
lieved that the shots did
not cause sufficient
damage to occasion a
fear that Lieutenant
Hobson and his com
panions suffered.
As the bombardment pro
ceeded the ships in Commodore
Schley's column moved nearer to
the shore in order to bring
speedier destruction to the shore
batteries. This action resulted in
the Texas, Massachusetts and
Brooklyn dealing such awful
broadsides that the earthworks
were torn up and the Spanish
gunners took to their heels for
less exposed places. But these
three ships were not the only ves
sels in Schley's column that were
doing their duty. The Vixen and
Suwanee drew in close to shore
and entered the fray with start
ling zeal. These small ships ham
mered away with their rapid-fire
guns and demolished the shoreo
battery. The main interest in
Schley's column was centered in
the Estrella fortification. This
fort offered great resistance, but
when the Texas and Marblehead
trained their guns upon it at
closer range, the woodwork of
the fortification was set on fire
and the defense was silenced.
American gunners
were doing their duty in
the same glorious man
ner in the eastward col
umn from which Ad
miral Sampson was
watching the engage
ment. Cayo battery was
silenced by the New
York and New Orleans.
This required an ener
getic fire for quite a
time, but the Spaniards
were not able to endure
the sustained attacks.
Their guns- were dis
mounted and their de-
fenses were wrecked.
At the close of the second hour
of the engagement the vessels of
the American fleet turned so that
they could use their port batteries
upon what was left of the enemy's
defenses. A part of the time the
firing was not accurate, because
of the location of several fortified
points on the shore which were
difficult to hit. But in spite of
the numerous disadvantages the
American tars sent many shells
into the right places.
There was great rejoicing
among the American gunners
when they saw that the Catalina
fort was silenced. The gun in it
spoke no more and the Spaniards
were not to be seen. With the
fire added to the rain of death
dealing shells, there was no with
standing the attack.
Our fleet threw shell
after shell into the ene
my's fortifications until
11 o'clock. Then there
was no reply. The
American ships had
completed their task
with great destruction.
Rear Admiral Sampson signal
ed for the ships to stop the bom
bardment. The vessels drew off
slowly. The jackies were some
what contented; but their desires
were for a longer attack and to
destroy everything in sight.
As the warships steamed away
some Spanish gunners returned
to the very few guns that had not
been dismounted and fired a few
shells which, as usual, went very
wide of their mark. Shortly after
the engagement came to an end,
I inquired whether we had lost
any men. My questions were an
swered, "Not a man." Later I
learned that one of the men on
the Suwanee was injured.
What the loss was among the
Spaniards is, of course, only a
matter of conjecture. If they had
remained at their guns tenacious
ly they would have suffered ter
ribly, but as many did not endure
the terrific fire from our ships, it
is believed that the loss was
not enormous. But the fortifica
tions at the entrance to Santiago
harbor are certainly in ruins.
Only two small shore batteries
were not dismantled. They were
damaged to a great extent, how
ever, and cannot be considered as
offering any considerable means
of defense.
HAS CLEARED THE
WAY FOR TROOPS.
Sampson's Work Makes Easy
the Landing of Invaders at
Santiago de Cuba.
WASHINGTON, June 7. â Starting
out with a strong belief that there had
been nothing In the nature of a serious
engagement between Sampson's forces
and the Spanish defenses at Santiago
the Navy Department officials, as the
day wore on and the full and detailed
reports of correspondents with the fleet
began to flow in, were compelled to
modify their view, and when the day
closed they were about ready to admit
that, although without official informa
tion on the subject, it was evident that
Sampson had made a strong attack
upon the Spanish force.
The one point upon which they main
tained thfir confidence was that no
troops had been landed. They we're pre
pared to learn that Sampson might be
clearing the way with his big guns for
the landing of the troops, or that pos
sibly some marines had been landed
temporarily, but that forces had been
put ashore they would not admit, for
the reason that no information had
reached the War Department of the ac
tual departure of the soldiers from the
Gulf ports for Cuba. It is not de
nied, however, that every effort la
making to put the troops into Cuba at
the earliest possible moment, and this
afternoon it is believed, although no
official advices to that effect were at
hand, that the troops have actually
been embarking at Tampa to-day and
may get away to-night. The reason
for this belief is found in the admission
by officials that the troops have been
under orders to embark for some time
past.
Ihe difficulty that presented itself
5 the absence of absolutely necessary
>plies, which, in most cases, were
red away in some of the thousands
freight cars which blocked the rail
d tracks many miles out from Tar
n orders that .went forward yes
lay were of a character to cause a
edy braking of the deadlock, and if
troops now have their supplies,
ich is believed to be the case, there
io reason why they should not sail
for Santiago.
>y the newspaper reports of the
aoh Sampson has made in the coast
enses there, there is every reason to
Â»<r.ieve that little difficulty will be
j found in the actual debarkation of the
troops< particularly if marines are al
' ready ashore to guard the landing.
A suspicion is entertained in some
! quarters that Sampson was hastened In
his movements at Santiago by the news
i of the intended departure of the troops
from Tampa, and made this attack in
order that the navy might have the
honor of effecting the occupation of
! Cuban soil. It is likely that the first
troops of the regular army to take up
a position ashore will be the Engineer
I Battalion, although they are so badly
I hampered by the heavy siege trains
[ they cÂ«rry that they must be greatly
I Hayed in making a landing. These
ins, by the way, have given infinite
ouble, for the transports that were
istily chartered were so lightly con
ructed as to require a great deal of
rengthening before the great masses
! of steel could be safely placed on them.
The extent of Sampson's attack on
the Santiago defenses has brought out
one fact very clearly, namely, that he
has practically unlimited power as to
, the time and character of an attack,
and that he is unhampered by restric
tions from Washington. The exact na
ture of his orders has never been mat
public, but a naval official in a positio
I to know what they are said that Ad
miral Sampson had greater power con
ferred upon him than had ever bee
given to any commander.
It was for him to decide on the tim
| for an attack and the place and man
ncr of its execution. He may attac
before troops arrive, or, in his discre
tion, may act without the co-operatio
of troops. Or, if circumstances war
rant, he may refrain from any opera
; tions. In short, it is said that Admira
Sampson is complete master of the tac
tical and strategic operations by th
naval forces off Santiago. This is 1
line with the policy approved by th
liest naval authorities,
iptain Mahan, a member of th
r Board, brings out in his standar
k on "Sea Power" that it is for th
al commander-in-chief to organiz
direct his offensive or defensive op
ions. In referring to the brillian
ons afforded by Nelson, Rodnej
~Â«ragut and other great commander
he gives them credit for working ou
and executing the splendid campaign
. under their direction without orders o
, restraint from outside authority. Th
only reservation made in this genera
principle is that the center of the Go-\
ernment shapes general policies, and
the naval campaign is directed toward
the execution of this general purpose
of the Government.
In the present case the authorities
here have laid down the general ends
to be attained in Cuba and Porto Rico,
and the War Board has supplemented
this with every bit of information
which could assist the commander-in
chief. But beyond this Admiral Samp
; son's authority is practically without
limit. Under these circumstances the
naval authorities here have no means
j of knowing when a battle is to be ex
ecuted, or what the line of action is to
be.
TROOPS LAND AND
DEFEAT SPANIARDS
0
Insurgents Said to Have Formed
a Junction With the
. Americans.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
CAPE HAYTIEN, June 7.â A dis
patch dated at Santiago de Cuba at
midnight says during the bombard
ment of Santiago on Monday a force
of 500 troops (American) was landed at
Diaquiri, a short distance east of
Aguadores. The firing on the landing
at Aguadores, which began about noon,
was undoubtedly intended to cover
the movement by which the troops
[ were put on shore.
There was a sharp encounter with
the Spanish military forces that were
guarding the landing place, but the
only news of its result is that the Span
iards were driven back. What their
loss was is not known. The American
force is believed to have formed a
junction with the insurgents, who have
now been well supplied with arms and
ammunition and are ready to assist in
the land attack on Santiago.
The dispatch from Santiago said the
firing on the forts in front of Santiago
harbor began at a quarter before 8
o'clock. The firing did not cease until
half past 10 o'clock. It was resumed
at noon, and it was during. the second
attack that the landing at Diaquiri was
effected. V
During the bombardment 1500 projec
tiles were fired by the American yes
! sels and the damage to the Spanish
' forts is said to have been very great.
No dispatches have been received from
Santiago since Monday at midnight and
j it is believed the cable has been cut.

CAPE HAYTIEN, Haytl, June 7, 10
p. m. â According to the latest direct
advices from Santiago de Cuba, dated
Monday at midnight, the bombardment
â which began at 7:45 a. m. yesterday and
continued until 10:80 a. m. was resumed
again for a short time about midnight.
It was then believed that the Americans
had effected a Junction with the in
surgents near Daiquiri, some distance
east of Airuadores and near the railway
line to Santiago.
It is also understood here that the
Cuban troops maintained throughout
the greater part of yesterday an attack
by land upon Santiago, and the Span

SAMPSON MAKES
A BRIEF REPORT.
"Silenced the Works Quickly
Without Injury of Any Kind,"
Says the Admiral.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â Shortly af
ter 7 o'clock this evening information
confirmatory of the press dispatches
concerning the bombardment of the
fortifications of Santiago reached the
Navy Department. It came in the
form of a cablegram from Admiral
Sampson, whk-h was made public in the
following bulletin:
" Secretary of the Navy :
Bombarded forts at Santi
ago, 7:30 to 10 a. m. to
day, June 6. Silenced
works quickly without in
jury of any kind, though
within 2000 yards.
"SAMPSON."
While the officials of the Navy De
partment declined to say definitely
whether the bulletin contained all the
information given in Admiral Samp
son's cablegram, there is reason to be
lieve that it did not. The officials re
fused to discuss the subject or to
vouchsafe further information than
was posted on the bulletin board.
Only one additional point was elirit^d
by questioning. That was that the ca
blegram contained no information
about the landing of either land forces
or marines.
The information, received from Ad
miral Sampson wag evidently quite sat
isfactory to the naval authorities.
While they declined to discuss either
the reasons for or the probable conse
quences of the bombardment, they
were thoroughly satisfied with the re
sults accomplished. It is pretty well
understood that the bombardment was
for the purpose of paving the way
either for the landing of troops or
merely to cover the landing of ma
rines.
Dispatches received by the Associat
ed Press from Spanish sources to
night indicate that a landing was ef
fected, either during or immediately
after the bombardment. This is re
garded by naval authorities as entire
ly reasonable.
It is deemed likely that Sampson
landed a sufficient force of marines to
hold the ground he had gained and to
make preparation for the landing of
the regular forces upon their arrival, if
indeed, some of them are not already at
hand.
SPANISH VERSIONS
OF BOMBARDMENT
Cervera Makes Some Admis-
sions of Defeat, but Blanco
Claims the Usual Victory.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by .Tamps Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, June 7. â General Linares,
military commander at Santiago de
Cuba, has officially reported to General
Blanco that at 8 o'clock Monday morn
ing the American fleets began a com
bined attack upon the defenses fit the
entrance of Santiago de Cuba Hay. Ac
cording to his report, ten out of twen
ty-four ships were in sight during the
firing, which continued without inter
ruption during three hours. In that
time the American guns threw more
than 1500 missiles.
The Morro, Socana and Punta Gorda
batteries returned the fire. At 12 o'clock
the cannonading was begun again at
Aguadores landing and continued for
an hour. Both attacks. General Linares
says, were repelled. The firing of the
Americans damaged only the outside
of the barracks of Morro Castle, which
were built during a time of peace and
were unprotected. Cayo Smith was
struck, but the damage was not great.
General Linares also reports that the
cruiser Reina Mercedes was struck.
He says no guns at the forts were dis
mounted. He says no damage on the
American ships was visible. As it grew
dark nine of the American ships had
disappeared. He reports that the Span
ish army losses were one chief killed
and four officers and twenty-one sol
diers wounded. One navy chief and five
sailors were killed and one officer and
twelve sailors wounded. It is supposed
the American ships have had "impor
tant losses."
MADRID, June 7.â The following offi
cial dispatch has been received here
from Havana: "Colonel Aldea, com
manding a Spanish column, has had
some sharp fighting with a body of
rebels who are supporting the landing
of American forces near Santiago de
Cuba. Two American warships pro
tected the landing party. The result of
the operations is not known.
"It is supposed that the renewal of
the bombardment of Santiago, lasting
from 8 to 11 o'clock on Monday morn
ing, was intended to distract the atten
tion of the Snaniards and to enable the
landing to be effected without molesta
tion."
A later dispatch from General Aldea
says that one of his soldiers was hit
by the American shells, which, he as
serts, fell among the insurgents.
The following official dispatch has
been received from Admiral Cervera:
"Six American vessels have bom
barded the fortifications at Santiago
and along the adjacent coast. Six were
killed and seventeen wounded on board
the Reina Mercedes. Three officers
were killed and an officer and seventeen
men were wounded among the troops.
The Americans fired IDOO eheiis of dif
ferent calibers. The damage inflicted
upon the batteries of La Socapa and
Morro Castle was unimportant. The
barracks at Morro Castle suffered dam
age. The enemy had noticeable losses."
In the Chamber of Deputies, Captain
Aunon, Minister of Marine, read Ad
miral Cerveia s dispatch and a dispatch
from Blanco to the effect that General
Linares had repulsed an American at
tempt to effect a landing of troops at
Aguadores. The Senate, after hearing
Admiral Cervera's dispatch, unani
mously resolved to congratulate the
army and navy.
ORDONEZ'S DEATH
A LOSS TO SPAIN.
He Was a Noted Artillery Expert
With a European
Reputation.
LONDON, June B.â The London
morning papers are inclined to doubt
the account of the destruction and si
lencing of the forts at Santiago, but
they believe the bombardment was in
tended to draw the Spaniards' atten
tion from a landing somewhere, and
that the coming week or two will see
exciting events in Cuba.
The sinking of the Reina Mercedes is
regarded as probable, for it is known
that her boilers were defective and that
she had no armored deck. The wound
ing or death of Colonel Ordonez means
a serious loss to Spain, he being, or
having been her artillery expert, with
a European reputation and the designer
of the ordnance bearing his name.
The Cape Haytien advices of the Daily
Mail practically confirm the account
from the Associated Press boat Dandy.
All other accounts here except the
brief dispatches from Madrid emanate
from New York. A special from Ha
vana, evidently pro-Spanish, says that
nine American vessels retired, seriously
crippled, that the Reina Mercedes was
only slightly danaged and that the
American losses were heavy.
The Daily News says: "The American
Consul at Odessa has informed our cor
respondent there of a somewhat singu
lar proceeding on the part of the au
thorities at that port with regard to
some foreign steamers now chartered
as auxiliary transports for the convey
ance of troops and war materials from
Odessa to Port Arthur.
"It.appears that in the case of a Ger
man steamer named Scandia and a
French vessel, the American Consul
was applied to for certificates attesting
to owners of the steamers and the char
acter and nature as well as the destina
tion of their passengers and cargo. It
was explained by the local Russian au
thorities that this extraordinary pre
caution was taken in the event of the
vessels being compelled to put into a
Philippine port.
"As no certificate was demanded of
the Spanish Consul it would appear
that the Russians look upon the United
States as being in de facto possession
of the Philippine archipelago. The
American Consul readily gave the re
quired certificates."
NO RELIEF FOR
ADMIRAL CERYERA
Spain Without Power to Send
a Single Ship to His
Assistance.
NEW YORK, June 7.â The Herald's
correspondent at Washington tele
graphs: There is absolutely no hope for
naval re-enforcements for Admiral Cer
vera or for the blockaded city of San
tiago de Cuba. Spain is without power
to send a single ship to his assistance.
Reports of the appearance of a Spanish
squadron in the vicinity of the Wind
ward Islands or that Spanish vessels
were sighted off Madagascar, as pub
lished in Madrid, are absolutely erone
ous. Information of an authentic char
acter received by the Navy Depart
ment is to the effect that the Spanish
reserve squadron is still at Cadiz and
there is little likelihood of its ultimate
departure.
NAVAL AND LAND
FORCES DOOMED
Cervera's Fleet Will Be De-
stroyed, While Santiago
City Must Surrender.
LONDON, June 7.â A dispatch to the
Daily Mail from Cape Haytien says:
"The American victory' at Santiago de
Cuba has cleared the way for the en
trance of Admiral Sampson and the
destruction of the Spanish fleet. As
Santiago's land defenses are reported
weak, it is likely that the city will yield
to a vigorous attack.
"It is reported that the commander
of the Reina Mercedes, second in com
mand of the Spanish fleet under Cer
vera, was killed during the engagement.
The combined American and insurgent
forces are entrenched near Daiquiri,
with guns mounted in preparation for
a further movement. From Spanish
sources comes a report that a party of
Americans landed at Aguadores, but
whether it is true or not is not known
here."
Small Boats Pass the Wreck.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 7.â While
the sinking of the Merrimac in the
channel in Santiago harbor will prevent
the egress of Spanish cruisers, I under
stand torpedo boats and torpedo boat
destroyers can pass the wreck safely
because of their light draught.
INTERNATIONAL CHESS.

CASTING ABOUT
FOR PRECEDENT
McKinley Would Seize
Hawaii.
A WARNING TO CONGRESS
THREATENS TO OVERRIDE ITS
ACTION.
Report That the Islands May Be
Taken as a "War Measure"
if the Annexation Treaty
Is Beaten.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 7.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: There is still a possi
bility that the Hawaiian annexation
resolution will come up in the House
during the present week, though some
of its advocates fear a deliberate ef
fort is being made to postpone, in ac
cordance with an alleged understand
ing with certain Senators that if it is
delayed in the House until the war bill '
has been sent to the President, Con
gress will adjourn before the Senate
can act on it. If this plan is carried
out it is probable President McKinley
will take the islands as a war measure,
without waiting for the Senate to act
at the next session.
The President has full power under
law and precedent. The law he relies
upon is that of 1856, relating to guano
islands, which may be discovered or
taken possession of by citizens of the
United States and are not within the
lawful jurisdiction of any other govern
ment. The chief precedent referred to
is the taking of Amelia Island at the
mouth of St. Mary's River, Florida, by
direction of President Monroe in 1817.
Amelia Island was at that tirÂ«;e Span
ish territory, but was occupied- by a
band of pirates, which Spain failed to
suppress.
A precedent for taking foreign ter
ritory for war purposes was afforded
by General Jackson, when he pursued
the Seminole Indians into Florida, then
a Spanish possession, and took posses
sion of Spanish military posts.
NAVAL CADETS TO GET
A GLIMPSE OF WARFARE
Annapolis Men Assigned to Battle-
Ships in West Indian Waters
During Their vacation.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â The Navy De
partment has decided to give the naval
cadets at Annapolis an opportunity to see
real warfare by taking assignment on the
warships in lieu of the customary summer
vacation. As a result about half of the
second-class men and quite a number of
third-class men have been assigned to
duty on the Indiana, New York, lowa and
other ships in West Indian waters.
The assignments are not general, apply
ing to Jin entire class, but are entirely
electlve by the cadets themselves. They
are showing much eagerness for the ser
vice, as disclosed by the large number of
applications thus far made. Thp depart
ment has approved the applications in all
cp.pps. unless some personal or family ob
jection was raised. The assignments are
made to tho larpr-r ships, as they afford
the best accommodation, the smaller gun
boats and auxiliary craft not having the
room for extra men. The cadets will be
made useful mainly as signal officers.
NAVAL PROMOTIONS A
SUBJECT FOR CRITICISM
Officers Displeased With Recommen
dations Made by the
President.
WASHINGTON June 7.â The death of
Captain Grkl'.ey has removed one of the
officers set down for advancement over
their seniors on account of the victory of
Manila. The promotions recommended by
the President are the subject of much talk
between naval officers. Those who diil
not participate in the battle are naturally
displeased at "being jumped" and ttiey
are pointing out the evils of the practice,
among them being the probability that
some of the very officers advanced are
likely to be in turn jumped and so prac
tically set back by some officers now on
duty with Sampson's fleet, aho may dis
tinguish themselves in battle. These offi
cers are urging that it would be only pru
dent and fair to go slowly in tne matter
of making promotions of -hi* character,
and to await until the Sfar is ended, wh"n
all the meritorious officers may be re
warded in strict accordance with their
merit.
AS AN AUXILIARY
HOSPITAL SERVICE
NEW YORK. June 7.â Secretary Al
ger has accepted the service of the
American National Red Cross as auxil
iary to the hospital service of the
army of the United States in the fol
lowing letter to Miss Clara Barton:
"Dear Madam: The tender of the
services of the American Red Cross
made to this department through the
Department of State under date of
May 25, for mec]ical and hospital work
â as auxiliary to the hospital service of
the army of the United States â is ac

SAMPSON'S
REPORT OF
THE FIGHT
hjis Ships Y^ove Silenced
fill portifications at
7 Santiago.
Twenty-Eight Thousand American
Troops to Sail for the Cuban
Port To-Day.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 7.
Admiral Sampson's cablegram an
i nouncing the silencing of the Santiago
batteries was hurriedly deciphered by
the code experts this afternoon, but not
all of it was made public. The parts
withheld relate to future operations.
When one of the naval cipher experts
appeared with a bulletin for the press
he announced in delivering his informa
tion :
"Sampson appears to have silenced
everything in Santiago except old man
Cervera, who insists that he did no ma
terial damage in the bombardment yes
terday."
The bulletin from Sampson, as read
at the department, stated that he had
silenced the fortifications of Santiago
completely. On its heels came a Ma
drid cable announcing cheerfully that
Admiral Cervera wired his Government
the damages to the batteries were "un
important."
Cervera acknowledged, how
ever, that "some damage" was
done to Morro Castle and
Socapa and to the Morro Bar
racks, and that six men on the
Reina Mercedes were killed and
seventeen wounded ; that three
officers of the land troops were
killed and one officer and seven
teen soldiers were wounded.
It appears, then, to have been a se
rious defeat for the Spaniards, although
the afternoon press reports were, as ex
pected, considerably exaggerated. There
is no doubt, however, that ths forts, if
not utterly destroyed, have been ren
dered useless, and it is not expected
there will be any further bombardment
until the main body of our troops are
landed at Santiago.
The main Santiago expedition, which
it is said will consist of 28.oootroops.will
sail early to-morrow morning. This in
formation was received to-day from
General Shafter in a telegram to the
Secretary of War. The determination to
embark the troops at once was the re
sult of President McKinley's personal
efforts. Yesterday Secretary Alger re
ceived a telegram from General Shafter
stating that the supplies and equipments
which ought to have been distribute!
days â and perhaps week? â ago were
still locked up in the freight cars which
line the railroad tracks at Tampa, and
that it was impossible, owing to lack
of invoices and bills of lading, to^know
what the cars contained.
When this information was conveyed
to the President he was extremely an
noyed and manifested a righteous im
patience, while the War Department
officials, who had been led to believe
that the troops at Tampa were in a
practical state of equipment and ready
to leave at a moment's notice, were
greatly surprised. The messages which
were sent to Tampa yesterday were brief
and to the point. They directed Gen
eral Shafter to break open the cars, if
necessary, so that the supplies might be
taken out and promptly distributed to
the men.
General Shatter's telegram
this afternoon stated thetroops
would probably reach Santiago
and be disembarked Sunday.

The remaining cable will be seized
and operated by our troops. It is be
lieved the prospect of early occupation
of Santiago accounts for the failure
of vessels to complete the cable cutting,
for, with the remaining cable in their
hands, our naval and military forces in
Cuba will be able to communicate with
Washington, while Blanco will be as
effectually cut off from Madrid as if
the cable were cut.
The troops destined for Porto Rico
are not yet ready to depart, and it is
impossible to say when they will be
fully equipped. ,. Every effort is being
put forward to hasten the work of se
curing supplies, but there is inevitable
delay and confusion, notwithstanding
all that the contractors can do. In
course of time, however, Porto Rico
will be taken and Santiago will be in
American possession, probably, 'before
San Juan is again bombarded.
The War Department has determined
that Governors of States shall not ap
point officers to regiments or compa
nies until the maximum numerical
strength of those commands had been
attained in the respective States. This
policy was urgently recommended by
Assistant Secretary Mciklejohn weeks
ago. If it had been followed there
would have been much less confusion
and none of the controversies which
marked the organization of the service
under the first call for troops. Politi
cal influence was constantly exerted in
favor of the acceptance of commands of
minimum strength, with the result that
while an army of 125,000 was raised it
was in such a way that the three bat
talion formation is impossible and the
list of commissioned line and staff offi
cers is out of all proportion to the en
listed force.
As a result of this it will take 42.000
men of the second call to brin^ the regi
ments and companies already in the vol
unteer service up to their requisite
strength, leaving a force of 33,000 which
will be organized strictly in accordance
with the rules which apply to the three
battalion formation.
The officials will profit by the ex
perience of the past two months and
will raise regiments and companies and
then call for the commissioning of offi
cers by the Government.
The troops at Fort -Iyer and Wash
ington barracks are jubilant over the an
nouncement that they will be sent to
the Philippines.
Orders have been issued directing
Light Battery D, Sixth Artillery, Cap
tain Alex B. Dyer, which is stationed
at the barracks at the arsenal, and Light
Battery G, Sixth Artillery, Captain Vic
tor H. Bridgman, staiioned at Fort
Myer, to proceed to San Francisco im
mediately and report to General MeÂ»Â»
ritt. They will leave as soon as trans
portation has been arranged.
Both batteries are in excellent shape
and are expected to prove a valuable
addition to the force to be led by Gen
eral Merritt. The Philippine expedi
tions are being strengthened wherever
possible by the addition of trained and
experienced regulars. In this it is evi
dent that General Merritt's demand for
regulars rather than volunteers has been
complied with by the department.
In addition to the regular artillery
men ordered from this city, it is stated
at the War Department 900 regulars
have been sent from Fort McPherson
for the purpose of filling out the ranks
of the regular regiments already at
San Francisco.INSURGENTS
TRIUMPH IN
EACH BATTLE
Continued from First Pace.
miles along the water front on the
Spanish position. Men in brown skins
and a very limited amount of clothes
began to run toward the Spanish.
Glasses enabled me to see every move
of both parties better than if I had
actually landed. The rebels took ad
vantage of every point of cover, mak
ing short rushes in groups of ten and
twenty. Many of the Spaniards where
wholly out of sight inland, but their
Mauser rifle shots came skipping out
into the water in such numbers as
spoke better for the rapidity of their
fire than for its accuracy. Occasionally
a man would -â¢Â» down on the beach,
there to lie motionless for the rest of
the day or to crawl painfully to cover.
The weather unfortunately, was
comparatively cool, and the sky so
overcast that I was unable to get a
single photograph. The Spaniards
were not now doing any cheering. At
every one of their posts that I could
see they were hugging cover far more
tenaciously than were the insurgents.
Consequently their casualties were
fewer. A field piece at Baemor Church
was firing frequently trying to sweep
the beach to the westward.
At 10 minutes past 2 o'clock one of
the heavy guns of the Cavite battery
belched forth again, the shot this
time striking the water close to the
magazine. The effect on the garri
son was positively ludicrous. Twen
ty men grabbed a flagstaff about
thirty feet long, bearing a white flag,
and raised it to a standing position.
In their haste they lost control of the
pole and it fell.
A second time it had the same fate.
Then it was lifted the third time and
was carried toward a point in plain
sight of the Cavite guns. The Spanish
garrison, however, tried to escape to
ward Bacor, with all their arms and
quantities of stores that they took from
the magazine buildings, but they were
intercepted and forced to surrender.
Now the little brown men began to
swarm along the beach, forward to
Bacor Church, the only place where the
Spaniards seemed in force, except at
Old Cavite. A field piece fired a few
shots and rifle reports were frequent,
but the bullets did not come my way,
showing that the rebels were pressing
them harder from the shore side than
from the other. The insurgent flag
was raised on an arched stone building
near Old Cavlte, and another rebel
squad was seen pursuing about fifty
Spaniards along the beach. Far to the
left of the general fighting ground these
men surrendered and were marched to
ward Bacor.
Still further toward Manila a great
column of smoke arose inland, and
flames shooting to the height of 100 feet
showed that the Spaniards retreating
toward Manila had fired the town of
Las Pinas. Frequent charges were
made on their position around Bacor
Church, and I saw many more fall dead
or wounded. Rome of the latter dragged
themselves down to the water's edge
for the purpose of bathing their
wounds.
Then a savage charge was made to
ward the church. The field pieces spoke
once, twice and were silent. The rat
tle of the rifles became more rapid and
suddenly stopped without a scattering
shot to break the stillness.
No one remained on the beach ex
cept the dead and wounded Philip
pine islanders. Presently two of
wounded men staggered to their feet,
waved their hats and sank down ex
hausted, but victorious. Over the
roof of Bacor Church appeared the
rebel flag, a band of red above and
blue below, with half of a white dia
mond next the flagstaff.
AH that remained untaken wan
around Old Cavite battery. The in
surgents began firing slowly at the
old church where the Spaniards were
known to have their headquarters, and
a white flag was hoisted over the earth
works commanding the peninsula lead
ing from Cavite to the mainland.
As night and bad weather were com
ing, I reluctantly returned to the fleet
without learning the losses on both
sides or the extent of the rebel vic
tory.
In the morning, before the battle be
gan, I visited the Spanish officers who
had been captured in previous skir
mishes. I found fifteen, among whom
were the following: Commandant Ful
gencio Repazos. Lieutenants Ferragut
and Arber, all of the marine infantry:
Captain Eustaguio Soler and Lieuten
ants Pirapiere, Vagua, Jeojoc and Mos
quera, all of the Seventy-fourth Regi
ment.
The rebels treated their prisoners
with kindness and gave them excellent
quarters.
General Agulnaldo last Tuesday Is
sued three short proclamations.
The first explained that he had re
turned as dictator because the Span
lards had not carried out the promised
reforms In government.
The other two, addressed to the Phil
ippines, called on them to respect the
rights of property and observe the rules
of war, decreeing death to any one who
Hhould be guilty of murder, robbery,
nrson or assault upon women. He has
â vnrned all Spaniards and foreigners'
that persons coming Into his lines as
Spaniards will be hanged.
It Is reported In Manila that a native
regiÃMOt deserted to the rebels last
Saturday after killing its Spanish offi
cers; also that Colonel Pena, an artil
lery officer, sent out from Spain to
fortify Manila harbor, committed sui
cide on account of the Insufficient
means of defense provided by the Span
ish Government,
MANILA, June 1, via Hongkong,
.Juno 7.~-The influence of Agulnaldo 1b
again firmly established. Thousands
are enlisting in the rebel ranks
throughout the province. Aguinaldo
has commenced his march on Manila
from Cavite. He has arrived at the
rivtr near the Spanish outposts. Th^
Spaniards attacked the rebels in an
entrenched position at Seapole on Mon
day. May 30.
After ten hours' severe fighting
the Spaniards were forced to re
tire, with heavy losses, leaving
400 killed and wounded.
The rebels advanced and are occupy
ing both banks at Seapole. Their posi
tion is strong. The rebels are now well
armed, and they used field machine
guns with deadly effect.
The rebels, 5000 strong, engaged the
Fourth, Sixth and Eleventh Cazadores,
with several companies of the Sixty
eighth and Seventy-fourth regiments.
During the engagement the
Seventy-fourth deserted, killing
its officers and annihilating a
company of Spanish infanteria
marine, of which only twelve
survived.
On Tuesday a typhoon Increased the
! suffering of the Spanish troops, there
1 being no food supply to forward to
i them. With 3000 reinforcements the
| Spaniards are now attacking the rebel
position. There has been incessant fir-
Ing for the last two hours. The railway
from Manila to Dagupar has been cut
in eight places. Aguinnldo wrote to the !
director apologizing that it was neces
sary to stop the food supplies of Ma
nila, as he did not wish to bombard or
cause a disgraceful massacre.
At the railway station the rebels
murdered three priests, and some Span- i
iards were wounded. A lady and child i
one year old were trampled to death.
The province of Tarlac is in the
rebels' hands. Food is still fairly
cheap and plentiful, but with the rail- |
way cut and the rebels closing in sup
plies will soon stop. Admiral Dewey
allows foreign residents to embark on
steamers in the bay for safety.
In a sharp fight in the province of
Bulacan the Spaniards were outnum
bered and defeated. All the Spaniards
in the provinces are in imminent dan
ger. The Spanish losses were severe
in the last three days. It is reported
that the captain-general has ordered
the troops not to attack the rebels, but
to defend the outposts, and, if they are
untenable to retire to Manila.
MANILA, June 3, via Hongkong,
Jur.e 7. â The typhoon that came on last
Monday blew itself out before Wednes
day morning. No injury was done to
the ships. All day Wednesday there
was severe fighting on the road be
tween Cavite and Manila, the Spaniards
having sent 3000 men to relieve their
i troops in Cavite Province. A narrow
j dofile on the road was successfully held
by the insurgents with 500 men and
j four small field guns.
Early yesterday the rebels at
tacked and captured Imus, the
principal Interior town of the Ca
vlte province, taking 250 prison
ers and four or five Krupp field
guns and a large quantity of
ammunition.
About noon I crossed the bay in a na
tive canoe and went to the rebel camp
at Old Cavite, where I sought out
Brigadier General Thomas Mascado,
commanding the troops. He gave me
a guide to the front, where I found he
had wholly surrounded the solid stone
church in Old Cavite and was pre
pared to starve out the garrison. I
went to the bridge, where the rebel flag
was hoisted last Monday. I found he
had barricaded it with large stones
taken from the coping on the rebel side.
While I was taking a photograph of
this barricade and the rebels behind it
the Spaniards in the church opened fire
with Mauser rifles. As the distance
was only two hundred yards they
ought to have hit several, but they suc
ceeded in hitting only one man in the
Jaw. The firing had been caused ap
parently by the crowd around my ko
dak, for as soon as we had taken to
cover and returned the fire the Span
iards stopped.
I found the country most difficult to
traverse, except on a few roads that
penetrate it. There is a thick tropical
growth over most of the territory and
the water is covered by green slime an
inch thick. I saw many natives idling
about thatched houses in the different
villages I passed through, but all
looked underfed. The young men.
however, are enthusiastic and brave,
forming the bulk of the rebel fighting
material.
The British gunboat Swift sails for
Hongkong to-day (June 3) carrying

Aguinaldo's troops last night
captured San Franciscode Mala
bon, taking prisoners 500 Span
iards, the Governor of the prov
ince, a colonel of infantry and
a large numberof other officers.
The town of Bataan. on the op
posite shore in Manila Bay, was
also captured, with 100 pris
oners.
Following Is a summary of
Aguinaldo's work since his land-
Ing here two weeks ago: He has
assembled a force of 3000 men
with arms; he has fought many
skirmishes; two good batteries
have been captured; the whole
province of Cavite has been
taken; 1600 Spaniards are
prisoners; he has supplied his
men with 2000 Mauser rifles
from abroad, and 2000 maga
zine rifles and six field guns
taken from the Spaniards.

CERVERA TRICKED
BY A CABLEGRAM

NEW YORK, June 7.â When the news of Naval
Constructor Hobson's daring exploit was received early
on Sunday morning the Herald sent a message to Ad
miral Cervera requesting him kindly to say whether the
Americans were safe and offering to convey through the
Herald any message the men might desire to send to
their friends at home. The following reply was received
to-day from the Spanish Admiral:
"SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 7.
"HERALD, New York: Prisoners no longer submit
ted to my authority, but to Lieutenant General Linares,
commander-in-chief, Santiago, Cuba. Prisoners treated
as Spanish officers same rank. All are in good health.
"CERVERA."
This is the first positive information received in this
country that Admiral Cervera is in Santiago. There
have been rumors of phantom fleets from various points
in the West Indies, and with each rumor was associated
the possibility that Cervera had escaped from the Cuban
port with part of his fleet. The message sent by the
Spanish admiral to the Herald effectually disposes of
these rumors and proves beyond doubt that Cervera, as
well as his fleet, is in the harbor of Santiago.

DIFFICULTIES IN
MERKITTS PATH
Grave Problerr) Confronts the
Governor-General of the
Philippine Islands.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â The press
reports of the fierce fighting that has
been going on in the Philippines, be
tween the insurgents and the Span
iards, were read with the greatest In
terest at the Navy Department, where
the officials realize the very grave na
ture of the problem that confronts Ad
miral Dewey. The naval officers say
the administrative difficulties with
which Admiral Dewey must contend are
indicative of what may be expected by
Major-General Merritt, when he
reaches the Philippines.
A complete understanding of the na
ture of the agreement that exists be
tween Admiral Dewey and Chief Agui
naldo seems to be lacking here, but
from the fact that some of the press
reports state the insurgent leader is re
ceiving the surrender of Spanish troops
and has proclaimed himself dictator pro
tempore, General Merritt's functions as
Military Governor will be very lim
ited. .
AGUINALDO WRITES
OF HIS VICTORIES
Leader of the Insurgents Says
l-je Has Two Thousand
Spanish Prisoners.
LONDON, June B.â The Hongkong
correspondent of the Daily Mail says:
United States Consul Wlldman has re
ceived the following letter from Aguin
aldo, the Insurgent leader.
"Before opening an attack upon any
town I summon the Spanish officer In
command to surrender. In one case
one of the officers so summoned replied
by stating that the garrison was not
quite ready to fight, and he asked me if
I would defer the attack for three
hours. I complied.
"The first engagement we had with
the Spanish occurred on May 28, when
we captured nineteen, with their arms
and ammunition. Toward evening we
hemmed them in. One hundred and
ninety cazadores and seventy loyal na
tives participated. We lost four killed.
The Spaniards lost sixteen killed, in
cluding one officer. The result of this
engagement was that fighting became
general throughout the province of Ca
vite. After four days' fighting over
2000 Spaniards, were taken prisoners,
including many officers and General
Leopoldo Pana, Governor of Cavite,
who handed me his sword, revolver and
golden belt and a formal letter of sur
render."
An American naval captain writes as
follows:
"In my opinion the rebels have un
dergone a radical change since the ad
vent of Aguinalda The Spaniards
have. lost all during the time he has
been here, and if our people don't hurry
there won't be any Spaniards left at
the end of the fight. The American
ships have taken no part in the fight
ing. Neither boats nor men have been
landed, and reports to the contrary
are false. Dispatches from Manila say
that Aguinaldo Is doing splendid work.
On Monday of last week he routed the
Spaniards, taking 400 prisoners, among
them twenty-eight officers. On the
Wednesday following he took fifty
prisoners and four field pieces in a bat
tle at a point between Cavlte and Ma
nila, On Thursday, when this dis
patch left Manila, he had cornered 190
Spaniards In an old church at Cavite
and, not caring to bombard, he was
starving them.
"He treats his prisoners well. Four
towns are now in the possession of the
rebels. It is reported that the Gov
ernor-General wanted to surrender, but
his officers prevailed upon him to hold
out. The captain of the province of
Batanga has been taken by the insur
gents, and the Governor attempted to
commit suicide. The Governor of Mal
abar is also a prisoner. The insur
gents of the other provinces are ad
vancing on Manila."
A proclamation issued by Aguinaldo.
the Insurgent chief, points to a desire
to set up a native administration in the
Philippines under an American protec
torate. Aguinaldo, with an advisory
council, would hold the dictatorship un
til the conquest of the Islands, and then
would establish a republican assem
bly.
INCREASING THE
FORTIFICATIONS
Great Activity Among the Spaniards
at Havana, Who Expect an
Attack.
HAVANA, June 6 (delayed in trans
mission).âWork on the fortifications
about Havana is being pushed without
an hour's intermission. Even the civil
governor of Havana and all the em
ployes of the Government are at work
on the forts or batteries and all persons
out of work are finding similar employ
ment.
The cultivation zones are turning out
very successfully, and are proving a
great relief to the poor.
It is announced from the palace that a
Spanish column has defeated an insur
gent force near Palisade, in. the prov
ince of Pinar del Rio. The insurgents
are said to have left seventeen men
dead on the field. The Insurgents, it
appears, were almost naked. The Span
iards admit they lost fifteen men killed.
In a number of encounters which
have taken place recently between the
Spaniards and the insurgents the form
er claim to have killed thirty-seven of
the latter, to have destroyed several
camps and thirty-three huts and to
have captured a quantity of arms and
ammunition.
RENEWAL OF THE
RIOTS AT BELFAST
Nationalists Attack a Body of Orange

Called Out.
BELFAST, June 7.â A1l was quiet here
to-day. The troops were withdrawn this
morning. During the rioting yesterday
103 policemen were injured and over 100
civilians were treated at the hospitals.
To-night there was a renewal of the
rioting that began yesterduy during the
demonstrations in honor of the revolution
of 1798 and anniversary of June <J, ISS6,
when seven civilians wore shot on Shank
Hill road by the constabulary.
The Nationalists attacked a body of
Orangemen who were leaving their work
and there was a veritable hurricane of
scrap iron and other missiles. The police
at first were overpowered, but having
been reinforced they cleared the streets
wtth a free use of their clubs.
The military has been ordered out, and
it is feared there will be a renewal of the

DANGERS FACED BY
HOBSON AND MEN
i Many Big Guns Passed by the Mer
rimac on the Way to
Destruction.
WITH THE FLEET OFF SANTI
AGO DE CUBA, June 3, via Kingston,
Jamaica, June 7.â To appreciate the
great danger of the Merrimac expedi
tion, the character of the defenses of
the harbor of Santiago de Cuba must
be known. The entrance to the broad
and deep harbor on which the city faces

I height of 180 feet. At one point the
J neck of this approach is less than 300
j feet wide and only five and a half fath

On a hill on the eastern side of the
[ harbor is Morro Castle, with five 24
pounders, five 18-pounders and two
modern rapid fire guns. On the west-
I crn hilltop are two batteries with mod

are several guns loaded with shrapnel,
designed to sweep the face of the water,
and opposite is a similar battery. Going
around the first curve of the narrow en

facing down the harbor with a battery

In the narrow nock of the passage
are three rows of mines, each row fifty

LUCK WENT
HAND IN HIND
WITH VALOR
Continued from First Page.
In tent and forecastle more than thirty
years ago. But the greatest joy was
aroused when, at the end of the con
cert, "The Star Spangled Banner" was
played and sung, arousing the enthu
siasm of all hands forward nnd aft.
Drills were incessant and these in
cluded everything pertaining to the
management of a battery in action and
to the day and night signal practice.
When the Island of Luzon was sight
ed, final battle preparations were made.
The ships were cleared for action. All
unnecessary material was thrown over
board, splinter nets were rigged and the
ships put into complete fighting trim
above and below.
Off Subig Bar the Boston and Con
cord were sent ahead to reconnoiter,
and later the Baltimore Joined them,
but the quest was in vain, for nothing
was found in this inlet except a few
small craft. When these ships rejoined
the other vessels Commodore Dewey
called a council of war, and as soon as
the commanding officers returned to
their ships it leaked out that the Com
modore had told his companions of his
intention to enter Manila Kay that
night, basing this proposed anchorage
on his certainty that the Spaniards,
with their fatal policy of delay, would
not expect him.
The speed of the squadron was soon
increased to eight knots, and, with all
lights doused, the ships draw quickly
under the land. The entrance was made
through the chief channel â Boca
Grande it is calledâ and it was not until
after the vessels had parsed the nar
rowest part of this channel that a shot
greeted them. A few signal rockets
had been seen previously, but neither
mine nor gun had been fired.
Shortly after 11 o'clock, however, the
sound of heavy guns and the shriek of
shot far overhead Bhowed that the nap
ping foe had been awakened and that
the first hostile shot of the war in tho
far east had been fired.
The Raleigh, which was third in line,
returned a shot from one of her 5-inch
guns, and almost at the same time the
Boston followed her. Then came an
other shot from the battery on Corregi
dor, but high over head, and the Con
cord in answer laid a 6-lnch shell so
squarely over the place whence this gun
had been fired that the fleet felt certain
Something must have been hit. At any
rate it stopped the fire. We learned
afterward that it had been most ef
fective.
The speed was now reduced to below
three knots, as the commodore desired
to reach Manila at the earliest dawn
and to give his men some rest before
the stout work laid out for them was
to be taken up.
When day broke at half-past 4 o'clock
the ships wore about six miles from
town. As they slipped along in the
shadows they discovered first a group
of merchant ships, and then, dimly
ranged under Cavite, the Spanish
squadron.
Our vessels steamed up the roads in
columns, the flagship leading, followed
by the Baltimore, Raleigh. Petrel, Con
cord and Boston, in the order named.
The American squadron first passed
to the north of Manila, and then shaped
a southerly course toward the bay of
Cavite, where the surprised and
startled vessels of the enemy were
massed. The senior Spanish officer was
Rear -Admiral Montijo Pasaron, and
his flagship was the Reina Crlstina,
Captain Cadarzo, who was killed in the
engagement.
The other vessels were the Castllla,
Isla de Cuba, Isla de Luzon, Don An
tonio de Ulloa, Don Juan de Austria,
General Lezo and Marques del Duoro.
The Velasco was also at anchor under
going repairs but her battery had been
removed and mounted on earthworks
on shore.
In addition to all this were the trans
ports Manila and Isla de Mindanao, one
of which was captured and the other
destroyed, and four torpedo boats, two
of which were sunk during the action.
Though inferior in strength to our
6hips the vessels were superior when
supported by the heavy shore batteries,
and the gunners, knowing at all times
the exact distance of our ships, had all
the elements of accurate gunnery on
their side.
Commodore Dewey k<-pt his ships
constantly moving and in all made the
circuit five times in front of the enemy.
As Been from the Olympla it did not
appear possible that our ships could
have escaped without serious damage
in material and great loss of life, for
the shells burst close around all the
ships of our squadron. Although we
knew that the flagship had escaped it
did not seem reasonable to hope that
the other vessels had enjoyed an equal
fortune.
In the beginning of the action I at
tempted to count the number of shells
which came across our bow or burst
near us, but this soon became tiresome
and, indeed, impossible woTk, for one
can rarely catch sight of a shell com
ing straight or nearly end on until It
has passed him.
And so the fight went on, every mo
ment adding to the certainty of our
victory, and every circuit past the
Spanish fleet developing more and more
'lie weakness of their fire and their
want, not of courage, but of skill and
'-.111.
After we drew off, In order to give
the men a chance for breakfast and a
little rest, enthusiastic congratulations
passed from ship to ship and every
body got ready for the final encounter.
Finally the signal was made to go in
a second time, the Baltimore in the
lead, and as she shot like an unleashed
gTeyhound for her quarry the cheers
tha* went up from the Olympia' s crew
were surpassed only by those given the
Petrel, the "little battle-ship," as they
call her now, when she dashed into the
inner harbor and fought to a finish the
vessels that were still afloat.
The affair began at 5 o'clock in the
morning and was finished at half-past
12, and as the bugler sang "cease fir
ing" and the boatswain's whistlers
trilled "pipe down" not a Spanish flag
was afloat, while the flag of surrender
had taken its place over the battered
walls of Cavlte's arsenal.
The day after the action the cable to
Hongkong was cut by the steamer Za
firo because the Spanish Governor had
forbidden the operators to send any of
our messages, and on Tuesday six bat
teries at the entrance of the bay were
seized by the Baltimore and Raleigh.
In the meantime our force had taken
possession of Cavite, had transferred to
Manila the Spanish wounded and had
buried the Spanish dead.
NOTHING COULD
HAVE WITHSTOOD
DEWEY'S ATTACK
Chief Gunner Evans Says the
Americans Fought LiKe
Veritable Demons.
The heart of the nation and the ad
miration of the world have been stirred
by the story of Manila. It has been
told often. The bravery of the Ameri
can commander, his defiance of the
guns of the enemy, his assurance that
against the pluck of his men nothing
could stand, has passed into history, so
rapidly has history been made since the
day Commodore Dewey â now, by virtue
of merit, Admiral Deweyâ was told to
capture or destroy the Spanish fleet in
the Philippines. How courageously he
undertook the task, how he carried it
through, has become as a tale that is
told.
But yesterday the Belgic from the
far-away Asiatic station steamed in at
the Golden Gate. On board of her were
men who had been part of Dewey's
force, men who had been on the ships
which passed the guns of Cavite that
morning of the Ist of May, who had
stood by the thundering cannon when
they had said to the Spanish that noth
ing but death or defeat awaited them.
The arrival of these men renewed in
terest in the grand and unequaled feat
of Dewey. The incidents imperfectly
conveyed by cable they have at thfir
tongue's end. And yet they tell these
as if they had had no part In the glori
ous event which gave America a place
among nations such as ahe had never
before occupied.
One of these men is Joel C. Evans.
He was chief gunner on the Boston,
and though his time of sea service had
expired he managed to stay with his
ship. He knew that a battle was im
pending and he wished to be in it.
Evans is the most modest of mortals.
Upon his garments is no smell of fire,
and yet he was on duty all the time the
squadron passed before the forts of
Cavite, beyond to the point at which
the Spanish lay at anchor, and saw the
ships of Castile sent to the bottom or
given to the flames, which in some in
stances raged for days before the
charred hulk sank beneath the waters.
"Was anybody scared as the ships
approached Manila?" Mr. Evans was
asked as he meditatively smoked a
cigar.
"Well," he responded, "there was one
man who seemed to think of danger.
He was an old man whose term of serv
ice had nearly expired. As we got near
Manila, where we had every reason to
believe we would not be welcome, he
seemed to be scared. But, bless you, the
minute the real business began he had
not a thought of fear. He was too
busy. I do not deny that I felt a bit
shaky myself, but the feeling passed
away.
"Of course," continued Mr. Evans,
"the whole thing has been related.
Your man Stickney was by Dewey on
the bridge of the Olympia, and as cool
as a cucumber. He would take notes
in the thickest of the fight, or a snap
shot when there was a good oppor
tunity. His coolness was like that of
the men of the whole fleet. They were
all eager to defeat the enemy, and yet
some of the men in their anxiety to see
the fight had to be recalled to attention
to their duties. They wanted to look
out and see how things were progress
ing. There was not one among them
who manifested a disposition to shirk.
The work they had was terrific. They
toiled in an atmosphere which was well
nigh unendurable, and kept at their
posts until they fell from exhaustion.
"The whole affair was remarkable.
During the engagement the flagship
hoisted many signals, and for all the
smoke and excitement there was not
one of the signals but what was read
and obeyed. Our first engagement was
in the early morning, and when we
withdrew and the signals flashed from
ship to ship that not a man had been
killed there was a cheer that was an
inspiration. When the engagement was
renewed the men went into it with a
spirit simply invincible. Nothing could
have withstood them. They had the
confidence of veterans and the enthu
siasm of patriots.
"How many of the Spanish were
killed will never be known. That they
fought bravely, nobody who was there
will deny. I have a particular admira
tion for the captain and crew of the
San Juan de Ulloa. This ship simply
would not surrender. The carnage on
board of her, as on some of the other
ships, must have be<m dreadful, but her
colors were flying to the last and her
guns boomed as long as they were
above water. She went down with
every flag streaming, although shot to
pieces and her decks strewn with dead.
"There were many narrow escapes;
this was inevitable. One shell pene
trated the Baltimore, cut through sev
eral partitions, struck thÂ£ inside of a
shield, which forms the segment of a
circle, scored it from side to side and
then failed to explode. It will be kept
as a relic of the battle.
"I do not pretend to say why the
Spanish did not hit us. for the shells
were flying all about. They cannot
shoot, that Is certain, for. Including the
forts and the ships, they had more guns
than we had.
"On the Boston were elghtepn Chinese
servants. They had boÂ»n accustomed
to no harder work than making beds or
waiting at the table, and yet during
the engagement they manned the
"whips' and worked until tholr hands
were raw, and after th*Â» excitement
was over went about their regular rou
tine as if nothing had happened. One
of them said to m*Â»: 'If I can't land In
America now. I'll write t o President
McKlnley about it." I told him. as I
looked at his bleeding hands, that I
thought he ought to be allowed to
land."
Many incidents did Fvans tell of the
fightâ the stealthy approach to the
harbor, the passing of the silent forts^
each expected momentarily to belch
forth its leaden protest, the steady, on
ward sweep of the squadron, the futile
but courageous resistance of the Span
ish fleet. He paid a high tribute to
Captain Gridley of the Olympia. whose
body Is now on the sea. coming back to
the land of the captain's birth and of
his affection.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 1395.
SPAIN COMPLAINS
OF YANKEE TACTICS.
MADRID, June 7. â Duke Almodevar de Rio,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, has mailed to all the Em
bassadors of Spain a note and memorandum declar
ing the United States has violated international law
by capturing Spanish vessels before a declaration of
war, by bombarding ports without notification and
using the Spanish flag at Guantanamo.
fit for duty, but he could not be kept
away from it. He fought his ship
brilliantly, but the strain, the excite
ment, and above all the tremendous
concussion of the guns was too much
for him in his weakened condition. He
died as truly a martyr to his country
as though struck by one of the shells
singing all around him."
He told of one youngster on the
Boston who had the knack of lettering,
and on every gun and magazine, wher
ever there was space, this youth had
chalked, "Remember the Maine."
"And," said Evans, "the boys re
membered the Maine."
Admiral Montijo, the gunner re
garded as a brave man. He related
that the admiral did not desire to go
back to Manila. He was offered the
hospitality of the flagship, but, draw
ing himself up proudly, said he could
not accept shelter on a ship flying the
American flag.
"Then," said Lambertson, chief of
staff, "you will have to go back to Ma
nila. We cannot haul down the Amer
ican flag for you."
And the admiral went.
Later the house of the admiral was
visited. On the porch was the break
fast table set, coffee cold in the pot,
boiled eggs waiting, and through the
house the scars left by four shells. In
one of the rooms somebody had been
killed or injured, for there was blood on
the walls.
Mr. Evans revealed a fact nnt gener
ally known In relation to the Governor
General who Issued the proclamation
which made him the laughing stock of
the world. The Governor simply fled,
lip put affairs into the hands of a com
mission and took to the woods. He was
sure the Americans could not fight â
that they came with undisciplined
crews and Incompetent commanders â
but all the same he had gone away
upon their approach. He was less a
fool than his proclamation would seem
to Indicate.
The sea term of Mr. Evans Is over.
He is now on his way East and hardly
knows what to expect, but to be or
dered aboard some Atlantic ship would
not startle him and he would like to be
under Schley, with whom he was in the
Arctic and in whom he has the great
est confidence. But wherever he may
go he will not forget Manila, where the
cannon grew hcÂ«t and the shells whis
tled and the men staid by their guns
until they fell, fainting: where civili
zation shot its way into the Orient, and
the stars and stripes were unfurled and
their mastery for the first time ac
knowledged.
MEN WHO FOUGHT
WITH DEWEY TELL
OF HIS VICTORY
American Seamen Behaved as
on Dress Parade While De
stroying Spain's Fleet.
The Occidental and Oriental Com
pany s Belglc arrived from Hongkong
via Yokohama and Honolulu yesterday
with three Important personages
aboard. They are Dr. C. P. Kindle
berger, U. S. N., surgeon on the cruiser
Olympia; Colonel C. A. Loud, pay
master on the dispatch boat Hugh Mc-
Culloch, and J. C. Evans, gunner on
the cruiser Boston. These gentlemen
were eye-witnesses of the great naval
battle in Manila Bay. Their story of
the combat bears out In every detail
the graphic account cabled to The Call
by its special correspondent, Lieutenant
J. L. Stickney, who was on Admiral
Dewey's flagship during the fight.
Speaking of Lieutenant Stickney Dr.
Kindleberger said yesterday:
"One of the coolest men in the en
tire fleet was J. L. Stickney, the cor
respondent of The Call-Herald. He
' stood on the bridge with Commodore
Dewey throughout the entire action
1 and he was the only correspondent
j who witnessed the battle."
In describing the battle of Manila
Colonel Loud said:
"At one time I really thought -we
would be beaten. This was after the
I fire had been kept up for an hour. It
I looked like every gun on the Spanish
ships had turned loose on us all to
gether, and the shore line was a veri
table blaze of fire from the batteries.
j The din was simply indescribable. Tons
upon tons of shot fell over our ships.
Yes, there was steel enough to have
sunk our entire fleet.
"Our salvation was in the bad marks
manship of the Spaniards. They
handled their r^ces like boys. Nearly
all of their shot went wide of the mark.
Most were high, flying over the fleet
I and failine into the bay beyond. Some
I of the batteries, however, were better
j trained. Several guns maintained a
raking fire on the fleet. Nearly all of
our ships were struck by both large and
I small shut, but no damage of conse
quence was done.
"The report you had that a solid
shot entered the engine-room of the
Baltimore is erroneous. This shot
crossed the deck from the port side,
Ftruck in an open turret, was turned
back and passed out on the same side
again. No damage was done to the
vessel, and the two or three men hurt
at the time were merely scratched or
starred by flying splinters.
"The only man really hurt in the
fight was a seaman who accidentally
sustained a broken leg. This was par
tially catised by the Spanish fire, but
mostly by his own carelessness. Lie\i
tenant Kellogg was merely scratched.
He never left his post, and was all
right again in a few minutes. Of the
other six men reported injured, none
received more than flesh scratches.
"When the troops arrive from Stin
Francisco, .Commodore Dewey will de
mand the immediate surrender of the
city and the troops stationed there.
If a refusal is given, fire will at once
be opened from the warships and for
cible possession will be taken at once.
There Will be no difficulty in holding
Mj'.iiila and the Philippines. Complete
subjugation of the Spanish fortes in
the group will be accomplished without
trouble and with very little danger to
American life." t
Dr. Kindleberger gives a graphic ac
count of the fight. He was on the
Olympia through it all. In the first
assault, the flagship took the lead, the
other vessels following In her wake at
four ships' length. The Spanish fleet
was approached by laps, each turn
bringing the contestants nearer to
gether. By this plan the American
vessels frequently poured broadsides
into the enemy but were themselves
more exposed to the fire.
"At one time the smoke became bo
i .dense thai it was necessary U> draw
aside, allowing the cloud to lift," said
Dr. Kindleberger. "The vessels were
examint?d, and it was discovered that
they had sustained no damage. Break
fast was served to the men, and in a
few minutes they re-entered the fight
with the greatest enthusiasm. The
second fight was even more severe than
the first. It was in that the Baltimore
was struck.
"During the first fight the Spanish
admiral's ship steamed bravely out of
the line to meet the Olympia. The
entire American fleet concentrated fire
on her and she was so badly injured
that she turned around to put back.
At this juncture the Olympia let fly
an 8-inch shell which struck her stern
and pierced through almost her en
tire length, eaplodingfinally in the en
gine-room, wrecking her machinery.
This shell killed the captain and sixty
men and set the vessel on fire.
"The Spanish admiral immediately
transferred his flag to the cruiser Isla
de Cuba. Several smaller vessels of
the American fleet, led by the Boston,
centered their fire on this ship and lit
erally tore her to pieces. The admiral
was slightly wounded and escaped in a
small boat Into Bakor Bay and finally
to Manila.
'In the heat of the fight two tor
pedo-boats moved out to attack the
cnn y were allow ed to come within
800 yards, when a fusillade from the
Olympia sent one to the bottom with
all on board, and riddled the other. The
second boat was later found turned up
on the beach covered with blood.
"In the second fight the Baltimore
was sent to silence the fort at Cavite.
She plunged into a cloud of smoke,
and opened all her batteries on the
fortifications. In a very few minutes
a shell struck in the ammunition and
the fort blew up with a deafening
roar. The work/of the Baltimore was
glorious. After the principal ships
had been destroyed the Concord Ra
leigh and Petrel, being of light draught,
were sent close in to handle the re
maining vessels of the fleet. They made
quick work of them.
"Several tugs and a large number of
launches and small boats were cap
tured. The vessels destroyed were three
cruisers, eight gunbo-ats and two tor
pedo vessels. The series of fortifica
tions at Cavite. neighboring arsenal
\ind the fort on Couegider Island .it the
head of the bay were captured. In
taking possession of the land forts sev
eral hundred wounded Spaniards fell
into the hands of the Americans and
nearly two hundred were accounted for
on the spot. Holes In which numbers
had been hastily buried were found.
The dead were returned to relatives, as
far as this could be done, and the
wounded were cared for in the best
manner by the American surgeons.
"The Spanish loss footed up 400 killed
and 600 wounded and a property loss
of anywhere from $8,000,000 to" $10 -
000,000.
"The day of the fight was clear and
hot. Not a breath of air was stirring.
After the first battle the Americans
were greatly fagged by the heat and
the rest and breakfast allowed them
by the commodore was of inestimable
benefit. While the men were having
breakfast a conference of all the offi
cers was held on board the Olympia,
when the plans of tiie second battle
were made known by the commodore.
"Several shots struck the Olympia,
and she was pierced a number of
times. One shell struck the side of
the ehlp agaima the hospital ward.
The chaplain and nurses were watch
ing the fight through a port a few
inches away and were stunned by the
concussion.
"Gunner Evans of the Boston was
one of the men who sent the Spanish
ships down to Davy Jones' locker. He
directed the fire of one of the big guns
on the cruiser. As such officer he was
at all times greatly exposed, but did not
receive a shot. Not a man on the Bos
ton received a scratch.
"Mr. Evans states that throughout the
battle the fighting force of the Boston,
and, in fact, all of the ships, were as
cool as if on a May-day pleasure
cruise.
"In all the Olympia was hit thirteen
times. The Boston was struck by a
shot which set one of the officer's rooms
on fire. The Boston had a ricochet shell
fall on her deck but it was spent and
did no damage. The Petrel and Con
cord were not hit."
The following details of the battle
were given by one of the officers who
was in the engagement:
"Including four small gunboats there
were about fourteen Spanish vessels al
together drawn up in line backed and
flanked by the batteries of Cavite,
which are heavily mounted, the ord
nance including several 10-inch guns.
The Spaniards gave us a warm recep
tion, and we soon found out that the
Don Antonio d'Ulloa and the Reina
Cristina (the Hagship) carried much
heavier guns than we thought. They,
however, did but little execution, while
the broadsides poured in by our vessels
as they, headed by the Olympia,
steamed across the mouth of the har
bor, soon made n.n impression. We first
fired the port battery, and then came
round and fired the starboard battery,
repeating this operation four or five
times.
"The second time we came round the
Spanish admiral came out in the Reina
f.'risiina and gallantly assailed us. We
received him warmly, and I don't know
how in the world he e3caped with his
life. While the old admiral was stand
ing on the bridge a shot from one of
our vessels blew the bridge clean over,
but the admiral somehow escaped, for
we saw him afterward calmly pacing
the dock. Finding he could do no good
he turned to cet baclf into the harbor,
but before he could take shelter an
eiKht-inch shell from the Boston struck
his vessel on the stern and set her on
fire. Later on she sank with some 200
men. The admiral was among those
who escaped. The Cnstile was the next
to tnke fire and the Don Antonio d'Ulloa
followed.
"When the attack was resumed at 11
o'clock we Erected our attention to the
batteries, the Spnnish fleet having been
practically annihilated. The Baltimore
took the lead. She had orders to attack
the shore batt ri^s and she went and
did the cheekiest thing of the wholo
day. The batteries were mounted with
10-inch guns, a shot from one of which
would, if it had struck her, have blown
the Baltimore into atoms. The vessel,
however, to the admiration of the whole
fleet, went in full speed until she got
close undc- the batteries. Then sho
swims roun.l and let them have it with
a vengeance. T t was wonderful to see
her gallantly sail in the teeth of the
guns and siK .. cc them.
"Not only the fleet but all the de
fenses of any importance had by this
time been destroyed. I shall not soon
forget the sight which the harbor then
presented. The smoking hulks of the
Spanish vessels whith had not yet sunk
were seen to be strewn with corpses
and wounded men, and bodies floated
about In the water. I should think the
Spanish lost about 1000 men killed and
vounded while on our side not a man
.vas lost and only one seriously
mounded.
"The hauling down of the Spanish
,lag at about 12:15 was received with
;reat cheering by our fleet. In the
evening the Hugh McCulloch anchored,
right under the guns of the battery af
Cavlte.
â¢ "Ye?, it was rather a risky business;
but, you see, the commodore had inti
mated to the Spaniards that if they
tired a single shot he would lay the
whole city in ashes, a threat which had
the desired effect. The inhabitants
seemed to have got it into their heads
that when we got in we should kill
everybody, an( j i j n consequence, when a
boat's crew from the Petrel went
ashore to see if they would surrender
they were met by a large procession,
headed by a large cross and composed
of priests, sisters of mercy, etc., who
begged of them to leave the wounded
in the hospital alone. Of course, they
were soon reassured on that point. As
a matter of fact, we treated them in
the best possible manner, and offered
them every aid in my power. We got
every little tugboat we could find in the
bay and sent some 200 wounded to
Manila.
"This had a great effect upon the in
habitants. One of them seemed to be
so much impressed by it that he said:
When you go out take the narrow
channel, as the broad one is full of
mines, while that is free. I would not
tell you this ordinarily, but you have
behaved so well that I thought I would
warn you.' We subsequently found
that this solicitude for our safety was
not sincere, the narrow channel being
discovered, before any harm was done,
to be full of mines.
"Throughout the battle the Spaniards
showed that they were not deficient in
bravery. The only reason so little
harm was done to us was that they
fired wide. Had they been better
trained a much different tale would
have been told."
In speaking about the capture of Ma
nila the Hongkong Press says:
"Replies to Admiral Dewey's dis
patches having been received, the Hugh
McCulloch left the harbor shortly after
2 o'clock yesterday afternoon for Ma
nila, she being seen off by Consul-Gen
eral Wildman, Commodore Holland
and Harbor Master Rumsey. Had the
replies not been received within twen
ty-four hours of her arrival the dis
patch-boat would have had to await
them in other waters. The admiral
having destroyed the Spanish fleet ask
ed for further instructions as to his fu
ture actions, particularly as regards
Manila. The admiral did not wish to
take Over this great city on his own
responsibility, seeing that the rebels
have stopped the supplies. Cavlte is
in a similar position, provisions being
so scarce there that even those at the
hospital had been plundered, and in con
sequence when in possession of the city
the Americans themselves landed food
for the Spanish wounded. When the
admirol offered to pay for the coal
which he shipped at Cavite he was
thanked for doing so, but was informed
that provisions would be more accept
able than money, but of course he could
hardly see his way to acting upon this
suggestion. The instructions which
came to hand yesterday give him a
free hand to take what course he thinks
fit. He is thus placed in a very deli
cate position."
NEW PLAN OF
ORGANIZATION
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â Adjutant-
General Corbln announced to-night
that he would not make public the ap
portionment of the volunteer troops
among the States under the second call
of the President. The enlistment of the
75,000 men called for will proceed, as
heretofore announced, precisely as' en
listments are made for the regular
army. The Governors of States are
notified by the department how many
men are to be enlisted in their States
under the second call and how the en
listments will be made, but this infor
mation will not be given to the public
by the War Department.
It is expected that the enlistment of
troops wil proceed more smoothly than
it would if the quota of each State was
made public at this time. A majority
of the men enlisted will be sent at once
to the permanent camps to fill regi
ments that are incomplete, the men be
ing assigned, of course, to regiments
which belong to their localities.
Under the second call each State is
called upon to furnish a specified num
ber of men, not a specified number of
companies, battalion or degimental or
ganizations. After a State has filled
its quota the men unassigned to regi
ments already in the service will be
organized into new regiments, the Gov
ernors commissioning the officers who
are to command them.
OGDEN, June 7.â The Fifty-first regi
ment of lowa volunteers have been in
Ogden all day. The regiment is under
command of Colenel John C. Loper and
is 985 strong. Twelve companies are
without the full quota, but are loeing
rapidly recruited.
LOS ANGELES, June 7.â At the sug
gestion of Mr. Callaghan Byrne of San
Francisco, a plan is being formed to
hayÂ« an excursion to San Francisco
from Southern California on the day
the Seventh Regiment, which consists
of Southern California men, leaves for
the Philippines. Reduced rates on the
railroad will be asked for, and it is ex
pected fully 10C0 friends of the soldiers
would go.
NEW YORK, June 7. â The equip
ment of the Astor Mountain Battery
was made ready for transportation
west, en route to the Philippines, to
day. The War Department's order to
Lieutenant March to hold his command
in readiness was received to-day, and
the summons to get ready was issued
forthwith.
Lieutenant March said that unless
the unforeseen occurs the start will be
made to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
On the way he will stop at St. Louis,
where it is said mules for the battery
for conveying purposes have been pur
chaspd.
MOBILE, June 7.â The headquarters
of the Fourth army corps has been
cha.nged from this city to Tnmr>a.
General Coppinger is already there,

Six Northern Pacific Ves

WASHINGTON, June 7.â Assistant
Secretary of War Meiklejohn is rapidly
shaping the question of ships for trans
portation of troops to the Philippines.
It was definitely decided to-night that
the steamship Centennial will not be
one of the fleet, as she has been found
unseaworthy. Acting on the reports of
the vessel's condition, Mr. Meiklejohn
directed that she be thoroughly exam
ined, and to-night he received a tele
gram from General Merritt stating that
Lieutenant Lopez and Naval Con
structor Snow had examined the ves
sel and reported that she is not now in
a seaworthy condition and should not
be permitted to sail.
Acting upon this information, Mr.
Meiklejohn immediately telegraphed
Peter Larsen of Seattle, owner of the
vessel, that his charter for the Govern
ment had been canceled. It is prob
able that the War Department will im
press into Government service the
steamships Senator, City of Puebla and
Queen of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company. Assistant Secretary Meik'
lejohn to-day telegraphed General Mer
ritt to have these vessels inspected with
a view to their use as troop ships, and
if found suitable, to impress them into
service.
In addition to these vessels, the War
Department has in view several ships
of the Northern Pacific Steamship
Company. This is a British corpora
tion, and the vessels are the Arizona,
Victoria, Tacoma, Columbia and Olym
pia.
Mr. Meiklejohn this evening received
a telegram from the company, stating
that these vessels would be chartered
to the Government on condition of re
ceiving American registry at practical
ly the prices the War Department had
PI NEW YORK, June 7.â The Herald's

DETROIT DERBY WON
CLEVERLY BY ISABEY
Nabob Gains the Verdict Over Miss
Gussie in a Drive for Second
Place.
DETROIT, June 7.â Six thousand people
witnessed the Becond running of the De
troit Derby at the opening of the High
land Park meeting to-day. Stanton and
Tucker's Strathmore colt Isabey won the
derby and the $1300 first money in clever
style from Nabob arjd Mis.- Gussie. Alice
Farley and Laverock were the other
starters. They ran in close order all the
way. Miss Qussle showing the way by a
length for the first half-mile, the "others
well bunched. Laverock than led the
bunch until they straightened for the fin
ish.
At the quarter pole Isabey, who had
been close up and well in hand, came
away with a rush and went past the fin
ish a good length and a half to the good.
Nabob and Miss Gussie fought It out for
the place and the former drew away near
the end and got the verdict. Alice Farley
and Laverock were three lengths back.
Isabey was always the favorite in the
betting and Nabob was a strong second
choice.
Six furlongsâ Jenney won, Takanassee sec
ond. Belle of Corsica third. Time. 1:14.
Half mileâ Roy Mitchell won, Contravene sec

third. Time, 2:08^. Alice Farley and Laverock
also ran.
Mile and an eighthâ Brighton won, Our
day that vessels of the Northern Paciflo
line were now likely to be secured, as
the propositions made by the Govern
ment were likely to be accepted, pro
vided the boats were given American
registry, about which there would
probably be little trouble. These
steamers are the Columbia, Arizona,
Olympia, Tacoma, Argyll and Victoria,
The terms of the Government proposi
tion are 20 cents a ton between 2000 and
3000 tons and 15 cents a ton per day for
vessels of more than 3000 tons. Mr.
Micklejohn was pleased at the pros
pects of getting this fleet.
In adition to this the Asistant Sec
retary has, he told me, succeeded in
chartering for the expedition to the
Philippines these ships: From the
Empire Transportation Company, the
Indiana and Morgan City, and from the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company the
Senator, Queen and City of Puebla.
These boats will accommodate at least
10,000 troops, in addition to the 2600
which have already gone *n the first ex
pedition and those to be sent in the
Colon, China, Ohio.Zealandia and Cone
maugh, now provisioned and almost
ready to start.
In The Call of June 4 the condition of
affairs existing on the Centennial was
told at some length and fully illus
trated. The vessel was formerly used
for transporting coolie laborers between
Yokohama and Honolulu, and she was
accordingly fitted to carry the largest
number of men in the least possible
space.
Bunks were fitted into all kinds of
holes and corners where a man could
possibly be squeezed, without the
slightest attention being paid to ven
tilation or comfort. As was shown in
The Call tiers of bunks are arranged in
such a manner that twelve men might
be crowded into a space which would
be none too commodious for six.
Through the efforts of The Call this
important matter touching upon the
comfort of the men who are already
honored as heroes was brought to the
attention of the authorities and has al
ready borne fruit.

WEDS AN ANGELENO.
FARIBAULT. Minn., June 7.â One of the

ever witnessed occurred at high noon to
day in the cathedral, it being the marriage
of a granddaughter of Bishop W'hipple,
Miss Jane Whipple Scandrett, to Russell
Ross Burt of Los Angeles, son of Presi
dent Burt of the Union Pacific Railroad.
The ceremony was performed by the
bride's grandfather. A large number of
friends of the groom came on a special
train from Los Angeles. An elaborate
dinner was served at the Bishop's resi
dence. The church was handsomely dec
orated with flowers. Many prominent

ON BOARD tTCTTED STATES
STEAMSHIP CHARLESTON, HAR
BOR OF HONOLULU, May 29.âCap
tain Glass said he would make the run
from San Francisco In packet time, and
he has kept his word. Early last
Sunday morning the Charleston slipped
out through the Golden Gate, throw-
Ing back from her fore foot the yellow
foam of the rollers on the bow. She
took the seas as a man, long wander-
Ing, greets old friends to whom he re
turns â in joyous fashion, rollicking, roll-
Ing, tossing back their greeting in very
excess of gladness.
From the hills of the city crowds of
people waved farewell to the good
ship off to the war, carrying to the gal
lant Dewey the first greeting from a
grateful fatherland, and the boys In
blue gathered at the Presidio for the
long trip over seas gave the last voice
of the men we would hear no more un
til, perhaps, we heard the ring of an
American cheer echoing in the hills set
around about the harbor of Manila. On
the bridge of the cruiser, whence a
jacky wig-wagged vigorously to the
headquarters of the land forces, we
could hear, above the whistling of the
Email craft in the bay, above the
hoarse screams of the Charleston's
elren, the shrill cheering of the sol
dier boys as they came tumbling over
each other out of the tents, like a col
ony of ants disturbed, down to the
beach.
We dipped colors to a dusky collier,
creeping black beetle like into port,
w ifr-waertred farewpll to the Oregon sol
diers at Fort PoinJ, and faced the open
sea. Then a fog shut down and the
cruiser barely crept over the water.
The siren had its occupation here, un
til the light ship loomed up ahead, gave
hoarse greeting, and vanished.
Th-^ fog lifted a little, and the siren
on the Xorth Farallon sent a mourn
ful greeting across .the sea to the gray
cruiser, rushiriar through the water now
fuU steam ahead. The captain, on the
bridge, felicitated himself that the ves
ad at last begun to show her met
tle. It was a race Into the west against
time from that moment, with fair
â¢weather and smooth seas, save on the
Becoiid day out, when the Pacific sent
a few rollers and a dash of rain out of
the southeast Just by way of showing
that Its powers were intact.
The Charleston had some trouble with
her engines at the beginning, it will
be remembered, and was feeling her
way. She made 24S miles never
theless in the urst twenty-four
hours. She increased this to 273
on the second <lay and thence
forward her speed was progressive. On
"Wednesday the run was 257 miles. On
Thursday, under forced draught, it was
310 and on Friday the figure had
climbed to 3SO. Pile- war, in latitude 25
degrees 15 minutes north and longitude
347 degrees 27 minutes west at noon on
that day, and 570 miles from Diamond
Head <"aptain Glass and his corps
of engineers eased her up on Saturday
morning. The engines had bf-en tried
and not found wanting. The battle
with time had been won. She ran
smoothly through one more day and
night, making 320 miles to noon on Sat
urday and at daylight on Sunday the
lookout in the forward truck caught the
loom of the land on the port bow.
The high mountains of the island of
Moiokai came out more strongly as we
swung around to make the harbor of
Honolulu, and presently we had Molo
kal on thÂ» port bow and Oahu to star
board, and out of the dppp blue of tho
Era the white reef started up to meet
the ship.
On this trip Captain Glass and Ex
ecutive Officer Blocklinger had shaken
down and licked Into shape as green a
crew as ever went to sea in time of
â war. They were so irreen. most of the
Charleston's crew, they did not know
a marline spiko from a coil of rope. One
of them asked me. the second day out â
me. who by courtesy only knew a little
more than himself â to direct htm to
the captain's quarters, and there was a
decided commotion forward, and
among some landsmen who shall be
nameless also, when the news was
epread abroad that the ship's cook had
"phot Charley Noble" on the previous
night. Shooting Charley Noble, it
should be understood, is the technical
tTm for cleaning the accumulation of
soot from the galley smokestack, and
In the monotony of a long voyage rises
almost to the dignity of state function.
I do not believe there Is a better com
mander in the navy than Captain Glass
â and I know there is no man who
could have taken a green crew and in
seven days drilled them into men fit to
battle for the honor of Old Glory. It 1b
true he had the aid of a most conscien
tious and efficient corps of line officers,
thoughtful and considerate, every one
of them.

die without leadership at all. With in

I carry down the foe to common death.
; Certainly there was never a crew oS
i tamed the mental mastery of ship and
| guns more quickly. Save a few old
| hands, they knew nothing at the start,
j not even their places at the guns, and
more than half of them were seasick.
There was, nevertheless, in the face of
i each recruit that alert look character
izing the American individuality, and
It meant something. At the end of a
week of hard drilling, varied by lighter
tasks and byplay to keep Jack from
becoming a dull boy, each man knows
his place and springs to it quickly at
i bugle call.
One of the ship's cooks, "William
Lewis, smuggling liquor aboard at
Mare Island, made love too strongly
to his ido-1, and awoke to find himself
In the brig in double irons. He lost one
rating, being reduced to the rank of
landsman and a month's pay, a light
sentence, but it was delivered on the
quarterdeck in the presence of the
whole ship's company and formed a
most impressive ceremony â a warning
to the weak who would dally with
Jack Tar's most potent enemy.
The Charleston bejran taking coal to
day and will have her bunkers full by
Tuesday night. Then she will wait for
the Peking, to convoy the troopship
across the Pacific.
The reception given the Charleston
at Honolulu was of a kind to gladden
American hearts. No flag was visible
other than the stars and stripes. The
water front was lined with men. wom
en and children, for the whole town ap
parently turned out and a committee of
one hundred, with the Hawaiian band,
came down the bay on the steamer
Hall and escorted the cruiser to her
mooring ground, the band playing
American airs. The ship and her com
pany were given the freedom of the
city a little later. It was a foretaste
of the reception to be tendered the
I American troops when they pass
'â  through on their way to Manila. The
island people have raised a larpre fund
and will feed the boys in blue and hope
to be allowed to see them parade on
shore. SOL N. SHERIDAN.
TALK OF HOISTING
THE AMERICAN FLAG
Hawaiian Annexationists Scheme to
Force Their Way Into the
Union of States.
HONOLULU, May 31.â Sunday last
was a memorable day for Hawaii, and
one never to be forgotten by the par
ticipants In the interesting events. As
the church bells were ringing their calls
for morning service the five shrill blasts
of the whistles of the electric light
works aroused all from their prepar
ations and emptied the early-going
churches of their congregations. This
was the signal for the approach of the
United States steamship Charleston.
The people at once turned out en
masse and rushed pell-mell through
the streets, one blaze of American and
Hawaiian flags, to the water front, and
there they gathered along the wharves
and on every available slip and on
every spot of advantage by the thou
sands; all wearing the tricolor In one
device or the other.
The executive and reception commit
tees of the grand committee of welcome,
after a very brief delay, boarded the
gayly bedecked W. G. Hall, an Inter
Island Company's steamer, and with
the United States Consul-General and
the Government band on board pro- !
celled out to sea, and abreast of Waik- i
iki met the Charleston and escorted her
into port. What need to speak of the
thunderous welcome of cheers and those
in reply; or of the Intense enthusiasm j
that prevailed! The heart of welcome I
was there as true as It will be when
the victorious troops return home
through the Golden Gate laurel
crowned.
The first object that attracted the at
tention of those on board the Charles
ton was an Immense American flag '
which puzzled them greatly. They j
thought of annexation In some myster- i
lous way; of revolution or telegraphic
communication.
Honolulu is now hourly expecting the
City of Peking and her consorts and
is prepared to welcome them In any
manner the commander of the expedi
tion deems advisable.
The political sentiment is dead, for
for this epoch in our lives we are will
in? to risk the retributive conse

quences of violated international law
and to follow the lead of our Govern-
merit In openly offering our services to
the United States. Minister Cooper a
few days ago presented the oral state
ment of this being practically the Gov
ernment's intention to the Senate Just
as it had adjourned. It must be ad
mitted that conservative men object,
but then common sense is not always
with the majority.
The regular session of the Legisla
ture expired at noon to-day, but there
is so much important work unfinished
that President Dole has been compelled
to call an extra session at the instance
and request of the House, which
passed a resolution for that purpose,
with which the Senate declined to con
cur, still further adding to the politi
cal complications which exist. It is the
evident desire of the annexationists to
create such a situation that annexa
tion will be deemed to be an impera
tive necessity. In fact, some of them
actually threaten to hoist the Ameri
can flag to force results. These are,
however, Irresponsible hotheads, car
ried away by the hysteria of the mo
ment.
To-morrow an interesting event will
occur on the Charleston. Prince David
Kawananakoa and Jonah Kalaniana
ole, on behalf of Queen Dowager Kapi
olani, will present to the officers of the
ship an American flag manufactured
here by Hawaiian ladies of distinction
in appreciation of the kindness of its
former officers to King Kalakaua in
life and death. With the flag goes the
prayer for victory over her foes.
A link between the ancient and mod
ern history of Hawaii was severed last
week by the death of Kealiiopunui (the
chiefess with the big stomach). This
woman was born in 1791 on the day of
the great naval battle of Ke-pu-waha
ula (the battle of the red-mouthed
gun). In this sea fight fought at the
Pali-Hulaana, near Wairuanu. Hama
kua, Hawaii, a cannon was used by
Kamehameha I, who was victorious
over the combined forces of Kahekili
and his brother Kaco, King of Kauai.
She had twenty-seven children, most
of whom died young, but they left be
hind them twenty-three great-grand
children of their ancestors.
The cable bill passed second reading
in the House this morning and now as
amended has an equal chance of pass

ROTTANZI MAY HAVE
RANK OF MAJOR
MANILA, NOT SANTA CRUZ, TO
CLAIM THE DOCTOR.
Presented With a Brave Weap
That Will Work to the Glory of
Both in Either Field.
Surgeon Rottanzi, Company F, Califor
nia Volunteers, and the men of his com
mr.nd have not gone to Santa Cruz for
guard duty at the powder mills, in com
pliance with their orders of tho 3d inst.,
owing to the non-arrival cf the equlp
â¢nents.
In fact, in the case of Surgeon Rottanzi
the authorities that he in things military
have not fully decided as to whether or
not he can best subserve his country's
needs as the cynosure of feminine eyes at
Santa Cruz or an a practical demonstra
tor of his well known theories of sanita
tion In the American camp in the Philip
pines. Surgeon Rottanzl's Intimate knowl
edge of Latin tongues and Latin character
is also held in high regard by hlssuperiors,
and the prospects seem favorable to the
success of the large coterie of his friends,
who are seeking his elevation to the rank
of major and his assignment to a regi
ment bound for the front, where Dr. Rot
tanzi's unusual abilities will have a more
prolific field of opportunity.
Regarding his own elevation Dr. Rot
tanzi seems apathetic. He cays he has
neither requests nor suggestions to make,
but will rest content to do the first duty
of a soluierâ obey his orders. His many
stanch friends, however, are not content
and are earnestly working for a station
and an assignment more compatible with
the ability of their candidate.
But whether Surgeon Rottanzi fares
afar with major or casts his lines at the
seashore as captain, he will find solace
for all pangs in the swing and the glint of
his saber, that blade of good Damascus
presented to him yesterday by his col
leagues of the Board of Supervisors.
With its sheath wrought in gold and sil
ver it's as brave a blade as e'er mixed
the limbs of new-fledged shoulder
Btraps and will do as well in the nice
conquest of the bathing beach as of the
harsher field of grim battle. The surgeon
and his saber will prove Invincible in
whichever list they enter.

Grievances of Washing
ton Volunteers.
LOSE HOPE OF GOING TO WAR
UNLUCKY BATTALION KEPT AT
DRUDGERY.
Young Society Men Splitting Wood
at Vancouver Barracks for
Wives of Fourth Cavalry
Officers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, June 7.â The members of
the Third Battalion, First Regiment
"Washington Volunteers, are thorough
ly convinced that they did not enlist
for a summer picnic. They originally
supposed they would be given a chance
to fight the Spaniards in the Philip
pines.
Their troubles began early and have
materially increased until during the
last few days they have been required
to split wood at Vancouver Barracks
and carry it into the houses of the
wives of officers of the Fourth Cavalry,
which left the garrison Friday. This
deprived several dozen volunteers of
an opportunity to drill and has caused
them to give up all hoDe of going to
the front and doing something glorious
for their country.
Among the wood-splitters are mem
bers of Company C, Tacoma's crack
company, which contains many young
society men, including Howard Vander
bilt a cousin of Cornelius and Willie
K. Vanderbilt of New York.
This company was formerly com
manded by Lieutenant Colonel Fife,
now at San Francisco.
The troubles of the Washington regi
ment began just after it assembled
here, when the War Department ac
cused it In press dispatches of being
slow to get mustered in. The unjust
ness of this accusation was clearly
shown, the delay complained of being
due to the War Department's failure to
send medioal examiners here. Later
came reports from Washington that the
regiment didn't want to go to Manila
and would therefore be detailed for
garrison duty. Though the accusation
was again fnjpe garrison duty seems to
be in store for the regiment.
The Third Battalion has fared worse
than the rest of the regiment, because
it seems unlikely to get even to San
Francisco. It was also hustled off to
Vancouver by train without an oppor
tunity for parading through the town,
which the other battalions had. This
was especially regretted by Tacoma
citizens, who had prepared to give a
large farewell demonstration to the
battalion which included their home
company.
It is understood that Colonel Wholley
has requested that he be ordered to San
Francisco and that Lieutenant Colonel
Fife be sent to Vancouver to command
the Third Battalion.
Big Mill Burned at Eureka,

DEFICIENCY
BILL PISSED
House Approves the Sen
ate Measure.
IT CARRIES MANY MILLIONS
ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS
FOR WAR EXPENSES.
Voting Severally Upon the Senate
Amendments to the Sundry-
Civil Bill Is Com
menced.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 7.
After disposing of the war deficiency
bill, as passed with amendments by the
Senate, the House to-day considered
civil bill. The report, bo far as it em
civll bill. The report so far as it em
bodied agreements, was adopted and
the House then began voting severally
upon the Senate amendments upon
which no agreement had been reached
in conference. Of these there are forty
five. The House considered to-day
eight of these, acting favorably upon
three and rejecting the remainder. Con
sideration will continue to-morrow. The
House adjourned pending discussion of
a measure to enable volunteer soldiers
to vote at Congressional elections dur
ing the war. It involved constitutional
questions and by unanimous consent it
will be taken up to-morrow, following
the sundry civil conference report.
The urgent deficiency bill, made
necessary by the war with Spain, car
ries appropriations for the war and
navy establishments aggregating $17,
745,000. These appropriations are in ad
dition to the amounts to be carried
later by the general deficiency bill.
Session of the Senate.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â Almost im
mediately after the Senate convened to-
I day consideration was resumed of the
| bill for the protection of the people of
the Indian xerritory. After the read
ing and discussion of the measure,
! which occupied nearly three hours, it
! was passed. It provides for the allot
ment in severalty of certain lands to
the Indians of the Territory, the pay- ;
j ment of interest claims to the Chicka
| saw Indians and the ratification of the .
! agreement effected with the Indians by
the Dawes commission. The discussion
of the census bill precipitated a civil
i service debate, which had not been con
i eluded when the Senate adjourned.
THE CRUISER BUFFALO
ARRIVES FROM BRAZIL
To Be Overhauled at Once at Newport
News and Mounted With
Rapid-Fire Guns.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â The cruiser
Buffalo, lately the Nictheroy of the Bra
zilian navy, arrived In Hampton Roads
to-day directly from Brazil. The vessel,
It is learned, is not yet actually on the
United States naval lists. She has been
acquired subject to conditions that will
be doubtless strictly fulfilled by the Bra
zilian Government, but which have not
been met. They are that the ship must
be turned over in good condition as to hull
and machinery. The ordnance will be sup
plied by the United States Government in
the shape of ten-inch rapid-fire guns, now
ready to put in the Fhip.
The machinery of the Buffalo is known
to be in bad shape, but just to what ex
tent is not known here. The ship will be
inspected by a naval board when she is
ready for delivery to the Government.
Meanwhile the work of putting her in
condition will go on at once at Newport
News. The Buffalo was not obliged, lik* 2
the Oregon, to make a detour in reaching
a home port in order to avoid a possible
enemy, because, being manned by a Bra
zilian crew, and not yet the property of
the United States, she wan not subject to
attack. m

MfIYOR PHELAN'S DEMURRER.
\A A.YOR PHELAN has filed a demurrer. There
/ \ is about the document no trace of the legal
verbiage which ordinarily enwraps and par
tially disguises such ideas as a demurrer may
contain. In fact, it is direct, and so brief that no pos
sibility of misunderstanding it exists. Here it is:
San Francisco, June 6, 1898.
Editor Morning Call, Cityâ Dear Sir: The lan
guage attributed to me in your paper of June 5 is
without foundation and is untrue. Neither the words
quoted nor any such sentiments were ever spoken
by me. Yours truly, JAMES D. PHELAN.
This disclaimer had been provnked by the printing
of information which had reached this paper, and
which seemed to be authentic and interesting. It was
that the Mayor recently said: "I have done politics
south of Market street long enough, and now I am
going to do a little work on the other side, where
the atmosphere is purer."
Of course Mr. Phelan knows whether or not he
said this. If he did he would naturally regret it, and
if he did not he would want the impression corrected.
But the demurrer so promptly filed will naturally be
viewed in relation to circumstances to which no de
murrer has yet been entered.
It is a striking coincidence with the supposed ut
terance of the Mayor, that the committee of ioo
pledged to get the factions into one corral and there
brand them as brothers, and thq real Democratic ar
ticle, should have been so constituted as to be in ac
cord with the scheme of giving the south of Market
the royal snub. If the Mayor were to get this com
mittee amended so as to demonstrate that he loves
the south of Market with the same old love, the
change in its make-up would be considerable.
For instance, of that noble band seventy-two come
from the north side, leaving to the south side only
twenty-eight. If human experience teaches anything
it is that a majority of more than three to one has
its way so completely that the minority might as well
take a walk or a drink, whichever its perturbed spirits
conceived to be more soothing. Even if the Mayor
never said it, he might as well have said it. Denial
will be no sop to the wounded pride of the slighted
portion of the city. The factions may sfrout for unity,
but if the dove of peace values its feathers it will keep
away from there when the Mayor's trusted seventy
two and his tolerated twenty-eight get together for
business.
But the Mayor declares frankly that he never said
it. His letter is given publicity. An equal publicity,
will be granted to any reason he may have for acting
as though he had said that which a cruel report
credited him with having said.
IN MEMORIAM.
IT is not much the living can give the dead. The
fondest love, the deepest esteem, the mdst devoted
loyalty can bestow no more than tears, words of
honor and flowers, which are at once the tenderest
gifts of love and the fairest emblems of honor". Of
these poor gifts the giving should be full, generous
and spontaneous. They are of no avail to the dead,
but for the living to whom the dead was dear they
have a value far beyond anything which can be meas
ured by any scale known to the cold calculations of
reason.
An occasion will soon be upon this city calling forth
from its people the best manifestations they can give
ofÂ«their sorrow and honor of the heroic dead. The
steamer Coptic is bearing home from the Orient all
that is mortal of Captain Charles V. Gridley, the first
American officer of high rank who has fallen in the
war with Spain. He met his death heroically.
Though a sick man at the time, he stood at his post
of duty on the conning tower of the Olympia and
fought his ship through the long drawn out battle in
Manila Bay, which resulted in the glorious victory
that has filled the nation with exultation and pride.
When the arrival of the Coptic brings the body of
the hero to our city it should be received with every
demonstration of civic and military honor. Arrange
ments to that end should be made at once. The Gov
ernor, the Mayor, the heads of the great commercial
and industrial organizations of the people, should
take part in this memorial display. All who in any
way represent the people of San Francisco and Cali
fornia should make it a part of their duty to show to
the hero's body all the funeral honors which are due
to the illustrious dead. â¢
Let us prepare, then, for an "in memoriam" day.
Let us make it solemn, beautiful, reveYent and pa
triotic. Let us show to the world the honor and the
glory with which the American people regard those
who give their lives that the nation may live.
"Hobson's choice" has not yet been specified by
that gentleman, but whatever it may be the country
will favor letting him have it.
While Ccrvera is on the wrong side, there are un
mistakable evidences that he is a chjvajrous gentle
man.
THE VICTORY IN OREGON.
BY the Republican victory in Oregon another
landslide has buried deeper the corpse of free
silver, another triumph has been achieved for
the gold standard and sound money, and another evi
dence has been given that the popular sentiment
which bore McKinley to the Presidency in 1896 has
not any way diminished either in extent or intensity.
The victory is a notable one and was gained in a
straight fight for protection and sound mc^ey. The
people of Oregon had around them proofs of the
prosperity which comes from a protective tariff, and
they could easily recall what different conditions pre
vailed in the years when the Wilson-Gorman tariff
was on our statute books. They had convincing cvi-
dence that the maintenance of the gold standard did
not prevent a return of good prices, good wages and
abundant work for all, and with this evidence before
them they were not to be misled by the vain clamors
of calamity howlers demanding the overthrow of the
existing monetary standard and a venturesome exper
iment with free silver, greenbacks or fiat money of
any kind.
The extent of the victory is as notable as the cause
in which it was won. Rarely has any political success
more justly deserved to be called a sweeping triumph.
The Republicans carried almost everything in sight.
They elected the Governor, the two Congressmen and
a majority of the Legislature, thus assuring the return
of a Republican gold standard man to the United
States Senate. The last feature of the victory is of
special value, for it will materially aid in giving the
Republicans control of the Senate, thus putting an
end to the deadlock in that body and facilitating the
enactment of legislation necessary to the welfare of
the nation.
It is significant that the increased Republican vote
of Monday was found largely in the counties which
in 1896 had given majorities for Bryan. This shows
that the free silver craze is waning even in its former
strongholds. The voters who were deluded into sup
porting Bryanism during the hard times of the panic
years have recovered their reason with the return of
prosperity and are no longer to be counted among
the supporters of the wild fallacies of the Chicago
platform or of the erratic agitator who was the bene
ficiary of the craze.
The result of the contest gives promise of a com
plete Republican victory throughout the country this
fall. For years past our politics has been disturbed
by incessant changes of majorities from one side to
the other. A Republican victory in one campaign has
been followed by Democratic success in the next.
This has been going on for sixteen years, and as a
consequence the affairs of the nation have been more
or less disordered and its business interrupted by
changes in tariff or other acts affecting trade and in
dustry. We now seem to have reached the end of
these fluctuations,. The people have evidently made
up their minds to maintain the gold standard and pro
tection, and from this time forth political contests
will be waged on other issues.
TO BE BARRED FROM THE CREMATORY
THAT the New York Journal has been excluded
from many libraries is a fact which has been es
tablished about as long as the Hearst ownership
of that daily uncleanliness. There has been no par
ticular necessity for barring the Examiner, because
it has not progressed so far as the door of the li
brary. Yet the Examiner has its troubles. There is
a rumor that employes of the garbage crematory will
insist on having it shut from that institution, where
it is part of their onerous duty to feed it to the fur
nace. There can be no surprise at this. Even the
handlers of garbage must draw the line somewhere.
They are accustomed to dead animals, the offal of the
street, waste material from the stable, but there is a
limit to their endurance. If they carry out their reso
lution the Examiner's circulation will diminish so
that there will hardly be enough to swear to. It goes
by way of the crematory fires now, and when thick,
yellow smoke is observed pouring from the tall chim
ney it is known that, this circulation has had a boom.
THE PITH OF THE THING.
I^HE morning organ of the combination which
is endeavoring to get control of the Democratic
part of this city by unheard of methods persists
in the idea that our criticisms of the action of the
Democratic State Committee are born of a desire
to throw the organization into the hands of Boss
Rainey. This assumption is entirely gratuitous and
not based upon the facts of the situation. No justi
fication is found for it in the arguments we have put
forward opposing the course which is now being pur
sued by the so-called "leaders" of the Democratic
State Committee.
Why should a newspaper supposed to be devoted
to the cause of Republicanism desire that the Demo
cratic party be solidified under the leadership of a
politician like Sam Rainey? Mr. Rainey is the most
capable political boss in the Democratic party.
Bosses McNab, Alford and Gould are children com
pared with him. He is superior to Boss Buckley be
cause he is cooler and more scrupulous; he has been
the guide and tutor of nearly every district and pre
cinct potentate in the city from Lanigan down, and
many of the men who are now leading the Demo
cratic "reform" organization learned all they know
about manipulation from him.
The idea that we desire the Democratic party con
solidated under the leadership of Sam Rainey is
simply unthinkable. It is directly to the interest of
the Republican party that the Democracy should re
main in its present disheveled, broken and disorgan
ized condition. Rent with internecine feuds and split
into "county committees" and committees on organi
zation, it will be easier to beat it than if it should be
united under a capable leader.
The point we have made against the action of the
Democratic State Committee is one that intimately
concerns the entire people. If country politicians can
come to San Francisco and capture the patronage of
the city through the State organization of the Demo
cratic party, they can do the same thing through the
State organization of the Republican and Populist
parties.
Politicians in one respect resemble lawyers. They
follow precedents and travel in beaten tracks, and for
this reason it will never do to set a precedent of this
kind. We have protested against the autocratic acts
of the present bosses of the Democratic party, Mc-
Nab, Alford and Gould, because what they are doing
is unDemocratic, unAmerican and outrageous. In
any other place than boss-ridden San Francisco they
would be tarred, feathered and run out of town for
their audacious attempt to subvert the will of an en
tire political party in this manner. But if the rank
and file Democrats can stand it we can. Under such
leadership it will not be difficult in the coming cam
paign to effectually dispose of them. â 
Complaint is made at Madrid that Americans have
furnished arms to an almost savage race. Doubtless
the charge is well founded. However, it may be said
in mitigation that this was to enable them to fight a
race which often seems to be wholly savage.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 1898.
THE NAVY PERSONNEL BILL.
CONGRESS has taken a tnuch longer time in
dealing with the navy personnel bill than was
expected. The importance of the subject is
great and much consideration is due to it, but at the
same time it has been long under discussion, is well
understood by all interested in the matter, and there
is no reason apparent why the bill, which has been
carefully drawn and received the approval of high
authorities, should not have been promptly adopted
by both houses.
The object of the measure is to remedy defects
which have long been noted as evils in our naval
system. It provides that the line officers and the en
gineers of the navy be amalgamated; that when
the number of officers to be promoted is so far
in excess of the vacancies as to cause stagnation in
the service the requisite number of vacancies shall be
caused by weeding out the men who are least fit to
meet the heavy requirements of modern naval duty;
that the enlisted men aboard ship shall be given the
same reward of pension and retirement enjoyed by
enlisted men in the army; that uppermost machin
ists shall be made warrant officers, to rank with gun
ners and carpenters, and that there shall be a rear
rangement of salaries by which the payment of offi
cers in the navy is made equal to that of other officers
of the Government employed in equal duties.
Each of these provisions effects a much-needed re
form. The amalgamation of the engineers with the
line officers is essential to the best handling of mod
ern battle-ships. Under the present system we have
in our navy two sets of officers, one to manage the
machinery of the ship and the other to do the fight
ing. Under the proposed system, as is pointed out
by Walter McFarland, one of the officers who drew
up the bill, the American naval officer will be a fight
ing engineer, a man capable of managing his ship as
well as of fighting her, just as Decatur, Perry and
other sea captains of the days of old knew how to
sail their vessels as well as to lead their men into
action.
In the navy of the future, says Mr. McFarland,
every officer in command of a ship is to be "an en
gineer who is competent to care for and manipulate
any of the engines on board ship, and who has been
trained to command the men who actually handle
these various engines. He is to be a specialist who
has been given careful training for the particular
work he has to do, which is different from that com
ing on any other engineer; he is to be, in short, a
fighting engineer."
The provision for the rearrangement of salaries
proposes an act of justice which has been already too
long delayed. In his report on the bill Mr. Roosevelt,
who was then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, di
rected attention to the fact that at present "the line
of the navy is the most poorly paid branch of the
Government in proportion to the duties performed
and the responsibilities involved." The bill proposes
to equalize matters in this regard by giving the line
officers of the navy the pay now granted to officers of
corresponding grades in the army.
The remaining features of the measure are not
less commendable than those referred to. The bill is
not the work of any one man. Like every other
measure affecting a large number of men, it is a
compromise. Mr. McFarland attributes the solution
of the controversy between the line and the engineers
to Captain Robley D. Evans, while Mr. Roosevelt
states in his report: "The board, with the exception of
one member, reports unanimously in favor of every
section of the bill but one." Thus recommended
the bill should have prompt adoption at the hands
of Congress. At this crisis every step which tends
to improve the navy and to do justice to its officers
and men should be taken without delay.
THE WORK OF THE RED CROSS.
T"HE CALL does not suggest the beginning nor
promote the maintenance of any public move
ment or exertion of mercy requiring an appeal
to the gentler sentiments as an advertising scheme.
Therefore it was not for such purpose that we called
attention, first of all the press of this city, to the ne
cessity of organizing to carry on the needed work of
the Red Cross. The suggestion was at once taken up
and funds needed were not slack in coming. The
result has been the extension, to soldiers from dis
tant States and our own, of most acceptable hos
pitality and comfort on their arrival, and the planting
in the hearts of thousands of these men of most grate
ful memories of California and her patriotic men and
women. Thousands of letters written home by these
American soldiers have carried back to the sad firesides
they left to serve their country the story of the wel
come which hailed them here, of the flowers and food
and the kind words of greeting. No nobler work for
men was ever done, and none of higher credit and
usefulness to the State than this.
The Red Cross Society has been given headquarter
rooms in The Call building, and its activities are com
manded and directed from the spot where its organi
zation was first recommended.
The motive of the suggestion was nothing more
than the proper forelook of a newspaper to the need
for relief of the sadness and sorrow, the suffering and
misery which are the plaintive incidents of war, and
not to turn to advertising uses the quality of mercy
which inheres in all hearts and needs only to be
shown the way to effectiveness and use.
The Call has sought to treat the war, its news, its
purpose and its necessary incidents in a spirit of'
fairness to its readers, believing that they deserve
its respect and should not be made the victims of in
decent brag and bluster or be deceived by untruthful
pretense.
We have not claimed authorship of strategy and
plans of campaign by land or sea, nor assumed credit
for the victories won and sacrifices made by brave
American soldiers and seamen.
We have been content with the proper function of a
newspaper in gathering and publishing the day's news
and carrying to their anxious and appreciative coun
trymen the story of brave deeds well done.
Among those to whom history will ascribe the
credit of disinterested motives and work as needed
and as necessary as clearness in command and cour
age in battle are the workers of the Red Cross.
Every one who aids them, whether by the full purse
of the millionaire or the widow's mite or the school
child's nickel, has done God's service in quenching
that battle agony which follows an action at arms
or the wasting miseries of the camp hospital. All
such contributors are partakers in the glories and
gains of war and earners of the blessings of peace,
which are the final object of all civilized warfare.
If the blackmailing scheme accredited to Editor
Rush of San Rafael be confirmed the man is a dis
grace to journalism, and would be a disgrace to any
jail. Yet there is no such occasion for protecting a
jail as for protecting journalism.
France is going to useless trouble in drawing up
articles of agreement for this country and Spain. She
has the European instinct for getting a finger in every
pie, regardless of the ownership of the pastry, so that
there be a plum in it.

RINGING A
JOKE
ON HIMSELF.
cupatton on Sunday afternoon, and a trip
'to the Richmond camp was suggested. A
McAllister-street car was boarded and as
it was just the time of day when seats
are at a premium both Bell and Hick
man were forced to stand. At first things
moved smoothly enough, but the riding
soon told on the physical condition of
Hickman and support was needed. Hick
rnan reached for the most convenient
brace in the car and grabbed it. It was the
bell rope that registers the fares, but in
blissful unconsciousness he gave no heed
to the ringing that followed his muscular
rest. Every time he changed his position
the bell would ring. While one bell was
registering fares the other Bell recognized
that trouble was brewing for his friend as
soon as the conductor should awase from
his lethargy. Slowly the numbers In the
registering dial went round and round, for
Hickman kept a-rlnglng. Just before the
terminus of the road was reached the con
ductor made a comparison between the
register and the money in cash. His
breath came and went in quick pants. He
was just 80 cents "shy" and, scratch his
head as he would, no cause for the short
age was apparent. Suddenly he heard the
fare bell ring and he made an investiga
tion. The evidence which he discovered
was conclusive and he at once charged
Hickman with the crime. A demand for
the money was made and this nearly pre
cipitated a row. Five minutes' cajoling on
the part of Bell and the issuance of many
rich oaths and threats from the tongue of
the Incensed conductor were effective In
persuading Hickman to come to a settle
ment. He settled for the full shortage,
but he avows revenge on Bell for allowing
him to ring up a Joke on himself to the
size of seventeen car fares, and he also is
patiently awaiting an opportunity to re
turn the compliments the conductor in his
wrath heaped upon him.
SONG OF KING COAL.
I am the king of strife and calmâ
Now a whistle and now a moan â
I have seized the scepter and torn the palm
Prom the Wind on his bauble throne.
My pipe In his face I boldly puff
Till his rage ray soul Inspires,
And I draw him down and his cries I drown
In the glee of a billion fires!
Oh. I am king of the land and lea.
King of the field and foam,
King of the mountain, vale and lea.
King of the hearth and home!
Heir of the lordly limbs and leavesâ
Now a whistle and now a moan â
And my sires, up-garnered In mammoth
sheaves.
Oh the floors of the world were strown.
Yet, up through the starless roofs I come.
And the sentry breezes quail;
And the furnace glow Is the flag I throw
In the teeth of the howling gale!
Oh, I am king of the land and sea.
King of the field and foam.
King of the mountain, vale and lea.
King of the hearth and home!
Tears for the straining sail and sheet-
Now a whistle and now a moan â

PANNING THEIR POSSESSIONS
In recent year 3 Spain has tried all over
Europe to borrow money, and its efforts
have come to practically nothing. As
Queen Isabella pawned the crown jewels
to buy Columbus an outfit to discover a
new world, so the present Queen Regent
has offered about everything the Govern
ment owns as pledge for money to retain
the small possessions that still remain
to Spain out of Columbus' discovery.
Numerous proposals to borrow on rail
way securities and the Almaden mines
have failed and various other securities
offered have been rejected. In 1891 a $50,
000,000 national loan was issued. This was
followed by a series of hand-to-mouth
treasury bill issues, which are now caus
ing runs on the banks at Madrid, Bar
celona and in other Spanish cities. In
1593 the Bank of Spain disposed of $12,500,
000 of treasury bills. From 1594 to 1596
various propositions for loans fell
through, and in 1897 the Rothschilds re
fused a loan of $20,000,000, and they are
said to have refused twice that amount
within the past two months. In 1896 au
thority was given for an $50.000,000 inter
nal loan, and in 1897 the Philippine Islands
were mortgaged for $40,000,000.
SCHOOL IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.
During the short winter days it would
often be noon before all the children put
in an appearance; it would either be dark
or brilliant moonlight. Smoke might be
seen lazily rising from four or five cabins
out of four or live hundred. I would light
one lamp and wait. By 10 o'clock a few
children would straggle sleepily in. just
as the day began to dawn. By 11 o clock
shortly after sunrise, the majority of the
children were at school, some coming
without their breakfasts. By half-past
12 all who were coming that day would
have appeared. It waa> hard to get up
before daylight on those cold, dark morn
ings. I often used to wish that I was one
of the little girls, so that I, too, might
sleep until daylight. No one in camp pre
tended to get up early, unless there was
some special work on hand, which must
be done.. As I was going home to my
lunch at noon friends would sometimes
call out to me: "Good morning! Come in
and have some breakfast. We have fine
moose steak and hot cakes." On Satur
days and Sundays I lived and slept as did
other people. Even when one did not sit
up later at night than 10 or half-past it
required an effort to rise before daylight.
There is something in the air and In the
manner of life which makes one sleepy.
As the days lengthened the children came
earlier to school.â The Century.
THE COMMERCE OF AUSTRALIA.
According to the statement of the Gov
ernment statist, which we published re
cently, the commerce of the seven Aus
tralasian colonies for 1897 reached the
enormous total of Â£137.510,000, the imports
amounting to Â£65,600,000, and the exports
to Â£72,210,0i30. These tlgures represent ilje
trade intercourse between some four mil
lions of people, and between those people
and the outside worid. If the Austral
asian colonies were federated, and the
custom house statistics embraced only
oversea commerce with other portions of
the British empire and with foreign coun
tries, the amounts we have stated would
be largely reduced. And to arrive at a
true conception of the extent of Austral
asian commerce this reduction ought to be
made. For the metallic productions of
Broken Hill, Queensland and Rlverina
wool. Western Australian and Queensland
gold, not to speak of other articles, should
not be entered three times, when they
pass through other colonies, but only
once. The duplication of entries i 3 rela
tively greatest of all in the case of South
Australia, the next largest transhipping
colonies being Victoria and New South
Wales. The returns of New Zealand and
Tasmania, which are insular, and in
less degree those of Queensland and West
ern Australia, which are comparatively
Isolated colonies, are more reliable as
guides to the true or what is called in
France and Germany the "special" com
merce of the country. Yet, supposing the
returns to be reduced by the amount of
the intercolonial and transhipment move
ments, the commerce of Australasia
would still be a splendid one, entitled to
the admiration of the world. A purely
oversea trade of between Â£80,000,000 and
Â£90,000,000 per annum is a concrete fact
of unquestionable magnitude and import
ance. â Melbourne Argus.

AMERICAN NAVAL HEROES.
But what American boy or girl does not
remember the Alert, which, after an eight
minutes' fight with the Essex, took her
without losing a man; the Constitution,
which, after a half-hour's fight, forced
the Guerrlere to surrender, and the Unit
ed States, which took the Macedonian,
and the Constitution, which destroyed the
Java? The English papers are now claim
ing Dewey as a successor to Drake, bai
we do not forget his more immediate kin
folk, Rodgers, Hull, Decatur, Bainbridge;
Perry on Lake Erie; Downie and Stewart!
Nor do we forget that our victories in 1812
are attributed to the better building of
our boats, the superior skill of our gun
ners, the stricter discipline of our crews.
What did we gain from this war? A bet
ter position as a nation, a stronger reli
ance on a responsive, practical unity, and
the proof that "Old Glory" never suffered
at sea.â Philadelphia Public Ledger.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
IN JULY, 1845'â J. F., Oakland, Cal. The
Fourth of July, 1845, fell on a Friday.
OUT OF THE STATESâ W. C. S., City.
There is nothing in the Constitution of
the United States which says that the
President of the United States shall not
go outside of the limits of the United
States during his term of office. There
is nothing in the United States statutes
at large on that subject.
MARKET STREETâ A. 8., City. The
line of Market street in San Francisco
is from northeast by southwest, generally
speaking. All that portion of the city
between the line of the Potrero and Mar
ket street has by common usage been
called "south of Market street," as that
is easier expressed than to adhere to the
strict lines as shown by the compass.
SINGLE TAXâ Multi-taxpayer, City.
The proposition of the single-tax payers
is to tax the ground in a sum sufficient
to pay the running expenses of the Gov
ernment, and if there is need for public
improvement the tax is to be raised in
order to meet the extra expense, with the
understanding: that the taxation shail not
be oppressive. That is the explanation
given by prominent single-tax advocates.
A COINâ A Subscriber, City. It is im
possible to answer so indefinite a ques
tion as "What is the value of a coin in
perfect condition of Charles 11, date j
1776?" Subscriber and all correspondents ;
who want information about coins should i
give quality of the metal of which the I
coin is made, a full record of the inscrip- |
tiun thereon, size of the coin as compared I
with American coins, dates and a rubbed
impression of the coin, both sides.
MINERAL WOOLâ J. D., Vallejo, Cal.
Mineral cotton is a fiber formed by al
lowing a jet of steam to escape through a
stream of liquid slag, by which the slag
is blown into fine white threads. It is
a poor conductor of heat, and is, there
fore, suggested as a covering for steam
boilers and pipes. A variety, with short
fiber, is called mineral wool, and is used
as a non-conductor of heat, a deafener
of floors in buildings, and so forth.
THE INSANE-A. O. S., City. If an in- i
dividual in the State of California has J
been committed to an asylum for the in- !
sane and it appears that the malady is not I
of a dagerous type, the relatives or '
friends can apply to the authorities of the I
asylum for permission to take charge of j
such individual and give proper treat
ment and care. The authorities will then '
decide if it would be for the best to allow ;
the patient to be discharged conditionally :
FROM FERRY TO DEPOTâ D. J. M.,
Sebastopol, Cal. A stranger at the Tibu

Jose depot of the Southern Pacific "with
out inquiring his way at every other
crossing," should walk up Market street
until he reaches the Claus Spreckels
building at Third, turn down Third and
walk to the end of It. There he will find
the depot on the right hand side of the
street.
OFFICER'S PAY-X. X. X., City. The
pay of volunteers in the volunteer sen-ice
of the United States is the same as that
of officers of the regular army for like
service. The amount that is paid to each
officer, commissioned or non-commis
sioned and that paid to enusted men
can be found in the back part of the
army register to be found in the Fr** 'â 
Public Library. This department has not j
the space to devote to the publication of !
the pay roll of the many grades.

RED CROSS ASSOCIATIONâ Miss p
S., East Oakland, Cal. The care of the
â wounded in battle dates back as far as
history itself. In. thÂ© time of Adri
an there were tents set apart for the
care of the wounded. In the ninth
century special corps for the care of the
wounded in battle were organized by Em
peror Leo VI. The Red Cross Associa
tion the original of the Red Cross Soci
eties of the present day, had its origin in
a proposal made in February, 18b3, b> one
Dunant at a meeting of the Societe
Genovise. to which he described the hor
rors of the Italian battlefields and asked
if it would not*be possible in time of
peace to form societies for the relief or
the wounded, when war should break out
again. This led to a general congress at
Geneva in August. 18G4, at which sixteen
European powers were represented, and
a treaty was arranged, which was signed
by all. The terms of the treaty are that
ambulances and military hospitals be ac
knowledged as neutral, with all persons
employed in them, as aiso that all inhab
itants"of the country who may bring help
to the wounded be respected and protect
ed by belligerents, and that wounded or
sick 'soldiers be taken care of, whatever
nation they belong to. May 21. 1881, Miss
Clara Barton organized the Red Cross
Society in Washington, and on March 16
following the United States gave its ad
hesion to the international work of hu
manity. The uniform and distinctive flag
bear a red cross on a white ground and
a brassard or arm badge is provided for
all individuals neutralized for field and
hospital service. Turkey diplays the cres
cent instead of the cross. The American
Red Cross Society provides for the miti
gation of suffering by wax, pestilence,
famine and other calamities. The organ
ization of a Red Cross Society in this
State was brought about through the
San Francisco Call, and what it is doing
is recorded daily.
TYPEWRITERâ S. A. M., City. The
earliest record that has been discovered
of a typewriter is a patent issued in 1714
to Henry Mill, an engineer in London. In
1784 a French patent was issued for a
writer that produced raised or embossed
letters for the use of the blind. In lS4.i a
resident of Worcester. Mass., obtained a
patent, and two years later a second one.
but neither of his machines was of prac
tical value. In 1556 a patent was issued
to A. E. Beach of New York for a ma
chine that embraced the basket-like dis
position of type bars now in use on stan
dard machines. T. W. Charles Latham
Sholes of Milwaukee. AVis., in 186S ob
tained a patent for a practical machine
upon which a number of improvements
have been made.
GAS BALLOONâ Reader, City. In the
memory of the oldest living resident of
the city of Sacramento, and according 1 to
the files of the local journals, the first
gas balloon ascension in that city was
by James H. Whitesides and F. F. Mar
tin, at Agricultural Park, on April <.6.
1874. The gas was furnished by the Citi
zens' Gas Company, a corporation then
in existence. Ii tapped its main and car
ried a pipe over Twentieth street to fur
nish the gas to fill the silken sphere. An
attempt was made a few days prior to
that date, but the balloon did not at that
time rise. The gas balloon ascension by
which a boy was carried up in the air
and remained there a long time was not
from Sacramento, but from San Francis
co. It was in the latter part of the
fifties that a balloon ascension was an
nounced, and after the balloon had been
inllated with gas, a newsboy named
Yablonsky, who was playing around, got
caupat in the netting when suddenly the
balloon broke from its moorings, and ris
ing rapidly carried the boy with it. He
clung to the netting for many hours, and
was carried in a northeasterly direction.
Finding that the balloon would not down,
he made a slit in it to allow
the gas to escape, and he reached the
ground near Sacramento in safety.
IRELAND'S FLAG-D. C, City. A.
| Mac George in his work on "Flags, Some
i Account of Their History and Uses," says:
"What has come to be called the 'flag of
Ireland' is a red saltlre (or St. Andrew's
cross) on a white field. But Ireland,
strictly speaking, never had, until lately,
a national flag. The Kings of Ireland
previous to 1172 were not hereditary, but
elective, and each King brought with him
and continued to use nis own standard.
After the invasion of 1172 the standard of
Ireland bore three golden crowns on a
blue field, and the three crowns appeared
jon ancient Irish coins. Henry VIII re
linquished this device for the harp, from
an apprehension, it is said, that the three
crowns might be taken for the triple
crown of the Pope, but the harp did not
appear in the royal standard till it was
placed there by James I." According to
tradition one of the early Kings of Ire
land was named David, and this King
took for arms the harp of Ireland's sweet
psalmist. It is thought that the harp
has its rise from the triangle designed in
the reign of John to distinguish the Irish
coins from the English. The reason why
a triangle was chosen may have been in
allusion to St. Patrick's explanation of
: the Trinity, or possibly to signify that he
j was King of three countries. Henry VIII
I was the first to assume the harp positive
i as the Irish device. The' green flag is said
to be emblematic of the green isle, the
harp being the device of the isle. If any
reader of this department can furnish an
account of the origin of the green flag
this department will be pleased to pub
i lish the same.

TQ THE GOVERNMENT.
Supervisors' Committee to Confer
With the Chamber of Com
merce on Inspection of
Vessels.
The Supervisors met yesterday, the
3elay of a day being dua to the fact
:hat the intervention of Decoration
lay, a holiday, made it necessary to
ivait one more day for the advertise
ments which must be printed for five
lays excepting holidays.
The only subject brought up that
iroused more than a passing interest
ivas that of the lease of the Sailors'
tfome, -which is now in the hands of the
Ladies' Seamen's Friend Society. The
presence of the matter before the board
ivas on a motion to transfer the home
:o the care of the Women's Seamen's
Benevolent and Protective Society, the
adies of which had accused the man
agement of sectarianism.
It was the sense of a majority of the
board that whatever sectarianism had
been detected in the present manage
ment of the home had disappeared and
that the management now is perfectly
satisfactory. A substitute to the mo
tion to remove the present manage
ment providing for the lease of the
iiome to the present management for
hree years was passed to print. This
3ractieally ends the controversy.
Supervisor Clinton submitted a reso
ution authorizing the Mayor to ap
point a committee of three to confer
,vith the officers of the Chamber of
'nmmerce, and with them to memorial
ze Congress on the subject of the great
oss of life and ships which the Klon
like excitement had brought about.
["he resolution stated that thirteen
hips and 124 passengers sailing from
his port and that of Seattle had been
ost. and the object of the committee
vas to prevent further disasters by
laving a thorough inspection of all
>utgoing sailing vessels. The Govern
nent inspects only steam vessels now,
md leaves sailing vessels out of the
[uestlon altogether.
The resolution was adopted, and Su
>ervisors Clinton, Lackmann and Mor
on were appointed on the committee.
')n motion of Clinton the Mayor was
idded to the number.
The clerk of the board was directed
0 advertise for bids for the keeping in
repair all streets now paved with
bituminous rock or those that may be
so paved after July 1.
Permission to hold monthly boxing
entertainments was granted to the
Merchants' Athletic Club. A similar
iermit was granted the California Ath
etic and Swimming Club.
By resolution submitted by Devany,
:he Putro Railroad Company was re
luired to report the amount due the
â¢ity for the 2 per cent of the gross
;a.rnings. as required by the franchise.
The Potrero sower plans for District
N"o. 1, as modified by the Surveyor,
,vere approved and adopted.
After the meeting was over the Su
pervisors adjourned to the committee
â¢oom and there in a neat speech Super

Rottanzi a handsome presentation
â iâ a gold-mounted staff officer's

HOFF WILL NOT
HANG NEXT FRIDAY
NOTICE OF APPEAL HAS BEEN
FILED IN HIS CASE.
It Will Act as a Stay of Proceedings,
It Is Said, for a Month
at Least.
Albert Frederick George Verenesenec
kockockhoff, better known as Albert Hoff ,
who murdered Mrs. Mary Clute In cold
hlood some time ago, will not hang for his
crime within the walla of San Quentln
next Friday. For a time it was thought
that the murderer would go to his doom
for the heinous crime he committed with
out delay, but his attorneys yesterday
took advantage of the law and he has
been granted a temporary respite. Short
ly after Judge Cook convened court yes
terday morning Attorney Schooler, chief
counsel for the condemned man, appeared
and filed a notice of appeal from the Judg
ment of conviction.
The appeal to the Supreme Court will
act as a stay of execution and prevent the
hanging which was to have taken place
Friday. The grounds on which the appeal
will be made are not as yet known, but in
any event it is the opinion of Assistant
District Attorney Hosmer that all that
ca"n be gained by the move is delay. Ow
ing to trie fact that the time for the tak
ing of an appeal on account of errors
committed during the trial has expired,
nothing will go to the Supreme Court but
the Information, the plea, minutes of the
court, charge of the court and the Judg
mrnt. This will rendor the labor or the
higher tribunal less difficult In reaching
a decision, and it is thought that Hoff
will be taken to the gallows next month.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 1898.
WAS AT THE
BOMBARDMENT
San Juan Engagement
fc*y a Participant.
A YOUNGSTER'S DESCRIPTION
ONE SHELL WHICH CAME NEAR
THE FLAGSHIP.
Frank A. Kinne, a San Franciscan,
Gives a Graphic Account of the
Second Important Naval
Battle.
Frank A. Kinne, a San Francisco
youngster, graduate of the High School
here, and the son of Colonel C. Mason
Kinne, is acting second lieutenant of ma
rines aboard Admiral Sampson's flagship
New York. His description of the bom
bardment of San Juan, Porto Rico, writ
ten to his father, ia a vivid account of
the engagement of the Spanish batteries.
The Call is permitted to make these ex
tracts from the letter:
U. S. S. New York. Key West, Fla., May 19,
We arrived here last evening from San Juan
de Porto Rico, having been gone since May 4.
When we came over from Cuba hurriedly on
May 1 and began coaling ship, taking on
stores and ammunition for a long crui=e, most
of us thought that when we left we would
have some fighting to do and It proved true,
WAS ON THE FLAGSHIP
Acting LIEUTENANT PRANK 6- KINNE of the Marines, flag
ship New York, U. S. N.
although we did not meet the Spanish fleet,
we leit here at daylight on the morning of
May 4 and proceeded to the Cuban coast and
picked up the battleships lowa and Indiana,
monitors Terror and Amphitrite, cruisers
Montgomery and Detroit, tug Wampatuck.
collier Niagara and torpedo boat Porter. With
this rather formidable fleet we steamed east
ward, and our conjectures proved true that
we were to proceed to Porto Kico and tackle
the Spanish fleet if we could find them there.
We steamed slowly, as the speed of a squad
ron is the speed of the slowest ship, and the
monitorÃ are not very fast. However, we ar
rived about thirty miles north of San Juan
at midnight, May 8, and the admiral issued
final instructions, although several plans of
battle had been agreed upon before. Either to
find the Spanish fleet outside the harbor, or to
find them inside or not finding them at all. to
attack the fortifications. This last Mas what
we did as the enemy had withdrawn from that
locality the day previous, we Steamed very
slowly toward the harbor, feeling our way
and keeping a very sharp lookout for the
enemy.
At 3 a. m. all hands were called and at 3:30
a. m. a light breakfast was partaken of. At
daylight we arrived in the offing of the harbor,
but not a sign of the fleet. Signals were run
up from the flagship and we formed "line of
column" on the Iowa: next came the Indiana,
then the New York, Terror and Amphitrite. in
order named. The Montgomery. Detroit and
Wampatuck were sent out as flank scouts and
to mark the ten fathom line with stake boats
for turning point. The little Porter was sent
in to reconnolter and the Niagara with the
Wampatuck were to recede out of range offlre.
The attacking line steamed in a triangle, thus
formed by the stake boats, and each In turn
as It came in range poured forth a steady
stream of shells that created chaos in the
forts and town proper.
At 6:15 a. m. the signal gun for battle was
fired from the lowa, to be Instantly followed
by her great guns and 4-inch battery. The
Indiana opened fire with her 13-inch guns, fol
lowed by her 8-Inch and 10-inch. Then the
New York and the monitors. The cruisers ot>
either flank had come to a standstill and were
pouring broadside after broadside into the forts
and town. When our shells struck the forti
fications It seemed an if a volcano had Just
broke forth, with the rocks, dirt, dust, smoke,
etc. going up into mid air. The guns on the
Morro and water batteries were silenced In
stantly and the Morro completely demolished
One of the 13-Inch shells from the Indiana
cut a steeple of a church In two as it one
were cutting butter with a knife. This was
only our first round at them. They returned
our fire, of course, but did not get our range,
and most of the shots whizzed over us but
dropped rather close for all that, and 'were
not at all inviting. We could watch them in
the air Just before they struck and they looked
like little bees buzzing alonÃ, but I am very
much inclined to believe that their "sting"
would be of a far different nature than that of
the busy bee.
The second round was even more fierce than
the first, as the enemy had seemed to have
gotten our range better and their shells came
too confoundedly close for comfort at all but
still none of our ships were hit until we were
nearly out of range, when two of their shots
told on us.
We were drawing away from them, having
silenced and demolished all but three gnny
when a' shell struck a stanchion on our port
quarter. It exploded, the pieces flying in hll
conceivable directions, through smokestacks,
ventilators and decks and wrecking one of our
cutters, which we were compelled to throw
overboard. It killed one of the gun's crew In
stantly, striking him in the back of the head,
and wou,ndlng three others. We carried the
poor fellows below and made them us com
fortable as circumstances allowed. The lema.
was also struck once, wounding two men, and
these were all the casualties that occurred in
our fleet of seven vessels and nearly 2000 men
engaged. On the enemy's side the slaughter
must have been terrific, us all our shots told
and thirteen-inch shells exploding in their
midst are not anything to play with.
In watching the flight of one of their shells,
which was tumbling and raising quite a whir,
it reminded me of a duck being shot on the
wing and tumbling to the water below, so
realistic was the sight. For my part, I don't
like those kind of "ducks" around us.
Another amusing Incident of the day, If such
things In such times could be called amusing,
was the daring of that little spitfire of a tor
pedo boat Porter. While reennnoitering close In
shore she drew the fire of some riflemen upon
her. "What did she do but turn her stern to
the enemy and commenced firing her little one
pounder Into their mfdst; of course amid the
roar of the great guns her fire could not be
heard, but the continual and steady puffs of
smoke from her looked very saucy. It was
comical, indeed.
Having withdrawn to a safe distance, we
counted noses, as it were, and compared notes,
and found that we were all all right save the
few sad casualties mentioned above. At 5 p. m.
we stopped and half-masted our colors, for we
on the New York had that saddest of sad rites
to perform to one of our comrades who was
with us but a few hours before, and now cold
in death and to be buried at sea. The word
was passed, "All hands bury the dead," and
if anything makes me feel creepy and goose
fleshy it is that. We all laid aft and the chap.
laln performed the ritual service. The marine
guard presented arms and he that was was de
llvpred to the depths of the sea, "Taps"'
flights out) was sounded and then three stirring
volleys given to the brave fellow who died for
his country at his post of duty. We then pro
ceeded on for this place for coal and stores
and further orders.
Take It all through, the men were cool and
collected and showed the American spirit. Such
was our second fight. FRANK A- KINNE.

fer a reward of $20 for beat design of an
electric light pole to be erected along
Market street and Van Ness avenue.
The committee upon sprinkling the
streets with salt water reported progress.
Assayer Thomas Price has been employed
to make a report to the board upon the
effect of salt water upon bituminous
pavements. As soon as this report is re
ceived further action will be taken.
Regarding the abolition of poolrooms
within the city limits, the following com
munication was received from Chief of
Police Lees:
"In reference to your letters relative to
poolrooms where pools are sold on horse
races in this city, I Inclose reports from
Captains Wittman and SpiUane of May
20 and Juno 4, 1898. Their reports of June
4 show that no poolrooms selling pools
on horse racing exist in this city, but are
now situated at Oceanside, San Mateo
County, and Sausalito, Marln County,
where they have licenses and are Belling
pools on Eastern races."
As the efforts of the board had been
exerted toward this end, the report of the
Chief of Police was considered aa a very
favorable showing of its work. The Mer
chants' Association of New York reported
that the efforts made to prevent any re
duction in the free delivery system of the
malls had met with success. Answers
were received showing that our delegation
In Congress had favorably acted upon the
telegraphic request forwarded by the

THEY ARE NO
MORE FRIENDS
John F. English at War
With Mrs. McCord.
HAD TROUBLE OVER WINDOWS.
A HIGH BOARD FENCE NOW DI
VIDES THEIR PROPERTY.
Both Parties Believing That They
Are Right, Befuse to Yield
an Inch in the
Matter.
A thirty-foot hieh fence now divides
the friendly feeling that once existed
between John F. English, a commis
sion merchant, and the widow of John
i McCord of the well known hay and
grain firm of Scott & McCord. The
present unpleasantness is due to a dis
: pute over property rights. The result
I of the row Is that several carpenters
, have been given employment, and the
i property owned by the disputants has
' been made unsightly by the high board
1 fence being erected under the direc
| tion of English.
Some three years ago English pur
chased a piece of property on Fell
street, between Central and Masonic
avenues, and erected a three-story
dwelling on it. At that time the prop
erty on the north side was not built
upon, and English took advantage of
that fact to get all the sunshine possi
ble in the house. The north side of the
house was studded with windows look
ing out upon the vacant lot, and every
thing was satisfactory until a few
weeks ago, when Mrs. McCord bought
the adjoining property. Acting under
the advice of her friends she decided
to erect three flats on the land. She
intends occupying the lower flat and
renting the two upper flats to increase
her Income and lighten her burden in
looking after her family.
It was undoubtedly due to an over
sight on the part of the architect that
all of the windows on the side of the
flat next to the house owned by Eng
lish are on a level and directly opposite
the windows of the English dwelling and
a three-foot passageway running along
the north side of the English property
is all that divides the houses. It would
not require an acrobat to pass from one
house to the other by means of the win
dows.
English was displeased when Mrs.
McCord began to build. Her house cut
off the morning sun from his house and
darkened the rooms. He could not
make any objection to the improving of
the property, however, but he did ob
ject when he found that nearly all the
windows on the south side of Mrs. Mc
â  Cord's building were placed directly
I opposite the window's on the north side
i of his house.
English and J. V. Hull, a carpenter
and builder, had a consultation with
the representatives of Mrs. McCord.
While they objected to the location of
the windows they said that they would
not' make complaint if stained glass,
stationary windows were put In the
McCord building. The McCord people
agreed to the stained glass windows,
but would not consent to stationary
windows. They represented that the
only way of ventilating the rooms on
that side of the house would be by
movable windows.
Then English directed Builder Hull
to erect a 30-foot fence to cut off the
view into his premises..
The light has been cut off on the
south side of the McCord building, and
while the fence remains there much
difficulty will be found in securing
tenants.
There is a possibility that the Mc-
Cord people will finally consent to the
stationary stained glass windows, and
then the high fence will come down.
ARRIVAL OF THE BELGIC.
The Crew and Steerage Passengers
Were Put in Quarantine.
The steamer Belgic arrived on time
from the Orient yesterday. A case of sus
pected smallpox was discovered in the
Chinese steerage during the voyage, and
the Mongol was put ashore at Honolulu.
Dr. RÂ«senau, federal quarantine officer,
ordered all the steerage passengers
ashore at the quarantine station and al
lowed the steamer to dock. After the
crew had been mixing with the people
from the shore for about half an hour
and the cabin boys had been on the dock
with some of the cabin passengers' bag
gnge, word came to send them all to the
island. In consequence every Chinese and
Japanese aboard was bundled into a tug
and sent into quarantine, where they will
be kept a fortnight. When the Belgtc left
Hongkong, for the week ending May 10
there had been 24G cases of bubonic plague
reported in that city and 220 deaths. Con
trary to all precedent the plague was rag
ing among the white residents.
The Belgic brought over twelve Euro
peans, thirty-five Japanese, two Mexicans
and 220 Chinese in the steerage, and the
following cabin passengers:

The steamer Samoa did not get ar.v
for St. Michael with the barge Mona^n
and stern wheel- steamer Clara in tow yes
terday. The steamer had more passen
gers aboard than the law allowed, so
twenty of them were put aboard the
Clara as "a crew." This was objected to
by the inspectors of hulls and boilers, and
until some alterations have been made in
the plans the vessel will be detained in
port. The Clara is being carried on the
barge Monarch, so that the latter will be
a rather unwieldy tow.
The schooner Carrier Dove lost her
yawl last Sunday, and her captain is anx

of William Clarkson for embezzling gold

THE CHARTS WERE
VERY INCORRECT.
CAUSE OF THE WBECK OF THE
CORONA ASCERTAINED.
Seven Fathoms of Water in the Place
Where She Struck on the Beef
and Sank.
Captain O. F. Bolles and J. K. Bulgrer,
local Inspectors of steam vessels, have
completed their reports as to the loss of
the steamship Corona and the accident
on the Pomona.
In the first-mentioned case the board
found as follows: The Corona, Captain
George H. Pierce master, left Seattle Jan
uary 2, with freight and passengers for
Sitka and way ports. At 7:12 a. m. on
January 23 she struck on a reef near the
southeast end of Lewis Island, Arthur
Passage, British Columbia. She filled
with water In a short time and sank.
At the time of the accident the weather
was dark and cloudy. Acting Pilot H. C.
Kaufman steered the vessel in the same
way as is customary in that locality. At
the place where the ship struck there is
marked on the chart seven fathoms of
water and no indications of rocks. Cap
tain Pierce had made but one voyage pre
viously as master in these waters. The
board found that the actual damage to
the Corona, which was afterward raised,
was 130,000. The report concludes as fol
lows:
"After careful consideration of the case
we are of the opinion that Captain Pierce
was not to blame In connection with the
accident."
In the matter of an accident on board
the Pomona, being the blowing out of a
blind tube, near San Diego, causing the
death of Coal Passer Robert McNelu, the
board said;
"In our opinion the'explosion would not
have occurred had the eight tubes in the
starboard boiler not been removed and
the holes in the tube sheets closed with
blind tubes about twelve inches long, and
which had not been expended inside suf
ficiently to bear the frictlonal pressure on
the blind tube that blew out."
LIQUOR MEN ARE
UP IN ARMS
OBJECT TO SECTIONS OP THE
EVANS BILL.
A Strong Protest Sent to Washington
Against Crippling the Small
Dealers.
The announcement yesterday that the
measure popularly known as the Evans
bill had passed the House In "Washing
ton raised Into a breeze among local li
quor men. The bill provides that all
packages of one gallon and upward must
be stamped by the Revenue Department,
whereas up to now packages of less than
five gallons have been exempt.
The following protest, signed by forty
four prominent liquor firms, wu last
night sent to Washington:
We, the undersigned merchants of San Fran
cisco, object strongly to sections 4, 5 6, 7 and 8
of the Evans bill reducing the bonded period
and requiring Internal revenue inspection to
be made and stamps issued on packages less
than five gallons and not less than one gallon.
Our objections to these sections are that they
will not increase the internal revenue receipts
one dollar and that they afford no additional
protection against fraud. It will greatly de
crease the income of the department by adding
to the expenses as a larger force of Inspectors
must be employed to make the Inspection and
collect stamps.
To us the bill Is objectionable as It hampers
us In our business, delays us In the delivery
of "our goods sold. Increases our expenses, en
larges the details of our revenue work, sub
jects us to further espionage by revenue offi
cers without reason and without any corre
sponding benefit to the department.
We ask you to place this matter before Sena
tor White and the Pacific Coast delegation and
ask for us that they unite in determined op
position to the said sections. The rest of the
bill Is unobjectionable.
The advocates of the bill. Ignoring the
extra trouble entailed on dealers and rev
enue officials, claim that the sections will
minimize adulteration and "moonshin
lng."

Mrs. W. E. Paxton, Youngtown,
North Dakota, writes about her strug-
gle to regain health after the birth of
her little girl:
" Dear Mrs. Petkham:â is with
pleasure that I add my testimony to
your list, hoping that it may induce
others to avail themselves of your val-
uable medicine.
"After the birth â of my little girl,
three years ago, my health was very
poor. I . had leucorrhoea badly, and a
terrible bearing-down; pain which
gradually grew worse, until I could do
no work. Also had headache nearly
all the time, and dizzy feelings. Men-
struations were very profuse, appear-
ing every two weeks. ; f r
" I took medicine from a good doctor,
but it seemed to do no good. I was
becoming alarmed over my condition,
when I read your advertisement in a
paper. I sent jat once for a bottle of
Lydia . E. v Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
ponnd, and after taking two-thirds of
the bottle I felt so much better that I
send for two more. After using three
bottles I felt as strong and well as any
one. â : } :â  . ." vÂ£
" I think it is the best medicine for
female weakness ever advertised, and
recommend it to every lady I meet suf-
fering from this trouble." f
Maternity is a wonderful experience
and many women approach it wholly
unprepared. Childbirth s under right
conditions need" not terrify women.
, The advice of Mrs. Pinkham is freely
offered to ; all expectant mothers, and
her advice is beyond question the most
valuable to be obtained. . : If Mrs. Pax-
ton had written to Mrs. Pinkham be-
fore confinement she would have been
saved much suffering. Mrs. Pinkham's
address is Lynn, Mass. â

THE MONTEREY OFF FOR. MANILA
Sailir>g of tf)e Mon
itor ar>d the Col
lier Brutus.
Early Next Week; the Fleet
of Troopships Will Sail.
Paymaster in Camp.
Next Monday is the date now fixed
upon by the local war lords for the
embarkation of the second expedition
to the Philippines, and Tuesday as
the day of departure. These dates
may be shortened by twenty-four or
possibly forty-eight hours before the
end of the week, but the prevailing
opinion around the various general
headquarters is that the troops and
transports will not be ready for the
long voyage before that time.
As for the strength of the expedi
tion, nothing has developed to change
the plans already announced in The
Call. The steamers China, Zealandia
and Colon will comprise the fleet,
while one battalion each from the
Eighteenth and Twenty-third United
States Infantry, the First Colorado,
Tenth Pennsylvania, two batteries
of light artillery from Utah and a
detachment of the Signal Corps will
be the occupants of the transports.
Second Lieutenant Hooper of the
First Colorado was sent aboard the

Detachments will be sent to the other
ships as soon as they begin to receive
their stores.
Brigadier General Frank Greene, who
is to command the next brigade to sail
for Manila, will probably appoint Lieu
tenant Bates as his adjutant. Both of
these officers come from the Seventy
first New York. General Greene is
dally consulting with General Merritt
in regard to the details of this expe
dition.
The three trains conveying the Fifty
first lowa Volunteers to San Francisco
passed Offden yesterday and are ex
pected to reach Oakland some time to
night. The troops will not cross the
bay until to-morrow.
The trains having on board 843 re
cruits from Fort MePherson, Georgia,
for the Eighteenth and Twenty-third
Infantry regiments will arrive here on
Friday.
AT CAMP MERRITT.
Portion of the Volunteers Given
Two Months' Pay â Seventh's
New Quartermaster.
Two mule teama drove out to Camp
J^errltt yesterday with sufficient coin to
pay the officers and men of the Colorado,
Pennsylvania and Utah troops up to
June 30, In acordance with Instructions
from Washington to give all troops two
months' pay prior to embarking for Ma
nila. Paymasters Whipple and Kllbourne
accompanied the treasure, which was
guarded by a detachment of cavalry. The
great pile of gold and silver was a source
of considerable Interest to the Pennsyl
vanlans, the majority of whom had never
before seen so much "hard money" at
one time. The others, of course, coming
frem the West, were entirely familiar
with the "good red gold."
All the regiments have transmitted
their muster rolls to the pay Inspector,
and more coin will be disbursed during
the week.
Captain A. W. Klmball, promoted from
first lieutenant and quartermaster of the I
Seventh California, to captain and as- I
sistant quartermaster, has been relieved
from duty with that regiment and or
dered to report to General Merriam, com
manding the Department of California,
for duty. D. C. Williams, who for the
past four years has been connected with
the quartermaster's depot in this city,
under Major Long, has been appointed to
succeed Captain Kimball on Colonel
Berry's start. .Lieutenant Williams is a
native of Kentucky and a graduate of
the Military Academy of Ohio. His
brother, Colonel Charles W. Williams,
was formerly in charge of the supply de
pot here, but is now stationed at Jeffer
sonville.
Colonel Berry of the Seventh California
will detail three qtiicers to go to the
southern part of the State for recruits
as soon as orders come from Washington
to fill the regiment to the maximum of
106 to the company. It is Colonel Berry's
intention to rill each company with re
cruits from its home station, and he says
there will be no difficulty whatever In se
curing all the men he needs in two days'
time. The recruiting officers expect to
start on their mission the latter part of
the week.
The Twentieth Kansas Regiment and
one battalion from Idaho were Inspected
in heavy marching order by Colonel
Hughes of General Merritt's staff yester
day morning. In the afternoon the Sec
ond Idaho Battalion and the Wyoming
troops were inspected. The men marched
to the southern slope of the Presidio
reservation, where they pitched their
shelter tents and broke carifp under the
Inspector's supervision. The Seventh
California. First Montana and the two
Dakota regiments will be Inspected dur
ing the week.
A detachment of the Signal Corps has
gone into camp on the field with the
Fourteenth Infantry.
A brigade court-martial sat in the head
quarters of the Third Brigade yesterday
and tried several prisoners for minor of
fenses.
Majors Btrother, Sturgls and Hale re
ported to Major-General Otis yesterday
for duty. They are attached to his staff.
Captain William A. Tucker, commis
sary of subsistence of volunteers, has '
been ordered to report to General Otis
at Camp Merritt for duty as chief com
missary on the staff of General Ander
son, who sailed with the First Brigade
for Manila. Captain Tucker will sail with
the next brigade. -
Brigadier-General Green has established
his headquarters adjoining Major-General
Otis' headquarters. General. M. P. Miller
is located on the same lot with the en
gineer company.
CHRISTIAN COMMISSION.
Special Meeting To-Day of
Evangelical Clergymen
for Army Work.
Deep interest is manifested on the part
of the city clergy in regard to the United
Sfnfs Army Christian Commission of the
Young Men's Christian Association, which
has been organized in nearly all the
States and larger cities of the Union.
The work is to be conducted similar to
that done during the civil war, and as the
work of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation is exclusively a work for men by
men it hns been unanimously decided in
all the Eastern States that this is the
proper agency through which this line of
work should he undertaken; consequently
the War Department has given It its most
unqualified Indorsement. When the first
volunteers were called W. B. Millar, one
of the International Young Men's Chris
tum Association secretaries, was detailed
for this special work, and proceeded at
once to Washington. D. (\. where he
rÂ»-:i <iiiy received all necessary approval of
the work. General John MeCook of New
York la chairman of the national move
ment and D. L, Moody, General O O
Howard, Major Whittle and other promi
nent evangelists have charge of the evan
gelistic department.
The city clergymen, in consultation
Monday, decided this was the legitimate
course to pursue, and have called a meet-
Ing of the special committee to take place
at the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion building to-day at 2 o'clock^ when it
In fxpr-cted Mr. McCoy will outline the
course of procedure, and the United
States Army Christian Commission of the
Young Men's Christian Association will
probably be organized for the State of
California next Monday. It is confidently
hoped that D. L. Moody will be In San
Francisco in a few weeks to take up spe
cial evangelistic work at Camp Merritt
under direction of the San Francisco
Young Men's Christian Association.
THE ARTILLERY CAMP.
Five Batteries in the Field.
Fourth U. S. Cavalry
Awaiting Orders
The artillery ramp on the Presidio plain
engages the attention of spectators and
elicits comments of commendation from
officers of the army. Yesterday Captain
Birkhimer's Battery L, Third Artillery,
came over from Lime Point on the steam
er McDowell and joined Major Hess' camp
of artillerymen. The camp at present
contains three batteries of the Third
United States Artillery and two batteries
of California Volunteer Heavy Artillery.
Captain Hobbs' battery of the Third Ar
tillery, now at Alcatraz, may join the
camp to-day.
Recruiting for the artillery Is progress
ing In a manner highly gratifying to Ma
jor Hess. The maximum strength of a
battery of heavy artillery is two hundred
men. Should the present activity In re
cruiting be maintained for two weeks the
full force of twelve hundred for the six
batteries of the camp will be secured.
.Lime Point, which Major General Nel-
Bon A. Miles is pleased to term the Gib
raltar of the Pacific, is now garrisoned
by Battery B of California Volunteer Ar
tillery. The station is one of the most
Important on the Pacific Coast. When
but few troops were stationed here mili
tary men expressed the hope that The
Call would not direct attention to the fact
that but a small garrison was on duty at
i.ime Point. It was said that the Span
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JinSTE 8, 1398.
lards might land a small force on the
Marin coast, seize the battery of high
power guns and practically demolish the
forts on this side of the channel. The
Lime Point battery is one of the highest
in the world. A trained force occupying
the works could destroy the batteries on
this side of the Golden Gate.
The news published in The Call a few
days ago that the Fourth United States
Cavalry had been assigned to the First
Brigade of the expeditionary forces des
tined for the Philippines gave rise to a
wild story that the regiment had received
orders to embark for Manila. The troop
ers have received no orders other than
those published in The Call, and they do
not expect to be included among the
forces to sail next week, although orders
to go at once would be welcome news.
The following order was issued yester
day:
PRESIDIO OF SAN FRANCISCO,
June 7, 1898.
Each troop commander will submit without
delay the name of sergeant fitted by lengrth of
service and soldierly qualities to be a member
of the Gnnrd of the Standard. By order of
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL MORRIS.
GEORGE H. CAMERON, First Lieutenant
Adjutant.
Seven troops of the regiment are now
at the Presidio, and another troop will be
along In a day or two. The seven organi
zations now here have been recruited to
the maximum of 100 for each troop.
Among the recruits from the East were
many fine youngsters, who came with let
ters commending them to the officers of
the Fourth. The standard Is high in this
organization of regular cavalry. College
graduates, robust young fellows of means
and others who prefer the life of a troop
er in time of action to a leisurely exist
ence in a comfortable Eastern home may
be found in the regiment.
VOLUNTEER SIGNAL CORPS
Expert Telegraphers Wanted,
to Whom L-iberal Pay
Will ]Be Given.
There is a demand for expert telegraph
operators in the United States Volunteer
Signal Corps, the recruiting office for
which is on the fourth floor of the Phelan
building. The term of enlistment Is for
the war. Any operator desiring to enlist
must present a certificate from a man
ager of the Western Union, the Postal or
some other well-recognized telegraph or
ganization, that he is a competent tele
grapher, of high moral character, correct
habits and of such standing that the man-
agcr or superintendent signing the certi
ficate would be willing to employ him as
an operator in his own oflice. There
seems to be a lack here of such men de
sirous of enlisting in the Signal Corps,
and hence recruits will be sent for from
the Eust.
The quota of electricians and other men
is now full, and all applicants for enlist
ment for this branch of the service are
being declined.
Under the law the Signal Corps Is au
thorized to consist of one colonel, one
lieutenant-colonel, one major as disburs
ing orncer, and such other officers and
men as may be required, not exceeding
one major for each army corps, and two
tains, two first lieutenants, two see
on", lieutenants. live tlrst-claes ser
vants, ten sergeants, eleven corporals
and thirty first-class privates to each or
ganized division of troops, provided that
two-thirds of all officers below the rank
of major and a like proj^rtion of the en
listed men shall be skilled electricians or
telegraph operators. Something over 100
men according to this arrangement, are
to be enlisted in the Signal Corps, now
being organized for the Philippines. The
"'"of Signal Corps men is higher than
that Â°n other branches of the military ser
vice, except in the Engineer Corps, where
it is the same, it being as follows: First
class sergeants. $:,4 per month; sergeants.
$4080- corporals, $24; privates, $20 41).

Supplied With Arms.
Guns and ammunition were supplied to
the two battalions of Washington Volun
teers at Fontana Barracks yesterday. The
guns are Springfield rifles of the latest
pattern. The non-commissioned officers
have been furnished with revolvers, and
each company has two shotguns, which
are to bo used for the killing of game.
This nearly completes the equipment of
the Washlrigtonians, who are now anxious
to try their guns on the Spaniards as tar
gets.
Yesterday a party of ladles presented
to the Washington Volunteers a flag of
the regulation size, and it was at once un
furled to the breeze from the flagstaff of
the Fontana Barracks.

LOVE'S LABOR.
A Father Crosses the Continent
to Say Good- By to His
Son.
There was a scene of parental and filial
affection at the Occidental Hotel last
night when the overland influx arrived.
W. H. Saam of Irwin, Pa., one of the ar
rivals, jumped down from the bus and
dashed into the lobby, where he was
greeted by a young soldier of the Penn
sylvania Regiment. The young man was
no other than his son Kennett, and the
purpose of his father's visit was a com
plete surprise to him.
The elder Saam says his trip to Califor
nia is a complete surprise to himself. He
was returning home to his lunrh ,mo day
last week when a friend informed him
that the ship on which his .sou uuuid muj
would leave this city in six days. He did
not hesitate a moment, but, ordering his
baggage to be packed at once, he started
for California a few hours later. Mis only
object was to grasp his son's hand once
more before he leaves for th<? Philippines
and to wish him godspeed and a bon voy
age.
Father and son walked up and down the
corridor of the hotel with arms locked
and it was a late hour when they sepa
rated for the night with a host of plans
formed for the morrow.
Reception to the Swedes.
The Swedish soldiers from the camps of
volunteers were given a reception in the
Swedish Congregational Church last even-
Ing. It was not only a reception, but also
a banquet in a small way, ami all that
was not consumed by the visitors was
packed up and will be takon to the
camps this morning. Re\ . C;. rl Anderson
of the Swedish church of Oakland and
Rev. Albin Anderson, pastor of the local
church, were the speakers of the evening.
In the Swedish language they exhorted
their hearers to be true to their traditions
of their race and to the flag in whose ser
vice they were enlisted, and they called
up the familiar names In Swedish and
Scandinavian history and cited them as
examples to be remembered and fol
lowed.
There was singing by tho Sunday-school
children and by the oholr. and then every
one was invited Into the basement of the
church, where tho ladies had spread a
supper Mt to attr.-.ct any number of hun
gry volunteers and to provide for them
all. There were Dearly a hundred soldiers
and as many more visitors at the church
and the affair was voted a grand success'

A YELLOW WAIL.
One Poor Special Commis
sioner of the Examiner Be
moans The Call's
Enterprise.
Through the medium of a carrier pigeon this wall has reached the
joss house across the streetâ also the public. It Is a message from a
special commissioner of yellow Journalism chiding his superiors for
their rank stupidity and Informing them that, as usual, in a matter
that would naturally present itself to any mind of ordinary intelligence,
they wore found wanting.
Undeterred by the Jarring he had received at the hands of ex-
Presldent Cleveland but a short time before, Chief Faker Hearst, upon
learning of the great victory at Manila through the Herald-Call dis
patches, set about to use the hero of the battle as an advertisement for
his illegitimate schemes. Dewey was on the other side of the globe,
and if he did object to being made a mark for lurid journals the ob
ject would be accomplished before his protest could reach this country.
So a tawdry admiral's ensign was secured and given in charge of a
"special commissioner" to present to Dewey. The commissioner and his
prize package sailed on the Charleston, which left for the Philippines
on May 22. On June 6 a carrier pigeon was shot near Salinas, and it
was found to bear the following message from the "commissioner":
ON BOARD U. S. CHARLESTON. Noon, Sunday, May 22.â Examiner,
San Francisco: We are now well on our way steaming at about twelve
knots. The weather Is beautiful and there Is a steady swell on. Many of
the Jackles are more or less affected, but If It gets no worse to-morrow
will see them all with good sea legs on. The Farallones are just to the
northeast. Here is a message from Captain Glass to bulletin and publish if
you see fit:
ON BOARD U. S. CHARLESTON. AT SEA. Noon, May 22. -Editor
Examiner: Please ask Navy Pay Office to report us Lat. 37-23 N. Long.
723-07 W. Weather fine. Light breeze from S. W. Sea moderate. Made

PrivateâNo papers were sent to me this morning and The Call loaded the
ship with a large supply to be taken to the fleet and to Honolulu. For
C 's sake get me a supply of all papers off on the Peking. Will fly the

don't think they will get there. DOUGLAS WHITE.
There was not enough legitimate enterprise among the entire lot of
Hearstllngs to send a bundle of papers out to the first ship that would
reach the fleet at Manila.
But the thought suggests itself that possibly the omission was Inten
tional. Naturally, the commissioner could not be expected to capture
the admiral the moment the Charleston dropped anchor off Cavite, and
the hero of Manila Bay might obtain a copy of the saffron sheet con
taining an intimation of what was in store for him, in which event he
would probably exchange the commissioner with the Spaniards for a
yellow dog and order the offering of a feather-brained editor thrown
overboard. If this surmise be correct, there Is no chance for Admiral
Dewey ,to escape the infliction.
But the world knows now that no Examiners went out on the
Charleston, and there Is the commissioner's admission that there were
plenty of Calls on board.
Dockery and Inspector Davis were de
tailed for the duty, and they found that
the meat furnished yesterday morning
was considerably flyblown, but otherwise
in fair condition. The cooks had cut
away a great deal of the meat where the
flies had injured it, and the inspectors
advised them to save all such waste and
return it to the butcher, requiring in ex
change the same weight of good meat.
There will be nothing further done In the
matter, as it is believed the recent hot
weather had a great deal to do with the
spoiling of what was spoiled, but there
will be other inspections made, and if fur
ther samples of the same kind are found
the Health Department will act.
On the request of General Merritt the
camp will also be inspected as to its sani
tary condition, and any recommendation
made by the inspectors will be carried

War Incidents.
Nellie Holbrook Blinn, who is foremost
among the leaders in every patriotic

Laurel Lodge No. 4, Knights of Pythias,
on last Monday tendered an entertainment
and reception to soldier knights who are

Company F, Sixth Regiment of the Na

he was not of legal age, being only 20
years old. His parents live in the Bast

sent he had Frank Shay appointed as hiÂ«
legal guardian, and this guardian gave
his written consent to the boy's enlist

others similarly situated.

FOR THE INVALIDED.
WARD IN THE FIELD HOSPITAL.
The field hospital at Camp Merritt Is now thoroughly established,
and yesterday forty-three soldier patients were being cared for. Major
W. O. Owen, U. S. A., Is the surgeon in charge, with Major E. R. Mor
ris and First Lieutenant Henry Page as his assistants. Major Morris
has charge of the non-infectious cases, while Lieutenant Page is in con
trol of the infectious cases. Major Owen is the executive head.
Of the forty-three patients now in the hospital, thirty-one are
suffering from measles, and all but one are doing nicely. Half a dozen
of the cases under Major Morris' care were turned over to him by the
French Hospital yesterday, all of whom were convalescing from serious
ear complaint.
At one time measles threatened to become epidemic, but this dan
ger has been overcome, and the cases in the hospital are kept com
pletely isolated, nobody but the surgeons and attendants being al
lowed to approach within thirty yards of the ward.
One hundred or more enlisted men will be transferred from the Pre
sidio to the hospital, and those who are not needed to attend the in
valids will be thoroughly drilled for the more serious work in store for
them in the Philippines.
The hospital is completely equipped with instruments, and medi
cines, and everything is as neat and tidy as can be. The surgeons report
the troops at Camp Merritt in an exceedingly healthy state, consider
ing the changeable climate, which is most trying on the men from the
interior States.

GUIDI'S INSENSATE FURY
MADDENED WITH LIQUOR, HE
RUNS AMUCK.
Possibly Fatal Termination of a Long
Domestic Quarrel â The Assail
ant Arrested and Lodged
in the Tanks.
Family trouble of long standing culmi
nated last night in Santtno Guidi stabbing
his wife and her brother, Londo Pelle
grini, and wounding them so severely that
the recovery of both Is doubtful. Guidl
was arrested and taken to the Central
Police Stntion and placed in the "tanks."
No charge will be preferred against him
until the result of the Injuries ca"n be
definitely ascertained. Pellegrini was
taken immediately to the Receiving Hos
pital, but Mrs. Guidi insisted upon being
removed to the home of her sister, where
she was attended by the family physician,
after which she was Transferred to the
hospital.
Mrs. Erida Guldi and her husband were
separated about three months ago on
account of his alleged cruelty, and since
then she has been living with MrS. Qui
cili, a married sister, whose home is at 636
Broadway. Londo Pellegrini visited his
sister at this place last evening and about
11:30 o'clock asked Erida and Lillie, a
younger sister, to get him some tamales.
They went to a coffee-house on Stockton
street, and after making their purchases
started for home, but when they reached
Broadway they saw Guidi and, fearing
him on account of threats he had made
before, turned back and went around the
block to avoid him. When they again
reached Broadway Lillie saw Guidi near
some steps in front of a stable at 630 and
warned her sister that they had better go
into a store and wait, but Erida thought
it better to make a run for the house
As they passed the steps Guidi made a
dash for his erstwhile wife, and Lillie saw
lhat he had a knife. Guidl, who was con
siderably the worse for liquor, succeeded
in catching the object of his fury and
plunged the knife into her body five
times. He then grabbed Lillie, but she
succeeded in tearing herself loose from
his grasp and ran to her home and in
formed her brother of the stabbing
Pellegrini immediately hastened to
avenge his sister and encountered the
now thoroughly maddened Guidi at the
foot of the steps of his married sister's
house The two men grappled and strug
g ed for some little time, out Guidi fin
ally got the better of his brother-in-law
and succeeded in stabbing him three
times. Officer Connor and O. H. Berge
the special policeman on Broadway were
attracted to the scene by the desperate
fight and captured Guidi before he had a
chance to escape.
The knife with which Guidi did the
stabbing is a dagger which has been made
by grinding down a common table knife
and has a blade about four inches long as
sharp as a razor. Mrs. Guidl has five
woundÃ, and the nature of them renders
her recovery very doubtful. One of the
stabs is In the left breast near the heart,
and there are two more in the left side
below the breast. The other wounds are
in the right side.
At the Receiving Hospital, where Pelle
grini's injuries were dressed, Dr. Fltzgib
bon found . that the weapon had pene
trated the lung, liver and abdominal cav
ity and his recovery is very doubtful.
Guldi, when arrested, was brought to the
hospital, where Pellegrini identified him
as his assailant. On his bed In the hos
pital, while racked with pain and almost
fainting, Pellegrini told his story, as fol
lows:
"Guidi has been out of work for some
time, and out of pity for mj sister I took
the two of them into my housso. After a
short time I found that as long as the
man could live off me and get drunk oc
casionally he did not care much about
finding work. This was bad enough, hut
when he took to coming home drunk and
beating his wife It was more than I
could stand, so I threw him out. Last
night Erlda and my other sister, Lillie,
went out on an errand.
"They were gone but a short time, when
Lillie name running back, screaming 'For
nake, come quick; Santlno is killing
Erida.' 1 rushed down tho strret, and
found the man bending nvor my si?t<r
who was covered with blood. I did* not no
tice the knif" at first, but as I approached
he made a vicious lunge at me with it.
SeHng ho was armed I ran to Captain
QuiciU's saloon on the corner. I stumbled
and fell on the threshold, and before I
could gft up Guidi had plunged the knife
into me."
Pellegrini made an ante-mortem state
ment to the police definitely accusing
Guidi of the stabbing.

VALLEJO, June 7. â The United
States steamship Alert has gone out of
commission. She has been dismantled
and hauled out in ordinary alongside
her sister ship, the Ranger.
Passed Assistant Engineer Armin
Hartrauth of ti\e Mohican was de
tached prior to that vessel sailing for
Houolulu and assigned to the Brutus

Surgeon Moore of the Alert has been
ordered to the Brutus.
The Philadelphia is still in the dry
' dock and work upon her is progressing
â¢ rapidly. She is receiving a coat of war
paint and a force of workmen is kept
busy night and day on her, but as
there is considerable yet to be done it
will be fully sixty days before she will
be ready to put to sea.
The Corwin has been fitting out at
the yard since Friday and has received
coal, water, stores and ammunition.
She is ready to sail, but her destina
tion is unknown.
The British steamer Whitgift of Lon
don, purchased by the Government to
carry a cargo of coal to Manila and
tuw the Monadnock to the Philippines
from Honolulu, arrived to-day and
made fast to the dock astern the moni
tor. Work on her machinery was be
gun at once and she will be docked and
painted the regulation war color.
The cutter Grant has arrived and is
taking on powder and stores for sea.
It is very likely she will be detailed to
act in conjunction with the Wheeling

coast as far as Puget Sound.
WAR REVENUE BILL
CONFEREES AT WORK
It Is Probable That a Substitute
Silver Provision Will Be
Reported.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â After sit
ting until past midnight last night the
conferees of the two houses on the war
revenue bill resumed their sitting
promptly at 10 o'clock to-day.
When the Conference Committee ad
! journed at noon Senator Allison cx
; pressed the opinion that it would be
able to report to the Senate and House
by to-morrow. He said that excellent
progress was being made, but that It
was impossible for the present to give
details of the proceedings. The House
members are manifesting a disposition
to accept the minor amendments with
out cavil, and the indications now are
j that at least 90 per cent of the Senate
! amendments will be retained without
, serious dispute. The more important
I amendments are naturally the ones
j upon which there is most controversy,
and so far the seigniorage provision has
proved to be the most difficult problem
with which the committee has had to
deal. The Republican members of the
conference are naturally opposed to
! any provision for coining the silver in
the treasury, but th^y realize that there
i will be great difficulty to get the Sen
; ate to accept a report that does not
make some provision of this character.
The probabilities now are that a substi
tute silver provision will be reported.

MRS. SARTORIS WILL
WED AN EX-CONFEDERATE
Daughter of General Grant to Cast
Her Fortunes With General
Douglass.
BAR HARBOR, Me.. June 7.â One of
the most notable weddings this year will
be tho marriage of Mrs. Nellie Grant-
Sartoris to General Henry K. Douglass
of Maryland. Mrs. U. S. Grant will come
to Sorrento this week and with her will
come Mrs. Sartoris.
The marriage of the daughter of Gen
eral Grant to General Douglass is another
of the many tokens of the reunion of the
North and South. General Douglass is
one of the old-time soldiers, and was a
prominent figure In Bar Harbor life in the
eighties. Ho is a very striking personage,
of decidedly military bearing, and is a
millionaire. General Douglass fought
against the T'nion in the civil war. He has
Just been appointed assistant adjutant
general In the army of the nation he once
sought to disrupt, and is now in the South
and expects to go to Cuba. He is the last
surviving member of Stonewall Jackson's
staff, and is one of the noted military men
of the last war.
Before Nellie Grant married Algernon
Sartoris, General Douglass was her ad
mirer, and the gallant Confederate soldier
has been very attentive since last sum
mer, when he was at Sorrento for a few
weeks, and visited the Grants. He will
come here later in the season, and it Is
said late In tho fall the daughter of Gen
eral Grant will preside over the Douglass

Senor Moret Admits That Spain's
Affairs Are Now in Complete
Disorder.
LONDON, June 7.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Morning Post has
had an Interview with Senor Moret,
formerly Secretary of the Colonies, in
the course of which he said:
"The Government does not know
where it is going. Moreover, there is
not a person in Spain who can tell the
outcome of the present situation, which
is far more grave that is generally con
fessed. The Government has no fixed
plan. It allows matters to follow their
own course, heedless erf the ultimate
consequences.
"A campaign in favor of peace has
begun in the press and Is progressing
among the populace. I am convinced
that if a plebiscite were held peace
would be unanimously voted, even by
the soldiers. Parliament is divided as
well as the Ministers, who know not
whether to turn to the right or left.
The affairs of Spain are in complete
disorder."

I was riding on the Brooklyn elevated, said a lady, when I notrced
two nice looking men sitting opposite me who were reading the ad*
vertising cards over my head. I heard one of them read :
" Open your mouth and shnt your eyes
And 1 11 give you something to make you wise."
Whereupon the other said: "That is an advertisement of â  Rlpans
Tabulesâ They're a good thing ! I know that from ray own experience.
I used to have occasional headaches that spoiled a day for me. About
two years ago I learned about the Tabules and they stave off the head-
> ache every time. VI ; carry them in my vest pocket regularly now." '
"I must look into that," said the other man, "for I too have
headaches now and then." . " .
"Well," said his friend, "Ripans Tabules will break them up.
Here ! take one now," added he, producing a vial from his vest pocket.
"And," says the lady, "the man swallowed theTabule then and
â¢there.";.".;.-...; / \\ ,X, X .', _ /

TO PRESENT AMERICA
WITH A BATTLE-SHIP
HONOLULU, May 31.â The American
ship J. B. Walker, bound from Kobe to
New York, arrived off port on the 26th.
The captain came in to learn the latest
war news. After sizing up the situ
ation, he concluded that it was perfect
ly safe to continue his voyage around
the Horn. The American ship Kenil
worth, Cantain Baker, will leave Hilo,
Hawaii, to-morrow, bound for New
York with a valuable cargo of sugar.
Frank McStocker has advanced an
idea which has met with much favor
in this city. It is no less than a
scheme to assist in presenting the
United States with a battle-ship. The
plan suggested is for every American
and every sympathizer in the country
to give one day's salary to the fund.
When the details of the proposition are
settled upon there will be a ready re
sponse with funds.
Memorial day was fittingly observed
yesterday. Stores and Government of
fices closed at noon. The remainder
of the day was made a holiday. The
parade was made up of six companies
of volunteers, two companies of regu
lars, a detachment of blue jackets from
the Bennington, a detachment of the
Army and Navy Union and the mem
bers of George W. de Long Post. G. A.
R. t the only post outside of the United
States. Rev. J. A. Cruzan of Cali
fornia was the orator of the day.

EXPLANATION.
Th arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures ai station indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath it. If any, the
amount o:' rainfall or of melted snow in Inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Ifinhars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high " means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
1 y :air weather: "low" refers to low pres
eure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the Interior and low
al>ng the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather mey be expected
In Fummer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June The stock market
showed the same conflicting tendencies as for
several days paHt. but the reactionary element
sained -the upper hand during the afternoon and
effected sharp declines all through the list, dis
lodging quite a large amount of stock, wiping
out the margins on which it was held. There
was a significant period of dullness succeeding
this lively Belling and then began a 'iulet and
steady absorption of stocks, offerings being
taken at the ruling prices, with an entire ab
sence of any effort to mark up quotations.
It was sufficiently evident that the purpose
of the reaction was. to secure stocks at the
lower level. There was quite a lively commis
sion house demand at the opening, which lifted
prices of many stocks a small fraction. There
was a special show of aggressive strength in
Brooklyn Transit, the Heading stocks, Erie
First preferred and some of the lower South
.westerns. Metropolitan Street Railway and
Consolidated Gas were also centers of strength.
The bears met this by vigorous attack on Union
Pacific preferred, People's Gas, Louisville and
Nashville and Kansas and Texas preferred, all
of which were driven down between IV. and 2
points. This combination proved vulnerable to
attack and weakened the market at Its salient
points. . The recoveries In the final hour were
over a point In a number of Important cases
and net changes were mostly small and losses
predominated. The war news was without ln-
Jluence on the market. London was quite a
heavy seller here and was a factor In weak
ening prices and in giving a firm tone to ster
ling exchange. The demoralization of wheat
prices may have aided ' the reaction The
world's heavy receipts of wheat gave rise to a
question as to whether America's next crop can
be marketed to the best advantage. Although
money continues abundant and cheap It Is In
evitable that the approaching Government bond
Issue should absorb money and harden rates
temporarily at least. There was realizing In
bonds to-day in speculative Issues and the tone

Silver waf flat on a cessation of the Spanish
orders. The Increased importE and the de
creased exports for May are mainly due to the
receipt of more foodstuffs from the United

CHICAGO GRAJN MARKET.
CHICAGO June 7.â The Liverpool market,
which has been steadily declining for several
days, was especially demoralized to-day, and
reported a drop e^-al to 814 c per bushel In
July and 4Hc In September, with the Conti
nental markets also lower. The crop outlook
contained all that could be dealred, with the
grain In large areas ready for the reaper. The
Kansas report for June shows the condition
103â the highest ever reported at this season of
the year. The report set at rest the rumors
about chinch bugs and rust. As a result longs
quickly began to liquidate. There was urgent
short selling, sales on stop loss orders and on
exhausted margins. Under the pressure the
market went off rapidly. The rally, which fol
lowed, was due to the fact that many shorts
were disposed to take advantage of the break
to secure profits. This class of buying was
sufficient in volume to cause a temporary re
action. The Atlantic exports were astonish
ingly heavy, amounting in wheat and flour to
about 1.700,000 bushels. The figures gave the
discouraged biiUs heart enough to take on some
Wheat and caused many shorts to get out and
be In position to contemplate the situation
philosophically for a while. The total stocks In
the world's visible, as compiled by the Chicago
Daily Trade Bulletin and Liverpool Corn Trade
News, is 109.0u0.000 bushels, against 107,000,000
a> year ago. While the crowd were battling
over the small domestic receipts on the one
hand and the bearish figures connected with
the world's stockÃ on the other, a heavy thun
der storm broke on the Board of Trade build
ing that settled the fight. The shorts rushed to
get their Wheat in out of the wet and the
market became quite strong. July closed 2c
and September %c lower.
Selling orders predominated In Oate at the
opening. Later, however, buyers took hold and
the market steadily advam ed until a gain of
He over yesterday's close was made. A slight
reaction took place at the close. July closed
He lower.
After a weak opening Corn became strong
on unfavorable crop news from Kansas. There
was no export, however. This, together with
the decline In Wheat, caused a decline In prices
near the close. July closed He lower.
Heavy grain markets and lower prices for
live hogs weakened Provisions. One or two
heavy Helling orders were on the market, but
on the decline there were plenty of buyers.
July pork closed 15c lower, lard 5c and ribs
2Hc lower.

THE LITTLE ENCYCLOPEDIA.
The eye of a dragon-fly contains 28,00(
polished lenses.
Flies are not the only thing found ir
amber. In a big mass of clear amber
dredged up out of the Baltic Sea re
cently, there was distinctly visible in
Its interior a small squirrel â fur, teeth
and claws intact.
It is said that the phonograph is now
used in the Spanish telephone service.
Messages are spoken into it, and the
instrument repeats them to the tele
phone. They are also received on a
phonograph at the distant station.
The microphone is being utilized for
the education of deaf-mutes, and such
persons can actually hear sounds pro
ceeding from the micrnphonograph, and
soon learn to utter them. It appears to
be an efficacious method, even with per
sons who have passed middle life.
M. Leon Lemal has brought out a new
method of coloring glass by covering it
with a silver salt and heating it to 500
degrees centigrade. On cooling it the
glass is found to be tinged. When seen
by light passing through it the glass is
yellow, and it is blue when seen by re
flected light. Salts of gold, iron and
copper and other metals also stain glass
in this way. It is possible to produce
pretty decorations by the process.
One of the greatest wonders of Java,
"the fire island," a large lake of boil
ing mud, is situated almost in the
plains of Grobogana, some distance to
the northeast of Solo. It is nearly two
miles in circumference, and in the cen
ter immense columns of soft, hot mud
may be seen continually, rising and fall-
Ing, like great black timbers thrust
forth an^ then suddenly withdrawn by
a giant's hand. Besides the phenom
enon of the columns, there are two gi
gantic bubbles near the Western edge,
which fill up like huge balloons and ex
plode on an average three times per
minute.

RIVAL JUSTICES OF THE PEACE
3NE INVADES THE DOMAIN OF
THE OTHER.
Testimony to Show That an Excess of
Mileage Was Charged on
at Least Two
Occasions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 7.
The Grand Jury has been at work all
day on the affairs of Justices and con
stables. Some of the evidence given before
it evidently needs explanation. Expert
Denehee was at work for a long while on
the records of Justice Clift's court, and it
has been expected all along that some
thin* sensational would result. Since At
torney Kinard commenced his opposition
to the payment of certain fees before tha
Supervisors many facts have been brought
forward to show that a petty and very
undignified fight Is being waged between
the Justices and constables of Oakland
and Brooklyn townships.
Attorney Kinard has two men, E. A.
Carr and J. Ramsey, whose testimony was
given to the Grand Jury to-day. These
men declare that they were arrested at
Sixteenth street depot and that the con
stables swore to charges for mileage from
Highlands, which is many miles further
away. It is also alleged that these two
men were arrested inside the city limits,
and that consequently Justice Clift ille
gally charged fees for trying their cases.
The records in Justice Clift's office show
that Carr and Ramsey were arrested May
31 for vagrancy. The warrant shows that
they were arrested out6ide of the corpo
rate limits of the city of Oakland. They
pleaded guilty and were sentenced to
three days apiece in the County Jail, and
Judge Clift says that everything is per
fectly clear and legal.
Attorney Kinard went to the County
Jail Saturday with another gentleman
who administered an oath to them, the
nature of which no one seems to know
and s'.nce their release Mr. Kinard says
he is keeping them so that they can give
all the testimony necessary to the Grand
Jury. On the other hand, the constables
of Justice Clift's court declare they have
a grievance because of the amount of
criminal business taken to the court in
Brooklyn Township. The cases of Stacey
Rogers of Berkeley, charged with murder
of a young man named Fraser of Berke
ley, charged with felony, and another
criminal case, have been ordered by the
District Attorney to the Brooklyn court
and there tried, thus greatly increasing
the mileage of witnesses and putting them
to great inconvenience. Justice Lawrence
It is stated, has an office close to the
< ounty building and entirely outside of
his township, where he performs as many
marriages and does as much business as
can be steered his way. One of the con
stables of Brooklyn Township, C. S. Wel
don has his office on Washington street
in the heart of Oakland, and it is claimed
that much of the business that should be
done by the constables of Oakland Town
ship is done by the Brooklyn constable
Many other petty charges are being
nung from one camp to the other, and it
is very evident that justice Is for the time
being completely subordinated to politics

BERKELEY WOMEN
WERE OVERLOOKED
SAY THEY FIRST SUGGESTED
THE HOSPITAL SHIP.
Members of the Red Cross Say
That They Have Been
Slighted.
BERKELEY, June 7.-When the ladies i
of the Berkeley branch of the Red Cross
met this morning there was but one topic \
of discussion. Without wishing it to be
made public, they have prided themselves
M far upon being the first to suggest the â 
Idea of the hospital ship, and when this
mornings papers spoke of the subject in
a way which implied that the honor be- i
longed to Oakland they felt that their !
interest and activity in the undertaking ;
had been overlooked.
At an informal conference of the more â 
prominent members cailed to consider the !
question it was decided that the facts of i
the case should be given to the press in
order that the position of the Berkeley i
Society might be understood.
Mrs. Mary S. Haight, one of the pro- !
moters of the Red Cross movement in i
Berkeley, said to a Call representative j
after the meeting was over:
"It occasioned us no little surprise, I as- I
sure you, to read in this morning's paper
that the name of the Oakland branch of
the Red Cross Society should be credited
with so much In connection with this idea
of the hospital ship. Ihe Berkeley branch
was the first local organization of the
kind started upon the coast, and it was j
the first to promote the plan of a hospital
Bhlp. We have never tried to make this |
public before, but It seems only right and i
just that our place should be recognized. \
"The idea of the hospital ship originated
â¢with Mrs. Colonel C. R. Greenleaf, presi- ,
dent of our local society. She spoke of
the matter to us over a month ago. The
flret public announcement of any such
plan was made by Professor Thomas R.
Bacon of the university, who spoke of it |
at a meeting of the State Red Cross So
ciety in San Francisco. He did so as a
representative of our local branch. At
the first meeting of the State board our
delegate from Berkeley was instructed to
pledge $500 as the amount we would con
tribute, and that was over two weeks
ago. We have already succeeded in rais
ing nearly $700. So that both In being the
first to suggest the plan and the largest
contributor of any one local branch so
far we certainly stand In a position
which ought not properly to be over- |
looked, and we hope henceforth that that :
position will be accorded to us."
Mrs. C. R. Greenleaf, whose husband.
Colonel Greenleaf, is now with the United
States troops at Tampa, also expressed
surprise at the prominence accorded the
Oakland branch In the matter which she
was the first to suggest.
"The hospital ship," she said, "was
something which originated with us. We
have not tried to make this public at all,
but the honor is ours. For Its size and
numbers our society has really done very
well, but we have tried to keep it as quiet
as possible."
Several other ladles were unanimous In
regretting that their own society seemed
to have been overlooked In an honor
which belonged peculiarly to them, but
hoped that the mistake could be cor
rected.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 1898.
MYSTERY OF
A THRASHING
John Flemming Held Up
by Masked Men.
SAYS IT WAS EXPECTED.
WITNESSES TO THE AFFAIR DO
NOT UNDERSTAND.
The Victim Was Not Anxious to
Have the Alleged Robbers Aj
rested and Was Not
Robbed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
90S Broadway, June 7.
John Flemming, who resides at 40'
Ninth street, had an experience this
morning that contains many elements ol
mystery. About ten minutes after mid
night he was talking at the door of the
Seaman residence to Mrs. Seaman and hex
daughter. As he was bidding them good
night or good-morning he was admon
ished by the young ladies to be careful
not to be held up by footpads. HÂ«
laughingly replied that he did not care, but
had not gone a block before he was con
fronted by two fellows with masks.
Flemming struggled with the smaller
one and yelled lustily, while both men
showered blows upon his head with theii
fists. The Seamans heard his shouting,
and putting their heads out of their win
dows yelled also. Two men who were ap
proaching the corner of Ninth and Web
ster streets heard the shouts and saw the
scuffling, and at once ran to the relief of
Flemming. As soon as they approached
the masked men ran in one direction and
Flemming, who had held on to the hat ol
one of them, ran another way.
The strangers, who undoubtedly by
their coming on the scene saved Flem
ming from more brutal treatment, were
Martin D. Bullion and Horace Black.
They stopped Flemming and told him
that if hÂ« would run for an officer they
would keep the footpads in sight. To
their great surprise Flemming told them
he was not anxious to have the men ar
rested, but preferred to go home without
any fuss. As Flemming was wearing
some jewelry, including diamonds, which
could have been snatched from him in
less time than it took to thrash him. it
was apparent that robbery was not the
motive, although Flemmlng affects to be
lieve that it was. He told Black and Bul
lion that he had been expecting these so
called footpads for several nights, and
conveyed the impression that it was not
altogether a surprise.
To a detective who visited his home this
morning the young man said that he was
held up by two robbers, one of whom
thrashed him, while the other attempted
to stuff something down his throat. Flem
ming said that when the strangers ap
proached they did not hurry, because they
thought, and so told him, that it was
merely a friendly scuffle. Bullion denies
this, and says they ran as fast as possi
ble to Flemming's relief, and were very
much surprised that he did not wish
them to follow up the alleged robbers.
The police investigated the story to-day
and nave come to the conclusion that
there is some other motive than robbery
for the assault made upon Mr. Flemming.
T. C. Williams Will Not Remain.
OAKLAND. June 7.â The Rev. Theodore
C. Williams, who came here six months
ago in the place of Rev. C. W. Wendte,
pastor of the Unitarian church, has noti
fied that organization that he will refuse
to accept a longer term. He only con
sented to stay six months when he came
here from New York city. His health was
poor and he .doubted the effect of this cli
mate and his fears have proven correct,
for he is not able to keep up his work.
The members of the church were well
pleased with his pastorate and had hoped
to retain him. The pulpit committee is
now considering his successor.
Showed Phoenix No Leniency.
OAKLAND, June 7.â Willis Phoenix,
the mulatto convicted Saturday of burg
lary in tapping a Southern Pacific till at
the foot of Broadway, was sentenced to
five years at Folsom Prison by Judge Og
den to-day. To the jury's recommenda
tion for leniency the Judge remarked:
"Why the jury made such a recommenda
tion I can't see. There was nothing in
the testimony to Indicate that the de
fendant was guiltless. He had been con
victed of previous burglaries, showing
that he is a dangerous man."
Tallied to a Cent.
OAKLAND, June 7.â At the request of
County Clerk Jordan the funds in his
possession were counted to-day by Chair
man Talcott and Supervisors Church and

treasury, and the money in the safe ex
actly balanced the amount. On June 7 of
last year the amount in the County
Clerk's safe was $4359 26. This money is
partly taken in as fees, and partly held In
the interest of estates in probate.
Two Husbands Granted Divorces.

Moving Passion Play Pictures.
Commencing to-morrow afternoon, and]
continuing every evening and afternoon
thereafter for a limited period, will be
given a revival of the great "Passion
Play" pictures, which created Quite a stir
when they were shown at the Baldwin
Theater a few weeks since. The manage
ment of the Baldwin has had so man>
requests of late asking for a revival of
the play that arrangements have been
completed, and the play dealing with the
birth, life and death of Christ will once
more be shown in all its phases, exactly
as It is given every ten year* in the
mountains of Horitz by the peasants of
Oherammergau. Kach scone is shown
with vividness and perfect realism, and
the accompanying music and lectures add
materially to the effect of the whole.
When the play was last given evening
performances were omitted, and as there
were many who were not able to attend
the afternoon performances the coming
presentations of the play at night will no
doubt be well attended. The play will be
given every afternoon and evening, in
cluding Sunday. Reserved seats for mati
nee or night ;ire 25 cents for adults and
15 cents for children.

Chief Fletcher Does Not
Spoil Prisoners.
A RECORD FOR ECONOMY
BEATS ALL TESTS BECENTLY
MADE BY GOVERNMENT.
Does Not Serve French Dinners, but
Has a Healthy Lot of In
mates in the
Prison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
_Â,,, Broadway, June 7.
Chief of Police Fletcher claims to have
broken the record In the economical feed
ing of prisoners. His report filed last
night shows that during the past month
he has supplied two square meal^ a day
to his prisoners at an average price of
4 cents a meal.
This low flgura is said to bÂ« smaller
than the average price for feeding pris
oners in any other jail in the United
State*. For feeding all his prisoners dur
ing the month of May the Chief only ex
pended $99 80.
Everybody employed at the City Hall
has an Interest In the feeding of the pris
oners. Cnly a few weeks ago a special
resolution was passed by the Board of
Public "Works, authorizing Chief Fletcher
not to permit cabbages or onions to be
cooked in the prison in the basement on
Tuesdays or Wednesdays, because on
those days the board holds it 3 regular
session. The board did not show any
consideration for the feelings of the City
Council, which meets every Monday night,
and hence the bill of fare on Monday
always includes cabbages and onions.
"Some time ago," said the Chief to-day,
"I was considerably interested in some
Government experiments tending to
prove that an average person could live
very well on 18 cents a day. My experi
ence in the past month has taught me
that I could serve French dinners at that
price. I hope the people will not think
that we starve prisoners here because we
try not to waste money. Here is the
amount of material consumed In one
week: May 1, mutton, 45 pounds; bread,
35 pounds. May 2, fresh beef, 45 pounds;
bread, 35 pounds. May 3, corned beef, 40
pounds; bread, 30 pounds. May 4, fresh
beef, 40 pounds; bread, 30 pounds. May
5, beef, 40 pounds, bread. 35 pounds. May
6, beef, 45 pounds; bread, 35 pounds. May
7, corned beef, 40 pounds; bread, 30
pounds. /
"In addition to these amounts, wo fur
nished the prisoners with bean soup, cof
fee, once a day, use a large amount of
cabbage and onions and give the boys
rice or bean soup every day except Mon
days and Fridays. As bean soup sends a
nice flavor in the air we cook it on the
days when the Police Commission meets.
"We serve our guests two meals a day,
at 8 a. in. and 4 p. m., and so far as I
can learn they are as well satisfied as in
any prison in the State."
STOLE TWO FUR CAPES.
Fred Vendal, Alias Blum, Alleged
Leader of a Gang of Shop
lifters, Arrested.
Fred Vendal, alias Blum, who, the po
lice say, is the leader of a gang of shop
lifters, was booked at the City Prison
yesterday on a charge of petty larceny,
second offense, which makes It a felony.
He was identliled In the prison yester
day by a clerk In the fur store of Lach
man & Co., 110 Kearny street. A few days
ago, accompanied by a woman, Vendal
visited the store and pretended that he
wanted to purchase a fur cape. He and
the woman looked at several, but none
suited them and they left. After they
had gone it was noticed that two of the
capes had disappeared. The woman is
known as Joe Theron's girl. Theron is
now waiting his trial on a charge of rob-
I bery. The clerk failed to identify the
woman.
Yendal is a Russian and has served
terms for petty larceny. The police say
that he and the woman have worked
other stores in the same way, and other
; charges may yet be preferred against
: them. Vendal was arrested by Detective
! Graham and Policeman J. Moriarlfy.

WILL ASSIST THE
RED CROSS WORK
MECHANICS' INSTITUTE TO
SHOW PATBIOTISM.
Prospects of a Good Entertainment at
the Pavilion for the Benefit of
Soldiers Soon to Embark.
The present war with Spain has given
aoth citizens? and public Institutions every
opportunity to show their patriotism, and
In none Is this more manifest than the
Mechanics' Institute. When the first
volunteers left this coast they were amply
supplied with good literature by this in
stitution, and from time to time the
board of directors has, in behalf of the
membership, manifested Its patriotism In
various ways.
At the regular meeting of the board of
directors last night the time was largely
ijiven up to the discussion of methods of
rendering life mure pleasant to the vol
unteers. A letter waa received fr-jm a
French society stating that it Intended
giving the proceeds of the regular 14th of
July celebration to the Red Cross Society,
and the use of the Pavilion at one-third
the regular rates was at once granted the
society. Mr. Wilson then suggested, that
the Institute itself might do something in
the entertainment line for the Red Cross
Society, and a committee consisting of
Messrs. Fraser, Wilson, McLaren and
Healy was appointed to make preliminary
irrangements. It i 6 probable that a mili
tary demonstration will be held some
time during the month, the gross receipts
Df which will be devoted to the Red Cross
On the suggestion of Mr. Jelllson, 11
brarlnn of the Institute, the free use of
the rooms was extended to all soldiers In
uniform, and a quantity of books will
be sent with the next troopsh'ps.
The quarterly reports of the secretary
and librarian were of a very satisfactory
nature. While there has not been a great
In membership there has been no ap
preciable loss, and the financial standing
Is better than ever. There are at present
!2!<2 persons on the membership roll. The
regular quarterly meeting of the institute
will be held on Saturday evening.

The Valentine Fortune
in Litigation.
A NEW YORK BROTHER SUES
LIGHT ON THE AFFAIRS OF THE
BICH PRINTER.
A Legal Battle Over the Rancho
Corte Madera del Presidio
in the County of
' Marin.
One of the most Important land Bults
filed in Marin County for years Is that
of M. B.Valentine of New York againsi
Jennie A. Valentine and S. D. Valen
tine. It is a claim to an undivided half
of 1300 acres known as the Rancho
Corte Madera del Presidio.
Defendants axe executrix and execu
tor respectively of the will of the late
Thomas B. Valentine, founder of the
well known San Francisco firm of
Francis, Valentine & Co. Plaintiff is a
prominent lawyer and ex-Judge In New
York. His attorneys are Messrs, Grant.
Mullany and Cushing of this city!
Speaking of the case yesterday Mr.
Cushing said:
"The suit calls for an undivided half
of an undivided fourth of the well
known Rancho Cort^ Madera del Pre
sidio, Marin County, which consists of
more than 1300 acres; also of such por
tions of the original tract as may have
been conveyed by the late Thomas Val
entine to his wife in his lifetime to
gether with plaintiffs share in the is
sues, rents and profits of the lands in
question.
"The land was bought by Thomas B
\ alentine in 1868 from one Bolton Our
contention is that half the purchase
money was advanced by M. B. Valen
tine, the title being put in the name of
Thomas B. Valentine for good and law
ful reasons. We hold that the late
Thomas B. Valentine held half of the
lands in trust for his brother, and this
fact may be shown hereafter by proper
documentary evidence, though the caÂ«e
may not develop along that line "
PROTESTS WITHDRAWN.
Local Merchants Willing the War
. ship Should Go to Manila.
The remark has been made by some of
the people at Washington that the Pa
cific Coast merchants and manufactur
ers are hard to please, and that they
want everything in sight in the way of
commercial advantages. These remarks
were caused by the fact that on many
occasions the several bodies of the West
have demanded their rights when they
thought that jobbers of the East were
getting more than their share of the good
things that were going, and the Eastern
communities getting better and more fa
vors from the Government than those of
tho West. That the Western people do
not want the earth is manifest by a little
correspondence that has recently passed
between this city and Washington. The
annexed dispatch and answer were re
ceived and sent yesterday by the Cham
ber of Commerce of this city:
Washington, June 6, 1593.
Hon. Hugh Craig, President Chamber
of Commerce: I think the people of Cal
ifornia should protest against sending
from the Pacific Coast the Monterey
Monadnock and all other armored war
vessels. GEORGE C. PERKINS.
San Francisco, June 7. IS9S.
Hon. George C. Perkins, United States
Senate, Washington, U. C: We protested
on the 12th of April. In the meantime
Dewey has acquired for California a new
outlet for our energies, employment for
our shipping, business for our merchants
and opened a colonizing future for Amer
icans beyond our most ardent expecta
tions, and we of San Francisco will hold
nothing back which may be of service
to the administration, even to our jeop
ardy. HUGH CRAIG.
President Chamber of Commerce.
E. Scott, secretary of the chamber, said
that when the Spanish fleet was at large
In the Pacific the members believed that
the commerce in the western ocean was in
danger, and it was because of fear the
Spanish admiral might take a notion to
run over to this coast and pay the cities an
unwelcome visit, that the first protest was
made against lighting ships iHMiurrrmoved
from those waters. Since Dewey cleared
the Pacific in the manner he did of the
Spanish there Is less cause for fear than
before. Still, while the war is In pro
gress, danger is not all passed. Said he:
"When the War Department decided to
Bend the Monterey and the other war
ships to the Philippines the officials no
doubt knew what they were doing, and
they were satisfied that this coast was
comparatively safe. It would ill become
us. who are to receive so many benefits
from the recent movements on the part
of the Government, to make further pro
test against what the Government be
lieves to be a necessity." From the po
sition taken by the members of the Cham
ber of Commerce It is apparent that the
local business men believe that the hold
ing of the Philippine Island*) will be of
great benefit to the people of tn.s State.
In fact, such has practically been ad
mitted. To secure the trade that Is sure
to flow Into this port from the Philip
pines they are willing to get along with
out the protection from Uncle Sam s war
ships than they would demand under dif
ferent circumstances.
HIS LEG BRUISED.
Earl J. King Injured in an Elevator
Accident.
Earl J. King, an elevator boy employed
at Webber's music store, at 225 Sutter
etreet, bud a narrow escape from being
kilted yesterday afternoon. For some rea
son the boy climbed on top of the cage.
and pulled the rope. Instead of lowering
the elevator, as be intended, he found
himself going upward. K.vUlzlng he bad
pulled the wrong rope he b-came "rat
tled" and started to jump through tbe ele
vator door. His left leg was caught In the
floor and severely bruised. The screams
of the injured boy attracted tho attention
of the clerks in the music store and they
went to hie assistance. He was extricated
from his perilous position after consider
able trouble and removed to the office. A
doctor was hastily summoned and he
dressed the Injured leg. When asked by
his father why he had climbed on top of
the elevator cage the boy answered that
he had seen his predecessor "do the name
trick," and that, be was anxious to try It.
Again Changes Its Name.
Tho California Mortgage and Savings
Bank, which will henceforth be known as
the Germania Trust Company, filed arti
cles of incorporation yesterday. A short
time ago the bank reincorporated under
the name of the German-American Bank,
but at the inntance of. the .German .Sav
ings and Loan Society an injunction was
granted by Judge Ilebbard prohibiting
the bank from using that name. Whether
the German Savings ami . . Loan Society
â will bring another action to prevent the
new incorporation from using the name
"Germania" remains to be seen. The dl
rectors are Ernest Denicke. Ernest F.

About three months ago a suit. Innocent
! enough in the wording of the complaint,
| but formidable in the amount it sought to
| recover, was filed in this city by the San
' ta Rosalia Mining Company against Au
gustus Abbott, one of the stockholders
i and Its former superintendent. The suit,
i however. It is now determined, meted out
j an injustice to the defendant, and its in
stigation was solely due to the fact that
j the directors of the plaintiff corporation
were either in Ignorance of or did not
: stop to consider the fact that Mexico is &
silver standard country and that two of
its dollars equal only one of the coinage
I of the United States in the commercial
world. Since the directors of the mining
corporation have been apprised of the
fact they have dismissed the suit against
; Mr. Abbott, the dismissal being prompted
by the fact that they ha 4no suit to pros
ecute, as their books balanced to the cent
with those of their former superintendent,
who was immediately exonerated when
the comparison was made.
Abbott was the trusted employe and
business associate of the officers of the
company for about three years in the
management of one of the richest mining
properties owned in San Franciscoâ and
It was not until several months after his
retirement from the position of superin
tendent that the management determined
that suit for the recovery of a large
amount of money must be instituted. The
directors were of the opinion that they
had dug up a deep plot, that irregularities
existed in Abbott's accounts and that he
had left on a tour abroad for the sole
purpose of remaining out of the reach of
processes issuing out of California courts.
That Abbott was absent there could be no
doubt, and owing to this fact suit for the
recovery of $.10 000 was filed against him
and an attachment was issued against j
13.600 shares in the mining corporation, of
which he was owner, held in escrow by
the Bank of California and on the secre
tary's books. No service on Abbott was
made, but he became cognizant of the
facts of the case while traveling, and he
informed his attorney, Colonel W. P.
Harlow of Nogales, Arizona. Abbott was
nonplussed at the action of the directors,
but he continued on his trip, trusting to
Colonel Harlow to see that the complain
ants were properly apprised of the facts.
Colonel Harlow has completed his labors
in behalf of Abbott, has apprised the di
rectors of the facts of the case, ha* re- '
ceived their word that the former snpo'r- !
Intendent does not owe one cent to the !
corporation and is now on his way home, j
"The facts of the transaction and cir- i
cumstanois that so startled the directors I
of the corporation are these," said Colonel
Harlow last evening. "Mr. Abbott was
placed In charge of the mining property,
and he went to Mexico to see that its j
development was properly conducted, and j
it was his desire to obey the laws of Max
ico instead of his wish to disobey the '
laws of the United States that led to the
suit being tiled against him. The laws of
Mexico make it necessary to keep the !
books of all corporations in Spanish. This i
being the fact, when the income from the
mine was balanced it was placed in the
books in figures representing its value in
coin of the realm in which it was pro- ;
duced. For instance, one of the items on
the Mexican book* that roused the sus
picions nf the directors was one of $44,000,
representing a like number of Mexican
coins of that denomination, while the
books of the directors only credited the
output of the mine with $22,000, half the
amount placed to its credit by its super
tnt.-ndent on his accounts. Many similar
condition! were found to exist." and the
directors, when they received the books
from Mexico, immediately concluded that I
a shortage existed. Mr. Abbott trusted to ,
the knowledge of the directors regarding !
the difference of monry values to set I
tln-m right regarding the accounts, but '
in their anxiety to protect themselves !
against loss they did not stop to consmer
the condition of affairs.
"Tn the meantime. Mr. Abbott had ar
rived from Mexico and. after marrying
one of Oakland's belles, started on' his
wedding tour. He went to Mexico and ,
then started a tour of the United States i
It wss the tour of his honeymoon that !
too?; him away from the cfty and his !
business which led some of the directors ;
to believe that he was traveling solely to '<
escape summons in thÂ» act, on which has '
been filed against him. He learned of the I
suit, however, and instructed me to care I
for his Interests and Investigate the al- !
legations of the directors. This I did !
Two months ago I went to Mexico and !
Investigated the books of the company i
still remaining there, and learned of the !
output of the mine. I soon became ac- !
ciualnted with the condition that had led i
to the misunderstanding, and returned to I
this city. The matter had In the mcant'me
been placed in the hands of James Me- '
Nabb by the directors for settlement and
together we went over the books of the
company. An expert accountant was .-m
ployed. and when he had concluded his
labors it was found that there was not '<
one cent due from my client. To corrob- I
orate this statement. T have in my pos
session a receipt from the company for all
ltÃ demands against Mr. Abbott The
matter, which created considerable sur
prise at the time, has nroven to have been
based on a film of circumstances which
if the directors had investigated would
have disappeared without even the trouble
incurred by the filing of a complaint for
money thnt was not due."

THE SAN FRAIN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 1898.
ARTISTS WILL AID SOLDIERS.
The presence of our army has kindled such a feeling of patriotism among
artists and art students that they have given their best work for the exhibition
and sale to be held under the auspices of the Press Club Saturday afternoon
and evening, June 11.
The idea of the benefit was at first conceived of by N. Clark, who at once
appointed the following committee of assistants: Mrs. A. W. Scott, Annabel
I,ee and Caro Cook. Together these ladies have labored, and now there is no
end of art treasures in the pink room of the Press Club building, awaiting the
coming artistic festival. Hera all varieties of art are representedâ wood carv
ing, etching, china, painting, illustrating and poker drawing, in fact, every cre
ation that the master of the brush and palette idealizes or that the modeler in
clay interpretsâ has been solicited.
Governor Budd yesterday expressed himself as being heart and soul with
the movement. He said: "Nothing but sickness will prevent my being with you
Saturday, and even in that event I shall be with you in spirit."
So far all of the art schools in the city have been represented, including work
by students from the Hopkins, Lfitlmer, Jorgensen, Solly Walter and Partington
schools. The members of the Press Club will furnish the refreshments, and
Frank Coffin is preparing an excellent musical programme. The pictures that
remain from the afternoon sale will bo auctioned off by S. M. Shortridge in the
evening.
SAY THEY
HAVE BEEN
SOLD OUT
Democrats Complain
of Neglect.
IMPROPER REPRESENTATION
DISTRICT SOUTH OF MARKET
WAS OVERLOOKED.
Probability That the State Central
Committee Will Decide Against
Fusion With the Populists
and Silver Republicans.
The rebellion In the ranks of the local
Democracy, caused by the manner in
which the new City and County Com
mittee ha 6 been foisted upon the party,
gains strength as the days go by.
When the McNab-Gould-Alford com
bination elected to reform the Demo
cratic party of San Francisco and to
appoint a committee of political "high
Joints" of their own selection to take
the affairs of the party in hand in the
interest of Mayor Phelan there went
forth a murmur of disapproval from a
majority of the Democrats in the city,
none c-f whom had been taken into the
confidence of the professional reform
ers. Since the action of the trium
virate has been considered in connec
tion with the Mayor's alleged assertion
that he had decided to turn his back
on that part of the Democracy that
casts its votes in the districts south of
Market street this murmur has grown
into a roar that threatens to engulf
those responsible for the present con
dition of things.
The investigation that has been
made during the past few days shows
that those Assembly districts which re
turned Democratic majorities at the
last general election are given but a
very small percentage erf representa
tion in the new City and County Com
mittee. This percentage is so small,
in fact, that they have an aggregate
of only twenty-seven members in the
committee, while the districts which
returned Republican majorities have
a total representation of seventy-three.
The banner Democratic district in
the city is the Thirty-first. At the last
general election this district railed up
a Democratic majority of 919. The
Democrats living In this district be
lieved themselves entitled to much con
sideration when it came to the selec
tion of the men who are to have the
authority to direct the affairs of the
party. Unfortunately for them the dis
trict is situated on the Bouth side of
Market street, and, being so, was not
considered eligible to more than a
whisper in the councils of the reformed
Democracy. The district was given
two places on the City and County
Committee.
On the other Bide of Market street is
the Fortieth Assembly District, which
at the last general election returned a
Republican majority of 809. From this
district seventeen aristocrats were se
lected to serve on the City and County
Committee. The Twenty-eighth, Thir
ty-second and Thirty-third Assembly
districts were given one committeeman
each, although at the last general elec
tion they returned Democratic majori
ties of 379, 405 and 174, respectively. On
the other side of Market street the
Thirty-seventh was given thirteen
committeemen and the Thirty-ninth
eleven, although they are both Repub
lican districts.
The Democratic State Central Com
mittee, content with its marvelous paci
fication of the party in this city, is
making preparations for a stormy ses
sion next Saturday. The question of
nxing the time and place for the hold
ing of the State convention is to be de
cided, and the decision will hinge upon
the question of whether or not the
party will fuse with the Populists and
Silver Republicans. There seems to be
a general feeling against fusion among
the Democrats throughout the State,
and the same is true of the local Dem
ocracy. The party leaders believe that
fusion tends to weaken the party as a
party, and that thousands of old line
Democrats who always vote the party
ticket straight under any and all cir
cumstances consider tht-msHves at lib
erty to wander from the straight and
narrow path as soon as the ticket
ceases to be a party ticket and becomes
a fusion ticket. They also say that
a desire for fusion is a confession of
weakness.
A glance at the following table will
show why a majority of the Democrats
in the city are kicking against the new
order of things:

It will bo Been that the only excep
tion to the general rule was in the
Forty-fifth Assembly District. This is
accounted for by the fact that this is
McNab's district and the nine men who
were appointed from the district are
his personal friends. Even this excep
tion is a poor one, for the district is
on the north side of Market street and
the Democratic majority Riven at the
last election was a small one.
There are others who hold a con
trary view and contend that the point
to be attained is the acquisition of
votes, the manner In which they are
secured being but a secondary consid
eration. Such men as Nathan Cole Jr.
and A. Caminetti are ministers of this
doctrine, and are doing all in their
power to brine: about a general ac
ceptance of their views. They are sup
ported by such of the Populists as be
lieve that half a loaf is better than no
bread. They R P sÂ«rt that it is better to
side with the stronger party on the sil
ver question, and incidentally to ac
cept such of the minor offices as may
be doled out to them as a sop to their
loss of dignity, than to be martyrs to
principles that are fast becoming to be
considered questionable
The Populists of the Cator following,
who are indignant because of the at
titude of the Democrats regarding the
primary election law, Â»as well as the
treatment they received at the hands of
their allies after the last general elec
tion, are doing everything within their
power to prevent fusion during the
coming campaign. They hope, by
standing nlone, to secure the balance
of power in the next Legislature and
thus be in a position to force Demo
crats and Republicans nlike to yield up
some of the good things.
From present indications It seems
crrtnin that the Stote Central Com
mittee will deride against fusion and
that the convention' will not b^ hold
until some time Jn August or the early
part of September.
THE REFEREE BEAT HIM.
Jack Ennis Defeated by Billy Otts at
the Jefferson Athletic Club.
The JofOrson Athletic Club gave Its
monthly boxing entertainment last even
inÃ in Mowry's Hall and a fairly good
crowd was present. The preliminaries,
which were rather tame, created but lit
tle interest. They consisted of throe and
ff T Ou r, r ? und b Â°uts between C. Conway and
J. McDonald, Mortimer Meyers and J.
Hayes, A. Hennlng and J. O'Connor and
Joseph McDonald and E. Wiley.
The event of the evening was an right
round contest between Elll'y Otts and Jack
I-iiiiils, which should certainly have been '
a victory for Erfhis, but the referee. John
McCormlck, is either totally ignorant of
the rules of boxing or else ho went into
the ring with the Intention of awarding
the fight to Otts unless Knnis scored a
knock-out, which performance he came
within an ace of accomplishing.
Excepting the first and fourth rounds,
which were ended in favor of Otts. Ennis
bad certainly the better of the six rounds
fought and the very least- he should have
been entitlod to was a draw.
During the contest Referee MeCormiek i
favored Otts by throwing his entire j
weight on Ennis when separating the
contestants, thus proving beyond question I
that he was In favor of Otts winning the
mill. If the Jefferson Club will tolerate
this system of refereeing fights it can be
safely said that the members will soon
grow weary of the game and allow the
club to die a quiet death. ' k
HOW TO RIDE
IN THE PARK
New Rules Adopted by
the Commissioners.
FOR DRIVERS AND BIKERS
A LIBERAL LICENSE GIVEN THE
PUBLIC.
Simple and Practical Directions by
Observing Which People May
Escape Arrest, Fines and
Imprisonment.
At a special meeting of the Park
Commissioners held yesterday after
noon, Commissioners Joseph Austin
and A. B. Spreckels present, the safety
and convenience of the public were
considered by the adoption of the fol
lowing rules, which will be of the
greatest interest to all cyclists, drivers
and the people in general:
Section 1. Bicycles, tricycles, velocipedes
and vehicles of similar character may be
ridden or driven over any and all the
driveways in Golden Gate Park and. on
and over the boulevard or great highway,
except the driveway around Stow Lake
and the driveway leading up to Straw
berry Hill and the carriage concourse ad
jacent to the concert station and the
speed road and the main drive where par
alleled by the bicycle road.
The exclusion from the carriage con
course aforesaid is limited to the after
noons of days when there is music at the
established concert station.
Sec. 2. All persons are prohibited from
riding or driving any bicycle, tricycle or
velocipede on or over any of the lawns or
footpaths in Golden Gate Park, except
said vehicles may be led over the short
walk leading from Page-street entrance
to the south drive, and also over the walk
leading from the corner of Fulton and
Stanyan streets to the North Ridge ropd.
Sec. 3. Not more than two bicycles, tri
cycles or velocipedes going in the same di
rection at the same rate of speed shall be
ridden abreast.
Sec. 4. All vehicles named in this ordi
nance must be driven in a straightaway
course aa nearly as possible, and must
not run or be driven crosswise, curving to
or fro. Wheelmen must conform to the
customary rules of the road. In meeting
a vehicle going in the opposite direction
they must pass on the right-hand side. In
passing a vehicle going in the same direc
tion they must pass on the left-hand side
Sec. 5. Wheelmen may ride their ma
j chines on the walk running along the
south of the speed track. Also on the
walk commencing at or near Thirty-fifth
avenue, i! extended on the north drive
and terminating at about Forty-eighth
avenue, if extended.
Sec. 6. On days on which music is played
in Concert valley the speed of bicycles on
the main drive, between Stanyah street
| and Sixth avenue, shall be limited to six
miles an hour.
Sec. 7. All persons are prohibited from
; riding, pushing or driving any bicycle, tri-
I cycle or similar vehicle along the main
i drive where the bicycle path parallels said
! drive.
Sec. 8. All persons are prohibited from
traveling on the road known as the bicycle
path, except they be riding or leading a
bicycle, tricycle or similar vehicle.
Sec. 9. All person are prohibited from
riding or driving any bicycle or similar ve
hicle at a greater rate of speed than ten
miles per hour or one mile in six minutes.
Sec. 10. Any person who shall violate
any of the provisions of this ordinance
shall )ip doemcd guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction shall be punished by
a line of not less than five dollars nor
more than five hundred dollars or by im
prisonment in the County Jail for not less
than five days nor more than six months.
Among other business at the meeting
of the commissioners the resignation of
Irving' M. Scott, heretofore announced
exclusively in The Call, was accepted.
It was also decided to build a number
of sheds at the end of the speed track to
accommodate horsemen who drive valu
able animals over that course. Heretofore
horsefl were liable to t;iko cold after
sprinting over the track, but the innova
tion will obviate the danger, as it will
allow owners to blanket and house their
animals until cooled off.
A bridle path will soon be added to the
many excellent improvements in the Park.
Plans and specifications were examined
by the commissioners and it is probable
that orders will be issued in a few days
for the beginning of work on the path.
COOKS INLET HAS
NO CUSTOM-HOUSE.
VESSELS CANNOT GET CLEAR
ANCE FROM THAT PORT.
The Only Revenue Official Left That
Place Last Fall and No One
Knows When He Will
Return.
According to the story told by the map
ter of the schooner Thomas S. Negus the
Treasury Department would do well to
appoint a Customs Inspector at some
known or easily discoverable point in
Cooks Inlet, Alaska. There Is a rumor in
the department at Washing-ton that there
is such an inspector in the inlet, but the
rumor is unfounded.
The Negus arrived from Cooks Inlet yes
terday, after taking some mining outfits
to that point. Before leaving the schooner
was unable to clear through the Custom
house at that place for the reason that no
Custom-house could be found, and while
there were plenty of seals there there was
no officer to put them on paper or even on
board. The Inlet is a very large body of
water, with a very long seaboard with nu
merous bays and Inlets. On March 31 the
Treasury Department Issued a circular
stating that the location of the Custom
house at the Inlet was Saldonia. This cir
cular was not received at the San Fran
cisco Custom-house until after the vessel
left for Alaska and the captain oTthe N>-
Kus, of course, was not advised of it. The
schooner made her first call at Coal Bay,
formerly known as Kashomaok Hay. Sal
donia is supposed to be upon this bay, but
the master was unable to find from any
one there that there ever had bern a Cus
toms otfioer at that point. He next called
at Staritchkof. where he found only na
tives, who could Impart no information of

Customs officers. The next call was at Ku
silof, at which place the superintendent of
the cannery informed the skipper that
there was a Customs official at Tuyonic.
The skipper, not willing to leave Alaska
without clearance papers, sailed to Tuyo
nic, where he found that a Customs In
spector had bcon stationed, but that that
officer had left for Seattle in the fall of
1897. and that he had not returned.
The Negus landed her passengers at Tu
yonic, and the master of the schooner
Rattler informed him that there was no
Customs Inspector at Salfornia, the Rat
tler having just left that port. There is
no Salfornia in Alaska, and the Rattler's
skipper no doubt meant Saldonia.
Under the circumstances Collector Jack
son exonerated the master of the Negus
from all bin me for having left Alaska
without clearance papers. The Collector
will call the attention of the Secretary of
the Treasury to the necessity for a Cus
toms Inspector in the frozen north.
TWO NEW PRIESTS.
Ordinations to Be Held To-Day by
the Bishop of California.
The Trinity ordinations, which last year
were held at San Mateo, will occur this
morning at the Cathedral Mission of the
Good Samaritan, and Rev. Edward Mor
gan, who for a year has acted as assist
ant rector of the mission, and Rev. David
Charles Gardner, assistant of St. Ste
phen's Church, will be advanced to the
priesthood. The Bishop of California will
officiate, and Rev. Messrs. Warfleld and
Kip will be the presenters. A large num
ber of Episcopal clergy will assist. The
sermon will be preached by the Rev.
George Wallace of San Mateo. Rev. Mr.
Morgan will soon leave for work in an
Eastern diocese. He has greatly endeared
himself to his parish by his faithful work
among the sick poor.
Unpermitted Cargo.
Collector Jackson has been instructed by
the Secretary of the Treasury to deny the
request to allow "unpermitted cargo" to
remain upon the wharf In case of any ves
sel which does not belong to a regularly
established steamship line.
While this order restricts the privilege
to vessels of regularly established steam
ship lines it is not held to prevent grant
ing the privilege to the Southern Pacific
Company for merchandise arriving in
transit, as the cars belong to a regular
line and are considered vessels when
bringing "In transit" poods.
Want War Bonds.
The people of this city are just begin
ning to awaken to the fact that they have
an excellent opportunity to invest their
spare money in safe securities, the new 3
per cent war bonds that the Government
has recently authorized. Books for sub
scriptions were opened on Monday morn
ing at the First National Bank "and by
the time of closing about $125,000 had been
subscribed. While many were for the
larger denominations. $500 and $1000 still
many availed themselves of the chance to
invest in bonds of from $25 up. Yester
day the rush commenced in earnest and
when the bank closed the amount sub
scribed was something over $400,000. So
far the largest single subscription was for
$50,000. While the bonds are being bar
gained for at par value it is very likely
that as soon as the complement is filled
they will be at a premium. The total
issue will be $300,000,000.
May Have Attempted Suicide.
Rose Williams, who gives vapor baths
for a living at 1217 Market street, was
taken from her room by Sergeant Dono
van and Officer O'Keefe and sent to the
Receiving Hospital for treatment. The
woman was in a stupor, and showed signs
of poisoning. The usual remedies were
applied by Dr. Frank E. Fitzgibbon, and
she was put to bed. Up to a late hour
she had not gained consciousness. A
further search of her room disclosed a
letter addressed to Fred Burger, an em
ploye in the Baldwin Grotto. In it she
reproached him for his cruelty in desert
ing her, and ended with words of forgive
ness. It is not thought likely that she
will recover, as she is weak and emaci
ated.
Last Night's Fires.
While some employes were bottling
liquors at the establishment of Samuel
Brothers, 132-134 First street, last even
ing sealing wax used in the operation
caught fire and was the origin of a $200
blaze.
At 8:30 o'clock an alarm was turned in
from box 356 for a fire on the Lombnrd
street wharf. It Is supposed that c. fish
erman left a lighted cigarette on one of
the stringers and the wood became ig
nited. The loss was nominal.
