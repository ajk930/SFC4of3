HOGANSBTTRQ, N. V., Sept. 6. â At about noon to-day two south
â pans of the International bridge of the New York and Ottawa Rail
way, now under course of construction across the St. Lawrence River
three miles above the St. Regis Indian village, fell without warning.
Eighty men at work on the bridge were thrown into the river sixty
feet below. Over thirty were picked up ana taken to Cornwall Hos
pital, and twenty-seven are now missing.
The bridge consisted of three spans,
of which two were completed. The
third was nearly completed when the
couth pier gave way at its foundation,
causing both spans to fall into sixty
feet of water, taking its load of human
freight witu it.
Following Is a list of the dead and
seriously wounded as known at Â«â¢Â»'-*

W. Thompson, Montreal, leg broken.
John Fraser, Quebec, leg cut off.
D. Barton, Buffalo, legs crushed.
The scene of the accident Is
about four miles from Hogansburg,
above the St. Regis Indian reservation.
Thp bridge that gave way was built
across the St. Lawrence River at the
foot of Long Sault Rapids. The water
at this point is known to be as swift
as in any part of the river. The im
mediate cause of the disaster and the
giving way of the span of the bridce
seems to have been the washing away
of one of the large piers.
The pier in question was begun last
fall and work was continued and finish
ed this summer. The contract work
was in charge of Messrs. Sooy Smith
& Co.. well known bridge builders. The
pier had been accepted as perfectly re
liable and safe. It would seem that the
BwiftneÃS of the current was underes
timated.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 7.â A special dis
patch from Omdurman says:
Hubart Howard, the correspondent
of the Times, met death owing to his
eagerness to get the first news of the
fate of Karl Neufeldt and the other
European prisoners of the Khalifa. He
pressed his way Into the city before it
was safe to do so, and was going all
alone along a narrow alley leading to
the prison when he was attacked and
killed.
The first display of heroism on the
Dervish side was made by the Khali
fa's brother, Yantub, with his adher
ents, who, utterly regardless of our
terriffic fire, made a superb attempt to
retrieve the day's fortune. Far from
asking quarter, they simply hugged
death. Yantub died In the presence of
his old enemy, Slatin Pasha.
The war correspondent of the Daily
Telegraph at Omdurman says:
"After the entry of the troop* into
the Dervish capital it was found neces
sary to further bombard the .Khalifas
house. General Kitchener and his
staff were standing ia the vicinity and
narrowly escaped being killed by the
shells.
"I estimate the enemy's killed at
more than 15,000."
The San Francisco Call
Late reports from Cornwall hospital
say thirty-three men have been taken
out of the river and transferred to the
hospital. Eighteen of them have since
died. The latest information makes it
probable that the death list will reach
thirty.
As far as can be learned, eighty
seven men were on the payroll, of
whom eighty-two reported for work
this morning. Of this list only thirty
eight have actually been accounted for.
CORNWALL, Ont., Sept. 6.â An eye
witness of the fall of the New York and
Ottawa Railroad bridge says he was
sitting on the bank of the river watch
ing the workmen when there ceme a
fearful crash. Two spans of the bridge
collapsed and the immense mass of
timber and iron dropped. Then he saw
corpses come to the surface and the
work of rescue began. This was hope
lessly Inadequate there being only a
few boats in the vicinity and very few
men who would undertake to swim out
into the turbulent waters. Many work
men Mho might have been saved were
drowned before help could reach them.
Mangled bo :\es came to the surface for
a moment and then passed out of sight.
Even those Mho were got to land alive
were in such a condition that many
died on the way to the hospital. Some
had their backs broken; others both
legs, while others were crushed by the
heavy irons.
Among those who are missing are
Foreman Thomas F. Brady, Cyril
Campbell, William Jackson and W.
Cubby.
About five of the men employed cm
the span were Americans, who came
here to work for the Phoenix Bridge
Company. The remainder were mostly
Indians, who acted as assistants.
Every man on the division went down
with the wreck. Many of those who
escaped climbed up the ironwork
which still rest* d on piers at either
end.
The scene around the Hotel Dieu,
where the wounded and dying were
taken, is heartrending. The wives and
relatives of missing men are anxiously
inquiring after their loved ones.

at Sinecures.
Sp*clal Dispatch to The Coll.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 6.â Retrenchment
will be necessary in all city depart
ments during the coming year to pre
vent the municipality from plunging
headlong into debt. This new mode of
doing things in San Jose was brought
about this afternoon by the City Coun
cil fixing the tax rate for the fiscal
year at $1 2jÃVfc- It strikes a heavy blow
to extravagant officials and will result
in purging many offices of useless depu
ties.
Twenty-eight and a half cents of the
levy is for bonded Indebtedness, leav
ing $1 to pay the running expenses of
the city. The rate Is levied c-n b valu
ation of $16,000,000â some $2,000,000 lower
than last year. This gives the city
$30,000 less than last year, and it will
require the utmost economy to get
along on the allowances made for the
various funds. The rate last year was
$1 25, but lower valuatic-n and increased
expenses this year make a material
difference.
The School Department will have to
cut off some of the sinecures on Its pay
roll in order to get along on the appor

CANDTA, Island of Crete, Sept. 6. â Candia is In a state of anarchy. A collslon . between the Mussulmans,
who were demonstrating against European control, and the British authorities," who have been installing Chris
tians, as revenue officials, culminated to-day in bloody fighting between the Mussulmans and the British troops. Riots \
took place In various parts of the city and many have been killed. â-''/*,Â»,, --- 1. J- ' ,- ;
When the outbreak was fiercest a warship stationed in the harbor began firing shells, with the result that a

not pass without further pillage and destruction. ' .-. ' 'â  * . ~< ,<j _., p ,
â¢ The trouble began with the attempt of the British military authorities to install Christian officials. They had
appointed a council of internal: control to administer the tithe revenues, and a detachment of soldiers was .sta
tioned outside the. office as a precaution. . W^ '- ''â  , _" ; . t
A crowd of unarmed Mussulmans, who had been demonstrating against the Christians, attempted to force an

the soldiers. . 'J' " *> . -~ ;;./

Special precautions are being taken here, and at Retimo troops are being held in readiness.

MUSSULMAN RISING WAS UNEXPECTED.
LONDON, Sept. 6. â Advices from Canea were received this morning from a correspondent there, who alsc
telegraphed that he feared for his colleague at Candia, as he was unable, to communicate with him. The fact that
no dispatches were received from Candia after the bombardment began seems to indicate that the situation there
is serious. -^j:S^:-y
It has been known -that* the Mussulmans were discontented at the joint rule of the powers in Crete. This
was largely due to\the fact that they were confined in the towns, while the Christians were allowed the liberty
of the island. But tne rising of the Mussulmans was unexpected. -
The Cretan fleet \s under command of the French Admiral, Pottier, as the senior officer, and consists of Brit
ish, French, Russian, Italian and Austrian ships, Germany having recently withdrawn from participation in the
joint control or government of Crete. The troops of the powers are divided among the different towns, the British
garrisoning Candia, The Mussulmans' complaint, made recently, resented that the Christians should be permitted
to enter the towns, unless the Mussulmans were allowed the freedom ;of the country, and they further
declared that the representatives of the powers had not fulfilled the latter part of the bargain, and that while they
were confined to the towns the ' Christians pillaged their property, in the country.
The British Consul at Canea has started for Candia on board the British battleship Camperdown.
TURKS SET FIRE TO THE TOU/IV.
CANEA, Sept. 6.â The Turks set fire to the whole town of Candia.

Ing of trustees to-night the matter was i
discussed and the members declared
that the levy would not pay half the ex
penses of the high school. To begin
the year there is a deficiency of $6000
in the School Department. The position
of "Supervisor of Kindergartens," re
cently created for Miss Belle Macken
zie, and several other snaps in the de
partment must i>* dropped.
The Fire and Police Departments will
also have to be run differently, as there
will be between $3000 and $4000 less for
each of these departments.
Mayor Martin stated thie evening
that he and the Council had been doing
some figuring and concluded that the
city could be run on this levy. The
various- departments would have to cut
down expenses, which could be done.
The sooner the city got down to con
ducting its business on business princi
ples the better. He thought none of
the departments would be seriously

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 6.-A large crowd
attended the fair to-night. There were a
number of special attractions which were
well received by the spectators.
The center of attraction among the ex
hibits wore two models of ships built by
the Union Iron Works of San Francisco.
I One of the models which held the most
! attention was that of the steamship Peru
the other was that of the United States
cruiser San Francisco. Not a rope nor a
pulley is missing on the cruiser.
The art gallery was thrown open to-night
One of the most noticeable features is the
display of pen and ink sketches. C. Wei
sel, the Sacramento artist, has the largest
i display. Among his sketches is one which
is particularly noticeable. It is entitled
"Yellow Fever," and depicts a draped
skeleton holding a sick soldier by the
wrist and throwing its drapery around
him.
Other clever sketches by Weisel are por
! traits of old men, made from models in
j San Francisco, where the young artist
has been studying; a "Scene in Corbett's
pool-rooms;" a medley of character
sketches entitled "Summer Breezes "
some Spai.ish caricatures and a picture of
the artist himself, surrounded by a num
| ber of comical character sketches.
Another artist whose pen and ink
sketches are greatly admired is Miss Alice
Best of San Francisco. She has a num
ber of clever pictures on exhibition.
The poultry exhibit is attracting con

features of the fair.
The musical programme is up to the
usual standard and is received with con

A MODERN
BORGIA

Were Murdered With Pow
dered Arsenjo.
Mrs. Botkin Was in the City of Paris the
Afternoon the Handkerchief
Was Bought,
Another delay has become imperative
in the proceedings that will be under
taken to send Mrs. Cordelia Botkin to
Delaware to be tried for her life. In
that delay there is for the accused
woman an omen of greatest evil. The
coil of incriminating circumstances is
growing tighter around her and the
authorities will waiÂ£ now for new tes
timony of guilt from across the conti
nent. At the request of the local po
lice three affidavits were made yester
day at Dover. The only purpose of
these documents is to prove that the
poison used by the assassin was pow
dered and not crystallized arsenic. The
proof on this point is conclusive. The
deadly drug that swept Mrs. Dunning
and Mrs. Deane out of existence was
the same in character as that which
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin frankly admits
she bought at the Owl drug store on
June 1.
At first it was reported that crystals
of arsenic had been used by the modern
Borgia, but the report and testimony of
the State Chemist of Delaware sets all
doubt at rest. This official is emphatic
in his assertion that adulterated pow
dered arsenic was the terrible agent of
POWDERED ARSENIC THE AGENT OF DEATH.
Delaware Officers prepare New and Important Affdavits
Against Mrs. Botkin.
WILMINGTON, Sept. 6. â In response to the requests of the
San Francisco authorities Deputy Attorney General Cooper sent to
California to-night three affidavits to be used by the prosecution
against Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. Mr. Cooper refused absolutely to
tell the contents of the f-ftidavits, but it was ascertained from an
other source the nature of the documents. Two of the affidavits
were made by Doctors Bishop and Downs, who attended Mrs. Dun
ning and Mrs. Deane. Their affidavits set forth in detail the
symptoms of arsenic poison as shown by the two women after they,
were taken ill. These affidavits were merely to strengthen the
proof that arsenic killed Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane.
The third and most important affidavit was made by Coroner
Wills. Its purpose was to prove the accuracy of the testimony
taken at the inquest, particularly the evidence given by State
Chemist Theodore B. Wolfe, who made an analysis of three pieces
of candy sent to Mrs. Dunning. The testimony of Dr. Wolfe showed
that the arsenic found in the chocolates he examined was powdered
arsenic, similar to that Mrs. Botkin admits she pitrchased. Tho
poison was worked in through the cream of the chocolates and was
in a powdered form. Dr. Wolfe found in one of the three pieces
he examined a lump of arsenic the size of a pea, but such lumps are
common to the ordinary powdered arsenic. The fact that in only
one or two of the chocolates were found lumps, while in all the
other analyses they showed powdered arsenic, proves that crys
tallized arsenic could not have been used. Dr. Wolfe has positive
proof on this point and it will be sent to San Francisco immedi
ately.

may need witnesses to prove her as
sertion so overwhelming is the testi
mony being massed against her.
She does admit, however, that on thÂ«
| afternoon of August 3 she left hei
rooms and called upon a friend living
on Bush street. â¢ Thus far the policÂ«
have not been able to trace her abso
j lutely to the scenes of the murderess'
I plans and preparations. She only looks
like the woman who bought candy at
George Haas' store and nothing more.
Such an identification as that is a weah
foundation upon which to erect a gal
lows. But the pelice can go further,
They made a tremendous leap in ad
vance yesterday when they discovered
! that on the afternoon of August 3 Mrs,
! Botkin was actually in the City oi
i Paris. It was at that very time, thÂ«
police say at that very moment, that
a handkerchief identical with that sent
in the box of poisoned candy was
bought. The saleswoman's tag is therÂ«
| as proof.
There is absolutely no doubt that
Mrs. Botkin was In the dry goods house
lat that time. One of the cashiers, who

| order from Stockton for her. But no
I one will say that she bought the hand
| kerchief. At that point the trail is lost
j in the maze of forms and faces that
I appear before the clerks in the confu
sion of a daily, bustling routine. But
the circumstantial evidence, perhaps no
more than an immaterial coincidence,
is an ominous one for Mrs. Botkin.
These new facts have been received
by the defectives with congratulation.
The accused woman appeared before
Judge Cook yesterday, but the proceed
ings on habeas corpus were continued
for a week. The incident was signifi
cant, as it gave the witnesses against
Mrs. Botkin an opportunity to test
their ability to identify her.
MRS. BOTKIN WAS AT
THE CITY OF PARIS
On the Day Before the Fatal Candy
Was Mailed She Cashed a Post
office Order There.
Chief of Police Lees and Acting: Dis
trict Attorney Hosmer devoted all of yes
terday to preparing additional affidavits
in the Botkin case. Neither official could
state when the Delaware requisition
would be presented to Governor Budd.
As the request for the extradition of Mrs.
Botkin has not been officially presented
to the Governor, he has not indicated
whether the hearing will be held here
or in Sacramento. It is the expressed
wish of all concerned In the case that
the Governor will find it convenient to
conduct the proceedings here.
The presentation of the case against
the accused woman will consume two or
three days, perhaps longer. The affida
vits of fifteen or twenty witnesses will
accompany the request of the State of
Delaware. Considerable oral testimony
will also be presented by the prosecu
tion. Arguments will then follow, which
are expected to be of great length and in
tense interest, as the case is without a
parallel in the history of American Juris
prudence.
Mrs. Botkin's attorneys have signified
their willingness to give the prosecution
all the time they ask for before beginning
the legal contest which means so much
to the woman now in jail.
Mr. Hosmer stated last night that the
preparation of the case against the de
fendant would consume the remainder of
the week. Three additional affidavits
were forwarded from Delaware last even
ing and as they arc not due here until
Sunday, the extradition proceedings can
not open before Monday or Tuesday next.

NAVY'S PRIDE TO
RETURN TO THE
PACIFIC COAST
Battleship Oregor) to Agair) f^ound
th)e Horn, ar>d With Her Will
Come the lowa.
It now appears certain that, as a result of recent developments
in the international situation or because of a desire of the adminis
tration to be prepared for emergencies, the battle-ships Oregon and
lowa will leave within the next ten days for the Pacific Coast. These
vessels are being put in the best possible shape at the Brooklyn
Navy Yard.
Reports in circulation indicate that the vessels have been ordered
to Manila, but it is believed these vessels will be attached to the
Pacific station. There they will be in such position that they will
be able to defend the Pacific Coast in case of attack by a foreign
power or hasten to- the Philippines to give support to Rear Admiral
Dewey.
The battle-ships could easily make eleven knots an hour in mak
ing the run from New York to the Pacific Coast and it is believed
they could reach their destination in fifty-five days.
Should they start within the next ten days they will reach their
destination early in November, before the peace commission con
cludes its labors. Of course during practically all of October they
would be on the Pacific and could make a dash for the Philippines
from any point along the Southern or Central American coasts
should the department determine that it were wise to send them.
Commander H. B. Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equipment,
who has charge of matters relating to supplying coal for naval
ships, has collected a number of colliers at Hampton Roads, which
carry about 17,000 tons of coal. Not all of these will be sent, but a
sufficient number will accompany the vessels to insure a plentiful sup
ply of fuel. The colliers are sent because the neutrality obligations
of the South American States will prevent them giving coal to either
American or Spanish ships.

SACRAMENITO. Sept. 6.â Poisoned
cabbage is responsible for the severe
Bickness of a number of persons in Sut
terville, this county. A few days ago
several residents of that town bought
cabbages from a Chinese peddler who
claimed he was from Sacramento. After
eating the cabbage they became sick,
and as they exhibited symptoms of
poisoning a doctor was sent for and
at once detected that they were suffer
ing from arsenical poisoning and gave
them an antidote. One of the victims
was a woman named Mrs. James. In
telling the story of her illness to-day
she said:
"I had just left my homo and was
walking down the road when I, met a
Chinese peddler, who had a â wagon
load of cabbages. He said he was
from Sacramento, and as the cabbages
appeared to be all right 1 bought one
of them and advised him to drive into
town, as I realized that he would be
able to sell the entire load. I took the
cabbage which I had bought to my
home and prepared to cook it. I no
ticed several of the leaves were cov
ered with a white substance, but not
thinking anything of it at the time I
placed it in a kettle containing hot
water. My husband and I ate of the
cabbage and were at once seized with
violent pains.
"Realizing that we were poisoned, we
sent for a physician, who after consid
er;-, ble trouble, relieved us. The follow
ing day we heard that three Portuguese
ranchers had purchased cabbages from
the Chine&e peddler, and fearing for
them, we went to see th^m. To our
surprise we found them all ill â victims
of the poisoned cabbage. One of thorn
was seriously ill, and for a time we
thought he would die. He finally re
covered, however, and now threatens
vengeance on the Chinese peddler on
sight.
"Just what motive the Chinese had
I am at a loss to know. It is possible
that he was not aware that the cab
bages were sprinkled with arsenic and
started out to sell them. It is a strange
fact that he has not been here since he
sold us the cabbages. Whether he knew
of our sickness and was afraid to con
front us, I am at a loss to state. I
have endeavored through my husband
to find out if the cabbages were sent by
an enemy, but have been unsuccessful.
"A short time ago one i f the Portu
guese who had partaken of poisoned
cabbage received an anonymous letter
in which it stated that his life would
be taken. Thinking it a joke he paid
no attention to it until he was taken
ill from the effects of arsenic. I do
not think I have an enemy, "but in
future I intend to closely examine
everything I buy to see whether or not
it contains poison."
The police are investigating the case
and hope to be able to land the culprit
in a few days. They believe the pois
oned cabbages were given the Chinese
peddler to sell to residents of Sutter
ville. Whether the poisoner intended
to kill one or more persons it is im
possible to tell. The police, however,
believe that the Portuguese were the
intended victims and that the China
man was instructed to give them as
many of the poisoned cabbages as they
wanted.

DEATH LIST SMALL AT THE
SECOND DIVISION HOSPITAL
WASHINGTON, Sept 6.â The following telegram was received
to-day at the War Department:
CHATTANOOGA, Term., Sept. 6.â General H. C. Corbin, Wash
ington: Second Division, Third Corps, hospital closed yesterday. This
is the one that has been most generally and severely criticized. Fol
lowing is its record since establishment, June 10: Total number of pa
tients, 2462; total deaths, 33. Of these cases 270 were typhoid, and of
the total deaths 28 were from typhoid.

attempts to find gold, finally dropped
their outfits anywhere and hurried Sack
to Valdez.
News of this situation spread among the
Indians, who hastened forward from both
seacoast and Interior to enrich themselves
with a winter's supply of provisions.
Never before have they enjoyed such
luxury. In previous years great loads of
furs have brought less than they are now
securing free.
Morton Ramsdell, a young Tacoma so
ciety man who returned from Copper
River to-day, says that the few whites
who winter in the interior will also fare
well at small expense. Ramsdell says:
"Flour sold as low as 60 cents per sack;
Mocha and Java coffee, 4 cents a pound;
bacon, 5 cents, and everything else in
proportion, including clothing and tools.
The Indians and whites who remain will
have more clothes than they can wear.
Of course four bus was not the regular
price for flour, but occasional sales were
made at that figure. It usually sold at
$1 50 per hundred pounds, though it cost
at least 15 cents a pound to get it into the
country."
Ramsdell thinks that twenty-flve or
thirty people were drowned in the swift
Klutlna River.
Latest Yukon advices state that four
tributaries of Seventy-mile River have
been found rich in gold and are being ex
tensively worked. They were named
Crooked, Barney, Deep and Flume creeks.
Casper Ellengen, recently arrived at
Dawson, stated that when he was at
Seventy-mile mine-owners on these
creeks were offering men $15 per day to
work. Soon after many men rushed in
and wages were reduced somewhat.
About 200 secured claims, taking out by

BANNER DAY AT
THE ENCAMPMENT
Parade of the Naval
Veterans.
MANY REGIMENTAL REUNIONS
OLD COMRADES DRAWN CLOSER
TOGETHER.
Contest for the Honor of Command
ing the Grand Army of the
Republic Becoming Some
what Complicated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Sept. 6.â The second
day of the thirty-second annual en
campment of the Grand Army of the
Republic was p. banner day â a "Star-
Spangled Banner" dayâ in every way.
The weather was delightful. It has
rained every night preceding the en
campment days, and after a shower
cooler weather is promised for the big
parade to-morrow. The Ohio labor
parade on Monday and the naval pa
rade to-day were both under clear
skies and nature promises to smile on
the old veterans in line to-morrow.
Some of the veterans advocate dis
continuance of encampments, because
they want all remembrances, even c-f
sectional differences wiped out, but
they say they will attend the annual
encampments as long as they are held.
The leading surviving o.ucers of the
Civil war are prevented attending the
encampment this year, because of the
Spanish-American war. Among the
ladies who are missed none is referred
to more than Mrs. John A. Logan.
Much disappointment is expressed be
cause President McKinley and ex-
President Harrison are not here, as
they have been in former years. In the
absence of the President Governor
Bushnell of Ohio will occupy his place
on the reviewing stand to-morrow, sur
rounded by Governor Pingree of Michi
gan, Governor Mount of Indiana, Gov
ernor Atkinson of West Virginia and
other Governors with their staffs.
The decorations are unusually elabor
ate, the electric light designs in the
public squares and at the street inter
sections surpassing even the finest ef
forts of past expositions, and the en
tertainment is equaily lavish.
This was Naval Day and to-morrow
is Army Day, to be followed on Thurs
day by the Peace Jubilee. The National
Naval Association gave a grand parade
this morning.
After the parade the naval veterans
were entertained on steamboats and
they captured Coney Island. The fea
tures of the day were the regimental,
brigade and other reunions, at which
the old comrades got closer together
than on any other occasions. There
were demonstrations on the arrival of
several department commanders and of
Governors and their staffs.
The citizens tendered receptions to
Commander-in-Chief Gobin, Rear Ad
miral Kelley, Mrs. D. J. Martin, presi
dent of the Women's Relief Corps;
Mrs. Flora M. Davey, president of the
Ladies of the G. A. R. ; Mrs. Jennie
Laird, president of the National Asso
ciation of the Ladies of the Naval Vet
erans, and others.
The contest for commander-in-chlef
has become much more complicated
with the arrival of a large delegation
from New York, headed by Corporal
Tanner, in support of Colonel John C.
Sheets of Yonkers. This not only di
vides the department of New York
against Colonel A. D. Shaw of Water
town, but it also divides the vote uf
other Eastern departments that were
expected to be solid for Shaw. While
Colonel J. A. Sexton of Chicago had
only one or two votes in the Illinois
delegation against him he is now los
ing some support through the candi
dacy of Colonel Tom Anderson of To
peka, who is getting Western votes
that were depended upon for Sexton
and who was considered a favorite in
the race as the only Western candidate
until the Kansas man was brought out.
I. F. Mack, the Ohio candidate for
commander-ln-chief, is embarrassed in
his canvass by the fact that W. C.
Johnson of Cincinnati has been deter
mined on as the man for senior vice
commander, and the leading two offi
cers are not likely to go to the same
State.
Commander W. E. Atkjns has hereto
fore been considered the leading candi
date for rear admiral of the National
Naval Association, but he is having a
close contest now with Commodore J
G. R. Foss for that position. The con
tests for the new offices have now be
come quite animated among the ladies.

HOLLAND'S YOUNG
QUEEN ENTHRONED
AT AMSTERDAM
Loyal Subjects Greet tr;e Reces
sion of Wilhelmina With Bois
terous Acclaim.
"Beautiful Is My Vocation; Beautiful My TasK"
Her Assurance to the People of tbe
Netherlands.
AMSTERDAM, Sept. 6.â The events
of yesterday were but the overture for
far more important ceremonies to-day
upon the occasion of the long awaited
enthroning of Queen Wilhelmina, who
came of age on August 31. The day
began with a salute of 101 Runs and a
majestic choral performed by trumpet
ers from the crenelated towers of the
five great churches of Amsterdam.
Crowds of people assembled early in
the morning and took up positions
from which to view the royal proces
sion to the Neukirk, an edifice that, in
spite of its name, is 400 years old. By
10 o'clock the Damplatz presented a
magnificent spectacle. The center was
cleared and the sides were densely
thronged, the front places being re
served for the children of the orphan
ages. The multitudes were kept back
by lines of troops of all arms.
From the principal gate of the palace
to the chu*ch. between lines of naval
cadets, was stretched a cay awning
decorated with streamers, and velvet
carpeting was laid over the short dis
tance which the Queen had to tra
verse.
At 10:35 the princely families of
Saxe-Weimar and Wied drove to the
church, escorted by cavalry with bands
playing and drums beating, while the
troops presented arms.
Almost immediately afterward the
Queen's mother appeared in a state
coach, which was surmounted by a
gilt royal crown upon a crimson cush
ion. She received an ovation and was
greeted with endless cheering and cries
uf "Long live the Queen-Mother."
About ten minutes later the beating
of drums and the blare of trumpets
signaled the fact that Queen Wilhel
mina had left the palace, and at that
very moment the sun burst from the
clouds in brilliancy which was looked
upon as being a happy augury for the
young sovereign.
The procession was headed by the
king-at-arms, with the heralds in their
gorgeous antique costumes and bearing
long trumpets, adorned with pendant
flags. But all the splendor of the royal
retinue was overlooked by the vast
crowds of people, whose eyes were
turned upon the central figure of, this
imposing procession â the young Queen
on foot amid the people, decked with
all the emblems of royalty. On her
head was a diadem of diamonds, crown
shaped. Her robe was of white silk,
with a long train, under a mantle of
rich red velvet, on which the Lions of
Nassau Vfere "displayed in gold em
broidery. The mantle was bordered
with ermine.
The sword of state was carried be
fore the young Queen by a general.
Her Majesty carried herself with
grace and fortitude, but her blanched
cheeks were evidence of the profound
emotion inspired by the greatness of
th*Â» rccaston. The jewels worn by the
young Queen were part of those .stolen
In Brussels September 9, 1829. Some cf
thun were recovered by the police cf
New York a year later through infor
mation which a Frenchman named
Roumage gave to the Dutch Minister
at Washington.
It is impossible to accurately de
scribe the acclamations which greeted
the Queen. The roays of loyal cheers
grew louder and more sustained as her
Majesty proceeded to the church,
which, in the meanwhile, had been
filled with brilliantly robed ladies and
uniformed civil and military authori
ties, naval officers and members of the
diplomatic corps. The interior of the
church disclosed a magnificent wealth
of drapery, banners, palms and flow
ers.
As the procession of the Queen-
Mother entered the church the assem
bly arose and remained standing. The
Queen-Mother wore a low-necked dress
of light mauve color, trimmed with
lace and covered with pearls. On he
head was a splendid tiara and on her
breast were displayed the insignia of
the Dutch orders. The maids of honor
and the ladies in waiting were dressed
in beautiful costumes, blazing with
diamonds. Then followed the Queen-
Mother, who took up a position on the
left of the throne, but who remained
standing until the arrival of her daugh
ter, the sovereign.
Suddenly the kin^-at-arms, from the
portal of the church, heralded the ar
rival of Queen "Wilhelmina, who en
tered the building escorted by a train
of generals, each bearing an emblaz
oned banner.
The choir, which included the great
est artists of Holland, sang "Wilho.lmus
Van Natc-auwe."
The Queen, looking very wf'll in her
robes of state, bowed from side to
side as she passed on to the throne,
and reaching it she turned and again
bowed and took her seat. A moment
later her Majesty arose and in a clear
and perfectly calm voice spoke as fol
lows:
Gentlemen of the States General: Since
the death of my ever lamented father,
and until I have completed my eighteenth
year, the government has been In the
hands of my mother. I have now as
sumed the government, and I have is
sued a proclamation to my well-beloved
people.
The hour has now arrived when, amid
the faithful states general, and invocat
ing the holy name of God, I shall pledge
myself to the people of the Netherlands
to maintain their rights and privileges.
On this date I draw more closely the sol
emn tie existing between myself and my
people. The very ancient union of the
Netherlands and of the House of Orange
is confirmed afresh. Beautiful is my vo
cation; beautiful is my task. I am happy
anrt grateful to be able to govern the
Netherlands people, a nation small in
numbers but great in virtue of its
strength of character. I esteem it a privi
lege and a pleasing duty to devote all my
strength to the prosperity and welfare of
ASVEBTISEMENTS.
Nervous People
Are great sufferers and they deserve
sympathy rather than censure. Their
blood is poor and thin and their nerves
are consequently weak. Such people
find relief and cure in Hood's Sarsa-
parilla because It purifies and enriches
the blood and gives it power to feed,
strengthen and sustain the nerves. If
you are nervous and cannot sleep, take
Hood's Sarsaparilla and realize its
nerve strengthening power.

our Fatherland. The House of Orange
can never, nay, never, do enough for the
Netherlands. 1 need your support and co
operation, and i am convinced you will
lend me these in order that we may be
able to work together for the honor and
prosperity of our Netherlands people.
May this be the aim of our life, and may
God bless your and my labors for the sal
vation of the Fatherland.
Later in the day the Queen drove
around the city and viewed the dec
orations. The carriage was drawn by
six horses and was attended by a guard
of honor.

Jud^e Oster Renders a Decision in
the Famous Water Injunc

City Enjoined From Seizing the Plant and the
Company Cannot Collect Ratesâ Receiver
to Be Appointed,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 6.â Judge
Frank F. Oster of San Bernardino to
' day handed down a decision in the in
junction suits of the Los Angeles City
Water Company and the Crystal
Springs Land and Water Company
versus the city of Los Angeles and
others, defendants, and the city of Los
Angeles versus Los Angeles City Water
Company.
The decision Is virtually a victory
for the city, as it decides that the
agreement entered into in 1868 Is a
lease in so far as the waters of the Los
Angeles River are devised for a term
of years by the city to the Los Angeles
City Water Company, and that said
lease has expired. The city is entitled
under Judge Outer's opinion to the pos
session of the waters of the Los Ange
les River and leaves the water com
pany in possession of the pipe lines and
reservoir. Co: tinuing the opinion re

. SAN JOSE, Sept. 6.â Santa Clara '
County Republicans are dissatisfied
â¢with the make-up of the County Cen
tral Committtee, and there is a uni
versal sentiment spreading among the
members of the party that the commit
tee should be removed. It is composed
chiefly of Boss Rea and his lieutenants
and office-holders. The neople have no
faith in its alleged devotion to the Re
publican party, and even some' of the
nominees on the county ticket are
afraid the committee will sell them out
to secure the election of gang Demo
. crats. An instance of this kind will be
Been in Rea's fight to elect Bollinger for
Sheriff. It ia a foregone conclusion
Bollinger would be nominated by the
Democrats for Sheriff, and ,in order to
make his election sure Rea had the
Republicans nominate R. J. Langford.
The gang never had any intention of
working for Langford, and he was
' nominated merely to be "knifed" for
Bollinger.
The County Central Committee is the
â¢ came as last year, and at the county
convention was re-elected for two
years. They do not work for party in
terests, but to help Boss Rea and them
eelves individually. With the cam
paign in their hands this fall the Re
publican party is likely to lose Santa
' Clara County. The people hay* be
â¢ come familiar with the disreputable
methods of this crowd, and their names
In connection with the ticket will drive
many away.
The State Central Committee, whose
powers have been extended, should, It
Is claimed, step in and Interfere in the
Interests of the party in the State. The
County Central Committee was re
elected by a convention whose mem
bers were elected by the grossest of
â¢frauds. The members of it were active
in the gang tactics practiced at the
primaries to defeat the wish of the de
rent and respectable classes, ana the
committee, it is urged, should not
therefore be recognized by the State
Committee.
Jhe following are names of the com
rhitteemen and shows the hold "Jim
Rea has on them:
.. L. A Sage, the chairman, js^ thor
oughly gang, and is swayed by the
M!nht'<-pt ',v!?h of Rea.
John D. Mackenzie is secretary. He
Is Rea's most trusted lieutenant, -and
has engineered the dirty work for the
boss for years. Ho fills the position of
game warden and has aspirations to be
the next postmaster of this city.
James w. Rea, the pollticalboss.
Samuel Rea, uncle of the boss.
Arthur McClay, cousin of Boss Rea.
Dr. H. C. Brown, physician at County
Infirmary, which is under the boss'
thumb.
J. F. O'Keefe, superintendent of Oak
Hill Cemetery, an ex-school trustee,
proud of his Rang collar.
I,yman Bare, whom Rr>a wanted to
make Senator from the Thirteenth Dis
trict.
Frank Covey of Palo Alto, who does
the srang's bidding in the northern end
1 if the county.
F. L. Cottle.
E. E. f'hase.
â¢T. P.. Peppin, ex-candidate for Super
visor.
W. D. Decker, who was mnde a col
lector for the Board of Trade by the
gang.
Thc-re is one vacancy on the commit
tee, created by the resignation of Jus
tice "W. J. Kirkpatrick. The latter 1r
also a devout attendant upon the buss
and was assistant secretary of the com
mit ten.
Fmm this list it will bo seen that the
.pnrty is completely in the hands of
â¢ Rea. The entire committee is owned
by him, and should the boss take a dis
like to any of the candidates he has
only to say the word and the commit
tee will "crucify" him. This guerrilla
mode of warfare of the gang is killing
! would be of no use to the city of Los
Angeles without the distributing system,
and in like manner the public could de
rive no benefit from the pipe lines and
reservoirs if the water were to be with
held. It follows, therefore, that the pub
j lie necessity requires that the water and
i distributing system shall. In any event, be
| operated and controlled together.
It Is urged that the only equitable and
- satisfactory solution of the complicated
situation lies in the appointment of a
receiver to operate both water supply and
distributing system In conformity with
the public requirements and collect all
: water rates and charges for service con-
I nectlons under the orders of the court, to
|be distributed as the court shall ultl
| mately determine.
Briefly the city of L.os Angeles is en
j joined from seizing the distributing sys
1 tern of the water company and from in
terfering with the management and con
i trol of said property or the collection of
j water rates ana revenues derived there
from, and the water company is enjoined
from collecting water rates. A receiver
i will be appotnted to receive and collect
: the water rates and to hold the moneys
! so collected subject to the further orders
i of the court in the premises.
The appropriate orders will be made ac
1 cordlngly.
the Republican party in Santa Clara
County. This Is proven by the whole
sale withdrawal of members and the
organization of the Good Government
League, with 1600 members, who will
not vote for any one with a taint of
Realsm. The members of the party are
beginning to realize something must be
done to keep Santa Clara County in line
for Gage and to Insure the election of
the legislative ticket, and in all likeli
hood the matter will be laid before the
State Central Committeee.

of the Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 6.â The galloping
brigade had an Inning at Agricultural
Park this afternoon, and there cannot
now be any doubt that the heart of the
race-going public goe: out to the thor
oughbreds. The increased attendance on
the days the runners hold sway demon
strates that, and to-day was no excep
tion.
Everything went off like clockwork.
There was little or no delay at the post,
and Starter Havey sent his fields on their
Journeys so closely aligned as to elicit
words of praise from all sides. The starts
were made by means of an Indian rubber
band stretched across the. track, a simple
contrivance which several California rac
ing men were much taken with and which
is used successfully by several starters
on tracks east of the Rockies. Certainly
It worked marvelously well to-day.
One lonely favorite was all that caught
the judges' eyes at the finish In six races,
and when Ko Ko. trained by "Hanger"
Jones, won the last race at odds of 40 to 1,
the agony of the form students can better
be Imagined than described. The lone
favorite to finish In front was Modwena,
owned by Rlenzl Hughes of San Francis
co. San Mateo was a strong second
choice In the first event, and Sport Mc-
Allister was second In demand in the
third. However, the favorite that was
beaten by the Sport was 1 to 5, and he
finished third In a four-horse race. Mc-
Allister was a very tired skyrocket at the
wind up.
Little Willie Murray had a good thing
In the fourth race In Casdale, who won
from the 7 to 10 shot, Faversham, who
was never before accused of earning any
other notoriety than the ability to say
"Take it" quicker than almost any man's
colt. Morlnga won the fifth because he
was In grand racing shape and Marplot
was not. and Ko Ko took the last because
Scarborough's rider needed a tonic and
Colonel Wheeler lacked a whole lot of
being up to a bruising race.
That the track was In supÂ«rb order can
be Judged by the fact that San Mateo
ran six furlongs in 1:14 flat, and Modwena
six and a half In 1:22%.
The Judges were A. B. Spreckels, pre
siding, with J. W. Wilson and M. F. Tar
pey as associates; the timers, Directors
Frank de Long and Al Leach. Six regu
lar books and a combination book were
on and did a fine business.
The first race, six furlongs, selling,
brought eight to the starting post. Shasta
Water was a slight favorite over San
Mateo, and the rest were not wanted at
any price. To a fair send-off, made In
leas than a minute, O'Fleeta showed mo
mentarily in front: then Mollie A took the
leading position, holding it for three fur
longs. Here San Mateo, rather slow to
get going, had headed Ironwood's daugh
ter, and, going away from hla field like
a shot, was four lengths to the good
turning for home. This advantage he
maintained to the end. Major Cook look-
like second money as they straight
ened away for the run down the home
stretch, but Shasta Water came fast on
the Inside, and, heading the "Majaii"
about a sixteenth from home and hard
ridden, beat him out two lengths. Cook
was four lengths before Mollle A, the
early pace-maker. Time, 1:14.
The Sunny Slope stakes, for two-year
old fillies, brought a quartet of very pret
ty misses to the post. Modwena was al
ways favorite, and the coin of her admir
ers forced her price from 3 to 2 to 4 to
5 by post time. Magdaienas was in some
demand at 11 to 5, but Midlove (half sis
ter to Liovdale) was supported a little at
RACE ARRANGED FOR
THE AMERICA'S CUP
Representatives of the Royal Ulster and
New York Yacht Clubs Confer and
Agree Upon Terms.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â At a conference between the challenge
committee of the Royal Ulster Yacht Club and the cup committee of
the New York Yacht Club to-day, the Sandy Hook course was agreed
upon.
The conditions agreed upon provide that the match shall be de
cided by the best three out of five races over courses that shall be,
as nearly as possible, thirty nautical miles in length, starting from
Sandy Hook lightship. The first, third and fifth races shall be to
windward or leeward and return, while the second and fourth races
shall be over an equilateral triangle.
The challenger, it is agreed, shall be informed at least one week be
fore the first race what vessel is to defend the cup. The racing rules
of the New York Yacht Club shall govern the races.
The first race, it was decided, shall be sailed or. Tuesday, October 3,
1899, unless the Shamrock should be detained by stress of weather
or other causes, in which case three weeks shall be given her for fit
ting out after her arrival, but the first race shall not be started later
than October 10. The races shall be sailed on Tuesdays and Saturdays
until completed.
3 to 1. Starter Havey got them away
nicely bunched, but Modwena was on her
stride best and soon opened a gap of a
couple of lengths on Magdalenas. The
latter however, had her old-time burst
of speed with her, and as they passed the
half-mile mark Morello's daughter had
but a half a length the best of it. Gouln,
on Magdalenas, went to the bat as soon
as they straightened away in the home
stretch, and naturally his mount quit,
even losing the place. Modwena went on
and won by two and a half lengths, with
Joe Plggott sitting still, while Midlove,
game as the proverbial pebble, was a
neck in front of Magdalenas at the finish
ing time Crossmelina was a poor last.
Time, 1:02. , .
The third event, a selling race of six
and a half furlongs, had four contest
ants. Harry Thoburn was for some rea
son thought to be a "moral, 1 to 5 be
ing his price, and 4 to 1 Sport McAllis
ter. Venis was at 2 to 1, and Flirtilla,
who had not been out in about two years,
2 to 1. They got a fair start, Sport Mc-
Allister being a little in iront with the
favorite next. Flirtilla dropped out of it
quickly and Venis went up close to Sport
nearing the half pole, Thoburn on the rail
falling back over a length. McAllister
was leader by a half length as they made
the final turn, and Venis was uiree
lengths in front of the supposed P>per
ina." Thoburn got the gaff and the whip
in allopathic doses coming down the home
stretch while Oouin forgot his whip this
time and rode Sport with his hands, land-
Ing him a winner with all sails set by
two lengths. The despised \ enis was
second, two lengths from the false alarm,
Harry Thoburn, and Flirtilla was an
awful last. Time. 1:22^. There was a
hush in the bookmakers r camp and jubi
lation among the four hundred or so
knowing ones as McAllister came back to
the winner's ring.
A selling race for two-year-olds, fourth
on the programme, had a quartet of
starters. Faversham was made a 7 to 10
favorite, Casdale going at 6 to 5, Napian
9 to 2 and Gilt Edge 20 to 1. To a fair
sort of start Faversham shot to the front,
leading by two lengths the first eighth.
Then Casdale began to catch the black
favorite, who led past the half pole by
less than a length, Napian two and a
half lengths away. Casdale passed Fa
versham on the tinal turn and led in the
homestretch by a half length, the choice
of the talent four lengths froni Nap an.
Casdale's rider pulled over to the rail in
front of Faversham, but was clear when
he did it, and going on won with ease by
a half length. Faversham was second,
two lengths before Napian, who beat
Gilt Edge eight lengths. Time. I:l6V*.
The first half was run in :49Vi-
The fifth race the Dewey selling stake,
six furlongs, brought six to the post. Ar
baces, brother to Diggs, was a seething
favorite, backed down from 7 to 5 to 7 to
10. Marplot was at 9to 6. Moringa 2to
1, Hlmera 20 to 1, Losette 15 and El Moro
26 to 1. They were off to a first-class
start, but Marplot, on his etrfcle best, took
a slight lead in the first furlong. He
passed the half pole a head in front of
Arbaces, on whom Moringa was lapped;
the others bunched prettily. Marplot led
by a half length at the three-quarters
and Arbaces was clogging it badly, Mo
ringa going up second. Half way down
the home stretch Moringa said "good-by"
to Marplot and won all out by about
three lengths, Marplot second, a length
before Himera, who finished very strong.
Arbaces was a bad fourth. Time, 1:14%.
The concluding race, seven and a half
furlongs, had seven starters. There was
a delay of ten mlntes, and finally they
were dispatched to a fair start. Man
zanllla was interfered with. Colonel
Wheeler assumed the lead and kept it for
five furlongs, when Scarborough got up
and led Wheeler by half a length In the
home stretch, Ko Ko less than a length
away, on the outside. Bozeman put up
a weak finish on Scarborough and Ko Ko
fot up and won cleverly by a length,
en Thorough second, with Colonel
Wheeler at his saddle. Tenrlca was a
poor fourth. Manzanilla ran a good race
after having been interfered with. The
time was 1:37.

WHARTON BARKER
FOR PRESIDENT
CINCINNATI, Sept. 6.â The middle
of-the-road Populists to-day reorgan
ized the People's party, renewed its
former declaration of principles and
nominated its National ticket two years
and two months in advance of the date
of the election. The object of this early
action was to head off any such fusion
as that of 1896.
When the session opened. Chairman
Ignatius Donnelly made another radi
cal speech denouncing all those who
had co-operated with fusion move
ments and strongly advocating 1 the re
organization of the party not only for
an independent Presidentall ticket but
for independent candidates for Con
gress, State officers, etc.
A letter from ex-Governor Davis
"Waite of Colorado was read, in which
he denounced Senator Butler as a
treacherous chairman and false leader
and advocated the nomination of
straight Populistlc tickets for President
and other offices.
An elaborate address to the people of
the United States was made. It reaf
firms the previous platform of the Pop
ulists and covers many additional ques
tions, and In referring to the present
situation it says:
The People's party vote in 1594 and 1895
rose to nearly two millions, and every
thing indicated its speedy national tri
umph. In this emergency the Democratic
party saw that it had no recourse but to
steal one of the principles of the despised
Populists. In the Chicago convention of
1890. in a prearranged theatrical scene of
great uproar and enthusiasm, it moved to
the front as the devoted friend and long
champion of that which it has always
opposed.
Senator Butler, who is the chairman of
our national committee, preached disin
tegration and demoralization Just as
Benedict Arnold stipulated for the scat
tering of the American forces, that the
British might more readily overthrow the
young republic.
Mr. Butler taught our forces that the
first duty of a soldier was to break ranks
and go over to the enemy. All efforts to
chain the boundless subtlety of this cun
ning man have been in vain.
A bitter discussion then followed on
a motion to proceed with nominations
for President and Vice President. The
Butler men were knocked out. Joseph
Palmer of Illinois then called the But
ler faction together in another part of
the hall and it was announced that
they would bolt and leave the hall If
the motion to proceed with nominations
prevailed. They insisted that such ac
tion should not be taken, as there had
been no regular call and only a portion
of the States and Territories were rep
resented. There was a scene of con
fusion and commotion. The disturbance
at the small crowd became so fierce
that Hasebett, manager of the Ly
ceum, appeared and requested the as
semblage to vacate the hall, as he was
apprehensive of the security of his
property. The Butler faction, led by
Palmer of Illinois, then left the hall
and the other faction proceeded with
the nominations. After numerous
nominating and seconding speeches in
presenting two names for Presidential
candidates a ballot was taken, result
ing as follows:
Wharton Barker of Pennsylvania,
128 4-5; Ignatius Donnelly of Minne
sota, 99 1-5. On motion of Donnelly the
nomination of Barker was made unani
mous. Ignatius Donnelly was then
nominated by acclamation for Vice
President.
A very long platform was adopted,
which incorporates the provisions of
the Omaha platform as well as the ad
dress adopted at the morning session.
Those who followed Palmer of Illi
nois out of the convention afterward
held a conference and drafted an ad
dress denouncing the action of the con
vention.

BY PRIVATE F. A. HEALY.
CAMP DEWEY, Aug. I.â The hour
was late. It needed but fifteen min
utes to commence a new day, a new
month was only a quarter of an hour
distant, and the sentry standing amid
the dripping foliage that skirts our
camp knew all these things, but that a
new epoch In the history of the Philip
pines had already been ushered in he
was not aware. The firing which had
been going on at the trenches ever
since half-past 10 he took to be the
regular nightly serenade to which we
have been treated since we took up our
present position, and that the sound
which came floating across the open
fields which stretch their muddy length
for two miles between the camp and
the trenches had been growing steadily
in volume he merely ascribed to the
fact that Spain was wasting more am
munition than usual in her futile en
deavor to pot a shy Filipino or a
casual American.
The weather could not have been
â worse. The nights here are ordinarily
cool, though the days are hot enough
to make a traveler from Africa long for
his native temprature to cool off in.
But the night of July 31 was more than
cool. It was cold, and to the blood of
the sentry, thinned by a two months'
campaign in the tropics, it seemed icy.
A heavy, co-Id rain was failing, or was
rather being driven along the ground
by a gale which almost rose in its
power to the dignity of a hurricane.
The fields were wet in every part and
submerged altogether in most places.
The roads had lost their thorcmghfare
character altogether and. had practi
cally become large ditches, filled waist
deep with soft liquid mud. Yes, the
night could not have been worse. Grad
ually the hours moved around toward
midnight, and the rain and wind slow
ly subsided enough to allow the firing
to become more plainly heard. It had
continued to increase as the elements
decreased until it reached a pitch fear
ful enough to disturb many a sleeping
soldier, and cause him to sit up. rub his
eyes and wonder what w r as the occa
sion of all the row. He was soon to
find out. For hardly had he turned
himself again to his pillow when shrill
and clear, on the cool night air, rang
out a bugle calling the entire camp to
arms. As though spurred on by the
sound, the firing in front answered the
stirring noise with crash upon crash,
while the thunder of the cannon re
doubled the mingling of sounds form
ing an awful symphony that seemed to
shake the very heavens under whose
black canopy the half-wakened sol
diery were already arming and forming
for battle. A cheer went up from the
Colorado boys, whose camp is just in
our rear. It was taken up and an
swered by the lads from San Francisco,
and before It had ceased we were
formed and marching on the double
quick to the front.
There was no sick man, no tired man,
no straggling stay-behind in the Cali
fornia Volunteers after the call to arms
had sounded.
Just as we started the storm, which
had quieted down for a few minutes, !
recommenced with redoubled violence.
The rain came slanting across the lines
in living sheets of water, which was
driven into the backs and whipped the
sides of the faces of the advancing
troops until they fairly tingled with
pain.
The First Battalion went first, the
Second Battalion came second, acting
as support, followed by a reserve com
posed of the Third Battalion. The rest
of the troops comprising the main body
remained drawn under arms in camp.
As we started forward news of o-ur
mission began to drift along the line
and we knew what we were out for.
The trenches had been attacked by a
large force of the enemy. The Pennsyl
vania troops and Batteries A and B of
the Utah Artillery, stationed in them,
were being hard pressed, and we were
going forward to their assistance.
To make the matter a little more
clear. I will try to explain how we were
situated. Our camp is placed in an
open field, running from north to south,
in an oblong shape, and about 100 yards
from the beach. From the camp to the
Spanish lines the distance is about two
miles and a half, while the city of Ma
nila is still about a mile am', a half fur
ther north. We have thrown up a line
of intrenchments about two miles from
our camp, which commence on the
beach and run inland in a crescent
shaped formation toward the Passig
River, with their convex side toward
the Spanish lines, which run in a nearly i
parallel course about half a mile away.
The country between these two lines of
trenches is thickly covered with brush
and bamboo timber for the most part,
though here and there large bare tracts
of swamp land and corn patches allow
the Spanish earthworks to be seen.
As we moved out from the line of
trees on the north side of our camp
the noise of battle became more and
more distinct. On we '.went, flounder
ing knee deep In the mild and water,
halting occasionally for a minute or
two to dress our ranks and perfect our
formation. Each fellow carried a hun
dred extra rounds of ammunition in !
hie haversack slung by a strap over his
right shoulder, and as we stumbled
nionp in the wet and darkness the I
strap would sink into our flesh and ,
chafe until the skin wore through. :
But no one murmured. The boys were
jroine: forward to battle and they were
satisfied.
As we emer""Â«d from the confines of
our camp we passed Colonel Smith and
his staff moving forward Id the same
direction. Amid the Rroup of officers I
saw Sol Sheridan movinchurriedlv for.

ward toward the firing line, and he
was the only special correspondent I
did see actually on the field during the
engagement.
On We moved until we had crossed
the first naddy field to the north of our
camp where we halted our battalion
(the Second), while the First continued
to move rapidly forward to the help of
the boys in the trenches. They ar
rived there just in the nick of time, for
as they stumbled in with a cheer and
took their places, they found the Penn
sylvania boys with fixed bayonets
awaiting a hand to hand conflict with
the Spanish, who were advancing to
the charge and only fifty yards dis
tant. The reinforcements and the fire
poured into the Spanish ranks by the
new comers proved too much for the
Dons, who broke and fled. Though they
made several subseqent advances they
never got as near again. The critical
moment had arrived with the presence
of the California boys, and with their
appearance all horÂ»Â« nf Spanish victory
fled. It was here that gallant Richter,
the warm-hearted and chivalrous cap
tain of Company I, received/his death
wound while leading his command to
the succor of their comrades.
Prom the moment of the departure
of the First Battalion the battle from
the standpoint of a private in the ranks
becomes, as far as I am concerned, a
history of the Second Battalion We
knew that the Third Regular Heavy
Artillery and our First Battalion had
entered the trenches; we knew that
they together with the Quakers and
Mormons were fightintr like time; we
knew that some one was going to get
hurt, but that was all the positive
knowledge we had. The night was dark
as pitch and the inky blackness was so
increased and intensified by the torrents
of falling rain that it was all a felllow
could do to distinguish a comnanion in
his own company at a distance of thir
ty feet.
â¦Â», 25i ew nearer t0 the firing line
the evidences of battle became more
and more apparent. Staff officers aids
and orderlies would flounder up to us
out of the rain and darkness, covered
with mud and slush, ask some ques
tion, inquire the position of some body
of troops or deliver some order and dis
appear again in the gloom as hurried
ly as they had come. Stragglers from
some of the other regiments, who had
lost their way in the darkness, would
run into us and. learning the position
of their commands, hurry off to join
them, or would come along with us
Hospital men, bearing instruments lit
ters and bandages, would flit across
the line of our advance like misty
ghosts of the night and their presence
was a true harbinger of what we were
to expect when we should come Into the
zone of fire.
That questionably pleasant place was
but a short distance farther on and as
we stepped into the line of trees 'di
viding the first paddy field, from' the
second the sharp ping of the first
Mauser bullet was heard as it merrily
whistled on its deadly mission over our
heads. Quickly following the flight of
this first hostile messenger, so quickly
that thought can hardly work fast
enough to compute the time, the air
seemed to have become animated with
thousands upon thousands of uncanny

In the Action Before Manila July 31.
TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1898.
things that shrieked, whistled,
hummed, rattled and sang through the
air, clipping the boughs from the trees
and sending twigs and leaves whirl
ing around like sands in a desert ty
phoon. Bullets seemed to be every
where; they sped over us, around us
and between us.
Did the boys duck? I did not see
any one doing so. It was too dark
and my time was taken up about the
limit in steadying a fellow by the
name of Healy, in whom I take con
siderable of an interest. I had no
time to look for men ducking. What
I do know, however, is that no man
hesitated, no man faltered, no man
turned backward; all advanced as
steadily as at a Presidio parade. Our
captain (who, by the way, has proved
himself a splendid officer and game to
the core), Eggett, of L Company, had
no need to cry "Steady!" His com
mands rang out clear and cool, as when
he marched us down Market street.
They were repeated with equal cool
ness by Lieutenants Curzons and Ad
ler, and were obeyed with promptness
and exactness by the men, which, con
sidering the weather, the darkness of
the night and the fact that we were
undergoing our baptism of fire, was
little short of marvelous.
As with the commissioned officers, so
with the "non-coms." Grundman. our
first sergeant, seemed to be more con
cerned in seeing his tobacco become a
pulp than in the whistling bullets. I
actually heard Sergeant Leary trying
to tell a funny story amid all the din,
and if the laughter with which his
brother sergeants (Lauber and Left
man), greeted it was not as hearty as
might have been, I am sure it was not
because it was Leary's story and not
on account of their surroundings. Both
they and the corporals were as cool
and as game as veterans of the thirty
years' war. And the men! Well, they
were all right from great big Clancy
on our right down to little Collins on
our left, who when a bullet passed
through his haversack wanted to
know what the Spaniards were doing
that for. Lieutenant Curzons had a
bullet pass so close to his ear that he
claimed that that member was red hot.
Private Joe Donnelly stepped up to
feel, when one 'of the buttons was
chipped from his blouse. Mr. Donnelly
promptly returned to his place in the
ranks. Rut despite these incidents,
and despite the rain of lead and steel
we continued to advance.
As we entered a narrow strip of tim
ber separating the third paddy fiold
from the Pasay road, which field is the
last piece of cultivated ground before
the trenches are reached, a shell tore
through the brush, cut a tree seven
inches in diameter completely in two,
and lit in the earth at the very feet
of our fourth squad. Luckily it did
not explode or none of that squad or
the ones on either side of It would have
answered roll call again before the day
they line up for general muster and
final Judgment on the last day of all.
At the Pasay road, another ditch
crossing our line of advance, we took
up our final position and lay in the
mud and water on our faces all
through the terrible night with the
rain beating upon us, the wind seeking
out our very marrow and causing- it to
freeze in our very bones, while bullet,
shell and solid shot tore through our
ranks and over our heads.
At about 7 o'clock in the morning, the
Spanish advance having been checked
and their forces repulsed, we returned
to camp cold, hungry and worn out,
but victorious and happy. I, M, E and
A Companies of the First Battalion be
haved like heroes. And to the ad
vance of the First California Volun
teers the ultimate victory must be as
cribed. Our colonel, lieutenant colonel,
chaplain and field and line officers be
haved nobly and are a body of com
manders of whom any body of troops
may be proud. Of our hospital corps
1 1 cannot speak too highly. They took
ever> r risk with the utmost intrepidity
j and performed every office with a cool,
ness and courage that commands the
highest admiration. The American
loss was eleven killed and about forty,
J six wounded. The Spanish loss in
i killed and wounded was near 1200.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY PRIVATE F. A. HEALY.
CAMP DEWEY, July 31.â Again I
will attempt to chronicle the daily life
and daily achievements of the Cali
fornia Volunteers. Possibly there are
those among the many thousands who
read these articles in The Call who
wonder why I do not say more concern
ing the plans and actions of the army
as a whole and give to the people at
home the news of what Is going on
throughout this whole vast assemblage
of seamen and soldiers. To such I wish
to say that in the first place I am
merely one of the many simple privates
in the ranks and, as such, have but
little opportunity to gain a knowledge
of anything which does not cencern my
Immediate regiment, and secondly there
are men who are far more capable then
I who are continually watching and
who will give to the public the results
of their vigilance as soon as something
worthy of notice takes place.
In the beginning of this article I
used the words "'daily achievements of
the California Volunteers," and I used
them advisedly. When I was a small
boy my estimation of a man'B soldierly
qualities was measured by the number
of active engagements he had partici
pated in and his glory was Increased
or diminished in my eyes in proportion
to the number of wounds he had re
ceived.
My ideas since the days of my ado
lescence have undergone considerable
of a change. The whole life of a soldier
In active service is a sacrifice calling
for the most profound gratitude and
warmest admiration from those whom
he goes forth to defend, and when that
sacrifice is cheerfully made and the du
ties it entails are willingly, conscien-
tiously and uncomplainingly performed
every one of them, even to the most
menial and trivial, rises to the dignity
of an achievement.
And thus it is with the boys sent out
from San Francisco. From day to day,
from week to week, they have suffered
all the hardships of campaigning and
performed all the weary, heart-break
ing drudgery of camp life. From time
to time there have arisen rumors,
emanating from the Lord knows where,
which promised of battle in the near
future, which, while it would probably
bring death to many, would surely bring
glory and distinction to some. These
rumors would for a short time brighten
things up ami eyes would flash and
chests heave with excitement at the
prospect of an early fulfillment of the
wish that brought nine-tenths of the
entire regiment across 7000 miles of
trackless ocean to pass two years of
exile in a foreign and hostile land. But
it would only last for a short time â
this brightness of expectancyâ the ru
mor would be discredited and all hands
would return to the dreary old routine
with the prospect of a fight just as far
distant as ever.
However, at last there came a
change. One fine day the Newport,
with the commanding general on
board, steamed Into the harbor and at
once things commenced to take on a
different aspect, assuming more the na
ture of active hostilities, and hope con
sumed in the wasting flre of disap
pointment, like the fabled phenix,
arose again from its own ashes. The
insurgents no longer had things all to
themselves. Outposts taken from the
different regiments in proper rotation,
one battalion at a time, were establish
ed well within the firing line, the boys
taking provisions with them, and re
maining on duty twenty-four hours
before being relieved. That the duty
is not without its attending danger was
demonstrated on the first day when
one of the boys from the Colorado reg
iment was hit in the leg and painfully
wounded by a spent bullet from the
Spanish intrenchments. What his name
is or to which company he belongs lam
unable to say. Large details of men
have been sent out to repair the roads
which have become almost impassable
from mud, and already two guns of the
Utah Battery ' have moved forward
over them and taken up their position
at the extreme front.
On July 28 a detachment of regulars
was sent up to run a line of trenches
parallel to. the Spanish works and
slightly in advance of those occupied
by the insurgents. They were protected
by sharpshooters selected from men
having records for fine marksman
ship at home. These sharpshooters, se
creting themselves amid the thick
underbrush, crept up close to the Span
ish lines, shootiner with deadly ac
curacy at everything that showed it
self above the enemy's line of breast
works.
At first the Spanish did not seem to
realize that anything unusual was go-
Ing on, but they were soon convinced
by their unusual losses that the new
foe they had become accustomed to at a
dlÃtance was beginning to make himself
felt, and after a f~w ineffectual volleys
they contented themselves with keep
ing well out of sight, only firing a shot
now and again when the quiet along
the American lines pave them sufficient
assurance to poke the barrel of a rifle
over their trenches.
In this manner have actual, active
hostilities on land at last commenced
with a loss to the Americans of two
men wounded, one regular being shot
through the arm, as well as the Colo
rado soldier who was hit in the leg.
What the Spanish loss thus far is I
am unable to say. but it must be con
siderable, as our men shoot with the
same calmness they would exhibit at
the butts, and nearly every time they
shoot the object of their fire Is seen to
stagger and fall.

and "tends" her father's shop in all
gravity and decorum. She is a fair
sample of the ordinary common people
of this island. The children are nearly
always pretty, and their great black
eyes glow with intelligence and later
with cunning, for as your Filipino
ripens in years contact . with Spanish
treachery and Spanish, uncleanliness
and bad morality bears its fruit,
Joseppa is young yet. She is but
seven years of age, and it ia amusing
to see a group of American officers
learning wisdom and incidentally
Tagallo and Spanish i* her knee. She
has also taught us a game called
"Picino," a species of solitaire played
with sea shells. When the officers call
to See her she is generally "top side"
the house finishing her siesta but as
the father or mother call that the '"of-
ficiales" are coming, down comes Jo
seppa's bare feet and legs on the nar
row ladder and finally the graceful lit
tle thing herself. Then she rubs her
eyes and glances abo~* with a "Buenos
dios!" Indeed, it is a very sleepy
"Buenos dios," but she soon brightens "
up and she carefully makes a mental
calculation of her "Americano"
friends, and if any be absent you may
be sure she will call for the one by
name; sometimes the name gets a cu
rious twist, as, for instance, Captain
Heath's. This she calls "el Capltan.
Heetch." The shop is dingy, the winÂ«
bottles have dirty labels, the table is
rough hewn and grimy, the chairs have
broken legs and an ill smell
pervades the atmosphere, but to some
of us Joseppa is a bright spot in this
campaign.
On the Cavite Real lives a young man
with his old mother and his two littla
sisters. He is an industrious fellow,
and up to a few days ago his was tha
only jeweler and .atchmaking shop in
old Cavite. Previous to the great in
surrection of 1896 his father removed
from Manila, where he had learned his
trade, to Cavite, where he built up a
great business with the Spanish offi
cers. The father, like his son, was in
dustrious, and. though flehting against
the odds of unjust taxation, he man
aged to scrape together a neat com
petency and to givp his children some
education. The son was bred to the
father's trade. One da/ when the
Spanish patrol had been bringing in
many prisoners and when the Mau
sers were making music within the
moat of old San Phlllpi and the Fili
pinos were being shot by dozens, a vol
dier and sergeant called in the quiet
little shop and the jeweler was taken
to the fortress. He had been there be
fore on business. He made no unusual
preparation, his farewell to the wife
was a nod of the head. They brought
back his body at 8 o'clock in the even-
Ing, and the sorrowing son and widow
and the two little girls are still won
dering .why the father was done to
death, and the youn- fellow tells the
story with revengeful hate, and the day
is sure to come when that young man,
will call for life in atonement for the tf
one that was taken.

The Democratic State Central Com
mittee will meet at the California Ho
tel at 1 o'clock this afternoon for the
purpose of electing a chairman and
transacting such other business as may
be deemed advisable.
Judge Maguire held a conference i
â¢with the Gallaghers, the Manns and
the Leggetts last evening for the pur
pose of selecting a chairman for th-3 I
new committee. At the close of thÂ«
conference Judge Maguire stated that
he would not announce his choice until
he had had a consultation with C. C.
Wright and members of the Los Ange
les delegation. It may be stated, how
ever, that Seth Mann is the choice of
the Maguire-Gallaghers, and that he
will be selected as the chairman of the
new committee. Al McCabe, whose
duties as assistant secretary of the re
tiring committee, have been particu
larly valuable, will, no doubt, be select
ed as the secretary of the new commit
tee.
Judge Maguire will open his cam
paign in this city on the evening of
September 14, at Metropolitan Tem
ple. The demonstration will take the
form of a mass-meeting at which Ma
guire and other speakers will make ad
dresses. *
t'MP.gressman Maguire and his polit
ical advisers from the Clan Gallagher
awakened to the fact yesterday that
they seriously blundered when selecting
his twenty-one personal representa
tives on the State Central Committee.
They not only slighted the German
Democratic Central Club, one of the
strongest political organizations in the
city, but they added insult to injury by
choosing Dr. Max Magnus who had
been expelled from the club, as one of
the members of the State Committee.
In consequence there is weeping in the
Maguire gubernatorial camp, and
James Gallagher Maguire is at present
doing some heavy thinking in the hope
of extricating himself from a position
that will cost him hundred of votes un
less the matter is satisfactorily ad
justed.
When the German Democratic Cen
tral Club met at Pythian Castle Mon
day night the matter of the slight
shown the organization by Maguire
was taken up for consideration. Many
of the members were in anything but
a pleasant frame of mind and some fa
vored the Indorsement of the State
ticket outside of Maguire.
BÂ« veral ot the personal friends of
Maguire went to his rescue and argued
that they were satisfied that no slight
was intended, and that Maguire would
be able to prove himself innocent of
any such intention when he named
Dr. Magnus as one of his committee
men.
Alter a lengthy discussion a commit
tee was appointed to draft a set of
resolutions expressing the sentiments
of the club. Fifteen minutes later the
committee reported back as follows:
Whereas, the Democratic Central Club
of San Francisco is one of the oldest po
litical organizations and the most influ
ential among the German voters of this
city; and whereas,' the German Demo
cratic Central Club was one of the first
political organizations indorsing publicly
the candidacy of Hon. James G. Maguire
for Governor of the State of California;
and whereas, a certain Max Magnus, hav
ing been expelled from membership of
the Gorman Democratic Central Club, has
been appointed a member of the State
Central Committee in face of such expul
sion and no representation having been
given to our club in said State Central
Committee. Therefore be it
Resolved, That the members of the
German Democratic Central Club feel
themselves deeply offended and slighted,
ami be it furthermore resolved, that the
action of the candidate for Governor In
appointing an expelled member of the
club to the said State Central Committee
has dampened the ardor of its members
and has calculated to Interfere with the
club's active campaign work.
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution
be presented to. the Hon. James G. Ma
guire. DR. THIELE,
Chairman Committee on Resolutions.
There was wild scurrying among the
Magulre-Gallagherites yesterday to
have the resolution suppressed, as they
feared that if it was given publicity,
many votes would be lost.
Congressman Maguire sent word to
prominent members of the club that
he would like to meet them in -.he
evening at his office in the Mills build
ing. A delegation, consisting of Cap
tain Otto Luders, Captain Kumphof,
R. G. >$Valke. Charles Keisel. Dr.
Thielo, F. Kosbiel, F. Schilling: and Os
car Hocks met him at his office, and
for over an hour they discussed the
situation. Maguire found himself in a
most embarrassing position. He couli
not withdraw the appointment of Mag
nus without incurring his enmity and
the displeasure of Magnus* friends. On
th<> other hand, the resolutions present
ed at the German Democratic Central
Club showed that the slight would not
go unresented. After pondering over
the matter for a timeWaguire <>aid that
while he had filled all the places at his
dis-osal on the State Central Commit
tee, there remained a possibility that
porno one might decline. In that event
he promised that the Gorman Demo
cratic Central Club would have the
fillinp- of the vacancy. In addition he
promised th.it if no vacancy occurred
h" would appoint a member of the club
on his advisory committee.
The names of six prominent German
Deocrats were then presented to him
for consideration, and the delegation
withdrew. There the matter stands, at
present, and Magulre is still worrying.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 189 S.
ALL DEPENDS ON
THE GRAND JURY
Oakland Office-Seekers
in Jeopardy.
ALLEGED FRAUDS THE ISSUE
COMBINATIONS THAT M-^Y NOT
MATERIALIZE.
County Clerk Jordan Makes a State
ment and Claims That His
Enemies Are After His
Scalp.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Lept. 6.
The decision of County Clerk Jordan to
have the Grand Jury investigate the mat
ter of the blank signed certificates of reg
istration bearing his official stamp, and
which were very much in evidence at the
Congressional primary, will no doubt
I bring out much interesting testimony.
The issuance of the certificates, al
i though the basis, is really the least im
portant incident of the present scandal.
It is the effect the controversy may have
on the coming county primary that is in
teresting the politicians.
There is no doubt that the political fate
of Frank Jordan hangs to a great extent
on the outcome of the investigation. In
j the Seventh Ward there are two com
| binationsâ one embraces Frank Jordan for
County Clerk, Harry Melvin for District
Attorney, and the other Robert. Leckle for
Assessor, James Webster for County
Clerk, and Dr. Derrick for Coroner. This
ward is the strongest Hllborn ward In
Oakland, and it is the Hilborn men who
are making the campaign regarding blank
certificates against Frank Jordan. In
their efforts they are very naturally being
ably supported by the combination op
posed to that in which Mr. Jordan figures.
The Leckie combination is very confl
j dent and declares that It can carry the
I Seventh Ward by a vote of three to one.
; Frank Jordan is more than confident and
I declares that no one can touch his com
j bination in his home ward. Apart from
i these two combinations, every other can
i dldate seeking office on the county ticket
jis perforce interested. Should Jordan win
out, the various combinations he has
I made with candidates in other wards and
I townships will go through. Should Deckle
| win, the Jordan programme will be
\ broken and things will be considerably
disturbed all along the line.
As there will be only one day between
the result of the primary being known
and the opening of the county convention,
any disarrangement of the programme
would leave to the convention rather than
the candidates the task of naming the
nominees.
When the Grand Jury convened this af
ternoon many witnesses were waiting
outside, some of them to testify regard
ing the case of young Mahoney of San
Francisco, who, it Is alleged, voted an
other name at the Congressional prima
ries. Rey. Father Lane of St. Patrick's
Church, San Francisco, formerly of West
Oakland, was summoned for the purpose
of stating the age of Mahoney.
County Clerk Jordan and several oth
ers were witnesses in regard to the cer
tificate business, which had been brought
before that body by the District Attor
ney at the request of the County Clerk.
Mr. Jordan has issued the following
statement regarding his position in this
matter:
"I am now Tnore firmly convinced than
ever that there Is an organized effort on
foot to down me by the use of the worst
kind of politics. No blank certificates
have ever been Issued from my office,
either signed or unsigned, with the seal
of my office upon them. I employed dur
ing the recent registration between 200
and 300 special deputies in various parts
of the county in order to facilitate the
work and make it easier for those who
desired to register. No blank stationery
was Issued to these men, nor were they
permitted to use the seal of mv office.
The seal is firmly attached to a desk ad
joining that of the judgment clerk, in
side of the railing in the general office.
"It is used many hundred times a day
on legal documents and no one is per
mitted to use It except the regularly au
thorized clerks. It Is possible to obtain
access to the office, to take out the blank
stationery and to place the seal on It.
but only after the office is closed and
then It Is supposed to be guarded by a
special watchman.
"In order that no repetition of this out
rage shall occur at the coming county
primary, and in the interests of fair play,
I am, at my own expense, sending out
certificates of registration and transfer to
every one of the voters whose names ap
pear on the register. There are, to be
accurate. 6233 new registrations, and vot
ers thus enrolled will each receive
through the mail a certificate in full
bearing my official stamp. About 5000
voters have been transferred since the
last general election, and each voter so
transferred shall receive a certificate
through the mail."

TRACKING A
MODERN BORGIA
Continued from First Page.
The police are now making every effort
to secure proof that Mrs. Botkin bought
a handkerchief at the City of Paris prior
to the mailing of the box of poisoned
candy on August 4. It has been learned
that the accused woman visited the store
on August 3, and the cash tags of that
day show that one or more two-bit hand
kerchiefs were sold. None of the clerks
who were behind the counters that day
are able to remember to whom they made
sales, but F. A. Reynaud, a bookkeeper,
recalls having cashed a money order for
Mrs. Botkin that afternoon. Referring to
the incident last evening Mr. Reynaud
said:
"Mrs. Botkin frequently cashed money
orders at the desk and she usually came
to me for the accommodation. 1 have
gone over my books and am almost posi
tive that I cashed a postal order from
Stockton for her on that date. I pre
sume the postal authorities will be able
to trace the order. If It is found the. sig
nature of the payee and the date it was
cashed will be readily verified. Besides,
It will contain the indorsement of our
cashier. I do not know whether Mrs.
Botkin made a purchase that day. She
came personally to the desk and pre
sented the postal order. As I had cash
ed orders for her before I did not hesi
tate in giving her the amount of the
note."
Mr. Reynaud's statement adds another
theoretical link to the chain of evideÃce
against Mrs. Botkin. Her visit to the
City of Paris joined with the fact that a
handkerchief similar to the one in the
box of poisoned candy is significant, but
does not establish that she bought such
an article. Miss Alice Bolster, a clerk In
the lace department, sold a 2T)-cent hand
kerchief on August 3, but she cannot re
call the person who bought it. She does
not know Mrs. Botkin, and is unable to
say whether she has ever seen the alleged
poisoner.
In her statement to the Chief of Police
the accused woman gave a detailed ac
count of all her movements from July
27 to the day of her arrest at Stockton.
Everything she said has been investigat
ed, and a sinister series of coincidences
follows each date she gave.
She returned from Stockton on the
morning ot" Sunday, July 31. That after
noon, according to the affidavit of the
salesgirl in Haas' candy-store, a woman
of Mrs. Botkin's appearance bought a box
of chocolates and asked the clerk to leave
| space on top of the candy for a "present."
Again, according to the defendant's state
ment, she was ill at the Victoria Hotel
from the 31st of July to the 3d of August,
and did not leave her apartments. On
the 3d she made a call on a friend who
lives on Bush street. This was verified by
the police. Now, Reynaud, the book
keener at the City of Paris, says he
cashed a money order for her on the 3d
of Augustâ another fatal coincidence. On
the 4th of August the death package was
mailed, some time before 6 p. m. Mrs.
Botkin took the train for St. Helena at
3:30 that day. Truly, the woman is most
unfortunate, if she is Innocent.
THE ACCUSED WOMAN
APPEARS IN COURT
Sits Amid a Crowd of Spectators
While the Prosecution Secures
a Continuance of the Case.
The habeas corpus proceedings in the
case against Mrs. Cordelia Botkin are
again continued; this time until Tuesday
morning next at 10 o'clock, and, as be
fore, upon the request of the prosecution
and ready consent of the defense.
For the first time since her arrest Mrs.
Botkin has made her appearance in open
court and the crowd of curious Idlers who
daily line the corridors of the City Hall
have had their long wished for chance of
viewing the celebrated prisoner.
Though the presence of Mrs. Botkin In
the courtroom was not necessary to the
legal aspect of the case, it was highly
essential to the ends of the prosecution
who had their witnesses "so placed In the
courtroom that they would have the op
portunity to identify her if they could,
in fact, Mrs. Botkin's presence was in
compliance with a request from Chief
Lees, to whom it afforded an opportunity
to bring about the necessary identifica
tion without the publicity that would re
sult from an open visit to the defend
ant's cell.
Promptly at 1 o'clock Mrs. Botkin ap
peared before Judge Carroll Cook. She
was accompanied by her sister, Miss
Dora Brown, and by Attorneys McGowan
and Wheeler, with Chief Lees, Captain
Seymour and detectives Gibson and Mc-
Vev following.
Mrs. Botkin shows no bad effects from her
confinement or recent illness. In her
Jaunty tailor gown, of blue serge and hat
and plumes of a color to 'match she was
even more attractive than on the day of
her arrest.
Notwithstanding that her Intended ap
pearance in court had been kept a dead
secret there was a greater crowd to greet
her than could find seats in the court
room, and It was only after Judge Cook's
gavel had thrice announced order in the
court that the running fire of comment
was suppressed.
Scarcely had quiet oeen effected when
Assistant District Attorney Hosmer arose
and not only began proceedings but prac
tically ended them, by requesting of
Judge Cook that a continuance of one
week be granted. He backed his request
with no reason, but that was supplied by
Attorney Knight, who, in consenting for
a continuance, said:
"I presume, Mr. Hosmer, you ask for
a continuance on the ground that you are
not yet ready to lay your case before
Governor Budd. We will consent, but with
one proviso, and that is that we shall be
Informed when the requisition papers are
ready to go before the Governor."
There was a noticeable hesitation on the
part of the prosecution, but after a word
from Chief Lees the stipulation of the
defense was acceded to, and Judge Cook
ordered the continuance to Tuesday, di
recting Mrs. Botkin to appear before him
on that day.
It was further agreed between prosecu
tion and defense that the hearing of the
AN ELEVATOR FALLS THREE FLOORS
The Occupants, a Trio of Carpenters, Narrowly Escape
Death Amid Crashing Timbers and
Broken Machinery.
John Robinson, John Hansbrough, and Frerl Esker, carpenters employed
on the Kile building now in course of construction on Third street, near
"Stevenson, sustained serious Injuries late yesterday afternoon by the fall-
Ing of a temporary elevator on which they were riding.
The hoist was loaded with twenty-foot flooring, and the men were go
ing to the seventh story to unload it. When near the third floor there was
a snapping of timbers at the top of the shaft, and with a crash the ele
vator, with Its human freight and lumber, dropped to the basement. The
heavy wheel over which the steel cable moved dropped simultaneously
and just grazed young Hansbrough's head, embedding itself in the floor of
the elevator. . I
Worklngmen throughout the building dropped their work and rushed to
the aid of their fellow-workers. Officers T. C. Murphy, John Cronln, D.
Drlscoll and W. M. Eskew attended to sending the men to the Receiving
Hospital. Steps had to be hammered on to the planking leading from the
cellar to the open street, and It was with great trouble that the men were
conveyed to the waiting ambulances. Electric cars clanged their way |
through the gathering crowd, narrowly grazing those who w^re anxious to
view the injured men.
Esker and Hansbrough were removed to the Receiving Hospital, where
it was found that the former had sustained a broken leg and a contusion
of the nose. He also suffered from a chill brought on while lying on the
cold ground awaiting removal. Young Hansbrough's back was strained, and
the bones of his left foot were broken.
Robinson's injuries are not known owing to his removal to his home at
5 Ridley place. While being placed In the ambulance he complained of se
vere pains in his leg, due to the severe shock. He was also more or less
bruised about the head and body, as were his companions, through the
falling lumber.
The springing of a joist at the top of the shaft Is advanced as the
cause of the accident. The wheel upon which the cable moved was thrown
out of position and toppled down the shaft, followed by the long cable.
Harry Stoffels was in charge of the stationary engine which was used
to work the elevator, and his first knowledge cf the accident was the slack
rope that piled on him. He shut off steam and Joined his assistants In
caring for the Injured men.
According to J. W. Hansbrough, a partner to Robinson, one of the in
jured men, who were erecting the building, the elevator had been in use
since the beginning of work, three months ago. Heavy joists had been
raised to the upper stories by the elevator, and no fear was felt for its
safety. He also said the elevator made from 300 to 400 trips a day.
Its further service has been Impaired, as the lumber with which it was
loaded crashed through the floor and embedded Itself in the earth for
nearly a foot.
case before Judge Joachimsen. calendared
for 10 o'clock this morning, would also go
over for a week.
This agreement was arrived at upon the
advice of Judge Cook, who gave it as his
opinion that until Governor Budd had
either denied or granted the petition for
requisition, action in either habeas cor
pus or criminal cases would be of no ef
fect.
The scene In court occupied not over
fifteen minutes. There were no witnesses
to be examined and no questions to be
asked. The defendant took no more part
than a spectator, though she was the cen
tral figure. It was pimply the working
out of a partly prearranged plan, and at
the end trie crowd in the court room fol
lowed the defendant and her escort out
as they had followed her in, orderly yet
curiously, and with a hum of almost sup
pressed comment that was generally fa
vorable to its subject.
PREPARING A PILE
OF mFFIDAVITS
A Great Quantity of Evidence Will
Be Presented to the Governor
Requesting Extradition.
Chief Lees now expects to have the case
ready for Governor Budd's consideration
by Thursday night.
Yesterday was spent by the prosecution
as was the day before, not In a search for
fresh evidence, but in the preparation of
evidence already in hand for the extra
dition proceedings.
Affidavits are rapidly piling up on the
Chief's desk, but many more remain to
be taken, notably that of Expert Kytka,
whose comparisons and analyses of the
different handwritings will carry a great
part of the weight of the prosecution's
evidence. A good part of yesterday was
spent in the tabulating of the 100 and odd
negatives that he has prepared of the
numerous exhibits of evidence.
Mrs! Rauof was on hand again early In
the morning to add some supplementary
evidence to her affidavit of Monday.
Nearly all of the young women employed
by Haas & Co. will be called upon for
evidence whether they have any or not,
and it is evident that the prosecution will
rely rather upon the bulk of Its evidence
than upon its weight to influence Gover
nor Budd in his decision.
WAR IN CAMP OF
SILVER REPUBLICANS
Senator Teller Causes the Retirement
of Prominent Gommitteemen
in Colorado.
DENVER, Sept. 6.â Charles A. Towne,
chairman of the Sliver Republican Na
tional Committee, arrived in this city to
day. He comes for the purpose of urging
the Silver Republicans to 'stand firmly by
Senator* Teller and defeat the attempt
which, it is said, is being made by sup
porters of Senator Wolcott to prevent fu
sion of Silver Republicans with the Dem
ocrats and Populists in the coming cam
paign.
Late this afternoon Chairman Towne
removed Richard Broad from the position
of chairman of the Silver Republican
State Committee of Colorado and William
R. Freeman from the position of Secre
tary of the same committee, on the
ground of disloyalty to the Silver Repub
lican party *and the cause it stands for.
Chairman Towne appointed James H.
Blood of Denver chairman of the State
committee and W. H. Griffith secretary.
This action was taken by Chairman
Towne on representations in writing by j
Senator Teller, Congressman Shafroth
and National Committeeman Stevenson
to the effect that fraudulent contests had
been Instituted In a sufficient number of
counties so that one-half of the State
convention, to be held at Colorado
Springs on Thursday next, would be
made up of contested delegates and that
Chairman Broad and Secretary Freeman'
had joined in a conspiracy to give the
McKinley Republicans or followers of
Senator Wolcott control of the conven
tion and enable them to defeat the pro
posed fusion with Democrats and Popu
lists in the coming campaign.
The effect of Chairman Towne's action
will be \o put the friends of Senator Tel
ler In control of the convention. Chair
man Broad and Secretary Freeman dis
pute the right of Chairman Towne to re
move them and declare they will disre
gard his action.

At 11^50 a. m. a long blast will be sounded
on the whistle of the Judges' boat and the flag
G of the code hoisted at the bow as preparatory
signals. At 11:55 the preparatory flag will be
hauled down and the blue peter hoisted. At
12 noon the blue peter will be hauled down and
two whistles blown as starting signals for the
special 20-foot and yawl classes and the flag
J set as the preparatory signal for the 25-foot
class. The preparatory flag for each class will

If the judges desire to recall a yacht that
has crossed the starting line the international
code pennant will be set, and under it the
signal letters denoting the yacht. A series of
sharp whistles will be blown on the judges*
boats to call the attention of those on board
the yacht to the fact that a recall signal is
being shown.
Smaller yachts will receive from larger onea
a time allowance calculated according to the
Seawanhaka-Corlnthlan table of 1895.
Yachts will be allowed five minutes within
which to cross the starting line, and If they
cross later their time will be taken from the
last second of the flve-mlnute period.
There will be three courses: The "short,"
estimated at ten nautical miles; the "middle,"
estimated at fourteen nautical miles, and the
"special," estimated at five nautical miles. The
mosquito fleet, of 20 feet facing length and
under, will sail over the "special course," the
"short course" will be taken by yachts of the

WELLS-FARGO REFORMING.
WELLS-FARGO, an organization given some
unenviable notoriety through its evasion of
the war tax, is now carrying the daily papers
published in this city, and is paying for the necessary
revenue stamps. This is an improvement. There was
a time when the corporation declared that rather than
sustain its share of the war expenses it would decline
to carry the papers. The point of particular interest
is that the private individual has rights as indisputable
as those of a daily paper, and that anybody with a
package to send by express has only to proffer it and
demand that the company affix the stamp. There
will be no ground upon which there can be refusal.
The Wells- Fargo concern has injured itself by its
shortsightedness. Many packages which once would
have been assigned to it for transmission are now
t given to the postoffice. The mail is sure and cheap,
and in patronizing it there is no danger of meeting
an arrogant demand for a revenue stamp. While citi
zens who do not care to enter upon a controversy
may easily avoid the necessity by patronizing the
mails, there are indications that the ultimate reform
of the Wells- Fargo Express must be left to the State
Legislature. Happily this body has the power to im
pose a license based on the profits. When the Legis
lature shall have convened, and the proper committees
have been appointed, the books can be overhauled
and the license determined. It is plain that Wells-
Fargo people do not appreciate the leniency and ac
tual generosity with which they have been treated.
They have been protected, nurtured, and the first op
portunity for them to display gratitude is turned into
an occasion for robbing the public. The public re
sents this. The corporation will understand so later
when called upon to show its books and pay acord
ing to the size of the dividend.
The war tax, compared with the amount the cor
poration has lost and is destined still to lose through
this meanness, would have been a trifle not worth
considering.
CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE SONS.
THERE is about the history of California a
romance which does not mark the history of any
other State in the Union. There is in the word
itself an allurement and a charm. The title is linked
with the tale of the argonauts, the story of gold. Its
â¢very mention brings up a vision of the days when the
Pacific Cbast was weeks away from civilization, when
long trains laboriously crossed the plains, or ships
came around the Horn bringing loads of brave and
adventurous Americans ready to cast their lots in a
new and untried realm.
That the sons of these bold blazers of the trail of
fortune should have banded is not strange. They
have memories to preserve, legends to perpetuate, a
pride in the achievements of ancestry. The pioneers
were a brave lot. They faced dangers unknown.
They came to this coast eager to partake of the riches
which rumor had told them awaited, but ready for
whatever there should be for their hands to do. They
were not mere speculators, and they did not shrink
from any duty. The realm they found a wilderness
they made to blossom. They founded here a great
commonwealth. They gave to its upbuilding their
best efforts. Some of them lived to see the result.
The sons of these men this week will meet at San
Jose, and best wishes will be with them. They have
much of which to be proud. Their fathers builded
well the foundation upon which rests the secure pros
perity of to-day. Long mÂ»y the Native Sons flour
ish. The reason for their organization will not pass
when the second generation shall have given place to
the third. The native of California will always be
able through this organization to show that he ap
preciates the great State which gave him birth.
About this time there is curiosity to know whether
the ponderous Captain Barnes is going to continue
soldiering or follow the guidance of the string by
which he is attached to his old office.
Secretary Alger ought to sanction the most thor
ough investigation. At the worst it could not hurt
him more than the absence of it would.
The horrors of camp life among the soldiers seem
to have got loose just in time to be useful for cam
paign purposes.
A citizen returned from France says there is not
there much hostility toward America. Why should
there be any?
For a head which the Spanish considered worth
$25,000 cash, that of Aguinaldo seems to have very
little in it.
Dewey should be kept at Manila at least until
Aguinaldo has been tamed.
There are indications that the Czar's olive branch
was loaded.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1898.
ThjE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.
ONE of the notable features of recent po
litical history in the United States is the regu
larity with which the two great parties have
alternated in control of the House of Representatives.
The success of either party in a Presidential election
has been followed by the success of the opposition in
the Congressional elections two years later. No mat
ter how great was the majority that carried a Presi
dent into office, he has had to confront a hostile Con
gress before his term was over.
The record of these alternations is giving the fusion
leaders a great deal of satisfaction at this juncture.
With no important issue on which to make the cam
paign, with no definite policy to propose to the peo
ple on any question, and without competent states
men to direct and control the organizational^ oppo
sition to the administration this year would be for
lorn indeed if it were not for a belief that the people
are willing to make a change Simply for the sake of a
change, and that as they voted against Harrison's ad
ministration without cause in 1800 so they will vote
against that of McKinley this year.
The hope is not without a considerable basis of
reason. The oscillations in our politics have been ex
treme, and no doubt some of the causes which led to
the changes in the voting of the past exist to-day. A
large number of people vote for a President in the ex
pectation of attaining an office, or of getting some
direct personal gain, and being disappointed they be
come "soreheads." In the ensuing election these
classes either antagonize the administration or else
remain inactive during the campaign and discourage
the efforts of others. Moreover, as the party out of
power can always promise more than the party in
power has performed, it thus catches a large propor
tion of the votes of dissatisfied people. These ele
ments of opposition exist to-day as much as in the
past, and they constitute one of the dangers against
which the Republicans must be on guard in every
Congressional district.
While among Republican workers there should be
no indifference to the discontents of the'disappointed
office-seekers and rainbow-chasers who followed the
leadership of McKinley four years ago, there are
abundant reasons for believing they will be far less
numerous and less dangerous than such classes have
been in the off-year campaigns of the past. The pros
perity promised by the Republican party in 1806 has
been so splendidly fulfilled by the results of the
Dingley tariff and the maintenance of the gold stan
dard; the whole conduct of the administration has
been in every way so helpful to all sections of the
Union and all interests of industry; and the tact and
patriotism of the President himself has been so con
ciliatory to every class of people, that it is certain
the number of persons discontented with the adminis
tration is nothing like as great as that of those who,
having voted for Harrison or for Cleveland for the
Presidency, turned away two years afterward and
either voted against the President's party y did not
vote at all.
The people, in fact, are no longer in a mood for
political oscillations. Change for the sake of change
is not so attractive as it was. We have now experi
mented with a free-trade tariff and with an assort
ment of silver purchase acts, and the experiments are
sufficient for this generation. Discontented people
there are, and kickers and soreheads in every Con
gressional district, but they will not be numerous
enough to defeat administration candidates in many
places. In the meantime Republicans should resolve
ta take no chances, but carry on the canvass as vig
orously as if the foe were as dangerous as it thinks
itself.
ROUSING Th|E OLD MONOPOLY.
OF the progressive capitalists of this city who
have carried the Valley Road to success and
are now ready to provide it with connections
with the transcontinental lines it may be said they are
not only energetic themselves, but are the cause of
energy in others. Even the Southern Pacific Com
pany, which for so long a time has been averse to
railway improvements in California, has been roused
from the apathy produced by an over confidence in
the permanence of its monopoly, and is now prepar
ing to undertake the work of improving its own lines.
It is now announced that improvements will soon
be made by the Southern Pacific in the passenger
service between this city and the San Joaquin by the
Niles route. The traveling public has long asked for
a better service over that line, but the asking has
been hitherto in vain. The company, it was said, could
not afford it, and the officials were certain the de
sired improvements would not pay. A change has
now come over the counsels of the old monopoly.
The company perceives that when the Valley Road
completes its rapidly progressing line from Stockton
to Point Richmond the old service by Niles will not
pay and that a better one must be provided or the
line will have hardly any patronage at all.
This result of the enterprise of the projectors of
the Valley Road is not surprising. It was foreseen
from the start that the new road would rouse the
Southern Pacific and cause it also to enter vigorously
upon the task of improving and extending the trans
portation system of the State. The first gain was the
reduction in freight rates through the San Joaquin
caused by the competition, and now comes the im
provement affecting the section through which the
Niles route runs.
The benefits to be derived from the renewed ac
tivities of the old monopoly will not end with these.
The opening of a line connecting the Valley Road
with the lines in the southern part of the State will
compel the Southern Pacific to fulfill its promises
and obligations to the people of the coast counties
and close the gap in the line running through that
section of the State. That improvement in our trans
portation system should have been made years ago,
but while the monopoly continued nothing was done!
Now that transcontinental competition is assured the
people along the coast will get their through line at
last.
During the last fiscal year California led all the
States of the Union in railroad building. That was
accomplished almost wholly by the construction of
the Valley Road. In the coming fiscal year we shall
probably lead again, since it now seems clear that
the Southern Pacific itself, after long asserting that
California needed no more railways, is about to
construct some itself.
French officials are accused of having connived at
the suicide of Colonel Henry. Suicide, however, is a
difficult thing at which to connive. Possibly they
employed hypnotism.
There is a suspicion that the Maguire campaign
hat reached its present condition of partial collapse
by having been talked through overmuch.
Dan Cole will hereafter coin money, but his
specialty will continue to be the honor of resembling
Lincoln.
It is safe to say that if Schley shall come to the Pa
cific station the people oiit here will be glad to see
him.
THE YELLOW CAMPAIGN.
WHEN the yellow journals begaji their denun
ciations of the War Department and first set
forth their ghastly and grewsome stories of
starvation and suffering amo*ng the troops in the va
rious camps of the East, not a few people were in
clined to believe their reports. Indeed many of the
earlier reports were quite true. In all wars troops at
the front frequently lack for sufficient supplies, and
when men are taken from a salubrious climate to the
swamps of the tropics they are liable under the best
of circumstances to be attacked by malarial fevers.
These evils to a considerable extent befell our vol
unteers at Santiago, and the suffering they underwent
was sufficient to win for them the sympathy of every
patriotic heart. That sympathy was freely given. No
gross exaggerations of the suffering and the sick
ness were necessary to arouse it. It rose spontan
eously in the breasts of the people as soon as the con
dition of affairs was made known, and prompt was
the responsive offering of money, food, medicines
and delicacies of all kinds for the relief and the com
fort of the sufferers.
No sooner, however, was this widespread sympathy
made known than the yellow journals seized upon the
opportunity to make a profit out of it. At once a
host of sensational, irresponsible writers of the emo
tional kind was turned loose to furnish the public
daily with tales of pestilence, hunger, famine and
cruelty. Dante hardly painted Inferno in blacker or
more horrid colors than these yellow rhetoricians
used in painting the camps of the American troops.
Estimated by the tales they told, Weyler's treatment
of the Cuban reconcentrados was mild-mannered gen
tleness in comparison to the treatment inflicted upon
our soldiers by their officers and the Government.
All this was bad enough, but there was worse to
come. The yellow journals, having made as much as
they could of the sickness among the troops as a
newspaper sensation, began to turn it to account for
political ends. The fused factions now arrayed in
opposition to the administration are badly in need of
an issue on which to make the campaign. It occurred
to the yellow editors that their camp stories would be
useful as an issue to the faction agitators, and at once
they gave a political turn to the mass of lies by adding
others to the effect that the President and the Sec
retary of War are directly responsible for the death
of every soldier who died of disease.
The malignancy of these charges is by no means
the worse characteristic of them. They have been
insulting to the nation and have tended to blacken
and stain the splendid glory won by the Union in the
war. They have portrayed our Government as viler,
cruder and more inhumanly barbarous to its troops
than any on earth. They have led thousands of
American women to live in fear and dread that more
serious dangers menace their loved ones in the camps
at home since the close of the war than in the
trenches before Santiago: and they have mocked the
honor of brave officers by representing them as cow
ards and thieves.
Such is the policy of attack the yellow journals
have outlined for the fusionists. It remains to be
seen whether any of them will be base enough to
adopt it. The Examiner has led the way in this State,
but as yet no speaker has followed the lead. It will
be well for them, indeed, if they abstain. Trying to
evade the single tax, land confiscation record of Ma
guire by such tactics would be a striking instance of
avoiding the road by taking to the mire.
PLEASING PHASE OF EXTRADITION.
WHETHER Chief Lees succeeds finally in con
vincing himself Â«f Mrs. Botkin's guilt or not,
it will undoubtedly be a great hardship upon
the lady to go to Delaware for trial. Her friends are
here, her witnesses are here, this is the stamping
ground of her attorneys, and here the chief and his
"tanks" are located. Yet we are constrained to re
mark that the principle involved in her extradition is
extremely important, and also that if decided by
Governor Budd against her it will at once relieve a
long standing and congested department of the law
in California.
If Mrs. Botkin can be extradited and sent to Dela
ware for trial W. R. Hearst of the yellow Examiner
can be extradited and brought to San Francisco for
the same purpose. A charge of criminal libel is
pending against Hearst in one of the courts of this
city upon which it has been impossible to try him.
He is not a fugitive from justice, not having been
here since the crime was committed, and the lawyers
engaged in the case have been compelled to drop the
prosecution until he ventures into the State. As the
yellow fellow is never likely to visit California and
stand trial, or constitute himself a fugitive from jus
tice by appearing and running away, he is practically
beyond the reach of our people.
A decision adverse to Mrs. Botkin would, however,
present the large number of men in California who
are anxious to meet Hearst an opportunity to force
an interview. The Examiner's libelees are as
numerous as leaves in the bowers of Vallombrosa.
Indeed, they are known to constitute a small army.
Were he to visit this city and were they to meet him
at the ferry, no political hero would be more warmly
or numerously "received." These gentlemen all re
gard the Botkin case with interest. They are filled
with a desire to once more cast their eyes upon the
yellow journalist, and they perceive a beacon of light
in that litigation.
We do not exactly hope the Governor of Dela
ware will get possession of Mrs. Botkin; that would
bf a rather unfeeling sentiment to express at this
moment of her danger and distress. But it is not out
of place to remark that if she shall be compelled to
go to Delaware, Mr. Hearst can be compelled to
come to San Francisco. The question is, Will the
end justify the means? Perhaps Mrs. Botkin could
be induced to make the sacrifice. Certainly if she
desired to benefit this community she could discover
no better cause in which to serve it than to aid us in
getting Hearst out here and into one of our jails.
Up to* the present time we have been unable to ac
count for the earnestness with which Chief Lees has
advocated extradition. It is now as plain as a pike

GORDON AVENGED, AND WHAT IT MEANS.
After thirteen years Chinese Gordon, the martyr of Khartoum, has been
avenged. Thousands of Dervish skeletons, bleaching on the sandy Sou
dan desert/ attest the fact that the long arm of the British Empire has at
last stretched itself toward the innermost regions of Africa. The re
venge has been slow in coming, but it is all the more effective. The Kha
lifa and his fanatical followers have paid dearly for their perfidy. The
prestige of British arms has been firmly established throughout Upper
Egypt, and one of the strongest fanatical outbreaks of the century has been
utterly crushed. Egypt, regenerated by a long period of rest and good
government, has won back the lost equatorial provinces that Sir Samuel
Baker conquered for her in 1870, and a flood of light will now be thrown
upon what has hitherto been one of the darkest and least known regions
of the globe.
It is no wonder that the magnificent victories at Atbara and Omdur
man have sent a thrill of Joy from one end of the British Empire to the
other; that is to say, around the globe. To a large section of the British
public Gordon has always appeared in the light of a martyred hero, sacri
flced^by the neglect and procrastination of the political party then in
power. His followers erected a splendid statue to him in Trafalgar Square,
and last Sunday, when the news of the British victories reached London,
the scene must have been most impressive. Thousands of people as
sembled in the great square, under the very shadow of Nelson, who looked
down upon the gathering from his lofty memorial column. And there,
with song and prayer, the avenging of Gordon was fittingly celebrated,
his statue was decked with garlands, paeans of victory resounded every
where, for all England felt that the stigma of a great national disgrace had
been removed.
However, apart altogether from the question of revenge, the results of
this forward movement will be stupendous, reaching even farther than we
can at present forecast. It is not merely that Britain, through Egypt, has
added to her empire a province measuring some two million square miles,
populated by twenty or thirty million people. She has opened for trade
one of the most fertile regions of the world, the Upper Nile basin, and haa
laid, on solid rock, the foundations of a great African empire. Nothing
now stands in the way of the accomplishment of Sir Cecil Rhodes' great
dream. The Napoleon of the Cape may yet see a railway from Capetown
to Cairo, running all the way through British territory. He may live to
bring the whole eastern coast of Africa under the national rule, throwing
open to commerce the densely populated and immensely productive regions
of Central Africa. It is a fitting sequel to the pioneer work of Baker and
Livingston, Gordon and Stanley.
No wonder that such an event has had a marked effect on European
politics. But a few years ago, at the time of the abortive Transvaal ris
ing, the Emperor of Germany openly sympathized with the Boers, and
brought his nation to the brink of war in consequence. Popular feeling in
England rose to the boiling point. The antagonism to Germany was so
strong that it actually extended to commercial circles, and for a time all
German made goods were boycotted by the British. Nothing but the
rapid mobilization and dispatch of a powerful naval squadron prevented
war, for even the hot headed young Emperor saw that it was time to re
frain from further action. h
To-day the same Emperor is the first to send a telegram congratulat
ing the Queen on the splendid victory achieved by her troops. He addresses
his soldiers in language appreciative of the English. Everything indicates
that the Anglo-German alliance is an accomplished fact, and is going to
prove a potent influence in European politics. Also in America, for .we
cannot ignore the truth that, since the war with Spain, we have become one
of the great powers, and may no longer excuse ourselvf^ under the plea
that Europe's business is none of ours. For good or evil, the thing has
been done, and the United States has definitely taken her place in what
diplomatists facetiously call the European concert.
Even France, chafing bitterly under secret resentment, feels bound to
applaud, for the Temps, an official organ, remarks: ''A march so scienti
fically planned may be likened to the solution of a mathematical equation."
Coming from such a source, this is high praise, indeed, for the victory em
phasizes, with a finality which can never be undone, the utter rout of
French schemes in Egypt. At one time, during the second empire, French
interests were everywhere supreme in the Khedive's land. The language
was generally spoken in educated circles, the finances of the state were con
trolled by Frenchmen; even the Khedive's court was modeled on that of
Napoleon 111. It was an era of unlimited display and extravagance. The
unfortunate fellah groaned bitterly under his load of taxation, but there
were fine times for Europeans at Cairo. The construction of the Suez
canal, the greatest of all French works, brought millions of money into the
land, but even this triumph of De Lesseps' engineering and financial skill
proved of no permanent benefit to the nation. The control of the canal has
long since passed out of French hands, and England to-day, thanks to Lord
Beaconsfleld's coup, is the largest shareholder.
The decline of French influence in Egypt dates from the bombardment
of Alexandria in 1882. Arabi Pasha's successful revolt against the impo
tent rule of the Khedive compelled European interference. France had her
warships on the scene, as well as England, but at the last moment she
backed out and left the latter nation to do all the work. The task, for
trained forces, was a comparatively easy one. The Egyptian soldier, in
Arabi Pasha's time, was vastly different from what he is to-day. No one
at that date thought he had any fighting blood in him. He was regarded
with utter contempt by European soldiers, and Wolseley, at Tel el Kebir,
walked over his intrenched position with the utmost ease.
From that period the Government of Egypt passed practically into Eng
lish hands, and France strove vainly to regain her lost position. Diplo
matically, and by every other means, she has endeavored to thwart British
rule. On the mixed tribunal, with Russia to aid her, she has systemat
ically opposed every scheme put forward for the fellahs' benefit. Over
and over again she has invited Great Britain, politely and otherwise, to let
go and come out of that; but John Bull has invariably replied that he was
not quite ready; there were still a few little things which required atten
tion before Egypt could be safely trusted to Gallic rule.
France's impotent rage has made her the laughing stock of Europe, and
meanwhile the work of regeneration has gone steadily on. Egypt to-day
is admittedly in a more prosperous condition than at any previous period of
her existence. All the extravagant splendor of an Oriental court has van
ished, and in its place we have a sober, matter-of-fact administration, car
ried on by men who have spent their whole lives governing Orientals.
Hence the taxes are light and the fellah, secure in the possession of his
gains, is rapidly becoming a wealthy peasantry. English non-commis
sioned officers, celebrated in verse by Kipling, took the native army in
hand and the success of the work has been proved beyond dispute by re
cent events. The once despised Egyptian has become a splendid fighting
machine, capable, under efficient leadership, of going anywhere and doing
anything.
Finally, to crown the edifice, we have the recapture of the lost Sou
dan provinces. The Anglo-German alliance places England's position, with
regard to Egypt, on an assured basis. John Bull's valid title to the country
is practically accepted by Europe, and the protests of France and Russia,
now hopelessly isolated, will avail naught. Nor is John Bull likely to let
go of his own accord. On the day when the British soldiers held solemn
funeral service within the walls of conquered Khartoum, they commemor
ated, with patriotic fidelity, the martyr whose death their victorious arms
had avenged. But they also celebrated an enormous accession to the re
sources and power of the British Empire. Gordon is avenged and the em
pire enlarged. It is a happy conjunction of events.

SOME FEELING STIBRED UP
AGAINST THE EIGHTH.
It Is Claimed That It Had Much to
Do With Bringing About the
Mustering Out of the Sixth
and Seventh.
Among the men of the Sixth and Sev
enth California regiments are quite a
number who. with the officers, do not de
sire to be mustered out. These men and
Officers have an idea that they have bwn
"jobbed 1 ' by the Eighth California, They
go so far as to state that the mustering
out of the Sixth and Seventh was brought
about by the officers of the Eighth, who
wish to remain in service. It is said that
on this account the feeling against the
Eighth is very bitter, and th.it if that
regiment is brought over to the Presidio
and comes in contact with certain men of
the Sixth and Seventh there is consid
erable likelihoou of a collision. The mili
tary authorities have been Informed of
this condition of affairs and will take
fains to prevent anything of the kind oc
curring.
Lieutenant Colonel Carrington goes to
Vancouver, Wash., with four companies
of the Eighth, and Colonel Henshaw with
another battalion will be stationed at
Benicla, three companies go to Fort
Point and one to Alcatraz.
The actual work of mustering out the
Seventh Regiment was commenced yes
terday morning by Captain Pratt. The
preparatory work will consume Borne
time, and It will be at least two weeks
before the regiment leaves for Los An
geles to be furloughed for thirty days,
after which the men will reassemble
there for the purpose of being finally paid
and honorably discharged. Captain Pratt
was in constant communication yester
day with the heads of the various bu
reaus at Washington relative to the
disposition of Government property be
longing at present t'> the regiment.
Captain Danes, who will muster out the
Sixth, will begin work just as soon as the
ther companies of that regiment arrive,
which should be to-morrow night. The
men of the S,ixth are opposed to the thirty
days' furlough, as they will have to sup
port themselves during that time. Their
petition that they be not given a furlough
has been forwarded to the War Depart
ment by General Miller for decision in
the tter.
The following dispatch received yester
day by General Miller from Adjutant
Genera] Corbin places the mustering out
and all questions relative to the same in
the power and discretion of the depart
ment commander, to whom It is directed:
The Secretary of AVar directs In the muster
â out of the Sixth and Seventh California Regi
ments of Vi lunteera that it be done with the
mustering officer under your direct supervision;
that Is, that you give the necessary order for
transportation and subsistence and <d\e the
mustering officer such support and the matter
such attention that there will be no lack of un
derstanding or medicine supplies or subsistence,
until the property Is turned In and these m.-n
relieved from service. This Is a matter re- :
quiring your personal nttention no less than
that of all the etaft . officers of . the etaff der
partment. "

mands joining other organizations. Gene

TIRED OF CAMP LIFE.
The Tennessee Soldiers Com-
plain of Poor Food and
Bad Quarters.
Complaints are still pouring In from the
enlisted soldiers, who, tired of camp life,
desire to get back to their homes and
families. The latest "kick" comes from
the Tennessee men, who not only ask to
be mustered out of the service, but who
state that they are not half fed. It is in
the form of a letter addressed to Presi
dent Hugh Craig of the Chamber of Com
merce. As it is somewhat of an anony
mous nature it is not yet decided what ac
tion, if any, will be taken in the matter.
In this connection there is another fea
ture that is taken into consideration, and
that If that it means a court-martial fur
any soldier to request outside Interference
in military matters. At least .such Is the
case in the lowa Regiment. It is alleged
that the men of Companies A and H re
cently received the information that if
they wrote to their homes anything about
the affairs in the camp, either in the way
of complaints or requests to their friends
in the East, they would be brought be
fore the military tribunal. This being
known to the members of the chamber,
they are likely to consider the complaint
of the Tennessee boys, even though it be
not signed. The letter is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 3, 1898.
Hugh Craig. President of the Chamber of
Commerceâ The enlisted men of the First Ten
nepsee Regiment desjre to thank -ou for your
efforts in trying to get them mustered out of

THE OREGON RECRUITS.
General Miller received a dispatch yes
terday from Adjutant General Corbln in
which lif quotes a telegram from Gov
ernor Lord of Oregon statins that the
300 recruits of the Second Oregon
Regiment are in a bad conuuion
from the fact that they have been neg
lected and not properly officered, and the
Governor requests that they be either dis
charged or sent to join their regiment at
Manila. It is the same old story, and the
facts in the case do not bear out the
menta of tho Governor. These re
cruits are attached to the Third Battalion
of the Twenty-third Tnfantry. Th*>y are
well officered and well cared for, and
there iÂ« no <ompbum among them. They
are the beat looking body and best drilled
of any recruits that have ever been at the
Presidio, and they are in excellent con
dition. These facts wore at oner sent to
the department by General Miller.

CONTEST PAPERS FILED
PEOSPECTS OF A VERY LIVELY
LEGAL BATTLE.
X/dgar E. Sutro, a Son of the Dead
Millionaire, Makes Some
Decidedly Serious Al
legations.
There will be a stubborn contest over
the probating of the will of the late
Adolph Sutro, who recently died, leaving
an estate roughly estimated to be worm
at least $1,000,000. The papers of contest
were filed with the County Clerk yester
day by Attorneys McEnerney, Slshop md
Wheeler, who have been retained by Kd
gar E. Sutro, a son of the dead million
aire, to fight his claim in court.
The contest docs not come as a surpnve.
A few Jays after the burial of ex-Mayor
Sutro it was publicly annuonced that ex
position would be offered to the probating
of a will executed in May, I&J2. The
claim was made that there was a will of
later date and â  interesting developments
were awaited. The papers riled in ri.e
i present contest do not refer to any jater
| will, but se* forth that Sutro died iv.wt
1 tate. The claim is further male that at
j the time of the execution of the will CI
: fered for probate Sutro was of un.-ound
i mind and incompetent to make a will or
testament. The following allegations are
taken from the papers tiled yeawruay:
That said Adolph Sutro, deceased, was at
the time of the execution of said alleged will
and for a long time prior and subsequent
thereto had been of unsound mind and incom
petent to make, execute, publish or republish
a will, and was not of sound mind and was
wholly Incompetent to make a will or testa
ment. . â ,
At the time of the execution of said alleged
will the said Adolph Sutro was laboring under
and was subject to and possessed of and ln
ttuenced, dominated, controlled and governed
by delusions concerning and relating to this
petitioner and his sisters and brother, which
delusions had no existence in fact and were
wholly without foundation in fact, and which
â¢ could not be removed by argument, proof or
persuasion, and which were insane delusions.
â  irald will was executed as a direct result of and
by rt-ason of such insane delusions.
; Said instrument dated May It, ISS2. and filed
i herein on the 13th day of August. 1898, and
purporting to be the last will of Adolph Sutro,
was procured to be made by reason of and
through undue influence exerted upon and over
the said Adolph Sutro by divers persons, and
â  that the said instrument was and is the dlr<
j result of such undue influence exerted as afore
said; that said Adolph Sutro was not at the
time of the execution of said Instrument free
from undue influence, and for a long time prior
thereto had been and until his death continued
to be acting under and subject to the undue in
fluence of divers persons; and the said instru
ment and its execution were and each was pro
cured to be made by means of and through and
as the direct result of undue Influence exerted
upon and over said deceased t>y said persons;
and said instrument and its execution were
and are and each of them is the direct result
of the undue influence exerted by such persona
over and upon the said Adolph Sutro.
At the time of the execution of the said in
strument, for a long time prior and subsequent
thereto, the said Adolph Sutro was suffering
i from physical ailments and disorders, the pre
' cisc names and nature of which are unknown to
i this contestant, and by reason thereof the said
Adolph Sutro became and was on the 22d day ot
May, ISS2, and at the time of the execution of
said instrument weakened In body and mind
and susceptible to prejudice and to the undue
Influence and artifice of designing persons. For
q long time prior to the date of said Instru
ment, namely May 22. ISS2. and at the time of
Its execution, divers designing persons hud the
desire And intrnt -to influence and 'induce the
said Adnljih Sutro to make a last will and i
testament and to make provision therein similar
if not identical with n.e provisions contained
in the instrument hereby contested.
Pursuant to their aforesaid design anil in
tent the said persons, for the purpose of pre
judicing the said Adolph Sutro against this
petitioner and agaifi-t his sisters and brother,
willfully and falsely represented to said Adolph
Sutro and persuaded him to believe that your
petitioner, his sisters and brother were want
ing in proper affection for him, and so induceil
him to believe. Each and ail of the aforesaid j
representations and statements to said Adolph
Sutro were false, and were at all times known :
to be false by the said persons so making the
same. By reason of the weakness of mind anj j

The most important feature of the con
test. If the allegations are true, is that
Sutro was insane from 1882 up to the time
of his death. That beir- true, San Fran

B Mayor who was by reason of mental
affliction unable to attend to his private
business, much less the affairs of a great
municipality.

NEVER TOLD
THEIR FRIENDS
R. H. Clark and Miss
Alma Stewart Are
Quietly Married.
The fact that some things are too. good |
to keep was conclusively proven last \
night when it leaked out that R. H.
Clark, the popular manager of the San
Francisco Club, and Miss Alma Stewart
â were (luletly married on Monday evening
at the home of the bride's mother, cor- j
ncr of O'Farrell and Hyde streets.
Although the wedding was extremely
quiet, yet as much preparation was mado ;
for the happy event as though it was to
have been the most prominent function i
of the season. The house was beautifully '
decorated with exquisite flowers, and the
happy pair stood in an arbor of white 1
and pink roses while they repeated after
Justice Barry the solemn, binding words.
The bride wore an elegant gown of j
white satin, trimmed with point lace The
veil was fastened to the coiffure by a
sunburst of diamonds, the gift of the
grTiom.
Both bride and groom were unattended.
Mr. and Mrs. Clark will spend their
honeymoon at Monterey, and on their
return will go to housekeeping

PRESS WOMEN IN SESSION.
The members of the Pacific Coast
Women's Press Association met in annual
convention at Golden Gate Hall yester
day afternoon. The opening session of
this, the eighth convention, was rather
tame in nature, the ladies reserving the
more sterling features of the meeting for
the session of this afternoon and evening
But a small audience greeted the conven
tion, making up, however, by an enthusi
astic appreciation for their lack of nurn-
ICrS. Emma Seckle Marshall, presid. Nt
of the association, in well chosen words
called the meeting to order. The pro
gramme was varied the papers bright
and snappy with the unusual merit of
being succinct.
The feature of the convention this after
noon will be the rather mysterlca] sympo
sium "Does a man own his own face?"
In the evening General W. H. L. Barnes
and Senator George C. Perkins will d,
liv. r addresses, choosing for their subject
"Shall we hold the Philippines?"
Brought His Life to a Close.
A young man who gave his name as

night. He was found dead %n the floor
yesterday afternoon with his throat cut
and a razor clutched in his right hand.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1898.
HER LOVE INDUCED HER TO SHOOT.
Pretty Evelyn Holt's Infatuation for Charles Pecker, Hyp
notist, Real Estate Agent and Matrimonial Bureau
Proprietor.
Evelyn Holt, the younp woman who fired a shot at Charles Fecker on
Jones street, near Ellis, Monday night with murderous intent, was arraign
ed in Judge Low's court yesterday morning on the charge of assault to
murder. She was represented by Attorney Boyer, who, on her behalf,
pleaded not guilty and a^ked for a continuance till to-morrow, which was
granted.
The girl talked freely yesterday about her infatuation for Fecker. She
carried his photograph in the bosom of her dress and felt sorrow-stricken
when It was taken from her at the prison on being searched.
"I met Fecker," she said, "about a year and a half ago and the very
next day he promised to marry me and I went to live with him as his wife.
He introduced me to all his friends as his wife and I trusted him so fully
that I gave him all my money and jewelry, which he pawned. I think, al
together, he got from me, including the money for my jewelry about $300.
Even after he got married and I was in Los Angeles he sent me a number
of letters in endearing terms, which shows his true character. I handed
these letters to my lawyer about a week ago to consider what action I
should take against him."
Fecker's peculiar methods of obtaining money from the gullible public
have been repeatedly exposed in the papers. He posed as a hypnotist, a
real estate agent, conductor of a matrimonial bureau and other things.
May 6th, this year, he was arrested on the charge of obtaining money by
false pretenses. The complaining witness was James Newman, who, on
representations made to him by Fecker, paid him $150 cash and gave him a
note for $50 for a share in his business. Newman found in a very short
time that the representations made to him were false and he had Fecker
arrested^
At the preliminary examination before Judge Low, the Holt girl testi
fied strongly in favor of Fecker, contradicting the evidence of Newman
and his wife. At that time she denied that she was living with Fecker and
the. siJi^cial attorney for the prosecution, Fred Frey, -seriously thought of
having \er arrested for perjury. Judge Low held Fecker to answer before
the Superior Court, but. when the case came up for trial in Judge Cook's
court on August 23, Assistant District Attorney Hinkle moved for its dis
missal on the ground that the evidence was Insufflcent and it was dis
missed.. Now the girl is sorry that she testified as she did before Judge
Low.

PASSING OF THE SHIPPING
AND GBAIN BROXEB.
News From Cooks Inlet Is That No
Prospecting Could Be Done by
Miners Owing to the
Bain.
Three ships with rather unusual cargoes
have left this port for England and Aus
tralia recently. The German ship Theo
dor took away for London a million and
a half feet of lumber, 148.000 pounds of
hops and 380.000 pounds of tallow. The
Hawaiian bark Himalaya took away for^
Melbourne, Australia, 013,234 feet of lum
ber, 2750 cases canned goods and 75,200
pounds of hops, while the Russian bark
Westbury cleared for Sydney, Australia,
With a cargo of 182,376 feet of lumber,
5100 cases of canned fruit, 395 bales of pa
per and some sundries. The hops on the
Theodor and Himalaya are the largest
consignments that ever sailed from
here for England and Australia In
a single bottom. The lumber Is
principally spruce and redwood for manu
facturing purposes and the paper is for
one of the newspapers in Lyttleton, New
Zealand. â .
All three vessels sailed about the same
time and the captains expect to make
quick runs. The Westbury will probably
be the first to arrive, and she and the
Himalaya should be discharged and load
ed again before the Theodor reaches
London. . .. _
First Mate Paul Strang of the German
bark Marco J'olo went to the German
Hospital yesterday. He Is a sick man and
his ship will have to sail without him.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
canlierv tender Jennie arrived from Cooks
Inlet yesterday. Her captain reports that
the miners did little or no prospecting
this year. They could not get to work,
as it rained continuously for six weeks
and all the creeks were overflowed. The
men all seemed to be do ,m on their luck,
but were determined to stick it out for
another season.
On August 20 the ship Centennial com
pleted loading. She has 40,000 cases sal
mon aboard, and the Jennie towed her to
sea before starting for San Francisco.
The British ship Glenaricht, reported as
in collision off the Horn with the British

J. W. H. Campbell, the well known ship
ping man and grain broker, died at his
home on Lombard street yesterday. De
cedent has been ailing for nearly a year.
He was thrown from his horse some time
since while exercising the animal among
the sand hills near Fort Point, and re
ceived injuries from which he never re
covered. Months ago, knowing that hla
death was only a question of time, he
bepran settling up his estate. Almost all
his property was turned into cash and his
real estate transferred to his wife. Mr.
Campbell was passionately fond of the
Proverbs of Solomon, and he had them
printed, in pamphlet form. Pew people
along the front but what received a copy
at one time or another, and some of the
members of the Produce and Merchants'
Exchange have half a dozen copies.
News from Kotzebue Sound received
here yesterday is to the effect that all
the vessels that left ht>re with gold hunt
ers have arrived in safety. The bark
Alaska, Captain Cogan, was one of the
last to get in, owing to the delay in put
ting her stern wheel river steamer to
gether at St. Lawrence Island.
While the steamer John Riley was being
built the Alaska went over to the Si
berian coast and the gold hunters did
considerable trading.
Owing to delay in the arrival of the
English mall the steamship Moana for
Australia will not sail until 10 o'clock
this evening^

happy event is to occur, will be artistic
ally decorated with choicest pink blos
soms.
The bride will wear a magnificent gown
of white, satin completely covered with a

TIRED OF BEING
A NURSERYMAN
Tim Hopkins Abandons
His Fad.
IT WAS A COSTLY VENTURE
MONEY WOULD NOT MAKE IT
PROSPER.
The Broad Acres of the Menlo Mil
lionaire No Longer Devoted
to tne Business of Plant
Sprouting.
That experience In the nursery and seed
business "comes high," and that disap
pointments are thrown in without extra
charge, can be attested by Timothy Hop
kins, the well-known millionaire of Menlo
Park.
In 1892, when he was no longer actively
Interested in the affairs of the Southern
Pacific Company, he concluded to engage
in a congenial business in an active man
ner. By reason of his possession of a
magnificent domain in San Mateo County
and his deep interest In all things per
taining to floriculture, horticulture, etc.,
he determined to establish a nursery that
should be second to none on this coast.
In connection with this fact It should be
stated that Mr. Hopkins, while treasurer
of the Southern Pacific Company, had a
favorite amanuensis, James Sproule.
This young man was placed at the head
of the enterprise and instructed to buy
out an old established house on Clay
street as a basis of operations. This was
done.
The broad acres of sweet peas, calla
lilies, chrysanthemums and many other
outdoor flowering plants, the almost end
less beds of violets under the wide-spread
ing oaks of Menlo, the extensive nursery,
hothouses and forcing beds, created under
his direction, became famous throughout
the State, and the East as well. The
products of the Sunset Seed and Plant
Company were soon the fashion, and the
business went to the fore with a rush,
leaving the pioneer concerns of "the kind
far behind.
The institution was rated lnÃradstreet's
at $1,000,000, by reason of the fact that
Hopkins was backing it. Mr. Sproule acted
as manager, and things on the surface
seemed all right. However, appearances
were deceptive. The first serious trouble
came In the season of 1893-94, when there
was a strike of the nursery employes for
higher wages. The demand was not
granted, and a new gang was put to work,
but too late to save the crop.
It Is stated by those who are compe
tent to speak that when Mr. Hopkins
sickened of his enterprise and dropped
it, he had been forever separated from
over $70,000, this total having been ad
vanced and expended In various ways In
an endeavor to operate the business on
a self-sustaining basis.
These painful efforts proved fruitless,
and, as stated, Sproule was afforded an.
opportunity to paddle the canoe himself.
The business was moved to the foot of
Market street, and the public knew noth
ing of its difficulties until a short time
ago, when a circular was sent out to
creditors stating that the institution was
(15,000 In deot, but coming out all right,
etc.
The next action in the matter has just
been made. The stock of the nursery
business at 33 Market street was moved
to 821 Montgomery street a few days ago.
The fact that the transfer of the busi
ness was made about a year ago without
any notification to creditors has caused
considerable friction between them and
the seed company, and It Is rumored that
some decisive action will be taken at
once to ascertain if the founder of the
house has at the present time any re
sponsible connection therewith.

of the Kahunas" in next Sunday's
Call.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6â To-day's stock mar
ket was variable and irreprular at all times,
but was more or less under the continuing
Influence of the shrinking surplus reserves of
the banks and the suffer rates for money.
General speculation was almost at a standstill
and tha movement of the market was confined
largely to special stocks, the trading being
highly professional throughout. The opening
was higher In sympathy with London. It
quickly became evident, however, that no out
side Interest had been enlisted here and the
professional bears attacked the list In weak
spots. A number of individual stocks showed
conspicuous strength all day and a rally in
People's Gas drove the bears to cover and
made them more cautious. The strength (]â >-
came general in the late dealings under the
leadership of. St. Paul and the close n;;3
strong at the best prices of the day and gen
erally at a level above Friday's close. The
fear of Interrupted traffic through yellow feves
quarantine waa a factor In the early weakness,
especially In Southern Railway preferred, but
at th" same time there was an advance of Z\
In Illinois Central and conspicuous firmness In
Louisville on the prospect of resumption of
Havana trafic. Baltimore and Ohio was heav
ily bought by the tanking Interests all day
and showed an extreme gain of 5 points. Other
strong features were Denver preferred, Atchi
con Prefi rred, Reading first preferred. Denver
and Gulf, the Pacific Coast Improvement stocks
and the Grangers in sympathy with St. Paul
on the heavy advantageous showing In the
letter's annual report. The dominant factor In
the situation, however, continues to be the ab
sorption of money by the United States Treas
ury on account of subscriptions to the new
bonds. Call money continued firm with 3 per
cent the ruling rate.
Bonds were dull but prices were in the main
firmly held. Total sales, $2,440,000. United
States old 4s, regular, and the 5s advanced Â»4
and tlu> new 4s and the 3s, when Issued, H
per cent in the bid price.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. Câ The Evening Post'B
London financial cablegram Bays: The stock
markets here were generally good to-day on
the clear political horizon, such dflcUnaa as
have taken place in Argentines and a tm
other stocks being merely due to profit-taking.
Grand Trunk was fiat. Americans opened above
the parity, but except for Ceneral Pacific the
market was uninteresting until the close, when
a sharp rise In Baltimore and Ohio was the
ieature. ,
General outlook for Americans is good unless
public attention should be seriously ' diverted
to mines. The proposition at the moment Is
that the Cape Is bu--ing Kaffirs eagerly and
Adelaide Is buying West Australian â  mines.
Both markets are bare of shares and efforts
are evidently being made to begin a small
boom.
New York is buying gold in Paris as also
here, although much mystery is observed here
as to the actual buyers. The price is about
77s 10^d.
The Indian Government Is renewing Â£2.000.000
in treasury' bills and this may help to steady
the money rates here. A large amount is to
be repaid by the market to the Bank of Eng
land to-morrow.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 6.â Wheat held very steady
durini? the first hour, although the j conditions
were regarded as bearish. Some of the early
transactions were at *uc or more above the
close Saturday. The strength in corn was an
influence to wheat, and besides there was a
good deal of profit taking by shorts. Offerings
were small with the competition sharp and
prices held firm for a time. The enormous re
ceipts In the Northwest were regarded as dis
couraging. The strength -with which the mar
ket opened was fairly well maintained â  until
the visible supply statement was completed.
which showed Â£,220,000 bushels . Increase, com
pared with 6;C,000 bushels decrease the year
before. That Increase was somewhat heavier
than expected and prices dropped on its re
ceipt to %c below the highest point previously
made for December and %c below the top
for September. At the close September was Vie
lower and December %@iic higher than Sat
urday. ,
Lower temperatures and reports of killing
frosts In some districts strengthened corn
early. The fear that the Government report,
due this week, might not show any deteriora
tion since August 1, however, acted as a par
tial counterweiKht to the general bullish sur
roundings of the corn pit. December left oft
%c higher.
Oats folluwed corn, but did not display as
much strength as did the latter. The close
is unchanged to VÂ»c up for May.
The feeling In provisions was very unsettled
over the yellow ' fever situation. Packing
house â  interests sold freely and the market
ruled heavy throughout with the lowest point
of a considerable decline current at the close

The market continues depressed under this
continued flood, as shown by the downward
tendency In prices.
The lesson to be learned from this year's ex
perience Is simple. It Is that every farmer
who raises Hay for the San Francisco market
ought to provide himself with buildings for
storing it, unless he expects to sacrifice his
crop. The enormous crop raised in Sonoma
County this year is being thrown on the market

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS. RAISINS, ETC.
It Is beginning to look as If the fruit crop
of the whole world would be more or less short
this year. We know already that Apricots,
Peaches and Prunes are short In California,
but similar reports are now coming In from
all quarters. Thus the Eastern Apple crop
is reported seriously deficient by the Govern
ment report, and the Prune crop of Bosnia and
Servla, which Eastern buyers have been hold-
Ing up as Immense to the detriment of the Cal
ifornia product. is now found to have suffered
severely by a prolonged drought, and Is run
ning to small sizes, like the California crop,
and now the Grape crop of Northern Califor
nia is< turning out less than expected. In fact,
this Is decidedly an oft year In fruit, not only
In America, but In Europe as well.
Prices for all descriptions remain about the
same. The market rules dull, chiefly on ac
count of the extreme hot weather In the East,
which checks the demand. The feeling, how
ever, Is steady, and whenever a change oc
curs It Is likely to be in 'the direction of an
advance.

BEWARE CYCLISTS 1 LOCKJAW.
Cyclists' hump was followed by cyclists'
heart, and this latter has In turn been
succeeded by cyclists' lockjaw. Until the
other day the leading- case was that of
the gentleman who found himself landed
on a dustheap. Nothing worse appeared
to have happened to him than a scratch
upon his nose. But the microbe of te
tanus, it Is alleged, was on that dust
heap, watching its opportunity, and it
found it in that abraded organ, with fatal
results to the owner. More recently there
has been the case of an Essex clergyman
How the microbe effected a lodgment in
this victim is not so clear. He does not
seem to have been open to the attack in
consequence of any abrasion; but a scien
tific contemporary is inclined to think
that he must have been riding open
mouthed and that the microbe was ab
sorbed in that way. The moral, it is
pointed out, is that the cyclist should
breathe through his nose and keep his
mouth shut, and there is no doubt that
in a considerable number of cyclists this
form of lockjaw would not only be good
for them but would be much appreciated
by other people.â Pall Mall Gazette.

THE SCHOOLS
AS FAILURES
Oakland Councilman
Creates a Breeze.
CUVELLIER ON THE WARPATH
CLAIMS THE BOARD OF EDUCA
TION IS HYPNOTIZED.
Under the Spell of Superintendent
McClymonds, Whose Business
Is Politics, Not Edu
cation.
OAKLAND, Sept. 6.â There has never
been such excitement at a meeting of the
Board of Education as developed to-night
when Councilman Cuvellier, appearing aa
a citizen, denounced the members and
the schools of this city in the most se
vere terms. Some time ago Mr. Cuvel
lier spoke to Director Russ about an In
quiry he was making and stated that he
would like to read a paper to the Board
of Education, making some suggestions.
Mr. Cuvellier appeared to-night with his
paper, but no one was prepared for what
was to follow. The conclusion of the
paper was signaled by a perfect storm of
indignant expressions from the School Di
rectors.
"I have discovered after much re
search," said Cuvellier, "that the public
Bchool system of Oakland is a dismal
failure. The failure is complete and it
renV-ots on every member of the Board
of Education as well as on the superin
tendent and perhaps on the latter moat
of all.
"The universities at Berkeley and Stan-.
ford have declared that students who en
ter from the uakland schools are the
worst prepared of any seeking entrance to
those seals of learning:. I have consulted
with professors, teaciiers, parents and
pupils ajul all are unanimous in denounc
ing the Oakland school system as a dire
â  and complete failure. I can lind nothing
to recommend, but everything seems to
have gone to ruin. In every school the
same spirit is manifested, and the system
is a disgrace to this municipality.
"An enormous amount of money Is spent
by the School Department, for which no
adequate return is given to the taxpay
ers. Most of the money is wastedâabso
lutely wasted â and this fact at this time,
when so much money is required for
necessary Improvements, is nothing short
of a municipal calamity.
"In spite of all the booming that is
given the Oakland schools they are in re
ality the poorest in the land, and there
Is but one word to express their condi
tion â failure. 1 have cart-fully compiled
these ideas which 1 have printed, and to
morrow 1 shall place a copy in every
home in Oakland. 1 want the parents
to know what is going on. Their chil
dren's interest is now t.ie subject receiv
ing the least consideration at the hands
of the Board of Education and its super
intendent. It should be the first subject
considered, but that is so no more. The
children are crammed for the purpose
of making a false showing, but as soon
as they meet the processors of one of
our universities they find they have no
practical foundation for a university
courseâ that they are in fact failures.
While at Stanford recently I was told, to
my great surprise, that the worst trained
Supils that entered there are from the
an Francisco and Oakland schools. I
Investigated the matter and 1 am con
vinced that 1 was told the truth. Our
children are not receiving the education j
they shcrtiM get, T>r which is paid for. The
children are facrfficed, the taxes squaii
oeiÂ«.d.
"The members of this board are hypno
tized by Superintendent McUlymonds. No
one dares do anything contrary to his di
08, and his power extends through
out the entire board. Mr. McCymonds
is the board and politics, not education,
is his business. It is largely his fault
that ii.- .-â¢ hools are in such a dismal
condition and are such a disgrace.'
"So notorious has their inefficiency and
cramming record become that parents are
taking their children away and there are
many less children in the schools to-day
than there should be. Particularly Is
this the case in the High School, where
there are perhaps nearly two hundred
less scholars than there were a year
ago.
"The course of study is wrong, the sys
tem of teaching is wrong and there is a
crying need of a change-.
"I have not made these remarks from
any feeling of malice, but have done it
with the kindliest of feelings and because
I have the interests of the schools at
heart."
Mr. Cuvellier did not get through with
out being interrupted, and when he con
cluded each of the Directors wanted to
speak at once. Some said it was false,
others that the Councilman had been
misinformed. John Russ was "disgusted
at such nonsense." Director Myra
Knox said that "some of the statements
were so stupid that they were not worth
a reply," and Superineiident McCly
monds doubted "if any man who would
make such statements could be sane."
"This is the most uncalled for diatribe I
ever heard," said Director Russ. "It is
an insult to us gentlemen to say we are
hypnotized by our Superintendent. If
Mr. Cuvellier wants the course of study
changed he must know that it is fixed by
the State and tnat he must begin such a
campaign in the Legislature." Amid
much confusion the communication was
referred to a committee, and Mr. Cuvel
lier retired without leaving a copy of hia
philippic with the board.

The fraternal order known as the
Knights and Ladies of Honor attained its
majority yesterday, and last night the lo
cal lodges celebrated ltÃ twenty-first an
niversary by an entertainment and dance
in Turn Verein Hall on Turk street. There
was a good attendance of the member
ship and friends, who were treated to a
programme of many numbers, including
ballads, recitations, instrumental music
and a flag drill by a number of small
boys and girls, members of the Juvenile
class of Turners. The drill was one of the
most attractive features and was so
warmly applauded that for an encore the
children formed a semi-circle around the
Goddess of Liberty while Lene Hachmels
ter sang the "Star-spangled Banner." Z.
T. Whitten was the master of ceremonies
and those who contributed -to the enter
tainment for the evening were: Professor
A. C. Love, Marion G. Perry. Frieda
Rehn. Hazel Schutter, Ben Grodjens,
Misses Priscllla Davles and Alice Sever
ance. Professor Werner and Misses Jessie
and Rose Lane. Mrs. L. J. Wheelock, the
grand protector, delivered a short, In
structive address on the order, and Pro
fppeur G. Widder talked on the same sub
ject. At the close of the programme there
was dancing until midnight.
The -proceeds of the evening will be for
warded to Clara Barton for the use of
the society of which she is the head.
TO GOVERN CYCLERS.
Bay City Wheelmen Elect Officers for
the Ensuing Term â Baker
& Hamilton Race.
The annual election of the Bay City
Wheelmen, the oldest cycling organiza
tion on the coast, was held in the club
house, Golden Gate avenue, last night.
The directors selected were: Frank H.
Kerrigan, Walter D. Sheldon, Theodore
C. Dodge. F. H. Waters, A. G. Reid, H.
Parkin, Henry W. Spalding. Emil Fahr
bach. E. T. Mervey, E. M. Creigh and
H. L. Day. Captain A. J. Menne. First
Lieutenant H. W. Welsh and Second
Lieutenant Walter J. Davidson were cho
sen as road officers.
The members of the road racing com
mittee of the California Associated Cy
cling Clubs have selected the 18th inst.
as the date upon which will be contested
the annual Baker & Hamilton race. En
tries will close on the 15th, at which time
the positions of the various contestants
will be determined.
It has been decided to allow unlimited
pacemaking, so the race should prove a
remarkable contest. The trophy, which
was donated by Baker & Hamilton, is
one of the most beautiful and costly ever
offered for cycling competition. It must
be won three times before becoming the
property of any club.
Black Must Suffer.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the
judgment of the lower court in the case
of John Black, who was convicted of a
felony. The charge was that Black stole
a quantity of jewelry In Canada and
brought it to this city, which under the
law is as great an offense as If the lar
ceny had been committed here. The ap
peal was based upon the technicality that
while this law applies as between States,
the court has no jurisdiction where a
foreign country is concerned. The Su
preme Court took the broader view of the
case and paid no attention to that con
tention, but affirmed the Judgment upon
the phrase, "Convicted as If such larceny
â¢ â¢ â¢ had been committed in this State/
A Lunatic's Suicide.

went upstairs to tne bathrooorn and shot
himself. He had been an inmate of the
Xapa Insane Asylum and was under
treatment for softening of the brain.

MAN WOODWARD.
If He Were a Wine Merchant He
Would Not Agitate the Mat
ter for Fear of Higher
License.
i
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 6.
The Merchants' Committee having in
hand the protest against the Earl License
Ordinance now before the Council, met
this morning and heard the opinion of
Councilman Woodward in the matter.
Mr. Woodward did not give the merchants
a great deal of satisfaction. He said:
"The city should take care of its environ
ments and the money should be raised by
a tax to which all contribute. If ow would
it be better to have a general tax levy to
meet extraordinary expenses or raise the
money by special licenses? I have not as
yet decided this matter, and want to vote
the way that will meet with general ap
proval. The levy for this year will be
1.27 and with the expense of the Lake
Merritt improvements It will have to be
raised to 1.37. I think that the liquor li
cense is too high now; it should be ad
justed and others should bear their part."
George E. Fairchild said that in an
emergency year, such as this, it is surely
not good policy to lower the liquor license
and put an extra tax on merchants, to
which Councilman Woodward replied that
if he were a wine merchant he would not
agitate the matter for fear of stirring up
a license of $200 a quarter instead of 1100.
He said that doctors, lawyers, dentists,
expressmen and all classes should con
tribute to the tax.
M. J. Keller said this license matter
came up eleven years ago and it was de
cided then that the merchants should
have some recognition in the city govern
ment. The liquor license and the mer
chants' license were separate at that
time. The same conditions prevail now
that existed then. "No fair-minded citi
zen," said Mr. Keller, "will think of tax
ing the merchants further. They are
taxed now more than any other class.
The merchants create no great necessity
for protection from the city government.
AYe pay for our own special police; our
own lights, besides which we pay a large
tax on our stock and give freely to chari
ties, fairs and donations of all kinds."
H. C. Canwell, Sol Kahn. A. A. Pen
noyer, A. Salinger and others spoke on
the measure against the taxing of the
merchants and the reducing of saloon IIS
censes. The committee will meet again
to-morrow morning.
OLYMPIC CLUB ELECTION.
Officers Who "Will Strive to Place the
Great Amateur Institution on
a Sound Footing.
Owing to the fact that members of the
Olympic Club were a unit on the gen
tlemen selected by the nominating com
mittee to offlcfate during the next term,
rather meager interest was taken last
evening in the balloting for officers. In
fact, there was less scratching of names

Club's New President.
presented than has been known for many
years. The members who will pilot the
club to a safe port during the next year
are: J. C. Kirkpatrick, president; F. P.
McLennan, J. W. Mullen, H. B. Rugs, J.
A. Hammersmith, G. James, S. F. Pres
ton, J. OB. Gunn, H. V. Kamsdell, O. B.
Burns and E. G. O'Kane.
Mr. Hammersmith, as leader of the
club, promises to introduce many novel
ties and new life into the institution,
and should he see his way clear to make
changes for the better intprest and wel
fare of the club, he will doubtless rein
state Professors Watson and Belau. The
former was boxing instructor for many
years, and the latter the gymnastic in-
Btructor. Leader Howard Tayior dis
missed those important personages on the
grounds of retrenchment, but in so do
ing he secured the enmity of the young
er element of the club.
AN INHERITANCE SPENT.
Sheriff Whelan Levies on the Beal
Estate Owned by Charles
H. Lux.
Another Illustration of the ease with
which large fortunes are dissipated by the
heirs of rich men is found in the case of
Charles 11. Lux of San Jose, nephew of
the deceased millionaire, Charles Lux. All
of the property derived from the Lux es
tate in which young Charles and his wife
have an Interest will be immediately at
tached by order of the Sheriff of Santa
Clara County to satisfy a Superior Court
judgment for $11,775 obtained by the Gar
den City Bank and Trust Company in
San Jose. Notice was sent to Sheriff
Whelan yeÃterday and he at once took
steps to levy attachments on the following
described pieces of real estate: At Mari
posa street and Potrero avenue, 200 feet;
south side Market street, near Eleventh,
30 feet; Twentieth and Guerrero streets,
67 feet; Fourth avenue and Platte street,
150 feet; Islais and Kentucky streets, 182
feet.
Charles H. Lux Is a young man 31
years of age. He married a well-known
society girl of San Jose a few years ago.
His share of the Lux estate amounted to
$17,500, as nearly as can be estimated.
This sum proved utterly insufficient for
his needs and indebtedness began to pile
up, which could not be carried longer.
Father Yorke Will Preach.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Catholic Truth Society will be held at
the Cathedral, Van Ness avenue, this
evening at 8 o'clock. Father Yorfce will
preach, taking for his theme, "What is
meant by the saying 'Outside the Church
No Salvation.' " This will be one of the
few opportunities afforded to ,hear the
eloquent priest before his departure for
Europe.
Alice Bix writes about the "Last

Threw Emself in Front of a Car.
Thomas Grant, ex-editor of the Califor
nia Architect, who attempted suicide Mon
day afternoon by stabbing himself with a
penknife and- jumping into Islais Creek,
made, It seems, an earlier attempt. About
11 o'clock In the morning he threw himself
in front of an electric car on Devisadero
street between Turk and Golden Gate
avenue, and was shoved along for sev
eral yards before the car was stopped.
When picked up he was uninjured. H. C.
Fiest, the motorman, identified him at the
Receiving Hospital yesterday morning.
The Insanity Commissioners decided yes
terday that Grant was only suffering from
a prolonged debauch, and he will be re
leased in a day or two.
Will Trot for Prizes.
The members of the Golden Gate Park
Driving Association held a meeting last
night at 1200 Market street to make final
preparations for the gentlemen's driving
meeting to be held at Ingleside track on
Admission day.
The following programme of races was
decided upon for the first day:
First raceâ Our Joe, Haviland, Steve S.
Pardee, Bishop Hero, Maud Newman.
Second raceâ Blanche L, George Wilkes,
Lee Rose, Locallier, Eddie S, Way Boy,
Lullaby, Thomas Sharkey, Baby.

Will of Dr. John If. Morse.
The will of the late Dr. John F. Morse,
who died a few weeks ago, has been filed
for probate. It was executed March 31,
1593, and leaves half of the estate to his
widow, Alice H. Morse, and the remain
ing half to be divided between the chil
dren in equal shares. A request is made
that his medical library and surgical in
struments be kept intact in the event that
one of his children may desire to enter
the practice of medicine. The value of
the estate is nut set forth, but the petition
for letters of administration fixes the
value at over $10.<XX>.
Not in Haste to Remarry.
Marriage License Clerk Danforth. stated
yesterday that so far as he knew none
of the persons residing in this city who
had been wedded on the high seas by the
captains of vessels, so as to evade the
California restrictions on marriage, had
yet applied for licenses to be remarrried
in legal form, although It is to be pre
sumed that most of these persons had
read of the Supreme Court decision de
claring invalid marriages by the captain
under such circumstances.
The Scott Will Contest.
Mrs. Amanda Miley, who filed a contest
to the probating of the will of the late
Angr-lia R. Scott, consented- yesterday to
a dismissal of the proceedings pending In
Judge Coffey's court. E. W. Scott, hus
band of the decedent, also contested the
will, alleging that his wife was of un
sound mind, and Judge Coffey decided ad
versely to his claim several days ago,
Scott intends appealing his contest to the
Supremo Court.

DRIVEN TO WANT
BY THE DROUGHT
Destitution in Southern
Monterey County.
SCORES OF NEEDY FAMILIES
URGENT CASES TEMPORARILY
PROVIDED FOR.
Supervisors Will Probably Revive
the Squirrel Bounty, Build
New Roads and Repair
Old Ones.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Sept. 6.â The committee of
citizens appointed five weeks since to
Investigate reports of destitution In the
southern portion of this county re
ported to the Board of Supervisors this
afternoon a full account of their In
vestigations. Sixty-seven letters, ask
ing for Immediate relief, were received
inside of three weeks, sixty of which
asked Immediate aid for families to
stave off starvation. Not one of those
who are reported to the committee had
applied themselves, but by neighbors.
Several families in Jolon district were
in such urgent need that the commit
tee took a small collection of provisions
and money and supplied their immedi
ate wants until the present meeting of
the board.
The appeals In many cases have been
pitiful. One mother writes that her
provisions are all gone, and for her
children's sake she must seek charity.
Others say there are lots of people in
this part of the country in utter dis
tress who need only work, as the stores
will nut trust any one who does not
own property. No meat has been
eaten in the stricken section for weeks,
and all that can be procured are bacon
and beans, which are nearly all gone.
They ask how to obtain help, and say
'"In the naihe of God and humanity,
help us and save our country's fair
name."
To remedy this state of affairs the
committee presented a petition to the
Board of Supervisors this afternoon, in
which they state that owing to the
drought and the consequent failure of
crops in the southern portion of the
county there are many worthy people
in limited circumstances and almost
destitute, and to remedy this state of
affairs, which has been heightened by
other circumstances, they ask that a
squirrel bounty of 3 cents be granted
on each squirrel killed within the
county, which will, owing to the scar
city of food, result In the almost total
annihilation of the squirrel pest; also
that the board authorize improvements
In the construction, repair and rebuild
ing of roads in southern Monterey
County and only employ those who are
in need â not awarding the work to con
tractors â thereby giving the same
where it is needed and distributing it
in such manner as to benefit the larg
est possible number of people.
This petition, which was added to the
report, has been signed by over 500 of
the most prominent citizens of the
county, and the board will doubtless re
new the squirrel tax bounty and build
new roads.

RED BTA'FF, Sept. 6.â The mystery of

Officers have been searching up and down
the river and to-day discovered a pool
of blood near where the leg was found
Coroner West and Sheriff Bogard went
down this afternoon to investigate, but
have not made public anything they dis
covered. The accident theory has fallen

IN HIGH GLEE

CONSPIRACY NOT A CRIME
COLLECTOR JACKSON HAS NO
POWER.
Highbinders at Liberty to Commit
the Gravest Crimes Without
Fear of Prose
cution.
Federal officials are still engaged in
boring mole tunnels in the Chinese Bu
reau scandal. Major Moore was not at
his office yesterday, and his clerks would
not give any information regarding his
movements. All that could be gathered
from them was that he was out of town.
Collector Jackson was In the same bliss
ful condition of mentality. He was out
of town, he said, when the articles ap
peared in The Call concerning the old
story of bribery by the Chinese brokers.
He admitted that he had not taken any
steps to ascertain the whereabouts of
Chan Tai Tsung, the writer of the com
promising letter found secreted upon the
person of Hew Hon, the cook, arrested
by Inspectors Lynch and Gardner on the
Mail Dock. In fact, he did not know
whether the detection of the writer
would accomplish any good result what
ever. Colonel Jackson said that he had
failed to find any Federal statute under
which Chan Tal Tsung or any other per
son engaged in a conspiracy to land Chi
nese could be prosecuted or punished. He
had failed also to find any statute by
which any one of the gang of Chinese
brokers and hired witnesses now Infest
ing the Chinese Bureau could be pun
ished, either for conspiracy or for per
jury. Perjury in the legal and punishable
sense, he explained, could be committed
only in a Judicial proceeding. The pro
ceedings relating to the landing of Chi
nese by the Collector of the Port are
executive, not Judicial Therefore, what
ever false testimony may be given with
the purpose and intent of defeating the
operation of a Federal statute Is neither
perjury nor conspiracy.
Chief Meredith is very sore over the
statement that certain unnamed Federal
officials of high and low degree Intimate
that he should be held responsible for the
leakage in his office indicated by the let
ter of Chan Tai Tsung of Sam Hop &
Co. of 901 Dupont street. He regards
that intimation as a reflection upon his
integrity, and refuses to admit that it
may be a criticism upon his competency
to maintain aji effective watch upon the
doings of his subordinates. He admits
that as custodian of the written testi
mony he would be responsible for its es
cape into the ranks of the enemy, but
he denies that It has escaped. Hi's the
ory is that the statement made In the
letter of Chan Tal Tsung was a bluff
designed to impress the person addressed
with the Idea that he, Chan, had cor
rupted the bureau and could land him
safely.
The Federal officials have not charged
Mr. Meredith with being corrupt. They
simply, at this stage of the inquiry, hold
him responsible as chief of the bureau for
the leakage which they believe exists

Among the most Interesting letters re
ceutly received from Manila Is one writ
ten by George E. Barron of Company E,
Tenth Pennsylvania Infantry, to John F.
Myers of this city.
"After a pleasant voyage across the
peaceful Pacific we are now safely en
camped on the soil of the enemy," writes
Mr. Barron. "We spent one day, June 24,
in Honolulu, where we were given a grand
reception.
"We came by way of the Ladrone Is
lands, stopping there but a few minutes.
Many of the boys were seasick, but I did
not miss a meal and never refused a lunch
between times. Five deaths occurred
during the trip; one on the China, one on
the Senator and three on the Colon. Our
provisions while on board ship were very
good; in fact, there was nothing that
one's appetite could desire but what we
had. Five small launches brought our
regiment from the steamer to within fifty
yards of the shore, and the rest of the
way we had to wade in water up to our
shoulders.
"Our camp is located in a beautiful field,
not over fifty yards from the water, and
under the protection of Dewey's guns.
We see the wounded, the dying and the
dead every day. I visited the Insurgent
Hospital, where there are many wounded
men. I saw two men with their heads
almost shot off, one man with his body
shot through and through, some with
arms gone and others with legs misslnij.
These are horrible sights, yet such are
the scenes of war.
"The natives are very Ignorant, and to
us are curiosities. The girls marry at 9
years of age and are mothers at ten.
Many of the natives are afflicted with
leprosy. We see thousands of these peo
ple every day. We do not fear them, but
shun them as we would the devil.
"Just to our left is a native village. The
Btreets and fences are decorated with hu
man skulls. To our right is a burying
ground. Human skulls, with flesh and
hair yet attached, are lying all around.
Read Stanley's Darkest Africa' and you
will get a fair idea of our scenes. Snakes
ten to twelve feet long are found in the
jungles, and monkeys chatter in th 3 trees
everywhere.
"I have been through Cavlte and have
seen the forts and the prisons. The entire
city is, in fact, a fortification, even the
private houses being surrounded 'oy mas
sive walls. The prisons contain over 3000
Spaniards, captured by the Insurgents,
who turned them over to our army. The
city is simply beautiful. One can easily
imagine himself in Eden. I cannot nnder
stand why so much suffering should be
inflicted on a place so beautiful.
"I had the honor of meeting Dewey and
speaking to him. He is a perfect gentle
man."
THE ANNUAL VISIT
OF JOHN W. MACKAY
ACCOMPANIED SY HIS SON AND
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.
Society Is Busy Planning Entertain
ments for Mr. and Mrs. Clar
ence H. Mackay.
John W. Mackay, the last of the Bo
nanza kings, and Clarence H. Mackay and
wife arrived yesterday morning on the
Portland express and went at once to the
Palace. Annually the millionaire mining
man comes to the coast to inspect his
large mining interests in California and
Nevada and to cast a supervising eye over
various commercial and corporate busi
nesses which he has in this city.
Mackay, the elder, has not changed any
in appearance since his last visit. He
is enjoying the best of health and seems
to possess the vigor of youth. His bust
ness cares will consume but a small por
tion of his time while here. He will re
main In the State about a month and will
then return to New York.
Clarence H. Mackay and his beautiful
bride will stay in California for an ln
definite time. Mrs. Mackay, formerly
the much courted and idolized society
Queen of New York, has just seen Cali
fornia for the first time, and in the com
pany of her husband she will make a
thorough tour of the State. Before her
marriage she was a Miss Duer, known to
metropolitan society circles as a woman
of dazzling beauty. She is of the bru
nette type, handsome both of figure and
of face. Already local society is plan
ning a number of entertainments for the
young couple.
Clarence Mackay is associated with his
father in a number of big business en
terprises. He will join his father in an
inspection of their common properties and
will also look Into the affairs of the Pos
tal Telegraph Company.
Cruelty to Horses.
On several occasions recently com
plaints have been made to the officers of
the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals that the horses used by
the San Francisco Transfer Company
were in such a condition as to be unfit
for work. Officer McCurry made an in
vestigation yesterday and found that the
complaints were well founded. One pooi
beast was covered with harness sores,
and the driver acknowledged that only
last week it had fallen from exhaustion
while hauling freight to the ferry. An
other horse was found in a similar con
dition. The transfer company hired its
stock from Joost Bros.. 600 Gough street,
and accompanied by Officer Walton the
stables were visited by McCurry. who
arrested Tim Quaid, the foreman, for
cruelty to animals. Quaid said the own
ers of the horses knew of their condition,
and had given orders for them to be
sent out to the transfer company. Mc-
Curry affirms that he will swear out
warrants to-day for the arrest of the
owners of the horses.

anil thereby become its employes, occu
pied every mind and tongue.
A careful summing up of the last state-
INVESTIGATING THE CHARGES.
United States District Attorney Foote and His
Assistants Working on the Case.
The matter of Jurisdiction is at present occupying the major portion of
the time of United States District Attorney Henry S. Foote and his assist
ants, who are busily engag*Â»d at present examining the statement of facts
Mr. Tarpey has placed in their hands which, he alleges, he can prove
against Brune when the Federal Grand Jury takes up the case. The most
important evidence for the prosecution is the letter written by Brune to
H. S. Krigbaum of this city, relative to an exchange of worthless bank
stock for property tn the hands of Kripbaum for negotiation. This letter
is dafcÂ«d January 27. 1897, four days prior to the failure of the bank. The
letter was mailed in Moscow, Idaho, thereby establishing the offense
within the Jurisdiction of the United States courts of the Idaho district.
While it is true that the courts of this district also have Jurisdiction in
the matter, as the letter passed through the postofflces of this State, it is
the opinion of District Attorney Foote that the case should be tried in
Idaho. In which district the bank, through which the offense was com
mitted, was situated. Many other letters, however, relating to the same
swindle have been mailed and delivered within this State and for this rea
pnr the prosecution may proceed within the Jurisdiction of the California
courts.
When Mr. Foote was questioned regarding the case he was very retl
cenj, and was in a humor to deny even that the papers had been presented
to him. "I have made no investigations in the case as yet," he said, "and
do not know whether the Federal Jury will take it up or not. The case can
either be tried here or in Idaho, but I think it would be much better to
have It tried there as that is the place where the crime is alleged to have
been committed and all the witnesses are there. Some of the letters were
mailed in this State, it is true, and that gives us Jurisdiction in the
case but I have not attempted any Investigations yet. I will defer that
until It Is decided where the case will be tried. Of the merits of the case
I have nothing to say. I am a Federal official and cannot talk for the
public. The papers have been handed over to my assistant, Mr. Schles
lnger and he is still studying them. If the case Is tried here it will sim
ply be a case of using the United States mails for fraudulent purpose. I
believe Postofflce Inspector Monroe Is making Investigations but Ido not
know what he has discovered and would not tell if I did."
Mr. Schlesinger said that he had received the papers charging- Brune
with having illegally used the United States malls over a week ago. He
would conclude his investigation of the documents in the next few days
and would then be ready to proceed with the case before the Federal
Grand Jury.
merit Issued by the Bank of Moscow,
through Its officials, connected with the
fact that shortly after its failure the
Comptroller of the Treasury levied an as
sessment of 1100 on each of the 750 shares
of the bank, shows that prior to the fail
ure of the institution its officials had suc
ceeded in gaining personal possession of
all the assets of the bank with the excep
tion of the bank building and the lot o:i
which it stood. "This condition," jaid
Mr. Tarpey yesterday, "can probaMy be
explained by the fact that the building
was tastened to the lot and ihe lot was
naturally a part of the earth."
That Mr. Browne was offlc'a'ily cogni
zant of the issuance of the statement
cannot be denied, as those who have -pre
ferred the charges against him have in
their possession an affidavit sworn to by
J. Q. Jolly, a notary public of Moscow,.
Idaho, which states that Browne person
ally appeared before him and- subscribed
and swore to the statement.
"How in the face of such a palpable
fraud, perpetrated upon gullible capital
iPts by Browne and his brother, the bank
officials managed to . gala the confidence
of the Government officials at Washing
ton and receive appointments to the po-
Eltions they are at present occupying is
past my understanding "said Mr. Tarpey
last evening. "There are many strange
circumstances surrounding the breaking
of the bank and the subsequent reticence
of the officials who took Its affairs in
charge after its collapse. The attorneys
of Edward Byrne, who was one of the
victims of the swindling officials of the
late Moscow Bank, communicated â  with
the receiver of the defunct institution, W.
H. Stufflebaum, asking for a certificate of
the failure of the bank. An answer was
received in due time from the, receiver,
who stated that he was unable or did not
have the authority to. comply with the re
quest. -He referred the attorneys to the
Comptroller of the , Treasury, who, the
stated, was the only official authorized to
furnish the certificate. A communication
containing an application for the certifi
cate was mailed to the Comptroller, â¢ but
he refused also to comply with the re
quest in a letter, brief but to the point,
which follows: :-~;>i â¢â â¢
TREASURY DEPARTMENT. 1*
Office of Comptroller of the Currency,
WASHINGTON, D. C, September 22. 1897.
. Gentlemen: Tour letter of the 10th Inst. is
received requesting on behalf of Edward Byrne
of Palt Lake City, Utah, that I execute a cer-'
tlflcate reÃardlni? certain matters connected
with the Moscow Bunk, Moscow, Idaho, for use
In his proposed suit to set aside a transaction
under an agreement entered Into by him with
â  Clarence M. Hrune to trade certain lands In
DunuiÃO, Mexico, for 150 shares of the capital
etock of the hank.
The draft and certificates enclosed by you are
herewith returned, and I rooÃt respectfully de
cline to comply with your request. Very re
spcetfully, GEORGE M. COFFIN.
Deputy and Acting Comptroller.
"We then found it necessary to apprise
Stephen M. White of the fact of the re
fusal, and he enlisted his services in our
behalf. On June 9 we received the cer
tificate from Senator White and an ac
companying letter stated that the certifi
cate had been obtained after, considerable
difficulty. This certificate, which is now
In our hands, will be used to substantiate
charges I have preferred against Browne
and Brune. In accordance with the pro
visions of the certificate it would have
been impossible for the brothers of dif
ferent names to have been ignorant of
the rotten financial condition of the bank.
The certificate which clinches this con
tention reads:
I. Charles G. Dawes, Comptroller of the Cur
rency of the United States of . America, do
hereby certify that, under the laws of the
United States, known as the "National Rank
Act,'' the Comptroller of the Currency Is given
general supervision over National banks.
Firstâ That on the Ist day of February, 1897,
thr Moscow National Bank of Moscow, Idaho,
failed and suspended business and payment,
and on said day the doors of said bank closed;
that thereafter, namely, on the 4th day of Feb
ruary, 1637. by virtue of the authority vested
In the Comptroller of the Currency by the laws
of the United States, my predecessor In office.
Hon. James H. Eckels, appointed Mr. Eugene
T. Wilson a* temporary receiver of the said
Moscow National Bank, and, upon the resig
nation of said Wilson, the said Comptroller ap
pointed, on March 2, 189", William H. Stuffle
bnum as the receiver of the said bank, his
commission to take effect March 10, 1597, at
which time said receiver took charge of the
bank and continued In charge of said
bank ac receiver until the 3d day of January,
1898. On the 23d day of December. 1897, Will
iam P. Connaway waa appointed receiver of
said bank In place of said William H. Stuffle
baum. and he Is now In charge of said bank
as receiver thereof, his commission having
taken effect January 3. 189 S.
Secondâ That at the time of the failure and
suspension of said bank, a.Â« hereinbefore stated,
Mr. Clarence M. Brune was the cashier of the
said Moscow National EUnk, and had been
such cashier for some time continuously prior
to said suspension, namely, alnce about the
Ist day of February. 1894.
Thirdâ That at the time of the failure and
suspension of the said Moscow National Bank
as aforesaid, said Clarence M. Brune was one
of the directors of said bank, and had been
such director for about three years prior to the
failure and suspension thereof.
Fourthâ LTpon appointing Mr. W. H. Stuf
flebaum receiver of said Moscow National
Hank as above mentioned, my predecessor In
office, Hon. James H. Eckels, directed him to
give notice of the insolvency and failure of
said hank, and calling upon all persons having
claims against said bank to present the same
and to make legal proof thereof.
In witness whereof. I have hereunto set my
hand and caused my official seal to be af-
fixed to these presents at Washington, D. C
this 2d day of June, A. D. 1898.
(Seal) CHARLES O. DAWES.
â Comptroller of the Currency.
"This statement or certificate of fail
ure completed the evidence tending to
establish the guilt of the brothers,"
said Mr. Tarpie. "It proves that
Browne must have been aware of the
financial condition of the bank when
he subscribed to the statements under
oath, and that Briine was also aware
of its tottering condition when he ne
gotiated the valueless stock. The comp
troller, who issued the certificate
states therein the positions occupied by
the brothers and on that statement we
can proceed, I think, to a successful
conclusion."

Now there is the Rat Club, for Instance.
The whole pang: will be there if they
don't land in Jail in the meantime. The
foundation of the Hat Club is lost in tra
dition, but as late as IS9B at Redwood City
it was known as the Mouse Club. It
has grown sinco then, however, and last
year at Nevada City the members sal
lied forth full grown, pestiferous rats.
Like all the species, the rats turn natur

as they escape from the Southern Pa

will scurry to Suzzalo's cellar, down on
South Market street, where they will be

case goods preferred. For the purpose
of putting the authorities and residents
of San Jose on their guard The Call gives
the names of such officers and members
as are known to the local police. There's
Billy Miller, high rat (also high ball);
Jim "Webster, low rat (and everything
else); Billy, Goodwin, rat terrier (he is pe
culiarly useful as outside sentinel); Afy,
quel Quinne, grand electrocutor; Fuss
Galnes, the knocker; Charlie Buck, the
Potrero wharf rat; Louie Barman, agita

Jones, exalted wearer of the made-to
order regalia; Billy Cranna, exalted cus
todian of the can; Al White, bearer of the
spigot and corkscrew; Joe Keenan, su
preme elevator of rats (and archenemy
of civilization); Dick Barton, the pied
piper of Hamlln; Bob Martland, the water
rat; Lew Byington (very ratty), and
Charlie Mooser, royal dissector. If there
are any more they are safely caged.
Then there are the Curly Bears who in
habit Cave No. 5. where they will hold a
Grand Growl on the night of the 9th and
a 8 far into the following day as an out

GREATEST ACTIVITY
AT THE GARDEN CITY
Admission Day Festivities Will Be
Conducted on a Scale of
Grandeur.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 6.â A1l arrangements
for receiving the Native Sons and Daugh
ters on Admission day are nov/ complete,
and the various committees of the local
parlors are eagerly awaiting the opening
of the greatest Admission day celebra
tion evÂ»r held In California. Already
many strangers are to be seen on our
streets, but the great rush of visitors
will not commence until Thursday morn-
Ins. Some forty parlors of Sons and
Daughters have secured headquarters,
and here true California hospitality -will
be extended to all. Friday will be the
greatest day San Jose has ever had, and
the great street parade, with Its thou
sands of California's fairest sons and I
daughters, will be an Imposing spectacle.
The people of the Garden City will re
ceive the visitors in grand style. No
one will be allowed to want for enjoy
ment. Besides the interesting programme
prepared for the three-day celebration
there will be entertainments of other
i kinds. The people will vie with one an
i other in helping entertain, and many prl
i vate parties will be held In honor of va
rious guests.
The orchards are full of fruit, and this
will be a novel sight to many. Drives
through the suburban sections with a
taste of the valley's luscious fruits will
amply repay those from less fortunate
I counties. The afternoons of Saturday
and Sunday have really been arranged for
this pleasure.
Decoration of the stores and streets has
commenced, and when completed the flags
and banners will have transformed the
city into holiday attire. No attempt will
be made to carry on business during the
festivities, and the whole community will
no.p to make the event the success It is
sure to be.
The 9th will be the principal day. On
that morning- occurs the great parade of
the Native Sons and Daughters. Liter
ary exercises and a reception at the
court house will follow, with a grand ball
in the evening.
There will be nothing slow or dull on
the two succeeding days. Saturday morn
ing there will be a bullshead breakfast
and Sunday a clambake. In the after
noons there will be baseball games, bi
cycle races and other entertainments
Various parlors are making arrange
ments to outdo each other in the parade
; Among these is La Estrella Parlor of Na
tive Daughters, which will make an ex
ceptionally fine showing.

verdict last evening In favor of August
G. Price, administrator of the estate of
hie wife, Mary D. Price, for 1750 dam
ages against the Market Street Railway
Company. Mrs. Price was killed on De
cember 2 last by an electric car of the
Third street line at the crossing of Ever
ett street. The defense was tnat the com
pany was in no way to blame, as Mrs.
Price ran in front of the car while at
tempting to get out of the way of a pass
ing truck. The verdict came as a sur
prise, inasmuch as the Coroner's jury had
found the motorman and company blame
less for the unfortunate accident.
CHIEF LEES
HEEDED NOT
Lively Scrap Outside His
Office Door.
LASTED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
B. McCLASKIE AND J. CROWLET
THE COMBATANTS.
Although the Noise Was Deefecinjj
No One Appeared With a
Star to Make an
Arrest.
Chief Lees was so busy yesterday after
noon delving into the mysteries of the
Botkin poisoning: case that he heeded not
the noisy tumult in the corridor outside
the door of his office, although it was
enough to wake the dead.
Two men, surrounded by an excited
crowd, fought desperately for a few min
utes, and neither the Chief nor any of his
minions in the "upper office" thought it
worth the trouble to inquire what the row
was all about.
There was a case in Judge Joachimsen's
court yesterday afternoon, August Harry,
a driver for the Oakland dairy, appearing
as complaining witness against Robert
McClaskie. another driver for the dairy,
on the charge of stealing $50 from his
trousers pockets on the night of August
8. Harry, McClaskie and four other driv
ers occupy # a large bedroom in the barn
at the dairy. They had engaged in a crap
game for three nights and Harry was un
lucky. He gave up on the third night, but
had $50 left, which he put in his trousers
pocket before going to bed. Next morn
ing the money was gone, and from infor
mation he received he had McClaskie ar
rested. Several witnesses were examined
on each side and the Judge dismissed the
case, as there was not sufficient evidence
to convict the accused.
McClaskie felt mad over his arrest, and
when he left the court room he waited for
Harry, who came out accompanied by
J. Crowley. one of his witnesses. Mc-
Claskie tackled them as they walked
along the corridor, talking loudly and fol
lowed by a large crowd. When opposite
the Chiefs office McClaskie called Crow
ley a liar and Crowley shot out his right
fist and hit McClaskie on the nose, bring
ing the "claret." McClaskie squared off
and landed on Crowley's nose, which also
began to bleed. Then for five minutes it
was give and take, and when they were
separated they were both bleeding like
stuck pigs.
The noise while the scrap lasted was
heard nearly all over the building, as the
friends of the fighters urged them on In
tones that were far from gentle, but no
one with a star made his appearance, and
the men and their friends left the hall,
possibly to fight it out in a less publio
place.
It was almost impossible for the Chief
and those In the "upper office" not to
have heard the racket, but if they did
they took no notice of it. Policeman Wag
ner, who is In charge of the corridors,
happened to be In the Treasurer's office
at the time, as it was a few minutes be
foro the closing hour.
