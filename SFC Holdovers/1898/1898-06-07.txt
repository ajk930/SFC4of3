TERRIFIC BOMBARDMENT OF SANTIAGO
AND DEADLY FIGHTING ABOUT MANILA.

TO ROUT THE
SPANISH FOE
Outposts at Manila Cap
tured With Great
Slaughter.
MANILA, May 31 (via Hongkong, June
6). â The Spanish outposts bave been
driven in all along the line simultaneously
and wit!) great slaughter. It is said over
a thousand hjave been killed. Tr;ere hjas
been fierce hand to band fighting for sev
enty hours, despite trje typhoon which is
raging.
The violent winds and torrents of rain
render tr;e rifles of the Spanish troops
unavailing. The natives easily win at
every step with; trjeir slashing K nj ves.
To-day t\)e insurgents F)old Malabon,
Tarlac and Bacoor They are now at
tacKing San Tomas and Morlate, the
suburbs of the city, wfycb is completely
encircled for a distance of seven n)iles.
A native regiment under Colonel Aguin
aldo, cousin of the insurgent leader, yes
terday joined tfye insurgents. Trjree
rockets were dropped into the city to
day. They are supposed to have beer; a
signal for tr;e natives.
The Governor has issued a de
spairing proclamation, begging
the insurgents to come to terms,
and meanwhile he is arranging to
remove all the Spanish popula
tion inside the old walled city.
He is filling the moats, testing
the drawbridges and placing
strong guards on the principal
streets and artillery along the
walls. All the other troops are
camping in the suburbs. The
weather is terrific.
LATER â It now appears that
the rockets yesterday were not
signals to the natives, but a warn
ing from the German Consulate
of the approach of the typhoon,
issued for the benefit of ships in
the harbor.
I visited Cavite without the
Spaniards knowing it and found
there 197 wounded and 56 pris
oners, among the latter six Span
ish officers. All were well treated.
Chief Aguinaldo, in the course
of an interview, has said that the
insurgents are eager to rush
upon Manila forthwith, but that
Admiral Dewey refuses to "allow
hordes of passionate semi-sav
ages to storm a civilized metrop
olis." Admiral Dewey wants to
await the arrival of the American
troops. In the meantime the in
surgents have been forbidden to
cross the Molate River, seven
miles south of Manila. "Other
wise the Petrel will be stationed
there to bombard them.
The volunteers smelt powder
yesterday. An officer was killed
and three wounded. They re
tired rapidly. One German resi
dent has enlisted with the volun
teers.
HONGKONG, June 6.âDis
patches from Manila dated June
I and 3. report heavy fighting,
the rebels driving back the gar
rison with heavy losses. General
AguinaMo's cousin was shot, as
he refused to fight. Foreigners
are moving to ships in the bay.
LONDON, June 7.â The
Hongkong correspondent of the
Standard says: Advices from
The San Francisco Call
Manila say Admiral Dewey has
gathered the steamers now
blockaded in the river to lie off
Cavite in readiness to receive for
eigners. The Spaniards are los
ing arms, ammunition and field
pieces almost daily, so persistent
are the rebel attacks. The natives
are flocking to Aguinaldo's stan
dard. He is, on the whole, con
ducting the campaign on hu
mane principles. In the course
of a pitched battle on May 30 a

serted the Spanish lines for the
insurgents. From the general
tenor of the news from Manila
there is a right to believe that the
city will fall into Dewey's hands
before the arrival of the Ameri
can troops.
HONGKONG, June 6.â The
British gunboat Swift, which has
just arrived from Manila, reports
ONE OF THE FORTS IN SANTIAGO HARBOR UNDER BOMBARDMENT,
that the insurgents have cut the
railways outside the town and
advanced to within four miles of
the city.
A Spanish regiment mutinied
and shot its officers.
Fighting between the insur
gents and the Spanish troops is
frequent, and the former brought
1000 prisoners to Cavite.
The Americans, it is reported
at Manila, assist the insurgents
with boats and machine guns.
The Swift repeats a rumor that
the insurgents had captured and
tortured a number of priests. The
British residents, at the time the
Swift left, remained in Manila,

American Troops Said to
Have Landed Near
Aguadores.
PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, June 6.âAd
vices received here to-day show that the
bombardment at Santiago de Cuba was re
sumed this morning by the American fleet.
It is said that the Americans succeeded
in forcing the harbor, having first destroyed
the wreck of the Merrimac, which they
sank on Friday morning to prevent the es
cape of the Spanish squadron.
After entering the harbor they engaged
the Spanish warships, and after hot fight
ing sank two of them. It is reported that
one of the American vessels was damaged,
but this cannot be confirmed.
The United States auxiliary cruiser St.
Louis, which is acting as a dispatch boat
for Admiral Sampson, has arrived at Mole
St. Nicholas.
MOLE ST. NICHOLAS, Hayti, June 6.â
News of the successful landing Saturday of
5000 American troops a few miles west of
Santiago de Cuba was brought here by the
auxiliary cruiser St. Louis, which arrived
to-day.
There were three regiments and three
batteries of artillery, several heavy siege
guns and a force of engineers.
No confirmation was received to-day of
the reported naval engagement off Jean Ra
bel, on the northwest coast of Hayti. The
officers of the St. Louis do not believe any
such engagement could have taken place.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayti,
June 6. â A dispatch which has
just been received from Santiago
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
de Cuba states that the Ameri
cans have made another attack;
upon the Spanish defenses. The
firing began at 7:45 o'clock this
morning, and in a few minutes
the cannonading became general,
showing that all the batteries
and the forts at the entrance of
the harbor and all the American
fleet were engaged.
The firing was not only at the
entrance of the port, but it was
evident that the Americans were
attacking further down the coast,
for the sounds of the cannonad
ing came from the direction of
Aguadores, to the eastward of
Morro.
Some of the military authori
ties at Santiago contended that
this firing at Aguadores denoted
that the Americans were attempt
ing to land troops under the fire
of their ships, but there was noth
ing to confirm their opinion.
The firing continued to in
crease in violence, and at 8:35
o'clock, when this dispatch was
sent, it was still going on with
much fury. The Spaniards were
evidently making a gallant de
fense. The batteries and forts
are so far from the city that it
was impossible to learn any de
tails of the fighting. There was
much excitement in the city.
PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti,
June 6. â I have just received
news of the landing of a large
force of American troops a few
miles west of Santiago de Cuba.
The landing was aided by a force
of insurgents, with whom a coali
tion had been made, and who at
tacked the Spanish batteries
while the fleet outside bombard-2
Ed the fortifications and earth
works.
It was reported to-day (but the
report lacks confirmation) that
the American squadron forced an
entrance into the harbor of San
tiago. The report added that
the Cristobal Colon and an
other Spanish vessel were sunk,
and that an American ship,
whose name cannot be learned,
was blown up.
CAPE HAYTIEN, June 6.â
The ball has 6pened in earnest.
The first general advance of the
navy and army against Cuba be
gan this morning, and when the
signal "Cease firing" flutters
from the masthead of Sampson's
.flagship Morro Castle and Fort
Socapa, at the entrance to San
tiago harbor, will be piles of
ruins.
A general bombardment of the
fortifications began at 7:45 this
morning. Fifteen minutes later
the cannonading had grown ter
rific.
It is believed that all the bat
tle-ships in the squadron are in
the engagement. It is said that
troops were landed during the
bombardment of the forts at
Aguadores, five miles east of
Morro, and it is probable that
they attacked the castle from the
land side. It is also probable that
troops were landed near Socapa,
on the west side.
NEW YORK, June 6.âAspe
cial from Kingston, Jamaica, re
ports that 5000 troops have land
ed near Punta Cabrera, a little to
the west of Santiago de Cuba,
where a junction was effected
with General Calixto Garcia's
army of 3000 insurgents. It is
added that the landing was ef
fected under cover of a fire from
Admiral Sampson's fleet. With
the troops were several heavy
siege guns.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayti,
June 6. â The cannonade at Agu
adores began at 7:45 this morn
ing. It became stronger at 7:55,
both sides seeming to put forth
every possible effort. It grew
more violent, and at 8:45 a. m.
â¢was still in progress.
HAVANA, June 6, 7 p. m. â
At 8 o'clock this morning twenty
four vessels of the American fleet
opened fire upon the forts at the
entrance of the Santiago harbor
and along the coast line. The
firing ceased about 11 o'clock.
.Further details are not yet
known here.
Yesterday Colonel Aldea, with
a Spanish force, sustained a fire
near Punta Cabrera from the in
surgents on the land side and
from the American warships.
The Spanish forces are well
entrenched on the line from Si
boney to Aguadores, and to-day
they checked an attempt of the
American forces to land and re
.pelled them.
. LONDON, June 7.â A dis
patch to the Financial News
from Cape Haytien, dated Mon
day, says:
At daylight this morning the
American troops landed at Agua
dores, a few miles east of Santi
ago de Cuba, under cover of Ad
miral Sampson's guns. The bat
teries were silenced after a sharp
bombardment.
PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN
MADE FOR THE ATTACK
Delay Caused by a Misunderstanding
on the Part of the
Spaniards.
ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL
DISPATCH BOAT OFF SANTIAGO
DE CUBA, via Kingston, Jamaica,
June 6. â When I left the squadron un
der Rear Admiral Sampson in front of
Santiago de Cuba yesterday plans had
been made for an attack on the town
to-day. The assault was to have taken
place yesterday, but was postponed.
"We were billed to smash the Cuban
outfit," Captain "3ob" Evans of the
lowa told me. "All the plans for the
bombardment had been made. The
ships were cleared for action and every
thing was ready, when a delay was or
dered. This delay was probably due to
the appearance of a Spanish launch
bearing a flag of truce, which started
from the cruiser Almirante Oquendo
Just about the time the order for the
bombardment was to have been given.
The Spanish officer in command of the
launch said it was thought on the
Oquendo that a signal flag had been
displayed on the lowa. As soon as he
learned his mistake he returned to
his ship."
â¢ The Resolute has reached the fleet
with ammunition and supplies. There
Is no doubt among the officers of the
squadron that a Spanish torpedo boat
destroyer waa sunk last night.

NEW YORK, June 6.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Another American scout is to
be made at once into a formidable aux
iliary cruiser. Instructions telegraphed
to-day to Newport News by Acting
Secretary Allen directed that six 5-inch
guns be supplied to the Yale, former
ly the Paris, of the American line, and
that she be furnished with 300 rounds
of ammunition. On account of the
necessity of returning her to active
service at the earliest possible moment,
Mr. Allen ordered that the work of
placing guns be completed by Satur
day. These rush orders will prevent
the construction of a magazine in the
ship and her ammunition will be de
posited in the hold. It will be impos
sible to provide the machinery of the
ship with protection, and this will be
done at a more convenient season.
Naturally, as to the destination of
reached here from Santiago de Cuba
to-day that during the bombardment
by the American fleet the Spanish
cruiser Cristobal Colon was sunk. The
report Is dated at Santiago, Saturday,
June 4. It states that yesterday (Fri
day) evening the American fleet re
opened fire on the batteries at Santiago.
The firing continued from half-past 10
o'clock until half-past 11 o'clock, but
the result of the bombardment is not
given. During the entire day the
American fleet had a cruiser in front
of the harbor. The correspondent who
sent the report says he counted twenty
American vessels on Friday. On Sat
urday there were sixteen other vessels
and these are believed to have brought
arms and ammunition for use in the
operations against the Spanish forces.
RUMOR OF A NAVAL
BATTLE OFF JEAN RABEL
ThreÂ«t Spanish and Four American
Warships Said to Have
Been Engaged.
Copyrighted, 189 S. by James Gordon Bennett.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayli, June 6.â A
dispatch from Mole St. Nicholas says:
There is a rumor here that a naval bat

between three Spanish warships and
four Americans. After a short fight the
Americans withdrew. This news is not
confirmed.
SPANISH VERSIONS
OF LATE WAR NEWS
Senor Giron Admits the Government
Cannot Confirm the Blowing
Up of the Baltimore.
MADRID, June 6.â ln the Chamber
of Deputies to-day Senor Giron, the
Minister for the Colonies, replying to
inquiries on the subject, said the Gov
ernment had no information tending to
confirm the Spanish report that the
United States cruiser Baltimore had
been blown up by an internal explo
sion at Manila, except the fact that
Lloyd's Gazette "had erased the Balti
more from its list of American â hips."
Deputy Comas ask^d if a note had
been sent to the powers "pointing ( >ut
the American violation* of interna
tional law." and hi urged the Govern
ment to Include in such communica
tion the fact that the "Americans had
furnished arms to an almost savage
race in the Philippine Islands."
Senor Giron declined tx say whether
or not a note had been sent.
The Minister of Finance. Senor Puig
cerv;er, replying to criticisms in the
Senate to-day on the raining of a new
loan, declared that the present situa
tion, or the needs of war, necessitated
the measure.
PLANS FOR AN ATTACK

Spanish Boat Tries In Vain to
Discharge a Deadly Tor
pedo.
KET WEST, Fla., June 6.â 1 learned to-night from an offlber Just
In from the fleet at Santiago the details of an attack made Friday
night on four of Admiral Sampson's ships. The Dolphin saw a long
black vessel stealing toward her when she was about three miles east
of Santiago, and made out at once a torpedo boat. She let go imme
diately, and then three other warships cruising eastward dashed up
to her and all four ships began cannonading. The boat at which they
fired proved as elusive as a moonbeam. It scooted about as though
a phantom, but Its speed, color and movements made them sure the
Spaniards were trying to torpedo them. For twenty minutes they kept
up the fire, but their target dashed away as soon as the gunners
thought they had their pieces trained. Time and again it started In
toward them, but the shower of shellÃ forced It to retreat, and at last
it vanished In the darkness off shore.

the Yale the authorities are silent. I
understand she will join the St. Louis
In patrol work and no surprise need be
expressed if these two vessels are not
shortly reported cruising off the Span
ish coast, endeavoring to learn any
thing of value concerning Spanish
movements, which would be tele
graphed to Washington.
The desire of the authorities to arm
without delay the auxiliary cruisers of
the American line is another indication
of their intention to put the vessels
into condition to be drafted Into a fly
ing squadron which may be dispatched
to Spanish waters when operations
against Santiago and the Spanish fleet
are concluded.
The four auxiliary cruisers, with their
great coal capacity, would enable the
squadron's stay at sea for some time,
and this, the officials say, is one of the
greatest advantages in favor of the for
mation of such a fleet.
VICTORY FOR
REPUBLICANS

Oregon.
FIVE THOUSAND MAJORITY
STATE TICKET ELECTED IN ITS
ENTIBETY.
Gold Standard Platform Triumphs
Against a Combination of Silver
Fusionists.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., June 6.â The State
election to-day resulted in a victory
for the entire Republican State ticket.
T. T. Geer, Republican, for Governor,
will have a plurality of at least 3000
and may be larger. The Republicans
have elected a majority of the Legis
lature, which will insure the election
of a Republican United States Sena
tor to fill the vacancy now existing
from this State.
M. A. Moody is elected Congressman
from the Second District, and the in
dications are that T. H. Tongue will
be elected from the First District.
At 11:30 Chairman G. A. Steel of the
Republican State Central Committee
gave out the following:
"The Republicans have carried the
State by at least 5000 majority, the
county and city ticket in Portland, cer
tainly the Second Congressional district
and probably the First, though returns
are bo slow from the First district that
positive announcement cannot be
made."
Loss than 1000 votes out of a total of
16,000 in this city had been counted at
10 o'clock to-night. Geer, Republican
for Governor, has 425 to 300 for King,
FuÃionist, out of the votes counted.
Mason, Republican, for Mayor of this
city, is probably elected by 1000 plural
ity. Owing to the length of the ticket
hunting proceeds very slowly.
The Oregonian will say to-morrow*
"The Republicans claim they have car
ried Oregon by not less than 5000 ma
jority. This result has been gained on
a platform distinctly declaring for a
gold standard and against free coinage
of silver. At Portland the Republicans
have elected the Mayor and claim the
whole legislative ticket."
Fire in a Barn.
An alarm was turned In at 11 o'clock
last night from box 238. The fire was in
the barn of Farnsworth &. Ruggles at
Nebraska and Mariposa streets, which
was damaged to the extent of $1000. The
cause of thÂ« flre is unknown.

but the foreigners were taking
refuge on the foreign shipping.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press at Manila, under date of June 2,
says:
"I have traversed the whole region
of fighting during tho last three days,
in 6pite of the prohibition. I found
the insurgents strongly posted at Ca
loocan, eight miles north of Manila, and
at Bacoor, the tame distance south.
To the east I found nothing in the way
of insurgent intrenchments. The Span
lards hold the whole Pasig River
(which flows into the bay immediately
below the town of Manila) to the la
goon. The two sections of the insur
gent forces signal their movements
with fire balloons.
"To the northward the rising is gen
eral and the Spaniards are few. The
railway has been cut in several places
and the English overseers have been
warned off. To the southward there
has been fierce fighting on the Zapote
River, between Bacoor and Las Pinas.
"The biggest battle of the present
campaign was fought last Tuesday. The
Insurgents attacked on the left branch
of Zapote, waded across amid a ty
phoon, stormed the banks for several
miles and carried the Spanish trenches
with knives.
"Yesterday (June 1) they tried the
right branch of the Zapote, but failed.
The Spaniards employed artillery all
day, but no casualties are reported. To
day there have been only ineffective
skirmishes.
"The country is densely wooded and
swampy. Both parties Bhoot aimless
ly. I got in the middle of the 'irinjr,
but nobody was hurt. Nothing was
visible in the tremendous fusillade, and
I believe nobody knew what he was
shooting at. Both sides were 'duffers.'
The insurgents, however, are excellent
in a melee. The Spaniards say they
were victorious yesterday, but that
they cannot follow up the victory and
annihilate the rebels, because of the
American warships at Cavite. More
over, they say it is necessary to save
their energies for the American troops.
Meanwhile the vicinit- of Manila iR an
impenetrable network of ambuscades."
MONADNOCK WILL
SAIL WITHIN TEN DAYS
Navy Department to Purchase a Ship
to Accompany the
Monitor.
"WASHINGTON, June 6.â The Navy
Department gave orders to-day that
the double-turreted monitor Monad
nock, now at Mare Island. Cal., should
be made ready to sail for Manila within
ten days, and the necessary orders
were hurriedly telegraphed. The Mon
terey will not wait for the company of
the Monadnock. but should beÂ»off in the
course of a few hours under the con
voy of the Brutus. The Navy Depart
ment will Immediately procure another
merchant ship to accompany the Mon
adnock on her 6000-mile voyage.
The Monadnock Is a most powerful
double-turreted monitor. With twin
screws and 3000 horsepower engines,
she is easily able to make 12M. knots an
hour. Built on the general lines of the
Amphitrite. she has better engines and
more power than that monitor. She
carries four 10-inch guns in two tur
rets, besides two 4-inch rapid-fire guns
In a casement and a numerous second
ary battery. Her coal capacity is 250
tons in bunkers and almost as much
more stowage room can be found on
the decks. Consequently the Monad
nock has the ability to make a longer
cruise than the Monterey without re
plenishing her coal supply, yet her ca
pacity is still too small to permit her
to make the passage from Honolulu to
the Philippines unaided. With these
two monitors Admiral Dewey will be
fully able to take care of himself, even
should the much-talked-of Cadiz fleet
undertake to attack him in Manila har
bor.
TREACHERY AMONG THE
PHILIPPINE REBELS
Many Insurgents Eager to Win the
Price Set Upon the Head
of Aguinaldo.
MANILA, May 27, via Hongkong,
June 6. â Reports are rife of treachery
; among the rebels. Their origin may
be Spanish, but I believe many former
rebels are anxious to Rain the reward
of $25,000 offered for General Agufcialdo,
dead or alive. The rebel leader, Jok-
Bon. has been betrayed by his party
and shot. Their excuse was that they
Buspected Jokson of being a Spanish
spy. The former rebel, Trias, former
ly secretary to Aguinaldo and now a
major of native militia, loyal to Spain,
has promised to capture Aguinaldo
dead or alive.
The American admiral and generals
had better rely on their own resources.
After their first Buccess the natives will
flock to their banner.
Riots continue in the provinces of
Pagaslnan, Zambales and La Union.
The rebels have burned many cor vents
and churches. They killed four Span
lards and one priest In La Union.
Former Rebel Baldemero Aguinaldo
has been shot by Trias for refusing to
operate against his cousin, Emilio
Baldemero, a former active rebel, who
has become commander of the native
militia loyal to Spain.

Democratic primaries were held through

result of to-day's primaries is equivalent
to an election, and great interest is mani
fested. The three candidates for Gover
nor are Allan D. Chandler, Robert L.
Berner and Spencer T. Atkinson. Advices
from many counties' in various parts of
the State Indicate that Chandler is In the
lead. Berner is running a close second
and Atkinson is a poor third. The vote
is lighter than expected.

by the Collier iQ the

ON BOARD HERALD-CALL DISPATCH-BOAT, OFF SANTIAGO
DE CUBA, via Port Antonio, June 6.â The Herald-Call dispatch-boat
crept in toward the blocked channel of Santiago's harbor and went
within two miles of Morro Castle. Enough was seen to indicate that
there is some doubt whether the sunken Merrimac blocks the channel
completely.
An excellent view of the wreck was obtained. About ten feet of
her smokestack and mast could be seen. She lies in about seven
fathoms of water, but not directly across the channel, and it looks as
if a large vessel might pass around her. It would be comparatively
easy for the Spaniards to blow her up and clear the channel, but they
will probably not do so, as she prevents ingress as well as egress, and
increases their security.

at the instance of Detective Kellert at
the house of the Consul General of
Spain.
Magistrate La Fontaine to-day hon
orably discharged Detective Kellert
from custody on the charge of stealing
the now famous letter from Lieutenant
Carranza. Immediately afterward Kel
lert's lawyer took steps to take out a
damage suit for $25,000 jointly and
severally against Senors Dubosc and
Carranza for false arrest. The money
they have in the Bank of Montreal will
be garnishced and leave will be asked
to seize their personal property before
Judgment, so as to have a guarantee on
their part for costs.
LONDON, June 6.â The United States
Embassador, Colonel Hay, called at the
Foreign Office to-day and presented
evidence of the Spanish officials making
Canada the base of hostile operations
and protested against the continuance
of this practice. The protest is based
on the fact that It would be a breach
of neutrality^ for Great Britain to per
mit her territory to be used for such
purposes. * Colonel Hay also recently
drew the attention of the Foreign Office
to small exportation* from Great Brit
ain of war munitions intended for
Spain. W
SECURES A BRIEF RESPITE.
WASHINGTON, June 6.â Lieutenant
Carranz;i uml Senor Dttboac, who are
conducting their Spanish operations
from Montreal, have succeeded in ob
taining a brief respite from expulsion
through the denial by Carranza of the
accuracy of certain features of the let
ter attributed to him. The British au
thorities acted on the assumption that
the translation of the Carra..za letter
was correct 'and that there was no
doubt that the Spanish officials were
using Canada as a base for hostile ac
tion against the United States. But
since a question is raised as to the ac
curacy of the translation no step is
likely to be taken toward forcible ex
pulsion until the translation is estab
lished as correct. The British authori
ties have been ready from the outset to
act on a well-established case, but the
expulsion of a foreigner is such a seri
ous matter that it is said no such step
would be proper while the evidence was
open to question. The v. arranza denial
raises a question of veracity which can
be readily settled by the production of
the original letter. This is not in the
possession of the State Department,
but it is understood to be in the hands
of the secret service branch of the
Treasury Department. When the ac
curacy of the translation is established
the British authorities will act
promptly. ________________

MANY WOUNDED IN AFFRAYS
ANNIVERSARY OF SHOOTING OF
'86 CAUSES STRIFE.
Exciting Encounters Prolonged Near
Belfast Until After Midnight,
and Troops Are Called Out
to Restore Order.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BELFAST, June 6.â During the cele
bration of the annivarsary of June 6,
1886, when seven civilians were shot on
Shank Hill Road by the constabulary,
the Nationalist procession, while re
turning this evening from Hannans
town, was broken up in a riot. Several
thousand Orangemen in the Shank
Hill Road attacked and overpowered
the police and chased them back into
the broad square barracks. Several
mounted constables were severely in
jured and one had his leg broken. The
police reinforcements which arrived
were compelled to threaten the crowd
with their revolvers before they were
able to rescue their comrades from the
fury of the mob, which took up the
street for missiles. The troops were
then called out, but the mob cheered
them and sang "Rule Britannia."
The disturbances then ceased, though
the excitement continued. The feeling
of the Orangemen against the police is
very bitter. Many civilians were in
jured. A score of arrests were made.
MIDNIGHT.â The riots have been re
newed, and at a late hour this evening
the troops were compelled to charge
mobs numbering several thousand.
The rioters stoned the police and
tr<"ijis.
When Shank Hill was cleared the
crowds gathered In the side streets.
Altogether this was the worst rioting
that has occurred since 1886. It was
prolonged until midnight, and at this
hour the city is still in a dangerous
state of excitement.
Over fifty policemen have been in
jured, and twenty-four have been
taken to the hospitals with fractured
skulls and severe scalp wounds.
Many civilians were injured in the
charges, some daneerously. The mili
tary are now in practical occupation of
Shank Hill. It is feared that there will
be a renewal of the rioting.

EMBARK FOR
PORTO RICO
An Inspection of Facilities
at Jacksonville and
Miami, Fla.
Some Trying Problems for Gen
eral Merritt to Regulate in
the Philippines.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 6.
There are strong indications that the
War Department is arranging to em
bark the Porto Rico expedition within
a very few days. It has been the un
derstanding that the troops to be sent
to Pan Juan would leave from Jackson
ville in preference to Tampa, or any
other gulf port, owing to the shortening
of the stean.lng distance thus effected.
It was learned to-day that Secretary
Alger on Saturday dispatched his mili
tary aid. Major George H. Hopkins, on
a secret mission, the object of which is
now known to be to inspect the ship
ping facilities of Jacksonville and
Miami. Fla., with a view to determin
ing which place promises to make the
best base for operations against Porto
Rico. Major Hopkins is under orders
to complete the inspection at the earli
est possible date and to report in full
by telegraph. It is thought his recom
mendation may be received by the de
partment within forty-eight hours. In
the meantime the troops at Tampa
have been ordered to "prepare to go on
board transports," an order which is
interpreted here tf> mean that the War
Department wants to have them In
readiness to move at the earliest mo
ment, but with a view to their trans
portation across the State either to
Jacksonville or Miami.
The advance guard of the expedition
to Santiago is believed to be at least
half way to the Windward Passage.
Indeed, a special from Kingston, Ja
maica, reports thnt 5000 United States
troops have landed near Punta Cabre
ra, to the west of Santiago. The War
Department denies the accurary of this
report and also of the statement con
tained in a special from Cape Haytien,
TO PROTECT
THIS COAST
Provision Made by the
Naval Officials.
RUSH ORDERS TO KIRKLAND
WORK ON THE YORKTOWN TO
BE HURRIED.
Flans to Guard Against Attack by
Auxiliary Cruisers Fitted
Out by the
Spanish.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Orders were
telegraphed to Rear Admiral Kirkland,
commanding the Mare Island Navy
Yard, this afternoon, directing him to
expedite with all dispatch the work of
preparing the gunboat Yorktown for
service. This action is due to a desire
of the authorities to place upon the
Pacific Coast n force which will be able
to defend it against possible attack by
one of the auxiliary cruisers which
Spain is fitting out for service. While
the authorities have no Information
showing it to be the intention of the
Madrid Government to send either the
Columbia or the Normannia into the
Pacific, these vessels have been con
verted into rather formidable auxiliary
cruisers.
The cruiser Philadelphia will be com
missioned on July 1, and It is proposed
to have the Yorktown ready for ser
vice within a couple of months. At
present Rear Admiral Millar's flag flies
from the masthead of the Fish Com
mission vessel Albatross, and besides
this vessel he has under his command
five revenue cutters and three tugs.
The department daily expects to hear
of the successful test of the torpedo
boat Rowan, being constructed at Port
land, Or., and she will be added to his
fleet. The torpedo boat Davis has been
launched at Portland, Or. She is 90 per
cent completed, and it is expected that
within the next month she will have
undergone her official trial and be plac
ed In commission. With these vessels
it 1b believod in department circles the
cities of the Pacific Coast would be
adequately protected, notwithstanding
the dispatching of the monitors Mon
terey and Monadnock and the cruiser
Charleston for Manila, and the Mohi
can for Honolulu, and the prospective
dispatching of the gunboat Bennlngton
from Honolulu to Manila.
SANTIAGO BOMBARDED
ON SATURDAY NIGHT
. MADRID, June 6.â A dispatch to the
Imparcial from Santiago de Cuba says
that at 10 o'clock on Saturday evening
twenty American warships opened a
hot attack on Santiago de Cuba, 'but
that they were so distant that their
shots did not reach the forts. .
The dispatch adds that, seeing the fu
tility of the â  enemy's cannonade the
Spaniards made no reply to the fire,
awaiting the nearer approach of the
ships, but the attacking fleet continued
to remain in , Its distant position. .. .
The dispatch * further says the bom
bardment lasted forty minutes and
was not resumed. '," On Sunday, it :con
tinues, sixteen American warships were
still- moored at the same plaoo, in sight
of. Santiago de Cuba. ' J
which says that at daylight this morn-
Ing, under cover of Admiral Sampson's
guns, a force of United States troops
were landed at Aguadores, a short dis
tance east of Santiago harbor. These
reports, it is surmised, may be prema
ture and based upon nothing more sub
stantial than an imperfect knowledge
of the Government's plans, but the*v is
little doubt the incidents thus fore
shadowed will be fully realized within
a few days.
A statement was made in an authori
tative quarter to-day that troops for
the land siege of Santiago would arrive
in the vicinity of that port within the
next three days. If this is correct the
transports must be already on the way.
There is some talk at the War De
partment of sending additional troops
to San Francisco for the Philippine ex
pedition. The understanding is that
the Sixth Illinois. Sixth Massachusetts
and the Eighth Ohio, now at Camp Al
ger, will be ordered to the Pacific Coast
for duty at Manila. The regiments re
lieved by them will be sent to the re
serve camp near San Francisco for
equipment and drill, and will be held as
a reserve force.
General Merritt will have some Inter
esting work to do as soon as he reaches
Manila In the way of revising the sys
tem of taxation there. Spain has been
receiving half a million dollars a year
from the Philippine Islands by renting
out the privilege to sÂ» 11 opium. That
privilege will be immediately abolished,
but opium will pay a heavy duty. Per
mission to carry on cock fighting,
which is one of the principal amuse
ments of the natives, has been rented
by Spain to a company which paid
$149,039 annually for the privilege. The
Spanish Government's pro-fit on lotter
ies in the island aggregated over half
a million dollars annually. The tax on
onok fighting and profits from lotteries
and raffles will be immediately abol
ished.

General Collis, Back From the Old

Amazed at Our Fight

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: General
Charles H. T. Collis of New York, who
commanded a brigade in the Army of
the Potomac, is In this city. He recent
ly returned from a four months' tour
of Europe, durln" which he had un
usual facilities for acquainting himself
with the Continental armies. During
the course of a talk with him this even
ing he said:
"Since my return from Europe two
weeks ago I have been In Washington
most of the time. While abroad I was
in Spain and saw the recruiting for the
Cuban army; in Egypt I saw British
troops moving to join General Kitch
ener up the Nile; In Turkey I saw the
army which defeated the Greeks; at
Vienna I was present at the Emperor's
review of 20,000 picked soldiers; in Ber
lin I had frequent opportunities to see
the Emperor, his staff and his wonder-
ful military establishment, and on the
island of Crete I had an opportunity to
compare them all, so that I came home
greatly impressed with the muscular
power of the military arm of the Euro
pean nations. Notwithstanding all this
experience, I am simply amazed with
what has been done in forty days by
our Government in launching a navy
and organizing an army, which the rest
of the world believed existed only in
braggadocio, but which it now gazes
upon in wonder.
"The 'grand strategy' to use a tech
nical term, whloh has been developed
in Washington by the Navy Depart
ment is setting all the foreign navy
schools to thinking. They no longer un
derstand our policy. They can little
comprehend why we do not pounce
upon Havana, reduce it, nor why we
have not intercepted the Spanish fleet
and destroyed it. It would give me In
finite satisfaction at this moment to
ask them what they think of the trap
ping of Cervera at Santiago by a party
of eight Yankees."

THE &AN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 1898.
NON-CONCUR
IN AMENDMENTS
House Sends Revenue
Bill to Conference.
THE VOTE ON PARTY LINES.
DALZELL SAYS THE DEMAND IS
A MILLION A DAY.
Bailey of TexaÃ, However, Argues
There Is No Hurry, Claiming
There Is Now Plenty of
Money on Hand.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs Aiouse,
Washington, June 6.
The House on a rising vote decided to
non-concur and send the war revenue
bill to conferenceâ l 37 to 106. The House
conferees on the bill are Dingley of
Maine, Payne of New York and Bailey
of Texas.
The conferees met In the room of the
Senate Committee on Finance at 3 j
o'clock. The Senate conferees express |
confidence that the conference will be
concluded before the end of the week.
When the House met, upon motion of
Lacey (R.) of lowa, the consideration of
the bill providing for the exercise of suf
frage by volunteer soldiers and sailors in
the Congressional elections was made a
special order for to-morrow.
Consideration of a patent measure was
interrupted at 12:0S o'clock by the receipt
of the revenue bill from the Senate, and
Dalzell (R.J of Pennsylvania, from the
committee on rules, presented a resolu-
U<m introduced by Dingley, providing for
an immediate vote upon general non-con
currence and sending the bill to confer
ence.
The previous question was ordered on
the resolution, and Dalzell. speaking in
support, said it was intended to expedite
the enactment of the emergency revenue
measure for the earliest possible relief of
the treasury, upon which there was a
daily demand of $1,000,000. Replying to a
question from Hartlett. he said the adop
tion of the resolution would prevent any
separate votes upon the Senate amend
ments. He said it would be in the pro
vince of the House to reject finally the
conference report, but that he could give
no assurance that an ooportunity would
be ever griven to vote on particular
amendments.
Hailey tD.) of Texas, addressing him
self to' the Democratic position, said the
pending measure was not political in the
sense of an ordinary tariff measure, and
that no one party was necessarily respon
sible for it. Likewise, voting upon sepa
rate amendments in a general tariff
measure might result in destroying the
equity of an entire schedule, but such ob
jection could not be urged in the ponding
measure. He took issue with Dnlzcll in
claiming that the treasury's condition
presented a dire necessity for the immedi
ate passage of the measure, and in this
connection reviewed the recent treasury
statement, insisting that a total of $190.
oo>V"O was available, including the gold
reserve of SWO.ono.oon, and at hand for the
ordinary expenditures of the Government.
Dlnglev concluded In support of the res
olution by saying it was identical with
the one adopted when the tariff bill of
IW7 came hack from the Senate, and
practically identical with that adopted
by the Democrats in 1894.
The vote was then taken upon the reso
lution. Bailey demanded the ayes and
noes, the rollcall resulting as follows:
Ayes, 187; noes. 106.
The vote was strictly partisan. The
House then voted to non-concur and
agree to the conference, and the Speaker
named Dtngley of Maine. Payne (R.) of
New Yofk and Bailey (D.) of Texas as
conferees.
A bill of 231 pages providing a code of
criminal law and procedure for Alaska
was railed up. but its reading was inter
rupted by a motion to adjourn, made by
Sherman (R.) of N>w York, which pre
vailed, and at 3:34 o'clock the House ad-
I journed.

"BRAVEST
ACT EVER
HEARD OF"
Captain Miller Gives the
Details of tJ)e Sinking
of tl)e Merrimac.
Promotion and HoQors in Store
for trje Daring Heroes of
Santiago Harbor.
KEY WEST, June 6.â Captain Miller
of the collier Merrimac arrived here to
day. He said:
"Lieutenant Hobson's act was the
bravest I ever saw or heard of. Every
officer and man in the fleet would have
volunteered to go, but Hobson, being a
naval constructor, was the man for the
place. The details were arranged, and
the crew was on board Thursday morn
ing and the vessel had started, but day
commenced to break and the Admiral
signaled for her return. Hobson begged
to be permitted to proceed, saying he
would be successful. However, the ad
miral insisted on his return. The men
were given a good sleep and early the
next morning the Merrimac started
again. She had been thoroughly
stripped of valuable articles, even the
clock and bell being taken out.
"Along one side the torpedo belt had
been arranged about ten feet below the
water line, six torpedoes being placed
so as to break open the compartments.
These torpedoes had electrical connec
tion with a battery on the bridge, and
wero to be discharged by pressing a
button.
"It was arranged that the Merrimac
was to be swung across the channel till
one end grounded. The men that let go
the starboard anchor were to let the
life raft fall and then jump overboard.
Last of all, the man that pressed
the key would plunge into the water.
The man at the key was undoubtedly
Hobson. He would be unlikely to as
sign another man to the most danger
ous post. Besides he is the best swim
mer in the navy.
"The plan was carried out perfectly.
The only thing we had not counted on
j was the Spaniards keeping such a
j sharp watch. Undoubtedly they knew
something was afoot. They permitted
the Merrimac to pass between the
I Morro and Estrella forts without no
| tifying her. When she was in range
of the other forts every gun in the har
â¢ bor was opened on her. We could not
I count shots, the firing was so furious.
' The forts must have fired a thousand
, times.
"I was on the New York, watching,
and the hearts of all of us faltered, for
It seemed as if no ship could live in
that hell of fire, and that no one on
board could escape. The Merrimac an
chored. The men jumped overboard,
and the forts then subsided, refusing
to fire at the men struggling in the
â water. The men reached the raft,
where they were captured and taken to
Morro fort.
"When Admiral Cervera's chief of
staff came on board the New York
several officers asked to be allowed to
exchange places with Hobson, but this
was not permissible. Cervera's officer
could not find strong enough words to
express his admiration for the bravery
of the Americans. His courtesy and
the action of the forts in sparing the
men struggling in the water changed
our opinion of the Spaniards/ and made
us think the stories of their honor and
chivalry not so far wrong.
"After daylight we could see the
masts and funnel of the Merrimac
sticking out of the water. She was
sunk exactly where we wanted her.
We saw in the harbor three cruis
ersâthe Cristobal Colon and Infanta
Maria Teresa being, among themâ but I
don't know whether the other cruisers
or the torpedo-destroyers are there.
The black thing that some of our of
ficers thought they saw coming after
them has not been " identified yet, and
we are not sure that any of the de
stroyers are at Santiago. .
"The Insurgents sent us. word that
the men and guns from the cruisers
had been sent ashore, and ; it looks as
though the vessels would not try \to
get out and the Spanish officers had no
hope of escape or victory, but were de
termined to make a brave, stubborn
fight to maintain Spain's honor. The
story printed in New York that! Lieu
tenant .Hobson. and Rear Admiral
Sampson quarreled just before the
Merrimac went in is an entire false-

tion are ' safe. Two are slightly

"Admiral Cervera," said the officer,

Tremendous enthusiasm reigns over
the complete success of the expedition.

ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT DAUNT
LESS, off Santiago de Cuba, June 5
(via Kingston, Jamaica, June 6).âAd
miral Sampson is determined not to al
low the Spanish to remove the Merri
i mac from the spot where she lies. On
! Saturday it was reported that they
were working at the hull, and the
American fleet formed in line of battle.
\ with orders to bombard. It turned out
â  that the Spaniards were not so engag-
I ed and the fleet withdrew. Admiral
[ Sampson has given specific orders that
j El Morro, where the Merrimac's crew
are imprisoned, be spared in the firing.
Admiral Cervera's polite assurances
i were accompanied by the statement
: that Lieutenant Hobson and his men
were confined there. This placing of
the prisoners in direct line of fire is de
nounced by the American officers as a
thirteenth century defense, an act of
i incarnate cruelty.
General Castillo, commanding the
Cuban forces in the west and north of
the province of Santiago, has been con
centrating 4000 Cubans In the vicinity
of the city.
NEW YORK, June 6.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Before the combined
military and naval attack is made upon
Santiago de Cuba and Admiral Cer
vera's fleet Naval Constructor Hobson
and the men who so gallantly aided
him in sinking the Merrimac will be
free. This is the confident prediction of
officials as the result of a cablegram re
ceived from Rear Admiral Sampson to
day. Concerning its contents. Acting
Secretary Allen authorized this state
ment: "Admiral Sampson is engaged in
arranging with Admiral Cervera for
an exchange of Naval Constructor Hob
son and the men with him, now pris
oners at Santiago, for some officers and
men held prisoners by the United States
at Fort McPherson."
It is understood by naval officers that
Rear Admiral Sampson sent a flag of
truce, probably by Lieutenant S. A.
Staunton. his flag lieutenant, to Ad
miral Cervera, and that Lieutenant
Staunton, conducting the negotiations,
expected that Admiral Cervera will
communicate with Captain-General
Blanco so the Spaniards may be deliv
ered to the captain-general at Havana.
Immediately upon receipt of the news
from Havana, Admiral Cervera will
give Hobson and his companions safe
conduct outside Santiago harbor.
No action has yet been taken looking
to the promotion of Hobson, and it is
doubtful if the President will do any
thing until Hobson has expressed his
â wishes.
Charett, who is a flrst-class gunner's
mate, will in all probability be ap
pointed a gunner. If recommended by
Hobson, and the recommendation be
approved by Rear Admiral Sampson, it
will undoubtedly give a warrant rank
to each of the men, besides $100 and a
medal of honor, as now provided by
law.
"WASHINGTON:. June 6.âRepresent
ative Hartman of Montana has intro
duced a joint resolution directing the
Secretary of the Navy to have pre
pared and delivered suitable medals of
honor to Lieutenant Hobson and each
member of his crew for gallant, heroic
and patriotic services rendered to the
United States at Santiago harbor in
June 3, 1898. It appropriates $500 for
the purpose.
The promotion In store for Lieuten
ant Hobson, the hero of Santiago, is
under consideration by the Navy De
partment. Acting Secretary Allen and
Commodore Hichborn, chief of the Bu
real of Naval Construction, talked it
over in a general way to-day, but no
conclusions were reached. The depart
ment is desirous of knowing what
would be most acceptable to Hobson
himself, and when this is learned a re
commendation will be made to Con
gress which that body will doubtless
carry into effect without delay.
The present indications are that Hob
son will be tnken out of the staff and
be made a line officer, as that insures
not only an increase of pay, but an
opportunity to rise to the more con
spicuous line position of admiral. At
present Hobson is an assistant con
structor, with the relative rank of lieu
tenant, junior grade. It develops, how
ever, that within the next four weeks
he would have secured a promotion to
the rank of constructor, relative rank,
full lieutenant, in the usual course - f
advancement. As this rank is already
earned by length of service, it would
hardly be an honor for Congress to
confer it upon him. About the only
expedient is to give him a promotion
In the line, probably as lieutenant-com
mander, or commander, where his pay
would be greater than it would be In
the staff service, and the chances for
future advancement would be ample.
There is some doubt, however, whether
an officer who has shown such genius
in the scientific branch of the naval
service would care to leave it for the
line. Congratulations will be sent to
Hobson as soon as there is an oppor
tunity to with him, but
while he is a prisoner at Santiago it is
obviously impossible for the naval au
thorities to do more than convey their
congratulations and thanks to Admiral
Sampson.

EDITOR RUSH'S
ITCHING PALM
Trouble in Store for a
Blackmailer.
LIKELY TO TENANT A CELL
DECLARED HE COULD "FIX"
THREE DAILIES.
Extorted Money From the San Rafael
Man Who Pulled the Tonfju*
From Mis Horse' 3
Mouth.
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
SAN RAFAEL, June 6.â William
Tanning, the wretch who pulled the
tongue out of his horse with a bale rope
and was sentenced to pay a fine of $250
and go to jail for 120 days, is execrated
by every man, woman and child in this
community, all admitting the justice of
the sentence. But with the guilty oft
times the innocent are made to suffer.
The grief of Vanning's heart-broken
Wife instances this.
To J. H. Rush, editor of a two-by
four sheet entitled the "San Rafael
Daily Sun," is attached the odium of
increasing this poor woman's sorrow in
order that his own itching palm might
be lined with filthy lucre. Rush has
drawn down upon himself the anger
and detestation of the public by fora
ins; Vanning and his wife to part witTi
some of their hard-earned coin, which
the extortioner claimed was to be used
as "hush money," and by his methods
called in question the honesty and in
tegrity of the management of the three
San Francisco morning dailies, es
pecially The Call and the Chronicle.
Now the blackmailer, according to At
torney James W. Cochrane, will be
prosecuted for his offense to the full
extent of the law.
It was on last Thursday that Van
ning committed his revolting crime.
That evening Rush met the Marin
County correspondent of The Call and
an employe of his own paper named
McNeill, on the corner of Fourth and
15 streets and asked them to accompany
him on a walk as he "had something
up his sleeve." Thinking he meant a
Btory the two set out with him. As the
party walked up Fourth street Rush
explained that unbeknown to most peo
ple he had unlimited influence with the
managing editors of the three San
Francisco morning dailies and added:
"I have a scheme by which we all
can make plenty of money. Now you,"
addressing McNeill, "go up to a door
I will point out and ring the bell. Tell
whoever comes to the door what I tell
you and the money will be forthcom
ing."
Rush was told by both men to do his
own work, whatever it was, and on ar
riving at Fifth and C streets he left
both waiting while he went up to Van
ring's door and rang the bell. It was
answered by Mrs. Vanning. He then
went inside.
Curiosity and a feeling that mischief
wag brewing impelled the two men in
waiting to walk close enough to hear
the conversation that followed.
Rush said to both Vanning and his
wife that in a moment of passion an
awful offense had been committed. The
papers would "roast" him and he could
never hope to make a living anywhere
afurward. He himself was poor, he
said, and badly in need of money. He
alleged that representatives of The Call
and Chronicle were in waiting outside
and said:
"These men are well paid for their
work, but if you care to pay them what
their papers would I have influence
enough to get them to modify their
stories in your favor. In addition I
have great influence with the managing
editors of the three papers and can do
a good deal myself."
"Where is the Examiner man?" asked
Mrs. Vanning between sobs.
"Oh, we can swing him into line all
right," replied Rush.
"Do you think $15 will be enough?"
inquired Mrs. Vanning.
"I'll go and see," was the answer.
When Rush came out of the house
he found the two men in waiting whpre
he had left them. Sordid and treach
erous to the last, he said he had been
promised only 510 to have the story
modified. He was told he was engi
neering his own deal and the others
did not care to be mixed in it. Then
he returned and accepted the $15, giving
Vanning a receipt, which read:
"Received payment in full for pub
lishing locals in one issue of Sun."
On leaving a second time he advieed
Vanning and his wife to say nothing
about the transaction, both consenting.
He said he would use the money in In
serting notices in the three San Fran
cisco dailies that Vanning's ranch and
stock were for sale.
"If you have a horse or a young Jer
sey cow you don't need, you might give
it to me for my own use," he said on
departinr and received a promise that
he should have one or the other.
Rush then emerged from the house,
laughing- at the "shrewd" way In which
he had obtained the money. Not a
thought came to him of the stigma he
had falsely thrown on metropolitan
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Pears'
Economical
soap is one that

! Journalism by representing it as being
I purchasable. Rush asserted that he
I hud "protected" himself by the receipt
he had left. His offer to part with $5
to the two witnesses of his crime be
| ing spurned, he went to the telephone
; office and called up the ' legraph edi
j tors of two San Francisco dailies and
asked that his own name be omitted
from the articles dealing with Van
ning's inhuman deed. To The Call he
represented himself as a friend of its
correspondent and asked for an amel
ioration in tone of the article sent it.
Owing to a subsequent telephone mes
sage from the correspondent his re
quest passed unheeded.
Then Rush went to his office, with
| the assertion that he would change the
| story he had written. The next day
! the only mention he made of the oc
currence was to state that a man had
been arrested for pulling a horse's
tongue out, omitting Tanning's name.
Janipp W. Cochrane. Winning's at
torney, was acquainted with the facts
| and visited his client In company with
The Call correspondent. To him they
corroborated the story in its entirety.
Mrs. Winning's eyes were swollen from
weeping, and on the entrance of somÂ«
friends she burst into tears.
"This is awful." she sobbed. "I had
nerved myself to read the papers un
til Rush came, and after he got the
money I thought It was all right, but
everything is tnld In the papers to-day.
My husband did it all in an angry pas
sion and nobody is sorrier than he. We
could 111 afford to spare that money.
This is awful."
Rush did not seek to have any ad
vertisements inserted, but spent the
money in part the night he obtained It.
Attorney Cochrane declares that not
only will he make Rush return the
money, but he will prosecute him for
blackmail. As the editor is almost un
iversally in disfavor here this will meet
with strong approbation.
The vierorous manner in which Van
ning's offense was prosecuted by City
Attorney Thomas Boyd. attorney for
the Society for the Prevention of Cruel
ty to Animals, Is praised on all sides
ARTIST BASEEBE GETS
HIMSELF WELL THRASHED
Taught a Lesson in Gallantry by a
Passenger on a San Kafael
Train.
LARKSPUR, June 6.â Artist Baseebe,
who won unenviable notoriety in San
Francisco by hounding a little girl named
Worn, and was fined for the offense, re
ceived a severe lesson in the code of gal
lantry on an afternoon train from the
metropolis on Saturday eveningâ a lesson
that he is not likely to forget in a hurry-
As a result of his practical instruction
Baseebe wears a discolored optic and sev
eral facial bruises.
On the train with Baseebe were Frank
Hyams, the San Rafael fresco painter,
and his wife. The car was crowded, and
the weather intensely hot. Mrs. Hyams
was obliged to sit 'beside Baseebe, while
her husband occupied an adjoining seat
As the train neared this station, Mrs, I
Hyams grew faint from the heat. Hyams !
stepped across the car to raise the window I
and let in some fresh air. Baseebe ex- I
postulated.
"I don't want the cinders blowing in on i
my clothes," said he.
"My wife is fainting," declared Hyams,
"and the window must be opened."
As he attempted to raise it Baseebe
tried to prevent him, whereupon Hyams
emulated the most skillful exponents of
the manly art in landing a series of hooks,
swings and straight arm punches on the
artist's face. Everybody applauded the
act, and an excited crowd at once filled
the car. Baseebe managed to extricate j
himself and escape into a forward car.
The window came up, and Mrs. Hyams
Boon recovered from her faint.

Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
SAUSALITO, Jane 6.â A cowardly ef
fort to burn the valuable property of a
prominent citizen was discovered here
yesterday â an attempt that if success
ful might have resulted in the loss of
four Jives. A. Lawrence & Co., whole
sale and retail dealers in merchandise,
were the intended losers, but the plans
of the conspirators were frustrated by
mere chance, and now the authorities
are hunting for a clew to the identity
of the malefactors.
Lawrence is ex-Treasurer of the town
; and has always taken an active interest
: in its politics. His storeis situated in the
j northern part of town and contiguous
j to it are two residences owned by him,
1 one of which he occupies. Yesterday
! evening the merchant and his wife at-
I tended a ball celebrating the expiration
|of the Portuguese Pentecost, leaving
j George Ryan, the bookkeeper, in charge
lof the store. The four children of the
' merchant were left soundly sleeping in
i the house nearest the store. A short
! time afterward Ryan went down town
: and stayed some time in the company
i of friends.
Before going home Ryan remembered
that he had left some books he wished
to take home in the store and returned
to get them with two friends. On
opening the door he was surprised to
see a light in the rear room. On in
vestigation he found a quantity of
straw had been spread in the room and
a lighted candle placed in the center
of the mass. To complete their dia
bolical plans the miscreants had taken
a dozen cans of kerosene oil from the
shelves and emptied the contents in
the room. The oil was spread on the
floor to the depth of two inches. It
was the work of an instant to extin
guish the candle, but if the bookkeeper
had arrived fifteen minutes later the
store would have burned to the ground.
The two residences adjacent must have
gone up in smoke as well, and the
sleeping children might have perished.
The utmost secrecy was Imposed on
all the witnesses to the dastardly at
tempt at arson and the proper authori
ties have been quietly endeavoring to
discover the evil doers. So far no clew
has been obtained.
AGAINST THE POLICY OF
TERRITORIAL EXPANSION
Democratic Members of the House
Are Preparing to Antago
nize Annexation.
WASHINGTON, June 6.â The Demo
cratic members of the House are pre
paring to antagonize the Hawaiian an
nexation resolution as contrary to the
proper principles of public policy and
will assume an attitude in debate which
they expect to emphasize in the coming
campaign.
It appears now that the Democratic
fight this fall will be made in opposition
to the developing of the policy of terri
torial expansion, and while a number
are rather inclined to favor Hawaiian
annexation they are not disposed to
favor such an extension of territory ua
the Republicans advocate. Representa
tive Hilborn of California, who repre
sents fairly well the Republican senti
ment in the House regarding the Philip
pines, said yesterday:
"Of Americans who go to the Philip
pines probably one-half will acquire in
terests there and a percentage will be
killed or die of disease. The question
will then present itself, 'Shall we aban
don the graves of our dead and the in
terests of the living?' I think the
American Congress and the American
people will have but one reply to this
proposition, and that will be most em
phatic." â 
PROSECUTION OF

CAPE HAYTIEN, Haytt, June 6.â The
American steamer Saginaw, of the Clyde

Senor Jiminez, the leader of the revolu

thorities for a violation of the navigation
laws in flying a Clyde line flag, though
the Fanlta, the vessel in which the ex
pedition sailed, had been sold by the
Clyde line company six months before.
Chris Roberts, the pilot of the expedi
tion, made a complaint on the above
ground. The American Consuralso prose
cuted Senor Jiminez, alleging that the ex
pedition was illegal, inasmuch, as the
Fanita's papers were ostensibly for ser
vice in Cuban waters.
PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic,
June 6.â 1 have had an interview with

President Herreux has confiscated all the
property of Jiminez.
FEW MELONS AT LODI.
Crop Will Be Small Because of the
Spring Drought.
STOCKTON, June 6.â The watermelon
crop will, no doubt, be the lightest the
Lodi section has known in yearsâ possibly
since Lodi became famous for the size and
succulence of its melons. The absence of
late rains worked havoc. The acreage is
small, and the few who are successful
with watermelons this season will have
a small Klondike. Lodi will have to sup
ply the entire melon market this time, for
if reports be true, rival melon centers
have been blighted by the drought.

IN MARKETS
OF THE WORLD
Manufacturers Making a
Great Record.
BIG INCREASE IN EXPORTS.
HOW THE UNITED STATES SENDS
PRODUCTS ABROAD.
Foreig-n Trade of the Fiscal Year,
Which Closes This Month, Is
Multiplying at aja Aston
ishing Rate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 6.â The manufac
turers of the United States are making,
in the fiscal year which closes with this
month, their greatest record In compet
ing for the markets of the world, avers
the Washington correspondent of the
Tribune. Not only will the exports of
manufactured articles for the fiscal
year exceed those of any previous year,
but for the first time in the history of
the country they will exceed the im
ports of manufactures. In the ten
months of the fiscal year the detailed
record of which the Bureau of Statis
tics has just completed, the exports of
manufactures exceed by over $40,000,000
the value of the manufactures import
ed, and it is probable that for the full
year's record this excess will reach
$50,000,000. In no preceding year in the
history of the country have the exports
of manufactures equaled In value the
imports of manufactured articles. In
the fiscal year of 1897 the Imports of
manufactured articles exceeded the
value of exports of manufactures by
the sum of $27,362,217; in 1896 by $104,
759,734, and in 1895 by $121,413,783.
Nearly every branch of the manufac
turing industries has shared in this
growth of sales to other parts of the
world. The exports of agricultural im
plements, for instance, which in 1888
were about $2,600,000 in, value, will in
the year 189S be, in round numbers,
$6,000,000. Locomotive engines, whose
exportation in 1888 was less than $500,
000 in value, will in 1898 reach probably
$4,000,000, orders for more than 150 en
gines having been placed with the
great manufacturing establishments
during the last two months for use in
China, Japan, Russia, Egypt, Austra
lia and South America-
Bar iron, of which 1,500,000 pounds
were sent abroad in 1888 this year 10,
000,000 will be exported. Builders' hard
ware, the export of which in 1888 was
valued at $1,442,633, was in the last fis
cal year $4,152,836 in value. The exports
of cut nails, which in 1888 amounted
to 11,963,664 pounds, will in 1898 amount
to more than 35,000,000 pounds, an in
crease of 200 per cent. Wire nails have
increased over 1000 per cent, the ex
ports of wire, wrought and horseshoe
nails in 1888 being 1,547,078 pounds,
while those of 1898 will reach nearly, if
not quite, 20,000,000 pounds. Exports of
iron plates and sheets, which in 1888
were less than 1,000,000 pounds, will in
this year amount to nearly 8,000,000
pounds, while those of steel plates and
sheets, which were but 119,419 pounds
in 1888, will exceed 20,000,000 pounds in
1898.
The total value of the exports of man
ufactures of Iron and steel, which In
1888 amounted to $17,000,000, will In 1898
exceed. $65,000,000. The exports of leath
ers and manufactures thereof, which
in 1888 amounted to less than $10,000,000,
will in 1898 exceed $20,000,000 in value.
Exports of illuminating oil, which in
1888 amounted to 456.000,000 gallons, will
in 1898 exceed 800,000,000 gallons, while
lubricating oils, which in 1888 were less
than 23,000,000 gallons, will in 1898 reach
65,000,000 gallons. The exportations of
parafflne and parafflne wax, which in
1888 were 36,000,000 pounds, will in 1898
reach 140,000,000. Soap increases from
19,000,000 pounds in 1888 to over 27,000,
000 pounds in 1898; glass and glassware
from $881,628 in 1888 to $1,208,187 in 1898;
manufactures of rubber from $866,867 in
188S to $1,807,145 in 1898.
Manufactures of cotton show an in
crease of 60 per cent in the value of
their exports during the last ten years;
exports of chemicals have also In
creased 50 per cent in value during the
same time. Manufactures of brass
have Increased from $308,124 in 1888 to
over $1,400,000 in 1898, while manufac
tures of copper, including ingots and
bars, which in ISBS were $3,812,790, were
last year $31,621,127 and seemed likely
to exceed that sum in 189 S. In numer
ous other manufactured articles there
have been similar gains, nearly the en
tire list having shared in a greater or
less degree in the growth of the ex
port trade during the last decade. The
total exportation of manufactures in
1888 amounted to $130,300,087, and in 1898
seems likely to reach nearly or quite
$290,000,000.

GOLD STRIKE
AT WRANGEL
Argonauts Discover a
Bonanza.
MINERS RUSH TO THE SPOT.
SAID TO BE RICHER THAN THE
KLONDIKE.
Alaska Steamship Reports That a
Number of Vessels Are Unable
to Ascend the
Stickeen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 6.â The
steamer Princess Louise, which has re
turned from Wrangel, making the re
turn voyage in seven dayÃ, brings
news that the small body of men en
camped there building boats to con
tinue their Journey via the lake and
the Hootalinqua to the Klondike coun
try have made a find richer than any
strike that has been made for some
time past in the Klondike mining dis
trict. Needless to state, boat building
was abandoned and all are at work on
newly staked claims on the shores of
Lake Teslin.
While some of the men were walking
along the shore in search of drift wood
for a fire they noticed colors in the
black gravel. On washing a few pans
of the alluvial soil gold was obtained.
After further investigation about a
mile from the camp a place was found
where several pans went very high, one
giving about $300. The lucky man,
whose name could not be learned, but
who is said to be one of the carpenters
employed at the Canadian Development
Company's sawmill at the lakes, at
once dropped the pan after securing
his gold, and after staking a claim
rushed over to the camp of the mining
recorder at the settlement and record
ed his location. All his companions im
mediately followed suit, and on their
reporting their good fortune at the
encampment a number set out to stake
claims along the shore.
At Glenora and Telegraph, where at
present there are about 2000 people, the
wildest excitement prevailed when the
news was told, and hundreds at once
packed their outfits and started to the
scene of the discovery. A downward
river steamer brought word of the dis
covery to Wrangel, and mining excite
ment seized Wrangelites, numbers of
whom, according to the officers of the
Princess Louise, have started inland
ere now.
The Princess Louise brings news that
the spring freshets are bringing the
waters of the Stickeen to a great height
and making the current exceedingly
swift. With the exception of four ves
sels the fleet of Stickeen River steamers
is now penned up above the canyon
unable to get down the river owing to
the swiftness of the rapids in the can
yon and the drift wood. The four ves
sels not penned up are the steamers
Ramona, preparing to come down, as
ehe is not sufficiently strong to ascend
the swift-running river; the Monte
Cristo, awaiting the arrival of a shaft,
she having broken hers; the Skagit
Chief, which is ashore and from all ac
counts likely to remain so all season,
a few miles below Glenora, and the
Casca. The penned-up vessels will be
unable to get through the canyon until
the water goes down, which may be a
week or two yet.
An idea of the swiftness of the cur
rent on the Stickeen can be ascertained
from the fact that the steamer "Vic
torian on her last trip down made fully I
forty knots an hour and the engineers
were at times obliged to reverse her
engines to preverit her getting beyond
control.
Word is brought of the drowning near
Glenora of a French miner whose name
could not be learned.
SIAN FU TO BE MADE
THE CAPITAL OF CHINA
Troops Already Stationed to Protect
the Emperor on His Journey
From. Peking.
LONDON, June 6.â The Globe to-day
says it learns from a reliable source that
the Tsung LI Yamen (Chinese Foreign
Office) has decided to make Slan Fu,
Province of Shen Si, the capital of the
Chinese empire, in place of Peking.
General Tung Futing, it is added, now
commands a picked force stationed in a
town half way between Peking and Sian
Fu, for the purpose of protecting the Em
peror and his court on their journey to
the new capital, and troops, it appears,
are already stationed at intervals along
the route to be traversed by the imperial
party.
House of Commons Beassembles,
LONDON, June 6.â The House of Com
mons reassembled to-day after the Whit
suntide holidays. The attendance was
small. The financial secretary of the
treasury, Mr. Hanbury, replying to Sir
George Baden-Powell, said the Govern
ment did not think a large expedlture
for the purpose of establishing a weekly
mail service to China, via Canada, would
be warranted.

NEW YORK, June 6.-William Barnie,

SELLING WAR BONDS.
A Great Demand for the New Turee
Per Cent Issue.
While Spain is rustling here and there
trying to raise a little money among for
eign nations and its own people, the
United States has only to ask and the
wealth of the great nation is poured into
the Treasury, and by its own citizens.
This was proved yesterday when the First
National Bank opened its doors, the an-
nouncement having been made that it
would receive subscriptions for the new
3 per cent Government war loan. Cashier
J. K. Lynch had hardly taken his seat
when the first subscriber placed his name
in the subscription book for a $100 bond.
By noon $125.0(10 had been subscribed for,
and the cashier stated that he had prom
ises for subscriptions that would run this
amount up to over $2.10.000. The total 1s-
BUe by the Government will be $300,000,000,
and the denominations will be $2f>, $50. $100,
?â "â¢Â»> and $1000. The heaviest demand yes
y was for bonds of the larger de
nomination. It must not be understood
that there were no small bonds sold, for
there were many of even the lowest
order. Mr. Lynch says that no security
is asked, for it is well known that in the
event of any one falling to make good
his subscription there are plenty who will
be only too glad to take up the same.
There is every reason to believe that
the demand for these bonds will be great
er than the amount of the issue. In such
an event the Government will fill the or
ders for the small denominations first.
These bonds are to be delivered in about
thirty days.
Ore of the first subscribers yesterday
was a lady who said that she has pur
chased bonds of the Government of every
Issue since the big "7-30" issue of the late
civil war.
At the present time the bonds arÂ» sell
ing at prir. but as soon as the books close
they are sure to sell at a premium.
MINING LITIGANTS
TIRED OF FIGHTING.
SIGNS OF A COMPROMISE IN THE
HALE & NORCROSS CASE.
A Plan to Let One Judgment Go and
Retain the Amount of the
Other nnd Interest.
There nre several new movements on in
the case of M. W. Fox against Alvinza
Hay ward and others and the Hal* & Nor-
Silver Mining Company that the
majority of the public do not understand.
The < ase came up yesterday before the
Supreme Court in bank upon a petition
f'<v a rehearing of this matter, that has
draff fed along for so many years before
ourta of this city and the higher tri
bunal. In the lower court Fox obtained
the original judgment for $210,000 for
faulty milling and thÂ» costs thereon. Also
for about $480,000. which included the in
teresi for fraudulent milling. The Su
preme Court affirmed the first count, but
reversed the second count. With the case
int; in this manner it promised to
drag along for years unnumbered. A
short time ago Fox petitioned for a re
hearing and made an offer for a modifi
cation of the second count as the court
might allow. The Supreme Court refused
to make a modification, but granted a re
bearing, and it was on this that the case
came up yesterday. Ws T. Baggett, G.
v> . McÃnerney and L. D. McKislck began
an argument for Fox, when they suddenly
broke off and said they had been author
ized to make an offer that might be the
means of compromising the complicated
and badly mixed case. The offer was to
remit the entire second count, and they
asked that the opinion of the court he a
modification of a judgment of the lower
court; in other words, that the curt or
der the lower court to enter judgment for
$2]O.rKX), plus the interest and cost. There
upon Fox and his friends would abandon
their right of action on the sceond count,
reserving the benefit of the Judgment in
the first count.
W. S. \Vood and John Garber, for the
Hale & Norcross Company, raised vigor
ous objection to such a modification on
the ground that the Supreme Court had
not the jurisdiction to enter such an or
der because that court could not make a
finding and the judgment must go with
the findings. They also claimed $6000
costs, asserting that if the higher court
made such a lump modification they
could not secure their costs.
The question of costs was argued for
some time, and the court took the matter
under advisement. From all appearances
some of the contestants are getting very
tired of this litigation and are willing to
have it brought to an end. If the peti
tion for a modification had been success
fully made an appeal could have been
taken to the higher court, thus keeping
the case turning over and over as before.
It was evidently believed that If the de
sired order was made from the Supreme
Court that would settle it.
BONDS STILL HOLD HIM.
John H. Hummell Fails to Rid Him-
self of Wife and Two Children.
John H. Hummell, who yesterday I
morning hoped that the setting sun would
see him a single man. rid of the burden
of a wife and two children. Is still held in
the bonds of matrimony and he will be
forced to show cause why he should not
support his family.
Hummell was married to hie wjfe,
Louise, in ISSO. It was a contract mar
riage and was executed in the State of
Illinois. Shortly after Hummell moved
with his wife to Denver, Colo., where two
children were born to them. Hummell
finally tired of his home and left it. but i
an agent of the Denver Society for the
lYevt-ntion of Cruelty to Children learned :
of the case anfl caused his arrest. He
was threatened with imprisonment unless
he wedded his wife In conformity with
the laws of Colorado, and under pressure
he consented. Five days after the wed
ding he again left his home and was not .
again heard of by his family until he
loomed up in this city and Instituted suit
to have his marriage annulled on the
ground that he had been forced into it
against his will.
Mrs. Hummell was Informed of the ac
tion her husband had tsken, and when be ;
appeared In Judge Hebbard's court yes
terday morning to prosecute his suit he ;
was confronted with his wife's answer,
which denied all his allegations and set ,
out the true story. Judge Hebbard read â 
It carefully, and then without further !
ado dismissed the suit. Mrs. Hummell
will now, in all probability, bring pro- ,
ceedlngs to compel her husband to sup
port herself and babies.

FATHER BERNARD
AND LITTLE PETE
Stevens and Edith Hall
a Success.
AN AMERICAN HERO AT TIVOLI
"THE COTTON KING" AT THE
GRAND OPERA-HOUSE.
New Tunes at the Orpheumâ Good
Second Week Openings
at the Other
Theaters.
Now is the summer of our discontent
made glorious winter by this son of song
â or rather these sons of song.
The Baldwin is closed; the California is
closed. At the Columbia and Alcazar last
week's bill is this week's bill. And now,
just when our need is greatest, comes
the Tlvoli to the rescue.
Go to the Tlvoli. all ye that are world
weary. Go to the Tivoli, ye who are
bored. Go to the Tivoli, ye whose hope
.that anything good can come out of stage
land has drooped and withered. Go to the
Tivoli, and laugh at Edwin Stevens and
Edith Hall, and admire the conscientious,
clever, thorough work of these two.
Better acting, more appropriate make
up. fuller appreciation of the details that
go to make up a role have never been seen
on the TJvoll stage than Father Bernard
and Little Pete presented last night.
Their first auet was excellent. There's
spirit and warmth and resonance in Edith
Hall singing, and she acted as though
she really enjoyed what assuredly gave
enjoyment to her audience. As to Stev
ens, a more delightful bit of humorous
characterization than his Sicilian grandee
it would be hard to imagine. And not a
moment in all the time these two are on
the stage do they forget the effect they
intend to produce. Their Italian duet was
the hit of the evening. The sextet In the
third act was. a good musical number,
strikingly costumed. Edith Hall's manly,
saucy little face is peculiarly pretty when
framed in a parted-in-the middle white
wig and set above the costume of a young
Marquis. Louise Royce's voice, which
was eclipsed by a cold early in the even
ing, regained. its strength for the beauti
ful sextet.
The patriotic finale to Act 111. which set
the house applauding and cheering, Is a
good climax. The opera ought to end
I here. But the composer had a few ad
ditional hair-breadth 'scapes for his hero
to pass through, so there's another act.
The opera Is full of melody. This state
ment, considering the ordinary run of
comic operas, is not in the least tauto
logical, and the Tivoli orchestra knows
good music when it gets an opportunity
to play it. MIRIAM MICHELSON.
At the Grand Opera House.
The mar.agement has scored a well merited
! success in the presentation of "The' Cotton
King," with more than usual elaborateness of
stipe setting and scenery. The play requires
a strong cas' and careful stase setting, and
both of these have been supplied by the man
afTCimnt. The result has been that the inter
esting story of the triumph of honest love
over the machinations of calculating: villain)
Is told with unwonted force, and with thrill
ing effect. The cotton mill in full operation
was greeted with a round of well merited ap
plause, while the elevator scene in which the
heroine is rescued from a fearful death was
honored with a mall for Mr. Meldon and
Maud Edna Hall.
H. Percy Meldon, direct from the Boston
Theater, established himself at once as a fa
vorite with the audience, his acting being con
scientious and painstaking. George Webster
as James Shlllincrlaw. the dissipated engine
driver, sustained his reputation as an expo
nent of n'o'odrama and received several recalls.
Max yon Mitzel began his second week by malt
ing a Jtcidtd hit in the small part of Rev.
Mr Tender. Julia Blanc as Kittle Marshall
and Maurice Stewart as Benjamin Tupper sup
plied the tun of the play and did it well. keep
ing the EUdience In continual merriment.
The present company Is a strong one and
will draw big houses. Several popular attrac
tions will be billed In the near future, among
them Carroll Johnson and his comuany. Xext
week Clay M Greene's "Under the Polar Star"
will be the attraction.
The Baldwin.
To-morrow afternoon Ysaye, Gerardy and
Lachaume will return to San Francisco for a
farewell concert. An excellent programme, In
cluding: a number of popular compositions, has
been arranged, and, as prices also will be popu
lar, an exceptional opportunity to hear the
great musicians will be afforded.
"The Passion Play" is to be revived at the
Baldwin Theater commencing next Thursday
afternoon at 3:15. It will be continued every
afternoon and evening thereafter. The presen
tation by means of lifelike moving pictures of
this play has been very successful.
At the Columbia.
Those who like romance and comedy mixed in
equal proportion! may have their fill at the
Columbia Theater, where r'lay Clement and his
company are presenting "The New Domin
ion ." The scenes are supposed to occur
in the South, and the characters are of the
aristocratic order found In the State of Vir
ginia, excepting that assumed by Clement,
who impersonates the German noblPman to
perfection. The characters are all well sus
tained and the company work in harmony.
"Number Nine" will be presented next week
by the Frawley Company.
At the Alcazar.
"The Master of Ceremonies" commenced its
second week at the AJcazar Theater last night
to a crowded house. Mr. Lewis Morrison and
Miss Florence Roberts received a curtain call
at the close of each act. They are admirably
supported by the stock company.
At the Orpheum.
The strong bill at the Orpheum served to
draw the usual packed house and all the new
turns won favor. While there are but three
new acts several of the hold overs appeared In
a change of repertoire, particularly Ezra Ken
dall and Al Leach and the three Rosebuds.
Wills and Loretto appear in an act made up
for the most part of repartee between a very
seedy specimen of a tramp and a gay sou
brette, the latter Introducing a .few a- ngi and
dances. Alburtus and Bartrum have been
seen? here before, but In their two years' ab
sence have added many new features to their
exhibition of club swinging. Katie Jlooney's
Imitations of the late Pat Rooney. who In his
day was the kins of Celtic comedy, were well
received. The La Mont family, who class
among the very best acrobats the Orpheum
has had, were well received. This will be the
last week of Professor Leonldas and his troupe
of "trained dogs and cats. The musical John
sons, Harry Allister and others complete the
bill.

AN OLD MAN
BLOWS OUT
HIS BRAINS
Otto Johnson, Aged
71, Commits Suicide.
HE MET WITH REVERSES
INDUCED TO EMBARK IN A
LOSING VENTURE.
After Leaving His Home He Sits on
a Doorstep and Fires a
Built * Into His
Head.
Despondent over business reverses Otto
Johnson, aged 71 years, last night com
mitted suicide by shooting himself
through the head. The deed was done on
the steps of a house on Van Ness avenue,
near Filbert.
Johnson lived at 1105 Vallejo street.
Shortly after 8 o'clock last night he left
his home, after telling his wife that he
was going for a walk. A.s she noticed the
handle of his revolver protruding from
his overcoat pocket, she begged him not
to leave her. Despite her entreaties he
left the house and walked rapidly along
Filbert street to Van Ness avenue. After
looking up and down the street, as if to
pee whether or not anybody was ap
proaching, he sat down on the steps of
the house, and taking the revolver from
his pocket, placed the muzzle to his head
and fired. The bullet entered the right
side of the head close to the ear, and
emerged from the other side. A soldier
named "Welch was passing at the time,
and seeing the old man fall to the side
walk, he went to his assistance. Realiz
ing that he was fatally injured. Welch at
once repaired to the North End station,
where he hurriedly informed the desk
sergeant of the occurrence. Several offi
cers were despatched to the scene, and
thinking that Johnson was still alive they
placed him in the patrol wagon and con
veyed him to the Receiving Hospital.
When he was placed on the operating
table Assistant Police Surgeon Bunnell
pronounced him dead. His body was then
removed to the Morgue.
Johnson some time ago formed a part
nership with Edwin C. Barclay in the In
surance business. They established "an
office at 411H California street, hut
through Barclay's inattention to business,
so it is claimed. Johnson lost considerable
money in the venture. Several weeks ago
Barclay met with an accident which pre
vented him from leaving his house. Find
ing that his aged partner was in a
despondent mood, due to the money he
had lost, he nenc run: the following note
with the accompanying bill of .sale:

BUENA VISTA'S GIRLS IN BLUE.
The "Hollow Square" Or)e of the Movements Executed by the
Marchiog AmazoQS.
Buena Vista's girls in blue, that is, the drill corps of Buena Vista Parlor, Native Daughters of the Golden West, visited the Fontana barracks last
night to give an exhibition drill before the officers and men of the two battalions of the Washington volunteers. It was a repetition of the drill given by the
same corps on the occasion of the patriotic entertainment given by the parlor last week; but. be it said to the credit of the young ladies, the movements
were executed with more precision. The effect was very pretty, as the corps, attired in light blue skirts and Zouave jackets of the same hue, trimmed with
white braid, white shirt waists, with standing collars, red four-in-hand ties and jaunty white caps of the cadet pattern, and carrying cadet rifles, entered
the main hall, where the drill was held. The corps presented a decidedly patriotic appearance, and was greeted with applause from the boys and a large
number of ladies and gentlemen who were present. The girls in blue, under command of Miss Annie Worth, captain, went through the manual of arms, the
facings and a number of fancy movements in a manner that won for them much applause. After they wore dismissed. Private Brewer of Company I, with
a squad of eight men, as a return compliment, gave a comical drill, which was remarkable for the orders by <â¢. hich the men went through the manual of

not find words to order the enjoyment of the evening brought to a close at that time. The girls in blue had made an attack, and the boys in blue surren

SOLDIERS TO PLAY BALL.
Minnesota Volunteers Will Engage
the Friscos for Charity.
The officials of the Pacific Coast League
are certainly taking care of the players,
so far as the money end of things is con
cerned. They held a meeting at the
Baldwin Hotel last evening and unanim
oualy agreed to give the team winning the
championship $1(XIO in cash, to be divided
among them. They also agreed to give
the team coming second Ln the race $500.
These purses do not interfere with the
money the boys derive from their pro rata
of tho receipts, and if they do their part
as well as the league management, all
concerned will surely be content.
The game Thursday between the San
Franciscos and a picked nine from the
Minnesota Volunteers wa's also dis
cussed. The entire receipts of this game
â will be turned over to the society of the
Red Cross, and as the Minnesota boys
have a crack team a great game is an
ticipated. Already a very large number
of seats has been sold, and as the gams
is for such a noble cause all lovers of tha
national pastime should turn out. The
game will be called at 2:30 p. m. sharp,
and general admission will be 25 cents.

REGISTER EARLY.
ONE of the most important duties of the quali- I
fied voter is to cast a ballot at all elections.
No qualified voter can cast a ballot unless
his name is upon the register, and in order to get his
name upon the register it will be necessary for him
to devote a little time to the duty.
Central office registration is now in progress at the
City Hall, and for several weeks Registrar Biggy will
take the affidavits of all who desire to register for the
November election. No voter whose name is now
on the register will be entitled to vote unless he re
registers. An entirely new register must be prepared,
and every man who intends to vote in November
should lose no time in visiting the registration office
and enrolling his name. Precinct registration will
come along in due time, but no one should wait for
that. Register now and all danger of losing a vote
will be obviated.
Merchants, business men, professional men and
others who can leave their work for an hour should
register early. Prior to closing the central office the
Registrar will hold forth evenings for the working
classes. The classes who can spare the time should
not wait for evening registration. Register now and
avoid the crush.
Register once and vote once but do both early
should be the watchword of even* citizen.
BEAUTY OF THE TECHNICALITY.
THE fact may have been observed that ex-Dis
trict Attorney Page has been granted a stay of
proceedings. If there is anything the gentleman
wants all he has to do is to ask for it. The courts
seem to have been devised for his benefit. The won
der is that he does not ask for his liberty and a per
diem for the time he has been cruelly deprived of the
same.
Page is guilty of having stolen the money of a
ward. Concerning this point there has from the
first been no question. The first trial was recognized
as a mere formality, a method of putting known facts
on record. A verdict of guilty was quickly returned,
because any jury returning another sort of verdict
would have stamped itself as a body unfit to be out of
jail. Nevertheless Page got another trial, on a plea
so silly as to bring into just contempt the whole ma
chinery of the law.
Once more was he found guilty, and still again, and
sentenced the third time to the penitentiary, where he
belongs. At none of the trials was there the least at
tempt to set forth his innocence. Such an attempt
would have been so futile as to be ridiculous. It was
deemed better to merely block the statutes by some of
the legal quirks which have done so much to make
them sneered at as ineffective. Now Page has been
granted a stay, this also being on technical grounds,
and his prospect of serving a term he has richly
earned is as remote as ever.
We have nothing against Page as an Individual.
He is as good as any other rascal who Is no better,
but we must protest against the travesty on justice,
of which he has been the central figure for so long.
If the laws are inferior to Page, the fact might as well
be acknowledged now and the public saved, not only
the expense and humiliation of more farce, but the
smaller expense of supporting a prisoner who keeps
out of the penitentiary not by his own merit, but be
cause he does not wish to go there.
The men on board ships in action are subject to
more dangers than arise from the guns of the enemy.
The impact caused by the firing of heavy guns is ter- !
rible to undergo. It has in itself been known to be '
fatal. Doubtless it was the cause of the death of brave
Captain Gridley, a man who did his full part at Manila
to cover the American navy with glory. Gridley's i
iecord show 9 him to have been a good officer, a man !
of patriotic impulse and courage that never failed.
Although it was not given him to die in battle, he
was, nevertheless, a hero, and history will accord him
his place.
A Russian paper remarks that"America must vol
untarily submit her pretensions to a tribunal of the
powers." Yes? There are several difficulties which
at once present themselves to the thoughtful. In the
first place America is not making any "pretensions."
and in the second place an idea prevails here that for
the powers to attend to their own business would be
proper. This is our fight.
Perhaps Kasson. being from a prohibition State,
which, by the way. does not prohibit, didn't regard

CAN THE PARTY TRUST IT?
THE Examiner is a ceaseless schemer. Not long
ago it laid a scheme to get possession of the
Democratic State Committee by expelling from
that body all members who had not paid a certain
onerous assessment put upon them in 1896. In that
year the Federal office-holders joined the Nonpungle
Club and deafened their ears to the cry of the com
mittee for pocket money. In addition to this sorrow
it was discovered that the non-office holding mem
bers of the party, loved of the Lord as cheerful givers
to campaign funds, had not moved off the old plat
form, but stood still as National Democrats on the
Indianapolis declaration. In this financial emergency,
while the clouds of defeat lowered and there was not a
bit of the root of all evil on hand to pry them up
withal, the members of the State Committee were
assessed. Some paid and more than a third did not.
Now, in mousing around for a way to steal the
committee, the Examiner found this unpaid assess
ment and discovered that the delinquents were mostly
members it desired to get rid of. Immediately the
theory appeared that a committeeman who had not
paid a personal assessment became ineligible and the
committee could fill his place.
As members of the committee were appointed by
definite constituencies, and as payment of assess
ments was not put among the qualifications and con
ditions precedent to their appointment, in all fairness
delinquency in that respect could not affect a man's
right to remain on the committee. The scheme was
a trifle too rank and died of its own stench.
Since then the Examiner has been sneaking for a
way to get a cinch on the party, and has succeeded in
carrying the plan for appointment of the San Fran
cisco City Committee by the State Committee, and
for the election of delegates to the State convention
and the nomination of a city ticket by that city com
mittee of one hundred.
Now the Examiner declares that the Democratic
party of this city cannot be trusted to hold an open
primary and that its affairs must be conducted by the
State Committee through its trustees, the city com
mittee of one hundred.
A party takes on largely the character of its public
adviser and advocate. The Examiner has been for
years the self-elected guide, philosopher and friend
of the Democracy. That. party has had no other, and
now the teacher makes public proclamation that his
pupils are not fit to be trusted to vote in an open pri
mary for delegates to the State and city conventions!
Yet when Democratic State and city tickets are put
in the field the Examiner will exhaust what it calls
argument to persuade the people that a party which
it declares is too dishonest to hold a primary is fit
to be trusted with the government of the State and
city!*
We think better of the party than it would deserve
if the Examiner were a decent paper and its judgment
deserving of respect. The fact is that the Democratic
party in this city is bucked and gagged by the Ex
aminer gang because, if left free to manage its own
affairs, none of that gang could get recognition from
it. It is a high-handed disfranchisement of a party
by a newspaper, because the newspaper cannot con
trol the party.
We will see what will come of this. Republicans
are too free-minded and free-handed to stand such
wholesale disfranchisement. Their confidence in the
people canonizes against taking power away from
them.. If the people are to vote a ticket they must
have a voice in its nomination.
A fit rebuke of the Examiner tactics will be. to
leave the committee of one hundred to vote the ticket
it will nominate, while men who desire to be free go
fishing on election day.
If the Examiner cannot trust the Democratic party
how can the party trust the Examiner?
WHERE WE ARE WEAK-
BY sharp and impressive lessons the war with
Spain has taught us the importance of enlarg
ing our navy, and Congress has already taken
steps in that direction. There is another lesson taught
by the war which has not been so readily learned. It
is the importance of enlarging our merchant marine.
Congress has as yet done nothing to accomplish that,
and may do nothing during the present session.
Events now occurring make it evident that our
weakness at sea is due not so much to a lack of war
ships as of merchant ships. It has been with the
greatest difficulty the Government has obtained ves
sels to transport troops to the Philippines. Moreover
we have been handicapped in obtaining men for our
navy by reason of a lack of trained sailors in the mer
chant service.
In a recent address at a London banquet the Hon.
Gibson Bowles, a member of Parliament, in speaking
of "Our mercantile marine and state-aided competi
tion," said: "No industry is at all comparable in im
portance with shipping. We might lose all our man
ufactures and all our agriculture, but if we can only
keep the carrying trade of the world in the hands of
our own people this country will still be the biggest
| country of the world and the necessary center through
I which the traffic of other countries must pass."
That is the estimate which intelligent Englishmen
place upon the merchant marine of their country.
Nor is the estimate exaggerated. We pay to Great
Britain a large tribute annually for carrying our pro-
I duce across the ocean, and thus are deprived of a
large portion of our profits. In this way we suffer an
i economic loss in time of peace as well as engender a
! weakness on the sea in time of war. We need more
vessels to carry on our foreign commerce, and we
need more also to transport our troops to points
' across the ocean where the emergencies of battle call
, them.
We have now built up in this country a nation with
a world-wide commerce and with world-wide respon
sibilities. We are engaged in a world-wide war and
,we feel the need of a world-wide sea power. That
power cannot be built upon a navy alone. A fleet of
'â  merchant ships is as necessary as a fleet of battle
ships. It is time to begin in earnest the extension of
j our merchant marine, and to that end Congress
; should at once provide such legislation as may be
! needed to protect and promote American industry on
| the sea as carefully as thnt on land.
An evening paper has something to say about
â  "Colonel" Bryan. Why the quotation marks? Many
opposed the appointment of Mr. Bryan, and yet, hay
; ing received his commission, his title does not call
for quotation marks any more than the title of any
! body else called from civil life does. Civility to the
volunteers is a popular and proper rule now.
Whenever American guns are turned against the
Spanish survivors among the latter send out word
that the firing did no harm. This is more than
mere whistling in a graveyard. It is whistling before
there has been a chance to make the necessary graves.
The first attack upon the ladies of the Red Cross
came from a source whence it might have been ex
pected. There is no necessity for naming it. Only
one daily paper in the world, or possibly two, could
have been guilty of an act so silly and brutal
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 1898.
\JI ILITARY attaches of foreign Governments
/ \ who are now with our armies and fleets
* * studying the war are quoted as expressing
admiration and something of astonishment at two of
our accomplishments. The first is the rapidity with
which the volunteer army has been raised and the
second the accuracy of our gunners.
It is the second point which has been the more
deeply impressive. With their large standing armies
ready for war the military experts of Europe are not
disquieted by the readiness of our young men to vol
unteer. There is nothing in that fact at all threaten
ing to them in case of a war with us. It is different,
however, with the marksmanship of our artillerists.
In the extraordinary skill of our gunners every Euro
pean military expert sees a superiority in war that is
full of warning for any power that might be pitted
against us.
Great Britain is our good friend in this crisis, and
hopes for a permanent friendship if not an alliance
with us, but even in Great Britain the accuracy of the
fire of our fleets has been noted with a surprise which
is not wholly pleased. The London Globe, for ex
ample, in commenting upon the war in a recent issue,
said the engagements at Manila and San Juan have
served to emphasize in the most startling manner the
advantage of superior marksmanship in naval war
fare. It asserts that this shows a "national danger"
for Great Britain, and says:
"Though our navy (the English) is wonderfully
efficient in every other respect, there can be no deny
ing the fact that the records of gun practice in it are
most unsatisfactory, indeed deplorable. There is no
getting away from the figures presented in the annual
reports of firing, and the merest tyro in naval matters
can understand from an examination of them the sig
nificant proportion of misses to hits. The fact is that
not anything like enough attention is given by the
Admiralty to the vital question of gunnery. The cap
tains of guns in a man-of-war are the most valuable
men in the ship; and, indeed, it is no exaggeration to
say that the fate of the empire one day may depend
upon the marksmanship of a few hundred men."
This statement from a British source is praise of a
high order, and will be flattering to our pride. It is
no slight thing to have performed feats that make
Great Britain doubtful of the invincible superiority of
her mighty navy. In our Civil War the deeds of the
Merrimac and the Monitor taught England that she
must reconstruct her fleets, and it now appears that
the achievements of our gunners are to teach her
that even her armor-clad battle-ships are worthless
unless she can man them with gunners equal to those
who handle the big guns under the American flag.
. Modern war is, in fact, developing along lines in
which the American holds an acknowledged super
iority in the world. The more victory becomes a
matter of mechanical skill and scientific accuracy the
more potent will be the United States. No other race
equals us in such accomplishments. We excel in
constructing machines and in handling them. If
other nations are to be matches for us in this respect
it is time for them to begin practicing.
EVIDENCES OF DAFTNESS.
THE war is evidently affecting the nerves of our
esteemed but eloquent contemporary, the Chron
icle. On any other theory it is impossible to
comprehend many of its recent poetic attempts. On
Sunday morning it poised its wings for a lony flight,
and began a column of drivel thus: "Watching from
the overlooking heights the great ship that sailed out
through the Golden Gate â out into the eye of the sun
with the waning day, with all its decks swarming
with armed men, and all the shores aflame with salut
ing banners â to every observer must have come the
thought that all this brave pomp of martial emprise
on a Western shore of the New World; this ship,
filled, like the Trojan horse, with strong-armed men
who were to pass within the walls and open the gates
of the Orient; this thunder of guns, this loud acclaim
of voices, all was very like a dream, or, if a reality, it
was the apocalypse of more momentous events, which
time had ripened for a coming and which it was not
within the power of human hands to stay."
The drift of this waxy-winged soar is not even
made clear by the caption. What does the Chronicle
mean by calling it "The Sailing of the Ship"? If
reference is made to the departure of the Peking,
City of Sydney and Australia with the Manila ex
peditionary forces it is wrong; there were three ships.
Further on the Chronicle speaks of a "departing
Argos" and a ship having ribs of "Dodonian oak,"
upon whose deck stride "demigods" bound for a "new
Colchis." This is all blind and unsatisfactory. The
ships which left for Manila were made of steel. They
did not go on a treasure-hunting expedition, and no
demigods bestrode their decks. The armed men who
filled those Trojan sea-saw "hosses" were bent on
"wah" â and it was not their fault that they were com
pelled to sail into the "eye of the sun." What would
our contemporary have them do? Sail into the ear
of the sun?
We cannot make out exactly whether this "Sailing
of the Ship" is intended as a Government roast or
not. The Chronicle's nerves have evidently been so
affected by the oratorical possibilities of the war that
it is unable to express itself clearly. If its intention
is to abuse the Government for sending troops to
Manila we trust that it will come out and say s,o in
unmistakable terms. Talleyrand declared that lan
guage was given to man so that he might conceal his
thoughts. But language was not conferred upon the
Chronicle for any such purpose. We demand that it
express itself. This thing of giving aid and comfort
to the enemy in column editorials which no human
being can understand approaches very close* to trea
son. During the Civil War the Examiner was mobbed
for seditious utterances. Our contemporary should
recall the Examiner's subsequent career and beware.
If the Chronicle intended its column of drivel to
pass as. "reflections" upon the departure of the ex
peditionary forces it should have said so. It is fre
quently dangerous to print editorials without accom
panying diagrams, and it is always dangerous for the
Chronicle to do so. Birds which attempt to fly before
the development of their wings usually wind up in a
mud puddle. It is so with immature journalistic
poets and orators'. In the absence of a diagram we
have construed "The Sailing of the Ship" to be a
Government roast. We venture to say that ninety
nine out of every hundred of our contemporary's sane
readers will so construe it. Those of its subscribers
who reside in asylums for the insane will rejoice to
know that the editor is soon to rejoin them.
There will be a readiness to believe that the South
Dakota soldier arrested as a burglar was simply on a
little spree, where many a good soldier had been be
fore him, and had no idea of robbing. The boys from
the "Bad Lands" should beware of Barbary Coast
whisky.
It is a little tough on Dr. Rottanzi to have got his
picturesque Manila togs and then be ordered to Santa
Cruz. But Santa Cruz is a pretty good place after all.
and the doctor, by wearing the new togs there, can
make himself the cynosure of summer beauty's eyes.

STILL GIVEN TO LYING.
The Idiotic Boasting of the Bulletin Results
in a Humiliating Exposure.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE CALL: I have just
read the Bulletin's boast that it "beat" all other papers
in announcing the news that General Merritt had been
appointed Military Governor of the Philippine Islands.
It prints a list of papers, more or less obscure, which
gave the Bulletin credit for this news, and complains
that "everywhere but in San Francisco the Bulletin
received credit and was recognized as the source of
the information." That the Bulletin did not receive
such recognition in San Francisco was because the
newspapers and the people knew that it secured its
dispatch from The Call's bulletin board. I wired that
bulletin to The Call at 3P.M. on May 1 1, and it was
posted at the Call office at 12:15, San Francisco time.
The Bulletin not only stole this important item of
news from The Call's board, but was careless
enough not to cover up its theft by changing the dic
tion. C. C. CARLTON,

One night last week Mrs. Jackson, burn
ing with expectations of a shopping tour,
had made an appointment with her hus
band to meet him in the Oriental room
of the Palace and they were then to make
the rounds of the dry goods establish
ments, together. Mrs. Jackson was there
true to the preconcerted plans, but i the
tardy husband was not. Visions of rib
bons and silks and chiffons kept assail
ing the retina of Mrs. Jackson's eyes until
past endurance. Patience had ceased to
be a virtue, and the anxiety tugging away
at Mrs. Jackson's heart strings was great,
so she left word at the office of the hotel
that if her husband, George W. Jackson,
should come in he would find her at the
White House.

Soon after leaving the office, a George
W. Jackson did come In, but it was a
George W. Jackson of Philadelphia. He
sauntered up to the desk and asked the
clerk for his key, when he was told that
his wife was watting for him at the White
House. "The you say," was the re
ply, accompanied with breath-shaking aÂ«
toniÃhment. "I left my wife in Philadel
phia just before coming out here." The
clerk was uncompromising, and persisted
in denials until the Philadelphia Mr. Jack
son was reduced to a state of doubt, and
then he was lost. Inquiring the locality
of the dry goods business, he fairly flew
over the stonea until he reached the
place. A careful search for his
spouse proved fruitless in results, and
Mr. Jackson returned to the hotel a sad
der if not a wiser mbti.
A consultation was then held, the regis
ter examined, and light was discovered
where darkness reigned before.

BALLY AGAIN.
To arms! to arms', la now the cry.
Throughout our Fatherland,
And partiots' hearts are beating high
At sound of the command.
See! how they answer to the call
As did their sires of old.
Each one prepared to yield his all,
His blood, his life, his gold.
No party now! In this broad land.
No Xorth or South Is known;
All, all, as one together stand,
Each makes the call his own.
The workman drops the tools he plied,
The clerk lays down his pen;
And students cast their books aside.
No longer boys, but men.
They rally round the flag we love.
Its prestige to maintain.
Resolved that It shall wave above
The tyrant flag of Spain.

THE TEST OF GENIUS.
Genius is the capacity to do things.
That is why we call Napoleon and Far
ragut and NelÃon and Paul Jones and
George Washington geniuÃes. That is
why in this war we have added Dewey
to the list.
There was a Spanish fleet in the Philip
pines. Dewey was ordered to find it and
smash it. With the least possible delay
he found it and smashed it.
The country is waiting now for some
other men to enroll their names in the
list of geniuses.
Admiral Sampson, Commodore Schley
and Commodore Watson have under their
control much greater fleets than Dewey's,
while the Spanish fleet which they are
set to catch is greatly inferior to their
own.
If they promptly do something: decisive
to that fleet we shall recognize them as
geniuses. But we are now wearily quot

How long, how long In Infinite pumult?

To the Editor of The Call-Dear Sir: I
When a general or admiral wins a battle
why is if that all the credit is given to

All praise to Dewey and his men, not

MEANING OF THE FLAG.
The Boston Herald did not copyright
its famous idea that the American flag
is nothing in particular but a piece of
buntingâ any other rag would be as good.
So there are mugwump philosophers and
papers of the decadent style which freely
preach the same doctrine. They make
small headway.
He is a poor fool who holds his coun
try's flag in no higher esteem than these
do. Those of them who unfortunately
dwell among us should have been at
Quonset Point yesterday afternoon and
heard the eloquent words of General
Ames in presenting the colors to the new
regiment. He did not waste any. They
all told. Additional interest was given
them by the recollection that he, in 1861,
received for his regiment a set of colors
and President Lincoln said to him:
"Young man, guard these colors as you
would the honor of your mother. Fight
for them, and, if needs be, die for them,
for should they fall free government will
disappear from off the face of the earth.
Injustice and oppression will continue to
reign; right, liberty and peace will have
no abiding place among men."
Oh! The flag does mean something To
every man who is not a thing of shoddy,
heart and aoul, body and brains, it means'
all that is worth living and working for
and dying for.â Providence (R. I.) Tele

THE PRESIDENT'S ENDURANCE.
We recall that during the Presidential
campaign a good many Democratic edi
torial writers entertained grave doubts of
the ability of William McKinley to stand
the strain to which he was subjected.
They hinted pretty strongly that his ago
was against him; that his physical forces
were not what a President of the United
States should possess. They are keeping
a profound silence on that point nowadays
and wisely. The power of endurance
shown by President McKinley has aston
ished even those persons who were most
intimately acquainted with him and who
thought they knew the full limit of his
physical abilities.
From the day that he became the nomi
nee for President his life has been one of
i great activity, and for many months he
i has been subjected to a mental and phys-
I ical strain that would have sent many
j younger men to bed unfit for work, but he
i appears to be as well balanced mentally
and as strong physically to-day as he was
two years ago when leading a compara
tively quiet and peaceful life. â Trenton
(N. J.) Gazette.
SOUTHERN BATTLE ABBE--.
The Richmond (Va.) Times publishes
the call by General J. B. Gordon to the
camps of Confederate veterans to raise
funds for the building of a Battle Abbey
"In which shall be gathered relics to tell
the world, and especially our children's
children to the remotest generation, of
the valor and deeds of our comrades, the
soldiers of the South, and of our noble
women, who, amid unparalleled sacri
fices, cheered and sustained us during the
storm of war; and in which shall be pre
served, in archive records, tue true his
tory of our Southland, of her statesmen,
her armies and navy, of her battles, her
victories and her defeats."
At the last reunion of the Confederate
veterans a resolution was adopted calling
upon each camp to subscribe to this glo
rious purpose in proportion to its mem
bership. Each camp of thirty members
was asked to raise not less than $o: each
camp of fifty members, not less than $10;
each camp of one hundred members, not
less than $15. and- each camp of two hun
dred or more members, not less than $25.

MOVING TROOPSâ W. J. S.. City. The
President of the United States is not sub
ject to the orders of Congress in regard
to the movement of troops. He derives
his power to move troops by the author
ity of the Constitution, which declares
that "the President shall be commander
in-chief of the army and navy of the
United States, and of the militia of the
several States when called into the actual
service of the United States. 1 '
ARMY AND NAVYâ A Native Son,
Turlock, Cal. There is no way to deter
mine how many men the United States
could put into the army and navy. There
are in the United States about 15,000,000
men of militia acre, but it is probable
that not more than 10.000,000 would be
qualified for service. How many of that
number would volunteer is something
that no one can tell, but if it came to an
invasion of the country by a foreign foe,
and there was a general call for defense,
it is more than likely that nearly all of
the available men would offer their serv
ices.
GENERAL LEE'S SWORDâ S., City.
When General Lee surrendered to Grant
at the house of farmer McLean, at Ap
pomattox, on the 9th of April, 1865. he did
not surrender his sword, nor was it de
manded of him. While Grant was writing
the stipulations of surrender he looked at
Lee, who sat opposite to him, and notic
ing his sword, altered the terms of the
provisions, in that he inserted that
officers should be allowed to retain their
side arms, horses and personal property.
Lee was perceptibly moved when, on read
ins: the terms, he noticed the interpola
tion, which meant so much to the soldier.
MAIL TO ST. MICHAELâ ChIco. Cal.
The Postal Department has regular days
to send mail to St. Michael. Letters that
go from San Francisco are sent to Seattle
and from there assorted for northern
points. All that you have to do is to
drop your letter in your local postoffiee
and the authorities will attend to the
forwarding. It is not necessary to in
dorse the letter "via San Francisco."
Letters that are sent so as to reach Se
attle by the 14th of each month for north
ern points will be forwarded on the 15th.
Mail will also be sent as often as pos
sible when there is opportunity to send
by reliable vessels.
POISON OAK AGAlNâ Another corre
spondent writing from Coulterville. com
menting upon the remedy for poison oak
suggested by another correspondent, says
that "the" remedy is that recommended
by the United States Department of Agri
culture, which is alcohol BO to 75 per cent
pure, containing as much sugar of lead
as will dissolve in it. The year book of
that department says: "The milky fluid
should be well rubbed into the affected
skin, and the operation repeated several
times during the course of a few days.
The itching is at once relieved and the
further progress of the malady checked.
The remedy has been tried in a large
number of cases and has always proved,
successful, but it must be remembered
that it is itself a poison when taken into
the mouth." The correspondent adds
that as the poison from the poison oak
is itself an oil, one can readily see that
any unctuous application would spread
it. He also suggests that the clothing of
the patient should be changed dally, that
he may not take up the poison that has
been rubbed on to his clothing from hia
affected skin.
DISPOSITION OF PROPERTYâ D. E.
P., City. Upon the death of the wife the
entire community property in California
goes to the surviving husband without
administration, except such portion
thereof as may have been set apart by
judicial decree for her support and maln
i tenance. That is subject to her testa
mentary disposition and goes to her
i descendants and heirs exclusive of her
husband.
In case a wife haa separate property,
dies without making a will and leaves no
issue, one-half of the property goes to
the surviving husband and the other half
in equal shares to the father and mother
of the decedent. If either the father or
mother is dead, the half that would have
devised to that one who died goes to the
survivor also. If neither father nor mother
mother Is living the property goes to
brothers and sisters and children of de
ceased brothers or sisters by right of
representation in equal shares. If there
is neither issue, father, mother, brothers
or sisters or children of deceased brothers
or sisters, the whole goes to the surviv
ing husband. If none of the heirs enum
erated are living the property goes to the
next of kin.

Words of Commendation
for the Troops Com
prising rjis Com
n)and.
THE blanks necessary for the en
rollment and muster In of Califor
nia's quota of troops under the
6econd call have been forwarded
from Washington to the Adjutant-
General of the State and will probably
be here the latter part of this week.
It Is now surmised that only infan
trymen are required. Orders are out
to recruit to the maximum of 106 per
company all the companies mustered
into the service of the United States
from California. Recruiting stations
will be established in this city, Oak
land, San Jose, Stockton, Fresno, Sac
ramento and other places. After the
existing organizations are recruited to
the maximum, less than 800 men will
be needed to fill the quota under the
second i a 11.
Tho eight companies of the Bixth In
fantry will be recruited to the maxi
mum strength of 106 to a company and
four muie companies may be added to
give full regimental strength of three
battalions. Governor Budd and Ad
jutant-General Barrett were not pre
pared to say yesterday whether orders
would be issued to add another bat
talion to the Sixth.
The impression may exist that Cal
ifornia is not making haste to respond
to the second call, but when the facts
are brought to light it will be clearly
that the military authorities at
Washington are responsible for the
going methods. The orders re
ceived from the War Department are
(.'â¢nfusing and conflicting. The Gov
ernor is yet to be informed whether
the President desires the quota under
the second call to be all infantry, or
Borne infantry organizations and other
organizations of artillery and cavalry.
The Governor has told the War Depart
ment that he could supply the United
States with three troops of cavalry and
?<>me day the department may reply to
his suggestion.

try has been ignored, humiliated and

company of the Sixth has already been

THE BAN FBANCISCO CAX.L,, TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 1898.
GENERAL MERRITT ON THE
SHORTAGE OF TRANSPORTS
The Chief of the Manila Expedition Makes a Plain Statement With
out Criticism of the War Department.
The sailing date of the second expedition to the Philippines has not yet been decided upon. It Is safe to say
that the three transports now engaged and in preparation for the voyage to Manila will not be able to sail until
some time next week. The troops for this expedition will all be fully equipped before that time. The trouble
with the forwarding of re-enforcements to Dewey is owing to a lack of proper transportation facilities, which
will be remedied as soon as possible. A dispatch from Washington says that two regiments now in San Fran
cisco are said to be so poorly equipped that General Merritt, commanding the Philippine expeditionary forces,
refuses to take them. In reply to inquiries in regard to this statement and other matters General Merritt last
evening said:
"There is no truth in the statement that I have refused to take any troops that have
been sent here or have been offered to me. lam exceedingly well pleased with the material.
It is just about as good as there is in this country. Of course there is room for improvement
in discipline and drill, which will come in time. It must be remembered that these troops are
new. I have the word of officers who have seen other troops in the country, and they say
that the forces now here average up as well as those of any command that has been organ
ized since the breaking out of the war with Spain.
"So far as the equipment of the troops is concerned, that is a matter that is easily ar
ranged. All the troops destined for Manila will be fully equipped as fast as the resources of the
War Department will permit. These troops will be completely outfitted long before the
transports are ready, so that there will be no trouble or delay in that respect.
"My only complaint now is the delay in the furnishing of transports. I have repre
sented to the War Department that the transports are coming in very slowly. After I make
the shipment of troops contemplated by the three vessels â the China, Colon and Zealan
dia â I will have forwarded to the Philippines but one-fourth of the command. The want of
transports is the crying want of the expedition. Twenty thousand men are to be sent to
Manila. The three vessels which I have just mentioned will carry only about 2500. There
are now on the way across the Pacific 2500 troops, so you can easily see the situation. Ido
not wish to be understood as making any complaint or any criticism of the War Department.

master of the Seventh California, has
been officially notified of the confirmation
r.f his captaincy by the United States
Senate.
Major Friederich, Captain Carriston and
Lieutenant Merrill of the Thirteenth Min
nesota, with twelve men. left for Minne
sota last night for the purpose of obtain
ing the necessary men to bring the com
panies up to the required strength. Cap
tains Elliott and Clarke and Lieutenant
W. A. Deford of the Twentieth Kansas
will return to that State for the same
purpose, and a detail from the Seventh
California will go shortly to Los Angeles.
Colonel Little, Twentieth Kansas, took
his entire command yesterday over to the
Sutro baths and let the soldiers enjoy the
luxury of a bath.
ARTILLERY IN CAMP.
Four Batteries of the Third
and Two of Volunteers on
the Presidio Plain.
The big drill plain &\ the Presidio is fill
ing up with tentÃ again. Yesterday Bat
teries G, H, X and L of the Third Artil
j lery. and Batteries A and D of the Cali
'â¢ fornia Battalion, went into camp where
i the First California Infantry was
quartered prior to its departure
i for Manila. Major Rice Is in com'
; mand of the volunteer battalion,
i while Major Hess of the Third United
States Artillery has command of the two
battalions. Both officers have gone Into
camp with their commands, the head
quarters being located about on the site
where Colonel Berry of the Seventh
pitched his tent. Ample room has been
allowed for the tents, the streets being
broad enough for the free marching of
the batteries to and from their quarter*.
In fact, it is an ideal camp, and if the
regimental band, which 1h now stationed
away out in the fortifications at Fort
Point, were attached to the battalion it
would prove most attractive to visitors.
Battery I) of Major Rice's command is
still in barracks at the post, but will be
moved to Fort Baker, at Lime Point, to
day or to-morrow. The remaining three
batteries of the Third, A, E and I, are at
Fort Point.
Major Hess has received no orders re
garding the future movements of his
command, but he expects to remain
where he is for the present. He is busy
recruiting his command to its full
strengthâ 2oo men to the batteryâ and he
does not look for orders to proceed to Ma
nila before the third expedition la desig
, nated. The recruiting office established
i at Los Angeles 1s shipping him twelve to
i fifteen men daily, and these must be
! drilled and equipped. Infantry and cay
' airy are of more service In the Philip
i pines Just now thar heavy artillery, for
i the Spaniards must be driven back and
â¢ the fortifications captured before the ar-

, with the first expedition, is sufficient to

CAMP COURT-MARTIAL.
A Pennsylvania Fifer Cut the
Pantaloons of a Negro.
General Otis has appointed the following
court-martial to convene to-day and sit
without regard to hours for the purpose
of trying all such cases as may be
brought before it: First Nebraska, Lieu
tenant-Colonel George R. Cotton, presi
dent; Major J. M. Statsenburg, Captains
G. H. Holdeman, F. A. Williams, J. G.
Painter, J. N. Kilian. Lieutenants C. H.
Ough, C. L. Jens, F. B. Naracong, F.
Gegner, F. M. Yale, H. L. Archer. Utah
Cavalry, Captain Came, and Lieutenant
Benner X. Smith, judge advocate.
The court convened yesterday morning,
but adjourned without trying any cases.
One of the most interesting cases that
will come up before the general court
martial to-day will be that of John Camp
bell, a fifer In the Tenth Pennsylvania
Regiment, whn has been under arrest ever
Since the regiment left Mt. Gretna, Pa.,
for cutting the breeches off a negro strik
er, who belonged to Company C of the
Pennsylvania Artillery, which was then
camped at Mt. Gretna.
Campbell enlisted in the Tenth as a
fifer, and truly he is said to liave blown
a wonderful reed, but alas, there were
times, not infrequent, when he was wont
to blow the foam from too many beers. It
so happened that the captain of Battery C
sent the colored striker to Altoona to
purchase some whisky for the officers'
mess, and the negro was so unfortunate
as to go into the same barroom where
Campbell, who was already drunk, was
just tossing off another.
The fifer, as soon as he saw the negro
In uniform, became enraged, and draw-
Ing a razor he proceeded to hold up the
frightened striker, and to carefully re
move the trouser legs from the knee
down. Then he made the unfortunate
darkey buy the whisky, which he, Camp
bell, drank, and thenâ well then he was
arrested, and has been in the guard house
ever since, but not in irons as was re
ported.
FONTANA BARRACKS.
Washington Volunteers Sail
Under Sealed Orders to
Angel Island.
Company F of the Second Battalion of
the Washington volunteers, at Fontar.a
Barracks, received orders yesterday
morning to embark on the steamer Mc-
Dowell. No one knew the destination, as
the instructions were sealed and not t<i
be opened until after the steamer had
left the dock. It was a mystery to
everybody, but no one asked any ques
tions, not even the officers. Many thought
that this was to be a starter of the Wash
ington men toward Manila and they
eagerly hoped the Philippines was their
destination. The steamer, however, land
ed them at Angel Island for temporary
guard duty. This company of eighty-one
men is officered by Captain Chester F.
Miller, First Lieutenant Charles F. Book
er and Second Lieutenant George B. Dorr.
During the time they were at Fontana
Barracks there was not a sick or drunk
en man in the company. These men come
from Eastern Washington, are well up
in drill and discipline, and are a credit to
the volunteer service.
Lieutenant Colonel Fife is still protest
ing against the repeated statements that
the Washington volunteers are not likeiy
to go to Manila. He says his command,
of which he is very proud, is the equal in
every respect of any regiment now here,
and it is but an act of Justice that the
Washlngtonians should be permitted to
be among the representatives of the Pa
cific' Coast in the Manila expeditionary
forces.
The rumor that the Washington men
are soon to go into camp at the Presidio
is not credited at Fontana Barracks,
where they have been located since they
have been in San Francisco.
NO LONGER CORPORAL.
C. P Ames Receives a Wel-
come Communication.
Corporal C. P. Ames, of Company D,
First Nebraska Regiment of Volunteers,
will be discharged from his regiment in a
few days. Yesterday Colonel Bratt, com
manding the regiment, was officially or
dered by Secretary of War Alger to dis
charge Ames. The young soldier does not
leave the service in disgrace, for along
with the order to Colonel Bratt, there
also came one to Corporal Ames himself,
notifying him that as the result of having
passed successfully the preliminary ex
amination he is to report on the Ist of
March, 1899, to the commandant of the
corps of cadets at West Point Military
Academy.
Some time ago Corporal Ames, who has
been for two years in the National Guard,
took the competitive examination at Lin
coln, Neb., and being successful, was ap
pointed to the academY by Congressman
Strode of Nebraska. -Corporal Ames is
19 years of ago. He was born in Illinois,
but raised in Nebraska. He is a gradu
ate of the University of Nebraska, where
he took a course in electrical engineer-
Ing.
The corporal expects to go to the train
ing school of Lieutenant Charles Boden.

| Recruiting for the Regular
Army.
The various recruiting offices for the
regular army are receiving a very large
number of applicants, and nearly all of
them are of a very good class of men.
Among those who have applied since Sat
urday to Lieutenant Quan, Third Artil
lery, room 229 Phelan building, are two
Sacramento high school boys, one Cornell
graduate, one man who passed eighteen
months in West Point Military Academy

day morning in the Examiner building,
Third street side, and received about thir
ty-five applicants during the day, nearly
all of whom will pass. Lieutenant Hunt
has hung his banner on the outer wall,
and it is attracting a great deal of at
tention. It reads: "Wantedâ Men for the
Fourteenth Infantry, to go and help
Dewey."
Two tralnloads of recruits for the regu
lar army are expected here within the
next few days from Fort McPherson,
Georgia.

cruits while there, in order to bring his
company up to the maximum of 106 men

partment. As Company F ctme from Sac
ramento originally. Captain Lucey would
prefer to have all his men from that
place to recruiting up with strangers.
Sergeant J. Alexander and Private
Word of Company F will not accompany
it to Santa Cruz. Sergeant Alexander has
been detailed as sergeant major of the
regiment, and Word is acting as quarter
master sergeant. Consequently both will
remain at headquarters.

EXPLANATION.
Th arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures ai station indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, if any, the
amount of rainfall or of mt-lted snow in inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
n!r pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
-rature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington roast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather mey be expected
in dimmer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
iipposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOf'K MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 6.â The stock market
started this morning with every appearance of
Saturday's brisk upward movement being con
tinued. London was a buyer here at the open
ing even at thÂ» higher level over London par
ity. Rumors aiirÂ»ad of an approaching move
ment by Spain for peace helped Americans in
London. The heaviness of . Government bonds
was due to the conviction that an additional
issue will soon be authorized and uttered. The
brisk upward movement .at | the opening was
checked i.y several developments. One of these
was the rather emphatic disclaimer on behalf
of Burlington officials of any Immediate pur
pose to project a refunding plan. Another well
denned conviction on the part of the profes
sional speculators was that Union Pacific pre
ferred would soon. begin the payment of divi
dends at the rate of 4 per cent. This was
met to-day by the strong semi-official Intima
tion that the dividend rate might be for the
present only 3 per ; cent. These two develop
ments constituted a drag â  on two very im
portant elements' in the market. When Lon
don saw that' the advance here was not main
tained -It' turn. '.from buyer to seller. Many
of the leading grangers and : internationals are
thus nearly a point under the beat prices of the
day. a The whole' list lost something from best
prices in sympathy, but the lower priced
stocks firmly held. â 
' Money continues very cheap.
â  Bonds reflected the pressure of cheap money
seeking employment and some of the lower
grade speculative bonds were very largely
bought on the advancing prices. Total sales,

REVEAL FRAUD
Attorney Kinard Stirs
Up a Hornets' Nest.
JUSTICE'S FEES DISPUTED
GRAND JURY CALLED TO
GETHER TO TAKE ACTION.
Brooklyn and Oakland Townships
Officials Indulge in a War
That May Prove
Serious.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 6.
Tha fight between the constables of
Brooklyn ami Oakland townships has ta
ken on a new appearance. This morning
Attorney C. E. Kmard appeared before
the Supervisors to argue in the matter of
his protest against the bills of Consta-
Koch and Cronin and Justice F. C.
Clift of Oakland Township. Kinard as-
Berts that Koch has made arrests for
his own beneiit and has charged illegal
fees.
Kinard also alleges that Cronin has
gone outside of his district to make ar
rests and that Judge Clift has made ille
gal charges, although he offers no de
tails to substantiate his allegations.
Attorney Kinard lives in Fruitvale, and
hus, according to the Oakland officials,
ised the cause of the Brooklyn con
etables, between whom and Justice CUft'a
court there is considerable rivalry.
Kinard was preparing to iugue his
case when Mr. Roeth moved that the
whole matter be referred to the finance
committee. Mr. Church seconded the
motion. Kinard did not approve of this
summary way of dealing with his busi
ana â aid: "I have brought poor men
here us witnesses and I us.k that their
testimony in the matter be taken now."
Attorneys Nusbaumer and M. C. Chap
man, representing the constables, stated j
that Mr. Kinard is not a taxpayer, and
Nusbaumer also suggested that he knew
â something about Mr. Kinard outside of
this case.
The niution to send the matter to the
committee was unanimously passed, and |
then Chairman Talcott asked by whuse
authority Kinard had summoned the wit
. and waa told the subpoenues were
signed by the County Clerk.
â¢'I want to tell you, sir," Baid Chair
man Talcott, addressing Mr. Kinard,
"that you have no right to summon wit
â  in the name of this board unless
we give you that right. A man told me
you had subpoenaed him and he was
afraid to disregard it as an order of the
:, and yet he could not come, so I
took the personal responsibility of telling
him to pay no attention to it."
District Attorney Snook informed Mr.
Kinard that he had no right to issue
a -s, upon which Mr. Chap
that probabiy Mr. Kinard
thought he was superior to the board and
t Attorney's office.
Mr. Kinard did not like these remarks,
Anally asked for authority to issue
the subpoenaes. As he was unable to
give th>' aames of the witnesses he want
ed, the whole matter went over till next
w >â¢â¢ k. The attorney finally said that he
intended to bring a criminal charge
against somebody before that time.
The Grand Jury adjourned last Wednes
day to meet on the 21st inst. Foreman
Crooks has called them together for to
morrow afternoon. It is asserted t .at
the matter of constable fees and charges
is the cause of the sudden move. It is
believed that the charges and counter
â  s recently made have given the ln
- dors sufficient facts upon which
to act
Death of E. A. Pitkin.

to Alameda to live about ten years ago.
The <ause of death was old age. His

ing at 10 o'clock, and the interment will

SAFEGUARDS FOX
YUKON PASSENGERS
LOCAL BOARD OF INSPECTORS
GIVE WARNING.
River Steamers May Be Towed to the !
Gold Districts as Barges or Car
ried as Freight Only.
Considerable stir was caused in the Cus
tom-house yesterday because of a report
that the steamer Samoa, which was about
to clear for St. Michael, had been selling
tickets for sixty passengers, whereas sne
was entitled to take only thirty-five. It
wus stated also that she was to take the
river steamer Clara in tow and that this
also was an infringement of the Federal
regulations.
Collector Jackson heard of the reports,
and addressed a letter of inquiry to the
United States Local Inspectors of Steam
Vessels, and received the following note
In reply:
Colonel J. P. Jackson, Collector of Custom*â
Kir: For your Information we will state that a
large number of steamers have applied to this
board for Inspection to ply on waters of the
Yukon River and other inland waters of
Alaska. To these, river or bay craft we have
In every case granted certificates to ply on
waters of the bay of San Francisco and trlbu
â¢ nly. Such steamers, therefore, are not
'empowered by their inspection certificates to
under steam to their destination.
We understand that some of these craft were
taken in sections, others upon the decks of Ball
ing vessels, and still others have been or are
to be towed in the wake of regular ocean
â¢teamers.
In the latter case It is our opinion that such
: hould be towed us KirÃep. Very re
ei>ectfully r O. F. HOLLES,
.!' iHN K. Hl't-OER,
United Ptates Local Inspectors.
Collector Jackson at once gave orders
thjit the. stories as to vessels bound for
Alaska taking on more passengers than
allowed by 1;lw should be investi
gated, and the practice stopped if such
should be the case. He called the atten
tion of masters of vessels in that trade
to the following Bection of the Revised
Statutes of the United States:
Beetioa 4465â 1t shall not be lawful to take
on board of any steamer a greater number of
L>assen<?< rs than is stated in the certificate of
and for every violation of this
provision the master or owner shall be liable
to any pf-raon suing for the same, to forfeit
the amount of passage money and ten dollars
lor each passenger beyond the number allowed.
It was found that the report as to the
Samoa taking on more passengers than
\v(-r" allowed by law was not true, and
Deputy Collector Farley, by request of
(!<rk Jerome, ]>repared the following in
structions to Colonel T. H. Craig, en
trance and clearance clerk:
The following rules regarding the clearance
of vessels f"r Alaskan ports are formulated In
accordance with the Collector* â  Instructions.
River iti 1:1 â¢ n Inspected at San Francisco to
navigate the water* of Kan Francisco Bay and
trihuiarleH thereof cannot be cleared for
Alaska.
If intended to take tliem to Alaska they must
he towed by some steamer which has been ln
ipected to navigate the Pacific Ocean between
San Francisco and ports In Alaska.
When a steamer having a river steamer In
tow Is cleared, an additional copy of the clear
ance of the towing steamer will be taken, by
the master and should by him be placed on
board the steamer being towed to show In case
the towed steamer breaks away from the towing
steamer through stress of weather or other un
i avoidable cause, that she Is not attempting
to navigate the high sVas in violation of law.
â  If a barge without steam or sail power Is be
ing towed, a notation of â  the facts must be
madÂ« on the clearance of the towing steamer;
and if the barge Is laden with cargo a list of
raid cargo must appear on ; the manifest of thÂ«
towing steamer under proper heading.
If a steamer Is towing a sailing vessel, both
must be required to obtain regular clearances.
If the inspection of steamers does not author
ize her to navigate the waters of the Pacific
Ocean, Including the water* of Alaska, clear
ance will be refused until the certificate of in
spection Is amended by the local Inspectors of
Hulls and Boilers. â â  â  â¢N. S. FARLEY.
. Deputy Collector of Customs.
John. K. Bulerer of the Board of Local
Inspector* of Steam Vessels, said that the
board had acted in the interest of hu
manity, to prevent the drowning of pas
sengers bound to the Yukon.
STABBED BY A SOLDIER.
Chefare Palboucchi's Coxmpleion May-
Cost Him His Life.
Chefare Palboucchl, a 16year-old boy,
was perhaps fatally stabbed by George
A. Mangen at a late hour last night.
The boy, who is very dark and some
what resembles a Spaniard, was n earing
his home on O'Farell street, when the
soldier stepped up behind him and mak
ing the remark that he was "looking for
trouble," plunged a knife into his back.
He then turned and ran, but after a short
chase was captured by Officer Prentiss.
The boy was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Prentiss dressed the
wound. It was found that the knife had
penetrated three inches, and recovery is
doubtful.
Mangen was locked up on a charge of
assault to murder, and the only reason
for committing the crime that his friends
can give is that he took the boy to be a
Spaniard, and being drunk at the time,
was hardly aware of what he was do
ing - ~^
A Soldier Meanly Treated.
George Gergefes, a soldier, fell asleep
on Market street near Second last night.
A stranger approached htm, and in an ap
parently sympathetic manner assisted
him to his feet. In order to lighten the
burden of the servant of Uncle Sam the |
I kindhearted stranger also relieved him of |
! $4. The act was witnessed by several by- |
standers, who at once gave chase. The
! man was captured on Mission street and
I arrested by Officer Bush, who took him to
! the Central Police Station, where he was I
charged with robbery. The man gives his
name as George Dunbar.
~m~.
Wants an Accounting.
Burnette G. Haskell, the attorney, has
been sued by Noble Fisher for an ac- )
counting. Fisher alleges that he em- :
ployed Haskell as his attorney in a fore-
Closure suit in November of 1896, to re- ;
cover money due on a note secured by a
mortgage on the steamer Dwyer. Ilus
kell sold the steamer in pursuance of an- :
thority conferred by a power of sale, but
the plaintiff in the action filed yesterday
1 claims that a complete settlement of tho :
i trust has not as yet been made by the at
! torney and he now prays the court for
an order to compel Haskell to render an
! accounting.
He Was Not a Burglar.
Lawrence Reynolds, the member of
Company B, South Dakota Regiment, I
who was arrested early Sunday morning
on the charge of attempting to enter the
! house of Charles Hackmeier on Broderjck
street, was sent to the camp by Judge
Low yesterday in charge of a lieutenant ,
of his" company. It was shown that Key- '
nolds was too drunk to know what he was ;
doing and Hackmeier declined to swear to
I a complaint against him.

DIXON BESTS SANTRY
IN TWENTY ROUNDS
Gains the Decision at the End of a
Clean and Scientific
Contest.
NEW YORK, June 6.â George Dixon,
the harfl> colored boxer, gained a deci
sion over Eddie Santry of Chicago, be
; fore the Lenox Athletic Club to-night, j
j They fought twenty clean and scientific i
, rounds, in which Santry proved himself \
j a clever ring general. His defensive work i
was admirable, and he was very shifty
' and cleverly blocked m;iiiy of Dixon's
i leads. Both were comparatively fresh at
; the end of the twentieth round, and while
I the decision of Referee Charley White
' was a just one, it did not give general
satisfaction. Neither man went to the
flo6r during the twenty rounds.
Dixon began the fight by rushing, and
the iirst round was all â¢Dixon's. He land
ed twice on the head, once on the wind
and twice on the ribs without receiving
I a blow in return. After the first round,
i the Chicago lad gave a good account of
himself, though Dixon continued the ag
gressor. In only one round, the sixth,
did the Chicago boy appear to have any
advantage over Dixon, but he drew the
only blood in the eleventh round, when
Dixon'a eye began to bleed, after San
try had landed a hard right on the face.
Kid McCoy was at the ring side and
; informed Matchmaker O'Rourke that he
! had Injured one of his legs while train
i Ing. O'Rourke said the McCoy-Choynski
1 bout, which was to have taken place be
! fore this club on the 27th of this month,
i would have to be postponed in conse
quence, and a bout between Dixon and
Ben Jordan of England would be substt
! tuted. McCoy and O'Rourke will meet
Choynskl's representatives to-morrow,
when another date for the match will be
arranged.
GOES TO RUSSIA
TO SEEK CONTRACTS
Irving M. Scott of the Union Iron
Works Will Build Boats for
the Czar.
NEW YORK, June 6.â lrving M. Scott
will leave for St. Petersburg on the North
German Lloyd liner Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse in the morning to seek contracts
for warships from the Russian Govern
ment. His son, Lawrence Irving Scott, a
student at Cornell University, and Dr.
George Chismore, a physician of San
Francisco, will accompany him.
When seen at the Holland House to
night, Mr. Scott said: "I wish you would
correct for me the statement that I have
been called to St. Petersburg by any offi
cial of that Government. I have, however,
sufficiently reliable information to justify
me in proceeding to Russia. There is a
disposition in other countries to patronize
America more than heretofore. I shall
probably be in Russia for two months."
Sundry Civil Bill.
WASHINGTON, June 6.â The report of
the conference committee on the sundry
civil appropriation bill was made to the
two houses to-day and accepted by the !
Senate. There was a disagreement on the
more important of the Senate amend
ments and concurrence in a majority of
the others by the House conferees.

ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT DAUNT
LESS, off Santiago de Cuba, June 5
(via Kingston, Jamaica, June 6, 1
a. m.). â Whether or not the American j
fleet sank a Spanish torpedo boat de- j
stroyer on Friday night has not been I
absolutely ascertained.
At 10 o'clock Friday night the cruiser j
i New Orleans discovered what appeared j
I to be a torpedo boat destroyer close to
j the shore and signaled the flagship
; New York that it was evident that a
night torpedo attack was to be made.
The New York and New Orleans open
ed fire and their shells burst around
the dark object. Finally a 13-lnch
shell from the Massachusetts (not the !
Oregon, as first reported) was fired and j
j exploded, and the searchlights of the j
j vessels were turned on the spot where
| the supposed destroyer had been sight
i ed, but not a trace of the boat could be
i found, and it was believed by the offi
cers of the New York that she had
| been sunk.
The first assumption was that the
: vessel was the Terror, but it is believed
j now that it was the Pluton or the Fu
', ror, as the Terror is not understood to
i have been at Santiago. On Saturday I
two Schwarzkopf torpedoes were found
floating two miles south of El Morro.
This class of torpedo is used by the
Spanish, and one of the two round had
I only a practice head.
Many officials of the fleet believe that
a darkened railway train that was
; moving along the shore whs the real
object of the bombardment, instead of
! a destroyer. No wreckage has been
I found; no bodies have been noticed,
: and it is possible that the torpedoes
were some of those fired at the collier
Merrlmac when Lieutenant Hobson
sunk, her. _,^_____^____

Guffey Succeeds Harrity.
WASHINGTON, June 6.-J. M. Guffey
has been made the representative of the
State of Pennsylvania on the Democratic
National Committee to succeed Hon. Wil
liam F. Harrity. Harrity and Guffey
were notified of the change by Senator
Jones of Arkansas, who is chairman of
the committee. The substitution of Guf
fey's name is the result of a poll of the
National Committee made through the
mail by Senator Jones. , It grows out of
the representatives of the Democrats of
Pennsylvania, who, first through their
State committee and later through their
State convention, requested that Har
rity's name be dropped and Guffey's
added, on the general ground that Har
rity had ceased to be in accord with his
party.

pugilists together in the Hotel Bartholdi
last night, and- there the man who defeat
ed Corbett promised to give the new aspi
rant for heavyweight honors a chance to
prove his worth.
BILLY ELMER'S HAIR
LOST HIM MONEY.
WAS MATCHED TO FIGHT THE
CHAMPION OF HUMBOLDT.
But the Thespian's Locks Gave Him
Away and the Contest Was
Declared Off.
George Green Is supposed to be in some
Northwestern city, but his old partner,
Billy Elmer, is lecturing on "Theatricals"
and, incidentally, bagging a few dollars
by whipping the bully boy of some coun
try town.
But Billy is not always successful in
! pugilistic ventures. A traveling salesman
! for a large local firm tells the following
story of Elmer's latest adventure in the j
wilds of Humboldt County.
"On Saturday, May 28, Elmer, dressed .
in the habiliments of a woodchopper, en- j
tered the town of Swanger, where a box- j
ing entertainment was programmed for |
that evening, and, after interviewing sev- S
eral of the loading sports of the town on i
fistic matters principally, he incidentally :
challenged the winner of the light which !
i was to be the event of the evening.
"One of the contestants heard of El
mer's challenge, and he lost little time in
hunting up the "woodchopper" who was
so rash and daring as to defy the winner
of 'the event of the evening.'
"Elmer was found, after a hot ohase by I
the town bully, and asked if he meant j
i what he had said concerning that chal- j
lenge to the winner of the mill.
" 'Why, certainly, old chap. I am look-
Ing for a scrap, and I just thought I :
would take on the best in the town, as â 
! there is more money in whipping a good
man than a bad one. See?' was the Thes
pian's cool rejoinder.
"The bucolic puncher of human faces
was thunderstruck at Elmer's coolness
and audacity; but on 'sizing' up the in
vader, the challenge was accepted, after
which it was agreed that a substantial
forfeit must be posted at a certain hour
that evening to bind the match.
"Affairs pugilistic went along ewim
i mlngly until some person who had seen
Elmer perform in this city 'let the cat
: out of the bag' by informing the Thes
j plan's proposed opponent that he was up
I against a snag.
" 'I know this alleged woodchopper by
his flowing locks,' was the remark of the j
informer to the town bully. 'I saw him
fight in San Francisco, and he would have
whipped his man sure had it not been for
his lung hair, which kept falling over his
eves, thus blinding his vision.'
"The dis< overy was sufficient to sat
isfy the champion slogger of Swanger that
he was 'up against it,' and Elmer lost
what gave premise of being a good gam
bling proposition by an unfortunate over-
Bight, which lust to him a nice pot of
i apple-butter money.
"]>oubtless he has by this time con
signed a large wad of hirsute covering to
i the winds."
The Jefferson Athletic Club will give
its second entertainment this evening in
its hall, corner of Grove and I.aguna
1 streets. The event of greatest importance
will be an eight-round contest between
Billy Otts and Jack Ennls.
The Alpine Athletic Club has announced
: that it will give a purely amateur athletic
: exhibition at 28 Golden Gate avenue on
! Tuesday, June 14. The features of the
I entertainment will be an eight-round bout
between Pat Lynch of the Excelsior Club
i and Young Peter Jackson of the Alpine
â  Club, and a six-round contest between
jD. A. Carroll and E. Dahl, alias the
â¢ Butcher Boy. . ,
The National Athletic Club has not as
yet announced the preliminary bouts that
will precede the McConnell and McKeever
twenty-round contest.

elected to the position of treasurer, and
Al Bollni was elected grand marshal.
A motion was made by T. E. Tracy to
Increase the original $3000 appropriation
made by the Board of Supervisors by tax
ing each member of the entire committee
$5. It was announced that the fund ap
propriated was not sufficiently large to
warrant a fitting demonstration. He
maintained that at least $20,000 should be
placed at the disposal of the Fourth of
July c6mmittee to be used in lavish deco
rations and superb pyrotechnic displays,
the money to be secured to meet the
necessary expense from the business men
of the city. After considerable wrang
ling and discussion in the attempt to
carry the motion, it was referred to the
executive committee with full power to
act.
Far-Away Liberia.
Last night saw the opening of a course
of lectures in the Academy of Sciences
Hall, which promise to be of more than
passing Interest. George K. French, F.
R. G. S., opened his series of three lec
tures on Liberia, that, to the white man,
almost uninhabitable land on the west
coast of Africa, which was the scene of
the first efforts to solve the negro prob
lem, before the proclamation of emanci
pation was thought of. The lecture last
night touched mainly on the famous col
onization schemes which have since
passed down into history. Next Monday
night Professor French will give his time
more particularly to a description of the
colonies and the present condition of the
colonists. The lectures are illustrated by
stereopticon views, which make them
more (Btgrestjng and impressive.

tion. "Yes," was his reply, "very few people realize the exacting labor such ft
. position entails. A clear head is absolutely necessary and the least illness of tea
seriously affects the correct ; performance of my work. For instance, I. at one time
suffered from a stomach trouble brought on, I suppose, by eating cold lunches hastily,
as is necessary with me, and I finally felt that the trouble would break me up. YoÂ«
know a disordered stomach is invariably the root of any head trouble and of all
things a stenographer's head must be dear. I 6nally found an effective remedy in
RIPANS TABULES which I saw advertised in our paper. They are magical in their
effects, and, by the way, did you ever see anything of the sort put up in such superb
shape ? I have found that they seem to rectify nearly every ill, for several of my friends
have taken my prescription of a Tabule now and then with results for which they hare
heartily thanked me. The dull, heavy headaches I sometimes had are all gone now.
If I take dictation from a man who annoys me and makes me nervous I always take ft
Tabule at the time, and if his breath is not sweet I give one to him."

SAM YUP
BENEVOLENT SOCIETY,
825 Dupont Street,
San Francisco, June 6, 1898.
Dr. G. F. Hansen, 20 Claus
Spreckels Building â
Dear Sir: Inclosed please
herewith find our check for
$112 25, the sum being the
donation from the merchants
of our society to the Red Cross
Society. Trusting you will
receive the same in good or
der, we are, yours respect
fully,
PRESIDENT OW TIN KEE,
VICE-PRESIDENT HO SAY,
DIRECTOR JUM SHO.
That the Chinese residents of this city
are alive to the grand work being done
by the Red Cross Society was evidenced
yesterday when the above letter and the
sum mentioned was brought to the rooms
of the organization In the Claus Spreck
els building.
The representative of the Sam Yups
blandly told the ladies In charge that
each of the subscribing members of his
society would esteem It an honor if they
were permitted to wear the little badge
that reposes on the breast of the many
thousand members of the organization.
Just as soon as the belated consignment
of the precious emblems arrives they will
be forwarded to the Chinese.
The latter are not the only ones who
are anxiously awaiting the coming of the
badges. From morn till night the three
patient ladies greet every visitor to head
quarters with the oft-repeated reply that
the "buttons have not materialized."
Twenty-five additional boxes of golden
fruit were forwarded to the society yes
terday by the Los Angeles Chamber of
A branch organization was formed at
Danville, Contra Costa County, a few
days ago, with an enrolled membership
of seventy members. Mrs. J. E. Close la
president and Mrs. J. A. Sherey Is secre
tary. Their first donation consisted of
eighty-six bandages, sixty caps and forty
comfort bags.
Of the many delightful entertainments
given In aid of the Red Cross none has
surpassed in lavlshness the musical fete
given by Mrs. Eleanor Martin on the 28th
of May. The lady not only placed her
entire and elegant home at the disposal of
the Red Cross, but generously provided
elaborate refreshments for the thousand
guests who were entertained.
Besides bestowing flowers and dainties
on the boys In blue, that lately passed
through their city, the girls of Sacra
mento gave each soldier a sisterly kiss
to speed him on his way to the front.
Milton Andreas, on learning that the
Washington boys encamped in Fontana's
warehouse were receiving medicine in tin
cups, thoughtfully sent them twelve dozen
smail viais.
Within a short time the reports of the
various comittees of the local society will
be read at an open meeting, so that mem
bers can learn what Is being done by the
society. This was decided at a meeting of
the executive committee yesterday.
One hundred and fourteen surgical
bandages were sent to 18 Post street by
the matron of the Protestant Orphan Asy
lum and her assistants.
A large case of "Xaglee" brandy was
received from Naglee Hurke. It will be
used In the hospital for medicinal pur
poses.
Citizens of Gilroy expressed a large case
of caps, bandages and other useful arti
cles yesterday, with a "godspeed the
boys" note.
Three hundred caps and bandages were
sent by the Native Daughters' Red Cross
aid.
The thanks of the busy workers at 16
Post street is expressed to the Qulros
Sodawater Company for the generous
daily supply of liquid refreshment.
Mrs. Charles Fair sent two large dona
tions of bandages and other necessaries.

BIKERS AGAINST PEDESTRIANS
A Reciprocity Regulation ; Expected
by the Park Commissioners.
The Park Commissioners will | meet this
afternoon and ; transact some business of
much interest to pedestrian frequenters of
the park and the . bicycle i riders. It is
expected that an order will be issued
making it a misdemeanor for bicyclists to
ride on paths set â¢ aside for, pedestrians.
The pedestrians will also be restricted. It
will be a misdemeanor after the; present
session of the â  Park Commissioners ' for
a pedestrian to wander on a bicycle path.
The plans and specifications for the con
struction of ' a bridle - path will â be con
sidered. T
WILL START
FOR MANILA
Monterey and Brutus to
Sail This Morning.
EVERYTHING IS IN READINESS.
MONADNOCK AND WITGIFT TO
GET AWAY NEXT.
Engineers, Boiler-Makers, Ship Car
penters and Calkers Working
Night and Day to Get the
Centennial Fixed Up.
The Monterey and her convoy, the
steamer Brutus, will not sail for Honolulu
until this morning. As soon as the Brutus
was repaired the coast defense steamer
met with an accident that necessitated a
delay. The coil in the distiller began to
leak, and it had to be repaired. It waÂ»
sent to the Union Iron Works, and was
returned last night. The two vessels will
therefore, get away this morning with the
first tide. As the Monterey is going to the
tropics, it was essential that the appa
ratus for distilling water should be in
first-class order, and, therefore, the coils
of the distiller were sent to the Union
Iron Works for an overhauling.
Uncle Sam is going to make the best of
a bad bargain, so gangs of engineers,
boiler-makers, calkers and ship-carpen
ters are at work on the old steamer Cen
tennial, trying to make a new vessel out
of her. Considering the age of the
steamer, the hull is in good condition, but
repairs and alterations will have to be
made in nearly every department before
she can be used as a troopship.
The United States Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers went over the vessel yester
day, and it will depend upon their report
as to whether a new boiler will be put in
or a few more patches on the old one. "I
never saw a boiler like the one in the
Centennial," said a boiler-maker yester
day. "There are so many patches on It
lhat it takes an expert to find the original
structure. There are patches upon
patches, and braces here and there to
hold the affair together. Altogether, those
boilers are fearfully and wonderfully
made, and are a credit to the men who
have made them hold out so long."
In the engine-room a gang of men is at
work overhauling the machinery, and in
the steerage the carpenters are altering
the accommodations put in on the sound
for the troops. Many of the compart
ments have been torn down, and good,
comfortable quarters will be put in. The
calkers are hard at work getting the
decks in order, and the crew is tr>ing to
make the old craft look shipshape. Ail in
all the Centennial is the poorest excuse
for a troopship that has yet been palmed
chase along with the Ning Chow bj the
United States Government, was told Â«
eh", xtlv in Sunday s Call, wnt to the
navy yard yesterday where the Mars ar.d
stripes will be raised to-day and Ihe ves
sel re-namwl. The launch \mv aas em
ployed nearly all yesterday morning tak-
W the stores and supplies out of the
vessel and landing them at \ al'.ejo-street
wharf The goods will be put Â»n a bond-
e 1 warehouse and sold to the highest
bidder by the agents of the steamer. All
the wood work Is to be removed from the
Witgift and she will be fitted out in the
same manner as the Brutus. As soon
as the alterations have b. en made she
will convoy the Monadnock to Honolulu
and then tow her to Alauila. She will
take down about 2000 tons of coal and a
few hundred soldiers. She is a rtne
roomy vessel, almost new, and splendid
quarters in the 'tween decks can be put
up for the men.
The accommodations for the men tnat
will go to Manila on the China have been
renuceled and now the cracii ocean liner
will bo as well fitted out as the Colon.
No one gets a separate berth, but r.ow
there are only two In a row, and each
man can get in and out without distJib
ing Up neighbor. A passage way is urÂ» -
vided between each tier of hunks, so there
will be no more climbing over each other
in Older to get to bed.
The China will not get into the stream
toci.y, as all her coal is not aboard and
the men's quarters are not completed.
Yesterday the carpenters had to be laid
on* because of the fifty Chinese pasÃen
gers who are still aboard. The latter have
beÂ«j refused a landing by the Collector of
the Port, and the Mail Company has no
placi to put them until the lÂ»t Igic arrives
at the wharf. As soon .\s she docks the
Mongols will be put on her Â«md the work
of putting in the bunks will be com
pleted. The Colon is all ready for her
stores, but the Government has not be
gun to s<-nd them down yet, so she will
probably keep the China company at the
Mail Company's wharf until to-morrow.
AH the work on the Zealandla was fin
ished last night, and. according to pnni
isrt Captain Howard has the vessel ready
fo." her final Inspection to-day. Nearly
ail the stores are stowed away, and as
soon a-< the soldiers are aboard the Zea
landla will be ready to sail.
The Valencia, the Pacific Steam Whal
ing Company's now passenger steamer, is
expected in from Puget Sound to-mo nvw.
and or her arrival she will be inspected
by the Government authorities. She is a
firs: -class vessel and the cha.ic?s are <.l.Â»t
sine will be one of the troop ships ihat
will follow the China, Zealan-Ila arid

DOGMATISM AGAINST TRUTH
DR. ERNEST S. PILLSBURY Can No Longer Be a Member
of the Cooper Medical Faculty.
DR. ERNEST S, PILLSBURY, Who Was Forced to Leave Cooper Med
ical College.
In this late nineteenth centuryâ supposed to be synonymous with progress,
enlightenment and mental advancement â now and then there ekes out of the new
strata the elements of the old narrowness of mind and all that which helped
to check the growth of truth.
<>n Sunday la-Â«t The Call printed a full page story on a new discovery in
bacteriology. Dr. Ernest S. Pillsbury, instructor in bacteriology at the Cooper
Me.lical College, by the utmost labor and painstaking study finally discovered
the alkaloid of the bacilli tuberculosis. This in itself, in the science of bacteri
ology, is the most important of all late advancements made in this subject. Yes
terday Dr. Pillsbury was asked to take his name off the role of the Cooper
Medical College faculty by Dr. Lane, the president of the institution.
X" Mther cause for the demand of his resignation can be conceived of by Dr.
Pillsbury than the publication of the article in The Call on Sunday last. The
Cooper Medical College has clung tenaciously to the oxytuberculine remedy of
Dr. Hirsehf elder, and no support was ever lacking for the promulgation of his
doctrines. Now comes a contrary theory, and one which Dr. Pillsbury claims
has the better authority and reason to stand on. It is the antidote theory op
: to the germicide theory. In the past the bacilli tuberculosis filled the minds
of all the students of consumption and its effects to the exclusion of all investl
gation concerning the peculiar poison that the bacilli produced. According to Dr.
Piilsbury he has isolated the alkaloid, one of the poisonous elements that the
bacilli tuberculosis create. All remedies for the dread consumption must seek
'interact this poison. Then may an effective cure for consumption be at
tained.
The Cooper Medical College stands for the germicide theory. Dr. Pillsbury
represents the antidote theory and a demand for his resignation is the conse
quence. Some think the Cooper Medical College is bound up so tightly in the
fetters of oxytuberculine that it must stand on this platform if the earth fall.

AWFUL SKKEASE
Suffered Untold Agony Two Years.
Itching and Burning Terrible.
Had to Give up Work Entirely.
Instant Relief in First Application
OF CUTICURA REMEDIES.
At Work, Fully Cured in 2 Months.
I was afflicted with a terrible malignant break-
ing out oil over the upp<>r part of my body. I
was treated by some of the very best physicians,
who proDounced it contagious blood poison,
through whom I spent hundreds of dollars trying
to get relief, Imfit seemed to get worse. All the
time I was suffering untold agony, and finally
had to give up work entirely. I grasped at every.
thing I saw advertised, and listened to every sug-
gestion from friends, but nothing seemed to reach
my ease. The burning, itching nx I was in seemed
to be aggravated by every effort to relieve myself ;
bat, think (rod, relief came to meat last. Gi'Ti-
mp.a RKiiEDiKS were suggested to me, and I
immediately procured the C't'TicuÃA (olutmetit).
Cr^Tictnu Soap, and Cutictba Resolvent.
Protu the first, I experienced a soothing relief,
notwithstanding my intense pain. The warm
tiath, with OOTtcUKA Soap, the anointing with
Cltictra, and the dose of Cuticura Resol-
vent, seomed to start the good work from the
first. I improved right along, and in lett than
two monf/u: /was able to be up and at work,
and continued to improve daily till at last I teat
fijirriy curxMf, sound and well, ndt a sign on my
1,,'1y 11 vi/tcher' indicating that anything had ever

years since I have been entirely cured, and not a

Interesting and Instructive Meetings
Held by Various Denomina
tional Pastors in This City
Yesterday.
Dr. J. W. Phelps of the California Street
Methodist Episcopal Church created some
warm discussion at the regular weekly
meeting of the Methodist ministers yester
day by reading a cleverly written paper
on "Amusements." His brother ministers
were astounded at the trend of the paper,
and were open in their expression of dis
approval, until he explained that the
i thoughts he had read were those of a
I friend, which he had put together with a
| view to ascertaining the views of his fel
low ministers on the subject.
The reader declined to give the paper
for publication, but in substance it was
as follows: "An amusement should not
be considered an evil because it amuses.
The mere fact that it is entertaining does
not make it wrong, and to prove this we
I must remember that the first year of life
i is given over to amusements."
| Dr. John Coyle said he was opposed to
j theaters owing to their surroundings.
j That if Hamlet could be placed on the
I stage with moral accompaniments, the
i public would be benefited. He then told
; how Booth tried to elevate the stage, and
; of his failure owing to the "Black Crook"
j being put on to big houses at the time
he was appearing in legitimate plays.
The question was asked how long a
I minister who went to theaters would be
| retained in his pulpit, and the answer was
quickly made "as long as Burrows had
been." The speaker telt â¢ some compas
. sion for Burrows, as he was insane. He
I denounced dancing in parlors, as it led
I to dancing on the outside, also card play
ing, as one familiar with the pastime
might be tempted to take a hand in a
; game while traveling.
Dr. Robt. Bentley was opposed to dances,
as he said they are generally held on Sat
! urday night, and are kept up until far
! into 'he Sabbath. He deplored the prac*
, tice of Christian parents taking their chil
; dren to baseball games and bicycling
races on Sunday and he denounced danc
ing again as a danger to the church.
Dr. Matthews said: "While the individ
ual conscience is supreme, it must be re
garded by the best and wisest, that the
church is against such amusements and
diversions 1 believe it is reported or
hinted at at v a large proportion of the
Christians of this city and vicinity patron
ize the , dance, and that it eats out the
; spiritual life of the church It is time
that the Christian .pulpits should be
aroused against the evils." Dr. Matthews
considered the country dance a curse and
frSf lX Xrch 0 tUr " >' eP<>Â°Pleaway
thSterp^p^to^t ET/SSl.^to
give $1000 to the brother who read the
paper and that dance halls should have
a million copies struck off and circulated
: as it excellently served their cause.
Mrs. Captain Sarah Fry of the Salvation
Army addressed the Methodist ministers
on the demoralizing effect of the camp life
â  here on the ( young girls, and suggested
that something be done immediately to
; remedy the evil. The following committee
was appointed to look into the matter-
Dr. E. R. Dille (chairman). Dr. F. D
Bovard, Dr. Hammond, Dr. C. E. Locke
and Dr. J. A. B. Wilson.
H. J. Waters of Oakland read a paper
before the Baptists on "Systematic Giv
ing." and Rev. E. A. Woods, D.D., who
went from here as a delegate to the an
nual Baptist convention held in Rochester, \
reported that the next convention would j
be held in this city next May. Among the |
societies represented will be the Baptist !
Missionary Union, Home Missionary
Society, Publication Society, Educational
Society and the Woman's. Baptist Home j
Missionary Society.
The Presbyterian ministers resolved |
themselves into a devotional meeting, and
prayers for the nation were offered.
Miss Mindoj v Berry and Mrs. Captain
Fry addresseaithe Congregational minis
ters during their session. Mrs. Berry
spoke on behalf of the Christian Endeav
orers, and asked that the aid and influ
ence of her listeners might be brought to
bear upon the volunteers in camp. She
said many of the boys in blue now en- |
camped at Richmond are members of the j
society.
â¢ Mrs. Fry notified the ministers that the j
Salvation Army had erected a tent in the
Pennsylvania division, and asked their aid
in carrying on meetings nightly.
Rev. W. H. Atkinson read a paper on j
"Congregational Church Benevolences,"
and Mrs. A. J. Jordan spoke on the or
ganization of a mothers' association to
chaperone young girl members of the j
Christian Endeavor Society to the camp.
Mrs. Wright, president of the Mothers
Club, also spoke, and their remarks
brought forth quite a discussion.
HALF A BATTLE WON
BY UNION MEN
JOY REIGNS IN THE CAMP OF
THE MARBLE-CUTTERS.
A Contract for Interior Marble Work
on the Wells-Fargo Building
Will Stay Here.
In their fight for the preservation of
home industry, the members of the Mar
ble Cutters' Union have half won an
other victory-
The contract for the Interior marble
work in the new Wells-Fargo building
was let to a firm in the Bast employing
convict labor, while local mechanics were
walking the streets in search of an odd
day's work. This union has won fights
on many of the large buildings construct
ed within the past year, and unhesitat
ingly took the matter of the Wells-Fargo
contract in hand.
The union at first was unable to do
anything; the contracts had been let, and
that seemed to be the end of It. but a
joint committee from the union and the
Kulldlng Trades Council started in at
once to see what could be done toward
remedying the evil.
At last night's meeting of the union it
was reported that the contract for the
Soon .'md wainscoting had been taken
fn,m the Eastern firm and let to a local
one. The news was all the more welcome
as the local firm in question en.ioys the
reputation of employing none but union
workmen, and pays the highest wages on
the coast.
It is not considered a very difficult mat
ter to keep a contract within the State,
but after it has once been let, there is
practically but one chance in a thousand
of having it annulled and given to local
workmen, so the victory is considered a
great one. although it is but for a por
tion of the work.

BLOODLESS
DUEL ON
POST STREET
Four Shots Exchanged
at Short Range.
A WOMAN IN THE CASE.
J. J. SEHL OF SEATTLE AS THE
AVENGING HUSBAND.
Charles Hammersmith Charged With
Being the Destroyer of
a Once Happy
Home.
A bloodless duel wao fought in the
lodging house at 242 Post street yesterday
between John Joseph Sehl, the husband
of the landlady, and Charles Hammer
smith, a brother of the senior member of
the firm of Hammersmith & Field, the
jewelers.
Sehl is a furniture dealer in Seattle and
Vancouver, and he and his wife have been
living apart for about a year. He has
been jealous of Hammersmith's atten
tions to his wife, and while Hammersmith
was in the house yesterday shortly after
the noon hour waiting for R. H. Winston,
real estate agent, to negotiate for Mra.
Sehl the sale of the house, Sehl made his
appearance. He first went into his wife's
bedroom, she being confined to her bed,
and asked her where he could find Ham
mersmith. She did not reply, and Sehl,
on leaving her room, saw Hammersmith
standing at the bay-window of the front
room.
Sehl pulled a revolver out of his pocket
and some one yelled "Look out, Charley."
Just then Sehl fired, the bullet missing
Hammersmith and lodging in the frame
work of the window. Hammersmith
promptly fired a shot at Sehl, and four
shots were altogether exchanged, none
taking effect. Sehl then turned and left
the house and Hammersmith slipped out
of the rear door.
The report first reached police head
quarters that a man had committed sui
cide at 240 Post street, and Detectives
Egan and T. B. Gibson were detailed on
the case. Sergeant Harper had mean
time learned the facts of the shooting
and saw Mrs. Sehl. When Egan and Gib
son arrived they found Sehl, who had re
turned to surrender himself. He was
taken to the City Prison and locked up in
the tanks. The detectives went in search
of Hammersmith and found him about 4
o'clock. Both were charged at the prison
with assault with a deadly weapon.
Sehl positively refused to talk, but to
the detectives he blamed Hammersmith
for breaking up his home and with being
on too intimate terms with his wife. He
said he arrived from Seattle yesterday
morning, but his wife said he had been
hanging around the house since Saturday.
When searched at the prison he had $210
in cash, a gold watch and chain, diamond
ring and a bank draft for $1750 on him.
Hammersmith said he simply acted in
self-defense. He had known Mrs. Sehl
for some time, and it was through him
she bought the Post street house. He
was in the house yesterday to help her in
negotiating the sale of the house when
Sehl fired at him. He denied that Sehl
had any cause for jealousy so far as he
or anyone else was concerned.
It was reported that Sehl had employed
a private detective to watch his wife and
the detective hired a room in the house.
It was the detective's report that brought
Sehl to the city.
Mrs. Sehl was . very reticent, and
claimed to know nothing whatever of the
cause of the shooting. "I have been con
fined to my bed for the past week with
neuralgia of the heart and nervous pros
tration," she said. "My husband has
been up north for a year, conducting a
business in Vancouver, which, I believe,
has been prosperous. I have been trying
to dispose of my lease on this house
through R. H. Winston, a real estate
agent, and Mr. Hammersmith has been
acting for me. He had an appointment
to meet Winston and the lady who thinks
of buying out the place this morning. J
While Hammersmith was waiting in the
parlor my husband came in and com- '
menced firing at him. Hammersmith in
turn drew a revolver and exchanged
shots with my husband. I heard the
noise and ran out into the hall to stop
the fracas, and as I did so the police
rushed upstairs. So far as I know there
was no quarreling between the men. and
1 don't know why my husband tried to >
kill Mr. Hammersmith, who has simply
been an acquaintance of mine. He only
came back from Vancouver Saturday, but
I suppose that some malicious person has
been telling him stories."
Winston Knows very little about the
case, he having arrived just after the
shooting was over. He corroborates Mrs.
Behl's story that Hammersmith was her
agent in the negotiations for the sale of j
the property. lie says, however, that
Sehl accuses Hammersmith of having ,
broken up his home.
Both men were released last night,
Schel on cash hail and Hammersmith on
bonds accepted by Judge Low.

THE CALL CAME AS HE WISHED.
Sudden Death of John F. Thrum, the Founder of "Music and Drama."
Genial John F. Thrum, founder of the "San Francisco Music and Drama,"
beloved of the Thespians, is dead.
His end was as he had wished and expected â suddenly as by a lightning
stroke, without the protracted agony of the bedridden, or the torture of the
tears of the loving and the excruciating pangs of the last parting. Charles
Turnbould of 829 Greenwich street found at half-past 4 o'clock yesterday
morning the dead body of a man lying on the sidewalk on the corner of Taylor
street and Broadway. He notified Policemen Stanton and Long, who had the
body conveyed to the Morgue, in which building is also the office of the paper
with which Thrum was connected. As the deceased had been suffering for years
from heart disease, there was no doubt that his death was from natural causes,
and the Morgue officials allowed the remains to be removed to the undertaking
establishment of Porter & White.
Mr. Thrum was a thorough Bohemian, and was beloved by everyone with
whom he came in contact. His was that genial nature which was slow to see
the faults of his friends and as quick to discover their merits. His criticisms,
while just, were never harsh, and he never forgot that it is human to err, and
that it is better to say a kind word here and there where blame Is deserved
than to be too censorious, for of all men he thoroughly understood the difficul
ties which beset the path of the actor.
Mr. Thrum was born in Australia fifty-eight years ago, and early displayed
a taste for a life on the deep rolling sea. So he went upon the heaving brine
and braved the icy terrors of the Arctic, hunting the whale. He sailed from
Australia, New Bedford. Honolulu and San Francisco on these voyages, and
when the solitude and the somberness of the sea palled upon him he learned
the printer's trade, he having conceived an exaggerated idea of the value of
education. All old printers remember his early days here, when he worked as a
compositor on the old Alta California in this city.
Sixteen years ago he discovered a phase of the long-felt want and founded
the San Francisco Music and Drama, He sold out last February to Harry-
Gates, the present proprietor of that successful publication, but consented to
help it along as its business manager, a post which he filled to the satisfaction
of all concerned.
The deceased leaves a widow and one son, Horace G. Thrum, a well-known
comedian, at present with the Dixie company at Manhattan Beach. Mrs. Cap
tain Hamilton of Campbells, Santa Clara County, is a sister of the deceased.
THERE WILL
BE MANY
VACANCIES
Trouble Ahead for the
Reformers.
DEMOCRATS IN A TANGLE
CALL FOR A MEETING OF THE
NEW COMMITTEE.
Harneyites Say Their Rights Have
Been Trampled Upon and That
They Will Appeal to
the Courts.
Twenty-five members of the new Demo
cratic City and Cour L y Committee have
signed a call for a meeting of the com
mittee to be held in Native Sons' Hall
next Friday evening, a course made
necessary by the developments of the
past week, which threaten to wreck the
hand-made governing body of the local
Democracy.
When Messrs. Gould, McNab and Al
ford were scouring the city in search of
untarnished material for the committee,
they neglected in many instances to se
cure the consent of the owners of many
of the names that were presented to the
State Central Committee for confirma
tion. The result -as been that some of
the gentlemen who have been herded into
the reform nock without their knowledge
or consent have declared their unwilling
ness to serve in the harness that has been
prepared for them. This fact taken in
connection with the following section of
the rules made and provided in advance
for the government of the new committee
is what has led to the hurried call for the
meeting next Friday night:
Section 12â Any vacancy occurrimj in the
membership of the Democratic City and County
Committee shall be filled by such committee,
subject to confirmation by the Democratic
State Committee. .
As the State Central Committee will
meet next Saturday, it was deemed ad
visable for the local commute to fill the
numerous vacancies before that date in
order that they may be confirmed at once.
Otherwise it would be necessary to wait
until the next meeting of the State Com
mittee, a proceeding especially hazardous
at the present moment when the Harney
ltes and others are in open reoeliion
against the rule of the back-country re
formers.
There is some speculation as to where
the men who are particularly interested
in the work that is to be done by the
aristocratic City and County Committee
are going to look for material with which
to fill the gaps caused by the resignation
of reluctant members. Having exhausted
the stock of available aristocrats and so
called political high joints, recourse will
necessarily be hart to the "push. " While
it is not contended that there will be any
lack of members of the latter fraternity
who are ready, even anxious, to take
orders from the trio of new-found bosses,
there is a very grave doubt In the minds
of some as to how these unwashed com
mitteemen will be received by Mayor
Phelan. The Mayor, according to popular
report, has but recently declared his de
termination to shake the dust of the dis
trict south of Market street from his feet
at once and forever, and to confine his
future political exertions to the other
side of town, where worklngmen are the
exception ana not the rule. Tf this be so,
It may be possible that he will set the
seal of his disapproval on the plan to in
iect members of the "Duah" into the ex
clusive circles of the new governing body
of the local Democracy. This is but one
of the uncertainties that are confronting
the committee's sponsors, and it is held
as an added reason why a meeting should
be called before Saturday in order to al
low the State Central Committee an op
portunity to straighten out any tangle
that muy be beyond the strength of local
minds.
A member of the new City and County
Committee said yesterday that he had no
doubt, judging by past events, of the
ability of the State committee to solve
any question brought before it.
"Just give those country members half
a show," he concluded, "and they will
come here from Siskiyou and San Diego
and cast our votes for us. It is no trou
ble fur them, and they rather like it."
The ostensible purpose of Friday night's
meeting is to perfect permanent organiza
tion and to discuss in a general way the
manner in which the coming campaign is
to be conducted. John P. Dunn will
probably be elected chairman, and
Thomas Walsh, one of Mayor Phelan's
henchmen, wi.. be given the post of sec
retary.
While the reformers are preparing to
carry out their programme, the deposed
Harneyites are not idle. They believe
that under the law they are entitled to
continue in the administration of the af
fairs of the local Democracy, and that
the State Central Committee has not the
power to interfere with them. Some of
the brightest legal lights in the city have
been consulted as to the construction of
the low, and their verdict is such that an
early appeal to the courts has been de
cided on. The course of the proposed
legal proceedings has not yet been defi
nitely determined, but will probably take
the form of a restraining order or writ
of prohibition against the new City and
County Committee directing it to take
no action affecting the organization of
the Democratic party of San Francisco
until the merits of the present contention
have been passed upon by the courts.
Some objection to this course is being
urgtel by the friends of the two retiring
Associated Justices of the Supreme Court.
As both are candidates for re-election it
is pointed out that it would be embar
rassing to them to be compelled to pass
upon a question that has to do with the
standing of any faction of any political
party. It is not likely, however, that this
objection will have much weight with
those who contend that their rights have
been trampled upon. They pretend to say
that with them it is not a question of
politics but of principle, and that the
mind of a Judge of the Supreme Court
should be beyond and above such influ
ence as the promotion of personal politi
cal ambition.
