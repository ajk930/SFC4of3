VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO 113.
GOVERNOR BUDD SAYS
IT IS A DISGRACE
Denounces the Acts of Mayor Phelan's Demo
cratic Committee of One Hundred
Job Chasers.
The Alleged Convention Declared to Be Injurious to the
Interests of the Party in City and State.
The Legislative Programme.
There was a very warm session of
Judge Maguire's executive committee
yesterday afternoon in the rooms of the
Democratic State Central Committee in
the California Hotel. Governor Budd was
there. So was Mayor Phelan and several
of the lesser lights of the local and State
Democracy.
The heat of the session, which was held
behind closed doors, was due to Governor
Budds strictures on the manner in which
Mayor Phelan. "Whispering" Gavin Mc-
Nab and their select committee of one
hundred job-chasers are conducting the
affairs of the local Democracy.
The Governor denounced the action of
the Committee of One Hundred in resolv
ing Itself Into a nominating convention
as a shame and an outrage and an insult
to the Democratic voters of the City of
Ban Francisco. He further declared that
this action, which he characterized as in
famous, would result in the defeat of the
ticket in this city and would very ma
terially injure the chances of Maguire's
election. Ho said that it would hurt tue
party In the State as well as in San
Francisco, and | should not be counten
anced by honest men. He said much more
to the same effect, and Mayor Phelan,
Charles W. Fay and some others who
had been Instrumental in perfecting the
claims of the Committee of One Hundred
to the lives and liberties of local Demo
crats spent a very uncomfortable half
hour. 1 Incidentally, a very material part
of the programme of the self-constituted
convention was brought to light.
The | executive J committee met osten
sibly for the purpose of considering the
appeal made by Francis J. Heney from
the decision of the Committee of One
Hundred to resolve itself into a nominat
ing convention. The real purpose of the
meeting, however, was to devise some
echeme whereby Mr. Honey's protest
could be sidetracked and the voters of
the party be appeased and made to be-
Jieve that the members of the Commit
tee of One Hundred' are honorable men
Whose solo purpose in life is to promote
the welfare of the San Francisco Democ
â raer.~> r "Trw&s-rwnneraiscussing- the best
plan for putting Mr. Hene- and his ap
peal on the shelf that Governor Budd
gave vent to his disapproval of the high
handed methods that have up to the pres
ent time marked the proceedings of the
Committee of One Hundred.
Mayor Phrlan rushed to the defense of
his lieutenants, but even he could not
find it In his heart to wholly approve of
their action. He said that it was his
opinion that the Committee of One Hun
dred had not acted with "wise discretion"
In constituting Itself a nominating con
vention, but that the deed was now done
and it was the duty of every good Demo
crat to make the best Â«f it. He even
went so far as to declare that he was
surprised to find that the committee had
the power to constitute itself a nominat
ing body.

The Nameless Party.
The so-called People's party or fusion
organization is to have a day, the Su
preme Court having decided to give it
a chance to tell why it should have a
nnme and place in politics. When the
pinto combination applied to Secretary of
State Brown for baptism the State offi
cial refused to grant the favor, not be
ing satisfied with the paternity of the
applicant. Although realizing that it was
of very questionable origin the thought
of going through life nameless was too
rauch, and an application was made to
The San Francisco Call
It w*s at this point that Governor
Budd declared his conviction that the ac
tion of the committee of l>/0 and its sub
ordinates was an outrage and would work
an immediate and lasting Injury to the
party in city and State. xne Governor
had something else to say. He asked
Mr. Fay for some Information as to the
plan that had been adopted by the man
agers relative to the selection of legisla
tive nominees.
Fay replied that the plan was to au
thorize Chairman McGee to select a mem
ber of the convention from each Assem
bly District, such members, so selected
being authorized uf name the legislative
nominee from the district In which he
lived. It was apparent that this plan put
into the hands of Chairman McGee or
the men who controlled his acts the pow
er to name the whole Democratic legis
lative ticket. It was on this point the
Governor had a few words to say. He
declared that Chairman McGee has only
be*n a resident of San Francisco for a
period of seven months and has never
voted here; that the proposition to place
such a power in the hands of such a man
was simply suicidal if it was considered
as a bona fide act.
He declared that If McGee was given
this power without any strings to it that
he (McGee), not having a knowledge of
the needs of the city or of the qualifica
tions of the many aspirations for Legis
lative nominations, could not fulfill his
trust. If on the other hand McGee was
but the Instrument in the hands of the
men who dominated the convention the
condition was equally as bad, but for a
different reason.
"This man McGeee," said the Governor,
"is my personal and political enemy, and
is known to be such. It is also a matter
of common belief that I am a candidate
for election to the United States Senate.
Knowing these things you have put into
the hands of this man the power to vir
tually appoint Legislative nominees who
are prejudicial to my candidacy. I want
to state here and now that I am not and
will not bf a camildaA* for Â«MÂ«Â»ction to the
United States Senate â and there are no
strings on that declartlon like there
are on a declaration recently made by M.
H. de Toung.
"That, however, does not chnnge the
fact about what you propose to do. I
do not believe that the Democrats of San
Francisco will stand Â»uch a high-handed
proceeding as this, and I for one will not
blame them."
The Governor's criticism was not very
palatable to the Mayor and his friends,
but this fact did not deter the Governor
from giving vent to his feelings on the
subject. The net result of the meeting
was that Mr. Heney's protest and ap
peal were quietly placed on the shelf.
A meeting of the State Central Commit
tee will be called for some time during
the present month.
the Supreme Court for so much of re
spectability as goes with a name. Chief
Justice Beatty yesterday took compassion
upon the nameless one and directed that
an alternate writ of mandate issue re
turnable on Monday, the 26th inst., at
2 o^clock, when the matter will be argued
before the Justices sitting in bank.

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1-898.
MAYOR PHELAN IS
RENOMINATED BY
THE PROGRAMMERS
Democrats Fear Disruption, and After
Naming Four Judges Adjourn
Their Convention.
There is dissension among the members
of the Democratic committee of one
hundred now acting as a nominating
convention for the Democratic party of
San Francisco.
The initial .Session of the convention wag
held Monday evening, and last evening
another session was held at which busi
ness was transacted down to the point
where trouble threatens. When this
point was reached. Master of Ceremo
nies Charles W. Fay, who enjoys the rep
utation of being the mouthpiece of his
Honor, the Mayor, moved that the con
vention adjourn until to-morrow evening.
No one objected and it was so ordered.
Fay and his friends, who have in hand
the task of making up the slate, hope
that between now and Thursday even
ing they will be able to satisfy the de
mands of some of the members of the
convention who object to having two or
three of the nominations go to men who
are members of the committee of one
hundred. On the other hand, the ob
jectors declare that they Intend to have
all the patronage that Is at the disposal of
the convention or they will raise such a
row that Mayor Phelan and Whispering
Gavin McNab wll find that the work of
bossing the Democracy requires more
than the sanction of the trustees named
by the State Central Committee.
The net result of last night's session
of the convention was the renomination
of Mayor James D. Phelan and the nom
ination of four Superior Court Judges.
MEN WHO CAUGHT THE EIE OF THE CONVENTION.
Judge William T. Wallace, Judge James
M. Soawell, Judge Rhodes Borden and
Attorney Frank Morasky were the fortu
nate candidates for the Superior Bench
nomination. United States District At
torney Bert Schlosingcr and F. V. Cos
tcllo were the unsuccessful candidates.
As on the previous evening there was
a numerous lobby present and it took
such a lively interest in the proceedings
of the convention that at times it re
quired the efforts of several policemen
to keep things in. working order. Mem
bers of the lobby made frequent calls
for the "slate" and "programme," but
aa Chairman McGee declined to respond,
tltfe interested spectators were compelled
to confine their attention to oral criti
cism of members of the convention.
Although the convention was. called for
8 o'clock it was several minutes past 9
o'clock before Chairman McGee rapped
for order. The delay was due to an un
successful effort on the part of the pro
grammers to secure the unquestioning
support for the slate of the disgruntled
Job chasers. The rollcall disclosed the
presence of eighty-eight members of the
committee of one hundred.
The resignation of Edmund Godchaux
was read and accepted, after which the
secretary read a resolution declaring that
all of the labor at the disposal of the
convention and its nominees should be
given to the members of the Allied
Trades Council. The report of the commit
tee on platform was then called for. The
report was read by Joseph N. Nougues
and was accepted by the convention. The
platform, which is printed in full in
these columns, denounced boss rule In
politics, pledges the nominees of the con
vention to carry out all sorts of reforms,
besides approving of the result of the
late war with Spain. This having been
dipposed of Chairman McGee announced
that nominations for Mayor were in or
der.
Dr. R. Beverly Cole had been selected
as the person to place the name of Mayor
Phelan before the convention. He made
a short but a very appropriate address,
in which he eulogized the work done by
Mayor Phelan during his Incumbency as
the city's chief executive.
"I am an old man," he said, "but I am
still young enough to recognize true mer
it. The man whose name I desire to
place before you for your consideration
is one whom you all know and whom you
! respect and honor. Since his elevation to
the highest place in the gift of the peo
ple of this city his name has become a
household word. He is, besides, a native
son. Although a young man he has an
old head, and his acts have always been
such as would conserve the best inter
ests of the people of San Francisco. Since
his incumbency of the office he has been
the watchdog of the treasury (laughter)
and has saved the city untold thousands
of dollars. The man to whom I refer is
James G. Phelan. He asks that his every
act be seen and criticized."
' The mention of Mayor Phelan's name
provoked great applause from floor and
gallery and at the request of Max Pop
per three cheers were given. Jasper N.
McDonald, chairman of the committee of
one hundred, asked the privilege of sec
i onding the nomination of Mr. Phelan. He
! declared that he would make no speech
! and that his only desire was to subscribe
to all that Dr. Cole had said. Dr. Cole
then moved that the nominations be
closed, and on motion of Clitus Barbour
the secretary was instructed to cast the
ballot for Mr. Phelan.
The chair appointed Mr. McDonald and
Colonel Sullivan a committee to find and
escort the Mayor to the convention ball.
His appearance was greeted with an
other season of cheering and handclap
ping, during which he bowed his appre
ciation and smiled v s thanks. He said;
"I thank you sln^ erely for the nomina
tion you have just given me. lam not
unfamiliar with the history of this con
vention (laughter) and I desire to signify
my approval of the action of the gov
erning body of the Democracy of this
State in its effort to take the party In
this city out of the hands of corrupt
bosses.
"You. gentlemen of the convention, rep
resent in its best sense the Democratic
party of San Francisco. No honest man
can say that this convention does not
come from the highest authority of me
party in this State. It was brought into
existence in order that the people of
this city might be relieved of the rule of
corrupt bosses and that they might
have a voice in conducting tne affairs of
the party. The affairs of the party may
be trusted with the people because the
great mass of people is always right.
"Af^er your deliberations have been
concluded I am sure that you will pre
sent to the people of San Francisco a
ticket composed of good and honest men
whose election will insure an honest ad
ministration of the aiiairs of the munici
pality. For these reasons I feel grateful
at receiving at the hands of such a con
vention the nomination which you have
given me.
"I know that the Supervisors and
School Directors who were elected two
years ago have not done their duty, al
though the Democratic party pledged
them to reforms. While this is to be de
plored, It cannot now be helped, and it Is
your business to purge the ticket of the
men who have been false to their pledges
in the past. Ido not desire to engage in
a general condemnation of the men with
whom I have tried to work anu will not
do so at this time.
"You have, I understand, adopted a
good platform which, if carried out, will
rid this city of the abuses that have
marked the conduct of its government.
But the plntform alone will not do the
work. You must name men who are lion
estâmen who have the interest of the city
at heart, and who will have the courage
to carry out the reforms which you have
planned and the pledges which you will
exact. I thank you from the bottom of
n\v heart."
The first number, on the programme hav
ing been carried out without a hitch,
Chairman McGee declared the next busi
ness in ord.er was the naming of four Su
perior Court Judges. Before any nomina
tions could be made, however, Joseph
Notigues moved that each candidate
whose name was presented to the conven
tion be Â» - equested to make a contribution
to the convention of not less than $10, the
same to be paid in at the time the can
didates' name was presented. An excep
tion was made in the case of School Di
rectors. A. Comte Jr., who had been
slated to make several nominations, and
who saw that under this rule he would
be required to produce a very considerable
amount of money, entered a very vigorous
protest. He declared that such action was
a relic of barbarism and that In his opin
ion the members of the convention should
bear the expense of the convention. A
standing vote was called for and the mo
tion was carried by a two-thirds majority.
Barna McKinne took the platform for
the privilege of placing Bert Schleslngerin
nomination and had just begun his ora
tion when he was interrupted by a rude
request for the necessary |10 entrance fee.
Having "produced" he proceeded to
enumerate the virtues of his candidate.
He continued to speak for fifteen or
twenty minutes and concluded without
having named Mr. Schlesinger, an omis
sion of which he was reminded in a very
pointed manner by members of the lobby.
He was followed by A. Comte Jr., who
presented $10 and the name of Frank J.
Murasky to the convention. He declared
that not a member of the convention had
been solicited to vote for Murasky. Some
one in the lobby proposed three cheers
for the candidate and the outsiders had a
little noise-making of their own.
Emll Pohli next took the floor, handed
up a twenty-dollar note, received $10
change, and proposed the name of Judge
James M. Seawell.
The next speaker was W. B. Cope, who
had concealed about his person the. name
of Judge Rhodes Borden and a ten-dollar
note, both of which he produced between
Interruptions from the gallery. Judge E.
A. Brldgeford, having: lirst paid his fine,
presented the name of "a young- man
who possesses all of the Jeffersonian
qualifications." F. V. Costello.
A. Comte Jr. found another ten dollar
piece, and after separating himself from
it was permitted to place Judge William
T. Wallace in nomination. Jerome Deasy
wanted to second the nomination of
Judge Wallace, but cut his speech short
when some one in the lobby shouted
"That fellow owes me rent."
There being no further nominations the
convention proceeded to ballot. It was
observed that Francis J. Heney had re
fused to sit in the convention,, and when
his name was called he arose from his
place In the lobby and declined to vote.
The ballot resulted as follows: Borden
70,~Wallace 65, Seawell t>3, Murasky 03,
Schlesinger 55, Costello 43. Borden, Wal
lace, Seawell and Murasky having re
ceived the highest votes cast were de
clared the nominees of the convention.
This business having been disposed of
Bart Burke of Santa Cruz moved that in
future no nominating speech should ex
ceed five minutes In length. This having
been agreed to the convention was just
settling itself down in anticipation of the
expected row over the other nominations,
when Charles W. Fay bobbed up in his
seat and moved that the convention ad
journ until Thursday evening. No objec
tion was offered and the adjournment
was ordered. It is expected that some
exciting caucuses will be held between
now and the time when Chairman Me-
Gee raps for order to-morrow evening.
MAGUIRE POPULISTS
STILL IN THE FIELD
The Kinne-Gillespie Contingent Decided Last
Night to Hold a Local Nomi
nating Convention.
They Accuse the "Middle-of-the-Roadsters" of Shamelessly
Keeping in Close Communication With Reputed
Railroad Lobbyists.
The Magulre-Gallagher-Glllespie-Klnne
wing of the Populists met last night and
held a little consolation party. The mem
bers are still feeling sore from the
severe fall given them by Secretary of
State Brown, when he decided a few days
ago that the mlddle-of-the-roadsters who
repudiated Maguire and fusion Â«.t Sac
ramento were entitled to the Populist
party designation on the State ticket.
When it was announced by Brown that
he would recognize the ticket headed by
T. W. Shanahan, the "tall sycamore of
Shasta," who Is now designated by his
former bewhiskered brothers as "a bolt
er," the Maguire Populists had all sorts
of chills.
When the warring local factions return
ed from Sacramento and the middle
of-the-roadsters left the old organization
and formed a new county committee, they
held on to the records. Dr. W. N. Gris
wold has been aching for an opportunity
to express himself in "caustic verbiage"
since that time. The opportunity was
afforded him last night and he took ad
vantage of it.
After the . committee was called to or
der by Dr. Miller, and Secretary Clough
reported a quorum present, Dr. Griswold
presented the following "statement of
cold facts":
The majority of I the San Francisco delega
tion -. to the recent Populist State convention
have been several times i publicly, charged . with
having violated the instructions of the county
convention. The charge is again repeated by
Secretary of State Brown in a decision -which
has given him no enviable notoriety. The facts
regarding fusion, according to Populist records,
which show these charges to be . mendacious,
are as follows: . â  â¢ - . .
The national committee met . recently ... at
Omaha and resolved that for the year 1898 the
policy of fusion should left to the discretion
of the States.. .. -; - â¢
The State committee met In October, 1897,
and discoursed as follows: - "Political parties
have an honest existence ,when they represent
and s squarely contend :â  for their -platform de
mands and they can only exist, by supporting
'candidates who favor, accept J and 1 advocate
their I platforms and 'â  by * fearlessly .: - opposing
politically r all who -reject and refuse to Â» accept
their demands."^ ThlÂ» sentiment Is repeated in :
other forms, and the address ends thus:-. -^WÂ«

â This â¢ address ; looks steadily toward fusion or
union on given conditions. . â .. , ' , ','-â¢â ; ...
In April, 1898, . the State committee again met.

STORY OF SUFFERING
AND ILL-TREATMENT
The soldiers who arrived from Hono
lulu yesterday on the Australia, on Mr
lough, tell hard stories of their treat
ment, not only on board the transport
Lakme, but in camp near Honolulu.
Their grievances began with embark
ation. It was originally intended that
only 160 men should be taken, but when
the steamer sailed there were 340 pri
vates and fifteen officers on board. The
results, according to their accounts,
were that aside from lack of sleeping
accommodations they were not half
fed. Those who got nearest the pro-
vender first appropriated it all and the
unfortunate outsiders went hungry.
Complaints were of no avail. On one
occasion a box of crackers was spilled
on the deck and there was a regular
football scrimmage to secure them.
Bread, salt meat and coffee constituted
the bill of fare for six days, and there
after they subsisted on hardtack and
coffee.
Army regulations require 1000 cubic
feet of air space per soldier. On the
Lakme the quarters afforded sixty-five
feet per man, and to make matters
worse the hold was very damp.
Arrived at Honolulu conditions were
as bad or worse, according to- the corn-
plaining soldiers.
"There seems to have been plenty of
food," said W. D. Andrews, "but it was
for some reason not issued, and we
were supplied with less than half ra
tions per day. This state of affairs
continued until the New York Regi
ment and the engineer corps refused
to perform the regulation drill, and one
company was placed under arrest. As
a compromise the drilling time wag re
duced to two hours a day â one in the
morning and one in the evening. Owing
to the heat and scant food this was all
the men could stand.
â¢'The Red Cross Society is doing
splendid work, but the male nurses
appropriate the special food pro
vided for the ( sick and eat it. The con
valescents are required as soon as they
can get out of their cots to wash
dishes, sweep and scrub floors and do
police patrol duty. In the engineer
corps about thirty men men answer to
the 'sick' call every morning and are
sent to the post hospital. Usually they
are returned the next day, whether fit
or not.
"The New York men are in particular
suffering from the heat. They have no
canvas suits, and while drilling must
work with their coat* buttoned, which
causes them much suffering. This reg
iment is preparing a petition to the
President to be mustered out. Their
plaint is that they 'do not want to go
to the Philippines after the treatment
they have received on the transports
and in Honolulu.' "

specified. Be It resolved that .>ur delegates are
Instructed in accordance with the foregoing
resolution, and
First â Against adjournment of the conven
tion.
Secondâ To vote for and favor the nomina
tion by our State convention of a complete
straight Populist State ticket, and against any
proposal to leave places vacant.
Third (In substance)â Any committee filling
vacancies shall cause the substitute candidate
in writing to accept the Populist platform.
The above are the instructions of the County
Convention.
Subsequently, by the vote of the entire State
Convention. Including the bolters, the time
when all candidates should sign the platform
was placed for those In the State at fifteen
days after their nomination and for those out
of the State at fifteen days after their re
turn.
The cold facts are here substantially stated.
Fusion was permitted by the National Com
mittee; conditional I fusion I was - recommended
by the State and county committees and In
structed by the County Convention, and the
State convention unanimously favored It by an
extension of time that facilitated its accom
plishment. -
Under such Instructions for fusion the fur
ther instruction to nominate a straight Popu
list ticket could be complied with only by se
lecting: from th* Democrats and Silver Re
publicans such of their number as were able
and willing to accept the Populist platform. â -
This was done.
The Instructions of the County Convention
were i followed by I the majority of twenty-six
from beginning 1 to end, as literally as any im
perfectly drawn instructions could be ' fol
lowed.
What did the minority of three do? â  . ;
-^Ignored and opposed these instructions from
first to . last, and when overcome by a strong
majority rebelled against the fundamental
law of organization â majority rule â in de
fiance of a State statute which makes ; it a
Telony punishable by fine and imprisonment,
preclpltantly organized what they . termed a
State convention and adopted the same plat
form of principles as that abandoned by them.
In this latter action they were joined 'by
other anarchistic and law-defying members.
On returning to San Francisco this minority
of three. Joined by others of their kind, formed
a new organization, took the books of the regu
lar County Committee from - their accustomed
place of deposit and secreted, â  and against all
demands for their surrender, â¢ retained : them.
Up to the present they have Ehamelessly kept

SLAYS TWO OFFICERS
BEFORE HE IS TAKEN
Murder Done by a Man Who Sought
to Deprive His Father of a
Home.
GARRETT, Pa., Sept. 20.â E. P. My
ers this morning took possession of a
house left to him by his mother, Mrs.
Christley Myers, who died five months
ago. The deed was not signed by his
father, who had a life tenure In the
property. When Christley Myers ar
rived this morning he found the house
barricaded, his son refusing him en
trance. He at once went to Somerset,
swore out a warrant for forcible entry
and detainer, and on his return here
sought service for the writ. Young
Myers fired at the approaching Consta
ble, fatally wounding Michael Kearney.
Theti he fled to his boarding house, im
mediately adjoining, whither Constable
Nelson Lenhart and his brother, John
Lenhart, followed him. He fired again,
killing John Lenhart instantly.
â¢Sheriff Martin Hartzell of Somerset
in a short time arrived with a posse.
A crowd of infuriated citizens was
guarding the boarding house, in the
cellar of which young Myers was hid-
ing.
After an hour's waiting a raid was
made. A dozen shots were exchanged.
Myers was finally overpowered and
while being taken down the steps of the
house was struck by a gun in the
hands of somebody in the crowd. He
was knocked unconscious, but later re
covered and was removed to Somerset.
Michael Kearney died about 10
o'clock. John Lenhart, the other vic
tim, was scarcely recognizable when
found, the entire front of his face hav
ing been blown off.

of the minority of the Board of Education

Taxation.
A tax of $1 on the- $100, baaed on an as
sessed valuation of $3.10,000,000. together with
' other sources of revenue of the city, Is suf
ficient for the proper maintenance of the
city government, economically and wisely
conducted, and we pledge our nominees to
this rate.

* It Is notorious that small property-owners
are assessed for the full value of their
property, while the property of large cor
. Iterations, particularly In the matter of
- the assessments of franchises, are greatly
undervalued, for purposes of taxation. We
pledge our. nominees for Assessor and mem
bers of the Board of Supervisors sitting as
a Board of Equlllz.itlon, to make a thorough
revision of the assessment of the city and
county, to the end that the burdens of gov
. ernment may be equitably distributed; and
ÂWi' further pledge them to follow the spirit
of the rule laid down by the Supreme Court

vs. January, and determine the value of
franchises by deducting tne tangible prop

"Btpc,lc<" Btpc,lc< and bonds. Whereas, the Assessment

ture, -to encourage lin every possible way
â .the municipal ownership of a water sup

â introduction of these great' reforms should
"not be â¢â  undertaken until the new char
ter has clothed our municipal authorities
â¢.-with the necessary power and provided the
proper Instrumentalities and safeguards
for their conduct and administration.
New Charter.
During tho last two years the reform ele
ment at the Democratic party united ivlth
all good citizens In resisting the attempt
made by the allied political bosses of all
parties and the corporations enjoying ex
clusive ' privileges in electing a board of
fifteen freeholders and subsequently In
adopting the charter which that body
drafted. We now, for the consummation of
tUÂ«' patriotic campaign, n-sulting in the
adaption of the charter, call upon the peo
ple of the State to require of their legisla
tive representatives to record and dispute
the voice of the people of this city unmis
takably spoken, and we pledge In our own
behalf our legislative nominees to vote for
the ratification of the charter.
Gas and Electric Light.
We favor the adequate illumination of the
city, Riving light to the suburbs and bril
liancy to the streets, and pledge our nom
inees for Supervisors to give every facility
to corporations supplying light to compete
for the business of the city and of the citi
zens. The Democratic party Is, opposed to
granting special privileges which Inevit
ably result In monopoly, and no long as
light Is supplied by private corporations
there should be nn discrimination in favor
of one as against the other. The rates
charged are notoriously excessive, and we
pledge our nominees to a substantial re
duction based upon the value of their In
vestment, as indicated by reference In this
platform to the water question.
Wt- pledge our nominees for Supervisors
to require, within a district to be deter
mined by thorn, the wires of all corporations
to be laid under ground after reasonable
notice.
Streets and Sewers.
We pledge our nominees for Supervisors
and Superintendent of Streets to improve
the streets, to maintain and keep them
clean when they are Improved, and to pre
pare specifications under which street work
may be done that will not exclude any
meritorious pavement.
We demand that the sanitary condition
of the city be carÂ»fully studied and that
the severs be flushed and otherwise kept
clean. We" recommend the adoption of
some gystetn by which salt water may be
used for, cleansing purposes. We demand
that all, unused rails and tracks and un
necessary turn-tablen artd such other ob
structions ;be J-emovÂ«d from ths streets.
Health.
The preservation of the health of the
people is the first duty of municipal gov
ernment and we commend the efforts of
the Board of Health to destroy tho deadly
traffic In adulterated goods, and we pledge
support to their crusade until our citizens
can have reasonable guarantees that pois
onous and deleterious foods are excluded
from our market.
Torty-Second District Republicans.
The regular Republican Club of the
JfortyriK-Pond District was organized last
night. In B'nai B'rith Hall. The meeting
waa^called to order by Thomas D. Rior

Ginn Jr..; recording secretary, William
H. Almon; financial .secretary, Jajnes
Moef treasurer, William Kessilng; mar-
; P.. McDonough; conference commit
tee, James McCloskey and
Matt O'Brien.
Schools.
We pledge our nominees for members of
the Board of Education to segregate each
year a sufficient Bum for the purpose of
paying salaries of the teachers In full bo
the same shall be paid monthly and to
sacredly set apart such . appropriation for
the purpose for which It Is made. This
done we pledge our nominees for School
Directors to provide ample accommodation
for the pupils of the city, and artistic and
sanitary school houses. We further pledge
our nominees for members of the Board
of Education to elect no teacher during
their term of ' office unless vacancies are
created by death, resignation or otherwise,
because we realize the fact that the staff
of teachers employed, now by the city and
county Is sufficient to meet all possible de
mands upon the schools for the ensuing
year. In the spirit of civil service reform
we pledge our nominees also to promote to
the higher positions In the department only
teachers who have by long and meritorious
service shown their peculiar fitness.
Franchises.
In granting franchises we pledge our
nominees for Mayor and Supervisors to
stipulate conditions for white labor and
California material and the free transpor
tation, while on official duty, of members
of the police, fire and health departments
and postmen in the employ of the Gov
ernment. We further pledge our nominees
to vote /or the renewal of no franchise at
a date earlier than one year before the
expiration of the original' franchise.
Labor.
In all .contracts let by the Board of
Supervisors and other boards and on all
public work we pledge our nominees for
all offices having discretion In such mat
ters tp stipulate for a daily wage of not
less than $2 for eight hours' work. ""
Chinese Labor.
The Chinese question is again pressing
Itself upon this community for solution.
The Government of the United States has
permitted the uniforms of the brave de
fenders of, the flag to be made In Chinese
sweat shops by servile labor. This scan
dalous and distressing fact has called the
attention of the public to the condition of
people of our own race engaged In similar
employments, and It has been made known
by the Labor Commissioner of the State of
California. Mr. E. L. Fitzgerald, that much
of the poverty and distress In this city Is
due to the crowding out of men and women
from employment by Chinese cheap labor.
The Chinese have Invaded the business dis
trict with stores In which they exhibit all
kinds of articles of clothing. The Chinese
employed â In :. the manufacture .dt these
goods. In deadly and disastrous competi
tion with our own people, observe no hours
of labor, have no families to rear and edn- "
cate, have practically no taxes to pay. have
no social or other organizations to support,
and in no manner contribute to the social
well being" of the community In time of
peace or its defense in time of \Â»arÂ» Their
earnings, with their bones, are sent to
China, and the distribution of the wealth
which should secure prosperity for the com
munity is wasted in their hands. They are
not patrons of our merchants, and their
cheap labor, on account of their non-par
ticipation In the ordinary commercial and '
social affairs of life, is a blight to our
community. We pledge our nominees for all
public offices In which the Interests of labor
may be guarded to grant some remedial
legislation. We demand that some law be
passed, and so pledge our nominees. 1 - by ;
which the people can Identify by mark the.
goods made in Chinese sweat shops, so that
our patriotic people may be enabled to dis
criminate between the labor of their own
kind and that of those who live like para
sites upon the community and. In an ecoÂ»
comic sense, drain it of its, substance. V~=~.i>
| Home Industries.
Â»We call on all citizens to purchase no <
other goods than those of home production,
and manufacture, and thereby revive our
industries and employ our people.
Beligious Freedom.
The convention deplores the introduction
Into our political and social life of religious
tests, born of bigotry and intolerance, and
emphatically condemns any efforts to
thwart the liberal provisions of the consti
tution of our country with respect to abso
lute religious freedom.
City Officers.
We pledge our nomlnes for County Clerk
to conduct his office at a cost not to exceed
$76,000 per annum. Including his own salary,
and call the attention of the people of the
city and State to the outrage perpetrated
upon the Republican system of government
itself by the nomination of C. F. Curry, a
confessed pledge breaker and present in
cumbent of this office, for Secretary of
State. We pledge our nominees for Super
visors and Surveyor to reduce at least 33 1-3
per cent the fees now charged by the City
and County Surveyor, and tn allow no
charge In except of the Fchedul* now estab
lished by the Society of Civil Engineers.
We pledge our nominee for Recorder to
pay not more than 10 cents per folio for
copying inFtruments.
We pledge our nominee for Sheriff to turn
all fees Into the city and county treasury.
We pledge our nominee for District At
torney to prosecute with vigor all male
factors, especially In official places.
The office of Public Administrator is a
trust which has heretofore conferred enor
mous emoluments on the Incumbent and hla
attorney without any advantage to the
county treasury. If a public office be a pub
lic trust, and not a private "snap or
special privilege, then we pronounce tha
present system of converting an official
station Into a personal benefaction as con
trary to Democratic principles, and recom
mend Its rectification by appropriate legis
lation, and we particularly approve of the
proposed enactment that a Public Adminis
trator thall not employ counsel at the ex
pense of any f-statÂ» without the approval
of the court In advance of such employ
ment.
We pledgpe our legislative nominees to
favor legislation looking to the reduction of
the cost of litigation, especially In probate
tribunals, and the cutting down of the com
missions of executors and administrators,
and by a maximum schedule, attorneys'
fees, us proposed In the Braunhart bill, pre
sented to the last legislature.
We pledge our nominees for Superior and
Police Judges to put the shorthand reporters
of their courts upon a salary basis not ex
ceeding $200 per month. Inclusive of all work
to be performed by them, and to charge not
more than 5 cents per folio for transcrib
ing.
We condemn and call upon the people to
disapprove constitutional amendment No 1
providing for the payment of the city's
debts, because through the machinations of
certain street contractors, whose claims
have long since been rejected and outlawed,
the door of the treasury Is thrown wide open
to the payment of upward of $5,000,000.
We pledge our nominees for city and
county offices to give way to the provisions
of the new charter, which calls for a gen
eral municipal election In November, 1899,
so that that Important instrument may be
inaugurated according to its own terms as
approved by the people.
The nominees must sign this platform
within ten days from the date of its adop
tion, failing in which we declare their
places lpso facto vacated, and direct and
empower the committee on vacancies of this
convention to make new nominations for
the places so vacated.

DEMOCRATS
HOLD THEIR
PRIMARIES
Will Probably Fuse
With Populists.
CONVENTIONS SAME DAY
AN INDEPENDENT TICKET MAY
BE BORN.
Unfortunate Candidates Are Busy
Telling Each Other How They
Failed of Nomina
tion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 20.
Next Saturday the Democrats will hold
their county convention. There is not
a rush of candidates for the offices, but
still there are some who are willing to
take their chances. This evening the
primaries were held all over the county,
and the convention will be composed of
158 delegates.
The Populists primaries were also held
this evening, and their convention will
take place in Grand Army Hall next Sat
urday. An attempt is now being made
to appoint committees from each of the
conventions to agree upon a basis by
which the nominations can be divided
and a. complete fusion ticket nominated.
The Populists are split right in two, the
middle-of-the-road men having already
held their convention, and nominated a
county ticket.
Now that the Republican convention Is
over there is much talk of putting up a
complete Independent ticket. Already
enough candidates have signified their
intention of making independent cam
paigns to form the nucleus of such a
ticket.
James Taylor is already running inde-
Eendently for Coroner, Louis Schaffer for
heriff, A. K. Grim for Recorder, and it
is now said that Justice Clift could be
persuaded to run for District Attorney;
John Cronin for Township Justice, and
E. L. Lawrence for Justice of the Peace
of Brooklyn Township. Others are also
mentioned who would be willing to make
up a complete independent ticket, but
no such ticket would cut any figure In
this party year.
Justice Lawrence is the most surprised
man In the county to-day. He went to
the convention yesterday in a brand new
suit of clothes, In one pocket of which
was the nomination to succeeed himself.
Somehow or other, by one of those quirks
so common in untrammeled conventions.
Professor L. V. Inskeep received the
nomination, and Justice Lawrence is still
trying to llgure out how it was done.
Constable Cronin thinks he was not
rightly treated by the district conven
tion of Oakland Township. He also had
a cinch until the evening before the con
vention, but in the struggle Justice
Quinn came out on top. Cronin said that
Colonel Dan Burns turned him down, at
which everybody laughed, for this is the
first intimation that Colonel Burns took
any interest in the county ticket, al
though It is not impossible that he had an
interest in the legislative ticket.
The new Republican County Central
Committee elected yesterday Is as fol

A Hard Fight Against Freese.
A hard fight is being made against Cap
tain A. C. Freese, who Is seeking renomi
natlon for Public Administrator at the
hands of the local Democracy. After
looking around for several weefcjs for an
available man, the opponents of Freese
in the Committee of One Hundred decided
to back Dr. Washington Dodge, at present
a member of the Board of Supervisors,
for the places The result is that there is
a lively row on hand. Dr. Dodge, while
willing to accept the nomination for Pub
lic Administrator, is looking with envious
eye on the Assessorship, and it is said
that if the least opportunity affords itself
he will drop his political managers and
make a run for tne office held at pres
ent by John Siebe. Some of his friends
are now beginning to strenuously object
to his flirting with two offices filled with
golden political plums.
The Republicans would not weep over
the turning down of Freese, for they rec
ognize in him a strong candidate for any
office for which he may be nominated.

Duel on the Mississippi in Which
Both Principals Are Slain.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 20.--Word was re
ceived here to-day of a fatal duel be
tween Mate Bart Pavis and Night Watch
man Charles Baker on board the steamer
Mayflower of the Diamond Jo line, which
left here last night for Memphis. Both
men are deud.
For some time there had been ill feel
ing between the two men, and last night,
when the boat was tied up at Hugs
Landing, one mile from Croston, the
watchman attacked the mate with a
knife. For some time the struggle lasted,
both participants rolling about the deck
to the horror of the passengers, who were
unable to interfere. Finally, when the
mate, who had been cut in numerous
places, was about to give up, he suc
ceeded in drawing his revolver, and, with
a well directed shot, he laid ihe watch
man dead.
Stephen Hugs, proprietor of the land
ing, went up town for an officer and re
turned with Deputy Coroner Bell. They
found both the mate and watchman dead,
lying on the bloody deck.

Committee. Henry T. Gage, Jacob Neff

Ing majority of the Legislature.

mass meeting will be addressed by Ttrey
L. Ford, Republican nominee for Attorney
General, and also by Oregon Sanders. At

a topic of interest to ex-Senator Boggs.

ENDEAVORING TO FfX
OAKLAND'S TAX LEVY
THE COUNCIL STILL UNDECIDED
AS TO THE RATE.
It Will Probably Be $1 36âProvis
ion Is Made for Improving
Lake Merrltt.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 20.â At the meet-
Ing of the City Council to-night Coun
cilman Cuvelier introduced an ordinance
providing' a tax levy of $1 86. In speaking
about the measure he said that he had
provided a tax of $1 for the running ex
penses of the city government and for
Some sewer extensions, having practically
accepted the estimates of the Auditor on
the former. The only difference he made
was to cut the street light and the street
department funds a little, and not to
leave quite so much money in the general
fund.
As to the funds for the improvement of
Lake Merrltt and the building of sewers
adjacent, Mr. Cuvelller said that he had
provided for the raising of the entire
amount this fiscal year, as was provided
in the ordinance already passed to print.
In explanation of this feature of his ordi
nance, Mr. Cuvellier said he did not be
lieve in "taking two bites at a cherry?"
He stated that he had talked with vari
ous business men, and they said to go
ahead and make improvements; they
would not object to a few cents increase
In the tax levy. Mr. Cuvelller asserted
that the increase of the rate over $1 21
would not cost the man who paid taxes
on $1000 over $1 50. lie had also provided
for the extension of the east side sewer
and the Cemetery Creek Intercepting
sewer In his ordinance.
Councilman Girard also introduced an
ordinance fixing the tax levy at $1 15
Mr. Girard cuts off half of the Lake Mer
ritt appropriation and also the two sew
ers near the lake, but adds to the street
fund. Both ordinances were referred to
the committee with the suggestion that
when the original ordinance comes up
next Monday any changes may be made
by amendment in the regular manner. '
McKINLEY MAY COME WEST.
The President Expressed a Desire to
Visit the Pacific Coast.
Colonel Henry J. Kowalsky, who has
lately returned from the East, is of the
opinion that President McKlnley may
very easily be persuaded to visit Califor
nia after his trip to the Omaha Exposi
tion. Colonel Kowalsky was in Washing
ton about three weeks ago, and at. that
time had a personal interview with the
President on the subject. "President
McKinley expressed to me a very great
desire to visit California," said Colonel
Kowalsky. "He hns always been inter
ested in the State and has relatives here,
and told me that he had always looked
forward to a trip to the Pacific Coast.
He said if he could possibly arrange
it he would endeavor to make the trip
after visiting the Peace Jubilee at
Omaha and If so would spend several
weeks In the State.
"I believe that an urgent invitation
from the people of the State, and es
pecially from San Francisco, would bring
President McKinley to the coast at this
time. He Is coming to Omaha, anyway,
and if we make the invitation strong
enough he will be very likely to favor us
with a visit."

FOOLED WITH A BEVOLVEB.
An Accident on Bernal Heights That
May Besult in a Boy's Death.
The danger and gross carelessness of
parents leaving weapons wrthin the reach
of children was exemplified in a case
Monday afternoon which may result in
the death of a boy.
Daniel Mulcahey. the four-year-old son
of Thomas Mulcahey of 13S Ripley street,
and his elder brother, 6 years of age, went
to the house of a neighbor, John Bur
nett to keep Burnett's son, a boy 7 years
of age, company while his mother was
downtown. , ,
The boys discovered a revolver, ana
thought it would be good fun to act as
soldiers. They got tired of drilling and
then it was suggested to see the smoke
coming from the muzzle of the revolver.
Burnett after some difficulty pulled the
trigger. There was a report and a flash
and Daniel Mulcahey with a yell dropped
to the floor. The other two boys thor
oughly frightened, ran to Mrs. Mulcahey
and told her -'hat had happened. She
procured assistance and the wounded boy
was carried to her home. . ;
Dr Rinqe was summoned and he round
that the bullet had struck the boy on the
left arm and gone through, splintering
the bone, came out at the arm pit, en
tered <he chest and gracing a lung
finally lodged in the back. The doctor
extracted the bullet, but he has grave
fears for the recovery of the boy.
Mrs. Burnett did not know the revolver
was loaded. It belonged to her husband,
who is employed on the steamer Isortn
Fork.
A HIGH-PBICED PLAYEB.
Harry Cor son Clarke Objected to Act
ing to "Popular" Prices.
Harry Corson Clarke, the star in the
bill at the New Comedy Theater, and
Manager Leavltt do not speak as they
pass. Clarke claims that the manager of
the house reduced the prices for seats
In the house contrary to the understand
ing: that was reached when the actor con
sented to play at the New Comedy, and
consequently that scale of prices com
monly known as "popular" tended to
cheapen him In the theatrical world.
Clarke and his manager, S. B. Rlcaby,
say that when they booked to play at the
theater the choice seats of the house were
to be 75 cents and $1. On Monday night,
when the show opened, the actor was as
tonished to find that the seats or the
whole lower floor were selling at 50 cents.
A complaint was made and Leavitt gave
promises to remedy the cause of the
actor's objections. Last night the pro
grammes again announced that seats
would be obtainable at "popular" prices
and tickets were sole at the rate Clarke
had found fault with.
The actor refused to go on with the play
unless something more than assurances
were given him that the high scale of
prices would prevail during the remain
der of his engagement. To-night the
seats will be 75 cents and SI, and Clarke
maintains that even if there will not be
as large a house to greet him his repu
tation as a first-class and high-priced
player will not cuffer.

CONFESSION IS
DISCREDITED
Claims That the Guilt of Dreyfus Was Morally
Though Not Legally Proved Before Evidence
Was Manufactured.
Now Believed That He Was Taking Money From Both Sides for
Furnishing Information Supposed to Be of a Highly
Treasonable Character.
CHICAGO, Sept. 20.â A London cable
to the Inter Ocean says: Major Count
Esterhazy, who was recently retired
from the French army, still remains in
Ijondon, where he is now in the hands
of a well-known firm of police court
lawyers. The latter issued a statement
!n his behalf to-day, declaring he has
not authorized any confession or reve
lations in v the Dreyfus case. He de
clared that he intends to act "for the
best interests of his country and her
army." This grandiloquent declaration
from such a source is so grotesque that
It Is amusing.
Esterhazy has told three persons and
probably more within a month that he
Wrote the Dreyfus borderau. He also
described an interesting list of other
crimes committed In connection with
the case by himself and others. He af
firms there was moral, not legal, proof
of Dreyfus' guilt, and that the officers
of the French general staff resorted to
manufactured evidence In order to se
cure his condemnation, which was
really deserved.
He declared he wrote the borderau In
obedience to orders from a superior of
ficer and justifies his action by reason,
already cabled, that a "soldier should
place his conscience as well as his
sword at the disposal of his superior
officers." But his story of how he came
to write the borderau is almost certain
ly false.
Pie wrote it and handed it to two mil
itary officers of foreign powers before
Dreyfus was dreamed of in connection
ivlth th. affair. He wrote it under in
structions from officers of the intelli
gence department, by which he was
employed, in order to obtain greater se
crets in return.
He was. however, playing a double
game. He was needy, his French
stipend being insufficient to meet his
expenses and he really received money
from both sides and actually delivered
BOLINAS' BOY BANDIT
REGRETS HIS FOLLY!
Realizes Too Late the Disgrace He i
Has Brought Upon His
Family.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. . 20.â Victor Col
well, the youthful bandit who held up thÂ«
stage "running between this city and Bo-
Unas, Bat on the couch in his cell to
day the picture of abject misery and
despair. At the time of committing the
crime he .was partly under the Influence
of liquor, but now his mind has cleared
and he recognizes to the utmost his woe
ful predicament.
"I wish you would go and speak to my
Bister." he said to The Call representa
tive, "for God knows I cannot bear the !
ordeal. This must be an awful blow to i
my family."
Never did anybody speak more truly.
For months Grant Col well, the elder ':
brother, has been away from home, fight- :
Ing In his country's name as a member of
Roosevelt's Rough Riders, and during all
this time the anxious hearts at home j
have been living in momentary dread of I
hearing news of his fall under lire. Now
that the war is over and Grant is ex
pected home in a short time comes this
crushing blow, added to the disgrace
being the fear that the petted boy of the
family may have to spend a long term
behind prison walls.
When Miss Idelle Colwell, the prisoner's
only sister, heard the news, she was so
overcome by the shock that she had to
be assisted home. The poor mother is
very ill with grief.
Colwell himself is so despondent that :
It is feared he may attempt to commit ;
suicide, and the utmost precaution has |
been taken by Sheriff Harrison to pre- i
vent such an act. Every instrument by
which he could accomplish the act is !
kept out of his way, and his cellmate,
a man named Allen, has been requested I
to keep a strict watch on all Colwell's
movements. __ Â§>

AN ESCAPED CONVICT
MET BY A HUNTER
Alton H. Gould, a San Quentin
Trusty, Seen Near San
Rafael.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 20.â While hunting
on Jorgensen Hill this evening, be
tween this city and San Anselmo, a
youth named Angelo Albini met a man
exactly answering the description of Al
ton H. Gould, the convict that escaped
from San Ouentin Prison last Sunday
evening. On perceiving Albini the man
turned and ran out of sight. It was but
a short time until a number of guards
were on the trail, but up to a late hour
their quest was in vain.
At 5 p. m. yesterday Gould was seen in
the hills near West End Station by Wal
ter Hmith. He was men dressed in con
vict garb, but to-day he had on an old
coat and vest of dark material and a
lair of faded blue overalls, evidently
Etolf-n from some farm house.
The knowledge' that the misty is still at
large jias had the effect of keeping wo
men living in the outskirts of this clty
and in the county, between here and
Sausallto, in a state of nervous apprehen
sion. No children are permitted to play
In the streets, and the suburbs appear de
serted at night.

Bcottish Rite, Northern Masonic Jurisdic

LOST IN THE MOUNTAINS.
Thrilling Experience of Mrs. Cyrus
Newton of Woodland.
WOODLAND, Sept. 20.â Cyrus Newton
and family have returned from a camping
trip in Mendocino County. During thHr
?xuy they had an experience which
neither Mr. Newton nor his wife will soon
forget. Mr. Newton left camp for a hunt.
He was gone so much longer than was
expected that Mrs. Newton feared Homc
thfng had happened to him and, takine
her 3-year-old child in her arms, started
in search of him. She wandered about
ueveral hours and finally lost her way.
Night coming on 'she was compelled to
remain out until morning. At daylight
the documents- named In the borderau.
When the fact that the documents
were missing was discovered Esterhazy
claimed the borderau from those to
whom it had been delivered. That was
why the borderau was in pieces and
not because it had been extracted from
the waste paper basket at the German
embassy.
The borderau was handed to a civil
spy, who was charged with its trans
mission to General Mercier, then Min
ister of War. As yet Dreyfus was posi
tively unsuspected. Esterhazy trusted
to a chapter of accidents for finding a
resemblance between his handwriting
and that of some one else, no matter
who.
Had the handwriting of the borderau
resembled that of any officer but a Jew,
and a Jew so thoroughly disliked as
was Dreyfus, the victim of the error
would have got off with five or ten
years' imprisonment.
But it was almost the counterpart of
the handwriting of the bete noir of the
general staff, for Dreyfus was that.
Given half a dozen Paty dv Clams,
Henrys, Sandherrs, who were without
scruples a-s to the means of satisfying
their hatred, and the rest followed as a
matter of course.
The manufacture of false evidence
did not end with the borderau, and
Esterhazy, could, if he chose, make
many more startling revelations, but he
is so utterly discredited, and so per
sistently mixes truth and falsehood
that it is doubtful if any statement he
makes will gain credence even among
the friends of Dreyfus, whose cause it
would help.
Esterhazy is now almost penniless.
He is extremely bitter against his
farmer associates, who have now aban
doned him. There are some indications
that the partial revelations of the past
few days will bring some of those whom
Esterhazy would involve by a full con
fession once more to his support. In
that case this precious individual will
probably become once more the cham
pion of the military honor and glory of
France.
the next day she made an effort to find
her way back to camp. Footsore an<l
famished she had . almost abandoned
hope, when about 11 oVlock she sighted
a cabin. Here she obtained rest and|foo'J
and later was found by her husband, who,
on discovering her absence from camp,
walked ten miles for help and organizes
a searching party.
CORBETT AND M'COY '
MAY FIGHT AT ROBY
CLEVELAND. Sept. 20.â A special to
the Plain Dealer from La Porte, Ind..
says: Roby, which in past years was the
scene of many pugilistic battles, may be
made the arena for the pulling off of the
tight between Corbett and McCoy.
Private advices from Roby give the de
tails of the proposed meeting. Architects
have been at work for several days on the
plans for the conversion of the betting
ring at Roby into a fighting arena, with
a seating capacity of 10,000.
The details of the meeting*of the glad
iators are in the hands of Stuart, Consi
dine and John Condon of racetrack fame
and a secret meeting held at Mount Clem
ens. Mich., resulted in Roby being select
ed as the battleground for the two heavy
weights.
It is the evident purpose to keep both
McCoy and Corbett in training without
revealing the exact location of the fight.

TOLEDO, 0., Sept. 20.â Eight persons
cremated and eight seriously injured is
the result of the most disastrous flre
that ever occurred in Toledo. The dead
are:
SAMUEL ALEXANDER.
BERT WAINWRIGHT.
FRED GARRET.
HAROLD PARKS.
JOHN SMITH.
GRACE PARKS.
FRANK VAN HOUSEN.
JOHN CARR.
The injured are:

William J. Parks,
W. C. Jordan.
Peter Haas.
Al Baldie.
Four others, names unknown.
The spontaneous combustion of duet
in the grain elevator owned by Pad
dock, Hodge & Co. at 9 o'clock caused
this destruction of life, and none of
those who were taken out after the
fire started were far enough away from
death's door to tell any of the details.
William J. Parks, the superintendent,
after having been blown through the
window of the lower story, was con
scious for a moment and said that at
about 8:30 a terrible explosion occurred
on the south side of the elevator. He
knew there were about twenty men at
work on the seven floors of the build
ing.
Besides those regularly employed at
the elevator, the three children of Su
perintendent Parks were visiting him
at the time. One of these may re
cover, but Grace, a 17-year-old girl, is
burned almost beyond recognition, and
Harold, the third child, has not been
found, having been either blown to
atoms or cremated.
All over Toledo houses were shaken
by the explosion as by an earthquake
and windows were shattered for blocks
around. Very soon afterward flames
burst from all sides of the elevator.
It was but a few minutes before the
Fire Department began the work of
rescue, which was rendered difficult by
the terrific heat. The river cut off es
cape on one side and there the flames
seemed to be less fierce. The families
of a dozen men who were known to
have been at work within rushed to
the scene and women calling for their
Imprisoned husbands, brothers and
fathers made a scene indescribable.
It was learned that a force of twenty
men had been In the building, their
purpose having been to load 80,000
bushels of grain during the night. No
one of the entire number could be seen
in any part of the building, and it was
impossible to reach them in any way.
William Parks was found first. He
was twenty feet from the building,
frightfully burned and his clothes al
most entirely torn off. He had been
hurled from his place in the main room
through a window and his cries were
most pitiful. Another employe, John
Carr, was hurled from the fifth floor of
the building and was found bleeding
and burned, with many bones broken.
He did not long survive. Fireman Da
vid Kemp and Charles Kelfer, the en
gineer, were found at their places in
the engine room. They were injured by
falling timbers/and their faces were
charred to a cnjsp by the flames.
The little daughter of William Parks
was sitting at the desk in the office at
the time of the explosion, and was
hurled out of the door. She walked
down the elevation on which the build
ing stands and fell, to be carried away
unconscious, suffering from injuries
from which she cannot recover.
John Smith was fatally burned. He
was literally disemboweled and was ta
ken to the hospital to die.
The missing men are doubtless all
dead. No trace can be found of any of
them and as they were employed at the
top of the elevator their chances for
escape were but slight.
The heat became so intense that
twenty cars standing on the siding near
the building were added to the loss.
The fire department had a hard strug
gle to save other elevators and prop-
erty.
The bridge across the Maumee River
was on fire several times, but outside
of the loss of the elevator the damage
is slight.
Mr. Paddock, a member of the firm
owning the plant, said there was be
tween 500,000 and 800,000 bushels of
grain In storage at the time, most of
it being winter wheat. The property
and the grain Is an entire loss and will
reach $450,000. The insurance is $135,000
on the building and the grain is covered
with $258,000 insurance.
At 12:20 o'clock the flames were under
control.
A later revision of the fire loss shows
the buildings and contents are valued
at $550,000. The damage to adjoining
property is $8000.
Superintendent Parks and one of the
unknown men died early this morning
from their injuries, making the total
number of fatalities ten.
EVACUATION OF
PORTO RICO NOW
WELL UNDER WAY
EQtire Island Will Be Turrjed Over
to the flmericaQS Within
Three WeeKs.
Special Cable to The Call and the Hew York Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, ,
by James Gordon Bennett.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Sept. 20.â Evacuation was begun In ear
nest to-day. Four hundred Spanish officers and soldiers embarked on
the steamer San Francisco, bound for Spain. The detachment march
ed quietly to the wharf and entered barges, which wer â¢ towed to the
ship. A curious crowd was attracted, but there was no demonstra
tion.
Twelve hundred more Spaniards will sail to-morrow, and two
large transports are expected to arrive September 26, which will
carry the remainder.
The Spanish Commissioners announced at to-day's meting that
they expected to turn the island over to the American authorities with
in three weeks. It was agreed to-day to immediately evacuate five
towns at the eastern end of the island. The concentration of the
movement to San Juan has now fully begun. Cayey and Caguas will
probably be evacuated next week.
SPAIN NOT DISPOSED
TO YltLO EVERYTHING
Will Seek to Compromise in the Ne
gotiations to Be Conducted at
Paris.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â A Sun cable
from Madrid says: The Cabinet council
was in session five hours to-day. The
Ministers fully approved the instructions
to the peace commissioners, who will
start for Paris on Sunday.
The instructions to the Spanish peace
commissioners covered several pages and
are mainly devoted to the question of the
Philippines. They are less precise re
specting the West Indies, the disposition
of which was virtually settled by the pro
tocol.
Nevertheless, the commissioners are
definitely instructed concerning the Cu
ban debt and commercial relations, upon
which points they are to insist strenu
ously. All negotiations will be subject to
the direct approval of the Cabinet.
It is said that the instructions are
drawn in the spirit of a compromise.
NEW CHARTER ADOPTED
AT SANTA BARBARA
After Three Attempts in as Many
Years, It Receives a Very
Large Majority.
SANTA BARBARA. Sept. 20.â The new
charter for the city of Santa Barbara was
to-day adopted by a very large majority.
This is the third attempt to adopt a new
charter by this city in as many years.
It is modeled after the charter of New
York city and is modern is every re
spect. The Mayor is given much greater
power. He now will have the power to
appoint and remove the City Marshal and
Assessor, besides many petty officers. The
charter goes into effect in January, 1900.
BANKING HOUSE SEEKS
TO PURCHASE CONTROL
Humor of the Proposed Transfer of
the Chicago Great Western
Well Founded.
NETV YORK. Sept. 20.â An authority on
the Chicago Great "Western said to-day
concerning rumors of the company's ab
sorption with the Baltimore and Ohio:
"It is true that an offer has been made
by a prominent banking house to pur
chase control of the Chicago Great West
ern. This is all that can be said on the
subject at this time."
YOLO POPULIST DBOPS OUT.
C. W. Hatcher Declines to Bun for
the Assembly.
WOODLAND, Sept. 20.â C. W. Hatcher,
middle-of-the-road Populist nominee for
the Assembly, has declined. This leaves
but one nominee, J. R. Mitchell, for the
Assembly, in the field. There ls a big
row in the Populist camp. There were
only three members at the first meeting.
Two of these seceded. The third drummed
up five more a week later, and had him
self nominated for the Assembly. As he
is of Republican antecedents, the only
effect will be to injure the prospects of
Q. W. Pierce, the Republican nominee.

Etsjex* For more than ten years I suffered severely from dyspepsia, and dor*
ing that time consulted many physicians. First it was the family
doctor in New York, where I then resided, and later I had treat-
ment at the New York Hospital, but obtained no permanent relief
For over -a month I had visited my family physician in Bayonne.
twice in every week, and as a last resort an appointment had been
made when 1 was to to the process of having the stomach
washed out by the siphon arrangement, which is found a mofa at
treatment more beneficial in its effects than enjoyable In the pro-
cess. About this time, however. I had a conversation witn a
friend who w?i acquainted with the merits of Ripans Tabules, and
he presented me with a box for trial. Well, I did try them, and
could feel that they did me good, so I bought more, and in my
house nowadays you will always find a supply of Ripans Tabulee.
I find them easier to take than powders or liquids, or even than
swallowing hot water in the morning. My condition is so much
improved that of late I have had no occasion to resort to them
at all. Before I found the Tabules, mv bill for attendance and
medicine was rarely less than three dollars a week. Ths Tabula
hare not only improved my condition, but have been efficaeiovf
in the case of friends to whom I have recommeaded than.

JOCKEY THORPE
IN THE SADDLE
Pilots Two Winners at
Sacramento.
FIVE FAVORITES IN FRONT
BING ROUGHLY HANDLED BY
THE BETTORS.
Grady an Easy Victor in the Mile
Mid Fifty Yards Race â Hennessy
Fined by the Judges for
the. Same Old Offense,
Special Dispatch to The Call. '
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 20.-Racing at thte
park this afternoon received fresh im
petus by the reappearance In the saddle
of the premier Western rider, Charley
Thorpe. The "grand old man" rode with
all of his old-time dash and vigor, and
was heartily received by the crowd. Per
haps his effort on Shasta Water was not
a most toothsome turf morsel, but he
piloted Gold Fin and Bonnibel over the
bar safely, and bettors forgave the other.
The ring laid liberal prices against the
different starters, and as live straight
choices hit the wire in front it quit behind
on the day's booking. The sport is above
the average, and the management looks
forward to an increased attendance the
balance of the meeting.
Thorpe donned his riding clothes for
the tirst time since his return here, and
eat astride Gold Fin, the 7 to 10 favorite
In the opening event for two-year-olds.
He was In front all the way, winning han
dily from Correct, a green youngster,
carrying the colors of "Curly" feuields.
For his weak effort on OJai, the second
choice, which finished third, Ruiz was
suspended for one week.
Hermanita was chosen to win the mile
and a sixteenth selling run, and, taking
the lead from Rose Maid and Ringmaster
at the far turn, won in fashionable man
ner. Coda might have made a stronger
bid, but the three pounds over weight
carried by Gus Wilson seriously retarded
her chances. The mare finished an easy
second over Ringmaster.
Quite a cluster" of class and speed faced
the barrier in the one mile and fifty yards
purse race. Grady, with Hennessy up.
was a pronounced favorite, with 9 to 5
chalked against Shasta Water and sixes
about Rey del Tierra, The favorite had
all the speed, and, taking the lead from
Rey del Tlerra three furlongs from home,
won with pounds to spare in l:4o. Thorpe
on Shasta Water allowed himself to be
cut off going down the back stretch, and
was not much of a factor thereafter.
The six-furlong sprint for two-year
olds which followed looked a legacy ror
Bonibel, the 3 to 5 favorite, but it took
every ounce of speed the roan fllly pos
sessed to land. Ocorona, with little Levin
in the saddle, made a bold bid In the
Btretch, and at the wire, after a long
drive, was beaten but a neck. Hannah
Reid, the second choice, hard ridden by
Piggott, finished in the show.
The final Bix-furlong selling affair fell
to William 08, the 1 to 2 choice, piloted
by Frawley. Trappean, ridden by Mike
Hennessy, made all the running and was
nabbed and beaten only in the last few
strides. Hennessy was inclined to claim
too much territory, and was fined $25 for
foul riding Fashion Plate started for the
first time, and received a listless rivie.

SUICIDE OF A WIFE-BEATER.
Jack Wilson Takes a Dose of Mor
phine at Mensem.
VISALJA, Sept. 20.â Jack Wilson, who
has been twice arrested and convicted
of wife-beating, committed suicide by
, taking morphine at Monson Saturday.
Wilson had evidently mado full prepara
tion for committing suicide, as he had
dressed himself in a new suit of clothes
and placed a new pair of shoes beside the
bed. On the porch was found a bottle
containing a small quantity of morphine.
On the 2th of this month he was re
leased from the Fresno County Jail and
it is presumed that remorse for his dis
solute ways so preyed on his mind that
be determined to end his troubles and his
life by committing suicide. He was a
native of England, 46 years of age.

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CAI/L, WEDff ESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1893.
PROSPERITY'S ERA
ON THE RANGES
All Kinds of Stock in
Demand.
COMPETITION AMONG BUYERS
BIG EASTERN FIRMS EJNiTER THE
FIELD.
Fair Prices the Rule in the Cattle
Districts of Northern California
and Southeastern
Oregon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Sept. 20.â Never until the
present season has there been such a
thorough cleaning up of marketable
stock on the great cattle runs of North
ern California, Southeastern Oregon
and portions of Nevada. Only within
the past few years have Eastern buy
ers figured as an important factor In
the stock transactions of these sec
tions. To-day the buying agents of the
great packing houses of Chicago, St.
Paul, Omaha. and Kansas City are ab
solute masters of the situation. They
fix the prices and secure the choice of
the ranges.
Owing to shortages in the Eastern
supply this year the necessities of the
packing interests compelled the buy
ers to scour the most remote stock re
gions in search of beef and mutton,
and territory that has hitherto been
considered as properly belonging to
San Francisco has not been free from
invasion. Prices have consequently
been stiffened, greatly to the advantage
of stockmen. Money is now plentiful
in stock centers and all over the ranges,
not altogether because of enhanced
values, but more on account of the vol
ume of sales effected
For the San Francisco market most
of the cattle secured In extreme North
i era California and Southeastern Ore
gon is shipped from Siskiyou County
points. Edson - rothers are steady ship
pers from Gr-elle. The drought in
Southern California enabled them to
buy in San Luis Obispo 1000 head of
starving cattle. They also bought up
several large bunches of cattle on the
Catalina Islands. This stock was
shipped by rail to Gazelle and turned
out on the well-watered Siskiyou
ranges. These bargains enabled them
to turn off every marketable hoof on
their runs and yet have ample stock
for the succeeding season.
From Ager, Hornbrook and Montague
are shipped all of the stock bought in
Southeastern Oregon for the San Fran
cisco market From one to five special
stock trains a week pass through this
city en route to Sacramento and San
Francisco. Considerable stock is also
shipped from Cottonwood and Red
Bluff.
In Modoc County Eastern buyers ship
cattle and sheep to the packing houses
by way of Reno and the Central route.
Within the past week a bunch of 500
beeves brought $24 50 each all round on
the range. This was in Big Valley.
On Butte Creek sales have been made
lately for $25 a head on the range. A
domestic buyer at Adin secured a bunch
of 450 prime beeves at 4 to 5% cents.
A recent report from Modoc and Las
sen counties says that stockmen have
sold more cattle and sheep this year
than for seven years past, and from
present indications there are enough
buyers in the field to handle every mar
ketable Ijoof in both counties. Not
only are the regular foreign buyers
taking all they can contract for in the
way of beef and mutton, but local men
are buying for speculation.
While the cattle sales are the heav
iest known in years and perhaps in
volve a much larger sum in ready
money, yet the transactions in sheep
are far in excess, head for head, of cat
tle sales. Wool is on the move also.
A sale was made in Lake County, Ore
gon, on the 12th instant of 100,000
pounds at 13% cents.
During the past week 50,000 lambs
have been shipped from Halleck, Ne
vada, to Eastern points. The average
price paid was $2 60 on the range.
From Reno, including drives from. Ore
gon and from Modoc and Lassen coun
ties, 76,000 lambs have been shipped to
the Swift and Armour packing nouses
fn Chicago. The price, in this In
stance, ranged from $2 50 to $2 65, de
livered on the cars.
Montana sheepmen spent twp weeks
on a buying expedition through Grant,
Cook and Gilliam counties, Oregon, and
failed to secure a single head of sheep,
notwithstanding they offered the at
tractive price of $4 80 per pair for ewes
and lambs.
Red Bluff is becoming the head cen
ter for sheep in Northern California.
Sales for the current season have
reached the enormous total of 40,000
head, at prices ranging for mutton
from $2 50 to ?3 25. Lambs brought in
the neighborhood of $2 each. These are
big prices when it is remembered that
up to within a couple of years ago
sheep could hardly be got rid of at half
the price.
At Amadee, a railroad terminus In
Lassen County, the sheep market is
booming. Eastern buyers are taking
everything in sight at $2 50 per head.
From the 10th to the 15th instant P. L.
Flannigan, a local buyer and an ex
tensive flockmaster, transferred to
imoklnÃ h<Â»uiK! agents 40,000 lambs.
The only bad speculation in livestock
that may be noted the present season
was the driving to Nebraska of 600
head of horses from Eastern Oregon.
The best offer received was less than
$2 a head. .

No C. 0. D. or Deposit Scheme.
CALTHOS is no* recognized by all Intellli
gent physicians as the only perfect, permanent
and unfailing cure for Spermatorrhoea, Impot-
ency and Varicocele yet discovered. It is a
preparation of the French scientist. Prof. Jules
Laborde, the world's greatest specialist In ner-
vous diseases.
It was Prof. Laborde who first discovered,
and proved to the satisfaction of the French
Academy by the record of 859 cases, that these
dread diseases are due to nervous debility, and
that no treatment which failed to recognize
that fact and strike at the root of the trouble
could do more than $ive temporary relief.
CALTHOS strikes at the root. It cures the
disease and removes the cause. It Is the only
remedy known to science that will absolutely
cure nervous debility. It has for years been
used as a specific In the French and Germatt
Armies. It has a record of a vast "number of
perfect cures in every part of Europe. It is
duplicating Its foreign success in this country.
It Is controlled In this country solely by The
Yon Mohl Co., of Cincinnati, and Is sold under
their positive guarantee, signed and acknowl-
edged, that It will effect a perfect cure.
Every man who suffers from sexual weak-
ness, premature loss of strength and memory,
emissions, varicocele, shrunken parts, lmpot-
ency, or any of the other awful results of early
abuses, excesses, or overwork and nervous
strain, can be cured if he will but avail himself
of the CALTHOS treatment.
The time to do so is now. Neither CALTHOS
nor anything else on earth can cure you aftar

train of nervous debility and sexual diseases.
So remarkable has been the success of CAL-
THOS and so certain Is The Yon Mohl Co. ol
its ability to effect a cure In every case that. In
order to give every sufferer In the country ah
opportunity to learn Just what this remedy can
do for him, It has decided to give everyont who
ATTACKED By AN
ENRAGED BUCK
A Thrilling Combat on
Bolinas Ridge.
MAN AND HORSE IN PERU
GORED BY A MONARCH OF THE
GLEN.
Peculiar Circumstances of the En
counter and Lucky Stroke That
Turned the Tide of
Battle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 20.â Albert Say
ers, proprietor of the San Rafael and
Bolinas stage line, had an encounter
with an enraged deer last evening that
almost resulted in the loss of his life.
The circumstances of the case are
most peculiar.
About 5 o'clock in the afternoon Say
ers was passing down a wooded slope
on Bolinas ridge in a bueerv when an
enraged buck bounded out of the brush
and ran into a wheel of the vehicle with
such force that* it. was thrown to the
ground. Maddened with the pain of the
collision, it rose to its feet and ran at
the horse, trying to thrust its horns into
the animal's side. Fearing that his
horse, a valuable animal, would be dis
emboweled, Sayers drew a pocket-knife
and leaped out of the buggy.
At the first jab of the knife the in
furiated buck turned on Sayers, who
was knocked down by the fierce on
slaught. He managed to secure a hold
on one of the antlers an! tried to cut
the deer's throat, but could not get in
an effectual blow. The struggle was so
furious that Sayers was soon winded
and nearly at the mercy of the angry
buck, when a lucky opportunity pre
sented itself and he drove the knife
deep into its neck. At this juncture the
deer gave the whistle peculiar to its
species, and, with a parting stroke of
its hoof that gashed Sayers' hand,
broke away and fled into the forest.
During the encounter the horse stood
perfectly still, evidently palsied with
fright. Its sides were badly torn by the
buck's horns, and Sayers himself suf
fered numerous cuts and bruises and
had his trousers shredded by the deer's
hoofs.

REDLANDS WATER FAMINE.
REDLAN.DS, Sept. 20.â Redlands Is
threatened with a water famine. The
users of irrigation water have been noti
fied by the Bear Valley Water Com
pany that they will be given but one
fourteenth the usual supply for use on
orchards the rest of this season. The
supply In Bear Valley is very low. Urir
less rains set in soon not only the pres
ent crop of oranges will be lost,. but also
the trees will be killed.
The domestic water company took off
its sprinkling carts to-day and stopped all
use of water for power purposes. Con
sumers will be given but two hours a
week to irrigate their lawns and trees.
A mass meeting of citizens last night
denounced the Bear Valley sale of
water to outsiders as robbery and ap
pointed a committee to devise ways and
means to secure an adequate water sup
ply for irrigation and domestic use.
Residents are being supplied with drink

TO BE BENEFITED
BY THE EXTENSION
President Ripley of the Santa Fe
on the Bakersfield - Los
Railway.
Hopes to Make Arrangements Whereby His Line
Will Exchange Business With the
Valley Road.
CHICAGO, Sept. 20.â President E. P. Ripley of the Santa
Fe Railroad was seen at his home at Riverside and asked to give
his views of the effect on California and the Southern Pacific
Railroad of the construction of the Bakersfield and Los An
geles Railroad. He said:
"The names of the incorporators of the Bakersfield and Los
Angeles road indicate that the proposed road is to be an exten
sion of the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley road, which is
now built down the valley as far as Bakersfield, and will prob
ably have a terminus on San Francisco Bay within a year. Pre
sumably the intention in building to Los Angeles is not only to
connect there with the Santa Fe system, but to compete with the
Southern Pacific Company for business between Northern and
Southern California.
"We have no traffic contract with the Valley road, having
heretofore had no way of connecting with it, but if the interven
ing link is to be built it will doubtless result in our exchanging
more or less business with the new road.
"The line to be built passes over the Tehachapi Mountains
at a considerable elevation, and I should say it would take nearly
a year to finish it, so that no immediate change is imminent.
"As to the effect on the Southern Pacific, it can only be said
that when this road is completed there will be two railroads
competing for trade in Northern California. Heretofore there
has been but one road there, while in Southern California the
Santa Fe has been a competitor.
"The northern part of the State will undoubtedly be great
ly benefited by the construction of this new road."
FUSION A FIZZLE
IN LOS ANGELES
Three Platforms That
Disagree.
PULL AGAINST EACH OTHER
BOUND TO MAKE TROUBLE FOB,
MAGUIRE.
Senator White Makes a Flea for Har
mony in the Democratic Con
vention and Names a Man
for Sheriff.
Special Dispatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 20.â Fusion In
this county will not be harmonious.
This fact was clearly demonstrated by
the first day's session of the three fu
sion county conventions held at Santa
Monica to-day. Three platforms were
adopted and they do not by any means
agree. Of all three platforms the Pop
ulists probably adopted the strongest
one. The Democrats in their platform
failed to mention Congressman Charles
A. Barlow, while the Populists in their
platform not only indorsed Barlow, but
gave him all the credit for results ac
complished at Washington during the
past two years in behalf of San Pedro
harbor. Senator White was not given
credit for doing anything. The fail
ure of the Democrats to mention Bar
low is going to cause trouble, and
Judge Maguire, as well as the entire
Democratic State ticket, will suffer at
the ballot box as a result.
The meetings at this time are mere
ly adjourned sessions. Fusion agree
ment as to the division of offices had
all been settled except as to the office
of District Attorney. This piece of of
ficial pie the Silver Republicans had
sK their hearts upon, 1 at they will not
get it. No agreement has yet been
reached.
There would have been a hot fight in
the Democratic convention for the
nomination for Sheriff, but Senator
White interposed his good offices. In a
speech in which he made a strong plea
for harmony White named Supervisor
James Hanly and he was nominated by
acclamatlon.
The silk-stocking element of the
Democratic party had planned to read
half a dozen delegates, including
Thomas McCaffery and A. W. Conkling,
out of the party. But Conkling and
MK'afTery secured a majority of the
delegates and the proposition to hu
miliate them was dropped.
The proposition of fusion in Los An
geles, as indicated by the conventions
to-day, has brought a lot of discordant
elements together and it is clear that
they cannot work together In harmony.
Senator Del Valle made a strong speech
condemnatory of fusion in the Demo
cratic convention and he voiced the
sentiments of 200 of the 700 delegates.
THREE WARSHIPS TO
GO INTO COMMISSION
Cruisers Chicago and Atlanta and
Gunboat Yorktown Will Be
Placed on Duty.
NEW YORK. Sept. 20.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
It is the intention of the Navy Depart
ment to place three men of war In com
mission during the coming month. These
are the cruisers Chicago and Atlanta,
which have been undergoing repairs at
the New York navy-yard for two years,
and the gunboat Yorktown. which has
been put in condition for service at the
Mare Island navy-yard. The Chicago
nnd Atlanta will be assigned to the
North Atlantic fleet until the conclusion
of the treaty of peace with Spain, when
their future station will be determined.
The Yorktown will be assigned to the
Asiatic station, where the need of smaller
uniiuats in the waters of China and the
Philippines is especially Mt.
Captain V. P. Cooper has oeen assigned
to the command of the Chicago, and Com
mander C. S. Perry, equipment officer of
the navy-yard, has been selected to com
mand the Yorktown. So far as can be
learned the Atlanta's commanding of
ficer has not been determined upon. It
will not be surprising if the Chicago is
assigned to the European squadron to be
formed probably in November. The in
tention of the department to relieve Com
modore J. w. Philin, in command of the
second squadron of the North Atlantic
fleet, in the event of continued peace, and
assign him to duty as commandant of the
Boston navy-yard, is regarded as indi
cative of the intention of the authorities
to send Commodore H. L. Howlson to sea.
As the European squadron will be the
only commodore's "ost which will he va
cant, it would not be surprising if he
were assigned to that command.
DESPERADO FINNEY
WILL RAID NO MORE
Brought Down by a Charge of Buck
shot From an Arizonian's
Gun.
BISBEE, Ariz.. Sept. 20.â Arthur Fin
ney. known as "Pegleg" Finney, a noto
rious character here, was shot and killed
at San Bernardino ranch, forty miles
southeast of here, yesterday by ex-Sheriff
Slaughter. Finney hired a livery rig here
on Sunday night and sold it at" La Mor-
Ita. on the Mexican line, robbed a saloon
and stable there, stole a saddle, a Win
chester and one of the horses he had
sold, and made toward San Bernardino.
By a traveler coming to Blfsbee he sent
a note to the authorities as follows:
"Send your officers after me if you want
them klllM."
Slaughter was telegraphed to to arrest
Finney. He met Finney and commanded
him to surrender. Instead, Finney raised
his Winchester, but Slaughter was too
quick and killed him instantly with a load
of buckshot.
Everything was recovered, including
the money and Jewelry, and the body is
being brought to Bisbee to-night.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 18118.
COLOMBIA'S REVENGE.
Severs All Diplomatic Rela
tions With Italy.
PANAMA, Colombia, Sept. 20.
Information was received here
to-day from the highest author
ities In Bogota to the effect that
Colombia has severed all diplo
matic arrangements with Italy.
The Government, according to
the report, has abrogated all ex
isting treaties between the two
countries, has handed the Charge
d'Affaires of Italy his passports
and canceled the exequateurs of
all Italian Consuls and consular
agents throughout Colombia.
This radical action has been
taken, I am informed, as a retal
iation for the humiliation of the
country when it was forced a
few weeks ago to make acknowl
edgment of its obligation to pay
the Cerruti claim at the mouth
of the guns of Admiral Candl
ani's fleet at Cartagena.
The Government of the coun
try, it is reported, argues that
Colombia has nothing to lose by
this course and Italy all. The
former's exports to Italy are of
no Importance, while Italy's ex
ports to Colombia are extensive.
Many Italians, it is asserted, will
suffer.
JIM REA FACES
A SLANDER SUIT
Complaint of Ex-Coun
cilman Jarman.
BOSS CALLS HIM A CROOK
SEEKS FIFTY THOUSAND DOL
LARS DAMAGES.
Eminent Legal Talent Employed on
Both Sides and Much New
Folitical Hlstcry Is
Looked For.
Special Dispatch to The C&W.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 20.â The $50,000 slan
der suit brought against "Jim" Rea by
ex-Councilman J. P. Jarman, com
menced before Judge Kittredge to-day.
Great interest is taken in the action
and Rea's henchmen and tin-horn poli
ticians filled the courtroom. An expose
of Rea's methods of doing politics is
promised. The legal battle will be a
hard-fought one. Jarman is represented
by D. M. Delmas, E. A. Wilcox and A.
H. Jarman, while Rea's attorneys are
Senator H. V. Morehouse, D. W. Bur
chard and Ed Rea. Each party to the
suit is represented by a son.
The complaint In the case states that
on March 14, 1898, in the presence of
George Koenig, plaintiff and other good
and worthy persons of San- Jose, James
W. Rea uttered the following words:
"There was $900 paid on the purchase
of that steam roller to some of the
Counoilmen and you got $400 of it."
These words are denounced as faise,
unprivileged, malicious and defamatory,
and it is alleged have exposed the
plaintiff to hatred, contempt and dis
grace to the extent of $25,000. 'As
further and separate cause It is set
forth that on March 11, 1898, in con
versation with Samuel Q. Tompkins
and others defendant Rea spoke as fol
lows:
"You have got some crooked men in
the Charter Club." Whereupon Tomp
kins asked: "Who, for instance?"
Rea replied: "Jack Jarman. He
robbed the city when he was in the
Council. What did he do with that $900
that he got on the purchase of a steam
roller?"
For this slanderous utterance $25,000
is also asked, making a total of $50,000.
Great care was exercised in selecting
a jury and from the questions asked
jurymen it seems that some new politi
cal history will be made. The prosecu
tion asked the Jurymen if they knew
Rea or J. D. Mackenzie belonged to po
litical organizations or had relatives in
the school department, while Rea's at
torneys wanted to know if the Jurors
belonged to the Good Government
League or Charter Club.
The following citizens comprise the
jury: J. Clevenger, Otto Brasch, G. W.
Leay, Henry Davidson, C. Bertlesman,
E. L. Moody, Walter Murray, H. Rich,
H. Weilheimer, G. W. Glendennlng, J.
A. Gamble and A. C. McKenney.
Most of them are orchardlsts and all
representative men.
J. P. Jarman was called to the stand
and questioned by Attorney Delmas.
He said he had resided in this city
about thirty years. Witness said he
was engaged in the wall paper, paint
and oil business. He was elected a
member of the City Council in 1895 and
served two years. While a member of
that body a proposition came up to
purchase a steam Btreet-roller. The
matter was referred to the street com
mittee, of which he was chairman, and
the committee examined the matter
and reported in favor of the purchase.
This was after Sacramento, Stockton
and other places were communicated
with. Witness, with Councilmen Fay
and Noltlng, Mayor Koch and Chief
of Police Kldward, went to Stockton
and Investigated the merits of the rol
ler. The Mayor and Council in session
considered the purchase of the roller.
The price was given as $3900. At
witness' suggestion a reduction in the
price was asked. Magarde, agent for
the roller, stated that the machines
were never sold for leas than $3900.
Jarman said he suggested that it was
customary to make a reduction in the
price of articles for cash, and Magarde
finally knocked off $200 in the price. *
On March 14, 1898, he had a conversa
tion with Rea on North First street,
near the Southern Pacific Railroad. At
that time Jarman was a candidate for
Councilman on the New Charter Club
ticket, and he believed Rea opposed his
election. There were present Mrs.
Knox Goodrich and George Koenig and
Landers, painters in the employ of
plaintiff. Witness was superintending
the painting of a fen^e. Continuing, he
said:
"Rea came along and said 'Good
morning,' and was passing on. He
probably had gone a few yards when I
followed him and asked him why he
had been circulating lies In regard to
me. He said, 'What do you mean?" I
told him he was stabbing me in the
back among the good citizens of San
Jose and saying that while I was a
Councilman of the city of San Jose I
was crooked and that I received money
on the purchase of a steam rrrller. He
replied that what he said behind my
back he would repeat before my face;
that there was $900 paid on the pur

IN THE NAME OF
THE AMERICANS
Insurgent General MaKabulos Ex

Filipinos Struggle Guns Through Manila in

BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, Sept. 20.â Visiting General
Makabulos, the leader of an insurrec
tion in three provinces â Pampanga,
Zambales and Tarlac â yesterday at his
headquarters at San Fernando, I found
the old rebel greatly disgusted with
the high-handed methods of Aguinaldo.
It is apparent, despite reports to the
contrary, that the "dictator" has not
taken the three provinces into camp.
"Aguinaldo asked me to attend the
Malolos Congress," General Makabulos
said to me. "I did not go. Many
members of his own Cabinet were not
present. Ido not approve his course.
He issued a proclamation to the peo
ple of the three provinces, asserting
that the Americans called for an as
sessment of $80,000 each from Zambales,
Pampanga and Tarlac to pay the war
indemnity, in return for which pay
ment independence would be guaran
teed. I sent out tax gatherers and
had collected $37,000 in Pampanga be
fore I learned what he was doing and
stopped collecting. The Spanish tax
hunters were no worse. I would not
trust myself at Malolos."
General Makabulos has clearly allied
himself to the party opposing the "dic
tator." He spoke in the highest terms
of Pio Pilar, chief of the insurrection
ists at Manila.
At Malolos I saw four new Maxim
machine guns. Several thousand stands
of Mausers, which were recently land
ed at Catangas, were carried across
Laguna de Taal into Bay Lake and
chase of the steam roller and I got $400.
I told him It was an infamous lie and
nobody knew it better than he. He said
that if I was not a cripple he would
whack the head off of me. I told him
there were other ways of fighting. He
replied that I should get a couple of
pistols and take a whack at him."
Jarman testified that Rea further
Baid: "I didn't see the money paid to
you, but I believe you got it." Mrs.
! Goodrich, he said, was present at the
! opening of the altercation, but retired
! when the discussion got a little heated.
Delmas then passed the witness and
Attorney Burchard began his cross-ex
amination, but Jarman stuck closely
to his- original story. Plaintiff said
! he had known Rea for about twenty
eight and their relations in a
business way had been friendly. He
had done some work for defendant.
Had not consulted Rea about political
matters.
During the altercation previously de
scribed witness said he called Ftea a
scoundrel t.nd a knave. At that time
defendant stated that witness had been
out to his home, partaken of his hospi
! tality and had been ungrateful enough
not to programme with him.
Jarman had heard rumors that Coun
cilmen Fay and Molting and Johnnie
Mackenzie had each received $100 to
work for the purchase of the street
roller.
Witness was closely questioned as to
the conversation that took place be
tween himself and Rea. Jarman ad
mitted that he had at one time taken
a trip to San Francisco with Krleg and
Dlttus to break a programme arranged
by Rea. He said the trip was made
in the interest of honest 1 " and harmony,
and he had done what he thought was
for the best Interest of the city.
Jarman had not finished his testi
mony at the hour of adjournment. The
trial will occupy at least a week.
MEMORIAL SERVICES
HELD AT STANFORD
Tributes to Late Professors Mary
Sheldon Barnes and Margaret
M. Wickham.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
20.â Services were held this evening in
memory of Professors Mary Sheldon
Barnes and Margaret M. Wickham, who
died this Rummer. The chapel vra& filled
with students, most of whom had known
and appreciated the worth of both
women. Dr. Jordan spoke briefly of the
work and character of the women who
had been assistant professors here. In
connection with his remarks on Mrs.
Barnes he said that a great deal of the
general kindliness and sweetness about
the university was due to Mrs. Barnes.
Her distinctive traits of character, he
said, were her wonderful hopefulness of
spirit and will power. A letter had been
received, he said, stating that Mrs.
Barnes would he cremated and buried In
Rome, as she belonged to no particular
spot, but was the child of the earth.
Resolutions of respect adopted by the
faculty were read by Dr. Jordan, as well
as a history of Mrs. Barnes by Professor
Griggs.
Dr. Goebel, head of the German depart
ment, with whom Miss Wiskham was
closely associated In the college, spoke of
his former assistant's wonderful gifts as
a teacher and her fine character as a
woman.
Dr. Howard, head of the history depart
ment, drew a word picture of Mrs.
Barnes, who, he declared, deserved a
place second to no other woman of this
country on account of the valuable work
done by her in historical fields, especially
in original source and theory of teach
ing 1 .
Professors Cubberley and Fluget and
Miss Chandler also eulogized the dead
teachers.

Aguinaldo himself gave me every
assurance of his good Intentions, but
he looks worried, being apparently
fearful of his followers. He is now en

By TEXAS FEVER

cautions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 20.-After a
thorough investigation County Veterinary
Surgeon Wise declares that Texas fever is
raging among cattle along the Mojave
River. The numerous deaths among
stock in that region, which have been
noticed for some time, were supposed to
have been for lack of feed, resulting from
the drought. At last J. J. Cuddeback, a
prominent stockman, owing herds about
Soda and Rock Springs, appeared before
the Board of Supervisors and asked for
an investigation.
Wise was sent out and found hundreds
of head dying, their condition being
appalling. The Infected cattle have been
driven up from Foster's ranch, near
Capistrano, San Diego County, owing to
the lack of feed in that district. In stock
known as immunes the dis-^nse is not de
tected. The fever Is causeu by a tick
about the size of the two first joints of
the finger, burrowing into the animal's
flesh.
When the cattle are about to die the
tick drops to the ground and hatches out
myriads of others, which communicate
with the uninfected herds. Immunes
which have had the fever and survived
the action of the tick, are unharmed.
Wise found a large number of herds In
fected. Already about 800 head are dead
and as many more are dying. The only
remedy known is spraying with crude oil.
Strict quarantine has therefore been es
tablished and infected herds will not be
allowed to move from the locality. Some
cattlemen object to the quarantine, as it
interferes with grazing, but the step is
necessary to prevent the further spread of
the dread disease in the county. Notice
has been sent to Capistrano to prevent
the further importation of cattle bearing
the disease.
INSTRUCTIONS AS TO
COALING STATIONS
Porto Rican Commissioners Ordered
to Take Possession of a Site
at Once.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
At the instance of Commander R. B.
Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equip
ment, instructions have been sent to the
American commissioners in Porto Ricn
directing them to take possession as
promptly as possible of any public land
which may be available as a site for a
coaling station. It is recognized by the
officials that it would not be a difficult
matter for any unprincipled persons who
may be on the island to dispose of por
tions of public lands to private indi
viduals, and it might be consequently a
matter of much controversy before the
United States could obtain an unclouded
title.
Commander Bradford also proposes to
call to the attention of the department a
plan which should he followed in estab
lishing a coaling station on the island
of Guam. In the Ladrone group. While
this island has not been ceded to the
United States, its cession will be demand
ed by (he commissioners of the United
States. When it becomes American ter
ritory the colliers which accompany the
battleships to the far East will make a
survey of its harbor and report concerr
ing a coaling station and the point where
the pier shall be constructed.

Special Dispatch to The Calt.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 20.â With
hands and feet securely tied and each
weighted a body was found floating in
the Willamette River at Salem to-day.
The discovery was made by boys In
a rowboat. The Coroner was notified
and he held an inquest on the riv.Â»r
bank opposite Salem this afternoon.
The body was found to have been
wounded by a blunt instrument In the
forehead. There was a stab below the
right jaw and evidence of a hard blow
in the mouth, breaking the upper jaw.
In the pocket was a business card of
"William Gadsby, house furnisher, rep
resented by McGrath, Portland." A
business card of "R. H. Weeks, warm

circular advertisement of the "Peerless
Prune Evaporator" were also found on
the body.
Elmer Herritt, living two miles from
Salem, recognized the weights as those
taken from a patent gate at his farm
on the night of September 9or 10. The
rope with- which the hands and feet
were tied was recognized as belonging
to the same gate. The parties taking
the weights and ropes came in a buggy

SALINAS SENSATION
HAS BEEN EXPLODED
Rumors of Foul Play in Connection
With Maguire's Death Gen
erally Discredited.
SALINAS. Sept. 20.â A1l day the mat
ter of the death of Charles Maguire has
been discussed and from all sources come
denials of foul play. The District At
torney says that only for the delirious
condition of Maguire when he called he
would have had an ante-mortem state
ment. .
The family are highly indignant over
the rumors of foul play and say no state
ment was made by Maguire, as alleged
in the reports that have been current.
The Coroner says that owing to opposi
tion from the family to a post-mortem
and an inquest, and to the fact that the
medical attendant gave a certificate of
death from septic poisoning, there was no
investigation.
The statements of Maguire's parents
and relatives are now credited and tho
rumors of foul play are believed to be
without foundation.

DANGER ON MARKET STREET.
REMOVAL of the basalt blocks and cobbles of
Market street and the substitution of bitumen
is an improvement pleasing to the senses.
Nevertheless it involves a new danger. Time was
when the oncoming truck advertised itself a block in
advance. Now it rolls up insidiously, and the pe
destrian has to be notified by a yell of his peril. The
catastrophe will occur when nobody shall be thought
ful enough to yell.
Drivers cannot be depended upon to give warning.
They go through life cherishing the notion that
streets were made for teams alone, that the foot man
is a trespasser, and that while to make him dodge is
innocent pastime, to run him down is far short of a
crime. From the lofty perch of the driver a peculiar
view is taken. In this view people less elevated fail
to participate.
In former times people utilized the crossings when
they wished to reach the other side of the street.
Now the middle of the block affords as comfortable
a place of transit. Midway between crossings the
drivers urge their horses to achievements of speed,
and there is. no policeman to raise a cautioning fin
ger. Hence the menace multiplies. If there shall be
no accidents the pedestrians have all been born under
lucky stars, and the distribution of these stars is not
believed to have been on such a liberal scale.
As a matter of protection pedestrians should stick
to the crossing. They should also remember that
the ear is no longer to be depended upon to detect ap
proaching vehicles. It becomes necessary to look
both ways at once, and do that which is sometimes
tersely expressed as "keeping the eye peeled."
AN EXPLODED ROORBACK-
PRESIDENT McKIXLEY'S prompt action in
providing for a committee composed of men
of national repute and high standing to inves
tigate the conduct of the war has had the effect of
silencing the wild clamors and reckless charges that
have been made against the administration for al
leged indifference to the welfare of the volunteers.
The people are now aware that the whole truth will
be made known and the full extent of the reported
evils determined by official inquiries. As a result they
are no longer to be moved by the lurid rhetoric of the
yellow journals or the howling oratory of dema
gogues.
Thus early in the campaign has the one national
issue of the fused factions been utterly discredited and
swept away. Even those Democrats and Populists
who were most insistent upon making use of that
charge as a campaign war cry against the administra
tion have now abandoned it and returned to State
issues. The roorback has, in fact, been exploded in
the camp of its manufacturers, and all who hoped to
profit by it have been overthrown and demoralized.
Rarely even in the history of Democracy has there
been a worse case of political trickery and impudence
attempted upon the intelligence of the people than
was this effort to make party capital out of the suf
ferings that befell the volunteers during the past
summer.
The Democratic leaders in Congress and the
greater number of the newspapers of the party began
at the very opening of the crisis that ended in the war
with Spain to clamor for recognition of the indepen
dence of Cuba and an immediate invasion of the
island. It was, therefore, the exercise of something
more than ordinary campaign lying for these same
orators to denounce the administration for the evils
resulting during the campaign, for the lack of equip
ments for a hasty invasion of Cuba, and the early ex
plosion of the lies is only what was to have been ex
pected.
The Assistant United States District Attorney has
resigned, and an evening paper prints the information
that he did so by reason of having been promised a
nomination for Superior Judge. Who made the
promise ? Is it possible there is a slate? Are dele
gates not to be allowed to enter the convention un
trammeled? Heaven forbid.
Owing to the kindly thoughtfulness of an Exam
iner artist, W. J. Magee has been provided with two
arms. The fact that he wears an empty sleeve is too
small a thing to hamper artistic genius when it feels
in mood for flight.
Nobody can blame the soldiers in Hawaii for re
fusing to drill after a breakfast consisting of an onion
and a cup of coffee. There is no famine in Honolulu,
and no sense in starving troops in times of peace.
Perhaps Cervera's reception in Spain will put him
in a mood to return to this country and take out his
first papers.
An interesting feature of the attempt to poison
Aguinaldo Is that it probably never occurred
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1898.
THE MAGUIRE OF RECORD.
THE political course of Judge Maguire has been
so tortuous that it is difficult to find any preju
dice to which he has not pandered, any fad that
he has not favored.
We have frequently drawn upon his record for the
enlightenment of our readers, and they are doubtless
astonished at the chameleon-like changes which it
presents. Let it be understood that we join all fair
minded men in respecting one who chooses to adopt
an unpopular position, led by his convictions of right,
and who abides by it, through evil report and mis
fortune. But Judge Maguire lacks that manly char
acteristic. His politics and convictions belong to the
rule of thumb policy. He has been capable of
adopting views, stating them with extreme rancor,
committing himself to them without reserve, and then
abandoning them without explanation or apology.
Having held office ever since he was 19 years old,
with very slight intermissions, he has subordinated
everything to his life plan of existing on a salary.
No man in California ever excelled his success in this
line. Since he was a voter he has held office more
continuously and drawn a steadier salary than any
other man in the State. And yet during this remark
able career, while he has hotly advocated nearly every
political fad and vagary, and has in turn belonged to
and deserted the Republican, Greenback, Land and
Labor and Democratic parties, he has managed to
pocket nearly $60,000 in salaries since his office
holding career began at 19.
His judgment as to the time to desert a party or a
principle is infallible. His judgment as to the time
to adopt a party, principle or issue is fallible.
We have referred to his contribution to the litera
ture of the Land and Labor party in his book on
'"Ireland and the Pope." After publishing his letter
permanently withdrawing from the Democratic party
because it would not consent to the confiscation of
land, he thought he saw in the Irish land question
and the anti-Pope demonstration started by Henry
George in New Yofk an opportunity to combine
Irish patriotism, land confiscation and anti-Popery all
in one grand movement to control American politics.
He was then self-expatriated from the Democratic
party, and his book was to be a part of the platform
of the new party which he organized, with the expec
tation of electing Henry George to the Presidency in
1888.
We have already quoted from this volume to show
the extreme rancor of spirit in which Judge Maguire
is in the habit of discussing issues which he projects
into politics. We refer to the subject again not to
raise religious prejudice, which we abhor, but to aid
in the revelation of Maguirc's character and methods.
To show how this book was regarded when it ap
peared we quote the following notice from the Mon
itor of June 27, 1888:
'Ireland and the Pope. A Brief History of PapaJ
Intrigue Against Irish Liberty, From Adrian IV to
Leo XIII.' By James G. Maguire, Judge of the Su
perior Court of San Francisco, Cal. Published at
San Francisco by James 11. Barry.
"After a careful perusal of this volume we have
come to the conclusion that it is a bad book, pub
lished through bad motives, and in its results it is
far more likely to recoil disastrously upon the head of
its auttior than it is to have the damaging and de
moralizing effect its author's animosity against the
Vicar of Christ intended. It is an open secret that the
author of this vicious volume is a great admirer of
Dr. McGlynn and Henry George, both of whom he
has already lauded publicly, while at the same time
he has poured the vials of his wrath upon the de
voted head of Leo XIII as their enemy.
"Any book on 'Ireland and the Pope,' emanating
from an author whose mind is a seething caldron of
passion and prejudice combined, must naturally be
looked upon as the result of rancor, and hence it can
possess but little or no value in the esteem of men
who want to read the truth of history, and not the
vaporings of men whose minds are 90 strongly
tainted with vengeance against the Pope that they
cannot permit themselves even to speak courteously
of the pontiffs whom they present to their readers as
the persecutors of the Irish people and as the barriers
which ever have been stumbling-blocks in the way
of Irish independence.
"Had this book been written by an open and
avowed Orangeman, an anti-Catholic Calvinist or
an ex-priest who had turned Presbyterian, its Pope
slandering contents and its many misleading and
malicious statements would not have astonished us
in the least, but being as it is, the work of an author
who was born, baptized and brought up in the Catho
lic church, and whose position on the bench implies
a decent respect for all authority, both civil and
ecclesiastical, then, indeed, our wonder is excited that
James G. Maguire could sully his Catholic soul and
soil the ermine of his high judicial position by placing
his name and official designation upon the title-page
of a book that is beneath criticism as a literary pro
duction, and which can confer no honor upon either
the literary or the judicial reputation of the gentle
man who generated it. We intend to review this
book thoroughly, for the reason that it involves mat
ters upon Mjhich the truth, the whole truth and noth
ing but thl truth should be known. The patriotic
impulses of many Catholic Irishmen very often leave
them liable to have their minds filled with venom
against the Vicar of Christ because of some fancied
wrong (or outrage, as Judge Maguire would call it)
which the Popes are charged with perpetrating in the
past or present against the Irish people; and in order
to avoid such a calamity it is one of the most impor
tant duties of the Monitor to place before its readers
a full, candid and fair contradiction of just such in
sidious falsehoods as the work under review con
tains."
We quote the above in full, in proof of our con
tention that Maguire is incapable of a candid and
truthful discussion of the issues which interest him.
While holding a lucrative office given him by the
Democratic party, he bolted that party in 1886 and
contemptuously deserted and withdrew from it per
manently in 1887. At the same time he bolted his
church and signalized the act by this book of "in
sidious falsehood," "rancor, venom and misrepresen
tation."
But he soon discovered that this bolt from church
and party would not get him an office and satisfy his
desire to live on a salary, and he bolted back without
apology to his party, whatever happened in his
church. In view of his instability of purpose and
rancor of expression this political and religious prodi
gal son is not worth wasting a fatted calf on.
Europe seems to be quite enthusiastic in crying
"Down with the anarchists!" But when they go
down there should be a rope so adjusted as to keep
them from quite reaching the ground.
Nevertheless Aguinaldo will not smile joyously
upon hearing that more American troops are to be
landed in his friendly midst.
Perhaps the sensations caused by resigning under
fire will not strike Alger as being altogether novel.
Perhaps Mrs. Botkin has a notion that the air of
Delaware would not be healthful.
ThJE NEW TAX LEVY.
IN one respect the tax levy passed by the Board of
Supervisors on Monday may be commended â it
might be higher. A cursory reading of the ap
propriations which have been made, even when no
comparison is made with those of previous years, dis
closes to the reader that many expedients have been
resorted to to reduce the levy. In all departments
the flexible allowances have been reduced, but not a
salary has been changed nor an employe dispensed
with. In other words, the reductions have fallen upon
bureaus and departments which should in the interest
of the public be given more money.
The cause of this is not far to seek. Salaries are
fixed by law and may.be drawn in defiance of the
Supervisors, while the appropriations for the Street,
Fire and Police departments and for street lighting
are changed as the exigencies of the city demand and
cannot be exceeded. Under this system all the reduc
tions fall upon departments which ought to be the
last to stand them. There should be an annual ap
propriation for the Street Department of $1,000,000.
That sum of money would no more than pay for
work which should be done immediately upon the
streets and sewers. Yet last year the department re
ceived but $535,000, and this year under an increased
levy it gets but $500,000.
The total tax rate imposed by the order passed on
Monday will be $i 80 on the $100 valuation. Of this
48 cents and 8 mills has been levied by the Board of
Equalization for State purposes, and $1 31 and 8 mills
represents the necessities of the city and county.
There has been an increase of 13 cents over last year
in the municipal rate. The money derived from this
additional levy goes to make up the deficit of 1897-08
and provide for certain improvements which are
deemed necessary- Among these is $75,000 for the
proposed St. Mary's Park and $50,000 for a new City
and County Hospital. Neither of these amounts will
probably be expended during the current year. Ac
cording to the City and County Attorney the hospital
cannot be constructed, the act authorizing it having
lapsed, and it is doubtful whether the land for St.
Mary's Park, even if the park should be actually pro
jected, can be condemned within a year.
The amounts appropriated, however, will go into
the general fund, whence they will in proper time be
duly checked out in salaries by the City Hall em
ployes. In connection with this levy but one hope
can be expressed, namely, that it will not produce a
deficit at the end of the fiscal year. A sufficient sum
of money has been raised to conduct the government,
but it has not been and cannot be properly distributed.
Hence, if a deficit is avoided we can cheerfully put up
with another year of municipal stagnation in every
thing except City Hall salaries.
FORTUNATE SHAREHOLDERS.
SUBSCRIBERS to the stock of the Valley Road
who took advantage of the proposal made to
them a short time ago to contract to give the
Union Trust Company an option of purchasing the
stock at par on or before January i, 1899, have every
reason to be satisfied with the results.
By subscribing for the stock in the first place they
contributed to the attainment of a competing road
through the San Joaquin, and by transferring it they
contribute to the construction of the line which will
provide transcontinental competition. Finally, as
they have disposed of their stock at par, they have
a handsome profit for themselves out of these enter
prises for the general good.
It may be accepted as certain that if the holders
of the stock of the Valley Road â or at least the hold
ers of the greater part of it â had not agreed to the
transfer of their stock, the connecting line between
Bakersfield and Los Angeles could not have been
undertaken at this time.
The region between the two points is compara
tively unsettled, and the road that traverses it will
derive but little business from it for a long time to
come. To render the venture profitable it was ne
cessary that the proposed line should have control of
the Valley Road as well as connections with the
railway system of the southern part of the State. By
the transfer of stock to the Union Trust Company
with an option to purchase it at par this control was
assured, and as a result a company to construct the
connecting line has been incorporated and work will
soon begin.
The whole history of these railway enterprises has
been one of remarkably successful financiering. In
the construction of American railways it has too of
ten happened that the original shareholders have
lost almost the whole of their investment. The very
opposite has occurred in this instance. Many of the
original subscribers to the Valley Road considered
their subscriptions to be contributions to an enter
prise for the welfare of the State, rather than as a
business investment for personal profit. All of these
parties now find themselves able to dispose of the
stock at par, and at the same time and by the same
means provide for an additional railroad to the one
to which they subscribed.
OUR LAGGING WINE INDUSTRY.
F\ CCORDING to statistics given in the Moni
/ \ teur Vinicole, which may be accepted as ap
proximately correct, the wine production of
the world in 1897 was considerably less than that of
the previous year, amounting to 2.843,478,920 gallons,
while that of 1896 was 3,262,103,820 gallons.
The figures given of production in different coun
tries show that France is by far the largest wine pro
ducer among the nations. Her output for 1897, in
cluding that of Algiers, exceeded one-third of the en
tire output of the world. Italy and Spain follow in
the order named, and Roumania comes fourth on the
list. The United States, notwithstanding its vast
area and progressive population, is far behind other
civilized lands in this respect, and ranks as sixteenth,
being outclassed by such countries as Argentine,
Chile, Turkey and Greece, and in fact but little ahead
of Bulgaria and Senna.
The chief cause for our backwardness in wine pro
duction is that the American people as a whole have
not learned the uses of table wines and do not con
sume them to anything like the extent to which other
peoples are accustomed. No civilized government
except our own, and possibly the British, would have
sent its soldiers from a temperate climate to the
tropics of Cuba without supplying them with a plen
tiful provision of wine, so that they would not have
to rely entirely upon the unhealthful waters for drink
ing purposes. If the troops in front of Santiago had
been as well supplied with Californian wine as the
troops of Germany and France are supplied with their
native light wines during campaigns there would have
been less sickness, less lassitude and fewer deaths
among them.
The United States ought to be as far advanced in
wine production as in any other great industry, and
it is not creditable to our intelligence that so many
of our people have not yet learned to use the grape
rightly and to profit by the cultivation of it.
The ship which recently reached Baltimore with a
cargo of burning sulphur must be one of the "float
ing hells" which sailors are wont to speak about
MR. GAGE AND THE RAILROAD,
The Candidate Writes of His Attitude Toward the
Corporation.
The following letter on his attitude toward the Southern Pacific was
written a few days ago by Mr. Gage, Republican candidate for Governor,
to a friend in Los Angeles.
149 North Main street,
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Sept. 16, 189 S.
J. W. Morris, Esq., box 177,L0s Angeles City: If you thoroughly understood the
situation, and I desire that you may do so. you would understand that I made
no changes whatever in .this committee referred to. The committee that made
the gallant fight for McKinley in 1896 from Los Angeles County consisted of me
very same gentlemen complained of in this occasion, viz.: O.sborne, Flint and
Parker. If the gentlemen referred to were good enough to light the battles of
1596 I am quite confident I am not subject to any criticism for having left them
there, to participate in the present contest. Those men were named on the com
mittee because of the fact that they were recommended to me by the man whom
all California has done honor to on account of his noble services in that behalf,
viz., Major Frank McLaughlln of San Francisco.
On Tuesday. November 7, 1876, I first commenced to speak my sentiments
about the Southern Pacific Company, contending that it had no light to go out
side its legitimate sphere and embark upon political enterprises. If you will run
back, you wili see that is over one-flith of a century ago. The speech delivered
on that occasion is to be found in the Los Angeles Daily Star of that date, and I
have been consistent in my sentiments in that behalf ever since that time.
In the case pending before the Supreme Court of the United States in the
October term, 1892. cases Nos. 921-22 and 862-63, entitle "The United States vs.
Southern Pacific Railroad et a 1.," in common with my friend Joseph Call, I
filed a brief in opposition to the petition for rehearing against that company
and in behalf of the settlers of the State of California, contesting the right of
the Southern Pacific Company to hold their land grant; and upon the points
there referred to and advocated several million of acres were turned over to the
public domain.
If any of the complaining friends have any doubts In reference to my atti
tude toward the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, I would most respectfully
refer them to that man who has been the corporation's most distinguished oppo
nent that ever existed, viz., Mr. Joseph Call, whose office is in the Bradbury block
In Los Angeles City.
Mr. Joseph Call is the ablest champion the people ever had as against the en
croachments of the railroads upon the public domain.
Before I ever announced my candidacy the Democratic and Republican pa
pers of this State (notable among which were the Herald of Los Angeles and the
Examiner of San Francisco) asserted that I was not the preference of the South
ern Pacific Company.
Again, within the last three years T have brought suits against those cor
porations, laying damages in the ae-eregate of upward of $10,000, and I have
obtained judgments and collected from them within that period of time nearly
$35,000.
In the convention that nominated me the other day at Sacramento I said:
"I would rather meet honorable defeat than be guilty of any such 'â -actice
and if ever after this political contest is over I return to this beautiful city of"
Sacramento elected as Governor of this State I will walk down your streets
toward the Capitol, there to take my oath as Governor of this State a free man
not dominated by any corporations, not dominated by any individual'
not dominated by anything except the purpose to discharge my duty faithfully
to Democrat, Republican and every human being within the confines of our beau
tiful Stateâ no matter, fellow-citizens, whether that person be a miner living in
the cabin on the mountain side or the aristocrat in the palace in the City We
are bound as a party to do and will do impartial justice to all our fellow-hVines "
These expressions, as you will observe, are all consistent. I meant them all
and no man has just grounds of complaint against me so far as corporate influ
ences are concerned, and no man will make these complaints against me unless
he be a corrupt a id infamous scoundrel himself.
Thanking you for your kindly expressions and thanking you much for calling
my attention to what is going on uptfh the outside, I make these replies to you in
the hope that iney may enable you, as you go around, to answer any charge
which may be attempted to be made in your presence. Yours very respectfully
HEXRY T. GAGE.
COLONEL BURNS AND THE DE YOUNG INTERVIEW.
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 20, ISO!?.
To the Editor of The Call: In this morning's Call appears what purports
to be an interview with myself, in which I am made to assume toward Mr.
de Young an attitude of personal ami political hostility, and am quoted as using
abusive language concerning him and as criticizing him and his political meth
ods. I say that this is not tru<\ I am not In the habit of abusing my friends.
The facts of the alleged interview are these: Yesterday, while passing
through the rooms of the Republican State Central Committee, I was stopped
by two reporters for The Call, who ask#Kl me several questions about political
mattprs. I assumed that the conversation was personal, since I was acquainted
with both gentlemen, and had not been asked for an Interview, and so stated
at the time. The alleged Interview, based upon that conversation, is a com
pound of misstatement and misquotation. Words used by the reporters are
put into my mouth, and I am m.ade to say things I never said or thought.
In so far as The Call's alleged interview puts me In the position of assail
ing or critcizlng Mr. de Young or his political aspirationsâ if, indeed, he has
anyâ it is absolutely untrue and without foundation.
If Colonel Burns in the conversation with reporters to which he refers In
the foregoing ever entertained the idea that the talk was personal and con
fidential, that impression was certainly removed from his mind before the
parties to the interview separated.
After the colonel had been talking for several minutes and speaking
with a fluency and frankness that surprised his hearers, he quickly arrested
the flow of language by an exclamation, "I assume that this is a personal
conversation." He was told then that it was not so understood, but on the
contrary that it was an interview for publication.
Tho inference must be that the colonel apprehended that he had said
more than he intended to say with reference to Mr. de Young's aspirations
for the Senate. It is true that many expressions Colonel Burns did use were
not reported In the Interview. Only the salient points were set forth The
fact may be that he was so enamored of his gifts of speech that he failed to
recollect his sayings. Speaking of the sack as an element in Senatorial as
piration, he tersely did say that he had lived in California since his child
hood and had never seen a great uprising in favor of a candidate for Sen
ator unless there was a great sack in sight. He did say this in connection
with Mr. de Young's hopes, bringing out clearly the assertion that Mr de
Young had no chance of becoming United States Senator unless there
was a great uprising of the people in his behalf. Then the colonel with a
twinkle in his eye, and his face radiant with a campaign smile added "I
never saw one of these great uprisings unless there was a big sack in sight "
The colonel surely "pointed with pride" to two interviews which he had
with M. H. de Young. Indeed, Colonel Burns said: "I told Mr de Young
that his friends were not brave enouh to say to him that his candidacy
for the United States Senate was prejudicial to the Republican partyâ that
the people were not demanding his election, and that he had mistaken the
words of a friendly banker as the voice of the people. At the second
interview Mr. de Young agreed to announce his withdrawal or declina
tion." The colonel in conclusion said: "I do not believe that he is a can
didate, and if he were he could not be elected without spending a large sum
of money in each Assembly district, and money could not be expended with
out my knowledge, even in a county as remote as Siskyou "
After Colonel Burns was informed that the Interview was for publica
tion he continued to talk in a fascinating style. Of the people he said
"You may fool them to-day, but you cannot fool them to-morrow I be'
lieve in doing politics in a frank and open manner. Candidates for the
United States Senate should come out in the open and announce themselves
Ido not blame Mr. de Young for aspiring to the Senatorship I could
name five thousand men who would like the office, but I am not one of them
I believe in honest and open politics. When I go into a campaign I set mv
stake there and fix a line, which I follow. I may not be right in my jude
ment every time, but Ido not conceal my intentions. I do^not expect any
office or any other reward except the final judgment of the peoDle that T
helped to bring about better politics." 7
The idea that the colonel was giving two friends, instead of the general
public, a benefit is absurd on its face. Colonel Burns talked so happily
and so earnestly that his friends on the committee should urge him to
take the stump for the ticket. & LO

yesterday. Gill now wears a red and
green striped vest and Crane has forgot
ten the existence of his six months' boy.
Back of the vest is a story and some
thing else. Both Crane and Gill are
novices when it comes to a horse race,
and persuaded by an old-time sport who
looks like the betting ring: itself they put
all their shekels in one pocket and
started for the park.
Gill thought that Minnie X was a pretty
name, but Crane ridiculed such a selec
tion. He looked at the card and chose
Sport McAllister, and won over his com
panion to the same choice. The horses
went to the post for the three-quarter
mile race. Gill was nervous and Crane
wanted something to steady him. The
horses were well lined and the flag
dropped. Gill tells the story thus:
"Gee, but it was exciting. You see. the
horses were all up and it looked like a
good start. The six other horses went

finished. Our horse moved backward and
forward and round in a circle, but never
toward us in the stand. I thought it was
just my luck and looked for consolation
when the man with a fog horn disguised
his voice and told us that it was a false
start and the race had to be run over

ticularly that portion covering the mak
ing of the better grade of kid gloves. To
be a first-class glove cutter a man has to
spend about three years in learning: the
trade. He must be able to take a skin,
stretch it into shape and thickness. He
then earns from $20 to $30 per week." '
"A first-class candy maker earns $3 per
day; he must be able to mane all the
best grades of candies and confections.
The time it takes him to learn depends
on his intelligence, usually from two to
three years. As a nelper he earns from
$1 to $1 50 per day.
"A firat-class bookbinder is usually in

are (1) to collect and preserve relics, man
uscripts, traditions and mementos of the
founders and builders of the thirteen
original States of the Union, and of the
heroes of the War for Independence, that

American history, particularly among
the young, and to cultivate the spirit of
patriotism and reverence for the found
ers of American constitutional history.
The society has chapters in many of tha

Headquarters, District of Hawaii,
HONOLULU, Sept 6, IS9S.
Special Orders No. 1.
A board of officers will convene at Camp McKinley to-morrow,
Wednesday, September 7, or as soon thereafter as practicable, to inves
tigate the acts of vandalism committed upon the property of China
men, apparently by United States troops, on Sunday, September 4,
and previously. The board will assess the damage; fix, if possible,
the responsibility and make every endeavoT to discover the offend
ers in order that the guilty may be brought to justice and complete
reparation be made.
In the course of its investigation the board is authorized to
change its place of meeting, to visit the scenes of the alleged depre
dations, and is instructed to confer with all officials or persons who
may be able to give reliable aid or information.
Detail of the Board:
Major Robert T. Emmet, First New York Volunteer Infantry.
Captain EL L. Hardin, Eighteenth United States Infantry.
Second Lieutenant Charles C. Crowell, Tenth Pennsylvania Vol
unteer Infantry.
By command of Brigadier General King. '

HONOLULU, Sept. 12.â The forego
ing special order tells, in brief, a story
of numberless annoying depredations
on private property by the small hood
lum element in an otherwise well be
haved body of men. The incident re
ferred to capped the climax, and put an
end to the patience and forbearing dis
position alike of the citizens and the
military authorities. On the Sunday
in question about 100 men from Camp
McKlnley raided the pineapple and ba
nana fields of the Chinese in the ad
jacent Manoa Valley and committed
â¢wholesale depredation and serious
damage. A formal complaint, lodged
with Mr. Sewell and President Dole
on behalf of the Chinese, was imme
diately attended to by Mr. Sewell and
the military authorities, and the
amount of damage is being determined
in a friendly manner. There have been
no further causes given for complaint
on the part of the troops. It Is almost
superfluous to say that an example will
be made of the guilty ones â when they
are discovered.
The "little unpleasantness" between
the civil and military authorities in re
gard to the possession of the barracks
in the Executive building remains in
statu quo and the civil arm of the Gov T
eminent for the present "holds the
fort."
A feeling of relief pervaded the com
munity on the publication of a state
ment forwarded to Hon. Harold M. Se
wall, special agent of the United
States, defining the status of the Ha
waiian Government during its tempor
ary tenure of office. The following
may be given as a brief condensation
of the points at issue determined by
the ruling of the Federal Government:
1. All vacancies In appointive offices to
be filled, as a rule, by the Hawaiian Gov
ernment as heretofore; but an oath of al
legiance to the I'nlted States is required.
2. Local legislation in n Kard to the
public lands of Hawaii remains .n force,
and the land laws of the United States
do not apply to Hawaii.
3. Mr. Dole is to continue to sign as
President of the republic of Hawaii.
4. Processes of court aro to run In the
name of the republic of Hawaii.
.". The use of the word "republic" does
not necessarily Imply an independent
government.
There are many other points upon
which office-holders would like more
definite Instructions, but they prefer
not to anticipate an evil day by asking
too many pertinent questions, calling
forth, perhaps, impertinent answers.
Apparently our Commissioners are
taking life pleasantly enough. They are
bping most hospitably entertained by
the social class, who probably desire
political favors and (ran afford to en
tertain lavishly. The most successful
non-political reception was a luau at
Ainahou, given by Princess Kalulani,
which was attended by the notables of
all nationalities and of all grades of
political opinion. In sociability and
"style" it probably eclipsed anything
before given in Honolulu, even in the
luxurious days of twenty years ago.
But the Commissioners are by no
means idle, for they are being almost
crushed under the weight and volume
of memorials suggesive of the views
of different interests and nationalities
in regard to the character of the gov
ernment we should like to have, unless

WHOLESOME ADVICE.
For People Whose Stomachs Are
Weak and Digestion Poor.
Dr. Harlandson, whose opinion in dis-
eases Is worthy of attention, says when a
man or woman comes to me complaining
of Indigestion. lors of appetite, sour stom-
ach, belching, sour watery-risings, head-
aches, sleeplespnr-ss, lack of ambition and
a general rundown nervous condition, I
advise them to take after each meal one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, al-
lowing the tablets to dissolve In the
mouth and thus mingle with the food
eaten. The result is that the food Is
speedily digested before It has time to
sour and ferment. TheÂ«;e tablets will di-
gest food anyway, whether the stomach
wants to or not, because they contain
harmless digestive prin< Iplpg, vegetable
essences, pepsin and Golden Seal, which
Ftjpply Just what the weak stomach
laclts.
I have advlaed the tablets with great
puccess, both in curing Indigestion and to
build up the tissues, increase flesh In thin
nervous patients, whose real trouble was
dyspepsia, and as soon as thp stomach
was put to rights they did not know what
â¢ sickness was.
A 50-cent package of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets can be bought at any drug
ptore, and as they are not a secret patent
medicine they can be used as often as de-
fired with full assurance that they con-
tain nothing harmful In the slightest de-
%gree; on the contrary, any one whose
"stomach is at all deranged will find great
benefit from the use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets. They will cure any form of
etomach weakness or disease except can-
cer of the stomach. Full size package at
druggists 50c or $1, or by mall from Stu-
art Co., Marshall, Mich.
that form has already been decided
for Ã¼b.
The bar sent a memorial, in response
to an invitation from the Commission,
as follows:
That it Is the sense of the Hawaiian !
Bar that the judicial system of Hawaii i
should be continued as nearly as possible [
as It exists at present without any unnec- |
essary change, and we recommend:
Firstâ That the Supreme Court of Ha
waii shall continue to be a court of last
resort, excepting only as to such matters
as may be within the jurisdiction of a
Federal Court.
Secondâ That a Federal Court be estab
lished in Hawaii, with the same jurisdic
tion as that exercised by Federal Courts
in the several States.
Thirdâ That the present system of a
purely appellate Supreme Court and Cir
cuit Courts for each island, and District
Courts for each district be preserved.
Fourthâ That the Judges of all courts
of record In the Territory other than the
Federal Judge be appointed by the Gover
nor of Hawaii, by and with the advice i
and consent of the Senate of Hawaii, to
hold office according to the present ten
ures, and to receive such compensation
from the revenues of the Territory as
may be appropriated by the Territorial
Legislature.
The Chinese have followed their pre
vious memorial with an able argument
from the pen of Hon. Lorrin A. Thurs
ton, ex-Minister to Washington, on be
half of the rice planting interest. In
this he shows that unless favorable leg
islation be granted, enabling Chinese
laborers to be imported exclusively for
labor in the rice fields, this industry
will perish. It has been proved by the
actual experience of many years that
the Hawaiian, Portuguese and Japan
ese cannot successfully cultivate rice,
nor can they reclaim the swampy mo
rass lands and turn them into profita
ble rice fields as do the Chinese. There
are now under cultivation in the is- I
lands about 10,000 acres in rice, yield
ing from the lands leased an income of
over $200,000 annually to the white and !
Hawaiian landlords, and producing an
average crop of 20,000 tons of the value
of $2,000,000. About 15,000 tons are re
quired for home consumption and the
balance Is exported. The profits from
this industry are widely distributed
among all classes and not alone among
the Chinese. To cramp this industry
would practically mean the return to
barrenness of nearly all the land under
cultivation and a considerable resulting
loss, not only to the community at
large but also to the revenues of the
country. The number of Chinese la
borers engaged in rice cultivation
ranges from three thousand to five
thousand a year, according to the
times of planting and harvesting.
The Hawaiian friends of the Chi
nese have also presented a numerously
signed memorial which is so unique
that It is given in full, as showing the
aloha existing between the races:
Whereas, The prohibitory laws of the
Lnltecl States against Chinese Immigra
tion and the decisions thereon by the Su
preme Court of the United States and by
the Secretary of the Treasury and the
promulgated opinions of the Attorney
General originated from the fact that
such Immigration affected or threatened
to affect the interests of the United States
and endanger the good order of certain
localities thereof; and whereas, such con- !
ditions have not obtained in Hawaii i;or !
are likely to do so. In fact, on the con- i
trary, the immigration of Chinese into j
Hawaii has proven beneficial to the coun- I
try and its continuation is essential to the i
welfare of the islands;
Therefore, We the undersigned, hereby
suggest lor your consideration that the
proposal for a new form of government
shall embody suggestions for a liberal
Chinese immigration law, permitting a*l
the Chinese residents now entitled by law
"to the right of a return permit a contin
uance of that right; also that Chinese
merchants and travelers may be per
mitted to visit Hawaii for a period not to
exceed six months, good bonds being filed i
to warrant their leaving at the end of that !
time; also that Chinese laborers may oe
permltu-d to sojourn In Hawaii for a
period not to exceed three years, good
bonds being filed to guarantee their de
parture; also that Chinese women and |
minors under 10 years of age who have
relatives by blood or marriage residing in
Hawaii be permitted to come to this coun
try.
And for this we will ever pray.
The Portuguese this morning pre
sented their memorial as representing
16,000 persons, nearly one-half of whom
were born in the islands. They state
that since 1887 they have enjoyed the
privilege of the franchise without be
coming citizens, and that they are will-
Ing to become American citizens if the
franchise is accorded to them. They
believe that the retention of the prin
ciples of 1887 would prevent Asiatics
from voting. They claim for them
selves the merit of having aided in ob
taining good government and of striv
ing to uphold American principles, and,
further, of having among their race the
largest number of small holdings in
the islands, thereby increasing the
number of good and independent citi
zens. They object to the poll tax as
an outrage to any civilized community
and claim that the poor are unjustly
taxed in comparison with the wealth
ier classes, and that they cannot com
pete with Asiatic labor and support
their families as a civilized commun
ity. They wish the BUgar planters and
the country to adopt a different sys
tem of labor from that of contract;
profit sharing being preferable, they
claiming this to have proved success
ful both to the owner and the laborer.
They ask that large areas of unfilled
lands held by large corporations and
wealthy land owners be taxed equlta
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1898.
bly, so as to compel their division and
sale for the benefit of small owners.
However, the bonne bouche, after all,
is the planters' memorial, and it has
fallen like a thunderbolt from the clear
sky upon the heads of those who sus
pected that the planters would en
deavor to destroy popular government
by secret machinations in Congress, but
would hardly dare come forth in an
open, straightforward and manly way
and throw down the gauntlet in the
public prints, so that there should be
no mistake as to their wishes to pro
tect their millions wrung from the soil
and the sweat of their laborers' brows.
The memorial is so lengthy that only
its salient points can be given here.
They understand that only two forms
of government are under consideration,
that of the District of Columbia sys
tem and that of the territorial forms
of Arizona and New Mexico, with a
Governor appointed by the President
and subordinate offices filled locally
and a Territorial Legislature for local
legislation.
They strenuously oppose a govern
ment by commission, like that of the
District of Columbia, and cite urgent
reasons in support of their contention.
They understand that there are some
citizens who favor a government by
commission for a few years in order to
"eliminate the bitterness of feeling
which has grown out of the transition
of Hawaii from a monarchy to a Ter
ritory of the United States, by prevent
ing elections and the consequent proba
ble continuity of present party differ
ences which have in the past and prob
ably will for some time to come divide
along race lines and embrace on the
one side those who have favored, and
on the other those who have opposed
a monarchial form of government."
They oppose even temporary govern
ment by commission, as it would tend
to make the people less capable of
eventual self-government.
The memorial asks, therefore, for a
"territorial government, which may in
volve as wide a degree of local control
as the safety of the general govern
ment and local interests will allow,"
and while the chief executive shall be
appointed by the President, he must be
a bona fide resident of the country,
holding property interests therein, and
all subordinate officers should possess
like qualifications. The planters quote
the platforms of the Republican,
Democratic and People's party at their
national conventions of 1896 in support
of these views. In the same spirit they
ask that all Federal officers be bona
fide residents of the Territory;
As to the election franchise, they
"believe that it would be unwise to im
mediately grant full and unrestricted
suffrage either in the interests of the
general government or the local com
munity, or of republican government."
They give these reasons: "That a
large portion of those heretofore eli
gible to the electorate have been and
are hostile to a republican form of gov
ernment â and for some time to come
there is every probability that the
I guiding principle of their action will be
| to hamper and obstruct the evolution of
i responsible representative government
rather than to assist therein"; and
again: "A large proportion of those
heretofore eligible to the electorate are
unaccustomed, either by race instincts
or personal participation, to self-gov
ernment, except in the most limited
degree." They conclude this branch of
the subject by asking for the retention
of the property qualification for Sena
torial voters.
(They support the retention of the
present judicial system and ask for
appointive Judges, believing that if
they are made elective it would be dis
astrous to the public interests. They
I ask that Hawaiian and mixed juries
be abolished as tending to perpetuate
race differences, and that the system
of nine to three in civil and criminal
jury cases be retained, after a success
ful experience of fifty years.
They contend that the labor supply
most Vitally affects not only the con
tinued prosperity of Hawaii, but the
very existence of its leading industries.
The penal contract system was intro
duced as a matter of necessity to se
cure laborers, and was derived from
the American shipping contracts In the
early whaling days. They show that
between 1878 and ISSB the Hawaiian
Government expended $1,019,000, and
the planters $1,000,000, in the importa
tion of labor from abroad, as it could
not be obtained in the country, and
that from the latter date from 3000 to
5000 laborers had been annually im
ported, principally at the expense of
the employers of labor. To secure the
planters from loss the penal contract
! system was adopted on the lines of the
American shipping contract, and has
become incorporated into the Hawaiian
system, but it is falling into disuse, ex
cept to secure advances made to newly
Imported immigrants. Out of 35,000 la
borers there are only 10,000 under con
tract, and these contracts were almost
exclusively made abroad. They do not
ask that the system be perpetuated.
They say: "Contrary to usual com
ment and understanding in the United
States, the average cost of labor in Ha
waii does not vary much from the
average cost of similar labor in the
United States. The average cost of or
dinary field labor in Hawaii, counting
in the lodgings, medical attendance,
wood, water and land for cultivation,
almost universally furnished to the la
borers, does not in any case fall be
low $16 a month, in most cases comes
to as high as $18 a month and ranges
upward to $20 and even more a
month."
They then claim that new plantations
will require at least 5000 more laborers
â¢and the coffee industry "many thou
sands more," and "either these labor
ers must be obtained from beyond the
borders of Hawaii or the development
of the country will be checked and ex
isting industries hampered, if not ex
tinguished." It will be a long time
before a white American farming pop
ulation can be obtained, and it is an
! open question whether "American la
borers will be content to accept the
wages which the Hawaiian agricul
tural industries can afford to pay;
meanwhile the necessities for labor are
immediate and pressing and not less
than 7000 more laborers are required.
They conclude their memorial by ask
ing that "a transition period be al
lowed, during which the agricultural
interests of Hawaii may readjust them
selves to make the changed condition
! of affairs, during which time the full
immigration laws of the United States
shall not be extended in their entirety
to Hawaii. If American laborers can
| be induced to come to the Hawaiian Is
lands and work for wages which will !
leave a margin of profit to the em- j
ployer, we will be the first to welcome
such laborers and such a solution of
the problem."
The Chamber of Commerce of Hono
lulu has presented a memorial, Hon.
J. B. Atherton, president of the Hawai
ian Sugar Planters' Association being
also president of the Chamber of Com
merce. The chamber recommends for
the best interests of the country "a
territorial government based on the
form of the present Western Territor
ies of the United States, with only such
modifications or changes in the pres
ent Hawaiian laws as may be required
by the constitution of the United
States, or be otherwise necessary to
properly adapt them to the American
system of government." They recom
mend the retention of the present Ha
waiian judicial, financial, police and
other conditions, and assert that "as a
matter of general principle, it will be
sound to make no changes In our local
laws unless some specific benefit is to
be obtained thereby or there are other
strong reasons for so doing." They de
vote considerable space to shipping
matters and give cogent reasons in
support of their request to delay the
extension of the United States coast
ing laws to Hawaii, at least for the
present, and until such time as Amer
ican shipping is available to transact
such business.

COMPLAINT FROM
THE NEW YORKERS
Dislike Their Camp at
Honolulu.
SAY THEY ARE NOT WELL FED
FREQUENTLY DRILL WHILE
HUNGRY.
Their Tents Pitched on a Lava Bed,
the Dust From Which Invades
Every Nook and Crevice,
Despite Precautions.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
CAMP McKINLEY, Honolulu, H. 1.,
Sept. 12. â On the evening of September
3, for the first time since July 29, when
Colonel Barber, with Lieutenants Win
throp and Griffith, sailed for Honolulu
on the St. Paul, the First Infantry,
New York Volunteers, officers and men
were united. On that Saturday morn
ing at 8:30 the Bcandia, bearing the
last of the four detachments, into
which the regiment was divided for
transportation, reached port after a
pleasant voyage and tied up at the
wharf. The baggage and mail were
unloaded and in the middle of the af
terr.con the troops took up the du3ty
line of march for Kapiolani Park.
Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole was in
command, with Major Scott, Major
Emmett and Companies A, B and D.
They arrived in camp so late that it
wes dark long before tents were up
and much dissatisfaction was expressed
by the men at having little or ao sup
per served. Many visited the neigh
boring companies and either asked for
supper or used the kitchen outlit lor
preparing their own.
.We are settled at last and can take
note of our surroundings. Our camp
is at the foot of Diamond Head, a slop
ing plain cut by numerous little gul
lies of from three to ten feet in depth,
some of which are bridged over within
the encampment. Covering the sur
face of the ground is broken lava in
some places, but for the most part a
couple of inches of very light volcanic
dust. The particles of it fill the air
at all times. Companies marching out
to drill stir up great clouds of it.
Everything Is covered with the dust;
it sifts into every crevice. The occu
pants of some of the tents have spent
much labor in sweeping clear the space
fronting their tents, sprinkling it and
packing the earth down continually.
This does much toward doing away
with dust, but is quite useless unless
the whole camp is systematically po
liced in this way. The ground inside
the tents, too, is treated in this same
way in a constant endeavor to do away
with an ever-present discomforting fea
ture of camp life here. Some inge
nious men have constructed bunks and
hammocks in the trees which stud the
encampment and find their sleeping
quarters more comfortable than the
hot, crowded tents.
The food question Is an important
and aggravating one here. It is ad
mitted by all that at no place since we
came out May 1 has the food .been so
Insufficient. Last wpt-k one company
of our regiment refused to drill, com
plaining that they were insufficiently
fed and unfit for the labor of drilling.
There are kicks and kicks made to
commanding officers as to the quantity
and quality of the rations served. And
the depot commissary is blamed, and
refutes all the accusations through the
daily press here, and, moreover, lays
the blame at the doors of the compa
nies themselves. And while boards of
investigation are being appointed and
getting to work investigating, the men
are hungering. But better times are
promised, and even within a week im
provement is to be noticed.
The conditions outlined here, It may
be imagined, have made the men â well,
not quite discontented â but somewhat
doleful, homesick. All were eager to
see Hawaiian service while war was in
progress. But now that merely the
conditions of peace are unsettled, there
is a growing feeling that duty Is at
home and at business. There is to be
no outlet for martial valor, and no pa
triotism remains with a volunteer army
at peace. We are everything but sol
diers by trade and profession, and anx
ious to be back to duty and home.
There is even envy for the fcpnth
California, which is reported about to
be mustered out. At the Presidio we
were envied by them.
This picture of the feeling among the
enlisted men is as black as it can pos
sibly be painted. It can be relieved by
a bit of softer color. I strongly suspect
that the failure of the paymaster to
materialize on the Ist of the month
accounts even more largely than the
AD VEBTISEMENI S.
WORKING WOMEN WHO SUFFER
Should Get Mrs. Pinkham's Adviceâ The Whole Truth can be Told
to her Because she is a Woman.
The suffering and pain endured by some working women Is almost past belief.
/ Here is a letter from one of the multitude of women who have been restored
to health and usefulness by Mrs. Pinkham's advice and medicine:

men themselves suspect for their feel
ing of unrest and discouragement.
They are not "hard up," but "busted"â
that's the plain truth. We are five
miles from town, and the carfare there
and return is 20 cents, so that the men
are thrown on their own resources and
are compelled to remain in camp. They
have been used to the freedom of San
Francisco, with its myriad attractions,
and the contrast is disagreeable. Most
of the men, I know, are practically pen
niless, and to be so in what is practi
cally a foreign country is, to say the
least, tantalizing. But conditions are
bound to improve; they are im
proving. August pay is expected
in a week's time. Its arrival
will make all the difference in the
world. Company E has started a com
pany canteen, supported by the com
pany fund. Each man is given a ticket,
to be paid for on the arrival of his pay,
good for $1 in trade at the canteen,
where tobacco, pies, soft drinks, con-
densed milk, etc., are sold at less than
usual retail rates. It is the general
verdict in the company street that it is
the best institution they have yet or
ganized. All have the privilege of
bathing at Waikiki, with its fine sandy
beach and delightfully warm water.
And the necessity in this warm climate
of bathing is turned into our chief
pastime, many going in twice a day
and remaining several hours at a time.
Brown canvas suits have been issued,
so that, although neatness In a blue
uniform would be out of the question,
the brown can be used for loafing about
in camp and for drilling and the blue
saved for dress. Canvas uniforms, too,
are very cool and durable, which is an
important consideration in making the
many excursions through thickets and
jungles and over rocks and mountains
which the men are accustomed, to make
while off duty. Sunday is practically
a holiday, as there is no duty from
reveille to retreat calls. And during
that interval few are found in camp.
Large watering carts are now driven
through the camp at frequent intervals
through the day, tending thereby very
materially to solve the dust question.
On September 4 an important order
was issued by command of Major Gen
eral Merriam, constituting a military
district of all the Hawaiian territory,
with headquarters at Honolulu and
with General Charles King in com
mand. All troops present, numbering
nearly 3000 officers and men, were con
solidated for administration into two
camps â one, Camp McKinley, un
der command of Colonel Thomas H.
Barber, comprising the First Infantry,
New York Volunteers, and the battalion
of Second United States Volunteer En
gineers, commanded by Major Lang
fitt; the other, called Camp otis, being
made up of all expeditionary forces
here, the commanding officer being the
senior officer of those forces present.
This leaves Colonel Barber, the First
New York and the Volunteer Engineers
still the permanent garrison of the mili
tary post which they came out to
establish, and which it seems as
though they were to maintain. General
Merriam returns to-day to San Fran
cisco by the Australia, and undoubt
edly his experience and observations
here will be the foundation for sugges
tions and reports to Washington which
will materialize here in "orders" in two
weeks' time, more or less.
JUDGE ANTONE ROSA
SUCCUMBS TO DROPSY
HONOLULU, Sept. 13.â Antone Rosa,
the well-known Hawaiian lawyer, ex-
Attorney General and ex-Circuit
Judge, died on the 9th, of dropsy, be
ing within a few weeks of his forty
third year. He has been seriously ill
for some time past and his death was
not unexpected. He leaves a widow and
three small children, and a brother,
George Rosa, now in the Auditor Gen
eral's office.
Princess Kaiulani's reception In
honor of the American-Hawaiian Com
mission party given at Ainahau on thp
7th, was a brilliant success. General
Merriam and staff, Admiral Miller and
staff, General King and staff, Colonel
Barber and staff, Government offi
cials, army and navy officers, ex-Queen
Liliuokalani and several hundred
prominent society people of the city
attended.
The United States troopship Arizona
sailed for Manila at 5 o'clock last even

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â The stock market to
day presented all the characteristics of genuine
reaction. Last week's sharp recovery elimi
nated the short Interests very largely and the
forced liquidation for profits had been mostly
completed during the previous decline. The
market was thus freed to a great extent from
technical Influences and in condition to re
spond to the prospects for general business in
the country. Its failure to do so yesterday was
attributed to the unsettling Influences of the
slump In Sugar. The bears were timid about
continuing their campaign further against
Â£ugar and were Inclined to cover, so that thia
Influence toward reaction was removed. Never
theless, the market drooped heavily toward a
lower basis with one or two exceptions In the
list and closed only barely steady at a level
generally of 1 per cent or more below last
night's close. The action of the market waa
not different in character from that which
prevails at a time when the business outlook
presents general discouragements, contraction
of activity on declining profits. The demand
for stocks was very small all day and prices
went down easily under comparatively light
offerings. Weakness was particularly mani
fest In Tobacco, the grangers and Pacifies.
The action of these stocks indicated the liqui
dation of a heavy Individual speculation on
the long side. The sharpest break In the
market was coincident of the marking up of
call loans to 6 per cent. This flurry in the
money market was a disappointment to the bull
operators, and especially in view of the en
gagement of over $2,0<>0,0G0 for import and the
mailing from the Treasury Department of
checks for interest on registered 4 per cent
bonds due October 1, amounting to J4, 910,000,
which are payable immediately. The sub
treasury's debit balance at the clearing-house
also ran up to-day to $1,261,458, reflecting a
large increase in Government expenditures.
The sluggishness of the gold movement is
somewhat remarkable in face of conditions.
Call money In London Is % per cent against 6
per cent here to-day. London discount is 1%,
to 1"* against 4 per cent here. Last month's
trade balance in this country's favor was
$35,w0,000 on top of the favorable balance for
every month in the preceding year. In ad
dition London has recently bought securities
in this market. It is a fact that part of to
day's gold engagements were made by bullion
dealers here who are shipping silver in re
sponse to the active demand attributed to
Spanish account. There is not sufficient de
mand for the exchange against the silver ship
ment to make a market and there is a better
profit in importing gold. Exchange is thus
clearly demonstrated to be at the gold import
point and the question arises what has been
done with the country's credits abroad that
they do not bring a larger gold movement.
The immediate future of the local money mar
ket Is, however, clearly toward greater ease.
Dealings in bonds were not on a large scale
to-day arid prices were toward a lower level.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets opened steady here to-day, but cloeed
generally dull on the unexpectedly large efflux
of gold from the Bank of. England. Americans
were good at one time on German orders to
buy Erie, Union Pacific and Northern Pacific
common. The other markets hardened sympa
thetically, but there was no public support
here and the close was dull in the absence of
New York buying. A small feature is the re
vival of speculation in nitrate shares.
Spanish fours were firm on Paris buying and
Spanish exchange In London fell sharply to
39 80, against 40 v SB at the opening of the
month. Upon information from an excellent
quarter the negotiations with the Hongkong
Bank and Chinese Government for railway
loam arÂ»> proceeding most satisfactorily for
British Interests.
Consols were lower on the gold movement
and on the confirmed report that the Bank of
England is seeking to get control of the money
market by borrowing on consols. This point,
if true, will be most important, but cannot ex
press a definite opinion at the time of cabling- I
The total efflux of gold from the Bank to
day makes f742.000. which, the official state- |
ment shows, Included Â£397.000 In bar gold and i
Â£215.000 in United States coin. All is said to
be going to New York, l>ut I have reason to
believe that a portion of the bar gold has gone
to Germany. \

â  " â  . â - .x â 
CHICAGO, Sept. 20.â A surprise was given
traders in wheat at the outset by the big drop
ping off in receipts in the Northwest, Minne
apolis and Duluth reporting but 820 cars, com
pared with 1993 yesterday and 1924 a year ago.
To.' add. to the natural bullish effect* of these
figures, . Liverpool cables were firm and higher
and there was quite a good demand . to cover
foreign acceptances. December started with
plenty of buyers at 62%fj62%e. against yester
day's closing price of 62% c, and inside of half
an hour the demand had advanced the price to
62% c. September, :in the meantime, showed
even -more strength, than the later delivery,
opening ViH?%c higher at 65@C5V4c, and advanc
ing Ito 65% a;. At 62% c . for \ December the ad
vance was checked. That . price was close to
"call" figures and quite a good \ deal of selling
by holders of those privileges ensued, resulting In
a slight reaction. A period of dullness ensued,
with prices varying but little until about noon,
when the Atlantic . port clearance figures were
posted, showing the surprisingly large , total ; of
977,000 bushels, of which New York contributed
606,000 bushels. As yesterday's visible* supply
statement gave stocks at New York only 188,000
bushels, to-day's big shipments were entirely
unlocked for and a buying flurry ensued imme
diately, I December advancing to 63c and Sep
tember to 66% c, with the demand . quite gen
eral. Bradetreet's figures on the world's visi
ble, showing an increase of "3,692,000 bushels,
encouraged sellers again and caused prices to
drop a little, December getting back to 62% c,
but near the close the strength shown . by out
side - markets, especially for the cash article,
started buying again and the market from that
time on ruled very firm. December was finally
bid to 63H@63%c and closed at 63% c, l%c higher
than - yesterday. September > advanced to 66% c
and closed at 66% c, l%c: higher than yesterday.
Corn was very slow but strong, the main in
fluence v being . the strength of â  wheat. ' â¢ Cables
were firm and foreign houses took a good many
scattered lots. Clearances were liberal, 304,000
bushels. Receipts were 913 cars. September
closed %c higher than yesterday. -
Oats were dull. Only a small scalping busi
ness . was done,' and prices, â¢ until â  late in the
session, showed scarcely any variation. May
closed at about yesterday's price.. '
Provisions : started weak. , Hog receipts were
liberal and there were the â : usual yellow fever
reports. The selling .; pressure was not heavy,
however, 'â * and moderate â¢ buying by packers
caused prices to harden ; later. December pork
closed â¢ 2%c : higher; December lard, 2%c higher
at $4 77% c; January ribs, 2%c higher.

CALIFORNIA RAISINS.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The present situation in Califor
nia raisins does not seem to be at all satisfac
tory to commission merchants in the East.
Accepting prices and terms made by the Cali
fornia Raisin-Growers' Association they have
gone ahead and sold freely for September ship
ment, and In a very short time we understand
all that Is available for September shipment
had been contracted for. Then sellers in the
Eastern market solicited and obtained orders
for the first half of the October shipment, but
before many of these orders were confirmed
notice was sent out by the association that the
time for shipments at the opening prices had
been extended to midnight, October 89 only, af
ter which it was probable that an advance of
He per pound would be made by the associa
tion, and all goods shiped after that date would
be subject to Increased price. Sellers are in
doubt as to whether the increased prices will
apply to goods that were ordered before October
8, arid which could not be shipped on or before
that date or only to orders for the October
shipment that might be received on the Bth of
thnt month or thereafter. If first, merchants
here claim unjust advantage will be taken by
the association in putting higher price on or
ders that wpre received, could not be con
firmed, before the time at which the new prices
would go Into effect. A good deal of telegraph
ing to the coast was done to-day, we under
stand, with a view to ascertaining Just what
sellers here are to expect, but.up to the close
nothing definite seemed to have been obtained.
Many of the local commission merchants seem
to think thnt they have not been well treated
by the association, and some of them go so
far as to intimate that If the present course
of that organization Is persisted In, Its Influ
ence may soon be lost.

Sixth Warders.
NO POLITICS IN JUDAISM
WAy MARCTJSE REPLIES TO DR.
FRIEDLANDER.
Joseph Harris Says That the Sixth
Ward Club Is Working Solely
for Good Govern
ment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 20.
Several prominent members of the Jew-.
Ish faith are incensed at a statement
made to-day by Dr. Friedlander regard-
Ing the Forty-eighth Assembly district
Good Government club. 'xhis club was
formed a few weeks ago for the purpose
of promoting good government and re
moving certain complaints that had been
made regarding that portion of the local
Hebrews who reside in the Sixth Ward.
Rabbi Friedlander said:
A poHticai club consisting of Jews for Jewish
interests If not the sense ut the Jewish commu
nity of OaJUand. nut the sense of the Jewish
fraternity at larsj.-. It Is not sanctioned by
Jewism. Fvery Jew in this country enjoys
equal rights In Identifying and amalgamating
hIF political influence and interests wfth the
rest of the American citizens, Irrespective
of creed, and while the intention of the people
composing the club Is not questioned, the i in
side world may misconstrue it and bring upon
the Jew the undeserved criticism of clannish-
ness. . .'
The First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland,
which is substantially the Jewish community
of the city, discountenances any political or
ganization, composed distinctively of Jews, for
Jewish political interests.-
V li ire the Jewish sentiment, I appeal to the
Forty-eighth Assembly District Club-to disband
mid continue manifesting the same 'confidence
In the sense of fairness of those leaders and
citizens of the country. State and county, who
thus far have been recognizing and distributing
political distinctions to those who merit -them.
Joseph Harris, who was a candidate for
the Assembly, and who is a member of
the club, says Dr. Friedlander is entirely
at sea regarding the purpose ior which
the club was formod. "In the Sixth
Ward." said Mr. Harris, "there ts a large
number of the poorer classes of Jews. It

The crew of the schooner Martha W.
FOUND A FRIEND IN NEED.
The Martha W, Tuft From Petedland With Mahogany Logs Ran Short of Provisions on the Way
Here. The Bark B, P. Cheney From the Canneries Met Her Off Point Reyes and
Gave Her a 'Supply of Canned Salmon.
Tuft had a very hrmi time at It on the
way here from Petedland Ray, a small
place, about 110 mil* io of Aca
pulco. The provlsioi â¢ â  gave oirf and
for days sill th^re was to eat was a small
portion at bread madi from Hour and

from the canneries, v... , ; . â¢ H jth outside
and a supply of canned salmon was pro
cured.
The Tuft left hore over four months ago
for ports in Mexico. She was nupposed
to have had at least four months' provi
elons aboard, but the men Â«ay she did
not have sufficient food for three. Before
leaving Petedland Bay the rook says he
told Captain Johnson that there was not
enough provisions aboard to last to ban
Francisco.
The captain could get nothing in the
shape of food at that out-of-the-way
place, so when his cargo of mahogany
logs was aboard he had to start with the
larder depleted. The canned meats were
the first to give out and then the beans i
followed suit. The men, declare they were |
has been common talk for years that they
could always be herded at election time
and their votes obtained at prices vary
ing from 50 cents to a dollar. These re
ports have become irksome, and in order
to rÂ« move them and prove that the Jews
In that ward are as independent politi
cally as any other class of citizens, they
formed a good government club. The
organization is not. as the Rabbi pre-
Bumes, for the purpose of furthering Jew
ish Interests politically, but for a much
morn worthy cause, and I do not think
the members will disband merely because
Dr - Friedlander suggests it."
Max Marcuse, a prominent Hebrew,
says, that Dr. Friedfander had better
have kept quiet. "I do not see why he
should have rushed into print," said Max
Marcuse, "before he knew what he was
talking about. On several occasions Dr.
rriedlander has opened his mouth and
put his foot Into it, and this time is one
of the occasions. In the Sixth Ward,
where the club was formed, there is quite
a number of Russian Jews, and they are
anxious to disprove certain rumors cir
culated regarding them, and Dr. Fried
lander, who Is not the rabbi or that con
gTegation, would probably have done bet
ter had he encouraged them Instead of
speaking as he has done."
Mrs. Simons Sues for Divorce.
OAKLAND, Sept. 20.â Nancy B. Simons,
daughter of M. C. Culver, who a year ago
married Ernest G. Simons, a popular
young Alamedan, is now suing for divorce
on the ground of desertion. Last July a
divorce complaint was filed by Attorney
R. B. Tappan on behalf of Mrs. Simons,
but when it developed that the attorney
was representing both sides Hugh Aldrich
Was substituted as counsel for the wife,
and on August 15 the case was dismissed.
To-day, however, a bona-fide suit was
filed by Attorney Aidrich, while it is ex
pected that Tappan will represent the
defense. Mrs. Simons sues for $250 month
ly alimony and $250 counsel fees, besides
the divorce. The case promises to be an
interesting one.
She Wants to Be a Citizen.
OAKLAND, Sept. 20.â Miss Ethel L.
Cumbers, a native of England and resid
ing in San Francisco, appeared before
Judge Ogden to-day and declared her in
tention of becoming a citizen. The young
lady, in her endeavors to secure a posi
tion in the civil service, ran up against
the statutory requirement which provides
that all holders of Federal positions must
be citizens of the United States. She has
a promise of a position, and hence the ap
plication.
Contest Over Louis' Will.
OAKLAND, Sejjjt. 20.â Judge Hall will
hear the contest t%Jthe probate of the will
of Edouard Louis, which was filed many
months ago. A lury was impaneled this

It is alleged by two of the heirs that un

OAKLAND, Sept. 20.â At the Inquest

that deceased had beon properly treated

Barker Will Go to England.
OAKLAND, Sept. 20.â W. F. Barker,

was recently mentioned in The Call, ex
pects to start for England in a few days
to pottle matters connected with said
estate.

tain Johnson insists that everybody had
plenty to eat. The cook says his job was
a sinecure from that time on, as all he
had to do was to make a dough out of
flour and water and bake it on the frying
pan.
It took the Tuft 55 days to get here, and
when thjfe Cheney sent the canned salmon
aboard the crew had a feast. When Quar
antine Officer Hill got aboard the crew
was still hard at work eating canned sai
mon and said it tasted "mighty good."
The men assert that they were half
starved on the run up the coast, and the
captain says they were not. The appear
ance of the sailors would seem to bear out
the captain's statement. They are all hale
and hearty, and if they were luUf-starved
they don't show It.

THE WIDOW
NOW REFUSES
TO MARRY
Mrs. Flaherty Is- Sued
by Her Lover.
WANTS THE PRESENTS BACK
PREFERS A SURE PENSION TO A
HUSBAND.
Lover Gregg Believes He Should Be
Given the Value of His
Services and
Loans.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 20.
Mrs. Mary Flaherty, who has frequently
been a party to suits In the Police Court,
has been toying, so he says, with the
heart of John Gregg, a laborer of Temes
cal. Gregg and the widow have been mak
ing love to each other for several months,
and now Gregg Is out over $250 on the
agreement, and has Invoked the aid of the
Justice's Court to bring the lady to time.
John Gregg llled a complaint this after
noon, In which he alleges that Mrs. Fla
herty agreed to marry him, but that after
he had advanced her over $250 she broke
the agreement. Now, because he cannot
have the widow, he wants the money.
The complaint alleges that in May, two
years ago, Gregg and Widow Flaherty
agreed to marry, but were cautious
enough to reserve the right to rescind
their contract upon notice to the other of
such intention. In such event, it was
agreed, so the complaint says, that the
Widow Flaherty should return and re
store to plaintiff all moneys and proper
ties given to her by Gregg. To be very
exact, Gregg says that the money, goods
and labor with which he has furnished
her are worth $268 55.
It appears that about the time of the
agreement the comely widow was nego
tiating for a pension, and after learning
that in the event of her marriage her pen
sion would cease she served Gregg with a
verbal notice that the agreement to marry
must be forgotten. Gregg did not accept
this situation, believing that his services
as a husband were worth more than the
$12 a month which his fiancee would re
BRIDE OF J\

On Wednesday evening last Miss Carry
Goldman and Benedict Fleischer were>

ciating.
The ceremony took place In the ban
quet hall at Delmonico's, after which
the guests, one hundred In number, par
took of an eftihorate dinner.
The bridal procession was led by two
little flower girlsâ Miss Mn.e Neuman and
Miss Sadie Sternâ who strewed the bride's
path with roses. Sanford Walter was
best man, and the maid of honor was
Miss Hilda Kline. The bride wore a gown
of white organdie over white taffeta. The
maid of honor was gowned in pink and
white organdie. The newly wedded pair

Mrs. L. GroÃslicht of 729 Foleom. atr&et
celve In case the pension were granted
her. She promised, however, to keep that
part of the agreement relating to the re
turn of money and goods advanced.
Subsequently, says the complaint, Mrs.
Flaherty received from the United States
Government a goodly sum of money on
account of back pensions, but although
this sum amounted to $1300 the widow has
persistently refused to draw her check in
favor of Gregg for that $268 55.
Mr. Gregg further alleges that in order
to prevent him from collecting his right
ful share of that back pension the Widow
Flaherty "is now evading her liability in
the payment of the aforesaid debt, and
threatens to hypothecate all her property
in order to defeat, hinder and delay
Gregg's claim upon her for payment."
Gregg was not altogether penniless, for
when the agreement to marry was made
he on his part promised to deed to the
widow a lot on New Broadway.

SAYS THOUGHT
IS KING OF
THE WORLD
It Rules Man and All
His Affairs.
A HEALER OF ALL ILLS
DOCTRINE OF CHRISTIAN SCI
ENCE EXPLAINED.
Lecture by Edward A. Kimball of
Chicago on the Power
of Faith and
Mind.
Edward A. Klmball of Chicago lec
tured before a large audience in Golden
Gate Hall last evening on the subject
of "Christian Science."
After referring to the fact that he
himself and tens of thousands of others
had been healed by this science, Mr.
Kimball said:
One of the most important features of
Christian science is the exposition of
mental causation as the procurator of
disease.
In order to properly direct your atten
tion I wish to remind you of the fact that
thought governs humanity at all points.
All the strife and war among nations
is, primarily, thought. All the business
affairs of the world are thus originated.
Continents are discovered, explored and
colonized; nations are founded; cities are
built; the earth is made to bring forth its
products; goods are designed and manu
factured and all of the vast, ponderous
transactions of the world are procured
and continued by the action of thought.
Thought establishes social relationships,
and, on the other hand, it murders and
commit* suicide. It brings forth the
manifestations of music, art and inven
tion, and. again, it demolishes and de
stroys, without thought all human activ
ity would, cease; the earth would become
depopulated; the wheels of industry would
abruptly stop, crumble and decay and the
work or man's hands be obliterated, and
mortal man and his affairs, which exist
because of thought, would be a nonentity
without it.
When you understand that thought
works out such a tremendous impulsion
in the career of man you will find little
difficulty in accepting the proposition in
Christian Science, that thought which
does, everything else to a human being
can also make him sick.
Such an admission paves the way to
the acceptance of a correlative statement
that if evil and ignorant thought, fear,
hatred and passion, can make him sick,
true thought, that t>hich is natural and
scientific, can bring about a changed con
dition and produce a healing influence
and effect.
Christian Science points out the possi
bility of your obtaining complete mastery
over the sense of pain and disease, and j
Just in proportion as you gain this under- i
standing and thereby manifest the nat
ural dominion and control over bodily
conditions you will gradually lose all ;
conscious and unconscious fear and es- I
cape its havoc.
The change of thought which must and
will transform the world will reverse all
of the purely material theories about dis- j
ease and show that many of the steps j
that are taken to prevent and cure it but j
aggravate and augment it. The new un- i
derstanding of scientific law will annul !
the laws of disease, will locate mental
causation and remove the consequences
of fear.
Evil thought concerning disease has an
offspring in evil conversation about it,
and to-day the race is inflicting the most
appalling consequences upon Itself as the
result of insufferable and limitless talk
about sickness.
People who fear and avoid contagion
and infection will actually submerge
themselves in the introspection of self
and the inspection and comments of every I
one else, not knowing that those things !
are more harmful and do vastly more
damage than the others.
Medical records indicate Innumerable
instances where illness has terminated j
fatally simply because of the fright and i
discouragement that were projected upon
the patient by other people who through
narrative, prediction or expressed fears
prostrated the hope and courage and ex
pectation of the sick man who, if undis
turbed, would have recovered spontane
ously.
Christian Scientists urge the avoidance
of the world-wide habit of overmuch talk
ing about the diseased condition of the
body, because as a theme for conversa
tion It is or should be unattractive and
offensive to people of wholesome sensi
bilities. Secondly, because nearly all such
conversation is among people who know
really nothing about disease; and lastly,
because such conversations propagate
fear and plant the seeds of disorder and
disease, which unconsciously lodge, ger
minate and consume.
Christian Science has reformed drunk
ards and the victims of morphine and
other habits. Confirmed or chronic in
ebriety is among the Infirmities of man
which have been considered well nigh
hopeless.
Christian Science heals all sorts of peo
ple of all manner of diseases. At the
World's Congress of Religions it was au
thoritatively stated that more than one
million cases of disease had been healed
by it up to that time and that many of
them had been considered incurable. It
has cured diseases that have never been
known to be healed by any other means.
It has instructed the infidel and agnostic,
who, unable to adopt any of the miscon
ceived substitutes for Deity which have
disfigured human thought, have been glad
to acquaint themselves with the under
standing of God which unfolds the very
substance and science of being, instead of
involving the believer in a labyrinth of
mystery which gives no promise of yield
ing to anything but death.
Christian Science has purified and ex
alted the motives, desires and alms of
men. Increased their wisdom, their exec
utive and business capacity; arrested tne
havoc of vice; refined character and ele
vated manhood and citizenship. These are j
indisputable facts, and they are indelibly I
engraved on the annals of humanity. To
dispute them now would be folly. I leave i
them with you without even entreating |
you to give heed, buÂ» 'leing persuaded
that the wise man will in due time ms
cern that a happipr destiny awaits adop
tion by mortal man and with the confi
dence that toward that destiny the weary
sufferer will at last turn his footsteps
to realize the deliverance which has fcoen
the hope of the ages.

ROSSER HELD
ON THE CHARGE
OF MURDER
Preliminary Hearing
in the Police Court.
EVIDENCE OF THE SHOOTING
NO DEFENSE OFFERED FOB THE
TENNESSEEAN.
During the Examination He Sat in
His Chair Dejected and Ap
parently Without
Hope.
Walter Rosser, the young Tennessee
soldier, charged with the murder of
Henry Hilderbrand in the Spreckels Mar
ket on September 13, was the picture <t
despair as he sat in Judge Joachlmscn's
court yesterday morning listening to the
testimony of the witnesses that may send
him to the gallows.
The court room was crowded with the
usual morbid throng of people, but if
they expected any startling development
they were disappointed. The preliminary
examination was pushed through ex
pedltlously and no time was wasted in
asking Irrelevant questions. Prosecut
i ing Attorney Graham conducted the peo
| pie's case and the defendant was repre
sented by Attorney D. A. Ryan of Gen
eral Barnes' office.
The witnesses examined were those who
gave their testimony at the Coroner's in
quest. They were Willie Walsh, Sam
Casel, W. M. Morris, Richard N. Nias.
C M. Foster. J. T. Baxter, George Bay
ford, Policeman C. M. Janes and Dr.
Gallagher, who made the autopsy on
Hllderbrand's body.
The evidence of the witnesses was upon
the shooting and the coolness and deliber
ation with which it was done. George
Bayford's testimony was the most dra
matic. He said that he heard the first
shot, and on looking out of the dining
room of the cafe he saw Rosser with the
revolver in his hand. Rosser took steady
alm and fired a second shot. He then
slowly walked about seven paces In the
direction of, the Stevenson-street en
trance and raising nls revolver aloft
yelled, "What's the matter with the Ten
nessee boys?" and ran into the street.
Policeman, Janes testified that when he
arrested Rwsser he asked him:
"What the matter, young fellow?"
Rosser replied:
"Do you want some of it? I shot a
man."
Janes asked him "what for" and he re
plied:
"None of your business."
After Janes took him back to the mar
ket to the scene of the shooting, Janes
said:
"Did you shoot that man?" and Rosser
replied:
"Yes; I shot him like a soldier."
Janes asked why he shot him and he
again repleld: None of your busi
ness." Then he grabbed Janes by the
throa.t and yelled, "Tennessee boys, where
are you?"
In cross examining the witness the at
torney for the defendant contented him
self by asking questions as to whether
there was any loud language or signs of
a dispute before the shooting, and in every
instance he was answered in the negative.
After the prosecution rested the de
fendant's attorney said he had no evi
dence to offer and the Judge held the de
fendant to answer before the Superior
Court on the charge of murder without
ball.

SAYS HE HEARD
NO COMPLAINTS
Troops at Honolulu in
Good Health.
DISEASE ON TRANSPORTS
NO HITCH IN THE TRANSFER OF
THE ISLANDS.
Will Require Years to Perfect Per
manent Military Quarters â No
Accommodations for Addi
tional Troops.
Major General H. C. Merriam arrivea
at an early hour yesterday morning on
the steamer Australia from Honolulu, and
Is happy to be back in his old quarters in
the Phelan building. Speaking of a re
ported misunderstanding a.s to the final
transfer of the islands to thÂ© representa
tives of the United States he said yes
terday in relating- his experiences that
there was no serious difficulty. A ques
tion was raised as to the proper method
of obtaining possession of the public prop
erty, but this was readily settled satisfac
torily to all parties concerned.
"It is a mistake," said the general, "to
say that there was even the slightest
friction in any quarter. On the contrary,
I found nothing but cordiality and good
â¢will on the part of the Hawaiian officials.
"They are now exercising their func
tions under the authority of the President
of the United States, and business is run
ning nmoothly."
With reference to the soliders now gar
risoned at Honolulu, General Men-lam
said that the camps were located on lanu
belonging largely to the Government, and
that little more can be done to improve
the temporary camps at present.
"Before I left for Honolulu," said the
fenerai, "I recommended the erection of
arracks for the housing of the troops,
but so far as I know nothing has been
done in that direction. If the material
and funds were at hand now the shelters
could be constructed before the rainy sea
eon sets in." He further stated that as
these things were not forthcoming at the
time of his departure, he had done the
best he could under the circumstances,
and ordered floors put In the tents. Asked
If the accommodations provided were suf
ficient he stated that if no more troops
were quartered there those now in camp
could be properly cared for.
"When it comes to the question of per
manent camps," said tne general, "it may
be a matter of years and will call for a
large expenditure of money before it is
settled. It is a proposition that must be
adjusted from a strategical standpoint
and when once settled should be per
manent. There is no dearth of proper lo
cations, but it will require much time to
secure and properly equip them for for
tifications and barracks. Harbor de
fense is the llrst lte-m to be considered
and Congress handles such matters. I
trust that such arrangements as it is
possible to make will be concluded before
the bad weather begins and that there
will be no serious trouble."
General Merriam's attention was called
to the fact that convalescent soldiers who
returned on the Australia complained
bitterly of their treatment on board the
transport and in camp at Honolulu.
"I have heard none of these com
plaints," said he, "and It has been ray
duty to not only hear grievances, but to
correct them. The accommodations in
camp were the best that could be afford
ed and the hardships were incident to the
heat, to which the men were not accus
tomed. While the temperature is not
high, it is depressing and very disagree
able to those unaccumated. I must con
fess that I am glad to get back to the
cool weather of San Francisco.
"As to the command stationed there,
the men are in exceptionally good health
and nearly all the sickness ti-.it has de
veloped was carried there on the trans
ports. Naturally there have been sev
eral deaths. I realize the discomforts
that must exist on transports in the
tropics and that all cannot have state
rooms. Most of the complaints. I think,
come from the fnct that nearly all the
volunteers in private life have been ac
customed to travel in good style and find
It hard to adjust themselves to the hard
ships incident to time of war."
When asked if he expected to go to
Manila. East or remain in San Francisco,
General Merrlam bluntly replied that he
expected to "obey orders" and did not
know what they would be. He further
stated that from his knowledge of the
â¢work on hand when he left the islands, the
Hawaiian Commissioners need not be ex
pected to return for two or three weeks.

Troops Want General Miller to
Command the Expedition.
General Miller's recommendation that
Batteries A and D of the First Battalion
of California Heavy Artillery, under com
mand of Major Rice, be included In the
list of those troops to be sent to Manila,
was favorably acted upon by the War De

TWO WOMEN
CALL HIM
HUSBAND
Mr. Nelson of Penryn
in a Dilemma.
AUSTRIAN AND ENGLISH WIVES
STRANGE CLAIM OF A NOBLE
VIENNESE LADY.
She Says He Is Rich, Tried to Pen
sion Her Off and Evaded the
Obligation â An Embroglio
in High Society.
William Henry Nelson of Penryn and
Loomis Is in the unpleasant dilemma of
having two wives.
Mrs. Nelson, the recognized wife who
Is well known and has been much ad
mired in the English colony at Penryn,
is one, and the other Is a lady who has
Just arrived from Vienna. The latter
brings papers and letters which leaves no
room for doubt that she was married
to Mr. Nelson In 1886 at the British Em
bassy in the embassy chapel by the Rev.
William H. Heckler and in the presence
of her father and friends.
She has asked and obtained the assist
ance of the British Consul and also of
the Austrian. Her people are influential
in Vienna and admitted to the royal
court, which is the most exclusive in Eu
rope, no one having less that sixteen no
ble ancestors being allowed at court. She
Is the daughter of Captain Smeschkall of
the Austrian army. Her brother is an
officer in the regular army and is at
present stationed in Vienna.
After their marriage the Nelsons pur
chased a home in Vienna. Mr. Nelson
had a large fortune and she lived in the
best style. They traveled three months
every year and went frequently to Mr.
Nelson's father's home in England. Mrs.
Nelson's younger sister was to be mar
ried, and with her husband she started
to attend the wedding.
"You go to your lather's and I will
stop and pick up your brother at his
quarters and we will come on together,"
said Mr. Nelson to his wife. There had
been no trouble of any kind and she
was much surprised when her brother
arrived alone. Mr. Nelson never did ar
rive.
After a long search by detectives the
missing husband was found in Penryn,
California.
Mrs. Nelson appealed to his people in
England, but though they could offer
lime advice they told her to come to
America. This was two years ago, and
she came.
The journey from London to Penryn,
Cal., is a long trip for a lady who is not
accustomed to go about alone.
Mrs. Nelson, as she calls herself, ar
rived at Pepryn in the nighttime. When
she found the station closed she said:
"It is very dark! How can 1 get oft
here alone?"
"The Postmaster will be here for the
mail bag," she was told, and later with
him she could drive but to her husband's
house. No one was up, but she called her
husband:
â¢Willie! Willie!"
When he asked who was making such a
row downstairs, she answered.
"It is I, your wife."
"But you cannot stay here; for God's
sake be quiet."
In the room lay the woman that in the
English settlement at Penryn was known
as Mrs. Nelson. She was very ill, and
quiet was a matter of life and death
with her.
"I will do anything if you will only
come away and not make a scandal," said
Mrs. Nelson, as she consented to acom
pany him. They drove to Sacramento,
which is the nearest town to Penryn.
On the way Mr. Nelson asked her to
drive, saying that he would get out and
walk. In telling the story of that mid
night drive, Mrs Nelson said:
"I heard his steps on the road behind
me, and I was afraid and stopped the
horses, .and said to him, 'You must get
in beside me.' "
It was a lonely spot on the road where,
he told her, a man had been murdered not
long before. Continuing she said in her
foreign way:
"I told him the consul expected me the
next day to call on him; he would look
for me if I did not appear on time, and
he knew where I had gone.
"When we arrived at Sacramento we
made an agreement. In my country there
is no divorce. He may go as he will. 1 do
not care for him to come back. But
shall I go back to my father's house a
burden to my father? 1 said no I would
"He promised to send me $15,000 as
soon as I was in Vienna, and be
sides a regular allowance. He gave me
then $3000 and bought my tickets back
to Austria. A friend of his stayed to see
me safely started and he went back to
his home, for he thought only of the sick
woman and the little baby.
"I waited and I waited and two years
have passed, but not one word or one dol
lar have 1 had from him, and so I have
come to America once more.
"Now I have engaged lawyers and will
see what the law can do. I shall not go
back so easily this time.
Mrs. Nelson is an Austrian and speaks
but broken English, but she intends to
have her rights if she can get them.
She has employed detectives both In Lon
don, where Mr. Nelson's securities are
held, and also in this country to find out
what his property, which is very large, is.
He owned a general store at Loomis, but
has put It out of his own hands and the
house at Penryn has been transferred to
the second Mrs. Nelson.
The latter is an English lady and much
liked and much admired in the English
colony. She came out from England with
Mr. Nelson and is a lady of quite as good
family as the Austrian wife. She has

Dedication of tKe WidoWs' and Or
phans' Jlome Set for October 13.
THE Masonic Home for Widows and Orphans which has been under
course of construction at Deooto will be completed by October 13
and on that day the building will be dedicated by the Masons and In
the presence of as many of that order as will come to the celebra
tion. It is the intention of the Masons to make the opening of the home
an event long to be remembered, and great preparations are' being made
to perfect a programme and to induce as many of the order as possible to
attend the ceremonies. At a recent meeting of the relief board of this city
a committee was appointed to take charge of any arrangements that might
be necessary to further the comfort and easy transportation of those Masons
who attended from this city and to stir up any latent enthusiasm that
might have escaped the occasion. William E. Lutz of Pacific Lodge is
chairman of the committee, and he is assisted by William McNair of Ex
celsior Lodge and G. C. Groezinger of Crockett Lodge.
The Masons have a ceremony of their own for the dedication of their
buildings, and this will be lollowed with all the solemnity and dignity
of the Masonic rites.
Charles L. Patton, chairman of the board of trustees of the institution
will open the proceedings by announcing the completion of the home and
then he will formally request the grand master, Thomas Flint and the
grand officers to dedicate the building to the noble charity for which it was
intended.
It is expected that at. least 10,000 Masons and their ends will' be pres

A BOTTLE AND A BULLET.
Lockie H. Josselyn, an Army Hospital Steward, Accused
of Attempting to Chloroform and Shoot His Wife.
I^ockie H. Josselyn, a member of the
division hospital corps at the Presidio.
was arrested Friday night on the charge
of discharging Urearms within the city
limits, but if the police can ilnd his wife
a more serious charge will be booked
against him. About 7 o'clock Friday night
a young woman came running out of the
lodging-house on the corner of Eddy and
Jones streets and told some policemen
that her husband, Lockie Josselyn, had
forced his way into her room and had
attempted to chloroform her. Failing in
that he pulled a revolver out of his pock
et and tried to shoot her. She broke
away from him and ran into the street
The policemen just then heard the report
of a revolver in a lane in the rear of the
lodging-house and learned that Josselyn
two children and the appearance of an
other wife has been a terrible blow to
her.
Mr. Nelson is the son of the Hon.
Henry Nelson, of the Indian Civil Service,
and a brother of Major Horatio Nelson of
the Twenty-first Regiment In the English
army, who is the Governor of Her Maj
esty's prison at Redding, England, which
post he received as a mark of honor for
gallant service.
When called upon her attorneys, the
Messrs. Cormac, Donohoe & Baum, re
fused to be interviewed concerning their
client, and were very reticent as to the
firobable outcome of the proceedings. The
awyers, howeveT, could not but admit
that Mrs. Nelson has a perfectly clear
case against her husband, and say if she
persists in carrying out her present inten
tions she must succeed. General Jo
Hamilton of Placer has been retained by
Mrs. Nelson, as weh as the consular
lawyers, Cormac, Donohoe & Baum.
TO GLEAN EVIDENCE
FOR MRS. BOTKIN
CHARACTER WITNESSES WILL
BE BROUGHT.
Attorneys Knight and Wheeler Leave
This Morning for Eureka on the
Pomona â Will Gather
Testimony.
The defenders of Mrs. Cordelia Botkln
are now going to take their turn at gath
ering evidence, and to this end Mr.
Knight and Mr. Wheeler will leave this
morning for Eureka on the steamer Po
mona.
The course of the prosecution has
greatly simplified the work that lies be
fore the defense. Chief Lees has already
called in his witnesses and has reduced
their actual evidence to affidavits, and
these he has made public through the
press.
While the mass of stuff that Lees has
given out made interesting reading it was
invaluable to the defense for that it
clearly outlined the facts and character
of evidence that they will be compelled
to combat should the case come up for
trial in this State.
Mr. Wheeler said yesterday: "Mr.
Knight and 1 expect to leave to-morrow
morning for Eureka, Mr. Knight to visit
his mother, and I to attend to some cases
that I have before the court there. We
will probably take advantage of our pres
ence in Humboldt to get hold of a numÂ«
ber of witnesses that we shall need to
testify to the former good character of
Mrs. Botkin wtien the case finally cornea
up for trial. Yes, we shall undoubtedly
introduce other than character witnesses,
but of the nature of their testimony I am'
of course, not at liberty to speak. Mr
Knight's stay In Humboldt will not be a
long one, but I shall not return until our
case comes up before Governor Budd
again, unless something unforseen should
arise."

J. C. Townsend, 253 Sansome street

latter was intoxicated, and was arrested
and charged with grand larceny. Towns

watch was a practical Joke.

â  and it had exploded. They found Josselyn
hiding in the kitchen of a house that

In Judge Mogan's court yesterday
: Josselyn admitted visiting his wife, from
| whom he had been separated for two
i yoars, but he denied the charge that he

her. He declined to say why he forced
himself into her presence. At the out

"MARTHA" AT
THE TIVOLI
I dare say that most people have heard
"Martha" sung before. Those who have
not have probably read reviews upon it
or heard the favorite gems of this effer
vescent opera.
Miss Lichter, who so eminently distin
guished herself during this season, seems
to have acquired a yet more finished
grace of style during the last few weeks
and it would be difficult to conceive any
thing more complete than her rendering
of "Martha."
Miss Linck had a very suitable part and
impressed her admirers to another great
triumph. The high notes of her voice
are simply superb in their limpidity and
without apparent effort she achieves pro
digies of vocaltsm.
There is a kind of magical glamour
about Pruette's Plunket. He claims this
his favorite role, and does not say too
much. The subilety of lus baritone and
his entire work In this opera stamp It as
a masterpiece. Lovely music, no doubt,
and we have heard it for years without
getting too much of it.
Zerni's sinking is characterized by great
cleverness and charm of treatment. He
has all the resources of his talent at his
finger ends, but he is not feverishly anx
ious or petulant.
I must cay that the ensemble was mag
nificently harmonious during the entire
performance. Difficulties of execution
are surmounted with great ease, and
Misses Lichter and Linck and Messrs.
Pruette and Zerni are bright examples of
the grand style that oocur to me.
It is impossible to keep pace with all
the music which is rife at this season in
ban 1- rancisoo. It must be understood
that many detailed criticisms of the dif
ferent operas are omitted from this col
umn simply because of lack of space.
1 am, however, looking forward lor a
long and lusting musical treat until the
end ol the grand opera season at our
little jewel case," the Tivoli, and will

An Evening's Fistic Entertainment
That Attracted a Large Gath- '
ering of Sports at Wood
ward's Pavilion. .â â¢'â¢â¢":
The newly organized Western Athletic
Club gave its first entertainment last
evening in Woodward's Pavilion, and it
proved a success in every particular.
Thanks to Captain James Gillen the ring
floor had been well padded, thereby pre
venting any possible danger to the con
testants who might have sustained a
heavy fall.
Jimmy Reilly won a decision over "Kid"
O'Brien, the slogger, and the referee,
"Jim" Kennedy, was hooted by the gal
lery sports, who proved that they did not
know the first thing about Queensberry
rules. Although wild and awkward In
his delivery, O'Brien fought gamely, but
Koilly stopped almost all- of the blows di
rected at his body with his glove, and the
crowd on high yelled with delight each
time they heard a sound from a smack
of gloves.
Chief Lees distinguished himself by or
dering the captain of the police to stop
the McCormick and "Young Jackson
fight In the ninth round, but it would be
difficult to imagine what prompted the
worthy Chief to issue such an ultimatum,
as neither of the "dubs" could inflict the
least punishment, although they may
have possibly succumbed from exhaus
tion.
The event of the evening was a twenty
round contest between Jimmy Lawlor, the
light-weight pugilist who recently jour
neyed to New York City expecting to get
a match with some of the Eastern cham
pions, and Sammy Maxwell of Los An
gelesâweight 132 pounds.
The betting was $10 to $6 In favor of
Lawlor, but considerable money from
the south was placed on Maxwell'by merÂ»
who had seen both pugilists perform.
"Jack" Stelznor was selected referee
of this contest, Lawlor was singularly
confident of polishing off his opponent in
quick order, but after he had a mix-up
in a few rounds with the sturdy lad from
j the orange groves he apparently wan
dered back to the old fireside and hoped
i for the best.
Maxwell, who Is a well proportioned
I fellow with good limbs and fine chest,
i is as quick as a cat on his pins and can
! deliver first-class goods at close range.
I He had Lawlor's ribs in trouble before
! the end of the third round, and all
through the mill In fact the San Fran
j ciscan's body was a target which stopped
several right hand gloves.
Lawlor some yÂ»ars ago carried a left
which went straight from the shoulder
and annoyed many a pugnacious face,
bat of late he has shifted In tactics and
now resorts to left and right swings in
the hope of landing a knockout, which
he has succeeded in accomplishing when
confronted by slow and reckless Doxers.
He found Maxwell altogether too shifty,
and try as best he could he failed at each
attempt to land his right on the jaw over
Maxwell's guard. Lawlor's left repeatedly
went over the shoulder or around the
neck of his opponent.
The contest, although it lasted twenty
rounds, can be told in few words. Max
well scored a long lead in points up to
the thirteenth round. Then Lawlor seem
ingly commenced to realize that he was
in the ring simply as a punching-bag for
hlfl opponent to practice on and he made
several desperate attempts to connect his
glove with Maxwell's Jaw, but failed re
peatedly.
It was a game very much one-sided up
to the sixteenth round, when Lawlor be
gan to encourage his friends by an occa
sional dash, but his fire was "invariably
returned with telling effect. There was
not a single round during the mill that
could be placed to the credit of the San
Franciscan, who was seemingly very
much chagrined when Referee Stelzner
awarded the contest to Maxwell.
The entertainment, which was unques
tionably good, pleased all present.
CANOEISTS RACED ON
OAKLAND CREEK
BEATRICE MADE THE FASTEST
TIME OVER THE COURSE.
A Series of Small Boat Contests Will
Be Held on the San Antonio
Estuary.
In 1593 there was organized the Oak
land Navy, with headquarters on San
Antonio Estuary, the only officials being
five committeemen, a secre.-.ry, measurer
and referee. Once a month from May to
December a regatta was held, the rules
for which were charmin~- in their sim
plicity. Boats of any size or rig might
enter, all started together, there were no
time allowances for difference in length
over all or on the water line, and the boat
that crossed the finishing line first won.
Sloops, cutters, yawls, schooners, canoes,
"Whitehalls with sails and craft of all
sizes entered the regattas, which afford
ed exciting and interesting sport. The
navy drew up a programme for 1897, but
during 1898 nothing has been heard of it.
With the view, therefore, of reviving
the interest in small boat sailing among
those who live on or near San Antonio
Estuary, the Oakland Canoe Club has
drawn up a programme of races. The
club has a* comfortable and convenient
boathouse on Sessions Basin, East Oak
land, and has on its roll the owners of
almost every kind of pleasure craft, from
a handsome schooner like La Paloma or a
fine sloop like Commodore Philip Caduc's
Annie, to a gasoline launch, a rowboat or
canoe.
The first of a series of races which the
club proposes to hold was sailed on Sun
day, September 18, on the estuary over a
triangular course at slack water and
with a strong westerly breeze. The fol
lowing boats entered. Sloops, Beatrice.
Ah Wanhee and Surprise; the canoes
Brownie, Codia. Jack. Nereid and Whine.
The sloop Beatrice made the best time over
the course. 1 hour 1 minute and 30 sec
onds; the sloop Ah Wanhee was second
and the canoe Jack third. The winner
was sailed by Charles Stewart, secretary
of the Oakland Canoe Club.
