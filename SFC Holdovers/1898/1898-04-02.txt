SPANISH CRUISERS SAIL
TO JOIN THE FLOTILLA.
Copyrighted, 189S V by James Gordon Benfcett; . '
HAVANA. April 1. â The Spanish cruisers Vizeaya and Oquendo
sailed to-night in a manner that may be termed mysterious. As
you had already been Informed, it was suspected that these two
vessels would leave this port sooner or later. This had been the
rumor here. Nevertheless few were prepared for the"." fact; of their
actual starting to-day. They went out tc-iiight with few to observe
them. :â â '.-â â "': . â  ' ; ...;- . . â¢â â â¢-â¢. â  '.' .'
No official information could be obtained with regard to the des
tination of the cruisers, but there is good reason for believing they
are on their way to Porto Rico to protect the torpedo flotilla.
When it was learned that the big cruisers were going out great
excitement prevailed in Havana, Thousands flocked to the wharves
and shores, but they saw nothing-. The ships were under steam all
day and watchers guessed something was about to happen. In the
city to-night little else is talked of but the departure of the Vizeaya
and Oquendo. Spaniards are saying they will. soon be back with the
flotilla under convoy. .. :-â¢ â  :;â  ..... . 'â¢' .
ceeded in his own eloquent manner,
so well known in the United States
courts, to plead good reasons upon
the score of humanity, common sense,
economy and peace, which made it
evident that Spain had but one
course to adopt. He told them how
anxious the United States was for
peace, and how anxious his Govern
ment was to prove it in this way.
Sagasta, the veteran Spanish
statesman, at this spoke out, and in
his brilliant oratorical style, cast
doubts upon the methods America
took of showing a desire for peace by
arming to the teeth.
One of those present described the
scene to .'me. He said: "General
Woodford was reajly spleiidid. He
was diplomatic, persuasive, consider
ate toward Spanish sensitiveness,.
impressive, nev^r <mcc left his point.
Sagasta, cold at flrat, was roused: by
what General tVbodford said, arid
seemed really t0 be perturbed by the
truth so eloquently told. General
Woodf ord struck us greatly. He Was
the diplomatist arid the gentleman,
aa well as/the United States .Minis
ter.;:; He concluded by reminding his
very distinguished I listeners that
ter all the Cuba:ri& fighting -in the
field "were-, both soldiers and- insur
gents. Equally with the Spaniards
they were children of Spain, and
surely Spaitt, as their mother, would
do all in her power and accept . ail
offer which would stop their shed
ding each other's blood.
"Then he advancea to the desk of
the president and said: 'Gentlemen,
I want to be frank and open with
you. I will telegraph to the Presi
dent of the United States from here
as to the result of our meeting, so
that you may all see it before it goes
to the President.' Then, before the
Ministers had had time to recover
from their surprise at this remark
able sample of diplomatic frankness,
General Woodford, upon a note ot
paper, headed 'Council of the Presi
dent,' sent a cablegram to President
McKinley somewhat as follows:

THE HORNETS OF THE
SPANISH NAVY ARRIVE
IN PORTO RICO HARBOR
News of a Most Distinctly Warlike
Character Causes Perturbation in
the Minds of Naval Men.
Still the President Hesitates, but Urged On by Con
gress There Must Be a Facing of
the Issue Not Later Than
Monday.
NEW YORK, April 2.â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends the
following : "I am informed that at to-night's Cabinet meeting it was practically le
cided to send an ultimatum to Spain insisting upon an immediate and complete com
pliance with all of the President's demands."
NEW YORK, April i.â The. Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
If the days of diplomatic miracles be
passed, then, war with Spain will surely
come. The feeling in Washington to
night is that only the unexpected can .
prevent hostilities. The McKinley alt
timatum to Spain is the next step ex
pected. That ultijhatum .will probably
go to Madrid to-morrow. . Then it is
but ons short stride to war.
The plain truth is that the peace
ful negotiations of General Woodf or d,
Minister to Spain* nave utterly
failed.
Spain will not recognize the right of
the United States peacefully to secure
the independence of Cuba and will make
no concessions. Spain has embarrassed
this Government by accepting a portion
of the propositions which it made,
strange as that may sound. Unfortu
nately, ; it is that portion upon which
President McKinley has laid mo=t stress
but about which Congress cares leastâ
that is the release and feeding of the
Spain has also intensified the sit
uation by treating our representa
tions about the M:.ine almost with
what is described as "frivolity."
The Spanish Government adheres to
its original claim that the Maine blew
herself up through the carelessness of
her crew. It will not recognize that it
is under any obligations other than to
apologize or offer indemnity.
In addition to this, the Cabinet be
lieves that the reply of Spain, sent
through Minister Woodford, regarding
the situation, consists of evasions and
diplomatic sharp practice, and is utter
ly lacking in that frankness and cor
diality with which this Government ap
proached Madrid.
Two Cabinet meetings have been held
and the President has been in consul
tation with Speaker Reed of the House
and a number of prominent Senators.
The President seems to be almost
dazed by the situation. He is no
longer an optimist. He sees no way
out but war, and he is as reluctant
as ever to engage in war with a na
tion so small And illy prepared for
war as Spain. He is indisposed to
take the initiative, to fire the first
shot.
The President, however, realizes that
something must be done very soon.
Doubt is expressed by naval experts as
to whether the : President realizes the
great disadvantage of the position into
which this country is. rapidly drifting:
Spain has succeeded, so far, through
diplomatic negotiations in delaying.in
tervention until that torpedo boat flo
tilla is actually in the Antilles. Naval
calculations have all been knocked out.
The Navy Department figured it all out
that the flotilla would be at St.. Thomas
on April 3, and at Porto Rico on April
5 or 6. But while the President has
hesitated and Spain has delayed the tor
pedo flotilla has been speeding across
the Atlantic and is to-night anchored in
the Spanish port.
The departure of the Vizcaya and
Oquendo from Havana to-day, pre
sumably to form a conjunction -with
the torpedo flotilla, has driven the
Navy Department almost wild. The
arrival of the flotilla At Porto Rico
â will complete the work of agitation.
As a matter of fact, the Cabinet to
day actually ignored the naval stra
tegic board on two important and war
like propositions. This bureau has in its
hands the Navy Department's plan of
defense and offense. Three of its mem.-.
TORPEDO FLOTILLA
SENT OUT BY SPAIN
REACHES PORTO RICO
NEW YORK, April I.â A Washington special to thÂ» HeraM says:
Spain has achieved an Important advantage over the United States In
getting her torpedo flotilla to this side of the Atlantic before the com
mencement of hostilities. If all the vessels of the flotilla have arrived
at Porto Rico Spain now has at that island thirteen torpedo vessels,
representing the most advanced ideas on the line of torpedo-vessel con
struction. There are three torpedo gunboats â the Dona Maria, De
Molina, the Marquis de la Victoria and the Don Alvaro de Bazan,
each of 825 tons displacement and capable of steaming at the rate of 20
knots an hour.
The torpedo-boat destroyer type is represented by six vessels â the
Furor, Terror, Audaz, Osada, Pluton and Prosperina â each of 400 tons
displacement and rated as 30-knot vessels.
There are four torpedo-boats in the squadron. Of these the Hal
con and Azor are of 108 tons displacement and 24 knots speed, while
the Ariete and Rayo displace ninety-seven tons each and have a speed
of twenty-six knots.
The announcement of the arrival of the flotilla was a surprise to
the officials of the Navy Department, for it had not been expected that
the torpedo-boats would be able to make a high rate of speed on a
prolonged sea voyage with the necessity of frequently recoaling from
the attendant collier. The naval authorities have not received official
information of the arrival of the flotilla, but they believe the an
nouncement is probably correct and regard the arrival of the flotilla
as a demonstration of the ability of torpedo-boats to make long ocean
voyages speedily and safely and of their usefulness in conducting dis
tant naval operations.
Some days are yet expected to elapse before the arrival at Porto
Rico of the armored cruisers Cristobal Colon and Maria Teresa and the
torpedo-boat destroyer Destructor, which have been dispatched from
Spain to reinforce the torpedo flotilla, but before their arrival it is
possible that the armored cruisers Vizcaya and Oquendo, which sailed
from Havana to-day, will arrive at Porto Rico and add their strength
to that of the flotilla.
Then when the other vessels arrive Spain will have in one squadron
four first-class armored cruisers, three torpedo gunboats, seven tor
pedo-boat destroyers- and four torpedo-boats. It is understood that the
forces on this side are to be still further strengthened by the addition
of the second-class battleship Victoria and the protected cruiser Alfon
so XII, and by other armored protected vessels and more torpedo ves
sels as rapidly as they can be prepared for the voyage.
Naval officers see in these Spanish preparations for the strengthen
ing of their fleet on this side of the Atlantic every reason why Spain
should endeavor by all the resources of diplomacy to delay the final
clash with this country. Many of them, believing that war was in
evitable in the end, favored action by this country which would precipi
tate hostilities 'before Spain's plans for concentrating her fleet could
be carried out, pointing out that the fleet of vessels at Havana could
be first overcome and then the torpedo flotilla would be intercepted
and the entire Spanish navy could be destroyed in detail.
There is little doubt that an effort will be made by the Spanish
authorities to bring th<- flotilla and cruisers to Havana before the
breaking out of hostilities. Strategists would like to intercept them
on the way. It is about the same distance from Hampton Roads to Ha
vana as from Porto Rico to that city, but the Brooklyn, Columbia and
Minneapolis could probably reach Havana from Hampton Roads in less
time than would be taken for the Spanish flotilla, though it is not prob
able that they could if the slower battleships of the flying squadron
should accompany them. It is possible, therefore, that there may be a
temporary combination of all or part of the vessels of Captain Samp
son's squadron with the squadron under Commodore Schley for opera
tions against the Spanish squadron.
Captain Sampson's vessels, from their neighboring base of supplies
at Key West, could readily combine with a--- vessels of the flying
squadron which might be used to prevent the Spanish squadron enter
ing the harbor of Havana,
bers went before the Cabinet and ex
plained that a junction between the
Spanish war vessels at Havana and the
torpedo flotilla ought to be prevented at
all hazards if this country is going to
fight. They recommended the dispatch
of the flying squadron immediately to
intercept the flotilla and a blockade of
Havana harbor by the North Atlantic
squadron to prevent the departure of
Spain's two cruisers.
The Cabinet saw that both of these
steps would be acts of war, and in view
of the fact that Congress had the right
to declare war, it was decided that
neither of these steps should be taken
until Congress had acted.
The President is now waiting
again.
The expectation that the country is

House and the State Department. AlÂ«
though diplomatic relations with Madrid
may be suspended at any hour, no ulti

Ministry. The administration is hoping
for some message from Spain offering Â»
counter proposition. There are mem
bers of the Cabinet who fail to see hovi

The news from Madrid also is ta

THE CAMPAIGN
WILL NOT BE ON
THE DEFENSIVE
If War Is Declared the Navy Will
Have Its Work; Cut Out From
the Start.
NEW YORK, April I.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: In view of the action of the Spanish authorities
in directing the departure of the Oquendo and the Vizcaya, it is ap
parent to naval strategists that Spain will rely at first upon the forti
fications of Havana to repel the fleet under Captain Sampson, while
Bhe will use Porto Rico as the base of operations for her forces. It.
is probable that the torpedo-boat flotilla will proceed to Havana, har
bor, and from this point will dash upon American vessels and return, if
possible, to elude their enemy's fire.
The squadron forming at Cadiz may proceed to Porto Rico, from
which point it will fit out for an attack on one of the coast cities of
the United States. Anticipating that war will come, and desirous of
supplying her ships with plenty of ammunition, advices which have: of
ficially reached the authorities are to the effect that Spain is buying
largf quantities of powder and shell both in France arid England, the
df-liverips to be made as rapidly as possible. It is expected that ajn
ntuniUon will be shipped to forto Rico on board auxiliary steamers,,
which will accompany the fleet now forming at Cadiz. â¢"â¢. .
There is no intention on thÂ§ part of the authorities to act on the.
in case of war with Spain. The flying squadron, immediate-
ly upon the declaration of war, will proceed to sea, and it was stated
to me to-day that its first duty will be to dispose of the Oquendo and
Vizcaya and the torpedo-boat flotilla, if it is possible to do so. Cap
tain Sampson's fleet will at once make an attack on Havana.
;. Captain Sampson was advised this afternoon that the Vlzcaya and
Oquendo had left .Havana, and the same information was transmitted to
Commodore Schley- Captain Sampson, therefore, knows that the Al
fonso XII is the largest vessel in Havana harbor that his squadron has
to meet, and as she is a small protected cruiser about the size of the

efore him between now and Mon
-me plan he can accept.
President McKinley is not yet
ready to be the firm advocate of war
that he promised the Congressional
committee to be in case he could not
accomplish the independence of Cuba.
'..â¢â > The talk after the adjournment of the
Second Cabinet meeting of to-day was
all in the direction of the message the
President would send to Congress and
of. an ultimatum.
. The President is temporarily crushed
at the failure of all his hopes. He wants
tinie to prepare his message. Perhaps.
in the interim, that diplomatic miracle
may come to pass.
What the President will communicate
is mere conjecture at this time. Somo
members of the Cabinet want one thing,
ffime of the members want another,
the only point that is clear is that hav
ing crossed the Rubicon, the President
has no well-defined policy. It is as
good a guess to-day that he will recom
mend the independence of Cuba as to
say that he will recommend intervention.
It is equally as good a prediction to
sr-.y that he will recommend further de
lay as to say he will recommend a de
claration of war.
In the meantime a more formidable
movement than any yet attempted is
being organized throughout the country
to influence Congress on the side of
peace. Evidences of it were to be seen
on every side to-day. Chambers of
Commerce, Boards of Trade, bankers'
associations and business organizations
generally began to pour in telegrams
urging members of Congress to stand
by the President in any policy he may
outline. These deprecate war. As this
movement has fully two days to increase
in force and'excrt its influences before
Congress reconvenes, no one can tell
just what its effect will be.
Not the slightest abatement of the
feeling in Congress against Spain
was noticed to-day. The impression
that has gone forth from the White
House, quite unintentionally, that
Spain has acted contemptuously re
garding the Maine matter will not
have a good effect. It is over the
Maine that Congress wants to fight.
If the Maine disaster is again put into j j
the situation many members of Con- i !
gress declare that the situation will be- ',
come worse than ever. Until Spain apol- j- :
ogizes or disavows or in some way yin- I
dicates the confidence that the President
in his message reposed in Spanish i
honor, the danger of an explosion will
constantly impend in Congress.
The drift of conservative members is ,
toward a declaration of war. A great |
international intrigue of financiers is
also introduced into the situation. Hold- (
ers of bonds of the Cuban republic, who i
bought as low as 10 cents and expect ]
to sell at a dollar, want the independence '
of Cuba recognized by Congress. This
will enhance the price of the bonds.
They do not want armed intervention by
the United States, because then there
would be constant danger of annexa
tion, and at annexation the bonds would
immediately become worthless.
On the other hand, the holders o{
Spanish-Cuban bonds do not want any
thing done. They do not want inter- j
vention. They give out the impression j
; that . when Spain loses Cuba the war
debt of $45d v ooo,ooo is entirely wiped out.
Both these elements are represented
here and their agents are at work in
Congress, around the administration,
everywhere.
An important fact that developed to
day is that hereafter the question of our
lack of preparation for war will not
enter into the argument as to whether |
we shall have war or not. When a [
member of the Cabinet was asked about J
our readiness, he replied: .1
"We areas ready as we ever shall
be.".\ â  . â ; ;:-â > 'â  ;â  ,-' ' â¢* â¢

ment-giving the substance of Spain's !
reply . .to M'cKinley's proposition, as
Berit by Woodford : The statement is
as .follows: .'.'â â¢â¢
Ha : . informs the. Government of the
United. States that Genera) .Blanco has
revoked the decree relating to. the .ro
coneentrados in the. western provinces â¢
of Cuba, which are understood to be
the provinces of Matanzas, Santa
Clara, Habana and Pinar del Kio; that
the Spanish Government has placed at
the- disposal of the Governor-General
the credit of 3,000,000 pesetas ($600,
000), to the end that the country people
may return at once and with success to
their labor.
The Spanish Government will accept
whatever assistance to feed and succor
the necessitous that may be sent from
the United States, in accordance with
the plan now in operation, and It is
proposed to confide the preparation for
an honorable and stable peace to the
Insular Parliament, without the con
currence of which the Spanish Govern
ment would not be able to arrive at
the final results, it being understood
that the powers reserved by the consti
tution to the Central Government are
not lessened or diminished.
As the Cuban Chambers will not
meet until the 4th day of May, the
Spanish Government will not, on its

Spain's reply had been received, dis
cussed and digested and the American !
people were waiting the knowledge of i
its contents. He well knew that behind
and beyond the question involving af- j
fairs in Cuba was the great public fin- j
ger pointing at the broken bottom of
the Maine. This was further impressed
upon him as the day wore on, although
no sign of such knowledge was dis
played by him.
Assistant Secretary Day was the first
caller and the issuance of the state

and then the Cabinet meeting. Never
did American Ministers gather with
more promptness or with graver faces.
Their expressions were in keeping with
the atmosphere in and around the Ex
ecutive Mansion. Visitors, even, lost
their looks of interest in the prevailing
gloom and methodically saw the sights,
because their troughts were upstairs

of its must critical epochs was being
The Cabinet meeting was remarkable
in that before it was called many per
sons came in who had been called upon
for their opinions through the regular
redtape lines of official custom. The
Naval Board of Strategy, composed of
Captain Albert S. Barker, Commander
Hicnardson Clover and Commander A.
S. Crowninshield, was with the Cabinet
forty minutes. The Cabinet knew more
about the threatening character of the
Spanish torpedo boat flotilla when the
board retired.
Captain Humphrey of the Boston Tug
Company, whose wrecking outfit is en
gaged on the Maine in Havana Harbor
was next admitted. He was asked how
long it would take to get the outfit out
of the harbor.

ing adjourned, and haggard men with
la"~ard steps went their way to their
several departments, leaving behind the

oio conclusion only to swing back to
another. At the close of the meeting
the brief story of Spain's ungenerous
reply to the representations of the
i.nited States was given out to add its
influence to the public Indiernation that
surged and swelled almost to the point
of breaking forth in streets and stores
in banks and counting houses, fvory
where that an American heart throbbed
and pulses beat.
Speaker Reed was sent for and was
with the President haf an hour. Could
the House be pleaded to grant more
time for the consideration? That was
the question. It was answered affirma
tivelyâ ho. diplomatically. It would be
tested, and if possible tried.
At 5 o'clock the Cabinet officers met
again, and for an hour and three-quar

power of any of them. To-night Presi

The military formation division of
the War Department has in. prepara.- j
tion.a publication giving a. great mass |
of information concerning the military
of the different States and Territories
based upon returtis for 1897. ' It is of i
particular Interest at this time, in view i
of the possibility of this reserve army
being called upon for active military
duty. For the sake of ready, reference
there has been prepared asuceihct sum
mary showing, the more, important
features of the operations of the guard, i
The total authorized strength. is 184,
848 more than the organized strength.
Oklahoma has the smallest force, 500,
and New York the largest.
There are regularly organized State
hospital or ambulance corps in the
States -of California, Georgia, Illi
nois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Minnesota. New Hampshire, New Jer^
sey> New York, Oregon, Rhode Island,
Utah, Vermont and the. District of Co
lumbia. Many of the. States have very I
complete and efficient regimental hos
pital and ambulance corps. Signal
corps are reported as organized in aj
number of States: Official State en- i
campments of instruction were held in j
thirty-one States during 1897.
The duration. of the encampment var
ied from two days in Nebraska to ten
i days in the District of Columbia; six
I days being the average. Regular
troops encamped with State troops in
Alabama, California, Kansas, Michi
gan, Minnesota, Tennessee. Texas, Ver
mont. Seventeen Statesâ ; Conne niciit;
Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire,
New York, : North Dakota, Ohio, Khode
Island, Tennessee, 'Texas,. Vermont and
Wisconsin â are reported â as owning
their camp grounds.
As to armament, the conditions are:
Infantryâ All of the States except
Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana
and New York are completely armed
with the Springfield rifle, caliber 45. In
New York the Remington rifles are how
being exchanged for the Springfield ri
fle, caliber 45. .
Cavalryâ The cavalry of all the
States is- armed with the Springfield
carbine, caliber 45, except Illinois, Lou
isiana, Oregon, South Carolina and New
i Mexico. The Illinois cavalry is report
! Ed "same as in regular service." The
! greater part of the cavalry is also arm
ed with the saber and revolver in addi
tion: to the carbine.
Artillery â Thirty^one out of the thir
i ty-nine States having artillery organi
: zatifns have one or more Gatlinsr guns.
i Marty of the State 3 have the 3.2 B. L. j
I riiles. but a large proportion of the ar- .
; tiilery armament is. old and out of date, j
The equipment in 1897., though in j
I slightly better shape tliaÂ»" the year be
fore, is still far from complete. Con
siderable improvement was shown in
the cure of the equipment. In almost
i all cases the artillery harness is old and
1 practically worthless. Most of the field
and staff officers in all the States own
their mounts. There was a slight in
! crease in 1897 in the number of shelter
tents. The tentage is reported as am
ple for the entire guard in Colorado,
< 'onnectlcut, Delaware, Kansas, Ne
'â â  braska. New York, North Carolina, j
Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington, j
1 Wisconsin and the District of Colum- j
â¢ bia.
Weekly drills by company and field i
i exercises were held in many States and i
twenty States report a regular course)
of instruction at the home stations dur- j
ing the winter months. Guard duty â 
] was performed in a manner far from
satisfactory. There was a marked in- i
crease in the amount of outpost duty.
i Target practice was held in thirty- |
I four States. Though many of the
States permit the existence of inde
pendent commands, the tendency i.s
! more to discourage their support or or
i ganization, particularly in the vicinity
of the home stations of the guard, for
the reason that they absorb material
that would otherwise find its way into
' the ranks of the regular organization
j and, besides, not being subject to the
j uniform administration and discipline
of the regular State forces, they can
not be counted nrn in emergency.
In the following States and Territor
ies the guard was called on to aid the
civil authorities in maintaining the law:
Alabama. California, Colorado, Illinois,
1 Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas,
Washington and New Mexico.
SPAIN HOPES TO

Approaching Alliance of Eng
land and This Country.
MADRID, April I.â The Imparcial
says the Government has received ex
cellent Impressions on the favorable
attitude of European Continental pow
ers, whose friendly dispositions toward
Spain have been strengthened by the
fact that the United States and Eng
land have lately been drawn closer by
their common interests in China. It
asserts that the French and Russian
Governments have asked Spain to state
clearly the maximum of concessions
she can make to Cuba and the United
States, with a view, of enabling those
powers to exercise pressure at Wash
ington in favor of the preservation of
peace and the Spanish rule in Cuba.
El Liberal says that Spain must trust
solely to her own energies. I under
stand this paper re-echoes the impres
sion that is dominant in diplomatic
circles and among many Spanish
statesmen. On the other hand, the
Ministers and their supporters seem still
to entertain some hope that President
McKinley may hesitate and again at
tempt to stem the war currents pre
vailing in his Parliament and country
now that the Spanish reply leaves no
doubt that the Queen and her Ministers
will not surrender Cuba without a
struggle, however costly and unequal it
may prove to be. â¢

HAMPTON ROADS
Flying Squadron Not to
Be Sent Out for
the Present.
Its Movement South Would
Be Regarded as an
Act of War.
The Administration Apparently Does
Not Want to Offend Spain .
at Thi3 Time.
Special Dispatch . to . The Call.
WASHINGTON, April I.â The flying
squadron is to remain in Hampton
Roads for the present at least. This:
announcement was. made late this aft
ernoon by Secretary Long and set at
rest the reports wYiich had been cur^
rent throughout the day that a, move
ment of the squadron Was imminent.
The Secretary said the department be
lieved that the present rendezvous of
the squadron was the most available
one from which the ships under Com
modore Schley could operate in carry
ing out the protection of the North At
lantic seaboard: He added that no or
ders had been issued, to Commodore
Schley and that none were in immedi
ate contemplation- . : .
In the various phases of the situa
tion to-day, the flying squadron stoood
out prominently, both as a center of
public interest, in connection with
rumored orders lor its sailing from the
Roads, and as a matter of considera
tion by the department. It is said on
reliable authority that the department
discussed the question of ordering the
ships to sea, presumably, though not
officially so stated; in connection with
the approach of the Spanish torpedo
flotilla.
It has been an open secret for some
days that the naval authorities have re
garded the approach of the Spanish
flotilla with apprehension, and their
feelings in this regard were strong
enough to call the matter to the atten
tion of the authorities. After consider
ing the matter, however, it was de
cided that no orders would be issued
looking to a movement of the squadron.
While the decision is understood to
have been based primarily upon the
fact that it would be "unwise to re
move the ships from their present valu
able strategic position, yet it is, be
lieved that diplomatic considerations
alao had some weight. ..â¢;â¢
It was pointed out that the; sending
of the squadron in the direction of the
West Indies, even though its mission
were not to intercept the flotilla, would
be regarded as a hostile act not war
ranted by the present condition of af
fairs. It is also understood that it was
deemed wise not to permit any move
ment of the flying, squadron whatever
just at present, aa public interest is so
largely centered upon it that such a
movement would be liable to miscon
struction and mipht give rise to ru
mors that would tend only to aggravate
the situation. The flying squadron will
be completed to-morrow with the ar
rival of the Minneapolis at Hampton
Roads, and then the swiftest group of
warships ever gathered In one com
munity will be assembled under Com
modore Schley's flag.
GRABBING THE RICH
GILSONITE CLAIMS.
SALT LAKE. April I.â A special to the
Tribune from Fort Duchesne, Utah, say's:
Yesterday morning the post was crowded
with men. anxious to know if the Uncom
pahpro reservation would be thrown open.
When the truth of the situation began
to dawn upon the crowd there was a rush
to hitch up teams and In a short time
they were on the road, hoping to gain
possession of the few acres of good agri
cultural land along Green River and the
gold and copper bon.ansas along the West
ern edge of the reservation.
No precautions had beert taken to cir
cumvent "sooner*?." Neither the Indians
nor thp post cpmmander had boon ap
prised that the opening would occur. To
day the cat wus let out of the bag. While
every one was indulging in talk that the
time for opening would be extended six
months the moneyed interest was at
work, nriofly stated the play was to
pain possession of the gilsonite veins,
which seems to have resulted that the St.
Louis corporation practically controls the
whole available gilsonite product of
America. They worked through the men,
mostly citizens of Vernal, who took
claims in good faith over ten vearg ago,
It is claimed by the best legal talent, that
these claims now hold good Under the
general mining law.

The damage to the buildings will be
repaired as . rapidly as the men can be

ney if or. the construction and repair de
partments are well underway,. and the
cracked one will be ; braced so work will
not have to await the new one. New
ends -will be put in the two storehouses,
and the foundation and machine shop
and the other damaged buildings will
be braced with steel girders. New saw
mill machinery has been ordered and
it -will be placed in one of the new steel
skeleton buildings to await the build
ing qf a similar structure on the old j
sawmill site. This will take but a short >
time. â  ' . â¢â .'.. â¢ : . ..':
Estimates of the damage are still
climbing, and there are more people
who say nearly air of the buildings will
have to be replaced. When they were
built labor and material were much
dearer, than now, and so it Will hot take
nearly what they cost to replace them.
The board on the hospital has not yet
reported, but there is not much chance
that the building will escape condem
nation.' A new hospital will cost fully
$15.0,000.: On the officers' quarters $50,
000 more will have to be: spent, for
there are twelve badly damaged build
ings.. The. sawmill and the chimney
will cost at least $100,000 more, and this
is. not half the repairs needed.
The Moriadnock will not come to the

RUMORS THAT POPE
LEO WOULD MEDIATE.
WASHINGTON, April Iâ Late this
afternoon a Madrid bulletin was re
ceived, stating that the Pope was seek
ing to exercise pacific influences, by In
ducing tooth Spain and the insurgents
to accept an armistice in Cuba^ If this
be true, the Pope has not given atiy
instructions or information along this
line to" Morisignor Jriartinelli, the Papal
delegate at Washington. The latter
has taken no step >o\vard mediation.
It has been reported that one of the
archbishops of the Catholic: church, . in.
the course of an informal conferences
with high bfticials here, suggested the
mediatinn of the Pope. This, however,
was unofficial, and! no authorized prbp
ositiori of any character has come from
Rome. Furthermore, there is little
reason to believe the administration
would receive with favor any propo
sii.on of this character from a foreign
source.
PLENTY OF SHIPS FOR
AUXILIARY CRUISERS.
But the TJnited States Appears to Be
Behind Spain in Torpedo-Boats
and Destroyers*
The auxiliary cruiser board of naval
officers is Tiaving a difficult task in
making a Judicious. selection from the
hundreds of steam yachts and tugs of-

pace almost equal to that of sea-going
torpedo boats.
The lack of torpedo boat destroyers of
twenty-eight to thirty knots speed is a
serious want in the navy, inasmuch as
Spain has six of these formidable crafts
and eleven first-class torpedo boats,
with speeds ranging from twenty-four
to twenty-eight knots, and four with
speeds of over twenty up to twenty

THE DEAD OF
THE MAINE TO
BE AVENGED
Congress Does Not LooK Upon
Tf)at as a Matter of Minor
Importance.
BOSTON, Mass., April I.â A Washington special says: The Foreign
S Relations Committee of the Senate are already at work on the resolu
tions which are to be a response to the President's message. Before
the resolutions are reported the House committee will be consulted so
that the two branches of Congress may act in complete harmony.
The resolutions will recognize the independence of Cuba. They will
declare that Spain must quit the island and they will authorize and di
rect the executive to employ the entire military and naval force of the
tJnited States to carry the resolutions into effect. This is the probable
framework., although it may be somewhat amended.
But of equal importance with the resolution will be the preamble,
and in this, preamble Congress will call attention to the destruction
of the Maine and will give this greatest of wrongs a place in the recent
: offenses for which Spain is to be called to account.
: .-â â ' ; '- It will be found when the books, are made up by Congress that the
Maine incident is not regarded as amatter of minor importance. There
will be no further diplomatic representations by the United States,
this.may be set down as .certain, ...
only bring up eight torpedo boats com
pleted up to date, which; are credited;
with speeds ranging from twenty to
twenty-eight and six-tenths knots. It
should be borne in mind that the ac
credited speed of torpedo boats is that
developed on their official trials in an
hour's spin over a measured course,
and that the actual working gait must
necessarily fall considerably short of
the exhibition trial, but allowing a re
duction of 25 per cent, It will be ob
served that the Spanish boats have the
advantage both in number and speed.
When it comes to actual sea speed
the average yacht will have less of a
percentage to be deducted from its
trial speeds, and its performance at
sea is likely to be equal to that of the
torpedo b(?at, and in the appended list
of seventy-nine steam yachts the board
cannot fail to choose some very desira
ble vessels, suitable for conversion to
torpedo boats, or to act as dispatch
boats, for which latter service they are
eminently suited.

The yachts with a star against their
names have been built in Scotland; all
the others are of American build. The
length is that over all and the tonnage
is the registered gross tonnage.
Latest advices state that the board
has selected at least five yachts, name
ly, Mayflower, Almy, Alicia, Columbia
and Heroine. No data are at hand to
identify the last named. There is a
paddle boat by that name, built in Scott
: land for blockade running in 1862, after
ward captured and now owned in MoÂ«
bile, but she is not likely to be the ves
sel purchased. . \ : .
The Mayflower, owned in the Goelet
estate, was built by J. & G. Thompson,
Clydebank, Scotland, in 1897, at a cost
of $600,000. She is 275 feet on the water
line, 37 feet 6 inches beam and draws 17
feet 6 inches. Her two engines develop
4650 horsepower and she made sixteen
and three-quarter knots at her trials.
With a coal capacity of 530 tons the
yacht can steam 2000 knots at full speed
and 6300 knots under a twelve-knot
gait. The vessel has the highest classi
fication in Lloyd's and is suited in
every respect for a torpedo gunboat,
and "her armament, it is stated, will
consist of one five-inch rapid-firing gun
forward, one five-inch aft, twelve six
pounders and two torpedo tubes. The
price paid is about 5450,000, and she will
be ready for service in one month. She
is receiving a belt of two-inch steel ar
mor in wake of her machinery.
The Almy, owned by Frederic Gala
tin, New York, is 155 feet 6 inches o n
the water line, twenty-four feet beam,
and draws only 9 feet 6 inches. She ha 3
triple expansion engines and a maxi
mum speed of fifteen knots.
The Alicia was built by Harland <fc
Hollingsworth, Wilmington, and owned
by H. M. Flaeler, New York. She is
160 feet by 24 feet on the -water line, and
has a draught of 9 feet 6 inches. Her
engines are identical with the Almy
and the highest speed claimed is fifteen
knots.
The Columbia, owned by J. H. Ladew,
I New York, was built at Cramps, and
j measures 180 feet by 23 feet on the wa
\ ter line. The draught is 10 feet 6 inch
t es, and her triple-expansion, four-cyl
j inder engines develop 1800 horsepower
and gave a speed of eighteen knots an
hour on. the acceptance trial over a
course at sea of eighty miles.
Negotiations are progressing for ob
taining other yachts, most prominent
of which is the Niagara, twin-screw,
j launched last month and owned by
Howard Gould. She has a bunker ca-
I: pacity of 450 tons and is intended to
make* fifteen knots. Under present con
ditions the Niagara could be completed
in less than two months. Other notable
yachts are the Eleanor, which was in
this bay less than two years ago; the
Valiant, Nahma, May, Josephine, Cor
sair. Atalanta. Varuna, Sovereign.
Nahmouna andNourmahal. All of these
are of over 500 tons register; and among
smaller yachts are such as the Helve
tia, said to have a speed of eighteen
knots, the Fatanella and a host of
other very desirable boats because of
their light draught. i
The board has also acquired four
tugs: the P. H. White, Storm Klnp.
Hercules and Taurus. Negotiations are
also progressing toward obtaining sev
en other tugs, of which the following
data may be of interest:

The Edgar F. Luckenbach is probably
one of the fastest tugs on the Atlantic

twelve knots which, as a matter of fact,
is better than the average steam yacht.

Bautelle, in a spirited reply, declared
that the history of naval warfare
Fhowed that the great naval battles of
the world had been won by the ships
r.f the battle line.
HHborn (R.) of California, a member
of the Naval Committee, argued ear
y in favor of authorizing the per
manent linen ase to the battle line pro
vided in tlv bill.
Cummings (D.) of New York declared

Japan and China in ordering battle

Pearce (R.) of Missouri offered an
at to increase the number of

stroyers authorized by tho bill to
twelve each and to increase the appro^
tion from 12,300.000 to $4,600,000, He
quoted a hiph naval officer as stating
that these torpedo craft were absolutely
:sary t<Â» the protection of the bat
tleships of the navy. It waa little short
of criminal, he contended, to subject
to dangers from a torpedo-boat.
Boutelle said the committee was per
â¢ willing to accept the Pearce
I'lment, but he pointed out that
â  r the emergency appropriation the
administration was buying and build-
I'ipr torpedo and other boats of the mos
quito fleet for the protection of our
fiphting ships.
The debate drifted into a discussion
of tho respective merits of battle-ships
and torpedo-boats.
Do .Armond (D.) of Missouri at this'

attracted much attention. He called
' upon the administration to take the ag

Pc Armond, "hv. striking before we are

After several hours of wrangling, dur
ing which all sorts of amendments were
offered .and voted down, and many
lies, were made, the vote was
tak->n upon the Cannon substitute to
reduce the number of battle-ships to
one and to increase the torpedo-boats
and torpedo-boat destroyers to twelve
each, It was. defeatedâ 7S to 124.
; Underwood <D.) of Alabama offered
an amendment appropriating $4,000,000
for the establishment of a Government
armor-plate factory. He did not think
it proper with a war cloud over th*
country to criticize the price fixed in
the bill -for armor plate, but his amend
ment looked to the future. Before the
battle-ships authorized in the bill werr
completed the Government could save
the extortion to which it was now sub
jected. . It went briefly into the results

the cost of armor plate, to show that

LONDON, April l.â-The Vienna eor
j. respondent of the Daily Telegraph
r says: There is still some hope that the

difficulty consists in finding an accept

her preparations. It is believed, how
ever, that Spain will fail to gain a
naval victory in the event of a battle
off Cuba.
The editorials in the morning papers
on the text of the apparently inevitable
war continue to advise Spain to yield
to. harsh necessity, and express hopes
that the delay until Monday will enable
a peaceable solution.

PURSUIT OF BANDITS
CLIFF REGAN AND PAL
Officers Having a Hard Time to Locate the Bold

of Sontag and Evans.
INDIAN GULCH, Cal., April I.â
Hardly a road of the territory within
ten miles of Schultz Mountain escaped
the scrutiny of over a score of deter
mined man hunters to-day, but no
trace of the Cross Creek bandits was
found. The Sheriffs are working south
ward in the search for Cliff Regan and
his mysterious pal, who are now be
coming known in the foothills as the
new Evans and Sontag. The country
in the neighborhood of where the two
bandits were last seen is being pa
trolled day and night by determined
man hunters, and every moment they
are expecting to get some new trace of
their quarry.
The pursued men are known to have
but little foood. All they got when
they broke into the cabin of a miner
on Tuesday night last was a small
piece of bacon, about three pounds of
flour, a handful of salt and some cof
fee, and that would not last them long
even on the most limited rations.
The pursuing Sheriffs and their depu
ties expect that both of the bandits are
in hiding in this vicinity. They will be
forced to come from their coyer for
food. Nearly every cabin in the district
is guarded and every resident of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 1.
Supplementing the action taken yes
terday by the Navy Department in re
questing the Governors of States to
drill and equip the naval militia so as
to be ready for any emergency, Assist
ant Secretary Roosevelt to-day sent
letters to the Governors of those sea
coast States not having such organiza
tions, to take steps looking to the form
ation of naval militia so far as is pos
sible under the State laws. It is hoped
by the naval officials that each of these
States will be enabled to promptly ac
quiesce in the department's request,
and be prepared to assist in the naval
auxiliary work.
Those coast States not having naval
neighborhood has been instructed to re
port to the officers the. presence of any
strangers answering the description of
the hunted men. The man-hunters ex
pect to hear of the whereabouts of the
robbers again before . two more days
have passed, and they do not expect to.
capture the men without a tight.
Constable M. Bauer of Hornitos re
turned from the chase to-day. He. had
been south as far as. White Rock and
was at the Postoffice there when the
weekly mail was distributed. None of
the ranchers or miners in the district
had seen or heard of the bandits being
in their neighborhood.
Bauer was of thÂ«> opinion that the
robbers must be in hilling in one of the
numerous caves of Schnltz Mountain
or that they had doubled on their trail
and were again in the vicinity of the
Three Buttes, and close to the spot
where they were first surprised by the
officers and forced to abandon their
nurse and buÂ«"<Â»y and camp outfit.
Constable Tom Mack of Merced has
left for (Jrub Gulch on a line almost di
rect from here and distant about fifty
miles. His mission is to notify thn set
tlers of that district of the crime of the
robbers and warn them of the sup
posed approach of the bandits. About
the time Mack left here on his mission
Deputy Sheriffs Yoa'cum and s. Dick
inson of Merced started for the same
militia organizations are Maine. Npw
Hampshire, Delaware, Texas and Ala

letter sent to the officials of those
States which already have naval mili

those on the coast, and the second to

"The department requests that you

PHILADELPHIA, April 1. â The
United States cruisor Minneapolis
sailed from League Island Navy Yard
early this morning, bound for Hampton
Roads, where she will join the flying
| squadron. The bunkers of the Minne
j apolis are overflowing with coal, and
during the past few days all of her
ammunition has been placed aboard, so
that she is ready for action. The Min
neapolis was recently placed in the
! drydock and her bottom thoroughly
cleaned and painted. This condition
' makes it possible to get all the speed
out of the big ship there is in her.
The departure of the Minneapolis
' leaves only two modern warships at
'â¢ League Island, the double-turret moni
, tor Miantonomoh and the harbor de
fense ram Katahdin. The former will
sail in about a day or two, and the
Katahdin probably soon thereafter.
Work is going on day and night on the
old monitors, and five of them are
practically ready for sea.
The Minneapolis anchored at Deep
Water Point, off Newcastle Del at
9:20. She will probably wait for high
tide this afternooon before proceeding
The Minneapolis made the run from
Marcus Hook to Newcastle, about
twenty-five miles, in a little over an

APPEAL TO
PRESIDENT
McKINLEY
Autonomists Ask Him Not
to Interfere in the
Island*
Say the Great Majority of the
People Are in Favor of Home
Rule Under Spain's
Sovereignty.
WASHINGTON, April I.â The Cuban
Government (meaning thereby the
present home rule authorities in Cuba,
and not the insurgents) have appealed
to the President of the United States
to respect the will of the majority of
the people of Cuba. The appeal is as
follows:
The Colonial Government of Cuba de- :
sires to make known to the President of
the United States that, although there,
are some' Cubans in arms, yet there are
an immense number, who . accept home,
rule and are resolved to . work zealously
under this form of Government in order
to re-establish peace and . prosperity to
the land.. The insurgents form a: minority,:
While the autonomists represent the ma
jority, of the interests of civilization by
means. of justice and liberty. The Cuban
people is an American people, and. has,
in consequence, a perfect right to. gov
ern itself according to. its own wishes and
aspirations, and in no way would it be
just for a foreign will to impose upon it
a political . regime which it esteems con
trary to its happiness and: conscience.
This would be to substantiate oppression
â¢instead, of liberty. -The. Cuban .people is
now a free people; it wishes to rule its
own destinies, and it would be a great
wickedness to dispose of its lot Without
its consent. The history and the. feeling
of .the- United' States do not permit an
American. â  people to be- sacrificed ..and
forced .to form a government, which the
same people consider pernicious to its per
manent â  . Interests ' and -to the cause of
peace and. order in a- country of different
races; of - small. : population and whose
political education is yet incomplete. ' 'â¢ â¢
The Honorable Government of Cuba
hopes' that the President : bf. the. [Jnited
States, faithful" to the noble, traditions, of
the great. North American republic, will
consider and respect' .the rights 1 of the
:Cuban' people, not. permitting violence to
prevail;- it. also hopes that he will con-:
.tribute by powerful action to re-establish
â¢.peace in Cuba under the sovereignty of
the mother country, and with a hQjie'rule:
government equal for all and which
might be still improved so as to inspire
the confidence of everyone. â¢ The home
rule government of this island, which, is
a Cuban Government, . protests ' energet
ically against th-e falsehoods; of a part of
the American press, published with the :
â¢malignant intention of tiring â  passions,
making it â¢ appear â  that . injustice and
brutal force reign, in :Cuba, and that home
.rule has fallen before even the 'colonial
Parliament has taken its. seat, and when
experience cannot â : yet tell whether : the
new regime will answer or not. There is
no good.f aith in these stories. â â â 'As . was

esty is the best policy." . : â  ..-.:-,..

- cation is about half way between the

./ -there in the snow. I learned very little
about the ground, though it was ; re-
ru>rtr-d quite rich, from 40 to 7u cents

understand, has been done on Lake

think only a few holes have been sunk
on either. On the trail this side there
is considerable excitement over the
creeks, but not so much, I think, as
thorp is at Skaguay, Dyea and on this

to make any locations, but my opin
ion is that they have found something
in there. No man can see into the
ground. The police say the ground is
rich."
Dr. Slayden said further: "The big

has had in a long time occurred on
February 16. It was to Swede Creek,

call it Twelve-Mile Creek. This started
at 11 o'clock at night. It almost elec
trified a man to look at it. He is a
cool one who can keep his feet to the
ground and stand still when any kind
of a stampede starts. The excitement
will almost wake up a dead man. I
had to go back home and shut myself
in several times, particularly from join
ing the Swede Creek rush. The Lord
only knows how they start. They just
open out like an umbrella and about as
quick. Men rush to their cabins, get a
few things together including a little
grub. On this occasion some actually
struck out in their shirt sleeves. Others
came along later with dog teams and
they often have to bring the other fel
lows back. In the stampede to Swede
Creek five men lost their lives. One
was frozen to death, the four others
were so frost-bitten â hands, feet, face
and ler *â that they died afterward. It
was impossible to save them. I do not

VERY RICH GROUND
AROUND GOLD LAKE
Judge Johnson Tells How General
Willey Turned Up Wonderful
Deposits Near Sitka.
JUNEAU, Alaska, March 28 (by Steamship Queen to Seattle, April
I).â Further particulars of the reported rich ground on Paude Basin,
surrounding Gold Lake, have been obtained from United States District
Judge C. S. Johnson, \yho is a firm believer. It stems that some of
the heaviest gold-bearing gVound In Alaska has now been turned up
near Sitka. -he Judge's official residence is at Sitka and he Is there
nearly all the time. He said: . . â¢
"It's all right, you need not have any doubt about it. I can tell
you how General Willey, and he Is a Californian, went about it: He
divided off a large section into equal squares. Then he dug holes down
through the snow arid took out a quantity of gra el from each. The
assay ;you know about It averaged, I was told by General Willey, $450
jto the; ton. It is a :so.rt of gravel and decomposed quartz. I cannot re
call the mineral name for it. It is bonded, it is true, but th-re seema
to be no do-bt.of the value of the assays."
Paude Basin ;is little more than 160 acres in area, including Gold
Lake. T General Willey's specimens were taken from a portion of the
iiarro\y encircling shore. The -plan has always been to drain Gold
Lake >.nd work -ie ground forming the bottom of it. This can be
done by a tutinel,- but it would cost considerable money. With much
ground -running .$.450 ;on. ah â average to the ton, some of it assaying
. $900, . money ought to cut little figure in the draining of the ".-ike. The
exrSurveyor-Gfeneral 6t California believes he has a mighty good thing.
I)ietails axe not to be had till the arrival, of th~> steamship George W.
Elder ;fn two or three days. The distance from Sitka to the basin is
about thirteen miles.: The report here is that the whole thing is bonded
or taken up. The rich results will doubtless lead to an increased in
terest in prospecting glacier and other lakes over to the westward.

The convention between the United
States and Great Britain in regard to
the Alaska boundary line, recently an
nounced, settles the question of any in- i
terriational difficulty arising over the !

vention.that summit is now understood
to be Canadian territory:
Complications may arise, however.
: by the proposed stationing of a United
States inspector at Luke Bennett, as
the Collector of Customs for Alaska,
J. .W. Ivey; declares it is his intention
to do.
Governor John :G; Brady and Col
lector iVey climbed the steep and
hoary Chilkoot last week to see that
Canadian post, its police and the citi
zens of the United States en route to
the Klondike marching meekly under
the British Union Jack as it floats
proudly there. Some conversation ob
tained between the Governor, the Col
lector and Captain Belcher of the post,
a six-foot Canadian with a mountain
voice, in which the captain blandly
told the Alaskan officials that he had
been ordered there by his superior offi
cer, and there he intended to stay. In
his turn Collector. lvey stated that his
intention was equally firm to establish
United States inspectors at the Lakes.
Captain Belcher did not say that he
would try to prevent their coming, but
he replied that he would see that the
United States officers did not remain
there Jong. And there you are. The
situation as it stands amounts to a
declaration of war between these offi
cials, and it now remains for Assistant.
Secretary Day and Lord Salisbury to
come to the rescue of their respective
countries in the threatened hostilities
at the lakes which run down the land

BENCH SHOW
A Remarkable Collection
of Some Beautiful
Canines.
Prize Dogs in the Various
Classes Capture Honors
in the Competition.
Many Ladies Hava Exhibited Their
Pets and They Have Not
Been Overlooked.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April I.â The opening of
the bench show circuit of IS9B h.is
been celebrated at San Jose with
great eclat. The combination of the
Santa Clara Valley Poultry and Ken
nel Club and the California Collie Club
has proved an unqualified success. The
entries numbered 167, and the dogs
benched 151. The attendance has been
greatly beyond expectation.
The awarding of the special for the
ugliest dog in the show caused great
amusement, , for the prize was award
ed to David Sinclair, the clerk of the
San Francisco Kennel Club. Insult was
added to injury, for the gentleman re
ceived a bag of sawdust Instead of a
sack of flour.
According to breeds, the entries were
as follows: Mastiffs, 4; St. Bernards,
19; Greyhounds, 3; Foxhounds, 3; Point
ers, 3; all Setters, IB; Danes, 8; all
Spaniels, 14; Collies, 61; Bull dogs, 5;
Bull terriers, 4; Fox terriers, 13; all
other breeds, 9.
It is safe to assert that there has
never been a show at which less grum
bling was in evidence than at this one.
Mr. Xairns, the judge, has given gen
eral satisfaction, but he has too fre
quently tempered his justice with
mercy. In fact, leniency In judging
seems to be his predominant charac
teristic. He Judged fairly, according
to his lights, and was conscientious
and painstaking; his faults were on
the right side. Of course the great
test of his ability came with the collie
class, which constituted a third of the
entire show. He acquitted himself
with a skill that justifies his own suc
cess as a breeder, though his laxity in
regard to prick ears was at times pain
fully apparent. Still, one must not be
hypercritical. It was quite an educa
tion to stand In the parlors of the St.
James Hotel, the headquarters of the

revolved around the doer. In fact It

STRUGGLE FOR
THE BODY OF A
DEAD SENATOR
While Mrs. Snyder Claims the Remains of
John S. Enos the Widow Gets an In
junction Preventing Inter
ment. .
SONOMA, April I.â Funeral services were held this morning at 11
o'clock over the remains of the late Senator John S. Enns at the
residence of Mrs. R. J. Snyder, at which place he dropped dead last
Wednesday morning-. Many of the dead man's friends gathered to
view the corpse and hear the impressive sermon delivered by Rev.
R. Wylie of Napa, The last will and testament of the deceased was
opened beside the bier and read by ex-Senator Pinder of San Fran
cisco. In the will $5000 is left to. the dead Senator's daughter, Mrs. Ger
tie C. Willis, his gold watch and chain to his nephew, John Summerfield
Enos, and all the remainder of the property to his. friend, Mrs. R. % Sny
der. It also reads that Mrs. Snyder is to take charge of the remains
and dispose of them at her will. Attorney Lippitt of Petaluma is
named as executor without .bonds. A request is also made in the doc
ument that he should not be burled until four days after his death,
and it is signed by Attorney Charles A. Garter of San Francisco.: .
The body is still at the residence of Mrs. Snyder, who holds pos
session of it. The holding of these services, however, does not settle
the sensational question of what will be done with the body and who
is the legal claimant. When Senator Er.os left his wife about eight
years ago he broke all connection with her and his daughter, Mrs.
Willis, and refused to recognize either of thorn, .although there was
never a divorce granted! Since then he has resided the greater por
tion of his time with Mrs. Snyder on her ranch, one mile east of this
place, while his wife has resided in San Francisco. â¢ . .
SANTA ROSA, April I.â The sad, strange spectacle of a wife strug
gling for possession of the lifeless body of a husband she could not
hold while living, a noble daughter endeavoring to do all remaining
in her power to preserve the few straggling remnants of a father's
reputation and save his memory from being perpetuated in a role in
which he seemed almost to glory while alive and well, was presented in
the courts here to-day. The story back of it all is one of the strang
est in the history of the State.
Last Wednesday ex-Senator John S. Enos, one of the best-known
residents of this part of the State, where he had lived many years,
suddenly dropped dead. At the time of the sudden death he was just
entering the yard of Mrs. Rachael Jane Snyder, a rich and beautiful
widow, living near the historic old town of Sonoma, and with whom
his name has for years been linked by the whispered tales that fly
from ear to ear. In fact, this phase of the case was notorious through
out the entire section. The body was taken in charge and all arrange
ments for the funeral made, when Attorneys Haven and Haven of San
Francisco filed with the County Clerk papers in a startling proceed
ing. They, on behalf of their clients, prayed the court for an imme
diate injunction to prevent Mrs. R. J. Snyder, the defendant named in
the action, from burying the dead body of the ex-Senator, and to com
pel her to deliver the aforesaid remains into the possession of the plain
tiffs, Mrs. John S. Enos, Mrs. Gertrude C. Willis and William Willis.
The complaint alleges that the plaintiff, Mrs. Susie Enos, who uses
his name in the papers of the case, is the surviving widow of John
S. Enos, who died as related above; that the plaintiff, Gertrude C.
Willis, is a daughter and only child of the deceased; that the defend
ant, Rachael Jane Snyder, has in her possession the dead body of the
husband and father, 6aid John S. Enos, and has no moral or legal
claim on the same; that plaintiffs applied to said defendant for pos
session of the dead body of the deceased that it might be given hon
orable burial, whereupon said defendant refused to surrender to plain
tiffs, or either of them, possession of the dead body, but informed
them that she herself would superintend and direct the burial. The
complaint further alleges that the defendant, Mrs. Rachael Jane Sny
der, has no claim of any kind whatsover upon the body of the de
ceased; that upon the plaintiffs devolved the duties of burial and prep
aration for burial of the deceased, and that the defendant, Rachael
Jane Snyder, is preparing and threatening to bury said deceased upon
her own private premises and not in any cemetery whatever, and
will so bury him unless restrained and prevented by order of the court
The injunction prayed for was granted, and papers were served by-
Sheriff Allen at 2 o'clock this morning. By the terms of the order
made by the court. Mis. Snyder was directed either to turn the body
over to the plaintiffs forthwith, or at once appear in court, and show
cause why she should not do so.
Mrs. Snyder has refused to give up the body of the dead and bases
her claim to the right to retain the possession upon the following pro
visions of the will left by the deceased: "I direct that my body shall
not be burled until four days after my death, and that the manner
time and place of my burial shall be according to the wishes and direc
tion of Mrs. R. J. Snyder."
The case occasioned the greatest conceivable amount of comment in
this section. Both Enos and Mrs. Snyder have lived in this county
many years. . .-'':.
Mrs. Snyder, beautiful and rich, came first into notoriety some five
years ago, when her brother, Perry Sears, was on trial for the mur
der of his sister's foreman, John Reibli. On the occasion Mrs. Sny
der fought her brother with a hatred that was almost frightful, and
it is alleged used her every effort to either have him hanged or sent to
tho penitentiary. .
Attorney E. S. Lippitt of Petaluma was retained as special coun
sel by the sister to assist in the prosecution, and during the trial of
the case Sears is said to have used every effort to blacken his sis
ter's character. Since that time the relations between Enos and Mrs
Snyder have been common talk. A short time ago, it is said, Enos had
about arranged to be taken back by Mrs. Enos, an estimable lady but
failed to go when the time came.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DALLAS, Tex., April I.â A special to
the New,s from Waco, Tex., says: In
the midst of busy preparations for city
election meetings, while bands were
playing 1 and scattering handbills from
their decorated vans, calling the people
together, W. C. Brann, editor of the
Iconoclast, and . Captain M. T. Davis
met and fought a revolver duel to the
death. The combatants met just at 6
o'clock this afternoon on Fourth street,
in front of the Cotton Belt ticket office,
end, after exchanging a few words,
both began emptying their revolvers
Into each other's bodies.
When the battle was over, Brann was
found to be perforated in the left lung,
the left leg an,d the right foot. Davis
was shot through the right lung and
through both of his arms. The sur
geons say both men are likely to die.
The difficulty between the two men
grew out of the Brann-Baylor feud of
last year. Captain Davis' daughters
are pupils of Baylor University, and
the references made in the Iconoclast
to Baylor, which were generally con
strued to mean reflections on the moral
character of the pupils and faculty,
brought forth from Captain Davis a
denunciation of Brann, delivered In
language most forcible and direct. In
the city campaign now in progress
Captain Davis is the chairman of one

of the committees, and was active all
day in the duties that the position en
tailed. Election day is close at hand
and excitement is high. Brann waÃ an
advocate of the candidate Captain
Davis was seeking to defeat, and that
Btate of affairs contributed to no small
extent to the meeting.
Politics, however, was not the chief
cause, by any means. About a month
ago, before the city campaign opened
a friend of Brann's referred to him in
complimentary terms in the presence
of Captain Davis, and nearly provoked
a row then and there. Remarks on
that occasion made by Captain Davis
as to the Iconoclast and its editor
were repeated, it is said, in Brann's
hearing, and Brann's rejoinder was
carried to Captain Davis. This epi
sode stirred up the men against each
other and increased the bitterness be
tween them, which began when the
Brann-Baylor trouble arose and greAv
intense when the Gerald-Harris trag
edy occurred last November. It was
often predicted that when Brann and
Captain Davis met there would be
bloodshed, Captain Davis being a fear
less man and ready on all occasions to
express himself.
The publications of Brarin against
Baylor University wounded him deeply
and he took every occasion to make
his feeling known. This afternoon
Brann and his business manager, W
H. Ward, were opposite the street to
gether, goi-ng in the direction of
French's bookstore, Captain Davis
office being between the bookstore and
the Cotton Belt office. When Brann
and Ward reached the front of the
bookstore Captain Davis was in front
of his office. The words that passed
between them were words of reproach
and they lost no time in getting- out
their weapons.
About ten seconds were occupied in
the shooting, at the end of which Brann
and- Davis lay bleo<Hng and W II
Ward, Brann'a business manager was
shot through the right hand, the bones
being shattered.
A wild bullet hit Motorman Kennedy
on the knee. Kennedy was passing on
his car. Another wild bullet hit Eu
gene Kepler in the foot. The wild bul
let wounds are not serious. Kepler
and his partner, Prince, are touring the
world on a wager and had just reached
Waco. A reporter visited Brann after
he was shot. He was at home on a
couch surrounded by surgeons, his in
tellectual face as white as snow. His
wife any many friends were with him.
He is too weak to talk and is proba
bly past ffurgery, although the doctors
say there is some slight chance for his
recovery.
Captain Davis was taken to the Pa
cific Hotel nnd is regarded as mortally
wounded, his right lung being cruelly
lacerated. Both men are bleeding in
ternally and are faint. At a late hour
both men were alive, but appeared to
be sinking.

ly Improved the prospects of Carson
v. In all the valley there are no
attle for sale. All have been dis
posed of and at excellent prices. For
d;iys past two and three carloads of
cattle a day have been shipped from
:>Te. Hundreds of tons of hay have
been sent out of ihe valley within the
past month at prices more than double
what Carson Valley ranchers received
lu.Totofore.
The quality of timothy hay raised
near Carson is of a peculiar v.xcellence.
Once upon a time Haggin & Tevis be
lieved it economy to get the supply
for their racing stable from Carson,
though it cost them $200 a ton by the
time it had reached New York. Ne
vada's capita] is not dependent for its
prosperity upon the mills or the mines,
the State and national institutions or
the farming country, of which it is tho
center. It is the condition of all these
interests united which disposes the Car- (
sonite to believe that the turning point '
has be^n reached and prosperity lies
staight ahf ad. Carson possesses all the
attractions with which Nevada en- j
dowa her most favored cities. It has f
the river and the mountains. It is i
level ;md tree-shaded. Its supply of '
spring water comes from the
ntaina behind. It is well known '
that when Nevada waterâ like a cer- j
tain celebrated little girl who wore
curlsâ -is good, it is very good. And
n's is of the best. As i<~> the
Lte of Nevada's capitalâ though it
Lced itself and Nevada last March i
trnishing what is now known as
prizefight weatherâ the physician at j
ate's Prison, located here, reports
â -hat in four years there has been but;]
:tMth among the eighty convicts. !
I arson's climate is at least as mer
to the just as to the unjust.
ANENT HoME ENTERPRISE.
It is years since this particular %ec
tiqn >>f Nevada has been in condition
anything like what it is to-day. A
u.-r!< ago Carson organized an im
ement club, to which the best men j
ir tho town belong. The club proposes .:
.iid up the place, to encourage
Ivome trade, to reach a 'lo.OOQ mark in
population. Years ago Carson women
:-'!M'osed it impossible to supply their
households and their wardrobes here.
They sent outside the State for gowns
â  .! bonnets and furniture. Nowadays
patronize Ormsby County mer
tis; as a result the Carson store
rs are keeping a better class of
Is and their prices are more reas-
The merchants have become
:iatred to reach out for more busj- j
They advertise nowadays fully
twice as much as they used to. And
the next link in the commercial chain,
the newspapers, are issuing extra edi
tion?âan innovation heretofore un
known in Nevada â and increasing their
circulations throughout the country.
The Pine Nut excitement comes just
at the right time to lift Carson upon !
a wave of success. Within three days :
2000 acres of land have been taken up
near what was known as the Zirn
mine, twenty miles from Carson, where
a pocket of ore assaying $60,000 a ton
was found some years ago, and "old
Zirn," as Carsonites call the discoverer,
made his fortune. And then a sudden
end came to the golden tale. For min
ers hitherto at Pine Nut have been
repeating the experience of the ,
early Comstock miners, with this
difference, that the Pine Nut prospec- .
tbrs have been seeking for quartz and
scorning placer.
ORMSBY COUNTY'S MINES.
On California placer mines that pay
IS or 20 cents to the cubic yard divi
dends have been declared. The Pine
Nut gravel extends over 700 acres to a :
depth of more than 60 feet and is worth
$4 a cubic yard. If Pine Nut were lo
cated near Dawson City there'd be a j
stampede up at the Klondike. People
In Carson are deeply Interested in the ,
Pine Nut region. They may well be; j
for if half what is claimed for these !
wonderful placers Is true, Carson's <
Improvement Club will have to raise !
its mark. Ten thousand people will not |
content it two years from now.
An Interesting fact in connection
with the Pine Nut mines is the pres
ence in Carson of James M. Wishart
of Oakland, the inventor of a goid-Bav~J
ing machine, a sort of improved rocker
which the management of the Pine Nut
mines will adopt, provided that tests
to be made early next week at the j
mines shall be as satisfactory as those >
FAVORS THE
CABLE PLAN
Hawaii's Legislature Has
a Bill for Aiding the
Company.
Permission Under Certain Con
ditions Granted the Pacific
Promoters.
According to the Scheme the Rates to
Japan Will Be 9O Cents and
Here 33 Cents a Word.
SpÂ«"-!ai Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, March 24.â A bill has
been introduced in the Hawaiian Sen
ate to authorize the construction of a
cable by the Pacific Cable Company,
known as the Scrymser Company,
whose bill in Congress was favorably
reported on by a committee of the
House several weeks ago.
The bill gives the exclusive cable
rights to the islands for twenty years.
H must be laid within eighteen months
the passage of the act by the
American Congress, and extended to
Japan within three years. It must be
capable of transmitting fifteen words
a minute. The rate between here and
the United States is not to exceed 35
cents a word and to Japan not to ex
â 'i W) cents. In case of v-ir the Presi
dent may seize the cable and exclude
all messages he sees fit. A guarantee
of $2fÂ»,000 in Government bonds is to be
put up by the company.
In accordance with the recommenda
tion of President Dole and the Senate
ncÂ« Committee the salaries of the
cabinet ministers have been increased
from ?4000 a year to $GOOO.
The Senate has massed a bill relating
to the registry of foreign-built vessels.
It rf-strliis the issuance of registers of
vessels to citizens or corporations not
having a place of business and having
'â  made on Carson's principal street a
week ago. The machine saves all the
fine gold by a: unique mechanical con
trivance. It requires only a cr.-nstant
flow of 2^ inches of water to work
seventy yards of gravel In twenty-four
hours. Five tons of gravel an hour
was the rate at which the machine
worked, and repeated tests failed to
show a trace of gold in the tailings.
"If this Wishart ma.chine will do â¢
at Pine Nut what it has done in Car
son," said the secretary and treasurer
of the new company, "'its adoption at
Pine Nut is assured." ..
But Pine Nut with all its marvelous
possibilities is not Ormsby County's
one mineral hope. The mines at Buck
eye, ten miles away,; are attracting
much attention. There are 1640 acres
of the Buckeye property which will av
erage $1 a cubic yard. Out of 600 cubic
yards $1392 worth of the gold flakes
Carsonites are admiring as bottled ex
hibits just now was obtained. And to
day comes news of a strike at Jumbo,
twenty-two miles in the other direction
from Oarsan. On the streets the rumor
is that $5000 to the ton is the quality of
the ore taken out. There seems to be
a belt of placers half encircling this
valley. And with the development, the
awakened interest in mining another
Comstock, a golden one, is one of the
probabilities.
FROM SAGEBRUSH TO SUGAR
BEET.
The Alpine Land and Reservoir Com
pany is another cause that will aid in
the development of Western Nevada.
The most capable men in Carson are ;
carried on such business within the re
public for the two years' immediately
preceding such application for registry.
Declaration must also be made by cor
porations, as for individuals, that no
aliens are interested in the vessel or
its profits or issues, except those who
may own capital stock of such corpora
tion. The act is not to affect existing
registers.
One registration case is now pending
and several more applications are ex
pected within a week. Colonel Macfar
lane some time ago asked for registry
for the Peter Jebsen, a Norwegian ves
sel of 1000 tons, now in the Nanaimo
coal trade. The Amorapoora, now fly
ing the British flag, will also ask for a
Hawayan register.
The United States steamship Mohican
arrived on the 19th, nine days from
San Francisco. She brought ammuni
tion and supplies for the naval vessel
at this port. The United States steam
ship Baltimore will leave for Hongkong
this afternoon or early to-morrow
morning.
Captain John Good, who was dis
honorably discharged from the Ha
waiian military service about two years
ago. has asked President Dole for a new
trial, on the ground of newly discovered
evidence. Captain Good claims that he
can exonerate himself and asks for a
court'of inquiry.
The legislators in the Senate will not
listen to the terror-stricken cries of
warning sent forth by their qunodam
supporters of the American League of
the close approach of next year's elec
tion, and the inevitable destruction of
the annexation party, and possibly of
the republic, at the ballot-box in Sep
tember, 1899, when, to use the words of
the president of the league, "There will
be a deadly revolution, but not of bul
lets, but of ballots," which will sweep
away every legislator into political
oblivion who opposes the people's will
in their desire to make this a popular
republic instead of a military oligarchy
controlled by corporations of Asiatic
employing planters and the "family
compact."
The tremendous power wielded by
some of these plantations is aptly il
lustrated by an incident occurring in
the Supreme Court on Monday last.
A German contract laborer named
Johan Viercke, working at the Liliue
plantation (for which the imperial Ger
man Consul's firm is the Honolulu
agent) was taken before a district
magistrate on Kauai and sentenced for
the use of threatening language under
the grossest of provocations â he was a
married manâ to the luna or overseer.
He was brought to Oahu jail, and thoro
he might have lingered until he had
served his time of one year's imprison
ment, then to return to the plantation
and serve out another year for the one
lost in prison, had it not been for the

for exposing the situation at that
plantation), whose friends sued out a
writ of. habeas corpus.' The case was
well handled by Messrs. Humphreys
and Gear, the latter a brother of Rep
resentative Gear of the. United States
Congress, and the whole bar was in
tensely interested. Imagine the sensa
tion in court and the mortification of
the Justices of the Supreme Court, who
justly pride themselves upon the im
maculate administration . of our Ha
waiian laws, when it was ascertained
that the offense the man was charged
with was no offense at all within the
purview of our laws. And this was but
the first and weakest objection made to
the illegality of the conviction. Of
course the man was promptly liber
ated and left with his weeping wife
and child. And what redress has this
penniless, pitiful man? An appeal to
his Consul? He states that his Con
sul's (the plantation agent) reply to his
appeal was:. "Don't trouble me. You
know you are guilty and have behaved
bailly. Go back to the plantation im
mediately and go to work. H
(mentioning the name of the luna) has
another complaint to make against you
and you will again be arrested." The
Germans here., except the plantation
element,, are furiously indignant, and
the whole matter has been referred to
the Minister of Foreign Affairs at
Berlin.

People of Virginia City Feel That a.
Turning Point In the Comstock
Has Been Reached.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VIRGINIA CITY, April I.â One of the
most important events that has oc
curred in the later history of the Corn
stock mines was consummated In San
Francisco on Thursday last, and news
of it has just reached here. On that
day representatives of the seven great
mining companies of the Comstock met
Franklin Leonard, the president of the
Sutro Tunnel Company, and an agree
ment was reached by which the differ
ences heretofore existing between the
mining companies and the tunnelpeople
were settled, and an amicable arrange
ment entered into by means ot which.
members of this company, which Is |
headed by the Governor uf this State, i
! The company owns 5000 acres of land :
i in Douglass and Ormsby counties which j
! will be worth from $20 to $50 an acre j
I when irrigated. The company's reser- j
voir is in Alpine County; and despite;
j the pooh-poohing of capitalists whose ;
j enterprise consists in banking their .
! money, steps will be taken within the i
j near future to change a sagebrush em- ;
: pire into farms which will support 2000
i farmers. Sugar-beets is to be the
watchword of the Alpine Company
! after the necessary $50,000 has been â¢
; raised to buy up rights of way, etc. The
! late Governor Jones superintended ex- I
! perimental planting of beets in various
! parts of Nevada. It was found that
â  beets raised in this sagebrush land pro
i duce 1" ncr cent sugar, 5 per cent more
1 than the average on the coast.. The
! comparative cheapness of the land
I here, the vast territory which will be â¢;
: irrigated from the company's reservoir '.
seem to assure Nevada's pre-eminence j
as a future beet-sugar country.
THE OCCIDENTAL COLONY.
A most interesting experiment in col- j
onization is furnished by the Occiden- j
tal colony in Smith's Valley forty miles ;
from here. The colony has been in j
existence six months. It consists of i
sixteen familiesâ over eighty people, j
Each member of the colony paid $150
into the common fund. They incorpor- ,
! ated, elected officers to serve them, who
I receive $1 a dayâ jur,t as every mem- i
i ber of the colony does, who works and
1 earns that sum. In the half year these i
the various mines along the lode enter
into a sort of partnership with the tun
nel company.
There were present at the meeting
Charles H. Fish, representing the Con
solidated California and Virginia; Su
perintendent Kervin for the Gould and
Curry; George W. Wells for the Sav
age 1 H. M. Gorham for the Chollar and
Potosi, and W. E. F. Deal, the attor
ney for the Best and Belcher and Hale
& Norcross, besides President Leonard.
Concessions were made on both sides.
President Leonard has always been de
sirous of bringing about this union of
interests between the mines and the
tunnel which will practically give the
Comstock a new lease of life, and
whose ultimate effect is likely to be far-
reaching.
Negotiations have been going on in
this connection for the past two years.
Contracts have been all but signed,
only to be abatidoned. Proposals for a
compromise have been rejected first by
one side and then the other, and the
Comstock, divided against itself, was
threatened with extermination. The
papers which are being prepared by
Attorney Tausky are to be submitted
for the signatures of the various com
panies and to President Leonard. Then
they are to be sent on to New York
for the approval of the directors of the
tunnel company.
The success of the plan is highly
probable, and that the various parties
interested have been able to reach so
satisfactory a conclusion is the best
news that Comstockers have heard in
years. The working of the upper levels
of the Comstock mines, the carrying off
of waste rc-ck through the Sutro tunnel,
is the natural, the most direct and eco
nomical mode of procedure. Where the
tunnel taps the Brunswick lode, the
territory which has been in dispute,
there's ground worth fighting for. Hap
pily for Virginia City, the powers that
hold its fate in their hands have come
to a peaceable settlement, and people
here feel that a turning point in the
affairs of the Comstock have been
reached. __________________
MUTUAL RESERVE SUSTAINED.
! An : Injunction to Prevent Collection
of Assessments Is Beaten. ;
NEW YORK. April 1. â The application
i of Charles Schoolhouse.a policy holder, of
! i the -Mutual Reserve Fund j Life Associa
! tion, foi an injunction to restrain the as
; sociation from collecting, its \ assessments
I as recently ; reapportioned , came up ; for

; the facts and of : the ; legal ; questions mi
i . volved \ the , court â¢. refused to grant ;an i in

tiff as a policy holder had no standing
'to â > maintain such 'an action ; that i it ; did
4 not appear that the plaintiff load, euffer.ea
people have spent In Smith's Valley
these . hard-working empire-builders
have constructed a tunnel 440 feet long,
only seven men being spared from the
fields for three months' time to per
fect the difficult task. Before this the
ditch that supplies their land "was con
tinually failing them. Now a splendid
provision of water is assured. At pres
ent they have 100 acres in wheat. 300
acres of alfalfa, and an apple orchard
which will yield $1500. They have filled
the school at Wellington with their
children. The success of the Occiden
tal colony is instructive. They have had
hard times. It has taken the closest
economy to reach the point where they
are now. They have still to live
through the months till harvest time.
The construction of that tunnel has vir
tually been the sacrifice of 100 tons of
produce that might have been raised.
But they are people of determination,
of exceeding industry. The 5300 acres
they own are capable of supporting
them all most comfortably. They have
ten years' time to pay the $12,000 they
owe. But in six months they have
practically created $5000 worth of prop
erty. The end of their first year here
will see the end of the worst of their
struggle for existence, and hundreds of
families in California, Dakota, Ne
braska and Pennsylvania, who are
watching and waiting for the assur
ance of the permanence of the Occiden
tal colony, will follow in the footsteps
of these men and women.
A great point for the success of col
onization In Nevada is the fact that
the Central Pacific Railroad has over-
or was In danger of such an injury as
would entitle him to an injunction; that
all of the allegations of the plaintiff were
â fully denied and overcome by the de
fendant's affidavits; and "because the
granting of an injunction Would be pro
ductive of great mischief and injury to
the association in the. prosecution of its
business.

OTHER AIDS TO PROSPERITY.
At Carson are located many State
and national institutions, the combined
appropriations for which amount to
many tens of thousands of dollars an
nually. The State Orphan Asylum, the
j State Prison, an Indian school, the car
shops of the Virginia and Truokee Rail
road, the Mint, the State printing of
; flee are among those that contribute tn
the prosperity of the town. Recently
the amount of borax and so :1a shipped
to California and the East lia.s in
creased considerably. Carson's boat
factory competes with those of Cali
fornia, supplying Riverside and Red
lands with boxes for all their oranges*
and sending boxes even to South
America. Carson Valley potatoes re
ceived first premiums at Nmv Orleans*
at the Centennial, at the World's Pair.
New Orleans hotel keepers send fop
their supply of- potatoes ail the way to
Sagebrushlahd.; An Ormsoy County
farmer shipped a carload of apples taÂ»
.Scotland a few weeks ago. The flour
mill here is turning out fifty barrels a
day. Three new brick stores have been
erected lately^ Carson'y athletic club
ij flourishingi numbering over a hun
dred members and supporting a gym
nasium from which, it is the purpose
of the club, decisions in matters ath

new code of rules; and when once a
pugilist is ruled out of the ring by thÂ«
Carson Club his standing as a prize
fighter will be forever forfeited.
Such is the extent of the city's pros
perity that the CarsOn Appeal â after
twenty years of kerosene lightingâ has
introduced gas into its office and there

âif the mines of Pine Nut prove all

ST. HELENA, April I.â A fierce
mountain fire has been burning for near
ly a week on the McÃuer property,
two miles from town. A great deal of
timber has been destroyed, and several
dwellings are in danger unless the prog
ress of the flames is checked. The fire
is moving toward Sulphur Springs, and
should it reach that place nothing could
be done to prevent the destruction of the
buildings, as there is no fire apparatus
there. A smaller fire is burning on the
mountains between here and Calistoga
and threatens to do much damage.

THE EBBING OF THE TIDE,
' I ' HAT travel toward Alaska is falling off is. ari |
I established fact, and people are trying to ac- j
* count for it. One reason given is the prbSpfec- :
tive war with Spain. It is far from being acceptable. !
When a man becomes inoculated, with the gold fever â 
he is riot .likely to stay at home for the purpose of]
shouting for the old flag, nor give up tlie prospect j
of. a fortune so as to be enabled to get a slash from
an unfriend.! y machete. It is. not : difficult ; 'to. undefV
stand, however, that the stories of death along
northern trails, of starvation attd frost, and. the
gloomy reports of those who vainly sought to win
glittering plenty there, ntjght easily, tend to check
the malady and at last clear the system entirely of: the
fever microbes. â  ;
COMMISSIONERS IN LUNACY;
BY reports from Sacramento it appears that the
State Commissioners in Lunacy, as a. result Jot
their consultation in this city, have .decided '
upon a. series of economies in. the asylunis of the
State which will result in saving, according to: pnÂ£
account, $14,000, and according to another $17,000,
annually. '."'â â ',-,â â  â¢â  ,y ; .. '\ â â 'â ':â 
A saving of such magnitude in State insthuiibns
voluntarily undertaken by the men who: have charge
.. of. them is something so unprecedented. that tq-'prac-*.]'
tical politicians it will seem like evidence that Com-. '
missibrrers. in Lunacy are very much the same as 'l
lunatic Commissioners. The seeming, . how-evef, is I
on the surface only. It appears frorii the â¢ details of |
the plan of economy proposed that as much cafe has]
been taken of the big men in the asylums and, the j
Commissioners themselves as the most astute tax- j
eater desire, and that the economies are to be i
. accomplished solely at the expense of the men. who
receive small salaries, and whose positions, being j
largely under civil seTvice regulations, are not avail
able for patronage.
The reports state the Commissioners have agreed
that the medical superintendents and assistant phy
sicians, all of -whom are now receiving good large j
salaries nnd free board and lodging at the asylums, j
are to get ah increase of pay amounting, to: $100 for j
each year's continuous service, and each 6f them is !
further allowed one servant at $25 a month. Thus;
far there is no saving to the State, Something had |
to be done to make up for the increase of pay to the â¢

at the expense of the commonwealth. The pruning
knife of cutting economy was therefore applied to j
the wages of the subordinate officials, and: the thing
was done. .--.' . ; ' . . "â â¢â¢' ;' 'â¢ â ' â  - â â¢,.
The Commissioners in Lunacy have followed, the
precedents that have prevailed in this world since
ever man was first given power to pay Peter at the ;
expense of Paul. The trick of showing generosity [
to one set of men by practicing economy on. another
is one of the accomplishments of men in authority
which was reduced to a fine art generations ago.
Nevertheless it has never become popular. A Lori
don fishwife when reproved for swearing at an eel
for squirming when she was $kinning it alive de
fended herself by saying that as she had been skin
ning eels for twenty years it was time for them to!
get used to it arid quit squirming,: The eels, how- I
ever, have never got used to it. Neither has man- <
. kind got used to the economic plan of skinning sub- â 
ordinates, which the Commissioners in Lunacy have '
seen fit to follow. They are still squirming. â¢ j
A few years ago Mr. Pullman tried the plan on an
extensive scale at the town of Pullman. In order to !
maintain the large salaries paid to the heads of de- j
partments in his business and at the same time save j
enough to enable him to give $100,000 to a church ;
for the worship of the good God, he reduced the!
wages of every workingman in his employ. The re- j
suit was that memorable squirm which agitated the I
whole nation and led to serious civil disturbance. !
It is evident, therefore,:; that this method of prac- 1
ticing economy is -trot acceptable to. the American
people. Californians will gladly. see a reduction of
expenditure*; in- the. various institutions of the State, j
but they will- not approve a plan which provides big j
officials with private servants, at the expense of the
State and takes the cost out of the pockets of men
who have been working for small wages and have
neither servants nor perquisites. â¢ " . â¢
If the policemen accused of cowardice prove them- â¢

THE PRESIDENT fIND THE CRISIS.
ALL reports from Washington lead to the con
. elusion that, the President has given ample
.. assurances to the. leaders of both houses that
there will be no delay, hesitation or weakness on the
part of the administration in dealing with the Cuban
crisis. The President has sent his demand to Spain
and has been waiting only for the answer.
That these assurances have been of the most ex
j plicit and definite kind is made evident by .the effect
they have had upon the majority in. both houses of
Congress. In the Senate the Committee on Foreign
Affairs has decided to make no report on the* war
! resolutions introduced during the week until Mori-
day, having determined to wait absolutely on the
, President's wishes. In the House the speeches of
i Thursday, taken in connection with the vote of the
1 preceding day 'on the Bailey resolution, show con
clusively that the Republicans of that body are in full
accord with the administration and are confident that
the message will be satisfactory to the party, the
people, the nation and the civilized world.
This confidence on the part of the members of
both houses, many of whom are in daily communi
cation with the President, is sufficient to give an
j equal confidence to the people at large. Mr. Gros
j venor, who is almost a personal representative of
the administration on the floor of the House, stated
!on Thursday: "Cuba will be free, and Cuba will be
free by the intervention of the United States. I
! would not give one cent for a declaration of inde
pendence unaccompanied by a further declaration.
What nonsense it would be to declare the island of
Cuba independent and then let her starve to death!
The thing to do in the case of Cuba is. to exhaust
all that diplomacy can. do to achieve her liberty and
independence, and, failing in that, stop not at the
half-way house the gentleman from Texas (Mr.
, Bailey) is talking about, but declare her indepen
i dent and accompany the declaration with an a-my
iand a navy to make our declaration worth some
! thing." â  ; â¢'.'
After that speech there can be little doubt of what
the event will bring forth. Either we are to have a
message announcing Spanish acceptance of our
terms, or. a message calling upon Congress to pre
pare for war. In either case Cuba will be free.
While all this is in itself gratifying to the people
and is satisfactory as far as it goes, there is still want
ing one thing, and that is a clearer expression of
what is to be done in regard to Spanish responsibility
for the destruction of the Maine. The majority of
the American people have noted with indignation
that both the. President and Congress have shown
an inclination to subordinate the Maine disaster, to
the Cuban crisis. That should not be done. The
war spirit of the American people was aroused not
by the reports of suffering in Cuba, but by the blood
of the victims of the Maine and by the treachery
and cowardly cruelty that caused their deaths. For
that crime the cry of justice and of patriotism is for
vengeance, and whatever may be done for Cuba the
message of the President will fall short of fully sat
isfying the country if it neglects this demand of the
popular heart.. . . =
THE PROFITS OF FORESTRY.

WE have referred to need of reserves. It
istration of the Federal forest reserves. It is
â¢â .\..'r' not : - unlikely : that in the future these re
:serves may yield a revenue needed by the treasury in
I excess of the . cost of. their administration. An ex
â¢ ample of this is furnished by the small kingdom of
. : I Bavaria, with 5.000,000 people in. an area only one
! fourth that of California. The Bavarian forests
j cover 34 per cent of her area, and are owned one
. third by the kingdom, half by private parties, and
' the' rest by villages and: other corporations, the total
â¢forest land being about 6,000,000 acres. Of this 46
I per cent is stocked with spruce and fir, which is har
j vested at an average age of 120 years. Of pine there
is 30 per ".cent, mostly used for firewood and har
vested at 80. years. The remainder is hardwood,
mostly beech,' harvested at 120 years, and white oak
for tanbark;- used at years.
â  The Forester, to which we are indebted for these
I facts, notes the yield per acre. "Groves 100 years old
! cut 10.000 cubic feet per acre. The poor and rocky
I mountain land yields 4000 cubic feet. In the
state forests the growth equals about sixty-one
j cubic feet per year, " so that they furnish an annual
i harvest of 120,000.000 cubic, feet of timber and fire
! wood. The private forests, due to less exact care,
grow at the rate of fifty-four cubic feet per acre per
; year-
The effect of superior care of the .state forests is
shown in the increase of annual growth. In 1829 the
cut was thirty-five cubic feet of wood over five
inches. â¢ In 1850 the cut was forty-four cubic feet, in
\ iB6O, forty-eight, and' in 1896 sixty cubic feet.
â  . In 1850' fully 84 per cent of this cut was firewood,
i but. this inferior class was only 67 per cent in 1880,
and the superior, cut is steadily increasing. The net
income of the state forests in 1850 was only $1 per
acre, but has increased to $1.92 per acre. This in
â  come on the state's forests of 2.091,930 acres amounts
now to nearly $4,000,000 annually over all expenses.
Of the cost. of administration only 10 cents, per
j acre, or 8 per cent of the income, is required for re
1 planting, while 50 per cent goes for supervision and
j 30 per cent for cutting and logging.
A steady supply of timber is furnished for hun
j . dreds of mills and cheap firewood to all the people
j from these preserved forests. The net income at a
I 3 per cent rate makes the state forest property worth
$130,000,000, or $65 per acre, while the land without
j forest would not be worth $10 per acre.
Measured by this example we may estimate the
j enormous. mine of wealth there is in our American
! forests. If they are properly preserved and cared
- J for their area may be constantly increased, their crop
i be made permanent, and the supply of timber, lumber
! and firewood made to increase every year to supply
i the wants of a growing population. Unless we adopt
I this policy our forest area will annually diminish.
I the supply decrease as the need of it increases, and
I the date of the total disappearance of American for
ests can be definitely fixed.
According to a yellow paper McKinley will go
"crashing down the ages." There is no reason to be
lieve it. The good old fashion of thundering down
has never been changed by legal enactment, and even
this fashion has not been generally followed. The
difficulty of either crashing or thundering, and keep
ing it up century after century, is apparent. New per
sons get born. Sonic of them grow up and develop a
desire to thunder or crash themselves, and they won't
let the bones of their ancestors get in the way of it.
Some of the stories about clever robberies per
petrated in Skaguay by "Soapy" Smith should break

taken for granted.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 2, 1898.
FOREIGN OBJECTIONS TO AMERICAN
PRODUCE.
f~* ONSULAR reports issued by the State De
l partment in the March volume contain an un-
usually large, number of reports of opposition
i-toi -to American imports into foreign countries, lhe most
j notable of these come from Scotland and Germany
and disclose not only a present antagonism to the
importation of goods from this country, but a feeling
that is likely to lead to further and more extensive
objections hereafter. . . . â¢ . â¢ â 
The opposition in Scotland is directed mainly
to imports of American beef. Our Consul at Edin
' burgh reports that at a recent meeting'of the directors,
of the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture a resolution
was adopted asking the Town Council of the city to
take steps to check or regulate the sale of foreign
meat brought from Glasgow. It appears that Scot
tish butchers and co-operative stores can obtain
American beef at 9 cents a pound, which is equally as
good as the home beef for which they have to pay 12
cents. There is a greatprotit therefore for the dealer in
handling the American product, and the local farmer
is in danger of losing his home market and with it
his industry.
It is to be noted that the canny Scots do not ask
Parliament for protectidn by a tariff, duty on im
ported beef, but seek it through the medium of
municipal regulations. The same plan is practiced
in Germany to escape the competition not . only of
our meats, but of our fruits. Thus in this volume of
reports there is a statement from Berlin that the
American Embassador, Mr. White, obtained a modi
fication of the recent decree of the Imperial Council
forbidding the importation of American fruit, and
that by this modification all dried fruit had been re
leased from the restrictions of the decree. â 
This report is essentially the same as that given
to the public by telegraph at the time the affair oc
curred. It appears, however, from the report of our.
Consul at Stuttgart that a municipal regulation has
been adopted in that city which forbids the sale of
dried fruit which contains traces of zinc, and gives
notice that dried fruit of American origin has been
found to be especially marked with such traces.
There are, it is evident, more ways than one by
which European producers can get rid of American
competition without involving their Governments
in a tariff war, and it remains to be seen what our
Government can do in the way of retaliation to
remedy the wrong.
Already it is said to be dangerous for Americans
in Havana. There are Spanish in the United States
in large number, but no peril threatens them. There
is a difference between civilization and the lack of it,
which difference this circumstance illustrates.
In defending his daughter's honor a citizen recently
shot five times at the villain in the case and never
touched him. If the necessity for. continuing the
brave defense of honor continue, it would be a good
idea for the father to arm himself with a club.
It is strange that the gamblers of Sacramento per
mit the police to remain in the city. However, the
police do not seem to have enough of a pull to se
riously promote public morals or interfere with the
game.
Registrar Biggy announces that he intends to run
his office on business principles. Perhaps this is all
right. But where has he found a precedent?
To have a Congress on his hands is a mere nothing
to Tom Reed. But that same Congress may tread
on his corns before he is through with it.
SfiN MATEO AND THE BOULEVARD.
MENLO PARK, April 1. 189*.
To the Editor of The Call-Sir: There has been
circulated in the County of San Mateo an address
purporting to be approved by a committee of.citi
zens of that county, formed to investigate a report
made by the County Surveyor and this commission
upon the proposition to issue $310,000 in bonds to
construct certain highways in said county.
As said circular is so misleading and contains
so many erroneous statements we believe it our duty
to the people of San Mateo County to answer same
through the public press. Those members of this
committee we have had the pleasure of meeting
namely, Henry W. Brown of Colma, who presided at
our meeting at that place; George C. Ross of Bel
mont who has written articles for the press of this
county in favor of the bond issue; Alex Moore of,
Pescadero who publicly stated at our meeting on the
30th ult that, having had the subject properly pre
sented to him. he was heartily in favor thereof and
would immediately go among his neighbors and ad
vocate the proposition; Percy W. Selby, who invited
us to the county and has been in accord with the
movement from its inceptionâ all deny giving their
approval to this report.
Through information received from other sources
we are informed that other members of this commit
tee do not approve the report signed by John T.
Doyle C. R. Splivalo and George H. Rice. We are
informed that -Mr. Rice did not sign the report, al
though his name is appended thereto.
We desire to say that this committee has re
fused to meet the Department of Highways before
making their report, although requested so to do by
some members of said committee. In the circular
referred to an estimate is made by the sub-commit
tee, Messrs. John T. Doyle, C. R. Splivalo and George
H. Rice, giving their views by items upon the cost
of constructing said highways, as follows:
Co*t of road per mile, eastern branchâ 2933 yards
of broken rock dumped on road at $3, $8800.
Coast road, mountain partâ 39,lll yards of exca
vation at 20 cents, $7822; 1760 yards broken rocÃ,
$5280; per mile, $13,102.
Coast road, level partâ l76o yards broken rock at
$3, $5280; grading to receive same, $220; per mile,
$5500.
Twenty-eight miles at $8800. $246,400; 35 miles at
$13,102, $458,570; 30 miles at $5500, $165,000; total of
these items, $869,970.
With regard to the cost of broken stone laid on
the road on the "east branch" we desire to say that
not one pound of it will cost more than $1 50 per cu
bic yard and much of it not more than 50 cents; that
we can contract to have all of this rock brought from
Folsc-m Prison rock-crusher to any point on the rail
road along the east branch fur $i 71 per cubic yard.
But this is not necessary, as San Mateo County will
supply rock, for this purpose at a much less cost. As
to rock for the coast road this department does not
propose in its report to rock said road except where
the material is easily obtainable.
The most glaring, false statement In this report
is in placing the cost of the moving of the earth at
20 cents rÂ»pr cubic yard. There is very little of this
country that cannot be plowed with a common road
plow, and any contractor knows that material that
can be plowed can be moved with scrapers. If the
statement made in this circular is true, namely, that
it will cost 20 cents to move the earth, then, according
to all experience, four horses and one man will move
not less than seventy cubic yards per day, which
would mean $14 per day for a team, scraper and
man. We leave our readers to infer the absurdity
of the proposition.
These gentlemen, who have constituted themselves
civil engineers, had better make some estimates for
earth work, for railroads or private parties, and gee
how long the title of civil engineer will remain after
their names.
In justice to ourselves we desire to point to these
glaring errors in order that the people may judge for
themselves. We can only infer that this report, as
it is named, has been framed by a mind totally igno
rant of the subject, and should receive no credence
at the hands of the voters of San Mateo County.
Very respectfully,
MARSDEN MANSON,
J. R. PRICE,
W. L. ASHE,
Department of Highways Commissioners.

Measure. ;,; \- .
W, "W. Seaman of Los Angeles, Hon.

Yount of Alameda and Frank Rhodes
Jr.: were appointed V>y the State Board
of Library Trustees at its meeting in
the Palace Hotel last evening, to the
positions of chief deputy, di-puty, cata
loguer and Janitor, respectively.
The board, which is composed of F.
D. Ryan of Sacramento, Jacob Neff of
Auburn, Df.' Thomas S. Hint of San

executive session at 8 o'clock and trans
acted business until a little after mid

Miss Green, who has been acting as
Aasistant Librarian at a salary of $1800
per annum, will lose her .position, as
will also J. M. CJiilis and Mr. Craven,
\vl,.. was earning- $100 a month as jan
itor. The board decided to retain tem
porarily Mrs. Neal and Mrs. Hopkins
as assistant cataloguers. The present
Janitress, who is earning $30 a month,
and an assistant law clerk, who is re
ceiving $."0 per month, will also be tem
porarily retained.
The board found that there had not
been an inventory taken of the library
In the past eight years, and as the law
requires one of every department steps
will be immediately taken. It requires
several months' labor, as there are
nearly 108,000 volumes.
Tin- fallowing resolution was adopted
without much discussion:
Whereas, This l>oard aftT a careful in
v< titration of th<' Btate Library with tho
view of ascertaining whether it is being
conducted in an economical manner, finds
that the number of trustees employed in

actually required, and that the number
â¢ reduced from nine to .six, thereby

great art, so far above his previous productions that it marks, it is to
be hoped, the beginning of an epoch in his career, and is clearly worthy
of remark as the possible bounding line of such a period.
An idea of its composition may be had from the accompanying draw-
Ing.;
in handling it is not as firm and sure as might be and there is a
fiddling over detail that is not in strict harmony with the general repose
of the work. But these are slight defects which should disappear with the
confidence that comes with public approval and more work in the same
vein. As' it stands it is poetic in the extreme and is a good picture to
live with: There is a suggestion of Corot and : suggestion of A. P. Rider,
the old American artist who rarely exhibits, but always sells to the in
ner circle of connoisseurs and amateurs. At the same time It is indi
vidual enough not to hir.. of undue influence of the work of any other
artist. Mr. Breuer's picture work will be watched with much interest in
the hope that there will be no falling off from the pace he has set for
himself in "Early Morning."

THE MUNICIPAL PRISON A FARCE.
1
Rev. W. H. Tubb made rather a startling statement before the <
Congregational Ministers' Club on Monday- morning. The clergyman has '
long been visiting the prisons and hospitals, and his remarks were ; <
based on what he had perceived. "The municipal prison system," he <
said, "is a farce and should be' changed to an acting drama. The so- <
cial evil is stronger than the, law, and recent efforts to abate .it is <
evidence. Sabbath desecration is telling on the church and it is de- <
pleting it." Â«â  ' ;
A paper read before the ministers of the Christian Church also <
caused considerable talk among the clergy. The paper was entitled .<
"The Lord's Day Meeting of the Church." It was read by Rev. P. G. <
Mclver. He declared that the preacher, had as much right to be late <
and as much right to stay away from church as members of the con- <
gregation. He also blames the congregation for ministers preaching Â«
sensational sermons. He said":
"Sensationalism is caused directly by the members of the church. <
You may think this is a serious charge. I consider it so, but do.'
not hesitate to make it. Now let us see if it is right. What is" â¢
the object of sensational sermons? Their real object is- to draw a â¢
crowd. . But why is it necessary to resort to extremes of this kind? â 
The answer is obvious. The average of the church membership feels â¢
no responsibility on this line. The whole week is passed without a â¢
single invitation to a person outside of the church to enter-its doors. [â¢
"This is not all; the members of the church of to r day seem to.be
imbibing the idea that they are at liberty to be away from the Lord's â 
day meetings; that whether the meetings be a failure â¢ or not no re-,
sponsibility rests upon them; that responsibility rests â¢ en
tirely with . the pastor. A great hue and cry is made
to-day about what the pastors and preachers ought and might
do, but let me say that it is wrong. Let me ask who is more; anx
ious for the growth of the church and the spread of Christianity than
they? Who labors harder to build up the cause of Christ than they?
Who makes greater sacrifice in the. interests of humanity .than they?
Who is more regular at the church services than the minister? Who
is any more prompt than he? None. How often does the pastor go into the
pulpit and find at the hour of service many of the members-are late
or do not come at all? This is ail wrong. .The pastor has / just as
much right to be late or absent as any one of the members. \ â¢ â 
"If the church member has a right to go on a picnic or an ex-
cursion on the Lord's day, so has the pastor. If the members have a
right to stay away from the meetings of the church on the Lord's day
to entertain friends or visitors, so has the pastor.. There is no .
ground or excuse on which the members of the church may remain
away from the services on the Lord's day but the paster or preacher
may do the same. If he is expected to be there to preach the mem
bers are expected to be there to hear and take part in all the services
of the church."

A Rhetorical Simile Draws

Incidentally Attention Paid to Pew
Rent and Excuses for Not At

Father Yorke held the attention of an
audience that filled St. Mary's Cathedral
to overflowing last evening. This part c
ular evening of the popular priest's mis
sion was devoted to a sermon on the
Latin military phrase, "Vexilla regia pro
teunt" (the standards of the king go
forth), but he managed to branch out and
hit upon a few things of current interest
ere he had finished, and also to convince
his hearers that dropping a nickel or two
in the contribution box on the first day of
the year and on Palm Sunday does not
constitute a true Christian.
In introducing his subject the speaker
referred to the fact that the close of the
season of prayer and meditation is now
drawing near. His hearers were earnestly
exhorted to bear in mind that the true
Christian is a steward of God. created to
do his work and if he fail in this work
he falls short of the standard. But if the
battle prove hard the servant is always
to remember that he is re-enforced by the
strength of the Master, and that with
such re- e nforcement no battle has ever
vet been lost. The church he regarded
as the institution designed to lead the
repentant into the fold, and any means
of salvation outside her jurisdiction would
'"^^[hre^-'he-aaserted. "one means of
our grace is to be proud of our church,
never to be ashaVned of our religion.

George A. McCalvey, who is being sued
for divorce by his wife, states that a
story recently published concerning the
reasons for the suit were mlsstatements
In many particulars and furthermore that
the charges made in the . press as stated
by his wife are totally at variance with
the wording of the complaint on file. Mr.
McCalvey said last evening: "It is true
that my wife has filed a suit for divorce,
but she seems to be trying her case in
the newspapers and not depending on the
wording of the complaint. I have known
of mv wife's absence, but. have made no
attempt to discover her whereabouts. As
she states, she paid a visit to Irvington,
but it was throuch my pleadings with
relatives that she was allowed in the
house â  Whi.e there , she was treated as
mm A t f tÂ£ e toffee left the family Was
well pleased and no search was made
for her as has been stated. She has been
ureed into this action by my political
enemies who are fully aware of her
weakened mental condition from the ex
cessive use of drugs. I will be well
pleased when a divorce is granted."

Last evening- an unnamed stern-wheel
steamer owned by Thomas Ackerman
and which was launched for Klondike
trade off Belmer's ways, South San Fran
cisco, last Tuesday, broke loose from her
moorings and drifted about half a mile
toward Hunters Point. Captain .Wilson
of the launch .Amy went to the scene and
soon had the vessel moored at Jogyer

removed to-day by the owner of the ves
sel and prepared for her initial trip to

A COMPROMISE EFFECTED.
City Lighting Will Be Kept Within
the Appropriation by the
Supervisors.
The electric light company that has the
contract for furnishing lights to the city
agreed yesterday to accept $25,000 a
month for the months of December, 1597,
and January, IS9S, in lieu of the bills they
had presented to the Board of Supervis
ors. Mayor Phelan vetoed the demands
on the ground that they conflicted with
the one-twelfth act, and the matter was
placed in the hands of the committee to
decide how it should be disposed of.
It is probable that there will be a gen
eral cutting down of lights for the next
five months in order that there may not
be a deficit in the Street Light fund. The
matter will rest for final decision with
the Street Lights Committee.
An Attraction for Vacation.
A special vacation ticket has been
issued by the owners of that wonderful
piece of mechanism on Market and Lark
in streets called "Around the World/ as
a special inducement to public school
children to study all the chief points of
interest and centers of attraction on the
surface of the globe. Many of the his
torical pictures and landmarks shown are
representations of many of the sights and
scenes we see here in our city every day.
Considerable interest â  has been man
ifested in the reproduction of the Claus
Spreckels building and many other large
edifices in the city.
The picture of" that artistic bundle, of
steel and stone on Market and Third
streets is twenty feet in height and a
striking reproduction in every respect. In
addition to scenes in San Francisco the
child will bo afforded an opportunity of
making a thorough study of numerous
points of interest from one end of the
world to the other.
Kelso Sentenced.
John Kelso, the contractor, appeared be
fore Judge Low yesterday morning for

Jeaneuo.
The tugs Vipilnnt a+id Alert: had a trial
of Speed from the sugar refinery, to Fol-.
som stree.t wharf yesterday, and the Vig
ilant won. The Alert, has recently re- !
celved a thorough overhauling and had
a new boiler put in. When Captain Jo
seph F. Trewren of the AVert found that
he wasto bear the Vigilant company,
back from the refinery he determined to ,
try conclusions with the "crack" of the
Blackstack fleet. Captain John Stlovich
was not averse, so. when an. even start
was had the engineers were told, to open I
the engines up. It was blowing hard and ,
a choppy sea was on; but both steamers -|
flew through it. The spray broke clean j
over the pilot houses, but each captain'
held on and for the first mile neither
had the advantage. Then the Vigilant ]
â¢ began to gain inch by inch and when
Folsoin street wharf was abreast she was
three open lengths to the good. The Vig- f
ilant is much the larger and more power
ful boat of the two, so the Alert* though
beaten, was certainly not disgraced.
There, has been a general jnixup on the
schooner Thomas S. Negus, that arrived
here from New York two weeks ago with
a party of gold hunters. . Captain Mc
: Cl.-ure. who brought the' schooner out, has
sold out his interest in. the vessel, and
Captain Errari. is now in command. ThÂ«
gold hunters had to get all. their sup
plies here and they -made their arrange- "
ments with Smith's cash store by which
the latter takes Over the management of
the schooner and the miners get their
supplies. :-. ; :-The Negus is going with the
New Yorkers to Copper River and on her
return to San Francisco she will be ntted
out to carry passengers to St. Michael.
The steamer Zealandia arrived from
Honolulu yesterday with seventy-four
cabin and thirty-nijie steerage passenger*.
She was late in leaving Honolulu, and
owing to heavy head weather she was
unable to make up- the lost tlhre.
The schooner Nellie G, Thurstori. now
out 172 days from New York for SatÂ»
Franftiaco vrlth a party -of nineteen gola
hunters, has been spoken 700 miles south
west of this port by the steam whaler
Jeahette TheJeanette left here for Hon- '
oluiu on March !i, and arrived' there four
teen days later. From. Honolulu the>
news :Of the speaking came by the Zea
landia, so the schoorief must have met
some very heavy 'and adverse weather
to have kept her off port so- long.
The old wooden bark Dominion is a I
very long timeâ loo days-^-out from New
castle, N, S. W. She was spoken on Jan
uary 3, but the position was not given,
bo she should have been along some weeks j
ago. The. Dominion was sent to Aus- i
tralia by T. B. H. .^Thitefaw to be sold.
The- captain found a purchaser, but he
.pocketed, the money and Whitelaw has
neither seen nor heard of him from that
day ..to this. The Dominion was built in
1575 and. is 1214 tons net burden, is owned
toy CoyrHslaw Bros, of Sydney, N. S. W.,
and has. a Cargo of -coal" consigned to J.
J. Moore & Co. ,-i. v'
There .Was nearly a collision between
tbe baj-kentine J. SI. Griffiths and the
pilot-boat Grac.ie S yesterday. The bar- |
kentine came in â  from sea and anchored
near 'the schooner. Soon she began to \
drag arid- the captain on tl c Oracle S had
to' slip, his anchor and maÂ£e sail in order j
. to" avoid a collision. The tug Reliance '
w>s sent â to the rescue and towed the
Griffiths'to a safe anchorage.
The -schooner Edward Parke had to
comic back to p^rt. yesterday. Two days
ago' she sailed for Willapa harbor, but
was caught in a storm outside and lost
her jibbopm. After her repairs have
been, made' she will proceed.
The steamer Walla Walla sailed tor
Puget Sound ports yesterday with over
300 passengers. '. Some of them are going
to- the gold fields, but the majority are
taking advantage of the cut rates over

JUSTICE COOK EXONERATED.
Collector Besecker Circulated False
Stories Concerning His Honor.
In The Call of the 24th of last month
the. statement was. published that Col
lector D. E. Beseeker, thinking he had
not obtained justice in Justice of the
Peace Cook's court, had accused the Jus
tice of heeding a pull.
It was stated \hat Beseeker said in j
open court: "I will get justice from a|
court that knows what justice is. This!
Is the first time that I have noticed a
court where a 'pull' could be exerted,
Buch as is in evidence here to-day. I
thoroughly understand the reasons* why'
such, a decision is rendered/but you may i
be -sure' that I do riot intend to let this 1
matter rtst." .
Justice Cook denies that any such
scene ever occurred in his court. On In
vestigation The Call has learned that the I
Btory. substantially as printed, emanated j
from Beseeker, who told Justice Kerri
gan arid others that he had denounced
Justice. Cook, as stated by The Call. Why
Besecker thus misrepresented the facts
jn the case is not known, but the truth â¢
Is that he did not use any language of the I
character quoted nor did he make any- 1
Incriminating accusations within the
hearing of the court. â¢-: â¢ â  \

THE VIGILANT WINS BY THREE LENGTHS.
After a thorough overhauling and having had new boilers put in Captain Trewren of the Alert thought his
vessel was equal to a brush with the Vigilant. The tugs raced from the Sugar Refinery to Folsom-street wharf,
and the showing was a. very creditable one for the Alert, as she is much the smaller boat of the two.
her husband signed the deeds held by
Taho under the mistaken belief that he
was signing papers making it a home
stead. The case was tried several months
ago before Judge Hebbard, and he gave
judgment in. favor of Tano. It was under
that judgment that the ejection took
place. â¢ â  . â¢

THE SA^. FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 2, 1898.
OFFICERS ARE
BEING SHIELDED
Witnesses in the Haynes Ex
amination Have Faulty
Memories.
Cannot Tell How the Policemen Acted
When Lieutenant Burke Met
His Death.
Judge Conlan's courtroom was again
crowded yesterday afternoon with curious
spectators, who stretched their necks to
get a view of the eccentric murderer of
Lieutenant .ourke. The testimony elicited
dtiring the hearing was similar to that
already published, and the constant ques
tioning of ..ue attorneys for the defense
and prosecution over beaten paths became
wearying to the court and listeners. At
one stage Judge Conlan's feelings could
not be restrained, an. he pettishly said:
"Let this witness go, for God's sake; he
has answered that time and asrain."
Chief Lees was an Interested listener to
the proceedings, and would often prompt
Prosecuting Attorney Mogan for the pur
pose of en.ightening himself on the con
duct of his officers during the exciting
scenes surrounding the brave lieutenant's ;
death.
Witnesses examined were averse to tell
ing what the arresting officers did by
evasively answering that they did not see
them, their attention being centered on
Burke and Haynes.
Attorneys Wilson and Sweeney's erforts
were mainly directed toward getting an
admission from the witnesses .at
Burkf's menacing front was the reason
why Haynes shot, but without success.
They also attempted 10 show by the wit
nesses that Haynes was often teased,
hooted at, stoned and was a prey for
petty thieves in me neighborhood, ail of
which they denied or said that they had
not heard of such stories.
Peter Rooney, the first witness ca-.ed,
said he was a neighbor of the defendant;
that on the day of the shooting he saw
Haynes from 8:30 o'clock up to the time
it occurred, he heard shots and then saw
Burke stagger back along Peralta avenue
to Montcalm and fall; that about a
minute after Burke raised himself up on
his elbow and fired a shot toward Haynes'
cabin. Wilkinson, Merchant. Marlowe and
Kennedy were stationed on the northwest
corner of Peralta avenue, but when the
shots were fired they shifted around. He
saw Marlowe firing at Haynes when he
came out to deuver the other shots at the
lieutenant and pick up his pistol, Dut
could not see the others, and did not know
where they went; t.*at after Burke lay
on the ground ten minutes Patrol-Wagon
Driver Cashel pulled him down the hill,
assisted by Jonnny -icGrath. He saw
them put the wounded officer in a
stretcher and then lift him into the pa
trol-wagon.
On cross-examination, he said he had
lived in the neighborhood seven years, and
knew Haynes since then. Attorney
Sweeney led him over his testimony but
beyond tangling him up on one or two
things, nothing o. importance was
elicited
John T. Graham, a grocer, residing at
Precita and Alabama streets, told how
Hopkins came into his store and com
plained of Haynes and of his telephoning
to the Seventeenth-street station, and of
Kennedy and Wilson coming out on horse
back. How Wilkinson returned to the
patrol box and telephoned for advice and
of Burkes coming a short while after.
The next he saw of the lieutenant was
when he was on the patrol-wagon on his
way to the hospital. On cross-examina
tion, he said he had known the defendant
eignteen or twenty years. He denied that
he had ever seen boys throw stones at
the defendant or that Haynes had ever
com-iained to him of his treatment. He
also denied ...at Haynes ever came down
to his place to recover stolen property.
Rooney was recalled and a.Â«ked whether
the boys had ever stoned Haynes 1 cabin,
but said he did not know of his own
knowledge, but heard they dm.
Robert Cole, residing at 3244 garrison
street, was en called. He was nervous
and created some merriment b-<' his man
ner ot testifying. He would place his hat
on his chair and then stand up to answer,
and when told to sit down would sit on
his derby. Prosecuting Attorney Moean
was kept busy trying to prevent his wit
ness from destroying his headgear.
He testified mat he worked in the Green
\ alley livery stable as harness-cleaner
from 6 o'clock in the evening till that hour
next morning; that was his habit to eat
breakfast and ta-.e a stroll around the
neighborhood ...ore going to bed; tnat
his attention was attracted by seeing two
officers on horseback moving toward
Haynes place, and that he starteu up
that way, and met Mr. Doody, a neighbor
In company with him he reached a place
of vantage and awaited develonments
He then went over the old ground, nar
rating ti.e events that led up to the shoot
ing.
He told of his standing 250 feet away
and listening to i urke's command to give
in and Haynes* excited replies; that
Burke had his right hand in his pocket
and with his left hand threw back his
coat, disclosing his badge of office; that
Haynes warned him away and then rais
ing his pistol, lire,., that the lieutenant
drew his gun the same instant, when
Haynes again shot; that Burke staggered
back and fired again. He then told ho :
Haynes had left his cabin and, stooping
over t'ae lieutenant, picked up something
and nred a few more shots. A^tornev
Sweeney succeeded in his cross-examina
tion in bewildering the witne-s unul he
did not know whether he saw the shoot
ing or whether was a dream. He made
all kinds of contradictory statements and
was in a bad plight until rescued by the
court.
Havnes sat throughout the afternoon
blinking his eyes and listening intently
to what was being: said. He wouK confer
with his attorieys, and at one point he
raised a piping voice and asked the wit
ness where he was standing. He was
quieted by nis counsel, and then laDsed
into a stoicliKe attitude during the re
mainder of ...e session. The case was con
tinued until L o'clock to-day, when fur
ther testimony will c heard.
ATTORNEYS ONLY CAN ACT.
Clients Cannot Settle â  Their Cases
Without Their Representatives.
The Supreme Court has handed down a I
decision which will cause some rejoicing !
among the attorneys of the State, for
it establishes as law that when a man
places his case in the hands of a law
yer he has no right to settle the difficulty
oat of court without the knowledge and
consent of his attorney. M. G. Wyllie
brought an action against the Sierra Gold
Company to recover money. An amended
complaint was filed on November 4, !
1896. To this a general demurrer was i
filed by the defendant, which was
overruled and ten days allowed to !
answer. No answer having been !
filed on December 4, the clerk of the !
court, upon application of the attorney '
for the plaintiff, was directed to enter a
judgment in default for the amount. On
the same day. but a little later, the de
fendant filed a notice of a motion to set
aside the judgment and permit the de
fendant to answer.
He gave as his reason that he had
been taken by surprise, in this, that the ;
"plaintiff" had extended the time to an-
Bwer to December S, and he produced i
affidavits to show that In the interim the !
two parties to the action had been con
sideling a compromise by means of let- j
ters and conversations. On hearing, his
petition was denied by the lower court,
from which ruling he appealed. The Su
preme Court holds that the party losing j
by this failure to answer has no redress, j
for "his attorney should have known bet- \
ter than to allow the matter to go by \
the board in such a way. and says: I
"When a party appears and is represent- I
ed by an attorney of record he cannot !
himself assume control of the case, and j
if he signs a stipulation dismissing the
action or extending the time for any pur- ;
pose, the stimulation will have no ef- '
feet and will be disregarded by the ;
court."

A special meeting in the interest of the
German Young Men's Christian Associa
tion will be held Sunday afternoon at 3

LOST HIS LOVE
AND HIS CASH
Why Alonzo Mclver Be
gan Suit in the Jus
tice Court.
Woman He Adored Took His
Coin and Then Married
Another.
Justice Groezinger Decides for the
Defendant After Reading
Some Letters.
"Love'a labor and money lost" was the
burden of a tale of woe that was told in
Justice of the Peace Groezinger's court
yesterday.
Alonzo Mclver was suing Frank P.
Howard and Emelie Howard for $160,
money advanced to the fair defendant in
the action when she was yet a single
woman. Mclver, according to' his own
admissions on the stand, was desperately
in love with the fair Emelie, and was at
the time the money was alleged to have
been advanced the possessor of consid
erable coin, xie was a habitue of the
race track and a plunger In a way.
She who afterward became Mrs. How
ard accepted his presents and attentions,
the former including numerous sums of
money that were itemized in the bill of
particulars.
While Emelie and Alonzo were friends,
according to the testimony, she was ac
customed to draw on him for whatever
funds she needed. These items began
along about March, 1896, and the first sum
that Mclver alleged to be due him was
$5 which Mclver said was advanced to
enable the lady of his affections to join
the French Benevolent Society. Then
came an item that reads as follows:
Cash, July 10, 18%. when F. P. Howard
broke his leg, $10.
F. P. Howard Is the party defendant.
About this time Mclver's Inamorata de
cided to go East, and the bill of particu
lars says that Mclver advanced $40 for a
second-class ticket tnat was to carry her
there.
When Mrs. Howard's father needed
some shirts and other little necessities
Mclver's complaint says that he paid for
them at a well-known haberdasher's on
Market street, 'j. hen there was $20 cash
advanced when the lady in the case was
out of funds.
In September, 1596, the prospective Mrs.
Mclver was in Wellington, Kan., and
wanted to return to. San Francisco. The
plaintiff's itemized account says that he
advanced her $50 for that purpose. Al
together he claims that he "loaned" the
lady $150.
And yet when she came bacK from the
East she united her life and fortunes
with Howard, who, because he is her
husband, is made a party defendant In
the case. Mclver alleged that he had
parted with his coin because the fair
Emelie had requested the money in the
nature of loans. Mrs. Howard said that
the money was presented to her in the
nature of tokens of Mclver's affections.
To prove that Mclver was head over
heels in love with her Mrs. Howard pro
duced Mrs. George W. Parsons as a wit
ness in her behalf. The witness, a dash
ing blonde, whose husband works with
Howard as a telegraph operator in the
office of a morning dally, and who was
formerly Mrs. Lulu Peel, testified that
Mclver had escorted her home on more
than one occasion, and while on these
pleasant journeys had poured forth his
tale of love for the lovely Emelie. â 
"What was your condition as to sobri
ety while with Mclver?" asked the at
torney for the plaintiff when Mrs. Par
sons finished her story. , The lawyer's in
tention was apparently to show that
there had been a jolly luue time. Jus
tice Groezinger ruled out the question,
however, and the indignant Mrs. Parsons
was not permitted to answer.
To clinch its case the defense Intro
duced a large number of .etters written
by Mclver to the lady who jilted him,
in which he used every endearing name
known to lovers and spelled "pet" "peat."
He told her there was nothing he would
not do for her; that his heart, his hand
and his fortune were at her feet, and
that, though she did not answer his let
ters as regularly as he wished, he- loved
her still.
After reading these endearing epistles
Justice Groezinger decided that the sums
advanced could not have been exactly in
the nature of loans and gave judgment
against Mclver.
SCHOOL DIRECTORS CENSURED.
West of Castro Street Improvement
Club Speaks Its Mind on the
School Question.
Had any or all of the Board of Educa
tion been spectators of the West of Cas
tro Street Improvement Club last night
they would have felt the atmosphere very
warm, notwithstanding the cold and chil
ly wind that was blowing on the outside.
Immediately after the club was called
to order by Chairman W. J. Nixon, sev
eral members were falling over each
other to obtain the floor in order to have
a whack at the "shuffling eight," for the
manner in which the children of Noe Val
ley are treated as regards school accom
modation.
Major B. McKinne obtained the floor
and read an article from The Call of yes
ADVERTISEMENTS.
THEY WANT TO TELL
These Grateful Women Who Have
Been Helped by Mrs. Pinkham.
Women who have suffered severely
and been relieved of their ills by Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and medicine are
constantly urging publication of their
statements for the benefit of other wo-
men. Here are two such letters:
Mrs. Lizzie Beverly, 258 Merrimac
St., Lowell, Mass., writes:
" It affords me great pleasure to tell
all suffering women of the benefit I have
received from taking Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound. I can hard-
ly find words to express my gratitude for
what she has done for me. My trouble
was ulceration of the womb. I was un-
der the doctor's care. Upon examina-
tion he found fifteen very large ulcers,
but he failed to do me good. I took sev-
eral bottles of Lydia E-. Pinkhams Vege-
table Compound, also used the Sanative
Wash, and am cured. Mrs. Pinkham's
medicine saved my life, and I would
recommend it to all suffering women."
Mrs. Amos Tbombleay, Ellenburgh
Ctr., N. V.. writes:
*' I took cold at the time my baby
was born, causing me to have milk
legs, and was sick in bed for eight
weeks. Doctors did me no good. I
surely thought I would die. I was al-
so troubled with falling of the womb.
I could not eat, had faint spells as
often as ten times a day. One day a
lady came to see me and told me of the
benefit she had derived from taking
Lydia E. Pinkham's medicine, and ad-
vised me to try it. I did so, and had
taken only half a bottle before I was
able to sit in a chair. After taking
three bottles I could do my own work.
I am now in perfect health. "
terday morning, in which the school ques
tion of Noe Valley was shown to be as
it is.
Major McKinne, in unmeasured terms, j
denounced the Board of Education for its <
! misconduct in not providing school ac-
I commodation for the children of that dis- !
j trict, where, he stated, there were by !
j actual census 400 children without a suit- j
I able place to attend school.
Following these remarks, Chairman
Nixon offered the following resolutions, j
which were unanimously carried:
Whereas The knowledge comes to this club i
that the Board of Education had an ppportu- I
nlty to rent a suitable building at a nominal i
rental to accommodate the 400 school children i
living west of Castro street and thereby bring I
the scattered classrooms now existing under
one roof ; and
Whereas, This should be done as quickly as
possible so as to obviate the necessity of sep- [
arating the small children of one family as ia t
now the case: and
Whereas, The sits mentioned. Hoffman and I
Twenty-fifth streets, is most desirable for lta ]
location from street cars and its ideal sur- '
roundings, being entirely sheltered' Jby trees
with large grounds for play yards; therefore.
be It â â -.-;â 
Resolved, That this club condemns the action
of the Board of Education in nnt having- the '
interest of this district at heart; and be it i
further â  j
Resolved, That the Board of Education be 'â ;
petitioned to reconsider its action at the next
meeting and that the proposed site be obtain- | :
ed at a nominal rental for a school house im- I
mediately in accordance with the wishes df the j
citizens of this district; and be it further ' |
Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions be |
handed the secretary of the Board â  of Educa- f
tion by the president of this club. â  T
The car question, with its creeping gait,
came in for a portion of the evening's- !
consideration. And it was resolved that
the superintendent of the Market-street :
system be requested to restore the. eight
mile schedule to all ears running Into the
Mission. â¢ ...
Short but pointed speeches were made
by Chairman Nixon, F. E.Hackney, Major
F. H. Qualman, James Cotter, T. J. Hune, |
C. E. Osgood, B. F. Johnson and others
on the many questions in which the val
ley has an interest.
F. E. Hackney, C. E. Osgood and B. F.
Johnson were appointed a committee to
review the new charter and report at
the next meeting as to its worth, and
"what will It do for the Mission," if '
adopted.

his discourse, which he announced as
being in two parts, the second of which
is to be given next year, he- proceeded,
saying, in part: "It iÂ» unquestionably
true that singing has great Influence upon
the action of the lungs, for tne increase
of the volume of air which passes into
the lungs when singing is very beneficial.
Professional singers have the highest vi
ta) capacity, ami exhale from 4Odo to 5000
centimeters in one breath. Vocal exer
cises, repeated daily, will provide tor an
increased ventilation of the blood and
lungs, the inner chest becomes enlarged
in. all three ' dimensions, the vertebral
column is stretched .and we instinctively
hold ourselves erect when singing. It also
considerably- influences the circulation,
and the whole process of nutrition in im
proved thereby, more, oxygen is inhaled
and more carbonic acid expired. This in
creases the need of food, and singers
usually, enjoy good appetites and. great
thirst. â ..'.â  . â¢. . . ' â â¢'
"Men of sedentary habits are apt to
suffer from, digestive disturbances, in con
sequence of stagnation of circulation.
Viiis.cah be corrected by vocal exercise,
for. in singing' the' diaphragm causes in
its dowh ward movement a corresponding
change in the aujacent liver, stomach and

Before concluding, the lecturer said ha
would visit the different hospitals and in

Ucally Investigating the influence of musio
upon patients, and hopes also to note its
influence upon criminals as a means of

Had Smith agreed to the -eo-riferehce'

would probably have been such, as to
disqualify both from holding the office

claimed, committed, a felony In making
â this offer to Smith,! and has also . dis
qualified himself from holding the office
should he be elected to 1111 it. . Under

McNeil to further that gentleman's

the laws of this State, or by this act, for

For a violation of this law, section 61
of the Penal Code provides as follows:
Every person who willfully violates any
of the provisions of the laws of this State
relating to elections is, unless a different
punishment for such violation is pre
scribed by this code, punishable by a fine
not exceeding $1000 or by Imprisonment in
the State prison not exceeding live years,
or by both.
It Is further claimed that McNeil has
also violated section 19 of the purity of
elections law, which reads as follows:
It shall be unlawful for any person to
I make any gift, loan, promise, offer, pro
ment or agreement, as aforesaid, to.

.Every perron who commits any of the
offenses mentioned in this section Is pun
ishable, upon conviction thereof, by im

Ipss than one year nor more than seven
The words "as aforesaid"' refer to
paragraph 2 of section 19, which reads
as follows:
. To give, offer or promise any office,
place or employment, or to promise to
procure, or endeavor to procure, any of
flee, place or employment.
â It is claimed that McNeil request
Smith's aid to secure his (McNeil's
election where in his letter he says
"You cannot be elected Mayor; it is a
physical impossibility. With your aid
I can be." How that aid can be ex
tended Mr. McNeil explains in the sen
tence which opens this article.
It is but justice to Mr. Smith to stat
that the first knowledge of this lette
was obtained by The Call from a mem
ber of the Charter Club. Mr. Smith
had confided its contents to a number
of his friends in that organization.
When Mr. Smith was asked if he had
received such a letter he replied in the
affirmative, but it was with the great
est reluctance and only after he had
taken counsel with his friends and an
attorney that he consented to allow
the letter to be made public. The
reason he gave fcr permitting this pub
licity was that he and his friends con
t sidered that the letter was one that did
| not concern his interests alone, hut
those of the entire Charter Club ticket
and the welfare of the city of San Jose.
! He had also been advised by the attor
ney whom he consulted that he was un
der neither a moral nor a legal obliga
tion to consider his communication as
. confidential. It related, as was told, to
: public affairs of the most vital interest
| to . San Jose, and virtually sought to
make the recipient an accessory to
what was considered to be a felony. In
tlio course of an interview with Mr.
McNeil ho virtually admitted having
written this letter to Mr. Smith, and
1 showed clearly by his unwarranted
abuse of that gentleman that he has
hoped to impose what appears to be !
ian unfair and unlawful confidence
; upon that gentleman.
"Do you recognize that as part of a let
ter written to Mr. S. K. Smith, the can
didate of the Charter Club?" asked The
' Call correspondent, at the same time
handing Mr. McNeil a slip of paper con
â¢ taining the following words: "If you will
consent lo permit the withdrawal of your
name for the Mayoralty, you can com
mand me and my services for any office,
present or future, within my power."
! "I can't say just now," replied Mr. Mc-
Neil, "whether 1 recognize all the words
' that are on this slip or not. I can give
;.you a detinite answer by comparing them
with a letter I wrote a short time ago
Would you like me to compare this Bli
With my letter?"
"Yes, sir."
The text of this particular part of th
' purity of elections law was handed to Mr
McNeil >or his perusal.
"I see nothing in this section," said Mr
McNeil, "at all applicable to any privat
â¢ letter I may have addressed. I hay
! ma<le no oit'ers to any person. I hay
endeavored to seure the withdrawal of
man who cannot be elected ~iayor of San
j Jose. As an earnest of my sincerity, am
: as further evidence of my wishes for th
welfare of this city, I also wrote severa
other letters to different members of th
New Charter Club, in which I urged th
withdrawal of Mr. Smith, not that I ob
Ject to- the gentleman, but because 1 be
lieve he cannot be elected."
"I><> you claim that those words re
ferred to in your letter were not an offer
to contribute a valuable consideration to
Mr. Smith in consideration of his with
drawing as a nndidate for public of
liee, namely, that of Mayor?"
"I do claim that most emphatically and
I unequivocally. You may Dut it in capl
j tal letters if you wish. I am not now
| engaged in crooked politics."
"Wa.s not that an offer of a valuable
consideration?"
"No, sir."
"Why?"
"Because it was not, and by no stretch
of the imagination can it be construed
as such."
"Was not the offer of an office a valu
able consideration?"
â "I have made no offer of any office, or
any valuable consideration or anything
else to secure anything whatsoever. I am
not now engaged in that line of business.
Moreover, 1 wish to express to you my
supreme contempt for a man aspiring for
a public office, a man who claims his re
ligion is purity, a man who would rue
or ruin this city. I say 1 look with su-i
preme contempt upon that man who will
violate a personal communication ad- i
dressed to him and who will endeavor to
use that personal communication to an
other's injury. Mr. Smith can have but
one object in giving you any words I
might have addressed him. That object
is wholly to take a mean, bastardly, j
disreputable advantage of me at this i
time. It has no excuse whatsoever, and
, stamp* him a.s one beneath the respect i
i of decent men."
"There is another portion of this purity I
\of elections law that, it Is claimed, is
violated by these words. This is section
19, paragraph 3."
After perusing this paragraph of the j
law Mr. McNeil remarked:
That is another section that suits your
convenience to imagine is being violated I
OT has been violated. Suppose you put It ;
that way instead of the way you â worded
It. If you can see nny possible connec
tion between my letter.^to Mr. Smith and
this section to which you have called my !
attention you have a more florid imagina
tion than you have yet exhibited, and I ;
credited you with considerable of that i
article."
In further explanation of the writing
of the letter to Mr. Smith the follow- :
ing statement was made by Mr. Me- ,
Neil:
"The date for withdrawal expired last
Saturday night, and my letter to Mr.
Smith and to several other gentlemen !
who belong to the New Charter Club was ;
wholly for the purpose of securing not |
only better government In San Jose, but,
if possible, the nomination of a man who
stood Borne chance of election. I would j
furthermore statn now that Mr. Smith j
has shown himself to be the acme of im
purity in politics; that throughout this |
campaign, in hi 3 flippant, arrogant and
uncalled for remarks relative lo my can
didacy, he is carrying out or extendlngthe
cunning that has characterized his course
ever since the new charter has existed." |
In view of the serious predicament I
that McNeil has apparently placed !
himself in his further course in the
present campaign will be watched with
a great deal of Intere-*

THREE LETTERS
STIR SOCIETY
How Young Men Tried
to Insure . Answers
to Invitations.
Misses and Matrons Puzzled at
the Additions to Usual
Forms.
Yet Somehow the Suggestion Seems
to Have Been Generally
Understood.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 1.
Three young society men, who are also
students of the University of California.,
have startled the misses and matrons by
the boldness of their invitations to a lit
tle luncheon that is to be given at their
chapter house to-morrow afternoon. All
kinds of little sensations are continually
cropping up in Oakland society, but the
latest is thought by some to be a huge
j joke and by others to be rather too sug
i gestive.
| To be plain, the three young gentlemen
I have introduced a departure in the
method of Invitation that is unique. The
invitation is issued on light green paper
and is as follows:
<$> â¢ <$>
! NOTICE :
: Blx-Dlx-Chinx Luncheon :
: at :
: D. K. E. Hall, :
; on :
: Saturday, April 2, at 1 O'clock. :
: Consider Yourself Asked. :
! R. 8. V. P.â P. D. Q. !
<Â£â¢ <!>
The innovation is in the last three let
i ters, "P. D. Q.," and when the young
! ladies received their little green notes
there was consternation and inquiry as
i to the meaning of the three capitals: Tho
I luncheon is being given by Fred Blxby,
I Dixwell Davenport and Allen Chlckerlnfc
i and Mesdames Bixby, Davenport and
[ Chlckering are to be chaperones. It has
! long been a grievance in local society that
I the "R. S. V. P." has been neglected and
I a few weeks ago just forty Invited guests
j responded out of 250 Invitations, and there
i was trouble. This neglect has caused
j much trouble to hostesses and every ef
; fort has been made to bring about some
' reform.
The young men at Berkeley undertook
i to emphasize the "R. S. V. P." and so
they added the "P. D. Q." Among the
invited guests are Miss Marietta Havens,
Pauline Fore, Carmen Moore, Ida Belle
| and Bessie Palmer, the Misses Duff, Da*
! venport, Marie Rose Deane and many
' others from the Lakeside district. AVhen
these young ladies received their invita
tions they scanned them very thoroughly
1 and the "P. D. Q." was a veritable con
nundrum for them. Fathers and broth
: ers were asked, but all professed ignor
i ance, and the young ladies are still in
! doubt. The luncheon comes off to-mor
rew and the three young hosts will have
an interesting time explaining away their
! little suggestion to their guests.
The little incident has aroused great in
â  terest. It is generally regarded as a bold
innovation and thf'rc is a desire to know
what may be expected next.
There is one peculiar feature to the al
i legeu ignorance of the young ladies re
| garding the cabalistic signs. It is re
i markable that acceptances were sent in
; with greater speed than for months. As
one of the invited young men guests said,
"Those answers came in in accordance
with the suggestion."
STRUCK BY A
LOCAL TRAIN
A Fatal Accident to Mrs.
Jennette Whiteford Yes
terday.
Walked Upon the Track in a Strong
Wind and Was Hit Without
Warning. *
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 1.
Mrs. Jennette Whiteford, 60 years of
a^e, was struck by the 2:30 train from
the pier this afternoon as she was cross
ing the Seventh street local tracks at
Wood street. The pilot struck the unfor
tunate woman and It is believed that but
one person witnessed the accident.
William Davidson gives the following
account of the affair: "1 saw Mrs. White
ford as she started across the street. She
had her head down against the wind and
evidently did not see nor hear the train
approaching. The engineer did not whis
tfe nor did the bell ring, and no effort
was made to stop the train. In fact
I do not believe that the engineer knew
an accident had happened, for the train
went right along."
Mrs. Whiteford was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where Drs. Stratton and
Milton treated her. Internal injuries
caused bleeding of the ears and mouth
Littlo hope is held by the attendants of
her recovery. She is a sister of MrÂ»
Thomas Lee of Ml Campbell street but
lived with Officer Bert Curtiss for the
past live or six years. Mr. and Mrs
Curtiss were both away from home when
the accident happened, but Officer Cur
tiss answers all calls for the patrol wagon
during the day, hence was on hand to
gather intormation and give directions for
her care. She may not live through the
night.
Mrs. Whiteford died at the Receiving
Hospital late to-night.
POWDER CAN EXPLODES.
Spark From a Forge Ignites the Ex
plosive in a Blacksmith-Shop.
OAKLAND, April I.â W. Lebrecht and
John Foreman, while at work in a black
smith shop on Sixteenth street, near Tel
egraph avenue, this morning, were star
tled by a violent explosion that nearly
wrecked the building and made them
think a second edition of the earthquake
had arrived. The whole building was en
veloped in smoke immediately which
caused a lire alarm to be -sounded
After getting out on the street the gen
tlemen soon learned that there was no
lire, but it required some time to dis
cover the cause of the explosion. When
the smoke had cleared away sufficiently
to enable them to enter again they found
an old ten-pound lard can that had had
powder in it. This Lebrecht and E O
Lufkin had carried on a hunting trip but
Mr. Lebrecht did not know that it had
been left in the shop.
It was the supposition that a spark
dropped into the can, igniting the pow-

taxes paid under protest, and were await

which he decided against the plaintiff.
So far, they have made no move to ap

to accept the findings as final or take
their appeal. The suits involved are one

Indictment of Grand Jury Is
Declared to Have No

An Expensive Job to Prove That Ho
Did Not Take a Load of

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April L
Supervisor Charles E. noeth was ac
quitted of a charge of malfeasance in of
fice by a jury to-day, after half an hour's
deliberation. The prosecution was the
result of an indictment containing several
counts returned by the last Grand Jury-
From the very first Mr. Roeth has con
tended that his indictment was nothing
CHARLES E. ROETH, the Indicted Supervisor, "Who Has Been
Exonerated by a Jury.
but persecution, and has expressed per
fect confidence that he could clear him
self on all points. The jury only took
two ballots, and was then unanimous for
acquittal. The arguments were con
cluded yesterday, and this morning noth
ing remained but for Judge Ellsworth to
instruct the jury. The Instructions were
very brief, and the Judge dwelt espe
cially upon the necessity of giving the
defendant the benefit of the' presumption
of innocence. The court also impressed
tjpon the jurors that they were to banish
any prejudice they might feel and to con
sider nothing but the evidence.
"I am greatly relieved, said Super
visor Roeth, "at the verdict. While I
was confident of the jury's findings, a
man feels less anxious when matters are
settled. I trust now that the public will
know there has been no foundation for
the accusation brought against me. The
evidence was mostly from ignorant
sources and was very much juggled. Now
that the thing is over it seems absurd
that any one ever listened to such gos
sip."
Ex-Mayor Chapman, who was one of
Roeth's attorneys said that the evidence
showed that Roeth not only did not mis
appropriate the county's funds but he
saved the county money. Roeth paid for
some work out of his own pocket which
it is claimed the county paid for.
The trial has been an expensive one for
the county, considering the questions at
issue. One of the chief charges was that
Roeth appropriated about $15 worth of
wood to his own use that oelonged to the
county. To prove that he did not do this
has cost about $558, made up as xollows:
Jurors' fees, $288; reporter, $120; mileage,
$100; service of papers, $50.
STUDENTS WOULD FIGHT SPAIN
Uncle Sam Can Find Ready Sol
diers at the State University.
BERKELEY, April I.â A number of
students at the State University have
signified their intention of offering their
services to the Government in case a war
with Spain is declared.
A list of names of prospective soldiers
was started this morning in the armory.
By this evening eleven students had
signed it. The statement to which the
signatures were affixed is as follows:
"In the event of war with Spain we, the
undersigned, virtually agree and pledge
ourselves to offer our services to the
President of the United States of Amer
ica," The signers so far are: R. W. Ben
der, C. S. Schilling, Paul A.
L. Giacomini, J. W. Millar, B. T. Dow,
R. S. Lavenson, L. T. O'Toole, Edward
Rainey, Spiro F. Sargonlich and A. B.
Anderson. Three of the signers, Gia
comini, Millar and Rainey, are captains
of cadet companies, and .bender and An
derson are lieutenants in a military
organization at Berkeley.
Records May Be Broken.
BERKELEY, April 1.-An athletic car
nival, consisting of the annual univer
sity championship field day and baseball
games between the \ arsity and alumni,
will take place to-morrow afternoon on
the university grounds. The cinder path
has been put in tirst-class condition, and
according to one of the most prominent
of the track athletes there is a strong
probability of Drum breaking the record
in the 220 yard dash and Walsh In the
mile walk. The baseball game promises
to be a close one. The Varsity has been
practicing hard, and the men are in ex
cellent condition, while the alumni will
probably be strengthened by having

box.
Damage for a Lonely Walk.
OAKLAND, April I.â J. P. Burris haa
filed a suit for $200 damages against the
Realty Syndicate for refusing to carry
him on a transfer issued by one of their
own lines. The trouble occurred on Sep
tember 11, last year, when the Fourth
avenue branch was discontinued at 10:30
p. m. without notice to the patrons. Bur
ris was given a transfer, but there was
no car, and he had to walk a mile and a
half. His wife was ill and he had been
down town purchasing some medicine for
her. The case came to trial to-day be
fore Justice Clift, but went over one
week, after taking part of the testimony.
Will Make No Defense.
OAKLAND. April I.â Joseph H. Moffett
appeared in the Police Court this morning
with his head still in bandages. His at
torney aakÂ«Â»d for an early examination,
stating that ho desired to get his client
out of the unhealthy City Prison to the
"ounty Jail as soon as possible. He fur
ther stated that he would mane no de
fense at the examination; hence it would
require but a short time. Monday after
noon at 2 o'clock was agreed upon by the
counsel and accepted by the court. Thus
far Mrs. Dora Guernsey, Moffet's step
daughter, who swore to the complaint
charging him with murder, is the only
witness subpenaed.
GOOD TIMES
COST MONET
Don Ezeta Now Objects
to Settle With the
Hostess.
Six Months' French Dinners, at
the Apel Chateau . in
. . Alameda.
The Ex-Vice-rPresident of Salvador.
â Also Forgot to Pay Back â¢
Sniall Loans. "â¢'".'.â¢.'
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 1. .-,
General Ezeta, late Vice-Presiderit of
the republic of Salvador, and now of
this city, has been sued for â¢ a paltry
$141 50. The general has been In. the Jus
tice's court before, and his. experience
was such that it was-, thought he would
not care to go through it again. But the
i general is evidently doughty.'
General Ezeta cannot understand why
Americans should be in such a hurry for
their money. The little bill for which he
is now sued was contracted between Feb
ruary and September of last year, and
the general thinks this is very early to
try to collect it by the law. It is a very
interesting bill that the general, is. asked
to pay. "With the exception of one loan
of $20 it consists entirely of "French din
ners for two." â¢â¢â  â¢
There is in Alameda a lady named Mrs.
N. H. Apel, who is noted the country
round for her marvelous menus. Mrs.'
Apel's French dinners enjoy a fame
which reaches clear across the bay, and
it was not long after the general's exile
from Salvador that he discovered this
little resort in Alameda. Last February
the general entered upon a couTse of Apel
dinners that extended for. six months,
eating one regularly about every ten
days. There are eighteen dinners charged
against him and his friend, and the averr
age price is $6 50. . â  ' â â '.'â 
On one occasion In June the general ate
a hilarious dinner, and he is charged with
$15. The details of the dinner are not
given, but a liberal supply of wine was
included. One little item shows that the
general must have been flat broke when
he visited the Apel restaurant, for he
took the lady of the house into his con-,
fidence and was accommodated with. $20
in gold coin, and this is made a' separate
item. All kinds of peaceable attempts
have been made since last September to
collect the biil, but without success. â¢
In September of last year Mrs. Apel
ceased to consider the ex-Vice'-Presiderit
of Salvador "a good thing" any longer,
and he was invited to pay up his arrears
or seek another retreat. He sought an
other retreat, and now Mrs. Apel, tired
of waiting, intends to have the general
up on a plebeian order of examination to
Jind out whether he is in a position or not
to pay for the eighteen French dinners
that he and his friend enjoyed nearly . a
year ago. _______^____^
BARK HUNTER
TO GO NORTH
Taken From Her Berth to Fit
Out for Gold-Hunting
on Rivers.
Will Carry a Small Steamer to Be
Used for Prospecting
Purposes. â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 1.
The bark Hunter was towed out of the
creek to-night and taken across the bay
to fit out for Alaska. The bark has been
purchased by a Chicago company, of
which Engineer A. C. Rumble is the local
representative, and will be started north
as soon as possible.
"Our expedition is an entirely new one,"
said Mr. Rumble to-night, "and we do not
expect to do anything but prospect along
the rivers this summer. We have a.
steamer In sections all ready to go north
and with it will go a dredging apparatus
for finding out the depth, value and. na
ture of the bedrocks of the rivers. We'
have a concession of twenty miles on
four rivers from the Canadian Govern
ment" and we believe that they all have
gold in their beds. The original infentlon
was to fit out at Seattle, but I induced
my people to do all the purchasing here
for this purpose wo have bought the
Hunter.
"After prospecting and finding out what
Is needed, we shall come back and have
adequate dredging apparatus built and go
to work in earnest. Thtf Hunter is a
stanch vessel and we have had three sur
veys made and all have been satisfa*
tory. We shall have another one made
as soon as she is off the bank and on
the other side of the bay."

ment at the university. The editorial in
question is headed, "Berkeley's. Disgrace,"
It recounts the former, experience which
the Berkeley faculty had with, the "beei

president and faculty to put a stop, to the
gradual movement which, is said to have

Years ago students, of. the University, of Cali

. thf-y .were pleased to call the "Beer Bust.' !
Presumably it. was copied after some semi
heathen .orgie of medieval Gerinahy. : in; no
other, part 6f the American continent have we
ever heard of a. similar observance among stu
dents. The custom was tolerated until it be
came so. disgraceful that the then president of
the university determined to break it up. The
students were warned and. most obeyed..th e in
junction. A few. disobeyed and were brought
to account. .As we now . remember, several
were, suspended arid two ..or fhreis were ex
pelled. That bo incensed certain brewers of
influence that they determined to drive the

. ' Indeed; until .-recently we supposed it had
passed away forever. Little by little, how
â ever, it: has crept back; and last week, on the
â evening before the. Charter day celebration, a
secluded nook on the Berkeley campus was the
scene of a most disgraceful revel. During the
day tickets were, quletry sold to students who
wished to engage in the carousal,, a quantity of
bfpr was- procured, and late at night a large

We. are. sure the revelers of last week do not
â¢represent the students. In any ; >r sense. The
vast majority loathe such conduct/ It is, as
one Ftudein says, an expression of all. that is
beastly in the very scunV of student society.
We trust the great body of Christian students
at Berkeley will put on. record their protest
against such barbarism by their fellow stu
dents. And can we not . rely, upon President
Kellogg and the faculty to purge the university
of students ; who haye so low a. sense of

Investigation' shows that there Is some
baisis for the statements made in the edi
torial, but It is .maintained that the facts
have been grossly â¢ exaggerated. It is
olainted that nobody was "beastly drunk"
and that. the individuals Wha participated
in the affair-Were mostly: outsiders who
had gone, upon the hill at the back of the
university in the. expectation, of seeing
a rush between the freshmen arid sopho
moTes, the sophomores having started out
to place their cluss number fln the hill.

Hopper Waxes Wroth.
BERKELEY, April I.â Editor Hopper
in to-day's Occident strongly denounces
a supposed correspondent of the Ynle
Alumni Weekly at the University of Cali
fornia, who sent to that paper a derisive
article on the recently dedicated "Senior
C." The unknown writer, w-ho, Hopper
believes, la a Yale alumnus at Berkeley, is
scored as follows:
"The Senior C may be ridiculous, may
be an evirnp'e of our childishnfss in
seeking to manufacture college customs;
our athletic methods may be immensely
funny. But we want the man who thinks
so to say so in our faces, and not to make
us ridiculous before strangers. Such pro
ceeding ia treacherous and cowardly. We
have given our opinion of such an indi
vidual and we think that, if ever found,
he will discoverâ be he student, Janitor or
professorâ that, with many faults, there
is enough college spirit and force of opin
ion here at the college of which he is a
member and which he bo maliciously de
rides to make his position absolutely un
tenable."
New Athletic Constitution.
BERKELEY, April I.â Representative
James Hopper, who was appointed by the
executive committee of the Athletic As
soiclatlon to draw up, in conjunction with
Prof essor â  Edwards, a new constitution
for the association, stated that the draft
ing of the document had just been com
pleted, and that it would be presented to
the committee at its next meeting. "The
proposed new constitution," he said, "is
in general a codification of existing regu
lations, the principal new feature being
the provision for a paid and bonded treas
urer and the enlargement of the powers,
not of any individual, but of the athletic
committee.."

Three of the most useful tools in the
hor?A racing business indulged in a Jaunt
at ingieside tra.-k yesterday. They were
all of -the feminine persuasion and are
known to the tuff as Tea Rose 111, May
W. and Trolley.. The trio met in the after
jilere, a five-furlong scramble. In the
past, May W looked to. have the "Injun"
Fieri on the other two, and the. highly
educated ones made her a 7 to 10 favorita.
Bookmaker Joe. Rose and the racing firm
â A of Atkiit & .' I-rtttrid'ee seemed to. be im
pressed with the Idea that Tea Rose was
thÂ» right thing, and while everybody was
busy getting aboard Trolley arid May W,
the gentlemen niuned backed the Midlo
thian filly. They were correct in their
prognostications, for. Tea Rosn led from
â /the first Jump, and at the wire beat May
AY out over two lengths in track record
time, 1:00^. Trolley "dogged" it badly the
last quarter; . â 'â¢ â  â¢ â¢
Of the. other events decided the favor
ites captured three. James Tod Sloan
participated in six racos. and managed to
â¢finish first on one occasion.' He is un
doubtedly a great r'der on a good horse,
: but on an even hrtak there are other
pabie men in the saddle:
Rubicon finally became affected with
that turf disease termed speed, and
'turned it loose In the mile run, fifth on
the card. His owner, j'om McGowan,
laid his checks down good and thick in
the ring at odds, of 3 to 1. and the Viig
chestnut horse led throughout, downing
Xewsgatherer a neck at thÂ« wire. Grady,
the favorite, finished fourth.
The fast filly Celoso appears to have
lost her form entirely. She was made an
even money favorite over a band of crabs
Jn the opening six-furlong run, and after
displaying a sharp turn of speed for half
a dozen panels, fell out of it. At the end
.All Smoke won by half a length from
Naranja, the second choice, with Sloan
up. The winner was at one time 20 to 1
In the ring.
The .Vpache gelding Native Son repeat
ed his victory of Wednesday by downing
quite a bunch of. youngsters in the three
and one-half furlong spin, going to the
.post a 2to 1 favorite. While Cold Scratch
and l>a Parasseuse were lighting it out
the last part, Sloan got up with the favor
ite, winning by less than a length. La
Parasseuse quit, permitting Thorpe to
get the place with Gold Scratch.
The wise money sent Ponsovannah to
the post favorite for the. seven-furlong
run, and a splendid piece of riding on the
part of "Skeets" Martin got the money
for midreth's oojt Lord Marmion made
. the running in front to the paddock
where Martin collared him with the first
choice, and then, stalling off Sloan's chal
lenge with Sardonic,. got the verdict over
the latter by. a head in 1:27)4. Mklian the
second choice, was left at the post
Hut six went to the post in the mile
and a quarter run, decided under selling
conditions. AJvarado ruled favorite, and
overhauling Song and Dance the last six
teenth, won all out by a head in 2:09 Dr
Marks finished in tin- show-

. The $5000 California Derby will be the feature

It should prove a rare drawing card.

produce the coin yesterday that was paid him
when the colt was claimed, and has no longer
any claim on the sprinter.!

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 2, 1898.
BUILDING AN
ARMY BRIDGE
National Guardsmen Erect a
Structure Without Ham
mer or Nails.
This Will Be One of the Features of
the Military Display of the
First Infantry.
One of the features of the military dis
play to be given by the companies of the
First Infantry Regiment at the Mechan
ics' Pavilion on the evening of the 22d
inst., will be the building of a bridge
by Company B, Captain George Filmer.
At a practice drill held in the old First
armory on Market street, Thursday
night, by the members of the company
named, there was a demonstration how
soldiers can build a bridge inside of half
an hour without using a nail or hammer,
and making it strong enough for an army
to pass over.
The particular bridge has a fifteen foot
approach on each side of the imaginary
ravine, the bridge proper is twenty-four
feet long and eight feet wide, and is sup
ported in the center from the apex beam
of a truss formed by four by six beams,
the ends of which rest on each side of the i
ravine. The whole structure is of beams, J
planks and three-quarter inch ropes used
for lashings.
Heavy chalk marks on the floor desig
nate the two sides of the ravine or gully
over which none of the builders are per
mitted to step during the building. At
each side close to this line stand a team
of men each having two pieces of rope
over their shoulders, and by the side of
each team are three pieces of ten-foot
timber partly rounded. At the word of
command each team goes to work to lash
the ends of the three pieces of timber
together in such a manner that when
l>la<x-d upright on the free ends they
form a tripod. These four tripods are.
placed at indicated spots, and at a point
three feet from the bottom the teams lash
three by three inch pieces of wood so aa
to form a triangle. These triangles form
the base of support for the cross timbers
on which to rest the floor beams, and
tlip greater the weight the firmer is the
lushing and the more solid the tripods.
While the teams of three men each are
doing this, two other teams are busy
lashing a heavy cross timber to each end
of long beams, one foot from the end.
L.ike work is done on each side of the
ravine. When these are properly lashed, !
the pieces held by guy ropes at the top I
each guided by one man, are brought to
a vertical position and carried forward
by a strong force of men until the foot
of each timber rests against one of the
tripods. Then the beams are lowered
slowly, simultaneously, until they meet
over the center of the ravine, when one
cross beam rests on the other and there
is a perfect truss. Two men climb up !
the sides of the truss and by means of
ropea haul to the apex a four by four !
piece ten feet long which they place in j
the crotch formed by the timbers, lashed !
that firmly, and from the ends fixed guy .
ropes, the loose ends of which are swung i
to the edges.
These being caught are formed
into a loop and in this is placed a heavy
square timber that is allowed to swing
toward the center and in time become the
center support of the bridge. The two
end cross beams being lashpd to the tri
angle of the tripods a twenty-four foot
four by six beam is launched from one
side of the ravine toward the other side.
There is the struggle of the work, for
the men who pu?h the beam have but
little purchase, but by clever maneuver
ing on the other side and a little gym
nafltic exercise the free end is caught by
one of the men and held until it was
shoved over far enough to allow that end
to rest on the other cross beam. The
Bide pieces being in place they are firmly
lashed, a piece of ash wood "is placed in
each of the slings, the ropes are twisted
and by that means the heavy timber at
the bottom of the slings is brought to
Its proper level, the ends secured, and i
the ends of the ash sticks are also se- j
cured. Then it is easy and quick work j
to place in position the timbers for the I
approaches, the floor beams, lash them
â  ,>â¢â  Â»'-â flooring, after which
the bridsre Is ready for use. The boys
have been practicing twice a week for
several weeks, and they expect on ex
hibition nl^ht to be able to put the
bridge together in twenty minutes, and
have it ready in that time for the en
tire regiment to walk over it. The prac
tice reflects great credit on the men,
nearly all of whom are clerks In stores.
Dentists Dine and Discourse.
The Sigma Chapter of the Delta Sigma
Delta Fraternity of the University of
California College of Dentistry held its
seventh annual banquet at the California
Hotel last night. The table was beauti
fully decorated, and, while a string band
charmed away dull care with a number
of lively selections, the guests occupied
themselves in charming away the numer
ous good things that Mine Host Warfield
had provided for their delectation. When
the inner man had received sufficient at
tention Dr. 11. C. Carlton, acting as toast
master, called for order and Introduced a
number of speakers, who had come pre
pared to do, and who did, themselves and
the occasion proud.

Aged Salvation Evangelist Withdrew
When Business Became
Dull.
The Silver State Hotel on Mason
street, a well-known and popular re
sort to those who frequent the tender
loin, has just furnished a strange illus
tration of the fact that business am
bitions and methods often make bed
fellows of men of the most dissimilar
tastes.
It is not perhaps generally known to
the public that there have recently
been quarrels amnnsr the managers of
the place and that S. Silverberg, the

That Charles Montgomery, the Evangelist, Was President
of the Concern.
owner, has had a hard battle to get
possession of his property.
J. T. Wiseman, well known in. the
sporting circles of the city; Ned Foster,
with a long record as proprietor of the
Bella Union and a "good fellow" on
the turf, and Charles Montgomery, the
well-known Salvation evangelist, ran
the Silver State until lately, Montgom
ery's name appearing in the city di
rectory as manager. Various people
who did business with the house when
Charles Montgomery was president and
Wiseman was secretary of the incor
poration, say they had great trouble in
collecting their bills. While the bar and
rooms were paying best Mr. Montgom
ery preached nightly in the basement.
Though Mr. Montgomery, last night
denied that he had been in any manner
connected with the place since last
July, Ned Foster, Contractor Becker,
who built the house; J. Leland, the

Stock.
bellboy, and others, who were at the
house dally, said that Montgomery and
Wiseman called at the desk every day
until two months ago to get their share
of the earnings of the whole house, and
this included, at stated times, rent
from the bar as well as the daily re
ceipts from the rooms frequented by a
class 61 transients well known to the
police.
Most of the paying business of the
house was from transient trade, accord
ing to those most familiar with the pat
ronage that kept it up. While Mr.
Montgomery preached down stairs in
the basement there was always a merry
Jingle of coin over the bar above, and
the hotel clerk took in a pretty good
income from the trade in rooms. It was
the custom of Messrs. Wiseman and
Montgomery to divide the money at 1
o'clock each day.
The business did not thrive very well,
in spite of the fact that the lessees of
the barroom and restaurant said that

many of their bills were collected by
the corporation and never turned over
to them, so Ned Foster, having a wide
acquaintance with the class of people
likely to cater to the goods sold at the
hotel, was induced to buy some stock.
At a meeting attended by Messrs.
Wiseman and Montgomery, as well as
by some of the stockholders Ned was
elected president of the company, but
he found so many debts that it was
hard to make a ship sail smoothly.
He tried to settle matters "on the
square," but found it a bad entangle
ment all through.
Meantime Landlord Silverberg found
that the concern owed him $1200 in
rent. When he appealed to the new
president to settle it the old Bella
Union manager winked and said, "I am
surprised that these people have sold
me stock when they owe debts. Of
course I know nothing of this."
The matter was compromised by
Landlord Silverberg, who is eager
for a new management. He gave a re
ceipt in full for the rent and paid Presi
dent Montgomery and Secretary Wise
man $350 to vacate the premises. Ned
Foster still holds the foTt, as does J.
B. Leland, proprietor of the bar.
Mrs. Gale, formerly of 17 Stockton
street, is now conducting the hotel
along the same lines as those pursued
by Mr. Montgomery and his associates,
though she says she will pay her help.
Ned Foster still claims to be presi
dent of the company, though he has
Bold a great deal of his stock to his
wife and others. Landlord Silverberg
feels better that he has the house run
ning under the new management.
When Charles Montgomery was seen
regarding the matter last night he
said: "The fact is I quit the hore!
when they opened up the oar, and I
have had nothing to do with it since
last July. I could not stand the sa
loon business, and I think a pretty
hard crowd has succeeded me, as I
hear they are running a saloon."

Criminal Appeal Cases.
The Supreme Court has cited County
Clerk Curry to appear before it next Mon
day and show cause why he has failed to
carry out the law relating to printing of
the records of criminal cases now on ap
peal to the Supreme Court. There should
be fifteen copies of the appeal, record, and
bill of exceptions, the costs of which are
to be paid by the county in which the
cases occur. The County Clerk has re
cently found that there is a shortage in
the sum appropriated for this purpose by
the Supervisors. These proceedings have
been begun as a test case by Attorney
Cook, whose client, John Black, is now
in the county jail becauso his case can
not be heard for the reason given.

Cook sat in bank yesterday to hear the

ing of the cases against Feusier and Hart

Another Will Contest Started.
Anna B. Phelps filed a contest yester
day to the probating of the will of her
aunt, Mary P. Merchant, who died Janu
ary 22 last, in Alameda County, leaving
quite a valuable estate. The claim is
made that the testatrix was of unsound
mind and unduly influenced by Tremont
Wood and his wife, -who are the prin

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 2, 1898.
PREPARING FOR A BIG BATTLE.
"Mexican Pete," Who Is Matched to Fight Jim Jeffries.
Last evening the Olympic Club matched Pete Everett, alias Mexican
Pete, to fight Jim Jeffries on April 26 a twenty-round contest in the gym
nasium of the club.
When the match was first spoken of the members poohpoohed the idea
of, pitting a man like Mexican Pete against the coming champion heavy
weight, but when Pete's backers came forward with a small sack of gold
Matchmaker Kennedy commenced to make inquiries about the stranger. He
discovered that Pete has had thirty-eight battles, all of which he won
easily.
His last fight was in Cripple Creek, where he disposed of Billy Woods of
Denver last February in six rounds. Woods was knocked down eight
times during the contest. Joe Choynski fought Billy Woods in this city
in 1891, and was declared winner after a battle that lasted thirty-four
rounds. Then Choynski was a top-notch fighter.
Jim Williams of Salt Lake stood eight rounds before Sharkey and Pete
put Williams to sleep in six rounds.
The champion heavy-weight of Colorado is a very deceptive fellow. He
looks to weigh about 165 pounds, but when he stepped on the scales yester
day he turned the beam at 210 pounds. Pete stands 6 feet % inch and
weighs in condition 195 pounds. He is 23 years of age and is managed by
Jim Carr, whose training quarters are on the corner of Sutter street and
Central avenue.
According to an agreement signed by the men last evening hitting in
the breakaway is allowed. The pugilists will receive 60 per cent of the
gross receipts; the winner takes 60 per cent and the loser 40 per cent.
It is said that the club will charge members $1 50 and their friends who
are not members will be taxed $3. The event of the evening will be pre
ceded by a fifteen-round contest between McConnell and Kid Parker â that is,
provided the lightweights will consent to fight for a reasonable considera
tion.
NEW CEMETERY
FOR BERKELEY
Peralta Park to Be Trans-
formed Into a Bury-
ing Ground.
Seventy - Two Acres, Com
manding a Beautiful View
of the Bay, Secured.
The Work of Preparing the Grounds
and Building n Crematory to
Beyin at Once.
Berkeley and its environs are to have
one of the most beautiful cemeteries in
the State. Several months ago articles
of incorporation of the new company
were filed in Oakland, and since then the
work of securing a suitable site has been
in progress. The company is composed
of well-known capitalists, who guaran
teed ail the funds necessary for the pur
chase of land.
After mature deliberation Peralta Park
and adjoining properties were decided up
on as the most suitable location, and the
company has already purchased thewhole
of Peralta Park, consisting of twenty-six
acres, and an adjoining tract of forty
six acres, formerly owned by the Bella
View Homestead Association, making
seventy-two acres secured already. There
is still another tract of twenty-two acres,
held by the Sacramento Bank, which the
company is negotiating for with every
prospect of success. When that is se
cured it will give a total of ninety-four
acres in one of the most beautiful local
ities in California.
laying on the western slope of the Con
tra Costa hills it is directly opposite the
Golden Gate, and commands a panoramic
view of the bay, islands and San Francis
co and the Marin shores. A gentle slope
toward the bay gives it ample drainage,
and it is the intention of the company to
proceed at once with the laying out of the
grounds.
For that purpose the landscape gardener
who had charge of Cypress Lawn Ceme
tery has been engaged, and will be given
carte blanche to arrange the drives,
walks, plats and floral banks as he Bees
fit.
The company has money enough on
hand to build a handsome gate at the en
trance to the grounds and to complete
the walks and drives, and bonds will be
issued shortly for the purpose of erecting
a crematory second to none In the United
States.
Several societies, including tho Masons
and Knights of Honor, besides a large
number of private individuals, have al
ready subscribed for plats in the new
cemetery, and It is the aim of the com
pany to dispose of lots and plats at a
price that will not be a tax upon the
average citizen. At preaent all the cem
eteries in the vicinity of the bay charge
the most exorbitant rates for plats, the
prevailing prices per square foot being
almost equal to those for the choicest lo
cations on Market street in the neighbor
hood of the Claus Spreckels building.
Besides, the new company will make
sweeping cuts in the rates for incinera
tion. The fixed price at all the crema
tories now is $50, while at the East such
service is performed for $10 to $15. The
Peralta Park Association, as soon as its
crematory is constructed, will fix the
price somewhere near the Eastern rates.
The need of another cemetery has long
been manifest on the east side of the bay.
At present the only repository of the dead
anywhere near Oakland is Mountain "View
Cemetery, which must also answer for a
large part of Contra Costa County, as
well as Berkeley. Alameda and Oakland.
Mountain View is entirely inadequate to
meet the demands, even though the rates
for plats and single lots have been ad
vanced to the highest figures. The Berke
ley cemetery will be more convenient for
corteges from Contra Costa, as well as a
thickly settled portion of Alameda Coun
ty. It is expected that the grounds will
be laid out and ready for the reception of
bodies within a few months.
First Picnic of the Season.
The Amerlcus Club has made the an
nouncement that Harbor View will be
opened by the first picnic Ui the season
at that place to-morrow. The simple an
nouncement that the "AmericuÃ Club" Is
giving a picnic is In itself all sufficient to
bring the white lawn dresses of the pretty-
San Francisco girla from the wajdrobeau
And, it is also needless to add, that the
boys will be there in their spring suits,
as the Americus Club heretofore has had
the credit of giving an up-to-date picnic.
This year will hardly be any exception
to this established rule. There will be
prizes for the best dajicers, one being a
gold watch and chain.
DEATH OF MRS. CLUNIE.
Wife of the Insurance Commissioner
Succumbs to an Attack of
Heart Disease.
General sorrow is expressed for the
sudden death of Mrs. Andrew J. Clunie,
the wife of the Insurance Commissioner,
who succumbed to a chronic affection of
the heart early yesterday morning. Mrs.
Clunie had been ailing for some time, but
it was not until a few days before her
death that she became critically ill.
Everything possible was done by Drs.
Spencer, Gardner and Maclttonagle to save
the unfortunate woman's life, but with
out avail, and after a brief struggle she
quietly passed away at her home on De
Long avenue.
She was 30 years of age, and before her
marriage was well known as Miss May
M. Redfield, a daughter of a naval offi
cer and a distant relative of ex-Secretary
of State Bayard. She leaves no children.
THE GARCELON ESTATE.
Bill of Review Filed by Rodgers &
Paterson Asking for a Reversal
of the Decree.
The law firm of Rodgers & Paterson
yesterday filed a bill of review in equity
in the United States Circuit Court in the
case of George W. Reed, as administra
tor of the estate of Catherine M. Gar
celon and James P. Merritt. against John
A. Stanly, the trustees of Bowdoin Col
lege and others.
The bill recites that Stanly, who is one
of the plaintiffs in the original bill, is
hostile to the relief suit, "being only
falsely and fraudulently named as a de
fendant." The bill asked that the decree
already made in the case be dismissed.
NO MUSICIANS
NEEDED HERE
The Local Union Warns Them
to Keep Away From San
Francisco.
Ssilors Are Successful In Obtaining
an Inorsase in Their
Wages.
Residents of San Francisco pride them
selves on the fact that this is a great
music-loving community, but the 800 odd
musicians who hold membership cards in
the local Musicians' Uniori incline to
somewhat different views, as they are at
present advertising broadcast throughout
the country that this city is overstocked
with musicians, those here cannot find
enough to do to keep the gaunt wolf
of starvation a safe distance away
from their doors, and warn all who seek
to earn their living by filling the air with
melody, or something which will go by
that name, to give the metropolis of the
Pacific Coast a wide berth.
At the meeting of the Labor Council
last night the representatives of the Mu
sicians' Union reported this state of af
fairs, and supplemented with a sugges
tion that in view of this fact union men
should redouble vigilance to watch out
for "scab" music wherever they go. As
an instance two picnics which are about
to be run by local organizations for which
non-union music has been engaged were
particularly pointed out, and union men
throughout the city will be warned to
keep away from them. The trouble at
the Olympia music hall has been bridged
over for the present and an amicable set
tlement is expected.
The sailors report that they are meet
ing with encouraging successes in en
forcing a higher schedule of wages, and It
is expected that the old scale of '91 will
soon be fully in force again. Sailors all
along the coast are being urged to ship
by the voyage rather than the month, and
whenever these arrangements can he
made It means good wages for the trip,
with nothing to do but steer and trim
sails.
The Capron Will Contest.
Judge Ooffey yesterday made an order
removing ex-Judge A. L. Fitzgerald as
special administrator of the will of the
late John S. Capron, the capitalist.
Capron left the bulk of his valuable estate
to Fitzgerald, and his step-daughters en
tered a contest and broke the will. It is
the intention of Fitzgerald to carry the
case on appeal to the Supreme Court
A CONFLICT
CANNOT BE
AVERTED
Men of the Army Now
Consider That War
Is Inevitable.
Governor Budd Remarks
That "California Will
Be in Line."
Extra Activity Is Observab
the Lime Point Forti
fications.
READY TO LEAD TROOPS.
General Shafter Will Personally In
spect the Defensive Works at
Ballast Point, San Diego.
Officers and enlisted men of the
United States army, who have contend
ed all along that war might be averted
by diplomacy, now consider that the
chances of peace are remote and that
an armed collision is inevitable. Men
of the army, as a rule, talk little of
war, but the subject nevertheless is one
that causes them to profoundly reflect.
If a conflict comes history will repeat
itself. Those who talk loudest and
breathe fire and blood In public will be
at home or some other safe retreat
when the supreme test of battle comes.
When peace is restored they will be in
front again, claiming honors, emolu
ments and offices in reward for loyalty
displayed when the nation was in peril.
In all this war talk Governor Budd
remains calm and contemplative. He
does not care to be quoted as express
ing any opinion as to what he shall do
when the crisis comes. He says dis
tinctly, however, that California will
be in line with her sister States ready
to perform any duty required for the
maintenance of national honor and dig
nity. The Governor has observed the
proceedings of the New York, Ohio and
lowa Legislatures in appropriating
means to be employed in the event of
war, but the observation has not caused
him to consider the subject of calling
an extra session of the California Leg
islature. He remarked yesterday: "No
State in tv><* Union is in better condi
tion than California."
The Governor is well informed con
cerning the strength and efficiency of
the National Guard of this State. He
knows also the weak places in the or
ganization of the State troops and has
taken into account the probable ser
vice which the troops would be called
upon to perform in the case of a war
between the United States and Spain.
He is also well posted regarding the
ability and experience of individual of
ficers and has in his possession the
names of men who have signified a
readiness to lend a helping hand in the
organization and discipline of troops.
Eugene P. Murphy, who graduated
from the West Point Military Academy
in 1867 and subsequently resigned from
the army to engage in business, has
tendered his services to the Secretary
of War. He believes that a regiment
of resolute young Irish-ittnericais
could be recruited readily at the Mis
sion.
Colonel John S. Mosby has recently
received many letters from men who
rode and fought with him in Virginia.
They are anxious that he should lead
a mounted expedition in a cai.ipa.ign In
Cuba and express a desire 111 1 follow
where he leads. Colonel Mosby has
offered his services to the Government.
Several army officers stationed at the
Presidio have filed with the depart
ment commander, General Shafter, ap
plication for 'transfers to enable them
to serve at the front. It is the com
mon belief among army men that San
Francisco in the event of war between
the United States and Spain would be
remote from the scenes of actual bat
tle. The command of a volunteer regi
ment is a prize which many a young
officer contemplates and hopes to gain.
General Shafter kindly listens to all the
applicants and takes the applications
into consideration.
There is every indication that Gen
eral Wilson, chief of the Engineer Corps
of the United States army, .has received
quite a liberal allowance for carrying
out the plans adopted by the board of
fortifications for the defense of the har
bor of San Francisco. While the strict
est secrecy is enjoined upon the engi
neer officers of this division the fact
transpires that two hundred mechanics
and laborers have been engaged to
work at Lime Point.
The artillerymen now occupying the
barracks belonging to the engineers
have been asked to find other quarters
so that the force of workmen under
the direction of the Engineer Corps may
be housed. Tents may be sent over to
Fort Baker for the soldiers of that gar
rison.
The extensive character of the work
In contemplation at Lime Point leads
to the belief that an allowance has
been made from the recent appropria
tion of $50,000,000 for the construction
of a new line of works at that local
ity. Obviously the Government intends
to prepare to meet an side complica
tion growing out of a collision with
Spain. When war begins no one can
tell where it will end and how many
parties may be brought into the strug
gle. Should European or South Amer
ican sympathy be strong enough to
give Spain allies San Francisco might
become an object of attack.
General Shafter, the department
commander, has decided to personally
inspect the harbor defenses of San Di
ego. Accompanied by Lieutenant John
D. Miley. Fifth Artillery, aid and en
gineer officer, he will leave the city to
morrow for Ballast Point. Additional
guns may be mounted at the San Di
ego fortifications and more troops sent
to that point. One battery of the
Third Artillery constitutes the present
garrison. Special orders directing the
inspection of the Ballast Point works
and San Diego barracks were issued
from department headquarters yester
day.
A New Stamp Clerk.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch yes
terday appointed W. H. Harrison as
stamp clerk in the i-.os Angeles office in
place of Freeman G. Teed, resigned. The
reason, for Mr. Toed's resignation is said
to be railing eyesight.
The Modern Generation of Men.
Physically men are better to-day than ever
before. Our college youth are, as a general
thing, magnificent specimens. The constitu
tionally weak and nervous, though they may
never become athletes, can greatly increase
their strength and restore tranquillity to the
nervous system by the efficient aid of Hoetet
ter's Stomach Bitters, which also removes ma
larial, kidney, dyspeptio and bilious trouble*

The San Jose Bench Show, which is the
canine sensation of the week, is fully re
ported in another column.. The campaign
of- secession from the American Kennel
Club, inaugurated by the Pacific Mastiff
Club some weeks ago, seems to be lan
guishing. At any rate the proposed con
vention of rebel- clubs has not yet mate
rialized. Possibly the adverse resolutions
of the St. Bernard Club have to some ex
tent chilled the ardor of the advocates of
independence.'
This' much, is admitted, that the San

split up into two camps.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 2, 1898.
ANGLING IS NOW
A SPORT
GREATLY ENJOYED
Friday Is a very appropriate day for
the opening of a trout-fishing season.
Last evening, several anglers who could
not resist the temptation of a whip at
some favorite stream, returned from the
country with baskets filled with smalt
fishes. The unlucky ones said that the
opening day of ihe trout-fishing season
should be changed from April 1 to some
other day. Anglers not acquainted with
the fishing waters within easy reach of
this city can find the Information they
desire by scanning over an article which
appeared in the sporting department of
last Saturday's Call.
Lovers of the sport who returned last
evening from the country reported that
the streams are low and clear and the
lish very shy.
The Paper-mill ajid Lagunitas Creeks
were whipped by quite a number of
"opening-day ers," and although some
very nice trout were caught, the majority
of the whippers had creels which con
tained fingerlings, averaging five and six
inches in length. J. Moran caught four
trout ni-ar the headwaters of Lagunitas,
the smallest of which weighed half a
pound and the largest 3VÂ£ pounds. The
gentleman had also several nice pan fish |
in his basket. He stated that he had seen j
quite a number of large fish, which darted
into deep water the instant they saw
danger near. Had it not been for a cold
and blustering wind, fishing in the vicin
ity of Libertys would have been good
yesterday.
The most favorable reports were re
ceived from anglers who fished Boulder
Creek, Los Gatos Creek and the tesca
dero lagoon. The following letter from |
Cloverdale which was received last Mon- j
day speaks for itself:
Replying to your telegram regarding fishing
in this vlcintiy, will state I am informed of its
being good. All tributaries to Big Sulphur are
said to be first class. The water is about high
enough and clear. If we don't get any more
ruin before the Ist of April to raise and rile
the water there will be good sport. The higher
up into the mountains the better the fishing.
Yours respectfully, F. S. FIELD.
A dispatch received last evening from
Cloverdale said that excellent catches
were made yesterday between Cloverdale
and the Geysers.
Whippers will be out to-day and to
morrow in strong force and as the creeks
are low and clear it is thought that large
numbers of baby trout will be creeled by
those who take a pleasure in playing
hog. Trout under four inches should be
returned to the stream, dead or alive.
, As the weather has been quite cold for
; the past few weeks, it is said that the
trout of strfams north of this city have
not yet commenced to rise to flies. A
few days of sunshine will, however, make
a change for the better. The spoon and
spinner should prove killing lures to-day
: and to-morrow.
As stated in yesterday's Call the wood
choppers who have been cutting timber
near Lagunitas Creek for some months
past have ruined the fishing of that beau
j tiful stream to a great extent by plac
! ing dynamite cartridges in the deep pools.
| A Deputy Fish Commissioner has been
) on the lookout for the vandals, but his
i efforts to make a capture have proved
i futile. Last Tuesday llfty dead fish,
ranging in size from three inches to six
teen Inches, were taken from a pool about
i one mile above the point where the LaÂ»
; gunitas meets the Paper Mill Creek.
It is said that the Spring Valley Com
pany will open San Andreas Lake to an*..
i lers in May. The water is extremely low
i this year.
The small spinners which AI Wilson re-
I cently completed are trout killers of the
; first water. Yesterday an angler caught
i thirty nice fish with one of the spin
ners In Boulder Creek.
Messrs. Mansfield and Bogart will whip
i the headwaters of the Big Sulphur to
i day, and if the weather is not too cold
i they will enjoy good sport.
Doctor Brooks, J. Ramond Lyson and
James Watt are whipping Paper Mill
Creek with spoons and flies. Some nice
fish were taken yesterday.
Practically a Railroad Victory.
The jury in the case of Mrs. Ellen Silk,
wife of P. J. Silk, who sought to recover
$20,000 damages from the Market Street
Hallway Company, was unable to agree
and was last evening discharged by Judge
Hunt. Mrs. Silk claimed that she was
thrown to the pavement and badly bruised
by the sudden starting of a car of the
Mission street electric line, while alight
iog at ttid corner of Preclta avenue.
PROSPEROUS DAYS
FOR THE
OWNERS OF HOUNDS
These are the days when the grey
hounds enjoy the wholesome plenty of
training and their owners the plenty that
Is consequent upon the most liberal purses
ever hung up in the history of coursing
in America. At both Ingleside and Union
Parks to-day the stakes are exceptionally
large, and as high-class greyhounds are
e-ntered first-class sport should result. At
Union Park the leashmen should witness
close and exciting courses, as several new
dogs, which are not generally known to
the coursing fraternity, will make their
Inaugural appearance on the sward. The
managers of the park have weeded out
a large number of hares that had a
sickly appearance, and as a consequence
long and grueling courses should result
to-day and to-morrow. The Call tipped
fourteen winners out of fifteen courses in
last Sunday's run down of the stake.
The probable winners at Union Park to
day aro: Patria, Forget, Lissak, False
Flatterer, Flying Buck, Eclipse, Master
Jack, Jester, Mountain Lassie, Monotony,
Pat Malloy, Magic, Electric, Theron, Fear
Not, Alameda, Move On, Little Pete,
Harkaway, Arapahoe, Lord Byron. Sajita
Alecia, Rosette, Promise Me, Moore"s
Prescription, Myrtle, Royal Buck, Rusty
Gold, Spring, Camilla, Kilkenny Girl
and Mercy May.
Two events will be run off at Ingleside,
a stake for the top nutchers and a puppy
contest. The candidates for both are of
the highest class, embracing stake win
ners of the past and many that have only
missed a winning bracket by a turn of the
hare or some like trivial chance. Torrid
sport, in consequence, promises to be
forthcoming from the start. The running
begins to-day at 1 p. m., and to-morrow
at 11 a, m., with the puppies first in the
slips.
When the purses have been distributed
at Ingleside to-morrow night the Ingle
side management will have disbursed con
siderably over $8500 in prize money alone
since the first of the year. Were poor
Mike Kelly still alive he might alter his
once popular song to "Papa won't you
buy me a greyhound?"
Tim Cronin has two new arrivals in
his kennel. One is a Skyball puppy and
the other a puppy by Jack Dempsey-Wee
Lassie that arrived from Merced yester
day.
Connell Bros.' puppy, Log Boy, should
make a good showing at Ingleside to-day.
In his own class he already has a winning
bracket to his credit, while among the
old dogs a few weeks ago he pulled down
third money, even over such clever per
formers as Magnet, Glenroy, Bendalon,
Van Cloie, Old Glory and divers others.
The hares at Incrleside have been given
considerable attention this week. It has
been the aim of Superintendent Reilly to
weed out the weaker jacks, and in so far
as was possible this has been accom
plished.
Dave Hooper's Koolawn is making an
other bid for the money at Ingleside this
week. Koolawn has been pulling down
third and fourth moneys with considera
ble regularity of late, and Dave says he
will keep her at it until she lands at the
head of the class, if it takes him all
summer.
The likeliest winners at Ingleside this
afternoon appear to be as follows: All
age stake â Princess Marie, Moondyne,
Koolawn, Coralie, Pirenzi, Glenroy,
Right Bower, Handball, Connemara,
Mystic Maid, Old Glory, Tessie Fair,
Johnny R. Hercules, Senortta, Nelly
Conroy, Nelly B, Bendalong, Van KnaDP
Flashlight. '
Puppy stakeâ Killarney Lass, Star
Pointer, Bonita, Sunburst, White Wings,
Palmer Hill, Moonlight Chippy, Log Boy.
Three or four new kennels will be repre
sented at Ingleside to-day. Among them
will be that of M. Nealon, who purcnased
Van Knapp and Van Cloie at the Van
Hummel sale; also that of Brown &

COLLEGE MEN
OUT
FOR RECORDS.
One week from to-day the first Inter
collegiate baseball game will be played.
Then for a month every Saturday will
find the town a-flutter with the red of
Stanford and the blue and gold of Califor
nia. The struggles on the diamond are
dated for April 9, 16 and 30; the field day
is set for April 23.
Following the precedent set In former
years the two colleges are at present en
gaged in a furnace-like altercation over
the locality and the time for the bicycle
race. The Olympic track is totally un
suited for cycling races, and it is almost
destructive to life to attempt to run a
fast race on it. California has conceded
to Stanford the right of selection of either
the place or time, but Stanford will not
be placated by aoy such concession. It
was almost tacitly understood that the
race was to be run at San Jose. This
is Stanford's choice, but a "rider" was
attached to it, that the race must be
scheduled for the day preceding the inter
collegiate meet. California positively re
fuses to comply with this second demand,
and there the matter rests. It will be
remembered that at the last moment a
year ago complications arose which were
almost instrumental in preventing the
field day.
This afternoon at Berkeley the annual
championship games will draw a large
crowd of spectators, for the athletic flower
of the university will compete. It is
thought that many records will be anni
hilated. Drum will try for a new record
in the 220-yard run. He has covered that
distance in 23 seconds on a curved track,
attempt to improve on
that performance.
Ray Carroll will try for a new record
in the mile run. Should the record be
broken medal which John Elliott of
fered some years ago will be worn for
the first time. Walsh, the mile walker,
is also out for record honors. Guiberson,
the weight man, is another looking for
the laurels of transcendent success and
his special effort will be conined to toss
ing the shot over forty feet.
The list of entries for the championship
field day are as follows:
One hundred yard dashâ C. Hinz 01, E.

The return of Dozier to the track at
California has strengthened the team
somewhat. With a weak knee he has
done some remarkable work. His record
In the high jump comes very close to six
feet, and In the distance jump he has
covered twenty-two feet of earth.
The baseball teams of both universities
have been practically formed. At Stan
ford the men who will represent the car
dinal are Strohn. catcher; Beckett and
Lannigan, pitchers; Young first base:
Harris, second base; Lougheed, short
stop; Klauber, third base; Edwards, right
field; Wright, center field; Murphy, left
field. The blue and gold will have for

After the field day on the Berkeley cin
der path a ball game, will be played be
tween the university nine and the alumni.
They will line up as follows:

RACKET WIELDERS
ON THE COURTS.
The try-out tournament of the Univer
sity of California tennis men will be
played this afternoon on Oakland courts.
The winners in this competition will be
selected to meet Stanford in the annual
games. Sumner Hardy has a tight hold
on first place, but there will be a hard
rub for the selection of the other blue
and gold representative.
There is a movement in tennis circles
to have tournaments, singles and doubles,
in the bay cities every two weeks. If
the plan can be effected the first tourna
ment will be held at San Jose, on the
Hotel Vendome courts, about the end of
the month. After that the tournament
promoters have picked San Rafael for the
scene of their activities.
It looks as if a number of Easterners
would be brought out this autumn. After
the Newport tournament, in which the
champions of the country compete, no
tennis of any importance holds these
players in the East. Two years ago an
attempt was made to bring out Wrenn,
Hovey and Lamed. but the bottom
dropped out of it at the last moment.
This year there will be a more system
atic trial to have the champions of the
United States visit this coast. If the
plan proves feasible the stellar wonders
of the tennis firmament will be out here
in September, the time of the Pacific
Coast championship doubles' tournament.
At the California Club courts the week
has been a quiet one. The Whitneys have
rested after their struggle on the Placer
county courts. Some of the matches
played during the week are worthy of
mention. J. A. Code beat Dr. Root 6-4,
6-4, 4-6, 7-9, 6-3. Alice Hoffman beat Jack
Carrigan 6-1, 6-2. Miss Bowman defeated
Grace Nolton 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. G. Smith and
Kellogg succumbed to Stauf and Walter
6-4, 6-4, 7-5. Miss Clark and Miss Hoff
man beat Miss Hunter and Miss Bowman
7-5, 6-4. Miss Hoffman beat Miss Clark
6-4. In three sets between Bradshaw and
Bliver, the latter took none. Bliver re
turned the compliment in three straight
sets with Dr. Root and made matters
even in sets.
UNIVERSITY NINES
CROSS BATS TO-DAY.
The crack baseball players of Stanford
University will cross bats to-day with
the nine which will represent the Uni
versity of Nevada. The following letter
from The Call's correspondent contains
the latest athletic news:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 1.
There has been little done on the track or
the field this week. Many of the athletes are
away taking advantage of the week allowed
by the college for recuperation. Most of those
who have remained at the university have been
doing light work or laying off altogether. Cap
tain Jack Brunton is expected before the sth.
With him In the sprints Stanford's dash men
will be far from a weak aggregation.
On the diamond there has been dally prac
tice. Coach Jack Sheehan has been doing effi
cient work with the team. A lack of ginger
and a weakness with the stick are the faults
which he has been most desirous of overcom-
ing.
The varsity left on the 9:30 train to-day on
its way to Reno, where it will cross bats with
the University of Nevada nine on Saturday.
As soon as the game is over the team will
gather up Its bats and return home, arriving
on the campus Sunday.
Considerable Interest has been manifested
over the selection of the team for this trip, for
it Is conceded that the men chosen to go against
the Reno boys would in all events make up the
nine that Stanford will put in the field in the
lirst intercollegiate match, which takes place
on the 9th of April. The players and their po
sitions for the Reno game are as follows:
Stanford. Position. Univ. of Nevada.
Strohn Catcher Stoddard

HANDBALL PLAYED

ship; George Bates and Gus Koster, for
the heavy-weight championship.
WEATHER MAN PREDICTS RAIN
It Fell in the Northern Part of the
State Yesterday Afternoon.
William H. Hammon of the Weather
Bureau predicts, as a result of the high
northwesterly wind of yesterday after
noon, a possible fall of rain here this
morning 1 or some time to-day. An area
of low pressure prevailed In Southern
and Eastern California yesterday, and
was the direct cause of the wind upon
the coast.
Rain fell from Eureka northward yes
terday afternoon, and there was also ram
in Oregon and Washington. The present
prevailing low area will in all probabili
ty work its way through Arizona to
ward the East. Last night the tempera
ture was falling in Northern California,
and there will be clear and cold weather
ia that section to-day.

teams from the Olympic Club Wheelmen
and the Olympic Cyclers, under the aus
pices of the Cycle Clubs' Baseball League.
As is well known, these two organizations
thrive under one rqof, the Olympic Club,
yet there is a great deal of animosity be
tween the two factions. The Olympio
Wheelmen are acknowledged champions
on the road and track, but when it comes
to baseballâ well, the Olympic Cyclers
think they can teach them a thing or two.
In the Cycle' Clubs'. League the Olympio
Cyclers have yet tp meet defeat, while
the Olympic Wheelmen have lost one
game and ha.ye a tie yet to play off.

Woman's Drawback.
BUSINESS MEN CANNOT. DEPEND

They Are 111 Too Often Because Negligent
. of Their Healthâ A Business
Woman's Telling Words.
From the Free Press, Detroit, Mich.
The greatest drawback to-day with
women that Work in the. stores and fac
tories is that they do not take the right
care of. their health. 'Business men fre
quently say they can't depend on women
because they are ill too often. If every
young woman would take the right care
of herself this. complaint would never be
i heard. I â¢
; Many thousands of young women are
working, suffering agonies that would
force a . man to a siak bed. They bear'
their .tortures in silence because of their
inborn modesty and blame ' their mother
for not advising them. â¢ â¢*
Mrs. C..W. Mansfield of 58 Farrar street,
Detroit, Mich., is a business woman, and
a successful one, too. Employing many
I young women and having years of expe
rience in the business world, she is in
position to speak of women who earn a
livelihood.
"For years." she says, "I suffered In
silence, and was so . worn â¢ out â¢at night
i that I could not sleep. I visited a female
! specialist, who said I had a complication.
|of ailments peculiar to women. I could
I not find relief from her remedies and had
tried so . â  many kinds of medicine that I
I had given up all hope of' ever getting
i better. ...

Pink' Pills for Pale People,' by a young
lady .in my employ. ' The first box gave
me much relief and I was able to rest at
night for the first time in many months. "
"I then bought more, pills, ana ; - - I
must have used a dozen boxes in my own
case, but have given away to suffering
| women double 'that amount. Without a
j doubt these pills are a good medicine, for
i they cured me and have : cured several

"These, pills .certainly build 1 up the ner

"As a business woman. I am : pleased to

me than any physician, and I can â¢: give
Dr. i Williams' Pink â¢ Pills for Pale People

til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary

which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
the expense that may be incurred in
case the Supervisors shall not pass an
ordinance for said improvement.

ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
i pose and intention of the people of the
, City and County that its public utilities
i shall be gradually acquired and ulti
''â  mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
! the date upon which this Charter shall
| go into effect, and at least every two
I years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and '
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
I works, steam, water or electric power
I works, telephone lines, street railroads
! and such other public utilities as the
I Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
i of water works by the City and County, I
! the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
I the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after Bet forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
! into negotiations for the permanent ac-
I quisition by the City and County, by
; original construction, condemnation or
j purchase of such or any of said
! public utilities as they may regard
! most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
! and submit to the electors of the City
; and County, at a special election, prop
! ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof..
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing 1 util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
! hereinafter provided, a proposition for
I the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate-
I ly take such steps or to enter i-nto such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
! osition shall be so formulated and com
i pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
c%se the votes cast in favor of both.propositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
I Nothing hi this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same asÂ»
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
...â¢.-, quire the same in the manner herein
â  alter provided.' â¢ |
Sec. 4. In- case the cost of any public i
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the city
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of- the electors voting there- <
â¢ on at any special election. In submit- I
ting propositions .to the electors for I
. such acquisition the Supervisors shall
=â¢ specify -in such' proposition the cost of
â  the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, a.nd
submit- to the electors the question
Â° whether the same shall be acquired
\ 'â  upon such terms.
In case,- however, the cost of such ;
â  ".! public- utility sought to be acquired
under- the provisions of this Article
shall so' far exceed the annual revenues <
' i of- the City and County, in addition to j
the other necessary expenditures there
â¢ of,- as to render it necessary to incur a
; " : municipal bonded indebtedness for such
â  :: purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub- ;
'â¢' milting propositions to the electors for
.' the acquisition thereof, shall specify j
â  therein the amount of the proposed 1
' bonded .indebtedness, the rate of inter
â  est thereon, and whether such bonded
â¢ ' indebtedness shall .be incurred. At j
Â° least two-thirds of the electors voting;
thereon at such election shall be neees- |
.sary to secure such acquisition and to
""warrant the issuance of municipal
"' bonds" therefor, as hereinafter set forth. I
Â° . Sec. 5. .When the electors by vote I
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
".' set forth, to acquire any public utility, I
I such action- on .the part of the electors \
:Â° shall "be equivalent to the passing of.
â¢ â¢ the ordinance by the Supervisors de- ;
blaring such determination as set forth
â¢ 'in .section six of this Article, and the j
: , Supervisors shall proceed without de- |
' lay to pass an ordinance calling a j
special election as. required by section j
seven of this Article. â¢ |
"â¢: Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
. termine that the public interest or ne- I
cessity demands the acquisition, con
.. st ruction or completion of any public
' utility, the cost of which will be too i
. great to be paid out of the ordinary an- j
' nual income and revenue of the City and ,
.County,, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de- j
â¢â¢ : termination, and shall publish the same j
for- at l.east two weeks in the official
newspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of j
, the ordinance 'declaring said deter- I
mination, as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four .
weeks after, the electors by vote shall
J have determined to acquire any public"
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
= shall call a special election, at which
â¢ shall'- be submitted" to the electors the j
â¢proposition- of acquiring such public |
â "utility, and of incurring a debt for the :
acquisition. of the same as set forth in :
such ordinance. No question other
. than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of ' the indebtedness
â¢ therefor shall be submitted at such 'â 
Â election.
Sec. S. The ordinance calling such !
special 'election shall recite the objects
arid purposes for which the indebted- 1
â¢ness is proposed to be incurred, the es- |
timated cost of the proposed public
Utility, the necessity for the acquisition :
â  of the same, and that bonds of the City i
and County shall issue for the payment i
of the "cost of the same as in such or- '
dinance set forth (if the proposition be â 
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
â  a day on which such special election
shall, be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the manner of voting
â¢â¢ for or against Incurring such indebted
ness. Such election shall be held as
provided by law for holding elections

WHAT THE FRENCH WANT FROM US.
United States Consul Joseph U Brtttaln.
writing from Nantes, Frauee, to the State De
partment, says: "Apples, sliced and dried
without removing the seeds or skins, find a
good market. Many of them came from Cali
fornia and are sold at a profit. The Eastern
and Middle States could certainly ship such
truit by slvw freight %ia St. Nazaire at a good
advantage. Among the American productions
known here are Singer and Home sewing ma
chines, prtinea and apricots tram California,
Carolina rice and petroleum. The French
wiulsi, I think. wHungly buy more of
our products if they knew anything about
them. Several French dealers have called at
this consulate lately, seeking information as to
our prices and productions? '

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal

i barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
I by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres

! by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
! first appear on the Washington coast. When
i the pressure Is high in the interior and low
â¢ along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
'â  but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
, marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is- im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali- i
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The

NEW ' YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEeW YORK, AÂ«"-il I.â The process which
went on In : the stock market to-day was a
crumbling and. disintegration of prices. There
was a ' large and . Influential party in the ex-"
change '. who manifested their confidence ", In â¢ a
peaceful settlement between the United States
and Spain and who increased values of securi
ties by determined support of prices all through
the early dealings. ; The buying by this ele
ment during the morning hours was very largÂ».
but prices r kept slipping downward. ;; The
weight of , the : growing ; depression proved too
heavy to â  carry and i the â¢ attempt \ was aban
doned In the â  afternoon ; ; when - a general and
heavy liauidatioa was la full force.* Some fee-;
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 2, 1898.
! ble rallies at the close indicated that some
part of the day 1 decline was due to short I
selling, but the. recoveries from . the lowest
were very small and net losses on the day run
from 2 to over 5 points In' the active stocks.' i
The ground for the early confidence by some
operators that war would be averted was
shrouded in toms mystery. It seems to have ;
been founded on the Inference that Interest on :
the Spanish 4s, which was pnld to-day, in |
spite of recent doubts whether the money <
would be forthcoming, -was advanced by the '
Rothschilds, and that the " advance was based !
; on knowledge that the Spanish . Government .
would make a peaceable settlement of the de- I
mands of the United States. Hut is th* day j
advanced the fact took more and more definite }
shape on the news from "Washington that the I
Spanish Government had, on the contrary, re- j
fused the demands of the United States. The 1
consequences seemed necessarily to be that
the whole question would be submitted to Can- i
gress for settlement. This was felt to Invcnve j
the abandonment â of diplomacy and an early
resort to force. All the indications usually re- |
garded as trustworthy as 'to political develop- i
ments were very contradictory in the early i
trading. American securities after opening oft j
In London Improved before the opening hour [
and advanced quite violently after trading had ;
commenced In New York. - This early weak
ness was in spite of the fact that early advices :
from Madrid were rather optimistic, Span- â 
ish 4p, which were traded In ex-coupon, fell 3 â 
points. ln London before the rally set in. then
recovered IV. apparently on the early strength ,
shown by the New York stock market. This !
early strength here rallied prices several times i
to or near last night's level and it was not j
until the afternoon that the market took on '
! Its decisive tone' of weakness. A significant
feature of the day was the marking up .of
call loans to 6 per cent. 'â  This was due to the j
calling of a moderate amount of loans by the ;
New York banks. But the â  shifting of these I
loans developed a small amount of money of- .
fering and the sharp stiffening In rates was I
the consequence.
Exchange rates responded to the hardening
of money by a fractional decline, though the
; day's engagement of gold for Import was only ,
about $300,000. The growth of the selling for i
I Washington account, â  ac the day progresses,
' was an essential factor In the late break ' in
the stock market.
Bonds were not so active as stocks, but the '
I volume of liquidation Increased as the day j
progressed and some sharp net â¢ losses are i
shown. Total sales, $1,650.000.. Government
I bonds were weak throughout. The new 4s j
; coupon fell 2^. do registered 2. the old 4s reg- ;
, istered and the 5s *4 In the bid price. There ;
were sales of the new 4s coupon at 121 H. a i
j decline of 1H from last night' bid price. â¢. >

LONDON MARKET. -
NEW YORK, April Iâ The Evening Poet's
1 London financial cablegram says: The stock j
markets were feverish to-day, pending develop- j
ment of the American-Spanish controversy.
Having Interviewed leading men and other
financial houses here, I find that the consensus
: of opinion favors an am!cab!Â» settlement. Â« The
belief here Is that President â  McKlnley so !
framed the dispatch 'to Spain so that, while |
thoroughly preserving American dignity, Span- i
ish pride was fully considered. Weak bulls of 'â 
Americans, however, were unable to stand the \
tension on their nerves and flung away stocks
' Indiscriminately. This movement was assisted
i by a sharp fall In Spanish 4s to 49,- although
yesterday . they closed at 30\i. This drop must
not be connected solely with the strained rela
, tions with the United States, but as a result of
, the forced sales from Paris alluded to in these
â  dispatches yesterday, and which have now
probably ceased. Northern Pacific was excep
'â  tionally bought by Germany. The other mv
. kets were dull and featureless, except Brazils,
i which were flat.. The Paris Bourse was dull
j during the period of . settlement.

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET.
| CHICAGO, April L- Wheat opened firm at
! prices " unchanged ." to . . %c \ higher . than " yester
i day's closing figures and In the course of . the
â  first hour's trading made a further advance of
; nearly *4c' During this time " the volume of
: business was considerably heavier - than of late.
The strength was principally due to the state
i ment of Joseph Letter that he had disposed of
I 2,500,000 bushels of. cash wheat Monday last for
i export. This Indication of an urgent demand
for wheat from abroad tended to make shorts
1 uneasy. In addition to that, however, the New
I York stock market had recovered â an . opening
! decline â¢ before trading commenced . here. An
â¢ other bull help was the big falling off in Ar
: gentine shipments since last week. Liverpool
! was up %9%& at the opening. Under a good
demand from shorts and some Investment buy-
I ing. July,; which had opened at 82VigS2Hc, ad
; vanced to S2%c. There it I met realizing sales
I and a slow decline ensued, the price finally
; getting back to S2^c, around which figure It
hung for some time. After the noon hour the
! market began, to show - the effect of the . dis
: turbing nature of the news . from Washington,
! and the weakening -of stocks â  and selling,
1 which had been light and scattered up to that
! time, increased In volume, many of the early
1 buyers putting their lines on the market again.
, The liquidation, however, only resulted in
! knocking down the price to S2S4gS2%c. About
j this time talk of further heavy cash sales
i were circulated on " the floor. .â  .. Besides* the
| heavy sales reported early Leiter had accept
â¢ ances of 150,000 bushels offered by cable yester
i day afternoon, 100,000 for New York andlW.
â¢ M for domestic milling. Other sales of 200,
| 000 bushels were reported for export. The re
i markably heavy cash sales caused selling to
' stop very suddenly late In : the session and
; drove a good many shorts to cover. The mar
; ket was decidedly strong toward the close, even
: May. up to that time almost at a standstill.
! sharing .in the firmness. July rallied to 83c
i and closed at S2%@s3c. May ranged from $1 04
! to $1 03>4 and closed at $1 03%.. .
i Cora was very slow and barely steady at
I about yesterday's figures. May closed un-
I changed.
i Oats were quiet, selling being principally in
i the way of realizing. May closed %c higher.
I Provisions early were very strong. At the
i opening, however, short selling and realizing
was too heavy for the market to stand up un
! der and prices gradually declined. The mar
j ket closed rather easy at Inside figures. May
j pork closed 7V;C lower. May lard 2%c lower and
I May ribs 5c lower.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. April I.â Bradstreet' s to-mor-
I row will say: A week of rather quieter tra^e
: and smaller distribution, due to easily expl=
; able causes, closes a quarter which has bt
' eminently satisfactory to nearly all branches
â  of trade and productive of an unprecedented
; business in many favored lines. The heavy for
! eign demand for our products, particularly
: agricultural staples and the active domestic
movement In most lines, are evidenced by the '
heavily Increased bank clearings reported for !
the quarter and the effect on the commercial
mortality is favorably reflected in a total, for \
the first three months of IS9S. of failures and
of liabilities involved, smaller than in the cor- '
responding period for four years past. Cur
rent demand and the distribution at the East
have been interfered with by the uncertainties '
growing out of our unsettled foreign relations.
This has been particularly manifest in a most
pronounced indisposition on the part of buy
ers to anticipate future wants, and some can
cellations of orders for woolen goods are at
tributed directly to this cause. Evidence is
not lacking, however, that the stimulation to
the woolen goods industry growing out of tariff
changes last year is responsible In some meas- i
ure for the unreadiness of manufacturers to
go ahead as confidently now as they did a year
ago. Little or no Improvement is found in
the coarse cotton goods trade and prices for !
ci <ths have marked a new record in prices of i
2VÂ»c tor regular goods.
There is a rather more quiet condition as re- ;
gards new demand for iron and steel at most >
markets, and some shading In quotations Is
claimed, but the business doing Is on an im
mense scale. Good weather at the South fa- j
vors an early planting season, but business
based upcn this has not been of such a vol
mac as to make up for the quieting demand
noted at a number of coast cities and at ttrtx
points, where high water is limiting business
to some extent. Export trade at New* Or
leans Is reported checked by increased freight
insurance rates, growing out of the present
unsettled foreign situation. Freight rates are
reported weaker on the Pacific Coast and trade :
is rather quieter at most cities.
The outlook is for a very heavy crop of
wheat in the State of Washington this year.
Boat building and iron manufacturing are re
ported active in the Pacific Northwest. The
price situation is. on the whole, quite en- !
couraging this week; oats, flour, print cloths â 
and hides being the most nromtnent among :
the decreases mentioned, while wheat, corn, I
lard, coffee, cotton and sugar are higher and
the list of staples unchanged in price appears :
the most numerous.
Exports of wheat (flour Included) are smaller
than for gome weeks past, but are much larger
than In corresponding periods of previous i
years, aggregating 3.550,664 bushels, against
3 SSti.OOfl bushels last week; 2,464.645 bushels in;
this week of last ear; 1.693.927 bushels in 1596;
2.S. r ,3,533 bushels in 1595, and 2,T75,150 bushels in 'â 
1594.
Failure records, as above Intimated, bear ;
witness to th? satisfactory conditions ruling '
in commercial line* this year in a total for the
quarter of 3515 embarrassments, involving lia
bilities of $36. 198. 0<)0, a decrease In number
ffotn a year ago of 13 per cent and from two 'â 
': yeAn ago of 22 rer cent, while as regards lla
i bilttles there is a falling off from last year of :
i 30 per cent, and as compared with 1596 of over !
42 "*r cent.
Failures In the Dominion of Canada for the i
quarter of IS9B number 516, with liabilities of ;
i St.Me.flQo, a decrease of 24 per cent in number .
and 2U per cent in liabilities from one year
ago.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, April I.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
I Weekly Review of Trade will gay-^morrow:
In spite of foreign conditions since the de
, structlon of the Maine. February 13, failures
in three months are smaller than In the first
; quarter of any year since 1S86; the ratio of j
defaulted liabilities to payments through j
clearing houses has been the smallest for that
quarter since ttttj the average of liabilities per I
nrm In business has been the smallest since
1880, and the average of liabilities per failure
haa been lower than ever before In any quar
ter. It Is especially significant that the fail
ures for less than $100,000. without material
decrease in number, were 29 per cent smaller
than last year in manufacturing and 24 per
cent smaller in trading.
The war cloud, which many have inferred
must have greatly increased commercial dls- i
asters, does not appear to have any such effect
as yet. and while there is some decline in the '.
new orders for Industries, nearly all live works j
are covered so far ahead that the difference is
Dot felt. Rates for money have advanced and
tfeÂ« S per cent which used to be the ruling rate â¢
in active times again prevails, which compels j
many speculators to liquidate. But the Im
ports of gold go far to prevent any real
anxiety. Moreover, although part of the
hypothecated exchange on Europe has been j
sokl and ordered against It. there is known to I
be about f30,000,0<M more yet la the banks at .
Netr "Fork and $12,500,000 In other cities, aga .st
wblek gold is liable to be imported, because
there is small prospect of any better deposits.
The outgo of breadstuffs continues, Atlantic
exports being 2.516.220 bushels, flour Included,
for the week, against 2.158.373 last year, and
Pacific exports Â£42.147 bushels, against 135.207
bushels last year, and for the past five weeks
from both coasts the exports have been 16,552,
91. bushels, against $.2tK.256 bushels last year.
Meanwhile corn exports have been for tlie
week 3,767,'->N bushels, against 4.291.621 bush- ;
els last year. All the speculative movements
at the West have been less influential than this .'
heavy and continued buying of grain, and ;
Western receipt! begin to fall off as If sup
nltei were no longer unlimited. Wheat has
declined slightly, but corn has advance . ,-
Tor the week, and r>o one imagines that for
eign troubles can check the outgo. Cotton has
advanced He because of the idea that thÂ« pro
duction may be reduced, although re.-elpt3
from plantations thus far have been greater by !
800, 000 bales than in 1*95 from the largest crop i
ever raised, ar.d while the mill? are now all j
active the consumrtion does not exceed the â¢
maximum. The smallest sales of wool for !
many years are reported at Boeton, and at the
three chief markets sales have been only 1.466.
500 pounds for the week and about a fifth of
last year's for the quarter. The stocks held
by manufacturers have evidently been much
greater than anybody supposed, and they are
not yet buying, after several months of wait
ing, nor showing any disposition to buy, though
nearly all their works are running full. The
Iron and steel market shows no decrease, for,
with works fully employed, and some addi
tional works put Into operation for Govern
ment purposes, pig Is not lower anywhere, and
at Plttsburg a shade higher for Bessemer, be- i
cause of an agreement by valley producers,
while without agreement of Mesaba mines
Urn purchases of ore at Cleveland were
over a million tons for the week.
Billets are still scarce and sheet bars in de T
Dtaad, though wire mds are .<~trer and wire
nails are weaker In spite of the Imperfect com
bination of makers. Other prices for manu
factured products are unchanged, although â 
rails are a shade stronger, with a Russian
order pending for Â£.000 tons to complete the
Pacific Railway; plates are in very heavy de
mand. MM for cars and 4000 for other use at
Plttsburg, with 10.000 more originating at
Chicago, and structural orders cover 4200 tons
for buildings at the East with 1000 more at
Pittsburg and many at Chicago.
Failures for the week have been 220 in the
t nited States against 2W last year, and In
Canada 27, against 42 last ytrar.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been the following deliveries of
coal, viz.: Four from Washington, 10.655 tons;
2 from Oregon. 1015 tons; 3 from British Co
lumbia. 10,625 tons: total. 22,356 tons. Although
the arrivals are light, still there is .no appar
ent shortage; in fact, there is an accumula
tion of domestic . coals, as some of. the yards
will show. . This . Is partially attributable to
the advanced prices and partially to a cessation
of frosts and rain, which necessarily â¢ dlmin- 4
ishes house consumption to a very appreciable
extent. Although several of our coal carriers
have already been transferred to the Alaska
trade the steamers make good the deficiency,
hence for the next two months at least sup
plies will be bountiful enough. July to Oc
tober our stocks will become more depleted for
want of tonnage; but not for a sufficient time
to affect values.
"Australia will become a potent factor In
establishing prices later on. ' There are now 63
charters of coal vessels already reported from â¢
Newcastle and Sydney, . with a carrying ca
pacity of about . 156.000 - tons. This Is a liberal
list of engagements, considering our -present
outlook, to furnish these vessels outward car
goes of grain on their arrival here. There .was
a delivery of 1250 tons of Comoi coke this
week. With recent improvements in their ovens
their products now show a marked improve
ment over last year."

THE SAIST FBANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 2, 1898.
FEARFUL OF
COMPETITION
Injunction Prayed For by
German Savings and
Loan Society.
To Prevent Others From Reap
ing Any of Its Golden
Harvest.
Suit That Is Attracting the Atten
tion of tho City's Business
Men.
A matter Is soon to come up in Depart
ment 4 of the Superior Court which is at
tracting considerable interest among
business men of this city. It is the. hear
ing of the petition for an injunction made
by the German Savings and Loan Society
against a number of local capitalists,
praying that they be restrained from giv
ing the name "German American Bank"
to the new banking concern, they have
organized.
The Interest comes from the novelty of
the petition, as It Is the first time In the
history of the city that an Institution of
any standing has attempted to restrain an
other from doing husiness on the grounds
that a slight similarity In names would
work an irreparable injury to the older
establishment.
The new organization has existed for
about five years in San Luis Obispo,
where it did a large business under the
name of the California Mortgage and
Savings Bank. Some time ago, at a
meeting of the directors, it was decided
to enlarge the scope of the concern and
make a bid for a fair share of San Fran
cisco business. Consequently the orig
inal capital stock of $500,000 was increased
to $1,000,000 and tne paid-up capital was
increased from $200,000 to $250,000, in order
to comply with the banking laws of the
State, and a charter was applied for to
enable the new company to carry on a
savings and general mercantile banking
business under the name of "The German
American Bank." As soon as the man
agement of the German Savings and
Loan Society heard of the application it
consulted with Mr. Goodfellow, the
bank's attorney with the result that
each of the direcrors of the new company
was served with a copy of an Injunction
restraining them from doing business un
der the firm name they had decided to
adopt, though, for some reason known
only to themselves, the Injunction was
pigeonholed, not being placed on the rec
ords at the County Clerk's office until
yesterday.
The hearing of the petition was orig
inally set for yesterday, but was put over
by mutual agreement until next week.
It is not thought that the injunction
will stick, as the names are not only not
identical but are no more similar than
the names of half a dozen other banking
houses in the city â for instance, the Bank
of California. California Title and Trust
Company, and Anglo-Californian Bank,
while in New York and other Eastern
cities there are from six to a dozen in
stitutions doing business under exactly
like conditions.
The directors of the new banking house
are among the wealthiest and most in
fluential Germans in the city, as follows:
Ernst A. Denicke (president), H. Brun
ner (secretary), F. Kronenberg, Fred C.
Siebe, John C. Bauer, A. Togazzini, A.
Sbarboro and John C. Rued.
WINGED INSECTS
IN THE PARK
Patches of Buhach May Be
Cultivated to Abate a
Nuisance.
Experiment Suggested by
tions Made at the Peters
Buhach Farm.
The winged ants, gnats, mosquitoes and
other kindred insects are a great nui
sance in certain sections of Golden Gate
Park. They not only pester human be
ings, but they attack horses with a per
sistent ferocity that sets the animals al
most wild. The place from which these
vexatious insects come cannot be traced
by the flight of the intruders, but it is
surmised that the breeding grounds are
in or near the park. The main question
presented Is how to get rid of the vicious
and annoying little insects.
A. B. Spreckels, who frequently drives
to the park, suggests that experiments
should be made in planting patches of
buhach. The so-called Persian powder
manufactured from the juhach blossom
is extensively used as an Insect exter
minator. Some years ago, when Mr.
Spreckels was down at Merced buying
mules, he observed a place where the
leaves had been stripped from the gar
dens and orchards. When he inquired
about the ravages, the keeper of the
ranch said: "I suppose the grasshoppers
and Insects just eat up everything." Go
ing a little further along Mr. Spreckels
came to a farm where the foliage was
fresh and green, the gardens were fra
grant with flowers. Everything was in
such happy contrast to the desolated
ranch first visited that the visitor paused
to inquire the reason for the fine natural
aspect of the farm. He was told that
the place was Peters' buhach ranch, and
that the Insects did not visit the prem
ises.
When driving through the park recently
and noting what a nuisance the insects
were, and how the high-bred horses were
vexed by the assaults of the winged ants
and mosquitoes, it came to Mr. Spreckels'
fancy that it would be a good thing to
try "the planting of buhach in patches
throughout the park. It was remarked
that Mr. McLaren could make the ex
periment without much trouble and ex
pense. The buhach blossom, which re
sembles the marguerite flcv3f, may px
pel the insects from the park reserva
tion.
MONEY FOB, THE CHARITIES.
Another Partial Distribution Under
the Will of the Late James
G. Fair.
Judge Slack yesterday made an order
directing the executors of the will of the
late James G. Fair to pay the bequests
made in the twelfth paragraph of the
will. Fair directed in his will that $50.
000 be distributed among the charitable
institution* enumerated below in the pro
portion to the number of inmates in each.
The accrued interest on the legacy
amounts to $7904 IK, and in accordance with
thr terms of the will, the order made yes
terday directs the following apportion,
ment of the money: San Francisco Nur
sery for Homeless Children. $8818 07: Ma
ria Kip Orphanage, $7707 3K; San Francisco
Protestant Orphan Asylum, $19,070 82: San
Francisco T,adies' Protective and Relief
Society. $21,541 14, and Florence Crittenton
Home. $2766 70.
Lieutenant Burkes Estate.
Mrs. Delia Burke, widow of Police Lieu
tenant William F. Burke, who was shot
and killed by Theodore Park Haynes, a
week ago Wednesday, filed a petition in
the Probate Court yesterday for special
letters Of administration on her hvsband's
estate. The estate consists of deposits
in two banks amounting vo $1988 46.
A Victory for Decency.
The appeal case of Charles Allais, who
was sentenced by Judge Campbell for
having knowingly rented houses to bÂ«
used tor Immoral purposes, was heard
yesterday by Superior Judges Wallace.
Cook and Dunne, sitting in bank. The
appeal was taken on the ground that
Judge Campbell had admitted testimony
that was incompetent. The appellate
Judges decided that there was no merit
in the appeal and sustained the judgment
of the lower court.
Allais was arrested at the time the suc
cessful crusade was made to close the
houses used for immoral purposes on St.
Mary's street.
QUICKER TIME WANTED.
The Mission People Do Not Relish
Mayor Phelan's New Schedule.
It would bo difficult to find any one re
siding in the Mission who thanks Mayor
Phelan for his interference in urging he
Market-street Railway Company to adopt
a new schedule of time on which the
streetcars are now run.
Six miles an hour in this age of the
world for streetcars Is considered to be
going back to the days of horsecar serv
ice. Heretofore the service on the iills
slon-street line was giving entire satis
faction to tho traveling public. By it
they were enabled to reach their places
of business in a few minutes from the
time they left their homes, whereas now,
under the new schedule suggested by the
Mayor, it takes from ten to twenty min
utes longer to cover the same distance.
This additional time to a workingman
who must be at -is bench on time or
forfeit a half-day's pay means a great
deal. The same can be said of the clerks
and the hundreds of young ladies who
do business In offices and at their trades
in the various branches where ladies are
employed.
In a recent interview with Mr. Vining,
superintendent of the Market-street sys
tom, that gentleman expressed his dis
satisfaction at the change of speed, al
leging that the object of the company
which he represented was to please his
patronsâ meaning the public, of course
that in obedience to the wish or, rather,
the request of the Mayor of the city, the
spfed of the cars had been reduced to
meet his wishes. The Mission people are
frank in denouncing this action of the
Mayor as being outside his official duties.
It is urged that there is a law governing
the speed of streetcars in cities, and It is
for the courts and the police authorities
to see to the enforcement of this law, and
not for the Mayor.
The people require a return to the eight
mile schedule, and are hopeful that their
wishes may be graUned.
GAS ENGINES
FOR RANCHES
With Their Aid Farmers Fear
Nothing From the
Drought.
Nearly All Big Ranch-Owners Are
Putting in Pumping Plants for
Irrigating.
Nearly every uig ranch in the State has
suffered more or less for the want of
water. The rainfall has been away below
the average, and many a farmer has been
put to straits in order to save even a part
of his crop. Quite a number of the larger
ranch-owners have lost their faith in the
clouds, and are now pinning It to gaso
line. Gas engines are being erected
in all parts of the State, and when they
are In thorough working order the farmer
will be in a position to snap his fingers at
a dry season.
Among those who have transferred their
allegiance to gasoline Is Henry Dutard of
Santa Clara County. A 60-horsepower
engine is now being built for his
ranch, and wnen completed it will be one
of the very few o. its kind in the United
States. It win run a centrifugal pump
that is eighty-seven feet below the sur
face of the ground.
A 20-horsepower engine is already at
work on the Armstrong ranch, and a
duplicate Is now being put in position.
They will pump the water from the Sa
linas River, and when in full operation
will be able to deliver Into the reservoir
200,000 gallons an hour. The original
pump 1b now supplying Mr. Armstrong's
own ranch, and the new one is to work
a 10-inch centrifugal pump to supply his
neighbors.
The E. W. Krupp ranch, near Mountain
View, Is getting a 30-horsepower engine,
and, like the others it will rum- water
for irrigating purposes.
J. O. McKee of San Jose is having an
engine erected on his ranch that will
pump 350 gallons of water a minute. It
will be used in irrigating his orchard.
Walter S. Hobart is having a 20-horse
power engine put up at his ranch
at San Mateo, and E. W. Hopkins a sim
ilar one at Menlo Park. When completed
Mr. Hobart's engine will be able to pump
10,000 gallons of wa.er an hour into a
reservoir 200 feet high.
Other engines to be used in supplying
water for irrigating purposes are "-oing to
Los Angeles, Tehama, Santa Clara, Sac
ramento, San Joaquin and Contra Costa.
"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good."
BRANDT WANTS
BIG DAMAGES
Claims That He Was Thrown
Out of His Seat by a
Collision.
The Conductor Contradicts His State
ment and Swears Trlat There
Was No Collision.
The taking of testimony In the case of
Ernest Brandt against the Southern Pa
cific Company was concluded yesterday
in the United States Circuit Court, and
the counsel will present their arguments
to the jury on Tuesday.
Brandt is seeking to recover $50,000 for
a dislocated shoulder, which injury he
swore he received on the night of March
30, 1897, by being thrown from hia seat
in a railway car by a sudden jar while on
the way from Truckee to Sacramento.
He has another suit on file for another
$50,000 for damages caused by the death
of his wife, which he claims was brought
about by injuries received on the same
occasion.
The defense was that there was no
collision, rough coupling or other thing
on the night mentioned to cause any pas
senger to fall from his seat, and that the
injury received by Brandt was due to
his own carelessness in falling asleep in
his seat in an Insecure attitude.
The testimony was very conflicting. F.
F. Chase, the train conductor, swore that
there was no accident on the night In
question and that there was no rough
coupling sufficient to cause the plaintiff
to fall from his seat. If there had been
any jar more than ordinary on that night
the glass lamp chimneys would have
been broken, but the contrary was the
fact, there being nothing whatever broken
or disarranged. On the cross-examina
tion the witness admitted that he had told
Yard naster Lewis on that day that a
man had fallen out of his seat, but that
he must have said it in a joke.
He testified further that Brandt did not
ask for a surgeon and did not tell him
that he had injured his arm.
Brandt flatly contradicted the testimony
and said that" he had reported to the con
ductor the fact of his injury. The shook
of the sudden stoppage spilled the water
out of the tank all over a Chinaman sit
ting near it. but it did not upset the tank.
The witness was asleep at the time of the
shock and was awakened by being thrown
violently out of his seat. He swore also
that he asked Conductor Chase for a doc
tor and that Chase had replied that a
dislocated shoulder was nothing; that he.
Chase, had his nose broken once, but did
not send for a doctor.
Is Now a Policeman.
Henry N. Potter wa*s yesterday sworn
In as a policeman. He Is a clerk by oc
cupation, 29 years of age and a native
oi Bangor, Butts County,
HOT RECEPTION
FOR SCHAEFER
Mistake of Waking Up a
Bartender While
Asleep.
Three Shots Fired but Without
Inflicting Serious
Injury.
Thomas Tregllles, an ex-Minstrel,
Arrested for Assault to Com
mit Murder.
Frank Schaefer. a painter in the em
ploy ment of Beghul & Son, 2130 Market
street, was nearly made a subject for the
Coroner yesterday morning.
Shortly after 7 o'clock he entered a
saloon on the corner of Market and
Valencia streets to get a glass of beer.
The bartender was asleep in a chair, and
Schaefer shook him and roused him up.
As the bartender went behind the bar he
put his hand in his pocket and declared
that he been robbed. He accused Schaefer
of robbing him, which Schaefer indig
nantly denied.
Schaefer left the saloon and went to the
shop where he is employed. The bar
tender followed him and again accused
him of robbing him. They had some
words, and then they grappled with each
other. The bartender pulled a revolver
out of his pocket and, before any one
could interfere, he fired three shots at
Schaefer. One of the bullets struck him
on the neck, another on the left thumb,
and the third shot away a button on his
coat.
The two men were separated and the
bartender left the shop, while Schaefer
hastened to the Receiving Hospital,
where it was found that the wounds on
his neck and thumb were not serious. He
said that he did not know the name of
the bartender, but he would swear out a
warrant for his arrest.
Schaefer notified the SeventQenth-street
Police Station and the bartender was ar
rested yesterday afternoon on a charge
of assault to commit murder. He is
Thomas Tregijles, who is well known as
an ex-minstrel and who was a member
of Billy Emerson's company, which in
cluded among others Gus Bruno, Pete
Mack and Charley Reed.
Tregilles sticks to the story that he was
robbed while asleep and believes tnat
Schaefer was the man who robbed him.
In the circumstances he considers he was
perfectly justified in using his revolver
upon the man he suspected. Schaefer de
nies emphatically that he robbed Tregil
les, his only object in going into the sa
loon being to get a glass of beer before
starting work. He lives at 2016 Market
street, not far from the saloon.
HOFF MAY SOON
KNOW HIS FATE
Attorney Schooler Made the
Closing Argument for the
Defense.
Criticised the Police, Detecti-vea an
the Language of Attorney George
W. Baker.
Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock the
arguments in the Hoff case were resumed
before Judge Cook and jury. Attorney
Schooler had an inning, and at some
length entered into all the details of the
case. The attorney, in his argument, en
deavored to enter into points concerning
the innocence of the defendant, but an
objection by Assistant District Attorney
Hosmer was sustained by Judge Cook on
the point that the matters touched on
were not contained in the records.
Then in well-worded expressions the
speaker threw numerous bouquets at the
Judge and thanked all interested parties
for the fair and impartial trial accorded
his client, Albert Hoff.
Throughout the argument the attorney
attacked the testimony of various wit
nesses, not that he doubted their sin
cerity, but from the standpoint that he
believed Mrs. Uschold and others were
mistaken as to the date and that the
incidents testified to had taken place on
the 14th day of December instead of on
the 15th, the day of the murder. In bit
ter expressions he told the Jury that his
client was placed at a disadvantage be
cause of prosecuting attorneys and ear
nest sleuth hounds, with a determination
to bag some victim because of an inabil
ity to catch a guilty party. He also criti
icized the language of Attorney Baker on
the previous day, and stated that the
prosecution had been totally unable to
prove a motive for the murder. As the
testimony of the witnesses was picked to
pieces Hoff frequently smiled and seemed
to be more composed than at any time
during the trial.
Continuing, Mr. Schooler said that Mrs.
Clute had not been murdered by the de
fendant, and furthermore that Mrs. Clute
was not killed with the coupling pin nor
had Hoff seen it prior to the time it was
shown him ~y Detective Seymour.
The attorney then spoke of the wound
which Hoff had on his left hand, and
stated that it was impossible for the in-
Jury to have been made by the coupling
pin, but that it was received from a tack
in the carpet which the defendant was
preparing to lay.
The attorney relied on the lack of mo
tive and the time the murder was com
mitted to prove an alibi to strengthen his
argument.
This morning at 10 o'clock Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Hosmer will give the clos
ing argument for the prosecution, and it
is expected the jury will be charged dur
ing the afternoon.
The argument was resumed at a night
session.

ETHEL. For more than ten years I Buffered severely from dyspepsia,' and dur-
ing that time consulted many physicians. First it was the family
doctor in New York, where I then resided, and later I had treat-
â¢ ment at the New York Hospital, but obtained no permanent relief.
For over a month I had visited my family physician in Bayonne,
twice in every week, and as a last resort an appointment had been
made when I was to^ibmit to the process of having the stomach
washed out by the siphon arrangement, which is found a mode of
treatment more beneficial in its effects than enjoyable in the pro-
cess. About this time, however, I had a conversation with a
friend who w?t acquainted with the merits of Ripans Tabules, and
be presented me with a box for trial. Well, . I did try them, and
could feel that they did me good, so I bought more, and in my
house nowadays you will always find a supply of Ripans Tabules. 3
I find them easier to take than powders or liquids, or- even than
Bwallowing hot water in the morning. My condition is so much
improved that of late I have had no occasion to resort to them
at all. Before I found the Tabules, my bill for attendance and
medicine was rarely less than three dollars a week. The Tabules
, have not only improved my condition, but have, been efficacious
in the case of friends to whom I have recommended, them. c
