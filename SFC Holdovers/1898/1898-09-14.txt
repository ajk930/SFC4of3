A TENNESSEE
SOLDIER DOES
WILLFUL MURDER
W. Rosser's Unpro-!
yoked and Delib
erate Crime.
H. Hilderbrand the Victim
of His Vicious Desire
for Blood.
Police Fear a Riot and Call Out
Out All the Available
Patrolmen.
Welter Rosser, a member of the First
Tennessee Regiment, shot and instantly
killed henry Hilderbrand, an employe of
A. W. Fink & Co., in the Spreokels Mar
ket yesterday afternoon shortly before 6
o'clock.
Rosser is steward of the field hospital
corps of the Tennessee Regiment. He Is
a graduate of the Vanderbilt Medical Col
lege of Nashville and his father is said
to be superintendent of the Nashville,
Chattanooga and Tennessee Railway. He
enlisted in Memphis. He is only 21 years
of age, but his army record is extremely
bud. During almost the entire, time his
resriment hn.s been in camn in this city he
has occupied the guardhouse/ In fact he
escaped from the military prison through
the connivance of some friends who were
on guard duty at the time and went
downtown. He stole a bottle of liquor be
fore he left the camp, and. his vicious na
ture, excited by the stolen whisky,
brought him to commit his deed of
murder.
Hlft victim. Henry Hilderbrand, resided
at 812 Turk streei. He was 27 years of
age and a most exemplary man. He was
married only a short time ago, and he
was the main support of his fathf-r and
mother and several brothers and sisters.
His employers speak of him In the high
est terms.
He had a pleasant little home, but last
night it was a place of desolation and de
spair.
The Tennessee Regiment received three
months' pay yeeterday. It was the first
money the mon of that regiment had re
The San Francisco Call
ceived since their arrival on the coast,
and many of the men had been given lib
erty from the camn. Neany all of those
who were outsiue the line of guards were
more or less under the influence of liquor,
and with each drink the soldiers took the
more quarrelsome they became. The
Tennessee soldiers had frequently made
threats that when they pot money they
would tear the city to pieces. During; the
day the police saw several of Tennessee's
volunteers purchasing pistols, and a
sharp watch was kept on many of them.
Then word reacned police headquarters
that the bad blood that in the past few
weeks had been engendered between the
soldiers from Tennessee and from Wash
ington had culminated in a challenge to
fight a pitched battle some time during
last night and that the challenge had
been accepted.
As soon as word of the murder reached
the office of the v. uief of Police a call
was sent to all the outside police districts
to sond all the officers that could bf* pos
sibly spared from the regular beats to
the tenderloin districts, where the soldiers
were collecting and creating incipient dis
turbances. A call was also sent out to
all the special officers to report at the
contral station, to be in readiness for
riot duty.
While these extra police officers were
being collected a request was sent to the
commandant of the camp at the Praaidlo
to send out provost guards and gather In
all the soldiers who were outside ihe
camp lines with all possible speed.
An hour later squads of soldiers with
loaded rifles and glistening bayonets were
patrolling the streets in charge of com
missioned officers, hunting for the sol
diers who were the cause of so much anx
iety to the peace-loving citizens.
There were many witnesses to the
murder, and they all unhesitatingly say
it was a most deliberate, cold-blooded
i crime and committed without the least
1 provocation. Rosser entered the Market
; building from the Market-street side and
i stopped for a moment at the fruit-stand
Just inside the door. C. M. Foster, the
groprletor of the stand, said Rosser
ought some trifles and while they were
being wrapped up he helped himself to
what small fruits were within his reach.
When his purchases were wrapped and
ready for him he asked that the bundle
be laid aside for a few moments, as he
I would be back for them. He then passed
on down the market.
Rosser next made himself conspicuous
when about half way down the market
building toward Stevenson street. John
|Wuthrlch, cashier for Hammond & Broa,
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1898.
said he saw the soldier coming along the
aisle threateningly flourishing a pistol In
his right hand. He pointed the weapon at
a colored man who was behind the coun
ter of Hammond & Brod's stall, but the
colored man quietly backed away and
avoided the enmity of the Tennesseean.
The soldier then turned and leveled the
wapon at the head of the proprietor of a
fish stall. The soldier stood for a moment
toying with the trigger, while those in the
neighborhood scurried for shelter.
Rower grinned in diabolical glee at the
sensation he was making with his gun,
and he moved on down the market yelling
"What is the matter with Tennessee?"
On the counter of A. W. Fink & Co.'s
stall were a number of meat pies, and
spread around them in a most tempting
manner were a number of dairy delica
cies. When opposite that counter the
soldier lowered his weapon and walking
over to Hlldcrbrand, who was In charge
of the stall, demanded to be waited on.
"What would you like?" asked the
young attendant In a pleasing manner.
For a reply Rosser raised his weapon and
pent a bullet into the heart of the young
man behind the counter.
William Walsh, a boy living at 816 Vi
Dolores street, and employed by Ham
mond & Brod, was standing beside Hll
derbrand when the fatal shot was fired.
and when the murdered man fell Rosser
turned the weapon on the lad and fired a
shot at him, but the bullet juat missed
his head.
"What's the matter with Tennessee?"
ho yelled after he had fired the second
shot and moved toward the Stevenson
street doorway of the Market. He took
about a dozen steps in a most deliberate
manner, then he bolted out into the
street and sped toward Third street In
an effort to escape.
Nelse Johnson, a waiter employed in the
cafe close to the Stevenson street door
way, and who was a witness to the crime
followed the murderer out into the street'
and ran after ljim yelling "Murder!" and
shouting for the police.
Policemen McNamara and Janes were
on Third street, and they heard the wait
er's cries aa he sped after the fleeing mur
derer.
Just as Rosser reached Third street he
stopped, and, turning, leveled his pistol
at Johnson. The waiter suddenly stopped
pursuing the soldier and rolled back, fall
ing prostrate in the middle of the road
way, to give, as he said a smaller target
for the fusillade of bullets he expected
would be sent his way. Before Rosser had
time to discharge his weapon the two po
licemen were upon him and he was dis
armed. The murderer fought against ar
rest, but when the policemen demonstrat
ed their superior physical power and the
handcuffs were pinched on his wrists he.
surrendered.
He was taken back to the scene of his
crime. The body of hisvictlm lay on the
floor in the passageway to the stall the
murdered man tended. Dr. J. Gooiwln
was examining the body when the mur
derer was pushed through the crowd to
the scene of his crime.
"The man is dead," remarked the phy
sician.
The words were heard by the murderer,
but he scornfully turned up his lips and
nudged the body with the toe of nis shoe.
He then turned away and apparently
tried to give the impression that the
enormity of committing a cold-blooded
murder was a matter of little concern to
a Tennesseean.
The prisoner was crowded behind the
counter of the stall to wait for the ar
rival of the patrol wagon.
A crowd quickly gathered and filled the
market building, and when the facts of
the crime became known to the increasing
mass the cry of "Lynch him!" was taken
up. and every moment the excitement and
the wrath against the murderer Increased.
The prompt arrival of a squad- of police
men, however, prevented any overt act
on the part of the crowd, though feeling
against the soldier ran high.
.In the excitement and confusion of the
threatening crowd the prisoner slipped
one of his hands through the steel cuff
and made an effort to escape. Policeman
Janes, however, grappled with his prison
er and threw him heavily to the floor. The
cuff was replaced and the second time it
was set tightly and no risk taken of its
removal. A squad of police cleared the
market and not long afterward the patrol
wagon arrived and the prisoner was tak
en to a cell at the City Prison.
The body of the murdered man was
taken to the Morgue.
CLAIMS IT WAS LIKE
A HORRID DREAM
Kosser Makes a Statement in His
Cell in Which He Says He
Doesn't Realize the Crime.
When young Kosser enttred the City
Prison an hour after the shooting he was
still stupid with drink. Some realization
of what he l.ad done evidently came to
him, as he burst into tears. Through his
tears heygave the acting uesk sergeant his
name, Walter Rosser, his age at 20, al
though he Is t\, and the name of his regi
ment. When the arresting officers irled to
search him he voluntarily handed 564 75
and a lady's gold watch and chain to Offi
cer Knight, and tearfully begged him to
care for the valuables.
A Budden realization of his position
came to him when the iron door of his cell
clanged behind him. His tears flowed
anew, and he buried his face In his hands
and tried to blot out his surroundings.
A young lawyer named Curtis visited
the prisoner shortly after he was booked,
and for him telegraphed the boy's father
about the trouble, asking him to come to
his son's aid.
The prisoner's boyish and refined ap
pearance won him some sympathy. Ills
recollection of the shooting he claims is
entirely blank. He claims to have been
In a dream and begged his Interviewtrs
to narrate the occurrence.
"I am greatly humiliated," lie said. "I
will never go home again. I know [ am
in deep disgrace anil feel It keenly. I'
don't remember a thing about to-nighfs
affair, but I would like to know the
names of the men who were with me.
"Are the negroes uprising? Is there
much feeling against me? There should
be none against my regiment, because
every precaution has been taken to krop
the men within bounds. 1 come of an ex
cellent family, and feel keenly for th-un.
My father and mother are alive," he
said, "and are living in Stevenson, Ala.

"I am a member of the Sigma Nu Fra
ternity -and a graduate of the Vanderbllt
University, and am entitled to the degree
of M. D. When the war broke out I was
a student In classics, but left school and
enlisted, in the Tennessee regiment at
Memphis. My knowledge of medicine
gained me the position of steward of Com
pany B, which position I still hold.
"I have telegraphed my father and ex
pect him to come to this city at once."
Later in the evening Judge J. H. Guerry
of Georgia, who has lately come to thji
State to practice law, called on the pris
oner and tendered his services as a friend
of the family, and he was accepted. He
will appear !n court to-morrow when
Rosser Is arraigned.
STORIES OF THOSE WHO
WITNESSED THE CRIME
All Agree That the Deed Was a
Cold-Blooded, Deliberate
Murder.
Sam Cosel, a butcher in the employ of
Hammond & Brod, whn have a stall op
posite the place of shooting, supported
the dying: man's head. Cosel said his at
tention was attracted by the soldier's
wild actions. He saw him with a pistol
in his hand but thought nothing of it un
til he heard the fatal shot. The soldier
then ran out. Cosel said Hilderbrand was
a quiet fellow and very popular. He was
in charge of the stand during the ab
sence of the proprietor, A. W. Fink.
W. M. Morris, manager for the Revere
Rubber Company, was dining with his
wife and child in the upper apartments of
the Spreckels Market Cafe when the shot
was fired. He said he heard no harsh
words. The soldier first fired at Hilder
brand and then pointed his pistol at a
boy who was near his victim and again
fired. The soldier then walked out and
started to run down the stairs and fell.
Nelse Johnson, a waiter in the cafe,
was standing near the door when the
first shot was fired. He said: "The sol
dier fired again and then ran down the
street, and I tried to catch him. Ho
turned and pointed his piÃtol threaten
ingly at me, and, thinking he was going
to shoot, 1 ducked out of the way."
Sam E. Hammond, one of the proprie
tors of the butcher stall directly opposite
the scene of the shooting, said: "After
the first shot I looked out of my office
and then saw the soldier deliberately flre
again."
Officer Charles M. James, who arrested
the murderer, made the following state
ment directly after the affair: "I was
walking slowly up Third street, near Ste
venson, when my attention was attracted
to a soldier who came running breath
lessly down Stevenson street with a pis
tol in his hand. I grabbed him and asK-;d
him what he was doing with the gun. He
replied that it was none of my business
Immediately a crowd began to collect
and shouts were raised of 'Lynch film!
He has murdered two men!' I arrested
him and walked him back up Steven3on
street to the Spreckels market, where I
turned him over to Officer McNamara
While I was turning him over to the oth
er officer the prisoner seemed greatly ex
cited and commenced shouting, 'Tennes
see boys, where are ..you?' "
Edward Varney. residing at 421 Kills
street, saw the tragedy. He said the sol
dier was standing in front of Fink's stall
for ten or perhaps fifteen minutes before
the shooting.
"He was eating a pie at the time," said
Varney, "and what attracted my atten
tion to him was that he heW a revolver
in his right hand. At one time some few
moments before he fired he placed the
weapon up to Mr. Hilderbrand's face. The
latter dodged behind the counter and the
soldier leaned over and shot him. I
could not hear what led up to the shoot
ing. There seemed to be no quarrel nor
angry words. Willie Walsh was standing
beside the soldier when he fired, and af
ter the shot ran toward me. The soldier
fired at him. The soldier then ran out on
to Stevenson street."
William Walsh, at whom the soldier
fired the second shot, works for Hammond
& Brod and lives at 816% Dolores street
His story of the shooting Is as follows: "i
had gone over to Mr. Hilderbrand to ask
him for a telephone number. He had
given it to me and I started away when
the soldier, whom I had noticed standing
in front of the stall eating a pork pie
grabbed me by the right arm, paying, â {
want to talk to you.' I told him that I
had my work to do and was too busy to
talk to him. He held me and said that I
had more time than he. Still holding me
by the arm hÂ© turned to Mr. Hilderbrand
-and asked him* 'Are you going to wait on
MISS FLOOD'S
GIFT TO THE
UNIVERSITY
A most munificent gift has been made to the University of
California by Miss Jennie Flood. It consist of the palatial Flood
mansion at Menlo Park, with the ornamental grounds, con
sisting of 540 ncres, together with a tract of land of about 1200
acres and four-fifths of the capital stock of the Bear Creek Water
Company. According to the estimate of John W. Mackay, who is
now in the city, and who was intimately associated for many years
in business with the father of the donor, this gift amounts in value
to over three million dollars. There is but one condition attached
to it, and that a very easy one â in fact, a condition that would in
all probability be carried cut without any request having been
made in regard to it. Miss Flood simply asks that the ornamental
grounds surrounding the mansion be kept in good order within a
reasonable area for a period of fifty years. The proceeds from the
gift are to be devoted to some branch of commercial education. It
is a singular and happy coincidence that the regents of the uni
versity recently established a commercial department in the insti
tution, and Miss Flood's generous endowment will enable them to
carry out their ideas on a most liberal scale.
The donation came as a surprise to all but a few of the re
gents, and, following the liberal gifts of Mrs. Hearst, whose for
tune, like that of the Flood estate, was derived from the develop
ment of mining Interests, will prove of vast benefit to the cause
of higher education in California. At the same time, it may in
fluence other rich people to devote a portion of their wealth for
educational purposes.
me?' Mr. Hllderbrand said, 'Certainly,
what ia it you wish?' or something like
that. The soldier then brought a revolver
up over the counter and Mr. Hllderbrand
dodged back of a case, but the soldier
reached around the case and shot him. As
soon as he fired I broke loose from him
and ran to the other side of the market.
He fired at me before I reached the coun
ter, behind which I hid myself. Some of
the men in the market say that the soldier
had the pistol in his hand all the time I
was standing there, and it may be so, but
to me he seemed to have his hand in his
hip pocket all of the time, and the first
time I saw It was when he pointed it at
Mr Hilderbrand, so I thought that he had
only taken it from his pocket at that mo
ment."

BACK TO CAMP
Provost Guards Search the Dives for
Fractious Volunteers and Place

On account of the murder and the con
sequent excitement a number of provost

tense excitement and accordingly ordered
all privileges revoked.
The guards attracted attention wherever
they went, and had some lively scuffles
with men who held passes and did not
care to be shuffled back to camp before
the passe 3 had expired. At the junction
of O'Farrell and Market streets one ol
the liveliest encounters of the evening
took place. Corporal R. M. Conly of the
Seventh found a friend partially under
the influence of liquor and undertook to
ccc him safely back to camp. He got
him aboard an O'Farrell street car, but
before the car started a provost guard
under Lieutenant Pilcher of the First
Tennessee appeared on the scene. The
guard demanded the surrender of the
man. Corporal Conly refused to give him
up, saying that he would take care of
his friend. By this time a crowd of curi

Martin Kellogg Tenders His
Resignation as President
of the University of
California.
In the calendar of the
University of California
Tuesday, September 13,
1898, will be reckoned as
an eventful day. On this
day Martin Kellogg, presi
dent of the institution, ten
dered his resignation, and
Cora Jane Flood gave to the
university property valued
at three million dollars.
The events of the day occurred during
the afternoon, session of the Board of
Regents. Shortly after 3 o'clock Timothy
Guy Phelps, who had presided during the
session up to that hour, vacated the chair
for Governor Budd, who thanked the re
gent from San Mateo County for his
kindness in presiding up to that time.
The assembled regents evidently expected
an Important announcement, for unusual
order was observed when the Governor
recognized Regent Arthur Rodgers. The
regent, holding in his hand two letters, re
marked that he desired to read the letters
to the board. He read as follows:
1010 CALIFORNIA ST.
To the Regents of the University of Cali
forniaâGentlemen: I hereby tender to you
the following property:
The Flood residence and tract of about five
hundred and forty acres near Menlo Park.
Cal. One-half interest in about twenty-four
hundred acres of marsh land adjacent to the
residence tract and four-firths of the capital
stock of the Bear Creek Water Company,
which supplies water to Menlo Park and vicin
ity.
The only conditions I desire to accompany
this gift are that the residence and reasonabla
area about It, including the present ornamental
grounds, shall be kept in g-ood oruer for the
period of fifty years and that the net Income
from the property and its proceeds shall txÂ»
devoted to some branch of commercial educa
tion. Yours very respectfully,
_ CORA JANE FLOOD.
San Francisco, September 13, 1898.
The second letter read was a privat*
request or the expression of a desire to
Mr. Rodgers by the lady that the resi
dence at Menlo Park should be painted no
other color than white.
The regents listened to the reading with
profound satisfaction. A motion was im
mediately made that the gift be accepted
and the thanks of the board be conveyed
to the donor.
Regent Foote asked seme questions con
cerning the formal acceptance, and Gov
ernor Budd replied that it would be nec
essary for the attorney of the board to
prepare a form of acceptance and for tne
regents to ratify the acceptance by tne
committee.
Regent Rodgers moved that a com
mittee be appointed to prepare the papers
for consummation of the gift. The motion
prevailed, and President Kellogg and Mr.
Rodgers were named to constitute the
committee. On motion, Governor Budd
was added to the committee. These gen
tlemen will accept the pift from the gen
erous lady and, on behalf of tne univers
ity and the State of California, express
gratitude for the donation. .
There was still another surprise in store
for the onlookers. If not for the regeiits
themselves. The secretary was instructed2
to read the following communication from
the president of the university:
PAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 13, IS9B.
To the Hoard of Regents of the University
of Californiaâ Gentlemen: In pursuance of an
Intention known already to many members of
tin- board, 1 hereby present my resignation of
the offioe "f praalmat of the university, to take
effivt March 23, 18S9, six years from my lu
diu-tixn into this office.
MARTIN KEI-LOOO.
Governor Budd was first to break the si
lence utter the secretary had read the let
tor of resignation. The Governor remarked
that the matter was of so much import
ance that a committee should be appoint
ed to whom the communication should be
referred. Thereupon Mr. Rodgers moved
that the l.tter be referred to a special
committee of three. The chair appointed
Regents Rodgers, Wallace and Black to
comprise the committee.
Earlier in the day the board appointed a
director of the Wilmerding School. A spe
cial committee, consisting of A. S. Halll
d!e. T. <:. Phelps, S. T. Black. Arthur
Rodgers and E. A. Denicke reported rec
ommending E. Schwartz as a suitable per
son to serve as director at a salary of $2500
per nnimni. The salary Is to begin when
the president orders Schwartz to go to
work. The resolution directs Schwartz to
proceed to New York and study the Auch
muty system as exemplified in the New
York Trn.le School, and then proceed to
Philadelphia and study the practice of the
Williamson School. Schwartz Is directed
to report for duty not later than Decem
ber, ! s :' v . The report of the special com
mittee was adopted. Subsequently Regent
James I). Phelan informed the board by
letter that the necessary street work at
the school site would be ordered by the
Board of Supervisors.
Lieutenant Hayne's leave of absence en
gaged the attention of the Regents for a
le length of time. It appears
that Borne Important work in the agricul
tural department of the university is in
contemplation, and the head professors
want some assistants to do the work.
This -is not surprising. In this
particular case Dr. Emil Meinecke. who 1p
now In Europe, is thought to be just the.
man to come over and help Hilgarde by
serving In Hayne's place. It was sur
niised that Meinecke would not serve for
a term shorter than one year, hence to

Jennie Fo od to fc b e State University of California.
make all things right for this period it
was sought to extend Lieutenant Hayne's
leave of absence. When Hayne went into
the army Judge Wallace proposed that
the fighting professor should have half
pay from the university during his ab
sence in the field. As Wallace remarked
yesterday. Hallidie, In a burst of magnifi
cent patriotism, proposed that Hayne
should have full salary during the war,
and it was allowed. Now comes the
question whether the war is over. Hani
die argues that it is, while Wallace holds
a contrary opinion, citing the recent call
of Admiral Dewey for reinforcements.
The matter was patched up by giving
Hayne a leave of absence until the war
closed or until he was mustered out of
the service. I Meanwhile Meinecke will
come over and help Hilgarde. Meinecke
is nn expert on dairy work, having, ac
cording to the letters sent here to boom
him. given .special study to dairy products
in Denmark. This intelligence was re
ceived with especial delight by Regent
John E. Budd. ;
A letter from Hugh Craig, president of
the Chamber of Commerce, wan read. Mr.
Craig is very solicitous about the teach
ing of the Spanish language and reeom
rr.or.ds that a chair be established at the

president of the university was directed i
to inform Mr. Craig and his fellow corre- I
epondenta that Spanish had been taught ;
In the university since 1870, and was yet
in the course of slyly. There was an ex
pression in favor i< giving Paul Sanchez,
who is eommcniloi! as a most efficient in
structor, an opportunity to give instruction
in the language with that skill which only i

pecti to visit Egypt before returning to
California. J. B. Reinr.teln was allowed
leave of absence for one month. Consid- !
emble time was taken yesterday in the i
readjustment of salaries. Regent Miller I
kept a sharp lookout to prevent Increase
in the readjustment. Some of the profea- !
sore are not satisfied with their titles. [
For example, "Professor of Pedagogy"
does not sound just right. The suggestion
was made that It be changed to "Profes
sor of the Science, Practice and Theory of
Education." For fear this might trench
on some other professor's preserves, the
words "as Related to Character" were ap
pended.
THREE MILLION DOLLARS.
Estimate of Miss Jennie Flood's Gift
to the State University of
California.
Three million dollars! That Is the value
of the magnificent gift to the State Uni
versity of California by Miss Jennie
Flood.
Such is the estimate placed upon Miss
Flood's donation by a prominent gentle
man of this city who is well Informed as
to the affairs of the Flood family.
"Many years ago James G. Flood bought
something over 2000 acres of land in
Menlo Park, adjoining what is now
known as the residence tract, of over
500 acres," continued he. "and the man
sion that he built upon the latter ground,
over twenty years ago, cost over $1,000,
000. It Is a palace in every sense of the
word, and ranks among the finest pri
vate residences in tae world. The grounds
have been improved from year to year
under the supervision of the most artis
tic landscape gardeners until they have
reached a degree of perfection beyond
which It is difficult to proceed, as there
seems nothing more to be done to add
to their attractiveness. To keep these
grounds In order there have been em
ployed for many years a force of forty
laborers, under the direction of an ar
tistic landscape gardener, assisted by
several skilled subordinates. There are
probably no private grounds in the coun
try that have been better kept than
those surrounding the Flood mansion at
Menlo Park.
"The Flood palace, which is by no
means a misnomer, is a very large and
substantial structurr. strikingly nind
some in its general architectural design
as well as in all the minor details, re
minding the traveled person very muct
of the picturesque country seats nf the
nobility of England and of the old and !
wealthy families of France. The archi- j
tecture of the mansion, by the way, ,
seems to be a combination of the best
English and French ideas.
"I am not at all surprised that Miss
Flood has made her gift conditional upon
an agreement that this magnificent build- j
ing and the ornamental grounds that sur- |
round it shall for fifty years be kept in
a condition equal to their present condi- i
tion. This is the only requirement im- I
posed by the letter giving to the State !
University this magnificent property,
which, if this condition is complied with, j
can be utilized for the benefit of the ;
university in any way the regents may ,
ccc fit to decide. That the regents in- I
tend to carry out Miss Flood's ideas is
shown by their unanimous acceptance of
the generous gift.
"In addition to the mansion and the Im
mediate grounds the gift includes about
1200 acres of land adjoining, the value of
which at a low estimate is $1000 an acre. I
The total value of the donation is $1,000,- i
000 for the mansion; $1,000,000 for the or- )
namental grounds, including over 500 I
acres, and $1,200,000 for about 1200 acres j
adjoining, making an aggregate of $3,
200,000. I do not consider my figures out I
of the way more or less than $200,000. j
Outside of the residence and ornamental
grounds, I am of the opinion that the re
gents of the State University can dis
pose of the other landsâ the 1200 acresâ
and use the proceeds as they see fit, to
gether with the four-fifths of the capital
stock of the Bear Creek Water Com
pany, which supplies water to Menlo
Park and vicinity, this stock also being
included in Miss Flood's gift.
"I understand that Miss Flood has had
this donation under consideration for
i some time. The loneliness of the im- :
i menÃe establishment, since her mother's
death two years ago, has continually re
minded her of her departed parents, and i
she concluded to make this gift as a !
i memorial of her father and mother, to I
I whom she was most devotedly attached. '
i She decided upon making the State Uni
versity the recipient because it is a -strong
institution, capable of utilizing the gift
to the best advantage."

SOLDIER DOES
WILLFUL MURDER
Continued from First PagÂ«.
was released on giving his name and
promising to be present at the investiga
tion to be held this morning-.
One of the guards, followed by a howl-
Ing crowd of men ana boys, walked up
Grant avenue and stormed in front of
"Billy" Abbot's saloon, between Post and
Sutter streets. Several of the guard
went inside, and after a short search
they found one of their number secreted
in the rear of the saloon. He was hauled
out and subsequently Bent o the Presidio
under a guard.
The next place visited was Somerset's
saloon on Grant avenue, between BuÂ«h
and Pine streets, 'x nere were at least
a dozen of the Tennessee boys In the
place at the time, and being apprised of
the approach of the guard they dashed
through a rear door and climbing a nigh
board fence ascended to the roof of un
adjoining house. The guard followed
them, but succeeded In getting only three
of the gang. The various dance halls
along Grant avenue were also visited,
but as the soldiers knew of the presence
of the provost guard they lost no time in
making their escape.
The guard discovered another one of
the Tennessee Regiment hiding in a sa
loon on Grant avenue. He was placed
under arrest and taken to O'Farrell street
and Grant avenue preparatory to being
sent to the Presidio. After being placed
on an O'Farrell street car under a guard
he broke away from his captors and ran
down Market etreet. He was pursued by

| on him, he sought to elude them by run
i ning into The Call's pressroom.
The guard followed him, and with fixed
bayonets held him until the officers of
the company arrived. He was then led
from his place of concealment and order
ed removed to the guardhouse.
Albert S. Emmett, another of the gang,
was found in a saloon, and when placed
under arrest he struck the sergeant of
the company in the face and ran away.
Two policemen followed him, and after
! a short chase succeeded in overhauling
him. Acting under instructions from the
Sergeant whom he struck, the officers
took Emmett to the California street sta
tion, where he was charged with bat
tery.
Only the interference of the police last
evening saved Private Harris, Company
M, First Tennessee Volunteers, from be
ing beaten to within an inch of his life
by a furious Eddy street mob.
Harris was drunk, "broke" and disor
derly, and in this condition descended on
a sandwich peddler near the Tlvoli Opera
House. He demanded a sandwich and a
few other delicacies gratis. "With a wild
whoop he grabbed the available supply of
i hamburger steak and flung It into the
; street. The sandwich peddler, leaping
| through the window of his wagon, chased
; Harris down Eddy street and soon had
him in the hands of a crowd already in
| censed at the cold-blooded murder or the
early evening. They were preparing to
give Harris a sound drubbing when he
' was taken In by Officer Ring and locked

A Whisky Thief and Shunned by
His Companions as a Bad
Man.
Walter Rosser -was recently court-mar
tialed for appropriating to his own use a
bottle of Government whisky, for which
he was sentenced to forfeit one month's
pay and to be Imprisoned for fifteen

promulgated for some reason or other,
and General Miller ordered the prisoner
to be released from custody. colonel
Smith of the Tennessee regiment, upon
receipt of the order of release, sent it to
Surgeon Barr, the immediate superior
officer of Rosser. Surgeon Barr, how
ever, did not release Rosser, who, never-
theless, made his way out of camp and
came Into the city.
Upon hearing of the murder Colonel
Smith at once sent into the city a patrol
of two commissioned officers and twelve
men to gather in the members of the
Tennessee regiment who were In town on
passes, eight men from each company
having beenÂ« given passes.
General Miller also ordered a patrol to
make the rounds of the city and arrest
all soldiers who were found under the in
fluence of liquor.
Rosser has been or was considered a
dangerous man when under the influenco
of liquor, and by come he has been re
garded as a nuisance when In that condi
tion.

having too much of a good time last night
and fell into the hands of the police offi
cers, who lodged them in the City Prison:

NO STARVATION
AT KOTZEBUE
Vessels Waiting to Bring
Gold Hunters Back.
ALL WHO WANT CAN RETURN
ONLY CHAEGE WILL BE FOR
MEALS WHILE ON BOARD.
Trouble Between the United States
Quarantine Officer and Kunners
on the British Ship
Galena.
There will be neither starvation nor
hardship at Kotzebue Sound this year.
Many disappointed gold hunters will prob
ably return to San Francisco, but pri
vate advices say that the majority of
those who went from San Francisco will
remain on the Kubuck River until next
spring at least. The barks Alaska and
Northern Light and the barkentlnes Jane
A. Falkenberg and Catherine Suaden are
still in Kotzebue Sound, and they will
bring back all the miners who do not like
the prospects.
"The arrangements made with the men
who went up on the Jane A. Falkenberg
were that we should wait a reasonable
time at Kotzebue Sound in order to bring
them back if the venture proved a fizzle,"
said L. E. Noonan, one of the owners of
the barkentlne yesterday. "All the gold
hunters we took up we will bring back
free. All it will cost them will be the
price of their meals, and it will not cost
them that if they have their provisions
with them. All of them should be well
provided in that respect, aa they took
enough with them to last them two years.
The men who went up on the Alaska and
Northern Light will be treated In the
same manner, as will also the Catherine
Sudden's passengers. Aa far, therefore,
as the people who went from San Fran
cisco are concerned, there need be not the
slightest fear, as all the vessels named
are being held up there until the very
last moment, in order to bring back all
of those who went up on them, if neces
sary.
"As to there being no gold up there,
that is a question that remains to be set
tled. If there is none, then there must oe
some monumental liars in this world.
There are men up there now who said
that they knew of their own knowledge
that there was gold in plenty at the head
waters of the Kubuck. They backed up
their assertions by buying outfits and
paying cash for them and cash for their
passage. Of course, there will be plenty
of men who will come back disappointed
because they could not find gold like peb
bles on the beach. But lam satisfied that
those who remainâ and my son will be
among the numberâ will bring back a dif
ferent story next year."
From Mr. Noonan's statement it will
be seen that all those who left San Fran
cisco for Kotzebue will be able to get
back without any trouble this year if
they want to.
The United States Quarantine Officer
went to sleep last Monday afternoon and
then tried to get even with some other
parties because of his dereliction of duty.
The British ship Galena arrived from
Antwerp, and dropped anchor off Meiggs
wharf at 3 p. m. Dr. Hill, the State Quar
antine Officer, boarded her at once, and,
finding everything all right, passed the
vessel. A number of men, representing
business houses and some friends of Cap
tain Blair, then went aboard. At 5:30
p. m. the United States Quarantine Of
ficer discovered that the Galena was in
port, and on boarding her found the gen
tlemen in question on deck and In the
captain's cabin. At first he was going to
place the men in quarantine, but finding
that he would have to do the same thing
with the ship he thought better of it, and,
after some delay, allowed the men to go.
He took all their names and addresses,
however, and Is going to report the mat
ter to Washington.
Captain Blair of the Galena is well
known in San Francisco. He was formerly
master of the White Star Line's fine ship
California, but when she was sold he waa
appointed master of the North Star. She
also was sold a short time ago, and the
captain was transferred to the Galena.
The British bark Heathfield, from
Shanghai to Tacoma, put into Yokohama
on the 13th inst. on account of the loss of
some sails.
The British bark Cambrian Queen, from
Newcastle, N. S. W., for Portland, Or.,
via Central America, is at Acapulco with
her deck fastenings damaged and one of
her boats smashed. She has been sur
veyed, and will proceed to Portland,
where she will load wheat for Queens
town.
The Hawaiian bnrk Mauna Ala arrived
from Honolulu yesterday, after a long
passag-e of thirty-three days. On August
19, in latitude 34.35 north, longitude 163.05
west, the bark C. D. Bryant, from Hono
lulu for San Francisco, was spoken. The
British ship Glencalrd, 138 clays from Liv
erpool, also got in yesterday. She arrived
off the port last Sunday and anchored
on the bar Monday night. Both vessels
report light winds and calms throughout
the voyage.
The British ship Glengyle. under char
ter to the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany, sailed for the Orient yesterday. She
took away a very large cargo but no pas
sengers. Captain Hall of the Glengyle is a
right good fellow, and made a host of
friends while he was here. He attended
the Admission day celebration of the Na
tive Sons at San Jose and had a good
time, besides being 1 made an honorary
member of Stanford Parlor.
The Orizaba Is to take the Curacoa's
place on the Mexican route in the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's line. More
steamers are required on the Puget Sound
route, and the Curacoa is to be placed on
that run.
STORY OF PRIVATION
FROM THE KLONDIKE
Deplorable Condition of Prospectors
on the Ashcroft Route â Many
Actually Starving.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 13.â A
party of miners who arrived to
day from Fort Wrangel, Alaska, relate
a story confirmatory of previous reports
of the suffering of prospectors who
tried to get into the Klondike by the
Ashcroft route. The party is composed
of James and Frank Hazard, W. Rough
and William Mullin. Their home is at
Dolphin Lake, Manitoba. In an inter
view published in an evening paper,
Mullin said:
"The scenes of distress along the trail
are vividly impressed on our minds.
We passed fully 100 outfits, representing
perhaps sixty men, and many of them
were actually starving. The poor fel
lows had in many cases lost everything
â clothing, horses and provisions â and
were struggling along in a half-dazed
condition, eating gophers, groundhogs
and squirrelsâ in fact, anything they
could get. They are a ragged, hungry
and desperate crowd of men, with
small hopes of reaching their destina

MORE TROUBLE FOR
SAN JOSE HIGH SCHOOL
Teachers' Salaries Will Have to Be
Cut for Lack of
Funds*.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Sept. 13.â The City
Board of Education held a star-cham
ber session this evening. Trustees
Graham, Kenyon, Wemple, Langford
ahd O'Neil were present.
The sole topic discussed was how to
conduct the High School on the 5%
cents levy allowed by the City Council.
There are but $11,425 in the High School
fund for the coming year, and in all
probability the High School will have
to remain in the old building for
another year and salaries will have to
be cut r.ll around. The board asked for
a 9 cents levy.
The salary list in the old High School
building amounts to 512,600 per year.
In the new school it would amount to
$14,700. This does not include supplies,
which amount to several thousand
more. If the school is moved to the
new building at least $18,000 will be
necessary to run it.
Those who will be affected by the
cut in salaries are: A. E. Shumate
(principal), $2000; C. O. Gleason, $1800;
Mrs. Mary Gleason, $1400; Mrs. E. A.
Sawyer, $1400; Cornelia Farley, $1400;

RELIEF FOR THE
FIRE SUFFERERS
Supplies Pouring Into
New Westminster.
CITIZENS DEEPLY GRATEFUL
PREPARATORY WORK FOR RE
BUILDING.
Losses Increased by the Latest Es
timates â Arrest of a Man "Who
Is Said to Have Sworn
to "Do" the Town. â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW WESTMINSTER, B. C, Sept... 1
13.â 1t is generally believed that Suh-\
day's fire was of incendiary origin.
The police have arrested Jack Shepard, ,
! a farmer, who has stated that he knew.
! the fire would happen. Shepard is con
i sidered mentally unbalanced. He was
j recently in jail for a trivial offense and
I when released swore to "do" the town.
Shepard, who was arrested on the
charge of incendiarism, was released
on his own recognizances. J. H. Stein,
who was held as a witness, ha salso
been released on a similar condition.
This action shows that the police have
little faith in the incendiary story.
The work of tearing down the ruins,
clearing away the debris and preparing
to replace the lost buildings goes in
dustriously on at all hours and there
is every indication that the royal city
will soon be on its way to recovery
from the awful blow which it was dealt
last Sunday.
Many substantial contributions to the
relief fund have already reached New
Westminster, and assurances of still
more have been received. At present,
it is hard to get a complete list of the
amount subscribed up to date, but the
principal donations are as follows:
Canadian Pacific Railway Company,
$5000; Toronto B of Control, $1000;
James Dunsmuir, M. P. $1000; Winnipeg
City Council, $500; Hamilton City Coun
cil, $500; Victoria Board of Trade, $500;
Seattle Eost Intelligencer, $100; Okanogan
Flour Mills. $50: Nanaimo City, $.*0; Sen
ator Templeman, $100; Tuckett & Son, $100;
Hamilton, $100; Eaton & Co., Toronto,
city of Montreal, $1000; Victoria Board of
Trade, $500; St. John. N. 8.. $1000; Turner,
Beeton & Co., $250; Lord Aberdeen $250.
It is estimated that over $10,000 worth,
of goods have already reached New
Westminster for relief purposes. To
night Premier Semlin received the fol
lowing telegram from Hon. R. Har
court, Treasurer of Ontario: "The
province of Ontario deeply sympathizes
with the citizens of New Westminster.
As its contribution to the relief fund
you may draw on me for $2500."
The Victoria City Council sent a sym
pathetic message and $1000 to invest in
food.
The people of New Westminster are
deeply grateful for all these kind to
kens from the different Dominion cities.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 13.â 1t is
now estimated that the property loss of
the New Westminster flre is greater
than first announced. Major Ovens

INSTRUCTS FOR
ROBERT N. BULLA
Republican Conversion Blasts De
Young's Senatorial Aspira
tions.
Adopts a Resolution Pledging Its Legislative
Nominees to Support a Southern
Candidate.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 13.â We believe that Southern
California is entitled to name the next United States Sen
ator, and we hereby pledge our legislative nominees from
the several Assembly and Senatorial districts of this county
to that proposition, and all such nominees are hereby in
structed to use all honorable means to secure the election of
a Republican United States Senator from Southern Califor
nia, and they are hereby requested to vote at the next ses
sion of the Legislature for a Senator from Southern Cali
fornia until a Senator is elected.
The Hon. Robert N. Bulla of this county has, by his
wise and honorable action as a member of the Assembly
and State Senate, by his ability, success and reputation at
tained in his profession and by his constant adherence to
the principles of our party, demonstrated his fitness to per
form with credit to his country and his party the duties de
volving upon a United States Senator, and we commend him
as a candidate for that high office to the people of this State,
and especially to the people of Southern California, as a
man who, if elected, while doing wisely his whole duty by the
State, is especially fitted by his intimate knowledge of our
needs, his personal inclinations and loyalty to his neighbors
and friends, to conserve and advance every interest of
Southern California: and we hereby instruct our legislative
nominees to vote for him for that high and responsible
office.
By he adoption of the foregoing
resolution by the Los Angeles Repub
lican county convention to-day the
Senatorial aspirations of M. H. de
Young are blasted, though it does not
necessarily tie up the Los Angeles del
egation in oast-iron fashion to Bulla.
By the giving of a single vote the In
structions of the convention will be
complied with, as the resolution simply
goes to the extent of pledging the leg
islative delegation to vote for a United
States Senator from Southern Califor
nia until a Senator is elected.
The resolution vas evidently aimed
against De Young, and the men who
are said to have manipulated the word
ing of it are jubilant over their suc
cess.
The Republican county convention
was called to order by Chairman E. A.
Meserve promptly at 9 o'clock this
>Â. ; niiÂ«-, but it was at least a half
hour later before all of the delegates
were in their seats.
The first business transacted was the
hearing of the report of the oomrnitee
.on credentials and that of the com
mittee on organization and order of
business, which were adopted without
amendment.
The next order of business was the
reading of the report of the committee
on platform and resolutions, and when
that part of the resolution was reach
ed commending Hon. Robert N. Bulla
as candidate for United States Senator,
the convention was the scene of the
wildest enthusiasm. The resolution met
with pronounced opposition. Every ef
fort was made by Ex-Governor H. H.
Murkham, Judge John D. Work and
others to have the resolution pass as
read. This, however, was not what the
friends of Senator Bulla wanted, and a
motion was made to amend the report
to the effort that the legislative nomi
nees of Los Angeles County be in-
Ftrueted to vote for Senator Bulla for
United States Senator.
During the debate on the question,
Senator Bulla was called on for a
speech, and was greeted with prolonged
applause as he took the platform, and
In an Impressive manner reviewed his
past services to the party and to the
people whom he has served for three
terms In the Legislature of the State.
Senator Bulla left the platform amid
tremendous applause, and on the vote
being taken the amendment Instruct
ing the legislative nominees to vote for
Senator Bulla for United States Sena
tor was carried by at least two-thlrda
of ttie delgates of the convention.
The report of the committee on reso
lutions was then adopted as amended
without a dissenting vote.
The convention heartily indorsed the
Republican platform adopted In the
State convention at Sacramento and
commend to the voters of the State
Henry T. Oage as a true, independent
and loyal citizen, who would, if elected,
perform the duties of his office with
fidelity Justice and impartiality.
The convention also indorsed Russell
J Waters, the nominee for Congress
in the Sixth District, and pledged the
legislative nominee to vote for a United
States Senator from Southern Califor
nia.
The platform declares against the
participation of any Federal or other
officer or deputy in any political con
vent iun or to act on any political com
mittee. It favors the establishment of
a civil service commission and the re
duction <<{ the salaries of all officers
that are now out of proportion to the
j--ervires rendered.
The County Committee is instructed
t" adopt thf Australian system of bal
loting by 'U-ioeates at future Repub
lican conventions.
The p^opip of the county are con
gratulated nn the progress made to
ward the construction of San Pedro
harbor.
Tho patk-ncp and endurance of the
Seventh California Regiment, despite
Its disapnointments at being kept at
home when fighting was going on at
the front. Is commended and a warm
welcome is assured the boys upon their
return to Los Angeles.
The warmest thanks of the Repub
lican convention is tendered the noble
women composing the Red Cross So
ciety for their tireless devotion to and
unbounded sympathy for the soldiers
of the late war, whose sufferings they
have done so much to alleviate.
The evening session of the conven
tion was opened by th<Â» nomination for
Sheriff, and the following named were
placed before the convention as candi
dates: John Burr, incumbent; John
T. Haddock, George B. McLain, John
â¢â  'line and Will A. Hammell. On
the first ballot there was no choice.
Hammell leading, with Cline second.
McLain third and Burr fourth. Burr
and McLain were withdrawn before the
porond ballot, the result of which wan
the nomination of Hammell, he receiv
ing 417 votes, 40 more than a majority.
The convention adjourned until 9 a. m.
to-morrow. There are yet eleven nom
inations to make.
To The Call correspondent Senator
Bulla Maid:
"My heart Is overflowing with gratl
tude for the earnest efforts my friends
have put forth in my behalf. They have
labored etuly and late for me and my
Interests and they have won the fight.
I have been highly honored by the con
venticu and I fully appreciate the fact.
I wPI endeavor to demonstrate that the
indorsement given my candidacy was
not a mistake. My desire is to show the
people of California that a poor man
can be elected a Senator of the United
States and that he can go to Washing
ton, serve his term and live on the sal
ary allowed him without neglecting his
duty to his constituents and at the
same time maintain the dignity of his
position."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HEALDSBURQ, Sept. 18.â A fatality
occurred yesterday afternoon at Gey
serville, Leonard Smith, aged 13, being
shot and killed by his brother Paul,
aged IB years. The father was at work
in Alexander Valley and the mother
came to Healdsburg to visit relatives,
leaving the two boys at home. They
were amusing themselves at the time
of the tragedy playing "ghost. " Leon
ard powdered his face with flour and
enveloped himself in a sheet to Im
personate the "ghost." Paul secured
an old-fashioned Winchester rifle,
which was supposed not to be loaded,
and when the "ghost" made his ap
pearance on the steps outside he
warned him not to approach nearer or
he would fire. The "ghost" advanced
and the trigger was pulled. The bullet
entered the lad's shoulder, ranged
downward through his body and came
out of his leg. Paul, horrified at his
deed, picked up the bleeding form of
his brother and carried it to the bed
room upstairs, where he laid the
wounded boy on the bed. He then ran
for help, Nat the injury was fatal, the
unfortunate lad dying before a phy
sician reached him.
CHILE AND ARGENTINE
DRIFTING TOWARD WAR
Peru Is Aligned With OnÂ« Power
and Bolivia With the
Other.
Special cable to The HoJl and the New York
IWaJd. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
VALPARAISO. Cnile, Sept. 13.â Chile is
increasing her army to more than 100,000
men. Tuts course, I am informed, has
been determined upon as a response to
the continued opposition of Argentina to
the proposal for a general arbitration to
settle the boundary dispute.
On hlg' authority I am informed that
Bolivia has entered into a secret alliance
with Argentina against Chile. The rea
son for this is said to be Bolivia's expec
tation that a protocol with Peru will be
passed by the Chilean Congress. .This
would take away all hope of a port on
the Pacific for her, and her trade inter
ests would naturally incline her to sup
port Argentina.
Tho Chambers have been permanently
assembled here for the purpose of ap
proving the protocol with Peru. The sit
uation, therefore, in view of the contin
ued disagreement of the boundary com
missions, Is most serious.

CLOSE COMPETITION
AT THE STATE FAIR
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 13.â The hot
test competition for years in the swine
department was seen at this fair. The
classes were judged by James Withy
combe, who states that some of the

It was the intention of the judge to

CABINET DECIDES
THE PROBLEM OF
THE PHILIPPINES
Spain's SovereigQty Shall Cease
Throughout tfye Entire
Archipelago.
Madrid Must Accept the Situation or Resuroe a
War Disastrous to Spanish
Arn>s.
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Spain's sovereign
ty over all of the Philippines must
cease. This is the one general conclu
sion reached as the result of two
lengthy sessions of the Cabinet held to
day. Other important conclusions were
reached, but the main questions as to
how much territory the United States
shall demand and as to the government
of such portions of the islands as the
United States may not care to colonize
are to be left for final settlement on
Thursday night, when the President
and members of the Cabinet will meet
members of the Peace Commission at a
dinner in the White House.
The Cabinet is not a unit as to the
maximum demand which shall be made
upon Spain as a condition of perma
nent peace and the President hopes by
an exchange of views with members of
the commission to reach a decision
which will be unanimously agreed upon
as to just what our policy in respect
to the Philippines shall be. As a re
sult of his deliberations with the Cabi
net to-day the President's mind is
clearly made up on these points:
It is impossible for Spain to govern
the Philippine Islands or any portion
thereof.
The Filipinos are Incapable of self
government.
The United States having taken pos
session of Manila and Manila Bay can
not and will not withdraw from this
part of the territory and is morally
BRITISH ACTIVITY IN THE
SOUDAN EXASPERATES FRANCE.
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â A cablegram to the Sun from Paris says:
The Government is without a hint regarding the line of action adopt
ed by the British at Fashoda, which is reported to be In possession
of the French expedition. There is great exasperation in official cir
cles in consequence of British control of the wires communicating
with the upper Nile. This entbles the British to obtain news within
ten days, whereas the French have to wait three months for informa
tion to come through the Congo country.
The Eclair declares that General Kitchener has no right to go to
Fashoda. Other newspapers generally counsel firmness.

CANDIA, Island of Crete, Sept. 13.â
Rear Admiral Gerald Noel, commander
of the British naval forces In Cretan
waters, to-day issued an ultimatum to

governor of Crete, demanding that
within forty-eight hours he should de
liver up the ringleaders of the recent

fort and ramparts defending the town
and disarm the Mussulman troops.

ROME, Sept. 13.â Two Alpine regiments
will be dispatched at once to Candia, as
the admirals propose to occupy the entire
island of Crete. The Council of Minis
ters will meet to-morrow to discuss this
scheme. Italy will act in agreement with
England, France and Russia, but the
Government has decided that if a final
and radical solution of the Cretan question
cannot be arrived at it will imitate the
Austrian and German Governments and
withdraw the Italian troops.
GOVERNOR'S DAY AT
THE STATE FAIR
Mr. Budd and His Staff Expected to
Grace the Big Pavilion
To-Night.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 13.â To-mor- I
row night and Thursday night, the last '
save two of the annual State Exposi- j
tion, promise to present dazzling scenes I
at the pavilion. To-morrow will be i
Governor's day and Thursday Sacra- j
mento day. Sacramentans have the I
human weakness of desiring to go !
where the crowd goes, and the crowd
will be at the pavilion on these nights.
The Governor and his staff are ex- j
pected to arrive in the city to-morrow !
morning. They will take in the races
in the afternoon, and, of course, the
paTilion in the evening, and the event
will no doubt awaken the hospitable
wish to see that the guests of the day
have an assemblage of appropriate size
to appear before.
Nearly all the business men In the 1
city have signed an agreement to close j
bound, in the interest of clvillzatAi, to
see that a better government Is estab
lished In the place of the one thrown
down.
Whether the United States will Insist
on control of the entire Philippine
group is a question that will be set
tled after the conference with the Peace
Commissioners. The instructions al
ready drawn up are explicit and em
phatic. A member of the Cabinet said
to me to-night:
"Spain is to be dealt with as a con
quered nation. Her Commissioners will
have nothing to do but accept or reject
the demands of the United States, and
arrange details after they have accept
ed the demands in principal.
"When the United States Commis
sioners go to Paris they will have the
President's instructions which will be
in the nature of an ultimatum. They
will meet the Spanish Commissioners,
and their instructions will be read to
them. The Spanish Commissioners will
then meet separately and decide
whether or not they will accept the de
mands of the United States. If they de
sire to accept, the two sets of commis
sioners will come together again and
formally draw up and sign a treaty
embodying the terms of the United
States. If they refuse to accept and
offer counter propositions the American
Commissioners, without attempting
any negotiation, will communicate with
the President, and it will then rest with
him to say whether the suggestions of
fered by Spain will be accepted or
whether his Commissioners shall come
home and the war be resumed."
for a half-day on Sacramento day, and
most of the industrial establishments
have done likewise, so Sacramento's
loyalty to the fair will have a substan
tial manifestation on Thursday.
To-night witnessed a splendid at
tendance at the pavilion, and beaming
faces told of the effect the animated
scene had upon its thousands of par
ticipants.

GREWSOME FINDS
TELL OF MURDER
Evidence of a Shocking
Crime.
BRIDGEPORT'S DEEP MYSTERY
HUMAN TRUNK RECOVERED
PROM THE RIVER.
Police Now Have All Parts of the
Dismembered Body of the
Woman Victim of an
Assassin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Sept. 13.â A1l
the parts of the dismembered body of
the young woman so mysteriously mur
dered and mutilated and cast into the
waters of the Yellow Mill River have
been found. The trunk was discovered
to-day. The upper half, with the arms
attached, was in one package, while
the lower part of the body was In a
second package. The upper half of the
body was wrapped in what appeared to
be a black rubber carriage blanket.
There were eyelet holes in it. The ab
dominal part of the trunk was swathed
in a white rubber sheet, such as is used
in surgical operating rooms. The latter
circumstance, together with the plain
evidence that the body was severed,
like the legs and head, by using a
keen knife and a perfect-edged saw,
leads the police to the conclusioji that
the mutilation, and presumably the
murder, was done by a surgeon.
The upper half of the trunk is intact.
The stomach, liver and other organs
located in the uper part of the human
anatomy are all in place, but the ab
dominal portion of the body has been
divested of nearly every organ. This
suggests that the young woman was
the victim of a criminal operation at
the hands of a physician, who brought
his skill into play in an effort to de
stroy the evidence of the crime as we'll
as the body of the victim of his mal
practice.
The first discovery In this tragedy
was made yesterday, when two boys
found a bundle in the Yellow Mill River
that contained the legs of a woman.
They were wrapped in cloth and a
white rubber sheet, such as is used by
physicians and nurses. One leg was
chopped in two and both were cut off
at the thigh.
Another bundle was found a little
later containing the head of a woman
25 years of age. It was wrapped in a
piece of man's underwear and rubber,
tied with a corset string.
A piece of muslin in the woman's
mouth indicates that she was gagged
with it or perhaps smothered.
The woman may have been poisoned,
say physicians who have noted the
color of her eyes.

OAKLAND TRACK OFFICIALS.
Charles F. Price to Be Chairman of
the isoard of Stewards.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 13.â President
Tom Williams of the California Jockey
Club to-day announced the following re
garding the racing officials of the club:
Charles F. Price of Louisville, Ky., will
be presiding judge at the meeting given
here under the auspices of the California
Jockey Club, which will begin next week.
Next winter Mr. Price will be chairman of
the board of stewards at Oakland. Joseph
A. Murphy of St. Louis will again be pre
siding judge at Oakland, and his associate
wnl be John J. Carter of Nashville, Term.
Mr. Price, a stranger to most of the
racegoers of California, is a brilliant
newspaper man of the Falls City, and xor
many years past has been secretary of
the Louisville Jockey Club. Besides, he
has acted as presiding judge at Louisville
and Oakley and as associate judge at
Latonia. Competent critics pronounce
him one of the most competent and fear
less^ men that ever graced the judge s
stand, and as at the same time he is one
of the most genial gentlemen to be found
anywhere, the club has undoubtedly made
a very wise selection in Mr. Price.

Special Cable <â¢ The Call and the New York Herald. CoprrlKhted, 1898,
by Jaacea Gordon Bennett.
MANILA, Sept. IS. â Two more days remain until the date set by General
Otis In his ultimatum to Agulnaldo ordering the withdrawal of the Insur
gent troops from the suburbs of Manila. Whether the "dictator" will yield
is problematical, but he probably will. With his own following breaking
away Aguinaldo can hardly afford to clash with the Americans.
It Is questionable whether General Pio Pilar, commanding the troops
quartered in Malate, will obey the order to withdraw. If the order Is dis
obeyed a crisis will have arrived.
The Archbishop of Manila denies emphatically any knowledge of the ex
istence of a plot on the part of the Spanish clerical party to ruin Aguinaldo's
cause before the Paris Commission by stirring up rival insurgent leaders to
commit some overt act which will precipitate a conflict with the Americans.
"Every Spanish priest who has the good of the church at heart," the
Archbishop said to me, "hopes only to see America secure in pea6eable pos
session of the islands. In such -possession lies the only possible future for
the church here. Why should priests seek to promote discord and seek to
embarrass the nation from which alone they can hope for future protection?
Now having seen the Americans we appreciate the generous spirit in which
they conquer. No such clerical plot exists. I give my most solemn assur
ance of this,"
Private Firtaer of the First California Regiment died yesterday of dys

NO MORE NONSENSE
FROM THE NATIVES
NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: While confident
because of the cablegram received at
the Navy Department to-day from
Rear Admiral Dewey that the situa
tion in the Philippines Is not as criti
cal as was at first believed, the author-
ities have sent instructions to the mili
tary and naval commanders of such
character that their execution will
mean the end of the insurrection in the |
islands. Admiral Dewey and General |
Otis have been directed to compel rec- j
ognition by the Insurgents of the para
mount authority of the United States
in the city of Manila and on the bay.
There is to be no further latitude al
lowed the insurgents, and they will be \
compelled to respect the lives and i
property of all Spanish subjects and j
persons of other nationalities who have j
been deprived of tha protection of
Spanish arms.
Rear Admiral Dewey and General
Otis are to use diplomatic means so
long as they may find them successful
in keeping the insurgents upder control,
but should the latter exceed the bounds
laid down the military and naval forces
of this Government will be brought into i
play to bring the insurgents into sub
jection.
Rear Admiral Dewey's telegram
failed to make any mention of the sit
uation. It concerned routine in connec
tion with the management of the
squadron, such as the dispatch to him
of beef and other supplies.
"He would certainly have sent in
formation if a critical situation ex
isted," said an official to me to-day.

MADRID, Sept. 13.â There was an
other uproarious session of the Senate
to-day. Count Almenas, referring to his
statement of yesterday, giving the
names of the generals he recently said
ought to have their sashes tied around
their necks instead of around their
waists, again named Weyler, Blanco
and Primo de Rivera, after which he
also included Admiral Cervera in the
category, and said that General Linares
â¢was incompetent and ought to be ar
raigned, thereupon General Weyler
and 6thers loudly protested against
those charges, and General Weyler
called on Count Almenas to again name
those generals who were accused of
failing to do their duty, and he added
that if the accusations were true and
the culprits could not be legally pun
ished the generals would take the mat
ter into their own hands and inflict
proper punishment.
A great tumult ensued, the Senators
standing, shouting and threatening
each other. The President of the Sen
ate vainly strove to restore order and
broke his bell in attempting to do so.
When the debate was resumed Senor
Gonzales attached the army. He said
it had been worsted first by the insur
gents and then by the Americans. Con
tinuing, the speaker asked what had
become of the 200,000 men sent to Cuba-
He blamed GeneraLWeyler and the late
Premier Senor cfnovas del Castillo,
asserting that the laHer was omnipo
tent while in power and might have
done what he pleased.
Senor Sagasta, replying, said that
neither Senor Canovas del Castillo nor
himself had ruled long enough to
change the character of the race, which
was the true caUÃe, he claimed, of the
disaster to Spain.
"We are," he said, "an amalgamic
country- We were attacked when act-
Ing as honest men would. We defended
ourselves. I have loot mjr prestige, but
or that there were no new develop
ments would have involved consider
able expense, as the cable tolls from i
Manila to Washington are high and j
the admiral is as economical aa possi- j
ble. There is no doubt that his failure j
to mention the situation shows that he I
considers It satisfactory, and, as he Is '
the judge, the administration is willing :
to rely on his silence."
I was told authoritatively to-day that \
Rear Admiral Dewey had not repeated ;
his request for a battleship and ar- |
mored cruiser. The department has '
perfected arrangements, however, to I
send reinforcements as promptly as !
possible. The battleships Oregon and j
lowa, accompanied by five colliers, will i
leave the first of next week for Hono- !
lulu. Two colliers will leave the
.squadron at Bahia. Brazil, and
return to Hampton Roads. A
third collier will coal the ships at Pun- ]
ta Arenas and then return and the re- j
mainlnft two colliers will proceed with
the ships to Honolulu.
The Texas Is to have her flag quar- \
ters refitted and will not start for the i
Eas - until the conclusion of peace,
whei she will go to Manila via the
Sues canal.
SAID TO HAVE LANDED
ARMS FOR INSURGENTS
MANILA, Sept. 18.â The American
bark Abble, with a cargo of arms and
ammunition from the United States,
which left Canton, ostensibly for Sing
apore, under heavy bonds ten days ago,
has now, it is said, landed 10,000 Krag-
Jorgensen rifles and cartridges in Ba
talgas Province for thÂ» insurgents. The
truth of the report seems imnrobable,
though it comes from a good source.
The indications to-day are that the
insurgents intend to comply peaceably
with the American request to leave the
suburbs of Manila on September 15.
It is because I believe the path I am
following: is the best "
General Weyler then made a speech
of great violence, Whlfin provoked such
an outburst that the Premier had to
intervene and call upon the general to
explain his policy. General Weyler re
plied that he had not threatened the
Government institutions, but only those
who had attacked the army.
The Minister of War, General Correa,
said the Government alone -was re
sponsible. Â
The Duke of Tetuan, the former
Minister for Foreign AffairÃ, defended
Senor Canovas del Castillo, whereupon
Senor Gonzales made another attack
upon the deceased Premier, declaring
the latter had foreseen the lo6s of Cuba
and planned with Senor Sagasta to
sign the surrender.
The loss of Cuba, Senor GonzaleÃ con
tinued, was a just punishment for
those who failed to profit by the doc
trine that the colonies should not be
governed by oppression. The Senate
then adjourned.
Major General Merritt, It Is Bald
here, goes to Paris empowered to ask
in the name of the Insurgents an Amer
ican protectorate over the whole of the
Philippine Islands.
MADRID, Sept. 13.â The Chamber of

WELL-CONTESTED HANDICAPS
VENTORO BEATS THE YOUNG
DIVISION.
Scarborough Wins the Mile and
Furlong Event in a Gruelling
Drive â Shasta "Water
in Front.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 13.â 1t was a
splendid day's sport and a great day for >
horses whose names began with "S." ;
Five of the six races were captured by ,
them. There was also a vastly Increased :
attendance. Bozeman rode two of the i
victorious flyers; Piggott, Snider and j
Hennessy and Sullivan the others.
Lady Britannic made such a meteorio
wind-up In the first event that many
thought she had won on the post, but the
judges decided that she was too late, and
that Sport McAllister was entitled to the
verdict. Stepabout's was a handy win;
Shasta Water's also. Ventoro was lucky
to finish In front In the two-year-old han
dicap, because Casdale was cut off near
the half-pole. Speaking of handicaps,
Secretary Ed Smith Is entitled to great
praise for his weight-fixing In both, for
the finishes were of such a character that
the excitable man would have been likely
to have swallowed a large part of his ci
gar If he were watching the horses
closely. The finish between Scarborough,
Cromwell and Grady was especially cal
culated to cause heart disease. San Ma
teo, as was expected, made every post a
winning one in the last, but the remain
ing five races suited even the man whose
liver needed regulating.
The first event was a six furlong selling
race, and Sport McAllister was played
down from Btos to even money. Lady
Britannic was at 12 to 1, Major Cook 11
to 5, Amaea 7 to 2 (opened at 5), and the
others from 6 to 20 to 1.
To a fair start Sport McAllister dashed
to the front and led by two lengths In the
first sixteenth. In the next sixteenth
Amasa went by the solid son of Friar
Tuck and led him around into the home
stretch by two lengths. Sport as far be
fore Major Cook. McAllister said "ta ta"
to Amasa as they got straightened out
in the stretch, and, urged hard by Pig
gott, was given the verdict by the Judges
over the fast coming Lady Britannic,
who beat Major Cook a neck, Amasa
three lengths further away. Time,
l:lsVfe. Some thought Lady Britannic had
won.
In the second selling race, six and a
half furlongs, Stepabout, the 3 to 6
favorite, went to the front at once and led
at all points, finishing first with a bit left
by two lengths, Manzanilla (6 to 1) second,
four lengths before Koko (4 to 1), who
beat Glen Ann out a length in the last few
strides. The latter ran vory prominently
fur five and a half furlongs. Time, 1:23%.
A mile selling race was third on the pro
gramme. Shasta Water was made a t to
10 favorite, but receded to 4 to 6 by post
time. Polish was nt even money, Harry
Thoburn 5 to 1 (opened at 6), Joe Terry

WASHINGTON, Sept. 13.âSec
retary Gage to-day sent the fol
lowing telegram of congratula
tion to Captain Tuttle of the
Bear.
'"Captain Francis Tuttle, R. C.
S., commanding United States
steamship Bear, Seattle, Wash.:
The department extends its
thanks and congratulations to
you, your officers and crew for
the successful issue of your own
and the heroic work of the over
land expedition for the relief of
the icebound whalers. Welcome
home. Read at muster.
"L. T. GAGE, Secretary."
SEATTLE, Sept. 13.â The rescued
whalers who arrived here to-day on the
revenue cutter Bear are anxiously
waiting to hear whether the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company will provide
them with transportation to San Fran
cisco. The whalers went north on a
"lay"â that is, they were to get a cer
tain percentage of their catch â but as
their vessels and catch were lost the
company owes them nothing and need
furnish them transportation only as a
courtesy.
Of the men who were rescued by the
Bear, Thomas Burke, C. Hotes, J. G.
White, P. Polesen, Lewis Rich, H. Car
son, T. Birnbaum and M. Knudlande'r
shipped on Yukon river steamers at
St. Michael, and Oscar Rose and M.
McKenzie on the British ship lllah at
Unalaska,
Of the vessels that were frozen In
last winter at Point Barrow, the Fear
less, Newport and Jennie, which got
out of the Ice on July 8, had no whales.
The Newport had been north fifty-four
months and sent out forty whales. The
Jessie H. Freeman had caught but
seven whales when she was wrecked.
The Rosarlo. had about 600 pounds of
whalebone aboard when she went down.
The Orca when wrecked had caught
but four.
The fleet that left Ban Francisco In
March this year has done very well.
The Jeanette had two whales. The
William Davis had five and the Kar.
luk five. Twenty-two whales had been
captured at Cape Smythe station.
The vessels which went Into Lady
Franklin Bay in July one year ago have
made the following catch: Grampus
one, Narwhal two, Beluga two and
Balaena five.
Scurvy made its appearance in the
imprisoned fleet about two weeks be
fore the relief expedition arrived. The
prompt and energetic notion of Dr. Call,
who accompanied the expedition, pre
vented a spread of the scourge.

TO HAVE RESIGNED
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sept. 13.â An uncontradicted report was
received by General Lawton last night that General Maximo Gomez,
the insurgent commander-in-chief, has tendered his resignation of the
command of the Cuban army to the Cuban Government at Cama
guey, and that it has been accepted. Gomez, it appears, has been
protesting against the Cuban Government's yielding the control of
the affairs of the island to the Americans, and the explanation for
resigning was his disapproval of "passive submission to conditions
tending to the practical retirement of the Cuban republic, as such,
and the establishment of the absolute dominion of the United States."
The Cubans at Santiago were much excited by the report that
General Gomez had resigned, and there was an animated scene at
the San Carlos Club this morning when the matter was discussed.
The report was disbelieved by many, who say that General Gomez's
resignation at this time is utterly improbable. Others, however, say
Gomez resents the putting of the Cuban army under the authority
of the American generals, and claims that the Cubans should resist,
even by force of arms, if necessary.
Generals Cebreco, Castillo, Pedro, Perez and other insurgent lead
ers have turned over their commands to General Lawton. General
Perez has Â£000 men in the vicinity of Guantanamo, which he will
disband this week by order of General Castillo. There is now a
general desire on the part of the Cuban army to disband, as the in
surgents have learned that the question of their back pay will not
be considered by the Americans.

CURRENCY PROBLEM
DISCUSSED AT OMAHA
Gathering of Men Who Are National
Leaders on Either Side of the
Silver Situation.
OMAHA, Sept. 13.â One of the most dis
tinguished gatherings of financial stu
dents and authorities that ever assembled
opened a three days' session at the Ne
braska building on the Exposition
grounds this morning. Scarcely a well
known name on either side of the great
currency problem which has been so long
before the American people but is rep
resented on the programme for a set pa
per or a part in the running debate
Hon. J. Sterling Morton presided to
day. He said:
As president of the National Sound Morey
League I call this assemblage to order.
Gentlemen, you have been convoked for a
patriotic purpose. That purpose Is to candidly
discuss the money question with the Intention
of ascertaining; the best currency for conserv
ing the prosperity, strength and honor of the
American republic.
Three questions demanding your solution are-
Firstâ ls it the fixed legal ratio enacted be
tween the coins which governs the relative
value nf the metals in bullion? or
Secondâ ls it the relative value of the metals
in bullion which governs the relative value of
the coins?
Thirdâ lf no single and separate State can
maintain a fixed legal ratio between the metalH
when coined In unlimited quantities, can an
International agreement among the principal
mercantile countries of the world do so?
Mr. Morton then read Edward Atkin
son's paper on "Force Bills a Legal Ten
der." after which Editor Horace White
of the New York Evening Post opened
the conference proper with a paper on
"The History of the Gold Standard." H
F. Bartine of the National Bimetallist of
Washington. D. C, replied to Mr. White
Speaking for an hour, he went into all
the arguments in support of silver as a
money metal, co-ordinately with gold at
16 to 1.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1898.
BIG REPUBLICAN
GAINS ASSURED
Democrats Lose Ground
in Shasta County.
ALL FAVOR GAGE AND NEFF
SISKIYOTT, TRINITY, MODOC AND
LASSEN IN LINE.
Results of Recent Primaries in Red
ding a Revelation to Politicians
in the Northern Coun
ties.
REDDING, Sept, 13.â Such extraor
dinary activity is manifested in the
ranks of the Republican party of this
county this fall that the primaries held
throughout Shasta County Saturday
were marked by more enthusiasm than
at any time since the Blame campaign.
The Republicans are so confident of a
sweeping victory that everybody wanted
to be a delegate to the county conven
tion which meets in Redding on the
17th inst. Returns show that in nearly
every precinct there was more than one
ticket in the field and an unusually
large vote was polled.
For the first time in any general elec
tion Redding is divided into three pre
cincts. The new polling district dis
tinguished itself Saturday by- casting
a larger vote than either of the old
precincts. In South Redding Precinct,
where two years ago but eleven votes
were cast at the Republican primary,
fifty-eight ballots were polled yester
day. Bets were freely offered, with no
takers, that on election day South Red
ding Precinct will poll two-thirds of the
vote cast. This is an extraordinary
state of affairs, when it is considered
that Shasta was one of the banner
Bryan counties of the State at the last
Presidential election, as the free-silver
candidate received a majority of al
most 900 votes in Shasta County. Re
ports from every precinct in the county
have been received, showing the same
and even a larger ratio of falling off in
the Popocratic vote, as noted in South
Redding Precinct.
One thousand new names have been
added to the Groat Register this year.
County Clerk Drynan asserts that two
thirds of this new vote is solidly Re
publican. The town of Keswick, which
has sprung up within six miles of Red
ding, Is depended upon to add to the
Republican plurality. Keswick's exist
ence is due solely to the vast operations
of the Mountain Copper Company, em
ploying all the way from 800 to 1500
men. This in a measure accounts for
j the large number of new registrations.
i Nearly every precinct in the county
i will show a marked gain in votes com
pared to last election.
From Northeastern Shasta reports
show the most remarkable falling off
in Popocratic strength. In Fall River
Valley, where the Populists two years
j ago outvoted the Democrats and Re-
I publicans combined, not enough inter
est was taken in the success of the Pop
ulist party in this campaign to even
send a delegation to the county conven
tion. Republicans will sweep that en
tire section this year.
Most flattering news comes from Mo
doc County, hitherto invariably Demo
cratic. The chief factor of interest
there is the fight for State Senator
(Second District) between J. T. Laird,
Republican candidate, and John E.
Raker, Democrat. Both are residents
of Alturas, the county seat. The Altu
ras Plaindealer, the only Democratic
paper in Modoc County, is bitterly op
posed to Raker, charging that his nom
ination waa obtained by trickery. The
Plaindealer is backed by the leading
Democrats of the county. The disaf
fection caused by this acrimonious fight
has spread to the legislative and county
ticket. Raker will be beaten in his own
Democratic county by at least 400
votes.
Trinity County will increase its Re
publican majority. The Republican
State ticket will win in Siskiyou, Trin
ity, Modoc, Lassen and Shasta coun
ties, but in the latter Maguire'will run
slightly ahead of the remainder of the
fusion ticket. The Second District will
send a Republican to the Senate by a
large plurality. In the Fifth Assembly
District (Modoc and Shasta counties)
the Republican candidate will win, but
by a smaller vote than In the Second
Senatorial District.

"I know a Mrs. Curry, who lives in Tennessee," said the
Professor, "who never had any trouble with her health, aside
from rheumatism, until after she was sixty years of age, but
then there came some derangement of the digestive organs, and
at the suggestion of her daughter, with whom she was living,
she tried Ripans Tabules and was benefited immediately. Now
she keeps them in the house all the time, and generally takes
one just after eating. She finds that it cures any irregularities
of the bowels, and says that, in her opinion, no family should
â¢ever be without a supply of Ripans Tabules in the house."

THE FOLLY OF PETTY MALICE.
THE extent of the folly to which men and news
papers can be carried by a weak yielding to the
promptings of personal spite and petty jealousies
has just been illustrated in the course taken by the
Los Angeles Times with regard to the Republican
State ticket. For the purpose of assailing one man
on the ticket and two men on the State executive
committee, that paper has permitted its blind rage to
hurry it into a position where it is exposed to the de
risive applause of the enemies of Republicanism and
the contempt of Republicans themselves.
The Times declares with much vehemence that
Henry T. Gage is an able, upright man, well fitted to
hold the ortice of Governor of California, but it as
serts that in appointing H. Z. Osborne and \V. F. X.
Parker members of the State executive committee
he has shown himself subservient to railroad in
fluences; that the two men named are creatures of
the railroad; that their selection was a wrong of so
grievous a character that the Times is justified in as
sailing Mr. Gage for selecting them, with more bit
terness than has been hitherto used in attacks upon
him, even by the most vituperative of his political
opponents.
The course of the Times in this matter is one of
stark madness and sheer lunacy. That the proprietor
of the Times, Colonel Otis, has long been in personal
antagonism to Mr. Osborne and Mr. Parker is well
known. He has fought them about as fiercely as he
has fought organized labor, and with about as much
success; but up to this time there has been some
method even if no reason in his fighting. What has
led the Times to run amuck at this juncture is not
clear unless it be that the absence of its proprietor
has left it totally without brains.
The case is a curious one. Mr. Osborne and Mr.
Parker were members of the Republican State execu
tive committee two years ago, and assisted in the
management of the canvass that carried California for
McKinley despite the heavy defection of the silver
element from the Republican party.
Colonel Otis supported their work at that time.
He has since accepted an office from the President
whom they helped to elect, and is at this time wear
ing the shoulder straps that McKinley conferred on
him. Still his paper now assails the very men who,
as campaign managers, aided to elect the President
who gave him the office.
There is an even worse feature of the course taken
by the Times. The Times proposed three men for
membership on the executive committee. It was
deemed more expedient, however, to retain the mem
bers of the former committee, and the nominees of
the Times were rejected. It now acts as if it thought
it had a right to dictate who should and who should
not be on the committee, and because its favorites
were not named it assails everything in sight with
the frenzy of a Bombastes Furioso.
Colonel Otis, the proprietor of the paper, being ab
sent, it behooves those in charge to consider well the
condition that confronts them. The Times is not a
very influential paper, and its prestige is not great.
The avowed antagonism of its proprietor to organized
labor has long since made it something of an outcast
in journalism. If it now attacks Republicanism for
the gratification of personal spite, it will lose what
support it now enjoys from Republican readers.
Whether so raw a blunder as that already committed
can be atoned for is doubtful, but it will be worth
while for the Times' managers to try it.
Hunters complain that there is a certain deer in
the hills this season who has a habit of horning the
insides out of their valuable dogs. The hunters do
not seem to reflect that the deer never invited their
dogs to be there. The deer has a perfect right to
assume that their presence is inimical to his wel
fare.
The Examirier seems unduly excited over the find

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1898.
THE LEGISLATIVE TICKET.
DVICE upon political subjects now being the
/ order of the day, we desire, as a newspaper
entitled to be heard in the councils of the Re
publican party, to say a word concerning the legis
lative ticket. Undoubtedly it is desirable that the
Legislature of 1899 should be Republican. A successor
to United States Senator Stephen M. White is to be
chosen by that body, and unless it is Republican the
individual will be a Democrat. In fact, we know of
no more important work to be done in this campaign
by Republicans than the election of a Republican
Legislature.
A momentous question to be answered, therefore,
is, How can this be done? Can the Republicans
elect a Republican Legislature with M. H. de Young
as the proposed beneficiary of the result? Can they
pack that perennial candidate for the toga through
t!ie campaign and emerge with the Senatorship? Can
they, in short, allow De Young to choke himself
down the throats of the people and hope to install in
office a Legislature which will choose a Republican
for United States Senator?
These, as we have said, are important questions,
and should be answered. It is true that De Young
has "declined" the Senatorial office. He has said that
he is not a candidate and has no political bureau.
No intelligent person, however, should be fooled by
this campaign flap-doodle. De Young is a candidate
and has a political bureau, as the Republicans will
find to their cost if they are lulled into fancied se
curity by his siren "declination." He knows that it is
always dangerous for him to practice politics in the
open. His unpopularity is so complete and over
whelming that to announce himself as a candidate for
anything is equivalent to defeat. So he has decided
to make a still hunt for the Senatorship. He will os
tensibly take no interest in the contest, but all the
time his agents will be programming legislative dele
gations, nominating weak Democrats against De
Young Republicans, and generally working to secure
votes for their patron and employer.
All this should be prevented. If De Young suc
ceeds in covertly programming the Legislature and
the secret gets out â as it is bound to do â the entire
legislative ticket will wind up in a smash, which, lik
ened to a Southern Pacific collision, will be as an
Alaskan avalanche to a Potrero landslide.
No Legislature can ever be elected in California
pledged to choose De Young for United States Sen
ator. That is as certain as that the sun shines. What the
Republicans should everywhere do is to ascertain in
advance the Senatorial preferences of their legislative
candidates. If they are for De Young they should
be turned down. If they are non-committal they
should be turned down, also. De Young will prob
ably play the non-committal game all over the State.
At the outset, so far as the legislative ticket is con
cerned, the fact should be recognized that De
Young's Senatorial fight means defeat. If he is per
mitted to identify himself with the Republican legis
lative ticket the candidates on that ticket from
end of the State to the other will be damned. The
people do not want De Young for Senator, and they
will not have him. Nor will they permit him to
sneak up on the blind side of the office and sandbag
it. If the Republicans want the Senatorship they
must repudiate De Young everywhere.
MISS FLOOD'S MUNIFICENCE.
nISS CORA JANE FLOOD has given to the
University of California, unattended by ham
pering conditions, property worth at moderate
estimate $3,000,000. The donor provides only that
the magnificent country seat and the area immediately
around it shall be kept in good order for fifty years
and the income devoted to some form of commercial
education.
In the presence of such individual generosity there
comes to the people of this State a sense of gratitude
so profound as to be difficult of expression. Miss
Flood could not have performed any act more certain
to give her a lasting place in public esteem. There
must be satisfaction in knowing that the benefits be
stowed will be immediate, and that they will extend
on and on, past the lives pf the present generation.
That the University of California is destined to be
one of the few great educational institutions of this
country is an assured fact. Already its standing is
recognized, its influence widely felt, and in point of at
tendance it has attained dignity. Among its in
structors are educators whose fame is not bound by
the limits of the Union.
That money is necessary to the development of
such a university is a plain proposition. The larger
its funds the more will broaden its sphere of useful
ness. It can erect better buildings, obtain more per
fect and complete appliances, and secure the best tal
ent. So a gift like that of Miss Flood cannot be
measured in dollars.
It is notable that the two greatest benefactors of
the university in this material way should be women.
The liberality of Mrs. Hearst has given promise that
the university in the future shall be housed in a man
ner befitting a great university. To this she has
freely dedicated millions, and now comes the sec
ond enormous gift, and from a woman.
The death of Carl Smith is reported from Quebec
and will cause regret. Smith was an able news
paper man, and while he lacked the faculty of making
friends, the worth of his work was recognized. After
the death of Eugene Field, Smith wrote a daily
column for the Chicago Record, and though it was
not equal to the "Sharps and Flats" so thoroughly
identified with Field, it was able, readable and marked
by touches more than mere talent. Smith was well
known in Omaha, and for a brief season worked on
a San Francisco paper, but in a department which
did not permit him to display his ability. With a
companion he was drowned while on a vacation.
That his place will be hard to fill is true, and this is
more than can be said of most journalists.
The friends who are supporting Roosevelt for
Governor in New York are just now paying him the

foot in it.

MAGUIRE'S LIVERY-STABLE PLAN.
IN his discussion of Government ownership of rail
ways Judge Maguire omits any statement of the
change that came in the cost of travel and trans
portation when they changed from wagon-ways to
railways. The wagon-roads as public highways left
travel and transportation to unlimited competition,
and yet as population stretched westward from the
Atlantic and increased, and the volume of transporta
tion rose with it, there was no lowering of rates.
From the Atlantic States to the Cis-Missouri region,
when every man could put a coach or wagon on the
highway and haul freight or passengers, the rates
were always and everywhere high. Sporadically a
new opposition line would cut, like Extra-Billy Smith
in Virginia and the Great Western Stage Company in
the Northwest, when it put on opposition to Frink
and Walker, but soon rates would rise to their former
level again. Water transportation took the same
course. When traffic went by lake and river sixty
years ago it was carried at a rate that would appall
the shipper now. Yet lake and river were open to
any man or company that wanted to put on a boat,
just as Judge Maguire wants his livery stable rail
roads open to any that has a locomotive and a car.
Land rates and water rates, under his system of in
dividual competition, were so high that if reinstated
they would be an actual embargo on commerce.
The Judge avoids telling the whole truth, that the
first abatement of rates came with the appearance of
railways under corporate ownership and operation.
There is room for warrantable doubt that if railroad
ing had begun on his livery stable plan such a de
crease in rates would have followed. If the indi
vidual competition in vogue on the wagon-road had
been merely transferred to another kind of highway
it is very questionable whether we would have pro
gressed as rapidly in method and kind of railway con
struction.
Many States formerly owned railroads and some
tried to operate them. The result was that progress
was slow, tracks were defective, and corporate enter
prise proved so much more progressive and satisfac
tory that State ownership ceased. With it the strap
rail gave way to the T iron, and iron to steel, and
construction enterprises were undertaken and ac
complished that would not yet be even proposed if
left to the public inertia.
The Government invents nothing and is slow to
utilize the work of private individuals in that line.
We fought the Mexican War with flintlock guns,
though the percussion cap had been invented with the
changed mechanism of the lock required for its use.
Jeff Davis equipped his "Mississippi Tigers" not at
the Government expense with rifles of the new pattern
made in Connecticut, and that gave to the long rifle
its name of "the Mississippi rifle." It is exactly that
'â commercial instinct" to which Judge Maguire
trusts the successful working of his livery stable
scheme that outstripped anything the Government
attempted in railroading, and made it the greatest
business specialty of the century. All of the writers
on the theory of Government entering into business
agree that it would be unlikely to economically uti
lize the accumulation of individual experience or
project along the line of progress from what is.
It should be sufficient answer to his plan for Gov
ernment ownership of all public utilities that Gov
ernment never, anywhere, renders to the public like
service as cheaply or as well as the individual. The
Government operation of the postoffice is often cited
as proof that it can successfully conduct a business.
But the evidence is contradictory of the fact that it
is intended to establish. The Government sends let
ters one mile or across the continent for 2 cents' post
age, and it is called cheap. But it takes 125 letters,
on the average, to make a pound, so that we pay
$2 50 a pound for carrying letters, whether they go
from San Francisco to Oakland or to New York,
while the railroads carry the dried fruits of California
to New York for 1 cent a pound and make some
money, while the Government makes an annual postal
deficiency, for which Congress has to appropriate out
of the treasury.
If the. railroads charged as much for shipping rai
sins as the Government for shipping letters, not a
raisin could ever leave the vineyard. Surely its ad
ministration of the postomce justifies no hope that it
can give a cheaper and better service in the adminis
tration of all public utilities? It cannot be claimed
that there inheres in our Government any special bus
iness genius that can succeed where all other Govern
ments fail. Many European Governments own rail
ways, but not one gives as good or as cheap service
as we get in this country under a railroad system
evolved from the business instincts of our people.
ST. MARY'S PARK-
I I^J AGER as the people are in this year of small
crops and war taxes to avoid any increase of
â¢* â * municipal taxation, there will be universal ap
proval of the action of the Board of Supervisors in
appropriating $75,000 for the purpose of assisting in
the work of transforming the haunt of vice bounded
by California, Dupont, Pine street and St. Mary's
place into a public park. Indeed there would have
been no serious objection had the appropriation been
made for the entire $100,000, which is estimated to be
the sum required for the accomplishment of the work.
The proverbial feat of "making the desert blossom
as the rose" is as nothing in comparison with the task
now undertaken in so many cities of transforming
slums into gardens, where the residents of the neigh
borhood can find pure air and sweet odors instead of
vice and an atmosphere laden with germs of disease.
It is fitting that San Francisco should follow the
example of older cities in this respect, for young as
it is there have already grown up within its confines
many localities as subversive of public morals and as
dangerous to public health as the worst purlieus of
the great cities of the East.
By reason of the location the dens of vice on the
site of the proposed park have long been among the
most offensive in the city. From that position the
profligate men and women who resorted to it fliunted
their debauchery and lubricity in the very eyes of so
ciety and of the churches. For a time it was almost
impossible for any one to attend St. Mary's Church
without having the eyes insulted by the disgraceful
scenes of the neighborhood on the opposite side of
the street, and residents of the select district along the
summit of California Hill were compelled to pass by
the disreputable quarter on the way to and from their
homes and the stores and offices of Kearny and
Montgomery streets.
For the benefits to be derived from the, improve
ment of the locality the thanks of the public are due
to the members of St. Mary's Park Association, who,'
after having begun what was considered a forlorn
hope, conducted the struggle with tireless energy, and
after much expense of time, labor and money, have
now reached a point from which they can see victory
in sight. In what remains of their work to be done
they should have the earnest support of all good citi
zens, so that the desired end may be speedily attained
and St. Mary's Park take its place among the beauties
and attractions of the city.

THE PLAINT OF A PIONEER.
As Admission day returns memories of the exciting scenes of the early
days in California are again revived with a degree of painful pleasure
and the old pioneers realize they have passed the summit of manhood life
and now look through their declining years with a philosophic composure
to a solution of the mysteries which lie beyond.
Yet many of them are jolly and at the age of 75 ready to enter Into the
terpsichorean amusements with the third and fourth generations, and are
ever ready to give their quota of historical facts for future preservation.
The report of Judge Cotton, the president of the society, as it ap
peared in an evening paner of the 10th inst., is an epitome of the history
of the different epochs of the early California life and furnishes a text for
the future historian which should be preserved. But he failed to say a
word about the celebration of the Pioneers at El Campo, and nearly all the
press of the city was ;s silent as the ancient sphinx in regard to the de
lightful time they enjcyed in their outing, except the Morning Call; while
large headlines and cartoons, exhibiting the gayety and magnificent dis
play of the Native Sons, filled pages of the different papers.
So freat was the glamour of their holiday attire and so joyous their
festive gathering:- at San Jose that the old Argonaut, the true historic man,
was wholly forgotten amid the scenes of erayety.
While It is pleasant to know the descendants of the Pioneers are
happy and earnest in celebrating the admission of California into tne Un
ion of States, there steals a shadow of sadness over our souls as we are
made to realize that we are forgotten and no longer an important factor
in the social and commercial affairs of men.
Our work is nearly finished, and if we built better than we planned
the future will decide; but we have a conscious pride in believing we shall
leave monuments behind that will survive all decayâ more enduring than
the erranlte shaft or walls of masonry.
Our universities, colleges, churches and all the schools of learning are
our monuments, in which are embodied the spirit of the highest intelligence
and noblest thought of the human mind.
And the. various industries fostered by our care, and the extensive com
merce of our State, ranking the fifth in the Union, make the spirit of en
ergy and enterprise of the old Argonauts.
Yet in the management of our own affairs there is much room for crit
icism. During the fiscal year ending July 7, 1898, the gross receipts of
the society were $27,068 73, and disbursements $34,583 50 or an excess over
all receipts of $7514 77. Salaries amounted to $7430. The relief fund was.
$11,109.
It is believed by many that a larger amount could be appropriated to
"relief" and yet leave sufficient in the treasury to meet all expenses of the
society without drawing upon the reserve fund, which would soon be ex
hausted if the same management continues. There was an appropriation of
$365 for a bronze slab, which not more than one person out of 10,000 will ever
see, as it is in a conspicuously obscure place.
This was a useless and needless expense, and is more the expression
of juvenile and senile imbecility and folly than the expression of gratitude
for the great benefaction bestowed upon the society by James Lick. Yet
the ex-president says "Director Kruse is deserving of great praise for the
excellent taste and good judgment he has exhibited." Well, cvi boni! On
this slab we read: "This property (the slab of course) was donated to the
Society of California Pioneers by James Lick."
How would a similar slab look upon the Lick Observatory, on the Acad
emy of Science and on all the other benefactions of the great philanthro
pist? It would provoke a smile of derision in keeping with the genius dis
played, and fail to secure a solitary expression of approval
This masterly (?) exhibition of forethought reminds one of the anecdote
of the boy who wrote under his first drawing, "This is a hoss," fearing his
effort would not be understood.
Do not the massive walls and entablature tell the story, "This is one of
the benefactions of James Lick," better than any little placard upon the
side of the bnilding?
I do not say the junior members upon the board of directors are
wholly responsible for the deficits and extravagance of last year, but when
we surrender the government of the affairs of the society to the junior
members we shall lose the prestige that should cluster around the memory
of the old pioneer, and the dignity enshrined in the name of the Argonaut
will be lost forever.
When all the old pioneers shall have gone to their final rest, then the
right of inheritance and the right to control will become the legal claim
of the junior members, and not before, for the constitution of the society
makes no provision by which such authority can be delegated to them. In
making this statement I am not questioning the integrity of the junior
members, nor am I in any wise indulging in personalities; but am calling
attention to the right to act and not to the action of any individual, as the
public does not appear to understand our distinct relations. Nor would
I make any invidious distinction between the old and the new fogies.

A BIRD SONG.
A ripple of rhythm trilling a tune
Cadenced and caroled to colors of June,
Shaded with vistas of shadowy dreams.
Rhyming and timing to singing of streams.
Sounding the tint and glint of the sky,
Echoing, echoing ecstacy â
Shining the sheen and the green of the
sheaf.
Sparkling and darkling tho diamond
dewed leaf.
Painting the grace and the face of the
flower,
Kissing the lip and the drip of the shower.
Stealing the breeze of the trees and the
shades,
Drinking the dews of the dells and the
glades.
Whistling the wind-voiced violin trill.
Trebling the thread of a slender thrill;
Twittering over the trembling strings
Subtlest, sweetest and tenderest things.
Pealing a passionate paean of love,
Lyrical, limpid, wafted above-
Bird hallelujahs, echoed afar.
Chanted through nature's portals ajar.
Running in rapture the scale of song
scope,*
Wording and birding the rainbow of hope,
Pulsing and throbbing and thrilling with
June.
Fashioning, passioning all to his tune.
Praising in prisms of cadencing light,
Soaring and soaring to ecstacy's height;
Swelling his magical, music-mad throat.
Singing and winging his heavenward note!

Wind in Ireland" occurred on the night
of the 6th to the 7th of January, 1839.
There was an awful hurricane on the
west coast of England and Ireland The
storm raged in Cheshire, Staffordshire
and Warwickshire. Twenty persons were
killed in Liverpool by the falling of build
ings, and 100 were drowned in the neigh
borhood. The coasts and harbors were
covered with wrecks. In Limerick Gal
way, Athlone and other places more than
200 houses were blown away and as many
more were burned, the wind spreading the
fire. London and its neighborhood scarce
ly sustained any damage.
FIFTEEN-MILE RANGEâ J. W., Pre
sidio, Cal. The gun to which you refer Is
undoubtedly one that was manufact" _,d
by the Reading, Pa., Iron Company in
1883. The peculiarity of the gun was a
series of large protuberances arranged In
a line from under the rear end of the
gun. Each of these was shaped like a
cow's bag and communicated with the
bore of the gun. These contained pockets
for holding powder. The gun was charged
with eighteen pounds of powder at the
breech. Against that rested the projectile
in the ordinary manner; in each pockPt
was a ch;;rge of twenty-eight pounds of
powder. The breech charge was fired, and
this ignited the powder in the pockets,
each charge accelerated the projectile
afresh and forced the projectile with
great velocity. The range was from
twelve to fifteen miles. This account is
taken from a publication of about the
date griven.
SHOOTING SEA GUI.L.Sâ F. A. P.,
City. There is no law that would prevent
a person from killing sea gulls on the
Bay of San Francisco, providing that fire
arms are not used. There is an ordinance
of the city which says that "no person
shall discharge any firearms of any de
scription in that portion of the city and
county bounded by Devisadero, Fell,
Stanyan, Frederick, Fifteenth, Castro,
Twenty-sixth and Napa streets and the
outer lines of streets forming th<' . p
front, or within 3'X> yards of any public
highway, or upon any ground set apart
as a cemetery or public square or park
or within 300 yards of any dwelling
house." Now, in law it has' been held
that a ship on which persons have per
manent residence is a dwelling, and as
the Ray of San Francisco is within th<Â»
territorial limits of the city and county
of San Francisco, it follows that no one
could shoot sea gulls within 300 yards i.f
any ship, if such a ship is Inhabited,
it has also been held that the tra< k <.f
ferry and river boats is a highway, there
fore it would be unlawful to shoot gulls
within 300 yards of any course usually
traversed by ferry and river boats. This
department is of the opinion that thero
Is not much chance for one to shoot gulls
on the Bay of San Francisco without
danger of coming in conflict with the
law.
FOR THE PRESIDENCYâ Fred and
W. E. S., City. One of these correspond
ents asks: "In order to be eligible for
the Presidency of the United States is it
requisite that the parents of the individ
ual seeking the nomination should have
been born In the United States?" and the.
other asks: "If the United States Min
ister to China or any othor foreign coun
try should have a son born in that for
eign country while he was in the service
of the United States would that son, if
brought up and educated in the United
States, be eligible to the Presidency?"
The answer to the first question is no.
The constitution says that "no person
except a natural born citizen or a citi
zen of the United States at the time of
the adoption of this constitution shall bo
eligible to the office of President." The
matter of parentage does not cut any fig
ure in the question of eligibility.
As to the second question, it has never
b^en brought to the test of an up*""' rte-Â«
cis.on in a Fcde:al court, hei cc it is re
garded as still open tv aigui..ci._. Ine
constitution goes further and says:
"Neither shall any person be eligible to
that office who shall not have attained to
the age of 35 years and been fourteen
years a resident within the United
States." It is evident from the language
of the constitution that the possibility of
the birth of an American citizen while
his parents were without the jurisdiction
of the United States or his temporary
residence in another country for educa
tional or other purposes was thought of,
otherwise the stipulation for a fourteen
years' residence would not have been in
serted. "By the act of March 20, 1790,"'
known as the naturalization act. there js
a definition of "natural born." for it says:
"The children of citizens of the United
States that may be born beyond the seas
or out of the limits of the United States
shall be held as natural-born citizens."

tees Map Out Work.
BARNES TO TAKE THE STUMP
WILL SPEAK FIRST AT METRO
POLITAN HALL.
Standard Bearer Henry T. Gage Will
Remain for the Present in
Southern California
Districts.
The campaign committee of the Re
publican State Central Committee met
yesterday afternoon to map out the
routes of the orators who will go on
the stump.
Among those selected to discuss the
political issues of the day are George
A. Knight, General W. H. X Barnes
and Colonel T. V. Eddy. General
Barnes will speak at Metropolitan
Hall next Saturday night, and on Fri
day evening, September 23. he will for
mally open the campaign in San Jose.
Henry T. Gage, the Republican stan
dard bearer, will first make a tour of
the southern part of the State and the
last weeks of the campaign will see
him in the northern counties, fighting
for the success of the entire State Re
publican ticket. Gage is so well and
favorably known in Southern Califor
nia that he will bÂ© required to do but
little canvassing there. The gTeater
part of his time and energy will be
spent In the north.
The campaign committee will meet
dally to further the work to be carried
out between now and election day. The
members have entered into the cam
paign with every hope for success, and
they are confident that when the bal
are counts, it will be found that
Gage has carried the State by a hand-
Borne plurality. Dr. Pardee of AJa
meda County, who was an aspirant for
the gubernatorial nomination, is one of
th<- hardest workers on the committee,
lie is in the fight to stay, and the clever
manner in which he conducted his cam
paign in Alameda County is sufficient
guarantee that nothing will be over
looked by him that will tend to the
greater success of the Republican
party in the coming battle.

THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
Committee of One Hundred Will Pre
pare a Plan â Primaries to
Be Barred.
The Democratic committee of one
hundred met last night and transacted a
little business, the principal portion of
which was the appointment of a commit
tee of seven to devise a plan for a muni
cipal convention. The committee as ap
pointed by Chairman McDonald is as fol
lows: Charles W. Fay, M. H. Herman,
Samuel Braunhart, W. P. Hess, P. H. Mc-
Carthy, Joseph N. Noiiffues and P. J.
Tnmalty.
From the fact that no member of the
Clan Gallagher was placed on the com
mittee It is presumed that the question of
primaries will receive but little considera
tion- ,-. T TX J,

sition of Committeeman Goodwin Wil

Maxwell was appointed to the vacancy.
Th" following resolutions relative to the
d*ath of the late Dr. John F. Morse were
presented by a special committee com
posed of J. B. Relnsteln. Dr. Beverly Cole
and Edmund Godchaux:
"To live in hearts we leave behind, is not to
Dr John F Morse, as hlB father before him
after a life all too short in years, but
In well-doing, ac an ideal member or a
profession ciyisecratod to humanity.
As a preat son of a great pioneer of this
State, anil as a leader in hla profession, he did
equal honor to both.
Up was of rare Benius, and world-famed skill
as a Furgeon and physician, rapid, ready, bold,
original, tender an<3 tireless in his duties as
such, crentle and j.atler.t. and especially so to
the poor. A man of simple and modest manners
and noMe preppnc*-, of rare fidelity to duty,
and the most loyal a.nd devoted of friends, the
kindest of fathers; his career offers another ex
ample that the good die young and that death

Well has It been said that It iÂ» hard to take
to heart the lesson that such deaths teach,

his private practice, for the benefit of the pub

and county Hoards of Health, and sought In
addition as a good citizen through the field
of politics, to do something for the betterment
of his fellow beings.
We shall not look upon his like again. Let
us pause, therefore, for a moment to recall his
jTesence and his worth, and to note this trib

In affectionate regard. And appreciating by
what we ourselves feel, their greater loss than
ours we e*n4 this memorial to his fumlly and
relatives who are privileged to remember him

JUXITJS KAHN'S SPEECH.
The Fourth District's Candidate De
livers an Eloquent Address at
California Hall.
Under the auspices of the Olympia Re
publican Club Julius Kahn last night ad
dressed a large gathering of citizens at
California Ha^l. J. D. Hart presided.
When Mr. Kahn concluded several other
speakers made brief speeches congratu
latory of the fcandidate from the Fourth
District and enunciating the principles
for which he stands.
Mr. Kahn began by stating that he felt
completely at home among his friends
and life long associates, and declared thai
their confidence in him would never be
misplaced. The present campaign, he
said, was one of tremendous import to
the entire State, and its succesful termi
nation could not fail to be an unqualned
indorsement of that great statesman,
William McKinley.
"We cannot afford to make mistakes."
continued the speaker, "and we will not.
We have much to ask from the adminis
tration, and we can only get It by earn
ing it by our work. Then we shall be en
titled to it and may demand it as a mat
ter of right and not mere favor."
Mr. Kahn spoke eloquently of our new
territorial acquisitions and the extensive
field which they presented to American
enterprise, energy and capital, and he as
serted that along w;th the problem of
their government should be considered
the manifold and varied outlook which
they present for the Pacific Coast in
trade and commerce.
"One great trouble with California,"
he said in concluding, "is the fact that
the State has always been on the wrong
side of the national administration. When
the adminisi ration is Democratic the
State has been Republican, and the con
trary holds. But now we shall be with
the majority, with the intellligent think
ers of America, and at the polls we shall
be confronted only with the question of
the magnitude of our victory. We shall
be In line this time, and California will
be a new political quantity to be reckoned
with in the councils of the nation."

THE SAN FBAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1898.
LEAVITT HAS A
CLEAR FIELD
Will Be a State Senator
From Oakland.
ATTORNEY SNOOK WITHDREW
THE CONTEST FOB DISTRICT
ATTORNEY.
Harry Melvin Said to Have Enough
Votes to Defeat Judge Allen
for the Nomina
tion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 13.
Republicans are now being daily treated
to sensations. After making an active
canvass for several months to secure the
nomination for State Senator, District At
torney Snook withdrew to-day from the
contest. He gave no reason for his with
drawal, merely saying, "I am out of the
fight, and I think this Is all that is re
quired to be said."
This action of Mr. Snook disposes of an
other complication in the local ilsÂ»M. His
only competitor was Assemblyman Frank
M. Leavitt, and for several weeka it
looked as though Mr. Leavitt had the in
side track. Mr. Snook, In addition to his
duties as District Attorney, has quite an
extensive law practice, and finds that he
cannot break in upon it to do the work
necessary to a successful campaign for
Senator. It is not likely that any one else
will come into the fight, and Assemblyman
Leavitt can confidently consider himself
as a Senator-elect of the next Legisla
ture.
The withdrawal yesterday of Justice
Clift from the contest for District Attor
ney led to many rumors that Harry Mel
vln had also withdrawn, thus leaving the
field open for Judge Allen. This rumor
was positively denied by Harry Melvln
to-day.
"Frank Jordan and I are working for a
mutual purpose in the Seventh Ward,"
said Mr. Melvln, "and all stories that my
postion has changed during the past three
months are absolutely false."
It was said to-day that Mr. Melvln can
depend on over 100 votes in the convention,
and has assurance that he will get many
more.
There is no doubt that^Tudge Allen and
Henry Dalton are pooling interests in the
Third Ward. Constable Cronin is also
working with Judge. Aller^and thus Oak
land Township and the Third and First
Wards are allied.
Owing to an effort being made in some
directions to prevent Alameda from nom
inating both her candidates, it is said
thn.t the delegation from across the es
tuary will oppose the plans of the Oak
landers. Tax Collector Barber of Ala
meda seems to be assured of the dele
gation from his town, and as there is a
disposition to take up Will Harlow for
Sheriff, Barber will probably be his own
A good government club has been form
ed in the Forty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict, and It is understood that it will in
dorse J. Harris for the Assembly. The
officers are: President, M. Bernheim:
first vice president. S. Rlngoldsky; second
vice president. Louis Asher; secretary,
Ben LitzenFtein; treasurer, I. Lern^r;
sergeant at arms, M. Cohen. The Fifth
Ward Republican Club has taken a de
cided step in regard to bolters. This is
duo to the fact that A. K. Grim, George
C. Hunt, Louis Schaffer and others are
claiming to be independent Republican
candidates for office, but do not care to
go before the convention. The club has
adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Fifth Ward Re
publican Club of Oakland strictly dis
approves of the course of certain Repub
licans of this county in bolting the party
and running independently for office, on
the ground that such radical action has
a certain tendency to disrupt the party.
The following' executive committee has
been chosen: John Laughland, H. R. Ha
vens, W. H. Dickerson, H. D. Cushing,
F. it Parcells, F. B. Goodwin. Byron
Rutley, D. C. Borland, William Nat
Friend, Charles Roeth, Felton Taylor, J.
L. Champlin. George Bush, Clarence
Crowell and J. F. Taylor.
Clinton G. Dodge has decided that he
will not be a candidate for the Assembly.
This leaves the Fifty-first District to As
semblyman Howard Wright and Will
B. Pr'ingle, with Wright strongly in the
lead.
IBISH FAIB BALL.
Many Handsome and Valuable Prizes
Awarded Last Night.
The reception and ball tendered to the
ladfes who have devoted their energies
to the Irish Fair during the past month
was held last night at Mechanics' Pa
vilion. The grand march, which began
shortly before 10 o'clock, was participated
in by five hundred couples, and the cos
tumes of the ladies, contrasting with the
elaborate decorations of the hall, created
a brilliant and memorable scene.
When the special features which had
been arranged for the occasion were con
cluded the' distribution of prizes and
trophies incidental to the fair took place.

largely to the success of the fair by his

age. He was neatly dressed. The appear
ance of the body gave grounds for a sus
picion of foul play. An autopsy showed
there had been hemorrhage of the brain
and a bruise on the temple seemed to Jus
tify the theory of murder. There was
nothing by whicn to identify the man.
and the body was so badly decomposed
that it must be interred at once. Coroner
Trull will delay the inquest till to-mor
row, to see if anything further can be
learned. ________________

MODJESKA
IN "MAGDA"
Modjeska gave "Magda" at the Bald- !
win last night to a not overcrowded j
audience, but one that was conspicu
ously made up of dramatic epicureans
â the folk who have made a specialty
of staying away from the theater this
last couple of years. And it was a
fine night for the dramatic epicurean.
The play, the actress, â were of the qual
ity in which his superior soul could
revel.
"Magda" is not everybody's play. It
does not deal in the pretty Bentiments
and heroics of the hand-me-down dra
matist. It has no flaming love Inter
est, no Intrigue, no stout speeches. The
romance, such as it was, is over and
buried long before the play commences;
leaving only the final struergle of after
years and the consequences. "Magda"
is a tragi-comedy of the household,
too impartial for satire and too abso
lute for a "problem," In the cant sense.
It is as true and as terrible a picture
of every-day life as has ever been
drawn, with all of life's prejudices and
creeds and ideals battling one against
the other.
We chafe and stifle with Magda
when she returns from her free Bohe
mian world to the old home and feels
the old chains narrow around her
again. We pity, even Justify the
proud, bigoted father who says: "Look
at this home! There is no luxury â
hardly even what you call good taste;
and yet, when you see the beams of
the western sun pour through the
white curtains and lie with such lov
ing touch on the old room, does not
something say to you, 'Here dwells
true happiness?' " We sympathize
with him even to understanding why he
would rather have had Magda come
in rags and tears. And yet Magda has
but to say: "Filial love? Why, I
would like to take that dear white head
on my lap and say, iou darling over
grown baby you!' " and a more domi
nant ego grips our sympathy. The
Rector feels a something pent and un
satisfied in his placid life and Magda
urges him on with "To be greater than
our sins is worth all the purity you
preach." And the egotism of Yon Kel
lar, the lover of her youth, how sickly
green it turns in the glare of her scorn!
She is a wonderful woman, this pol
ished vulgarian Magda, with a philos
ophy and an animal power that are tre
mendous. The softening influences r.f
the rector only accentuate her strength.
She lays aside the rapier of worldliness
toward the last and fights for her child
with the beautiful savagery of the
mother. Even to the very pride-broken
death of her father she conquers, and
you feel a sort of justice in it all â and
still there is neither glory nor content,
nothing but bitterness in the victory.
I doubt if Modjeska herself knew the
extent of her versatility before she un
dertook to play this part. In it she
frees herself of all the picturesque and
elocutionary blandishments of the
classic poetic drama and makes herself
one in every sense with the relentless
modernity of the character. She does
! not bring out the big brutal note which
is always ready to be sounded in a dif
ferent interpretation; but. rather, she
makes the woman a creature of deli
cate ironies and indomitable will â her
! father's own child broadened and hard
i ened by the newer world and the vic
tories of genius. When Modjeska plays
as she did last night, with such nerv
ous power and truth and security, there
is no need to reproach her with the
triumph of the yesterdays.
Of the supporting cast, the women
were especially good, Miss Grace Fisher
I playing Marie with delightful ingenu
ousness. Miss Anna Daly doing a bit
of master work as the maid, and Mrs.
Hanna E. Sargent not overdrawing the
comic relation. But of the men, Mr.
Lonergan alone distinguished himself,
in the part of Yon Kellar this time,
I which he played with consistent un
j derstandlng. Mr. Lane was stilted and
completely out of the atmosphere as
the father, and Mr. Herman clayed the
Rector as he might have played Marc
Antony. ASHTuN STEVENS.
"La Traviata."
"La Traviata" was given an excellent
performance at the Tivoli last night.
Mlps LJchter was especially successful
as the consumptive heroine, and Wil
liam i*ruette did admirably with Ger
mant. The audience was hardly as
large as usual, but tremendously en
thusiastic. "Traviata" will be repeated
on Thursday and Sunday evenings and
at the Saturday matinee, alternating
with "Carmen."

DISCOVERY
FOR THE
BLOOD, 1.1 LUNGS; [
National Union on the occasion of
the official visit of the members of the
San Francisco cabinet. After the rou
tine business was disposed of three candi
dates were inducted into the mysteries of
the order, and then followed a programme
of entertainment arranged for the enjoy
ment of the members and the large num
ber of friends who responded to the in
vitations extended. There was a vocal se
lection by the National Union Quartet,
cornet solo by Mr. Todd; an address by
F. H. Hastings, president of the cabinet;
imitations of John McCullough, Svengali,
Edwin Booth. Tom Keene and others by
J. Hamlin, whose renditions were excel
lent and won milch applause; "Annie
Laurie" by the quartet; patriotic address
by C. J. King, secretary of California
Council; instrumental music and ad
dresses by J. E. Field, who recently re
turned from the Senate of the order, and
others. There was served a collation and
cigars, and a very pleasant fraternal
evening was spent.
OAKLAND TAX LEVY.
The Council Meets in Secret to Cut
Down Estimates.
OAKLAND, Sept. 13.â The City Council
held a secret meeting this evening for the
purpose of fixing the tax levy, but after a
long session little progress was made. The
members were anxious to use their prun
liiff knives where no heads of departments
could bother them with pleas and argu
ments, so they met by appointment in the
Mnedonough Theater block. They did not
fare much better, however and are about
as far as ever from reaching an agree-
ment.
There was a warm discussion regarding
the $80,000 for dredging Lake Merritt, and
Messrs. Girard and Cuvellier wanted to
induce the others to spread this amount
over two years. This was opposed and
heavy cuts were proposed in other direc
tions, but the arguments were unproduc
tive of an agreement. When the meeting
adjourned there was still about $66,000 to
be shaved off the estimates to keep the
levy at $1 37, which Is the legal limit, and
which is 24 cents higher than last year.
Recreation Club Billiards.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 13.â Last evening, at
the Recreation Club rooms, G. N. Tyler
and E. A. Mudgett played the third and
deciding game in the match between them
which grew out of the recent club tourna
ment. Each had won one game, and con
sequently the deciding game of last even
ing was very interesting and drew a large
crowd. There was no nandlcap, the men
boing regarded as evenly matched. After
some very good playing.Mr. Mudgett won,
having scored 140 points to 129 for Mr. Ty
ler
After this game was ended Mr. Mudgett
and Dr. Key began a series of three
games, the first of which resulted in a vic
tory for Key by a score of 140 to 135 for
Mudgett. The second game of this series
will be played next Thursday evening.

urer on the A. P. A. ticket at the last
election, on the charge of obtaining mon
ey by false pretenses. Steams on July
1 got an accommodation check for $20
from C. W. Moulthrop on the under
standing that he was not to cash it. The
check was on the Crocker-Woolworth
Bank, and Steams got Owen to cash it.
When Owen presented it at the bank he
was Informed that Moulthrop had no ac
count there.

movement. The bears sold the list freely and
their confidence was Justified by the renewal of
liquidation induced by the decline of prices. j
There was stubborn resistance to the decline '
in some of the railroad stocks, but prices Ben- j
erally fell below yesterday's low point and '
dullness intervened. The market was one of !
specialties during the greater part of the day,
and some sharp declines were shown by quite a
number. Sugar was advanced at one time on
the usual buying in anticipation of to-morrow's !
dividend disbursement, but dropped suddenly
4% from the top level in the late dealings and
unsettled the whole market. Metropolitan was
also conspicuously weak. The declaration of ;
the usual quarterly dividend on Manhattan and ,
Western Union did not avail to save-, those

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
I CHICAGO, Sept. 13.â Liverpool ' was again In
', full sympathy with Chicago, reporting 14<1 Ad
vance in September wheat and Id in December
before . trading commenced here. Thtfc was a
comforting item to the bears who were short
on wheat here, Puluth receipts being known
before the â  opening,- the â¢ number 1423 cars.
[ Those who built hopes of lower prices on that
; however, were overcome with disappointment
when they . found at the start buyers of De
cember wheat at from 62%@62?4'c. whereas yes
terday at the close 61% c was the trading fig
ure. It was soon discovered that in order to
make the big showing of receipts at , Duluth
It had been necessary to rob Minneapolis of
its due proportion, the latter place getting only
322 cars. Not long after the opening it was
seen that, notwithstanding the heavy receipts
in the Northwest; the competition among buy
ers to secure them was such that they - were
paying one cent over the price current there
at the close last night. That showing of the
supreme need of wheat for. Immediate use ob
' literated for a time all show of bearish ten
dency in the speculative crowd here and added
to the opening advance. Liverpool made fur
ther gain and in the end was from l%d@l%d
i higher than it closed yesterday. New York
1 reported numerous acceptances, of last night' 8
' cabled offer and' during the forenoon put the
1 export takings at forty-five boat loads. Dur
: ing the last hour realizing caused . a decline,
December wheat going to 62c and September to
64c. The close was %c higher for September
and Â¥-12% c gain for December on the day.
Corn was strong early with wheat, but had a
sudden collapse near . the end that converted
%c advance into %@%c decline for December
at the close. ...
The buying of September by shorts on ac
count Of the small contract stock strengthened
oats. May closed unchanged to He up.

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK. Sept. 13.â The Journal of Com
merce says: Opening prices on the new crop
of California Raisins were made public to-day
and were a disappointment to most buyers,
who had been led to believe that in consequence
of reports of a large crop quotations would be
lower than those put out. Nevertheless, as the
price was guaranteed by the association, many
buyers other than those who had already put
In orders for considerable quantities, subject to
opening prices, came in and bought quite freely.
It Is estimated that several hundred caiw were
sold for September at the new prices at New
York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and other
consuming points. Old crop Raisins on the
spot, which are cheap by comparison with the
price* on the new goods, have been in demand,
but as the supply Is light comparatively few
sales have been made. In London layers and
clusters not much Interest seems to be shown
as yet, but owing to strong reports from
Smyrna there Is considerable Inquiry for Cali
fornia Sultanas and Seedless Muscatel*.

LEATHERâ The circular of W. B. Sumner
& Co. /says: "During the past season Leather
has been growing firmer, with advancing rat*s.
For years harness was neglected until but lit
tle stock was on hand, either manufactured or
cut up.
"In consequence a sudden demand sprung up,
aided materially by the Government requisi
tions, and to-day harness Leather is ruling at
the prices of several years ago, and with lib
eral sales at full values. Sole Leather is rela
tively lower, but much of the stock which was
put into sole is now going into harness Leather.
The finished product is being sold in the North
and in the West, as the dry season In Cali
fornia has prevented anything but the small
est trade In the Interior towns of this State.
"It seems as though this active trade will
be sustained and harness Leather rule at nigh
figures for some time."

LENA WELSH A
FAIR DIVORCEE
An Elopement Ends in
the Divorce Court.
NO LOVE WITH POVERTY
MARTIN WELSH # EVEN TRIED
THE COLD KLONDIKE.
The Honeymoon Was Short and the
Young Couple Separated as
Boon as It Was at
an End.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Sept. 13.
Another elopement has ended in the di
vorce court. Mrs. Lena K. Welsh, who
tried wedded life for about a year, is once
more Miss Lena K. Palmtag.
About a year ago Haywards society
was startled by learning that a promi
nent member of the exclusive Entre Nous
Club had become the bride of a young
fellow around town. One day Martin
Welsh went to Ban Francisco with Miss
Palmtag and they were married. When
the young lady did not return in the
evening her parents were organizing
search parties when a telegram was re
ceived telling them the horrible truth.
The honeymoon did not last long, and
to-day the story was told before Judg*
Ogden. Martin Welsh had not a penny,
neither had he any business but was<
content to take what little he 'could get
â¢ from his father to sustain himself. The
young lady soon returned to her home
and the two were practically separated
within a week of their wedding. Mrs
T .\elsh is the daughter of one of the
wealthiest families in Eden Township
her father being an old-time and well-to
do brewer, whose sign is seen all over the
county.
When the Klondike fever broke out
Welsh thought he saw an opportunity to
lay the foundation for a fortune, and he
went north. He only traveled as far as
Bkagway, wh.n he became convinced
that the climate was too cold for him
and he returned on the next steamer.'
Mrs. \\ elsn tired of trying to indue*- her
husband to support her. and finally she
brought suit for divorce, charging her
husband with failure to provide. Young
Welsh did not contest the suit, and
his wife waived ail claim of alimony, and
â was given the cUFtody of the little girl
Cuveilier Commended.

DEATH OF MAURICE J. SULLIVAN.
A Special Officer Whose Upright Career Had Gained
for Him a Host of Friends Dnring Twenty Years. â 
Maurice J. Sullivan, an old resident, whose genial ways and manly Integ
rity gained for him a host of friends all over the city, died suddenly yes
terday morning from an attack of heart disease.
Mr. Sullivan arrived here from Chicago in June, 1878, at the agÂ» of 28
years, and was appointed Deputy Sheriff under Sheriff Matthew Nunan,
proprietor of the Hibemia Brewery- At the close of Sheriff Nunan'i term
Sullivan became a member of the police force of San Francisco and distln
ruiphed himself by his courteous treatment of all with whom he was
brought Into contact and by his unswerving fidelity to duty.
On May 22. 1859, he resigned from the police force to accept the more lu
crative and responsible position of special policeman on the Barbary Coast
beat at the lower end of Kearny street. In those clays the Barbary Coast
was worthy of the name, and crimes were of frequent occurrence, the vi
cinity being infested with largo numbers of the criminal ele
ment. But by the united efforts of Officers Sullivan and Con
boy crime was lessened and the criminals were either brought to
Justice or forced to leave for other parts. Of late years the diabolical
glory of the Coast departed and with it the lucrative emoluments of the
specials. But through all the varied history of that now almost purified
region Special Sullivan preserved his honor intcct. The finger of scandal
never pointed in his direction. His record was spotless, so much so that he
watr never evf-n K>euÂ»cfl of wrong.
For some time past Mr. Sullivan had been troubled with symptoms of
disease of the heart and with stomachic derangements, but these symp
toms were never sufficiently severe to prevent him from attending to the
dntios of his position. Recently he calied in Dr. Tischer to prescribe for
him. and went about his work as usual.
"Yesterday morning the end came as he had wished, almost painlessly and
without the most excruciating pang of all. the pain of parting with hla loved
ones. At half-past 7 o'clock his wife was awakened by his stertorous
breathing. She attempted tÂ« rouse him, fent found that he had lapsed into
unconsciousness. Dr. Pescia was hastily summoned, but before he arrived
th> atling man had passed peacefully away. The deceased left a widow and
four childrenâ three boys and a #rl. Mrs. Sullivan, the widow, is the sis
ter of the wife of Sergeant R. Bldwell, prison k-.eper at the Central Police
Station.
'ihe funeral will take place to-morrow from the family residence, 1311
Hyde street, between Jackson and Pacific, whence the remains will be con
veyed to St. Brlgid's Church, where a requiem high masÃ will be cele
brated. The interment will tÂ«ike plac in Holy Cress Cemetery.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP
NICETIES OF
THE CORSET
Mrs. Vermilyea's Lover
Appropriated Them.
HIS TRUNK IS SEARCHED
SEVERAL MISSING GEMS RECOV-
ERED BY THE POLICE.
Partners Fall Out on Account of the
Story Told by a Medium and
a Warrant of Arrest
Follows.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 13.
The question of who Is the proprietor of
a patent cornet has led to the disruption
of a ilrm and to the issuance of a search
warrant by Judge Allen. The corset in dis
pute is a clever arrangement, hard to un
derstand and harder to describe, but
which its inventor, Mrs. Vermilyea, de
clares is worth a small fortune to her. She
I has also sworn that ihe r-onstitution of
this particular corset, which it has taken
her years to perfect, baa been stolen by a
Mr. Benedict, who. was for some time nor
partner. There is also v romance con
nected with this dispute over the corset.
Some time ago Mrs. Vermilyea was a
prosperous maker of corsets in Toronto,
Canada. The Canadian ladies took a
i groat fancy for the particular Ideas that
Mrs. Vermilyea put into her corsets, and
she Deeded the services of sixty girls to
turn them out fast enough. At this time
Mr. Benedict became acquainted with the
fair corsot maker, nnd after she came to
California Mr. Benedict appeared In Oak
la::'! and the acquaintanceship was re
i newed. She had money and started the
business and Mr. Benedict became a part
ner. All went well for a time and finally
j they quarreled and Mrs. Vermilyea went
to San Francisco, leaving Benedict to
I look out for himself.
This quarrel was partly the result of an
1 interview Mrs. Vermilyea had with Miss
!J. -Dwyer, a medium of this city. Miss
Dwyer confided to the corset-maker that
Mr. Benedict had consulted her on certain
i propositions. During the consultation
Benedict, it is said, told the medium that
his interest in Mrs. Vormilyea was purely
| a financial one. although he believed she
! was laboring under the delusion that he
! was in love with her and Intended to mar
ry her.
I A few days ago Mrs. Vermilyea discov
ered that her late partner was infringing
on he.r patent. He had engaged some of
her work girls and was making corsets on
his own account. This brought Mrs. Vef
milyea to the Police Court this morning.
She told Prosecuting Attorney Moore that
Benedict had taken from her some rolls of
silk, some corsets and various trinkets
and that she wished to recover them. She
was given a search warrant, and with Pc-
I teetive Shorey she went to Benedict's
lodging and found nearly all the material
she alleged had been stolen from her, In
BonedicVÃ trunks. The case will come up
before Judge Allen to-morrow, and the
corset-maker says that if Benedict does
not produce other property of hers she
will swear to a warrant charging him
with larceny.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1898.
HUTCHINSON
MUST EXPLAIN
Disbarment Proceedings
Near the Close.
A NONSUIT MOTION DENIED
ACCUSED ATTORNEY TRIES TO
JUSTIFY HIMSELF.
He Will Have to Defend Vicious
Statements Made Concerning
Attorneys Beatty and
Francoeur.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 13.
Judge Hall to-day denied the motion of
Judge Murphy for a nonsuit in the dis
barment proceedings against Joseph
Hutchlnson brought by H. L. Beatty and
George H. Francoeur.
Respondent's attorney offered the mo
tion on the ground that petitioners had
failed to prove that Hutchinson knew the
charges to be false that he made in Mrs.
Gertrude Jones' answer to the mttt of
Francoeur for recovery of $600 on
a note. In denying the motion
Judge Hall remarked that there were
certainly matters that Hutchinson knew
to be false, and these hÂ« would have to
explain.
"He ought to have known upon reason
able inquiry what kind of a man Jones
was," said Judge Hall. "He was spend
ing thousands of dollars to defend How
ard and Hulda Johnson, and yet he goes
on and alleges that these people have
formed a conspiracy to defraud Mrs.
Jones."
This morning Witness H. L. Beatty de
clared that E. Norwood Jones was guilty
of complicity in the Annie Johnson scan
dal only in that he furnished her money
to procure medical aid, and he reiterated
his belief that Jack Howard was the
guilty one.
Walter Kellogg, who has charge of the
property interests of his sister, Gertrude
Jones, testified that Jones came to him
for money in January, 18&7, saying that
he was liable to be arrested for murder
and that he would need funds. By way
of explanation Jones told him that his
servant girl had died and he was being
connected with it. Jones told him he had
given Hulda Johnson $20 out of pure sym
pathy, and ever since that time he had
been the subject of blackmail. He wanted
money to hush the publication of the
story, and if it leaked out to defend him
self.
Hutchinoon was called to the stand In
his own behalf this afternoon. He ex
plained that he was one of the executors
of the Kellogg estate and as such, to
gether with Walter Kellogg, signed all
checks for money out of the estate or
paid out by Mrs. Jones, one of the leg
atees. He averred that in May, 1897,
Francoeur showed him a note for $500
which Francoeur claimed was for attor
neys' feos in defending Howard, and had
asked him if the signature of Mrs. Jones
was genuine. Hutchinson had immedi
ately questioned its validity, saying that
he would give his reasons for this opinion
at the proper time. Furthermore, that it
was afterward found Francoeur and Beat
ty had charged double the fee they had
agreed upon.
The case proceeds again to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock.
NEW ATHLETIC GROUNDS.
Designs for an Elaborate Equipment
for the State University
Being Prepared.
BERKELEY, Sept. 18.â The athletes of
the University of California, and all the
Berkeley collegians interested in college
Bports, are expecting that within two or
three years the State University will have
new athletic grounds, which will rival
those of any college in the East WhiU
as yet no step has been taken toward se
curing their construction, the plans have
all been made, and it remains to be seen
whether college spirit or the munificence
of the board of regents will carry them
out. As the expense to be Incurred will
amount to J25.000 the athletic associa
tion may have serious financial difficul
ties to overcome, but at least some at
tempt is going to be madÂ© to put the
plans through.
The design submitted to the athletic
association is the work of Edward S.
Prouty, student assistant in civil engi
neering. They provide for a three-lap
cinder track, 18 feet wide, with a straight
away 220 yards long and 24 feet wide,
the whole to be surrounded by a row of
eucalyptus trees. No expense la to be
spared upon the grand stand, which will
cost alone, it Is estimated, about $12,000.
"Within the inclosure space is being al
lowed for football, baseball and tennis
grounds, the football to be surrounded
with two fences in order to prevent all
Interference and inconvenience from on
lookers. It Is hoped that before very long
the great intercollegiate games will be
played on college fields, and the adequate
provision Is made in the plans for ac
commodating the vast throng of people
who always witness such events. The
baseball and tenniÃ grounds will be mod
eled after the best, and the work upon
each will be executed under the closest
supervision. It is estimated that fully
54,500 cubic yards of earth will have to be
removed In the course of construction,
and it is quite possible that the students
themselves may assist in this part of the
work.

SO SAYS SUPERVISOR BRITT
BIDS FOR NEW CENTRAL STA
TION PASSED.
Mayor Phelan Wants All Improve
ments Delayed Until the New
Charter Goes Into
Effect.
"The Supervisors will retrench this year
In many directions," remarked Supervisor
Brltt yesterday. "Chief Sullivan of the
Fire Department says that notwithstand
ing the fact that $6000 less is asked for
by his department this year than was
awarded last year, there will be no op
position to a still further reduction in
case It becomes necessary in order to keep
the tax levy down to a reasonably low
figure. The Committee on Fire and Po
lice, of which 1 am chairman, has- to
day passed the consideration of the bids
for placing a central fire alarm station j
in the City Hall dome. The matter was !
laid over In order to see whether or not |
we can afford to go ahead with the im- i
provement this year. It seems probable I
that the project will be dropped for the i
present."
Supervisor Delany was not so sure that I
tho citizens demanded a low tax rate. !
"How are we going to do all that the im- j
provement clubs demand if we do not
raise the money?" he asked.
Mayor Phelan said "the whole list of â 
proposed improvements oould go over
until some future time. There really does
not seem to be sufficient necessity for j
permanent building operations Just now, i
when the day is bo near at hand when i
bonds can be Issued for new construe- '
tions. Under the new charter the city i
will be permitted to bond itself for 16 pcÂ» !
cent of the realty value, or about $52,000,- j
000. This sum will be sufficient to pro- |
vide for the City and County Hospital, j
the Mission Zoo, a new police station, j
etc. However, I think that the first con- j
sideration after bonds are issuable is to |
expend $20,000,000 in securing a city wa- |
ter plant, bringing the supply from tho i
Sierra Nevada Mountains, and then we j
can well spend $2,000,000 more for a city |
lighting plant. After these items are ,
provided for there will still be $30,000,000 j
left for new buildings, parks and other !
permanent Improvements. We can afford I
to wait until 1900 for these things."
A WOMAN ARRESTED.
Socialist Labor Party Is Still Fight-
ing an Ordinance.
OAKLAND, Sept. 13.â Mrs. Jane B. j
Hassfurther, the Socialist Labor candi- j
date, was arrested this evening for vlolat- ,
ing the ordinance prohibiting public
speaking- on the streets within the
fire limits without a permit. About 300
people were assembled at Tenth and
Broadway, as It had been announced that
Mrs. Hassfurther would risk being ar
rested. The speaker had merely stated
that she was a member of tbe SoolAJlnt
Labor party because it recognized men
and women to be equal, when Sergeant
Peterson informed her that she must de
sist. She replied that the constltulon of
the United States is superior to an Oak
land ordinance, but Jumped from the
wagon with the sergeant's assistance, and
offering him her arm she walked to the
City Prison, where a bond was furnished
and she was released.
Republican Club Entertainment.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 13.â The Young Men's
Republican Club of the West End will
give an entertainment at Its new wigwam
in the Neptune Gardens to-morrow even
ing, for the purpose of raising funds to
defray the expense of erecting and fur
niphing the building. A very interesting
programme has bpen prepared, consisting
of athletic, gymnastic and acrobatic exer
cises, vocal and instrumental music and
speeches. Many of the party leaders will
be in attendance and a large audience Is
expected, as the programme for the even-
Ing is exceptional y good.

WOULD STOP ONE
LITTLE STEAL
Santa Clara County and
Its Came Warden.
MACKENZIE'S SOFT SNAP
GETS A NICE BAKE-OFT IN SAL
ARY AND EXPENSES.
Jim Rea's Lieutenant, However, Is
Not Satisfied and Is After
tne San Jos*
Postofflce.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 13.â Although Santa
Clara County Is becoming accustomed to
the raids made on her treasury under
gang rule, the people are beginning to
clamor for the abolishment of the office
of game warden. This sinecure Is filled
by no less a personage than John D. Mac
kenzie, Rea's trusted lieutenant. Just
why the taxpayers of Santa Clara Coun
ty needed a game warden has never been
fully explained by the Board of Super
visors. Of course Mackenzie had to be
cared for, but there were other jobs that
could be given him where he would be
of some use to the people. The office of
Game Warden is a worthless expenditure
of the people's money, and ' Santa Clara
Is about the only county that has one.
Several of the counties appointed one at
the time the Legislature passed the bill
creating the ofiice, but they were soon
dispensed with. Injunctions were brought
to prevent Auditors from signing claims,
and the wardens resigned. Not so here.
At the end of the year Mackenzie was re
elected for two years. The salary is $75
per month, with an allowance for ex
penses not to exceed $25 per month.
This last proviso is carried out to the
letter, for during all the time Maczen
rie has been in office he has drawn the
full expense allowance. His bills, al
though In stereotyped form month after
month, will serve to show how he uses
the people's money. The one given be
low is a fair sample:
April Trip to Guadalupe J 1 00
April 18â Trip to San Francisco (Fish
Com.) 3 50
April 18â Postage on game laws 1 00
April ?oâ Keeping horse and buggy IS 00
April SO â Horseshoeing (four shoes) 1 50
Total $25 00
The principal item in each month's bill
Is $IS. While he gets a monthly salary
and !b paid for a horse and buggy, he
makes the charge of $1 for a trip to
Guadalupe. Mackenzie has a ranch at
Guadalupe, and his frequent trips to that
place are evidently to look after his own
interests. The horse and buggy that thÂ«
county pays for also does good service
on election days in drawing gang votes
to the polling-places. Mackenzie Is sup
posed to make frequent trips about the
county looking after the game, yet school
teachers, firemen, policemen and others
looking for positions can find him every
day around Boss Rea's office.
Citizens are beginning to Inquire just
what Mackenzie doos. Mackenzie was
elected for two years by the present
Board of Supervisors, about half of which
has expired. Already a movement is on
foot to have the office abolished at the
expiration of the term. The Supr-vlsors
now up for office should be pledged to
abolish the sinecure. The Populists' con
vention a week ago adopted a resolution
favoring doing away with the office of
game warden.
Mackenzie's report for the quarter end
ing June 30 1b given below, and shows
what the game warden accomplished in
that time:
The birds that were placed In the woods of
this county during: the last rear have Increased
In numbers to a' considerable extent, as much.
In fact, as could have been expected.
This Is particularly true as to pheasants.
They have mated, and the young ones have
grown and are themselves In turn mating: this
year.
The skylarks have been most prolific and have '
multiplied rapidly. They have been aeon and !
reported from all parts of the valley. They have
evidently acclimated here and are dolns well.
This has been a very unfavorable year for
fishes that have been placed In the streams.
Almost a dearth of water In all the mountain
creeks has caused great losses among them.
How far the trout have suffered can only be
ascertained after the freshets of next winter.
This worthless and amusing: informa
tion cost the county $300. Other reports
are even more ridiculous than this. Sev
eral of them end with this phrase: "No
money has comÂ© into my hands."
This same man Mackenzie wants to be
Postmaster of. San Jose. To head him
off In this latter aspiration petitions bear
ing between 5000 and 6000 names of the
best citizens of San Jose and Santa Clara
County have been forwarded to Wash
ington. The petitions state that Macken
zie "is an unfit parson for said office and
â¢we, the signers, solemnly protest against
the appointment being made."
Mackenzie comes from an office-seeking
family. His brother, Andy Mackenzie, is
Police Commissioner, and a sister, Mies
Belle Mackenzie, is supervisor of kinder
gartens. This latter office Is as much of
a sinecure as that of game warden. An
other sister Is In the School Department.
This family record In office Is only beaten
by Trustee Graham and his relatives.
CRUSADE AGAINST
FRESNO GAMBLERS
Officials Serve Notice on. the Saloons
That Games of Chance Must
Be Stopped.
FRESNO, Sept. 13.â The officers havo
begun a crusade against gambling in
this city. The games had been running
"wide open" and had becqme bo offen
sive to the decent element That a vigor
ous demand was made for their suppres-
Blon. The places in the tenderloin dis
trict known as the section "across the
track" were particularly free and easy.
Games were running in all the saloons,
right under the noses of the policemen,
but nothing was done to suppress them,
os Trustee Joe Spinney, the "boss" of the
Fifth Ward, would not brook interfer
ence with them. In the central part of
town several saloons were little better
than gambling dens.
The Trustees finally took the matter In
hand and threatened several saloonists
with a revocation of their licenses If
th<-v did not conduct orderly places. Last
night Constable Shaw ami his deputy
made the round of all the saloons and
â notified the proprietors that they would
iju.'re to close their games. Chinatown
Jras also visited and the games there
stopped.

The Good Government
League Acts.
AFTER REA'S ADHERENTS
POWERFUL PLEA TO THE STATE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE.
Unless the Ringsters of Santa Clara
County Are Put Out of Power
Republicanism Will
Suffer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 13.â A committee
representing the County Central Com-
mittee of the Good Government League
will wait upon the Republican State
Central Committee at their headquar
ters in San Francisco Wednesday and
ask that they be recognized as the Re
publican County Central Committee of
Santa Clara County. This step has be
come necessary in order to keep Santa
Clara County in the Republican fold,
and secure the election of the Republi
can legislative ticket.
The Good Government League com
mittee agreed upon this action last Sat
urday, and appointed E. A. Hayes, J.
R. Johns, J. R. Lewis, W. H. Wright
and S. P. Sanders a committee to ap
pear before the State Committee.
The Good Government League is not
alone In this fight for the removal of
the Rea County Central Committee. Re
publlcanÃ all over the county demand
It. The committee is In Rea's hands,
and the people are afraid they will sell
the party out. The personnel of the
committee is enough to dishearten the
most enthusiastic Republican, and un
less the State Committee interferes
there will be a general landslide to the
Democratic party this fall. J. D. Kel
sey and Matt Anc-rlch, Rea's candi
dates for the Assembly, are also bitter
doseÃ for respectable voters to swallow,
and their names may drag the ticket to
defeat The Democrats and Populists
will fuse on the legislative ticket, and
unless the Republicans put forth the
very best men they will not be repre
sented at Sacramento this winter.
On the Rea County Central Com
tee is the boss himself, two blood rela
tives and John D. Mackenzie, a lieu
tenant of Rea's. The rest of the com
mittee are also gangsters. How dif
ferent is the committee of twenty-five
elected by the Good Government
league. The latter are all honest and
intelligent men from different parts of
the county and in whom the respect
able Republicans have the greatest
confidence.
Something must be done, and done
quickly. Unless the State committee
recognizes the Good Government
League county committee the Republi
can legislative ticket will be defeated
in this county.
This may also affect Gage. Republic
ans are averse to rallying to the aid of a
party managed by henchmen of Rea;
this Is also true of a large class of in
dependent voters, who have turned
toward the Republican party since the
present war. The Democrats may get
all this vote, which would mean success
to them. The Reaites are sore because
Austin did not secure the nomination
for Secretary of State and are indif
ferent as to the sucess of the party. As
an instance, the county central com
mittee has not yet held a mass meet
ing to ratify Gage's election. How dif
ferent is the Republican Good Govern
ment Club. They held an enthusias
tic ratification meeting Saturday, and
are hard at work for the State ticket
throughout the county. But with Rea
In command of the central committee
in the county they have a heavy handi
cap and prejudice to overcome. The
Republican county ticket will surely be
defeated. The nominees are all gang,
nnd the reform forces of the county
have fused to beat it. The only thing
that will save the legislative ticket
now is to remove the committee and
put in men who will work honestly for
the advancement of the party.
POOR SUBSTITUTES
FOR WHITE GIRLS
Experiments of Vineyardists Prove
Mongolians to Be Failures as
Grape Packers.
STOCKTON. Sept. 13.â Covell & Son,
big vlneyardists at Woodbridge, have ex
perimented with the Chinese labor prob
lem and demonutrated to their satisfaction
that Mongolians are poor substitutes for
girls when It comes to packing grapes
Covell had a band of Chinese shipped
from Sacramento two weeks ago, all of
whom professed to be experienced grapo
packers. Covell soon found that the Chi
nese packed Just about half as many
boxes pÂ«r day as the same number of
white girls had done the previous season
Then he set them adrift into the cold
world to look elsewhere for work. Now
Covell & Son have several dozen girls et
work In a big airy shed, and work Is pro
gressing smoothly. Other vineyardists are
giving a preference to white labor this
year.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1898.
COMPETING LINE SURE
Valley Road Financing the Projected
Extension.
Transcontinental Connections Bringing Relief From
Southern Pacific Bondage in
Sight.
The Company Takes Careful Precautions to Protect Share
holders From Stock-Jobbing Sharksâ An Announcement
That Carries Grand News to the Golden State.
The efforts of the management of the San Francisco and San Joa
quln Valley Railway Company to finance the, enterprise to construct
a line from Bakersfleld to connect with Eastern lines, making a
through overland route, are meeting with very gratifying success. A
few days ago an announcement was made in The Call that such a
project was under way after a careful consideration of the feasibility
of the proposition. The proposal has been received with great
favor, as shown by a circular letter issued by the company yester
day. In which all holders of stock are given an opportunity to sign
a contract giving an option on their certificates to the Union Trust
Company of San Francisco to purchase said shares at their par value
of $100 each before January 1, 1899.
The letter to shareholders, which follows. Is self-explanatory*:
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 13, 1898.
To the Subscribers of the S. F. and S. J. Vy. Ry. Co.
Gentlemen: In order to finance a proposed railroad connecting the
terminal of this road with the transcontinental lines south of the Te
hachapa Pass it has become necessary to sign a contract giving an option to
the Union Trust Company of San Francisco to purchase the trust certifi
cates of the subscribers of this road at their par value of $100 per share
at any time before January 1, 1899. Over 16,000 shares have already signed
this contract, and you are hereby notified that if you wish to avail yourself
of the opportunity It Is necessary that you should before the Ist day
of October next take, your trust certificate to the office of the Union Trust
Company, corner Market and Montgomery streets, indorse and deposit
the 'same, sign the contract and receive the accountable receipt of the
Trust Company therefor. By doing this you will either have your stock
returned to you or you will receive $100 per share therefor before January
1. 1899. Whether you do this or not Is entirely a matter for you to decide,
but the management of the company wished every subscriber to have tne
same opportunity, and for that reason sends you this notice.
TROOPS MAY
BE ORDERED
TO HONOLULU
Gen. Miller Confident
of Such a Move.
AWAITS MErtRIAM'S RETURN
SUSPICIOUS OF GERMANY'S
INTENT.
Seventh Regiment Ready to Go Home
Next Weekâ The Sixth Wants
to Be Mustered Out in
Stockton.
Brigadier General Miller Is confident
that the return of General Merriam will
mean a lively stirring up among the
troops now at the Presidio. He still holds
to the opinion that he has expressed all
along, and that is that when General Mer
rlam arrives he will adviÃe the sending of
the forces now here to Honolulu. As the
general puts it, the only thing to be done
is to wait. He believes that more men will
be needed in the Philippines. His reason
for so expressing himself is the defiant
ami aggressive attitude assumed by Ger
! many recently. If we should become in
volved in any trouble with that country
j mure men would certainly be required,
| and as it is, It may be found that the
present force is insufficient to deal with
the insurgents. General Miller has never
given up the hope that the present forces
â  will be sent to Honolulu, and he believes
that two weeks will develop something:
definite of a most pleasant nature to the
soldiers now here.
The board of officers recently appointed
by General Miller to assess the damage
done the property of the negro, Zero
Thomas, by the soldiers of the Tennessee
Regiment, will act as the board of in
quiry to determine to what extent the
regiment Is responsible for the damare
done. Colonel Smith has the money ready
to pay the damage, but inasmuch as there
were soldiers from some of the other regi
ments in the crowd that destroyed the
property, he is unwilling that hln regiment
should stand for the entire blame. The
financial consideration is nothing to the
regiment; it is the principle of the affair
that now causes the hitch in the adjust
ment, and as soon as the board has made
its report the damage will be paid.
Captain Pratt, who is mustering out the
Seventh Regiment, stated yesterday that
he thought he would have everything In
shape for the regiment to go to Loa An
geles some time next week. Those sol
diers who do not want, thu thirty days'
furlough will be discharged here, but they
will get no transportation or pay for the
thirty days. Some of the men of the regi
ment were enlisted here, and the maiority
of these will no doubt take their discharge
hore. Regarding the muster out of tha
Sixth, the order Is for the regiment to go
to Stockton for this purpose. This is the
wish of Governor Budd in the matter, but
the officers are opposed to It, and it is
thought that they have sufficient influence
to carry their point and have the regiment
mustered out here. If they work their In
fluence properly there Is little doubt
that the War Department will accede to
their wishes in the matter.
The First Tennessee Regiment was paid
yesterday for July and August. The men
were hard up, and the visit of the pay
master w;ls a great blessing.
General Miller issued an order yesterday
calling upon all of the regiments to fur
nish their pro rata of the police detail to
report daily to the chief quartermaster.
Captain F. E. Buchan, Twentieth Kan
sas Regiment, has been granted a ten
days' leave of absence.
General Miller yesterday telegraphed
the War Department for authority to
send upon the Conda, about to leave for
Manila, detached recruits not to exceed
forty men In number, who have not their
descriptive lists here, to join their re
spective regiments now in Manila. It la
thought that the authority will be
granted.
The recruits of the Pennsylvania, Min
nesota, Nebraska and Montana regiments
(that have been temporarily attached to
the Seventh California Regiment) were
yesterday assigned to the Third Battalion
of the Twenty-third Infantry.
Second Lieutenant C. H. Ball, Company
E, Twentieth Kansas Regiment, who was
recently promoted from the sergeantcy
of Company K. was presented with a
sword yesterday by the members of his
former company.
General Miller has issued an order in
structing guards to prohibit "the admis-
Bion of women Inside the camp line after
8 o'clock p. m." The officer of the day
will be authorized to pass such women as
in his opinion are entitled to admission to
the several camps.

WROTE THREATENING LETTERS
Professor Wolfe, a Supposed Crank,
Being Sought For by the Police.
Sheriff Whelan and his deputies are
looking for a supposed crank, who signs
himself "Professor Wolfe." During the
past week he has 'written several ram
bling letters to lolice Sergeant Moffitt,
declaring that he is a King and threaten
ing to wreak vengeance on several per
sons. Moffitt was recently notified by sev
eral friends of Wolfe that he was men
tally deranged, and as they feared ne
would injure somebody they requested
him to throw him in Jail. Learning that
Wolfe daily called at Station E for imag
inary letters, Moffltt addressed him a let
ter, asking him to call at police head
quarters, as he wanted to see him on
important business. The following day
Moflitt received a reply ftom Wolfe, in
which he referred to fhe> sergeant of
police v a "spy," warning him to "keep
his hands off. under penalty of being
made a subject for the Coroner. Since
then he has written at least a half-dozen
letters to Moffitt, vowing vengeance and
threatening to call on him. The letters
were turned over to the Commissioners
of Insanity, and, convinced that Wolfe
was mentally unbalanced, they ordered
the Sheriff to take him Into custody. Up
to a late hour last night, however, the
Sheriff had not succeeded In locating him.

KNIGHT ARRAIGNS POLICE METHODS
Scores the Manner of
Identifying Mrs.
Botkin.
Dramatic Scene With Candy
Girls in Courtroom and
Prison.
Thursday there will be a hearing: which
ie to determine whether or not Cordelia
Fotkin shall be taken to Delaware, there
to be tried for her life In a community
which, if reports be true, has already de
cided and declared her guilty. Little mar
vel that, if the blood be on her soul or it
be free of this stain, she shrinks from
an ordeal the outcome of which could
hardly be other than conviction. Through
her counsel she will make as hard a light
as the cunning of the law can devise
against being transferred to a distant
and hostile commonwealth. Extradition Is
sought. It will be combated, and to-mor
row the strupele is to open.
Ever since the arrest of Mrs. Botkln,
charged with double murder, the assump
tion that she is the malign wretch who
committed the deed has been apparent in
almost every- act of official precedure.
Strangely enough, some of the papers of
this city have taken a similar view, and
Instead of setting forth dispassionately
the facts as they have been developed, or
the surmises as the detectives chose to
give them currency, have steadily tried to
darken the outlook for the prisoner, to be
lltt.e the possibility that she may be a
victim of circumstances, to exaggerate
every scrap of evidence tending to make
more deep the shadows about her, to
throw aside such information as pointed
to the chance of innocence. Two women
had been murdered, a sacrifice was de
manded, and here was a convenient vic
tim for the altar. The animus of this
Journalistic course may be left to the con
jecture of intelligence.
There would be no warrant for the de
claration that Mrs. liotkln had been
wrongfully accused. There are things
whii h must be explained away, for they
stand between her and the hope of free
dom, but !t does not follow that these
cannot be explained away. Much has
been made of trifles. Anybody who has
followed the case closely will admit this.
Perhaps despite the familiarity of the
public with published details, a brief re
view would not be amiss.
Alter having partaken of some candy
Mrs. punning and Mrs. Deane, of Dover,
Del., died with every symptom of arsenical
poisoning. Analysis 01' the candy showed
that it contained arsenic in deadly quan
tity. Investigation established that the
â  y bad been received through the
maiis. that the fatal package had been
purchased in San Francisco, that it had
been consigned to the postoftice August 4.
There was Inclosed in the package a note
couched in friendly terms, but only signed
"Mrs. C." Aii the astutrr.c-ss ofthe po
ll. . nf two States has foiled to estab
lish the Identity <>f --Mrs. <"." with any
approach of certainty. There was also In
OX a small handkerchief. The pur
of the candy at the confectionery
establishment of Haas has been confirm
ed. It was lound that the box was of a
kind used only in this city by Haas.
Countless similar boxes have been sold.
The sale of a box of candy in a large
store devoted to this purpose does not
create a sensation. One girl thought she
remembered selling that particular box
There were details ol the transaction
which had to be called to her mind by
another girl, who had apparently taken a
Btrango interest in a sale so common.
The handkerchief wa? from the stock of
a local store known as the City of Paris.
The Importance of this, in the absence of
any recollection that Mrs. Botkiri was in
the store on the day of the sale, the laj
mind fails to grasp. There can be no de
ni.il that the natural place to secure
candy Is a candy-store, and that one in
quest of a handkeri tnef would turn to a
dry goods store. No one at either con
cern has identified Mrs. Botkin. and there
will be no denial of the assertion that on
the day of sale there were other womei
in the city, and doubtless a number o
them went shopping.
Suspicion was directed toward Mrs
Botkin because her relations with Dun
nir.g were known to have been Intimate
They had been companions at the race
track and in revelry. He had made of her
a confidante. He had squandered money
In her company, and when he was penni
less, out of work and in distress she had
given him funds for his pressing needs
After his departure from San Francisco
they had exchanged letters, every line
breathing affection. Yet he had a wife
and child, and she a husband. At the
same time Dunning made long-distance
love to her he was writing to Mrs. Dun
ning, and that faithful woman never
thought that her lot had been cast with a
blackguard, and died not knowing Dun
ning unworthy. For this episode in Mrs
Botkin's career there can be no palliation'
and nobody would think of framing an
excuse. She is a woman of mature years
with a son 2.") years old. All her life she
seems to have been frivolous, with an in
clination toward a series of experiences
such as society classes among improprie
ties. It would seem that a carousal has
been her idea of joy. She appears to lack
brains and to be devoid of the instincts
which make clear to ordinary perception
the niceties of life. Shallow, vain and Im
prudent, there has nothing been shown to
prove that she ever felt in her heart the
impulse of murder. That she is now in a
cell she has herself to thank. Had she.
lived as a wife and mother Is supposed to
live, or had she been less open In the dis
play of her mode of life she would not
have been singled out as a monster and
an effort been made, not to find if she is
guilty or innocent, but to make plain that
she is guilty. That this is the accepted
belief of the authorities must be acknowl
edged. In a measure, as intimated, they
are being assist*! by the press. In this
much of the work has fallen to women
reporters, and that they have cheerfully
essayed the task of giving a member of
their sex an impetus toward a felon's
doom is generally recognized. Mrs. Bot
kin calls them "petticoated pests," and
cannot be blamed. In their analyses of
her they have been unfeeling and illogical
and ever bitter.
To the public mind, aside from the nat
ural prejudice created by the exposures of
the i, ;f *t of Mrs. IJotkin, there is a single
circumstance which weighs against her.
This is the purchase of arsenic There was
no secret about the purchase; she made a
declaration of the use to which she ex
pected to put the drug, and is understood
to claim that she can demonstrate that it
was employed in the bleaching of a hat
No vast importance can attach to the
occasional hysteria which is credited to
Mrs. Botkin, with intent to damage One
of the privileges of femininity is hysterics
The value of certain anonymous letters
will depend upon the possibility of tracing
the authorship to the prisoner. In this
process the word of Dunning will cut a
figure, and the Word of Dunning, the man
who has acted in a way so despicable aa
to find not c single defender, Is at a dis
count. These truths are cited to show
there are two sides to the question. One
Bide has been overlooked.
As to the tendency to exaggerate trifles
there needs only to be mentioned an arti
cle in the Chronicle of Monday, wherein
was much ado about the finding of a
string and seal such as are usea to dec
orate Haas' boxes of candy. These arti
cles were found in a room once occupied
by Mrs. Botkin, but in which she had not
been for more than a month. Such a
Btrlng possesses no more significance than
would a burned match or the butt of a
clgaratte. It is as common as a scrap of
MRS. BOTKIN TURNS ON HER TORMENTORS.
paper. Hundreds" like It are sold every
week, naturally finding their way ulti
mately to the dust bin. Yet the Chronicle
would take this string and therewith nans:
Mrs. Botkin. The necessity for this is not
plain. That paper already had her guilty,
condemned .and only awaiting the for
mality of a judicial approval of its ver
dict. It had her guilty Because somebody
had bought a 25-cent handkerchief, be
: cause a pretty clerk thinks perhaps she
j sold a box of -candy: because in many
i respects Mrs.' Botkin has: not been above
j reproach because the prisoner, connned,
| harassed and subject to jthe hounding of
gossipmongers does not maintain an as
pect invariably sunny. And, after all,
the reported: finding of the string was a
fabrication. ; .
Nevertheless, the intricate story woven
by the police is one. of thrilling interest.
It they can establish its verity in detail
â¢ the chain . will be complete : and strong In
every link. People do not seem to reflect
upon the magnitude of this task, but, on
the contrary, to regard as accomplished
that which Is scarce begun. It remains
to be proved that Mis. Botkin bought' the
i candy or had â â  knowledge of It; that she
ever saw the -andkerchief; that she
wrote the superscription on the box or
sent- the anonymous ' letters. "â  In fact,
; every allegation remains still to be estab
lished. . : Â . -.. â  . - -. : .: - ;-... ; .
Whatever the outcome, Mrs. Botkin has
passed under a cloud from -which she can
never emerge. â  With pitiless exactitude
her character has been portrayed; the
cloak of respectability has been torn from
her; her secrets laW bare.- To be an out
cast will be her punishment for evil asso
ciations and flagrant disregard of sacred
canons, the rights and dignity of wife
hood.: There is a wide difference between
being a' wanton and being able to plan
and carry out a horrible, motiveless mur
der. Yet the conclusion seems *o have
be en jumped to that because she was one
she did the other.
i Th ? r is ,a , Mrs. v Edwards, who may
thank her lucky stars that she did not fail
into the hands of the police before they

Botkin. Â«, Mr Edwards sustained associa

even escapes suspicion. ." â iormer
The story to be entire must begin back
at the time the Botkins lived in passable
accord and Dunning was a hard-working
man, happy in his family. All this has
been incidentally brought out It is not
vital, perhaps, but in It is a theme for- the
moralist. The Botkins became estranged
the Dunnings drifted apart: and by the
merest accident Dunning and Mrs Botkin
became friends. Soon ere were drink

nervous, tearful, that also would have
been turned against her. The conduct of
a person charged with murder is always
to be construed as damning. It is for Lie
purpose of thus construing it that it is
subjected to such close scrutiny.
There is in the story of Mrs. Botkin an
opportunity for preaching a sermon, an
opportunity already seized by one pulpit
orator. In the attributes of the woman
there is a studyâ a chance for the analyst
who delights in writing fine phrases about
his own notions, usually erroneous. The
simple truth is best, and requires no
adorning. The simple truth is that a
woman accused ot awful murder is about
to be placed virtually on trial; that repre
sentatives of the law declare her guilty;
that they intend, if possible, to take her
to Delaware, where she has been all but
condemned in advance. Since her deten
tion she has been looked upon as the
slayer of two estimable and inoffensive
young women. There is .nothing in the
evidence thus far made public to warrant
this view. Perhaps the police are holding
something in reserve.
A life is at stake. There has been one
tragedy; there is vague promise of an
other. Curiosity has taken the form of
si clamor for justice, and is willing to be
appeased by injustice. There are many to
whom the contemplation of suffering
seems to be a pleasure, and who delight in
the unfolding of any situation which
blasts a reputation or crushes a hope.
These will watch keenly the proceedings
In behalf of extradition. But there will
be others conscious that the law may
have made a mistake and not ashamed to
confess to sympathy for the woman in
whose vision, sleeping or waking, there
must appear the grim outlines of the gal
lows. These do not believe in conviction
without trial. They want the assassin
punished, but recognize that first the as
sassin must be caught.
KNIGHT ATTACKS THE
METHODS OF POLICE
Objects to the Manner Adopted by
Chief Lees to Connect Mrs.
Botkin With the Purchase
of Candy.
The Botkin habeas corpus proceedings
have been postponed by Judge Carroll
Cook, this time until Monday morning of
next week, and again upon the request of
the prosecution.
The ca.se came up regularly yesterday
morning, and it was evident from the mo
ment that Mrs. Botkin and the others of
the defense entered the court room that
there was something more in Eight than.
the usual routine. It was not many mo
ments before Attorney George A. Knight
injected into the proceedings an episode
that almost attained the dramatic in Its
intensity. It was evident that Knight was
angry, angry clear through, and Judge
Cook had scarcely granted the prosecu
tion's request for a further continuance
when, In a caustic arraignment of Chief
Lees for the police court methods he has
pursued throughout the case. Knight
made the reason for it known.
It had been practically prearranged be
tween prosecution and dVfense that the
hearing due for yesterday morning should
be again continued, and the defense had
expected that the mere formality neces<
sary would occupy but a few moments
time. They were accordingly surprised
when Chief Lees appeared Â«nd demanded
that, though her presence was not njces
sary, Mrs. Botkin should be brought into
court. After some argument Mr. Knight
agreed to the plan, and with Attorneys
McGo wan and Wheeler, went to the City
Prison to get the prisoner. The secret of
Chief Lees' desire for Mrs. kins' pres
ence was soon apparent, as just outside
â¢ Captain Seymour's , cozy ;' office sat Miss
Heney and Miss Dettmer, .the candy
girls, who were there to attempt, for the
third time, the identification of the pris
oner. : . : â  â ' â  -
- Mrs. Botkin, accompanied by her sister,
Miss Dora Brown, and the three attor
neys, had scarcely left the prison door
when Mr. Knight discovered ; that they
were closely followed by the two candy
girls. Angry . to a white heat, he clutch
ed Mrs. kin's arm and quickly brought
her face to face with the two startled
witnesses. ... â  â¢ .
"Mrs. Botkln,"; snid : he, ' "do you know
these women?" "I do not," replied the
prisoner, "but I presume they ; are the
candy - girls who followed me . last \ time.
â¢ Have you- brought .mo- another box ' of
bonbons?" â  ->â¢..â ':â¢â â '-.'.â â :â .>â¢â¢ â¢ ..
.' Knight was fairly .good natured again,
and with a laugh the party resumed its
way to' 1 the ; court room, â¢ closely -followed
by â  the â¢;â  two ; persistent young - women : ' of
the prosecution and by' Captain Seymour.
The chase was continued Into j the court
room, where- the â â  two /witnesses! took
seats within view of the prisoner. '-
1 Upon discovering .'. this : Knight's anger
went .up; again,* and 'in consenting to the
continuance â¢of â¢? the case he took -occa
sion to grill 'the : prosecution. ,-â¢
â  "Addressing : himself- to Judge Cook â¢ he

should be done in open court. Let those

at the present time has any business to

not at all apprehensive regarding the 'out

dignation at the exaggerated statements
regarding the finding of a piece of a
candy-box seal In the room at the Vic
toria .Hotel which was formerly occupied
by Mrs. Botkin.
It is intimated that the candy girls have
identified Mrs. Botkin as the purchaser
of the box of bonbons.
The case against Mrs. Botkin will be
called In Judge Joachimsen's court this
morning. By consent of all the parties
at Interest It will go over for one week.
The public will soon know the evidence
which Chief Lees has guarded so jeal
ously in the case. Governor Budd goes
to Sacramento on State business this
morning and will return on the late train
to-night. He was notified yesterday by
Chief Lees that all papers and affidavits
in the extradition proceedings will be de
livered at his office in the Palace Hotel
to-night. Copies will be given to the
press at the same time. The inquiry will
go on at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning !n
the Maple room. Palace Hotel.
Chief Lees received the following tele
gram yesterday:
"GEORGETOWN, Del., Sept. 13.âEx
perts positively identify handwriting on
paper inside candy box as Mrs. Botkin's.
"WHITE. Attor.iey General."
Specimens of Mrs. Boikin's handwrit

and the foregoing is the result of their
Investigations.
HE BELIEVES IN
HER INNOCENCE
Captain Taylor Has Known Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin for Twenty-
Five Years.
Captain Charles Fletcher Taylor, the
well-known capitalist and member of the
Bohemian Club, is an old friend of Mr.
and Mrs. W. A. Botkin. He believes Mrs.
Botkin is innocent of the crime charged
against her. The captain has just re
turned to the city after an absence of sev
eral weeks, and he called to see the ac
cused woman early yesterday forenoon.
Captain Taylor says:
"I knew Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Botkin over
twenty-five years ago In Joplln, Missouri,
and have been extremely friendly with
them and their respective families ever
since. The Browns, Mrs. Botkin's family,
always muved in the best society, and un
til the present time their name has never
been tarnished by even a breath. of scan
dal. Mr. Botkin conducted a hank in Jop
lin, and I was also In the same business.
We had many business dealings together
and I can freely say that I always found
him an honorable man in every sense. His
wife and her sisters were respected by
every family In their neighborhood.
"Years ago Mr. Botkin and his wife
moved from Joplln, I think to Kansas
City, and about the same time I came to
California. Some time later I again met
the Botkin s here and our families re
sumed the friendly intercourse which ex
isted bark in Missouri.
"During all these years I never heard
one word against the unfortunate woman
now under suspicion of a crime which
awakens a thrill of horror whenever men
tioned.
"I do not believe for an Instant that she
is guilty. She is a bright, well-educated
woman, of generous impulses and sympa
thetic instincts, and I believe her version
of her relations with Dunning. She is the
kind of a woman who would go out of her
way to assist any one in distress, and
when she says she gave this man money
and endeavored to straighten him up by
friendly and .sympathetic counsel I be
lieve she tells the truth.
"Mrs. Botkin's demeanor during my
visit to-day was not that of a guilty per
son. True, she is worried, and it is quite
natural she should be. Her every move
ment is watched closely by the lynx
eyed matron, and she is not left alone
for an instant, day or night. This sur
veillance would try any one's nerves.
"The accused woman did not go into
the details of her case. My visit was
friendly, and I assured her I believed In
her innocence. I am confident she will
bo completely exonerated of the accusa
tion against her. I cannot Imagine she
is capable of committing such an atro
cious crime. Her antecedents, her edu
cation, hw temperament and her social
surroundings, as I have known her, are
sufficient to convince me of her inno
cence.
"The accused woman feels very bitterly
toward some of the newspapers of this
city, because of the distorted descrip
tions of her actions and the exaggeration
of incidents in her life. She feels an at
tempt is being made to railroad her to
the gallows either here or In Delaware."

MRS. EDWARDS DOES
NOT SEEK NOTORIETY
Regrets the Prominence Which Her
Acquaintance With Dunning
Has Thrust Upon Her.
Mrs. Frances C. Edwards, whose name
has been mentioned in connection with
the Botkin case, is incensed at the efforts
of the Examiner to connect her, by infer
ence, with the Dover tragedy.
"They sent a female reporter to me,"
said Mrs. Edwards yesterday. "This
woman, who is conspicuous owing to the
eccentricities of her attire, plied me with
questions for over two hours. I gavft
her a plain statement of what I knew of
the case. This she distorted from first
to last. She said I passed variously under
the name of Parker and Barnes. The
former was my maiden name, and the lat
ter the name of my guardian, which ex
plains why people called me by those
names at different times in my life.
"I have never concealed the fact that I
have been a candy maker. I did not say
that arsenic Is sometimes used In the
manufacture of chocolate creams. I
know better than this. I say that it
was used in wafers for the complexion,
and that tannin and other poisons are
used to preserve the color of candied
fruita.
"I explained that if I contemplated
such a frightful deed I would have cho
sen some less easily recognizable candy
than chocolate bonbonp. These are hand
made, and there Is an individuality about
them by which any candy maker can
pick out the product of his shop.
"The woman reporter quoted me as say
ing that I had been a visitor at 927 Geary
street, where the Dunning-Botkin orgies
took place. I was never there. I have
never sought notoriety In this matter
and have shrunk from publicity at all
times. When employed by the Market
street Railway Company I learned all
about police methods. I know if they once
undertake to convict a person of crime
they will go to any extreme in the mat
ter.
"I have received a le/ter from Dunning
since he left here. It was written in Por
to Rico and mailed in this countryâ l
think at Key West. For personal rea
sons I will not make public its contents
Mr. Dunning was evidently angry when
he wrote it, and I do not wish the noto
riety which would attach to me if its
contents were displayed to the world."

WHY EVELYN HOLT
FIRED AT FECKER
LIVED WITH HEB AS HIS WIFE
AND MARRIED ANOTHER.
He Was Saved From Answering Deli
cate Questions by the Objec
tions of the Prosecuting
Attorney.
The preliminary examination of Evelyn
Holt, the girl who fired a shot at Charles
Fecker, hypnotist, real estate agent and
insurance broker, on the night of Sep
tember 5, was commenced before Judge}
Low yesterday afternoon. Attorney Belr
conducted the prosecution, and the de
fendant was represented by Attorneys
Barrows and Boyer.
The first witness was Dr. Galvin, who
treated Fecker for the wound in his
shoulder. He testified that after probing
for the bullet for two hdurs it dropped
out on the floor, where it was found by
the janitor. The wound was not serious,
and did not necessitate Fecker taking to
his bed.
Fecker testified to the shooting. He had
received threatening letters from the de
fendant, and once she had tried to poison
him with icecream. He had known her for
about a year. In cross-examination he
said he knew of no reason why she
should want to kill him.
Attorney Barrows introduced four let
ters which Fecker had written the de
fendant while she was in Los Angeles,
and wanted to show the relations that
had exl6ted between them. * ecker and
the defendant had lived together as man
and wife, and she had been Introduced
by him to his friends as such. Then he
sent her to Los Angeles, and a few days
later married another woman.
After considerable argument the Judge
sustained an objection by the prosecu
tion to the relations of the pair being in
quired into, on the ground that it would
be time enough to do that when the de
fense was entered upon.
George E. Roy. an undertaker, who saw
the shooting, and Policemen de Blois and
McLane, who arrested the defendant,
were examined and the prosecution rest
ed. After consulting with the defendant
her attorneys asked for a continuance till
next Tuesday to enable them to prepare
their defense, and it was agreed to.
SUTRO'S ENTERPRISES
WILL BE KEPT UP
MONEY WELL PREVENT THEM
FROM DEPRECIATING.
Judge Coffey Authorizes the Execu
tors of the Millionaire's Estate
to Hake Certain Expen
ditures.
The executors of the Sutro estate do not
propose that its varied interests shall de
preciate in value if care and money will
serve to protect them. Through their at
torneys, Lloyd and Wood and ex-Judge
McKinstry, they appeared before Judge
Coffev yesterday in the Probate Court and
asked for authority to make cer'.ain out
lays with which to continue the enter
prises controlled by the estate. Judge
Coney granted the desired order.
Mrs. Hattie Trundle, or Allen, as she
was also known, died two years ago in
Washington, D. C, and the executors
have instituted a search for her heirs, if
any exist. She will be remembered as the
beneficiary under the millionaire'- will to
whom he bequeathed $50,000 as i public
acknowledgment of injustice <. >ac her

FREE PUBLIC MABKET.
Chamber of Commerce Urges Harbor
Commissioners to Take
Action.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday the principal subject dis
cussed was that of the Free Public Mar
ket. A resolution was passed setting
forth the advantages of the projected
market and reâpsting that the Board of
Harbor Commissioners assign the blocks
of State property bounded by Davis, Pa
cific and East streets for the use of car
.tracks ana sheds required uy tne market, ,
the same also to be used for the receipt
and delivery of ordinary merchandise so
far as It may be practicable and the most
convenient to the producers of the State.
A resolution of apnroval and support was
passed with reference to the California
Manufacturers' Exposition of Home Prod
ucts of Oakland.
It was decldpd to requsst of the Board
of Regents of the Stele University to
make the study of the Spanish language
a greater feature in the university. Tha
reason for the request was that the Uuit
ed States is very likely to acquire large
possessions recently held by the Spanish
and many of the students now attending
college are sure to go into these new
fields, and the knowledge of the language
spoken there will be of great benefit to
them. Resolutions memorial of the late
J. W. H. Campbell, who for thirty years
was a member of the chamber, were
passed. The following new members were
elected: The George F. Eberhard Com
pan. Hooker & Co., Samuel Huboard, Bis
stnger & Co., Telsutaro Aokl, Garcia &
Maggini. Henry Cavell & Co., H. Taylor
and Wilson & Brother.
