Third Mate Tilton of the Belvedere Sent
for Thousands of Miles Across
Alaska to Seek Aid.
Meets Lieutenant Jarvis of the Bear Expedition
and Brings the News That After July
the Men in the Ice Will Be
Without Food.
BY GEORGE F. TILTON.
â¢PORTLAND, Or., April B.â The whal
ing steamer Belvedere. M. B. V. Mil
lftrd master, left San Francisco on the
Tth day of March, 1897, and I was
chirred on her in the capacity of third
mate.
â \Ve had either stormy weather or

lively two of our whaleboats and the

Ths same sea washed one of the
men around the decK so violently

succession of gales and were in the
same storm that wrecked the ship Sa
in aria and the schooner General Sig
lon.
We succeeded In catching one bow
head whale, the bone of which we
shipped to San Francisco on the
schooner Sailor Hoy, which was re
reiving freight from the whale ships at
Port Clarence.
In July we returned to Unalaska to
get sufficient coal to last the balance
of the voyage, and then went bark to
the Arctic Ocean. We had fair weather
up to the Bth of September last. On
that date \v<; were in young ice, about i
miles to the eastward of Point
Barrow. Close to us lay the steam
whaler Orca, Captain A. C. Sherman;
the steamer Jessie H. Freeman, Cap- \
tain Humphreys, and the schooner Ro- j
Bario, Captain Edwin Coffin. Previous!
to this date the schooner Rosario lay |
In i-ueh a dangerous position that the
Ft<-;:mer Orca steamed over to her and
1 her to safer anchorage, thereby '
saving the officers, crew and vessel.
On the evening of September 8 a na
tive boarded us, bringing with him a
message from the whaleships over to
the eastward, and requesting us to
cache on the shore all the provisions
we could spare and then work south j
as quickly as possible to a place of
safety, where they could join us and
go with us to San Francisro.
Early on the morning of the 9th the
masters of the four ships held a con
sultation as to the best method of work-
Ing our way out. The young ice was
making fast, and there was also a
heavy ridga of ice along the coast,
The San Francisco Call
through which we would have to blow
out a canal. The engine force of the
three steamers was immediately put to
work making cartridges, weighing five
pounds each, of the blasting and gun
powder on our ships, and the tonite
powder was taken out of the darting
and shoulder bombs and also made into
cartridges. These cartridges were
placed on the ends of long poles, shoved
under the ice and exploded. Mr. Wal
lÂ«er of the Orca and myself had charge
of exploding the bombs.
The distance we had to blow out was
about one mile and a half, and we
used over a thousand pounds of powder
and tonite in the work.
The balance of the crews were busy
In sawing and poling the ice out of the
way. Young ice was making- all the
time, ajid the steamers had all they
could do with both steam and sail to
work their way through the canal. The
schooner Rosario did not attempt to
come through the canal, aa Captain
Coffin hoped the Ice would open enough
to permit him to get into the lagoon
! near Point Barrow, where she would
jbe safe. We afterward learned that she
had failed to get into the lagoon.
In forcing through the ice the
Orca broke the three rudder pintels,
! making her unmanageable, so she
was taken in tow by the Freeman and
towed through the balance of the
distance.
To make this canal took all hands
three days and nights, stopping only for
meals. The ships got out of the canal
on September 14.
The Jessie H. Freeman and the Belve
dere lay by the Orca until she had re
paired her rudder, and when that was
finished all steamed toward the south,
the ice getting heavier all the time. We
arrived off the Sea Horse Islands on
the 22d day of September, a distance of
forty-five miles from Point Barrow.
On this date the Orca, while fol
lowing us, was caught between two
immense ice floes and crushed with
such force as to take the stern post
and steering gear completely out of
her and hurl the wheel through the
pilot house. Her officers and crew
jumped for the ice immediately.
At this time our ship was near clear
water, but seeing the predicament of.

the Orca's crew we turned back, work
ing through the Ice, to save them. We
finally succeeded in getting: all the men
on board our ship and steered toward
clear water again, the Jessie H. Free
man being at this time about three
miles to the northward.
We were forcing our way along,
when, about two hours after rescu
ing the Orca's crew, we saw the Free
man in the same predicament as the
Orca, and her crew jumping on the
ice, so we turned back, again to save
these men.
The wind was now blowing heavily
from the westward, forcing the old
ice against the young ice and shelv
ing it, making it impossible for us

now to get out, so we worked with
the ice toward the main land and
succeeded in getting into Pearl Bay,
the heavy ice grounding outside.
Our crew at this time numbered
forty-five men, and we had rescued
fifty-three men from the Orca and
forty-nine men fmm the Freeman. We
knew that the best place to camp
would be on the Sea H^n-se Is'.vtuls, and
ff we could fret the ship l.<*himl tho
islands we would have a change to save
her. On the twenty-third some of the
men commenced sledding 1 provisions
over to the islands, a distance of three
miles, others emptied water out of the
casks to lighten ship, the bulkheads
were torn down for the purpc.-se of
making houses on shore, the black
smith commenced making cookstoves
from the coal oil drums, and others set
to work cutting a canal.
Mr. Walker volunteered to go back
to the Orca with a ccruple of natives
and save all the provisions he could,
and said he would signal to us his
safe arrival.
That afternoon we saw smoke from
the Freeman, and at night she lit up
the sky. She burned to the water's
edge.
We afterward learned that some na
tives had boarded her, got into her
hold and had dropped a lighted lamp,
setting fire to the ship.
On the 29th of September, not having
seen any signals from the Orca, I vol
unteered to go to her, to save what
provisions I could and learn the fate
of Mr. Walker and his two natives.
I t(K>k with me four natives. I
was instructed to loose the gaff top
sails and set the main royal should we
succeed in reaching her, and if Mr.
Walker was safe to run the flying jib
up and down a few times. They would
answer by the same signals.
The Orca was lying fully twelve miles
from us. The ice between the two
ships was In a very poor condition. It
was full of holes, and' the pressure of
the heavy ice would make large cracks
in the new ice, sometimes right under
our feet, causing us at times to move
very lively. After six hours' hard
work we reached the ship and boarded
her. We found Mr. Walker and his
two natives hard at work. We imme
diately signaled our ship, as agreed
upon, receiving their signals in return,
and then went to work to get the pro
| visions Mr. Walker had saved on the
i ice. I found the ship nearly full of
water, and to get the provisions we
had to fish for them with long-han
dled bow hooks. We got thirty-two
sacks of flour and twenty cases of
canned meats, and some other material,
on the Ice. Both the ship and ice were
drifting all the time, the ship having
been kept up by the ice pressing against
her sides.
I was coming to the rail with a
case of meat, when I felt a peculiar
motion. I threw the case on the ice
as far as I could and jumped. The
ship careened slowly over on her
side and at the same time gradually
slid under the ice floe until she com
pletely disappeared.
We had not been on the ship three
hours when she sank. We then com-
menced sledding the provisions we had
saved to the south sandpit of the Sea
Horse Islands, which was about three
miles to the westward. We were two
days in getting these provisions to the
beach, making our camp on the beach,
our tent being made of boat sails.
The water was cold the thermometer
registering from 4 to 8 degrees below
zero. In the meantime the Belvedere
had been worked through the ice and
was placed in as good a place as could
be found behind the Sea Horse Isl
ands, and about fifteen miles from our
camp. Some Indians who had been out
hunting polar bear passed b our camp
and told us that we could get dogs and
sleds from Point Belcher to help take
the material saved to our ship. We
went with these natives and they
brought over two teams of five and six
dugs each, and on the sixth dp- al! the
food saved was put on the Belvedere,
the sleds making one round trip each
day with small loads.
The natives wanted provision* for
their work, but we could not spare any,
and paid them in drilling-, needles,
thread and similar articles. I was ab
sent from the ship on this trip nine
days.
On October 3 Captains Mlllard,
Humphreys and Sherman had another
consultation and called for volunteers
to go to Point Barrow and inform Mr.
Charles Brower, superintendent of the
Liebes whaling station, of our situation
and ask him to help us if he possibly
could. Stephen Cottle, our second
mate, and the fourth and fifth mates
of the Freeman volunteered. They had
to go on foot. They made for the main
land and then for the station. They
traveled over sixty-five miles, the trip
being made in three nights and two
days. Mr. Brower received the officers
in a most kindly manner, and went to
work right away to engage all the dog
teams and sleds he could find around
Point Barrow and r'&pe Bmith. He
dispatched Alfred Hopson, his as
sistant, with the teams to the Belve
dere, arriving there October 7. He had
instructed Mr. Hopson to say that all
of us were welcome at his station, and
he was willing to divide the last crust
with us. Mr. Brower has, by his kind
ness, saved the lives of over 300 men.
He has over 100 natives engaged to
work for him. He gave them rifles and
cartridges and Instructed them to
brin in all the game they could find,
but that they must at any rate get
enough meat to support themselves.
Mr. Hopson had six teams with him
and started back to the station, taking
forty men and some provisions. Some
of the men were so sick and feeble they
had to ride back the entire distance,
the trip being made in four days' time.
Mr. Hopson started back for the Belve
dere on October 13, making the trip in
twenty-two hours. Mr. Brower sent by
him a complete inventory of the provis
ions at the station and also the reports
from the four ships that were in the
ice to the eastward, together with the
list of provisions each of these ships
had on hand. An inventory of the pro
visions on the Belvedere was taken and
we found that there was not enough
on board to keep the entire crew, pro
viding we did not get out until spring.
Mr. Hopson started back the same
day he arrived, taking with him this
time sixty-four men and sufficient pro
visions to last a few days. Captain
Millard had fitted the Orca men with
all the blankets and clothing possible,
as they had to leave the vessel hur
riedly. The Freeman men had had
more time, and had saved all the oloth
ing and blankets they could carry. I
was successful in getting a dog team
and left the ship October 15 to go to the
station. I made the trip in three days.
Captain Millard was successful in se
curing a good dog team and he came to
Point Barrow with Captains Sherman
and Humphreys to discuss the situation
with Mr. Brower and the officers of the
ships.
At this meeting the inventories were
all completed and the entire amount of
provisions on hand from al! sources as
certained. It was decided that by care
ful use an allowance of two scant meals
per day could be made for the men of
the eight ships, which would last up to
the first dax of July, but the allowance
must be a scant one.
It was also decided at this meeting
to call for a volunteer to go south
not only to carry news, but also to
ask help at the earliest possible op
portunity.
I volunteered to make the trip and
others were willing to go with me,
but after considering the situation
carefully we came to the conclusion
that, providing I failed, one dead
man would be enough.
Captains Millard, Sherman and
Humphreys and Mr. Bowers were giving
me all the encouragement they could,
both by word and deed. Mr. Brower
purchased the dogs. The Indians would
gladly have given a dog for a sack of
flour, but not an ounce of provisions
could be spared. The dogs were pur
chased with trade and cost us over one
hundred dollars each. A sled was made
for me, harness made for the dogs, the
native women made skin clothing and
sleeping bags for myself and the two
Indian runners. These runners would
not accompany me any further than
Point Hope. A mast and sail were also
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
included in the outfit and an American
ensign added to float from the mast
head.
I loaded the sled with provisions to
last us for fifteen days, in which time I
expected to arrive at Point Hope, only
allowing myself the same amount per
day that all the men were setting â
two scant meals a day and frozen fish
for my dogs.
Everything being ready, my Bail put
up and the flag fluttering from the
masthead, we shook hands all around,
received lots of good wishes and en-
couragement, and started on my trip
toward civilization, all hands giving
hearty cheers until I was out of sight.
I left Point Barrow at 12 m. on Oc
tober 22, my first objective point be
ing to get to the Belvedere and get
from her a boat compass, a rifle for
the natives, a rifle and shotgun for my
own use, a parallel ruler, a pair of di
viders, and chart, and a portable stove,
which the blacksmith of the Orca was
making for me.
The first stop was made at the refuge
station, now in charge of Michael
Heeney, who is making an Arctic col
lection of curios for the Smithsonian
Institution. A number of shipwrecked
officers are being sheltered and cared
for by Mr. Heeney. He insisted on
us having a lunch with him, photo
graphed the outfit and off we started.
About a mile farther south we met Dr.
Drigs and his wife.
Our outfit was photographed ajraln,
and the doctor prepared a lot of lini
ment and medicines in case it would
be necessary to use them. They wished
me godspeed on my journey, and that
night we camped at a native village
called Simroe. Left the next morning at
5 o'clock, and reported the ship in time
for supper, the actual traveling time
! from the point being seventeen and a
I half hours.
The morning I left Point Barrow Mr.
j Brow^r had received news from the
j ships to the eastward and had succeed
i ed in getting six dog teams, and it was
his intention to get Dr. Driggs to ac
company him to this fleet, as there
were several that needed the doctor's
| attention. He was also taking back
j with him all the men necessary to
watch the ships.
The steamer? Fearless, Captain
James McKenna, and the steamer
Newport, Captain G. B. Leavett, were
about sixty miles to the eastward, of
the point, five miles off shore and in
heavy ice. The tender Jeannie, Cap
tain P. H. Mason, was about fifteen
| miles still further to the east and
i about the same distance from shore.
| The bark Wanderer was about ninety
â¢ miles west of Herscliel Islands, but
did not learn her exact position.
The general opinion was that the
entire fleet would be either ground to
pieces or else carried away by the
ice, but no lives would be lost.
Our tent having been made and ev
erything finished, I left the Belvedere
on the morning of October 26, being
cheered by my shipmates as far as I
could hear them, and that night camp
ed at Point Belcher.
We made an early start the next day
and that night camped at Wainwright
Inlet, and on the night of the 28th
camped at Icy Cape. As the wind was
blowing a hurricane from the southeast
we remained in camp all day, but man
aged to get an early start on the morn
ing of the 30th.
The heavy wind had blown all the
snow from the shore, and soon after
starting came to water along the shore,
so were compelled to go out on the ice.
At one time we were eight miles from
the beach. It was hard traveling that
day, as the ice was rough and we had
to go over considerable young ice.
We kept trying this ice all the way
with an ax to see if it was strong
enough to sustain our weight. We tried
this once too often and lost the ax, and
I was compelled to cut fuel with my2
snow knife for a while. We got around
the water after a long time, reaching
land just at dark and weiÂ£ glad to
camp.
"We traveled on the edge of the ice
on October 31 and made good progress.
We made about twenty-five miles on
November 1. That night a heavy gale
came on from the northeast, together
with a snow storm, so did not break
camp the next day, but started early
on the 3d. and about 10 a. m. came to a
deserted Indian village.
The natives had no doubt gone off on
a deer hunt. I found an old ax in one
of the shacks which I appropriated,
leaving in its place a couple of boxes of
cartridges, which is the best legal ten
der in that section. We kept traveling
that day until. 5 p. m., when we again
struck open water and had to come
back for over three miles before we
could get back to the beach again,
where we camped.
On November 4, peeing open water,
we started to cross the mountains. We
made nearly fifteen miles that day, but
the next, working from early morning
until late at night, we only made a few
miles, and had to unload the sled sev
eral times and pack the load on our
backs.
On the 6th we saw that the ice floe
had drifted back to the shore, and we
worked our way down the mountain
toward the ice. In places found it
so steep we had to use a rope and
slacken the sled down. We even took
advantage of the head wind by putting
the sail up. so as to keep it back. If
the sled had got the start on us it
would have been dashed to pieces on
the rocks below and our trip would
have been a failure.
We were over eight hours in getting
onto the floe. The ice was very rough
and we did not make over five' miles,
although we traveled as long as we
could see.
Stayed in camp the next day, as the
natives were very tired and I was
afraid the dogs would give out. They
were getting somewhat footsore.
On the Bth we started again, the wind
blowing fresh from the northeast, and
getting stronger and stronger. We made
l' >r shore about sp. m. By this time
the wind had turned into a blizzard.
It was impossible to pitch our tent and
so made a snow house. It was the
first 1 had made and the natives knew
more about it than I did, but we start
ed a hole into the snowbank until we
could work on the inside and kept
on scooping the snow out and until it
was large enough to accommodate our
selves and our eight dogs. Although
the temperature must have been a way
below freezing we felt very comforta
ble and all had a good night's rest.
The wind died away and at 10 a. m.
we commenced our travels again. We
did not stop until nearly midnight.
Our stock of provisions was now
about exhausted. We reached a native
village Just back of Cape Lisburne and
bartered some cartridges, powder and
lead for a small seal, which furnished
the supper and breakfast for our-
Belves and dogs. The natives at this
point will have a hard time this win
ter, as the changeable winds have
in;:'!-- the i< â â¢ bo unsafe that they do
not dare venture out any distance on
It to shoot st-nl, which is about their
only means (if support.
On the morning of the 10th we
broke camp. We had no provisions
left.
We started over the mountains, trav
eling until late, when we pitched our
tent, suffering agonies from hunger.
The next mornis* we worked our way
toward the beach to see if we could get
a seal. The traveling that day was
about the worst we had yet encoun
tered, the ice being; full of hummocks
and jagg< d We even had to fill in
some places with ice so as to run the
Bled over. In other places we had to
unload the sled and pack our outfit for
h short distance around the rocks. We
must have unloaded the sled ten times
that day.
A little before dark we saw a seal
nnd shot him, but he drifted away
from us. We pitched camp, and I
took a chew of tobacco, tightened my
belt up and called it a square meal.
The next morning we found that all
our dogs had left us. After looking
around a little we saw their tracks on
the Ice floe, headed for Point Hope,
which I figured was about twenty-eight
miles from our camp. I slung the sack
of mall over my shoulders, and leaving
th< outfit we started after the dogs. It
being my intention If I did not find

them to keep on until I reached the
point. We had probably gone a mile
when we saw our dogs feasting on the
carcass of a whale which some whaler
had killed and skinned. My natives
were just as much delighted with this
find as my dogs, and they devoured a
large quantity of the putrid meat.
Hungry as I was this carcass was too
gamey for me.
After the Indians had eaten all they
wanted we took our dogs back to camp,
harnessed them, came back to the car
cass, cut off sufficient meat to last the
dogs several days and proceeded on our
trip.
A little distance from the whale we
came upon a flock of ducks.
I manage", by crawling over the ice
carefully, to get near enough to kill
three of them and my native killed
four, but we only succeeded in landing
one and had to fish a long time before
we secured this one. A fire was built,
the duck skinned and boiled in salt
water. I ate the entire duck.
We started again, but the road was
terrific, and we had to unload the sled
twice that afternoon. A heavy wind
came up about 4 p. m., with snow
squalls, but we kept on, traveling close
to the bank until it got so dark we
could not see. This was about 7 p. m.
It began clearing off, and the indica
tions all pointed to a pleasant night,
THE SAN FR Ay CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 1898.
but at midnight we were awakened by
our tent falling on us. We wriggled
out the best we could and got into our
skin clothing behind a snow bank. It
was the hardest blizzard we had yet
struck. We dug a hole in the snow
bank large enough to get our sleeping
bags stretched out, pulled some of the
dogs in and managed to keep warm the
balance of the night.
As Point Hope was only twenty
miles away from us, and as we had
nothing to eat, I slung the mail sack
over my shoulder, took my natives and
started for the point. The wind blew
in squalls and so heavy at times that
we had to lie down until it would sub
side somewhat, when we would march
on.
"We succeeded in reaching Point Hope
in about twelve hours, stopping at the
first house we came to, which we found
to be that of a Mr. Anderson, who is
engaged in shore whaling. He cooked
a meal for both the natives and my
self and gave us a change of skin
clothing.
I found that my natives had their
cheeks and ears frozen pretty badl^
and I had one toe and both ears
frozen.
The blizzard kept up without inter
mission for four days. When it abated
I hired a couple of natives to assist me

in getting my sled and camp utensils,
also my dogs, to Point Hope. My two
natives were suffering too much from
frost bite and were too feeble to be of
any assistance.
I reached my old camp that after
noon, and found all the dogs except
ing one. We slept in the snow house
and started back to the point the next
morning. Found in packing that the
tent was blown to tatters, the ridge
pole broken and the stove badly smash
ed. I was obliged to ride all the way
in, as my frozen toe pained me intense
ly. On our road back we found the
body of the lost dog. It had been
blown off the bluff, falling on the ice
below, an almost perpendicular height
of fifty feet.
Mr. Brower had given me letters of
introduction to Captain Nelson, the su
perintendent of Leibes' Point Hope
whaling station, and I kept on to this
place, which is about three miles .south
of Anderson's.
As the natives I had from Point Bar
row would now leave me Captain Nel
son advised me to take Tickey and
Cannuanwar, man and wife. They were
both good runners and he assured me
they would prove faithful to me. My
tent was repaired, new skin clothing
and boots made for both the natives
and myself, a new stove and plenty of
provisions given me and Captain Nel
son got three good dogs for me from
the natives. I stayed with Captain Nel
son for nine days, aa my foot gave me
a great deal of trouble. I left finally
on the morning of the 29th of Novem
ber.
I traveled that day as far as Captain
Peter Bayne's station. He was very
kind to me and I stopped with him that
*ght, sending Tickey back for some
little things I had forgotten at Point
Hope.
The next morning I found that one
of my dogs had run away, so Captain
Bayne let me have one of his to re
place it. We made about twelve miles
that day, it bein* pretty hard travel
ing. We succeeded in getting around
Cape Thompson, but were* afraid the
dogs and sled would break through the
ice, as it was very soft and full of
holes.
On November 30 we broke camp at
5 a. m., the wind blowing from the
southeast and a wet, heavy snow beat
ing us in the face. The Indians and
dogs were soon almost exhausted.
On December 1 we got under way
early, but the ice was so full of ponds
and lagoons that we traveled in about
every point of the compass. About 2
o'clock that afternoon we reached a
small hillock and found it impossible
to either get ahead or go back, as we
were surrounded with water. There was
no fuel on this hillock and we were
compelled to stay there three days, liv
ing on canned meats and frozen fish
that had been purchased for dog food.
The water fell away so that we were
enabled to continue our trip on Decem
ber 5, making about fifteen miles, and
on the 6th we reached Charles Kling
berg's whaling station. We stayed at
his place all night. We left the station
on the Tth, arriving at Cape Blossom
on December 13. We made poor time.
The ice was soft and the temperatnre
too warm for the dogs to travel on. I
had nine dogs left when we reached
Cape Blossom.
Mr. and Mrs. Samms gave me a most
cordial welcome, and Mrs. Samms'com
panion, a Miss Hannahcult, ,waa also
very kind.' She was teaching school at
the cape. Mrs. Samms busied herself
in cooking a quantity of provisions for
us. During my stay at Mrs. Samms' I
procured a sled and several dogs from
the natives, and was now in a position
to carry more food for both ourselves
and our dogs. I also got enough fish
for the dcgs to last me to the Buck
land River.
We left on the 18th and had good
weather. Also made good time on the
19th. On the 20th we had -mother bliz
zard, and remained in camp all day.
We went about twenty miles on the
21st, and the next four days we aver
aged over twenty miles, reaching the
mouth of the Buckland River on
Christmas night.
There we camped and . had our
Christmas dinner, which consisted of
pork and beans, fried frozen fish,
fried bacon, fresh bread and' a tin ot
preserved California grapes. I had
coffee for my use, the Indians pre
ferring tea. I bartered that night
with some natives for more dog feed.
The next day we traveled up the
Buckland River, making- thirty miles,
and then traveled over the por
tage by compass in the direction which
I thought would bring me to Edgituck
River, leaving the Buckland at 3 a. m.
and reaching the Edgituck at 10 p. m.,
where we pitched our camp. My inten
tion on the 29th was to work along the
Egituck and make Norton Sound, but
found the snow very deep and the river
so crooked that we made direct across
the country, steering again by com
pass and crossing the Egituck four
times. "We reached Norton Sound that
night at 7 o'clock.
Soon after starting on the morning
of December 30 we ran across the
tracks of a dog which came from the
direction of Golivan Bay. We followed
these tracks for three days, traveling
as fast as we could and reached Una
laklik on the evening of January 1,
1898.
I was very warmly welcomed by Mr.
and Mrs. Karlson and Miss Johnson.
They have charge of the Swedish mis
sion. Mr. Karlson informed me that
he understood there was to be a mail
sent from St. Michael for the States
January 5, so of course was very
anxious to get there before it left.
We left the mission early the next
morning in a blinding snowstorm, Mr.
Karlson lending me a native to act as
runner and guide.
On the 3d we started early and had
traveled probably five miles when I
missed Tickey's wife. On making in
quiries as to her whereabouts I learned
that she left her pipe at the mission
and had gone back to get it.
I felt rather vexed about the matter,
but still did not lose any time. We
kept on the ice, although it was rather
rough, when we came to a headland
where we found water and so were
compelled to make our way over the
mountain.
After reaching the summit I looked
back to see if Tickey's wife was com
ing, when I saw two men running
toward me, waving their hats and
coats. I waited to see what they
wanted, my impression being that
some accident hud happened to Tickey's
wife.
The men reached me at last and
to my great surprise informed me
that Lieutenant Jarvis and Dr. Call
of the Bear had crossed on the moun
tains above me and requested me to
turn back to meet them.
I went back on foot and after walk-
Ing a couple of miles saw Lieutenant
Jarvis and Dr. Call walking toward me.
I walked back with the officers to get
a good camping place, so that we could
have a consultation relative to the
SEVEN SEAMEN
RESCUED FROM
THE NAVARCH
Two Refuse to Leave the Hull
and Are Adrift In Arctic
Waters
The fate of only two of the wrecked Navarch's crew is now in doubt.
Seven of the nine men who refused to leave the vessel when Captain
Whitesides and his wife and tl.eir six companions left the wrecked
whaler have been rescued. They are: Thomas Lord, fireman; T. Col
lins, M. Hurley, R. Bergman, J. Brem, O. Petersen, seamen; and cabin
boy F. Guttner. The two who remained by the vessel are Frank
Slater and John Hanna. When the whaler with these two men on
board was last seen it was drifting northwest from Point Barrow
into the unknown Arctic seas.
The Navarch was caught in the ice west of Point Barrow on July
29 last. On August 11 twenty-nine of the crew deserted the vessel to
make for the shore. For eleven days they wandered about on the ice,
and when help was found only sixteen of the twenty-nine were alive.
On August 14 Captain Whitesides and his wife and six of the crew left
the vessel, dragging a small canvas canoe with them. They succeeded
in reaching the shore, and three days later they were picked up by the
revenue cutter Bear. Nine of the vessel's crew refused to leave the
whaler, deeming it safer to remain on board than to risk the journey
over the ice. Whalers here were of the opinion that the fate c-f those
nine hardy sailors would forever remain in doubt. It was never ex
pected that they would ever be heard of again. Now it is known that
seven of them have been taken from the vessel, and only two remain
with the ice-nipped whaler on her journey with the currents toward
the unknown regions of the north pole. The ship is supplied with pro
visions and fuel, and should she withstand the ice it is not among the
impossibilities that the two men may solve the mysteries of the unex
plored regions of the Arctic and that they may yet be heard from.
PORTLAND, Or., April B.â George F. Tilton, the third officer of
the whaler Belvedere, who recently reached civilization after an across
country journey from the fleet icebound in the Arctic, brings the in
formation that seven of the nine men who refused to leave the wrecked
whaler Navarch have been rescued. Mr. Tilton is the bearer of the
following official report from Chaises D. Brower, manager of the Liebes
station at Point Barrow:
"The Navarch was caught in the ice on July 29, in the evening,
about two miles off shore and carried by the pack to the northwest.
On August 3 it was abandoned for the first time at 9 a. m., the crew
taking three boats, which were dragged for three days and then left
with everything except a little bread, of which each man carried his
share. It rained all the time. We were within three miles of water
when we turned back, and about eighteen miles from the ship which
bore west by south. We had traveled southeast all the time. We
reached the ship on the morning of the Bth, some stragglers being un
til afternoon getting in.
"The vessel was abandoned for the second time on August 11 off
Cape Smythe, where we reached the water edge at 9p. m. The Bear
was lying at anchor five miles off and did not see us, as It was get
ting dusky and the fog was setting in. We drifted past the William
Bailey and she did not see us. We drifted on the northeast of Point
Barrow. After abandoning the ship Captain Whitesides came two
thirds of the way and then turned back with the compass, and after
the fog shut in we had no way of returning to the ship.
"The second day from the ship the steward, Walter Whiting, died,
and on the fourth day Chief Engineer Sands went insane and could
not walk. The same day we also lost one fireman and four sailors,
whose names are unknown to me. On the 7th day we lost Mr. Scan
lan, second engineer, who got separated from us in the broken ice and
we could not get him; he was probably drowned. The same day we
lost the blacksmith, one Portuguese sailor and two other men. On
the eighth day we also lost another man named Jackson.
"On the evening of the eighth day from the ship, the 19th of Aug
ust, A\e came to the edge of the pack and all got on a small cake of
ice, wind northwest, and drifted In shore for three days. On the
morning of the 20th we lost the last man, who drifted away from us
on a small cake of ice, and we never saw him again.
"For eight days I had nothing to eat but* ice and boot soles. I was
picked up by the steamer Thresher at 4 p. m. on August 22, and was
taken to Point Barrow.
"The steamers Newport and Fearless reported a ship in the ice
twenty miles off shore October 2. and supposed her to be the Navarch.
On October 6 Mr. Gordon and some natives started out to her and suc
ceeded in reaching her, where he found the nine men who had stayed
in the ship all right. He succeeded in getting seven of them ashore
and the other two would not leave. While Mr. Gordon was out for
the men the wind came southwest and the ice broke between them
and shore, and they had a job getting ashore.
"The Navarch was last seen drifting northwest in the pack and is
now out of sight. The two men who are left in the ship are Frank
Slater and a seaman, who was cook in the Karluk at Herschel Island
when she wintered there. The seaman's name is unknown."
whalers and their condition.
After walking a couple of miles we
found a suitable spot for the camp, Dr.
Call getting the dinner ready and Lieu
tenant Jarvis and myself conversing.
It was a very fortunate thing for me
that Mrs. Tickey lost her pipe, as I
should not have met these officers but
for that circumstance.
Lieutenant Jarvis recognized the wo
man, while she was running back to
rejoin us after finding her pipe, and
stopped her, asking what she was do
ing in this part of the country. He
knew she was from Point Hope. She
managed to make him understand that
she had come down with a white man
from the whalers.and Jarvis dispatched
his runners after me.
Jarvis gave me several letters of in
troduction and one especially to Col
onel G. M. Randall, commanding at
Fort St. Michael, and advised me that
from now on I put myself in the hands
of the Government until I reached S?n
Francisco. He also said that I would
in all probability be the mail carrier,
and for me not to hurry, as both my
natives and my dogs were tired.
We then parted, he to go to the
bleak, dark and frozen north and I to
go to the land of sunshine and flowers.
We remained in camp all that day.
We traveled easily the next three days,
reaching Fort St. Michael on the even
ing of the 6th. I presented my cre
dentials to Colonel Randall.
I had expected to leave St. Michael on
January 10, but Cannuanwar caught a
severe dose of the grip, which, I un
derstand, is very prevalent in that re
gion this winter, and so was delayed
until she had sufficiently recovered- for
her to continue the journey.
St. Michael is a good place for the
workingmen and mechanics this win
ter.. The North American Trading
Company is building a new wharf and
new warehouses and putting the finish
ing touches on a new hotel that would
accommodate 200 guests. It is also put
tins In a new training wall so as to
have more wharf room. The Alaska
Commercial Company is busy building

Just One Course by Which

NEW YORK. April B.â The
Herald's Washington corre
ent telegraphs: Only the
improbable and unexpected be
tween now and Monday can
avert war. This is the unani
mous conclusion of the President
and his official advisers as a re
sult of to day's Cabinet meeting.
during which all phases of the
Cu!>an question were discussed
-very conceivable stand
point.
I have talked with nearly all the mem
berÂ« of the Cabinet, with most of the
gressional callers at the White
House to-day, and with members of the
diplomatic corps. Not one of these can
see a peaceful outcome. In summing
up the situation to-night I prefer to
use the words of one of the most ex
perienced diplomats at Washington,
who. in order that he may keep his
country advised of the true situation.
makes it his business to be in close
touch with all the authorises here and
with all international events. He is one
of the keenest observers in the diplo
matic corps and broad and liberal in
his views. This is his verdict after re
viewing even' phase of the subject and
all of the developments of the week in
Washington, Madrid and Havana:
"There seems to be no escape from
war.
' C> tie tt Monday night the telegraph
wires and cables will be flashing mes
signed by General Miles moving
troops to points of concentration al
ready agreed upon ; others signed by the
Secretary of the Navy dispatching war
vessels in all parts of the wo/ld to
Points of vantage for the purpose of
getting ready for the inevitable.
"Your Congress by that time will
have acted upon the President's recom
mendation for imn: 'iate intervention.
There are signs now ot a difference
between certain factions in Congress
and the President regarding the ques
tion of the recognition of the indepen
dence of Cuba. All of this will disap
pear when the President's message is
made public.
"Members of the Foreign Relations
committees are already familiar with the
President's recommendations, and a
resolution embodying his views will be
agreed upon by the two committees
even before the message has been re
ceived. They will be reported imme
diately, and the probabilities are that
they will be passed the same day. At
any rate I venture to predict that there
will not be twenty-four hours' delay in
final action by Congress after the Presi
dent has submitted his message. There
are differences now, but they will be
eliminated, and all branches of the Gov
ernment will present a united front on
the one great question â the ending of
Spanish misrule in Cuba.
"In my opinion it is no longer a
question, 'Will there be warP It is a
question as to how long it will last.
"The action of the President and
Congress will not be a formal declara
tion of war. It will be a declaration for
armed intervention, which, when put
into effect, means war. Naval officers
predict that it will be all over in two
weeks. It is idle to prognosticate on
this point. After it begins no living
being can tell what will happen. In
studying the international aspect of the
situation I cannot see that it is possible
for Spain to withdraw her troops and
flag from Cuba until forced to do so.
"There is a feeling that the six
powers, which combined for the pur
pose of soliciting the reopening of
negotiations between Spain and the
United States, now that they have
not met with any encouragement
from this side, will force Spain to
yield, and that after all there may
be a peaceful solution. But Spain
has not yet shown any signs of
yielding. On the contrary, every
thing looks as dark and gloomy on
the other side as it does here.
"Spain will make a good stroke in
diplomacy by publicly announcing her
determination to accept the offices of
the powers in the interest of peace and
to proclaim in favor of an armistice,
agreeing to a plebiscite to determine the
future government of the island, pro
vided that the United States will agree
to withdraw her vessels from Key West
at the same time she is withdrawing her
troups. This would place her in a
good position in the eyes of the nations
of the world, as it would be equivalent
to yielding to the powers every point
which the President will make in his
message as reasons for intervention
force and to end the war.
"According to the President's posi
tion, as is now well known, the sole ob
: ject of the United States is to Out an
end to the horrible conditions in Cuba.
| to re-establish peace and order and to
j recognize any stable form of govern
â  ment when organized. In short, his
| plan is to stop the war and maintain
1 order until the people of the island can
: decide for themselves what form of gov
ernment they want. By taking the po
sition indicated in the note to the
powers, or by formal proclamation.
Spain would show that she was ready
; to do herself just what the United States
jis attempting to force her to do. But
', Spain has not up to this time shown
that she would make any concessions
which by any possibility would mean
the hauling down of her flag even at a
remote date.
"Assuming that she would go that far.
it would not be satisfactory to the
United States, as under no circum
stances would the President consent to
a withdrawal of warships, nor would
public sentiment in this country permit
him to enter into any new negotiations
which did not mean immediate inde
pendence and satisfactory reparation for
the Maine disaster.
"Hence, any way you look at it, I
do not see how diplomacy can avert
the forcible intervention which the
President has definitely determined
upon."
President McKinley received few
callers outside of members of his Cabi
net to-day. Senators, .Representatives
and office-seekers seemed to realize that
the President wanted this day for rest
and relaxation.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts
; called and had a long consultation
with the President. When he left
the White House he informed me
that the President's mind is fully
; made up to send his message to Con
i gress next Monday.
"Nothing short of a complete with
drawal of the Spanish forces from the
island of Cuba will satisfy the American
people," said Senator Lodge, "and the
President fully realizes that fact. There
is no disposition on his part to further
delay this matter, and it will be a great
relief to him and also to the country
when the subject is finally presented to
Congress on Monday."
The time has passed for the "peace
at-any-price" party to have any effect on
the President. He has passed beyond
the realm of indecision and procrastina
tion, and has been carried along by the
tide of popular sentiment aroused by
the destruction of the Maine until he is
far beyond the reach of domestic or for
eign peace commissioners. As one of
his closest advisers remarked to-day.
"The President could not retrace his
steps if he would, and would not take
a backward step if he could. Having
fully made up his mind to face the in
evitable, he calmly but confidently
awaits the crisis which must come with
the delivery of his message to Con
gress."
Brief and uneventful was the Cabinet
meeting. During the hour and a half
the President and his advisers sat
around the table the situation as above
indicated was freely commented upon.
There is no longer any division of
opinion among Cabinet officers as to the
inevitable result. Talks with the Presi
dent's official family show that they re
alize that the President has exhausted
everything that honorable diplomacy
might suggest to bring about a peaceful
solution of the difficulty.
It is the unanimous verdict of the
1 Cabinet that Spain must relinquish
j her claim to Cuba or suffer the con
i sequences of war.
It is said by a member of the Cabinet
that no official information has been re
ceived from Madrid to-day, and the
only foreign dispatch presented to the
Cabinet was a message from Consul-
General Lee at Havana stating that he
would be prepared to take his departure
for Key West to-morrow. He also
stated in his dispatch that he had made
provision for all American citizens to
leave Cuba.
After the Cabinet left the White
House Lieutenant-General Schofield.

view with the President. He again as

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 1898.
AMERICANS FLEE FROM THE
ISLAND OF PORTO RICO
United States Consul Hanna and Members of the
Colony Seek Safety at St. Thomas After
Spending a Night on a British Ship.
ST. THOMAS, April 8. â So serious has the situation become in San Juan de Porto Rico that
the United States Consul there, P. C. Hanna, has been ordered to this island, where the rule
of Denmark will insure his safety. Fearing an outbreak against foreigners, and particularly
against Americans, Consul Hanna and all members of the American colony spent the night on
board the British steamer Virginius. They did not dare to remain in their homes, not knowing
what direction the fury of the inflamed populace might take.
Military rule, which always prevails in Porto Rico, has now become most stringent. The
Censor will not pass any news, and I am forced to use special boats to this island to file my dis
patches of March 30, in which I stated that all but two of the Autonomist Cabinet had resigned
and the people have become more turbulent. Even with the greatest efforts the police and
troops have not been able to prevent bloodshed. Weylerism is blamed for the failure of au
tonomy and the troubles following. The elections are known to have been falsified, the military
forces taking possession of polling booths to insure the success of their candidates. The indig
nation of the people at what the Government forcibly imposed on them is beyond bounds.
The number of persons in prisons throughout the island has been increased fifty percent.
There have been riots and bloodshed in the principal towns, Ponce, Aquadilla, Cayey and
Vegabayor. The arrival of the torpeJo fleet from Spain, it is believed, would cause an upris
ing against both Americans and British if they had not all gotten safely away from the island
before that time.
TORPEDO FLEET
READY FOR SEA.
ST. VINCENT, Cape Verde Is
lands, April B.â The Spanish tor
pedo fleet is making hurried
preparations for sea. Each one
of the torpedo-boats and destroy
ers has been coaled to its full
capacity. The torpedo-boats car
ry from eighteen to twenty-five
tons and the destroyers 100 tons
each.
Six hundred and ten tons of
coal was to-day placed on board
the flotilla and Its convoy, the
Ciudad de Cadiz. The crews are
in good condition and are very
enthusiastic. In addition to what
is carried in the bunkers, coal
Is stored In bags, and securely
lashed in such deck and hold
spaces as each ship affords.

the fleet, is momentarily expect

of international law bearing upon the
situation. It was shown that the posi
tion taken by the President to insist
that Spanish misrule in Cuba must
cease was impregnable from a legal and
patriotic standpoint, and any further
overtures for a peaceful settlement of
the difficulty must come from Spain.
After leaving the White House Senator
Spooner said:
"I see but one chance for an adjust
ment of this controversy on a peaceful
basis, and that is for the Queen-Regent
to take the responsibility for relinquish
ing the Spanish control of Cuba. In
my judgment, if the Queen Regent is
guaranteed the support of the foreign
powers in maintaining her dynasty she
may see her way clear to disregard the
war sentiment of her own subjects in the
interests of peace instead of having re
course to law. which may not only re
sult in the loss of Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippine Islands, but in the ulti
mate downfall of the Spanish crown.
"Of course her action will have to be
sanctioned by the Cortes, but with the
guaranteed support of the powers of
Europe in maintaining her dynasty she
can afford to take the responsibility of
anticipating the action of the Cortes by
a provisional understanding with the
powers. It is fair to assume that such
action as she might take to preserve the
crown which she holds in trust for her
son, young Alfonso, would under the
circumstances be indorsed by the
Cortes. After having studied the situa
tion with great deliberation, I am frank
to confess I sec no other way of avoid
ing hostilities. The President has taken
a position "which meets the approval
of the American people, and he can
not â and in my judgment will not â re
cede from it."
Notwithstanding the mental and phy
sical strain through which the President
has passed, he looked the picture of per
fect health. He has good color, his step
is firm and he smiled pleasantly and
saluted acquaintances, V/ho raised their
hats as he started for a drive with Vice-
President Hobart this afternoon.
ANCHORED IN POTOMAC
BELOW WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, April B.â The Italian
cruiser Amerigo Vespucci is anchored
in the Potomac, a few miles down thÂ«
river below Washington. She 1b a ca
det school ship, and is understood to
be on a practice cruise. She draw*
about 1" feet of water.
There was considerable gossip in na
visit of this foreign vessel to this city
unconfirmed gossip that the presence
of the vessel at this time was for the
purpose of using her as an asylum for
the Spanish Minister and his staff in
case it was found impracticable for
them to leave the country by the or
dinary means of travel.
Senor Polo, the Spanish Minister,
when his attention was called to the
rumor that the Vespucci might be here
to take him away from the country,
characterized it as absurd and without
basis of fact.
Big Guns Along the Columbia.
ASTORIA, Or., April B.â The new 10

will be rushed at Scarborough Head on
the Washington shore of the Columbia
River, and when the guns there are in
position the defenses at the Columbia'^
mouth will be practically complete.

SECRET OF THE
DE LOME LETTER
Representatives of the
Cuban Junta Given
Secret History.
Quesada Tells of the Status
of the Little Island
Republic.
The Deputy Treasurer Also Gives
Information as to Bonds and the
Securing of the De Lome Letter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rises House,
( Washington, April 8.
The Foreign Affairs Committee of the
House met at 11 o'clock this morning
and continued the examination of Mr.
Quesada, the representative of the Cu
ban republic in this city. President
Palma of the Cuban Junta was
also present. Mr. Quesada continued
his statement as to the status of the
of the republic.
Some very interesting facts came out
to-day. The deputy treasurer of the
Cuban republic appeared with his
books, and they were inspected by the
committee. He explained that of the
$10,000,000 of bonds authorized only
$122,000 had been actually disposed of.
Some of these were In payment for
provisions sent to Cuba.
For some of the bonds par had
been obtained. These were taken main
ly by the friends of Cuba. The lowest
price at which any were sold was 25
cents on the dollar.. A batch of $20,000
was sold for $5000 in a pressing emer
gency. One million of the bonds, he
said, were locked up in the safe of Bel
mont & Co. of New York, to be sold
when the fixed price, 45 cents on the
dollar, had been obtained. Three mil
lions of the remainder had been signed,
but were locked up in the treasurer's
vaults.
The deputy treasurer was asked if he
knew the story of the publication of the
De Lome letter, and, without names,
he gave the first authentic statement
of how it was obtained.
He explained that it was abstracted
by a clerk in the Postofnce in Havana,
who was in sympathy with the Cuban
cause, and sent back to New
York. There its importance was at
once realized, and it was given out for
publication, the action being Justified
because it showed conclusively what
the Cubans always contended, that
Spain was guilty of double-dealing.
Mr. Quesada then continued his
statement about the status of the Cu
ban Government. He went extensively
into the authority exercised by it over
the eastern provinces, where, he said,
all was comparatively peaceful. In
dustry was going on, war taxes were
being collected and all the functions
of government were being discharged.
With regard to the capability of self
government of the Cubans, he said that
they were a much higher class of peo
ple than those who had successfully
revolted from Spanish domination in
South America.

Uncle Sam Needs the Money.
NEW YORK, April B.â The New York
banks Avhich acted as depositories for
the Union Pacific purchase money for
the Government received word from
the Treasury Department to-day that
the balance of the Union Pacific
moneys now in keeping of these
banks would have to be paid in with
the least possible delay. The original
amount was $52,000,000, and the balance
due to the Government amounts to
about $12,000,000.

OLD POINT COMFORT, Va.,
April B.â Orders have been given
by Commodore Schley to the
commanders of the ships of the
flying squadron to be in readiness
to get under way on Monday
night. As matters now stand
the squadron officers expect to
move toward the scenes of ac

Men in the Pay of Spain
Are Seeking Infor

Two Foreigners Observed
Making Sketches at the

Information Is Also Being Collected
in Reference to Ships and
Forts on the Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April B.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald says:
Spanish spies ar sharply watching the
developments of the American navy,
besides keeping an inquisitive eye on
the work of fortifying the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts. Two foreigners re
sembling Spaniards were observed yes
terday afternoon in the yard of the
Bath Iron Works making sketches of
the uncompleted torpedo boats T. A. M.
Craven and Dahlgren, which are under
construction there.
Information respecting the action of
the foreigners was received at the
Navy Department to-day in a dispatch
from Naval Constructor J. F. Hans
corn, who is superintendent of con
struction of these boats. Mr. Hanscom
stated that the men acted very sus
piciously. Unfortunately the sketches
were completed and the men had left
the yard before the matter was called
to the constructor's attention. Hans
com informed the department that the
Bath Iron Works had promised to ex
clude all suspicious characters in the
future.
The authorities have no doubt that
Spanish representatives are at work on
the coasts of the United States collect
ing information and forwarding it to
their Government. The report reached
Washington some days ago that Col
onel R. T. Frank, commanding the gar
rison at Fort Monroe t had caught a
man endeavorine: to secure informa
tion, but as there was no law allowing
his apprehension in time of peace he
was compelled to turn him loose. Be
ginning with next week there is rea
son to believe the authorities will de
cline to make public any information
respecting the destination of vessels,
even their departure from a port at
which they may have been stationed.

11ADRID, April 8. â Last
night, after a Cabinet Council
in which the important decis
ion was arrived at to accept
the advice of the Pope, a Min
ister who had been present
said he thought we are nearer
peace than we have ever been
since the troubles began.
Early this morning Minis
ter Woodford, who was in a
hopeful mood such as has not
been his for some time, said
to a friend that everything
seems to be going the right
way for peace.
Both press and public sen
timent have changed from the
pessimism of yesterday to
eager optimism and the peo
ple seize at the idea that peace
may be maintained by the
dual efforts of the Pope and
the powers.
NEW YORK, April B.â The Wash- j
ington correspondent of the Herald ;
telegraphs: Spain has indicated her I
desire not to engage in war with the i
United States by agreeing, it is un- |
derstood, to the armistice suggested j
by the Pope and advocated by France, ;
Italy and Austria.
This information was officially re
ceived here to-night. It is the ex
pectation that the Queen Regent will
issue a decree to-morrow formally
proclaiming that an armistice has
been granted. It will then be nec
essary for the representatives of
Spain to confer with General Gomez,
Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban
insurgents, to learn whether he is
willing to accept the armistice. It is
said that the Pope will extend his in
fluence to the Cubans, with a view
to getting them to accept the armis
tice offered by Spain.
Regarding the proposed action of
the Spanish Cabinet, a diplomat thor
oughly informed as to the negotia
tions leading up to the armistice,
said to me to-night: "I think you
will find to-morrow that the action of
the Spanish Ministry was due to the
withdrawal by Minister Woodford of
the offensive note he sent to the Sa
gasta Ministry yesterday. This note
stated that he had been waiting for
an answer to his representations, and
that he would like to receive a reply
before midnight of last night. This
was an ultimatum.
"At the time it was received the
Spanish Cabinet was considering the
proposition regarding the proclama
tion of an armistice. The first propo
sition of the Pope which was made
to Spain and to the United States
suggested that Spain issue an armis-
tice on the consideration that the
American fleet be withdrawn from
Key West.
'â¢The American Government would
not consent to this action and the
Pope, supported by France. Austria
and Italy, then urged the Queen Be
gent and the Sagasta Ministry to
grant an armistice without any such
concession from the United States.
The Cabinet was considering the
proposition yesterday and would
have acted upon it favorably at the
time had not Minister Woodford
written his unfortunate note. Dur
ing the day the representatives of
the Vatican, the French Ambassador
and the representatives of the other
powers have been negotiating with
the Cabinet and with Minister Wood
ford, and, as I have said, I will not

be surprised to learn that the armis
tice is the result.
"Spain, having given this conces
sion in the interest of peace, her ac
tion will mean that the whole ques
tion will return to the diplomatic
phase, provided President McKinley
is willing to so allow it. It is un
fortunate that the armistice was not
granted with the representation of
the powers yesterday, for the two
coming together would undoubtedly
| have had a greater effect from the
j peace standpoint than they will have
j coming thirty hours apart.
"To my mind the negotiations,
which I hope will be resumed by the
formal transmission of the an-
nouncement of the issuance of the
armistice to Minister Woodford by
Senor Gullon, will then deal with the
charter of (government to be given
to Cuba, so that the peace and order
which President McKinley yesterday
informed the powers be desired
should prevail in Cuba can bo re
stored as soon as possible.
"Following the granting of the
armistice, the reconcentrados will un
doubtedly be released and the United
States, to insure their safety and to
aid in the restoration of order in the
island, should withdraw its moral
support from the insurgents and
show them that it has no intention
of intervening. It is recognized that
the attitude of the United States is
the one hope of the Cubans, and
should its attitude change, then their
hope is gone."
Whether the proposed armistice
j will be satisfactory to the President
j and his advisers is another matter.
| Much depends upon the details of
â  the Queen's decree. It is a matter
| that will have to be considered by the
! President and his Cabinet when all
I the facts are known.
From the way the authorities talked
to-day nothing short of a complete
compliance with the President's de
mands for independence for the peo
ple of Cuba from the Spanish do
minion would prevent President Mc-
Kinley sending his message to Congress
on Monday.
It is understood here that the
proposition does not contemplate the
removal of the Spanish flag, but the
granting of autonomy to Cuba such
as is enjoyed by Australia or Canada.
It is expected that the powers,
which, through their representatives
in Madrid, made a presentation to
Spain similar to that made to the
President, will bring influence to
bear upon the administration to ac
cept the armistice proposition by
Spain, or at least to reopen negotia
tions having as their object some
agreement.
SPEAKER REED
IN FAVOR OF PEACE.
Sends a Letter to the Massachusetts
Beform Club in Which He Op
poses Intervention in Cuba.
BOSTON, Mass., April B.â At a meet-
Ing of the Massachusetts Reform Club
this evening a letter was read from
Speaker Reed, in which Mr. Reed stat
ed that he was not in favor of the an
nexation of Hawaii, and was also op
posed to the intervention of the United
States In Cuba. The Speaker wrote
that he was for peace and would do all
in his power to have a full and free
discussion in Congress before action
was taken by the House of Represent
atives looking toward war. Mr. Reed
Â£xpressed the strongest hope that the
whole question now before the Presi
dent and Congress might be settled by
peaceful means. He wrote that he
thought war would be avoided.

RESOLUTIONS TO
BE REPORTED
TO BOTH HOUSES
Congress Will Not Make Any
Delay in the Cuban Busi
ness After the Mes
sage Comes In.
NEW YORK, April S.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
There are Indications that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs are coming to an under
standing which will result In identical resolutions being reported to
the two houses of Congress when the President's message has been re
ferred to these committees.
The present understanding is that the reference of the message
will be merely formal. The two committees will meet on Monday
morning, and it is expected they will have their resolutions ready to
report to their respective houses as soon as the message has been re
ceived. No agreement has yet been reached by each committee as to
the exact text of the resolution to be reported, but it is understood
that the joint resolution introduced in the Senate on March =89 by
Senator Frye will be made the basis of the final text.
There. will be incorporated in its preamble a strong reference to the
destruction of the Maine and the slaughter of her officers and men. The
resolution itself will be somewhat strengthened in some places. It can
be definitely stated that there will be no direct* recognition of the
present so-called Republic of Cuba, though there will be an emphatic
declaration of the independence of the people of Cuba from the Span
ish Government.
The present indications are that the provision for forcible inter
vention to secure the withdrawal of the Spanish forces from Cuba will
l><- made somewhat Btronger than In the Prye resolution. The sub
stance of the resolution will be the declaration of the independence of
the Cuban people and the provision for the use of the land and naval
forces Of the United States to compel Spain to evacuate the island.
There is 1.-ss danger of a prolonged debate in each house of Con
greey than there seemed to be some days ago. Should the resolution
be reported according to the present programme, immediately after
the reading of the message, it is probable that it will be adopted in
the House before adjournment on Monday. Action in the Senate is
not expected to be BO speedy, but the leading mongers of the Com
â  Relations now believe that there will be no serious
attempt to talk, for the mere sake frt delay.
The failure to recognise directly the so-called Republic of Cuba
will provoke considerable opposition In both houses, and an attempt
will doubtless be made to amend the resolution in this respect, though
it is not believed that the advocate of recognition in the Senate will
go s.> :ar as tii embark on the campaign for delay.
The announcement that a Strong Spanish squadron consisting of
battle-Ships, ar:r.or:>d cruisers and the second torpedo fleet has started
from Cadis for this side of the Atlantic will tend to expedite the ac
ts. No considerable number of men in each house will
be willing to take the responsibility for delay when it is realized that
every hour spent in taik enables Spain to get her naval forces in a
better position for the coming struggle.
There is not now believed to be any danger of division among the
Republicans when the time comes to act on the recommendations of
the President. The men in the House who have been considering
breaking away from the restraint of the Speaker and voting with the
Detnoci m try to secure action, now generally believe that
they will not be asked to wait longer than Monday. The committee
of nine appointed at their last conference to consider what course
Should be i let to-day and talked over the situation. It was
agreed that there *ras nothing to be done between now ar.d Monday
c when the committee will hold another meeting to determine
what is to be done. Should anything occcur to lead the President to

This has been a day of religious, civil
anil military celebration. Havana has
always made Good Friday a day of
days, and this year enough military
coloring was given to make the day one
to be long remembered. The proces
sion from and to the cathedral was
marred somewhat by cold rain, but
still thousands participated, about fif
teen hundred troops being in line.
Those in the United States who have
accepted the story that all of Spain's
soldiers belong to the awkward squad
should reform their views. I saw to
day as Una a body of men, on foot or
mounted, as ever passed in review.
They were the pick of the volunteers
to be sure, but they were so well train
ed that they would compare favorably
with New York's proud Seventh. These
men have all been under fire, and will
give a good report of themselves
against any enemy. It should be added
here that while the volunteers have
given the lie to those who have de
clared them to be lawless and blood
thirsty, they are worked up to a pat
riotic fever, which will be hard to re
strain when war becomes a tact.
The inevitable rush to get out of Ha
vana has now become a panic. The
; agents of the Plant Line steamships
have been besieged to-day, and the Ol
ivette could carry twice its legal pas
senger list if it had accommodations.
It will leave Havana at 1 o'clock to

REPORTED BLOWING
UP OF THE FERN
IN HAVANA HARBOR
But the State and Navy Departments
Have Not Received Information of the
Alleged Disaster.
NEW YORK, April 9.â The Herald's Washington special says: There are rumors in circulation here
this morning that the United States lighthouse tender Fern has been blown up at Havana, I have been
unable to verify these rumors. The Fern waa to remain in Havana for the purpose of bringing away Con
sul-General Lee.
Neither the officials of the Navy Department nor the State Department had heard any news of such a
disnster.
At 2 a. m. Secretary Long told me that he had heard nothing about the blowing up of the Fern, and
said that if such a thing had occurred he probably would have heard of it.
The officers of the Fern are Lieutenant-Commander William S. Cowles. Lieutenant Frank E. Sawyer
and Ensigns Wilfred V. Powelson and Charles S. Bookwalter. The Fern is a wooden transport steamer of
S4O tons displacement. She was assigned by the Navy Department in April, 1596, to the North Atlantic
squadron for use as a supply ship. Prior to this time the Fern had b-*en used as a lighthouse tender.
There was a lire on the Fern on the night of March 6. 1895, when she was on her way to Boston from
the League Island navy-yard. Flames were discovered in the cabin directly over the magazine contain
ing 4iu> pounds of smokeless powder, when the' Fern was off Cape Cod. There was a stiff wind blowing and
the Fern seemed doomed. The excellent discipline on board prevented any panic and before the flames
reached the magazine the explosives had all been carried to a place of safety.
The Fern was then headed about and running with the wind into Provincetown harbor, the flames were
subdued after a fierce tight.
The Fern was in collision later when ten miles of Thimble Light on the coast of Virginia, with the
English tramp steamer lago. A hole eleven feet square was torn in the after cabin, and the deck for
twenty feet was crushed. WO damage was done below the water line. The Fern was at that time on the
way from Annapolis with general stores for the northern yards.

Among the Senators seen to-day who
expressed themselves in opposition to
any modincatk-n of the resolution to be

eign Relations were Tharston, Petti

"We carrot," said Senator Mason,

the present Cuban Government of the j
victory which they have so nearly t
won."
"In my opinion a set of men who have
maintained themselves as the Cuban in- ;
surgents have in opposition to the en- i
tire Spanish arms deserve our fullest
indorsement," said Senator Allen, add
ing that he would oppose any effort to
curtail their rights.
Senator Thurston said: "If we should
intervene without recognizing the pres
ent Government of Cuba we should
place the United States In a position of
responsibility to all other powers and
to the citizens of all other countries for
any damage done them in case of war.
This is my interpretation of the inter
national law bearing upon the case, and
I do not believe it can be successfully
controverted. Furthermore. 1 think we
would in that event be held liable for
the payment of interest on the Spanish
bonds, which are secured by the Cuban
revenues. But a greater weight with
me than all these considerations is the
conviction that if we interfere in the
conflict between Spain and the Cubans
without recognizing a present govern
ment in the island we shall witness the
spectacle of the Cubans being com
pelled to make terms with the bond
holders for their recognition after all
the sacrifice they shall have made and
we snail have made for them. This 's
1 the thing that is most repulsive to me
in the proposition to deny the present
Cuban Government its Just dues. I do
not want to see the Cubans compelled
to enter into a dicker to secure their
rights after the Spaniards shall have
been driven out."

The expectation of the State Depart
ment officials is that Consul -General :
Lee will be out of Havana before an- j
other sun sets in that city. This state- i
raent is based on the opinion of Assist- '
ant Secretary Day, who said this aft- '
ernoon that the Consul-General would
leave his post of duty probably to
morrow, on the Olivette.
A dispatch was received at the de
partment late this afternoon from Gen- '
eral Lee. but it was said it related sim
ply to a matter of detail of no gTeat
importance. From the fact that he
made no reference to any disturbance
or ill feeling, the officials take it for
granted that the day in Havana passed
by without anything of moment hap
pening.
By Sunday, at the very latest, it is {
now believed, all the Consular officers
of the United States in Cuba, and all
American citizens who desire to do so,
will have left the cities where they are
located and be either in the United
States or aboard vessels bound thither.
The effects of the Consulates, consist
tag of unimportant papers, furniture,
etc.. will be placed under the charge
of the Consular representatives of the
British Government now in the island.
where they will be kept pending the
developments of the issue between the
United States and Spain.
The important papers of the offices
will be brought to the United State*.
Officials of the State Department, in
discussing the withdrawal of the Con
suls from Cuba at this time, say it pre
sents many phases of interest. They
point out that such withdrawals must
not be considered in any manner a bel
ligerent act, but simply one of precau
tion based on humanitarian motives,
designed to protect them from any
trouble which might result from the
strained feelings between Spain and
this country- In a week, suggested one
official to-day, they may have returned
to their positions, if trouble between
the two countries should be averted.

WITHDRAWAL OF
AMERICANS FROM
PORTS OF CUBA
Consul Hyatt and Other Citizens
of the United States Leave
Santiago on the
Brookline.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, April B.â Thirty-two citizens of the UnitÂ£
States, among them Pulaski F. Hyatt, Consul at Santiago de Cuba, ana
Dr. Canalnero, superintendent of the Marine Hospital in that city, ar
rived this morning at Port Antonio on the Boston Fruit Company s
steamer Brookline, which was sent from here to get them by order of
the State Department in Washington.
Mr. Hyatt and a few of the passengers went ashore at Port Antonio,
and the Consul will come to Kingston to-morrow. The Brookline with
all the other refugees on board sailed for Boston this evening. The ship
was quarantined when she reached Port Antonio and held for several
hours, but the restrictions were finally removed because the authorities
realized the unusual circumstances.
Some of the Brookline's passengers, who went on to Boston, told
me that three Spanish warships were at Santiago when they left yester
day. Mines have been thickly laid in the harbor, they said, and the
Spanish authorities are taking every precaution to prevent the use of
Santiago as a place of landing by hostile troops.
I talked with Mr. Hyatt at Port Antonio, and asked him about his
orders. He told me that he had left his post because of instructions from
Washington. His withdrawal, he said, was not necessarily a prelimi
nary of war. It was in his opinion a step taken to prevent occurrences
that might lead to serious complications. Among the insurgents, he told
me, activity has been greatly increased because it is considered cer
tain that the United States is about to interfere and drive the Spanish
troops off the island. Mr. Hyatt says that in the vicinity of Santiago
the health of the people had been greatly improved since the relief sup
plies had been received from the United States.
Mr. Hyatt will remain here awaiting instructions from the State
Department. Word was received here to-day that the steamer Beverly
had sailed from Cienfuegos for Boston, stopping at Key West on the
way. She has on board Owen McGarr, Consul at Cienfuegos. and near
ly one hundred United States citizens. It is expected that to-morrow
at noon a steamer chartered by the American State Department will
leave here under orders to proceed to the southern coast of Cuba and
take off the United States Consuls and other Americans at four ports.
At the time this dispatch is filed the name of the vessel is not made
public, nor h: ye the destinations been made known.

MADRID, April B.â Senor Sagasta
says the Spanish Government has no
intention of opening further negotia
tions. The Spanish Government to-day
remitted to Rome its full reply to the
Pope's suggestion of an armistice.
General Correro, the Spanish Minis
ter of War. in an interview this morn
ing, said: "Spain must not be alarmed
if war is declared and at the sinking of
Spanish warships. What we must at
all costs avoid is a Spanish warship
striking her colors to the American
flag. She should rather explode her
magazines. 1 wish to God Spain had
not a warship from Cuba to the penin
sula. We could then say to America:
'We are here, meet us when you
please.' "
The Liberal this evening says the
Government has decided to send a note
to the Pope, thanking him for his good
offices and begging him to persevere.
"But," the Liberal adds, "the Gov
ernment does not pledge itself to accept
the Papal decision."
The Heraldo will say: '"Spain re

Publics Accusation That a Certain

Bridal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April B.â No right-mind
ed, intelligent, decent citizen of San
Jose doubts that Boss Rea, Johnnie
Mackenzie and the adherents of these
manipulators of the corrupt political
machine of San Jose are responsible
for the dishonesty and extravagance in
the public offices of this city.
There is no question as to Rea and
Mackenzie being the head center of the
"gang" that has brought upon San
Jose high and excessive taxation, with
all its attendant evils â evils that have
throttled progress and prosperity.
Every man informed on political his
tory in this city, as it has been made
in the past few months, knows that
"Jim" Rea is responsible for the nam
ing of the candidates who appear on
the people's municipal ticket. Every
body endowed with the slightest politi
cal sense knows that every candidate
on that ticket, which has come to be
commonly designated as the "gang"
ticket, will be subservient to the wishes
of "Boss" Rea and Johnnie Mackenzie
if hÂ» is elected, whether it be to the
office "!" Mayor or as a member of the
appointing board. No secret is made
by the boss and his followers of the
fact that they are using every fair and
u'ifrur means known to astute politi
cians to bring about the election of the
men on the "gang" ticket.
With these facts clearly presented to
the people of San Jose they can have
no excuse for voting against their own
interests on next Monday. A vote for
any candidate on the "gang" ticket is
nothing less than a vote for Rea and
Mackenzie and a continuance of their
disreputable methods.
Reform, retrenchment, progress and
prosperity will come only by the elec
tion of men who are positively known
to have no alliance with the "gang"
and who are known to be under no ob
ligation whatever to the boss or any of
his satellites. Such men compose the
ticket of the New Charter Club. Back
of this ticket are the best citizens of
Pan Jose, in all ranks of life. Opposed
to it is the boss and all the vicious in
fluences that usually surround such a
man. Facts and reason are being used
by tho advocates of the New Charter
Club ticket to Becure its success. Fakes,
threats and misrepresentation are being
employed by the 'gang" in behalf of
the people's municipal ticket.
If the people of San Jose want the
highest office in their gift filled by a
man who has the respect of every de
cent man, who is honest, who is free
from any taint of the "gang," who has
n his ability as a business man
by the success he has attained in his
private affairs, who has never before

himself to administer the affairs of the

In conformity to the provisions and

Not less important for the people to
consider than any of the other offices
mentioned is the membership of the
appointing board. If the Mayor, the
Council, the Clerk and the Treasurer
control in a greater or less degree the
patronage, as far as the business of the
city is concerned, the appointing board
will control the patronage as far as it
applies to persons. Nearb- every ap
pointment to a position in the service
of the city will be more or less con
trolled by the members of the appoint
ing board. It i 3 for this reason that
the "gang" has bent every effort to get
at least a majority of the members of
this board.
If the people of San Jose want a fire
and police force made up of capable and
efficient men, selected because of their
qualifications, and not solely because
of their relationship to or friendship
with the appointing power or because
of their "pull" with the "gang"; if they
want to put a stop to scandalous re
ports of positions having been pur
chased on the police force; if they want
to put a stop to politics being done in
the public schools; if they want to de
pose Johnnie Mackenzie as an honorary
member of the Board of Education,
with his power of appointment greater
than all the regular members com
bined; if a qualification for the position
of school teacher is to be in all cases
competency and fitness and not money
or a "pull"; if "Jim" Rea is to be de
prived of the means with which to ful
| fill any of his political promises and
1 his power for evil is to be effectually
' broken, the people must vote for the
! following men as members of the ap
! pointing board: Charles H. Allen,
Lawrence Archer, John E. Auzerais, T.
I Ellard Beans. A. B. Hunter, J. R.
I Lewis, Michael Kenny, William O.
I Alexander. Luis Argues, Calvin H.
I Bailey, J. H. Campbell, .T. T J. Son
theimer, Thomas J. Riley, D. C. Vestal.
Political comment was largely taken
up to-day with the bold assertion by O.
O. Felkner that he had been informed
by a reliable person that one of the
male schoolteachers of San Jose was
paying $12 oO a month as on assessment
for the retention of his position.. With
this broad statement as a basis the
question is asked, Why does not the
Board of Education, which was so
quick to offer a reward of $500 the
other day for information that would
lead to the discovery of bribery in the
school department, take to investigat
ing instead of wagering?
If the Board of Education of San Jose
is really sincere in its desire to discover
and punish corruption in the depart
ment under its jurisdiction, it should, it
is claimed, take example from the
Board of Education of Los Angeles.
Let immunity from punishment be
promised the schoolteacher who has de
clared that he was "held up" and let.
him also be assured of being retained
in his position if he will make known
the name of the person or persons re
sponsible for this piece of corruption.
Let Rea and Mackenzie's Board of
Education institute a sweeping inves
tigation. It has the power to subp*ena
and swear witnesses. In order that the
atmosphere shall be entirely cleared of
the reports of corruption every teacher
and employe of the School Department
should be called before the board in
public session and examined as to any
attempt made by any person to extort
blood money from them. . Unless this
is done by the Board of Education that
body will be viewed with suspicion by
every decent, respectable man and wo
man.
The public accusation made by Mr.
Felkner Is of too serious a nature to be
put over as a mere campaign report.
The people are now demanding that the
probe of truth and honesty be applied,
that corruption, if any exists, be dis
covered and the cqrruptionists pun
ished. " **HÂ«a
Such a condition as is indicated by
the public stand of Mr. Felkner would
not be possible were San Jose not bound
in political slavery by Boss Rea and his
disreputable "gang." With the success
of the New Charter Club ticket on
Monday next will come an end to such
scandals as this and all others of a

i similar character. With honest, re- !
i sponsible and public-spirited men in :
1 control of public affairs place-selling
and p*lace-buying will be unknown.
Each day sees the prospects of vie- j
tory for the New Charter Club ticket |
materially improved. The situation as I
it now exists was well described to-day |
[ by E. E. Crew, the president of the ;
Liberty Club, whose signed interview j
; and appeal to the laboring people ap-
p eared in The Call of to-day. He re
marked:
"It is not a question any longer of
the success of the entire Charter Club j
ticket; it is simply a matter of piling j
up the majorities: We ought to make \
, the majorities for all the candidates so I
large that in the future the promises !
of the boss and his workers will be of 1
no more value in the political world I
than is the note of an almshouse in
mate in the world of finance."
How "Jim" Re does politics has
been well described by the afternoon
"gang" organ, which is certainly qual
ified to speak by the card. It thus tells
how candidates are "reached":
A man in business was elected to office.
He soon found that his business was in
creasing. He was pleased at his increased
prosperity. He found that he was taking
in several hundred dollars a month more
than he had been. He was on Easy street.
He was required to vote so and so ori
some proposition. He declined to do so
He was disciplined. How? The increase
in his trade was taken away from him
All those engaged in "doing" politics were
instructed to stop trading at his store
Word was passed down the line that be
was not "standing in." He found that be
made a mistake; that while consulting
what he considered to be the wishes Âf
the people he had neglected his own in
terests; that he was getting the worst
of it.
This unprincipled organ of an equally
unprincipled "gang" had the effrontery
to moralize on the foregoing in the fol
lowing language:
It is an old saying that the average
man can be reached through his pocket
that the man who puts principle above
pocket in political matters, as they re
late to municipal affairs, will come out
at the little end of the financial horn.
It follows with this damaging admis
sion of the cause of the "gang":
This is a state of affairs that has ex
isted in San Jose for a long time. The
i remedy was the passage of the new char
ter.
All this is but a prelude to booming
the candidacy of Charles J. Martin for
the Mayoralty. The evening "gang '
I organ says, speaking of Martin:
What can the politicians do to him? He
has no business that can be affected; he
has no grocery store or meat market, no
mercantile business to which patronage
could be directed and then removed for
disciplining purposes.
If any one wants to know how Mar
tin can and will be reached if he is by
any accident elected let hi.n obtain an
swers, but truthful ones, to these ques
tions:
Is not Martin a brother-in-law of L.
â¢ Lion, the head of the furniture firm
' that is now getting all of the "gang"
patronage in its line of business?
Are not the Lions among the most
active workers in behalf of the Rea
: ticket?
Did not Johnnie McKenzie, at a con
ference held at Del Monte, persuade
Martin to allow his name to be used at
the head of the "gang" ticket?
Is not Martin, In running for Mayor,
actuated more by what will accrue to
his relatives in the furniture business
than by his personal ambition or the
public welfare?
Will not Martin, in view of all the
facts here set forth, be under the influ
ence and control of the boss?
It is safe to say that none but af
firmative replies will be forthcoming
to each and all of these questions.
Under the circumstances can any
voter who is opposed to the "gang" and
its corrupt and extravagant adminis
tration consistently cast his vote for
C. J. Martin, particularly when there is
presented for his suffrage such an emi
nently fit man for the mayoralty as
Sanford E. Smith?
What is true of Martin Is also true
of J. W. Cook, the "gang" candidate
for City Clerk. Toth men are respect
able enough, but if elected they will
have to dance as the boss whistles. The
difference between these two men is j
that Martin will 'stand in" with the j
boss for the patronage that will go to |
the Lions, while Cook will "stand in" i
pimply for the emoluments of office
that will falls to him. Part of Cook's
obligation to the boss for the latter's
indorsement and support will be the
patronage of the Clerk's office. The
"gang" will be again allowed to name
at least three of the Clerk's five depu
ties, and the Clerk's office will continue
to be as expensive as It has been of
late.
There is only one safe way to avoid
all mistakes and pitfalls in this the
most momentous campaien ever car
ried on in the city of San Joseâ the
Charter Club ticket shouftl be voted
straight. _____^________
GRAIN AND GRASS
IN YOLO COUNTY.
Pasturage and Crops Doing Well and
Fruit Has Suffered but
Little.
WOODLAND, March 8. -^-Thirty-two car
loads of cattle and sheep have arrived in
Capay Valley. They were shipped from
Oceano, San Luis Obispo County, on ac
count of short grass and are the property
of E. Wieman. They will be pastured on
the Pace & Cramer range, near uumda
and Rumsey.
The first estimates of the loss of fruit
in Capay Valley on account of frosts
were no doubt exaggerated. A Call rep
resentative marie a trip through the val
ley this week. The damage has been con
siderable, but not so great as was sus
tained in other portions of the State. In
the northern portion of the valley the
orchards will yield nearly full crops, even
of apricots. In some orchards the worst
that the frost did was to save the owners
the labor of thinning out the fruit on the
trees. In other portions of the valley the
apricots and early peaches have suffered
badly, but there will be good crops of all
other and later fruits, especially prunes.
Nor are the grain crops in the valley suf
fering as in other parts of the county.
With the usual spring showers a large
number of the grain fields will yield
fairly well. Any section tnat can come
out of this exceptionally trying and dis
astrous season with fair crops of either
grain or fruit certainly demonstrates its
superior advantage*.

George Stout Dies From the Effects
of a Blow Delivered by the
Omaha Kid.
COLUMBUS, April B.â George Stout of
Philadelphia, who was knocked out by
Oscar Gardner, the "Omaha Kid," in a
hot fight last night, died from the effects
of the blow this morning. It was in the
twelfth round that the fatal jolt was de
livered, Stout falling heavily and never
regaining' consciousness. He was ordered
taken to the hospital by a physician, but
nothing could be done for him. A post
mortem examination is to be held to de
termine the cause of death. The knock
out blow was a short right swing on tne
jaw.
Gardiner was arrested, but was released
to-night under $700 bonds, pending his pre
liminary hearing. He is much distressed
over Stout's death, and says he will never
fight again. The other men who wore ar
rested after the light were released earl
ier in the day, it being found that they
could not be held on any charge, as the
Mayor had given permits for the fight.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April B.â "Jim" Rea, at
tended by a son of Charles J. Martin,
the "gang" candidate for Mayor, and a
clerk of L. Lion, attended the tent
meeting of the New Charter Club to
night, at the corner of Seventh and San
Salvador streets, and was given an ob
ject lesson in decent politices. The
tent was crowded to its utmost capac
ity, and the boss stood up just back of
the last row of seats. Throughout the
meeting he displayed a state of ner
vous uneasiness which was easily
measured, by those who know his pecu
liarities, by the amount of "fine cut"
he consumed. He was the cynosure of
all eyes. Every reference to him and
his men and methods met with the
wildest applause, and the speakers
were not at all chary of expressing
themselves in unmistakable terms.
S. E. Smith, the candidate of the New
Charter Club for Mayor, was chair
man. He said that Monday would de
cide whether the city government was
to remain in the hands of the machine
or was to be placed under control of the
friends of the new charter. He pre
dicted a sweeping victory all along the
line by handsome majorities.
W. E. Crossman, candidate for Coun
cilman of the First Ward, said that it
was his firm belief that at the election
on Monday every precinct in the city
would give a majority for the New
Charter Club ticket from top to bottom.
F. B. Brown remarked that he did
not expect to be able to convert any
"thoroughbred" or any one upon whom
the "gang" had strings, even if they
attended the campaign meetings of the
Charter Club, but he did hope to con
vert to the principles of good govern
ment every sensible and right-minded
voter.
O. O. Felkner said that he noticed
that "the head of that corrupt gang"
was present; "but I am not afraid of
him," he continued, "and I shall say
plainly what is in my mind."
He then paid his compliments to the
boss, his henchmen and the evils they
have brought upon San Jose. In con
clusion he advised the people to vote
against boodle and misrule.
J. M. Allen, the Charter Club candi
date for city clerk, reviewed the situa
tion and declared that if he were
elected the people could rest assured
that no boss, no ring nor anybody else
would control him.
W. G. Alexander, one of the candi
dates for membership on the Appoint
ing board, made a plea in behalf of
good government, which would come,
he declared, only by the election of the
New Charter Club candidates.
Colonel W. B. Hardy asserted that if

which Rea was interested. He had

PANAMA CANAL
COMMISSION RETURNING.
International Representatives Much
Pleased With the Present Eco
nomical Management.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, April B.â After nearly a
month's work Inspecting the Panama
canal, the International Commission
sailed to-day for Europe, via New York,
on the steamer Allianoa. On the report
of this commission depends largely the
future of the Panama Canal project.
There is good reason to believe that the
commission was favorably impressed with
what its members saw. The present
economical system, in wide contrast to
the reckless extravagance of previous
administrations, particularly attracted
the attention of the commlsion.

CRUSHED BENEATH THE
WHEELS OF A TRAIN
Rail Accident Which May Cort Â«
Calistoga Laborer His
Life.
NAPA, April B.â George Ackerman wasl
brought to the Napa County Infirmary
here to-day from Calistoga by Henry;
Clark, night watchman at that place.
Ackerman was run over by a train last
night and both of his legs were crushed.
He was under the influence of liquor
when the accident occurred.
Ackerman said there was another man
with him, and that the train struck both
of them, but the other man did not get
hurt.
County Physician E. Z. Hennessey dfr*
cided that amputation was necessary,
and Ackerman's left leg was taken off at
the knee and the right foot removed
above the ankle. It is thought the pa
tient cannot live.
Ackerman is about 61 years of age and,
a native of Switzerland. He has lived In
Calistoga for many years and is a la->.
borer by occupation.
SAUSALITO'S ALARM
â¢ SYSTEM DESTROYED.
Mechanism Stolen From the Firej
Boxes and False Alarms Sent
In By Miscreants.
SAUSALITO, April B.â The fire-alarm
system recently put in by order of tha
Town Trustees is in a deplorable condi
tion. An inspector has reported to tha
Trustees, after a careful examination,
that he could not find one box in the en-Â»
tire system that had not been damaged op
wholly destroyed, evidently by mischiev
ous persons. Glasses in the alarm boxes
have been knocked out and broken and in
some instances the inspector found where
the alarm cranks had been wrenched en
tirely out of place and the mechanism de-Â»
stroyed. One box has disappeared en*
tlrely.
The Trustees will undoubtedly make an
investigation, and an effort will be made
to discover the persons who have wrecked
the system, which was. put in at the
town's expense. Many false alarms hava
been turned in and the system outrage
ously abused.

THE CONCERT OF EUROPE.
formal joint address made by Austria.
France. Germany, Great made by and Rus
â¢y. Great Britain, Italy and Kus
sia to our Government and to that of Spain
urging an agreement between them that will secure
the maintenance of peace and re-establish order in
Cuba is the latest development of that new factor
in diplomacy known as the European concert. It is
another step in the direction of making all interna
tional complications the subject of concern to all
nations, and as such it is of much more interest as a
precedent likely to be followed than a? a serious
effort to prevent the impending war.
As a matter of fact it is doubtful if any of the Em
bassacors who went in due state to present the ad
dress to President McKinley had any idea that his
course would be in the slightest degree affected by
what they would say to him on behalf of their Gov
ernments. European diplomatists, however, have
now acquired the habit of talking in concert and our
controversy with Spain presented too good an op
portunity for further talk in that way for them to
overlook it. They made their address in the interests
of peace in about the same way they would go
through any ordinary state function, and took good
care to ask of us nothing that would have required
anything more than a diplomatic nothing in reply.
Had the European powers seriously entertained the
idea of an interference by the concerted action in
this instance they would probably have found them
selves as hopelessly incapable of agreeing as they
were for many months in the contest between Greece
and Turkey. From all reports that have come to us
it appears that France sympathizes with Spain be
cause of her relations to the Spanish people and her
investments in Spanish bonds. The Germans are on
the same side because just now they feel aggrieved
at the United States because of the Dingley' tariff and
the increasing export of American farm products to
Germany. The Crar of Russia is on the side of the
Spanish crown on general principles, while Austria
would support it because the Queen-Regent of Spain
is a Princess of the Austrian house, r In the mean
time Great Britain, for many reasons, is decidedly
sympathetic with the United States just now, and it
would be a very sure thing that she would not agree
to any programme that would antagonize this country
in the least.
Fortunately the affair in itself is not one of. any
considerable importance. The European concert has â 
made its display and performed its function on the
stage with just enough pomp and action to show that
it is still alive. In the future (he precedent now set
may lead to some more vigorous effort? of the kind.
There may be an actual attempt on the part of
FurÂ« to interfere in American affair?. It will then
be seen whether it would be possible to ally all
Europe against us and whether we would be checked
on our course even it such an alliance should be
formed.

THE PRESIDENT'S COURSE.
""T^HE great issues of war and peace are too grave
concerns to be treated from a partisan or a per
* sonal standpoint. They affect the national
honor and the welfare of the whole people.
In modern times no war has been either made or
avoided by a nation without criticism, usually unjust,
of those in authority, who see and know all sides
of every contingency. France was convulsed with the
war spirit in i8;o. and her Emperor had the choice
of domestic revolution or martial enterprise abroad.
Choosing the latter, he plunged into it without pre
paration and late unrolled the record of disaster from
the first skirmish to Sedan and the decheancc. Greece
wanted war, and forced the Government to it with an
army that had nothing to fight with but the historic
glories of Marathon. Salamis and Lepanto.
History is full of instances in which zeal has sub
stituted preparation for war with resulting disaster
and humiliation.
In current history these incidents are in course
of repetition; It for the purpose of partisan advan-
tage the country had been excited into war six or
three months ;iÂ£i> the enterprise would have embarked
entirely without preparation. Yet some papers and
some politicians were urgent for immediate war. If
they had had their way the opening would have been
disastrous. Of course, in the long run. the country
would have equipped its army and navy and closed
the struggle in honor and victory, but the expen-
diture of life and treasure would have been doubled,
Then the minority politicians, who are using patriot-
ism as a campaign stalking horse, would have made
the welkin ring with accusation against the Presi-
dent for disaster they had caused by their unfeeling
prostitution of popular loyalty.
During the Civil War President Lincoln had to
ftand the bitter blame of every disaster, and yet
nearly every move that failed was hotly urged by the
very classes that abused and derided him when fol-
towutg their demands brought defeat.
President McKinley is no tyro in statesmanship or
war. His patriotism and courage were put to a test
that was not tried by most of the men who profess
to soe something covert and cowardly in his patient
preparation to avoid the worst by being ready for it.
He followed and fought for the flag in many an
Â«ction and won his promotion before he readied his
majority. In considering strategy and preparation
he is equipped with a full experience in practical war.
He knows that battles are not won by perfervid
oratory, that powder is needed and not periods, rams
not rhetoric, and he knows that the beginning of
failure is in underestimate of the enemy. Spain is
poor and in decadence, but when even such a nation
coo* to war it is to fight, and no other, no matter
how great its inherent strength, can go out to meet
it unprepared.
In the last eight weeks we have put our strength
on land and sea in equipment for military use. We
have money, men and ships; we have guns and pow
der, an organized commissary, transportation in
order and stand at attentian. ready for what is to
come. If now diplomacy force Spain to see herself
as she is. and she remove our cause for reprisal, this
country will have a valuable experience, and in future
the mouth-valiant warrior will set his bueca! squad
rons in the air and invoke Mars to windy war in
vain if the country feel either lack of cause or need
of preparation.
The eyes of the people are on the men who will
attempt to gain partisan advantage out of such a
serious issue as slaughter, for if war come they will
be the first to hamper and impede the President, and,
as their kind have done before, keep a fire in the rear
more galling than that in front.
It is for Congress to declare war and for the Presi
dent to wage it. He knows his responsibility and has
prepared for it. No point has been lost while the
torrid Hotspurs have found it difficult to restrain their
desire to see somebody else fight. The President is
a soldier and knows his duty and will do it.
He should not fail, however, to give due weight to
the public impatience which has followed the an
nouncement that military prcpar-.tions are complete.
He will thereby deprive the political minority of the
chance to make capital and embarrass him by even
temporarily alienating the public confidence in his
course. In such a straggle as seems imminent the
President must not permit any shadows between him
and the people, for the partisan opposition in Con
groK will make of them substance, if pretentious
statement can do it. Since the speech by Lentz of
Ohio it is evident that the minority intend to s.v
the patriotic expectations of the people by voting
war budgets and make party capital by criticizing the
expenditure of the money. With a substantial frank
ness of relation established between the President and
the people these misplaced manifestations of par
tisanship will excite only disgust, for the people never
patiently endure the effort of politicians to turn
battle-shed blood into efnee-seeking advantage.
THE CASE OF LIEUTENANT ADfIMS.
TO state the matter concisely. Lieutenant Adams
has been drunk again. As an individual his
bibulous tendency might be of no general im
portance, but as a portion of the r.avy on a jag Adams
invites attention. The country has a right to demand
that the men who sail its ships shall be sober. Just
at a time when the country seems on the verge of wnr
and any man or officer may be called to instant dun
there can be no excuse tor keeping dipsomaniacs on
the roster.
But a short time ago Adams wa? tried for intoxi
cation. The court-martial found that the charge was
truf, but it also found a technicality by which it could
protect the accused from any penalty, and it did so.
*:" r this the tribunal was severely arraigned by the
Secretary of the Navy. The intimation was strong
that it had been wrongfully lenient toward an of
fender deserving 61 punishment. It might have been
supposed that this narrow escape would have been a
- to Adams, but hardly had he beer, restored to
duty before he got drunk again, gloriously full, and
was taken in disgrace to his quarters. New if the
court-martial whitewash him once more it will be
arraigned not only by disgusted officials, but by the
people at large.
The personnel of the navy is up to a high standard.
Citizens who pay for the navy, who pay for the train
ing of its men. would have it kept so. They have a
pride in it and a confidence which cannot be safely
abused. In the capacity of a private person Adams
would have peculiar facilities for indulging in his
amusement of painting his environment, with nothing
to interfere save the police. He should seire the op
portunity and resign. Failing to resign, he should
be dismissed.
There is in use at the per.itenyary of Colorado what
the Warden terms a "spanking chair." The person
occupying it gets automatically padded. and with
great rest. There is a feeling among the ultra-war
like that the Warden ought to lend the contrivtnee
to the Speaker pi the House.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 1898.
THE ISSUE IN SAN JOSE.
THE municipal campaign in San Jose virtually
closes this evening. The great mass of citizens
have taken their stand on one side or the other,
and are lined up for the contest on election day.
About all that can be advanced in the way of argu
ment has been set forth, and such voters as are still
in doubt which cause to support at the polls are
either persons of vacillating mind, whose actions are
always determined by the latest influence brought to
bear upon them, or else persons who are habitually
indifferent to public affairs and vote capriciously as
the impulse directs when the time comes.
A canvass of the citizens justifies the belief, that the
victory at the polls will be gained by the advocates
of good government, even if all the vacillating and
indifferent crowd should be herded by the boss and
his gang between now and the election. Nevertheless,
it is gratifying to note that the progressive and honest
clement of the people do not intend to take chances.
They have warned the people against the machinations
of the ring machine and put them on guard against
j the slanders and lies that are pretty sure to be issued
by the unscrupulous foe with which they have to
j deal. These warnings cannot fail to counteract to
| some extent the base methods resorted to by the
i gang candidates and their supporters, and the election
morning canards will be less potent in determining
j votes than the boss expects.
i This address of warning issued by the Charter Club
j at its last mtvt'ng was a natural and necessary out-
I come of the campaign itself. In all political contests
\ there is more or less of misrepresentation, falseness
and calumny, against which the public has to be
put on guard in the interests of honorable men. In
the San Jose campaign, however, that form of at
tack has been carried to a degree of lying almost be
yond precedent. An element of personal malice has
been infused into the attacks made upon nearly all
j the candidates of the Charter Club, anc the lies cir
| culated about them have had all the poison that mean-
ness and malignity can instill into the slander that un
scrupulous cunning invents and shameless mendacity
utters.
Eliminating the lies of the gang from consideration,
the issue presented to the voters of San Jose in this
election is in the fullest sense a question of honest
government and all the prosperity it implies against
dishonest ring rule and all the plunder, waste and
municipal stagnation that go with it.
THE ACCEPTED STREETS.
WE are enabled this morning to make the sur
prising announcement that the Board of Super
visors has at last completed arrangements for
the repair ot the streets and crossings of this city which
during the past thirteen years have been paved with
bituminous rock. At a meeting of the Street Com
mittee on Thursday it was resolved to advertise for
proposals with this end in view. The specifications
submitted require the contractor within three months
after the award to place all bituminous streets in per
fect order, and to thereafter keep them in that con
dition. Upon forty-eight hours' notice even" break
must be repaired.
This movement is quite startling, for the reason
that the Supervisors lor over ten years have appar
ently assumed that bituminous rock pavements were
going to last forever. The material came into ex
tensive use about ISSS. In that year several blocks
were laid on Golden Gate avenue. Some of them
immediately wore out: that is to say. no sooner had
the contractors laid them than they cultivated a dis
j position to generate "chuck" holes. This was attrib
. uted to the poor quality of the bitumen used, and
I orders were passed by the Supervisors boycotting the
product of the offer.ding deposits.
But no one ever suggested that measures should
be taken to keep other blocks of the material in re
pair. We believe that one over-zealous Street Super
intendent did persuade the Supervisors that the city
ought to have its own steam kettle and roller, but in
purchasing the machines somebody blundered and got
them so large it was found impossible to operate
them. As we recall the incident, the roller was too
heavy to be moved by the delicate muscles of the
-itive gentlemen who are employed by the Street
Department to repair accepted streets.
At the present time there are in the city over
13.000,000 square feet of bituminous rock pavement,
all of which is in a more or less bad state of repair.
: Especially on the downtown streets the material has
shown it? inability to sustain heavy traffic without
! constant attention. Although it is a nineteenth cen
; tun- marvel that for upward of thirteen years the Su
pervisors should have left the bituminous streets of
the city to care for themselves, the announcement
that a repairing contract is about to be awarded
comes, a> â â¢ye have said, in the nature of a surprise.
The fact that the city's business is always managed
with marked imbecility is. not the only ground for
â  amazement. Heretofore repairing has been done by
a force employed by the Superintendent of Streets.
Of course this means that no repairing has been done
at all. A public contract will displace these politi
cians. How it has been brought about, therefore, is
a mystery.
We perceive in this chapter of municipal history
two or three remarkable things. First, there is a
reversal of the policy of letting the accepted streets
gq to the devil: second, there is a covert attempt to
interfere with the leisure of the politicians employed
by the Street Department, some of whom will now be
compelled to go to work: thirdâ and more surpris
j ing than all â somebody is going to try to keep the
accepted streets in repair. We are scarcely able to
comprehend ill this. We fear there is a job be
hind it.
The proposition to have crazy criminals confined in
a penitentiary building will not be approved of by
the sane lunatics who make a specialty of committing
crimes and then getting excused on the plea o: being
peculiar. Where is the virtue of pleading insanity
and then having to go to jail after all?
Detailed accounts of the plans by which the ships
of the navy are to be distributed in case of war lack
in a measure the evidences of authenticity. As a rule
the initial move of the commander is not to confide
in the first correspondent who happens to come
along.
The Spanish Consul at Key West is said to con
template placing himself under the protection of the
British Consul there. Such precaution will not be
necessary. The residents of Florida have the honor
to be civilized.
A supposition that upon arrival in this country Lee
would have something startling to tell grows weaker.
It has even reached such a stage of incredibility that
the New York Journal accepts and pub'. ; .<'"?s it as a
fact.
Cranks Â»re becoming thick at Washington, but hap
pily few of them are in public life.

started for the races. On his way to In

he bought a ticket of admission from v

too far. Too much importance has been
laid upon the question of how much mere
learning a pupil will acquire in school. It
is true that a pupil will learn more from a
good teacher than from the best of books,
and the knowledge of this fact tends to
lead educators- to attach too much impor
tance to the teacher as a source of in
struction independent of books, or at
least to underestimate the value of books.
If the true purpose of teaching were
merely to cram the mind with knowledge,
then that system that would impart the
most knowledge in a given time would
seem to be the best. But the gaining of :
knowledge is not the sole object. Of at
least equal importance is the development
of mental puwers and the formation of
good habits. The pupil cannot be a pupil ;
always; cannot always have the help of a I
teacher. He should be taught to rely i
upon himself, to stand alone. When he
leaves the school room his work is not I
done; he is only just entering upon the !
actual business and duty of life. He does j
not learn in school all that he should i
learn, however excellent his teachers and j
their system. To succeed in life, to ac- j
complish anything of value, he must be j
progressive, must continue to learn; and j
he must do this without either the spur
or the aid of a teacher.
To this end his course of instruction and
training in school should be such as
would not make him dependent upon his
teachers. He should be taught to learn
without their aid. He should have de
veloped in him a love for learning that
should cause him to desire it for its own
sake and his own good, and should have
habits of industry and thoroughness and
a feeling of self-reliance that would lead
him to active and persevering work on
his own account. His school should not
be regarded as a place where his work is
completed, but as an apprenticeship in
which he learns to use the best tools in
the best way for the work of his lifetime.
â¢No man ever accomplished anything or
amounted to anything whose improve
ment and development ended with his
school life.
Of all means of improvement at com
mand tht most valuable are books. These
are storehouses of all knowledge, upon
all suojects, always within our reach and
always at our service. Pupils in school
should be taught to use them and be
taught how to use them to the best ad
vantage. This should be one of the main
objects of the teacher. No matter how
great his capacity for imparting knowl
edge directly from himself, he can give
his pupils no instruction of equal value
to that which teaches them to make the
best use of books. The pupil who leaves
school with a love for books, trained to
make the best use of them, and with the
courage, industry and perseverance to dig
into then and lay hold of their treasures,
has an education that is immensely valu
able, which will lead him continually
farther and higher in the ways of life:
but, without this, no matter "how high
his standing in this, his acquirements are
destitute of life and vigor, temporary,
and of comparatively little value. He
lacks the vitality essential to progress
and growth. One cannot stand still after
leaving school; he must either grow or
dwindie.
The pupil at the beginning must of
necessity depend upon the teacher. As
he advances he should become more and
more independent of support. His text
books, especially in the higher grades,
should contain substantially all that he
is required at the time to learn, and in
such form that it can be learned from the
books themselves. And. while it is true
that there is no royal road to learning,
yet the book? should, as far as practic
able, present their subjects in a clear ana
attractive manner, so that the student
should be led to regard books not as
conundrums or task masters, but as
friends and helpers. The teacher should
guide and encourage tue pupil, not so
ihuoh with a view to giving the informa
tion sought as to building up habits of
application, perseverance and self-reli
ance, so that in the end the pupil may be
able ajid willing to walk alone. As a re
suit pupils, on leaving school, might not
have so large a knowledge as might
otherwise be crammed into them, butthey
would have strength, character and hab
its of thought and action of infir.itely
more value. H. GOODCELL.

I Aside from the tender sentiment

hearer. "Within sacred walls, where the

IN THIS BILL

and Towns May Be
Invalidated.
Mistake in a Measure Which
Passed California's
Senate.
Many Sections of the Statute Repealed
When the Act Became
a Uw.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April B.â A very in
teresting and probably a very serious
question has arisen in connection with
the passage of what is known as Sen
ate Bill No. 441, introduced in the last
passion of the Legislature by Senator
Bulla, passed and approved by the Gov
ernor on March 9, 1897. The act pro
vides for the refunding of indebtedness
of incorporated cities and towns by the
issuance of bonds therefor, and pro
vides for the payment thereof. The
general provisions of the act enable any
mon Council, Board of Trustees or
governing body of any city or
town, other than cities of the first
class, to fund cr refund any indebted
ness, by issuing bonds. After specify
ing certain restrictions and conditions
the act concludes with the following
sections:
Sec. 4. Chapter eighty-two of the Stat
utes of eighteen hundred and eighty
three, chapter forty-eight of the statutes
of eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and
chapter one hundred and seventy-six of
the statutes of eighteen hundred and
ninety-five, all being laws of the State o*
California In conflict herewith are hereby
repealed.
Sec. 6. This act shall take effect and be
in force immediately after its passage.
Herein lies the difficulty and is the
cause of much uneasiness on the part of
many cities and towns throughout the
State. It will be observed that chapter
48 of the statutes of 1893 is repealed, or
at least an attempt is m le to do so.
Now it is very evident from an exam
ination of that statute that such was
not the intention of the Legislature.
"Under chapter 47 are the sections which
were intendeu to be nullified. Some
mistake was evidently made by some
one and the question now ariaea, What
will be the effect?
Ir under this act of 1897 the sections
of chapter 48 are repealed there is no
law by which cities and towns of Cali
fornia containing more than 3000 and
less than 10.000 inhabitants can incur
an indebtedness for the construction of
â water works, sewers and all other pub
lic Improvements. If there are cities
and towns which have under that sec

I validity of the obligation is certainly
questionable.
The mistake was discovered in the
Secretary of State's office to-day, and
1 there is no doubt that the discovery
will cause great uneasiness in many
! communities where public improve
i rnents have been contracted for under
j the law of 1893 or have been in contem
plation.
Private Secretary Shields of the Gov
ernor's office acknowledged that the
matter had not been brought before
him until to-day, but he had not as yet
made an examination nor had he dis
cussed it with the Governor. He was
inclined to the belief that Governor
Budd had not approved a bill which re
pealed another, not contemplated by
the Legislature or sanctioned by him.
Mr. Shields, in speaking off-hand, said
that he did not believe, in the first
place, that a former act of the Legisla
ture could be repealed in a subsequent
act by the mere designation of the
chapter. The act of 1897, in attempting
to repeal the act of 1893, referred to the
latter act by simply designating the
chapter. This, in Mr. Shields' opinion,
is not sufficient, as the chapter is not a
division contemplated by the constitu
tion or a division indicated by the Leg
islature.
The bills, when they reach the Gov
ernor, have been passed by the House
and Senate and signed by the Speaker
and President of the respective bodies.
The word "chapter" does not appear
i upon them until they have become laws
by the final approval of the Governor.
i As they are signed, the executive sec
i retaries designate them by chapters,
and in that shape they are bound. They
would be the law of the land just the
same were there no such a designation,
i and in fact such a division is merely a
; matter of convenience and forms no
vital requisite to the validity of any
statute. This being true, Mr. Shields
i claims that no act can be repealed by
a mere reference to the chapter.
If Mr. Shields is correct there has
been no repeal of the law of 1893, neith
er in respect to the issuance of bonds
! under chapter XLVII nor in respect to
the construction of water works and
other improvements under chapter
XLVIII. But as the first mentioned
act is by the construction of statutes
repealed by the subsequent conflict, it
will no doubt be claimed that the one
stands while the other falls. This po
sition may be correct, but it is to be
hoped that many statutes repealed in
the past have not been disposed of by
the mere reference to the chapter; be
cause if they have, under Mr. Shields 1
Interpretation they are still in force.
It is a matter which will no doubt
be determined properly, but in the
meantime many communities will be
disturbed. During this period of un
certainty the question will naturally
be asked, Who is to blame? A repre
sentative from the office of the Secre
tary of State and The Call correspond
ent examined ihe original bill of Mr.
Bulla, and found that there had been
no mistake in the enrollment. The bill

JUNEAT', Alaska. April 4 (by steam-
Bhip Al-Ki, via Seattle, April B).â A
horrible catastrophe, surpassing in the
number of fatalities the flooding of the
canyon last fall by the mountain lake,
nas occurred in Dyea Canyon, between
Sheep Camp and the Scales. An ava
lanche of snow and ice yesterday after
aoon swooped down the mountain,
burying alive and crushing between
forty and fifty men, and injuring nearly
is many more. There is great excite
ment as Skaguay and Dyea, and many
will leave here for the scene of the dis
ister on the steamship Australia, which
sails late f>-night for Skaguay. The
srst news of the calamity reached here
at 5 o'clock this afternoon on thÂ»
Bteamship Discovery and the Al-Ki
came in at about 8 o'clock to-night and
;onfirmed the report.
The Al-Ki left Skaguay at 9:30 this
morning. As the fatal snow slide oc
curred at about 4 o'clock yesterday
(Sunday) afternoon only meager details
were obtainable here to-night. The
representative of The Cah whom I left
In charge at Skaguay and Dyea during
my absence chartered a tug at Skag
uay last evening to take him around
the point to Dyea and from there he
will go by horse to the place of death.
I will reach the scene to-morrow after
noon.
A telephone message was received at
Skaguay from Dyea late last night,
stating that twenty-seven bodies had
been dug out of the snow. A large force
of volunteers is at work with pick and
shovel throwing aside the snow in the
hope that it may be in time to rescue
Borne of the buried men alive. The res
cuers worked all night.
About 8 o'clock this morning another
message came by telephone from Dyea
stating that eighteen more bodies
had been excavated. If these figures
are accurate they will make a total of
forty-three dead.
The slide occurred in about the same
place where the lake of water broke
loose last fall. It was near Stone
House and over on the other side of the
canyon. John Pellett of Seattle, a pas
senger on the Discovery, left Sheep
Camp yesterday morning, a few hours
before the snow slide. He said:
"The first we heard of the accident
was last evening at Skaguay. The re
port came over from Dyea by tele
phone. I left Sheep Camp early yes
terday morning to catch the first boat
south. It had been snowing steadily
for two days up the canyon. It was a
heavy, wet snow. Great quantities of
It accumulated on the mountain sides,
and I expected some of it to fall down.
There was so much snow that I did not
Bee how it could cling to the sides of the
canyon. Great fields and mountains of
It were piled upon the top of the can
yon on both sides. There are tents and
camps all along the canyon. The men
gxÂ» up loaded early in the morning and
come back to their camp or cache at
Sheep Camp at 11 or 12 o'clock. In the
afternoon they make another trip to
the summit or the Scales, and along
about 4 o'clock and on to 5 o'clock there
j- Â«Â». r*Kular crocession of men cominir
bark on the trail. That explains to me
why so many were caught and buried.
"The walls of the canyon opposite
Stone House are almost perpendicular.
A man would have only one chance In
a hundred of petting out of the way
of an avalanche there, even If he
looked up and saw It earning. It would
be a straight fall Instead of a slide. I
heard that thirty-one dead men were
taken out last night."
A little more light Is thrown on the
disaster by the situation of the trails
at Stone House. The horse trail runs
to the right of the canyon, going up
and over close to Stone House. Foot
and handsled trail Is over on th~ op
posite side and follows the course of
the river, which is considerably lower
than the horse trail, and all day Ions?
there are twenty men on the hand
sled trail to one on the horse trail. I
have seen 100 men on this trail within
a distance of fifty yards, going and
coming. Nearly opposite Stone House,
on the brow of the canyon, is a glacier.
Its walls of ice, beautiful as emerald
and sapphire in' the sunshine, an im
aginary cathedral of the skies, stand
exposed in June as well as in January-
It does not melt away the y?ar round.
Mountains of snow crown this glacier
during the winter. This is the point
from which the avalanche came.
A small snow slide which occurred
shortly before the big avalanche buried
two or three men who were encampc-d
along the trail. While those on the trail
were hard at work endeavoring to ex
tricate the unfortunates the monster
avalanche swept down the mountain
side, crushing the tents pitched along
the trail and enveloping scores of men,
the majority of whom were endeavoring
to assist those who had met with mis
fortune in the previous smaller slide.
The injured gold-seekers who have
been rescued are terribly lacerated, and
it is feared that a number of them will
die. As soon as the news of the calam
ity was made known along the trail
men hurried to the scene from Dyea
and other points, and with shovels,
picks and even pans and pails toiled
to extricate the unfortunates. Sheep
Camp was soon left without an inhabi
tant, as every one from there to the
scales was soon on the scene.
The sight was an awful one, for there
in a state of terrible excitement, which
increased as the bodies were uncovered,
were brothers, fathers, sons and friends
anxiously digging, trembling lest the
next body they uncovered should. be
that of a loved one. As in the rush to
the " gold fields, but few men, even
though traveling together, went to the
trouble of inquiring as to the names
of their companions, the greater num
ber of the dead have not been Identi
fied, and those who have been taken
out alive are so benumbed and dazed
that they can hardly tell who had been
in company with them.
The roar of the avalanche could be
distinctly heard at Sheep Camp and as
far as Canyon City, situated about six
miles south of the fatal spot.
Seventeen men. all members of the
Chilkoot Transportation Company,
started over the trail on Sunday morn
ing and had about time to reach the
Scales when the terrible slide occurred.
None of them have since been seen,
and none of their bodies have been re
covered. It Is feared the entire party
was caught in the slide and killed.
There were a good many tents covered
up beyond the reach of rescuers and
numbers of bodies will never be re
covered until the spring sun thaws
away their snow graves.
At the Stone House four big slides
occurred. One hundred men, who were
descending by the aid of a life line 200
yards long, were caught. Of these only
three are known to have been saved.
At the Scales, where the third slide
took place, at least 100 tons of outfits
were covered up. S. A. Townsend of
Fort "Worth, Texas, talking of the cal
amity, says:
"From personal knowledge and in
quiry it is my judgment that at least
150 people were killed by the slides.
When I left Sheep Camp at 10:30 a, m.
on Monday morning thirty-one dead
bodies had been recovered, and the
number of injured that hed been res
cued was reported at twenty-five."
The dead are being laid out in a tent
used as a bunkhouse. Nobody is per
mitted to touch the remains. Many
physicians have gone to the scene from
Dyea, and there are about a half dozen
doctors at Sheep Camp also; so there
is no lack of medical attendance for
the injured. There is a well conducted
tent hospital at Dyea. The law au
thorizes the United States Commission
er at Dyea to act as Governor.
A report that the bodies had been
robbed lacks confirmation. The United
States troops at Dyea would probably
interfere to prevent any desecration of
that kind.
The report that forty-three men had
been killed was corroborated by Purser
Bush of the Al-Ki. One of the men who
brought down the first news of the
avalanche on the steamship Discovery
was Oeorge Bach, who came from
Seward City in February. with the first
information of the loss of the Clara Ne
vada, and who is the only person who
saw her burn. The work of recovering
i the dead from the snow continues.

ADVANCE OF
RUSSIA IN
THE ORIENT
Proposed Extension
of Her Steamship
Service.
Will Revolutionize Com
munications in the
Far East
Eight New Lines Soon to Be
Put On by the Czar's
Government.
MARINE TRAFFIC GROWS.
Railroad Between Vladivostok and
Habarofka Has Already Been
Completed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April B.â Japanese papers
announce on authority of a correspond
ent at Vladivostok that Russia
is about to inaugurate an extension of
Russian steamship services in the
Orient that will strongly tend to revo
lutionize existing communications in
the far East. Their Vladivostok corre
spondent writes that the railroad be
tween Vladivostok and Habarofka has
already been completed, and the time
and distance between Vladivostok and
Central Siberia has been considerably
shortened. Meanwhile Russian marine
traffic in the Orient has Increased and
the Itussian Government is now con
sulting with Scherveloff & Co. upon the
question of instituting eight new
steamship services in the Orient as fol
lows:
1. "Weekly service of steamers be
tween Vladivostok, Hongkong and
Shanghai, steamers to call at Nagasaki
and Canton.
2. Service of steamers running be
tween Vladivostok and Korean ports.
Newchwang, Tientsin, Chefoo and
Shanghai. The line will run in connec
tion with the Russo-Chinese Railway,
and regular boats on Sungari River.
3. Line between Shanghai and Han
kow. This line is to connect with
steamers of Russia's volunteer fleet
running from the Baltic Sea to Vladi
vostok.
4. Line between Vladivostok, Shl
monoski. Kobe and Yokohama.
6. Line between Vladivostok, Hako
date and Yokohama. By this route
connection will be formed with Ameri
can steamers to San Francisco and the
Siberian Railway. It is reported that
Mr. Scherveloff early recognized the
advantage of this line and consulted
with Americans as to the connection.
6. Line between Nicolaivsk and Hako
date. Nicolaivsk is situated at the
mouth of Amor River and is the com
mercial center in the north, especially
for flsh. The number of fishermen pro
ceeding thither from Hakodate is In
creasing yearly. About ten steamers
of 400 to 500 tons burden are sent there
from Hakodate every year to carry fish
in addition to some hundreds of sailing
vessels and Junks. The place is very
prosperous in summer. The Russian
steamers on this line are inteded to call
at the ports on both sides of Tartary
Straits and at Otaru. Hokkaido.
7. Line from Vladivostok to Nico
laivsk, via Saghalien and Tartary
Straits.
8. Line from Vladivostok to Petro
paulovski, via Saghalien.
The last named two are already
opened by the volunteer fleet of steam
ers, and the proposal Is made to in
crease the number of voyages and to
put more suitable vessels on this route.

ENLARGING THE
REGULAR SERVICE.
NEW YORK. April B.â A "Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Secre
tary Long has determined to ask Con
gress to grant him authority to enroll
the naval militia and merchant marine
into the regular service. His request
will be made personally to-morrow to
the House Naval Committee, before
which he will appear In company with
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt, who has
been diligently laboring to-day per
fecting details of the department's
plans.
If Congress acts as desired by the
department the navy will be increased
immediately after its passage by nearly
6000 more or less well trained officers
and men belonging to the militia and
by further addition of a large number
of capable officers and men who form a
portion of the merchant marine. It is

formally, naval militia organizations
will be used for coast defense purposes,
but it is intended by the department
that they shall be available in case of
emergency for service on any part of
the coast in any vessels the Secretary
may deem It necessary to assign them.
STOPPED THE TRAIN FOR GAME.
Minnesota Conductor Pulled the Cord
and the Crew "Went Hunting.
Every man you see in Minnesota in
game season carries a gun or keeps one
handy. The Minnesota man who tells this
story says he heard that country preach
ers go prepared.
"When game does flash up on you in
Minnesota," he said, "it is worth shooting
at. No matter where a man may be in
that State, or what he may be doing, he
will be excused if he is seen to pick up a
gun and make a break. The natives un
derstand it.
"Thelasttlmol was out there I was sit
ting in the baggage car of a train talking
to the conductor, whom I knew very well,
lie asked me when I went in where my
gun was, and 1 had to apologize for not
hay " s u lt- T ffootr Â£ot the custom. Then I
asKoa him if there was any apprehension
about train robbers. Just then he jumped
from a trunk, grabbed the bell cord until
l thought he must have jerked the loco
motive from the track. The train came to
a stand as quickly as was possible, and
the conductor, seizing a shotgun from a
rack, jumped from the door of the car
and told me to follow. As I did so 1 saw
several brakemen, the baggageman and
tho engineer on the ground. Every one of
them had a shotgun. The conductor was
in the lead. Suddenly there was a noise.
A flock of prairie chickensâ tln-re must
have been a hundredâ rose in the air. At
the same instant the air was blue with
smoke and scented with powder. Kighty
dead prairie chickens were found, but the
conductor assured me that the whole
Hock had been killed, and that some had
probably dropped in the brush.
'The hunt from the time the bell cord
was pulled for the stop until the train
was again under headway tasted less than
forty minutes. I noticeu that the train
dispatcher got his share of the chickens.
Of course this was a mixed train, but the
conductor told me that it would have
made no difference if it had been the lim
ited. He allowed no game to get out of
his reach."â Np W York Sun.
HE WANTED HIS SHARE.
An Incident of Decatur's Capture of
the Frigate Macedonian.
This is the story of a young sailor who
lived two generations before young Dan
Wallingford, who gave his complete for
tune of 48 cents to build a new battleship
to replace the Maine. His first name was
Bill and his last name Is withheld. The
incident occurred in the eventful year of
1812, on board our frigate United States,
when, under Captain Decatur's skillful
command, she captured, after "long shot"
action, the British frigate Macedonian,
bringing her a prize to New York. Deca
tur got a gold medal from Congress in
recognition of the capture, and this is
what a Vermont newspaper, printed In
the year of Waterloo, tells of iÃU's part
in this sea fight:
"On board Decatur's eh!p was a little
boy about 9 years old. He was not con
sidered one of the regular crew, but he
Shared the mess of a generous sailor who
had two years before taken him fmm his
widowed mother. The spirit of his father.
Who had also been a seaman, had long
since gone aloft and left his widow and
little ones on the shoals of poverty. When
the Macedonian hove in sight "and all
hands were clearing ship for action, the
little fellow stepped up to Commodore
Decatur.
" 'And it please you. Captain,' he said,
'I wish my name might be put down on
the roll."
" 'And what for, my lad?' inquired the
tumiutiuuer.
" 'So that I can draw a share of the
prize money, sir,' answered he.
"Pleased with the spirit and confident
courage of the little hero, his name was
ordered on the list; but the moment was
too Important to say more. After the
prize was taken Decatur thought of the
little sailor boy and called bim up.
â¢: ".'Well, Bill/ said he, 'we have taken
her, and your share of the prize, if we get
her safe in, will be about $200. What will
you do with it?'
'* 'I'll send one-half of it to my mother,
sir, and the other half shall send me to
school. 1
' "That's noble,' cried the commodore.
"Delighted with the spirit of the lad, he
took him under his immediate protection,
and obtained for him the berth of a mid
shipman. Every attention is given to his
education, and he gives great promise of
making an accomplished officer." â New
York Sun.
TRACING A LOST STUD.
Some odd stories of the recovery of lost
diamonds are told by an old Union-square
Jeweler. One of them is his own experi
ence.
"One day last June," he says, "I hap
pened to recollect that I was going to a
reception. Before leaving the store 1
wrapped my two-carat diamond stud in
a piece of tissue paper and slipped it into
my vest pocket. After dinner, while
dressing in my room, I went to my
pocket to set the stud. It, was not there.
I put my hand in my fob pocket, thinking
it was surely there; then in the other
vest pocket; then in the inside pocket and
then in my four trousers pockets; but it
wits in none of them.
" 'I left that on my desk," I thought;
'I will find it there in the morning, i will
put on a plain gold stud to-night.'
"The next morning the stud was not
to be found in the store. I thought of
every step I had taken on the way home,
ajid then called our porter.
" George,' said I -just before I went
home last night I slipped a diamond stud
wrapped in tissue paper into my pocKet,
and, starting out of the store, went
across Broadway, through Union square
at Fifteenth street, going to the left of
the fountain, and then up the center
path to Seventeenth street and Fourth
avenue. I went down the right-hand side
of Seventeenth street to Second avenue
and then home. On my walk home I have
a c.stinct recollection of putting my hand
into my pocket for my penknife or some
thing else. I must have pulled out the
stud and dropped .t. Now, I want you to
follow that path and follow carefully
every step of the way, and I don't want
you to come back until you have found
the stud.'
He started out, and in less than half an
hour returned with the stud. He had
found it, still wrapped in the paper, in
the gutter, a few steps this side of Second
avenue, and he went home happy that
night with a J2O gold piece in his
pocket."â New York Sun.
UNCLE SAM IN WAR.
Speaking of war prompts the reflection
that Uncle Sam has been uniformly suc
cessful every time he has appealed to the
sword.
In the 123 years of his existence he has
waged live wars, the war of the revolu
tion, the war of 1812, the war with the
Barbary States, the Mexican war and the
war for the Union. The various brushes
he has hail with the Indians were mere
incidents. In every one of these wars the
Stars and Stripes have been triumphant.
In the war with the Barbary States
Uncle Sam was a long way from his base
of supplies, and the Barbary States were
backed with the moral support of Great
Britain, and yet Uncle Sam cleaned up
those pirates so thoroughly that the
Mediterranean Sea became as free from
their attacks as is one of the American
inland seas. The war of the revolution
and the war of 1812 were fought against
tremendous odds, and yet the Ignited
States won. In the same period, or since
the beginning of United States independ
ence, England has carried on six wars,
two of which, that of the colonies and
the war of 1812, were lost by her. France
lost two wars in the same period, the war
with the allied powers and the Franco-
I'russlan war. Prussia out of five wars
in that period lost two, Austria lost three.
Russia two and Spain every war she un
dertook except in the ten years' Â«>ar in
Cuba, which she never admitted was any
thing more than insurrection, and which
she quelled only by false promises.
Uncle Sam is not likely to break his
record of success In the impending brush
if the brush comes.â Mexico Two Repub
lics.

Southern States would co-operate with

VICTORY FOR
BRITISH ARMS
Most Brilliant Battle Ever
Fought in the
Soudan.
Mahmoud Pasha's Army Prac
tically Wiped Out or
Existence.
The Leader Himself Captured With
Four Thousand, of His
Warriors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAIRO, April B.â The Anglo-Egyp
tian forces, under the Sirdar, General
Sir Herbert Kitchener, attacked the
Dervishes' position at 7:35 this morning
and rushed Mahmoud's Zariba, the cen
ter of his fortifications, without check.
The attack was entirely successful, and
the Dervishes lost very heavily.
The Anglo-Egyptian force, after a
night march, arrived at dawn before
the enemy's camp. When the trenches
of the Dervishes had been bombarded,
the whole Anglo-Egyptian force made
a brilliant rush for the Zariba and the
trenches. The Dervishes stood their
ground bravely and reserved their fire
until the attacking force was quite
close to them. Mahmoud, the Dervish
general, was among the prisoners cap
tured.
As this dispatch was sent the Anglo-
Egyptian cavalry with Maxim guns and
batteries were pursuing the fugitives.
The loss of the Anglo-Egyptain forces
Includes Captain Urquhart of the Cam
eron Highlanders and Lieutenant Gore
of the Seaforth Highlanders, killed, and
ten officers of the British Brigade and
four British officers in the Egyptain
service, wounded.
ATBARA CAMP, Nubia, April B.â
The Sirdars' force numbered 12,000 men,
with twenty-four guns, under Colonel
Long, and twelve Maxims. The enemy
left Shandy with 19,000 men, but they
have suffered a bit from desertions
since.
The enemy was at first practically
concealed underground in a strong zar
iba, running around the whole position.
We reached Mahmouds position at 6
a. m. to-day. The enemy was evidently
aware of our approach. After an hour
of heavy bombardment the brigades
were formed up and carried the posi
tion at the point of the bayonet, under
a tremendous fire from the enemy.
The zariba was torn away, but the
enemy obstinately clung to the trenches
and "were bayoneted in them. During
the whole admirable bombardment by
Colonel Long, not a single dervish was
visible.
Mahmoud was captured by the Tenth
Soudanese battalion. He was under
ground the whole time his men were
fighting. Osman Digna lied as usual.
The prisoners say that Mahmoud's
forces were deserting in large numbers
before the battle. The enemy's guns,
baggage, animals and standards were
captured.
Our loss would have been much heav
ier if the enemy had not fired high.
The Dervish fire was very heavy and
the British loss was mostly before
reaching the zariba. Colonel Murray
had his horse shot under him and was
wounded in the arm. The enemy cer
tainly behaved with great bravery. The
prisoners say they lost heavily by the
bombardment before the advance.
Some of the enemy tried to break
across the river at an early stage, but
were driven back by the Dervishes'
horsemen.
The rockets under Captain Beatty
set the enemy's camp afire in many
places. Bashardi Redi fell at the head
of his men.
The authorities call to-day's battle
the most brilliant ever fought in the
Soudan, everything having been car
ried straight through without a hitch
or a check. Inside the zariba there
was an astonishing labyrinth of earth
works.
I have been all over the Dervish po
sition and estimate their dead at more
than 2000. The night march was as
weird as that of Tel-el-Kebir. Egyp
tians. Soudanese and British strove to
be first in the race and to be first in
the attack. As usual several brigades
claim the honor.
The enemy opened with such a ter
rific fire that our men were dropping
on all sides. It was as venomous a
fusillade as troops were ever called
upon to face.
Mahmoud's army is practically wiped
out. Four thousand of his followers
have been taken prisoners and he him
self has been caught hiding in a hole
under a bed. He is a tall, dignified,
sensuous looking, black baggara, about
35 years of age, with a shaved head.
When taken he was dressed In a richly
embroidered robe.

SECRET OF
COCOS ISLE
South Sea Fortune-
Hunters Besieged
for Information.
Obliged to Seek Seclusion
to Avoid an Inquisi
tive Mob.
Will Fit Out a Larger Expedi
tion to Recover the Buried
Treasure.
COVERED BY A LANDSLIDE.
Searched Far From the Hiding Place
to Deceive a Distrusted
Crew.
Willis Aumock and his party of Cocos
Island treasure hunters were obliged to
keep in seclusion in their rooms at the
Golden West Hotel yesterday to escape
the horde of inquirers that all day be
sieged them. They all wanted infor
mation concerning the hiding place of
the long lost wealth of the Incas that
for more than half a century has eluded
the probes of the army of fortune seek
ers that since the historical voyage of
the bark Mary Dea have delved in the
sands of the little isle of the South Pa
cific. "Some of the men who called
on us," said Mr. Aumock, "wanted to
know the exact spot where the fortune
lies buried, and they became quite in
dignant when the information was re
fused them.
"I am satisfied we have found the
exact spot where the treasure lies burled
on Cocos Island," cdtitmued the leader
of the fortune-hunting party. "I feel
certain that before twelve months more
have passed we will have the hidden
wealth in our possession, or as much
of it as the Government of Costa Rica
will allow us to carry away. I have
no doubt that we are on the right
scent and the treasure cannot get away
from us unless some one by sheer good
luck should visit the island and un
earth it before we can get back to the
place. Of that, however, I have no
fear. It can only be found by means
of the chart I hold and it is the only
chart of the hiding place of the treas
ure in existence, and it is zealously
guarded. The chart is yellow with
age and I have proven that it is cor
rect. I was not (in the island an hour
when I stood on the spot where the
wealth lies hidden. Not far under my
feet at that moment was a fortune for
a hundred men. It will, though, take
some work to pet it. The topography
of the island has changed a great deal
since Captain Keaton of the treasure
bark Mary Dea and his mate, Thomp
son, slipped out of the harbor of Callao
with the wealth of the Peruvians on
l><->ur'i and hid it under the sands of the
little atoll.
"The chart I now have and which led
me to the ppot where the gold and
Jewels He buried was made by Captain
Keaton and he took the precaution to
niak-- it when he was hiding the wealth
bo that he could find his way back to
the spot whenever he should have an
opportunity to return to the island.
Only once since then did that oppor
tunity arise. Captai.i Keaton and a
friend, Captain Bogue, fitted out an ex
pedition at Boston and set sail for the
island. They reached the place without
difficulty, but the crew, which was a
mixed one. got wind of the purpose of
the voyage and Keaton and Bogue be
came alarmed at their conduct and
thought it best not to take any more
nf the hidden wealth aboard their ves
h-'I than they could conveniently carry
concealed about them. They unearthed
the treasure ahd took only about $20,000
each and sailed away with it after care
fully covering what they were com
pelled to leave behind. Keaton's friend
was drowned on the return voyage and
the gold he had recovered went to the
bottom nf the sea with him. Keaton
on his return to Boston where his fam
ily lived made a great display of his
puddenly acquired wealth. His daugh
ter was covered in a blaze of Jewels and
the gems were set in a manner long
since forgotten in the Jeweler's art.
The daughter married a man named
Young not long before the father died
and Keaton confided the secret of the
hidden treasure to his son-in-law, at
the name time giving him the chart of
the biding place on the South Pacific
isle.
"Young wandered about the country
nnd a few months ago I met him in
Mexico. I befriended him in more ways
than one and he confided to me the
pecret of the Cocos Island treasure. Ar
rangements were made with him to fit
out an expedition to search for the hid
den wealth and a n"-*bf>r of Pittsburg
capitalists be-came interested In it. The
result of it was that the Vine was char
tered to carry the party of treTsure
hunters and I was sent as the leader of
the expedition. The chart Young re
ceived from his father-in-law was cor
rect. It led us direct to the spot, but
the circumstances were such that we
could not disturb it.
"Tn the first place we werp afraid to
take it from the island without a prop
er agreement with the Government
thnt now controls thf 1 little piece of
land In the middle of the Pacific. Be-
Fides the crew of our vessel waf such
that we could not trust it. Captain
Hums did not treat us as he agreed
t<> when we chartered his vensel. Then
It would have required considerable
work to pet the treasure out of the
ground. The heavy rains that fall on
the islands nlmcst continuously have
changed the topography of the country
and tons and tone of earth have been
carried by the floods find deposited
over the spot where the wealth lies hid
den. It would take many days for our
party to uncover it. When we go back
we will have a big: force of workmen
with ue, and we will make the trip in
r steamer that will be under our con-
trol entirely.
"Our party arrived at Cocos Island
on the Vine on January 3. As soon
as the anchor was down eight of us
landed and we were met on the beach
by Captain Gessler, who, on finding out
our mission. Informed us he represent
ed the Government of Costa Rica and
that he was the Governor of the isl
and. He said if we wanted to search
for the treasure we must treat with
him first. He said his Government re
quired from all seekers for the treasure
an agreement that should it be found
one-third of the recovered wealth
should go to the Government. One
eighth of the remainder was to be
given to him, and the finder could have
the balance. The next day Gessler
came on board the Vine and a contract
to that effect was drawn up and exe
cuted. After the contract was signed
Professor H. St-"â*- + the civil engi
neer of the party, and myself made a
secret survey of the island according
to our chart and we concluded we were
on the right track.
"We found the land marks described
in the chart we had and with the com
pass had little difficulty in walking di
rect to the place where the treasure
lies buried. We, however, were not
satisfied to unearth it owing to the cir-
cumstances under which we were
placed, and as a blind we changed the
figures of our chart to some extent
and in the company of Captain Gessler
and some of the members of the crew
we ran lines away from the hiding
place of the treasure and made believe
we were hunting for it when we dug
two small holes in the sand."
Cocos Island is situated in 5 degrees
32 minutes and 57 seconds north lati
tude, and 87 degrees, 2 minutes and 10
seconds west longitude. The discovery
of the island is involved in obscurity.
It was visited by such early navigators
as Lionel Wafer and Dampier. Its
exact position was first made known
in 1791 by some Spanish exploring ship.
It was surveyed two years later by
Captain Coluett. Two years later Van
couver visited the island and also made
surveys. The island is about twelve
miles in circumference and about four
and a half m^les across at its broad
est place. Several detached rocks and
islets surround it. The island is a high
one and it can be seen by navigators
sixty miles away. From the eastward
the southern part of the island seems
to rise abruptly from the sea in steep,
rugged cliffs. The northern side is
indented with small bays that afford
fair anchorage for vessels. Chatham
bay and Wafer bay are the names of
the two most important of the inlets.
It was in Wafer bay that the fortune
hunters say Captain Keaton anchored
the Mary Dea when he landed there
with the treasure stolen from the Pe
ruvian Government. It is also said to
be on the shores of this bay that the
wealth is hidden.
RECORDS MUST BE PRINTED.
Supervisors Nor County Clerk Have
Discretion in Appeal Cases.
The Supreme Court has decided that
County Clerk Curry will have to print
ajid transmit to that tribunal copies in
appeal cases, whether the Supervisors
make sufficient appropriations for such
purposes or not. The question grew out
of the case of John Black, who was con
victed of a felony and appealed from
the judgment of Judge "Wallace. The ap
peal was allowed and bill of exceptions
settled. Under the law the County Clerk
is compelled to have printed a record of
the proceedings, and this Mr. Curry re
fused to do, stating that the Supervisors
had only appropriated $2000 for such pur
poses and the amount had been exhaust-
COCOS ISLAND, THE HIDING-PLACE OF THE
INCAS' STOLEN TREASURE.
According to the story told by Willis Aumock, one of the returned for
tune-seekers, the lost gold and jewels lie buried in the side hill almost in a
direct line with the flagstaff.
cd. Meanwhile Black remained in jail,
and his attorney, H. Cook, applied to the
Supreme Court to have Mr. Curry com
pelled to send up the printed records.
Mr. Curry made answer to the effect that
the fund was exhausted and he could not
get any of the printers to do the job,
they fearing that they could not get their
pay.
In their decision yesterday the Justices
hold that the Supervisors have no right
to make any special appropriation for the
purpose in question, the Legislature
directing in no uncertain terms that the
county must have records in appeal
cases printed and sent to the Supreme
Court. The decision concluded:
Section 1246 further provides that the
cost of the printing shall bo a charge
against the county, and the county is not
exempt' from liability therefor by a
failure of the Board of Supervisors to set
apart a sufficient fund therefor. Whether
the cost of the printing shall be paid by
the Clerk in the first instance, or
whether the pernon doing the work shall
present his claim therefor to the Board
of Supervisors is immaterial. The statute
makes it a charge against the county,
and, as the Incurring of the expense is
not within the control of the Board of
Supervisors, it is not competent for
that body to determine the amount
that shall be expended therefor, or by
setting apart an insufficient fund ab
solve the Clerk from his duty to cause
the record to be printed and transmitted
to the clerk of this court. The order
asked for Is granted.
The Xreling Troubles.
The case of Martin Kreling and his son
William, charged with using vulgar lan

the dispute about the furniture factory
will be amicably adjusted.

THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 1898.
THE LAWYER
EXPLAINED
Attorney Gillis Told Why
He Gave Bad Advice
to the Cooks.
But He Did Not Mean Any
Disrespect to Judge
Morrow.
Contempt Proceedings in the Lumber
Cases at an End Except for
the Judgment.
Hervey Lindley went on the stand
yesterday in the United States Circuit
Court and explained the bill of sale
transaction between him and John R.
Cook of the Klamath River Lumber
and Improvement Company.
"It was a question of perfecting our
title to the property which includes this
logging railway, the chutes, etc.," said
Mr. Lindley. "John R. Cook was in
debt, and the title of the property was
in him personally and was held by him
I presume for his company. On ac
count of the danger of attachment at
the hands of Cook's creditors, and the
consequent tying up of the railroad, Mr.
Cook conveyed the railroad to me. I
thereupon made a memorandum agree
ment reconveying the property to Will
Cook and John E. Cook, this memoran
dum to be held by me; and it was made
for the purpose of the proper transfer
of the property at the time of the expir
ation of the lease.
"I put the paper away and had not
seen it for more than a year when I
went on the stand yesterday. Yes
terday I testified to the best of my
memory and belief that it had not been
signed or executed. I telegraphed for
the paper and it came this morning,
and on inspecting it I saw that it had
been signed and acknowledged, but
that it had never been delivered. It
is not an executed document. 1 testi
fied yesterday to the best of my knowl
edge and belief, and there was noth
ing for me to gain by misrepresenting
the matter."
Attorney H. B. Gillis was placed on
the stand for the purpose of explain
ing why he had advised the Klamath
people to disobey the restraining order
of United States Circuit Judge Morrow.
He deemed that it was his duty to his
clients and to the court, he said, not
to yield up any more of their rights
than he was obliged to. He had told
the Deputy United States Marshal that
he did not understand that the order
required them to give up possession of
the property. It was not until after
consulting with the other attorneys for
the Klamath Company that a doubt
arose in his mind as to the propriety
of the advice he had given the Cooks.
He had left a gang of armed men in
the mill, to hold technical possession,
not to have a crowd of men there to
bulldoze or scare people, but simply to
hold technical possession so that their
legal rights might be preserved.
"The Cooks have followed my advice
as I had given it, and if any contempt
has been committed it has come
through my advice," continued Mr
Gillis. "I didn't think that the restrain
ing order required us to give up all
possession of the premises and prop
erty involved, but I considered that the
order was made for the purpose of
preventing us from interfering with
any property of which we had con
structive possession."
"You advised the Cooks to hold the
mill by force of arms if necessary?"
asked Mr. Pillsbury of the witness.
"Yep, sir."
"After you had read the restraining
order of the Circuit Court?"
"Yes, sir. As soon as I had a con
sultation with Messrs. Stratton & Den
son we sent a dispatch ordering that
no- more men should be put into the
mill and to take out those who were in
there."
After the witness had left the stand
Judge Morrow remarked that whenever
there is any question as to the mean
ing or authority of a restraining order
a motion should be made to dissolve
the injunction. Whenever lawyers are
in doubt about such matters they go to
the court for enlightenment.
Attorney Pillsbury, for the Pokegama
Sugar Pine Lumber Company, said that
if any of the attorneys on the other
side had gone to the court the next day
they could have been Informed as to
the court's idea of the scope of the re
straining order.
The matter was taken under advise
ment, and the court directed that the
restraining order should remain in
force under the final disposition of the
dispute.
Three Smali Failures.
J. W. Porter, living at 2229^ Sutter
street, has failed for $347 30.
Carl H. Burg and Amelia Burg, who
were engaged in the livery stable busi
ness, have failed for $1437 07. Their assets
consist of $320, including $70 outstanding
bills.
S. Poulsen, a blacksmith at 870 Howard
street, has failed for $1815 12, with $210
assets.
IN THE WAKE OF THE FREE TRADE,
The schooner Altair has been fitted out to hunt for the "Island of Gold"
of which H. Talbot Watson and his British associates have gone in search.
Captain Gilbert of the Altair says he alone has the exact location of the
El Dorado, and that Captain Moore of the Free Trade has only a general
idea.
THE PASSING OF
CAPT. MASTERS
Died Suddenly at Home
in Alameda Last
Thursday.
Had Cleared His Ship and Was
Ready to Sail for Santa
Rosalia.
A Cut Hate Steamship War Between
SÂ«n Francisco and. Copp -r
River Begun.
Captain George W. K. Masters, the
well-known and popular master of the
barkentine Garden City, died very
suddenly at his home in Alameda
Thursday evening last. He was around
town all of Thursday and cleared his
vessel for Santa Rosalia. He engaged
one of Spreckels' tugs to take him to
sea yesterday, but the news of his
death countermanded the order.
Captain Masters was one of the best
known skippers trading in and out of
this port. He brought the ship Bar
ing Bros, out here from the East, but
left her to go into the coasting trade
in one of the Simpson Lumber Com
pany's vessels. For a number of years
he has been master of the Garden City.
His figure was a familiar one on the
water front, as he always did his travel
ing ashore on a bicycle. The "bike"
went with him every voyage and as
soon as port was reached Captain Mas
ters took it ashore and used it while the
barkentine was being discharged and
loaded. Heart disease carried him off.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's Orizaba arrived from Mexican
ports at an early hour yesterday morn
ing. As soon as her cargo has been
discharged she will be put in the Eu
reka trade relieving the steamer Homer
which has been under charter to the
steamship company. The steamer Cur
acoa, which Captain Goodall recently
purchased in the East, has been thor
oughly overhauled and refitted through
out; she will take the Orizaba's place
in the Mexican trade.
Chief Steward O. N. Clark of the
steamer Alameda underwent a very
painful operation yesterday. A slight
swelling on his neck has been gradually
increasing in size of late and several
physicians have advised him to have it
cut out. Dr. G. M. Hall, the ship's
surgeon, got him to consent to an ope
ration and yesterday morning he
brought forth his case of instruments
and before Mr. Clark knew what was
going on the operation was successfully
over. He is still going about the ship
as though nothing had happened.
They had a mishap at the launching
of a small stern-wheel steamer in Oak
land yesterday. The little vessel is to
go to Kotzebue Sound on the schooner
Charles Hanson and was to be launched
from the foot of Market street. Just
as she was sliding into the waters of
the creek the ways broke and the stren
wheeler dropped stern first into the
mud. A derrick had to be erected and
the steamer lifted bodily. She was
then placed on an even keel in the
water and the launching was over.
Rate cutting has begun in earnest.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company
and the Johnson-Locke Company have
agreed upon a uniform rate to meet the
cut made by the Seattle steamship
owners. The old rate from San Fran
cisco to Copper River was $100 first
class and $75 second class. A reduc
tion of $10 has been made in the first
das* and $15 in the second. From
Seattle to Copper River the old rate
was $90 and $70 and a cut of $20 has
been made in both classes. It is ex
pected that a rate war between here
and Dyea and Skaguay will begin in a
few days.
The schooner Florence, Captain
Peterson, will sail in a few days for St.
Michael. On her arrival there she will
be turned into a stern-wheel steamer
and dredger combined, and will start
up the Yukon. A party of pix all told
are going In her to Beck their fortunes
in the frozen north.

transfer men who make their head
quarters at the ferries, has a very poor
opinion of women's gratitude. Yes
terday a well-dressed woman made a
run from a Valencia-street car toward
the racetrack ticket office. In her mad
rush she dropped her purse, and Cohen,
coming along a few minutes later,
picked it up. He opened it to see if he
could find any traces of the owner and
discovered $60 in gold and three dia
mond rings. Just as he was handing
his find over to the police officer on the
beat the woman came running back,
crying, "Oh! I've lost my purse." She
described the missing- article when
questioned, and Cohen's find was hand
ed over to her. When she found every
thing as when she lost it her expres
sions of thanks were very pro-fuse, but
her gratitude only took the form of two
10-cent pieces, which Cohen refused to
accept, saying she would probably need
carfare home from the races.
Captain W. C. Coulson, inspector of
the life-saving stations on the coast,
left on a tour of inspection along the
northern coast yesterday.
OUTDOES THE
LUXURIOUS ANNA
Mine. Melba Travels in a Spe
cial Train, the Dancer Has
Only One Car.
A Short Season of Grand Opera to
Commence at the California
Next Week.
In connection with the coming to the
California on the 19th tost of the prima
donna Mmc Melba, it may be interesting
to note some of the features of her mode
of traveling. Mme. Melba's train is com
posed of an engine und live coaches, ar
ranged as follows: Two baggage cars,
two Pullman sleepers and Mme. Melba's
own private car, "Melba," which is a
palace on wheels. This car was named
specially in honor of Mme. Melba and is
replete in everything that would enhance
the comfort and convenience of the
charming songstress even in the remotest
degree. No princess ever traveled in
greater style than does Melba, and no
doubt the coming of her train at the
various places at which she is to appear
will excite much curiosity.
Mme. Melba has her own piano on
board, and she often takes occasion to
sing a few ballads for those of her ftom
pany who may happen to be with her
and to look over the rolos of the various
grand operas which she expects to pro
duce during her tour through the great
West.
The members ol Mme. Melba's company,
including Mile. Toronta, Mme. Mattfeld,
Mme. Van Cauteren, Mr. Van Hoose, M.
Salignac, Signor Campanari, Mr. Rains,
Signor Vivianl and Signor Bimboni, will
also traveh in state, being provided with
the very best accommodations that well
regulated Pullman sleepers afford. The
train will be light enough to be adapted
to fast travel between stopping points,
and .will go through as a "special' dur
ing the entire tour of over 10,000 miles,
which extends from Chicago to San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles by way of the
Union and Central Pacific lines, return
ing by way of the Northern Pacific line,
stopping en route at Portland, Seattle,
Tacoma, Butte, St. Paul and MAneapolis.
"It has long been my ambition to ex
plore your great Western country," siiid
Mme. Melba the other day. "The fame
and glory of the Rocky Mountain scenery
have spread all over the civilized world,
and to come to America without seeing
the Rockies would be as unfruitful and
dissatisfying as a visit to Buffalo, N. V. ,
without going to see the stupendous Falls
of Niagara. All the cities at which 1 ex
pect to stop have their especial interest
for me â Salt Lake City with its renowned
Mormon Temple, the Tabernacle, which I
am told will hold 16.000 people and in
which I expect to sing; Sun Francisco
and the Golden Gate, the principal sea
port of the Pacific Coast and metropolis
of the West; Los Angeles, the winter
home of American pleasure-seekers; Se
attle, Portland and Tacoma. with their
varied attractions. With all these in
store for me I am sure the prospect is all
that heart cowkl wish for."
Mme. Melba is a charming woman, and
no doubt her admirers in the great West
â \\ill accord her a most enthusiastic wel
come.
A Librarian Dead.
William Williams, who for many years
was connected with the San Francisco
Free Library, and recently was assistant
in the catalogue department, died at Indio
yesterday of consumption. He was 25
years of age. Mr. Williams for a long
period of his connection with the library
was assistant in the reference room and
won many friends by his kindness of man
ner and desire to assist all who were In
search of books or information. He leaves
a mother in this city. His loss is se
verely felt by all connected with the li
brary.
CAPTAIN BRANT
SEEKS DIVORCE
Desertion Is the Ground
Alleged for Legal Sep
aration.
Twenty-Five Years of Married
Life, but Little Har
mony.
Both Farties Are Well Known in
Army and Social Cir
cles.
On Wednesday last a divorce com
plaint was filed in the County Clerk's
office by Louis Philip Brant against |
Grace Paulding Brant, and back of this
legal procedure is a story running
through several decades and involving
the names of prominent warriors and one
of the first families of New York City.
There is nothing sensational in the com
plaint, a mere recital of facts, the logical !
deduction from which is desertion on the
part of the wife, and for this Louis j
Philip Brant prays that a 'court of Cali
fornia sever the matrimonial bonds j
which have united him with Grace
Paulding for over twenty-five years.
Louis Philip Brant is at present cap
tain of Company A, First Infantry, U.
S. A., now stationed at the Presidio. His
martial reputation has been earned on
the field of battle, and his record as a
brave and undaunted soldier places him
well up in" the lists of American officers.
Kis wife also comes from a family the
men of which have sought the bubble
reputation at the cannon's mouth.
Twenty-five years ago Grace Pauldng
moved in the exclusive and wealthy
circles of New York, a woman whose
hand was sought by the gilded youth and
the more substantial specimens of the
genus homo. Of her many suitors the
fortunate one was the then Lieutenant
Brant, just graduated from West Point.
He stormed the citadel and carried away
the prize in the face of many odds, for
Miss Paulding was reared In luxury and
extravagance and the young lieutenant
had nothing to his name but the pay and
military title which went with his
shoulder-straps.
Soon after the marriage Mrs. Brant
was left a fortune of $200,000. The hus
band was then stationed in ' New York
and the marital relations were all that
could be desired. Then came an order
from the army headquarters which sent
the lieutenant from the city, where
metropolitan refinements and luxuries
were a component part of his life, to the j
frontier, where the Indians were revel
ing in their wild savagery. The life of i
the barracks was not for the wife, and
the first estrangement occurred on her
refusal to accompany him. Periodically I
the lieutenant returned to his wife on |
leaves of absence, but nothing could in- i
duce Mrs. Brant to give up her life in j
New York. This continued until 1885, !
when she moved to Paris, making the j
gay French capital her home. For sev
eral years she remained away from j
home. On her return to this country she !
discovered that her fortune, whichh had
been left in the form of a trust, had been
dissipated by poor investments. But her
old existence still went on. General
Dodge, the husband of her sister, domi
ciled Mrs. Brant in his home, and the
separation of husband and wife was un- j
broken.
For what reasons Captain Brantâ for
at this time the young officer through
good conduct on thf frontier had ad
vanced two pegs in the military system â
does not know, his wife wrote him a con
ciliatory letter, expressing a wish to live
with him, hut with the proviso that he
should install her in a home in the most
fashionable part of San Francisco. He
was at this time stationed at Angel Isl
and. This condition his slender re
muneration at the hands of tht Govern
ment would not allow him to satisfy, and
his answer was made accordingly.
All relations at this time ceased until
several weeks ago, when Mrs. Brant
brought an action for divorce in New
York City for limited alimony. The cap
tain responded by bringing a similar ac
tion in this city. The lawyers say that
he is out of the jurisdiction of New" York;
that he is domiciled here and personal
service must be brought upon him be
fore the matter can be adjudicated. Both
husband and wife are well-known people,
the former for his position In the army,
the latter for her connection with great
military and social families.
There is one child of the union, a
young man, 21 years of age.

ALL ARE BRINGING GIFTS.
Donations and Money for the Masonic Festival
Coming From Every Side.
Past Grand Master E. Peabody, Treasurer of the Festi
val Committee.
THE enthusiasm over the coming Masonic festival is not by any means
confim-o. to the Masons; it is gradually extending until it is laying
hold of men who never thought of Joining the order, and in every
way they can they are helping things along.
The merchants, irrespective of creed or fraternal affiliations, have
brought forward articles of varying values to be exposed for sale in the
booths. Sherman & Clay have donated an upright piano; Kohler & Chase
have given an organ; Newman & Levinson figure on one hundred and fifty
different books, proof that as many ladies of the collection committees
called, and that they called not in vain; Louis Roesch has donated stamped
and engraved envelopes, engraved note cards and s uvenir postals sufficient
to last the pavilion postofflce for the greater part of the festival and there
are many others. ho in one way or anoth- have so far assisted nobly
Although the festival is nearly a month away ihose in charge are en
gaged, to the practical exri sion MMI other business, in. the preparations
The office of Charles L. Patton whic'i once was the haunt of the client and
the litigant, is now daily thronged with chairmen of committees men vuh
festival bills, men seekin contracts, offering plans, discussing projects plan
ning booths and decorations, things to sell and thin-s to see- offering advice
or seeking tickets; looking for floor space or for concessions; wanting every
thing in fact that vivid imaginations cgn suggest, and Mr Patton is ex
pected to attend to it all. It is lucky that his committees are wisely se
lected and willing to work.
Over the sacred portal of the Temple there is a big sign as large and
sensational as a circus poster, announcing to all that there is the head
quarters for the festival with a size of type and a vr^ety of ink that leads
to the inference there Is nothing else In the building but >adquarters
The treasury of the festival committee is getting fat as a stone Jug
Peabody, the treasurer, declares he has several thousand douan already

when the festiv 1 is ovor. Two stone jugs will not resemble the money

with the weight of all the gold.

At the Presidio yesterday the follow
ing circular was posted:
I'RKSIDIO OF SAN FRANCISCO.
April 8. im.
Circular: Until further orders officers
will not leave the post without special
permission from the commanding officer.
By order of COLONEL. MILES.
E. E. BENJAMIN, First Lieutenant
and Adjutant.
Colonel Miles was seen at Presidio
i headquarters yesterday afternoon. In
! reply to inquiries he said that he had j
: received no orders directing the regi-,
ment to change station, but remarked",
in response to further questions that
1 he had been in telegraphic communi
cation with General Shafter. but added
that no orders had been received direct
from Washington. He said all the of
fleers In command of stations were â 
provided with cipher codes and that
: the cipher was used in transmitting
orders of an important character.
In regard to the readiness of the reg
! iment to move Colonel .Miles said: "The
regiment is ready to move at once. We
could start within four hours after the
receipt of orders, or at least as soon
as rations could be issued. Every
thing else is in readiness. Should the '
order come to-night the regiment could
leave on the train to-morrow morning '
for any point designated. We may be
ordered away from here any time, but
I can hardly believe that the First,
which is the only regular regiment of
infantry in this department, will be
ordered away from the Pacific Coast." !
When asked as to the ability of a
National Guard regiment to perform
guard and other garrison duty at the i
reservation Colonel Miles remarked :
that the State troops could perform i
this kind of service.
It is ascertained from other sources
that preparations for a forward move
ment have been quietly going on for
the past forty-eight hours. Ammuni
tion, camp equipage, cooking utensils

and kits are ready. The enlisted men
fully understand that something Im
portant In the way of change of station
is in contemplation.
T>>-day the First Infantry will parade
In heavy marching order for inspection,
and before night the order to move
may come. Officers of the regiment
know that secret Instructions have
been conveyed to the commanding
officer, but they can hardly believe
that the regiment will be ordered out
of the department. The orders against
any officer leaving the post without
special permission from the command
ing officer of the garrison is regarded
as significant. This order usually pre
cedes the order for a change of sta
tion. It is known that Colonel Miles
would not post such directions if he
were not convinced that an order
might be received any hour for the
regiment to leave the Presidio fora
distant station.
Directions have been received from
the Secretary of War enjoining greater
secrecy in regard to > ontemplated '
movements of the troops. The rule ap- I
piles to the engineer, ordnance and
quartermaster corps and all other de
partments of the military service. The
most accurate information obtainable
is to the effect that the depot quarter
master of San Francisco has already
I arranged for the transportation of the
j First Infantry, but the negotiations
have been conducted without taklag
the public into army confidence.
At the Pesldio mounted guards patrol
the roads and avenues of approach to
the vicinity of the ten and twelve inch
guns and the pneumatic dynamite guns
of Fort Point. Pedestrians and occu
pants of vehicles are not permitted to
halt in front of these immense weapons
of war without being accosted and or
dered to move on by the sentinel who
slowly walks his post on top of the
fortifications. The visitors are ex
cluded from the barracks at Fort "Win
fleld Scott. The old fort will shortly be
put in repair for the accommodation of i
artillery troops.
The impression that the First United I
I States Infantry will soon be ordered to
the front is strengthened by the knowl- i
; edge that Governor Budd has been in i
communication with the War Depart
ment regarding the ability and readi
ness of regiments of the National
Guard to take the place of regular
; troops. Speaking on this topic yester
[ day, the Governr-r said that the selec
â  tion of a regiment of State troops for j
service at the Presidio would rest in a j
great measure with the adjutant-gene- â 
; ral. The Governor understands that a
division of the Naval Reserve will soon |
: be ordered to duty on the Monadnock.
Adjutant-General Barrett, who was :
in Napa last night, was interviewed by i
The Call, The announcement that the
First United States Infantry would
' probably be ordered very soon to the ',
â  scene of active operations was not un- i
expected by the adjutant-general. '
When asked If he could now designate
1 the regiment of State troorps that would \
1 be assigned to duty at the Presidio, he j
remarked that he would not like to say
offhand without consulting Governor
Budd, Major-General Dickinson and '
Brigadier-General Warfield. He was j
j sure, however, that one of the regi- ;
; ments of the Second Brigade would be
cht-sen. He was convinced that the ;
State troops were fully capable of per- !
forming the infantry duties of the gar
rison, and had no doubt that the regi
ment which should be selected would
perform the service cheerfully.
General Barrett's attention was
called to the statement from Washing
ton that National Guardsmen would
have the first opportunity to volunteer
for service at the front and those that
did not volunteer could remain at home
with their respective militia organiza
tions. He was asked If Naval Reserve
men who should be assigned to duty
on the Monadnock would be permitted !
to volunteer for service on the Atlantic.
The adjutant-general said he was not \
prepared to answer the question at
present, but would have to make in
quiries on that point himself. Re- '
sponding to other inquiries he said that
the Naval Reserve was well supplied '
with ammunition and that the equip- j
ment of Lee rifles was complete and
first class.
To-day Governor Budd, Adjutant-
General Barrett and Brigadier-General
Warfield will probably confer on the
subject of assigning State troops to
duty. Members of the guard fancy
that Colonel Smith's First Infantry, N.
G. C. will be assigned to duty at the
Presidio, although it is conceded that
no regiment is better prepared for im
mediate and active service than the
Fifth Infantry, commanded by Colonel
Fairbanks. Either command would
perform the guard and garrison duty at
the Presidio.
General Shafter, U. S. A., command
ing this department, was in Bakersfleld
yesterday, where he was interviewed
by The Call correspondent. The general
ha<i no information to give out regard
ing military movements. It is known
that his trip to San Diego was made
for the purpose of inspecting the forti
fications at Ballast Point.
Lieutenant Babbitt of the Ordnance
Corps is conducting experiments at
Fort Point with powder for the big
guns. Target practice of the Fourth
Cavalry is in progress at the Presidio
range. Owing to the fog yesterday
morning firing at the 1000-yard range
could not be conducted in a satisfac
tory manner.
LORD COLERIDGE'S UMBRELLA
DECISION.
The law as to umbrellas was settled
once for all by Lord Coleridge in a
leading English case. His lordship
held:
"Umbrellas, properly considered, are
a part of the atmospheric or metero
logical condition, and, a's such, there
can be no individual property right in
them. In Sampson vs. Thompson, de
fendant was charged with standing on
plaintiff's front steps during a storm
and thereby soaking up a large quan
tity of rain to which plaintiff was en
titled. But the court held that the rain
was any man's rain, no matter where
it fell. It follows, therefore, that the
umbrella is any man's umbrella. In all
ages rain and umbrellas have gone to
gether, and there is no reason why they
should be separated in law. An um
brella may, under certain circum
stances-jthe chief of which is posses
sionâtaKe on the attributes of personal
property, just as if a man set a tub and
catch a quantity of rain water, that
rain water will be considered as his
personal belonging while it is in his
tub. But if the sun evaporate the wa
ter and it is rained down again, or if
the tub be upset and the water spilled,
then the attribute of personal owner
ship instantly disappears. So if a man
hold his umbrella in his hand it may
be considered a personal belonging, but
the moment it leaves his hand it re
turns to the great, general, indivisible,
common stock of umbrellas, whither
the law will not attempt to pursue it."
So far as we know there has never
been a successful appeal from this de
cision. â Chicago News.

THE REMINISCENT WAITER.
Edward Harriaan Drops Into Coffee John's and Meets
an Old Acquaintance,
THE hour was so late that the solitary stranger who had entered Coffee
John's select rotisserle on Pacific street was obliged to rap three times
with the handle of the knife he had helped himself to before he suc
ceeded in rousi: % the somnolent waiter, who was quietly dozing on the
chair that he had tilted against the wall at the end of the place.
Finally his efforts were rewarded by signs of animation in the figure
which, muttering to itself, first stretched one leg then the other, then
slowly opened its eyes, one at a time, and, after gazing blankly into space
for a moment or two, suddenly seemed to become aware of the presence of
a customer it had not before seen and whom it was obliged to serve, and,
with a smothered cur:e, it arose to its full height of nearly six feet of ema
ciation and moved in a surly manner down the aisle until it came to the
occupied table, at which it stopped, and, resting one hand on the board and
the other on its hip said: "What'll it be?" "Coffee," was the laconic an
swer. "Coffee goes,' 1 replied the waiter, and he at once seemed to jump into
life, for raising his voice he shouted as though he was leading a storm
ing party against the walls of Morro Castle, "Coffee," and started with
surprising alacrity in the direction of the kitchen, whence he soon emerged
with a cup of dark-looking liquid, which, together with two doughnuts, he
deposited before the customer and was about to move away when nis glance
rested for the first time on thp features of that individual.
The effect was electrical. He sto ped short, a smile, which enveloped
his entire chin, spread itself over his countenance and leaning over the
table he said: "I'll be if it ain't old Ned Harrigan. Yer ain't forgot
me, have yer, Ned? Put it there. I'm Cinders, wot used ter be er boatman
on der front when yer was er worktn' at yer trade as er caulker. Gawd

SOUTHERN PACIFIC
LOSES BY FIRE
Pattern Storehouse and Its
Contents at Sacramento
Destroyed.
Will Take Many Years to Duplicate
the Models Consumed by
Flames.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April S.â The pattern
storehouse of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, a large three-story building on I
street, between Front and Second, was
entirely Rutted by fire to-night. The loss
is practically incalculable, being estimated
at anywhere between (300,000 and $1,000,000.
All of the patterns used in the railroad
shops since they were first built, except
those being used in the foundries at tue
present time, went up In the flames, and
to duplicate any article of molding now
in use will necessitate the making of new
patterns from the drawings on file in the
office of the master patternmaker. There
were at least 40.0U0 patterns in the build
ings, and all were consumed.
While the origin of vie fire is not known
with certainty, it Is believed to have been
started from the heating pipes winch ran
through the building. It is estimated that
it would take twenty men twenty-five
years to duplicate the patterns destroyed.
It is extremely prooable that the loss
of the patterns will cause a big lay-off in
the shops, as molders cannot possibly
work until patterns have been made.

MAGUIRE AND "BILLY" MASON.
Washington Capitol.
Mason Is a sort of story-tellers' magnet.
Anecdotes cluster about him like iron
filings about a lodestone. One reason for
this is that he has always something to
say. There was that episode of mi with
the hotel clerk. Some men would nave
been embarassed after an encounter of
that kind, seeing their names in all the
papers which a clipping bureau can get
hold of. Mason wasn't; not a bit. He
met a newspaper man not long afterward,
and when the newspaper man asked him
now he came to get into that sort of
scrap he said tha Senator Cullom hud
been attracting so much attention lately :
| with his dog tight that it seemed about
tune for some other Senator to have a
chance at the public eye.
Lately he ..as been winding Congress
man Maguire of CaMxorola. up in his
! tangle of anecoote. Congressman Maguire '
: is snort, fat, curly-haired and looks rather
like .Mason. Sot long ago a man collared
him, metaphorically, of course, in the
corridor, and said:
I "Can 1 have a minute with you? There's
that matter, you -now, that you promised '
to help me about."
Maguire said he didn't remember any- â 
thing about it. :
,This is in reference to thatâ that i
position you were going to help me get,"
went on the stranger.
Maguire said that he did not think he
had ever met his interlocutor.
"Why," said the office-seeker, "you got j
a job for my brother-in-law and balled
out my nephew, andâ"
Then a light began to dawn on the
Calif ornlan, and he said: "I am Congress
man Maguire of California. You will find
Senator Mason at the end of the hall."
About three minutes after he met a !
newspaper man, to whom he told his tale, :
and said that as near as he could remem
ber that was the twenty-ninui man who
had mistaken him for Senator Mason and
wanted help of some kind or other. And
they all said that the Senator had prom-
I ised them help, and acted most confidently
I that he would give it to themâ noi con
fident in that insistent, bold, whistle-to
keep-your-courage-up kind of a way, but
confident as people are when they have a
good friend whom they know and on
j whom they can depend. But it strikes me
I that if there are any men whom Senator
! Ma-son really does not want to see he
! might use Maguire very nicely as an
understudy, and it also occurs to me that
before Maguire understood the state of
the case there may have been people who
thought that Mason, in spite of uls cher
ubic air of innocence and good will, was
a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character,
who was one thing one minute and an
other the next, and could not in the least
be trusted.

now. With our barren uplands, our ;

how we may repair the senseless and
wasteful devastation of the past.â Phila- â

It was feared at first that this accident
was aggravated by rheumatism, which
ailment Mr. Updegraff was troubled with
some time ago in an unusually severe
form. In speaking of it he says:
"About two years ago I was stricken
with rheumatism, and for a year was se
verely troubled with it. It came on me
suddenly during the winter, I don't know
what caused it, unless it was exposure,
about the farm.
"It was the old fashioned rheumatism
and began in my lower limbs, gradually ''.
working up until my arms, hands and
fingers became affected. My body ached ;
all over, especially my limbs, which were
swollen and these by the following spring
Were almost entirely useless. I had to '
hire all my work done that spring and
summer, but did a little work In har
vest time.
"I must have done too much, for soon
after that I was confineu to my bed for
some time. I had the famllv doctor, but
he didn't do me any good. He finally said
he could not help me and advised "me to
try the baths, but I couldn't afford the
expense. Neither could I afford to be an
invalid all my life. Inquiries were made
at the drug store for something that
would be helpful in my case.
"The druggist recommended several i
things, and I tried some of them but '
was not benefited until I used Dr "Wil
tUttas' Pink Pills for Pale People, i gave !
this remedy a fair trial, as I did the ;
others, and soon discovered that it was
different from anytning I had tried
"I found that this was a medicine that '
did what was claimed for it. and when I
had taken about a dozen doses of the Dills
I found that they were helping me I
continued taking tnem. and I am glad to
day that I did. Why that medicine actu
ally cured me and I didn't take niore than
six or seven boxes either.
"It was In January. 1887, that I began
taking the medicine, and I was complete
ly cured by the first of March I beean
early in the spring to do my work arid I
kept it up all summer, not missing a day
I have never had any rheumatic trouble
with ray limbs from that day to this "
"Arid are you positive that it was Dr
Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People that
cured you?" asked the reporter.
"Positive, why of course I am. Nothing
else did it. I did not take any other med
icine at the time, and I was never better
until I began taking Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills for Pale People. I have taken noth- j
Ing else since, and of course they are
what did the work." Mrs. T'pdegraff i
agreed with her husband that "he was i
cured of a very severe case of rheuma- !
tism by these pills."
What better proof could a person want
than the above facts? This plainly shows ;
that Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale â 
People are unrivaled as a tonic for the !
blood. The secret of perfect health '
strength and beauty is pure blood, and I
impure blood is the foundation of most j
diseases.
One of the first to discover this fact <
was Dr. Williams, who years ago formu- |
lated a combination of vegetable reme- ]
dies which acts on the impure and im
poverished blood. Imparting those ele
ments that purify, vitalize and enrich It. !
thus aiding bodily functions, arousing j
every organ into heal'H'ul action, and in ',
this way restoring the entire system to
health and visor.
That Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Palo !
People do this has been attested to by
thousands all over our lar.d and in for- i
eign climes. These marvelous health re- !
storers are preserved by physicians. In
dorsed by druggists and used by people
everywhere.

Two Letters to Mrs. Pinkham.^
Mrs. Johk Williams, Englishtown, 1
N. J. , writes: , j
" Dear Mrs. Pixkham: â I cannot be-
gin to .tell you how . I suffered before
taking your remedies. I was so weak â  \
that I could hardly walk across the floor
without falling. I had womb trouble
and such a bearing-down feeling ; also
suffered with my back and limbs, pain,
in womb, inflammation of the bladder,
piles and indigestion. Before I had
taken one bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound I felt a great deal
better, and after taking two and one-
half bottles and half a box of your
Liver Pills I was cured. If more would
take your medicine they would f uoi
have to suffer so much." - ,
Mrs. Joseph Peterson, 513 East St.Â»
Warren, Pa., writes: ,-'Vv ? / j
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham: â I have suf-
fered with womb trouble over fifteen
years. v I had inflammation; enlarge-
ment and displacement of the womb.
I had , the â¢ backache constantly, , also
headache, and' was so dizzy. I had
heart trouble, it seemed as though my
heart was in my throat at times chok-
ing me. I could not walk around and
I could not lie down, for then my heart
would beat so fast I would feel as
though I was smothering. I had' to
sit up in bed nights in order to breathe.

Coffin Case at the
Start.
FARCE IN A LAW COURT.
No Desire Now to Use "the People"
In the Great Corporation
Contest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. April 8.
"I purpose to show that the
Board of Health of the city of
Oakland, and certain officers of
the present city government,
owe their appointment to the ac
tive influence of the Oakland
Water Company, and that these
proceedings were instituted
against Coffin by this water
company; that for a long time
prior to and after the present
Board of Health was appoint
ed the Oakland Water Company
was engaged in slandering the
water of the Contra Costa Com
pany, and that this suit is sim
ply a put-up job of the company
to hoodwink the people. I am
showing- the animus in this suit.
I am trying to show that the
Board of Health is simply the
tool of the Dingee people and
that Inspector Smith is the ex
ecutive officer of the Board of
Health. I don't say that the
water companies are hostile
now. Oh. no, they are two souls
Utterly harmonious; but I pur
pose to show that at the time
this complaint was filed there
was deadly hostility existing be
tween the two watercompanies."
Such was the opening statement of
Mr. Chapman's "purposes" this morn
ing, but the prosecution did not pur
pose that Mr. Chapman should carry
out such a vigorous programme, and
therefore the defendant was dismissed.
The trial of the Coffin case to-day
produced some peculiar testimony and
ended In a farcical manner. Harry
Melvtn, who represented the District
Attorney's office on behalf of the people,
had the thankless task of conducting a
prosecution in which the prosecutors
did not care to prosecute.
The main witness for the people was
Banltary Inspector Smith, and had he
been for the defense he could not have
made a better witness. Mr. Smith stated j
that in the complaint as filed in court
were allegations that he had never
â worn to; that the complaint was inter
lined after he had signeu it, and that j
had he seen it or had it been read to
him in the condition in which it was
filed he would never have sworn to it.
Ex -Mayor Chapman, who appeared j
for Coffin, turned Mr. Smith into a most !
excellent witness for the defendant,
and the prosecution was at the very
outset shown to have no case, llad the i
suit been tried at the time it was filed
in the fall of last year, when the rival
water companies were fighting for pat
ronage, it would have provoked a very
warm contest. Now the companies hay- :
Ing shaken hands there is no longer
any desire to prove on either side that j
the water of the other company is full ,
if microbes and pollution and conse
quently the Sanitary Inspector who ;
ewes his appointment to the Board of ,
Health which owes its appointment to
Mayor Thomas, who is commonly sup- j
posed to have been helped in his elec- I
tion by the water companies, certainly i
has no object in testifying contrary to \
the wishes of those who keep him in of
flee.
It was seen at the beginning that the
case was to be allowed practically to
fall through, as only J. H. T. Watkin
scm of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, of all the prominent witnesses
summoned, put in an appearance. He
did not hurt the case one way or the
other, his testimony being mostly
stricken out after he had left the
stand. It was the intention of Mr.
Chapman to have produced evidence to
show that Attorney Herrin of the
Water Front Company came over here
last spring, consulted with political
managers and water company mana
gers as to how Oakland should be gov
erned during the coming administra
tion, but, owing to the evident desire
not to hurt anybody, his plans were
thwarted, and after the prosecution
had put in its powerful side of the case
it was so eminently favorable to the
defendant that he was dismissed.
Mr. Coffin was charged with willfully
and all other kinds of ways polluting
n. public water supply against all kinds
"f public health, peace, dignity and
Mmilar civilrights. The evidence showed
that he had not polluted the wat
ers, that there was no water to pollute;
that if there had been any water it j
was not supplied to the people of the
city of Oakland, although it might have
got into the pipes in some manner, and
It was also pro-ved that Mr. Coffin was
rot the lessee of the premises, and that
If a nuisance consisting of the high
misdemeanor charged had been main
tained, it was maintained by John
Avala, who is a tenant of Coffin's, and ;
that therefore the allegations in the
complaint did not in any way concern
thÂ» man who had been arrested and
prosecuted.
Such is the fate of the case which
was begun by one of the water com
panies and which both of them were
anxious to quash when it came to trial.
Their anxiety was quickly relieved.

A YOUNG WIFE FREE.
Mrs. G. R. R. Ainsworth Is
Awarded Her Piano and Also
a Divorce.
OAKLAND, April S.â Captain George
R. R. Ainsworth was divorced to-day
from his girl-wife, and there will be no
sensational trial. The findings in the ea*e.
signed by Judge Hall, were filed this af
ternoon, and were very brief. They
merely stated that it was true that the
defendant married Ida Murphy, that there
were no children, that the charges of ex
treme cruelty were sustained, and touna
that judgment should be entered on be
half of the fair young plaintiff.
The final lindinp. therefore, gives to
Miss Ida Murphyâfor she is permitted to
resume her maiden nameâ the .piano she
so greatly craves, and nothing is said
about alimony or distribution of property.

A "JOKER" MAY
MAR THE PETITION
Attorney Davis Suspects a Re- i
quest of the C. C. Brock
Company.
On Its Face the Document Asks for a
Change In the Lines of the
Harbor.
OAKLAND, April S.â Following Is the
petition to change the pier-head lines of
the harbor that has been tiled by the C.
C. Brock Company with the Government
engineers:
The undersigned corporation, the C. C. Brock
Company, is a co-owner in sixteen vessels en
gaged in the bay and coastwise trade In and
around San Francisco, C'al.
We are advised that the Government engi
neers who established and laid out the exist
ing pierhead lines in Oakland, Oal., harbor,
inasmuch as the entire water front was at the
time of such survey and location claimed by a
private corporation, bo adjusted such pierhead
lines as not t.j trespass upon private property
for the purpose of avoiding condemnation pro
ceedings and like expenditures.
That since said lines were established, to-wit:
within the past ninety days, a decision has
been rendered by the Supreme Court of this
State which finally settles and determines the
holding of said corporation claimant, which
said decision leaves outside of said pierhead
lines and between them and the property of
said corporation a wide strip of water which
is declared to be in public ownership.
That said water front corporation and other
riparian owner* have the right, however, sub
ject of course to Federal supervision, to con
struct wharves out to said flrst established
pierhead lines.
That the corporation being: the riparian own
er In said harbor is about t.> subdivide and
sell Us water front holdings in said harbor,
which will invite and result in the construction
of a great number of wharves and permanent
improvements out to said pierhead lines and
on both yidet* of said harbor.
That the construction of *uch wharves will
greatly narrow said harbor and render it a
strip of water of varying width but averaging
to some 800 feet only.
That such narrowing will greatly increase the
cost of shipping from said harbor, inasmuch as
it will make towing in and out of said harbor
a necessity, and will prevent ships anchoring
in the stream, so Increasing dock charges.
That further, the selling and Improving of
said water front will largely increase the
commerce of said port, while it will diminish
the facilities for conducting such commerce,
and that, too, in localities most used by com
merce.
The imaginary lines now laid down in said
harbor offer no obstruction to commerce, and
litigation having heretofore suspended the con
struction of wharves, the full width of the
estuary has been and is to-day as much used
by commerce as though formally dedicated
thereto, which we, your petitioners, seek to
perpetuate and secure before extensive Im
provements will render the same less easy,
and perhaps impossible, to effect.
Your petitioners therefore pray that said
harbor lines may be widened so as to Include
within the established pierhead lines all pub
lic lands or waters therein, and so prevent the
construction of wharves beyond the line of
private ownership and forever preserve to com
merce the full width of said harbor.
And your petitioners will ever pray.

ALL ANXIOUS
FOR HARMONY
Young Men Republicans
Seem Unable to
Secure It.
Much Regret Over the Little
Unpleasantness at the
Hall.
Leaders Declare That the Affair Is
Not Possessed of Any Official
Significance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 8.
Five hundred young men, Republi
cans, are walking around to-day talk
ing on the street corners and in public
places and trying to discover what is
meant by "harmonizing."
There is good reason for the discus
sion. Last night there were two Re
publican Leagues. One waa led by
President Frank Bilger, the other by
President Pulcifer. To-day there are
all the way from four to six clubs,
Murray Laidlaw having developed into
a leader, while there are other fac
tions under disputed leaderships. For
a year the young men Republicans
have been misunderstanding each
other. A week ago one branch, consist
ing of about 350 members, organized
and elected Mr. Bilger. Last night
Harry Pulcifer, who was president of
an original Republican League, sent
out invitations to all the members of
all the young men's Republican leagues
to attend his meeting at Fraternal
Hall.
The response to his invitations over
came by about 350 his mo-si sanguine
expectations. The word was passed {
around among the members of the Bil- ;
ger League to turn out in force, and
they did so.
Mr. Pulcifer called the meeting to
order, but had no sooner done so than
there was some kind of a misunder
standing between him and Murray Laid
law, each of them having same sup
port. The 350 opponents to the Pulcifer
League had all gone there in the inter
ests of harmony.
The meeting had no sooner com
menced than the harmony began to
work. A party from the audience
jumped up on the platform and there
was a mix-up. So-me heavy blows were
struck, Bert Swan figuring in one little
contest, while some innocent members
ran their noses against fists without
any intention of doing so on their part.
Mr. Cal Ewing made an attempt to
speak in favor of harmony, but just
A MEMORIAL TO BISHOP KJP-
Window for t^e Chancel of the Good Samaritan
Mission.
The handsome chapel of the Cathedral Mission of the Good Samaritan at
Second and Folsom Btreets is to be further adorned by the addition of a
very handsome stained-glass window for the chancel, which will be un
veiled on EaÃter morning, April 10. Through the thoughtful kindness and
liberality of Mrs. Colonel Baldwin of New Haven, Conn., a relative of the
Rev. W. I. Kip Jr., who is minister in charge of the mission, this fine
work of art has been provided. Appropriately the window will be a me
morial of the first Episcopal Bishop of California. The window is in every
way worthy of the distinguished prelate whom it commemorates and iv
beauty of color and design will be surpassed by but few other specimens
of the art to be found anywhere. The subject of the illumination is Christ
healing the sick and is an almost perfect copy of Hoffmann's famous pic
ture. The unveiling of the window on Easter morning will be marked with
much ceremony. The execution of the window was intrusted to the United
Glass Works.
at this juncture somebody received a
blow on the lace that knocked him
backward and there was a crash, fol
lowed by the hissing of escaping gas.
One of the chandeliers in the hall had
been knocked down and confusion fol
lowed. Finally J. W. Stetson of the
opposition tried to make a speech, but
while he was doing so policemen at
tracted by the rioting went into the
hall and compelled the harmonizers to
disband.
Much regret is expressed to-day over
the event, and it is acknowledged on
all hands that it would have been bet
ter for the Bilger League, having al
ready claimed to be the genuine Young
Men's Republican League, to have
ignored Mr. Pulcifer's meeting alto
gether. As it is, both sides have suf
fered. The Bilger League has suf
fered in prestige, while the Pulcifer
League has been proved to be greatly
in the minority. The officers of the
Bilger League, including A. H. Breed,
its president, regret the incident and
declare that had not Mr. Pulcifer sent
out his invitations the members would
not have attended.
The matter to-day is being discussed
with more interest even than the Span
ish complications, and it is prognosti
cated that a few individuals who took
a prominent part would have better
for their political interests remained
away.

THRASHED HIS
WIFE'S LOVER
Rajas Found Aston in His
House Christmas
Day.
Quickly Acqu.tted of Battery
He Will Soon Get a
Divorce.
The Visitor Was Caught Hugging
and Kissing the De:endant's
Wife.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 8.
Many of the leading Portuguese res
idents at Alvarado were in Judge Hall's
courtroom to-day to hear and testify
in the divorce case brought by Guada
lupe Ilajas against his wife, Refugio A.
Rajas. The parties to the suit are
well known in the upper part of the
county and their trouble has aroused
great interest.
Rajas blames his neighbor, Philip
Aston, for breaking up his family and
in his story he tells of finding Aston in
I his home and of giving him a severe
\ thrashing. This occurred on Christ
j mas day. Rajas returned home and
! saw Aston kiss his wife. This was
' more than his patience could stand, so
| he used his fists on his wife's lover.
! Aston was foolish enough to have Ra
; jas arrested for battery and the trial, a
| few weeks ago, created quite a sensa
i tion in Judge Richmond's courtroom.
Rajas demanded a jury trial and a
1 jury of the most wealthy citizens was
impaneled, representing over a million
dollars.
Kajas took the stand in his own be
half, admitted the truth of the charge
and told his story to the jury. He said
he went home on Christmas day and
found Aston making love to his wife.
He had previously given Aston warn
ing to keep away, but the warning had
been disobeyed. Rajas said that he
did not feel inclined to kill Aston, so
he merely thrashed and gave him a
black eye. The jury promptly acquitted
him on the charge of battery and the
story was told in the Superior Court
to-day, as showing the standing of Mrs!
Rajas in the vicinity of his home.
The plaintiff had made out his case,
but as there are three daughters of
Mrs. Rajas by a former husband, it
was decided in their interest to mod
ify the allegations, and the complaint
when amended will be confined to
cruelty and neglect. Rajas will be
granted his divorce after his attorney,
ex-Judge E. M. Gibson, has amended
the complaint.
BASKET-BALL GIRLS.
They Are Beady for the Interstate
Fray This Afternoon.
BERKELEY, April B.â Half of Reno and
the whole of the University of Nevada
were at the Reno depot last night to shout
for the basket-ball team and to wish it
success. Passengers trying to sleep in the
Pullmans were roused when they reached
Nevada's metropolis by the free, loyal,
full-lunged Nevada boys' repeated good
by to the sagebrush co-eds.
Wah! Hoo! Wah!
Zip. Boop! Ah.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Nevada!
At Sixteenth street, Oakland, the sage
brush athletes were met by Mrs. Magee,
who Is to referee Saturday's game, and a
committee of two Berkeley co-eds. The
whole party, chaperoned by Mrs. .T. N.
Evans, wife of the president of the Board
of Regents of Nevada's university, and
Miss Bardenwerper, and accompanied by
wee, golden-haired, gray-eyed , Rowena
Evans, the Nevadans' mascot, proceeded
to the Cliff House, where luncheon was
served and all the sights > were enjoyed.
They will return to Reno Sunday evening.
'Miss- Mayme Merrit of Stanford has
consented to act as umpire of the great
game.
The Nevada team does not expect to
defeat the clever Berkeley girls.
"We are a new team," said pretty Cap
tain Louise Ward. "We've had only three
weeks' -practice, and we're particularly
unfortunate just now, because our best
player, Nell Lewers, is ill and had to be
left at home. Miss Mclntyre has kindly
jumped into the breach, and will play
right center. But she is out of practice,
having played only three times within the
past year. . Three of the team are just
recovering . from the grip. So you see
we're not in the best condition. Still, we
have excellent individual players, thougn
our team work isn't ail we'd wish it, to De,
and we intend to play as hard and as well
as we can. If we're beaten, our defeat
will teach us something, for Nevada Uni
versity girls haven't had an opportunity
to, see a game of basket-ball, much less
to take part in one against a trained
team."
The Berkeley co-eds are in excellent
training, and will play a very interesting
game. Should they succeed in carrying
oft the basket-ball honors, as is probable,
there will not be the slightest ill-feeling
between the two teams of fair athletes,
for the generous hospitality 01 Berkeley
has quite won the hearts of the Nevada
girls.
EDITOR HOPPER WROTH.
Charges Stanford Athletic Authori
ties With Using Methods Un
sportsmanlike and Dishonest.
BERKELEY, April 8. â Editor James
Hopper of the University Occident in to
day's issue of the college weekly charges
the athletic authorities at Stanford with
acting the part of wily diplomats and re
sorting to methods "unsportsmanlike, pet
ty, mean, dishonest and unworthy of a
great university." Hopper bases his
charges upon the refusal of the Stanford
tennis authorities to meet California's
representatives to arrange for an inter
collegiate tournament, and the determina
tion of Stanford's track athletic repre
sentative to protest Ray Carroll, one of
California's athletes, after announcing
that no such action would be pursued.
Editor Hopper's caustic denunciation of
Stanford's methods is in part as follows:
It seems, from all evidences, that Stan
ford athletics are directed by men who
play the wily diplomats. They delight in
puerile and mean ntue maneuvers, affect
deep distrust of our most natural actions,
counterplot darkly against the atrocious
schemes of their own imaginations. They
lose athletic agreements: they refuse to
ratify clauses of intercollegiate agree
ments proposed v tneir own representa
tives; they seek to evade the tennis tour
nament, or, at least, to delay it to tne
period of our exes. They seek success in
a tortuous and ridiculous Machiavellism
which is exasperating. This deplorable
tendency is evidenced in the method by
which they seek to deprive us of one of
our best athletes. Stanford University is
going to protest Ray Carroll at the next
P. A. A. meeting. This threat is not of
a nature to affright us into hysterics. The
charges against Carroll are ridiculous.
Ray Carroll acts as monitor at the Deaf
and Dumb Asylum. Among his multiple
duties is the one of leading the children
in the callsthenic exercises. It is this
heinous offense which is unbearable to
Stanford athletic Puritans and the cause
of the crusading wrath.
Now that the field day is imminent;
now that there is no time for investigat
ing the matter thoroughly, representa
tives of Stanford University suddenly
change their mind %nd announce their in
tention of protesting Carroll. Is this not
an answer to our question? Does not this
discover the purpose of Stanford men in
The fao-simile ytf L//^*,*?^ *â¢ Oli ever 7 "wrapper
signature of C#m//z7<CUcÂ£<AZ of CASTOEIA.
protesting Carroll? It certainly seems so.
It looks like a de.iberate attempt to be
smirch the brilliance of our victory by
false accusations, by insidious calumny;
it looks like an endeavor to halo the rÂ«Â«
diance of our success with false haze of
doubt and uncertainty. It is an attempt
to make our hard-won conquest unsatis
factory and questionable. It is a proceed
ing unsportsmanlike, petty, mean and dis
honest, unworthy of a great university.

Huntington's Reply.
At a recent meeting of the Board of
Supervisors, a resolution was passed
asking the Market-street Railroad Com
pany if it would pave that portion of
Market street with bitumen it is required
by law to keep in repair, to conform to
the rest of the street where it is proposed
to lay the new pavement. Yesterday
Clerk Russell received a brief reply
signed by H. E. Huntington, stating that
the directors had held their annual meet
ing just before the Supervisors' request
had been received, but that he would be
willing to meet any representative of the
board it might designate and talk the
matter over.
PRINTERS CLAIM
AN ADVANTAGE
One More Offics Reported to
Have Acceded to Their
Demands.
Other Unions Coming to the Front
With Promises of Assist
ance.
The striking printers claim tn have
made a slight gain, as it was stated yes
terday piat one more office had conceded
to the new scale of prices and had put
on a small force of union men to work
the nine houA at the same wages for
merly paid for ten. The Typothetae con
tradicts this statement emphatically and
claims that if there be any advantage it
is on its side of the house. None of the
offices are working with as large a force
as i dry carried last week, but that is ex
plained by the fact that the shops were
pushed to their full capacity to clear out
the old orders, and what orders have been
received since that time will be held back
as long as possible in the hope of a
speedy settlement of the difficulties.
Mr. Crocker said yesterday that a man
up north had wired him to the effect that
he had fifty men ready to ship down at
once, but he had .informed him that all
he wanted was three good pressmen, and
these were immediately sent to him.
They all proved to be competent men.
A story was published in a morning
paper yesterday to the effect that the old
hands had gone back in three offices at
the old scale of wages, but this is most
emphatically denied at the union head
quarters and notice was posted on the
bulletin board to the effect that the en
tire story was woven out of a tlssue-of
lies and the outlook was very encourWg
ing. To further strengthen this the em
ployes of two of the offices in question
appeared at headquarters and issued a
statement that "they were not working,
have not been working and will not re
sume work for the firm in question or any
other firm until the nine-hour work day
is conceded, and most respectfully and
.- trenuously protest against being placed
in a false position by any one." The of
fice where the men were reported to have
gone back, that of Upton Brothers, em
ployed live printers previous to the strike,
and but two of these, the foreman and
his brother, are now working. A mem
ber of the Typothetae is authority for
the statement that this foreman received
$24 per week previous to the strike, but is
now working for $15.
At the meeting of the Labor Council
last night the strike was the chief topic
and the paper which published the al
leged misleading statement was de
nounced in the bitterest terms. The dele
gates were Instructed to call the atten
tion of their respective unions to this
story and have action taken on it of such
a decisive nature that it will in future
publish labor items in a fair and impar
tial manner.
W. J. McArthur of the Sailors' Union
reported that he had received a commis
sion as organizer for the Western States
for the A. F. of L., and. as this would
take him to Utah during May he would
willingly represent the council at the
Western Miners' Association, to be held
in Salt Lake City early in that month.
He was granted credentials.
The varnishers and polishers also met
last evening and resolved to tender their
unqualified support to the printers in
their struggle and to do all in their power
to aid the cause both as an association
and as individuals.
Union No. 22, Carpenters and Joiners,
met last night and indorsed the action of
the printers in the heartiest manner. This
union has nearly 500 members, and when
a resolution was offered tendering the
full and unqualified support of the union
to tne printers it was carried unanimous
ly. The recognition which the card issued
by the Building Trades Council is meet
ing was also considered a matter for con
gratulation.

WANTS CALIFORNIA THEBE.
Special Commissioner B. W. Bichard
son Here for the Trans-Miss
issippi Exposition.
R. W. Richardson, a prominent lawyer
of Omaha and special commissioner to
California from the Trans-Mississippi
Exposition, is at the Palace, where he
arrived last night on the overland.
Mr. Richardson is here to see if he can
not interest the people of California,
through their Governor and large mer
cantile bodies, in the exposition he rep
resents. He wants the people here to
take active steps to see that their State,
which is the only State west of the Mis
sissippi that has not already done so, ba
fully as well represented at the exposi
tion as the others.
Mr. Richardson says he is not here in
the endeavor to raise or ask for money.
He wishes no appropriation for site or
buildings. All that will be taken care of
by the exposition authorities. He merely
wants the Chamber of Commerce, the
Mining Bureau, together with the Gov
ernor and other public and influential
officials, to use their influence to have all
the different industries of the State well
represented.
Mr. Richardson will probably remain
here several weeks.

Driveâ Favorites Went by the

The "run for Riley races" have com

won a mile and a sixteenth race at
Oakland yesterday ridden by young
Gray, and the running of some of the
horses behind her would furnish an
Interesting set of kinetoscope views.
Thorpe's honesty can be vouched for,
but he rode a supremely ridiculous race
aboard the favorite, Earl Coohran, and
6ome mornins will awaken to find him
self no longer the idol of the far west
ern turf. H. Martin on Paul Pry, con
sidered the "dangerous horse." got into
all. sorts >if mix-ups during the jour
ney, getting along In time to be beaten
a neck by the Sobrante mare in 1:48^.
If the race was a "shoo in," it was a
cleverly managed arrangement.
The racing throughout the afternoon
was replete with upsets, Merry Boy
and Sweet Faverdale being the only
favorites to take purses.
The talent mad^ T.wanda a mild fa
vorite for the opening seven-furlong
run, but though she had the advantage
of "Skeets" Martin's riding, she found
the distance too far. The race resulted in
Charles Le Bel, Octuruck, Elsmore and
Duke of York finishing heads on the
â wire In the order named. Le Bel. the
winner, ridden by Thorpe, went to the
post at odds of 5 to 1.
A cheap band of "crabs" started in
the mile selling run following. Merry
Boy, the 13 to 5 favorite, with <\ish
Sloan up, won off from Tom Smith, a
7 to 1 chance. Mirambo was a fair
third. Zaraida. backed from 12 down
to 3, blew up in the run home.
OJal, a fast son <>f the Southern Cali

half furlong scramble for two-year-olds
In a head finish from Banewor, the
Burns & Waterhouse entry. The pair
were in front from the start, but the
former had a higher turn of speed and
won out in the last jump. Sweet Cakes,
the favorite, away none too well, fin
ished a close third. The winner was
3 to 1 around post time.
It took vigorous riding on the part of
Thorpe to get Sweet Faverdale home
winner of the fifth event, over one mile
and a sixteenth. The mare was equal
choice in the ring with Song ami Dance

had pet the pace to the bend for the

In the final six-furlong run. Sport
McAllister, the favorite, and Lucky

THE FIGHT OVER
CURRY'S PAYROLL
His Deputies Win the First
Round in the Legal
Scrimmage.
Time Given to the City and County
to Amend the Original
Pleadings.
Judges Hebbard, Belcher and Cook sat
in bank yesterday to hear the injunction
proceedings brought in the nime of the
city and county restraining Auditor Brod
erick from signing the demands of cer
tain copyists and extra register clerks
employed in County Clerk Curry's office
in alleged violation of law.
A demurrer was interposed to the com
plaint on the ground that the pleadings
were Improperly drawn, and it was fur
ther asked that the temporary injunction
issued at the time of the filing of the suit
be dissolved.
Ex-Judge Slack, T. D. Riordan and A.
L. Hart appeared in support of the de
murrer, and the interests of the city and
county were looked after by City and
County Attorney Creawell and Deputy
City and County Attorney Brobeck.
The argument of the law points involved
occupied over two hours, and at its con
clusion the Judges decided to sustain tne
demurrer.
The plaintiff, through Deputy Brobeck,
thereupon asked for time in which to
amend the complaint. He. was according
ly granted until next Tuesday morning in
which to file the amended pleadings, and
in the meantime the temporary injunction
originally issued will remain in force and
effect.
Now Out of Harm's Way.
James Barry, an Incorrigible petty thief,
was sentenced by Judge Cook yesterday
to two and a half years' Imprisonment at
San Quentfn on his plea of guilty to a
charge of felony.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 1898.
ICE BOUND
WHALERS IN
NEED OFHELP
Continued from Second Page.
a 600-ton steamer and barge at Its ship
yard. The Canadian Pacific is also
building a river boat to carry 350 tons
of freight on thirty-inch draught. The
Alaska Exploration Company had Its
barges on the beach and was putting
up a large building to be used as a
hotel.
The gasoline yacht El Irena had been
hauled on the beach and her passen
gers were in very comfortable quarters.
There was a large migration to Mi
nook. I could not learn of any actual
discoveries, but every one who could
get a dog team was going over the por
tage, and some poor fellows were drag
ging their sleighs along on foot heav
ily loaded.
L. B. Shepherd had discovered
a coal mine about ten miles be
low Unanacluk, which will no doubt
prove a bonanza. The coal is consid
ered first-class steam coal, and lies on
the coast, so that with the necessary
appliances, which are now being put
in place, the whalers and revenue cut
ters can get their coal handily and
ships will have good protection and sea.
He will also be able to supply thÂ«
river steamers with coal. There will
be nearly fifty steamers on the Yukon
next year, and there will be a famine
as regards wood, so this find will prove
of great value. It was reported that
flour was worth $10 per sack of fifty
pounds at Neulattes, but I did not
learn of any new diggings in this quar
ter.
Dr. Edie, who had been attending to
Cannuanwar's case, pronounced her fit
to travel, so I got a small quantity of
provisions from the people and left St.
Michael on the 16th day of January,
with my colors set. The different sta
tions dipped their flags as I started and
fired volley after volley of rifles, pistols
and let off three dynamite blasts. I
had taken with me Mr. James' guide,
Kohltoph by name.
He showed m,e the road from St.
Michael to Kodak, also accompanying
{ me to my first stopping place, which
! was E. H. Hanson's, former manager
lof Wright, Bowne & Co. We reached
the steamer J. J. Healy, lying at winter
â¢ quarters at Indian Canal, where I
j stopped for the night.
She is under command of Captain
Harry Lott, formerly of Port Town
send. Our party was very pleasantly
| entertained by her officers, Messrs. An
; derson and McCorker. We also vitited
; the steamer Mare Island, and all her
passengers seemed to feel in good spir
its. A great many of them had se
; cured work in St. Michael, and there
J were only about twenty-five left on
i board.
From Kodiak down the coast to Port
land the trip was without particular
incident.
The Wasp This Week.
The pictorial features of the Wasp this
week are varied and of general interest.
One of the principal subjects is a page
of splendid half-tone engravings of the
I'nited States ships Monterey and Monad
nock, the battle-ships which, in case of
war. wili be called upon to protect the
Pacific Coast. There are also pictures of
several prominent persons in social and
political life. The center-page cartoon,
depicting the "Brewing of the Hell
Broth" by the pretended patriots of New
York yellow journalism, is an especially
clever composition. Ihe editorials on the
stirring topics of the day are vigorous
and well written and the various depart
ments are worthy of careful perusal. Al
together this week's Wasp is a particu
larly interesting number and bears out
its reputation as the leading weekly jour
nal of the Paoillc Coast.
A New Easter Mass Will Be Sung.
The mass to be sung at St. Charles
Church to-morrow morMing in honor of
the resurrection of the Redeemer is the
composition of H. J. Schonacker of In
dianapolis, Ind.. a brother to Mrs. Hay,
the present organist of the church. This
will be the first time that the mass has
ever been sung In public and consequently
much interest is manifested by local crit
ics, who are anxious to pass judgment
upon it. The final rehearsal, with voices
and instrumental accompaniment, was
held last Thursday evening and proved
a success.
THE STOCK MARKET.
There was a sharp drop In mining stocks on
the afternoon call, as will be seen by the list
of sales.
Yellow Jacket Is assessed 20 cents.
The Hale & Noroross and Occidental assess
monts fall delinquent In board to-day.
Local securities were weak on the Bond
Exchange. Oceanic Steamship sold own to
$00. Gas and Klectric to $84 50 and Hawaiian
Cnmmerlcal to $24 50.
The Llllle mine of Colorado paid a dividend
of $9000 on the Ist.
The Moon-Anchor mine of Colorado paid a
dividend of $15,000 on the 2d.
The Horn Silver mine of Utah paid a divi
dend of 5 cents per share, or $20,000, on the
Ist. Hereafter quarterly dividends at the same
rate will lie paid.
The official letter from the Justice mine for
the past week says: "Work in the winze from
the face of the southeast drift has been tem
porarily suspended on account of water. The
seepage Is now decreasing rapidly, and we ex
pect to resume work In the winze by the lat
ter part of the week. On the SO-foot level we
have timbered the north drift a distance of
25 feet, and are now stoping ore from the face
This ore has widened and now shows a width
of five feet. We have hoisted seven tons <>i
ore from this stope during the week. The car
samples of the ore average, gold $32 41, silver
$21 OH; total, $53 50 per ton."
Payment of the six months' interest on its
bonded indebtedness due on the Ist, has been
passed by the Pan Francisco Breweries, Lim
ited. The amount involved Is $75,000

THE SAVIOR'S
SACRIFICE
Good Friday Solemnly
Observed by the
Churches.
Sermons, Chanting, Lit
anies and Readings
From St. John.
Beautiful Wgeather and a Great
Attendance at All the
Services.
SIMPLICITY THE CUSTOM.
An Absence of Mxisio and Many Evi
dences of Sorrowful De
votion.
Good Friday services were observed
in even- church in the city yesterday,
noticeably in the Roman Catholic and
Episcopal. Owing to the beautiful
weather the attendance at all services
was large, and a noticeable feature in
the Catholic ranks was quite a revival
of the old custom of making pilgrim
ages from one churc' to another. Hun
dred* of the faithful observed this cus
tom.
Throughout the halcyon afternoon
there was the greatest silence in all the
churches. Not a bell rang, not an or
gan Bounded, but chanting and prayer
marked the day.
In the Catholic churches solemn de
votional servici took the place of the
solemnization of the mass in the morn
ing, while the evening services consist
ed not of the observance of vespers and
benediction but of the saying of the
rosary and sermons on the subject of
'"The Passion" as recorded in St. John.
Services in all *the churches of the
city were marked by great simplicity,
as is usual. In the Catholic churches
the altars and ofiiciatin- clergy were
draped in black. Go d Friday being the
only day when such draping occurs.
Prayers for peace and the unity of the
church, for the rulers of the nation and
state, were general iv offered.
Another feature of the observance of
the day in the Catholic churches was
that the clergy removed their shoes
during part of the ceremonies, and the
eucharist was taken out of the taber
nacle and placed on St. Joseph's altar,
where it will remain until to-day in all
the churches.
After the reading of the ceremonies
the choirs chanted without the aid of
any organ music, which was abolished.
Some of the clergy chanted and others
chanted the answers. After the cere
monies the crucifix was taken to the
altar, and the congregation in front of
the altar rail kissed the wounds, the
crucifix being on a cushion in front of
the altar steps.
At St. Ignatius the afternoon ceremo
nies lasted three hours, the Rev.
Father Xeri <' Mvering a sermon on
"The Last Seven Words of Christ."
The Episcopal services throughout
the city were quite impressive, consist
ing of the usual Good Friday ceremo
niee. At Grace Church the ceremonies
began at 10:30 and consisted' of the
prayer, litany and sermon by Rev. Dr.
Foute. The afternoon services contin
ued from 3 until 6 o'clock. They consist
ed of continuous services and addresses
by several ministers. The nieht services
began at 8 o'clock and were conducted
by Rev. Dr. Shaw.
There were special services at the
First Lutheran Church yesterday
morning. The Rev. E. E. Nelander de
livered a Bennon, subject "Before the
Cross." The servic s also Included a
select number of solos and other sine
ing by the choir.
In other churches throughout the
city the services were of a similar
character, consisting largely of the
reading of passages from St. John and
the observance of the formalities long
prescribed in the various denomina
tions.
Money Coining In.
Manager J. A. Filcher. who Is handling
the Alaska trade end of the State Board

In advance, toward the support of the
Btate Board of Trade, for the purpose of
strengthening Its endeavors to secure as
much of the Alaska trade as possible for
Ban Francisco. There are certainly fifty
men and firms in this large city who can
afford to do as well, and a hundred others
who can giv^ $r> or more a month- and
with from $1000 to $20K) a month properly

AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE.
A Committee From the Merchants'
Association Talk Paving With
H. E. Huntington.
A committee from the Merchants' Asso
ciation of San Francisco held a consulta-.
tion with H. E. Huntington of the Mar
ket-street Railroad Company at the lat
ter's office yesterday afternoon relative
to the proposed repaying of Market
street. Owing to the terms of the fran
chise under which the railroad company
operates It is responsible for nearly one
half the expense of the proposed im
provements, while the balance of the ex
penditure would have to be borne by the
city. The meeting was behind closed doors
and was an exceedingly lengthy one,
but it was learned that after the whole
matter had been thoroughly talked over
the most Mr. Huntington could say was
that the matter would be considered by
the board of directors at a special meet
ing which will be called for that purpose
either this afternoon or Monday morning.
Those present at yesterday's conference
were Mayor Phelan. Hugo Kiel. A. S.
Baldwin and W. R. Sherwood, represent
ing the Merchants' Association, and H. E.
Huntington, representing the Market
street Railroad Company. Henry H.
Lynch, superintendent of construction for
the railroad people, was called in to give
his advice on some technical matters that
came up.

PRAISE FOR POLICEMEN.
Fire Marshal Towe Compliments
Officers R. J. McGrayan and
J. Lynch.
Fire Marshal Charles Towe has paid a
well-deserved compliment to Policemen R.
J. McGrayan and J. Lynch. The compli
ment was given in a communication to
Captain of Police John Spillane. and by
him referred to the Police Commission-
ers before it was transmitted to the offi
cers named. The Fire Marshal in his
communication tells of a fire In the early
morning in a restaurant that was dis
covered by Policeman McGrayan. wno
promptly gave an alarm and as promptly
went to the rescue of over a score of
persons who were sleeping over the store
where the flames were discovered and
who were in peril of their lives. "I be
lieve.' said the Fire Marshal, "that
through the promptness of the officer a
calamity was averted â one that would
have sent a thrili through the hearts of
our best citizens."
Fire Marshal Towe not only thanked
Policeman McGrayan, but extended a
word of praise to Policeman J. Lynch.
He says that It was through the combined
efforts and good Judgment of McGrayan
and Lynch that he was able to procure
evidence that established the fact that
the place had purposely been set on fire,
and which will bring the perpetrators of
the crime to the bar of justice.
"How little thought our citizens give
to such brave deeds I know full well,"
concludes the Fire Marshal; "but it is
such acts that cause me to know the
vni'ip of the ever watchfulness of our
police."
To Investigate a Nuisance.
The members of the Board of Health
and Mayor Phelan will drive out to the
Lick and Wilmerding schools site this
morning and investigate the nuisance
property-owners in the vicinity allege ex
ists there. Four blocks bounded by San
Bruno avenue. Kansas, Sixteenth and
Channel streets are far below the official
grade and are covered with stagnant
water, which is considered a menace to
the health of those living in the vicinity.
CHINESE EMBEZZLER CAPTURED
Deputy Sheriff Q. H. Kinloch of So-
lano Lands a Daring Criminal.
Deputy Sheriff G. H. Kinloch of Solano
County cleverly captured Yee Wing, a
well-known highbinder, and after some
trouble brought him to the City Prison
last evening, where a charge of felony
embezzlement was entered against him.
Wing embezzled a large sum of money
from a fellow-Chinaman and succeeded
In leaving the city, despite the effort of
the police to find him. He skipped to So
lano County, and his whereabouts be
came known to the local officers. A war
rant for his arrest was forwarded to
Kinloch, who after a long search found
him. Wing's presence in the country
town waa kept secret by his countrymen,
and every effort was made to prevent
Kinloch from effecting his capture.

From a horseman's point of view more

for the stake than on any previous oc

winner at all sorts of odds in the bet
ting.
When the weights for the race this
afternoon were first issued much fault
i was found with the allotments made by
: Handicapper Brooks, and not without
j some reason, for several good horses
| will remain in the stables on account
iof the heavy imposts dealt out with
j lavish hand. However, a field of eleven
j horses have accepted the issue, and,
! from a betting standpoint, it promises
! to be a swell affair, as nearly every
! horse is conceded a chance by enthu-
I elastic admirers.
There is a paucity of riding material,
and the officials of the California
! Jockey Club have been called upon to
unravel many perplexing entangle
ments, every available jockey appar
ently having engaged himself to at
least two different owners. This prob
lem is now settled, and the make-up of
. the race will probably be as follows:
i Marplot. 94, J. Woods.
Morelllto. 104, Spencer.
! Fonaovannah, 102, H. Martin.
! Traverser, 112, Thorpe.
Won't Dance, 118. C. Sloan.

Buck Massie. 125. Clayton.
Candelaria, 105, Clawson.
Ostler Joe, 123. Plggott.
1-lnstock. 107. Gray
Scarborough, US, Hennessy.
In a prominent downtown hotel, the
resort of horsemen, the betting last
evening favored the Burns & Water
house pair. Traverser and Candelaria,
at odds of 7to 2. The quotations
against the others were: Scarborough,
E to 1; Ostler Joe, 7 to 1; Won't Dance,
10 to 1; Satsuma, 10 to 1; Buck Massie,
7 to 1; Fonsovannah, 12 to 1; Marplot,
30 to 1; Linstock. 8 to 1; Morellito, 10
to 1. At these odds Scarborough and
Ostler Joe seemed most in demand.
The race has created widespread en
thusiasm, and the largest crowd of the
present racing season promises to be
present.
THE DIRECTORY CROWDED.
Not Room for One-half the Youths
Who Desire AdmissionâPlan
ning a New Building.
Finding that the old building at 2023
Howard street is no longer adequate for
the purposes, Father Crowley intends
erecting a new building to be used as the
Youths' Directory.
The Youths' Directory was founded
eleven years ago, at which time Father
Crowley purchased the lot on Howard
street, which then contained a twelve
room house. For a time this was large
enough, but so rapidly did the institution
grow that at the end of a year the old
building was moved back in the yard and
the present building was erected.
It is proposed to erect the new bui.^mg
on Nineteenth street, between Valencia
and Guerrero. It will be a handsome
structure of the Italian Renaissance
style, built in the shape of an "L," and,
although it will front on Nineteenth
street, the main building will oe on An
gelica street, with 173 feet resting on
Cumberland place.
A new building has become an absolute
necessity, as the f ur large dormitories
have become overeiowdedâ two boys oc
cupying each bed, and the beds were
meant for only one. As the Directory is
supported almost entirely by voluntary
contributions, it has no fund on hand to
erect the new building, the cost of wMcli
is estimated at $80,000, and Father Crow
ley will appeal to the public for money to
aid in the work.
Will Damage Their Property.
George Brown and a half dozen other
owners of property on Turk street, be
tween Masonic avenue and St. Joseph's
avenue, commenced suit yesterday
against Mayor Phelan, the Board of
Supervisors and Archbishop Rirodan, to
onjoln them from carrying out the terms
of a resolution passed "by the Supervisors
providing for the reduction of the width
of Turk street 31 feet 3 inches between
the above-named avenues. They allege
that if the resolution is put into effect it
will result in serious damage to their
property.
Election Commissioners.
The Election Commissioners met yester
day and ordered the publication of the
proclamation calling for the special char
ter election on May 26 Bids were or
dered advertised for for the erection of
the polling booths, supplies, etc.; also
bids for the printing of the new precinct
maps. In compliance with the written re
quest of the Carpenters' Union the board
adopted a resolution providing that the
successful bidder for erecting the elec
tion booths shall not work his men more
than eight hours a day, and providing for
a fine of $7f> for each violation of the or
der and the forfeiture of the contract.
FOUND HIM UNCONSCIOUS.
Officers Looking for a Man Find Him
With a Fractured Skull.
A. C. Sloan, who was wanted by the po
lice, was found by Officers Prowse and
Jewell last evening lying unconscious in
the street at the corner of Jackson and
Dupont streets. He was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital, where he was
found to be bleeding from the ear and an
investigation showed that his skull had
been fractured. The man was under the
influence of liquor and became so violent
t J? at . lt Wiis necssary to remove him to
the hospital at the City Hall and place
him in a padded cell.
Sloan is supposed to have stolen a box
of tobacco from Horn & Co., at 205 Bat
tery street, yesterday afternoon. The to
bacco was sold to a cigar dealer at the
corner of Montgomery and Washington
streets, and from the buyer's description
of the man who sold it the officers think
Sloan the guilty man. He is well known
to the police as a bad character, and it is
their opinion that while drunk from the
money he received for the stolen goodu
he fell and injured himself.
Cosmos Club Election.
ThÂ© annual election of officers of the
Cosmos Club will be neld to-day, and the
old question of a ladies' annex will t rob
ably he finally settled as the result of this
ballot. The candidates favoring this an
nex are W. B. Bradford, president, and
James T. Langhorn vice-president. At
the head of the opposition are Ferdinand
Reis for president and John Alexander
for vice-president. It is probable that the
election will be warmly contested, as
much interest is felt in the matter.
Loring Club Concert.
The Loring Club will give Its third con
cert at Odd Fellows 1 Hall next Wednes
day evening. The programme, which has
many interesting numbers. Is as follows:
"Sea Greeting," Thayer; "Far Away "
Engelberg; trio, piano, violin and violon-
cello (Op. 99), Schubert; "Night Greet
ing," Kremser; "The Merry Trumpeter,"
Rhelnberger: "Heinz yon Stein," Thayer;
'cello solo, "Caprice Hongrolse," Roerer;
"Spring Magic, Sturm; violin solo, (a)
"Cavatina," Sauret; (b) "Perpetuum Mo
bile," Scharwenka; "To the Sons of Art,"
Mendelssohn.
Rotten Sidewalks.
Property-owners on Sanchez street, be
tween Market and Fourteenth, have filed
with the Supervisors a protest against
the acceptance of the sidewalks recently
put down by Flinn & Treacy. They allege
that the wrong kind of rock was used;
that the bitumon was not properly cook
ed; that the walks will not permit water
to drain off. and that the top dressing is
so rotten that it can be crumbled with
the fingers.
He Now Hopes to Live.
Charley Dean, the half-breed Chinese,
who shot and killed Ah Gow. a Chinese
woman, is not so desirous of making a
hero of himself on the scaffold as he was
two weeks ago. At that time he pleaded
guilty. When he was brought before
Judge Wallace yesterday he asked per
mission to withdraw his plea of guilty in
cider that he might stand trial. The plea
was withdrawn, and the 2Sth inst. was
set for the beginning of the trial.
The Verdict Was Excessive.
The Bowers Rubber Company recently
recovered judgment lor $4000 against H.
D. Blasdel. A motion for a new trial
was made, and Judge Hunt yesterday de
ciaed that the verdict of the jury was
excessive. In a written opinion filed.
Judge Hunt set forth his views of the
litigation, concluding with the announce
ment that he believed $600 would fully
compensate the plaintiffs. Unless they
accept that amount a new trial will be
granted.
Still Fighting for Alimony.
Frankle White. ...e divorced wife of
George E. White, the "cattle king" of
Mendocino County, commenced suit yes
terday against Hulme & Hart to enjoin
them from paying $'1500 to her former hus
band. She has for months past been light
ing to secure the payment of back ali
mony, and now sues to enjoin Hulme &
Hart, having received information that
her divorced husband holds a claim
against them for $1500.

THE MANY WARS
OF THE SPANIARDS.
An Expert Says That No Man Is
Braver Than the Don When
in Battle.
"No man is braver than a Spaniard,"
said Sir Richard Grenville of Devon.
The history of Spain is a history of in
cessant struggle, incessant warfare
and incessant cruelty.
Spain, as we understand the name, i
came into being with the marriage of
Ferdinand and Isabella. By this union
two great provinces were" made one, I
and others came in to make the whole, j
Under Ferdinand and Isabella began â¢
the voyages of discovery which were to j
give Spain control of nine-tenths of j
the new world. Being the initiative j
reign of Spain as a nation it was, of
course, a warlike reign. Three men out
of four when asked to name the
leading events of Ferdinand's occu
pancy of the throne will say that Co
lumbus made an egg stand up for his
delectation, and discovered Amejrica,
and stop there. Yet in that reign the
Moors were driven from Spain; the in
quisition was established; Torquemada
was a power second only to the Pope j
himself; the Jews were expatriated; j
there were many wars In Italy; there
was a war with France to recover Cer
dagne and Roussillon, which had been
mortgaged to France by Ferdinand's
father; there was the rise and world
filling fame of- Gonsalvo de Cordova,
the great soldier; there was the utter
defeat of the French on Italian soil;
there were successful wars in Africa
and the wars of the so-called Holy
League.
In the days which followed Hernando
Cortez fought and conquered Mexico
and Francisco Pizarro under contract
fought and conquered Peru. This man
gave to Spain a territory which extend
ed through thirty-nine degrees of lati
tude and included all of those countries
now known as Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia
and Chile. Every day of Pizarro's ad
venturous life in the west was a day of
warfare, and every main actor in the
drama of the Incas died a violent death.
These possessions poured into the cof
fers of the conquering country a steady
stream of gold and silver. Within fifty
years the Spanish navigators made of
Spain the greatest empire the world
had ever known. The Atlantic and
Pacific oceans became Spanish lakes,
and became so through constant wars.
Every foot of this vast western hold
ing, with the exception only of Cuba
and Porto Rico, has been lost by war
or through the direct consequences of
war. Since the dethronement of Fer
dinand VII and enthronement of Jo
seph Bonaparte revolutions have cost
Spain nearly all of her transatlantic
colonies. Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Ecua
dor .went in 1524. Venezuela went in
1823. Mexico achieved independence
in 1829, and the isthmian republics in
1823.
In 1519 the Frankfort Diet gave the
crown of Germany to Charles V, who
was a Hapsburg, and Spain leaped at
once into prominence and power in the
wide field of European politics. For
eighty years it dominated the nations
of Europe, always at war and always
ruling, when it ruled, with an iron
hand. At that time facing each other
were four of the greatest Kings of his
tory. They were Charles V of Spain,
Francis I of France, Henry VIII of
England and Solyman the Magnificent.
The ablest of them was Charles. Dur
ing all of his reign his people had small
breathing time between his wars. For
thirty years he wns engaged in what
are called the Italian wars. He was
really behind the Constable de Bour
bon's sacking of Rome in ir>27, because
Pope Clement had absolved Francis
from a truce, and that merry monarch
had immediately begun fighting again.
In the eight years between 1827 and
1635 he had his usual war with Francis,
a war with the Florentines, assailed
the Barbary pirates and captured
Tunis. In 1636 he invaded Provence,
and in that year whipped the rebellious
burghers of Ghent. He had an African
war in 1541, and another war with
France from 1542 to 1544. In 1543 he be
gan his savage attacks on Protestant
ism. In 154" he took Maurice of Saxony
prisoner, and fought him again in 1552.
He followed this with one more war
with his old foeman of France. At this
time Spain was mistress of Mexico,
Peru. Franche Comte, the Netherlands,
Naples, parts of Germany and a dozen
of other principalities. During his
reign Charles rolled back the Turks
from Europe, fought for Christians in
Tunis and Algiers, had traveled over
Italy. France, England, Germany and
Flanders forty times in war and peace.
He had fought every one who disagreed
with him on any subject, and when he
resigned his crown to Philip and re
tired to a monastery, was the most po
tent and dreaded monarch of his day.
Philip, who came to the throne when
29 years old, fought the Pope: fought
France; fought long wars with the
Protestant Netherlands; fought the Turk
viciously; made one of the Holy
League which fought the great sea
fight of Ufepanto. which forever chat
tered the Turkish dream of an empire
in Africa, and in which Cervantes, a
private soldier, lost the use of his left
hand; fought Henry of Navarre; main
tained a perpetual sea war with Eng
land after the accession of Elizabeth.
He sent the invincible armada in 1588,
and of the 30.000 men who manned his
ships only 10,000 returned. He sent
another armada in 1596-97. Mexico was
coined into ducats for these wars â
English. French and Dutch. Philip
was royally Spanish or Spanishly royal.
He lived and breathed murder. He at
tempted to assassinate Elizabeth, Hen
ry of Navarre and John of Olden-Barn
eveld, the. great burgher, and he did
assassinate Egmont, Hoorne, William
the Silent; Don Carlos, at that time his
only son; his illegitimate son, Don
Juan; millions by one edict in the
Netherlands, and his private secretary,
Escovedo, who knew too much. For
many years of i'hilip's reign the skull
of the Chief Justice of Aragon adorned
a Spanish market place. Here is what
he governed: Peru, Mexico. Brazil, the
Antilles, seventeen Netherland prov
inces, twelve kingdoms of Spain and
Portugal, the two Sicilies, Milan, parts
of Tuscany, Barbary, Guinea, the Afri
can coast southwest, the Indian Sea
peninsulas and archipelagoes, the Phil
ippine and Malucca islands, the Grand
Duchy of Florence and the Republic of
Geneva. He was titular King of Eng
land, through his manage with Mary,
and a claimant to the throne of France
through his daughter.
Under Philip HI, Philip IV and
Charles II the great empire rapidly re
rograded. Under Philip 111 there were
thirty years of war. Philip IV reigned
forty-four years, which were of almost
uninterrupted war with the Nether
lands, Italy and France under Riche
lieu. Philip V, who was a Bourbon,
and Ferdinand VI were comparatively
quiescent. Charles 111 was guilty of
two foolish wars with England, in both
of which he was worsted. In the Span
ish war with England in 1762 the Eng
lish took Havana, with $15,000,000 in
plunder, and also Trinidad and Manila.
Spain bought them back with Florida.
In 1795 Spain warred with France, a
war which was ended by disgraceful
concessions of Spanish territory. In
1797, Spain then being once more em
broiled with England, the battle of St.
Vincent was fought. It resulted in the
practical annihilation of the Spanish
marine. This was followed by her
lengthy troubles with France under
Napoleon, in all of which she lost
strength and prestige. Finally came the
successful revolutions of her American
dependencies and the civil wars of Don
Carlos. Spain to-day, after four cen
turies of steady warfare, has but little
more territory than was hers when
Aragon and Castile joined hands, but
Spanish steel has flashed in all lands,
and the Spanish gentleman adventurer
has graven his name deep into the ages

The departure of Harry Terrill for the

in The Call Wednesday, was a big sur

to remain here, as he has been trotting
around so much of late. But the recent

The club met on Thursday evening 1 , and
it was resolved to devote 75 per cent of
the net profits to me charitable institu
tions of San Francisco, Including the
Protestant, Catholic and Hebrew Orphan
asylums and the Associated Charities.
There can be no doubt that the show will
! be well patronized, for the charitable
proclivities of the San Franciscans are
proverbial. The following famous con
| noisseurs of the canine race were se
lectiMi to judge the exhibits, and their
1 names are suniclent guarantee that the
awards will be ably and impartially be
stowed: J. Kurrell for collies; J. Bull,
j the noted greyhound fancier, for his
Bpeclalty, and tor au other breeds George
Bell oi Chicago, who stands second to
! none a* an all-round Judge of dogs, and
who is as well and favorably known in
England and Canada as in the United
, States, where his name is a household
word among dog breeders.
The office of the club has been opened at
224 Montgomery street, and ever-popular
"Dave" Sinclair is m Chicago, as hereto
fore. The premium lists will be pub
lished next week.
The proprietors of the Verona kennels
have definitely decided that their im
ported collies. Old Hall Admiral and
Heather Mint, shall hereafter be benched
"for exhibition only." Champion St.
Clare Laddie is to be withdrawn from
the kennel altogether, and wi.i resume
his former place as Mrs. Hearst's house
hold companion. Mrs. B. Bryan's Queen
Oiga, winner of llrst novice in great
danes at San jose. is to make the Cali
fornia circuit. Great things are expected
of this promising bitch, but time will
show. Mr. Hii'kman's fox-terrier, Count
Othonar. winner ot the first puppy at
San Jose, has been placed in Bradshaw's
â  hands. The "Reefer" ears are plainly in
evidence in this otherwise splendid young
! animal.
The splendidly groomed appearance of
the San Benlto collies at San Jose earned
much admiration for Norman J. Stew
art's exhibit. He, liKe all others had to
give way to the all-conquering Veronas,
but he came in a good second. Far from
being discouraged, Mr. Stewart claims
that there are as good collies in Scotland
as have ever come out of there, and he
Intends trying his luck In importing. Mr.
Stewart deserves special mention for the
unwearying courtesy extended by hhn to
the representatives of the press.
The San Jose show has resulted well
financially for its promoters. The Call
congratulates the combined clubs on a
well-merited success. The April meeting
of the "rebel" Pacific Mastiff Club takes
place on Saturday evening. The further
action of the club in the matter of seces
sion is awaited with much interest by
local fanciers. The harmony in its ranks
is not altogether perfect.

Kennel Club says that he, and not T. H

ABOUT YACHTING
AND THE
VARIOUS CLUBS.
The programmes of the San Francisco
Yacht Club for the coming season are in
print and the invitations for the opening
day have been distributed. The house
committee, consisting of Fleet Captain
Dr. A. W. McKenzie. Secretary Charles
B. Hill and Financial Secretary W. G.
Morrow, has nearly completed the ar
rangements for the reception and dance
at the clubhouse on Saturday, April 23.
The regatta committee, consisting of
Vice-Commodore George T. S. White,
Treasurer R. B. Hogue and Measurer J.
K. Punnett, has charge of the sports and
small-boat regatta to be held on Sunday,
the 24th. Financial Secretary W. G. Mor
row is expected to reach San Francisco
from the East in a few days.
Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill, with some
difficulty and after missing the tide owing
to non-arrival of the launch to take him
in tow, got his flagship Cygnus out of the
Corte Madera Creek last Sunday. She is
now at her moorings off the San Fran
cisco Club house. Vice-Commodore Q. T.
S. White's sloop Will o" the Wisp is ready
for the season, and will get under way
on Sunday.
l&essrs. Huckley and Kanzee, who have
for so long been enthusiastic launchnion,
art* about to become yachtsmen. Menotti
is to build a yawl for them, to be ready
in about lour months. R. li. Hogue,
treasurer of the San Francisco Yacht
Club, for several seasons one of the lead
ing players of the Alameda Cricket Club,
is desirous of becoming a yacht-owner.
On Tuesday last he paid a visit to Tib
uron and looked over T. F. Tracy's sloop
Secret.
It now seems that the projectors of the
proposed pleasure resort at North Sau
salito will build a. little higher up toward
Kichardsons Bay. so that Menotti's boat
building yard will not be disturbed, and it
will not become necessary to lind a new
site for the "ways" of the San Francisco
Yacht Club. It is reported that Hewson,
a ship-builder, is thinking of opening a
yard in Sausallto.
It is now some years since the enameled
flags of the San Francisco Yacht Club,
worn by the members as scarfpins or aa
badges on the lapel of the waistcoat,
were made. Now a downtown jeweler has
undertaken to manufacture a supply of
them as soon ns he receives a reasonable
number of orders.
The following are the officers of the
Pacific Yacht Club for IS9S: President, J.
H. Dickinson; vice-president, William
Cunningham; commodore, E. A.

Plenty of work is being done at Tlb
uron on the boats of the Corintnlan fleet,
many of which will be got ready during
the next two weeks, and will attend the
opening of the San Francisco Yacht Club
on April 23 and 24. Last Sunday Joe Mat
toon's sloop Amlgo came down from Ben
lcla, where she has been lying all winter,
to her moorings at Tiburon. The yawl
Arcturus is expected to come off Frank
Stone's "ways" at Tiburon in a day or
two. The Aeolus will then take her place.
The Freda and Ella are on Stone's
"ways" at Hunters Point. The new suit
of sails for ex-Commodore J. W. Pew's
Truant hfis .arrived, and the Truant will
be put on the "ways" in about a week's
time.
Last year the Corinthians, represented
by the Aeolus, won from the Encinal
Yacht Club the perpetual challenge cup
offered by the San Franciscos. Up to the
present time no challenge for the cup has
been received.
E. B. Lathrop, secretary of the Corin
thians, has had a long- spoil of ill-health,
but it is sincerely hoped by his friends
that he will be able very shortly to re
sume business at the old stand.
The debt of the Encinal Yacht Club
has recently been taken up by several of
its members, who have accepted the
club's notes. The club is now entirely
free of debt to outside parties. The new
directors are displaying much energy, and
are stirring up the club from the lethargic
condition into which the old board had
permitted it to fall. There is a marked
Increase in the club's receipts, and a
considerable number of new members is
expected. Several new electric lights
have been put into the clubhouse, and
the swimming facilities have been In
creased by the addition of a trapeze and a
new chute. Last Saturday evening a pri
vate party was given at the clubhouse,
which was prettily decorated and hun?
with Japanese lanterns. Many or the
guests were from Oakland or San Fran
cisco. Next morning the visitors were
taken out for a trip on the bay in a gaso
line launch, which hud two or three
whltehalls In tow.
On April 16, as already announced, the
California Yacht Club opens. There will
be a low jinks in the evening at the club
house, and the first sail ( n f>quadron of
the. season will take place nex: clay. A.
M. Clay's sloop Sea Fox and some others
are ready. Admiral E. A. yon Schmidt's
Whirlwind will be on hand on the open-
Ing day, but may not be much seen dur
ing the season, as the admiral has in
terests in Alaska that may draw him
away.
The California Yacht Club's "ways" are
not available for use at present, having
been badly strained last season, when
the Thelma was upon them; but they will
probably be rebuilt during the summer.
At present boats are hauled out on the
sandsplt.
The new sloop Occident, owned by
Messrs. Hager and Miller of West Oak
land, will be launched before the end of
the month. She is a handsome boat of
the overhang type, forty-one feet over
all. with plenty of outside ballast to give
her stability. She is expected to prove a
fast boat.
COLLEGE MEN ARE
PREPARED
TO CROSS STICKS.
Since the awful defeat that Stanford
kindly bestowed upon California on the
gridiron last November the two ooltegM
have not met in athletic combat. To-day
the truce will be broken, and the blue
and gold and the cardinal will struggle
on the Eighth and Harrison streets dia
mond in the initial game of a series of
three. For four months the baseball men
of both universities have been training
for this event, and now they are ripe for
the encounter. Sheehan at Palo Alto and
Cochran at Berkeley are non-committal
about the chances of their teams for vic
tory. Each displays a wise reserve, tinct
ured with a great heap of hope.
In fact, the teams are pretty evenly
matched. Neither nine has any great ad
vantage over the other in regard to bat
teries. In Kaarsberg California has per
haps better pitcher, but he is by no
means phenomenal. His judgment is
good, and more than that he exercises It
un the field. Beckett, the Stanford twirl
er. has always shown to better alvantage
in inconsequential games than in the in
tercollegiate matches. Stanford's other
twirk-r, L.annigiin, has been developed
this year and is both unsteady and er
ratic. As to the Held work, the general
impression is that California handles it
self in much cleaner fashion than its
rival. The distinct advantage that Stan
lord has over California is in the hitting
I abilities of the team. Last season, the
blue and gold seni a nine out to victory
whose chief distinction rested upon a
certain skill with the stick, which meant
a piling up of run after run in rapid
style. But this is now a dream of the
past. The present aggregation of base
ball men at Berkeley are not even ordi
nary batters. A week ago in a game with
the alumni, Toby Allen in the box. Cali
fornia merely secured a few scattered
hits. On the other hand, the cardinal has
a team of big men with better records in
stick work than the Callfornians. How
ever, the strength in ohe part is offset "toy
weakness in another, the result being a
balance of forces.
The game will take place at 3 o'clock
at the Eighth and Harrison streets
Recreation grounds. The teams will line
i up in the following positions:
California. Position. Stanford.
Mem Catcher Strohn
Kaarsberg Pitcher Beckett or
Lannigan
Bride First base \oung
McLaren Second base Harris
Baer Third base Klauber
McCabe Short stop Lougheed
Chesebrough Left field Murphy
Hoag Center field Wight
Collins Right field Edwards
Two weeks from to-day the much
awaited field day will take place at the
Olympic Club grounds. California is
training steadily for this day, which prom
ises to be iconoclastic as far as records
are concerned. The performances of the
Berkeley athletes on the college cinder
path last Saturday presage some great
athletic sport when the rival universities
meet in dual combat on a neutral field.

ANGLERS RETURNED
WITH EMPTY CREELS
Anglers wore as thick on Paper Mill and
Lagunitus creeks last Sunday as flies on
a sugar cask, and as predicted in The
Call the majority of them returned with
comparatively empty creels.
Trout are not so foolish as a majority
of the first-day-of-the-season fishermen
suppose. The stream waders soon discov
ered that on Sunday last and many of the
disgusted ones quit the sport early' in the
day. Among the experienced whippers of
fly and spoon the following "gentle ar
tists" returned home with tolerably nice
baskets of trout: L. H. Bookman, J. Pel
tier and wife, F. Muller, H. Stoll, J. Watt,
W. Miller, Sydney Hall, J. B. Halstead, L.
V. Merle, E. Baity and wife, J. Gibbs, E.
Breidenstine, Charles Rosenberg, Howard
C. Greene, Charles S. Darling, T. Murphy
and William Simpson.
On Saturday, April 2, some very nice
fish were taken from the creek, but on
the following day they were scared so
badly by the advance army of one-day-in
tho-year fishermen that doubtless many a
nice trout left the stream instanter for old
ocean.
At Point Reyes some nice trout were
taken in tide water, but the big steel
heads played peek-a-boo with the strong
arm and heavy pole bait casters. Fifty
large tlsh were seen on Sunday morning
basking in the sun in the White .touse
pool, and not one of them would be April
tooled. When Frank Dolliver, the expert,
gave up the task in disgust, then the
prospects were decidedly poor for those
who hoped in vain ft) land a ten pounder.
Patsy Dugan was the only man among
the steelheaders who hooked anything
with life In it. Patsy was makinn- a long
spoon cant for a "whopper," when his
back line fouled a large Newfoundland
dog that was watching the patient disci
ples from a road just over the White
House pool. The spoon hooks soon get
the dog on the move, and Patsy's reel
sang the merriest song imaginable. The
angler followed, but the dog never
stopped an instant, and It is hard to say
if he has quit running vet. Dugan lost
his entire outfit, but when "joshed" by
his companions he remarked that if he
had been successful in landing the dog it
would have been the first dog fish cap
tured on hook and line at Point Reyes.
F. Marcus, J. Lawrence, J. Butler, J.
Mallon, H. Terry and C. Mldleton enjoyed
a beautiful outing last Sunday to Ukfah.
They did not catch majiy fish, but what
they lost in scales they made up for in
a most pleasant ride to and from Ukiah.
It is said the Los Gatos Creek contains
very few fish this year.
GUN CLUBS WILL
SHOOT TO-MORROW
The Empire Gun Club, which is one of
the nourishing organizations of this city,
â will give magnificent prizes to the win
ners of the shoot which will be held to
morrow at the Alameda Point grounds.
In connection with the club shoots dur
ing the season there will be twenty-bird
matches and class shooting over the
Magau trap, and open to amateurs. The
prize is a hammerless gun valued at $50.
The Olympic Gun Club will meet at its
shoot at live birds.
The South End Gun Club will smash
clays at Colma on the same day.
COURSING IS NOW
A GREAT
OUTDOOR SPORT.
Lovers of good coursing should not fail
to be present at Union and Ingleside
parks to-day, as the fastest dogs in the
State are entered to chase fur at both
parks and particular attention has been
devoted during the week to the weeding
out of poor hares. With good dogs, good
hares, good judging and good slipping,
then coursing is truly a sport of kings.
The men who make the game of cours
ing are fast bringing it to a plane previ
ously unheard of in the United States,
and rivaling that of England. At a meet
ing of the Ingleside Coursing Club last
Sunday evening, President Shannon in the
chair, a decided innovation in the sport
was proposed.
It had been conceded that a special
stake for hounds of exceptional quality
would conduce to a further elevation of
the pastime. But it was not deemed that
a segregation of the winners of any num
ber of events into a class by themselves
was advisable for the reason that before
such a class could attain respectable size
the first performers relegated thereto
would have passed beyond the age of
good work. Besides, the exclusion of the
high-class stock from the ordinary events
would detract from the incentive to prop
agate such stock, the motto being breed
and weed. Consequently the matter was
taken up on other lines, and a new class
established, to be known as the Ingleside
open champion challenge class.
The initial stake n the new class will
be run off at Ingleside on the rirst of
next month, and that the desired result 3
will be accomplished is assured. In th*
first place it will be cpen to all dogs and
owners, whether the latter be members
of the club or not, and irrespective of tht
dog's winnings, thus barring no one. The
entrance fee will be $10, and tIM event will
embrace twenty-four nominations, which,
with the added money, will bring the
stake well above $800. The added en
trance money will insure the nomination
of tried performers, and their quality will
be further assured by the method of run
ning.
Tin- championship event will be a se
ries of courses in bests. TIM <lo^s, ss us
uai. will be drawn and run in pairs. But
before a winner can send his opponent
finally to h.s kennels he must serve two
Hags out of three.
The leashmen are enthusiastic in their
commendation of the Innovation. They
aver that it not only means a vastly big
ger money to the winners, but that it
will give each dog the fairest test pos-
Blble in a park. Moreover it in n.. way in
terferes with the ordinary events. In
fact, the usual monthly puppy stake will
also be run on the day of its adoption
and for the usual liberal purs.-s.
The coursing this week is for big money
â¢at both parks. At Ingleside an open
stakt- t-mbraclng forty-eight dogs will be
run down this afternoon, and immediately
thereafter a consolation stake will be
drawn, to be run off in conjunction with
the ties of the chief event to-morrow.
At Union Park there are two stakes on
the card, an all-age open event and a
puppy stake. The all-age contest shows
an entry of forty-eight flyers and the
youngsters will go to the slips sixteen
strcng.
A long-odds book will be opened to-day
at Ingleside. Susie, Connemar.i and Pa
trla will probably be the ruling favorite*.
Curtis has two candidates at Union
Park this week, but he will hard*? pull
out with the success of last week.
Nelthe:- Chartist nor Commodore is of
the same quality as Rosette.
J. Dean's Brilliantine was bred this
week to the famous Koyal Crest.
The same owner's Hazel Glen was also
bred to Skyball.
Deckelman & Panario's pair. Old Glory
and Glen Roy, look to be dangerous fac
tors at Ingleside to-day.
The Bucks are looked upon with most
favor at Union Park this week. Both of
the old breadwinners art- in excellent
shape and will put up some hot work.
For the run-down at Ingieside to-day
throughout the following dogs appear to
have a shade ttte l>est of it: Dakoti Su
si<\ 1> li. Sir Walter, Connemara, Log
Boy, Belle of Moscow, Nelly Conroy, Pa
tria, Lady Napoleon. Magnet, Sinaloa.
Fireball, Bend Along. Thornhill, Old
Glory, Right Bower, Koolawn, Flashlight,
Lady Blanche. Senorita, Signal, Mystic
Maid and Myrtle.
A. Johnson's veteran Lissak, who has
been doing remarkable work at Union
Park lately, was badly chewed up during
the week by another of his kind. John
son purchased Tod Sloan last Sunday,
and is running him to-day at I'nion Park.
Harry Rosenthal makes his initial ap
pearance in the field at Ingleside to-day
with Dr. Norman. Rosenthal is handling
both Dr. Norman and Garden City.
It has become so nearly impossible to
purchase a high-class greyhound outright
that many persons are seeking to obtain
one or two performers on a lea^e. Sev
eral such propositions have lately been
made at both Ingleside and Union parks.
The probable winners to-day at Union
Pcirk are: All-age stake â Alameda. For
get, Tessie Fair. Tod Sloan. Douglass,
Grt-en Valley Maid, Arapahoe, Santa Ale
cia. Chit Chat. Camilla, Sweet Lips, Char
tist, Theron, Magic, Promise Me,, The
Turk. Move On. Lord Byron, Hercules,
White Chief, Eclipse, Rusty Gold, Royal
Buck and Flying Buck.
Puppy stakeâ Palmer Hill, Royal Oak,
Quiver. Star Pointer, Bonita. Flying Fos
;â¢ i. Minerva and Liberty Bell.
Out of the thirty-two courses of the
run-down last Saturday at Union Cours
ing Park The Call picked twenty-five
winners and on the Saturday previous it
failed in its selections in one course only.
At the Nc ark coursing meeting to
morrow the . illowing dogs will contest:
Alma vs. Do Me, Jeanette vs. Rudolph,
White Nellie vs. L. S. Conley. Klondike vs.
Growler, Speed vs. Dottie Dimple, Rubber
Neck vs. Lady Owens, Three Aces vs.
Lady Newark, Menlo vs. Last Chance,
Falk's Best vs. Young Dempsey, Chill
more vs. Jennie Dean, May W vs. Major.
TENNIS CHAMPIONS
ON SOUTHERN COURTS.
Tennis players are now looking toward
the south for the scene of battle. On
Friday next a tournament will be in
stalled on the courts of Ojai Valley Ten
nis Club, which for the wealth of first
class tennis material already entered has
never been equaled on this coast. It will
be a battle of the north against the south
and the flower of both sections will be
there to fight for their standards. Strange
to say, the southern champions have ig
nored the annual meets ai San Rafael,
where the coast championship tourna
ment is held yearly. Now for the first
time the representative players of both
north and south will cross rackets in ac
tual combat.
The reputation of the north on the
courts will be upheld by the Hardy and
the Whitney brothers, the four topmost
players on the coast at present. The
south will have as its standard bearers
W. J. Cravens of Yale and other places;
F. Rowan, a tennis adept of southern
education; Picher of Stanford, and some
fourth player to fill the place left vacant
by the declination of Freeman, who wa3
originally selected to make the quartet.
The most likely fourth man is Bumiller,
formerly tennis champion of Stanford
University.
It will be a "Round Robin tourna
ment, in which each player meets every
other one. Then by a siftin" process the
championship match finally works its
way to the surface. This match will be
played on the second day of the tourna
ment and will precede the doubles tour
nament.
At the California Tennis Club grounds
a ladies' doubles tournament, which com
menced early in the week and was com
pleted Wednesday, was won by Misses
Hoffman and Mason. The finals between
the winning team and Misses Bowman
and Hunter were very closely contested.
The singles tournament is not yet con
cluded. Miss Hoffman and Mis? Hunter
are in the finals, and they will play the
match off a week from Monday.
Great Benevolences.
In the large cities of the T'nited States the
condition of the metropolitan poor is constantly
being ameliorated by the grand benevolences o(
wealthy people. Sanitary reforms are fre
quently suggested and carried out with earneet

(name of contractor) (his or their)
agents, or assigns, to demand and re
ceive the several assessments upon the
assessment and diagram hereto at
tached, and this shall be (his or their)
warrant for the same.
(Date) . (Name of President of
Board of Public Works.)
Countersigned by (Name of Secre
tary of Board of Public Works.)
Said warrant, assessment and dia
gram shall be recorded in the office of
the Board. When so recorded the sev
eral amounts assessed shall be a lien
upon the lands, lots, or portions of lots
assessed, respectively for the period ot
two years from the date of said record
ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record
ing of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons interested In paid
at;sf Ksment shall be deemed to have no
tice oÂ£ the contents of the record
thereof.
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall
he delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
until after the payment to the Board
of the incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as
signs. By virtue of said warrant said
cont! actor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re
ceive the amount of the several assess
ments made to cover the sum due for
the work specified in such contracts
and assessments.
When It shall appear by the final
judgment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render such judg
ment, that any suit brought to foreclose
tho lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, irregularity, or ll'e
g.i"ity, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to
any such assessment, or in the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with
in s;even months after the entry of said
final judgment, apply to the Board for
aro'.her assessment to be issued in con
formity to law; and the Board shall,
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make anrl deliver to
said applicant a new assessmant, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots
of land set out therein for the period of
two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said lien as provided in this Chapter.
Should such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. IS. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on hiÃ or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as
sessed, or their agents, if they can con
veniently be found, and demand pay
ment of the amount tossessed to each.
If any payment be made, the contrac
tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same

of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons so assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is
stated as "unknown" upon the assess
ment, then said contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return Indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid in whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shall
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by It and give a
good and sulficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff In
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
ment upon the books of Its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
were issued. If any contractor Bhall
fall to return his warrant within the
time and in the form provided in this
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but If
any warrant is lost, upon pruof of such
loss a duplicate may be Issued, upon
which a return may be made with the
same effect us if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum until paid.

i has acquired Jurisdiction to make the
â  same.
Sec. 15. At any time after the period
. of thirty-five days from the day of the
! date of the warrant, or if an appeal

In all cases of recovery under the
provisions of this Chapter the plain
i tiff shall recover the sum of fifteen dol
i lars in addition to the taxable costs,
j as attorney's fees, but not any percent

; suit may be settled or a tender be
made before a recovery In said aption,
and he may have judgment therefor.
Said warrant, assessment and dia

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the salo
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take s"uch steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but In
case the votes cast in favor of feotU.propositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro- j
ceeding at once, without the submission j
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its j
determination to acquire the same aÂ»
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided. ...
Sec 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City j
and County, in addition to the other j
necessary expenditures thereof, it snail j
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma- :
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired j
upon such terms.
In case however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article ;
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such j
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At j
least two-thirds of the electors voting:
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to * the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de- j
claring. such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de- j
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de- I
termine that the public interest or ne- |
cessity demands the acquisition, con- j
struction or completion of any public ;
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual Income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of \
the ordinance declaring said deter- i
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City ;
and County shall issue for the payment
Of the cost of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
a day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the manner of voting
for or against incurring such indebted- â 
ness. Such election shall be held as
provided by law for holding elections
in the City and County.
. Sec. 9. Such ordinance shall be pub
lished daily for at least ten days in the
official newspaper. At the expiration
of said ten days the Supervisors shall
cause to be published daily for not less
than two weeks in the official newspa
per a notice of such special election. ,
Such notice shall specify the purpose
for which the indebtedness is to be in- !
curred, the number and character of
the bonds to be issued, the rate of in
terest to be paid, and the amount of i
tax levy to be made for the payment
thereof.
Sec. 10. No Indebtedness shall be in
curred for the acquisition of any public
utility under the provisions of this Ar
ticle, which, together with the existing
bonded indebtedness of the City and
County, shall exceed at any one time
fifteen per centum of the assessed value
erf all real and personal property in the
City and County.
Sec. 11. The bonds issued under the
provisions of this Article shall be of the
character of bonds known as serials,
and shall be payable in lawful money
of the United States. The Supervisors
shall decide at the times of the issue
of the bonds In what lawful money of '
the United States said bonds shall be
payable. Not less than one-fortieth
part of the whole amount of indebted
ness shall be paid each and every year,
on a day and at a place to be fixed by
the Supervisors, together with the in
terest on all sums unpaid at such date.

poses, and shall be issued in denomina- j
tions of not lesa than ten dollars nor '<

WHENCE '"A MIC THE GORDONS?
Blackwood's Magazine.
In the absence of definite data one is
eft to ground a theory of the initial in
spiration of the Gordons on the undlsput- ]
ed tradition of their French origin. In '
c Department of Lot, in the southwest
"f France, there is townlet of 300 souls,
Btill known, like the Kincardineshire fish- i
!tiK village, by the name of Gourdon. I
1 ran. â  to this day that Gourdon I
IB the seat of a great hidden gold treas
ure, which King Clovis buried there in
"11. A chance find in 1542 gives some cre
dence t" the belief. At any ra^ it might
be taken as symbolic of the gift of the
of men which France made to this
country.
The Province of Aquitaine, in which
Gourdon is a tiny dot, was just the place
to breed a hardy, adventurous race, for It
bad loiiK been the battle ground of
Southern France, swept by successive r
hordes from the north. As early as the
eighth century a Duke of Gourdon was
Constable of France, and the town
touched English history when Richard
the Lion fell at Chalus by the hand of a
â oldler caned Bertram de Gourdon.
In the fourteenth century suits of ar
mor often weighed 175 pounds and
over.

The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at stnti^n indicate minimum temperature
fur the days: those underneath it. if any. the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow In Inches
and hundredth* during the i ast twelve h.>'jrs.
Is'.'tmrs, or sjlid linos, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. Tho word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low prea-
Fure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appoar en the Washington coast When
the pressure Is hlph In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars* extend n jrth
and south a'.onÃ the coast, rain is probable;
bat when thf "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April B.â The Stock Exchange
was open to-day for the first time on Good
Friday in over thirty years. When it was de
cided on Tuesday evening in response to a mo
tion to forego the usual holiday. It was ex
pected that the President message would
be presented to Congress on Wednesday, and
that by Friday the shock of war might have
come. The rescinding of the motion was dis
cuts.-l when the postponement of the Presi
dent's message was announced, but no action
was taken. As the event ha* proved, there
was no disposition â¢to trade, even yesterday,
the elements preferring to wait for the devel
opment of the situation. As for to-day mar
ket, business was trivial in amount and fluc
tuations were totally without significance. As
foreign exchanges were all closed it was sup
posed there might be some business. A large
number of brokers shut up their -offices and
went home when they ' perceived the condition
of affairs. Those who were left on the floor
devoted their principal energies to sportive de
vices and tricks 'of hazing upon the board
member whose motion was responsible for de
priving them of their usual holiday. Prices
drifted aimlessly below last night's, close and
closed above the lowest, but at fractional net
losses Quotations both In the money and ex
change markets were merely nominal, but a
small additional engagement of gold for im
port was sufficient to indicate that the tide
of the precious metal has not changed. , <â â¢;Â»,
Bonds were almost stagnant, ' but showed de
clines. Total sales, $800,000. United States 4's
coupon lost 1, coupon registered %, the old 4's
registered Vi and the G's %in the bid price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April Sâ The opening in wheat
was steady. July starting at S3"fc@S4c. about
where it left off yesterday. The closing of the
Liverpool and Continental markets and nearly
all the principal domestic exchanges took
away from the market half of the usual spec
ulative motive, and the pit at the opening
and for that matter during most of the ses
sion, was not more than half filled. Enough
bullish news was to hand to cause a moder
ate demand to cover short contracts, ami as
offering's were even scarcer than buying orders,
the market for a time moved upward. July
advancing to MÂ«<S4VsÂ»c from BS%QU|fcc, where It
had sold immediately after the opening. Crop
news from California was fully as unfavorable
as yesterday but outside of this reports were
generally favorable. The figures on the Ar
gentine weekly shipments depressed the mar
ket for a time. Shipments last week were re
ported at 1,572,000 bushels, an Increase over the
previous week, and this fact caused a little
more selling pressure, putting the price back
to 83Hc. After that, however, the market
ruled strong to the end. The Cuban situation
so long a depressed factor in wheat, has now
apparently become a bullish influence. Many
traders, especially among the shorts, expressed
the belief thin hostilities would result in an
advance to prices and acted according to their
belief. Additional strength was given the
market late in the day by the advance which
was taking place In corn, causing more or less
sympathetic buying and sustaining prices
against the occasional pressure in the profes
sional shorts and the Inevitable liquidation
which comes on the market during periods of
dullness. The demand Improved during the
afternoon, the market becoming quite strong
under moderate general buying. July finally
advanced to t>i%<asV/hc and closed firm at
84% c.
There was quite a brisk demand for corn
and the market was strong all day. May
closed %c higher.
Oats dull but firm. May closed %c higher.
Provisions were decidedly dull. Hog prices
were responsible for an opening decline In
provisions, packers being the sellers early. The
strength of corn and reports of large Govern
ment inquiries for products caused a better
demand later and the decline was recovered
The close was steady. May pork unchanged 1
May lard a shade higher and May .ribs 2HC
higher.

THE CURRAI. MARKET.
NEW YORK, April S.â The- competition of
California - seedless and . sultana raisins, it Is
reported, has during the past season materi
ally curtailed consumption of Grecian currants,'
which notwithstanding the comparatively low
prices made have been neglected to a consid
erable extent by consumers, who have given
preference to the cheaper California product.
Late advices from Patras report an easier feel
ing there, as the demand has not come up to
expectations, and supplies in primary markets
are still comparatively large. The European
demand has been only average, while trade
with the Cnited States has been reduced, owing
to ihe competition of California goods above
referred to. It Is stated that one of the rea
sons why Greek currants have failed to hold
their own against California competition is
that so much haste has been made to get new
stock here early that goods have been shipped
long before they were In proper condition.
Prominent Importers have forwarded to Greece
a rotest against the shipment of improperly
cured fruit. At the present time the feeling
here Is unsettled In sympathy with consider
able advices from Greece, and in consequence
of the sharp competition ' California products
in a dull market. At the same time holders of
currants do not seem willing to make import
ant concessions.
BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSIY tit, April S.â The Boston Commercial
j Bulletin will say to-morrow of the Wool mar
| ket: The market continues to mnnlfest general i
dullness throughout. The only sales made are
; from the bargain counter. Sales of mothy i
j fleeces and two-year-old territory Wool fill up
. the domestic side, and the larger sales of for
| eign are almost wholly composed of a few
j blocks of South American and Australian Wool I
j held by outside speculators, who are weary of '
I holding for a further rise. The sales are at
, concessions from recent dates, but the lots were â¢
! quickly picked up by regular dealers, who view
j the situation with much confidence. The sales â 
1 of the week were <;.".2,000 i>ounds domestic and
I 751.000 pounds foreign, against 34.910 pounds
domestic and 22.573 pounds foreign lor the same
i week last year.
The sales to date show a decrease of 36,993, 900
! pounds domestic and 34,615.300 pounds foreign
I for the corresponding date In 1597. The receipts
, to date show a decrease of 29,172 bales domestic I
i and 122,338 bales foreign.

former are slow to do trading in any line.
The attitude of the sellers is also a waiting
one. Staple cottons are the subject of slightly
better demand.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. April B.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to
morrow: When everybody Is asking whether
It Is to be war or peace the state of business
Is not easy to Judge. Since nobody can Judge
Just how wise bankers may be In an emergency,
there Is some uncertainty, but thus far scarce
ly any stoppage whatever of manufacturing
concerns appears, nor any Indications that the
producing force is likely to be diminished, nor
Is any such symptom to be seen In business re
ports. Evidence of existing conditions Is not
confusing, nor unfavorable. So far banking
conservatism has not caused failures, which
continue smaller than for many years, as In
Marcn, nor has it caused stoppage of any man
ufacturing concerns, nor lessened the volume
of business reported by railroads In tonnage
or clearings at principal points.
The wheat outgo counts for much and con
tinues, Atlantic exports having been 2,241,217
for the week, ugainst 1,521,122 last year, and
Pacific 1,226,574 bushels, against 447,585 last
year. Since corn exports continue 3.483.C50
bushels, against 3,323,277 last year, the strength
of the demand could not be attributed to spec
ulative agencies. It Is fortunate that Western
receipts of wheat do not fall short of the ex
traordinary gain, but are still 1,901,315, against
1,789,110 last year, so that the stories of the
nearly exhausted supplies of wheat are fables
for children. The price rose steadily and
closed 2c higher for wheat, with corn 1c
higher.
Every industry meets enormous over-produc
tion, compared with corresponding demands In
any other year, however prosperous, and yet
nearly all are keeping almost their whole force
employed, and some are Increasing force in
one branch of woolen manufacturers. Two car
pet mills have stopped, or are about to stop,
as it is between seasons, but much complaint
of cancelation because of higher prices and
possibility in some cases because of inferior
qualities has not been followed by reduced
production. Sales of wool are insignificant
and prices have declined 2c for finer grades,
and over 1 cent in the average for all quota
tlcns, only because speculators wholly under
estimated stocks held by manufacturers. In
the Iron and steel industry, with demands
greater than ever before from general sources,
urgent orders from the Government enlarge
work, but do not advance prices.
Disasters in trade, shown this week by sepa
rate branches of business for the month of
March, and also the first quarter of 1898. make
the best report that has been possible for five
years. It is interesting to note that nearly all
branches of business show surprising mo\e
ment. Meanwhile bankÃ are extremely cau
tious and commprcial loans are but 10 per
cent of their aggregate. The belief that quick
expansion in all branches would follow greater
liberality and patriotism by the banks Is not
wholly unfounded, and the heavy receipts ot
gold from Europe count for little, compared
with the greater or less liberality in loans Â»,,
banks. Disturbance does not yet appear, how
ever, and failures for the week have been 232
in the United States, against 252 last year, and
32 In Panada against 36 last year.
PARIS, April B.â The Bourse to-day opened
heavy. Spanish * s a sain fe H- but a better feel-
Ing supervened. The closing, however, was
dull.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. April B.â Eradstrect's to-mor
row will say: A sensible quieting of demand
for staple geods is perceptible in the various
detailed trade reports coming to hand this
week. At the East the drift of matters affect
ing our foreign relations has been such as to
discourage new business, but this tendency has
been considerably accentuated by untimely
cold weather, which has checked the usual
Easter demand to a considerable extent. Re
ports from the West are that the heavy rush
of spring business is about over, and that or
ders coming now are of a fllllng-ln character.
Here attain reports of unseasonable weather
are met with. A fairly good business Is re
ported at thÂ» South, but a slight check to our
export trade is reported, growing out of the
raising of Insurance rates consequent on the
disturbed foreign outlook. Frost Is reported
to have done considerable damage to the
peach and other fruit -crops of the South and
to early planted tobacco. A fairly satisfactory
trade is represented at the Northwest. Lake
navigation is now open and anticipation is
that a prosperous year's business will be done.
Rather less activity is noted in most or the
country's great staples. Cotton goods have
moved fairly well, ginghams especially being
In excellent demand, and except for low-grade
cOjttons, notably print cloths, which have made
a new low price record of 2c per yard this
week, the situation is as favorable as could
be expected. Wool is dull, reflecting uncer
tainty as to future business and unsatisfactory
margins of profit.
The iron trade continues to report a large
volume of business being done, but it is be
coming evident that this is chiefly upon orders
previously booked. Engagements for future
work have diminished alike in number and
volume, particularly in the East, pending the
outcome of foreign complications.
A feature of trade at leading cities this week
is the active business in bicycles in Chicago
and New York, where sales are the largest on
record. St. Louis reports boot and shoe ship
ments for the Quarter as heavy as before at
this time.
Wheat shipments, including flour, this week
are slightly larger than thoÃe of last week ami
considerably in excess of last year, aggregat
ing 3.773.726 bushels for that period, against
3.350.664 bushels last week. 2,036.000 bushels in
the week a year ago. 1.P64.000 bushels in 1896
and 2.934,000 bushels in 1R95.
Business failures in the United States this
week numbered 220, against 226 last week. 232
In the corresponding week of 1597, 230 in 1596
and 22f> in 1886,
Business failures this week in the Dominion
of Canada numbered 38, against 88 last week.
32 in the corresponding week of 1897, 30 In 1596,
26 in 1595 and 38 in 1894.
FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. April B.â Rradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Speculation has
been extremely nervous and irregular within
narrow limits on the critical appearance of our
relations with P^aln. The situation in this
respect keeps the public out of the market
and the speculators have been cautious and
quick to change their position. Liquidation
has apparently been thorough and complete
and stocks are largely in strong hands, so that
the floating supply is comparatively small. On
the other hand, successive covering movements
on reports of settlement or' compromise of the
differences between Spain and the United
States have reduced the short interest, which
was quite large last week. London has done
little here, but our market situation is watched
with close attention, as indeed it is by the local
public, and the resistance offered to bear sell
ing from time to time creates the impression
that the latent purchasing power is laige and
requires only a definite development of the gen
eral situation to assert itself with some force.
At the same time prices during the latter por- I
tlon of the week suffered from the feeling of j
some suspense caused by the withholding of
the President's message on Cuban affairs, and
the tendency of the market, in spite of rallies
on the short interest, was to sag irregularly
lower. The feeling of uncertainty about the
possible developments and their effect is shown
by the fact that the usual decision to close
the Stock Exchange for Good Friday was re
scinded and the market was in session to-day
for the first time upon that day in a genera
tion. No attention has been paid to develop
ments in regard to railroad earnings or other
matters of importance and the tendency of
prices was influenced but little either by the
conservatism of leaders or the high figures
at which time money is held by the decided
break in exchange.

CORONER AND
POLICE WILL
ACT AS ONE
Decide to Exhume the
Remains of Vidal
.Cervantes.
Suspicious Circumstances
Surrounding Her Death
to Be Investigated.
To-Day the Body "Will Be Con
veyed From the Cemetery
to the Morgue.
AUTOPSY WJLL FOLLOW.
If a Crime S : hall Be Discovered a De
termined Effort Will Be M^de
to Find the MurJerer.
After many days of thorough invest
igation into the sudden and mysterious
death of Vidal M. Cervantes, the po
lice and Coroner have decided to ex
humo the body which is buried in Lau
rel Hill Cemetery, and sift the insinu
ations and surmumling facts to the
very bottom. The police and Morgue
officials have delayed the last move
ment in the case for several reasons
best known to themselves, but as time
went by facts presented themselves
which made it necessary to take the
action contemplated.
Without doubt traces of prescribed
morphine will be found upon analysis,
but the opinion of the detectives who {
have been working on the case is that }
a foul deed will be uncovered with the j
removal of the earth which has for
days past covered the remains of an ill
treated woman. According to state
ments made by Coroner Hawkins, the
matter of fully investigating the case
from a medical standpoint was delayed
at the instance of Detective Anthony,
who wished the matter to be kept se
cret until his searches were completed. '>
But the detectives in turn state that
the whole matter rested in the hands
of the Coroner and there the case with
many peculiar circumstances has rest- ;
ed until it was determined to exhume
the remains.
The facts surrounding the case which
have arousui the suspicions of the po
lice have been carefully looked into. In
the first place the woman had been
married but about ten days and was
in a poor state of health at the time
of her marriage. After a few days'
treatment she died and was buried in
less than thirty-six hours, and the ex
ecutors of the estate applied almost im
)â .â¢â  (lately for the property. The sus
picion of the Police Department was
Amused and in consequence the Cor
oner's office was notified of the facts.
Jj. was hinted that the first wife of
the dead woman's husband had treated
the dying woman, and that within a
few hours after a physician had been
called in she had expired. The cause
was said to be cardiac failure, accom
panied or aggravated by asthma.
A certificate of death was signed by
the attending physician, but was not
countersigned by the Coroner; it was
accept. Hi by the Board of Health, al
though the physician had visited th<?
patient but twelve hours prior to death
and the law requires twenty-four hours'
attendance by the physician signing the
certificate of death. The undertakers*
had promised tho physician that they
would take the certificate to th't<
Morgue to be countersigned, but they
failed to do so.
However, after days of debating be
tween th" Coroner's office and the po
lice headquarters as to who should take
th" Initiative a conclusion has been ar
rived at. and within a day it will be
determned by analysis of th<* stomach
whether or not a party, or parties ars
to be held to answer for the murder ot
Vidal M. Cervantes.
TOURNAMENTS AT
THE OLYMPIC CLUB.
Two tournaments are in progress at the
Olympic Club at presentâ handball and
pool. The handball tournament is
causing a great deal of dissatisfaction
on account of the dictatorial meth
ods of Howard Taylor, leader of the
club. Hitherto the handball men have
played the tournament matches when it
suited their convenience, and complete
satisfaction resulted. Many matches
have already been played according to
the old system, but Taylor will not allow
them to go on the record. He has set the
time for the tournament games, and he
says they must be played accordingly.
Result, a general and terrifying howl.
The pool tournament has moved alone
regularly during the week, and is now on

THE ACADEMIC FIELD
MEET TO-DAY.
The eighth semi-annual field day of the
Academic Athletic League will bo fought
cut on the Olympic Club grounds this
afternoon. The events are as numerous
almost as the entries.- From the various
schools around the bay large contingents
of athietes will collect and race for
honors.
This city % will be represented by the
Lowell High* School, the Polytechnic and
the Lick High School. Berkeley Oak
land and Alameda will each have Its high
school athletes on deck. Even from Bel
numt, Tkiah and San Jose the youthful
brawn will display Itself. The competi
tion between these various preparatory
schools has never before been keyed ub
to such a tension.
The strongest teams will come from the
Oakland, Luweil, Polytechnic and Berke
ley high schools. The timers are the
must accurate men with the watch
around the bay. Phil Wand will handle
the starting. A large number of univer
â¢ity men will be present to keep an eye
on promising m<-n.
CRICKET WiLL SOON
BE IN FULL BLAST.
The officers of the Pacific Cricket Club
for the season of 1898 are as follows:
President, Captain John Metcalfe; vice
presidentsâ W. Ealnaves and R. C. Med
owmiti captain, E. C. Musaun; honorary.
secretary and treasurer. J. H. Harbour.
The principal players during â Â« coming
season will be John Myers, Artnur Dick
enson. Fane Sewell. George Theobald, J.
J. Theobald, Charles B. Hill. W. C. Cas
sidy. J. T. A. Tiedemann and E. P. MUB-
If the Bohemian Club organizes Itself
and ioins the California Cricket Asso
ciation, then the Webster street grounds
at Alameda will be shared by the Pacific
and Alameda clubs: but if me Bohemian
Club fails to et-t an eleven together to
play in the matches for the Hunter Har
rison cup, then the probability is that the
Pacific ciub will practice on the Golden
Gate grounds at Berkeley.
The Alameda Club practiced last Sat
urday on the Webster street "rounds,
and a special card was sent out request
ing all members to present themselves
for practice this (Saturday) afternoon.
The Lakeport Cricket Club held its an
nual meeting on the Ist or April, and de
cided not to Join the California ( rtcket
Association this season. The club has,
however, notified the secretary of the as
sociation of its willingness to aid in get
ting up a team for city vs. country
matches.
FOR INSANE CONVICTS.
Stnts Officials Recommend R Sep-
arate Hospital for Them.
A movement is on foot to petition the
Legislature for an appropriation for the
construction of a hospital for the deten
tion of insane convicts. There was a
meeting of an informal nature yesterday
of several of the members of the State
Commission in Lunacy and the State
Prison Directors, at which there were
sent Lunacy Commissioners W. -F.
Fitzgerald. Attorney-General: Dr. Hatch
and Dr. D. P. Matthews and Prison Di
rectors Robert Fitzgerald, " president;
Hayes. Williams and Ray.
After some discussion of the subject it
wes decided that the prison at Folsom
would be the best place for such a hos
pital as contemplated, the facilities for
building, climate, etc., being duly con
sidered, and io this end the annexed res
olution was passed:
"Resolved, That the Legislature be ur
gently requested to cause to be construct
ed a building to be located at Folsom
State Prison. Sacramento County, Cal.,
for the care and custody of criminal In
sane exclusively."
WILL PROBABLY
NEVER BE SOLVED
Expert Kytka Makes a Report
on the Bogus Jury
Slip?.
Is of the Opini n That None of
County Clerk Curry's Deputies
Wrote the Names.
It is now very probable that it will
never be known how the three bogus slips
got into the jury box in Judge Hunt's?
court. The matter is at present far more
mysterious than it was when the discov
ery of the crooked slips was first made
public.
Theodore Kytka, the hand-writing ex
pert, who was engaged to assist in the
work of finding the culprit, made his re
port yesterday in open court. He said he
had carefully examined the handwriting
on the slips and also the writing of all of
the deputies who had been engaged in tho
work of copying the names from the lists
furnished by the Superior Judges. That
investigation satisfied him that none of
the deputies had written the names on the
crooked slips. He said, however, that the
slips were the same as are used in the
County Clerk's office, and that the Ink
was the same. Inasmuch as slips similar
to those found in the box have betn in
use around the City Hall for years and
that the ink used in the office can be
found all over the city, no importance
coukl bo attached to the statement.
Jude Hunt looked puzzled when he
heard the expert's report and said he had
but little hope of ever getting at the bot
tom of the mystery. "At the next meet
ing of the Judges." he added. " I will rec
ommend that a new system of copying
the names of Jurors on the slips to be
placed In the jury box be Inaugurated. I
will recommend that all of the names be
copied by not more than two deputies,
and that they sign each slip. Then if
anything goes wrong, it will be an easier
matter to trace it."
After the court proceedings Kytka said
County Clerk Curry had offered him ev
en' assistance In hi? work.
"I have gone over all of the books in
tho County Clerk's office," said Kytka.
"and have the writings of all Lie deputies,
and I am satisfied that the name." on the
slips were not written by any deputy in
the office."
Hale & Norcross Case.
There was considerable excitement on
Pine street yesterday caused by the ru
mor that the long-expected decision by
the Supreme Court in the big Halo & Nor
cross suit had been handed down. The ef
fect was that for some reason not fully
understood the shares went down from
$1 GO to about $1, and there was a gen
eral disposition to "unload" large blocks
of that stock. The rumor was without
foundation, so far as the actual handing
down of the decision is concerned, but
there is every likelihood that the decision
has been prepared and will be handed
down to-day. AVhat the verdict will be
none can say, but the rapid downward
tendency of the stock shows that many
had the Idea it was better to be on the
safe side. The clerks in the Supremo
court were kept busy all day answering
that the decision was not yet in.
Used a Hatchet.
Toy Pan was yesterday held to answer
before the Superior Court by Judge
Joachimsen on a. charge of assault to
murder in $2000 bonds. March 18 he struck
Toy You on the head with a hatchet on
Dupont street and nearly killed him.
POLK-STREET HILL NO MORE.
The Improvement Club Wins and Good Streets
and Electric Lights Will Soon
Follow.
Contractors Warren & Malley have begun the long-delayed work of
cutting down the Polk-street hill. It is reported that the hill will be
completely excavated within three or four weeks and that soon after
the Sutter-street Railroad Company will extend its road to the bay.
"This is a great victory for the residents of Pc-lk street, and it really
completes in a large degree the work for which the Polk-street Im
provement Club was organized," said President Val Schniidt of the ex
ecutive committee yesterday.
There is great rejoicing throughout the neighborhood because the
work is being advanced so rapidly. For many months there seemed to
be no prospects that the hill would be removed. The contractors took
the Job at a very low price and refused to proceed with the work until
they had some need for the earth which they excavated. Time and
again they asked for an extension of time, and in every case it was
granted, because the cc-ntractors had taken the work at a rate much
lower than could be secured elsewhere.
Simultaneously with the work of tearing' down the hill and extend
ing the street to-the bay, thereby giving an outlet and a good view, the
Merchants' Association is making every effort to have the cross streets
lighted by electricity. This was one of the chief purposes of the organ
ization, aside from the extension of the street.
There has been a great deal of complaint that the streets in some
places were in bad repair, being full of ruts and otherwise in a bad !
condition. Property-owners are feeling encouraged because the Super
intendent of Streets has promised that all the evils complained of will
be remedied at a very early date.
"Taken together," said Mr. Schmidt yesterday, "the members of the
club feel that they have a great deal of cause to rejoice. We have now
practically accomplished everything we started out to do. When we
reorganize on a new basis soon our work" will be reduced to the gen
eral supervision of all that pertains to the good and welfare of this
part of the city."
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 1898.
LEES' NEPHEW
SOON TO BE
A CAPTAIN
Captain Robinson to
Tender His Res
ignation.
His Trip to the. East Is to
Wind Up His Father's
. Estate.
â¢ i
It Has Made Him Independ
ent of the Police
Business.
LEES KNEW HIS PURPOSE.
Reason Why Wolf Has Been Trained
in Prison Work and Tempora
rily Fills the Office.
The selection of Sergeant Wolf, Chief
Lees' nephew, .as captain of the City
Prison during the absence of Captain
Robinson in the East, which was pub
lished exclusively in The Call yester
day, was ' the subject of considerable
unfavorable comment in the depart
ment yesterday. ,*â '*"â¢
The real object' of the astute Chief In
getting his nephew promoted as ser
geant and detailing him to occupy his
time in mastering the routine work in
the prison came to light yesterday. It
is no other than to have his nephew
promoted to the position of captain of
the prison permanently.
Captain Robinson's father died last
year. He was a physician and planter
in Baton Rogue," La., and left a con
siderable estate to be divided among ;
his children. At the time of his death
Captain Robinson went East and not
long after he returned and he informed
Chief Lees of his Intention to quit the
police business, as he was "sick" of it.
His father's death had made him in
dependent, as his share' of the estate
would be between $12,000 and $15,000.
That with the money he had been able
to save while a member of the depart
ment would make him independent for
life. He has now gone East to' settle
up his father's estate, and when he re
turns he will, it is said, send in his res
ignation to â  the Police Commissioners.
Then he will go East to settle perma
nently there, as he has no ties to bind
him to this city. . .
Robinson, while a conductor, joined
the department on April 24, 1878, and h*
will have served twenty years in two
weeks more, when his resignation will
probably be sent in. As he is only
46 years old he will not, of course, get
a pension, but that need not worry him.
He was promoted to be sergeant on
February 20, 1894, and captain on July
31, 1895, in recognition of the prominent
part he played in the Chinatown brib
ery expose which resulted in the "^dis
missal of three sergeants and about
two dozen men. As a natural result
he has been shunned by his brother of
ficers, which explains his remark to
the Chief that he was "sick" of thÂ»
business. . .
Almost immediately after the Chief
knew of Robinson's intention to resign
his nephew was taken from street duty
and placed in different easy positions,
finally being detailed in the prison.
Since then he has been promoted -to bÂ«
sergeant and has been receiving ' dally
instruction from Robinson and Per
geant Lindheimer as to the duties that
will be required of him as captain of
the prison. Wolf's promotion has been
rapid. He was appointed on the force
on November 29, 1895, and was made
sergeant on February 10 of this year.
If his uncle's programme is carried out
he will be captain in a few weeks more.
" Commissioner Gunst will leave this
morning on a. six months' vacation, and
his absence from the city will do away
with the only opposition the Chief
mtirht reasonably expect to the ful
fillment of his r<et scheme to make his
nephew a. captain. The ; probability, is
that he ho? already Bounded Commis
sioners Tohin and Alvord on the sub
ject and has a clear field.
There are many able men op the fores
who have served the r city for years
faithfully and efficiently, and are qual
ified in every -way to satisfactorily per
form the duties of captain of the pris
on, and Wolf's apparent selection, to fill
the office simply because he happens
to be the Chief's nephew will not tend
to promote the best interests of the de
partment.
Popular Policeman Bead.
Policeman Peter Holland died at St.
Mary s Hospital yesterday morning from
an attack of bronchitis and pleurisy. He
was for years connected with the harbor
police and was a great favorite with the
public and his brother officers, owing to
nls genial and kindly ways. Before his

RICHMOND IS
PROGRESSIVE
Several Buildings in Course of
Construction in the
Valley.
The Cry for School â  Facilities Keep
Ringing in the Ears of the
Directors
From less than 500 inhabitants flvt
years ago, Richmond has to-day over 6000
located within its boundaries. And the
end is not yet, as several new buildings
are in the course of construction.
Within the past month Marcuse & Rem
mel have commenced the building of six
new dwellings on Sixth avenue, near Lake
street. These, when finished, will be sold
on the installment plan. Another, but on
a larger scale, is being constructed by the
same firm on Clay and Cherry streets.
In addition to these an option has been
secured on a couple of blocks farther
west upon which buildings will be erected
on the same plan.
The Increase In the value of real estate
at the present time as compared with
four years ago may be judged by prop
erty .on the line of First avenue, near
Sacramento street, which is now being
held at $225 a front foot. This increase is
owing to First avenue having been re
cently bituminized and partly accepted
by the city.
As an ideal road for wheelmen it offers
special inducements between the Presidio
j and Golden Gate Park. The wheelmen
j are alive to the Importance of this home
: run, us can be seen by a new cyclery
1 headquarters which will be opened at the
: corner of Point Lobos and First avenues
! during the coming week. Through the mi
i fluence of the Point Lobos Improvement
i Club the Park Commissioners have
agreed to make an opening into the park
at First avenue. This has been one of
the contentions of the Richmond people
for some time and now it is about real
ized, much to their joy.
This district is sadly In need of better
I school facilities for the children. As it
! now is there are by actual census over
; 500 children for whom there is no ac
commodation. The Richmond school
! building is overcrowded and the two
i shanties which have been rented for
i makeshift accommodation are in a slm
! iLar condition, with the above number
j still out.
This is the condition of affairs that has
! prompted the ladles of the district to
; make their influence felt at the club
i meeting recently held in the valley.
With the increase of population still on
j the advance an additional large school
| building is very much needed.
The district is by no means neglected
In spiritual matters as can be seen by the
number of churches located there. There
are the Richmond Congregational Church,
located on Seventh avenue and Clement
i street; St. James Episcopal, on Sixth q,ve-
I nue and Clement street; Star of the Sea,
I Roman Catholic, on Eighth avenue and
Point Lobos; Richmond M. E. Church, on
Fifth avenue; Baptist Mission, in the cen
ter of these, and the First Church of
; Christ (scientist). A new fraternal hall
has just been finished and added to tho
other Improvements of the district.
The old racecourse has at last been
filled In and added to the building area
several blocks which will in the near fu
ture be thrown open at public auction for
small holdings.
The Maria Kip Orphanage, which has
been recently occupied, has had the effect
of adding several children to the school
census for whom no provision was made
by the School Directors at the last school
estimate.
TONS OF FRESH FISH.
What the People of San Francisco
Consumed Last Year.
The State Fish and Game Commission
ers in preparing their customary report
to the United States Fish Commission
have, compiled a lot of valuable and in
teresting information relative to the com
mercial features of the finny tribe of the
rivers of this State. But few people
have any idea of the enormous* quantities
of fish taken from the waters of the riv
ers of California and sold for family
trade of San Francisco. The following
table has just been compiled by Secretary
Babcock of the fresh-water fish sold in
the markets of this city during last year:

Threatened With Violence,
J. FRANK BLUMER'S ACT.
Detective Gibson Searching for the
Guiliy One-New, Kept From a
S.ck Fattier.
Enticed away from her home under
the promise of obtaining employment,
placed in a dance hall and made to
yield up all her earnings, her life
threatened as a means of obtaining her
jewelry and other valuable posses
sions, forced to write letters home to
her parents picturing a roseate exist
ence, robbed of honor, that wa the
story told by Myrtle L. Armstrong, a
young and comely girl in a room in the
Goiden West Hotel yesterday, her hag
gard aspect and general appearance
bearing out only too truly the truth of
her tale of woe. By her side sat the
mother, Mrs. N. Armstrong, sorrowful
over the mishap that has befallen her
daughter, but not wholly miserable â
the joy at having her daughter again
with her doing much to soothe her an
guished heart.
J. Frank Blumer is the name of the
man who has caused the downfall of
the damsel and brought so much
trouble and heartrending sorrow into
the little Stockton home, where a short
time ago all was peace and quiet enjoy
ment. Even now Detective Gibson is
busily engaged in trying to locate Blu
mer, and if he is captured it will doubt
less go hard with him.
Day before yesterday the mother and
her daughter came to the Golden West
Hotel and registered under the names
of Mrs. N. Smith and Miss M. Smith.
The cause of their visit was made
known yesterday. The tale, as told by
the girl, who is about twenty years old
and rather pretty, is as follows:
"About three weeks ago Frank, who
worked in Atkins' printing c-ffice, told
me he was coming to San Francisco,
and that if I would come alpng he be
lieved he could get me profitable em
ployment as a domestic In some family
here. I talked the matter over with
my mother, but said little to my father,
who is lying dangerously ill, and we
concluded it would be a go-od thing for
me to accept the offer.
"Accordingly I packed up all my pos
sessions and came down here. As soon
as we were here the real nature of the
man, who had always appeared to be
a good fellow, asserted itself. He took
me to the Rosedale House on Ellis
street and secured a room. I was forced
to live with him by threats of violence.
He used to curse me and say he would
kill me in a way that was simply
frightful. I had to do his bidding in
everything. He got me work in a dance
hall at 216 Grant avenue, and as fast
as I made a dollar I had to give it to
him. He took my diamond ring and
let a man they call Billy McGro-gan
wear it, and my gold ring he pawned
at 22 Mason street. He has an opal
pin that is mine, if he has not already
pawned that, too.
"When I objected to anything he
would draw back his arm and threaten
to kill me. He stood over me while I
wrote the letters home, telling my
parents I was working in an honorable
way and was well satisfied, and he
would pc-st them himself. I was forced
to lead an awful life.
"Finally I made the acquaintance of
a man named 'Hermann.' He was also
called 'Charles' and other names, and
I don't know his surname. He is
around the Thalia Theater a good deal'
He learned of my plight and gave me
money to go home. This was a week
ago last Wednesday. Yesterday my
mother and I came down at the advice
of Sheriff Cunningham to see Detective
Gibson and have him get possession of
my property for me. The last we were
able to learn of Frank he was at some
place on Fifth street. He has in his
hands my trunk and valise, containing
my clothing, a silver toilet case and
some valuable belongings. All we want
now is to recover these and return
home, where my sick father is, as soon
as possible."
"Yes," echoed the mother, "that is all
we want now. Mr. Gibson will prob
ably get our property and we will go
home. The way my poor child has been
treated is simply awful, and we thought
this man so- nice. If it had not been
for this 'Hermann,' who is often seen
at the Thalia Theater, I don't know
what would have become of my daugh
ter."
Detective Gibson is now engaged in a
search for Blumer. He is described as
being about 26 years old, has brown
hair and goes smooth shaven. When
the girl last saw him he wore a gray
suit of the "pepper and sWt" variety.
As soon as the property belonging to
the girl is recovered the mother will
return to Stockton with her child.
Want Her Removed.
John P. Gallagher of the Hotel Lang
ham swore to a complaint In Judge Con
lan's court yesterday, charging Tillie
Belmont with keeping a disorderly house
at 115 Mason street. She was arrested by
Detective Cody, and was released on $150
cash ball. Albert C. Jewett. the pro
prietor of the house, haa requested her
to quit, but she holds the fort and the
property-owners on that portion of the
street have taken this action to force
her to remove to some other locality. A
petition was presented to the Police Com
missioners some months ago asking them
to take steps to purify the street, but
nothing was done.
"THE RED FRONT," 857-859 Market
street, sells "STANDARD" shirts. *
Must Keep the Peace.
W. B. Hellings. the San Pablo rancher
who was arrested for threatening to kill
his wife, was yesterday bound over to
keep the peace in $1000 bonds. He told the
Judge that he only meant to scare his
wife.
