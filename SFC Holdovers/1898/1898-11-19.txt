SEAMEN LOSE
THEIR LIVES
Bark Atalanta Goes Ashore
on the Coast of
Oregon.
Of Her Crew but Three Survive
After a Desperate Struggle in
the Breakers.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 18.â The bark Atalanta, bound
from Tacoma to South Africa, was wrecked upon Al
seya beach early yesterday morning. Twenty-four of
her crew of twenty-seven are missing, and the three men
saved are certain that their comrades either perished in the
breakers or are in imminent peril of their lives in the ruins of
the vessel. The survivors reached shore only after a terrible ex
perience.
When the Atalanta struck the bar her timbers at once
gave way and the whole crew made a rush for the hatchway.
They had hardly started when the vessel parted in the middle
and the masts snapped like kindling wood. The breakers swept
over the after decks and crashed through the cabin doors, and
then the men, seeing that the ship was doomed, sought safety.
A number who were on deck started to launch a life boat,
and while they were working with the davits a wave tore over
the deck and filled the boat. It dropped into the surf and al
most immediately filled with water. Five men were in it and all
but two were washed overboard. These two had no oars and
for hours they were buffeted about, powerless to choose their
course. In one of the sudden springs they found their craft
within arm's length of a third man, and at the risk of their
own lives they pulled him out of the surf.
For another hour the men were rocked upon the breakers
and then their boat was hoisted upon the crest of a great wave
high and dry upon the beach. Two of them were completely
exhausted, but the third still possessed a little strength, and he
ran through the wild country until he found a farmer, whom he
informed of the distress of his companions. Help was soon at
hand and all the men were taken to farm houses and cared for.
To-night one was unconscious, the others not in danger. No
one seems to know to what farm house they were taken or any
thing about them further than that they are survivors of the
wreck. The life saving crew is now looking for them.
The whole blame for the wreck is lodged with the captain.
He was too anxious to make a quick passage. All the way
down the coast he raced with another sailing vessel against
a terrific southwester. To make an advantageous tack he steered
close into Cape Foulweather, and not seeing the light supposed
his vessel to be far from the shore. Suddenly there was a
crash and the vessel began to go to pieces.
According to best accounts twenty-four lives are the penalty
(or the captain's rashness.
Notification of the wreck was not sent to the life saving
station twenty miles north of the bay for ten hours after the sur
vivors reached shore. Then the apparatus could not be hauled
down without horses, and by the time these were procured it
was too late and too dark to render effective service. Captain
Clark of the life-saving crew will make another attempt to reach
the vessel in the morning. Every wave is assisting in the de
struction of the bark.
Alseya Bay has no telegraph station and particulars are mea
ger. Reports from stations to the north state that the Cape
Foulweather light was concealed by a heavy fog when the wreck
occurred.
DISASTER DUE
TO THE CAPTAIN'S
FOOLHARDINESS
Carelessness Cost the Lives of Him-
self and His Crewâ Life-Savers
Handicapped in Attempts
to Beach the Wreck.
TAQUINA, Or., Nov. 18.â The ship
Atalanta, 2*oo tons burden, from Taco
ma, with wheat for an African port,
was wrecked off Alseya Bay early
Thursday mnrning and now lies about
a mile from shore in the midst of roar-
Ing breakers. She carried a crew of
twenty-seven men, only three of whom
survive, so far as known up to the
present time.
The story as told by the survivors Is
that the wreck was due to the care
lessness of the captain, who paid for his
folly with his life, as none of the offi
cers escaped. They were racing with
another sailing boat and were keeping
close in shore in order to get the ad
vantage of the wind In tacking and to
make r hort cut to head off the other
vessel. They were close in shore, and,
not seeing the light at Cape Foul
weather, steered ahead until they
struck the reef about four miles below
Alseya Bay a- ' about a mile and a
half from the shore, with such terrific
force as to snap the masts off like
toothpicks, carrying the rigging and
everything w r ith it.
The men at that time were trying
to launch a lifeboat, and two of them
The San Francisco Call
were carried over with it. They suc
ceeded in rescuing one of their com
panions from the mass of wreckage and
drowning sailors, but were soon swept
away by the gale. They were tossed
in the breakers for hours, half naked
and nearly perishing, without oars.
They were entirely at the mercy of the
storm until it finally deposited them on
the beach. One of them made hi? way
to a cabin, and, awakening the occu
pants, started them in all directions for
help, which it was impossible for them
to give.
After they had arrived on the scene
so thoroughly exhausted were the men
that after twenty hours one of them
had not yet recovered his physical and
menta\ powers fully.
The people wer- very slow in notify
ing the life-saving station at South
Beach, tventy miles away. The report
did not rÂ»ach Captain Clark until late
in the eveaing.
Captain Clark immediacy made
every effort possible to reach the wreck j
and rescue any one who might yet be, 1
on the wreck or penned up in the fore
castle, as supposed by the survivors.
Having no horses, they depended on
the neighboring farmers for assistance,
and obtained one team and a saddle
pony. The team was hitched to the j
surf boat wagon and the pony to the
cannon, and with tke crew and captain
pudbing with might and main they
struggled down the beach toward the
wreck, twenty /niles away.

DRIVEN TO DESTRUCTION ON A LEE SHORE.
The British Ship Atalanta, That Left Tacoma for Cape Town on the 12th Inst, Was Caught in the South
wester That Raged Along the Oregon Coast Last Wednesday and Went Ashore at Alseza Bay.
She Was Dismasted and Broke in Two. The Heavy Rollers That Broke on the Sandspit and
Over the Vessel Swept Her Decks Clear of Everything in a Few Minutes, ana Out of a Crew
of Twenty-Seven All Told Only Three Reached the Shore Alive.
PARTIAL LIST OF THE
MEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES
TACOMA, Nov. 18. â The names of the
Atalanta's entire crew are not obtain
able, not having been filed with either
Shipping Commissioner Steel or British
Consul Alexander. The names of those
who joined the ship here and signed
before the British Consul are:
D. F. GBEEN, able seaman, aged
31, Chapel place, Dublin.

Captain Charles McÃride. or "Prince
Charles," as he was best known, was a
great favorite among local marine men.
The ship Atalanta sailed on Saturday
afternoon for Cape Town with 92.509
bushels of wheat. She was the lost ship
to start in the triple race to the Cape
then all forces were applied on the can
non and beach cart. They arrived at
Alseya early in the mornln- and, hur
rying to the wreck, found they were
unable to do anything, as the ship was
beyond the reach of their lines and
their cannon was useless.
The ship had broken in two and the
waves were dashing over her. Large
pieces oÂ£ her works were being carried
away with each successive wave.
The beach is strewn with wreckage
of all descriptions.
If the story of the rescued sailors is
correct the officers of the bark were
responsible for this awful disaster. It
is to be hoped that when the apparatus
of the life-saving crew arrives and they
are able to reach the wreck they will
find that some of the seamen have
weathered it out until help arrived.

Alseya Bay and river are between
CaDe Perpetua and Yaquina Bay. be
ing sixteen miles from Newport, which
is on Yaquina Bay, and eight miles
north from Cape Perpetua. The south
head is an abrupt, long, rounding cliff
oi sandstone of less than 100 feet in
height and covered with trees. The
nSrth point is broad, low and sandy
three-quarters of a mile long and
covered with driftwood. The entrance
to the river is one-quarter of a mi c
wide at the narrowest part. There is
no well denned channel and the depth
of water is from five to eight feet. A
mile and a quarter inside the entrance
the river expands into a bay about a
mile wide and one and five-eighths
miles long. It is filled with sand flats.
On the north side of Alseya Bay is
the small town of Collins and on the
south side is the town and Postofflce
of Waldport. Broad off the mouth of
the bay and eighteen miles from shore
there is seventy fathoms of water on
a sandy bottom.
A strong current, called the "David
son inshore eddy current," sets into
Alseya Bay. As an experiment the
Dawn, a steam launch that used to run
between Astoria and Ilwaco, was towed
to near Cape Orford and there cast off.
She then drifted northward in the cur
rent to the Alseya River, a distance of
ninety-five miles.
Juat how the Atalanta got ashore at
this particular place may never be fully
known. She left Tacoma on November
12 and passed Cape Flattery the same
day. Six days later she is wrecked
about 400 miles from her starting point.
"It was blowing a southwester on the
of Good Hope, to be participated in by
the ships Earl of Dalhousie, Imber
horne and Atalanta. The latter was
known in maritime circles as a crack
clipper and breaker of passage records,
having made many quick passages be
tween London and India. Captatn Mc-
Bride confidently expected to win the
race to Cape Town. The wager In
volved was the good-natured one of a
champagne dinner at Cape Town, to be
paid for by the ship making the longest
passage.
The general opinion among shipping
men here is that Captain McÃride was
caught in the heavy southwest gale
after being given an offiner by a tug
outside of Cape Flattery. The weather
came on thick and the ship picked up
the southerly set of the Japan current
running down the coast. This set, to
gether with his lee drift, brought Mc-
Bride into the breakers before he was
aware of his position, there being no
clear weather for an observation. This
theory is made more plausible through
the fact that the Atalanta was obliged
to take anchorage in Clallam Bay, in
the Straits of Fuca, ou arriving there
because of the heavy gale and nasty
sea prevailing outside Cape Flattery.
He was windbound there ten hours and
then proceeded to sea.
I Oregon coast last Wednesday," said an
I old coasting captain yesterday, "and
I Judging by the seas outside it must
have been a ccrked. The chances are
that the Atalanta was caught in it and
was driven back. Then the compasses
may have been at fault and in a gale
there the current runs as much as four
or five mil's an hour, and then the
magnetic iron ore on the beach may
have helped along, and the nrst thin*?
those aboard knew the Atalanta was
hard and fast on the sand spit that
runs out from the north point of Alseya
Bay."
The Atalanta was built in 1885 at Port
Glasgow by R. Duncan & Co. She was
1693 tons net burden, 265.1 feet long, 39.7
feet broad and 23.4 feet deep. She was
owned by N. Hill of Greenock. The
insurance on both hull and cargo was
placed in England. Captain McÃride,
who was In command of the Atalanta,
took charge of her the day she was
launched and was in command of her
to the last. She was a painted port
ship, very like the British ship Illawara
that left here for Sydney a few days
ago with a cargo of barley and flour.

QUEENSTOWN, Nov. 18.â Something
in the nature of a sensation has been
caused here by the extraordinary con
duct of Captain Johnson, commander
of the British steamer Brlarden, Khich
arrived here on October 21 from New
York extensively damaged by severe
weather, during which she was almost
submerged for ten days. Since that
time the Brlarden has been repairing
for a passage west.
The Briarden was seized this morning
by a marshal of the Admiralty Court
for debt, and a bailiff was placed on
board of her. The captain determined
to defy the court and started for Dela
ware breakwater. But the pilot, who
was on board, refused to navigate the
ship out of the harbor, with the result
that the captain attempted to do so
and grounded the Briarden off Hall
Bow Light. Two hours later she was
floated off.
In the meanwhile the Admiralty
Court officials communicated with the
admiral in charge of this station and
the latter sent a steam pinnace to in
tercept the Briarden. The pinnace met
the Briarden as the latter was passing
out of Queenstown harbor at full
speed and ordered her to stop. The
captain of the steamer paid no atten
tion to the summons, but continued on
his way to sea as fast as the engines
of the Briarden could drive her, with
the little pinnace in hot pursuit. The
chase was watched by excited crowds
ashore. Off Spike Island the Briarden
had completely outdistanced the pin
nace and the latter gave up the pur
suit.

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 18.^Tohn W.
Keeley, the inventor of the Keeley
motor, died to-day at his home in this
city from pneumonia. He was taken ill
on Saturday last and continued to grow
steadily worse until his death. Mr.
Keeley was 61 years of age and leaves
a widow.
He was a native of this city. His
education was meager and at an early
age he became a carpenter, following
that trade until 1872.
It was in that year that he announced
the discovery of a neÂ»v force by which
motive power would be revolutionized.
Following this he constructed what has
become known as the Keeley motor.
On November 10, 1874, he gave its first
public exhibition before a number at
capitalists and scientists, who advanced
$100,000 to enable him to perfect his dis
covery and apply the principle. Since
then large sums of money have been,
expended on experiments without any
practical public results.
Between 1874 and 1891 Keeley con
structed and discarded 129 different
models. In the first model he employed
water as a generator, but later the ex
periments were made with what he
called a "liberator," a machine equip
ped with a large number of tuning
forks, which, he claimed, disintegrated
the air and released a powerful etherlo
force.
In 1888 he was for a time confined in
jail for contempt of court for refusing
to disclose the secret by which he pro
duced many remarkable effects in the
presence of experts, but until his death
the secret was knawn only to himself.
Among those interested in his scientific
efforts was Mrs. Bloomfleld Moore, the
well-known society woman, who ad
vanced sums of money to Keeley for
the purpose of his invention.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 18.â Count
John Thun of Austria, who has arrived
here from Japan, came across Asia over
the route of the Trans-Siberian Rail
road. He left Moscow last May.
For some two hundred versts beyond
Irkutsk the journey was full of great
peril and required nine days and nights
of hard traveling, a greater part of the
time afoot, to go the distance.
Work upon this part of the road had
been well advanced a year or so ago.
but an era of unprecedented storms set
in and embankments and bridges to the
value of about 4,300,000 roubles were
â washed away. The work of restoring
them during the past summer was
greatly Interfered with by swarms of
insects and other pests which made it
impossible for the men to work.
Count Thun says it is Intensely cold
all along the line of the road, and for
the most part a barren and utterly
desolate country.
A region some 200 versts In extent In
each direction north of Manchuria in
China is undoubtedly full of almost
inexhaustible gold fields, but the ex
treme cold will not permit them to be
worked for more than three months in
the year. The road will, he thinks, be
completed in about two years' time, and
will be valuable chiefly in the move
ment of soldiers.

Conducting Operations in Defiance of American
Adviceâ May Hasten the Treaty
of Peace.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18. â Newa of an important character came
to the Navy Department to-day from Admiral Dewey touching the
situation in the Philippines. The Admiral sent two of his warships,
the Charleston and Concord, some time ago to the southward from
Manila to ascertain whether there was truth in the report that the
Spanish had extended their action in that direction.
The cablegram sent by Admiral Dewey is as follows:
"JIAXILA. Nov. IS.â Secretary of the Navy, Washington: Charles
ton and Concord arrived to-day from Hello. They report that the en
tire islands are in possession of the insurgents except Iloilo, which
is defended by Spanish troops. All foreign citizens there as=k for
American protection. The island of Negros has declared independence
and desires American protectorate, DEWEY."
Glass is the commander of the
Charleston. So far nothing has been
done by the administration toward
curbing the insurgents in their opera
tions, save verbal representations from
the American commanders to Aguinal
do, in which it has been pointed out to
him that it would be good policy, in
view of the probability of the annexa
tion of the islands by the United Stales
to pursue a course that would not be
obnoxious to the United States. But
the situation is now realized to be
critical. So far as the Spaniards are
concerned perhaps they can be left to
take care of themselves, but the for
eign residents at Iloilo are differently
regarded.
The difficulty in the situation is that
with the best intentions to intervene to
protect the Europeans and other for
eigners and to save the city of Iloilo,
the second in importance in the Philip
pine group, from looting, the United
States forces appear to be stopped un
der the rules of war from moving from
their positions. Such is the construc
tion placed upon the clause in the pro
tocol relating to a suspension of hos
tilities.
The immediate effect of this state of
affairs may be to hasten action in the
Paris conference, for it is only by the
termination of that tribunal that the
United States can come to the relief of
the beleaguered Spaniards in Iloilo and
other points. It is said to be a fact,
however, that a total disagreement at
Paris may result in speedier action
than if the commissioners agreed upon
the main principles of the Philippine
cession, for in such case several ad
ditional sessions probably would be re
quired in order to arrange the details
of the treaty.
It is now thought to be certain that
the commission at a meeting next Mon
day or Tuesday will do one of two
things, i. c., either agree to the oes-
Blon of the Philippines or note a dis
agreement and dissolve the meeting,
for the administration is not disposed
to tolerate further delay and has so
instructed the United States commis
sioners. The latter sent a long cable
gram to-day in cipher. The decipher
ing occupied the entire official day
and meantime there were wild ru
mors touching the nature of its con
tents. As a matter of fact it was noth
ing more than an extremely verbose

MOLINE, 111.. Nov. IS.â Dr. William P.
Bensibaugh, a dentist of Port Byron, just
east of this city, is in a serious condition
as a result of pranks played on him while
being initiated in a fraternal insurance
lodge in that village.
During the initiatory ceremonies ho was
blindfolded and given several shocks from
a live wire. The bandage over hit
having become loosened, he sought to out
wit those who were having fun at his ex
pense by locating the wire and attempting
to avoid it. One of the initiating team,
seeing the candidate was about to evade
the wire, gave him a little shove, which
proved sufficient to throw him off his bal
ance. He fell hands down on the battery
itself, receiving a shock which rendered
him unconscious.
After working over him for two hours
and finally reviving him. it was discovered
that his right arm hung limp and loose,
and in this condition it has remained ever
eince. A week ago the doctor was stricken
with an affection of the pneumogastrie
nerves. Since then he has been kept up
mainly through electrical treatment. One
of the* attending physicians says paralysis
of the nerve? is threatened, in which
event the sufferer cannot live.

TO RAISE SPANISH WARSHIPS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The Unit
ed States navy will soon possess more
than a sprinkling of foreign built war
ships. Admiral Dewey has informed
the Navy Department that he has con
tracted with a Plongkong firm of
wreckers to raise three of the Spanish
war vessels sunk in the battle of Ma
nila last May day. The cost of raising
the ships and putting them into thor
ough repair will be $500,000. The ves
sels to be raised are gunboats of large
type, and in the opinion of Chief Con
structor Hichborn they will be the very
best kind of craft for the protection of
the United States' interests among the
Philippines and along the Asiatic coast.
They are the sister ships Isla de Cuba
and Isla de Luzon and the Don Juan de
Austria.
MADRID WILL ACCEPT.
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â A cablegram
to the Sun from Paris says: The situ
ation justifies the assertion that peace
is at last in sight. The Madrid Gov
ernment has definitely decided to accept
the American terms, or rather the best
terms available. Instructions to this
effect have been received by Senor
Montero Kios, president of the Spanish
Commission, and his associates, from
Prime Minister Sagasta, and although
Senor Montero Rios does not withdraw
his declaration that he will never yield
to the American demands, there can
be no doubt of the final result.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The Cabinet
session to-day was devoted to a large
extent to the consideration of complaints
that have reached the War Department
alleging a state of practical anarchy in
Porto Rico.
These complaints assert that the law
less elements are committing depredations
of the gravest character, and that the
seriousness of the situation is increased
by the fact that United States troops
likewise have been guilty of gross mis
conduct. Secretary Alger, at the in
stance of the President, cabled General
Brooke inquiring as to the accuracy of
thp complaints.
The most serious allegations are against
brigands and lawless elements in the
smaller towns away from the coast. It
is said that, taking advantage of the un
settled state of tne country due to the
transfer of the Government from Spain
to the United States, bands of men have
organized for robbery and rapine, burn
ing houses and plantations and levying
tribute upon the people wherever possi
ble. In one cafe, it is said, they made a
raid on a small town of about 15.000 in
habitants, fifteen miles from the nearest
troops, and burned and destroyed prop
erty to a considerable value.
(ir-npral Brooke at San Juan has been
Instructed to use th<> full strength of the
military forces at his command for the
suppression of rioting and the restoration
of peace and order in the land.
SENATOB PERKINS BANQUETED.
Entertained at the Sutter Club in
Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. IS.â A number of
prominent citizens of Sacramento ten
dered a banquet to-night at the Sutter
Club to Senator Perkins, who made many
warm friends during his residence in this
city years ago. A large attendance was
present. Frank Miller presided, and ad
dresses of welcome were made by Dr. G.
L. Simmons, William Schaw and H. =Wein
stock, sketching the success achieved by
the guest of the evening in the various
walks of life from his youth up.
Senator Perkins responded feelingly,
testifying his appreciation of the welcome
and outlining his opinions on the subjects
of expansion and the Nicaragua Canal.
Congressman Marion de Vries was also
called on and gave his views on the same
subiects. Both the speakers were enthu
siastically received and the affair was a
decided success.

NEFF'S FRIENDS NAME
HIM FOR THE SENATE
JACOB H. NEFF, WHO IS BEING BOOMED BY HIS FRIENDS
FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR.
AUBURN, Nov. 18.â The friends here of the Hon. J. H. Neff, Lieu
tenant Governor-elect, have started a quiet boom for that gen
tleman for the United States senatorship.
It is understood that Mr. Neff is averse to the using of his
name, but his admirers claim that he is the most popular man
in California and his selection would bring more general satisfaction
to the whole people than any other man's.
Mr. Neff was seen last night at his apartments at the Palace and
was much surprised at the announcement of the kindly intentions of
his friends.
"Dear me," said the Lieutenant Governor-elect, "more honors for
me, eh? Well, now I want yo-u to say for me, and say it strong, that
I have not been and under no circumstances will I be a candidate for
the United States Senate.
"It iÂ» very kind of my friends to wish so well of me, but I wish
they had not gone quite so far. I repeat that under no conceivable
circumstances will I become a candidate for the Senate."

Discontent of the Army Made the
Most Of by the Followers
of the Spanish
Pretender.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 19.â The Madrid
correspondent of the Standard, whose
dispatch is forwarded from the Span
ish frontier, says: The state of the
army causes anxiety in politi
cal and official circles. It is
an open secret that officers of all
ranks and the repatriated soldiers are
discontented â first, at the non-payment
of arrears, and then because they are
profoundly mortified at the manner in
which the war was conducted, which
prevented the army getting a much
desired opportunity of coping with the
Americans, as they believed the army
would have turned the tide in Spain's
favor.
Thus far the Republicans have not
attempted -to tamper with the loyalty
of the army, but the Carlists are posi
tively trying to do so in Catalonia and
Valencia. They announce th impend
ing publication of a manifesto, chiefly
addressed to the artillery, declaring
that Don Carlos no longer considers
himself bound to show any considera
tion for the present dynasty and Gov
ernment, whose shortcomings and er
rors have involved the loss of both
territory and honor.
The Carlists' threats are now so open
that all classes denounce their propa
ganda. The Madrid press sarcastically
advises the Government not to allow
itself again to be painfully surprised
by the Carlist rising as it was by the
Cuban and Philippine rebellions. Gen
eral Wevler is regarded by Snanish of
ficials as the most powerful and popu
lar amontr them. He seems inclined to
avoid political intrigues, and even
shows a disposition to support Senor
Sagasta and the Queen Regent. Neither
Marshal Campos nor General Pola
vieja enjoys equal prestige with the
army. _______________

WAR ON OREGON PRUNES.
San Jose Grange Fighting for the
Local Froduct.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 18.â San Jose Grange
is making a determined fight against thÂ«
marketing of Oregon prunes in San Jose.
Lately, it is charged, many Oregon
prunes have been sold here and sent East
as Santa Clara County prunes.
While this year it is conceded that they
are larger than the local prune crop, it
is contended that they are inferior in
flavor and that they lack sugar. As a re
sult the local growers are making war on
them. It is now said that the Santa
Clara County dealers, or a majority of
them, will refuse to handle Oregon prunes
in the future.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JI7NEAIT, Alaska, Nov. 10 fby steam
ship Cottage City). â In the cook's gal
ley of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany's steamer Dora, which arrived
here to-day, was a woman in male at
tire. She was busy washing dishes. She
had on a pair of dilapidated shoes,
which some one had thrown to the four
winds of Copper River, and through
which peeped several pink toes; ragged
trousers, no suspenders, an old under
shirt and a red handkerchief for- head
covering. But it was evident the
woman had the sympathy and respect
of the passengers and crew. Her ap
pearance was a magnet to people on
the dock, who swarmed amidship to
see her. Perceiving herself the object
of so much doubtful curiosity the poor
woman hid herself in humiliation. Her
story Is far tougher than she looked.
John Henderson and wife, not much
more than a year out of Finland â even
to which uttermost part of the earth
had spread news of the riches of the
Klondike â sailed for New York, thence
traveled to Alaska, and found them
selves last May facing the Valdez gla
cier, that icy gatev ay to the Copper
River Valley. They sold everything
they owned in Finland and invested the
money in transportation and a fine
outfit sufficient for two years' prospect-
Ing.
They didn't find any gold in the Cop
per River country, and about a month
ago decided to come out. John Hen
derson and wife and another man,
without experience in navigation suf
ficient to steer a prairie schooner over
a smooth surface, attempted to go
through the fearf-1 rapids of the Cop
per River Canyon in a small boat
where the water rears and plunges as
it does over the seal rocks at the Cliff
House on a stormy d.ay.
Mrs. Henderson was kindly permit
ted by the two men to remain in the
boat while they went above on the edge
of the canyon with a small rope to let
the boat down through the rapids as
they walked along. The line parted at
a knot. Then away as swift
as an arrow shot the boat and the good
wife. Her farewell was a look of hor
ror and a scream.
Who has not seen a kite, which has
dropped its tail, whirl in circles and
swoop hither and thither in the sky?
In that same way rode the boat and
Mrs. Henderson through that water.
When they found her she was lying
half dead and bent around a boulder
by the current. Her boots were gone,
her clothing almost torn from her body,
and she was bleeding.
Their boat and all their effects lost,
they stood at the rim of the raging tor
rent and tried to count the days be
tween them and death by starvation.
But the weather was kind to them if
the water was not, and in three days
they were able +o make their way to an
Indian camp on the lower river. The
two men divided their clothing with
Mrs. Henderson. One gave her his
shirt and trousers: the other his coat
and shoes. They traveled with the In
dians and finally made their way to a
point near Kanik, on Cooks Inlet,
where the Dora picked them up.
This is the last trip of the Dora for
the season, and she stopped at nearly
every place where smoke was seen on
the shore in order to pick up stragglers
and save them from a terrible winter.
Captain Johannson did what he could
to assist the Hendersons. The husband
was set to work as a deckhand and his
wife was permitted to make herself
useful in the galley.
The unfortunate condition of Mrs.
Henderson became known to a number
of ladies of Juneau through the me
dium of Martha White, a passenger
from Cooks Inlet. The latter said she
had been running a hotel at Sunrise
City, and after a week in Seattle would
go to her home in Elmhurst, Alameda
County, to spend the winter. She ex
hibited a bottle of fine gold which she
said was taken from several claims she
has acquired in the Resurrection River
district.
Mrs. Major Orton and Mrs. C. Li.
Parish interested themselves in Mrs.
Henderson's behalf. In the few hours
before the Dora sailed to Seattle and
probably thence to San Francisco for
the winter they had secured for Mrs.
Henderson from generous merchants a
complete outfit of clothing, from shoes
to jacket and hat, and raided by gen
eral subscription and presented to her
the sum of $38.
These most unfortunate of Copper
River gold seekers are going to Pan
Francisco, where they have been told
there is a Finnish Consul, whom they
will ask to help them get work. In her
complete costume Mrs. Henderson
looked a tall and attractive woman.
The Dora brought down the last of
the Copper Riverites. She is the last
ship from the westward, and there will
be no more communication with that
vast section of Alaska till next spring.

NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald sends the following: It is the confident expectation of the ad
ministration to-night that within twenty-four hours Spain will give
the American Peace Commissioners to understand that she will prp
testingty comply with their demands for the cession of the Philippines.
A Cabinet official said to-day he believed the treaty of peace would toe
in preparation within a week. This feeling is based upon advices
which haye been received from Mr. Da,y showing that he and his col
leagues are satisfied that there will be no interruption of the negotia
tions, and that consequently the Spanish representatives will agree to
the transfer of the archipelago.

Eleven Workmen Killed
Outright.
SEVERAL FATALLY INJURED
WERE REPAIRING TRACK IN A
DENSE FOG.
They Failed to Hear the Approaching
Train and Were Ground to

Wheels.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â While twenty
track hands were at work upon the
Pennsylvania Railroad line over the
Hackensack, near Jersey City, to-day,
they were run down by a local pas
senger train. Eleven of the workmen
were killed outright and six were seri
ously injured. Following are the killed:
Frank Bodoski.
Giuseppe Colasurdo.
Thomas Doherty.
Thomas Flannagan.
Joseph Faggea.
Michael Lawless.
Nicola Lucci.
Frank Ludowski.
Angelo Puggo.
Frank Slumisky.
Giuseppe Stinziano.
The injured are: Lawrence Hoffman,
Michael Miller, Frank Swanzekoweki,
who will die, John Wangdon.
The accident occurred about two and
a half miles west of Jersey City, Just
beyond the Hackensack River bridge.
At that point there are four tracks, two
devoted to passenger and two to freight
traffic. At the north are the shops and
tracks of the Delaware, Lackawanna
and Western Railway.
Foreman Quirk took out a gang of
nineteen men at 8 a. m. to repair track
Xo 4â the westbound freight trackâ at
that place. Quirk saw that the fog
meant danger, so he sent ahead two
men. Lawless and Doherty, to give
warning of approaching trains. Law
less was to go west and Doherty east
and cover all the tracks. They were to
shout warnings at the approach of
trains. The passenger tracks were kept
busy with incoming suburban trains
and the smoke and steam from these
trains helped to make the atmosphere
more dense.
Suddenly at about 8:30 there was a
shout from Lawless, who was the ad
vance guard of the gang.
"Train No. 3," he cried.
It was an eastbound freight tram
that came along slowly, leaving behind
it a heavy pall of smoke. The men
who were scattered along the track
jumped out of the way. Almost all of
them jumped over to track No, 1, the
eastbound passenger track. The heavy
smoke enveloped them, and the men,
many of them new hands on the road,
shivered with fright, for they could not
see and could scarcely hear the ap
proaching trains that followed^ the
freight.
Lawless, too, had jumped across to
track No. 1, keepincr all the time a
sharp lookout. Suddenly there was a
rumble of wheels and the shriek of a
whistle. The Millstone local, delayed
by fog, was coming along at the rate
of forty miles an hour. Lawless was
struck and thrown thirty feet away,
mangled and bleeding.
On went the train. Engineer Van
Norstand had scarcely noticed the
man's body flying through the air

it plowed into the mass of cowering
men who stood huddled together on the
traok.
"It was an awful sight," said the en
gineer, later. "There was a mass or
legs and arms and heads flying througft
the air. I was drenched with blood. I
knew that something terrible had hap
pened, and put on the air brakes as
hard as possible.
"When the train came to a standstill
the passengers rushed out. The track
was covered with blood. The meadows
and the track looked like a battlefield
covered with bodies. The shrieks of
the dying drowned the cries of the hor
rified passengers. Women fainted and
men turned away in horror. Of the
nineteen men, nine were dead and six
wounded. Some one telephoned quickly
to Jersey City. Many of the bodies
still writhing in mortal agony, were,
placed on the train and borne to the
city. Two of the wounded died on the
way. A relief train brought back the
others."
William Quirk, the foreman of th&
gang of men, made this statement:
"The smoke and fog are to blame.
My men were Jn a cloud of smolie when
the calamity came upon us. I had Mi
chael Lawless stationed about , fifty
yards ahead of the gang to give us
warning. Lawless was struck first and
cut to pieces. My men were mowed
down like grass."
There were harrowing scenes when
the bodies reached the Pennsylvania
railroad yards in Jersey City. The rel
atives of the dead were beside them
selves with grief. Half a dozen women
were overcome and had to be taken
home by the police.

PANA, 111., Nov. 18.â The town has been
kept in a state of terror all evening by
numerous encounters between negroes and
striking miners. Both are heavily armed
and use their ammunition freely. About
7 o'clock Deputy Sheriff Sid Watts, who
was returning from the Springside mine,
where he had been on duty, was shot from
ambush. The bullet took effect in his
right arm, which had to be amputated.
A number of residences have been pierced

; Unheard from SI
SAN FRANCISCO'S new charter will be ratified by the
Legislature. Such is the verdict of a majority of the
members of both houses of California's law-making body,
and as such it may be received by the people of this city
as an authoritative denial of all the rumors to the contrary that
have gone abroad since the voters of San Francisco expressed
their wishes at the late charter election.
The Call, believing that the acceptance or rejection of the
new charter by the Legislature is a matter in which every per
son is interested to a greater degree than in any other measure
that will come up for final action at the coming session of the
Legislature, has. as far as has been possible to do so. taken a
poll of the Assemblymen and Senators who are entitled to seats
in the Legislature on the subject of their views concerning the
disposition that should be made of San Francisco's new charter.
Replies have been received from more than half of the legis
lators, and in no single instance has a reply signified a desire to
vote against the ratification of the charter. A few of the legis
lators were non-committal for the reason that they were unfa
miliar with the issues involved, and therefore did not feel com
petent to express an opinion one way or the other. The great
majority, however, were outspoken in their desire to ratify the
wishes of the voters of this city as expressed by the result of the
charter election. This majority favorable to the ratification of
the charter is so overwhelming as to leave no doubt as to what
the result will be when the question is to be put to a vote dur
ing the coming session of the Legislature.
Many of the legislators of whom telegraphic inquiry was
made by The Call could not be found immediately, and it is
therefore impossible to secure their views on the subject of the
charter. This fact, while regrettable, does not in any way affect
the result, as enough replies were received to make certain what
action will be taken by the Legislature.
All of the replies received are here printed in full, in order
that the reader may judge as to the meaning sought to be con
veyed by each legislator in making his answer to the question
propounded.
The result of this poll, which has involved some time and
trouble and no inconsiderable expense, will no doubt be gratify
ing to a majority of the citizens of San Francisco. It will at
least set at rest the baseless rumors that have been circulated
concerning the action that will be taken by the Legislature in
the matter of the city's proposed new organic law.
STANFORD'S MEN
AT THE SPRINGS
Football Candidates in
Fine Spirits.
WEEK OF SECRET PRACTICE
COACH CROSS WILL BE ABLY
ASSISTED.
List of Sick and Injured Larger Than
Ever Before in the History of
the Game at Palo
Alto.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CONGRESS SPRINGS, Nov. 18.â The
Stanford football squad arrived at Con
gress Springs Hotel to-day at 1 o'clock,
for a week's secret practice before the
big gar. > with Berkeley next Thurs
day. There are thirty-four players,
Coaches Cross and Clemens. '93, and
Manager Prichard. As the- drew ud
before the hotel they were greeted by
the feve: convalescent squad that was
sent up last Tuesday to recover from
malaria. They are all very much im
proved.
The men were in fine spirits, but they
do not move and look like athletes |
ret?'''- for the finishing touches after a
wason's training. Trainer McLeod
eald th-t their apparent listlessness
â was due to the hot weather they had
on the university campus and the very
fcard practices before coming up. It is
hoped that the mountain air will soon
have them edge. The inexperi
enced colt* of this year's team are a
different aggregation from the old vet
erans of last year's team. They over
n.-i the place, and arc as anxious as
small boys to try every game and see
everything within two miles of the
hotel.
The men on the injured and sick lists
are more numerous than ever before in
the history of the game at Stanford.
The following men with good varsity
prospects are shelved: Fisher, slightly
stale; Wilson, right varsity tackle, has
water on the knee, may be kept out of
the game on account of it; James, tried
to play this afternoon but was soon
forced to retire on account of weakness
which still holds on from his recent ill
ness! Oilman, not practicing because of
a broken nose; Plate, a badly twisted
knee and will be unable to play for a
few days.
The second team suffers more from
losa of men than the varsity. It has
laid off Emerson, Nourse, McFadden,
Erb, Bentley, Eaton and Beckett, each
being either sick or injured.
Coaches Harry Cross and Clemens
have outlined a stiff programme for the
squad. It will rise at 6:30 and take a
short run up the hills, followed by
breakfast at 7. The men may then be
at liberty until 10:30, whon they line
up for an hour of signal practice.
Luncheon comes at 12. The heavy
afternoon practice begins at 2:30 and
lasts until the coaches call it off. Din
ner at 6, and by 9:30 every man is
tucked into his bed.
This afternoon's practice was hard
and heavy, with spirited spurts by the
second team. Hill scored the only
touchdown for the Scrubs made dur
ing the game. Rurmlster came out
again and soon earned a place on the
varsity. 'James played on the varsity,
but had to withdraw in a short Mme.
Cox took his place and did ~ood work.
Dole hurt his injured foot and retired.
Geissler played on the varsity a short
time. He twisted his neck and is now
under Trainer McLeoi's care. Beckett
was the only other man forced to retire
during the game.
Freeman played center on the varsity
and seÂ«ms to be the man for the
position. His passing it not up to the
standard, but his defensive and offen
sive work was very fine. Burmister
backed up his line and bucked the
center in good form. Rusk also played

Cars of Dried Fruits Out Thirty or
Forty Days and Nothing Has
Yet Been Heard of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 18.â Fruit men are
complaining of the delay in the arrival
of California dried fruits and blame the
Southern Pacific for unsatisfactory
service.
R. S. Mclntosh of Porter Bros. & Co.
said: "We have had cars out thirty
or forty days and have heard nothing
from them. I don't know whether they
are at New Orleans or not, but I do
know all buyers are complaining they
are not able to fulfill their contracts.
It seems to me the Southern Pacific
has acted very independently in the
matter and could have given us much
better service if it had wished."
Mr. Clappe of Francis H. Leggett &
Co. said: "There are large arrivals of
dried fruits, but they are far behind the
quantity which should be here and
which is under order. At the beginning
of the season we were persuaded by
the Southern Pacific to route our goods
at the people directly concerned, and.
having this opinion, the charter will
have my vote. JOHN BOGGS.

Editor Call: I feel myself bound to
support the new charter and will en
deavor to secure its ratification.
LAWRENCE A. HENRY,
Assemblyman. Forty-second District.
Editor Call: The platform of the
legislative and judicial convention from
which I received my nominatio-n pledged
the candidates for the Legislature to
vote for the ratification of the char
by their system on account of superior
facilities at this end of the line. But
these facilities do not count for much
as long as the goods have not arrived.
Imposition of quarantine at New Or
leans caused a heavy congestion of
traffic at that port, which was held un
til the quarantine was raised. Instead
of sending these goods forward by rail
the Southern Pacific waited for boat
accommodation, which was restricted
on account of Government demands.
Although rates to the -receiver are the
same whether sent by rail or boat the
railroad company does not reap the
full benefit if compelled to forward by
rail. This explains the delay. The
road has not considered the conveni
ence of its constituents and we have
had to suffer." '
CATTLE AND SHEEP IN
SPLENDID CONDITION
Report of Stock Inspector Rehart on
Southeastern Oregon and
Northern California.
REDDING, Nov. 18.â Stock Inspector S.
V. Rehart, who has been busy during the
fall months inspecting cattle and sheep
in Southeastern Oregon, reports the herds
in splendid condition. Within the last
week, while in the Warner Valley sec
tion, he found one bunch of sheep af
fected with scabâ a band of bucks, which
he immediately took possession of to pre
vent the disease from spreading. What
stock is left on the ranges is In superb
condition, free from disease and rolling
fat
Delivery of three bands of the Sherlock
sheep was made this week at Amadee,
in Lassen County, the terminus of the
railroad running north from Reno. The
sheep numbered 10,000 head and were sold
at an average price of $2 50, Eastern
agents being the purchasers. The Chand
ler sheep, numbering 11,000 head, were
lately driven from the runs to Honey
Lake Valley, where they were sold to
Eastern account at an average price of
$2 50 all round.
But little attention is paid by sheepmen
to the license tax imposed by Modoc
County, as none of the more extensive
flockmasters have paid a cent on the tax
account. Had the license ordinance been
enforced on the Sherlock and Chandler
bands each flockmaster would have had
to pay $500 for simply driving through the
county to shipping points on the rail.
All the cattle that he could turn off
this year were sold by Peter Tonnlngsen
for delivery at South Omaha, The cattle

Editor Call: With regard to the
charter, I will stand on the Republican
platform and wh< n in Sacramento will
vote to give the reople what they want.
CHARLES F. KENEALLY,
Assemblyman, Twenty-ninth District.
Editor Call: Any man who votes
against the charter signs his political
death warrant. I stand with the plat- !
form, and I think all of my party do
the same.
SAMUEL BRAUNHART.
Senator, Seventeenth District.
Editor Call: Unquestionably and un
equivocally I am in favor of the con

pressed their ap royal by their votes.
If the new charter is not confirmed,
were put on the cars at Reno. Mr. Ton

$4 40 while the latter brought but $4 10

Eastern buyers came Into the Northern
California stock districts, California cat
tlemen are as familiar figures m Kansas

be in San Francisco. Many stockmen
went East this year with cattle sold to
the packing houses.
EIGHTEEN SHIPWRECKED
SAILORS REACH SHORE
Taken Prom the Sinking Bark Jo-
hanna by the British Steam
ship Peconic.
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â The British
steamer Peconic, which arrived at quar
antine to-day, brought into port eighteen
shipwrecked mariners who were taken
from the Dutch bark Johanna, which was
found in a sinking condition. The Peconic
sighted the Johanna flying signals of dis
tress on November 11, in latitude 36:24,
longitude rÂ»:03, and took off the men,
whom she landed here to-day.
The Johanna sailed from New York on
October 31 for Honolulu. On November 9
a terrific gale set in from the north-north
west, accompanied by enormou seas. The
midship bulwarks and main hatch were
smashed in and the deck beams broken,
and the vessel began to take in water at
an alarming rate. The ship was seen to
weave and buckle like a basket, and it
was feared that she would break in two
amidships.
Finally, on November 11, the wind and
sea went down and the men clambered on
board of the wreck and set distress sig
nals. At 11 p. m. the Peconic was seen
approaching, and lifeboats shortly after
ward came to their rescue. Captain
Maars, the mate and several of the men
were more or less bruised.
The Johanna was built at Albasserdam.
Holland, in 1890. was of 1164 tons and was
owned by J. Vroege. She was laden with
general merchandise and machinery.

THOUSANDS SQUANDERED BY THE McDONALDS TO
PLEDGE THEIR PARASITES A MERRY LIFE AT MADERA
Tomblin Warned the Pacific Bank=
ers Against the Schemes of
His Rivals.
Remarkable Letters That Show How the Funds of
the Defunct Banking Institutions Were
Dissipated.
There are very few incidents perhaps
In the secret history of the Pacific Bank
of more general interest than those re
lated in letters of D. M. Tomblin.
This man fought for control in the
John Brown colony from the moment
that the Pacific Bank managers took
complete control of the disastrous spec
ulation until long after the collapse of
the Pacific Bank and the People's
Home Savings Bank.
The Call resumes this morning the
publication of Tomblin"s letters and de
scribes in the words of Tomblin the
wretched condition of affairs that ex
isted at the colony. Tomblin not only
made enemies in his administration of
the Madera Bank but possessed several
before he took charge of the institu
tion. He understood thoroughly the
necessity of retaining the favor of Dick
McDonald In order that he might win
for himself a financial benefit. He un
derstood that several people more
closely connected with the McDonalds
were likely to checkmate him in his
schemes, and he lost no time in black
guarding his as: oclates in the Madera
schemes. While he indulged his spleen
to the extent of blackguardism at the
same time he gf.ve a minute and de
tailed account of affairs at the John
Brown colony. He described what he
believed to be the dishonest manipula
tion of his rival and presented to Dick
McDonald a condition of affairs that
would have appalled any one except
the egotistic, dishonest manager of the
Pacific Bank.
The letters of Tomblin constitute one '
of the most vitally important elements â 
of the history of the Pacific Bank.
These epistles show how and why hun- â 
dreds of thousands of dollars of the j
funds of the Pacific Bank were dissi- J
pated in the John Brown colony
rcheme.
fOMBLIN SOUGHT THE FLESHPOTS OF
FRESNO LIFE.
In one of his letters Mr. Tomblin rep
resents a most shocking condition of
affairs. In making these disclosures
Mr. Tomblin applied the lash of criti
cism to his own back, and not only ad
mitted that he had attended a cock
fight but had so far forgotten his dig
nity as cashier of the bank of Madera
bp to be present at and take considera
ble interest in a prize fight. Mr. Tomb
lin begged his master not to believe,
however, that he was seeking the flesh :
pots of Fresno life, but that he lent his
presence to these disgraceful scenes
that he might more closely study the
habits and the character of the men of
whom subsequently his master might
wish to know.
This letter of Tomblin's for a mo- |
fnent throws aside the curtain thtit hid j
\he conduct of affairs of the John
Brown colony. In this connection it
should also be remembered that Mr.
Tomblin had objected to the proposi
tion that the Pacific Bank should sup
j.ort young Mr. Johns' horses and his
bull pup. In this letter also Tomblin
brings jnto the recital the names of
two very prominent attorneys of this
city â John Flournoy and Seth Mann,
chairman of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee. In the enthusiasm of
the moment Mr. Tomblin grew meta
phorical and represented Return Rob
erts, president of the Madera Bank, as
a pig with his nose in the milk pail,
with Flournoy at one ear and Mann at
the other, and another very Interesting
individual dragging the tail. The let
ter is as follows:
MADERA, Dec. 10, 1892.
R. H. McDonald Jr.. V. P., San
Franciscoâ My Dear Sir: I have your
â¢ favor of the Bth and will say that 1
was not present at the prize fight in
which Johns had a hand. I was at
a cock fight at which place I met Mr.
Davis. After the cock fight was over
they all went through to Los Angeles.
I have also attended a prize fight, not
because I am an admlfer of such en
tertainments but because I wished to
see the class of people who attended
such places and just how they took
part in such performances. I can form
pretty good ideas of people at such"
times and gain knowledge that is valu
able in a business way. And so far as
anything 1 have done in the past or
might do in the future It is an open
book which I shall always freely give
you. It is politic that I should be
come acquainted with all the traits of
a man's character to impart to you j
as the occasion requires.
I recognize in Mr. Mann a bright and.
rising attorney, but I wanted him to
have counsel, as sometimes two heads
are better than one. And I want
them to keep Roberts' head right in
the milk-pail with Mann and Flour
noy hold of each ear and Carter to .,
twist his tail so that he will be sure
to get' such a dose of medicine that he
will be careful who he tackles next
. time. I sent to the colony for young
Johns to come in, but he was not to
be found and I have not seen him up
to the present time. I have no feel
ing whatever against the young man.
Under proper Influence I think he
would be all right, but with Boust to
advise with he cannot go anywhere
near right. I should not find â  any
fault with any one when 1 believed
they were working conscientiously, for
your best interests, but whan I know
they are not I am constrained to keep
. after them until they do. Am I right?
I am, yours very truly.

MR ' TOMBLIN PREPARED TO WADE
THROUGH BLOOD FOR HIS MASTER.
In his next letter Mr. Tomblin de
clared solemnly that he was ready to
wade through blood for Dick. Mr.
Tomblin neglected to say whose blood.
He declared that young' Johns had
plotted a gigantic scheme to rob the
colony and swindle Dick McDonald by
placing Fowler in the position of man
ager. Fowler, .it will be remembered.
was the young, gentleman whom Tomb-
Un had characterized as a dry goods
clerk, a song-and-dance : man and a
horse jockey ?of . some - experience. The
situation had almost driven Mr. Tomb
lin frantic. His letter is as follows:
MADERA, Cai., Dec. 12, 1892. [ â . ': ,.
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P., Ban Fran- '
â aUco-M X Â«Â«*r Sin I fcayÂ« Just &&a, ,
an Interview with Mr. Johns, in which
he informed me that he had let the
contract to Mr. Fowler. For several
days I have tried to get an interview
with him and try and stop him in his
reckless course, but It has been of no
avail. He has kept hidden. I look up
on this transaction as a gross outrage
to you, and unless you put a veto upon
it you will be involved in endless trou
ble. Personally I care nothing, but
when I know that there is a gigantic
job being put up to swindle you 1 feel
frantic and almost beside myself.
There is not another man on earth
besides you that I would wade through
blood to protect: for you I will do it.
I dÂ« not know wha-t power you have
dedicated to young Johns, but what
ever that is it will not be dedicated to
your honor or profit, and with Fowler
us manager wÂ« will be subjected to
gross irregularities and frauds without
number. I have the very best of rea
sons for making: this statement and
sincerely hope what the young man
has done can be declared off if it meets
with your approval. I shall not sulk,
but will be found at ynur side to bat
tle for you. If it must go the way that
Johns has planned I wish that you
would instruct him and Mr. Fowler
that they cannot purchase trees or go
into anything that involves the ex
penditure of money without the ap
proval of myself or Mr. Newman. I
do not wish to see you swindled if I
can help it. I am, yours truly,
D. M. TOMBLIN.
THE ROW IN THE JOHN BROWN COL
ONY COMES TO A SERIOUS CLIMAX.
On December 13 Tomblin ajrain made
Johns the subject of his tale of woe and
wrote as follows:
"I hope young Johns will under no
condition enter into any agreements
without having same ratified by you
and have the same a matter of record
in the office of the secretary. The cor
poration should always be advised of
just what is going on. Since he came
we have always been in the dark."
In his next letter D. M. Tomblin
paved the way to make himself presi
dent of the Madera Bank. He also
showed the result of his attack on
young Johns. It was always a habit
of Dick McDonald to expose the confi
dences of his advisors, and every stric
ture upon young Johns made by Tomb
lin was repeated by McDonald to
Johns. This necessarily led to a clash.
Johns threatened that he would do
Tomblin up and Tomblin declared with
ominous meaning that he would be pre
pared to meet the young man. This
condition of affairs naturally led to the
wildest confusion in the colony and in
the bank. Tomblin's letter is as fol
lows:
MADERA, Cal., January 9, 1803.
R. H. McDonald Jr.. V. P.. San
Francisco â My Dear Sir: Mr. Johns,
came down with me last night and
went out to the colony this morning
and there met the different factions.
I don't know just how he came out of
the deal, but he swears some one has
been lying about his boy awfully. I
told him that might be but I had not.
It makes an awful complication, as a
father will naturally stand by his own
son. The boy is wild at me. He was
in the bank on Saturday and left word
that he was going to do me up. but I
saw hint to-day and apoke to him and '
smiled. He returned the salute and
did not look very vicious, so I think
he will hot disturb me very much.
ShoU.d he do so I shall try and be
prepared to meet him. I don't like
this state of affairs, but hope every
thing will right itself soon. We have
our annual meeting to-morrow for the
election of officers. In view of the
facts I see no other course but to take
the presidency of the bank. That will
be the Fame as if you were managing
same, as I shall work for and with you
in all matters. I am very truly,'
D. M. TOMBLIN. â 
TOMBLIN ACCUSES YOUNG JOHNS OF A
" MOST SERIOUS OFFENSE. .
On March 15, 1893, D. M. Tomblin ac
cepted Dick McDonald's commission to
go out to the John Brown colony and
investigate its affairs. Tomblin de
clared that it would be extremely dif
ficult to detect any irregularities, but
he would do his best. He accused
young Johns for having once attempted
a dishonest transaction. Excerpts from
the letter are as follows:
MADERA. Cai., March 15, 1893.
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P., San
Franciscoâ My Dear Sir: I am going
out to the colony again in the morning
and will go over things very carefully
and will be prepared to report every
thing to youâ answering all your
Questions concerning the same. You
... know of course that colony matters '
are practically out of our hands now
and it is no easy matter to detect
irregularity. Still, about all work is
done by contract, and we have been
â¢ informed of the contract price, so that
the only show to be beaten is through
poor work, which I can watch. Any
arrangement Johns might have made
â¢ with contractors for a division . with
them, that would be impossible for us
to know anything about only by acci
dent. The young man I know once
attempted to do the same, but was
thwarted in his design. The price Is
$9 per acre less than the price he first
let it, and there Is not much of an op
portunity to get much from them on
that price unless they slight their
work, and that will not be permitted..
In regard to Boust I do not think he
eot away with any money. Tours very -
truly, D. M. TOMBLIN.
TOMBLIN VICIOUSLY ATTACKED A. F.
JOHNS BEFORE DICK McDONALD.
On April 4 Tomblin concerned him
self with a discussion of the expenses
of the Madera Fruit and Land Com
pany, the successor of the John Brown
colony. Tomblin suggested that young
Johns and his salary of $100 a month
be cut off. The writer also declares
that considerable unnecessary expense
was incurred in the employment of an
attendant who had nothing to do but
rub down and care for the fast horses
of young Johns and his bull pup.
' .On April 12, 1893, Tomblin writes to
Dick that he is on the point of exposing
great rascality in the affairs of the
John Brown colony, the Madera Fruit
and Land : Company ,- and the California
Raisin and : Fruit Growers' Associa
tion, in every one of which A. F. Johns
was deeply interested. Tomblin said
he was not ready to prove his charges,
but . he declared that ?he :â¢ believed he
would soon be able to demonstrate that
A. F. â¢ Johns had taken $3600 that did
not belong to him: Excerpts from this
important letter are as follows:^ -

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1898.
TOMBLIN SCENTS A GIGANTIC PLOT.
While the cashier of the Madera Bank found time to attend cock-fights and prize-fights, he lost no opportunity to attack
those whom he believed were undermining hhn in the confidence of .the McDonalds. In order that he might retain
that confidence he wrote the alarmist letter that is given in fac-simile above.
ing the lines a little closer each day
and think there will be developments
very soon that will implicate some
one in treachery, the like of which the
devil would blush to be caught in
anything so mean and contemptible.
Although I am not prepared to prove
what I now allege I believe A. F.
Johns has maliciously stolen the sum
of $3600 for peach trees sold to the
California Raisin Company, which
were grown in the John Brown colony
land and either belong to the property
sold or to you. But as I am mot ready
to prove this I will say no more about
it at this time, but you shall hear
more about it a little later on. I am,

FRANK V. McDONALD WAS RESPONSI
BLE FOR THE RIVERSIDE SPECU
LATIONS.
On May 8, 1893, D. M. Tomblin
wrote an unusually important letter, in
which he declares that O. T. Dyer,
manager of the Riverside Bank, blamed
Frank McDonald for having led him
into various wildcat schemes. For this
Dyer blamed Frank â¢ for the desperate
condition of the Riverside Bank.
Tomblin also made another attack. in
this letter upon young Johns. The let
ter is as follows: â 
MADERA, Cal., May 3, 1893. ,
R. H. McDonald Jr., V. P.. San
Franciscoâ My Dear Sir: Mr. Hay In
formed me that young Johns was in
the hotel on Sunday evening and in a
very loud manner poured forth his
maledictions upon your and my de
fenseless heads; also upon the Pacific
Bank and the banK of Madera, and all
people connected with cÂ»iem. Mr.
Hay said he was very vicious and ex
cited. He said you would not Bee him
when he called last week, and -there
were many serious charges which he
brought; against us. It is not very
pleasant to have such r>Â«nnie associ
ated in any way with us, and I hope
it will not be very long before that
gang is cleaned out forever from â 
among us, for they, are an element of V
discord and a root of bitterness. They .-:â â¢
care for nothing But their own vicious
ness and how they can best meet that .
end. Dyer said - during his conversa
tion with me that he would not. have
been in any of his wildcat deals had it :
not been for your brother. I thought
' the remark rather; unkind, when I
knew the sacrifice that had been made
to keep that ban- afloat. I only hope
that institution . can be brought out ,
and you made safe. ; I am yours very
truly. .D. - TOMBLIN. : :
TOMBLIN/S BITTER DISCUSSION OF THE
RESIGNATION ;OF A. F. JOHNS.
On" May 8 Tomblin took another fling
at A. F. Johns and his son. The elder
Johns and Dick I McDonald .were* then
bitterly quarreling over , the develop
ments of the attempt to sell the John
Brown colony. Dick >. McDonald ; dis
trusted: Johns and Johns < knew the Pa
cific . B^Rk, ;;waÃ ; \MQIYPUU 4 fftw, days,
later, therefore, he resigned as an em
ploye of the bank. Before that resig
nation was made Dick McDonald
warned Tombyn against Johns, and
Tomblin made the following reply:
"I shall follow your instructions re
garding Mr. Johns. I have never liked
the man from my first week's associa
tion with him. I have always looked
upon him as an unscrupulous person,
who would sell out his friends and de
liver them over to the Philistines.
Young Johns has left here and I pre
sume has gone to the city."
YOUNG JOHNS AND PROFESSOR "YOUNG
DUTCHY" TRY CONCLUSIONS.
Tomblin seemed never to tire In his
attacks upon the Johns â father and
son. On May 15 he wrote Dick that
young Johns and "Young Dutchy" had
given a fistic exhibition at the colony.
He commiserated with Dick over the
alleged treachery of the elder Johns
and at the same time took occasion to
assure the deluded banker that he
could rely In fair and foul weather
upon the absolute obedience and fidel
ity of D. M. Tomblin. Excerpts from
the letter follow:
"They had a great blow-out at the
colony yesterday (Sunday) and there
were about 400 people there. I under
stood they had sparring exhibitions by
Johns and Professor "Young Dutchy"
and many other sports. A. F. Johns,
wife and mother-in-law came down
Saturday night. I saw Johns a moment
last night. It was a frigid meeting and
I doubt if he comes into tl bank at all.
I hope not. I hope he will not give you
much trouble. I think you have enough
already, but if you should ever need a
friend you will find such in me at all
times and places through evil as well
as good report. Make known your de
sires and I shall take pleasure in exe
cuting same. We have had a hard fight
and I never could believe that one in
whom you have placed so much confi
dence as Johns would so maliciously
betray it."
TOMBLIN AGAIN WARNS DICK OF THE
ALLEGED TRICKERY OF A. F.
JOHNS.
Johns had evidently become a hid
eous specter to Tomblin, for > a few
days later : he again wrote- announcing
his belief that Johns was up to some
devilment and intended. If possible, to
get . away with ; $50,000 . in property be
longing to ' the bank. - This ;is the last
letter written by |D. M. Tomblin before
the failure of the â¢. Pacific Bank. Ex
cerpts from it are as follows: .;-.;, â  â â ;-â¢: Â«'*,
MADERA, Cai., May 23, 1893.

,â  and. I ajn raid, be je up to some, dÂ©v- ,
ilment and will dispose of property
that is not involved and which will
bring at least fifty thousand dollars.
This is entirely in his hands, and I am
afraid to trust him a day with it, and
unless we are secured at once I think
attachment should be begun immedi
ately. I am afraid it is dangerous to
delay and believed it advisable to have
Mr. Mann come down immediately and
attend to it. The foreclosure proceed
ings against the colony for $120,000
hÃve been begun, and I don't know
whether Johns is behind the deal or
not. I am yours very truly.

To-morrow morning The Call will
continue the expose of the vicloua
financiering: that ended in the ruin of
the Pacific Bank and the People's
Home Savings Bank. After the Mc-
Donalds had Involved themselves in
the series of disastrous speculations
they sought to recover their lost
ground by employing the service of
scores of parasites. The Call will show
to what extent these parasites went in
their efforts to lead the McDonalds
into more disastrous schemes. The dis
honest and deluded bankers went more
deeply into the financial pool and
squandered thousands upon thousands
of dollars in an effort to recover what
had already been lost.

TOO MUCH COOLIE
LABOR HERE NOW
WORKINGMEN OPPOSED TO
PHILIPPxNE ANNEXATION.
Labor Council Takes Action on This
and Other Matters of
Importance.
The San Francisco L<abor Council, voic
ing the sentiments of the laboring classes
of the Pacific Coast, put itself on record
last night ac opposed to any movement
looking toward the annexation of the
Philippine Islands, as it dreads the al
moat Inevitable influx of cheap laborers
of an undesirable class.
The matter was brought up by Andrew
Furusoth of the Coast Seamen's Union.
In speaking: on the subject Mr. Furuseth
said: "Some years ago this coast was.
rid of most of the Chinese immigration by
the passage of the exclusion act, and we â 
hoped then that we were rid of Asiatic <
labor for all time. Now comes the move- ]
ment to annex the Philippines with their |
nine million native inhabitants, who are I
as bad if not worse than the Chinese and
Japanese. ' ' I
'Tt is all very well for the advocates of â 
the scheme to say that CongTess will pass !
laws covering this point, but we know :
that Congress will do nothing of the sort.
If the islands are annexed or any soy- i
erertgnty assumed 1 over them the inhabit- j
ants will be under our flag and CongTess
can do nothing to prevent their migration, j
If any such legislation were attempted j
the matter would simply go to the United j
States courts and the United States courts
would deolare the law unconstitutional, j
The worklngman has been deceived by j
such promises often enough, and it is high
time for him to open his eyes and take i
the stitch in time.
The executive committee will pass suit
able resolutions, which will be forwarded j
to the American Federation of Labor.
Other business of the Council consisted
of the launching of a project to increase
its membership by bringing in unions of i
the building trades. At present these j
unions are represented in the Building
Trades Council. Many efforts have been
made to amalgamate . the two central
bodies, but all have failed, as they would
mean the disruption of the Building |
Trades Council. The plan now is to make J
a determined effort to bring them all into
the Ivabor Council without interfering
with their old affiliations with the Build
ing Trades Council. A committee consist
ing of Messrs. Rosenberg, White and Me- !
Auliffe was appointed to visit the unions
and talk the matter over.
CBICKETERS WIN PRIZES.
Batting and Bowling Averages in
Association Hatches During the
Season.
A meeting: of the California Cricket !
Association was held yesterday In the j
office of the secretary, at which were \
present: Edward Brown (president). Cap- j
tain J. Metealfe, R. B. Hoffue and G.
Theobald. The batting and bowling av
erages for the season of 1898 in matches
sanctioned by the association were pre- j
sented and approved. In order to be eli
gible for' the Burnell prizes for the best
batting and bowling averages obtained j
during the season by members of clubs of j
the association it was necessary that a \
city player should have taken part in at ,
least eight innings; a country player in at |
least five innings. J. Myers of the Pacific i
Club, whose name stands at the head of
the batting averages, did not play in the
required number of innings, nor did A.
Pickenson, also of the Pacifies, whose
name stands third. The first hatting prize
(a handsome cricket bat made by Grad
idge and selected by Leslie Wilson, now
and for many years a member of the Kent
Co inty eleven) was awarded to J. J. I
Moriarty of the Alameda Club. The sec
ond batting prize (a pair of batting I
glov.fO was won by R. B. Hogue, captain ;
of the Alameda eleven. R. B. Hogue- 1
made thirteen runs more during the sea- [
son than J. J. Moriarty, but as he played !
one more innings and never enrried his* j
bat his average fell a little short. The !
priz* for best bowling average (a pair of
pads) was awarded to C. Simmonds of
the Placer County Citrus Colony team, j
The batting and bowling averages, as of- j
â¡cia&y accepted by the association, are

MRS. WILLIAMS' TESTIMONY.
Tells of Her Belations With Captain
Nevills, Her Prosecutor.
The case of Elsie Williams, Grace LooÂ«Â«
and Myron Ahzderlan closed yesterday at
noon. William E. Nevills Jr. was cross
examined during the morning session. His
story given the day before as to how he
had gained the confidence of the con
spirators and drew from them their plans
to extort money from Captain Nevills was
not shaken. Ahzderian's confession that
he had conspired to "dispose of Nevills
and claim his property under forged con
veyances, as told by young Nevills was
the strongest bit of evidence introduced
and even if the women punish
ment Ahzderian's conviction is almost as
8U The' defense, at the conclusion of young
Nevills' testimony, opened its case and
Mrs. Williams was called to the stand.
I She told a sympathetic story of the wrong
i done her by Captain Nevills and on mora
\ than one occasion gave way to tears. In
brief her story is that she was a hard
working woman when she met Nevills.
"He often told me," said the witness
"that his wife was no good. He showed
me a letter written by Mrs. Nevills to

Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â In the war
inquiry to-day, taking up the question
of the lack of tents, surgeons and medi
cal supplies in Cuba, Dr. Connor asked
the witness, Dr. Greenleaf, how the
medical supplies were delayed at Sibo
ney. Dr. Greenleaf said he did not
know.
"Who finally unloaded these sup
plies?" asked Dr.' Connor.
"I did. I captured six pontoons and
took the law into my own hands."
v unloaded in thirty-six hours
supplies that had been lying in the
harbor two weeks? Why did not Dr.
Pope, chief surgeon of General Shaf
ter's corps, land them within those two
weeks?"
"I suppose he was at the front at
tending to the wounded," replied Dr.
Greenleaf. "1 am sure that Dr. Pc-pc
did the best he could. I had full au
thority from General Miles to do what
I thought best." j
In reply to a question Dr. Greenleaf
said he supposed Dr. Pope had author
ity from General Shafter sufficient to j
enable him to unload the supplies at J
Ssiboney as he (.Greenleaf) had done.
"There is no doubt," said Dr. Con
ner, "that somebody was dreadfully at
fault. Cannot you help us to find out
who it was?"
Dr. Greenleaf said he could not.
William Hamilton Henry, whose son
served as a private in Company B, ,
Seventy-first Regiment, during the j
campaign, was the first witness at the
afternoon session. Mr. Henry told o-l
a visit to Camp Wikoff in search of I
his son, who was sick. He found him j
lying on the bare ground in a tent. The .
Juicers 1 tents were all noored.
Kichard W. Henry, the son, wasÂ»-f
called. He was taken sick after the
surrender of Santiago. Speaking of the
treatment he received from the army
surgeons in Cuba he said that they did
the best that they could and treated
every one alike.
"In fact," he said, "they made no'dis
tinction in the manner of treatment or
in medicine. It was two pills for a
fever and three pills for a broken arm."
Dr. Frank Donaldson, who joined
Colonel Koosevelt's regiment In Cuba
on July S, and who was stricken with
yellow fever on July 24, followed Mr.
Henry on the witness stand. Asked
by Dr. Connor as to the condition of the
h.spitala he replied:
"I do not wish to criticize Dr. Le
Garde, whom 1 /reatly admire, but
they were entirely swamped. There was i
an insufficiency of medic nes, nurses
and stewards. The majority of the
stewards were of a most undesirable
character, and should never have been
selected for such service."
Regarding medical supplies. Dr. Don
aldson said there w.-re supplies, hut
they could not be reached. Speaking of
his own regiment he said he erot sup
plies because he went out and hustled
for them.
"They were not served out to you?
asked Dr. Connor.
"Not by a large majority," was the
reply. "We got what we hustled for
and nothing else."
"Did the men receive good care and
attention in the hospitals?'
"They suffered from the lack of care
because of the inefficiency of the
nurses. The doctors were efficient and
devot<
Dr. Connor asked if it was possible
to pel a better class of nurses, and
when Dr. Donaldson said no, he asked
why the kpartment should be blamed
for what could not be avoided.
"There was no excuse," said Dr. Don
alils":!. "for sending them there and
not sending supplies."
"Do you know they sent no sup
plies?"
"If they s^-nt them they must have
vanished into Cuba Libre; they did not
reach us.
Dr. Donaldson criticized Dr. Lesser,
the head of the Red Cross Hospital in
Cuba, severely, and declared that al
though I>r. Josser posed as an expert
or yellow fever, he did not know what
yellow fever was until he was stricken
with it.
James S. Sowers of Company X,
Seventy-first Regiment, served from
the time the regiment went to Camp
Black until mustered out last week. He
complained that the coffee was poor
and that the volunteers were not
treated as well as the regulars. Asked
by General Beaver to explain what he
meant he said the volunteer officers
took care of themselves while the regu
lar officers took .are of their men.
"When we arrived at Montauk
Point," he said, "there was nothing for
us to eat until the next day. When the
Tenth Regulars arrived there was a
wagon load of bread and meat waiting
for them. Our officers said that they
had nothing to do with the rations."
Mrs. Mary Manson of West Fifty
fifth street was the last witness of the
day. She had been at Camp Wikoff in
charge of a division of the Women's
War Relief Association. She said the
men at Camp Wikoff had suffered
greatly and had been ill-treated. When
General Dodge told her that the men
had testified they were not badly treat
ed and had not been neglected at
camp Wikoff Mrs. Manson declared
that if they so testified they had said
what was not true.
Shortly before 5 o'clock the hearing
was adjourned until to-morrow at 10
a. m.

convention, and guards, tackles, half
backs, ends and centers are coming
back to the scene of former triumphs
and college associations.
Out in the rain stand groups of specu
lators anathematizing the Tale man
agement. By careful scheming the
speculators have had a hard row to
hoe, and to-night they are trying to
dispose of their tickets at face value
without a cent bonus. This is due to
the fact that th<* management has still
a number of tickets which it is selling
to any person known not to be a specu
lator. Of the 15, 200 reserved seats at
the field. 18.100 had been sold to-night,
and of this number it is believed that
not over 200 are held by speculators.
The Tale field gridiron to-night is as
smooth as a billiard table and in per
fect condition. Before the rain began
to fall thirty-six big bales of straw
were laid over the gridiron. Crushed
stone, too, was laid in all the paths
leading to the entrance.
It has in nine years past been the
custom of the team to be taken away
either to a hotel or to the infirmary,
as was done last year, on the eve of
battle, in order that the meji may be
kept quiet and undisturbed Wy noise or
worry. To-night, however, they will
remain In their rooms.
There is very little betting thus
far. and Harvard money is going beg,
ging. Two thousand dollars were of
fered at the New Haven House this
evening, with the odds 10 to 8 on Har
vard, but only a small portion of the
money was taken.
At the other rendezvous about the
city the same conditions exist as re
gards little betting, but In every case
the Tale men insist on odds.
HARVARD AND YALE
ON THE EVE OF BATTLE
MERIDEN, Conn., Nov. 18.â By 10
| o'clock to-night the Harvard football
| players were bundled off to bed to
; dream of to-morrow's great contest.
; They are all fit and eager for the fray.
I They are not boastful or over-confident,
I but still they all expect to win. The
! Harvard players were up betimes this
: morning. Led by Captain" Dibblee and
j Dean, the entire squad took a brisk
I walk in the morning for three-quarters
lof an hour and lunched at noon. At 3
j o'clock the men put on their football
j togs and went out to Hanover Field for
! light practice. The practice lasted a
1 short hour, finishing with both first and
! second elevens rehearsing the signals.
There will be no change in Harvard's
1 line-up from that which was played in
i the Princeton game, though Farley and
Lawrence are expected to replace Coch
! rane and Warren, respectively, before
i the game has progressed far. The
i whole squad will leave here to-morrow
i at 10:30.
NEW HAVEN, Nov. 19.â The prac

I and consisted of signal work only. Ely,

j the goal posts and Cutten snapped the
: ball back to McÃride, who has returned
I from New York, where he had been for
! a day being treated by a specialist for
: a bothersome weak ankle. The work
was very satisfactory to Thome, who

i coachers said this evening that the
, coachers were well pleased with the im
provement of the players this week.
DEATH FROM ALCOHOLISM.
Verdict in the Case of J. A. Brand-

a s;if'e. The check for $1500 which Bran
dreth was reported to have had has not
'â  materialized either. He had told a num

Coroner Long investigated . the matter
thorouKhlv. and when testimony on this

BOG BUTTER.
Mr David Boyle. the curator of the
Ontario Archaeological Museum, is In re
ceipt of an exceedingly curious survival
from prehistoric times in the shape of a
good sized lump of "bog butter. In
Ireland in the very old times the art of
butter making was known, but the pre
servative effects of salt were as yet un
discovered. Nevertheless, the people of
that age possessed some means of pre
serving it, burial in a bog being part of
the process. Firkins of it were fre
quently left there for safekeeping, ana
from time to time these relics of prehis
toric housekeeping are unearthed. Mr.
B. St. George Lefroy of Toronto, Who is
now in Ireland, is the donor of a good
sized piece of cheesy looking stuff to the
museum. Mr. Lefroy's letter to ...Mr.
Boyle is in part as follows:
"I have just sent off per parcels post
a piece of 'bog, butter' to you. I don't
know whether it is a thing of sufficient
antiquity and rarity to tie of any value
or interest to you. but as the Dublin Mu
seum has a keg in a prominent position
perhaps you may consider it worthy of
admission to & place in the museum. I
notice the Canadian customs forbid 'sub
stitutes or imitations of butter.' I hope
red tape won't signalize itself over this.
"The keg of which this is a portion wak
dug up recently (this year) in a bog near
Dunlavin County, Kildare. The staves
arc said to have been round it, but to
have fallen off on removal. It lay in a
peasant's garden, and the dogs fed on it
for a time. Mrs. Hopkins of Blackhall
Castle,. Kilcullen, County Kildare. got It
then, and I got this fragment from her.
I melted a piece and it seems decidedly
butterish."â Toronto Globe.
RAGS STILL U&ED AS THANK OF
FERINGS IN IRELAND.
The singular custom of leaving rags
and other worthless objects at wells has
not entirely fallen Into disuse. The su
perstition. In a modified form, exists In
other portions of the world. A traveler
in Persia found a tree with rags tied to
its branches. They had been left there
by the inhabitants of a province infected
v.lth ague. A tree hung with rags was
found by another traveler in Africa.
Crooked pins, old clothes, pebbles, shells,
rusty nails, small coins and even bundles
of heath were considered appropriate
thank offerings at shrinen In earlier days,
for it was believed that the saints and
apostles did not care for articles of value.
Such was the superstitious adoration of
fountains that It was forbidden by the
sixteenth of the canons issued in 960, in
thf reign of King Edgar, and it was con
demned by the canons of St. Anselm. It
was also Interdicted by the laws passed
in the reign of King Canute. Since the
reformation the practice has not been
prevalent except in Ireland, where many
old wells consecrated to saints and mar
tyrs are yet made the object of pilgrim
age. There is scarcely a parish through
out the land that has not Its own holy
well, where, despite practical admonition,
the faithful and the faithless come to
pray for physical or mental relief, an<l
leave behind them a scrap of rag as an
offering.â London Daily Mall.
SQUIRE ANDERSON AND THE
SCORCHER.
Squire Anderson has no particular love
for the scorching bicyclist. The squire Is
a largo, heavy man. and Is not able to
dodge the rapid wheelmen as Bpryly as
he could have done twenty years ago. Sev
eral times he has been struck by bicycle
riders, but sustained no Injury further
than the soiling of his clothes. He made
up his mind that the next time the other
fellow would get the worst of it. His op
portunity came one day while he- was go
ing to his office. A dapper youth was
making his way at tremendous speed
along Perm avenue Just as Squire Ander
son was half way across the street. A
sudden inspiration seized the squire. He
stopped, turned his back toward the cy
cler and planted his feet solidly on the
stone crossing. The bicycle struck him
fairly amidship. The rider vaulted into
the air. shot ahead about ten feet and
then dropped to the graund. The bicycle
was a wreck. The squire then proceeded
leisurely to the court of Justice on Eighth
street.â PI tsHburg Chronicle-Telegraph.

HAWAIIAN TRADE
FOR LAST YEAR
Commerce of America's
New Possession.
EXPORTS EXCEED IMPORTS
OUTPUT OF SUGAR GROWING
LARGER.
United States Contributes Over Sev
enty-Five Per Cent of the
Shipments to the
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The State
Department has published a report of
the British Foreign Office in regard to
the commerce of Hawaii in 1897, from
which it appears that of the total imports
of the islands, the United States con
tributed 76.8 per cent; Great Britain^
Canada and the colonies together 11.85
per cent, the balance being distributed
about equally between Germany,
China, Japan and other countries. Of
the exports 99.62 per cent went to the
United States, sugar representing 96
per cent of the total. Apart from
sugar, the chief articles for export were
rice, hides, skins, wool, coffee and
fruits The value of the imports into
Hawaii in 1897 was $8,871,041. an in
crease of $1,679,878 over 1896, and the
value of the exports was $16,081,305. a
gain of $508,428.
The increase in imports was especi
ally marked in the case of provisions,
wearing apparel, hardware, agricul
tural implements and machinery. The
increase in exports was due, mainly,
to an increased output of sugar, all of
which went to the United States.
The report assigns as the reason why
the United States has such a large pro
portion of the trade (apart from the
difference in tariff) the adaptability for
American goods for the Hawaiian mar
ket the reduced rates of transportation
and consequently cheaper prices, the
excellent packing of cotton, etc.
It also appears from the report that
in cotton goods the United States has
already a large proportion of the trade
and a monopoly of boots and shoes, felt
hats and the better class of straw hats.
The sugar Industry of the islands,
says the report, prospered in 1897, all
the plantations paying dividends. In
telligent systems of cultivation are In
vogue An association of sugar plant
ers has been formed, and it has es
tablished a laboratory and exnerimen
tal station, from which much benefit
has been derived. The cultivation of
coffee Is extending, but up to the pres
ent time no large estates have been
opened, the area planted being made ud
of a number of small holdings. In ad
dition there is n fair area of what is
known as wild coffee-that is. coffee
which has not been scientifically
planted or subjected to the more ap
proved methods of pruning, etc.. but
which has been allowed to grow almost
entirely wild. The export of coffee in
1897 was 337.158 pounds, or nearly
double that of 1896.

His Reputation Was Damaged.
E.T.Nichols filed suit yesterday against
William P. Detert of Jackson, Amador
County, to recover $10,000 damages for
defamation of character. Nichols alleges
that Detert made affidavit that he (Nich
ols) had agreed, as an agent of a local
insurance company, to secure him a pol
icy of $50,000 at reduced rates, contrary to
the rules of a compact between insurance
companies. In consequence Nichols lost
his position and he now seeks to recover
for the damage to both his reputation and
purse.
Damage Wanted for a Leg.
The suit of John "W. Hall against the

Stone in Her Stomach.
From the Gazette, Blan.i:nsvlU<?, 111.
The wife of the Rev. A. R. Adams,
pastor of the Bedford Christian Church
at Blandinsville, 111., was for years com-
pelled to live a life of torture from dis-
ease. Her case baffled the physicians, but
to-day she is alive and well, and tells the
story of her recovery as follows:
"About six years ago," said Mrs.
Adams, "I weighed about 140 pounds, but
my health began to fall and I lost flesh.
My food did not agn?e with me and felt
like a stone in my stomach. I began to
bloat all over until I thought I had
dropsy.
"I had pains and soreness in my left
side which extended clear across my back
and also into the region of my heart.
During these spells a hard ridge would
appear in the left side of my stomach and
around the left side.
"These attacks left me sore and ex-
hausted. All last summer I was so nerv-
ous that the children laughing and play-
ing nearly drove me wild. I suffered also
from female troubles and doctored with
tea different physicians without receiv-
ing any help.

I am now taking the eleventh box and

"I was also troubled with nervous pros-
tration and numbness of my right arm
and hand so that at times I could hardly
endure the pain, but that has all passed
away. I now have a good appetite and
am able to do my own work. Have done
more this summer than, in the past four
years put together. Dr. Williams' Pink

it my duty to let other sufferers know It."

Her general health, her future happiness,
her good looks, her physical strength, her

Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription is the
best of all medicines for women who are.
ailing in this way. It makes a woman
strong and healthy where a woman most
needs health and strength. It relieves
pain, soothes inflammation, heals ulcera-
tion and gives rest and tone to the tortured
nerves. It cures all the ills and pains too
commonly considered an uncomfortable in-
heritance of womankind. It has been used
for over thirty years with an unbroken
record of success. More of it has been sold
than of all the other medicines for women
combined. It is the discovery of Dr. R. V.
Pierce, for thirty y*ars chief consulting
physician to the Invalids' Hotel and Sur-
gical Instittst*^* Buffalo, N. Y. He will
cheerfully answer, without charge, all let-
ters from ailing women.
"Three years ago." writes Mrs. J. N. Messier,
of 1794 Vanilerbilt Avenue. New York. X. V., "the
best physicians in this city said there was no,
cure forme â unless I would go to a hospital and ;
have an operation performed? I could not walk
across the room. I took Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription and after three bottles I could
work, walk and ride."
Torpid liver and constipation are surely
and speedily cured by Dr. Pierces Pleasant
Pellets. They never gripe. They regulate,
tone up and invigorate the liver, stomacli

ThJE NEW CHARTER.
THE CALL this morning publishes answers from
members and members-elect to the Legislature
tp the direct question of their standing on ap
proval of the new charter for San Francisco. A ma
jority of the replies are absolutely in favor of the
ratification of that charter. Of the remainder of
the total membership the majority simply indicate
inattention to the subject and no opposition to the
charter. The Call opposed the adoption of the new
charter by the people and therein voiced the senti
ments of citizens who are as devoted to the public
good and as deserving of popular respect as any that
favored it.
Our opposition ceased at the tally-sheets which
proved the result of the balloting. The people sup
ported the charter and so does The Call. The in
strument is in no more danger of defeat at Sacra
mento than the State Capitol is of being converted
into a Chinese laundry. The Call makes the charter
fight its fight, if there is to be one. But there will
be none, and the suggestion of a persuasion fund and
a hired lobby to work for the charter at Sacramento
is simply indicative that somebody is out of a job.
WINEMAKERS STAND TOGETHER.
REPORTS of the business and the prospects of
the California Winemakers' Corporation sub
mitted at the annual meeting which closed on
Thursday were so gratifying and satisfactory to the
members that they re-elected the old board of di
rectors and will continue, for six months at any rate,
to carry on their efforts to improve the condition of
the industry.
The outcome of the meeting will be pleasing to the
State at large. It would have been felt as a serious
setback to one of our greatest industries if this as
sociation, organized for the benefits of producers, had
failed to retain the confidence of its members and had
been virtually abandoned. The wine grape growers
and winemakars of California have had a hard
struggle in the past, and it seems clear that unless
they can in some way co-operate the future will
hardly be much more profitable.
The chief difficulty that confronts the wine industry
of the State is the lack of a sufficient home market
ior the output of which the State is capable. The
American people have not yet reached that degree
of living which makes the use of wine and oil com
mon to all clashes except the very poor. While in
point of wealth our people are better able to con
sume table wines than those of any European coun
try, very few of them do. As a consequence the de
mand for wine is by no means as great as it will be
when the advantage of wine at dinner is better under
stood.
r To make the campaign of education for the intro
duction of wine using in this country by the general
mass of people, and to convince those who now use
it that California wine is better and purer than the
bulk of that which is imported, â will require a long
period of time and the expenditure of a good deal of
energy and money. It will be better certainly for
our winemakers to co-operate while this struggle for
the upbuilding of the home market is going on than
for them to attempt it separately.
The decision whether the corporation is to be con
tinued has been postponed for six months. It is to
be hoped before that time passes the benefits of co
operation will have been abundantly manifest. The
outlook, at any rate, seems to be promising. If some
means Cofild be found to put an end to the differences
between the^ winemakers and the wine dealers there
would be something like an assurance of profitable
business all round.
A Milpitas constable who deliberately killed an in
offensive young man, the victim being unarmed and
hardly more than a boy, has been found guilty of
manslaughter and recommended to the mercy of the
court. A question arises as to what sort of an act
down Milpitas way would be regarded as murder and
calculated to impress a jury as reprehensible.
A Parisian editor declares that a treaty of alliance
between the United States and Englfrnd has been
drafted, and then we all know the editor has had an
extra dose of absinthe.
Orders are said to have been issued to the Spanish
fleet to prepare for action. Possibly Spain desires
to get rid of the rest of her navy.
Official revelations that the Spaniards have been
stealing on a magnificent scale do not come in the
nature of a surprise.
Alger and General Corbin appear to be in need of
getting together.
DO WE WANT COLONIES?
THERE are many evidences of reasonable con
sideration of the situation ensuing upon the war
with Spain. The demand that Spain give up
the Philippines has been hastily taken as expressive
of our intention to hold them. This is not so at all.
Relinquishment of her sovereignty over those dis
tant islands, and committing it to us, is no evidence
of President McKinley's intention to hold them.
Nor do the late elections furnish any evidence of the
people's desire to retain them. In California the
Philippine question did not affect a single vote. Both
parties had declared for the policy of expansion, but
it was an ex parte declaration and the result was not
affected by it.
In New York the election of Roosevelt and of. a
Republican Legislature was brought about by causes
that had no relation to a craze for tropical colonies.
After his victory Colonel Roosevelt said: "I shall
try to administer the office of Governor in the inter
est of the whole people. It is by so doing that I can
best show my appreciation of the support given aie
by the independents and Democrats, who have them
selves put the welfare of the State first, declining to
follow those of their leaders who, in this crisis, either
ranged themselves outright on the side of the^ forces
of dishonesty, or else supported them in effect â¢â¢ by
standing aside from the real contest."
An analysis of the causes that led to the result in
other States will show a like situation.
Therefore the acquisition of tropical colonies is not
decided on by the people and is an open question, to
be yet settled after ample debate.
The abandonment to us of her sovereignty in the
Philippines by Spain does not mean our retention of
them. We can with perfect propriety secure a coal
ing station there and hand the sovereignty over to
the people, to whom it .rightfully belongs. We may
complete negotiations relating to the Philippine debt
and to all other matters, acting therein as the trus
tee of the people, and may even go so far as to guar
antee their performance of whatever we promise in
their name, but all this is very different from incum
bering ourselves with possessions that mean cost and
trouble. It is a subject for dispassionate considera
tion, and is not to be concluded by a pseudo patriot
ism that is expressed by yelling. All the pretended
fervor about "nailing the flag" is blue bosh and fus
tian. The American army officers and soldiers who
have sweltered and sickened on that rotten tropical
soil, under a vertical sun, are not enamored- of the
land or the people. A very large majority of the let
ters written home by soldiers oppose the holding of
a tropical country, where their experience proves that
white men cannot live and thrive.
Up to this time the people have had misinformation
in the shape of half the facts. The two thousand
sailors and marines in Dewey's fleet have been truth
full}- reported as enjoying good health. But they have
been on shipboard. They have drunk only distilled
water. They have slept in wholesome quarters.
Their rations have been under careful inspection.
They could not get ashore to yield to the temptations
which undermine a man's strength. Merchant sailors
in the tropics understand it perfectly. They kno.w
that as long as they stay on deck they are safe, and
that there is ever}- risk on shore.
The health reports from Dewey's fleet led' our peo
ple to conclude that the climate was as wholesome as
the Sierra foothills or the Catskill Mountains. The
experience of our troops on shore at Cavite and Man
ila has undeceived them. As a result there has arisen
the pitiful clamor to have the boys sent home, which
has been caused by their letters truthfully describing
the unchangeable physical conditions. In these reve
lations we also find the difference between the senti
ments of army and navy officers on the subject, jhe
navy officers live on their ships, equipped with w^ter
distilleries, artificial ice machines, ventilating electric
fans and other comforts and sanitary necessities,
which are not possible of Use in the army. The army
officer's judgment as to physical conditions is the
better, for he must endure them unmitigated by ar
tificial means. He meets, in other words, the un
changeable conditions to which our garrisons must
be subjected, and which forever forbid any attempt
tc domesticate men and families of our race, in com
merce, manufactures or agriculture, in those lands
and latitudes. As we cannot domesticate our race
there, we cannot plant our institutions, which are
racial purely, and cannot be adapted to a tropical
people by any process of education nor any training,
no matter how prolonged it may be.
THE MASSACHUSETTS SENATORS
/^* OMMENTING upon the demands of the im
l perialists for the annexation of the Philippines
and the adoption of a policy of unlimited
colonial expansion, Senator Hoar said in a recent
speech at Worcester: "In my opinion we are to-day
in. a great danger â a danger greater than any we have
encountered since the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth.
The danger is that we are to be transformed from a
republic founded on the Declaration of Independence
and guided by the counsels of Washington into a
vulgar commonplace empire founded upon physical
force."
Senator Hoar's colleague from Massachusetts,
Senator Lodge, sees another danger confronting vs â
a danger that our commerce in the East may be de
stroyed. In an address at the banquet of the Boston
Boot and Shoe Club on Thursday evening he said:
"We want no commerce at the cannon's mouth,
but we do want it understood that wherever, an
American is engaged in business there he is to be
protected, and that there is a navy of the United
States big enough to guard him wherever he sees fit
to go. Therefore, I say we need a large navy as a
protection to commerce on the sea as well as on the
land The question that confronts us is a larger one
than what we shall do with the- Philippines. They
say we are not an Eastern power unless we hold those
islands. We are to-day the greatest power in the
Pacific Ocean. We hold one entire side of that
ocean except the outlet which England has to China.
We hold the halfway house in Honolulu, where all
ships must stop when the Nicaragua canal is built,
as it will be. Are we going to allow the ports of the
East to be closed to us and open to Russia, France
and Germany alone? Or are we going to stand up
and say with England and Japan the ports of China
must be closed to all or they must be open to all?"
The addresses of the two Senators taken together
make a comprehensive statement of the issue that
confronts us in the Orient and the dangers that re
sult from it. On the one side there is the possibility
that a foolish jingoism may lead us to take a position
in the Philippines that will involve us in every con
flict in that section of the world, and on the other
there is a possibility that our commercial interests
may suffer from European aggression.
The two addresses are worth studying because so
many efforts have been made of late to convince the
public that the Massachusetts Senators disagree with
one another and that a factional split in the Repub
lican party is likely to take place over the Eastern
question. It will be seen from the statements quoted
that there is no necessary conflict between them.
Senator Hoar is not opposed to the expansion of
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SATUEDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1898.
our commerce by peaceful means, nor does Senator
Lodge believe that we must annex the Philippines in
order to expand it. There is a broad platform of
policy on which both can stand. Let us build up our
merchant marine and strengthen our navy and we can
then hold our own in the Orient and everywhere else
without taking upon oufselves the. burden of govern
ing the savage inhabitants of islands too pestilential
for white men to inhabit.
THREE boys are in San Quentin for an offense
so trivial as to have merited nothing more than
a reprimand. They have not committed any
crime, and yet officials induced the lads to plead
guilty to the charge of horse-stealing. The only pur
pose seems to have been to permit a Sheriff to acquire
a few paltry fees. To do this he was willing to have
the trio branded as felons. They have been degraded
to stripes;' the real disgrace belongs upon the Sheriff
and the officials who connived with him in the com
mission of this outrage.
Let Sheriff Bellew and District Attorney Dorn
stand up and explain their connection with this scan
dal. If they cannot do so, and wholly change the
present aspect of the affair, they are unfit for any
"place of trust.
The penitentiary is for the reform of evil-doers and
the protection of society. Its purpose is in no measure
to afford, an opportunity to avarice to line pockets
with fees. Even had the boys been guilty, why were
they taken one by one to prison instead of alto
gether? Three trips meant more money to the
Sheriff.
It has been long since so cold-blooded an act has
been charged against anybody holding authority.
The forfeiture of his position would be a mild penalty
to visit upon each shown to be a participant in the
cruel and unprecedented procedure. At least they
cannot deny the press and public the privilege of
making a few remarks about them.
IN overruling a demurrer interposed to the applica
tion of the Mutual Electric Light Company for a
writ of mandate compelling the Board of Super
visors to award it a contract for which it claims to
have been the lowest bidder, Superior Judge Seawell
has laid down some law which is at once hopeful and
interesting. Indeed, it throws more light upon the
illuminating situation in this city than any recent
declaration of the courts, and if it shall finally become
the law of the suit brought by the Mutual company
it will be worth many thousands of dollars annually
to the people and taxpayers of the municipality.
The lighting situation in San Francisco has long
been an anomaly among "problems." The constitu
tion provides that in cities where there are no public
works owned and controlled by the people for sup
plying the same with artificial light, any person or
company may lay pipes or conduits, under the direc
tion of the Superintendent of Streets and in accord
ance with such regulations as the authorities may
prescribe, and engage in the business without other
franchise or privilege. This law was made for the
purpose of introducing competition into the manu
facture and sale of gas and electricity. It is a plain
case of granting a franchise to whomsoever may
choose to invest his capital in the worthy business of
reducing the cost of artificial light.
The provision has been annulled in this city, how
ever, by the simple expedient of placing an embargo
on electric light poles. The Supervisors have adopted
a resolution declaring that telegraph poles are
a nuisance and giving the owners of those
that are up a few years m which to
remove them. Naturally, when a competing
electric company appears and asks for the privilege
of erecting poles the board answers that, having or
dered those already up to be taken down, it cannot
perpetuate the nuisance by allowing it to be extended.
The practical result is to create a monopoly in elec
tric lighting, since no corporation can lay an under
ground system and compete with an overhead
system.
Judge Seawell has simplified this remarkable situ
ation by declaring* that the constitution, which says
in terms that one class of citizens shall not be granted
privileges or immunities which may not be enjoyed by
other classes, cannot be nullified in this manner. If
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company is to
be allowed to maintain poles, he says, the law com
pels the Supervisors to grant the same permission to
the Mutual company. If this is done of course the
lighting monopoly will go down with a run, for the
latter corporation has offered to do the city's work
for $40,000 less a year and grant consumers a 25 per
cent reduction on their bills in consideration of the
privilege of maintaining poles.
It is fervently to be hoped that the principles Judge
Seawell has announced will become the law of the
municipality: Artificial light is a necessity, and it
should be cheapened as much as possible. Most
other public utilities are luxuries, but the lives,
health, property and personal safety of the people de
pend upon the city being thoroughly lighted. Light
is civilization, darkness is barbarism. The law on
grounds of public policy alone ought to maintain
competition in the manufacture and sale of so great
a necessity as electricity is coming to be.
An evening paper charges that one of the Police
Judges refuses to try "drunks." It is indeed pitiful
that for a mere $4000 yearly high-toned jurists must
be brought into contact with blear-eyed citizens of
unpleasant aspect. Perhaps it would be wise to per
mit the balking member of the bench to try his dis
agreeable cases over a long-distance telephone.
Cuban soldiers would accept pay from the United
States treasury. . By all means let them have it. Then
let Uncle Sam buy every Cuban baby a rattle and a
gum ring. We went into this business for the pur
pose of making the Cubans happy, and our aim is
still to please.
A grim old soldier like General Young seems to
have entirely escaped the hysterics while in Cuba.
In fact, the General entertains a notion that war is
characterized by- hardships, and to have run up
against them before. ' ; ; ", %*

r For General Greely to say that the volunteer; army
has been a good deal of a failure was neither neces
sary, nor gracious. In all likelihood if he did say it he
had been taking a dose of quinine out of Chaplain
Mclhtyre's bottle. "''.'â "
While contemplating the erection of a temporary
City and County Hospital it is well to remember that
the rotten old shack now partly serving the purpose
was erected to be temporary.
There may yet be a chance to annex a few Spanish
ships to the navy without depending upon the badly
battered ones in Cuban waters.

which brought added fame and fortune to
the clever colored comedian. It appears
that he was sauntering leisurely along
the colored quarter in Chicago one night
after his turn at one of the theaters.
As he was passing a dance hall his at
tention was attracted by a party of his
brethren, consisting of three females and
as many males, who came tumbling down
the steps of the terpsichorean resort, the
men brandishing razors of massive pro
portions, the feminine members of the
brunette contingent being busily engaged
in the laudable occupation of pulling out
each other's hair. The fight was rudely
interrupted, however, by an officer of
Irish persuasion, who swooped down upon
the six disturbers and also upon Hogan,
who was intently watching proceedings,
and gathered them all in.
"The next morning they were brought
Into court to answer the charges and
Hogan was the sorriest 'coon' of all.
He asked for a private talk with the
Judge and it was granted him. After he
had explained who he was and that he
was simply an innocent spectator of the

who 'had made the arrest and said,
'Flaherty, how comes it that you ar

looked at Hogan and then at the six of
fenders and replied, 'Well, begorrah, all
Oi know is there was a terrible foight
goin' on an' Ol ran them all In, because
"all coons look alike to me."
"Hogan was released at once, and tak

correspondent asks: "Runner on first '
base, batter hits a grounder to first base
man, who touches the base, retiring the
batter. Is the runner forced and may he
be put out by touching second base?
(Yes.) First and second bases are occu
pied, batter hits infield fly, if fly is caught
or not caught and runners remain on
bases (first and second) aro they out?
(On an infield fly the umpire, whether the
ball is caught or muffed, declares the bafer.
ter out and those on bases are out.). If
the runners get around to second and
third bases and the fly is caught, what is
the result? (They are put out.)
HOW TO VOTEâ J. S., City. The law of
the State of California does not provide
for a method by which a voter can by a
single mark indicate that he votes a
straight ticket. The law is that "on re
ceipt of his ballot the elector shall forth
with, and without leaving the inclosed
space, retire alone to one of the places,
booths or compartments provided to pre
pare his ballot. He shall prepare his bal
lot by marking a cross after the name, of
the person or persons for whom he In
tends to vote." From this it follows that
if an elector should at a Presidential elec
tion place a cross in the space to the right
pf the first of the Presidential Electors
and none opposite the other eight ha
would vote for one only.

Test.mony Regarding the Purchase
and Delivery of Supplies.
Methods of Preserving
Timber.
State Benater J. H. Dickinson, repre
senting Contra. Costa and Marin counties;
Senator W. '-"â  Prisk. representing Ne
vada. Sierra and Plumas, and Senator E.
TV. Chapman, who represents El Doradc
and Placer counties, held two sessions
yesterday as a Senate investigating com
mittee t } look into the affairs of thâ¬
State B r ard of Harbor Commissioners foi
San Francisco. The committee met in
the -rain room of the Commissioners ir
the new depot. Frank Brandon, secre
tary of the Senate, attended the session
In an official capacity. Commissioners
Colnon. Harney and Herold listened tc
the testimony and occasionally supplied
missing links of Information.
Shortly after 10 a. m. Howard C.
Holmes, chief engineer of the board, was
called to the witness-stand, and in re
sponse to questions propounded by Gen
eral Dickinson explained the methods
employed by the San Francisco Timber
Preserving Company in creosoting piles.
It was disclosed in the testimony that
there is no competing firm. Two Southern
Pacific employesâ G. Curtis and John
G. Isaacs â patents for preserving
timbers used for piling.
Mr. Holmes in the course of his testi
mony said: "Piles are purchased through
the purchasing agency of the board. The
requisition is first made by the superin
tendent of repairs. The last contract was
let by the board for one year. There
was no advertisement for bids. Bids
were invited for creosoting the piles."
Regarding ferry slip accommodations
Mr. Holmes said there were five slips now
in use. One was used by the Donahue
road, one by the North Pacific Coast line
and three were used by the Southern Pa
cific. There remained one spare slip and
also a lay-up slip. At the present time
the Southern Pacific was using the lay
up slip, but the occupation was not per
manent. All of these slips are within the
building front. .'â¢ .
"It would crowd us," testified Mr.
Holmes, "to accommodate more than two
more ferry lines."
Further questions were asked concern
ing the use of oil to preserve the piling
timber. It was developed that the quan
tity of creosote used is ten pounds to the
cubic foot. More than that is used in the
East. The chief engineer advocates four
teen pounds per cubic foot.
George \V. Root, who has held the posi
tion of chief wharfinger for thirty-eight
months, was the next witness. He testi
fied that the dockage facilities for sea
going vessels were ample. He estimated
that there were berths sufficient to accom
modate at one time 200 vessels. He could
only recall two instances where vessels
had to wait on account of crowded docks.
Then heavy weather outside had delayed
a larg-** fleet, and a favorable breeze had
brought In a great many at once.
Mr. Root said, in response to questions
by General Dickinson, that the seawall
Â«=hould be extended south.
S Chief Engineer Holmes was recalled to
enlighten the committee as to the expense
of dredsrfr.?. He explained that the equip
ment consisted of two dredgers and two
tugboats. The average cost of dredging
RAIN MAY FALL IN PLENTY.
Precipitation Dp to Yesterday.
CORNIA is fretful over this broodingmeteorologlcal peace that Is
sr warm and dry the seat of winter. These weeks of glorious â 
u-e made it fairly shrink and wince, half fearful that
to be another "dry season," 1 with the fields and hills
already long athirst. There are a great many millions at stake. A
hopeful prophecy is wanted and any weather astrologer even of the
goooebrcast school will be eegeriy listened to. "Wet or dry?" they are
calling to Forecast Official Hammon, but Hammon says only in effect: "It
will be a dry season if it don't rain, but if it rains enough it will be all
right. I don't know and nobody knows. If a man thinks h-=> knows. I think
he doesn't know enough to know that he doesn't know anything about it."
There is absolutely nothing to guide a guess, ft may be dry,, extra dry.
medium or wet. The records have been figured up, down and across by
days, montlta ar.d years, and there isn't a combination, contrast or coin
cidence worth a moment's notice. Yesterday the edge of a storm began i
drifting Urfi way and showers are predicted for to-day. We may have
two weeks of rain or two weeks of sunshine thereafter.
The chief thing that may inspire hope and save nerves is the plain fact
that a small amount of rain early in the season is no indication of a dry â 
season. In a number of years a dry fall has been succeeded by a wet win
ter and spring. Since ISTI ther^ have been years when the seasonal rain
fall up to November is w&a leas than this year. Of these two came out j
with more than the average rainfall.
The accompanying illustration shows a few of the frealn tA the
record. In MB there had been but .06 of an inch of precipitation on No
vember IS. yet the !:â¢ ; m jfJH inches. This season's record to
date is 1.92 inches. The lowest .seasonal record when less rain than now
had fallen by November 1 â  inches in 1572. In 1873 the figures are
1.24 and 24.73. In ISS7 at this date the measure was .32 inches, and in 18SS it
was .33, yet ttiese seasons received rspectively 16.74 and 17.5R inches of rain.
On the other Band, in IS7S. when the record was 4.01 on November 18, the
total was but 11.04, and last year, with a seasonal showing of but 9.38
Inches, there had been more rain at this date â 2.08 inches. In 1877-78 the â¢
figures were 2.11 and 35.13. The entire record bears out the negative wis
dom that it is too early to worry. :
was 7 or S cents. The cost had not j
changed in twenty-four years. That was
the ruling price in 1*74.
p. T. Brown, superintendent of tugs and
! dredgers, readily answered the questions
I by the Senators. He said ne made
-itions for coal whenever fuel was
ssary. He coaled his dredgers twice
' a month.
Whfn the Senators reassembled for the
session James J. Flynn. pur
chasing agent of the Harbor Commission,
testified that he was appointed April 6,
1?98. to succeed Mr. Peterson. He said he
I purchased supplies for the commission on
j the requisition of various heads of depart
; ments. General Dickinson attempted to
! ascertain if a requisition was approrved
; by any other than the person making it,
, and the replies left the impression that
j whenever the head of any department
â  wanted hardware, tools or lumber he gave
j an order for it and this order was tilled
t by the purchasing agent.
Mr. Flynn explained that he invited
j competition and purchased goods at the
I lowest market price. He passed Judg
ment on the bids himself for all small
: amounts. On purchases amounting to $400
or $500 the advice of the board was sought,
i The witness testified: "I keep a com
\ plete record in book form of requisitions,
of delivery of the goods and the payment
of bills. Everything purchased is entered
in the stock ledger. An inventory is taken
every month. Tag receipts show the
: quantity of coal Issued, but I have no ac
tual knowledge that the coal is used.
The purchases including lumber and coal
amount to $8000 a month. Black Diamond
coal, at $4 85 per ton, is used."
Mr. Flynn explained that lumber was
purchased at less than the market price. -
The witness said in response to ques
tions asked by Commissioners Colnon and
Harvey that he had received no Instruc
tions from the board or any member or <
the board to purchase supplies from any
particular firm or individual.
General Dickinson figured out the an-
I nual purchases at J98.0W, of which amount
' lumber and coal purchases, under the con
tract, amounted to $72,000. The remaining
i supplies, amounting to $34,000. were pur
; chased by the purchasing agency. li. was
. further figured that Mr. Flyr.n's salary
of $21<Â» per annum and the salary of his
assistant and a boy to drive, amounted,
; all told, to $4000 per annum. General
Dickinson, therefore, made the calcula
tion that it cost the State $4000 to super
vise the purchase and delivery of sup
plies valued at $24 â 
Commissioner Colnon announced that
' he would make a statement concerning
the purchase of supplies before the com
mittee concluded the investigation. He
remarked that he was responsible In a
measure for the new system.
L F Long, superintendent of urgent re
pairs was the next witness called. He
.^d that he ordered, through the
purchasing agent, the lumber required to
make repairs and designated where the
lumber should be delivered.
The testimony brought out the fact that
a new order was recently put in foi#e
which requires the superintendent of ur
gent repairs to secure orders from the
'<â  chief engineer in regard to repairs. This
was adopted to cover certain law
i points. ______^__^_
FEAST FOR THE ORPHANS.
More Illegally Killed Fish Seized by
Deputy Commissioners.
The bay fishermen who are netting un
dersized striped bass are having their
work for nothing. Under the State law
no one is allowed to take or offer for sale
any of these fish weighing under three
pounds. It is not easy to arrest the first
offenders, so the deputy commissioners
arrest the middlemen or dealers when
they can and seize a!! the undersized fish
they can find. Early in the week nearly
300 pounds were confiscated in Wells. Far
go & Co.'s express office and sent to the
Almshouse. where they were much appre
ciated by the old people.
Another lot was seized in Oakland a few
days ago and the dealers were arrested.
Yesterday It was learned that a consign
ment haa been made by Eldridge Bros, of
Pinole to A. Palidini of this city. When
the fish arrived Deputies Vogelsang and
Davis confiscated the entire Int. consisting
of 125 pounds. This lot was sent to the
Hebrew Orphan Asylum for the*benefit of
the little folks there 1
The Social Evil.
Every clergyman in San Francisco
should r<*ad the editorial in this week's
Town Talk on the social evil and the man
r,er In which the Paulist Fathers are seek
ing to eliminate it from the city. The
' arguments in the editorial are put forth
, in the powerful language and clear diction
;' for which "Our Opinion" is famous. There
are some good stories in The Saunterer
; this week, and the stage and musical
: critiques are interesting. The Bonelli
pupil recital is fully treated. There Is a
satirical sketch with the "New Woman"
a? its subject, and various other readable
i topics are touched upon. â¢
THE SAIN" FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1898.
DEATH HOVERS
BESIDE DURIE
HEITHIER'S COT
Critical Stage of Her
Injury Has Arrived.
MOTHER COMFORTS CHILD
NO REPROACHES, ONLY WORDS
OF LOVE.
The Wounded- Girl's Condition Per
mitting, She Will Be Removed
From the Receiving Hos
pital To-Day.
Durie Helthier may never fully awaken
from the semi-stupor In which she has
been kept since she shot herself because
of her desertion by George Alexander.
The crisis Is fast approaching and the
next twfnty-four hours will bring the
turningr point either toward convalescence
or death. The emotional and impulsive
temperament of the unfortunate child
still asserts itself despite the opiates
which are administered to assuage her
sufferings.
At Intervals, when the torture of her
fevered wound decreases momentarily,
she brightens perceptibly and plaintively
expresses a desire to get well and go back
to her home in the hills, where a mother's
sheltering love will protect her from de
ceit and woe. But she suffers intensely
nearly all the time, and the torture seems
greater than human strength can bear.
Then she cries In agony. "Oh, why can't
I die? I have nothing now to live for."
All day yesterday the girl's heartbroken
mother sat beside her cot. Early In the
morning, after she had regained control
of her overwrought feelings, the mother
was told she might go to her child.
Eagerly, but with labored restraint, Mrs.
Heithier hastened to the bedside of her
child. No word of reproach came from
the motner's grieving lips. Tenderly and
lovingly the mother entwined her arms
about ncr offspring. Then the maternal
h.--art could no longer restrain emotion.
The doctor's admonitions were forgotten
Instantly and Mrs. Heithier bent over
ar.d kissed th^, parched lips and pale
brow of her first born.
Durie awakened, recognized her mother,
and a sweet, innocent, contented smile
j showed that she knew of one love which
would never fail her and never cast her
off, no matter what disgrace might be
thrust upon her. The poor girl's
attempt to nestle In the sheltering arm?
was most pathetic. With a glad intona
tion she murmured faintly. "Mamma,
mamma," and then, overcome by weak
ness and the morphine, she closed her
sad brown eyes and sank into restful
1 slumber.
For hours the mother sat there, weepjng
! silently, with the sleeping child's hand
I clasped in hers. When the matron and
j doctor came to minister to the patient
j Mrs. Heithier woufd reluctantly yieki to
their kindly Intrusion, resuming her vigil
as soon as they were through. Like all
mothers, Mrs. Heithier is brave when her
child is in danger, and she heeded every
i word of advice given by the hospital offl
i cials. In the evening her brother, S.
! Caberzet, arrived from Sonera and she
was persuaded to go with him and seek
rest for the night. Mrs. GonzaleÂ«, Dune's
aunt, took the mothers place ar.d sat with
the sufferer until late last night.
The doctors have not been aole to ascer
tain the location of the bullet, as probing
is out of the question. The girl complains
of terrible pains in her left side, which in
dicates that the ball struck a rib and
was deflected downward. Dr. Thompson
and his associates at the Receiving Hos
i pltal regret that they have no cathode ray
! apparatus. With it they could dennitely
locate the bullet and possibly extract it.
Arrangements are being made to send
the patient to the German Hospital and it
was expected that ?he would be removed
last evening, but it was decided to post
pone her removal till this morning. She
has a fighting chance for her life.
Mrs. Heithier does not care to discuss
her daughter's unhapy love affair. Her
only desire is to take her girl home. She
knew Alexander wheg_he courted Durie
in Sonora. and had every confidence in
his integrity. With saddened fortitude
the mother accepts the new burden which
has been thrust upon her, and says:
"What's done is done. It will do no good
now to complain. Alexander has ruined
my child. God and his conscience will
surely punish him."
About 9 o'clock last evening a dapper
looking young man visited the hospital to
have an injured finger dressed. In some
way word reached Mrs. Heithier's ears
that the young man was Alexander. She
informed her daughter that Alexander
was present and advised her to remain
quiet. With a wild shriek the unfortunate
girl demanded that he be compelled to !
face her. Mrs. Heithier and her sister.
Mrs. Gonzales, without waiting to com
fort the excited girl, left the ward and i
started for the operating room, evidently
intending to wreak vengeance nn the false
lover. As they entered the operating
room they saw. instead of Alexander, a
wr'l-dressed young man having a slight '
wound dressed by "Colonel" Joseph Mo- '
gan. They at once returned to the bed- ;
side of the wounded girl, who was trem
bifttf with excitement, an dinformed her !
of the mistake.
"He will not come here." remarked Mrs.
Heithier; "he is too much of a cur for
that."
Her remarks had the effect of quieting
the excited patient and she soon fefi
asleep. _____________^_

PAPA WON'T GIVE
THE BRIDE AWAY
>â  Society is all agog exulting. "We have developed our own little ro- A
- mance of the Sloane-Hammond ilk and have a maiden, rich and fair, who -i
<â  will wed for love and love alone. - A
âº - Miss Ethel Murphy, daughter of S. Q. Murphy of the First National h
âº Bank, has yielded to the ungilded charms of the mischievous little god â <
âº and will wed Mr. Blddle, a humble department clerk of Washington. D. C. â¢>

*â  tune's favorite and so ' pleasing is the moral that they cheer and cheer â >
*â  and cheer again, and even then roll it round and. round, loth to let it go. -<
Papa Murphy, so says Dame Rumor, has nothing personal against young Â«
v Biddle. His blood is of the bluestâ and aristocracy and wealth may mate -
âº harmoniusly even Murphy pere admits. . However, what Mr. Murphy does -
âº complain against is that the young man, who will on Wednesday next -
âº become his son-in-law, has.no money nor means of making^ â much -
âºâ ' moneyâ and without goodly quantities of "ambrosial cash. ' Mr. Murphy -
âº can see but a dismal future for the daughter he has so carefully reared *nd -

y Mrs. Murphy, so again says rumor, while she would not have disdained â 
âº- a title, backed by ancestral halls and plethoric purse for her little â 
âº "Mousie," smiles kindly upon the noble Biddle, gives her blessing, and -
âºâ¢ has ordered for her dear one a choice (and extensive trousseau.
âº The day for the nuptials has been set. Wednesday next, and 100 mvi- -
âº tatlons have been issued for the occasion, wolch, again according: to fom- â 
k- sip, is to be an elegant affair in spite of the fact that Papa Murphy says â 
âº he won't give the bride away; that he won't attend thÂ». wedding and that â 
y âworse and worseâ won't settle a dowry upon her.
y Miss Murphy is too deeply in love with the man whose name she Is to â¢

RED TAPE.
Even Dead Soldiers Must Wait for Its
Untying in the Custom House.
The Custom House service is so bound ;
up in rod tape that even the de^d must
wait until the seals are broken leisurely
and officially. Whether the corpse be
either that of a hero of Manila or of a j
Chinaman from the Galla^agos Islands, it ;
must wait its turn. The latest instance of '
red tape in the administration of Custom j
House affairs is only a day old. 'Last Wed- j
nesday a customs broker addressed the
following letter to Collector Jackson:
â  Ex steamer Moana from Honolulu, arrived
this day. November 16, with three boxes con
taining three corpses of United States, sol
diers who died Hi Honolulu, and their remains
are now returned to the United States.
As appears by the manifest they are con
signed to Colonel Long at San Francisco to
forward* to destination. We would thank you
to' have a special permit of delivery issued for
these dead soldiers to enable Colonel Long to
forward to destination with as little delay
as possible.
The note was returned to the broker
with this indorsement:
Proluce the bills of lading or ret an order
from O.ior.el Long. E. B. J.
The Moana arrived on Wednesday and
the bodies were kept on board awaiting
the untying of red tape until Thursday
afternoon, when they were delivered to
the military authorities without any per
mit whatever, and simply on the promise
that a permit would be obtained later on.

GRIDIRON ATHLETES OF STANFORD AND UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA AWAIT THE REFEREE'S SIGNAL TO BEGIN BATTLE
Blue and .Gold Is Fast, Springy
and Full of Strategic
Resource.
FOOTBALLi is the sauce that goes
with every meal at either of the two
colleges at tho present time. Whether
it be breakfast, lunch or dinner, the
one subject of conversation is the
came. Let two or more students of Cali
fornia or Stanford come together and the
Thanksgiving day battle is fought out on
a mental gridiron. Touchdowns are mado,
goals are kicked, and tho measure of
somebody's coffin taken and the pall
bearers chosen. Half of it will be what
Captain Rercy flail, University of California.
CAN CORBETT WHIP
THE BURLY SAILOR?
According-'to the latest Intelligence from
the training quarters of Tom Sharkey
and James J. Corbett. the heavy-weight
nose-breakers will be in splendid fettle on
entering the ring next Tuesday evening.
Naturally all persons interested in the
game desire to know who will win. Some
Bay <"orbettj while others pin. their faith
on tho sailor. If the contest is allowed to
proceed a winner will certainly be named,
and if the battle BhouM come to an abrupt
conclusion doabtleaa Corbett will receive
the award on points.
The Question now asked by many Is:
"What has Sharkey done- to place him on
a par with Corbett from any. point of
view excepting bull strength and ten-
a ThVir records speak for themselves. To
illustrat-- we will go back to the Fitzsim
mons-Sharkey tight in Mechanics' Pavil
ion Those who were present on that
memorable occasion do not forget how
Fitz handled the burly sailor. He hit him
when and where he pleased, and was hold
ing an easy winning hand when Sharkey
feigned sickness from a blow which he
Bald had injured his groin. It Is not nec
essary to go into details concerning that
entertainment. Suffice it to say that Shar
key was simply a chopping block In front
at the cool and hard hitting ex-black
t-raith. *
The next contest of importance in which
the bold Thomas figured was when he met
James J. Corbett Uttder the same roof In
a limited contest of four rounds. The ex
champion figured on an easy game and
met his opponent when he was in the
â¢worst possible condition for- a contest of
any kind.
Tlie result of Corbett's Indifference
came very near losing him the bout and a
besmirched title. As It was, had not the
police interfered at a moat opportune
time, Sharkey would, beyond a shadow of
a doubt, have knocked Corbett Into the
land of dreams. But. as before stated,
Corbett entered the ring feeling like a
New York Alderman after enjoying a
Thanksgiving dinner, and consequently
a comparison between the fighting abili
ties of the men cannot be taken from a
contest of thiÃ nature.
Now we will drift back to the Carson
battle. The thousands of people who
watched with impatient eyes every move
ment of the flg-hu T9> in that remarkable
contest will acknowledge that for six
rounds Corbett smothered Fitzsimmons
(the man who made a monkey'of Sharkey
for eight rounds), after which his steam
became exhausted and he gradually pined
away.
Now if Oorbett can make a punching
drum of Fitz's face for six rounds the
question arises what is he capable of
doing to Sharkey, whose late fight with
Jeffries did not prove that he had made
much improvement in hitting, although
in foot work it must be admitted that
he advanced a peg or two?
Granting that the contest will be con
ducted on thfÂ» square, to use a ring phrase,
what may be the probable result? Doubt
loss Corbftt will tantalize the sailor lad
by left hand jabs on the nose to such an
extent that the receiver of buckskin
punches will forget the valuable instruc
tions that will be Imparted to him by his
manager, Thomas O'Rourke Esq., and a
grand charge- a la Donnybrook fair will
then be made by the Irish bull on his
opponent, and thenâ wt-1), what
then? Police! Police!
Should the contest go on to a finish
Corbctt will certainly win on the number
of points Scored. In fact Sharkey's only
chance at winning will be by a knockout
and even at that game Corbott will more
than probably accomplish the trick after
he has had the sailor's face looking like
the setting sun.
In local circles the coming event which
will doubtless attract widespread atten
tion will be the Lavigne and Tracey con
test of twenty rounds. On this day week
the ones who played the winner of the
mill will naturally feel happy. The losers,
on the other hand, will not have a word
to say. As a rule losers do not like to
discuss past events. The battle, which
should be of the most interesting nature,
between two exceptionally clever men,
will doubtless run on to near the finish,
as Tracey is certainly not going to mix
things In a hurry with his strong and ac
llve opponent. It goes without saying
lhat an immense crowd will witness the
mill, as the sporting people of this city
mow a good thing when it !s introduced.
The Atlas Athletic Club will hold its
next exhibition at Turn Verein Hall on
Monday. November 28, with the following
programme: Doc Flynn vs. Jack Dean,
might have been; the other half will be
reality.
But five days separate the enthusiast
from the one great athletic event of the
year, the annual intercollegiate football
contest between Stanford and California,
and they will be five cycles of twenty
four hours filled with the most gnawing
impatier.ee. At any time the interest in
the Thanksgiving game" is immeasurable,
but this year it is greater than ever be
fore. There are many reasons for this,
six rounds; Jack Sullivan vs. Jockey
Evans, six rounds: Billy Hogan vs. Joe
Ensbury. six rounds; E. Dahl vs. Jack
Kane, eight rounds; C. Vickers vs. Kid
Johnson, eight rounds.
OAKLAND GOLFERS'
CUP COMPETITION
Two weeks ago a qualifying competi
tion, IS holes, was held at the Oakland
Golf Club grounds to decide what mem
bers were eligible to compete for the
captain's cup, a handsome trophy pre
sented to the club by Orestes Pierce. All
who succeeded in making an average of
fifty or fewer strokes per round were eli
gible. The winner of the competition,
which, is held twice a year, has the hon
or of having his name engraved on the
cup. The competition for the cup was
held last Saturday and resulted in a vic
tory for Ernest R. Folger, with a score
of SO for the 18 holes, or an average of
45 per round. This was exactly the same
as the best score made In the qualifying
competition. For purposes of compari
son the scores In both competitions are
given herewith:

This afternoon an open competition, 13
holes, will be held at the Presidio links.
On Saturday, December 10, a match will
be played on the Oakland links between a
team of eight members of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club and an equal number of
the Oakland players for a sliver challenge
cup. The return match will be played on
the Presidio links on Saturday, December
17, between the same sixteen men.
Owing to the Increased number of play
ing members the directors of the Oak
land Golf Club Intend to enlarge both the
ladies' and men's dressing rooms in the
clubhouse and to add about sixty new
lockers.
The San Rafael Golf Club has a links
of nine holes, and many enthusiastic
players are to be found practicing on holi
days and Sundays. Early next year the
club will have a beautiful links of 18
holes, superior probably to any on the
Pacific Coast, and surpassed by very few
In the United States. The land acquired
by the club Is exceedingly well adapted
by nature for the purpose, being pictur
esque and varied; the surroundings are
pretty; there is plenty of rolling ground,
and there are several natural hazards.
The putting greens will be well grassed,
and there will be a fine green in front of
the clubhouse. Until we have rain not
much progresÃ can be made toward get
ting the links in order. The 18 holes will
make a round of about 6400 yards, or
nearly three and threp-quarter miles, so
that a player who makes two rounds. In
volving from 180 to 200 strokes. In an aft
ernoon will have earned his dinner.

the most prominent of which is the fact
that there is great doubt as to the out
come of the game. Last season there was
no fraction of doubt as to the result s,o
far as victory to one side and defeat lor
the other was concerned. It was a fore
gone conclusion that the cardinal would
triumph, the only question being the mag
nitude of the score. Hut now we have the
element of chance in the forecast. The
blue and gold and the cardinal are on a
level, although at the time of this writing
California occupies a position a bit more
elevated than her adversary.
For seven years have the two big col
leges of California met face to face on the
gridiron arena, and four scalps hang from
the Stanford belt. The other three games
were ties. Twice has Stanford won the
honors of the day by big scores and twice
by a single touchdown. The encounter of
Thursday next will be the eighth, and
there is "a strong probability that it will
be the first victory for the blue and gold
on the intercollegiate Held of pigskin bat-
A college team always takes a point of
view directly opposite to that of the pugi
list on the eve of baltle. The pugilist sees
but one party and that is himself. What
ever happen*, he ie convinced that vic
tory, with her smiling front, was made at
his express orvi;-r and its sole purpose is to
perch upon his brow. Not so the captain
of a college football team. He hopes for
victory, he fears his opponent, and sim
ply says that hi* men will do their best,
at all times paying the greatest respect
for the opposing tram. And that is why-
Captain Hall of California and Captain
fisher of Stanford are sincerely reticent
about the big game on Thursday. Coach
Cross will cay that California has a splen
did team, snappy, fast, well-drilled and
capable of displaying a strong front.
Coach Cochran declares that the Stanford
eleven will be worthy of the steel when it
Jumps onto the field and that It is to be
wholesomely feared. To this the Califor
nia coach adds; "The score will not be
2S â 0, however." Cochran thinks the score
will not be a large one; he forecasts it as
two touchdowns to the other side's one.
Ho will not say which side will have the
two, but from his manner of speech and
the twinkle in his eye the blue and gold
colors flashing through his brain were as
sociated with the number two.
For the first time in many years Cali
fornia has traversed a road that was not
altogether black and shadowy. The
ragged, unsystematized and uncertain
methods that were pursued with consis
tent regularity have givtn way to order
and certainty. Cochran began his work
on men who were of the most mediocre
talent. He has at least made a team of
them. They have played together pretty
much all season and their unified work
shows for it. Though the team has not
been authoritatively announced, it will
be the same that played in the- game
against the Olympics last Saturday. At
Stanford Cross has gone through gigan
tic labors in his endeavor to form a team
and has been handlcappeu a number of
times by accidents to thf men, preventing
their practice. The result is that he has
not been able to give the men that neces
sary team exercise which is the all in a
football eleven. He was obliged to de

The first bench show to ba held under

Pacific Kennel League will be inaugurat

and will last three days. It will be a nov

PITCHER DARLIN
IS A WISE MAN
Pitcher Donlln, from all accounts, is the
possessor of a "great, big, swelled head."
So comes the report from Watsonville and
various other quarters, and, judging from
his behavior, it is not hard to believe that
there is some truth in the assertion.
Donlin was a king while in "Watsonvllle.
The people and management were unrea
velop a centerâ in fact, an entire line,
with the exception of the ends. Then
from time to time his backs were not in
the physical condition to line up with the
team. All this was in the nature of a.
serious handicap, and this it is which
caused the slump at Palo Alto. The idea
of retrogradation at Palo Alto is akin to
the wooden horse trick of mythology. Ij
there is one thing at which the Stanford
team is successful it is recuperation. That
faculty is possessed by the cardinal to
such a marked degree that it really ap
proaches a resurrection. When the car
dinal returns from the six days' sojourn
at Congress Springs It Is a 100 to 1 shot
that the team will be in fine fettle and
with enough team play to Impress the
Californians that time was not neglected
at the Santa Clara County institution.
During the past week the spirit at both
colleges has been running high. The men
have been out for the nardest kind of
practice and improved conditions have
been noted at both places. On the Cali
fornia gridiron the second eleven has
been fortified by some old handsâSher
man, Plunkett, Cochran and Cadwalla
der. Cochran and Cadwallader played on
Monday and Tuesday nights against the
Varsity. They ripped things up generally,
but none more so than themselves. Coch
ran was forced to retire on Wednesday,
prevented from further participation in
the practice by a badly sprained thumb.
The pace was too hot for the forty super
fluous pounds of fat on Cadwallader, and
he took a rest to recover his wind. Sher
man and Plunkett. the giant of '9<5, stood
with It and they continued as an integral
part of the "scrub" team during the
rest of the week. The revival of spirit at
Palo Alto shows the team in a much bet
ter mental condition. There, too, the
graduate players have returned and were
out playing against and coaching the
Varsity. Large crowds have gathered
every night on the stands along the side
lines and made the quiet and peaceful at
mosphere of the college (eel a.s if it were
being subjected to a supernatural churn
ing. There is no doubt in the world that
Palo Alto has worked harder this last
week than ever before. In former years
the desideratum at the close of the sea
son was solely good physical condition.
This year it is that combined with team
power.
Owing to the injuries received from time
to time during the season the Stanford
eleven has not solidified into a coherent
mass. Even at this late day there is
some doubt as to who will play behind
the line. The rushers are pretty much in
the nature of fixtures, as far as positions
are concerned. The center will be com
posed of Biglow, with James and Blanch
ard on either side. Gilman, who is a candi
date for center rush, and Is now lining up
with the "scrub" eleven, may find himself
in the 'varsity on Thanksgiving day, but
the chances are against him. It is pretty
certain that James will play right guard
and Blanchard left guard, although
James is, at the time of ihls writing, suf
fering from what Palo Alto men call ma
laria. He was pent up to Congress
Springs ahead of the team to take the
waters for its eradication.
There is no doubt as to the tackles. Wil
son will be in the middle of the right
fide of the line and Rusk in the left.
They have been the choice tackles since
the beginning of the football season, and
they have earnestly worked for their
p'.aces on the 'varsity. The ends will in
all probability be Smith on the left ex
tremity and Parker on the right. Parker
is one of the malaria brigade, but one
would not imagine it from his playing.
Smith is still waiting for the parental
sancton to his playing, and he is confi
dent that his father will at the last mo
ment concede his heartfelt desires.
Back of the line Murphy will play quar
ter, and from ail indications he will play
it with that brilliance which has charac
terized his performances in the past. He
is a man with a head, speed and experi
ence, not to mention his punting and
dodging ability. Murphy has practically
captained the team on the field for the
last three years. He is cool, reliable and
crafty, the" man for the position. As far
as the halfbacks are concerned a marked
sonable in their praise of him, and noth
ing in the town was too good. This was
during- that period when Dunlin paid more
attention to his position than to outside
pleasures. But "success is intoxicating."
so I have heard, and exceptions to the
rule are few. Donlln, unable to live
through the adulation of his admirers and
the success which attended his every at
tempt in the pitchers box, became in
flated with the idea that he could run the
town of Watsonville. and do as he pleased
In a baseball way. Now the people of that
little town are a quiet set. and the man
agement of the team, being of the same
place, are naturally possessed of a like
disposition. However, there is a limit
even with the quiet folks., Donlin, while
a good pitcher, was simply going too far.
On the field he wished to run everything.
If a player was unfortunate enough to
make an" error, which every player must
do occasionally, be he a star or not, I am
told that he would almost chew his head
off thc-n and there. In the town at night,
when every one was sleeping, Donlin would
cut loose. He was the "star player," and
who would dare reprimand him? For a
while he did have full BWay, but one
sunny morn, not many days past, the
neat Donlln waÂ« released. Had such a
thing been thought of a month or so be
fore, a riot might have ensued. But the
once "great Donlln" has swelled, so the
story goes, to such an extent that even
his most ardent admirers in the town of
"quiet" have repulsed him.
Being released for possessing a "swelled
head" is rather unique, but such was the
principal fault found with Donlin. Prum
Watsonville he wandered to Santa Cruz,
but bas^balldom, and particularly that
portion of it known as Watsonville. m;iy
rest assured that the "swelled head" will
never trouble him again. This is so
because he is playing wifh a club which,
is most evenly balanced in all its depart
ments, and where one player la as good
as another. Donlin will have to work
mightly hard to hold his end up. It will
not be a case of one man being the supe
rior, and laying away over all oth
ers, but rather one where each player is
a good man and where each of these men
is as good as the other. So far Donlin
is very quiet and doing well. If this
"swelled head" proposition is not chronic
with him, something may be made of the
boy. I nope at any rate he nossesses suf
ficient reason to realize the situation.
To-day the Gilt Edges will play the San
Francis'cos at Recreation Park. As the
season is nearlng an end it would be well
for the fans to be on hand to-day and
see the leaders perform.
The line-up follows:

BEN SAYLOR PLAYS
LIVELY BILLIARDS
The name of Ben Saylor, formerly the
champion billiardist of this coast, Is fa
miliar to every lover of the game. Ben
is now playing high-toned billiards in
Chicago, judging from the following let
ter to The Call, which reads:
Billiard business In Chicago took a grand
fliurt the past week, the halls all over the city

respondingly "Jollied."
The experts at Green's put In a Very busy

greater number of his games. Harrison was in
poor form early in the week and suffered ig
nominious defeat at Saylor's hands at 3-cush
lons and the corner game. The surprise of the
season however, is the manner in which Saylor
has mastered the corner game. A steady
player at all times, Ben has mastered the
"angles," and his showing at this style of
game is away above par. Catton wan at one
time considered the greatest player in the
world at this game and last season Billy Splnks
threatened to dethrone him, but this season

uncertainty exists. Dole and Clinton are
the prospective candidates, and will most
likely be found in the game Thursday.
Dole is slated for left and Clinton for
right half. AH this is dependent upon the
condition of Burmeisuer, w r ho has been
the best fullback the college has produced
this season. Burmeister has a bad leg,
and it is not likely that he will play. This
leaves Captain Fisher for full, who, in
the event of Burmeister's return, who
play left half. He has been playing full
back for the last few days. Fisher has
had some little experience in this posi
tion, especially on the offensive. Murphy
will play in the far back field on the de
fensive.
Though the coaches will no.t admit that
the two teams are absolutely determined
as yet, there is hardly a doubt that the
California team will be changed at this
late day. Cornish Is the undeniable cen
ter, and the guards will be Greisberg and
Athern, the former on tho right side of the
line and the latter on the left. Hooper
and Barnes are good strong men for the
guard position, both rivals of Orelsberg,
but it seems now as if the former half
back was the winner. As on the Stan
ford eleven, there is no doubt about the
tackles. Pringle will play right and
Whlpple left tackle for the Blue and Gold.
The ends are likewise pickedâ Craig left
and Womble right. The quarterback will
be either Hopper or Thane, with the lat
ter about ten chances to the other man's
one, since Hopper's second injury to his
knee. Percy Hall, captain and left half,
"Locomotor" Smith right half and Pete
Kuarsburg full, will complete the quartet
of backs for California.
Stanford has the advantage of Cali
fornia in weight, but to no very great ex
tent. There is about fifty pounds superi
ority in the cardinal team in the matter
of flesh, which is a great deal less than
last year. Yet withal this Stanford will
in all probability adhere to its ingrained
pollcv of the last three seasons, bucking
the line and massed rush play. The car
dinal has a pair of ends that are quick,
active men and it is not at all unlikely
that they will be mn a number of times.
In the practice games this year they were
used repeatedly as running ends and with
good results.
California will trust to fast football,
with more or less dependence upon run
ning plays. Cochran said a few nights
ago that the team would not use any of
the plays which it has not practiced on
the rumpus, as he did not intend to give
the eleven any secret, isolated work. But
it is a very difficult thing for a Prince
ton man of Cochran's caliber, a man who
understands the game in all its phases,
to desist from using a play which la his
own particular Invention. That Cochran
has something up his sleeve is certain,
and that his team will spring it is almost
equally certain. What he relies upon is
i.ara "play. Precision and concentration
are what he counts on to win the game
for the blue and gold.
Man to man there seems to be an equal
ity between the two teams. Judging from
p;i^t performances the California eleven la
the steadier team; that is, taking the car
dinal team as It has played in this city
In the games with the Olympics. Bhould
FAST TIME OVER
A SHORT COURSE
At the recent championship rowing re
gatta held over the Long Bridge course
the times made in all the races were sur
prisingly fastâ 7 mln. 30 sec. for the senior
barge, 7 mm. 43VÂ£ sec. for the Intermediate
barge and 7 mm. 45 sec. for the junior
barge. In the first heat of the senior out
rigged skiff and in the second heat of the
junior outrigged skiff only two men came
\o the starting line, so that, both being
certain of their places in the final heat,
no attempt to cover the course In quick
time was made; but the second heat of
the senior skiff was done in 9 mln. 2>^ sec.
and the tlnal heat of the senior skiff in
9 mm. 8 3-5 sec, and the final heat of the
junior skiff In 9 mm. 19 2-5 sec. v'ith re
gard first to the time made by the four
oared barges: The fastest time on record
for the stewards' challenge cup for four
oars at Henley regatta is 7 mm. 37 sec,
and was made by a Brasenose College
(Oxford) crew In 1890. The four oars in
the stewards' cup race are light racing
boats carrying no cockswain, and the
course at Henley from Regatta Island to
the bridge Is one mile and 550 yards,
straightaway and almost free from cur
rent, for on the days of the races the
locks above and below the course are kept
shut. The conditions at Henley are thus
most favorable to fast time. On the
Long Bridge course the ti3e is against the
oarsmen either going or returning; tne
boats lose considerable time in turning,
are clinker-built, comparatively heavy
and carry a cockswain- and yet the senior
barge crew is supposed to have covered a
mile and 880 yards in 7 mm. 30 sea, or
seven seconds faster than fhe record time
at Henley for a course 330 yards shorter.
The fastest time recorded for the Dia
mond sculls at Henley is S mm. 36 sec,
made by the magnificent oarsman Guy
Nickalls; yet the time in which A. \V.
Pape, in a boat of an inferior type, is
supposed to have covered the Henley dis
tance, plus 330 yards, and turned a stake
besides, in 8 mm. 44 sec, which la actually
seven seconds better than 8 mm. 51 sec,
the best Henley time next to Guy Nick
alls' 8 mm. 36 Bee. The obvious and only
Inference from these facts Is that the
Long Bridge course must have been sev
eral hundred yards short of the reported
one and a half miles.
While the barge races at the recent re
gatta were won by the favorites, the skiff
and shell races were disappointing. J.
Klunder of the Pioneers won the junior
shell race against one of his own club
mates, who entered to prevent the race
going by default. F. Dupllssea of the
South Ends, being untrained and out of
practice, was unable to hold hiÃ own
against Pape or Wittkopf. In the senior
skiff race, Dr. C. C. Dennis was disquali
fied for fouling and A. Webb of the Ala
medas won the junior skiff championship
from Fickert of the Arlels on a foul.
The South Ends have not retained one
out of the five championships won by
them last year, but by entering in four
events, only one of which they had a good
chance of wnnlng, they cleared them
selves of the charge of feeling a luke
warm Interest In the regatta of 1898. The
championships are now scattered. The
Alamedas hold three, the Pioneers two
and the Ariels and Dolphins one each.
Three fouls were claimed during the
races. Two of theseâ in the senior and
junior skiff racesâ were allowed, but the
third claim, of the Ariel junior barge
against the Pioneers, was not allowed.
The rowing season of 1898 has been, on
the whole, a very successful one. There
have been regattas at Long Bridge and
El Campo and pleasant outings and good
racing at Astoria and Guerneville. The
clubs have shown a more friendly disposi
tion toward each other than In past times,
and there are Indications of the growth of
more genuine amateur sentiment.

One thing noticeable is the splendid way
that California's men have been handled

A LOOKING-GLASS
FOR DUCK SHOOTING
The sportsmen and the farmers are
praying for a good rainstorm, and if
prayers are of any avail old Jupiter Plu
viub should certainly not overlook the re
quests of those good people.
Those who are of the opinion that the
northern flight of wild ducks has not yet
arrived should take a ride on the cars to
San Pablo or Benlcia and while journey
ing along the shore they will see thou
sands of birds loafing on the bay there
waiting for the coming of the first heavy
downpour. At night the ducks wend their
way to the grain fields and marshes con
tiguous to the bay, where they feed and
quack until the first streaks of light ap
pear in the eastern horizon, which is the
signal for a quick move to the open wa-
Speaking of duck shooting, Charley Carr
of Monterey, who has hunted wild ducks
for the past forty years, was relating
Some of the experiences of his younger
days in Illinois a few evenings ago to a
coterie of friends who had congregated at
the Black Jack Club's headquarters on
Sutter street. â tM Â
â¢â¢Now don't you know, boys, said smil
ing Charley, "that if I wanted ducks very
badly 1 could rig up a contrivance novel
to the sportsmen of this coast, but which
has proved fearfully destructive to the
wild ducks of Illinois." â Â». *lt
"For the lans sake, tell us all about it,
Charley, dear," pleaded James Josh Alark
"Well, boys," continued the champion
trap ehooter of Monterey, "when 1 was a
wild lad, full of duck fever, I made many
trips with the men who shot for market,
and naturally I learned a trick or two
about the game of wild duck bagging. la
the open waters on which the hunters
lived during the shooting season in BOacfea
game was fairly plentiful, but surprising
"Hunters resorted to all manner of de
vices for their capture, but the greatest
batrs were made by those who had an im
mense looking-glass which was attacked
by a contrivance to the prow of the hunt
ing boat and which almo3t completely
shut from view of the basking birds the
skiff which the hunter noiselessly sculled
in the direction of the unsuspecting flock.
The ducks, poor things, imagined, of
course when they saw their reflection in
the glass that they were being visited by
a friendly band, and I can well remember
even to this day how the live ones talked
to their pictured friends in the looking
glass as the skiff drew within close range;
then the hunter rose from his cramped po
sition and generally emptied four barrels
into the flock before the birds got out of
range. I have sÂ«en as many as seventy
five and one hundred ducks dead and dy
ing on the water after the black smoke
had cleared away."
Secretary Markland of the B. J. C. was
taken suddenly sick after Mr. Carr had
finished his narrative, but according to
latest advices Mr. Markland is rapidly
convalescing.

TENNIS GAMES AT
THE CLUB COURTS
Intercollegiate football is Just now ab
sorbing bo large an amount of public in
terest that the lawn tennis players have
hardly yet settled down to work in real
earnest. But when Thanksgiving day
shall have passed, Interest in the long
haired footballers will suddenly cease, and
the asphalt courts will be crowded with
enthusiastic players. This afternoon an
impromptu round-robin tournament,
men's doubles, will be held at the courts
of the California Lawn Tennis Club. Play
will begin at 2:30 and the players who
have scored most victories when darkness
falls will be the winners. The following
teams will take part: R. N. Whitney and
George S. Bradshaw; Grant Smith and
George F. Whitney; R. J. Davis and J.
Hooper; A. Carrigan and Duval Moore;
W. H. Yale and R. J. Buchly; A. J. Buck

On Thanksgiving day there will be no
lawn tennis on the courts on Bush street
but early next month It Is proposed to'
hold a day of exhibition games between
the best players on the coast, such as the
Whitney brothers and the Hardy broth

claim he lost. He that as it may, the cap
tain, in his Supervisorial capacity, has
determined t .at games of chance with the
dice and cards shall cease in San Fran
cisco forever and a day, if he can com
pass the result. As for games of chance
with nlriel-ln-the-slot machines, why,
those â will pass muster. Inasmuch as the
owners of the machines are really good
fellows, who will put up cigars when they
meet a Supervisor on the street.
Feeling in this way the captain recently
introduced an order in the Board of Su
pervisors making it a misdemeanor to
gamble with cards and dice, roulette
wheels, or any old thing, except nickel-in
he-slot machines. This order was refer
red to the Committee on Health and Po
lice, of which the captain is a member,
and yesterday it was up for consideration.
The eloquence of Delany on this occasion
was of an unusually high order. He talked
like a Methodist exhorter on the evils of
gambling In a. great city. "Gentlemen,
said the Supervisor, "it won t do to let
the San Francisco public go on in the old
way, accepting gold bricks from tin-norn
gamblers and Sacramento card sharps.
Cards are dangerous things. I've been
there and I know. Dice will rob the poor
man of his last cent, if he don t under
stand how to throw them when loaded.
All gambling machines are an invention of
the devil, that arch enemy of the human
race.
"No I must except the nickel-in-the-slot
machine. That is a thing of beauty and a
joy altogether. You put in your nickel
and you draw out a dime. Fancy the poor
man, with one nickel in his. pocket, going
into a saloon to buy a glass of beer and to
nibble at the free lunch. Henceforth he
will enter a saloon for a different purpose.
He will take his nickel and drop it in the
slot. Out will come two nickels, and he
will go on his way rejoicing down Kearny
street, where they sell a good 10-cent meal
for a dime. I'm in favor of the slot ma
c nines."
The logic was irresistible and the com
mittee with promptness and dispatch ap
proved of the anti-gambling order as pre
pared by the captain and ordered a favor
able report to the Board of Supervisors
next Monday.
Now it is expected that a few suspicious
people will be heard making remarks to
the effect that somebody has put up a
good round sum of money to drive all
gamblers into patronizing the nickel-in
the-slot machines, but it is that way with
every reform.

ATTEMPT TO POISON
A VALUABLE CANINE
CHARLES NEWMAN'S GOLDEN
LION THE VICTIM.
Several Animals Have Been Killed in
the Vicinity and There Is a
Suspicion as to Who the
Guilty Party Is.
An unknown miscreant made an at
tempt yesterday morning to poison
"Golden Lion," the valuable St. Bernard
dog owned by Charles Newman. The
condition of the dog was discovered in
time and the prompt use of emetics saved
his life.
When Mr. Newman left his home at 424
Post street, yesterday morning. Lion was
to all appearances in good health. About
10 o'clock Mrs. Newman discovered he
was in great pain and immediately noti
fied her husband, who returned to the
house to find the dog in convulsions.
Emetics were administered, and after sev
eral hours' work Lion was pronounced out
of danger.
During the past few weeks a number
of dogs and cats have been poisoned in
the vicinity of Mr. Newman's home, but
why any one should wish to kill Lion
the owner is at a loss to explain. Tho
dog is of a very gentle disposition and
so well trained that he has never been
known to bother even the children who
play with him.
Golden Lion is well bred, has a num
ber of tricks and has a record of five feet
seven and a quarter inches for a high
jump. Mr. Newman values the animal
at $1000. He has a suspicion as to who
the person is who attempted to poison
his pet and promises the fellow an inter
esting time if he can prove his guilt.

French Boys Will Entertain.
Under the auspices of the Sodality of
St. Aloysius an interesting and enjoyable
entertainment will be given in the base
ment of the French church on Bush
street next Sunday afternoon. Prepara
tions In anticipation of the event have al
ready been completed. A well arranged
programme of both literary and murical
selections will be rendered by the mem
bers of the sodality and will constitute
the main and principal feature of the
entire entertainment.
Owing to the talent of those who will
make the affair a success, a large audi
ence Is expected to be present, more
through curiosity than any other reason,
to see what French boys can do in the
way of presenting to the public a pro
gramme of interest as well as enjoyment.
The committee of arrangements consists
of Rene Dumontelle, Patrick Donahue and
Camllle Lahanier. The instrumental
music will be furnished by the sodality
orchestra, the members of which will ren
der many individual selections on differ-
ent Instruments.
The entertainment will commence
promptly at 3 o'clock. Tickets can be se
cured by those desirous of attending at the
home of the clergy Immediately adioining
the church, on Bush street, or at the box
office at the entrance to the hall.
Ellis-Street Car Line Extension.
The Market Street Railroad Company
contemplates extending its Ellis street
line to the Affiliated Colleges and the
proposed Sutro Library. To accomplish
this change the Stanyan street line will
be continued from Frederick along Stan
yan street to Parnassus avenue, along the
latter to J street and Fourth avenue.
Other important street railroad changes
and extensions are under consideration.
The next stretch of roadway to be con
verted from steam to an electric line is
that running from Central avenue along
California street through the Richmond
district. This line will be changed as
soon as the San Bruno road la finished in
the early spring.
Poison Theory Groundless.

A GREAT MINING
BUREAU PLANNED
MINING MEN PROPOSE A
PRACTICAL ONE.
The Miners' Association May Revo
lutionize Itself and Enlarge Its
Scope and Purposes.
A new and striking project will be
brought before the annual convention of
the California Miners' Association, which
will begin a three days 1 session in Native
Sons' Hall on Monday. It is proposed to
enlarge greatly the scope, purposes and
membership of the association, and if the
idea is carried out the mining Industry
should receive a great uplift in the State.
The proposition is to make the associa
tion a permanent and active force which
shall constantly and in all possible ways
foster not only gold mining, but every
form of the industry in the State. To this
end it is proposed that permanent head
quarters be established, and that the
secretary shall be the active executive
force, giving all his time to the work at
a good salary and possibly with the aid
of assistants. He shall be a practical
and energetic mining man, shall hustle
about the State and direct a bureau in
tended to advertise the mineral resources
of the State, supply general information
to prospectors,, miners and investors and
aid the industry in every way open. The
work would somewhat resemble that of
the State Board of Trade, and might In
clude a badly needed permanent mining
exhibit here. It would also be prac
tical and not scientific merely, and in this
and in the projection of a real initial
force into this great industry it would
supplement what is done by the State
Mining Bureau. It is being urged by the
Mining and Scientific Press and leading
men interested in the industry.
It is announced that Lieutenant Gov
ernor Neff will positively retire from the
presidency which has been forced on him
ever since its organization six years ago,
and a lively contest for the office has
started between W. C. Ralston and Secre
tary Julian Sonntag. E. H. Benjamin of
Alameda and Robert M. Turner, late of
Nevada Counts', are rival candidates for
the secretaryship. A large attendance is
assured and a number of mattters of
great Importance will be dealt with.
A VICTORY FOR SPORTSMLEN.
Corea's Heavy Fine Upheld by Three
Superior Judges.
The Fish and Game Commissioners of
this State consider they have wen a grand
victory over the violators of the game
laws of California. Yesterday Superior
Judges Cook, Wallace and Borden up
held the decision of Police Judge Conlan
in the case of J. F. Corea. In August
last, during the closed season for ducks,
Corea was found to have a lot of these
wild fowls for sale In his stalls in the
Washington-street market. The deputies
of the commission arrested him, and on
the 20th of that month he was taken be
fore Judge Conlan, found guilty and fined
$100. This was the heaviest fine ever im
posed in this State for the violation of
the game laws.
Corea and several of his fellow-dealers
decided to make a fight against the law,
and contended that the fine was exces
sive. The attorney for the commission
argued that it is just such men as the de
fendant who do more to encourage the
violation of the law than any others.
The argument that if the commission
merchants and dealers did not encourage
the market hunters to kill game out of
season by buying their product the law
would be violated much less had great
weight with the Superior Judges who up
held the judgment of Police Judge Conlan.
The case has been watched with great in
terest by the sportsmen and market
hunters, too, for that matter.
THE BEPORT SOLD.
It Is Now Controlled by E. W. Scrlpps
and Paul H. Blades.
A deal has just been consummated
whereby E. W. Scripps, president of the
Scripps-McÃae Newspaper League, and
Paul EL Blades have secured a controlling
interest in the Daily Report of this city.
Messrs. Scripps and Blades are old news
paper men and have interests in some of
the best known evening papers of the
country- At present Mr. Scripps is living
on his ranch at San Diego, and Mr. Blades
has been connected with the JLos Angeles
Record. Mr. Blades will take direct con
trol of the paper. The general policy will
be about the same and no important
changes will be made on the local staff.
The amount paid for the paper has not
been announced, but it is understood that
1500 of the 2000 shares were purchased by
Scripps and Blades for $45,000. Mr. Bunker
will retain his connection with the paper
for the present, at least.
A New Corporation.
Articles of incorporation were filed yes
terday by C. W. Kohlsaat, S. H. Fried
lander, J. L. Phelps, Thomas E. Ryan and
Samuel Samter for the exhibition of the
mutoscope on the Pacific Coast, and for
the purpose of conducting various amuse
ment enterprises. The capital stock is
$1,000,000. The mutoscope is the wonder
ful miniature biograph that has been
creating a great sensation here and
abroad, the original owners of which have
already amassÂ«d a fortune.
Activity of Vesuvius.
Much anxiety has bÂ«en caused In Naples by
the renewed activity of Mount Vesuvius. As
overwhelming danger of this description pro
duce* universal terror. As a matter of fact
there Is little likelihood that Mount Vesuvius
will do any serious damage. On the other
hand, thousands die dally from stomach and
digestive disorders, who might have survived

tar*. It ta the greatest of known tonics for
stomach and digestive organs. It cures kid
ney, liver and blood disorders.
WEBSTER WILL
NOT SIGN THE
DEMANDS
Trouble Ahead for the
School Board.
HOLDS UP MANY BILLS
AWAITS MAITDAMXTS SUITS BY
CREDITORS.
This Action Will Bring the Courts
Into Play to Investigate
the Alleged School
Swindles.
There is more trouble ahead for the
Board of Education. Superintendent of
Schools Webster has decided to refuse to
si{, m the batch of bills, aggregating about
$50,000, recently allowed by the Board of
Education, excepting only a few bills for
coal. He will likewise decline to sign the
large number of unpaid bills which are
pigeonholed in the office of Secretary
Welch of the School Board, and which
have not yet been presented to the board
by the finance committee.
The Superintendent spoke very decided
ly upon this subject to a representative of
The Call yesterday. Said he: "The
School Board has more than reached the
limit of its indebtedness, as nearly as I
can figure it, and I will refuse to affix
my signature to any more demands on the
treasury except those for coal and a lew
other absolutely necessary things. The
J5u,000 batch recently passed by the board
has not yet been presented to me for ap
proval, and it will do no good, for I shall
refuse. I have consulted various attor
ns ys and the District Attorney about the
responsibility of the Superintendent in
approving bills, and I am informed that
my function is a purely ministerial one;
that inasmuch as I have no voice in the
contraction of debts by the School Board
I am in no way responsible for the same,
but must affix my signature as a matter
of form. This is something that I shall
do no longer, however. The creditors of
the board will now have the opportunity
to bring matters to a crisis in the courts
by suing for writs of mandamus to com
pel me to sign their demands. Then the
legal status of this whole matter can be
determined. Some time ago I warned the
School Board in a communication that the
available funds were practically exhaust
ed. No attention was apparently paid to
the warning.
"My attention has been called to the
alleged jobbery in connection with the
furnishing of Mission High School, and
on next Monday Mr. Stone and myself
will visit the building and make a criti
cal Inspection of the new furniture and
equipment, so as to determine whether
or not the allegations of fraud axe well
founded."

Several years ago I was troubled with an aggfarated caw of
dyspepsia and, of course, the first thing I did was to consult a physi-
cian. As I had always enjoyed the best of health I was worried a good
deal over this, my first illness, and my only desire was to get well at
speedily as I could. I took regularly all \ the medicines as my doctof
prescribed them. In a short time I felt all right, thought I was cured
and stopped taking the medicine. But it wasn't long before I was feel-
ing as badly as ever, .and again I had recourse to the doctor. ThiÂ»
kept up some time until at last I : made up my mind I would quit
doctoring and try some of the remedies I saw advertised I had read
so much ,r of Ripans Tabules that I concluded I would give them
a good trial. It said one would give relief,' I thought if onÂ©
could give relief a whole lot might cure me. â  I purchased a dollar's
worth, and when I had finished them I was feeling better than 1 had
for years. I continued -to use them, and to-day I believe lam a per-
fectly well man. \ Once jn a great while I do have a slight touch of ';
the old malady, but a single Tabvlo foes it all riant : I fi9oÂ«aaj|
keep a supply at hoÂ»e."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. IS.â There were weak
points In the stock market to-day, but the
underlying elements of strength promised at
one time to overcome obstacles, and prices uni
formly went to a higher level. Apprehension
of a weak showing in to-morrow's bank state
ment turned the tide toward the side of reac
tion in the late dealings. The level of prices
â was In moat cases carried sharply below last
night, and net gains remaining were very much
reduced from the extreme advances of the day.
The most influential factor In causing weak
ness was theobvious liquidation going on In
Northern Pacific, which is attributed to one
of the leading officials of the property. The
absorption of stock was attributed to the lead
ing contending interest in the property. This
process of transference is significant of the
discord Bald to exist in the property. Rumors
are rife also of *.he breaking: of the agreements
which have been so favorable a factor In the
Northwestern railroad world. The effect was
manifested not only in Northern Pacific but
in Union Pacific and other railroads in the i
region affected. Delaware and Hudson was !
raided down to S3?* with accompanying ru^ i
nrrs of di -idend reduction. This Is the lowesK
price for several years and Is an accurate re- ]
flection of the decline in the anthracite trade,
other stocks affected by that trade falling in j
sympathy. Notwithstanding these elements ]
of weakness, the market showed good recupera
tive power, the buying of People Gas partic
ularly being a sustaining factor. The stock rose
an extreme 2- 4 . Burlington recovered a half j
of its quarterly dividend before the late re- j
lapse in the Grangers. Denver and Rio Grande |
pr" erred also showed continued strength.
The bond market showed a tendency to run |
off in the late dealings except for a few strong
spots after a period of early strength. Total
Bales, 13,275,000. United States threes and new
fours coupon advanced % in the bid price.

NEW YORK. Nov. 18.â Evening Post's
London cablegram nays: Americans were, the

those the support was still mainly confined to
Paris. Uerlin and professional operators here,
no transactions for the public yet being re
corded The close was a fraction easier. Ar
gentines were firm, but other markets were
featureless. Kaffirs were flat on the proposed
tax on mining- compnnles by the Transvaal
Government. .-,
Money rates in Berlin are a fraction easier.
New York Is said to be lending a large amount
of money to Germany for two or three months,
but 1 cannot verify the report. Germany, how

BHADSTREET'S FINANCIAL. REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Nov. Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will Â«ay: Compared
with this period in last weak both the stock
and bond transaction* have been on a smaller
scale and have been divested of any excite
ment. At intervals reactionary tendencies have
appeared, reflecting the taking of profits by
traders and large operators. The tone, how
ever, was in the main eteady and the public
shows greater interest in securities than for
a long time past, there being an excellent in
vestment demand for bonds and dividend-pay
in" stocks. When concessions appeared a good
buying demand asserted itself, although mere
was evidence of a good deal of changing of
speculative holdings from one part of the list
to another on the part of the public and the
stock market professionals. - The only posi
tively weak feature were a few stocks like
Northern Pacific common. In which realizing
fates outweighed the buying or Delaware and
Hudson, which broke on Friday on reports that
recent purchases of railroad |nes by the A an
derbUU Is adverse to other company inter
ests There was also a good deal of irregu
Srtty in American Sugar which, after a tur
ther advance in the beelnnlng of the
on covering of shorts, was dull and seemed m
cned to recede. On the other hand numerous
advances were scored, the most Prominent fea
ture being Atchlson preferred a Â£ d * he U8 h l ;
ment bonds of the same company GG a range^?
Baltimore and Ohio securities The Grangers,
however, under the lead of No rt h ,^ eÃ^ p Â±."2
Burlington, were very strong and Northwestern
stocks of both the St. J aul ""f.^Mg ce t EE n ff rer c
roads made new records besides -this there
were bullish movements in Peop'e L Gas Pa
cine Mall and a variety of railroad and In

0^
mmmMm
nartfcularlv Denver and Rio Grande preferred.
The market here took a mild interest In the
J^nor^ thlt the Paris peace conference might j
he bVok-n off by the Spanish delegates. Some
attention was paid in the early part of the
week to the slight hardening tendency of the
NeK? York money market, though the advance
Warded foreign exchange and bring on a gold
Import movement.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW TORK. Nov. 18â R. O. Dun A Co.'l
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
The situation Is clearer and the Improve
ment In business which was expected after the
election has begun. Payments through clear
ing houses arÂ« far the largest ever known for
the week. 37.3 per cent larger than last year
and 33 per cent larger than in 1892. The glnss
workern have resumed, the anthracite coal out
put is heavy and much beyond the present ca
pacity of the markets, the troubles In Illinois
coal mines have been settled and the new strike
of shoe workers in Marlboro. Mass.. is now the
only labor hindrance of consequence. It is
noteworthy that in spite of all changes the
price of spot wheat has but slightly changed.
The exports for the week, flour Included, have
'been 3,9158,76s bushels from Atlantic ports,
against 3,237.344 laÃt year, and Vrom Pacific
ports 955.093 bushels, against 2,191,334 last year,
making in all for two weeks of November 9,
312,331 bushels, against 9,939. 804 last year. Such
returns leave wide room for conjecture as to
the influences governing the price, but with
]f,';37.311 bushels received at Western points
during the week and In two weeks 20,261, .r>8
bushels, against ir.,285,167 last year. It can no
longer be said that Western supplies threaten
to run short.
The woolen manufacturer has gained In or
ders for the coming season, which Justifies the
heavy buying of materials recently seen, and
there are aiÂ»o better orders for bpeedy deliv
ery, but the demand Is not large and much
machinery I* still waiting idly.
While sales of wool at the three ehtef mar
kets were heavy, 28.234.500 pounds In three
weeks, against 20.565.902 last year, and 17,103.
100 In 1892, they Include two large sale* for ex
port, covering 3,000,000 pound* of Montevideo
and Australian wool at 16 and 18 cents, ro
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1898^
spectlvely, which make clearer the fact that
prices asked by holders here are relatively
high. Pome concessions at Philadelphia fol
low those at Boston, though the market is on
the whole steady.
Iron !k In bigger demand all the time ani
yet production steadily Increases, and at P'tts
burjc Bessemer pig Is slightly lower at JlO 10,
th* new association being: undersold. Orders
for plates are beyond all precedent, including
material for cars, bridges, vessels and worK
of all sorts, and structural wnrk Is seasonably
quiet, though the mills have much ahead,
while in bars the demand is considerably bet
ter at Plttsburg with orders for material tor
6000 cars at Chicago. Some works at the fc-ast
are short of orders and prices are held bacK.
The expectation is that the proposed rail as
sociation will meet an extremely heavy demand
next year, especially for trolley lines, but it is
stated that prices wlJl not be advanced aDo\e
*20 at the East and $21 at Chicago. In Iron
products the next will probably be a record
breaking ypar. âââ . ..
Failures for the week have been 233 in i trie
United States, against 267 last year, and <K> in
Canada, against "2 last year.
BRADSTREET'S ON THE CONDITION OF
TRADE.
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say:
Evidence accumulates that the good results
flowing from the recent elections are no longer
confined entirely to improvement In tone and
confidence, though the active feeling influences
dealings in both financial and mercantile lines.
Several substantial developments present them
selves this week, notable among which iir- a
number of advances in prices, exceptionally
few declines thereof, growing in strenjuy '"
the pigiron situation, unprecedently large weeic
bank clearings and remarkably good reports as
to export trade, not only in the line of foreign
products, but in enlarged trade In manufac
tured products distribution of merchandise
shows but little change from recently preced
ing weeks, but thÂ« growth In confidence Is re
flected in very general reports of Improved col
lections on past business. â¢
First and foremost In the line of foreign
trade extension are the returns recently made
for October pointing to rxports for that month
larger than In the corresponding month of any
preceding year, second only to those of Decem
ber last year, and chargeable not so much as
formerly to enlarged exports of farm prod
ucts but to heavily increased exports of fin
ished products of American Industry. In this
connection especially good reports come from
the Iron and steel industry, which has thereby
been rendered more nearly independent than
ever' before of fluctuations In domestic de
mand. The strength in values of all cereals,
all the leading breadstuff? being higher this
week is of course, due to the constant foreign
demand, mnro than effecting very large gains
in domestic supplies, which, however, are be
low any corresponding period for years past.
Comparisons of four months' exports. July to
October inclusive, point to wheat and flour
â¢hinments U'tl<- below those of last year, and
only 10 per cent below those of IS9I. the heav
iest ever known. The strength of cereals finds
imitators on coffee, where the statistical posi
tion shows some Improvement; HURar, which Is
relatively higher for refined, on growing strength
of raw supplies; coffee, which still retains its
i old bullish tone, and oven cotton, which is
I higher on small movement and improving tone
of the goods market.
Wool sales continue of good volume on more
confident buying of email manufacturers, who
however, report the finished goods trade unsat
isfactory. Heavy sales of bonded wool for re
export to England are reported this week.
Rather morp inquiry la noted for pigiron, and
the tone of prices is strong In contrast to that
of steel, which Is being shaded by those eager
i to hook new business. The steel rail situation
is apparently unchanged, and much business Is
hp'.d up awaiting settlement of price and other
details.
Wheat, including flour shipments for ' the
week, avrgreg-ate 6.679.141 bushels, against 3.
1*674 fiSS bushels lust week. 8,<83,7M bushels In
the corresponding week of 1897, 3,937.233 bushels
in 1896, 2,516,838 bushels In 1895. and 3.312,673
bushels in W4. Since July 1. this year, the ex
ports of wheat aggregate 52.589.457 bushels,
against 06,978,426 bushels' last year.
Business failures In the L'nlted States this
week number 229. as against 187 last week, 235
in this week a year ai?o. 30$ in 1896, 323 in 1896,
and 295 In IS!>4. The total number of failures
In the Dominion of Canada is 24. against 30 In
the preceding week. 31 in 1897. 47 in 1596. 42 In
1895. and 23 In 1894.

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET. m
CHICAGO, Nov. 18.â A rather weak tone was
shown by Wheat at the opening-. Reports from
Liverpool . received before the opening here
showed %@ld decline.- Argentine crop reports
were very favorable and seaboard houses re
ported email export demand. December started
*4@%c lower and May V4@Vic lower. The sell
ing pressure was not very heavy, and a mod
erate buying demand, mostly from profession
als, caused prices to slowly advance. For two
hours afterward the market was dull and In â¢
the main fairly steady. The market became
?ulte firm for a time aiter 11 o'clock. Orders
rom the outside either to buy or sell were
; few and far between, but local traders were
rather inclined to favor the buying side, es
pecially as regards December, and prices grad
ually worked upward. Half an hour from the
close the lack of local cash demand, apparent
all day, began to be appreciated and the 1 bot
tom apparently dropped out of the market.
The sudden break, however, bright in plenty
of buyers, and In the last few minutes of trad
ing prices advanced as rapidly as they had
declined. May closed at 65%@66c and Decem
ber at 66M:<366%c. . , - ,
Corn was fairly active. The market sold off
a little at ; first on the weak cables . and 'In
sympathy with Wheat, but soon became steady
and remained no for the rest of the session.
May closing a shade higher.
Oata were a little higher, but not especially
active. The firmness of Corn helped - Oats.
May closed at a shade advance over yester
day.
The market for Provisions, with the excep
tion of a few minutes around the opening, due
to sympathy â¢ with grain, was firm, > but 'de
cidedly dull. Operations were confined almost
entirely to scalpers, packers doing very little,
and price fluctuations were -narrow. At the
close January pork was 5c higher, lard 2Hc
higher and ribs unchanged. _

Justice Hard May

The parties who attached the furniture I
of Justice Hard's courtroom in Alameda j
on Wednesday last may have to pay !
heavily f'.r so doing. Not only was the
furniture attached, but the officials also
locked up the courtroom, and it is said
this is an offense against the dignity of
the State of California-
Justice Hard has stated that he will
probably bring suit for $5000 damages
against the parties responsible for the
outrage cm his temple of justice. It is
true that Justice Hard in his Alameda
court was not overburdened with business,
but the room was a bona-fide courtroom,
and as such is said to be exempt from at- :
tachment. This Is the first time in Ala- |
medrt Countyâ and perhaps in this Stateâ ,
where a courtroom has been attached and |
closed because of a personal debt of the
Justice of the Peace.
Justice Hard has had a hard time since
he was lirst appointed by the Supervisors
about six months ago to take the place qt
the aged jurist Judge Swasey. The Audi
tor's office shows that for nearly the
whole time Mr. Hard has been qu

A MARRIAGE BUREAU MATCH
ENDS DISASTROUSLY.
After a Year of Domestic Discord
George White Is Made Defend

ALAMEDA, Nov. IS.â George D. White,
an employe of. the Southern" Pacific Com- |
pany, is "firmly convinced that matches j
made' by matrimonial bureaus are not :
ho-ivling succcssesr The- -wind-up of a year
of domestic- discord is a divorce suit in j
â¢which Whit- is made defendant and his j
wife Agnes is plaintiff.
White tried matrimony back in I tan, >.
but It did hot Impress him favorably and
the nuptial knot was untied by a divorce
couri. . Ythen -he cam& ; to,Alam4da.Jie con

ferred him to a Ban Francisco marriage
bureau and there he- met his fate..
White and Agnes were married Decem- ,
ber 16 'ISS7. They worried along until
April when, according to the wife com- |
plaint. White scolded her. He did more- ;
he called her a devil and declared he was
sorry he had ever married her. In July, I
it is alleged, he told her he was going to
kill her. and made preparations to carry
out his threat, but fortunately he relented. ,
The troubles of the Whites according ,
to the wife's statements,. reached a cli
max October 22, when she suggested that
it was nearly time to purchase her a new
bonnet. He flew into a rage and choked
her. beat. her and spoiled her beauty by
plowing up her face with his finger nails.
She left, him then never to return.
The divorce complaint was served on j
White this morning. . He filed his answer \
this afternoon. He denies all his wife s
allegations except the statement that he
told her he was sorry he ever married her. ;
He says this latter assertion is true, and
he reiterates it with emphasis.

OAKLAND, Nov. 18.â The football game
between the- rival elevens of St. Mary's

tHe past month and are In the pink of

enliven the proceedings, college cries and
songs will abound and general enthusi- ;
asm prevail. - The graduates from both
institutions have been invited, and many
have signified their intention of being
present. This is the second time that the
rival players will try conclusions. As both |
trams are big, muscular fellows and even- |
ly' matched as regards weight and sci
ence, an interesting game may be expect
ed. Admission to all sections is fifty i

of Santa. Clara will ornament different j
portion of the grand stand set apart for
the wearers of the respective colors. The
game is scheduled for 2 o'clock.

suited in confirming her suspicions that
her husband was a bigamist. As near as
she was able to learn he had left the
State with his bride, and the pair were
last heard of in Chicago.
lines had not lived with his Alameda
wife since last January and had not con
tributed to her support for over two
years. In August she received a letter ;
from him stating that he had gone to ;
San Pedro to secure employment. Ames
attended a meeting of the library board
October 3, but did not call on his Ala- ;
ineda wife on that occasion.
Mrs. Ames No. 2 has decided to make
the best of a bad barKiiin and has placed i
her case In the hands of a local attorney |
to secure a divorce. She will not make a i
move to punish her erring spouse. But
Ames will not go unpunished if he can bo
located. Samuel Crooks, a brother-in-law ;
of his new wife, is hot on his trail. He
visited Alameda last night to secure cvi- I
dence against Ames to back up a charge
of bigamy, which he will nrnke against
him. j . _
Miss Skelley was a resident of San
Francisco. wh> re she resided with her pa
rents. She Was on a visit to her sister,
Mrs Crooks, at Santa Rosa when sh.- was
married to Ames. He became acquainted
with her in Snn Francisco and followed
her to Santa Rosas.
Ames was elected a library trustee about
a year ago and has tr.o years more to ,
serve. For a long period he was engineer
of tho fÂ«rry-boat Piedmont and subse
quently had charge of the power house :
of the Alamoda electric road. Ames |
friends offer as an excuse for his action
the statement that he is not in his right
mind- It has been a matter of_comment \
for a long time that he was far from raj
tional in some of his transaction*.
Two years ago Am-*' first wife and:
their son. were found sick and destitute in
an Alameda lodging house. The case was
reported to the Masons, of which Ames i
was a member, and they persuaded him to
make some provision for them. A year
aaro when the father of his Alameda wile â 
died he did not attend the funeral. This
produced much unfavorable comment
among his friends and members of the
Ma.-unic fraternity.
VAINLY PRAYED FOR
A MIND DISEASED
CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS YIELD
TO SURGEONS.
* â
Failed to Restore the Disordered
Mind of J. J. Daniels, an .
Alameda Painter.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 18. -J. J. Daniels, a|
painter, whose house is at the corner of j
Pease and Encinal avenues, was taken !
to the Receiving Hospital to-day a raving
maniac. His case demonstrates that a
disordered mind cannot be restored to a ;
healthy condition by incessant praying.
Daniels showed symptoms ot insanity
last Sunday. A local institution of Chris
tlan Scientists took exclusive charge of i
his case. William Farewell, a leading
light of the Home of Truth, prayed with
the unfortunate man morning, noon ana i
night. As Daniels had a religious mania :
the treatment was thought to be appro
priate, but as the- praying progressed the
more violent became the patient. i
Mrs Daniels had faith in Farewc'l g
treatment and firmly believed it would j
cure her husband. To-day the Christian
Scientists gave up the case, as Daniels
had become so violent none of them had
the hardihood to go near him.
Deputy Shf-rlffs William Lane and Ed
White took the man to the hospital, and :
had an exciting trip with him. He is a
very powerful man and the deputies had
all they could do to restrain him. He
twisted himself into such a shape on one j
occasion during the trip that he managed ,
to get the toe of his shoe between his
teeth 'and pulled the shop off. He then
kicked out with his shoeless foot and
struck Dave Martin, who was driving the
carriage, in the neck. >
Besides having a religious mania
Daniels imagines he is a: Russian count
and the Prince of Wales.

POLITICS AND DRINK
TOO MUCH FOR HIM
STORY OF C. F. CLARK'S DOWN-
WARD CAREER.
Once Ran for Office, but Defeat Led to
Drink, Insanity and
t Crime.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 18.
"Dr." Charles F. Clark, charged with
grand larceny for having stolen a micro
scope worth $100 from the office of Dr.
J. C. Akerly several months ago, pleaded
Kullty before Judge Ellsworth this morn
ing and will be sentenced to-morrow.
Clark is the son of a prominent Ohio
physician. He tells a strange story of
his life. After having acquired a fine
education he was made county physician
;<t his Eastern home. He next ran for
Coroner, but was defeated by eighteen
votes. His defeat led him to drink, and
he finally landed in an insane asylum
with partial paralysis. Upon his release
he started for this coast, and until a few
months prior to his latest trouble he was
cook on a vessel.
His attorney, W. H. H. Gentry, has
made an earnest plea to secure clemency
from the court, and it is likely his sen
tence will not be as severe as usual in
similar cases.
slit With a Switch Iron.
OAKLAND, Nov. 18.â James Blaker.the
young con of Charles H. Blaker, master
of the ferry steamer Piedmont and one of
the best known men on the bay, charges
John J. Conway, a streetcar conductor,
with an assault with a deadly weapon.
Conway is in the employ of the Oakland,
San Leandro and>* Haywards Electric
required to operate plain switches with,
while Blaker, though 17 years old, is a
mite of a boy for his age. The weapon
used was a swltchiron, such as earmerr
requireto operate plain switches with,
and about two and a half feet long. Tho
complaint was sworn to before Justice of
the Peace Lawrence in East Oakland,
and the accused man has been released
on $300 bail. The boy was stealing a ride
when Conway threw the iron at him.
Conway has been in the employ of the
Haywards line for some time. It is said
that he had been annoyed greatly of la-.e
by small boys jumping off and on his car
at the point in question, and that he had
been tantalized by Blaker until he could
no longer suppress his anger. The rail
way company put up the bonds for his
annearance at trial.
Lynn Was Sane.
OAKLAND, Nov. 18.â John W. Lynn
has been held to answer before the Su
perior Court to the charge of assault to
murder hia wife, whom he shot five times.
His preliminary examination was con
cluded this afternoon in the Police Court,
and his bail was lixed in the sum of $10,-
000.
Lynn's attorney. Hugh Aldrich, made a
motion for the discharge of the prisoner
on the ground that he was insane when
he shot his wife. The motion, however,
was denied.
McKeen's Election Expenses.
OAKLAND, Xov. 18.âAssemblyman
elect McKeen did not spend his campaign,
fund through his purity committee, and
this caused a report to be published that
he had not spent a cent. His purity com
mittee filed a report stating that it had
not expended any money, but Mr. Mc-
Keen has also filed one stating that he
spent $75 in a legitimate manner.
Mr. McKeen's unusual method of pay
ing campaign expenses caused the error
to be made In print.

PETERS' LIGHTS WERE
CARRIED INBOARD
COULD BE HIDDEN FROM VIEW
BY PASSENGERS.
Investigation Into the Bay Collision
Concluded and Case Submitted.
Decision in Ten Days.
The official investigation into the recent '
bay collision between the steamers Peters i
; and Czarina was concluded yesterday ;
J afternoon by Inspectors Bolles and Bui- ;
i ger and the case was submitted. Clement :
! Bennett, who was sworn in as United
States stenographer, will now transcribe i
j the evidence which will cover several j
i hundred typewritten pages. The inquiry' :
has been an exhaustive one and has been
conducted with as much dignity as a ju- !
dicial trial. The inspectors will render a
decision as to where the blame lies in
about ten days.
Chief Engineer David N. Miller of the '
Peters was the first witness on the stand
yesterday. He testified that when the
collision occurred he was coming out of ,
the Chinese steerage, having left Assist
ant Engineer Beare in charge of the en
gines a short time befure. Miller had
gone below to inspect the electric light
plant, as the lights on the Peters were
not burning as brightly as usual. He said :
his assistant, Beare, had no right to leave j
the throttle of his engine as he had testi
fied he had done. Miller said he bad
sometimes left the electrician of the
steamer to mind the engines, when he
(Miller) had other work to do. The elec
trician Is not a licensed officer. If the en
giiu-.< stopped the lights would go out. |
and if they slowed up the lights would
diminish In brilliancy, as the dynamos
were run by the engines. Ho thought the j
drowned Chinamen had ample timr to get :
out of the steerage, as he warned them at
least two minutes before the vessels came
together.
Captain Houldsworth of the Peters was
recalled and made the startling admission
that the side lights on his boat were car- '
ried inboard three feet above the hurri
cane deck and were liable to be obstruct
ed from view by the passengers who used j
the hurricane deck forward as a prome
nade. He did not know whether they â¢
were so obstructed on the night of the ;
disaster. He could not state the approxl
mate damage sustained by the Peters and
had not vet made a wreck report.
Captain Seaman said that in his report,
filed with the Custom-house, he had
placed the damage to the Czarina at
$10,000.

A Contract Laborer.
T'nlted States Immigration Commis
sioner North yesterday refused a land
ing to a contract laborer named Michele
Curto who came hither from British
Columbia under contract to work in the
Utica mine of Angels Camp, in Calaver
as County, for $40 per month. Curto made
a statement to Immigration Inspector
Geffeney to the effcet that he was 27
years old, a native of Italy, and had been
working in a coal mine at Comox, B. C.
He admitted he was under contract to
work in the Utlca mine at $40 per month,

THE WISCONSIN'S PLACE
TO BE TAKEN BY OHIO
BRIGHT PROSPECTS AT THE
UNION IRON WORKS.
Irving M. Scott Personally Superin
tends the Launching Arrange
ments of the Battleship
Next Saturday.
There is a* bright prospect for the me
chanics and other workmen at the Union
Iron Works for the next two years. Just
as soon as the Wisconsin is launched
next Saturday morning the Ohio will be
started on the same slip. Yesterday
Irvir.-r ML Scott personally superintended
the laying of the ways under the Wis
consin's keel over which she will glide
into the waters of the bay at 9:30 o'clock
next Saturday morning.
The Ohio will be the largest vessel ever
built on the Pacific Coast, her tonnage
will he 12,500, 1000 tons in excess of that
of tho Wisconsin and 2000 more than the
Oregon; her length will be twenty feet
more than the Wisconsin, while the draft
â twenty-three feetâ is the same. The
Wisconsin is expected to make sixteen
knots;, wehreas the Ohio will have to make
eighteen before her acceptance by the
Government.
On slip Xo. 2, where Admiral Dewey's
flagship, the Olympia, and the San Fran
cisco were built, the keel of the Wyoming
will be laid as soon as Irving M. Scott
receives official instructions from the
Navy Department in Washington re
garding the contemplated change of plans
In the construction of the vessel. In ad
dition to these two vessels the nion Iron
Works lms contracts for quite a number
of smalli-r craft for the United States
Government, among whichare the Prehle,
Paul Jones and Perry, three torpedo
boats of 400 tons capacity.

JONES CAN'T SUE
FOR DAMAGES
CHINESE Interpreter David D. Jones Is an injured man, hut It has
been both his good fortune and his bad fortune to have profited and
not to have profited by his injury. This paradoxical condition
of affairs was brought about by the recent accident to Mr. Jones, an
account of which was published in the newspapers a few days ago. An
iron picKet from a cornice railing fell upon his head and lacerated his
skull. It was a glancing blow, and its force was deadened by the stiff
Derby hat he wore, otherwise he would have been instantly killed.
Previous to the accident, which deprived him of about half a pint of
rich Welsh blood, he had been feeling heavy and out of sorts for weeks.
For months past all his spare time had been occupied in the perfecting
of a system of shorthanding the Chinese characters. His physician had
advised him to take a rest, his arduous labors and overstudy having
brought about a congestive tendency in the head. Jones could not afford
to take a rest unless his landlord and his butcher and baker and grocer
did the same, the smallness of his salary being more than compensated
for by the largeness of his family.
But the blood-letting proved to be better than a vacation. After spend
ing a few days in bed under the care of a surgeon, Mr. Jones returned
to his rfuty as bright as a summer morning. All the old congestive symp
toms had vanished and he declared that he felt twenty years younger.
"I can't recover damages against the owner of the building," said the In
terpret er. "because he could prove that I was benefited at least $5000 by
the bleeding, and because the only damage 1 sustained was a broken
Derby hat and a doctor's bill. He has paid the doctor'B bill and the price
of a new hat, and that's all I wanted."
Monday. These boxes will be under the
direct supervision of Chief Lees and will
be opened only by his agents. The
proceeds of the boxes will be de
voted to the free bed fund of four
local hospitalsâ the Home for Incurables,
the Hospital for Children, the California
Women's Hospital and the Mount Zion
Hospital. For some time the management
of the hospitals has maintained its free
beds with much difficulty, and this means
of relief will doubtless meet with libtfal
public patronage. Special collections were
taken up in all the churches in San Fran
cisco last Sunday for this purpose, and
two churches which have already reported
have handed over $200.
Culver's New Calendar.
R. K. Culver, a former member of Ihe
Call's art staff, has added to his rapidly
Increasing reputation as an artist by the
production of a unique calendar for 1899.
The calendar represents the various con
ditions of the college chap during the
various months of the year, and is pre
pared in a style peculiar to Mr. t ulver,
which attracts for the artist much praise.
A little over a year ago the gentleman
severed his connection with The Call and j
resumed his studies at Stanford Univers- j
ity, taking a. complete course in the art I
school at that place.
Whist Tournament.
A preparatory tournament to the fifth
annual meeting- of the Pacific Coast Whist
Association will be held in this city Friday
and Saturday, November 25 and 26, In the
rooms of the San Francisco Whist Club,
326 Post street, and the Trist Duplicate
Whist Club, 711 Jones street. There will
be eight contests, and on Saturday even
ing the San Francisco Whist Club will
give its regular monthly reception. Prizes
will be awarded the winners of each con
test, and all matches are to be played
under the new code of laws governing
duplicate whist.

FAST VENTORO WINS AGAIN
MARPLOT CAPTURES ANOTHER
PURSE.
Bernardlllo Finished in Front of His
Fieldâ Pat Morrissey's Ad
mirers in Clover â Cabrillo
Was Beaten,
Good prices were obtainable against the
different winners at Ingleside track yes
terday, but the coin seems so Irretriev
ably pocketed that the ring made Instead
of losing money. Three of six choices
won, but they were lost sight of in the
rush to get aboard what the wise set were
playing.
In the opening event for two-year-olds,
Ventoro, on his recent runs, looked the
best, but his odds drifted back from 3
to 2 to 5 to 2 and higher. With Eddie
Jones on his back, he made all the run
ning, and won at case from LoÂ« Medanos.
It got about that it was the day for
Espionage, and there was a stiff play on
Ezell's filly. She finished fourth, behind
the outsider Casdale.
The original second race was declared
off and a seven furlong selling affair sub
stituted. The crowd settled on Lost Girl
as the probable winner, but she seemed
unequal to the task with Bullman in the
points. The uncertain Marplot, against
which the ring laid 6 and 7 to 1. got
through next the rail at the head of the
stretch, winning leisurely from Judga
Stouffer.
The mile and a quarter run was some
thing In the nature of a cake walk for
Bernardillo, ridden by E. Jones. The
hooded horse cut out the pace, and hav
ing nothing to beat, galloped In two
lengths before Personne in 2:05 ! ,4. Red
Glenn found the route too far.
Dan Honig's black sprinter Ed Gartland
at last managed to get away from the
post in the front file, and made a gallop j
of the five furlong scramble. '"Skeets ' |
Martin had the leg up and experienced no â¢
difficulty in beating Toribio, the nearest
neighbor. First Call, which was played
down from 15 to 7, was cut off soon after
the start, but finished well, securing the
show. I
Eddie Jones won his third race astride |
Pat Morrissey in the fifth event, a six
furlong spin. Thirteen to five was chalked j
against the gelding, and jumping away
ahead of his field at the start, won all
the way. Imperious experienced no diffi
culty in taking the show from Colonel
Dan. Our Climate, the favorite, was slow
to break, and never looked dangerous.
It looked as if Cabrillo had struck his
Class in the final mile run, decided under ;
selling conditions, and was installed a 6 j
to 5 choice. Jones hustled him away In j
front and the bay horse ran flatteringly
for nearly six furlongs, when he began ]
to back up. Stepabout. in first position
after a quarter had been covered, then,
won cleverly from the late comer, Tom
Calvert.
Track Notes.
The Baldwin yearlings will be sold at
the Occidental Horse Exchange to-night.
Charley Thorpe was a spectator at the
track yesterday. He will probably be
seen In the saddle again to-day, as his
wife, who has been lying dangerously ill
at Sacramento, now shows signs of im
provement.
Eddie Jones appears to be regaining his
old form. If he continues riding as he did
yesterday, popularity will quickly be his
again. His handling of Ventoro, Bernar

tioned at Bakoor, a telegraph station
across the bay from Manila. The fol
lowing interesting extracts have been
made from his letter:
We are expecting orders to move to
Manila, but if they never come we will
be better satisfied; for the first time since
the organization of our regiment it is
satisfied to remain where it it rather
than move on. Some of the men haw
wonderfully changed their tuns, and
about 600 of them would give what they
have left of a month's pay to be back in
San Francisco digging their toes into the
sand.
A great many have had malaria, and
about 15 per cent are on the sick repeat,
but there is nothing serious tho matte:
with them and we have had no deaths
here that can be attributed to the cli
mate.
Talk about a lot of sick schoolgirl,
they are not in with the stalwart moun
taineer^ if the mail doesn't bring just me
right kind of letters.
As far as I am personally concerned, if
my good health continues, I would not
object to a full term of enlistment in this
place. If we can stay here it is better
than being in Manila. We ar<; the oniy
infantrymen here, and have our Gaily
battalion and regimental drills, and the
command is pretty well in hand. It is
cooler here, too, than in Manila. We are
Letv/een two small bays and if there is
any wind Mowing we get it.
On the 29th of last month I was de
tailed summary court by the colonel. This
corresponds with a civil police judge. At
first business was light, but then came
payday, and the court is now making lots
of money for Uncle disposed of
twenty-five cases in one hour Tuesday.
The Filipinos are getting even on the
Spanish prisoners for all that Spain ever
did to them. 1 have seen some that are
walking skeletons. The insurgents send
them to small towns and turn them
loose. The natives are hostile to them,
and the result is slow starvation. Over
in Bakoor, a telegraph station between
here and Manila, were fourteen of these
prisoners when I was there and one of
the men in the station told me there had
been quite a number starved to death.
They gave one of these unfortunates a
piece of bread one day; he sat down to
eat It, when a native took it away from
him. Some of the most prosperous na
tives feed them for their services.
Bakoor Is Aguni Agulnaldo's head
quarters and was bombarded for thirty
months by the Spanish. We met and
had quite a visit with Gomez, one of the
insurgent leaders. He speaks good Eng
lish and impressed me favorably.
The thermometer hanging indoors
registers from 80 to 84 degrees night and
day, rarely higher or lower. The days
are short and nights long. It is dark at
6:30 in the afternoon and hardly daylight
at 5:30 in the morning.
In the mail which arrived on the Ari
zona yesterday there are evidences of the
kickerâ the kicker that swells with self
importance when he can find a paper yel
.low enough to publish his â and the
strange part of it to me is the fact that
papers encourage such stuff. They will
send broadcast reports almost libelous in
character against men who stand high, in
their own communities and create or at
tempt to create an impression that many
of our commanding officers are second
only to the inhuman Spaniards in the
treatment of their men. Some of tne at
tacks upon Colonel Kessler are , out
rageous. One report from Honolulu stated
that he had remained in his stateroom,
utterly ignoring the wants and necessities
of the men, and finally Colonel Wallace
came to the rescue. The colonel com
manding, like some eight or ten hundred
of the kickers on board the Pennsylvania,
is possessed of a stomach that is not proof
against seasickness, and for the first few
days he was necessarily confined to his
stateroom, while the more fortunate lieu
tenant colonel and the majors escaped
entirely. , ...
To feed 1400 men upon a vessel with
cooking capacity for 900 is quite a prob
lem, and it could not be worked out with
satisfaction to all the first week out from
port. The steamship company agreed to
do the cooking for all, and It was reason
able to suppose that they knew what
they were undertaking, as It wai directly
in their line, and they received something
over $800 upon arrival here just for that
work. Of course it was soon apparent
that they could not handle it. so a detail
was made from the command to assist in
the kitchen. Night cooks were put into
the kitchen and the men made to cut up
meat, pare potatoes and onions and po
lice the boat. When the men recovered
their appetites â¢ they were not satisfied
with the regular rations, and upon a
number of occasions the men clamored
for more to eat, and Colonel Kessler or
dered it cooked for them, and. he had to
pay for the excess himself. Not only that
some of ti.e company commanders re
fused to pay the steamer cooks the sbcty
three cents per man for the trip agreed
upon and Colonel Kessler had to put up
for that, too. You know a trip of that
kind is hard under ordinary conditions,
and upon a troopship it Is bound to.be
much harder. When the system was
finally mastered the food began to taste
of the ship and the men were tired of
Government rations, and the kicking
continued. I read some of the kicks
from the troops at Tampa and do not
sympathize with them at allâ they are all
kickers alike. I am glad to say that the
men that have been accustomed to living
well in private life were the last to com
plain. - " ' ' "
UNDESIRABLE CONTRACTORS.
Building Trades Council to Make a
Fight Against Certain Mill-
Owners.
The Building Trades Council has a knife
out for mill-owners who have been taking
contracts for outside work and breaking
the trade regulations.
The legitimate contractors only work
their men eight hours a day, but in mills
all men work nine hours. It was re
ported at last night's meeting of the
council that James Young, who owns a
mill at Howard and Folsom streets, had
mill at Beale and Mlssioin streets, had
taken a contract and was working his
own millhands nine hours a day on the
job. The matter will be brought to the
attention of the contractors In the Build
ers' Exchange to-day, and their assist
ance will be asked in the systematic fight
which the council will wage against this
class of bidders.
Plans for the Charity Bazaar.
A meeting was held Thursday afternoon
by the promoters of the Charity Bazaar
to be /conducted at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion from December 1 to December 29
for the benefit of the charity institutions
and orphan aeylums of San Francisco.
Representatives of twenty-five organiza
tions were present and the plans to be
adopted by the management, after hav
ing been outlined by L. H. Bonestell, were
heartily indorsed by them. The proposi
tion is to rent space in the building to the
different merchants of the city and to ex
act from them 10 per cent or their gross
sales in addition to one-half of the gate
receipts. This sum will be devoted to
charity. A similar bazaar conducted In
.New York City realized $100,000. and an
other held in Chicago was most success
ful. The leading navaJ and army com
manders have extended their patronage,
as have prominent officials of this city
and State. Each night there will be a
grand musical contest, and for the suc
cessful contestant Mayor Phelan has or
fered a trophy worth "SISOO.

her second appearance in her battle for a
red, legally due the petitioner by reason
of the fact that she was the legal wife
and is now the legal widow of James U.
Fair, deceased. . , tn
When the petition was presented to
Judge Belcher yesterday afternoon that
jurist was requested to make an order lor
service on all parties Interested and to set
a date upon which those parties could
show cause, if so they could legally do
why the prayer of the petitioner should not
be granted. This Judge Belcher refused
to do, stating that inasmuch as the Cra
ven-Fair contest had occupied the atten
tion of Department 10 of the Superior
Court since its filing he did not feel justi
fied in making the order. In consequence
the petition cannot be placed on file untU
the 28th lnst. Judge Troutt, who presides
in Department 10, will return from a visit
in the country on that date and the case
will be formally opened before him. \\ .
\V Foote and Denson. Oatman & Denson,
of counsel for Mrs. Craven, are unable to
explain the action of Jud^e Belcher in re
fusing to grant the order requested, it
was simply a formal matter, they say,
and Juri.ire Belcher had no more authority,
considering the absence of Judge Troutt,
to refuse to Issue the order than his clerk
would to refuse to file the petition if pre
sented to him with the proper fee.
The petition of Mrs. Craven for a
family allowance from the estate of her
alleged deceased husband is made under
certain sections of the code providing for
an allowance to a surviving widow for her
support and maintenance during the prog
ress i if the settlement of the estate of her
husband. The petitioner first sets forth
that James G. Fair died in this city and
county on the 2Sth day of December, 1894,
leaving an alleged last will and testament.
Snch alleged will was duly admitted to
probate on November 16. 1896. By the pro
visions of the will W. S. Goodfellow, Jas.
S. Angus and Thomas G. Crothers were
named executors thereof. Letters testa
mentary in the matter of the estate of the
deceased were duly issued them and they
ever since have been and now are the duly
appointed, qualified and acting executors
of the alleged will and testament of the
deceased.
Mrs. Craven then avers that she Is
the surviving wife and widow of James G.
Fair, and continues by stating "that the
estate of James G. Fair, as she is in
formed and believes, is of the value of
$12,228,998 07, or thereabouts; that the an
nual rents, issues and profits of the said
estate are, as she is informed and be
lieves, over and above the sum of $500,000."
"No allowance whatever of said es
tate has been made to her as the surviv
ing wife and widow for her support and
maintenance during the progress of the
Bettlement of said estate: that the sum of
JSGOO a month would be and is a reason
able allowance out of the estate to be
made to her as such surviving wife and
widow for her support and maintenance
during the progress of the settlement of
said estate."
The petitioner further represents that
any allowance that may be made by the
court or Judge thereof, in accordance
with the prayer of the petition, should be
made to take effect from the 28th day of
December, 1894, the date of the death of
her alleged husband.
The document Is signed Xettie R. Fair,
and she is referred to by that name all
through.
The filing of the petition for an allow
ance for maintenance from the estate of
James G. Fair, as stated by Mr. Foote, Is
a method taken advantage of to expe
dite the settleent of Mrs. Craven's
claims against tne estate. When the pe
tition is heard Mrs. Craven's opponents â
those interested in the estate left by the
millionaire â will doubtless vigorously
oppose the granting of the allowance.
This will give tho petitioner an oppor
tunity to present her proofs that she is,
as she claims to be, the legal widow of
the deceased by virtue of a contract
marriage. This Mrs. Craven is confident
she can establish, and an Interesting as
well as bitter contest is expected.
The lengthy legal battle waged over the
so-called pencil deeds, conveying proper
ty to the claimant, which was decided
against Mrs. Craven In the Superior Court,
is now under consideration by the Su
preme Court. An appeal was taken from
the judgment of the lower court and in
event the judgment is reversed Mrs.
Craven's attorneys wfph to be in a posi
tion to press all claims without delay.
Mrs. Craven was in St. Louis when her
attorneys concluded to take this last step
in her behalf. She was sent for and came
immediately to this city, where, in all
probability, she will remain until she has
conquered or all hopes of victory have
vanished.

The gift to Mr. Lloyd is a most beauti
ful production of the jeweler's art. It is
nearly five inches in length and more than
half as wide. In shape it resembles the
"Cross of Salem," with a groundwork of
solid gold. The centerpiece is a Maltese
cross of gold. In the middle of which is a
beautiful diamond. Surrounding the Malt
ese cross is a ring, the entire circle of
which is set with smaller diamonds. Near
the middle of each arm of the crosses are
raised ornaments of gold studded with
one medium sized diamond and several
smaller gems of the same kind. The
medal Is suspended by a Bilk ribbon, whioh
Is attached to a shield that holds the pin
by which the jewel is fastened to the coat.
Across the face of this golden shield is
written the word "California." Upon the
reverse side of the gift are the words,
"Presented to Most Eminent Sir Reuben
Hedley Lloyd by the Knights Templar of
California. November 18, 1898."
WHY ROOSEVELT WON.
Gherardi Davis Gives Some Interest
ing Information Concerning
the Election in New York.
In an interview at the Palace last even
ing Gherardi Davis gave some Interesting
particulars concerning the recent elec
tion In New York State â of whose Legis
lature he is a member.
"For the last few years," he said, "the
Bar Association, organized about the time
of the Tweed Impeachments, has taken
more interest than usual in judicial nomi
nations; and this year it recommended
the renomlnation of Judge Daly, a Demo
crat who had been on the bench for
twenty-eight years. The Republicans re
nominated him. but Tammany refused to
do so; and the issue was made by the
Bar Association that Daly was turned
down by Croker, because he would not
appoint a Tammany man in place of an
old and very efficient clerk. The com
mittee of One Hundred was almost en
tirely made up of Democratic lawyers.
At a meeting they held in Carnegie Hall
Bourke Cochran made a magnificent
speech on this issue; and, as a result,
Daly ran ahead of all the Republican
nominees.
"One very unfortunate thing: We lost
every Republican Congressman in ftew
York City and Brooklynâ seven all toldâ
and Tammany carried all Its Judges. VV c
elected a Republican Legislature, how
ever, in both branches. And we elected
our entire State ticket in spite of the
very large Democratic majority in Greater
New York. That means that we shall
elect a Republican Senator in place of
Murphy." ...
"How about the gubernatorial contest?
"Roosevelt's Integrity and txce'.lent char
acter were very strong factors in obtain
ing votes for him from all parties. In
our Assembly district he got a very large
number of independent votes from men
who had faith in him on acount of his
splendid political record. His absolute
honesty is never questioned; and he got
even- Republican vote in the Stateâ and a
good many Democratic ones besides.
"We certainly made a very active cam
paign all over the State and the results
showed. I think, that the people of the
State at large still have entire confidence

LIEUT. BENNETT'S REPORT.
General Merriam Will Use Discretion
in Making Its Contents Public.
Lieutenant John B. Bennett completed
his report on the Fort Baker scandals
yesterday, and It will be placed in the
possession of General Merriam to-day.
The contents of the report is unknown
and every avenue of information is being
guarded, so it will not become public
matter until the general examines it and
decides upon its disposition.
It is deemed useless to send any more
cavalrymen to the Philippines as they
cannot be accomi.anied by horses and
must do regular infantry service. They

lime. Schell to Appear in This City.
Mme. Schell, the famous European
Hem tamer, will appear with her lions
at Glen Park, the Mission Zoo, on Sun
day.
Mme. Schell is one of the most suc
cessful lion tamers of modern times
and the daring of this little woman and
the performance of her three ferocious
lions excels anything of a like charac
ter ever before exhibited in public.
Professor Raymous, the champion
high diver of the world, will be one of
the other attractions at Glen Park on

Runaway Car on Ellis Street.
A car on the Ellis-street line dashed
over five blocks from Devisadero street
to Stelner, absolutely beyond control, last
Thursday evening. The momentum of the
car increased â with the distance, and the
track being slippery from the fog prevent
ed the brakes from performing 1 their func
tion. The motorman attempted to reverse
the car, but the trolley had jolted from
the wire and he was powerless until the
car reached Steiner street, where the road
is more level, and the car slowed up of its
own accord. An exciting condition pre
vailed. Men jumped from the swaying car
and women fainted. The trolley pole cut
many of the wires overhead as it plowed
its way along, and the path of the car
was covered with broken glass from the
windows.
Fortunately there were few-- people on
the streets which were passed, and no
collision occurred.

Attempted Suicide of

MARY SCHUTTER'S WOES
JUMPED IN THE BAY, BUT "WAS
BESCUED.
Deserted by Her Husband, She Made
a Determined Attempt to
End Her Exist
ence.
Penniless and hungry,- Mary Schutter.
a middle-aged woman, late yesterday
afternoon attempted to end her exist
ence by jumping in the bay at the foot
of Buchanan street. She was rescued
by a boatman. In the boat at the time
was a real estate dealer named Ker
win, who, after listening to her sad
story, gave her $2 50. He also gave the
unfortunate woman his business ad
dress and told her to call upon him
whenever she lacked sufficient money
to get something to eat.
Kerwin telephoned for the Receiving
Hospital ambulance and the woman
was removed to the hospital.
To the matron the unfortunate woman
said she was tired of living and wanted
to die. â¢
"1 wa* married some time ago, she
tearfully remarked, "and as my hus
band did not treat me properly 1 deter
mined to leave him. Atter cc-nsider
able trouble I procured work as a do
mestic, but being sick and despondent
I resolved to commit suicide. About a
month ago I jumped in the bay off
Howard-street wharf, but was rescued
by a policeman, who had been watch
ing me for some time, evidently divin
ing my intention.
"About 8 o'clock yesterday morning
I went to the foot of Buchanan street,
determined that the second attempt at
suicide would not be a failure. There
were a number of people present, and
rather than take a chance on making
the second failure I sat down, anxiously
waiting an opportunity to jump in the
bay. I had not eaten anything since
the night previous and was almost
famished. After awaiting my chance
all day the opportunity arrived shortly
after 5 o'clock. As soon as the visitors
disappeared I threw off ray hat and
coat and Jumped into the water.
"Just as I was losing consciousness
I felt somebody grab me by the hair
and realized I was being dragged into
a boat. In a short time I recovered
consciousness, and was surprised to
find myself lying on the sandy shore
with two men standing over me fran
tically endeavoring to revive me.
"The real estate dealer, after I told
him I was hungry, gave me $2 50, after
kindly offering to do- all in his power to
assist me in procuring employment.
The water was so cold that I do not
think I will again attempt to commit
suicide In that way."
