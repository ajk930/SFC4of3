MANILA, July 17, via Hongkong,
July 21.- -The rebels attacked the Span
sh outposts in force on Friday. The
tack was simultaneous on Malate,
Santa Ava, Santa Mesa, Balic and Ga
galamerin. It is said that 20,000 rebels
engaged in the assault The result was
favorable to the Spaniards, who held all
positions with only fifty killed and
wounded. It is estimated the rebel
losses were 400. The rebels tried to
rush the trenches, which were well
protected. The Spaniards kept up a
steady fire, and repulsed every attack
of the rebels. The attack was repeat
edly renewed and lasted several hours.
The attack was renewed this morning
with the usual result.
News of the loss of Cervera's fleet, which was brought by
a Japanese warship, caused a great panic here. It had been
preached from every pulpit and announced officially here that
the arrival of Cervera's and Camara's fleets with troops was
near.
The discovery of this fraud will have a bad effect on the
Spanish troops, who are already disheartened and consider the
game hopeless. The food supply holds out, but the quality is
bad. The meat is mostly horseflesh. The poorer classes are
eating rats and dogs. The public health is fairly good.
The pumping station of the waterworks has been taken by
the rebels, but the tanks are still held by the Spaniards. The
water is turned on for two hours daily in Manila. A week's sup
ply only remains in the tanks.
Reinforcements for the Americans have arrived, but there
are no signs of an immediate American attack on Manila.
Aguinaldo has appointed native government officers in the.
province, who are collecting taxes.
ILOILO'S GOVERNOR
ALL READY TO SAIL

HONGKONG, July 21.â The trade
still continues in hemp and sugar be
tween here and Iloilo. The British
steamer Sung Kinng, which arrived to
day, reports that several thousand
rebels are lurking in the hills behind
Cavite awaiting the American signal to
swoop down on the city of Manila. The
Governor has a launch with steam up,
ready to escape at the first sign from the
American ships.
BATTLESHIP OREGON
MAY GO TO MANILA
NEW YORK, July 21.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Rear Ad
miral Dewey's force in Manila Bay
may be reinforced by a battle-ship to
be detached fn>m the Eastern squad
ron, and the protected cruiser Phila
delphia. I was told to-day on excellent
authority that Secretary Long has such
action under consideration, but whether
it will be taken or not depends upon
the events of the next few weeks. The
.Secretary feels sure that Admiral
Dewey should have a stronger squad-
Ron, one of the vessels of which should
be a battle-ship, probably the Oregon,
and he proposes to place him in a posi
tion to successfully meet any emer
gency that may arise. Commodore
Watson's squadron will be ordered In
readiness to reinforce Dewey if a third
power should menace American inter
ests.

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1898.
BRIGADIER GENERAL FRANCIS V. GREENE, U. S. A., IN COMMAND
OF THE SECOND EXPEDITION TO THE PHILIPPINES.
In Speaking of General Greene, Previous to That Officer's Departure for Manila, General Merritt
said: "General Greene Goes as My Special Representative. He Is Familiar With All My
Plans and Is Thoroughly Qualified to Take Charge of Military Affairs Upon His Arrival.
He Is an Able and Accomplished Officer."
AMERICANS MAY ATTACK
MANILA AT ANY HOUR
Transports of the Second Expedition Have Arrived.
Four Deaths on the Voyage â Fifty In
surgents Slaughtered.
CAVITE, July 17 (via Hongkong, July 21). â The long expected
attack on Manila may be made at any hour. The second expe
dition on transports China, Zealandia, Colon and Senator arrived
here to=day (July 17) under convoy of the cruiser Boston.
Lieutenant Lagelle of the Eighteenth Regiment, regulars,
died of measles after leaving Honolulu. Three men also died on
the transports.
â¢ The second expedition will be landed on the Manila side of
the bay, close to the insurgent lines and south of Malate. Dis
embarkation will begin to-morrow. It is probable the entire First
Brigade will be taken to the same place with General Greene in
command.
It is reported fifty insurgents were slain in an attack upon
Malate to-day. They were hemmed in by the Spaniards in mak
ing a charge and slaughtered to the last man. General Aguin
aldo has moved his headquarters to Bacor, removing a portion
of the Spanish prisoners from Cavite to provide accommo
dation for the American reinforcements.
The second expedition hoisted the American flag on Wake
Island on the way over.
have gone before, that affairs are quiet
i and satisfactory. l'he State Depart
ment has come to have fully as great
i a sense of appreciating Admiral
I Dewey's diplomatic ability as the coun-
I try has for his naval skill and cour
\ age, and the best evidence of this is that
I it has not found it necessary up to this
point to intervene in any way, either
to protect or to amend his works.
The Navy Department has now dis
covered that the big double turreted
monitor Monterey will not arrive at
Cavite until August 5, that being the
advice received at the department from
the captain of the vessel when she
j touched at Honolulu. The admiral's
I announcement of the arrival of the
second detachment of United States
i troops at Cavite has given great com
! fort to the War Department, which
was not altogether at ease concerning
i the first small expedition lying between
I Spaniards and the Insurgents and
without being able to depend very
largely upon either. With these added
troops it will now be possible to de
mand the surrender of Manila^ but it
is gathered here that our purpose is to
defer such a movement until all the
United States troops now afloat have
arrived in Manila Bay, unless the at
titude of the insurgent forces prompt
earlier action on the part of the Ameri
can commanders, military and naval.
AGUINALDO ORGANIZES
A PHILIPPINE CABINET
HONGKONG, July 21.â Letters re
ceived here from Cavlte, dated July 17,
say that General Aguinaldo has organ
ized the Philippine Cabinet at Bakor,
with the following personnel:
President of the Council, General
Aguinaldo.
Secretary of War. Baldimiro Aguinal
do, nephew of General Aguinaldo.
Secretary of the Interior, Leander
Ibarla.
Secretary of State, Mariano Trias.
A Spanish steamer, the Vosoie, hav
ing on board a native crew from the
Vizcaya Islands, southerners, is now
in the hands of the Insurgents. The
crew revolted, killed the Spanish offi
cers and reached Tayabao, in the south
ern part of the island of Luzon, but
there they quarreled with Tagalon in
surgents and returned to Hollo, which
is looked upon as indicating that the
Vizcayas are unwilling to join the Tag
alonls. In any case, it is considered
certain that the Philippine Islands will
never be amalgamated and that they
will never return to Spanish rqle.
Therefore the only alternative, in the
opinion of the Informed people here, is
for foreign, rule, American or British.
GARCIA'S
RETIREMENT
ANNOUNCED
Probably a f^use of trje
General to Gain
Sympathy.
It Is Supposed That \\e Is Planning
to Prove That Cubans Are
Good Soldiers. ;â¢
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 20.â General Garcia sent the fol
lowing letter to General Shafter:
"Sirâ On May 12 the Government of the Republic of Cuba
ordered me, as commander of the Cuban army in the east, to co
operate -with the American army, following the plans and obeying
the orders of its commander. I have done my best, sir, to fulfill
the wishes of my Government, and I have been until now one of
your most faithful subordinates, honoring myself in carrying out
your orders and instructions, as far as my powers have allowed
me to do it. The city of bantiago surrendered to the American
army, and news of that important event was given to me by per
sons entirely foreign to your staff. I have not been honored with
a single word from yourself, informing me about the negotiations
for peace or terms of capitulation by the Spaniards. The impor
tant ceremony of the surrender of the Spanish army and taking
possession of the city by yourself took place later on, and I only
knew of both events by public reports.
"I was neither honored, sir, with a kind word from you, in
viting myself or any officer of my staff to represent the Cuban
army on the memorable occasion. Finally, I know you have left
in power at Santiago the same Spanish authorities, whom for
three years I have fought â enemies of the independence of Cuba.
I beg to state that these authorities have never been elected to
govern Santiago by residents of the city, but were appointed by
royal decrees of the Queen of Spain.
"I would nave agreed, sir, that the army under your com
mand should have taken possession of the city, garrison and
forts. I would have given my warm co-operation to any meas
ure you may have deemed best under American military law to
hold the city for your army and to preserve public order until
the time comes to fulfill the solemn pledge of the people of the
United States to establish in Cuba a free and independent gov
ernment, but when the question arises of appointing Spanish au
thorities in Santiago de Cuba, under the peculiar circumstances of
our thirty years' strife against Spanish rule, I cannot se^ but
with deepest regret that such authorities are not elected by the
Cuban people, but are the same ones selected by the Queen of
Spain, and hence are ministers to defenu, against the Cubans,
Spanish sovereignty.
"A rumor too absurd to be believed, general, ascribes the
reason of your measures and of the orders forbidding my army
to enter Santiago to a fear of massacres and revenge against the
Spaniards. Allow me, sir, to protest against even the shadow of
such an idea. We are not savages, ignoring the rules of civil
ized warfare. We are a poor, ragged army, as ragged and as
poor as was the army of your forefathers in their noble war for
independence, but. as did the heroes of Santiago and Yorktown,
we respect too deeply our cause to disgrace it with barbarism
and cowardice.
"In view of all these reasons, I sincerely regret to be una
ble to fulfill any longer the orders of my Government, and
therefore I have tendered to-day to the commander-in-chief of the
Cuban army, Major General Maximo Gomez, my resignation as
commander of this section of our army. Awaiting his resolution
I withdraw with my forces to the interior. Very respectfully
yours, CALIXTO GARCIA."

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 20, by The Call Herald dis
patch boat to Port Antonio, Jamaica, July 21. â General Ca
lixto Garcia, in charge of the Cuban forces in the operations
about Santiago, to-day notified General Shafter that he had
tendered his resignation as commander of the insurgents in the
eastern department. This action on the part of General Garcia
is regarded as a ruse, and it is believed to have as its object the
drawing of a vote of confidence from the leaders of the Cuban
Junta.
That General Garcia has not seriously
retired from the Cuban army is dis
closed by the fact that he has just
agreed with General Castillo to march
their Cuban forces against Holguin,
and that both Garcia and Castello have
joined in a request to General Gomez
to unite with them in driving the Span
iards out of all other provinces prior to
an American attack on Havana.
General Garola's troops have been
withdrawn to the mountains. I am able
to give the true reasons for this deter
mination to no longer co-operate with
the American forces. The Cuban gen
eral in this instance took this action
while piqued over General Shafter's
refusal to let the Cubans enter Santi
ago. But he seems to have felt even
more keenly the contempt in which his
command is being held by the soldiers
of the United States. Garcia and his
principal officers seem to thorougnly
realize that the Cubans had not shone
brilliantly as warriors in the Santiago
campaign. He now intends to act In
dependently and demonstrate to the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
United States that Cubans are worthy
of confidence and respect as allies.
The American troops look upon the
Cubans as persons more fond of flesh
pots than of feats of arms. It Is an
nounced to-day that Generals Garcia
and Castillo are marching toward Hol
guin.
A serious question has arisen relative
to the collection of custom duties in
the new American port of Santiago.
When the captains of several American
vessels attempted to land their car
goes they were informed they could
proceed with the work only after pay
ing duties. These charges are the
same as under Spanish rule, and were
so high that they formed one of the
Cubans' main reasons for rebelling.
The American captains found them
selves called upon to pay an average
of 100 per cent ad valorem on ordinary
necessities, and appealed to General
Shafter. This appeal was without re
sult. Drafts were refused in pay
ment, gold being demanded, though
none is to be had, and business affairs
are In a chaotic condition.2
GENERAL MILES LEADS THE
TROOPS AGAINST PORTO RICO
MILITARY
EXPEDITION
UNDER WAY
Ample Naval Protection
of the Transports
Furnished.
Commaoding Officer Will Reach
His Destination Sunday, and
Plenty of Soldiers Will
Follow.
A
WASHINGTON, July 21.â General Miles, leading the
military expedition against Porto Rico, started at 3 o'clock this
afternoon from Siboney, Cuba, for the point on the island of
Porto Rico where it is the intention that the troops shall land.
It is expected Uiat General Miles will wait at some appointed
spot on the romSe for the expeditions from Tampa, Newport
Xews and Xew York to fall into his column. These expeditions
are already under way. some of them with two or three day's
start of General Miles, so that the delay should not be very
great.
After all this difficulty about the naval convoy, and the first
conclusion of the naval authorities that none was necessary, the
strength of that furnished is surprising. There is a first-class
battle-ship, the Massachusetts; an effective protected cruiser, the
Cincinnati; a speedy and well-manned gunboat, the Annapolis,
and four vessels of the auxiliary navy, which have already proved
by their performance in Cuban waters that they are fully equal
to the ordinary gunboat in offensive power. These are the
Gloucester, which distinguished herself in the destruction of
Cervera's squadron; the Wasp, which has attained an enviable
notoriety as a disturber of Spanish blockhouses; the Leyden,
which for a time was the sole representative of the United
States power in Havana harbor, and the Dixie.
Secretary Alger believes that General Miles, on the Yale,
will arrive at his destination Sunday morning with 3000 men
under his command. A day later will come 4000 men on trans
ports, and the day following that 3000 more. Whether the land
ing will be deferred until the arrival of this entire force or
whether General Miles will take the initiative and hoist the flag
himself on Porto Rican soil is left to the discretion of that
officer.
It is the department's intention that he shall not lack for
troops or food, and this expedition may be followed by several
others as fast as the troops can be got ready until word from
the general says that he needs no more.
General Schwan's brigade, comprising the Fifth, the Elev
enth and the Nineteenth United States Infantry, a splendid
body of trained soldiers, sailed from Tampa to-day to join
General Miles, and if the Porto Rican expedition is not an im
mediate success it will not be for lack of disposition in the War
Department to supply every requisite.
MILES BACKED BY
A STRONG SQUADRON
WASHINGTON, July 21.â Concerning
the naval convoys of General Miles' ex
pedition from Cuba to Porto Rico, the
Navy Department to-night made public
the following statement: Admiral
Sampson telegraphs this afternoon to
the Secretary of the Navy that there
has been no delay in furnishing ample
convoy to General Miles. A day or two
ago the Cincinnati and New Orleans
were both placed at his disposal. The
Columbia and Yale, carrying troops,
are both powerfully armed, sayÃ the
Admiral's telegram, and this is an
ample convoy for his expedition and
to effect his landing. The Annapolis,
Wasp and Leyden have been ordered
from Nlpe, the Gloucester also added
and the three monitors ordered from
Tampa. Under these circumstances
there certainly has been no lack of
naval assistance. If General Miles pre
ferred to wait, the delay was his own.
However, in further answer to his re
quest, the Massachusetts and Dixie
were also added this morning and he
has probably started.
This statement shows that General
Miles will be barked in effecting his
landing on Porto Rican soil by a strong
squadron of the navy. In addition to
the vessels named in the statement, it
is .iTicially admitted for the first time
that the powerful monitors Terror, Am
phitrite and Puritan, which have been
at Key West, are under orders to pro
ceed to Porto Rico to assist in the re
duction of the forces there.
It is known, also to be not unlikely â
indeed, it is probable â that still other
vessels of Admiral Sampson's fleet will
participate in the reduction of the for
tifications of San Juan. This was indi
cated clearly by Secretary Long's
statement this afternoon concerning
the sailing of Commodore Watson's
Eastern squadron to Spain. In the
course of that statement, the Secretary
said the Eastern squadron would be
sent to Spain later, when the Porto Ri
ean campaign permits. It seems clear
that some at least of the vessels will be
employed in the bombardment of the
fortifications of Porto Ilico's principal
city. _
PORTO RICANS WHO
WILL AID AMERICANS
NEW YORK, July 21.â A Washing
ton BDecial to the Herald saya: The
Porto Ricans selected to accompany
the American army of invasion as aides
and guides will embark on transports at
Newport News on Saturday under the
direction of General Antonio Mattell
Lluveras. Besides General Lluveras,
Senors Mateo Fajardo, Rafael Mar
cuash, Domineo Collazo, Emilio Gon
zales, Jose Budet, Juan Bezosa and Dr.
Del Valle, who are all men of promin
ence in Porto Rican affairs, will go and
General Miles hopes they will do much
toward winning over the population of
the island.
General Miles delegated the selection
of the men to "W. P. Sutton, who was
for fourteen years United States Consul
in Mexico and speaks Spanish fluently.
In the selection of the men no recogni
tion was given to the so-called Porto
Rican Junta in New York, which alms
at Porto Rican independence and has
Dr. Julio Henna at its head. The Porto
Rican aids will carry with them 30.000
rifles and corresponding ammunition
furnished by the War Department and
designed for the native Porto Ricans.
The revolutionists in Porto Rico who
comprise the annexation party there
are as bitter in their resentment to
wards Spain as are the insurgents in
Cuba. They are looking forward anx
iously to the invasion of the island by
the United States forces, and are mak
ing as extensive preparations as their
limited means will permit to give aid to
their allies.
A letter just received by General Ma
teo Lluveras, the representative of the
revolutionists in Washington, gives an
interesting account of the conditions
there and the anxiety of some repre
sentative Porto Ricans to accompany
the American army in order that theli
presence may have a moral effect on
the inhabitants of the island, who have
taken up arms for Spain. The letter
says that Spanish sympathizers have
prejudiced the ignorant classes against
Americans by telling them the latter
are coming to plunder the island and
commit excesses. Many negroes will,
therefore, fight for Spain. There is
much dissatisfaction, however, because
of the high prices and because ihe
Spaniards treat the natives like dogn.
In Ponce there are several native regi
ments which will assist the invading
army. Juan Rodrigues, who has r;on<?
much for annexation, has been shot by
order of the captain general after being
tortured.
WHERE MILES MAY
GAIN A LANDING
NEW YORK, July 21.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Information came last night
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1898.
THE DEPARTURE OF GENERAL MILES' EXPEDITIONARY FORCE FROM SIBONEY FOR PORTO RICO.
from an official high in authority that
General Miles would effect a landing
at the harbor of Fajardo on the east
coast of Porto Rico, as stated in the
Herald this morning. lam informed
to-night by one who feels sure that his
information is correct, but which is not
confirmed by the official who desig
nated Fajardo as the landing place,
that General Miles will land at Guan
ica. It is stated by experts that
from the road from Guanlca, which is
106 miles from San Juan, it is practi
cally shorter than the road of thirty
four miles from Fajardo to San Juan,
for twenty-eight miles of the latter
road is merely a riding path. Guanica
is on the southwestern coast of the isl
and. There is a good wagon road < f
six miles to Yauco, whence there is a
railroad well equipped to Ponca, twen
ty-two miles distant. From Ponca to
San Juan is an excellent road eighteen
feet in width, with fourteen feet of
pounded stone along the center.
Vessels of thirty feet draught can
easily enter the bay of Guanica and
proceed close in shore. It has no fort
ifications or mines. It is considered
one of the best ports in the whole isl
and.
FROM CAMP THOMAS
TO PORTO RICO
CHICKAMAUGA, Ga., July 21.âTo
night it looks as if at least two-thirds
of the troops at Camp Thomas are to
be ordered to the front as an expedi
tionary force to go to Porto Rico, un-
der General Brooke. The movement
will be begun to-morrow morninp.
when the second brigade of the First
Division, First Corps, commanded by
Brigadier General Haines, will leave
for Newport News. This brigade re
ceived marching orders a few minutes
before 6 o'clock this evening. The reg
iments of the brigade are the Fourth
Ohio, Third Illinois and Fourth Penn
sylvania. The order to move was
greeted with the wildest enthusiasm.
This brigade is the only organization
that will leave the park to-morrow,
but if there is not a sudden change in
the plans as they are understood here
to-night, the entire First Corps, which
numbers about 36,000 officers and men,
will follow, the different brigades go
ing out as rapidly as transportation
can be arranged.
TRANSPORTS SAIL
WITH THE TROOPS
CHARLESTON, S. C, July 21.â The
expedition which started to Porto Rico
from here Wednesday morning finally
got to sea to-day. The Grand Duchess
and the No. 30, with General Wilson
and the Second and Third Wisconsin
Regiments, spent the night off Sumter.
At 8 o'clock this morning tugs took
them out through the jetties. It was
not until 8 o'clock to-night that they
were followed by the No. 21, carrying
the Sixteenth Pennsylvania and two
companies of the Sixth Illinois. The
work of loading the last-mentioned ves
sel went busily forward all day. Some
trouble was experienced in loading the
1000 mules that were to go on the ship,
but otherwise the work was done rap
idly and without the least accident. The
men were given an enthusiastic cheer
by thousands of people who were as
sembled to see them off.
NEW YORK, July 21.â At the office
of Major Summerhays, who has charge
of the Government's transports at this
port, it was stated that the Roumania
and Michigan sailed this morning and
that the Massachusetts got off to-night.
The Norwegian tramp, Otto, loaded
with lumber and laborers to assist Gen
eral Miles' expedition at Porto Rico,
also left to-day.
The City of Washington and the Oli
vette, two of the original transports,
which came back to this port with
wounded, are being fitted aut again for
use in carrying troops, although the
Olivette will be used as an auxiliary
hospital ship whenever needed. It Is
expected that the hospital ship Relief
will return to this port to unload the
wounded aboard of her and she will
then sail direct to Porto Rico.
ADMIRAL SAMPSON
ORDERED TO PORTO RICO
WASHINGTON, July 21.â President
McKinley this morning issued personal
orders, through the Secretary of the
Navy, that Admiral Sampson should
proceed immediately to Porto Rico
with General Miles. The President's
orders are susceptible of no miscon
struction. They are imperative to a
degree seldom employed except in
cases of extreme emergency. They are
of the -sort that will brook no delay in
their execution. Admiral Sampson
must start at once or the President will
know the reason why.
PUTTING SMALL GUNS
ON THE PHILADELPHIA
Trying to Hasten the Vessel's De-
parture for Honolulu â The Iro
ouois' Big Tow.
VALLiEJO, July 21â The six-pounders
nnil other pruns for the secondary battery
of the Philadelphia arrived at Mare Isl
and last evening, and workmen in the
ordnance department have been using
every effort to have them mounted with
out delay, so that the vessel can start for
Honolulu. She has been coaling for sev
eral days, and while her bunkers are not
filled to their utmost capacity, she will
bo able to make tho trip to the islands
without difficulty. The flagship is all
ready to start as soon as her small guns
are in place, and will probably leave for
San Francisco to-morrow. It is said that
Captain Wadleigh has orders to proceed
without delay.
Lieutenant Turner of the tug Iroquois
is rushing preparations for towing the
ship Tacoma to Manila with horses and
mules for the use of General Merritt's
forces. She will go via Honolulu, and will
undoubtedly make the trip in good time.
The Iroquois is the most powerful tug
in the Pacific, and can easily tow the
Tacoma at a 10-knot rate. The latter
vessel will carry coal, which will be
transferred to the Iroquois at the La
drones.
LIVELY STAMPEDE
INTO THE COUNTRY
LONDON, July 22.â A dispatch to the
Standard from Corunna gives a lively
account of the stampede into the coun
try owing to the fears of the "ap
proaching American squadron." The
correspondent says there is a daily
stream of bullock carts with furniture,
and the town is nearly deserted by the
better class of inhabitants.
The local papers there have fright
ened the people so much that the cap
tain-general summoned the editors and
threateneed them all with Imprison
ment if they printed one word about
Commodore Watson's squadron. The
exodus, however, shows no signs of
diminishing.
A pamphlet has. been distributed
among the working men, urging them
to demand peace at all cost, owing to
the terrible distress and the lack of
work and food. It is evident that there
will be trouble in Corunna, says the
correspondent, and the working 1 classes
will make it unless something is
promptly donÂ«.

DEPARTURE OF WATSON'S
SQUADRON DELAYED ONLY
FOR VERY BRIEF PERIOD
Secretary Long Disposes of a Report Cir
culated That the Expedition Had
Been Abandoned.
WASHINGTON. July 21.â Secretary
Long said to-night that the prepara
tions for dispatching the Watson
squadron to European waters were go
ing on uninterruptedly, but that the
departure necessarily would await the
movement of the warships at Porto
Rico, the Massachusetts and other
ships being required for convoying the
troops to Porto Rico.
This disposed of a report circulated
during the day that the expedition had
been abandoned. It was felt that the
report was more mischievous at this
time, as it indicated a purpose to yield
to the implied threats from European
sources that a European coalition
would result if the American warships
attacked the coast of Spain.
Neither the State nor Navy Depart
ment looks for any embarrassment
from European quarters outside of
Spain as a result of the naval move
ment against the peninsula. During
the day orders were sent to Norfolk to
hurry forward work on the colliers
which are to accompany the Watson
expedition.
Had the army troopships been able
to go to Porto Rico without a naval
convoy, the Watson squadron could
have got away within the next few
days, as the War Board had wished to
close all preliminaries by next Satur
day. But as the battle-ship Massa
chusetts, cruisers Columbia, Cincinnati.
Dixie and Yale, together with several
lesser craft, were considered necessary
as a patrol for the Miles expedition,
this changes the plans slightly. The
Dixie is almost certain to be in the
Watson squadron and the Massachu
setts is likely to be. Secretary Long
expressly says, however, that the de
lay of the Watson squadron is inci
dent to the convoying of the troops to
Porto Rico, and does not mean that the
start will be postponed until the Porto
Rico operations are concluded.
The report from Barcelona that the
people were so fearful of the approach
of the Watson squadron that they
were urging France to establish a pro
tectorate over all the Catalonia dis
trict, including Barclona, was dis
missed by officials, and by members of
the diplomatic corps best informed on
the affairs of France, as fantastic
speculation, quite unwarranted by any
actual movement now on foot. It is
said to be thoroughl- well established
that France is not lending a helping
hand to Spain in any of her afflictions.

One Hundred of the Enemy Slain

TLAYA DEL ESTE, Guantanamo j
Bay, July 21.â The following is the offi
cial account of the latest naval victory
âthat at Manzanillaâ modestly told by j
mander Todd of the United States
gunboat Wilmington, in his report to
Admiral Sampson:
"At 7 o'clock on the morning of July
1Â« the vessels on blockade duty In this .
vicinity, the Wilmington, Helena, Scor- j
plon. Hist. Hornet, Wampatuck and \
Osceola, approached the harbor of Man

Wilmington and Helena entered the (
channel toward the city, the Scorpion |
and Osceola the ir.:d-channel and the
Hist, Hornet and Wampatuck the south j
channel, tl enta of the vessels j
being so tim^d as to bring them within
effective range of the shipping at about
the same moment.
â¢â¢At ' ' fire waa opened on the ship
ping, and after a deliberate fire, last
ed a half hours, three
Spanish transports. El Gloria, Jose
La and La Purioiama Concepcion, ,
were turned and destroyed. The pon- :
h was the harbor guard and

was burr.-d and blown up. Three gun- i

have been disabled.
CRISIS IN THE
WATER FIGHT
Los Angeles Company's
Lease Expires.
OBSTACLES TO A SETTLEMENT
CITY'S PLANS TO REGAIN ITS
PROPERTY.
<
Papers of Incorporation of the Con
solidation City Water Com
pany Have Been
Tiled.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 21.â T0-morrow
at midnight the lease expires of the
Los Angeles City "Water Company upon
the water distributing plant and the
â¢water of the Los Angeles River, which
the corporation has held for thirty
years and from which a profit of $10,
000,000 has been reaped.
It was planned for the Mayor and
city police force to take possession of
the plant at 1 o'clock on Saturday
morning by force, as all negotiations
looking to the city regaining possession
of its property have resulted in naught.
There is a difference of 52,000,000 be-
tween the Council's idea of what the
water company's improvements are
worth and the corporation's idea.
The Mayor cannot take possession for
the reason that he has been enjoined
from so doing by the Superior Court of
this county, and the writ is returnable
next Monday. The City Council held a
special session to-day and requested
the water company directors to meet
them at 10 o'clock Saturday morning,
v. hf-n the Council will make a tender of
for the plant. This offer will
be rejected and the Council will then
â  d to name its arbitrator. It will
ask thÂ° water company to also name an
arbitrator, and the two so named are
lect a third. Should the water
any enter into arbitration with
the city before it has positive assurance
that the price fixed by the arbitrators
will be paid it will probably present as
irs arbitrator Judge John G. Chapman,
its attorney. It is very probable that
the City Council will name as the city's
arbitrator ex-City Engineer Fred
Eaton.
This contemplated action of the
council will bring the water situation
to a head and termination with ten
days. The great point now is to ascer
tain whether the parties will arbitrate
and if arbitration is entered into
whether it will be legal and binding on
both parties. The citizens are thor
oughly aroused to the importance of
- of th- next few days and the
â¢ will be anxiously awaited.
To-day papers of incorporation of
the Consolidated City Water Company
were filed. The capitalization is $2,
1, and it is doubtless contemplat
ed that this company shall augment or
sup'-rÂ«"fle the former company, con
solidating all its various interests.
BADLY INJURED
ON THE OREGON
Lieutenant Harrison's Left Eardrum
Broken During Bombardment
of Santiago.
NEW YORK. July 21.â Lieutenant "W. j
11. Harrison of "Washington, one of the I
officers of the battle-ship Oregon when
she made the 15.000-mile trip around the
Horn, Is In the Naval Hospital in Brook
lyn, with his hearing almost destroyed.
At the first bombardment of Santiago
Lieutenant Harrison was in charge of the
after 13-inch gun turret on the Oregon.
An 8-inch gun was fired directly over his |
head, and the concussion was so great
that the drum of his left ear was broken
and his right ear seriously injured. He
has made arrangements to undergo a
course of treatment wltb a. Manhattan 1
Bpecialis.'
"The firing was maintained at a
range which is believed to be beyond
the range of the shore artillery. It was
continued until, after a gradual closing
In, the shore batteries opened fire at
a comparatively short range, when the
ships were recalled, the object of the
expedition having been accomplished
and the ideas of the Commander-in
chief carried out, as I understood them,
that is, to destroy the enemy's ship
ping, but not to charge the field bat
teries of the forts. No casualties oc
curred on beard any of our vessels.
Great care was taken In directing the
fire that as little damage as possible
should be done to the city itself, and so
far as could be observed little if any
was done.
"All of our vessels were handled with
sound discretion and excellent Judg
ment by the several commanding- offi
cers, which was to have been expect
ed from the men commanding them.
"The Spanish loss is believed to have
been in the neighborhood of 100 dead.
The gunboats destroyed or driven
ashore were the Delgado, Guantanamo,
Ostralia, Continola and Guardian."
The committee appointed by Admiral
Sampson to examine the wreck of the
Reina Mercedes reports that the ves
sel can probably be raised and added
to the American navy. Her guns have
been recovered by the lowa.
General Miles left to-day for Porto
Rico. The main body of the fleet lies
at Guantanamo. The Brooklyn is the
only ship left at Santiago.
HELD UP BY
MASKED MEN
Attack on a Santa Fe
Passenger Train.
VERY LIVELY BATTLE ENSUES
ENGINEER. FIREMAN AND ONE
OFFICER SHOT.
Cab Riddled With Bullets and the
Express Car Shot Full of Holes,
But the Safe Is Not
Reached.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENTER, July 21.â A special to the
News from Fort Worth, Tex., says:
The Eouth-bound Santa Fe passenger
train due here at 10:20 o'clock to-night
was held up near Saginaw, eight miles
north of here, by masked men. The
robbers ordered the engineer to run to
North Fort Worth, three miles from
the city.
A Sheriff's posse, city police and
armed citizens have gone to the scene
on a yard engine. A report has reached
here that some seventy-five shots were
exchanged by the robbers and officers.
No definite facts can be learned at
present.
FORT WORTH, July 21.â Twomenjust
brought in the engine of the held-up
train. The cab is literally perforated
with bullets and covered with blood.
The engineer and fireman are both mis
sing and are thought to have been
killed. One officer is also said to have been
killed in the melee. The express car
was shot full of holes. The robbers
failed to get Into the safe, the officers
pouring such a hot fire into them.
Six men did the work. Two boarded
the engine at Saginaw and covered the
engineer. They made him stop in a
deep cut one and one-half miles north
of the stockyards. Superintendent
Pendell, who was on the train, and the
crew went forward to see what was the
matter. As they advanced toward the
engine they were greeted with a fusll
; lade from the west bank. The bullets
! went over their heads, but perforated
I the engine and express cars. Engineer
Joe Williams is likely fatally wounded.
The fireman cannot be found, but is
â  thought to be also wounded. While
; their companions on the bank were fir
ing, the two robbers on the engine
: Jumped oft*. The whole party escaped.
Nothing was obtained and nobody on
the train was injured except those on
the engine.
CERVERA MAY CONCLUDE
TO REMAIN WITH US
Rumor That He and His Son Will
Take Up Their Residence at
the Hub.
ANNAPOLIS, July 21.â A well-defined
rumor, which cannot, however, be traced
to an authoritative source, was on every
body's lips here to-day to the effect that
Admiral Cervera had expressed a deter
mination not to return to his native coun
try at the close of hostilities betweeen the
United States and Spain. It is said that
the admiral has decided to take up his
residence In Boston, whither he will re
pair with his son, Lieutenant Cervera,
who is also a prisoner here, as soon as
peace is declared.

CINCINNATI. July 21.â Last week the
Cincinnati Jockey Club declared off their
fall meeting. Now it is announced that
there will probably be no more races at
the Oakley track. As soon as Colonel
Appleg-ate returns from Chicago the direc
tors will meet to consider the advisability
of applying for a receiver. The Indebted
ness is mostly due to stockholders who
have personally advanced money. With
three tracks and 180 days of racing each
season, this part has been overdone dur
ing the past two or three years. The
meetings were madÂ« shorter this year, but
still the spring meeting of only fifteen
days at Oakley was unprofitable.

FIELDS AS A
CLEVER MORAL
CONTORTIONIST
His Methods Sharply Criticized
by Corporation Coynsel
J. B. DeviQe.
Made Contradictory Reports on the Affairs of
the Union Building and Loan
Association.
SACRAMENTO. July 21.â "Mr. J. I*
Fields, when he signed his report to
the shareholders of the Union Build-
Ing and Loan Association, wherein he
he declared that he found everything
correct and satisfactory, was serving,
during the entire period of his investi
gations, as secretary to the State Board
of Building and Loan Commissioners;
and while he signed his report as a
'public accountant,' he came to Sacra
mento in his official capacity, and the
stockholders believed when he read his
report that it came from an official
source."
Such were the words of Corporation
Counsel J. B. Devlne this morning in
speaking of The Call's expose of the
methods employed by J. L. Fields
In dealing with the sacred rights and
Interests of the innocent stockholders
in the defunct association above men
tioned.
"Mr. Fields was given $75 for mak
ing that report, as an accountant, by
the secretary of the association," con
tinued Mr. Devine. "When the com
mittee* from the stockholders made an
investigation of the association's af
fairs we found that Mr. Fields had
come to Sacramento for the purpose
of looking into the affairs of the as
sociation, as was his duty under the
law. The law also requires the â¢asso
ciation to prepare a statement under
the direction of some expert appointed
to do that particular kind of work. We
found that Mr. Alsip had engaged Mr.
Fields to do the work of an expert, and
while he was proceeding in the capac
ity of an official from the State board,
he incidentally picked up $75, as his
pay tor work which he could easily do
while he was looking through the books
as secretary to the Commissioners.
Now, while this may not be contrary
t" any statute, and may be looked upon
as a matter of propriety on the part
i:' the secretary, it certainly led to
misunderstandings and a misapprehen
sion on tliv part of the shareholders
who heard Mr. Fields' report read as
ii!i 'expert, 1 when they thought he was
Breaking as an official. "
Mr. Devlne displayed no hesitancy in
condemning such a practice, and with
Major Weinstoek and the balance of
the shareholders acknowledges that he
was entirely misled through the em-
I'loyment of Mr. Fields in a private ca
pacity during the period when he was
supposed !o be acting as an impartial
guardian of their interests under the
law which defines the duties, powers
and obligations of the State Commis
sion.
Bet ti'in 6 of the act of 1893 provides
"ih.it the Commissioners shall visit
once in every year, and as much
oftener as they may deem expedient,
every building and loan association In
tho State." It is very evident that the
Commissioners intended to meet the re
quirements of that statute by Bending
in their stead the secretary, who by
the very nature of his employment was
in a better position to make the in
quiry contemplated than the Commis
sioners themselves. Consequently,
when Mr. Fields came to Sacramento
ho came under the direction of the stat
ute and the shareholders had a right to
presume that every communication
coming from him to them was In iho
nature of an official notice of the con
dition of their association. The law
further provides that "the commission
shall have access to the vaults, books,
papers, and shall thoroughly 'examine'
and 'expert' all the affairs of the asso
ciation."
Section 9 of the same act directs
"that if the commisison find upon ex
amination that such corporation has
been violating the provisions of the l^w
governing such associations or Is con
ducting business in an unsafe manner,
such as to render its further proceed
ings hazardous to the public or those
having funds in Its custody, they shall
notify the Attorney General, who shall
commence proceedings." etc.
The question arises. Did Mr. Fields
upon his examination find that the
Union Building and Loan Asoeiation
of Sacramento was violating the pro
visions of the law or was conducting
Its business in an unsafe manner, or
such as to render its further proceed
ings hazardous to the public and those
having funds In its custody? Mr. Fields,
as a public accountant, says he "found
the books and accounts in a satisfac
tory- condition." Mr. Fields, as the ex
amining officer of the State commis
sion, says in his letter to Major Wein
ptock that he told some of the directors
that the affairs of the association should
be wound up at once and go into li
quidation. He did more. He gave the
directors three weeks in which to fol
low out his directions or show to him
that he was wrong in his estimates of
value. As a matter of fact Mr. Fields
must have known that there was no
possible escape from the inevitable fail
ure of the association. Yet he did not
so inform the shareholders, but kept
them in the dark, and until their com
mittee reported they had no intimation
Whatever of the awful state of affairs.
This committee in its report says:
"The records show a thoroughly reck
less and unbusinesslike method of
making loans." Mr. Fields saw thesame
records, yet he reported thinsrs to be in
a "satisfactory condition." Mr. Fields
was an expert and was better qualified
to judge of such matters, yet he found
"correctness" and "satisfaction" on the
same pupres of tho association's books
where the committee found "reckless
ness and unbusinesslike methods." It
seems hardly probable that the $75
given to Mr. Fields for his service as
a public accountant could have blinded
hip official eyes, and yet what he saw
officially was certainly overlooked pri
vately, even though he went through
the books but the one time, and after
which he prepared the "accountant's"
report, and yet suppressed knowledge
from the shareholders which he must
have gained in the same research, be
cause he admits It In his letter to Ma
3err YYYinstock.
Section 18 of the law of 1895 says:
"Every building and loan association
shall make a report once a year to the
commissioners, verified by oath of the
president and secretary, showing ac
curately the financial condition of as
sets at the close of said term, the
amount and character of all liabilities
ajn.d all moneys."
Now this report is made upon the
recommendations of the expert ap
pointed to go over these books and ac
counts. When Mr. Fields reported
things -satisfactory to the shareholders
austained the report of the direct
ore; at the same time he gave warn
ing to them that they must go into
immediate liquidation.
Further still was Mr. Fields bound
by his oath of office to make this re
port as it should have been made.
Section 14 of the act reads as follows:
"The commission, if in their opinion
any such corporation or its officers
have violated any law in relation to
such corporation, shall forthwith re
port the same with such recommenda
tions as they deem expedient to the
Attorney General, who shall forthwith
institute a prosecution for such viola
tion in the name of the people of fne
State."
It would be uncharitable to say that
Mr. Fields had not discovered very
serious violations of the law when he
went through the books. The fact that
the very report he signed showed in
1896 that the association held over
$106,000 in real estate, when the law
never contemplated nor permitted any
holdings in real estate, should have at
least merited some reference. He also
found $19,785.50 delinquent Interest.
The fact that Edwin K. Alsip is now
an absconder is due to the violation of
law while he was the secretary of the
association, yet Mr. Fields found it
not, or at least he made no report of
it, as the law directs.
It is a bad kettle of fish all through;
at the same time there is little solace
In such a reflection on the part of
those who intrusted their investments
to the supervision of Mr. J. LÂ». Fields,
secretary and representative and act
ing agent of the State Board of Com
missioners for Building and Loan As
sociations of the State of California.
FIELD RETICENT.
He Refuses to Discuss the The-
ory of His Unofficial
Conduct.
"Throw a stone at a pack of curs and
the cur that is hit will howl."
This is the imprudent explanation that
J. L. Fields advanced in a lit of stammer-
Ing excitement yesterday in answer to
the article published in The Call of
yesterday, In which was fully
outlined his methods of conducting his
office as secretary to the Commissioners
on Building and Loan Associations.
Who is the particular cur that Mr. Field
would fain point out? If the decision
were allowed for determination by ocular
Judgment guided by ordinary Intelligence,
he would undoubtedly be censured by the
revolt of hia own conscience after the
Btonn of anger and resentment had fully
cleared away and he were allowed to
think and revolve the quotation Into its
correct meaning.
The article that Mr. Field objected to
was a plain and unbiased collaboration
of facts published for the weal of the
general community to the exclusion of
any and all partisan motives for an in
dividual attack.
Although the quotation, cribbed from
John Goff, one of the members of the cel
ebrated Lexow Committee, is a wise one,
it nevertheless should not be allowed con
sideration in the ordinary mind, as its
meaning is equivocal and can cut both
ways with equal facility, thereby render
ing it exceedingly dangerous for offhand
utterance. Iso matter how the equivo
cation, as it has been uttered and now
exists, might be twisted, it could not in
the ordinary conception of English be
construed into any other meaning than
that which it infersâ that the coiner of it
is the cur hit. The object of the quotation
was to have its meaning strapped upon
Fields' enemies, who have been Impru
dent enough to stir his ire by affixing
their signatures to published statements;
but the stone has returned with an alarm
ing velocity, similar to the boomerang,
back to the wielder of the weapon.
Other than the quotation cited Fields
would say absolutely nothing, although
given an opportunity to make a state
ment in denial or at least explanation of
the facts published. He would neither
affirm nor deny the truth of the article,
and when pressed to answer questions re
lating to its authenticity pleaded as an
excuse that he didn't care to be involved
in a controversy of any kind. Hi re
fused bluntly and somewhat excitedly in
answer to the question as to who was
paying the expenses of his so-called of
ficial visit to bacramento, and reiterated
his groundless reasons for not doing bo.
Why he should refuse can probably be
explained by the truth of the published
statements.
One of the things that Fields will have
to explain before he can he cleared of the
charge of unofficial conduct is the follow
ing passage quoted from Wednesday's
Call:
"On December 16, 1896, he made a re
port to the shareholders of the Union
Building and Loan Association of Sacra
mento, wherein he took occasion to say,
in the capacity of a 'Public Accountant,'
that the books and accounts of the asso
ciation were in a correct and satisfactory
condition, when as a matter of fact it
would be most difficult to find the affairs
of any association in a more unsatisfac
tory condition."
Fields' effort to explain his whitewash
ing report about the Union Building and
Loan Association of Sacramento is ex
ceedingly weak.
He says: "I did not give a certificate as
secretary of this board (Building and
Loan Commissioners). What I did sign
was as a public accountant, for I never
have and never will give a certificate as
an official of this board."
If Mr. Fields did not offlciallv "examine"
into the affairs of the Union Building and
Loan Association of Sacramento, then
the said association must have paid him
for the work and for his traveling ex
penses.
Did the Union Building and Loan Asso
ciation of the State of California pay these
expenses? If Mr. Fields acted as Pub
lic Accountant the question arises, How
much of his time does the State pay for
as Secretary? When he visits building
and loan associations for the purpose of
experting their books does ho Inform
them in advance whether or not he acts
in an official capacity or In that of Pub
lic Accountant?
When the idea of having State super
vision over building and loan associations
in this State was advocated in convention
In San Francisco the strong point was
made that reports of expert examinations
would be stamped by official authority.
Mr. Fields' plea would upset an this
and his report simply as an accountant
would have no more weight than that
of the experts who made examinations
prior to the passage of the act creating
a Board of Building and Loan Commis
sioners.
Who paid Mr. Fields' railroad fare to
and from Sacramento at the time he ex
amined the books of the Union Building
and Loan Association? Did he get leave
of absence from the Commissioners If he
left their office to go on private business
as an accountant? At his office in the
Clunie building there is painted on the
door, "J. L. Fields, Secretary State Build
ing and Loan Commissioners," but no
"Public Accountant."
If, according to himself. Mr. Field did
not make his report as secretary of the
State Building and Loan Commissioners
it is a fortunate thing for his own reputa
tion and that of the commission that he
did not do so, because it is so meager and
unsatisfactory. He appears to be "devil
ish sly" In keeping clear of snags and J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1898.
shoals by carefully avoiding dangerous
details of facts and figures. Mr. Fields
Ingeniously declares: "I found that all
moneys had been properly entered and all
payments had been made by defendant."
Beyond this the certificate does not go."
Of course not, and for this the building
and loan associations of California are
taxed to pay the salaries and traveling
and office expenses of two Commissioners
and a secretary to expert the books and
accounts of the building and loan asso
ciations of California,
Mr. Field, the secretary. Is supposed to
do all the work of the office, and the man
ner In which it is done is evidenced by re
sults in Sacramento, where the deluded
stockholders of the Union Building and
Loan Association have been literally rob
bed under the nose of the secretary of the
State Commissioners of Building and
Loan Associations.
If put to a vote of thÂ© officers of these
associations they would almost unani
mously declare in favor of abolishing this
worthless and expensive excrescence on
the body politic of this State.
SEEK A REDUCTION OF
THEIR^ASSESSMENI
The San Mateo Electric and Nevada
County Narrow Gauge Before
the State Equalizers.
SACRAMENTO. July 21.-ThÂ© San
Francisco and San Mateo Electric Rail
way Company had Its inning to-day be
fore the State Board of Enualization. In
his petition for a reduction the secretary
of the corporation, William Clayton, made
the following statement: "The company
values the roadway, roadbed and fran
chises at $75,000 and rolling stock at $19,
776. The earnings of the road for the year
ending December 31, 1897 amounted to
$184,716 86, expenses $170,460 41."
Mr. Clayton said that the road last year
was assessed by the State Board at $75,
000, in view of the fact that the worn out
tracks were being renewed, that the
equipment was old and that the business
of the road had suffered much on account
of the rough roadbed. This year the com
pany has constructed ten miles of track â
the best piece of work of the kind ever
done on the coast. The company has in
creased the assessed valuation on the
road from $40,000 of last year to $95,000.
The latter amount, it was contended, was
a true and honest valuation of the road as
far as concerned the power of the board
to assess It. The power house, real estate
and improvements of the company are
assessed by the San Francisco Assessor.
In speaking of the franchise Mr. Clay
ton said that for the franchise to be val
uable the road must earn about 8 per
cent in order to right the depreciation of
property renewals, repairs and loss in life
of the franchise itself. He considered i
that his road was entitled to at least 3 I
per cent on the amount of its invesment.
Therefore the company would have to
earn more than 11 per cent before the
franchise could begin to confer any priv
ileges on the company. He maintained
that It was unreasonable to assess a
franchise on the total valuation of stocks
and bonds of a railroad company, as ad
vocated by Mayor Phelan of San Fran
cisco.
George Fletcher, secretary of the Ne
vada County narrow gauge railroad, run
ning from Colfax on the Central Pacific
to Nevada City, a distance of 22.18 miles,
appeared for his road. The road was as
sessed last year for $100,000, which has
been the amount of assessment for the
five previous years. According to the rail
road statement on file, the value of the
roadway, roadbed and franchise is placed
at $45,000, and the rolling stock at $23,200.
The earnings of the road for the year
ending December 31, 1897. were $105,592 68,
expenses $87.373 43: net $21,219 25; interest
payments $18,344 50. The improvements
and real estate have been assessed by the
Cuuntv Assessor at $1i1.072.
Mr. Fletcher said that, compared with
last year, the company had increased the
assessed valuation in some respects. The
road had no up-country business this
year, duo to the fact that the small hy
draulic mines could not be worked for
want of tree water coming from the melt
ed snow, of which there was a light fall
during the past winter. The business of
the road, however, was increased by the
prosperity of the quartz and drift mines |
in Nevada County. The mines received a
great deal of new machinery, which was
hauled over the road.

boys are benefited by their encamp
ment is more apparent every day, both
in their drills and also in their soldierly
deportment.
Every morning while it is still cool
the regiment is marched out to the
drill grounds and two hours' hard drill
ing is accomplished under the careful
instruction of Colonel Sullivan. This
morning found twenty-eight young of
fenders in the guardhouse; they were
all put to work cleaning the camp and
were discharged from custody soon
after 10 o'clock. The call for dress pa
rade this evening was sounded soon
after supper, and, headed by Colonel
Sullivan, the entire regiment marched
to and held the impressive ceremony
of dress parade in front of the court
house. Fourth street was thronged by
the residents, who loudly complimented
the cadets' deportment and their natty
appearance in white duck trousers.
Before going to the courthouse thy
regiment paid the Rev. Father Cassin
a visit, marching past his house at
"the present." The march was then
resumed to the Ursaline Academy,
where the band took up a position on
the lawn and tendered the Sisters of
the academy a military serenade.
To-morrow his grace Archbishop
Rlordan, accompanied by the regimen
tal chaplain, Rev. Father O'Ryan, will
pay the boys a visit. He will arrive Jn
Santa Rosa at 10 o'clock and he will be
met at the depot by the entire regiment
and escorted to and from the camp by
the cadets.

BRINGING ORDER
OUT OF CHAOS IN
LAWLESS SKAGUAY
Town Still Under Martial Law,
but Soapy Smith's Gang Is
Scattered.
Many Disappointed Gold Seekers Return
From Copper Riverâ That Privateer
Story Revived.
JUNEAU, Alaska, July 17, by steam
ship Al-Kl to Departure Bay, B. C,
July 21.â The town of Skaguay is still
under martial law and all saloons are
Btill closed. Possibly the latter may
be opened to-morrow or next day.
Every ship carries south, even yet, pas
sengers who would not leave but for
threatened developments.
Preliminary hearings of persons sus
pected of standing in with the Soapy
Smith gang have been in progress sev
eral days. Marshal Shoup rounded up
all thOÃe who had been bound over by
the United States Commissioners,
twenty-six in all, chartered the steamer
Farallon, which happened to be in port,
herded all aboard and took them to
Sitka to prison. The Jail at Sitka was
already full and an annex of some kind
must be provided. Deputy United
States Marshal Taylor, who is accused
of general and particular complicity
with the gang, and one other man were
not put in irons, as at first reported.
The citizens' investigation committee
is still at work. The spirit of refor
mation has evidently seized the town
more seriously than ever before. The
$2700 of gold dust stolen from Klon
diker Stewart in Soapy Smith's saloon
has been recovered â that is, a part of
it. As thorough a search of the town
as was possible, together with a pow
erful bluff of the investigation commit
tee against suspected members of the
Soapy Smith gang, resulted In the dis
covery of all but JSOO in Soapy's trunk.
It is believed that this sum indicates
that a divvy had been made and that
the missing $500 was for some mem
ber of the gang.
City Surveyor Frank Reid, who shot
and killed Soapy, is also doomed to
death. Blood poising has resulted from
his wound in the thigh and it is said
he cannot recover. If Smith had died
before the steamer Tartar left there is
no doubt there would have been a num
ber of hangings.
In the search of rooms and houses a
large assortment of burglars' tools and
safe-cracking implements were found, j
This is taken to mean that these tools
were shortly to be used on the stores
and safes. Marshal Shoup thinks the |
gang intended to rob Alaska towns
and then hurry south.
The latest sensational report is that
the gang was about to begin operations j
against out-coming gold-laden Klon
dUcera by waylaying them on the trails.
There is said to be evidence of this, but
what it is has not leaked out of the
committee. This could be easily done in
the mountains and the bodies pitched
down Into ravines, where they would be
eaten by wild beasts and their crime
not be discovered for months, perhaps ;
never. But Soapy, the leader and or- !
ganizer, is dead. The gang is broken j
up, at least temporarily, and the chief j
of police, so-called, of Skaguay, is on |
his way to prison. J." W. Tanner of i
Juneau has been appointed Deputy I
United States Marshal at Skaguay in i
place of Taylor. The latter is charged j
with neglect of official duty.
Among those taken to Sitka by the j
Marshal are the following. They are
oh&rged with crimes from highway
robbery down: Turner Jackson, John
Clear, Al H. Isaacs, Charles Butler, 'â 
George Wilder, S. L. Taylor, Harry j
Bronson, W. E. Foster, Van B. Trip- .
let, John Bowens and Mrs. M. J. Tlr
pey. The woman is under arrest for
keeping a house of bad repute. The
situation has quieted down greatly.
The sorriest looking collection of i
gold-seekers from Copper River got
back to civilization and Juneau last
night on the steamship Excelsior. They
will take the regular steamers here and
proceed to Puget Sound and home. The
200 and more passengers secured a rate
of $15 to Juneau and $10 to the Sound.
The Excelsior also brought down a few
disappointed people from Yukatat.
Aboard were two Copper River boxed
corpses â the remains of Leroy Murfln I
of the Sleepy Eye mine, who died on
March 24 last, and J. H. Opdahl of Mar
shall, a miner who died the day before, j
both from exposure and over-exertion, j
Murfin wrapped his dead friend in a j
blanket, but no one was there to per- j
form even that small rite for himself.
Richard Shaw, a well-known youngvj
man of means of Rochester, N. T., who
took what was considered the best out
fit to Copper River, was drowned and |
his body not recovered. Some of the !
men have so little money that they are I

sleeping on the dock. This little inci
dent illustrates what at least one of the
passengers thinks of his Copper River
experience.
The Excelsior will sail north in a
day or two. It is the same Btory again
as from the three preceding cargoes of
the blasted hopes which have arrived
here. Men who went up with the
promise of spring return with the "win
ter of discontent" in their faces. They
use almost the same words in telling
about it. Glaciers, bottomless crev
ices, blowing and drifted snow, seeth
ing storms, roaring water, howling
winds, canyons, declivities, precipices,
impassable currents and more impassa
ble rapids, overturned boats, lost out
fits, hunger, exposure, cold and heat,
hurricanes, toil, toil, toil, and last and
bitterest of all, no gold â scarcely a
color. Every man claims to have been
deceived in regard to the country.
A. J. Northcott of Buffalo, N. V., and
J. J. Skelly of Homer, N. V., succeeded
in getting up the river. Northcott
says that near its head they found
flour gold in a few scattered places,
but the ground was not rich enough to
work. There were many indications
of paying copper. As an Instance of
the rapidity with which water runs in
that country these two men say they
came down Tachna River in a small
boat, eighteen miles, in forty-two min
utes.
The men stranded, unable to sell
their outfits, are still numerous. If
those beyond the glacier do not get out
within the next two or three weeks, the
returned goldseekers say, they will be
imprisoned there till next summer. It
is daring Providence, they Bay, to try
to shoot Miles Canyon down through
the glacier above its mouth. Manj are
too far up and will not be able to get
out.
Another view of the country, not
withstanding all the hard-luck stories,
is taken by hundreds of men up there.
They intend to stay, prospect the coun
try a year or two and see if there is
anything in it. Some are going up
over the divide and then down to Circle
City.
Information reached here by the last
regular steamer from the westward,
reviving that Victoria Spanish priva
i teer story, which is not altogether a
fake, and taken as a whole is rather
startling. The news comes through
two men widely known and of ac
knowledged standing in Alaska. The
first is C. S. Blackett, an attorney of
Juneau, who has just returned from
an extended trip to the westward, and
the other Colonel George Kostromet
ihoff of Sitka, official interpreter of the
United States District Court, who saw
the Russian colors pulled down and Old
Glory hoisted to the breeze on the flag
staff of Barranof Castle at Sitka when
Alaska became a United States pos
session in 1867 for $7,200,000. More
than that sum has since been taken out
of a single one of the many quartz
mines in Alaska.
Mr. Blackett said last night: "The
Victoria report of a privateer, which I
have seen in the papers since my rt
turn, brought to mind information re
ceived at Kodiak, where I was told
that a mysterious ship had been seen
in the vicinity of Analgo Pass, and
that she always dodged other ships. If
discovered the stranger ran from all
other ships, co that she could not be
made out. Her usual position was be
hind some island of the pass. No white
man or native had been able to make
her out. She was thought at Kodiak
to be a foreign vessel, and there is no
doubt that she acted most unaccounta
bly. This was about three weeks ago,
before the British cruiser Amphion was
dispatched north from Vancouver, B.
C Parties at Kodiak are going to
make an effort to identify the stranger.
She had one smokestack and appeared
to be about medium size."
Colonel Kostrometihoff says: "The
last Russian papers I received gave an
account of a Spanish cruiser which was
going to Bering Sea. The article stated
that a cruiser was to be sent and that
it was believed to be for the purpose
of privateering on the gold-laden ships
coming down from the Yukon. I have
not these papers here, or I would glad
ly show them to you. They are at my
home in Sitka. Mr. Blackett also told
me the story after he returned from
Kodiak.' 1 HAL HOFFMAN.

COL. MORRIS IS RETIRED.
General M. P. Miller Desig

After over thirty-=^v*n years of
faithful and efficient service as an of
ficer in the arrr-.y of the United States
Lieutenant Colonel Louis T. Morris.
Fourth United States Cavalry, who has
been In command of the Presidio for
the past four month?, has been retired
and to-day this offli er will turn over
the command of the post to Brigadier
ral Marcua V. M i About the
first of this month ' lonel
ris was ordered before an examin

to him. The sessions of thÂ« board are
said to have l warm, as
it was rumored that th^ commanding
sr wns broutrht ' as a re
pult of snmp p^tty Jealousy existing be-
M ijor White, the
post surg^r;. hut this ha? since been
d'-nied. Colonel Morris, besides hav
ir.e a lari us heart, was
: r '- : . ; - . re s~rious trou
ble with that ongan, and it was a fore
h'>ard would
recommend that he be rel
â¢ en daily expect

Bterday he re

13. b tiflcation that the

it came to him in his mail
n, D. C. I
â  as d~signated as the
- to take command of the Pre-
I this he will do to-day or
â¢ I until the formal trans -
â  is made Colonel Morris
mand. It is not known
the department intends to as
ral Miller to th<= permanent
â  â¢ r â¢ st, or if his rule will
â  mporary. Major J. J. Weis
rger of the First Battalion, First
Washington Regiment, is the ranking
officer at the Presidio next to Colonel
Morris, and it was supposed that he
would assume command of the post
upon the retirement of the latter of-
lonel Morris' war record and also
1 in the regular army since
the war Is one of which he has every
istly proud. He entered
the army May 14. 1861, as a first lleu
t in thr- Nineteenth Infantry.
mber 1. 1864, he was breveteil rap
tnin for gallant and meritorious s=s>r
9 'lurincr th^ Atlanta cnmpaisn, and
16. of the same year, he was
hr> v. â¢ i major for conspicuous gallan
try In the battle of Nashville. The
first of these breveted ranks was for
mally confirmed February 15. leos,l e O5,
when Colonel Morris was made cap
tain. He then served with the Twenty
eighth. Thirty-seventh and Third In
fantry and the Eighth cavalry, and
April 11, 1889, he was made major and
transferred to the Third Cavalry. Sub
sequently he was promoted to the
grade of lieutenant colonel and as
signed tn the Fourth Cavalry-.
je the declaration of war with
Fpaln many officers less deserving than
oel Morris have been promoted
and assigned to important duty at the
front, but nevertheless the veteran
per who is now placed on the re
tired Hst accepts the decree pertaining
mself in a soldierly manner. Many
of his friends in and out of the army
entertain the notion, however, that he
did not receive the consideration due
to a gallant and capable soldier, who
had gained honors on the field of bat
tie. He can retire, nevertheless, with
the sense of having performed his duty
in the field and in garrison. If the
petty jealousies of the service or the
underhand work of a clique hastened
nent he will not burden him
self on that account with a load of re
sentment. Colonel Morris recognizes
that life La too short and fame too fleet
ing for one to quarrel with destiny.
TROOPS AT THE PRESIDIO.
Division Hospital Moved â Utah
Troopers â The New York
Volunteers.
The removal of the division hospital
from Camp Merritt to the Presidio was
made yesterday under the supervision 01
( '\ven and Lieutenant Page, as
sisted by the other officers of Major
Owens staff. The sick soldiers were
: i with the greatest care in ambu
lar.'^es, a number of which were Sf-rur-'i;
|or ' Â»weti for this purpose. As fast
as they arrived :it the Presidio they w<t*
carefully moved into the different wards
ir. the bri-^k barra< k.s, that have been
turned over to Major Owen and trans
formed into a hospital. The reception
â¢ k soldiers at the Presidio was
under the charge of Lieutenant Pas*.
All of the equipments of the hospital
were also moved over and the entire
medical staff of stewards will be em
1 on duty as before. The. greater
>f the day was consumed in the
transfer, which was an enormous under
_-. and much credit is due to Major
and his officers for the successful
way in which they accomplished It.

'"aptain Calne of the Utah troop of cav
alry, who has been in his home at Salt
Lake City on a furlough for the past two
weeks, returned to his command yester
day. it is now definitely settled that this
tmop will be sent to Sequoia Park and
the 1 osemite Valley for duty, and Cap
tain Came is daily expecting orders to
move. The orders were prepared yester
day. First Lieutenant Smith will" take
about one-third of the command and
march to the former place. The troop will
leave here August 5. Captain Came will
have command of the remainder of the
troop in the Yosemite. At first the men
were very sore over the prospect, as they
all wanted to go to the front, but they
have accepted their fate in good part and
will do their duty. Captain Came said
yesterday that he thought his troop
would be much benefited by the experi
ence tney will of a necessity gain, and
he has not lost all hope of seeing some
active service yet. for there is a rumor
to the effect that the Utah troop may be
sent to Honolulu about the middle of the
fall for garrison duty at that place. This
report has been in general circulation in
the troop for several days, and from all
that can be learned there is excellent
foundation for it.
The route of march to the Yosemite
will take the troopers through the towns
or San Mateo, Redwood City. San Jose,
Gilroy and across the Coast Range to
Madera. in the San Jonquin Valley. Had
the troopers gone to Manila they would
nave gone without their horses, and per
formed duty as infantry. The fact that
they now go with their horses for service
as cavalrymen reconciles the command
to the tour of duty in guarding the res
ervations of the Sierra. The Utah men
will have a delightful outing.

CAMP BARRETT. SATHER STA
TION, July 21.â The camp was thrown
into considerable suppressed excitement
this afternoon by the unexpected arrival
of General R. H. Wartteld, Lieutenant
Colonel J. G. Giesting, assistant
adjutant general; Lieutenant Colo
nel Hansen, brigade surgeon: Major
James Margo, brigade quartermaster, and
Major Charles Jansen. brigade inspector,
all of the Second Brigade. N. G. C.
When all the officers had assembled,
Major Hansen addressed Lieutenant Col
onel F. de L. Carrington. and in a neat
speech presented him with a sword and
belt on behalf of the Second Brigade
staff, N. G. C, as a token of the esteem
and friendship of the staff.
General Warfield and staff had to re
turn to the city before the regimental
parade, so did not see the men drill, but
expressed their pleasure at all they had
seen at the camp.
There is some trouble In camp over the
mails. Many letters will never reach
th-ir destination, owing to a lack of
proper address. The regimental number
and i ompany letter should be on every
envelope, while in addition there should
be the words, "('amp Barrett. Frultvale.
Alameda County, Cal." This will insure
th<- speedy arrival and delivery of all
mail. Many confuse Merritt and Barrett,
thus delaying the mail.
The companies were issued picks, shov
els and axes to-day by Quartermaster
Lieutenant Heller. Field tents and kit
chen utensils will also be distributed im
mediately. It is expected that the regi

of thÂ» month.
Lieutenant Smith, Company L. formerly
captain of the Redding National Guard",

A CHECK ON FREE RIDES.
Presidio Soldiers Must Pay
Streetcar Fare or Present
Passes From Their
Adjutants.
The Presidio and Ferries Railroad Com
pany has so far very generously carried
all soldiers free, but now that about 7000
troops are to be moved from Camp Mer
ritt over to the Presidio, the company
has become alarmed over the prospective
rush. To avoid being swamped, it has
posted a notice in all its cars and in
those of the connecting transfer lines
that on and after to-morrow no free rides
will be allowed to soldiers, except to those
presenting passes from the various ad
jutants. This no doubt will save the
company from thÂ«> expense of purchasing
extra equipment, as It is not likely that
thÂ»- adjutants will issue passes by the
wholesale.
Christian Commission.
The Army and Navy Christian Commis
sion tent at Camp Merritt. arcommodat
ing 1000 persons, has been located with the
Kansas regiment. A tent was erected at
Fort Point yesterday, and another will
be raised to-day within the line* of the
First New York Regiment at the Presidio.
There are about 300 Christian Association
members and a large number of Chris
tian Endeavorers and Epworth Leaguers
in this regiment, and It was at their re
quest that the Christian Commission has
provided a tent for their use.
The ladies of the sewing committee were

THE SA^f FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 22, 5898.
CALIFORNIA'S READY RESPONSE.
Misleading Reports From the War Department
Promptly Corrected by Adjutant
General Barrett.
The facts regarding the number of troops furnished by California
under the first and second calls of the President are fully set forth by
A. W. Barrett. Adjutant General of the State. On July 10, the Ad
jutant General of the United States army in Washington was advised
by wire that the second quota of this State was complete. Yet, aa
late as July 20, reports were given out from the office in Washington
that "California was slow in responding to the second call, having fur
nished only 624 men." The attention of Adjutant General Barrett was
called to these erroneous reports, whereupon he again wired the facts to
Washington and prepared the following statement for publication:
SAN FRANCISCO, July 21, 1898.
Editor of The Call: I notice In the press of yesterday and to-day a
statement purporting to come from the War Department in Washington by
Associated Press dispatches in which it is claimed that California Is slow
to complete her quota under the second call for troops to be mustered into
the I'nited States service. This report gives California's quota as 1016 men,
and it is claimed that only 624 man have been enlisted. The facts of the
case are these: Under the Presidents first call the Secretary of War tele
graphed to the Governor that the number of troops required from California
would be two full regiments and two battalions of infantry and four bat
teries of heavy artillery. These two regiments consisted of twelve companies
each and the two battalions of four companies each, making thirty-two
companies of infantry with eighty-one enlisted men and three officers; and
four batteries of heavy artillery, with 150 enlisted men and four officers. On
May 9. IS9S. the Governor notified tm- Secretary of War as follows:
I have the honor tn report that all California's quota of I'nlted States Volunteers
are rendezvoused In San Francisco. Medical examination will be completed to-day
and muster completed to-morrow. We are ren^- to furnish two m"re eight-company
regiments equlpfxÂ»d an National Guardsmen If needed.
On May 13 the adjutant general of the I'nited States army reported that
instructions had been given to mustering officers to notify the department
In Washington by telegraph when troops were mustered into the I'nited
States service. On May 27 the Secretary of War wired the Governor that
it was estimated that it would require about 1078 enlisted men to fill to the
maximum the organizations already In the service. On May 30 the adjutant
general wired as follows:
T'n<JÂ»r the first call for one hundred and twenty-five thouynnd men It was contem
plated that the number of original onjar.l/.if lors cnlled for should have the maximum
strength stated helow, but on account of additional organizations having to be accepted
this maximum had to be reduced to eighty-one enlisted men per company. The maxi
mum above contemplated Is one hundred .md six enlisted men per company of Infantry,
one hundred vr tr^op of cavalry, on* hundred and seventy-three per ltght battery,
two hundred per heavy battery, one thousand three hundred and twenty-six of all
grmlÂ°s per regiment of Infantry, consisting of three battalions of four companies each.
Secretary cf War bids me t'> say It Is now the wish of the President to supply. In
I woe with the law, so much of tlie second call for seventy-five thousand as may
be ncr --an' to fill organizations already In service from your State to the maxlmu.n
Just stated. The Secretary of War bids me to say that recruiting officers will be .l*
talled t-> make and superintend under army regulations enlistments for this purpose of
the number of men wired yoa May 27. Please name one or more competent field offi
cers of respective raiments already In service from your State to be detailed unjer
orders from War Department for this duty.
ThÂ» Governor Immediately tonk stpps to have the additional recruits un
der the second call for the thirty-two companies of Infantry and the four
batteries of heavy artillery mustered into the volunteer service, giving to eacn
company of infantry twenty-live men. and fifty men to the batteries of
heavy artillerey, making a total of 1000.
On June IS the Secretary of War wired to the Governor of California to
muster in a full regiment of twelve companies which, under the Instruc
tions of the above telegram, consisted of 132*5 enlisted men and officers. The
first battalion of this regiment was rendezvoused at Camp Barrett, Oakland,
on June 2S. the second battalion on June 29 and the third battalion on June
30. On July 10 the following telegram was sent to the adjutant general of
the United States army.
I have the honor to report that California's second quota is now complete a*-d
mustered into the I'nited States service, and the Eighth California Regiment is now
waiting at Camp Barrett ready for active duty. a. W. BARRETT.
Adjutant General California.
It will be seen that California vÂ»as called upon to furnish as her second
quota 2326 enlisted men and officers. Her first call consisted of about 3327
enlisted men and officers, making a total of about 5653 men that have br>cn
furnished by this State to the War Department. There has been furnished
about 10) officers and men from tne Naval Militia for the United States
navy. We have furnished about twenty men and three officers to the signal
service. In addition It Is estimated that about 2000 recruits have been fur
nished to regiments of other States and the regular army which have been
rendezvoused near and around San Francisco.
All of this she has done cheerfully and promptly and stands ready and
anxious to furnish the United States Government several additional regi
ments. Very respectfully. A. W. BARRETT. Adjutant General

tian Association. $6; Lake-avenue Congre
gational Church. Los Angeles, $4 50; Mlz

The transport Â»Fteamer China, which
sailed from San Francisco on June 15 in
company with the Colon, the Senator and
the Zealandla. reached Manila on Satur
day last, one day in advance of the rest
of the fleet. It Is reliably given out that
the China will not return to San Fran
cisco for some time, as Admiral Dewey
hafl decided to attach her to his squad
ron as a dispatch boat, she being capa
ble of making twenty knots an hour. It
is very likely that she will be armed with
a strong battery.

sorts adds 3515 troops to those landed at
Manila by the City of Peking. City of
Sydney and Australia, making a total of
6016 of a land force. The Ohio, City of

MAD ACT OF A BOY.
John Acapoleo Stabs the Man He
Thought "Would Kill His Father.
Believing that his father's life was In
danger, John Acapoleo, an 11-year-old
boy, stabbed Bartholomo Demartinl in
the right breast last evening, while the
father and Demartinl were engaged In
an altercation. The boy was arrested by
Oincer Mahoney and charged at the Cali
fofnla-street station with assault with a
deadly weapon.
The trouble started early In the after
noon, while Pietro A'-apoleo was away
from his carpenter shop, at 7 Gavin place.
A number of boys had been turning on
the water in some houses near there
which were owned by Demartinl. He
warned the boys away, and thinking
young Acapoleo one of the mischievous
boys, had threatened to eat him if he
ever caught him. The boy is of a very
nervous disposition, and the threat of
Demartinl. added to the report that the
man Is crazy, preyed upon the boy's
mind until he was almost hysterical.
On the return of tlve father in the even
ing the occurrence was reported to him,
and he went down to the bakery Demar
tlnt conducts, at his home, and the two
men became engaged In a wordy war,
the principal portion of which consisted
of oaths and hard names. At the begin
ning of this brawl the boy had been at
his father's shop, where some of the
boy's playmates soon went with the re
port that Demartlni was going to kill
Acopoleo senior. The young son, already
considerably excited, rushed to the scene
of the trouble, and perceiving the two
men gesticulating violently, became con
vinced that his father was In danger, and,
thinking to save his life, made an assault
on Demartini with his pocket knife.
The boy when placed in the cell at
the station was greatly agitated, but
when visited by his father, who assured
him he would ball him out before he re
mained there long, he tried to control
himself, and made a brave though vain
attempt. The father returned in a short
time with the information that he could
secure no bail so late. This information
threw the little fellow into a paroxysm
of grief, which the oflicers feared might
result in a derangement of the mind.
After several efforts Mr. Acapoleo suc
ceeded in having the boy released on his
own recognizance.
TBANSPLANTING OF BASS.
Game Fishes Taken From Temescal
and Vallejo Lakes to Cooler
Waters.
Some years ago the Fish Commission
ers planted several game and toothsome
black bass In the small lake near Temes
cal, Berkeley, and also In the sheet of
â water from which Vallejo receives Us
supply. The bass thrived in both lakes,
and anglers who gained permission to
tish In the preserves enjoyed some rare
sport which is now a thing of the past.
Owing to the extremely dry winter the
lakes in question have run very low and
the water being consequently warm tho
bass are dying.
Yesterday the Commissioners ordered
two of their deputies to repair with nets
to Temescal and Vallejo and save as
many of the bass as can be secured allvs.
The "fishes will be placed in cans suitable
for the purpose of transportation and
placed in some of the lakf-s or rivers ot
the State that are considered favorable
for stocking.
The black bass of Russian River, al
though In splendid condition, have a ratti
er unpleasant flavor this year owing prin
cipally to the fact of the fish secret-
Ing themselves under the decayed lum
ber which Imparts to them a taste oi
the redwood.
John Gallagher creeled two baas onMon.
day last which scaled respectively four
and a half and three and a quarter
pounds.
Black bass fishing In Rodeo Lake Is
said to be very good this year. Frank
Dolliver and John Butler made a very

THE STREET COMMITTEE.
Several Matters of Public Interest
Considered Yesterday by the '
Supervisors.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday and considered
the protest of M. H. de Young against
the further maintenance of : turntable
by the Geary street railroad in front of
the Chronicle building. Mr. de Young and
his attorney. Reuben H. Lloyd, objected
to having the turntable longer remain in
front of the building, declaring it to be a
nuisance, and one that endangers the
lives and limbs of pedestrians.
"The company has been promising for
the last six years " saifl Lloyd "to re
move the turntable, but all we have re
ceived is promises. "
The representatives of the company
said that they were now planning to re
move the turntable and were granted two
weeks further time in which to remove it.
Protests against the paving of Broder
ick street, between Post and Geary, and
Garden avenue, between Devisadero and
Broderick streets, were favorably report
ed upon by the committee.
The matter ot granting the Southern
Pacific i 'iimpany the right to substitute
double tracks for the single track now ex
tending from Third and T. >wnsend streets
to Ocean View was postponed, pending an
examination of the ground by the Street
Committee to ascertain if the project is
feasible.

city and county reported tha'. thi work
of designating the political affiliations of
the eligibles had not been completed. In
asmuch as Mayor Phelan is absent from
the city and will not return before to
morrow evening, it was decided to lay the
matter over until Monday morning at 9
o'clock, when the precinct registration of
ficers will be named.
Registrar Biggy reported that registra
tion was exceedingly slow this year. Only
14.CJ0 out of a possible 74,000 voters have
thus far registered. Registration will
close at the main office on August 8, and
those who are awaiting the nrecinct reg
istration will be put to many Inconveni
ences. The registration at the office in
the new City Hall is so slow that it
would appear but little interest is being
taken in the coming campaign. Notwith
standing the fact that the office is kept
open until 9 o'clock at night to accommo
date those who are unable to get there
during the daytime, the registration does
not average more than 300 a day.

WILLS FILED FOR PROBATE.
Unique Statement of Louis R. Town
send â Mrs. Mary Dalton's
Estate.
The will of Louis R. Townsend, the
architect of 515 California street, who
died in this city on the 6th inst., was
filed for probate yesterday. Although thÂ«
esr.-ite of the decedent is valued at only
$3110, he was fearful that its disposition
might not be made in accordance with his
wishes and in his will states: "I want
no technicalities raised, and I do not wish
any Insanity dodge raised, either, for I
am sound physically and mentally. I am
a single man, and wholly free to make
such disposition of whatever I leave."
The testator leaves a number of military
gifts and medals to Company B. First
Regiment, N. G. C and the balance of
his property is distributed among friends
and relatives. His daughter, May V.
Townsend. is sole executrix.
The will of Mary Dalton was also filed
for probate. She bequeathed an estate
valued at $1300 to her two sons, Michael
and Richard Dalton.

ALWAYS FIRST WIThJ NEWS.
1"""O have the news first, and to have the correct
news, is the purpose of The Call. That it is
living up to this ideal of what a paper should
be every reader of dailies can testily. Of late there
have been many notable instances demonstrating
this. There are at least minor instances in every
issue.
The great battle of Manila was first detailed in this
paper, of all papers on the coast. The account writ
ten by The Call correspondent from notes he had
taken during the turmoil of conflict as he stood on the
bridge with the immortal Dewey is the best, the most
finished and picturesque that has yet been written.
It has been complimented everywhere, and its value
is attested b}' the mention made by Dewey of the
correspondent. He was there. lie heard the thun
der of the guns. He was stilled in the smoke of the
cannon, and in vivid language he portrayed the inci
dents of the engagement. For days there was no
other account There were no other correspondents
to observe, and when they finally sent in their stories
the stories were secondhand, piecemeal.
Months ago an expedition was sent to the relief of
whalers imprisoned in the ice. The relation of their
rescue, the difficulty of reaching them, was set forth
in these columns Monday of this week. Thursday
lagging contemporaries told similar tales of Arctic
adventure, apparently confident they were telling
something new. But the information was stale. They
might have clipped it from the columns of this paper
and presented it Tuesday, thus scooping themselves by
forty-eight hours. They might have held back their
presses for a copy of The Call. and given the story
only tardy by a few hours, thus following a precedent
set by the Examiner.
A few days ago, after city papers had been sent to
press, the peninsula was shaken by a mighty explo
sion. Word quickly reached the office that a Chinese
murderer, having taken refuge in a powder store
house, had blown it up, together with himself and
seven other people. Seldom has an event more
startling been chronicled. A complete account ap
peared in The Call, and, of course, nowhere else.
People were not surprised. They are becoming ac
customed to such exhibitions of enterprise. The say
ing of these thinps is only prompted by the appre
ciation the public has shown. People want the news,
The Call gives it. Particularly ever since the begin
ning of the war the superiority of our news service
has been marked, and so will it be to the end, but the
examples of this are too numerous to cite. As a
rule, the news columns speak for themselves. Occa
sionally we cannot refrain from joining the public in
commending them.
WELLS-FARGO AND WAR.
TO be forced to announce that the Wells-Fargo
Express Company still persists in its scheme to
evade payment of its share of the war tax is not
a pleasant duty. It had been hoped tnat its course
was inadvertent, that when attention had been called
to the circumstance that its action was both illegal
and unpatriotic it would hasten to correct its policy.
The hope was vain. The corporation has been given
time to demonstrate that it is selfish to the core, cares
nothing for the protection the Government throws
about it, takes no note of the fact that by reason of
the war it has an increased revenue.
But since Wclls-Fargo, having been pointed the
way to lead a better life, has refused to make amove in
the proper direction, there remains the duty of lend
ing it an impetus sufficient to carry it out of the ways
of sin. Merchants of Los Angeles have already taken
steps to lead the erring corporation to a sense of its
unrighteousness. They object, reasonably, to paying,
in addition to their own taxes, the tax the Govern
ment meant the wealthy corporation to pay and have
started the matter in the direction of the courts.
There will be both civil and criminal proceedings.
Merchants of San Francisco take a similar view of
the position of the company, and the company will
soon realize this. There is no excuse for delay in the
making of a test case.
United States District Attorney Foote seems in
clined to hold back and let a precedent be estab
lished elsewhere. There is no better place than within
his jurisdiction for the establishing of a precedent.
Every day action is deferred means an additional gain
to the corporation, and, possession being so many
points of the law, all the money unlawfully wrested
from the public will be devoted to the swelling of
Wells-Fargo dividends, and not a cent be returned to
the public, from which it is being taken without war
rant of statute or equity. Mr. Foote should press the
matter at once. There are other corporations need
ing a lesson, but this express company, being the
most flagrant offender, might profitably be employed
as the necessary '"terrible example."
The Cubans have a new sorrow. They are not peT
mitted to loot a city conquered by American arms and
at the sacrifice of American life. Naturally they are
puzzled.
FRANCHISE TAXATION.
' I 'HE regular annual discussion concerning the
i taxation of corporation franchises, which closed
a few days ago before the Board of Supervisors,
has elicited the usual amount of wisdom from the
$30,000 contract railroad organ and the statesmen
who achieve fame in its columns. Undivided atten
tion this year has been given to the bonded indebted
ness of the street railways of San Francisco, especial
attention having been paid to the Market street com
pany, which is always the "horrible example" of our
municipal system. The principles which are found
to exempt this corporation from confiscatory taxa
tion, it has been contended, are of general applica
tion.
Mayor Phelan, for whom taxation demagogy has
many charms, has claimed in a letter to Assessor
Siebe that the assessment placed upon the Market
street system is inadequate. The property of the com
pany has been valued by Mr. Siebe at $3,206,000, and
its franchise at $2,500,000. The Mayor asks the As
sessor pointedly what has become of the company's
bonded indebtedness of $14,000,000, and he attempts
to answer his own question by calling attention to
the fact that the bonds are not assessed at all. The
Mayor's letter to the Assessor is heartily indorsed by
the contract organ, which lays down the broad propo
sition that, judged by its bonded indebtedness and
the value of its stock, the corporation in question is
not being assessed at above two bits on the dollar.
This is all the veriest buncombe. Both Mayor
Phelan and the organ know that the constitution and
statutes expressly exempt from taxation the bonds of
all railroad and other quasi-public corporations. The
theory is that the property is represented by the bonds,
and if the former is assessed that will be sufficient.
With mortgages it is different. They are treated as
an interest in the property affected and assessed to
their owners. The difficulty of following up bonds
and assessing them to their holders evidently induced
the constitution makers to abandon, in the case of
railroads and other quasi-public corporations, the rule
set up concerning mortgages.
Nor is the market value of their bonds a safe cri
terion for valuing the property of corporations. The
San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway was
bonded for a million dollars; in fact it cost over a
million to build it. Yet when foreclosure came it
sold for $350,000. Would it have been just for the
Assessor to have assessed that corporation upon the
value of its bonded indebtedness? Had he done so
he would have wrecked the company long before its
time.
The market value of corporation bond 3is more or
less speculative. It is based upon temporary interest
paying power, future prospects, schemes of improve
ment, etc. Railroads often mortgage their property
for more than it is worth. So do individuals. Al
though the savings banks aim to loan not over 50
per cent upon real estate, they are often unable to
realize the amount of their loans and interest on
foreclosure.
What does all this argue? It simply argues that it
is the duty of the Assessor to assess street railway
property at its "cash value," namely, the amount it
would be taken for in payment of a debt by a sol
vent creditor from a solvent debtor. A rule for valu
ing franchises has been laid down by the Supreme
Court. The difference between the market value of
the stock on the first Monday in March and the value
placed upon the tangible property represents the
franchise. We understand that this rule is followed
by Assessor Siebe in valuing franchises in this city,
notwithstanding the organ and Mayor Phelan's at
tempt to make it appear otherwise.
FOREST ARSON.
THE dryness of the mountains this summer has
contributed to the spread of the most destruc
tive forest fires that have ever wasted one of
California's most valuable resources. From Folsom
to Forest Hill these fires have raged in a great semi
circle that embraces millions of acres of first-class
timber, and other millions on which grew promising
young forest, the timber resource of the future. To
the northward of this area the same process of waste
has been at work, but nothing has been said about it
all, except when a rancher has lost stock and build
ings, or a miner or woodchopper has lost his corded
wood. These losses that are mentioned are but the
smallest fraction of the total sacrifice of the common
wealth. The soil being so dry, the fire has not only de
stroyed the standing timber and the chaparral, which
is the nurse of young timber, but has followed the
roots into the ground and baked the crust of the
earth, leaving it as barren of tree germs as the hard
floor of a brickyard.
It is safe to say that before the autumn rains
quench these conflagrations the loss to the State will
equal the year's product of gold from her mines. If
a common calamity should stop every quartz and
placer mine in the State for a year, and stop the year's
output of gold, men would groan over the misfortune.
But, after all, it would be the loss of one year's
product only. The gold would be left in the gravel
and the ledges for future development. Not so when
fire sweeps the forest. It destroys the wealth that
nature has been storing for a century and cuts off the
crop for a century to come by destroying the forest
producing capacity of the soil, which is baked into
barrenness.
The cause of it is criminal carelessness, as a rule.
Campers and hunters, herders and shepherds, go into
the mountains and use fire without a thought of the
consequences of letting it get beyond their control.
They move on from the night's camp leaving its fire
to smoulder and spread. There seems no way of im
pressing them with the gravity of forest arson. They
see the mighty flames they have kindled and the piti
ful destruction they have wrought without an emotion
of remorse or regret.
It is time to put a stop to this crime. Hundreds
of thousands of dollars are spent in our cities in
policing them to prevent the robber)' of houses,
banks and stores. Yet all the losses by burglary in
ten years, if there were no police, would not equal
the waste of one summer week by mountain fires.
The Legislature should provide for the care of our
forests before it is too late. It is not a task of in
surmountable difficulty. Many roads lead from the
valleys to the foothills. Fewer reads Jead from the
foothills into the mountains. A mounted patrol
should be maintained on every mountain road. These
patrols should be mountain men, not the dregs of city
politics. They should be armed and determined.
Two on each forty miles of each mountain road
should patrol half of it every day. They should have
authority to register every camping party and all
herdsmen and shepherds as they pass the patrol sta
tion, get their itinerary, direct their camping location,
caution and instruct them about fires and arrest them
for defiance or neglect. These patrols should be in
telligent enough to make stated reports of what has
occurred on their beats, the names of all parties that
have passed in or out and the object of their pres
ence in the mountains. When a fire starts every one
responsible for a camp fire near its origin should be
halted and held for inquiry, and when guilt is fixed
THE BAIST FKANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1898.
there should be sure punishment, no matter who the
guilty one is.
We would be glad to impress the importance of this
matter upon the people. A continuance, unchecked,
of these forest fires in the mountains means a change
in our climate, the dehydrating of the soil of the
valleys, and finally the conversion of the State into
a desert.
All this is experience, not theory. The several
stages in the process have been undergone in Mon
tenegro and on the Austrian shores of the Adriatic,
in the Vosges Mountains in France, in the Bavarian
Tyrol and in many other parts of the world. We
may heed the lesson they teach and be wise in time,
or we may be foolish and wasteful in our day and
generation and become the curse of our near pos
terity.
WHERE STANDS THE TURK?
SINCE the war with Spain began an incessant
stream of dispatches, overflowing from the
press morning and afternoon, have kept us in
formed of the tone of public sentiment concerning us
in London, Berlin, Paris, Rome, St. Petersburg and
Vienna. We have not needed for advices concerning
the sentiment of Madrid. We know what all these
capitals think, or at least what they are saying. We
live and move and have our being in that knowledge.
We are animated by the consciousness that all Europe
talks of us, and there are some of us who are prouder
of that than they are of our May day at Manila or the
Glorious Fourth at Santiago.
To our cup of bliss there is, however, one drop
lacking. There is one capital from which we have
not heard, and in many respects it is the most impor
tant capital in the world. It is a city where the public
sentiment is always unique, and where the sympathies
of the people, ever inspired by black-eyed girls and
lemonade, are continually fervent and unceasingly in
terested in love-making and bloodshed. We have
never yet been informed of the tone of the prevailing
sentiment of Constantinople â the city of the Grand
Turk.
This gap in our knowledge of the sympathies of the
nations is vast and portentous. Of what avail is it
to tell us what Great Britain or France or Germany
or Russia is likely to do to us when we have finished
with Spain and then leave us ignorant of the course
the Sublime Porte has mapped out for himself and
his bashibazouks? How shall we know what to do
or what to leave undone until we are informed of
what is being plotted between drinks of cool sherbets
and the dances of Circassian girls, beneath the fretted
domes and gilded ceilings of the council chamber of
the Yildiz kiosk?
It is all very well to send from Europe, day after
day, iterated and reiterated reports of what says
Kaiser William and his Grace of Salisbury and the
exuberant Chamberlain, but what the American peo
ple yearn to know is, Where stands the Turk? What
thinks Abdul Hamid, brother of the crescent moon
and lord of the sanguinary scimiter?
When reports of the opinions and possible inter
ferences in the war of foreign powers are being cir
culated around it is absurd to leave out those of Con
stantinople. The Sultan has as much right to be
heard and reported as any Czar, Kaiser or Prime
Minister. It is true there are no newspapers of note
in his kingdom to be quoted, but there are many
tongues, and surely they have said something. It can
not be that the Turks have ignored us and thought
only of opium and their newest wives. When they
had wars we talked much of them. and even gave them
advice, printed pictures of them and wrote poetry
on their deeds. For them, therefore, to pay no at
tention to us now in our war would be an impolite
ness of which it is impossible to believe a Sultan or
his people would be guilty.
Clearly the Grand Turk has some opinion of this
war between Christian nations. Did 1 not the Chris
tians stop his wars? Shall he not now feel inclined
to return the compliment by stopping Christian wars?
If there is to be any interference will he not fight
and flesh again the swords that have grown rusty
since the battles with the Greeks? Therefore it is
time we were told where he stands; on which side
he sympathizes; whether his braves are applauding
when they see the stars and stripes, or whether he
has given orders that none but red and yellow roses
shall be brought to bloom this year in the gardens of
Gul.
If he is on our side we are all right and need have
no fears about a European concert. The Sultan has
had experience with such things. He can teach us
how to make them as futile as the attempt of a man
with tallow legs to walk through Hades.
TRAVELING LIBRARY WORK-
REPEATEDLY of late we have directed atten
tion to the benefits resulting from the traveling
library system in operation in several of the
Eastern States, and now return to the subject, because
the New York State Library has just issued a report
which in a striking manner shows the usefulness of
the system to the general public.
The proof of the usefulness is the growing popular
demand for the books which the State library circu
lates. The report states that during the twelve
months covered by it the library sent out 3000 per
cent more books to institutions, students and general
readers than in 1889. A development of that kind is
something stupendous. It is one of the facts that im
press even the most indifferent mind. With such an
increase of circulation as that no one can any longer
question that American communities desire access to
standard books, and that State libraries are virtually
buried unless they are used as storerooms from which
the people of all parts of the State can obtain the
works they need in their studies.
In commenting upon this proof of the widespread
demand for books and upon what the State library
has accomplished in meeting the demand, the report
says: "While we are so much gratified with what has
recently been accomplished in this great field, those
who best understand its possibilities realize that this
work is now only well begun. The public are de
manding more and more because they are learning
that it is possible through the State library and home
education department to secure more help education
ally than has ever before been afforded by an equal
expenditure of time and money."
The record is indeed one of which the New York
State Library may be proud and on which the people
of that State may be congratulated. California should
be roused by it to vigorous emulation. We have a
people as intelligent as those of New York and a
State library second to none in the Union. With us,
however, there is no connection between the library
and the reading public. The use of the books has not
increased with us 3000 per cent since 1889. It is even
doubtful if it has increased 3 per cent. We need a
traveling library system even more than New York
needs it. and the trustees of the State Library should
take steps to provide one.
An evening paper announces in impressive type
that the Washington authorities will stand no "non
sence" from the Cubans. No wonder they won't.

terial reduction.
In March last articles of incorporation
were filed by the San Francisco Milk
Dealers' Association, of which Jean L.
Vermeil of the X L Dairy is president
and Edwin A. Green, manager of the Mill
brae Company, is secretary. The asso
ciation was made up of the principal
JOYS THAT COME WITH CHEAP MILK.
dairies, Including Ewell's, Miller's, Mill
brae Company, X L and Millbrae Dairy.
It was expected that through co-operation
the expenses of delivery would be greatly
reduced and the saving thus made would
warrant a material reduction in price.
At the present time hundreds of wagons
are required for the delivery of milk.
These wagons cover an immense territory
and cross one another's paths at frequent
intervals. One man will deliver milk in a
oertain block and may not have another
customer within a mile. Under the pro- ;
posed system the city will be districted ;
and only the necessary number of wagons
required to cover any district will be as- j
signed to it. The reduction will, it is be- I
lleved, equal over half the present force, j
The plan as outlined calls for depots in j
various portions of the city. The milk will ,
be sent to them from the dairies and then |
distributed.
In this merging of the various interests j
many unnecessary men will be dispensed i
with. The benefits obtained will all ac- '
crue to the consumers, who will thus see
the realization of their long-deferred
hopes for cheaper but none the less purer
milk.
I'nderlying this movement is said to bo
a desire to crowd to the wall those deal
ers who for three years past have been
retailing milk for 5 cents a quart. From (
the outset it has been affirmed that pure
milk cannot be delivered at that price, j
During that period the inspectors repre
sent Ing the Health Department have been
unusually active. Hardly a day passed I
without their taking samples of the milk j
yet they have never found adulterated I
milk in the possession of the representa
tives of the better class of dairies now
handling 5-cent milk.
I Ryder, vice-president of the Santa
Clara Milk Company, is one of the pion
neers in the movement for cheaper milk.
"It was in October. 1595, that we cut the
retail price of milk in half," said Mr.
Rider yesterday. "From that day to this
we have had the bitterest opposition from
the men who desired the price maintain- |
cd. We have been successful from the
start and the result has heen that the
others have had to cut their prices in
order to compete with us. At the pres
ent time, although their price is supposed
to be a fixed one, such is not the case.
They will accept any amount, from $1 50 I
to $3, in order to hold a customer. Our i
system was to sell for cash, and having
our money in hand we had to meet no
losses from bad bills. Our sales in
creased at once and we have been able to
hold our own ever since. Our success has
had the effect of awakening the opposi
tion to a realization that trade was slip
ping away from them and their present
move is undoubtedly an effort to enter
our field and crowd us out. If they could
succeed in their efforts they could force
prices back to their old place again.
"They have always claimed that wo
could not deliver pure milk at 5 cents a
quart. I think the best refutation -of this
aesertion is that although samples of om
milk are taken almost daily -ye have yet
to hear a complaint from thu Inspectors
representing the Health Department. At
present we are charging 6 cents a quart
for milk, as the producers have raisefl
their pricea temporarily. This is neces
sary owing to the high prices that aro
now paid for feed. When that becomea
more plentiful and in consequence cheap
er, the price will go down at once."
Edwin A. Green, manager of the Mill
brae Company, is secretary of the new
corporation and, according to his friends,
will be its manager when the organiza
tion is effected. "This matter is still in
embryo," said Mr. Green yesterday. "We
have practically not advanced beyond ths
preliminary stage of incorporation ana
have no plan for future operations out
lined. For nearly ten years we have been
trying to get together in an effort to con
duct the milk business on the more mofi
ern lines in vogue in New York and other
Eastern cities. If our plans fill out It
will mean reduced expanse in the hand
ling of the milk and this will warrant a
reduction in price, which is sure to fol
low. When this can be effected is a
question. It will take some time at the
best."

day an announcement was made to every
habitue of the Palace Hotel that there
â was a parrot on the fifth floor that could
be had for the asking. The news spread
faster than electricity, and in less than
an hour at least 100 soliciting parrot
maniacs applied for ownership rights over
the green-feathered bird. Perhaps the
reason of this anxiety to possess the talk
ing creature is due to the reputation tho
bird bears. It was spoken of as a terroi
that never let a word that could be founu
in decent literature pass its mouth. What
ever the impelling force that drove so
many applicants into the Palace to secure
the parrot the fact remains that a steady
stream of strangers and hotel frequent
ers were out after that living object.
And they all had a "run for their money."
First the hotel clerk would direct them
to the fifth floor. The bell boy would then
play his hand and the parrot-seeker woulu
be sent to the thirTl floor. Miles of ter
ritory would be covered and when at last
a person was found who would acknowl
edge possession of the parrot the visitor
was told that he must have a cage to
deport it. Out of the hundred applicants
at least sixty toured the hotel. Even tho
"unbunkoable" hotel clerk fell a victim
to the parrot-chasing disease. Three o*
them, distinguished looking gentlemen in
gray, the young and handsome and beau
tifully mustached clerk who goes East
on a vacation every year, and the gen
tle, polite and obliging night clerk wero
on the . lookout for that parrot. Heated
arguments were bandied back and ortn
as to who rightly deserved the parrot.
Finally word came down from the fiftn
floor that if any one brought a suitable
cage or anything that answered the pur
pose of a cage they could have the par
rot. The clerks on duty fell over one
another to find something for the do.
portation of the bird. Coal oil cans with
holes punched in them was the substitute
they discovered. The three rushed to
floor five, the cans rattling as they passed
in whirlwind fashion through the halls.
The bell boy on that floor rolled over In
a spell of uncontrollable laughter. There
was no parrot. It was his little joko.
"Ha ha's" now exude from the Palace.
Just ask one of those clerks if he wants
a parrot.

LOOKS BUCK
FOR LOCHNER
Police Are Morally Cer
tain of His Guilt.
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WEAK
LIZZIE BILEY AND PRIEUR
CONTRADICT HIM.
Comparison of Statements in Carpen
ter Case Bring Out Points
Against the
Suspect.
Evidence strong: enough to enable thorn
to formally charge Joe Lochner with the
murder of Sadie Carpenter has not as
yet been secured by the police, but every
new development in this mysterious case
increases the belief of those workins on
it that he is the strangler. Captain Sey
mour refuses to express any opinion as to
Lochner's guilt or innocence. He is mak
ing every effort to run down the fiend
and he will place what evidence he ob
tains before the Coroner next Monday.
Whether Lochner will be held for pre
liminary examination depends on the
Coroner's jury.
Lochner made a statement Sunday
which is now causing him considerable
worry, and is considered a point against
him. In regard to the words used by
Lizzie Riley, when she gave the alarm
that something was wrong in room 10 he
is flatly contradicted by the woman and
Night Clerk Prleur. Lochner says that
when he came to his door in response to
the clerk's knock Lizzie said: "Something
is wrong in Sadie's room. I heard a
nol.se like some one being choked." She
declares positively that she said nothing
about strangling or choking, but did say:
"There i.s trouble in one of tho rooms; I
think in Sadie's," etc. Lochner persists
however, that she ustil the word choking.
I'rieur, the night clerk, also contradicts
the suspect and asserts that Lizzie's ver
si'>n of what was said is correct.
This is significant, in the opinion of the
police, and they say it is a slip on the part
of Lochner which Bhows that he knew
the woman had been strangled.
chief Lees and Captain Seymour are
now convinced that the noise Lizzie Rlloy
heard was made by the bed being pushed
out from the door between Lochner's
room and -â Irs. Carpenter's. In her tirst
statement to the police, Lizzie said the
noise which attracted her attention sound
ed like "rolling a spool of thread across
the floor."
Yesterday afternoon Chief Lees and
Captain Seymour made several tests in
room 10. Lizzie Riley went into the room
she occupied on Saturday night. The bed
was then moved out from the wall a few
times, and she declared the noise was ex
actly the same as she had heard before
she heard the door slam and footsteps re
ceding. This is also considered a strong
point against Lochner.
While the officers were In the Hubbard
House yesterday they made another
thorough search of rooms 9, 10 and 11 and
the closets. Carpets were taken up and
shaken, the dust was swept up and care
fully sifted and examined. Nothing bear-
Ing upon the tragedy was found.
Still another point against Lochner is
contained in the statement by Landlord
Raulet, of the Hubbard House. He was
about the 'halls from 12 o'clock to 12A5
Saturday night. Just before leaving he
went to the hallway leading to rooms
9, 10 and 11 to see if the gas was burn
ing in Lochner's room. The landlord had
warned him several times about wasting
gas. but he persisted in keeping a light
long after he went to his room. The land
lord swears that there was no light in
Lochner's. Mrs. Carpenter's or Lizzie
Riley's room. This is taken as conclusive
proof that Sadie received no visitor after
Lochner left her at 11:30. After his in
vestigation the landlord went downstairs
and stood at the street door for fifteen
minutes. No one entered or came out
of the house while he stood there.
When Lizzie Riley first called tho night
clerk he was standing in the hallway talk
ing with Thomas McDonough, who oc
cupies room 4. Both declare they did not
see or hear any one passing out of the
house.
All these incidents occurred between
12:45 and 1:15, during which time Lizzie
Riley thinks she heard the choking sound
and "the door slam.
For unspeakable depravity Lochner Is
the worst specimen the police of the city
have ever had to deal with. He is wholly
lacking in moral sensibility, and it is
quite possible he is the murderer of Sadie
Carpenter. Notwithstanding he is a
descendent of one of the first families in
Bavaria he has sunk to a depth which is
beyond belief. He served with distinction
in "the Franco-Prussian War and received
medals for bravery. His name Is Joseph.
Freiherr yon Lochner and his rank i.s just
above a baron. He came to California in
1876, and was married some time later in
Sacramento. Some years ago his wife
secured a divorce from him. His father
is still living at the advanced age of S6.
and is very wealthy. Joe is the eldest
son, but the blnek sheep of the family.
Lochner Is a nervous wreck and cannot
sit or stand still an instant. His muscles
twitch constantly and he is growing very
thin and haggard. He has lost fully ten
pounds since his incarceration.
Ha exnressed srreat satisfaction yester
day when told that Carpenter had been
found, but later he was informed that a
Utter purporting to come from Carpenter
had been received from Los Gatos and
published in a morning paper, but it was
not Known who the writer was. This de
pressed him.
Chief Lees wired Constable Reynolds to
look up Carpenter, if he was there, and
bring him to this city, but did not re
ceive a reply up to midnight.
Lochner was under a fire of cross-ex
amination all day yesterday, but he stuck
tv his original story of the tragedy. Last
night he was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital and given a narcotic to settle his
nerves.
Joe still asserts that he left Mrs. Car
penter's room at 11:30 Saturday night, and
closed the door so that the spring lock
caught. It is strange that Lizzie Riley
did not hear him, as it requires consider
able force to close the door and it is
necessary to give it a hard slam before
the bu!t will go into the socket.
J. B. Williams, whose letter to Sadit
was published yesterday morning, called
at police headquarters and gave, a satis
factory account of himself. He was in
Alameda Saturday night. He says he
never met Mrs. Carpenter and that she
did not answer his letter:.

REPUBLICANS OT7T FOR SAN
FRANCISCO.
State Committee to Fix the Time and
Place for the State Conven
tion at a Meeting to Be
Held To-Morrow.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the Republican State Central Com
mittee will be held at 2 p. m. to-day at j
headquarters In the Palace Hotel for the j
purpose of making necessary prepara
tions for a general meeting of the State
Committee to-morrow. At the meeting
to-morrow the time and place for holding
the State convention will be fixed, and
also the apportionment of delegates
thereto.
A meeting of prominent citizens of this
city has been called for this morning for
the purpose of devising ways and means
to bring the convention here. Arrange
ments for raising the required funds to
defray the cost of hall rent, clerk hire,
printing and other incidental expenses of
the convention will be perfected, and
every effort will be made to secure the
convention for San Francisco.
That Sim Francisco Is the proper place
to hold the convention is conceded by a
majority of the members of the State
Committee, and If the citizens get to
gether and offer satisfactory inducements
there Is no apparent reason why the con
vention should not be held here.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 21.â There was no relief to
the undeviating quietude of the stock market
to-day. A few of the industrial specialties
â were pushed up on considerations individual
to the stock. The strength of these had some
sympathetic effect on the list, stocks which
showed an appreciation in price on a very
email volume of dealings. Not all of these
grains â¢"â â¢â re held, but prices at the close showed
email net gains as a rule. Rubber, Leather,
Metropolitan, Lead and Cotton Oil were all ad- j
vanced quite materially, and there were a few |
of the railroad stocks which rose as much as
a point. London was a small buyer on bal- !
ance. The hesitation in the wheat market had
Its reaction in the stock market though the
fact is now accepted that we are to have a !
â wheat crop of unprecedented proportions. Of :
rather more significance was to-day's report |
that there were prospects of a very large crop
of Roumanian wheat, supplementing yester
day's report of an expected heavy Increase in
the French crop. Prices for the future de- :
liveries of wheat show a tendency to spread
from the prices : . Ins at the corresponding !
period last year, the active speculation in the
coming crop at this time* last year being in
full foÂ»:e w.th rer<rts of damage to European
crops azi tie jr^r^ctlve heavy shortage. To
day's price for the September delivery in New
York is siÂ»r=i 7 cÂ«nts under the price for the
comspoa&isg ;<r:Kl fcr last year. The in
terrufte<i ml ncvement already shows signs
of recovery, ari a. go>i export demand gives
hope that prtse^; prices will be well main
tained and the movement of the new crop con
tinued, sterling exchange was reduced *Â» In
the actual rates to-<iay under the influence of
grain and cotton bills in the market and there
was no hardening trniency in the money mar- j
ket. The pressure of investment funds was !
conspicuous in the bond market to-day, notabiy
for highly secured bonds of reorganized roads.
Very heavy blocks of the Union Pacific ami the
At' hi.- n It were taken. There was alFo a !
movement in speculative bonds, Wisconsin Is !
being the leading example. This bond appre
ciated % per cent and reacted sharply on profit, >
taking, but hardened again before the close. I
Total sales, J4, Â£10.000.
The new Government 3s rose to 104% to-day
on demand attributed to the banks for pur- i
poses of circulation. The profit in circulation ;
with these bonds over that by the use of the I
4s of 1925 has a margin still remaining with I

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 21.â The Evening: Post's

j Americans were inclined to be good to-day ana |
! were above the New York parity. Grand Trunk j
was also fairly well maintained in spite of the I
lack of confirmation of the rate war settlement.
; Cheap money is bringing new Investments,
i but with a rush, and the business is being
overdone. There are indications In the ex
change market that a decline in American ex
change is looked for. Brazils were better. De
tails of the gold movement for the week show
the sale of Â£171.000 in German coin, the export
of Â£88.000 to the Continent and the receipt of
Â£111.000 from South America and of Â£66,000
from Portugal. .

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
' CHICAGO, July 21.â Favorable weather and
excellent crop reports from the Middle States
started wheat weak for September and
cember futures. No business was done In
July the first half hour of the session and
when at the end of that time a small lot wan
wanted there was none forthcoming until it j
waa bid up to SOc or 2*Â« c above the price it
: closed at -Â»sterday. Such scarcity of wheat
for this month's delivery, with ten days left to
bring It from the country, gave September j
shorts a disagreeable shock. They lost confi
dence in immediate lower prices and boughv. ;
as much as possible under the disadvantage
of very Fmall offerings. September shows a
lofs of December left off "jc lower.
The closing quotations from Paris showed !
Juiy wheat there extremely heavy, the reduc
1 tion In price being equal to 6Â»ic a bushel and
September-December was down the equiva
lent of I'hC a b-jfih*-!. That changed the tem
per of the trade here. The feeling at once
turned from the bull to the bear side and the
t-ar.sh features of the early news began to i
receive recognition. Chicago receipts were 63 |
â  ars. or thirty less than expected. The total
receipts at Western primary markets were 1
441.000 bushels.
Showers where they were needed badly and
the failure of the predicted frost in Northern 1
at caused heaviness to be the ruleforcorn. !
1 ThÂ« downward tendency was accelerated by j
â  enormous receipts. Shippers were without
I workable bids and the bulls were content to
await another dry scare before adding to pre
vious holdings. Another bearish factor was a .
tl n of showers everywhere West. South
west and Northwest to-night and to-morrow. ;
September declined 'ifl^c on the day.
In oats good buying r>y professionals and an |
Improved demand for the caah article held fu- i
tures steady. September left off unchanged.
The decline In corn and lower prices for
hogs at the yards depressed provisions. Various
reports as to the yellow fever situation kept
outsiders from entering the market and pack
Â». Â« r v;Â»rf not disposed to do much. Pork and
ribs quit T'^c lower. I.ard Is Be down.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Hay was easy again, owing to receipts' of
i 836 tons, though there was no decline worthy of
note. The market Is unusually sensitive this
year, and is weak one day and firm the next,
1 according as arrivals are heavy or light. The
' general plane of values, however, remains
! about the same, day after day. While the deal
ers themselves are all at sea regarding the fu
ture course of the market, It seems to be the
j general opinion that prices will not vary vio
lently, one way or the other, for some weeks,
; though this, of course, Is mere guesswork.

JUPORS AT
LAST FIND
A VERDICT
Chung Had Access to
the Gunpowder
Magazine.
NO FACTS AS TO QUANTITY
PRESIDENT LTTKENS IS NOT

Some Jurors Suggested That There
Was Altogether Too Much
Freedom in Entering
the Magazine.
We, the jury, do find that deceased
came to his death at the Western
Fuse and Explosives Company's
works, Melrose, Alameda County, at j
at about 5:20 o'clock a. m.. July 19,
1898, and that death was caused by
injuries due to the explosion of pow
der in the magazine of said works,
with murderous intent, by one Chi
nese named Quong Chung, an em
ploye of said powder company, who
had free access to said powder mag
azine.

After a visit to the scene of the explo
sion this morning and the taking of some
additional testimony, the Coroner's jury
arrived a,t the above verdict in the case
of each of the seven victims of the fright- j
ful catastrophe of last Tuesday morning. i
On returning from the scene a short ses- i
sion was held by the jurors, and President |
F. G. Lukens of the fuse works was called i
to testify. He was asked questions re- !
garding the amount of powder In the
magazine, but stated that he could not
tell anything definite, as such matters
were left to the superintendent.
D. S. Barrett was one of the men who
accompanied Sheriff White when he went
around the neighborhood on the evening ;
before the explosion warning the resi
dents of their danger. He testified that j
they warned Mrs. Hall, but that she was
obdurate and said she would not leave the ;
house in which she was living 1 Barrett !
stated 'hat after taking- Mrs. Hall from '
the ruins she lived a little time and died j
in the house of John Stephenson.
We Puck, the Chinese boss, told of the i
conversation he had with Quong Chung j
on the evening before the explosion. He
said he had known Chung for twenty
years and was sent for as soon as the j
fellow took refuge in the magazine. He ;
then proceeded to relate the details of the I
conversation as told on the stand last
night by Secretary Pittmann. He said he

The flght between the Insurance De

I gave Quong $10 in gold voluntarily as a
bribe to bring him out, no one having told
him to do so.
Fong Hlng told the lury that he had
worked In the fuse works for eight years
and had often been in the magazine, al
though his duties did not require him to
do so. Several/ questions were asked him
by jurors, which tended to show that the
magazine was always easy of acefss by
employes. The testimony Bhowed that the
powder as it was needed was taken from
the magazine two or three times a day
and that the door was nearly always
, open. Some of the jurors were evidently
of the opinion that the catastrophe might
have been avoided had the magazine been
kept locked. Joe Ling, the last witness,
said he had worked In the fuse factory for
three months and had never been in the
magazine.
After deliberating nearly an hour the
jury returned with their verdict.
A PUBLIC FUNERAL.
Public Offices and Stores Are
to Close During the
Obsequies.
OAKLAND, July 21.â Two of the vie- I
timsâ Constable Koch and D. C. Cameron
âwere buried to-day, and the other three |
deputiesâ Charles White. J. J. Lerri and j
George C. Woodsumâ will have a public I
funeral to-morrow afternoon. The matter i
has been taken in charge by the county j
officials, and arrangements were com- j
pleted to-day.
The cortege will form In front of the j
Courthouse at 1:30 p. m. A platoon of six- j
teon police officers will march first, fol- j
lowed by the three hearses abreast. The j
county officials and fraternal organiza- :
tions will follow the hearses, and then j
citizens in carriages. The route will be up \
Broadway to Fourteenth, to Washington, i
to Twelfth, to Clay and into the church.
Dr. Chapman will deliver the eulogy, j
and Revs. C. R. Brown. E. R. Dille and
C. M. Hill win be present from other i
churches, and an oration will also be read j
by a member of Mr. Woodsum's lodge at j
Berkeley. Woodmen of the World and ;
Knights of Pythias will furnish an escort â¢
to the cortege from the church to the
cemetery.
From 2 to 3 p. m. the bells of all the ;
fire houses and churches will be tolled.
The committee has issued the following:
It is requested that all stores be
closed Friday afternoon during the
passage of the funeral cortege as a
mark of respect to the memory of
the brave deputies who sacrincpu
their lives in the performance of
their duty. The lesson of such sac
rifice in times as these cannot be
too clearly demonstrated, and all
the county should consider it a
duty to honor the names of those
five men who will never be forgot
ten.
Honorably they lived, bravely
they died. The heritape of a noble
example left by them will bear
fruit when our generation has gone
to join them. Let all show tnelr
appreciation of such conduct and
personally tender the last tribute
of respect to those who deserve it.

SHOW THEIR RESPECT.
Supervisors Pass Resolutions
at a Meeting Specially
Called.
OAKLAND, July 21.â The Board of Su
pervisors held a special meeting this
morning, at which nearly all the county
officials were present. Supervisor Church,
in a timely speech, introduced the follow
ing resolutions, remarking that such an
action was all that they could do to show
their sorrow and respect for the loss of
the five deputies:
â¢$> Whereas, Charles M. "White, George <Â«>

<â¢> an Gustav Koch, sworn officers of the -.â¢>

<*> shock sustained by the people of this <J>
<Â§> county at the suddenness people of this <*>
county at the suddenness of this awful i
<Â§> event should be given by this board; <â¢>
<â¢> now, therefore, be It <;â 
& Resolved, That this board desires to <â¢>
<â¢> bear testimony to the respect and es- <Â«>
<â¢> teem in which Charles M. white. George <Â§>
<Â§âº C. Woodsum, D. C. Cameron, Joseph J. <*>
<$> Lerri deputy sheriffs. and Gustav <Â§>
Koch, constable of Oakland Township, <â¢>
<Â§> In this county, were held by the mem- Â«Â§>
Moreover, with such a department the
companies have agreed to a reduction in
the rates of insurance in this city, which
will be welcomed by the property owners.
Mr. Clunie wrote that he would agree
to the proposals made. In speaking of
the agreement with the companies Mr.
Clunie summarizes it in these words:
The total amount annually to be paid under
this agreement. If all companies Join, is $31.-
S7O 94. About ten companies have not as yet
eigned. but this is not because of an unwilling
ness to Join In the agreement, but because of
the absence from the city of the managers.
The amount to be paid by those actually signed
Is $23,919 S7 annually. In my letter I state the
reduction In rates to be at least $100,000 annu
ally. This Is a low estimate, as Is shown by
the telegrams passing between Robert Dick
on, the United States manager of the Royal
Exchange Insurance Company at New York.
and chief Sullivan of our Fire Department,
sent while I was In New York.
In the proposition made by the com
panies they agree to pay the commission
within thirty days a sum equal to 1 pei
cent of the net premiums, of each com
pany signing, during 1897, on risks in thin
State, after deducting $1000 expenses of
the controversy in the East. The Com
missioner shall pay this money propor
tionately to the treasurer of each county
or city and county, to the credit of the
Fire Department fund thereof, or to the
general fund if the treasurer refuses to
receive it. If the distribution becomes
burdensome or a treasurer refuse to ac
cept the money it can be paid Into thw
State treasury. The companies furthei
agree to make similar payments to the
Commissioner in January of each year,
during his term of office, the amounts to
be based upon the net premiums as shown
by the annual statements of business of
the contracting companies. The second
clause reads:
"We agree to readjust and reduce as
soon as may be practicable the tariff
rates now In force in the city and county
of San Francisco to the schedule adopted
some months ago, conditional upon the
placing of the Fire Department of tRo
city upon a fully paid footing, such ro
adjustment and rating to be applicable to
all policies taking effect on or after July
1, Xojr*.
A request is made that those companies
previously licensed under an agreement
with the Commissioner not to associate
themselves with other companies in an>
tariff organization, be released from their
promise, and this, with other requests,
was agreed to.
MALE DEER EXPOSED'
BUT NOT FOR SALE
CLEVER ADVERTISING SCHEME
OF A MARKETMAN.
It Was Nipped in the Bud by the
Fish and Game Commission
ers, Who Were Much
Annoyed.
Some members of the Cou.itry Club and
the Fish Commissioners have had a slight
difference of opinion regarding the legal
status of the game law. It appears that
after the 15th mat. members of the Coun
try Club, who are expert marksmen,
bowled over eight or ten noble specimens
of the horned deer family in the Marin
County preserve, some of which were
shipped to friends, the remainder being
consigned to a prominent game dealer in
the California Market.
Three beautiful specimens of the deer
family, per order of the leading marks
men of the Country Club, were hung up
in the stall of a prominent game butcher,
and for two days they were viewed with
much curiosity by people who wondered
why the Game and Fish Commissioners
tolerated such an Infringement of the
laws.
Numbers of ceople who have not the

Since his release, she avers, Mr. Heath

Lake Merritt Sanitation.
OAKLAND, July 21.â The conference
between the members of the City Council
and the Lake Merritt Sanitary Improve
ment Club resulted in it being unanimous
ly decided that the lake should be
dredged, the sewerage evils abated, and
that it should be done an soon as pos
sible. To accomplish this It was decided
to ask the City Council to include in the
tax levy funds for the dredging of Lake
Merritt and for extending the east side
sewer to deep water, while immediate
steps are to be taken to provide for a
temporary relief of the Cemetery Creek
sewage. The Commissioners for the
Cemetery Creek street opening are to be
asked to make a new assessment which
the Council will approve. The members
of the club present were President Good- j
all R. G. Brown, Harry Gordon, Ira !

Sudden Death of J. A. Williams.
OAKLAND, July 21.â John A. Williams,
a familiar character about the city and
who always made it a point to attend all
sessions o"f the Police Court, died last
evening from a stroke of apoplexy.
He was a native of Nashville, Term., 67
years of age. and leaves a widow and one
daughter, Mrs. Lamping. He was a
very portly gentleman and wore a heavy,
long beard. Last Monday evening he was
found unconscious and although every
thing possible was done for him he never
regained consciousness. He has been a
I resident of this city many years and
! could tell many stories of experiences
during the gold excitement on this
coast.
Oakland News Items.
OAKLAND, July 21.â The Young Men's
Rebublican Club will leave Thirteenth

at 7:30 o'clock for San Leandro. A bon

pected. The club expects fifty of Its mem
bers to participate In the trip.

Mich., will address the Physicians' Asso
ciation on Friday evening at the Uni

Some one has stolen Samuel Breck's
bicycle. He kept it locked in the base
ment, and the key hung in an out-of-the
way place. Several days ago he noticed
that it had been used, but the door was
locked. When stolen the door was locked
also.
I least conception of the game laws or their
I meaning asked the game dealers what
; their charge per pound for venison was,
â  but the answer to all queries was:
"Nothing. We cannot sell an ounce of
deer meat. But we simply have hung 'the
j birds' up for advertising purposes. The
1 venison Is the property of the Country
i Club, and for the opportunity that is
I granted us as a matter of advertisement
I we have agreed to distribute It pro rata
I among the friends of the members who
i are booked for venison steaks."
The Fish and Game Commissioners did
i not look at the matter in the same light
I as the Country Club members and their
deputies ordered the game animals to be
; taken from the meat hooks and "stowed"
1 away from view, stating that if even'
i game dealer should act in the same
manner the Fish and Game Commis
sioners may be held responsible for an
infringement of the game law, although
! the law does not state that male deer
I can or may be exposed in a market for
the purpose of advertising the place in
question.
j The consensus of opinion among sports-
I men Is that the Country Club is showing
! a bad precedent by permitting a game
! dealer to hang up deer in view of all ob
â erverft. The law is intended for game
I protection, and with that object in view
i sportsmen should, in the opinion of the
I preservers of game, assist the Commis
j sioners to protect the noble species, which
is being rapidly decimated.

Will S. Green, after having served his
country in the office of United States Sur
veyor General, has resumed the active
management of his bright newspaper, the
Colusa Sun, which has been his pride for
the past thirty-five years. During all this
time the policy of the owner and manager
has been to have the paper clean and
free from sensationalism and its Interests
those of the county, in which iÂ£ has a
large circulation. The journal has found
many readers outside of the boundaries
of Colusa County, and not a few, relying
on the truthfulness of its statements,
have become residents of the county. To
Bay that Mr. Green s efforts to increase
the population of his home by publish
ing truthfully the resources of that sec
tion, have been fruitful, goes without
Many of the wealthiest and most de
sirable citizens of the fertile valley of
Colusa gladly attest that their attention
was called to the place where they have
made their homes by the journal over
which Mr. Green presides. Since his re
turn to private life Mr. Green has re
newed his efforts to add more to the
population, and to this end he has issued
a special circular calling attention to the
beauties of the scenery, richness of the
soil and many opportunities for invest
ments in profitable business and pursuits.
While Mr. Green has always been a
factor In county politics, as well as in
matters of state, evon his political op
ponents cannot say that he ever used the
power of his paper to promote anything
but that which he believed to b'fe the
right.

CHAIRMAN FLETTER TO SOON
OALL A MEETING.
W. H. Friend of the Congressional
Committee Receives the Reso
lution From Sacra
mento.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 21.
F. J. Fletter, chairman of the Alame
da County Republican Central Committee,
returned yesterday from his Eastern trip
and soon after the assembling of the
State committee he will call the county |
organization together to arrange for the
election of delegates to the State conven- j
tion.
The effort to Insure a unit delegation
to the State convention by electing the
delegates at a county convention has
been discarded, as it is found to be con
trary to the rule of action laid down by
the laat Republican State convention.
The committeemen were sounded as to
their preferences in the matter of the
election of State delegates and some were
favorable to the convention plan. Rod
Church from the Fourth Ward, In which
is the residence of Dr. Pardee. said that
he could not conscientiously advocate
any such proposition, and he did not see
how Mr. Davis or Dr. Pardee could coun
tenance such a plan, because both these
gentlemen were delegates to the conven
tion which declared that delegates to
State conventions must be elected at pri
maries or caucuses properly called by the
respective county committees.
\V. H. Friend, chairman of the Third
Congressional District committee, was
also somewhat In doubt regarding this
point, and he sent to District Attorney
Frank B. Ryan of Sacramento for thtj
extract from" the minutes of the conven
tion relating to the matter. The reply
contained the following resolution, which
was proposed by the credentials commit
tee and adopted by the convention:
Resolved, That It is the sense of this conven
tion that all delegates to the county, district
and State conventions of the Republican party
â â  should be elected at primaries or caucuses regru
larly called by the County Central Committees
> of the several counties for that purpose, and
j that only such delesates as are so selected at
' such primaries or caucuses shall be seated in
'â ' any of the conventions of the party hereafter
j to be held.

Employers "Want a Settlement.
OAKLAND, July 21.â L. B. Reynolds, a
driver for the Red Star Laundry, is ac
: cused by his employer of being between
$1000 and $2000 short in his accounts. He
ran a wagon route on commission and
kept his own accounts, which Superin-
I tendent Ram could not fathom. He has
i been there for nearly eighteen months,
and last week was pressed for an account
ing. He promised to give it this week.
It is claimed that he made an extra effort
on Friday and Saturday to collect every
thing due him, stating to his customers
that he was going to Manila this week
< with the Kansas Regiment. He is now
missing, and the firm believes it has been
cheated.
PROFESSOR HILGARD RETURNS
Took a Prominent Part in the Irriga-
tion Convention at Denver.
BERKELEY, July 21.â Professor E. W.
Hllgard, head of the department of agri
culture in the University of California,
returned yesterday from Denver, where
he had been to attend a national conven
tion of agriculturists, called to discuss
the question of irrigation. Professor Hil
gard reports that the convention will
have no direct bearing upon the interests
of California agriculturists. He says that
the purpose of the meeting was to ad
vise Secretary Wilson of the Department
of Agriculture as to the present state and
conditions of irrigation, in order that he
might have in view the needs of different
sections of the country when issuing bul
letins upon that subject. The bulletins,
to be published in pamphlet form, will
be Issued as occasion demands, Congress
having recently appropriated $10,00u for
that purpose.
As one of the representatives from Cali
fornia, Professor Hilgard was regarded
as a special authority upon alkali soils,
and the Denver Republican speaks of his
address before the convention as one of
the most important given there.

Charitable Work.
ALAMEDA, July 21.â The ladles of the
Red Cross Society of this city are en
gaged at present in a line of work a littiu
out of their order. The explosion of the
fuse factory, which desolated so many
homes, has opened up a new channel for
charitable work. As they are not sup
posed to use the funds of the society lor
other purposes than among soldiers, they
have resolved themselves into an auxiliary
society for this special end. They are re
ceiving generous donations In the way of
clothing and furniture, and there hayÂ»
been several contributions of cash. A
movement is on foot to raise funds on this
side of the bay to rebuild the demolished
homes.

ton of Liliuokalani.
RUMORS OF A BIG STRIKE
LABOR TROUBLES SAID TO BE
BREWING IN THE ISLANDS.
The Ex-Queen Is Satisfied to Accept
a Suitable Compromise
for the Crown
Lands.
Ex-Queen Liliuokalani, attended by her
physician, I>r. English of Washington,
and Mr. and Mrs. Heleluke, arrived last
night from Washington, en route to Hono
lulu. The party will leave on the Oaellc
next Tuesday for the ex-Queen's native
home.
IJliuokalanf has received annexation
with a sort of resigned despair. In it she
reads the Inevitable, and seeÂ« that even
hope for a recovery of the throne is ut
terly demolished. She will return to the
islands and make them her home In the
future. The ex-Queen is solicitous about
the provision which will be made for her
by this Government. She lays claim to
the crown lands, amounting to about
100 000 acrea and yielding an income of
0 a year. It is her intention to con
test the title to this property in the event
of thÂ« United States assuming absolute
ownership Of it. Hut the Queen is willing
m compromise, and the most probable
outcome will be a settlement for life upon
the present representative of the last
dynasty.
Colonel fieorge W. McFarlane is au
tl orlty for the statement that as soon as
the flag Is raised at Honolulu an organ
ized strike of gigantic proportions will
sweep over the Island, impeding the work
ing of plantations and the manufacturing
fjar. He says that he has received
this news from the best authority and
thai there is not only a strong probability
of labor entanglements but that the seeds
of dissension have already been sown and
the product is ready to spring forth at
any moment. The preser^ rate of wages
is about HO a month. The strike will be
made for very nearly douMe that sum.

PURCHASED A POLITICAL BRICK.
BANKER JOHN H. JEWETT, Who Was Cleverly Caught
by a Brand New Bunko Scheme.
JOHX H. JEWETT, hanker, shrewd business man and ex-president of the
Society of California Pioneers, has recently invested in a political brick
that will doubtli ss be of great value to him for future reference. He
will, however, when these facts reach him. have a degree of satisfaction
In knowing that there are numerous other prominent citizens of San Fran
cisco who are in humility and sorrow secretly hoarding 1 the same kind of
a treasure, of the existence of which even their best friends are in ignorance.
It seems that there is at the present time a person of good address, at
tired in fine raiment and possessed of matchless nerve, who has discovered a
new bunko game and is playing it in a heartless manner on unsuspecting
citizens. He (artfully selects his victims and presents his card as the. con
ntatlve of the Republican or Democratic State Central Com
mittee, as the necessities of the case require. The eminent citizen is told
that by reason of his great prominence and popularity throughout the State
the "committee" has decided that he Is the only man who can be safely
nominated for a certain office. He is courteously asked if he would meet
a special committee from the State Central organization privately and receive
the proposition, iif course, the innocent citizen is not looking for civic
office, but would be pleased to meet the gentlemen. The political bunko man
just before departing BUddenly reminds himself that he is also taking sub
ecriptlona tor the Central Committee, to be used for campaign purposes, and
flashes b( fore the eyes of the bewildered victim a list bearing the names and
sums donated by a number of men of prominence In this bailiwick. The rest
of the Bcheme is easy, as there is apparently no honorable escape, and the
sharper gets the money without having to show his hand.
Mr. Jewett, one of the best known mm In the State, and who Is now
visiting in Marysville, his old home. Is one of the many to bite at the tempt
ing bait. In an Interview with The Call correspondent he relates his experi
ence, which should be a warning- to tho unsuspecting.
"I was called upon at my home by a very nice gentleman, who presented
his card and stated that he represented the Republican State Central Com
mittee," said Mr. Jewett. "He ask*>d me if I would receive a committee
of Republicans who desired to tender me the nomination for the head of the
ticket. I told him I would not accept the offer, but deeply appreciated the
honor and would be glad to meet the committee. He urged me to withhold
my decision until I had talked with the gentlemen.
"I told him 1 realized the fact that by reason of my high position in
the Society of Pioneers, my popularity among the Native Sons and wide
acquaintance throughout California I would probably be a desirable candi
date, in fact had been offered the position of standard bearer a number of
years before. Still my answer would be no.
"Just before leaving he presented a donation list and asked me to sub
scribe to the campaign fund. I looked over the paper and saw the names
and gifts of many of my friends. When I reached the name of Postmaster
\V. W. Montague and saw that he had given $20, I subscribed $10. and the
gentleman departed with profuse thanks and stated that the committee
would wait on me soon. I have never seen the man since."
The honor was so highly appreciated that Mr. Jewett casually told a
number of friends at Pioneers 1 headquarters of the exalted place that had
been offered him in preference to every other man in the State, and that he
was sorry to have to refuse the proffer of the committee, the visit of
which he was hourly expecting.
Mr. Jewett is still waiting, and will have to charge $10 to political inex
perience. There are others, but they are too busy to let themselves be
known.
The smooth worker is doubtless operating at the present time on the
other good things. For the benefit of such it may be stated that Major
McLaughlin sulphuriously states that the man Is all kinds of an imposter, and
that there is no one authorized by or collecting funds for the Republican
State Central Committee, nor is there any one empowered to offer nomina
tions on the Republican ticket. And there you are.

THE SAN" FRANCISCO CAX.L, FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1898.
FOR ATEN-CENT SAUCEPAN
Mrs. Ellen Curru Arrested on Com
plaint of a Merchant for
Stealing.
Mrs. Ellen Curry, a respectable looking old lady, Is In the City Prison
on a charge of petty larceny, and a saucepan worth 10 cents is booked as
evidence against her.
Yesterday afternoon she entered the store of P. B. O'Hair, hardware
merchant, 213 Fourth street, and after looking around the store and see
ing no one she took the saucepan, and slipping it under her jacket walked
out. O'Hair had been reading a newspaper in his office and he followed
the old lady.
He overtook her at Howard streec and accused her of stealing the
saucepan. She burst Into tears and threw the saucepan into the street.
When O'Hair told her that he would hold her until a policeman appeared
she began to scream, and a crowd of several hundred people quickly gath
ered. Policeman Van Keuren, seeing the crowd, hurried to the scene and
rang in for the patrol wagon. While waiting the arrival of the wagon
Mrs. Curry kept up her screaming, and the crowd became ugly and
threatening. Its arrival stopped what might have turned out to be a riot.
O'Hair went in the wagon to the prison and personally preferred the
charge. He said he was getting tired of women sneaking into his store
and slipping away with some article, and he thought it was time an ex
ample was made of some one.
"I watched her as she entered the store," he said. "She glanced
around, and not seeing me, as I was in my office reading a paper, she
slipped the saucepan under her jacket and left. When I accused her of
taking it she threw it away, and told me to go and get it. Then she be
gan to cry and scream. She also threw away some tins of sardines and
a box of honey, which she also had under her jacket."
When' searched half a dozen oranges, a penholder and other trifling
articles were found in the bosom of her dress, or in a small hand satchel
that she carried.
Mrs. Curry had not got over her tears when seen In her cell. She
said: "I went into the store and asked him what was the price of the
saucepan, and he said 10 cents. I told him I did not have the money, but
as I wanted the saucepan I would take it, anyway. I went out with it, and
he came after me and arrested me. I got the oranges and honey from Mrs.
Davidson, a friend of mine, who lives on Twenty-sixth street, but I don't
know the number.
"I am a respectable woman, and have five sons In Martinez, one of
them, Henry Curry, being the Coroner there. He will make the man suf
fer who says his mother is a thief."

A SILVER CUP THEIR GIFT
JUDGE SHELDON MAKES SOME
TIMELY REMARKS.
French Society Officially Thanked
for Its Splendid Donation.
What the Workers Are
Doing.
Mrs. Theodore E. Smith, manager of
the Rod Cross supply depot at 18 Post
etreet, was agreeably surprised Wednesday
by receiving a beautiful silver cup, the |
gift of the T'nited States "Volunteer Sig
. nal Corps, under command of Captain
Russell. Nestling in a large box of sweet
smelling roses iind sweet peas the cup
was handed to the manager by a brace !
of sergeants, who assured her that it was
in part payment for the kindnesses shown
their company by the Red Cross Society. I
Calling her fellow-workers around her :
she exhibited the cup, lac first substan-
Hal token of appreciation received by the
Boclety since its organization. The bear- :
ers of the gift were overwhelmed with
kind words of praise by the ladies, :
THE CHAIN LETTER SCHEME.
Last Tuesday The Call published
an article in reference to a "chain
letter" scheme" conducted by the
American Soldiers' Relief Society,
the officers of which are Dr. G. "W.
Sylvester, W. H. Hollis, C. M. Dais
and Dr. J. E. Sand. The officers of
that society said to a Call reporter
that the money collected had been
turned over to the Red Cross So
ciety. The officers of both the. local
and State branches of the Red
Cross Society were interviewed, and
they affirmed positively that they
had no knowledge of the American
Soldiers' Relief Society and that
they had not received any money or
other donation from it.
On the next morning- the officers
of the local Red Cross Society dis
covered that their statement made
to The Call reporter was an error
and that, in fact, $20 had been paid
in by the American Soldiers' Re
lief Society and that the same had
been placed to its credit. As neither
the officers of the Red Cross nor
The Call desire to do any one an
injustice this statement is made.
The "chain" letter scheme, which
the promoters of the society adopted
for the purpose of securing money
for the fund, is one which has been
worked so often in the interests of
fraud that it has come to be looked
upon with distrust by all, and every
case of the kind which comes to the
notice of the postal authorities is
thoroughly investigated. The mem
bers of the Relief Society all de
clare that they were not aware of
this when they started the "chain,"
who were so charmed with it that they
cheered Â»the donors. The flowers and the
cup now repose side by side on Mrs.
Smith's desk and attract marked atten
tion.
Another large sum* was received by the
secretary of the local branch on Tues
day. The French citizens having In
charge the splendid celebration of July
14 proudly handed her $1544 05 as their of
fering to the society. This sum is one of
the largest, if not the largest, received
during the past month and speaks Well
for those who donated it.
At the executive meeting of the Red Cross
Society yesterday It was resolved "that a vote
of thanks be and Is hereby extended to the
French Society of San Francisco for Its mag
nificent contribution of $1844 05 to the funds
of the Red Cross Society of San Francisco."
It was also decided that a vote of thanks
be extended to the Musicians' Mutual Pro
tective I'nion for its generous contributions of
orchestral and band music at various Red Crosa
entertainments given in this city. The value
of such contribution to date amounts) to over
$1000.
Judge Sheldon, in his address at the execu
tive meeting yesterday, stated that the Bociety
was a legal organization with a definite object.
"It ought to be made a misdemeanor to use
the Insignia and name of the Red Cross So
ciety for any purpose other than the legitimate
work of the association. All funds that are
collected in the name of the Red Cross that
are not turned over to the Red Cross Society
are swindles that ought to be rebuked by every
person In the community."
As a false rumor has been circulated about
the society neglecting the Tennessee Regiment
the following letter will be of Interest to the
public:
Headquarters First Infantry, Tennessee United
States Volunteers, Camp Merritt.
SAN FRANCISCO. July 18, 1898.
To the President and Members of the Red
Cross Society, San Francisco, CaL â Ladles: It
having come to my knowledge that some un
authorized person or persons have been circu
lating reports to the effect that the ladies of
your society have been Indifferent and wanting
in their attention to the members of the regi
ment I have the honor to command, I desire
to cay In behalf of my regiment and Its mem
bers that all such reports are absolutely un
true and do your society a very great wrong.
Since the arrival of the Tennessee Regiment
In San Francisco I beg to say that the ladles
of the Ked Cross of San Francisco and Oak
land have been unremitting in their attenttona
to this regiment, doing everything they were
permitted to do in looking after the comfort
and weirare of this command, both as regards
the sick and the well, and whetner In camp
or In the hospital. We are aJI Indignant that
such a report as the one referred to should j
have been given circulation, and I now take j
occasion to denounce and repudiate it and to J
characterize it as an absolute untruth. The j
men of the Tennessee Regiment who have been I
the recipients of co many kind and thoughtful !
offices by the ladles of yt/ur noble society will
never forget your work in their behalf during
their sojourn in this city. They all say God
bless the ladles of the Red Cross Society in |
their noble efforts to contribute to their com- j
fort and welfare.
With our best wishes for you all In your
noble work I have the honor to be, respect
fully your obedient servant,
WILLIAM C. SMITH,
Colonel First Infantry, Tennessee United

The men of the Eighteenth and Twenty
! third regiments. United States regulars, now :
j in San Francisco, are all recruits and have no
| company funds. They therefore lack many of â¢
! the comforts and necessities which the United

i the Red Cross try to help them as well as they
! can. The men "especially want vegetables, :
, pickles, etc., and the ladles have sent both j

MRS. EMMA STERRET
GUILTY OF CONTEMPT
REFUSED TO PRODUCE PAPERS
IN THE WALTER CASE.
Her Attorneys Will Appeal to the
Supreme Court From the Ruling
of Judge Troutt.
The legal battle that has waged be
tween the heirs of Gustav Walter, since
his death, and Mrs. Emma Sterret daily
Increases In bitterness. Yesterday a
climax was reached in the case
and Mrs. Sterret was adjudgeu
guilty of contempt of court. Sho
was ordered Into the custody of ths
Sheriff until she complied with the ordei
made by Judge Troutt, commanding her
to produce all papers in court she removed
from the rooms occupied by herself ana
Gustav Walter during the last two years
of Walter's life. The judgment of court,
however, will not be carried into effect
until next Monday. In the meantime ah
appeal will be taken to the Supreme Court
by Attorneys Hart and Schooler, who rep
resent Mrs. Sterret.
When the matter of the citation of
Mrs. Sterret in relation to the estate
of Walter came up yesterday, Judge
Troutt had the order, made on Mrs. Ster
ret several weeks ago, drawn up in for
mal phrase. As expected, Mrs. Sterret
failed to produce the papers, and Judgo
Troutt adjudged her guilty of contempt
and ordered her into the custody of thÂ«
Sheriff. Mrs. Sterret was present In tho
courtroom when the order was tpiade, but
it failed to disturb her in the least. Sho
knew that it was simply a formal ordei
and in event the Supreme Court sustained
Judge Troutt she could easily purge her
self of contempt by producing the papers.
After the order was made Attorney
Young, representing the estate, stated to
the court that he was willing that a sus
pension of judgment should be granted
Mrs. Sterret in order to give her attor
neys an opportunity to appeal. Judge
Troutt granted the stay, but next Monday,
in event the Supreme â Court*' sustains
Judge Troutt, Mrs. Sterret must produce
the papers or go into the custody of tho
Sheriff as his prisoner.
The fight Mrs. Sterret's attorneys will
make before the Supreme Court against
the order made by Judge Troutt will h%
based on the fourth amendment of thÂ«
constitution of the United States, which
provides that "The right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, pa
pers and effects against unreasonable
searches and seizures shall not be violated
and no warrants shall issue but upon rea
sonable cause, supported by oath or affir
mation, and particularly describing the
place to be searched, and the person or
things to be seized." The order of Judge
Troutt commands Mrs. Sterret to produce
"papers" in court and describes no par
ticular paper, with the exception of some
stock In a local corporation. The attor
neys representing the estate do not know
that the papers will be of material use
to them, but they want to find out. hencÂ«
the order commanding their production.
Mrs. Sterret's attorneys hold that the
order is plainly in violation of the fourth
amendment of the constitution, and be
hind that formidable provision they will
stand and fight the order to the end.
Canadian Railroad Competition.
At a general session of the Interstate
Commerce Commission held at Chicago
on the 14th inst. it was determined to hold

send representatives to the session that
will take place in Chicago for the purpose
of determining what relief might be ob
tained for the American companies.

ALL HAWAII'S
CHINESE ARE
ALSO ANNEXED
Collector Jackson Says That He
Must Admit Hordes of
Coolies.
There Is No Way to Stop the Thousands
of Mongolian Laborers From Flood
ing California.
During the discussion relative to the
advantages and disadvantages of an
nexing Hawaii to the United States
The Call repeatedly pointed out the
likelihood that in the event of annexa
tion the thoupands of Chinese coolies
In that country would be entitled to
free and unrestricted immigration to
California and other Stales of the
United States. The islands having
been annexed, the problem is a new one
ajid in a fair way for an immediate so
lution, for the first steamer-load of
Chinese leaving the Sandwich Islands
for California will throw upon the
shoulders of Collector Jackson the re
sponsibility for the addition to the al-
ready overcrowded laboring population
of California of hordes of coolies.
The Collector was asked yesterday
what he would do should a boatload of
coolies from the Islands arrive here.
He replied: "Understanding that the
Sandwich Islands are now a part of
the United States, and that the laws of
the United States, In so far as appli
cable, are in operation there, I do not
see how, In the absence of instructions
from Washington to the contrary, I
would have the right to forbid their
landing in this State. It is mÂ£ opin
ion that I have no more right to ex
clude them than I would have to ex
clude Chinese coming from Arizona or
Alaska. I shall have to admit them
all.
"The subject la one that will have to
receive the attention of the department
at Washington and a construction
by the Attorney General of the United
States of the laws bearing upon Chi
nese immigration. But until that time
comes, the principle that being legally
in one part of the country entitles
them to po to another part of the
country would seem to obtain as well

HE FEARS LEGAL ACTIONS
MERCHANTS REQUESTED NOT TO
TAKE STEPS IN COURT.
Colls Attention to Test Cases in the
East and Jollies Business
Men With Soft
Words.
The stand taken by the Merchants' As
sociation in the matter of Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s Express Company, compelling its
patrons to pay the 1 cent stamp war tax
â which the law says that the corporation
6hould pay, has had some effect upon
the president of this transportation insti
tution. At the meeting of the associa
tion on Wednesday a number of the mem
bers raised their voices and gave expres
sion to complaints long and loud against
the injustice practiced by the company
mentioned. They declared that they are
paying their proportion of the tax that
the Government requires to carry on the
war. and they do not begrudge the little
1 cent stamps that are stuck on all re
ceipts and documents, .^ome have said
that if the tax was twice as high they
â would not complain, considering that the
cause is a just one. But on the other
hand if It was one-half of what it is they
would object to paying the other mÂ»n's
share, especially where the other party
Is making money out of the affair and is
well able to stand his own obligations.
Such expressions have been echoed
throughout the length of the land and in
more than one place the people have pro
tested by actions in the courtÃ against
paying the "other fellow's" debts.
This was one of the things contem
plated by the Merchants' Association,
and the only reason some such step* was
not taken was because the test cases be
fore the courts in the East will decide
the same questions that wou'i come up
here. However, It contributed money for
The prosecution of those cases. In order
that the local management of Wells-
Fargo's ExpreÃS Company might not
think that the San Francisco merchants
are afraid of the corporation, a spirited
communication was st^nt to President
Valentine, In which several protests and
objections were registered. The principal
was against the company extorting from
the shipper or consignor directly or in

in the case of the Sandwich Islands as
in any other of our territorial posses
sions. Hawaii is In the same position
with reference to Its government as
any one of our Territories not yet en
titled to statehood."
The Collector was asked whether the
fact that the Hawaiian Chinese did not
possess certificates of registration a*
required of all Chinese laborers in the
United States would not bar them from
admission to the United States.
"If they were asked," replied the Col
lector, "whether they had certificates of
registration they would say 'None was
required of us at the time the law went
into effect. We have complied with
all the laws In operation applicable to
us up to the present moment.' If the
government does not provide some way
to stop them I don't see that I can,
under the law as It Is at present."
The Collector then proceeded to speak
of the decision of Assistant Secretary
Howell to the effect that persons sub
jects of China, and described as sales
men, clerks, buyers, bookkeepers, ac
countants, managers, storekeepers, ap
prentices, agents, cashiers, physicians,
proprietors of restaurants, etc., should
be denied admission.
"The statute," said the Collector,
"provides that other than laborers may
be admitted, and the custom has been
up to the present day to admit Chinese
on certificates that they were other
than laborers. But the treaty mentions
specifically the classes that may be ad
mitted. These are officials, teachers,
students, merchants, or travelers for
curiosity or pleasure. Mr. Howell has
ruled that only those persons shall be
admitted. This decision means a loss
of hundreds of thousands of dollars an
nually to the big steamship companies,
for It will decrease Chinese immigra
tion very materially."

the patrons would pay the same only

right to test the legality of the company's :
actions at any time.
Another communication was sent to
United States Attorney Foote, In which 1
he was formally notified that the law Is '
being violated by the company, and re
questing that he begin proceedings i
against the offenders. The services of
the association were promised to the Fed

lation of the law is inferred by the fact
that he has made no effort of his own !
volition to correct the offenders. So far I
it is not learned that Mr. Foote has taken !
any steps in the matter or that he has I
conferred with the directors of the asso- I
ciation with reference to the violations
of the law to which his attention has
been called.
However, the correspondence has had
the effect of awakening President Valen

might happen, and possibly the "some- i

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1898.
GALLANTS OF THE SEVENTH DRILL
Bous From Southern California Show Their Skill Before a Vast Throng in Behalf
of Native Daughters' Red Cross Aid.
THE volunteers of the Sevonth California Regiment, Colonel John R. Berry, enjoyed their first opportu
nity last night to distinguish themselves since taking up arms in defense of their country. The occasion
was a benefit for the brave boys of the First California, given under the auspices of the Native Daughters'
Red Cross Aid. The programme ran the gamut of camp work, from reveille to taps, and the citizen soldiery
from the southland acquitted themselves like veterans.
The universal opinion among military men present was that such clever work has never been done
here by volunteers. The noteworthy feature of tho programme Included: Physical exercises with arms by Com
pany B of San Diego, under the direction of Captain R. V. Dodge; drill school of the battalion, First Battalion,
Major F. C. Prescott; bayonet exercise, Company F, Captain F. L. Reynolds, and the extended order drill by
Company H, Captain A. W. Browne. The latter drill Is in battle formation, and is a typical scene of mimic warfare.
The men charged, rallied by squads, advanced and retreated, finally leaving the floor at double quick. The various
numbers on the programme were loudly applauded, but this fairly took the house by storm.
The reviewing stand was decorated with the flag of LaEstrella Parlor. The flag was made entirely by hand, by
Miss Helen Krune. Among the officers on the stand were:
Brigadier General Harrison Gray Otis. Colonel William Smith of Tennessee. Lieutenant Colonel Gracey Childers,
Major A P. Bayless. Major Choate, Major J. C. McGulre, Captain Clark, Captain Gillam. Captain Reid, Captain
Hagar. Lieutenant Ragsdale. Lieutenant Shepman, and T. E. Gibben. Police Commissioner of Los Angeles.
The ladies representing the Native Daughters were:
Mrs Lena B. Mills (chairman). Miss Lizzie Douglass, Miss Mac B. Wilkin, Miss Lily O. Richling, Miss Mc-
Allister Miss Mamie McCarthy, ..lias Carrie Crelgh, Miss Martin, Mlsa Mary Crelgh. Miss Mattle Farris, Miss

During the evening the ladies of the Native Daughters' Red Cross Aid entertained 1300 soldiers at supper. Ta
bles were spread the entire length of machinery hall, and were laden with fruits and flowers. After the drill
dancing was Inaugurated, which the soldier boys greatly enjoyed â¢
BOLD ATTEMPT
AT ROBBERY
Men Are Scared Off by
a Plucky Woman.
THEY TRIED TO INJURE HER
WOULD HAVE THROWN HER
DOWNSTAIRS.
Mrs. Marie Mangels, Keeper of a
Confectionery Store, the Hero
ine of a Daylight
Emcounter.
A desperate attempt at robbery was
made shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday at
Market and Hermann streets.
Earlier in the day a man scured from
Mrs. Marie Mangels, who conducts a
confectionery store at the corner named,
the key of an unoccupied flat above her
store. He returned the key, but did not
lock the door. He returned later with
an express wagon from a second-hand
furniture store at 1457 Market street and
was accompanied by two companions.
They went upstairs through the door
that he had left open and made so much
noise taking up a carpet and removing
fittings as to attract the attention of Mrs.
Mangels. She went upstairs, and no
sooner did the men see her than they
made a dash for the street. The leader
of the two caught Mrs. Mangels by the
throat, as she stood between him and lib
erty. He tried to throw her downstairs,
but she caught the balustrade and
saved herself.
The men reached the street and at onco
ran down Elgin Park toward Thirteenth
street. Mrs. Mangels blew a police whis
tle and cried "Stop, thief!" but to "no
avail. There werÂ« no police in the neigh
borhood, so the men escaped. The driver
of the express wagon remained, but could
throw no light on the identity of the men.
The leader of the crowd was of medi
um height, wore a brown overcoat, white
hat and* kid gloves.
Detectives Wren and Gibson were de
tailed on the case. Mrs. Mangels and her
little daughter affirm that they can iden
tify the man wherever they see him. The
affair created Intense excitement in the
neighborhood, attracting a great crowd.
Tnree Till Robbers.
Arthur Mathews Is behind the bars in
the Seventeenth-street police station, and
his two confederates will keep him com
pany If the police can find them. The
trio stole a horse and buggy which they
found on the San Bruno road during the
afternoon, and started out to rob tills.
Their first victim was A- Aiseler, who
keeps a grocery at Twenty-second and
Dolores streets. Aiseler has a watering
trough in front of his store for the ac
commodation of passing teams. The
trough was empty at the time the thieves
drove up, and at the request of one ot
them the accommodating proprietor pro
ceeded to turn on the water. While he
was engager] in conversation with one of
them the others went inside and rifled
the money drawer of its contorts.
John Ulston's place at San Bruno road
and Army Street was the next place vis
ited, and* the till was robbed.
The till of Mrs. Heis' store at 3316
Twenty-second street was rifled next.
Complaints were made to Lieutenant
Price, and ho detailed Detectives Fitz
gerald and Graham on the case. They
were not long in landing Mathews be
hind the bars.
PRIVATE POSTAL CARDS.
They Have Been Authorized by a
Recent Act of Congress.
In accordance with an act recently
passed by Congress It is now lawful to
use private postal cards of any chosen
design, provided they are of practically
the same size and color as those author
ized by the International Postal Union.
The cards must also bear these words in
print on the address side:
"Private mail card, authorized by act
of Congress May 19, 1898."
When prepared by printers or station
ers for sale they should also bear in the
upper right hand corner of address Bide
an oblong diagram with the words:
"Place a 1-cent stamp here," and the
lower left hand corner the following
words should be printed: "This" side is
exclusively for the address."
The messages on the cards may be
either written or printed and there may
also appear on the message side adver
tisements, illustrations or other matter,
printed either in black or in colors.
Another circular issued from headquar
ters calls the attention of Postmasters
to the fact that in cases where senders
of second, third and fourth class matter
ask that the matter be returned or for
warded it will be necessary for the send
ers to forward stamps for that purpose
before their requests can be complied
with.
Committee of One Hundred Censured.
At a meeting of the Thirty-nrst District
