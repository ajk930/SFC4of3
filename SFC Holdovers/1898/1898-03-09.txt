THE RIGHT OF
BELLIGERENTS TO
BUY WARSHIPS
There Can B^ No Question They
May Be Purchased Where
t ever They Are Found
for Sale.
Call OflSce, Riggs House,
Washington, March 8.
All authorities agree that
nations may purchase war
ships, even after hostilities
have begun, if the neutral na
tion exercises strict impar
tiality between the belliger
ents and the ships are not
armed and outfitted ready for
service. The trade of ship
building is recognized as a
legitimate one, which may be
carried on at all times. Mr.
Clay, when Secretary of State,
laid down the principle as fol
lows:
"If it be forbidden by the
law of nations to sell to a bel
ligerent an armed vessel com
pleted, equipped and ready for
action, it is believed not to be
contrary to the law to sell a
belligerent a vessel in any oth
er state, although it may be
convertible into a ship of
war."
Mr. Clay specified a case in which
Spain and one of the South American
Republics, then at war, each bought
a ship from the same shipbuilder,
which ships afterward met on the
sea and had an engagement. He also
specified the case of Russia selling a
whole fleet of ships to Spain, includ
ing some of the Russian ships of the
line, while Russia held a neutral
position between Spain and the
South American Republics, with
which she was at war.
The subject has been before the j
American courts and in one case Jus- !
tice Story held that "while the sale j
of vessels, armed or unarmed, to
a belligerent is not forbidden by i
international law, such vessels, even
on the way to the purchaser, are
liable to seizure as contraband."
In a later case before the Supreme
Court, the distinction is made be
tween the unlawful act of fitting out |
and arming a ship of war for a bel
ligerent, and the lawful act of sell- !
ing such ships to be converted into .
men-of-war. The decision says that
the distinction is the same as that
between the lawful act of a gunsmith
in selling a pistol and the unlawful
net of the same gunsmith in arrang- 'â 
ing that a pistol shall be used for a
criminal act.
A good deal is being ace
in the way of preparation in both
the Navy and War Departments.

MADRID, March B.â Senor Sa

the situation as follows: "There
Is no cause of alarm. There is
a little war feeling here, but
there is an irrepressible under

"Endeavors have been made

some remark which might be

This evening the following is
officially published from the
Spanish Embassador to the Vat

"To the Minister of State at
Madrid: Cardinal Rampolla
called upon me and told me to
request that the statement be
made to your Excellency that
notice that he had held a con

of the New York Journal on the

false. His eminence denies en
tirely the statements attributed
to him and says he has not re
ceived any newspaper represen
tative."
Thus the Rampolla interview
turns out to be a shameless fake.

SAX FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1898.
ARMY AND NAVY
WILL BE READY
FOR THE WAR
It Is the Present Plan of Miles
and Alger to Mass the
American Troops
at Atlanta.
Calf Office, Riggs House,
Washington, D. C, March 8.
A/though it is fully understood
that in the event of war the brunt
of the fighting must be borne by the
navy, the other great arm of the
service will certainly be called into
active service, and it is the purpose
to set aside at least $18,000,000 of
the $50,000,000 for increasing the
number of troops, in supplying equip
ments and in transporting the troops.
There is every indication that the War
Department has determined upon At
lanta as the point for the mobilization
of the land troops in the event of war
with Spain. While the officers of the
army and the officials of the depart
ment are of course very reticent
about their plans, they have undoubt
edly gone so far as to settle upon At
lanta as headquarters of the depart
ment of the East should trouble come.
That a decision to this effect has been
reached was demonstrated to-day by a
remark which a high officer in the
commissary department let fall.
When he was questioned about the ar
rangements which his department had made
he said: "If the order came this morning
to mass 500,000 men at Atlanta the pro
visions to feed them would be there before
the men. The commissary arrangements
hare been all in readiness ever since the
first intimation of trouble. The contractors
say no matter how large the army we put
in the field, nor how long the struggle lasts,
the supplies will be more than ample for all
needs."
It is understood that at the Cabinet meet
ing Secretary Long gave a detailed state
ment of the ships he proposed to buy. Com
mander Brownson, who has been selected
i by Mr. Long to go to Europe as the purchas
ing agent of the Navy Department, has been
given unlimited authority in the matter of
I purchase. It is stated positively that there !
! are only two big fighting vessels in Europe
which this Government desires. Of these
one is being built at Leghorn. Italy, for the
Argentine Republic, while the other is being
constructed for the Brazilian Government by \
the Armstrongs in England. Both are yes- !
sets of the size of the Maine and will carry
an armament similar in weight and size of
guns. Happily, both are practically com
pleted and are now receiving only the finish
ing touches.
Commander Brownson intends to pur
chase these two vessels, and if he believes
it can be done safety he will have them :
sent to this country in their present condi- i
i tion.
Great haste will be required in order to
escape restrictions imposed by the neutral
ity laws. While there are enough guns and
other equipment now on hand to fit out both '
these vessels. Commander Brownson may
decide to purchase a complete armament for
the vessels abroad. In that event he will
obtain the guns for the Argentine battle
, ship from the Krupps at Essen, Germany,
MONTGOMERY SAILS.
KEY WEST, Fla., March B.â
The United States cruiser Mont
gomery sailed at 5:40 this after
noon for Havana. She will be
held at the Cuban capital until
the crisis ends one way or the
other.

while the Armstrongs will supply the guns
for the Brazilian vessel.
In addition to these two ships Secretary
i Long's agent will purchase every torpedo
boat and every torpedo-destroyer that he
: can find. The Government feels the need
of torpedo-boats far more than of the
heavier fighting ships. The only other
vessels of the latter class which this Gov
ernment is anxious io add to our navy are
the two cruisers being constructed for the
Japanese Government â one by the Cramps
at Philadelphia and the other at the Union
Iron Works, San Francisco.
A member of the Naval Affairs Committee
of the House, who has been in almost daily
conference with Secretary Long for the past
few days, is authority for the statement
that a large part of the appropriation of
$50,000,000 will be used in the construc
tion of torpedo-boats in this country, assur
ance having been given by various con
tractors that they could furnish a large
number of them in three months' time.
The proposition to build many more
torpedo-boats meets with the approval of
members of Congress because they can be
quickly constructed, while a cruiser or a
battle-ship could not be built inside a year.
All of these matters were discussed at the
meeting of the Cabinet to-day. The Presi
dent also read to the Cabinet a letter he has
Just received from Consul- General Lee
stating that, although the American colony
were apprehensive for his safety and had
advised him to leave Cuba, he would never
theless stick to his post of duty. Notwith
standing General Lee's confidence in his own
security various members of the Cabinet
expressed fear that in the event of an up
rising, which General Blanco might be un
able to quell, he would become a victim of
the mob. For this reason gratification was
expressed by all that the Montgomery would
soon be in the port of Havana.

FIFTY MILLIONS VOTED
TO UPHOLD THE PRESIDENT
IN DEFENDING THE NATION
Never Before in the Present Decade Have Such
Patriotic Speeches Been Made in Congress
by Representatives Aroused to De
fend the Honor of Old Glory.
RESOLVED, That there is hereby appropriated out oF any money in the Treasury
not otherwise appropriated, For the national deFense, and For each and every purpose
connected therewith, to be expended at the discretion oF the President and to remain
available until June 30, 1899, $50,000,000.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 8.
In a spirit of patriotism, with elo
quent words ringing in their ears, every
member of the House of Representa
tives to-day responded to the Presi
dent's first call to meet the Spanish situ
ation by casting his vote for a bill plac
i ing in President McKinley's hands $50,
oqo.ooo to be expended at his discretion
for the national defense. Party lines
were swept away, and with a unani
mous voice Congress voted its confi
dence in the administration. Many
members who were paired with absent
colleagues took the responsibility of
breaking their pairs, an unprecedented
thing in executive annals, in order that
they might go on record in support of
this vast appropriation to maintain the
I dignity and honor of their country.
Speaker Reed, who, as the presiding
officer, seldom votes, had his name
called and voted in his capacity as a
Representative.
The scene of enthusiasm that greeted
the announcement of the vote â ayes
311, noes oâhas0 â has seldom been paralleled
lin the House. All day long the gal
leries were jammed with enthusiastic
spectators, applauding to the echo the
sterling patriotism of the words of
eloquence which were uttered by the
members on the floor. All the speeches
were brief. Although four hours were
allowed for debate, so great was the
pressure of time that no one member
was given more than five minutes, and
most of them had to content themselves
with a beggarly fraction of a minute.
In all fifty-nine speeches were made,
With one acclaim members from the
North and South. East and West, the
States and the territories, battle-scarred
veterans of the Union and the Confed
erate armies, all joined in proclaiming
their support of the country's chief
magistrate in the face of a possible for
eign war. In the whole debate there
was only a slight discordant note,
caused by the speech of General Bing
ham of Pennsylvania, a gallant soldier
who served with distinction under Han
cock. He spoke too conservatively for
the aroused temper of the House, and
when he insisted that our relations with
Spain were as friendly as they had been
for years many of the members hissed
him. While almost every member who
spoke deprecated the possibility of war,
a wide divergence of opinion as to how
close were hostilities manifested itself
in the debate. The general contention
SPANISH JINGO SERVES THE YELLOW JOURNAL
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, March B.â The well-informed Madrid cor
respondent of the Temps is correct in his statement con
firming my dispatch of two or three days ago, saying
the Spanish Government had no Intention of asking for
the recall of General Lee.
The Central News correspondent Is not correct In
issuing a telegram in a contrary sense, and It may be
useful to those desirous of knowing the truth from the
reverse in these critical times to know that the Central
News and the New York Journal's correspondent here is
one and the same person, he being a member of the
staff of the Imparcial, which is the greatest jingo paper
published in Spain, and whose New York correspondent
busies himself dally cabling over here all the items
most likely to inflame the Spanish public, while the cor
respondent here telegraphs to the United States every
thing possible to irritate the jingoes and complicate the
situation.
The combination Is a very dangerous one until un
veiled in all its mischievous bearings.
The alleged opinion given by Cardinal Rampolla for
the Pope favorable to the insurgents is noted here merely
as another of the innumerable falsehoods to which the
yellow press has given birth.
by the majority among the leaders on
both sides was that this appropriation,
by preparing for war, would prove the
surest guarantee of peace. Others in
sisted that war's alarms would soon be
heard, and Mann of Illinois declared
that war actually existed in all save
name. The speeches which attracted
most attention were those of Cannon,
Henderson and Dolliver on the Repub
lican side, and Bailey and Sayers on the
Democratioside.
As soon as the journal had been read
the Speaker rapped for order, and. amid
a deep silence. Chairman Cannon of
fered, as a deficiency bill, the measure
appropriating $50,000,000 for the nation
al defense. It included also several
other items, among which are $100,000
for coal for naval vessels.
When the reading of the bill con
cluded with the item of $50,000,000 for
the national defense a spontaneous
outburst of applause went up from the
members and the galleries. Cannon
and Sayers. the minority member of
the Appropriations Committee, then
mutually proposed the agreement they
had privately made before the House
met for three hours' general debate on
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the bill, to be followed by one hour's
debate under the five-minute rule.
Barrett (R.) of Massachusetts asked
if the opportunity would be allowed for
amendment, and when Cannon an
swered that he did not know, he ob
jected. His objection was greeted with
hisses and loud cries of "Vote! Vote!"
Barrett, yielding to the urgent ap
peals of the Republicans about him.
withdrew his objection, and the agree
ment as to time was formally ratified.
After the confusion which followed
this dramatic scene had subsided Can
non took the floor to open the debate
on the. bill. He spoke calmly and brief
ly, explaining that the Items in the bill,
save the last, were strictly deficiency
items.
Coming to the all-absorbing item, he
said that, in the present critical con
dition of affairs, the committee had
deemed it wise to appropriate this
sum, placing its expenditure in the
complete discretion of the President.
He referred to the fact that the com-
mittee had been unanimous in its ac
tion and had only changed the wording
of the bill he introduced yesterday by
making the appropriation available un
til January, 1899, instead of June 30,
1899. This, he pointed out, would tide2

the adminstration over the time of the
probable adjournment of Congress.
"We have the money in the
treasury to meet this appropriation if
it is expended," he continued, "an-i
therefore there is not presented with
this proposition one to borrow money
or to increase taxation, which almost
any other nation on earth would be
obliged to resort to." (Tremendous ap
plause.)
The appropriation, he contended, was
extraordinary. Its object was to em
power the President in an orderly way
to prepare for contingencies. He in
sisted that this appropriation must not
be construed into a threat. Nothing
was further from the minds of those
who reported it. This appropriation
whs to be placed in the hands of a wise
and patriotic executive to make
proper preparations to maintain the
national honor, nothing more.
"It is not a war appropriation," said
he emphatically. "I say that, in my
Judgment, it is a peace measure. The
raiment of the United States would
not, if it could, trench upon the rights
of any nation on earth." (Great ap
plause, i
Savers of Texas, the ranking member
of the minority, followed Cannon. His
tlrst statement, to the effect that, in
the presence of possible danger, this
appropriation had met with the hearty
unanimous indorsement of the Appro
priation Committee without regard to
party, aroused the House to enthu
siasm. He, too. declared that it could
not be construed as a threat. It was
simply a wise and patriotic precaution
âthe arming of the executive with
power to maintain our dignity after
Congress adjourned. Sayers expressed
confidence that the money voted would
be wisely and economically expended
and closed amid great applause by
saying that he for one would be found
giving honest and sincere support to
the President in his efforts to support
the honor and dignity of the American
nation.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri began by
Baying that the hour for action had
arrived and that the American people
must face an important emergency â
an emergency in which no American
citizen could falter or hesitate as to
his duty. At such a time, he said, party
should fade away and the coun
try should act ;is one man.
Livingston <D.) of Georgia supported
the measure in a vigorous speech. He
said he took this position because he
believed that an emergency exists, but
he contended that if the administra
tion had acted as it should have done
twelve months ago in declaring a state
of belligerency, the present occasion
for voting emergency money would
have been avoided.
Allen (D.) of Mississippi was next
: . nized amid general expectancy.
He did not make a humorous speech,
but a patriotic one.
'I desire," he said, "to say for the
people I represent and for the south
ern section of the ccmntry, for the en
tire country, that there was never a
time when all were so ready to give an
administration all the money it may
need to preserve the honor, the dignity
and the general welfare of the country,
to say nothing of fair play and jus
tice."
The people of the South, he contin
ued, ask for nothing more. They are
not jingoes nor extremists, but they
are facing the emergency calmly and
quietly, only asking that the country's
iii.-iitutions and traditions may be
protected and respected. They do not
want to hurt anybody, and are not
urging any rash action, but they are
ready to honor any draft, whether for
men or money, to keep the flag afloat.
McÃae (D.) of Arkansas followed in
similar strains. He said the occasion
was the most important that had con
fronted the people in the last half
century. If necessary to protect our
honor or dignity he was willing to
increase the appropriation to any ex
tent required, for the flag which float
ed over the Capitol was his flag and
the flag of his people, and it must be
kept there.
Bell (Pop.) of Colorado spoke ear
nestly for the bill. There were, he
eaid, now no Populists, no Republicans
and no Democrats, but all were Ameri
can citizens. There was no time to
dwL-li upon what might have been, but
It was enough to know that the time
had come when the Government need
ed support.
Northway (R.) of Ohio declared that
he did not consider the bill a war
measure, but rather a* one calculated
to preserve and secure peace. At the
same time, he said, we all know full
well that there is a spirit of war
abroad, and our relations with other
countries appear to render this step
necessary. He was pleased to see that
the members were speaking, not as
partisans, but as patriots, bringing to
his mind the familiar lines:
"Breathes there a man with soul so
dead.
"Who to himself hath never said,
"This is my own, my native land."
Boutelle (R.) of Maine, chairman of
the Committee on Naval Affairs, said
that while no argument was necessary
on this measure he desired to say that
he had been instructed by his commit
tee to express the hearty indorsement
of that committee. His only regret, he
said, was that this appropriation was
not allowed to stand absolutely alone
as a proclamation to our country, and
to the world that Congress stood ready
to vote millions to arm the executive
to uphold the dignity of the flag.
Hopkins (R.) of Illinois after stat
ing his great confidence in the Presi
dent expressed the hope that there
would be no war. Thirty-three years
of peace, he said, had not obliterated
the ravages of the civil war. We did
not want its horrors repeated. "We
are too powerful to play the bully, too
Christian to want to engage in war.
Let us not be hysterical. Let us show
the world that moderation and firmness
are more than bustle and bravado;
that a wise conservatism will do more
than Jingoism to obtain the independ
ence of Cuba.
Cooper (P.) of Texas in a speech of
two minutes recalled the eloquent
words: "Millions for defense, but" not a
cent for tribute."
Our coast was exposed, he said, from
Maine to the Rio Grande, and in the
taee of war it was the duty of all with
out regard to party to support any
measure for the national defense.
"The aspirations of my soul," he con
cluded, "are that war may be avoided,
but should it come, I say to you in be
half of my beloved Texans that they
will rush to the nation's defense cheer
fully."
Bland (D.) of Missouri said that
while no debate was essential to the
passage of the bill, it was important
to show the country and the world that
the American people through their
Representatives without distinction of
: party were ready to uphold the admin
istration in the present crisis.
Fitzgerald (D.) of Massachusetts
took occasion to refer to an alleged ut
terance of a Catholic priest same time
ago to the effect that if war came the
sympathy and support of the Catholic
church would be with Spain because
it was a Catholic country. While, he
said, he did not believe the priest had
uttered such a sentiment, it had at
tracted widespread attention, and as
a Catholic he desired to repudiate it.
If war came the people of that faith,
he declared, would be more willing to
shed their blood in defense of their
country than those who had valiantly
defended it in the War of the Revolu
tion, the War of ISI2, the Mexican War
and the Civil War.
McMillln (D.) of Tennessee, while
reiterating his firm belief in the doc
trine of the strictest economy in pub
lic expenditures, said he gave the bill
his hearty support.
Wheeler (D.) t/f Alabama also en
thusiastically supported the bill, as did
Briggs (D.) of New York and Gros
venor (R.) of Ohio.
Grosvenor aroused the House to
cheers by his eulogy of the President's
patriotism. He began thus:
"Saxon and Norman and Dane are
we.
"But we are all Danes In our wel
come to thee."
"Thus spake the heart of the great
British public when the daughter of
the Sea King came to her shores.
Democrat and Populist and Republi
can are we, but we are all true to the
nag of our country to-day. Mr.
Speaker, no more inspiring picture can
be witnessed anywhere on earth than
the demonstrations which we have
seen during the last thirty, sixty and
ninety days of the power of a great
people, a free government, not only to
stand for the flag of their country, the
unity of the Government, the suprem
acy of the constitution, but for their
dignity and calmness exhibited in the
face of the world. The American people
have had a great deal to stir the blood
of enthusiawi, a great deal to carry
them off the feet of their calm judg
ment. But the picture that the world
has seen is the picture of a nation
calmly studying every question as it
arose, and as step by step danger
seemed to come, threatening with its
dark frowning face, all distinctions
fled away. It will be worth more than
$50,000,000 to the American people to
know that the great heart of this peo
ple is a unit in favor of the Govern
ment. [Applause.] I have long thought
that it was possible that war might be
a benefit to our country in this direc
tion, but the demonstration of the last
thirty days and its culmination, which
is to take place in this capitol to-day
and to-morrow, takes the place in the
judgment of mankind of war, as an j
evidence of the unity of a mighty na- j
tion. [Applause.] How magnificently j
has this duty been approached and j
performed? A doubt about the Ameri- j
can people! Hesitation about the char- !
acter of the executive! A man who j
marched and fought at Antietam and
in the Vailey of Virginia, who followed i
the fortunes of Sheridan in the great i
charge- of that memorable campaign, |
who stood from his boyhood of IS years )
to his manhood in the face and fire of j
battle â does anybody doubt where his i
loyalty is, where his patriotism, where I
his courage is? [Applause.]
"Calmly and deliberately he has con
sidered every threatening circumstance,
and calmly and deliberately behind
him have stood 75.000,000 of people con
fident in him, confident in the patriot
ism of the people, true and faithful to
the loyalty that has come to us from
a thousand battle-fields that saved the
Union. How magnificent it is! I said
some days ago that I had longed to
live until I might know that this people
was a united people. I have always felt
that the actions of 1861 to "65 were poor
ly done, that the blood was ill spilled
if at the end of this long period we
had not a united nation. Thank God.
I have lived to see the hour come, the
day dawn and universal loyalty the
watchword of every man, woman and
child." (Applause.)
He concluded with the statement
that he would not vote for the bill as
a war measure.
Bromwell of Ohio spoke earnestly for
the bill.
Hay (D.) took advantage of the op
portunity to refer in complimentary
terms to the part that Consul-General
Lee is playing in thÂ«? present contin
gency. He said that General Lee was
sustaining so well the good name of the
State in performing his duty as to win
the encomiums of the entire nation, and
that at such a time it was a gen
uine satisfaction to have such a man
as Fitzhugh Lee at such a post.
The reference to General Lee called
up loud applause, both from the floor
and the galleries.
Berry (D.) of Kentucky said that
Kentucky was willing to make the ap
propriation $500,000,000 if necessary and
the soldiers who had followed Old Hick
ory to New Orleans and Scott to Mex
ico were willing, if necessary, to follow
the same flag they followed then until
it should wave triumphantly from Mnrrn
Castle. The soldiers of Kentucky would
move eltow to elbow with those of
Massachusetts.
Terry (D.) of Arkansas said there
were worse things than war. While
Arkansas was not able to attack, her
sons would be there whenever it should
come. If occasion should call the State
would send 100,000 defenders of the
flag.
Lewis (D.) of Washington said the
Pacific Coast was as loyal to the pres
ent emergency as any other section.
Right or wrong, he was for his country.
Cochran (D.) of Missouri said he
would vote for the bill because it would
signalize the building up of another
commonwealth, and be an admonition
to Spain that Cuba was forever lost.
He accepted it as a war measure and
as a consolation to Gomez and his fol
lowers.
Blngham (R.) of Pennsylvania
caused the first note of discordance
that was heard. While supporting the
bill on general principles, he was avow
edly out of sympathy with the common
Interpretation of the meaning of the
bill, and as a consequence he was vig
orously hissed twice during the prog
ress of his remarks â once when he re
ferred to General Lee, and at the close,
when he asserted that the relations be
tween the United States and Spain are
in no way strained.
Bingham began by referring to the
day's proceedings of the House as akin
to the "methods of yellow dog Journal
ism." He had no sympathy, he said,
with the apparent tendency of the
House, and especially none with the
evident disposition to seize the oppor
tunity for a display of Jingoism that
was by no means edifying. Still, Bing
ham announced hfs purpose to support
the bill.
"I care nothing," he exclaimed, "for
the bravery and courage of Mr. Lee of
which we hear so much on this floor,"
and he was proceeding to say that what
we want in General Lee at theÂ«present
time is the exhibition of his best Judg
ment and common sense, but the sen
tence was almost drowned in the
shower of hisses with which the re
martt was received.
This evidence of disapproval came es
pecially from the Democratic side. It
did not appear to disconcert Bingham,
who continued his remarks by a gen
eral disparagement of the war spirit.
"I favor this appropriation," he said,
in conclusion, "but I condemn on this
floor to-day the utterances of any de
claration that the relations of this
country with Spain are otherwise than
they have been for years past â friend
ly, reasonable, International relations."
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1898.
CAPTAIN CHARLES O'NEIL, U. S. N., Chief of the
Bureau of Ordnance.
This utterance was received with
hisses, which were only suppressed by
a vigorous pounding of the Speaker's
gavel.
De Armond (D.) of Missouri was
pleased at the unanimity displayed,
manifesting more a love for liberty
than a spirit of partisanship. â¢
In strong contrast with the reception
given to Bingham was that of Dolliver
(R.) <rf lowa, one of the most eloquent '
members of the House.
"Mr. Speaker," said Mr. Dolliver,
"with a thousand relations of direct
national interest, not to speak of the
larger and higher relations of human
ity, the United States during the
course of the Cuban insurrection has
consistently acted within a strict in- ,
terpretation of the law of neutrality.
We have literally stood aloof, while â 
the Spanish Ministry has feebly and ,
vainly labored t<> restore its authority j
in the island of Cuba. In thÂ« midst '
of the noise and confusion of that sit
uation the President of the United
States has stood unmoved by clamor in
Congress or out, steadily keeping the
nation within the accepted code of in
ternational duty in the great hope of
peace â peace without the loss of lib
erty for Cuba, and peace without the
loss of respect for ourselves. (Ap
plause.)
"In that attitude it is gratifying for
every one of us to know that he has
had the support of the American peo
ple, a support that has drawn ail the
closer to him in these days of patient
waiting, as we have, under the shadow
of a great national affliction, been i
searching for the bodies of c/ur dead
in the harbor of Havana. Great and
In many respects permanent prepara- j
tions have been made for the national
defense, and it is altogether proper
that the Congress of the United States !
at this time should have a share in the j
responsibilities.
"Let us this day, therefore, laying
aside all the differences of party poli
tics, give to the President of the United
States, not in a bare and meager way,
but in the spirit of the broadest patriot- â 
Ism. this earnest avowal of the national \
confidence. I cannot endanger the
cause of peace to have the world un
derstand that our solemn purpose of
avoiding as far as possible the infernal
horrors of war, does not include any .
inclination to spare either blood or j
treasure in the protection of the na
tional riphts or in the discharge of na
tional duties." (Applause).
Davidson (R.) of Wisconsin paid a
tribute to the "superb American who
was doing his duty at Havana," which
was loudly applauded.
Walker (R.) of Virginia, who was a
general in the Confederate army, said j
his people were for peace if peace could
be maintained with honor. They knew
the horrors of war. and they shrank in
stinctively from its renewal, but they
would do their duty If it came.
Mann (R.) of Illinois declared that
this appropriation meant war, and was
heartily indorsed by the people of the
West. War was not coining; it already |
existed.
De Graffenried (D.) of Texas ex
pressed his pleasure that the South at |
last was able to dispel the lie, so often
reiterated, that she was still disloyal.
If war came, the red stripes of the flag
would become redder by the blood of
the Southern people, who were ready to
die in its defense.
Dinsmore (D.) of Arkansas said he
would vote for the bill because he be
lieved that eternal vigilance was the
price of liberty.
Bailey, the Democratic leader, sup
ported the bill in a five-minute speech.
Bailey said: "This is an extraordi
nary power with which to cloth,e th*
President. It is a power, which, in
the ordinary times, I would not com
mit to any man, however exalted his
station or however high his character.
But, sir, these are not ordinary times,
and the rules of safety and of pru
dence which govern us in days of peace
will yield before the great emergency
which now confronts the nation. It
ought to be understood in Spain and it
ought to be understood in every coun
try on the globe that, while this great
republic sincerely desires to be at
peace, it is prepared for war, if war
becomes inevitable." [Loud applause.]
"I hope the crisis may be reached and
passed without a conflict of arms; but
I confess that my judgment and hope
are at variance in this respect. I fear
that we have gone too far to escape
the worst, and while I believe that we
have gone farther than would have
been necessary if at the proper time we
had granted the prayer of the Cuban
patriots and had simply recognized
their right to fight for the independ
ence of the country â [loud ap
plause] â yet the time for that discus
sion has passed. We must deal with
this question as it is, not as we would
have it to be; and, approaching it in
this broader spirit, we stand ready to
say to those who administer the Gov
ernment that whatever may be needed
for the national honor and the national
defense, we are ready to give and give
ungrudgingly. [Applause.]
"I hope wise counsels will prevail,
and that if war shall come it will come
upon a great and sufficient cause. I
have no sympathy with those rash and
intemperate spirits who would provoke
war simply for the sake of fighting;
and yet I would rather follow them
and suffer all the miseries and misfor
tunes their heedles.sness would bring
than to follow these other contemptible
mercena'-y creatures who are crying
out for 'Peace at any price.' [Great
applause.] Peace is desirable, but not
so desirable that it be purchased at the
sacrifice of national honor. Let us in
this way adopt the motto of our fathers
in the elder and better days of this re
public, and let us say to all the world
now as then: 'We are ready to spend
millions for defense, but not one cent
for tribute.' ; .-< ; plause.J And let us
add another and ijobler motio: 'We are
for peace as ions as it can be main
tained with honor, but we are for honor
if war is aecesftary to defend our flag
or protect the rights of American citi
zens anywhere throughout the world.'
[Applause.] This war, if war it be, will
have another â  ompensation. It will for
ever efface from the memory of our
countrymen those dreadful times of
civil strife, and the men whose courage
made the first Manassas one of the
world's historic battlefields will join
with those who immortalized Gettys
burg, and together they will consecrate
a new battlefield combining the glories
of both." [Great applause.]
Henderson (It.) of lowa said: "I
have read of the elder days of the re
public. I have lived in the better days
of the republic [Applause.] The les
son of this afternoon is a beautiful one.
In the elder days there were Tories. I
fear a Tory would be thrown out of
this hall this afternoon. (Applause).
But. Mr. Speaker, there will be no war.
That is my judgment. I do not believe
that war is hanging over the American
people. In this republic our great aim
should be for peace. The truest pa
triot is he who secures and keeps peace
for his people. It is easy to be an ani
mal. It is easy to use claws and teeth
to fight. He who can hold aloft in his
country the white flag of peace â not of
cowardiceâ stands- nearest to his God.
[Applause.] No country on earth
would seek to avoid war as this coun
try does. No country on earth need
fear less than America. [Applause.]
With our boundless resources, with our
great credit, with a great people, no
matter what their past, we are abso
lutely uniteci in standing as one man, I
say that no country is so well armed
for war as the United States of Ameri
ca. I do not speak for lowa, I speak
as a citizen of the United States, and
I believe that to-day we are heart and
hand together for what is best for this
republic.
"The young man who to-day pledges
all the vigor of his early manhood
for his country commands respect, but
I do not believe he will have to use
it. I have had letters from people
wanting us to take Cuba to punish
Spain. I simply write back that no in
ternational law makes the United
States the regulator of the wrongs of
earth. God has written no motto on
the banner of our country that de
mands of us the regulation of the
wrongs of other countries to their peo
ple. We all sympathize with the lib
erty-loving and fighting Cubans, but
they are the citizens of another gov
ernment. So long as that question is
before us I follow the advice of Wash
ington in commanding that we mind
strictly our own business. [Applaus.?.]
But if they touch the rights of this
country or dare to lay unholy hands
upon our territory or our rights, then
I become a fighting Quaker and will
join the vigorous manhood of my
young friend who spoke. [Applause.]
But let ub not lose our heads while our
hearts are beating. He can fight best
who keeps his blood the coolest. He
can save his people the best who
thinks most before striking. This ad
ministration, President and Cabinet,
is as patriotic as any man on this floor,
and I claim no more for it. [Applause.]
This administration will look before it
leaps. This day's work and to-mor
row's shows that when the leap is
taken this country will bo back of it."
[Applause.]
Shafroth (Sil. R.) of Colorado gave
three reasons for his support of the
measure, as follows:
First â Because it was a measure of
defense.
Second â Because it expressed confi
dence in the President and was an as
surance that Congress and the country
would stand by him.
Third â Because it was a declaration
to the world that although the people
were divided on political matters, when
it came to a question of the national
honor and the national defense we are
united.
Lacey (R.) of lowa refused to even
consume the brief two minutes of time
awarded him, saying that he thought
the most effective and eloquent action
would have been to call the roll with
out any speech-making.
Mercer (R.) of Nebraska opened with
the remark, "God reigns and the Re
publican party at Washington still
lives," which was greeted with laugh
ter. Mercer said this was the greatest
country on earth in time of peace, and
he had no doubt it would prove the
greatest country on earth in time of
war if called upon to display its spirit.
Settle (D.) of Kentucky spoke eulo
gistically of the President. ' lie said
he had told the Democrats of Kentucky
that he would support Mr. McKinley in
every good work he might inaugurate,
and he was here to redeem the pledge.
His only regret was that the oppor
tunity had not presented itself before,
for he thought the curtain should bft
rung down on the horrible drama
which was being enacted off the south
ern border of this country.
Maguire of California said he sup
ported the bill becaused he believed,
upon the assurance coming from the
President of the United States, who
was in a position to know that the ap
propriation was reasonably necessary
as a precaution against the present
danger of war.
"It is probably true," said he, "as
stated by Chairman Cannon that this
is not a war measure and that war is
not imminent, but such an extraordi
nary appropriation cannot be made as
an ordinary peace measure. It is neither
prudent, justifiable, nor safe to follow
the example of monarchical nations by
putting or keeping this nation on a war
footing in times of peace. To do so
would involve more danger than pro
tection to our free institutions."
Speaking of the attitude of the Pacific
Coast, he said: "The people of Califor
nia and of the whole Pacific Slope are
ready to back up the Federal Govern
ment in every reasonable preparation
to resist invasion or to uphold the
honor or maintain the rights of this
Government. Their loyalty is ever
present and needs no pledge or guaran
tee from their Representatives here."
In reply to General Grosvenor's sug
gestion that the President could be
trusted because of his loyalty and mili
tary service during the war, he said:
"I do not trust him because he followed
Sheridan through the Shenandoah Val
ley, nor because of anything else in his
military career or civic record, but be
cause a majority of my fellow-citizens
have selected him as one supremely
worthy of trust and confidence, and
because I believe that clothed with this
power he will not abuse public con
fidence."
Minor speeches were made by Bruck
ner (D.) of Michigan, Sparkman (D.) of
Florida, Stokes (D.) of North Carolina,
Bartlett (D.) of Georgia. Green (Pop.)
of Nebraska, Keller (Pop.) of South
Dakota, Spalding (R.) of Michigan,
Ferris (R.) of Indiana, Graff (R.) of
Illinois, L,acey (R.) of lowa, Prince (R.)

Marsh (R.) of Illinois, Brumm (R.) of
Pennsylvania, Callahan, Delegate, Ok
lohoma; Ferguson, Delegate, New
Mexico; Gibson (Rep.) of Tennessee.
Lovering (R.) Â«<f Massachusetts and
Fleming (D.) of Georgia. The debate
closed at 4:20 p. m.
When the question was put on the
passage of the bill the whole House
rose en masse in its favor, but Cannon
asked for the ayes and noes. He did
so, he said, at the request of many
members who desired that every mem
ber should go on record.
Every member present voted for the
bill, many of them assuming the re
sponsibility of breaking their pairs in
order to place themselves on record. At
the conclusion of the roll call the
Speaker had his name called, an un
necessary proceeding, and amid great
applause voted for the bill. 'When he
announced the vote, 311 ayes, noes none,
an enthusiastic demonstration occurred.
The House then at 4:55 o'clock ad
journed.
WILL BE SPEEDILY
PASSED BY THE SENATE.
WASHINGTON. March B.â To-day's
session of the Senate was largely de
voted to the consideration of the Dis
trict of Columbia appropriation bill.
After an extended discussion the bill,
containing a provision for the reduc
tion of about one-half of the present
rates of telephone charges in the dis
trict, was passed.
During the debate on the telephone
amendment Berry of Arkansas criti
cized Faulkner of West Virginia, say
ing that a man who sent out tons of
anti-monopoly literature in 1S:?6 ought
not to be supporting a monopoly now.
Faulkner retorted that he did not be
lieve the Democratic party wanted ac
tion first and investigation afterward.
Gorman of Maryland advocated
awaiting the action of the committee
which was investigating the question.
He denounced the charges made by
Senator Berry against Faulkner "as
one of the most outrageous attacks in
the history of the Senate."
The bill for the relief of the Metho
dist Episcopal church. South, of Ten
nessee, appropriating $288,000, was then
passed after a brief debate.
Morgan of Alabama in supporting the
bill said this was a fitting opportunity
to pass this bill, when just a short time
ago a measure had been sent by the
House to the Senate providing for
money to be used in anticipation of a
war â a war which, should it come,
would be fought by a country now
thoroughly united. '
At 4:50, during the discussion of the
bill, a messafe was received from the
House conveying to the Senate the bill
appropriating sso,lÃ3,ooo for national de
fense. Just passed by the House. The
bill was laid before the Senate, and on
motion of Allison of lowa referred to
the Committee on Appropriation.
Allen of Nebraska presented and se
cured the adoption of a resolution call-
Ing upon the Attorney-General to In
form the Senate how many writs of
Injunction were granted during 1597-98
by the United States courts against
labor leaders and labor organizations,
with certified copies of such writs, af
fidavits and other papers.
At 5:45 o'clock the Senate adjourned.
COMMENT OF THF
ENGLISH PRESS
LONDON, March 9.â The Morning
Post editorially comments on the
adoption of the Cannon resolution by
the House, and adds: It is an em
phatic way of saying that the Ameri
can statesmen intend to stand by their
declarations. People who talk about
national honor and responsibility ought
to be prepared to put their money
down.
The Daily News says: Speaking
generally, the United States never are
prepared for war. Yet. It cannot be
said that their diplomacy has suffered
from this palpable and notorious truth.
Therefore the assertions ut American
statesmen that they are voting Â£10,
000,000 as a peace measure are hardly
convincing explanations of this sudden
change from tranquil inactivity to
acute vigilance. Our Washington cor
respondent has obtained from a mem
ber of the executive Cabinet a positive
assurance that the Maine disaster had
nothing to do with the vote. This is
a most important declaration, looking
to the fact that President McKinley
may not always be able to control pub
lic opinion. America and Spain would
be wise to find some honorable way
out of a hopeless and discreditable
deadlock.
COMPILING THE
MUSTER ROLLS
Assessors Are Inquiring
for Abie-Bodied
Citizens.
More Cere Being Taken in the
Work This Year Than
Ever Before.
Collector Block Says He Has Had No
Orders â Those Who Compose
the Militia.
With the beginning of March the As
sessor's deputies started on their
rounds, but this year they have added
a feature which in past years has
been rather overlooked. It is the
duty of the Assessor in every county
but San Francisco to turn in to the Su
pervisors a correct roll of the persons
within his district who are liable for
military duty; in San Francisco this
is done by the Tax Collector.
Last year there was no roll made out
by the Assessor, on the ground that it
was not his legal duty to attend to it,
and so the Tax Collector had to make
it out by himself with no accurate in
formation to go by. This year, how
ever, there has been no clash of au
thority; the Assessor's deputies are
making the canvass at the same time
that they are making out the tax 10I!
and the Tax Collector will from the
statistics thus gained make out a roll
more complete than any that has been
made in some time.
The section of the Political Code
which provides for the making out of
these military rolls reads as follows:
Section 1897. The District or County As
sessor of each and every. revenue district
or county of this State must, at the same
time in each year when he prepares a
roll containing the taxable inhabitants of
his district or county, enroll all the in
habitants thereof subject to military
duty, which roll must be sworn to by him
and delivered to the clerk of the Board of
Supervisors at the time he delivers the
assessment roll. In the city and county
of San Francisco the Tax Collector must
perform the duties by this section im
posed upon Assessors.
The penalty for a neglect of this duty
is a fine of not more than $1000 nor less
than $300, in addition to such other
penalties as neglect of duty may bring.
These rolls must be verified by the
Boards of Equalization and a copy
must be sent to the brigadier-general in
whose brigade any particular county
may be.
It is this work which is being done
now more thoroughly than ever before
It has always been a sort of perfunc
tory duty, but the situation this year
has made it of the utmost importance,
and it is being done well.
Tax Collector Block, who will make
out the final rolls, says there have been
no orders issued to him to rush matters
in that direction, either from the State
or from the Federal Government, and
he says so far as he knows no orders
have been issued to Assessor Siebe. It
is a fact, however, that the assessors
are making particular inquiries as to
able-bodied citizens, a characteristic
which in previous years uas not promi
nent in the deputies' work.
There is much confusion in regard to
the exact meaning of the term "militia"
and just who is and who is not liable
for military duty in this State. Every
person subject to military duty is a
member of the enrolled militia. Sec
tion 1895 of the Political Code defines
those subject to military duty as:
Every able-bodied male inhabitant of
this State, except Mongolians and In
dl:ins between the ages of 18 and 4o
years, not exempt by law. But no alien
is obliged to serve or bear arms against
the State to which his allegiance is due.
The code then goes on to define who
is exempt under the law. These are:
Ministers of religion, civil and military
officers of the United States, officers of
foreign Governments, civil officers of
the State of California, all persons ex
empt from military duty by the laws
of the United States. The United States
exemptions are almost similar.
It is these militia rolls which the as
sessors are now compiling. When com
pleted they will show over 100,000 men
liable for duty in this city.
The National Guard is but a branch
of the enrolled militia. Under the code
it is known as the "organized and uni
formed militia of the State of Califor
nia." It is composed of those liable for
military duty who are willing to prac
tice such duty in times of peace. Its
formation follows that of the regular
army until the brigade is reached; then
that formation becomes more than a
mere military unit. The brigade not
only includes those companies of the
National Guard under command of the
brigadier-general, but all the militia
within its geographical limits, and in
case of a draft the assessors' rolls would
be taken out and the ranks would be
filled much in the same manner as a
lottery is drawn. It is the duty of the
brigadier-general to keep informed as
to how many men he has within the
limits of his brigade amenrfble to mili
tary service, and he must send copies
of his rolls to the War Department.
The rolls now being compiled must
be in the hands of the brigadier-gene
ral in time to allow him to have his
muster rolls made out from them by
the first day of October; but it can be
done sooner, and will be should the oc
casion arise.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Major General Miles said to me to
night: "We do not know how much
of the new appropriation the President
will decide to allot to the War Depart
ment. It is not likely that any definite
apportionment will be made to each de
partment, but expenditures of different
amounts will be authorized according *^
to the necessities of the situation. No
new contracts have as yet been made
by the department in view of the new
appropriation, but many large ones are
under consideration for rapid-fire and.
large-caliber sea coast guns, ammuni
tion, etc. Some of these contracts will
be for ordnance ready to hand an<t
others for supplies to be manufactured.
Representatives of the more important
ordnance manufacturers were at the
department to-day and some important
contracts will fte awarded in a day or
two. The preparations which will be
made will in all probability be no great
er than the department would have
made long ago if we had had adequate
appropriations. The War Department
alone could easily and economically
spend the entire $50,000,000 in puttlQg
the country on merely a substantial
peace footing. It can be stated that
every dollar that the President feels
justified in allotting to the War De
partment will be expended within the
limit of availability of the appropria-
tion.

SEIZURE OF AN
AMERICAN SCHOONER.
HAVANA, March B.â The Spanish
gunboat Ardilla has captured in an in
let near Casilda, on the south coast of
Cuba, the American schooner Esther,
of Edenton, N. C, bound from Pensa
cola to Jamaica.
The captain of the schooner was
asked to give the reason for the pres
ence of his vessel in the inlet, and
claimed that his rudder was broken. No
further details of the affair liaA-e bfÂ©rÂ» .
received, but if the statement of the
captain of the Esther turns out to be
correct the schooner will be liberated.
The captain has protested against the
seizure of his vessel. The Esther is of
11.31 tons gross register.

NEW YORK. March S.â The
Herald's Washington correspon
dent telegraphs: Amid the war
like preparations now actively in
progress there is a peaceful tone
to all the utterances of Federal
officials in Washington. A sense
of security has come over them
as a result of the universal sup
port given to the President's
recommendation for strengthen
ing our national defenses, and
the extraordinary action of the
House of Representatives in vot
ing without a dissenting vote un
precedented powers to the Pres
ident.
Troublesome times are still
ahead, they all admit, but they
can now use every resource of
the country to prepare for trou
ble, and they believe Spain's
knowledge of this will lead her to
hesitate and to avoid conflict.
They may misjudge the temper of the j
Spanish people, and may underestimate j
the present war sentiment in Spain, but
it is demonstrated by talks I had to
day with several high Federal officials
that they are confidently expecting our
elaborate military and naval prepara
tlona will tend to stave off rather than
provoke war.
The authorities all admit, however,
that we have not yet reached the dan
ger point of the situation. It is coming
soon.
Within a very short time the find
ings of the Court of Inquiry investl- |
gating the Maine disaster will be in j
the hands of the President. There is j
no longer a shadow of doubt in the j
minds of the administration that the ;
board will find that the vessel was I
ny. by some external agency. I t
was assured of this by a high official
who, while stating that he did not know
Just when the report would be sub- ,
mitted. said enough was already known ]
to leave no room for doubt that Spain
would be held responsible for the Maine
disaster.
While convinced, as Secretary Long
publicly stated some days ago, that
Spain as a (rovernment did not partici
pate in the affair, my informant was
equally certain that no accident caused
the disaster, and that Spain will have
to be held responsible for the loss of
the ship and the slaughter of her crew.
Further evidence of the conviction of
the administration that the fundamen
tal cause of the disaster was an out
side explosion, is to be found In the
preparation of data upon which to for
mulate a demand for indemnity from
Spain, which is now in progress.
There was another significant de
velopment to-day. I was told by a high
official that tne President is now con
sidering the advisability of coupling
the Maine disaster with the general
Cuban question. It was officially de
clared some days ago that the two
matters were to be regarded as en
tirely distinct. From what I was told
to-day, however, it seems probable that
when the demand for Indemnity is
made upon Spain it will be either
coupled with or immediately followed by
another representation In regard to the
general Cuban question, having for its
purpose the Immediate ending of the
war in Cuba. I have positive knowledge
that the President is being urged by
many influential men in Congress to
accompany his demand for indemnity
with notice to Spain that the war In
Cuba must stop, and that the United
States stands ready to use its good of
fices to bring about this result in a
manner honorable and fair to all parties
concerned.
There are some who wish the Presi
dent to go even farther and insist upon
Spain giving Cuba independence as one
of the conditions upon which we will
accept indemnity for the Maine disas
ter. It cannot be said that the Presl

dent has definitely formulated the plan
he will pursue in regard to Cuban Inter
vention, but everybody realizes, and no
one more fully than the President, that
now Congress proposes to give the ad
ministration $50,000,000 for strengthen
ing national defenses the administra
tion will be expected to take some defi
nite and positive stand in the direction
of ending the war In Cuba.
This phase of the matter was gone
into at considerable length at to-day's
Cabinet meeting. I was told by a Cab
inet officer that the question of treat
ing the Maine disaster in connection
with the chief point at issue between
the two countries was considered. One of
the arguments used was that Spain has
not only shown herself unable to con
trol her domestic affairs in Cuba but,
as demonstrated by the fearful calam
ity to the Maine, she is unable to give
proper protection to vessels in the har
bor of Havana.
Having discussed the Maine disaster,
the general Cuban question and the
prospective policy in regard to them,
the Cabinet went into a long discussion
of the best means of utilizing the $50,
000.000 for putting the country in a
state of defense. It resulted in a gen-
eral understanding that the amount
will be divided between the War and
Navy departments in proportions
which the circumstances warrant. The
bulk of the amount will, of course, be
expended under the naval establish
ment, as it is realized that it is this
branch of the service which will per
form the more conspicuous part in any
war we may have with Spain. Presi
dent McKinley cautioned prudence In
expenditures, but at the same time de
clared that no expense should be
spared in strengthening every branch
of the service which sound military
judgment will warrant. It was agreed
that the one question of prime impor
tance was the securing of more battle
ships and torpedo boats, and that no
efforts should be spared to obtain the
best that could be had.
Secretaries Long and Alger explained
at length the plans outlined by the ex
perts of their respective departments
for utilizing the money to be appro
priated, and the President felt satisfied
from their statement that it would take
i only a short time to place the country
; upon a substantial war footing.
It was learned to-night that there
! were three complaints from Spain in
\ stead of two, as seemed to be the case
! when the President issued his state
i ment last Saturday afternoon. The first
complaint related to General Lee,
which the President promptly refused.
The second referred to the warships,
i to which the President partly assent
ed by allowing the Fern to take the
place of the Montgomery. Spain's
third complaint was quickly met. It
i related to the recent mysterious visit
of Captain Crowninshield to the West
! Indies. It was asserted by Spain that
this navy officer, who is Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, had gone to
Pqrto Rico for the purpose of con
ferring with filibusters at the port and
had met a son of the Cuban leader,
General Garcia. It was charged that
Captain Crowninshield had given aid
and comfort to the filibusters and had
materially helped them to send men
and supplies to Cuba, the navy of the
United States being used for that pur
pose. There was not, of course, the
slightest foundation for this assertion,
and the President at once communi
cated to Spain an emphatic denial.
He said Captain Crownlnshield's visit
had nothing whatever to do with fili
busters and that the young man who
was supposed to be Garcia's son was
the son of Captain Crowninshield.
As quickly as the cable could bring
an apology Spain replied that the
charge had been made under a misap
prehension and that the President's
statements were accepted without
further question.

Over the Coming of

bor Bunched and a Berth
Made Vacant.

HAVANA. March B.â The arrival of
the cruiser Montgomery is awaited
with much Interest by Americans here.
The Fern moved this afternoon from
the buoy where she had been previous
ly moored, at a point near the Almlrante
Oquendo, and took a berth near the op
posite side of the harbor. The Spanish
cruiser Alfonso XII later in the day
moved down to the anchorage vacated
by the Fern, thus leaving the position
recently held by the Alfonso XII free
for the Montgomery on her arrival.
Practically the effect of these orders
of the Spanish admiral is to bunch the
Spanish ships together in the same sec
tion of the harbor, and in immediate
vicinity of the Maine wreck and Man
grove, while the Montgomery will lie
about half a mile further up from the
mouth of the harbor.
The Fern is all ready to sail as soon
as the Montgomery arrives, and the ne
cessary transfer of diving apparatus
and Captain Sigsbee's and Ensign Pow
elson's effects can be made to the
cruiser. Ensign Powelson is a regu
larly attached officer of tne Fern, but
that vessel will sail on her mission of
mercy, to carry relief to Matanzas and
Sagua without Powelson, as the Court
of Inquiry at present regards his ser
vices here as indispensable.
Captain Sigsbee, Lieutenant-Com
mander Wainwright and other officers
now quartered on the Fern, who are
detailed to duty in connection with the
Maine wreck, will transfer their head
quarters to the Montgomery. The Bache
will return to coast survey duty on
which she was engaged before the ex
plosion Bodies received hereafter are
to be transported to Key West by the
P The C^urt of Inquiry to-day con
tinued its examination of divers, and
again gave considerable of the morn ng
to a close personal inspection of the
forward portion of the wreck. Chaplain
Chidwick boarded the wreck and div
ing floats, in company with Naval Con
ductor Hoover and George Helms, the
ship's carpenter to the Maine
Powelson was not aboard the Man
prove to-day, but was continually con
sulted on and around the wreck. In
contrast with. the previous appearance
of great activity, the members 'of the
court to-day went about the work in a
leisurely manner, which revives the im
pression formerly prevalent that to use
a sporting expression, they are again
sparring for wind, or rather for time
instead of following up their leads with
more hard blows. There is no prospect
now of the court finishing here before
the end of the week, and it may remain
\qX\SQV.
As yet I see no reason to modify the
statement cabled to the Herald a week
or more ago that the public can hardly
expect a report on the cause of the
Maine disaster before the latter part of
this month.
Captain Slgsbee has not communi
cated with Washington regarding his
recall, but is nevertheless anxious to
wind up his work here and get away.
His health is gradually falling since
the Maine's destruction and now that
he is no longer sustained by excite
ment he fears a collapse. His case is
not serious, but he seldom appears in
the city now, feeling unable to get
about. He remains aboard the Fern
most of the time. -;.nf.
The Diario de la Marina declares that
Lieutenant Blandin talked so freely as
to make himself objectionable to Ma
drid and Washington. The same news
paper continues: It is to the interest
of both Governments that the court of
inquiry be explicit in its findings, and
for the court to say the explosion was
due to an unknown cause will be un
satisfactory. It must say whether the
explosion was due to external or in
ternal causes. The same paper inti
mates that Spain may expect the
United States to demand a heavy in
demnity.
Several skirmishes are officially re
ported. The scenes of the greatest
activity are in -> nar del Rio, Havana,
Matanzas and Santa Clara provinces.
The most Important engagement was
on the estate of Managua, in Pinar del
Rio, between the forces of the Spanish
general, Hernandez Velasco, and the
Insurgents under. Pino Guerra. The
rebels were dispersed after a fierce at
tack by the San Quintin battalion and
civil guards, ihe rebel loss was heavy,
many wounded being carried from the
field. The Spanish lost two killed and
had ten wounded, including Captain
Verdugo and Major Ripoles.
General Ceballos and the Lealtad bat
talion engaged Rafael Cardenas and
Alfredo Lima at Majagual, in Havana
province, killing four rebels. They de
feated them again at Vigia Hill. The
Spanish loss was small. General Gomez
is reported to be moving slowly west

fact that Secretary Long is consult
ing at every step with the represen
tatives of the legislative branch of
the Government shows the desire of
the President to keep within the
strict spirit of the Constitution.
The War Department was not be
hind the Navy. General Flagler,
Chief of Ordnance, is very busy
reaching out in every direction by
means of the telegraph and the mail
to learn just how far the resources
of the big private manufacturing
concerns can be relied on to come to
the aid of the War Department in
arming and equipping a volunteer
army, should one he found neces
sary. He will not tell what he is do
ing in this direction, holding it is not
wise to make everybody acquainted
with either our weak or strong
points. Major-General Miles is look
ing after the personnel closely and
to-day was trying hard to perfect the
organizations of two regiments of ar
tillery which Congress has granted.
The officers must be named to Con-
gress and the commissions are only
waiting on the forms. Meanwhile,
beyond the statement that the two
Senior Lieutenant Colonels of the ex
isting artillery regiments will be
made Colonels of the two new regi
ments, the names of the officers are
withheld.
The new Spanish Minister, Senor
Barnabe, will arrive in New York on
a German line steamer to-morrow.
He is expected at the Legation on
the following day, and the arrange
ments will be made then for present
ing his credentials to President Mc-
Kinley. There will be the usual ex
change of felicitations, which will be
of more than passing interest. Senor
Bernabe left Madrid before the recent
critical juncture was reached, and at
the time of his departure the new
commercial treaties were uppermost
in the interest of the Madrid author
ities. The new Minister speaks Eng
lish fluently, having been in this
country for several years. He is mar
ried, his wife being the daughter of
one of the most influential men of
Spain.
The President this afternoon
signed the Hawley bill providing for
two additional regiments of artillery
to man the coast defenses.
WANTS TO ANCHOR
IN THE DAYTIME.
The Captain of the Montgomery Does
Not Want to Give Spain the
Advantage of Darkness.
KEY WEST, Fla., March B.â "The
Montgomery does not want to enter
Havana harbor In the dark." That is
what Li-utenant-Commander Bechler,
her executive officer, said on the deck
of the Montgomery four hours before
she sailed.
"We are going to Havana," he con
tinued, "and strange as it may seem,
after the Maine's experience, this is the
happiest ship's company in American
waters to-day. We feel it a great honor
to be selected to take the place of the
Maine. We have the reputation
throughout the entire navy for being a
right tieht cruiser. We shall try to
maintain that r> mutation in Havana.
"The Montgomery does not want to
enter Havana harbor in the dark. If
we leave now -Â».Â» 1 shall reach Cuba
shortly after miinight. We want the
sun shining when we come to our an
chorage. I do i>t expect any trouble,
but we are not going to give Spai^ the
advantage of us, I can assure you."
SOLD DYNAMITE

Bought Large Quantities of the
Deadly Explosive.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.. March B.âCap
tain G. A. Hamlin. general manager of
the Dittmar Powder Company of New-
York, is visiting In this city. He con
firms the report that the Dittmar con
cern sold explosives to Weyler's agent
in November, 1896. Captain Hamlin
does not know for what purpose the
explosives were used.
"I sold to Weyler's agents 9000
pounds of dynamite In November,
1896." said Mr. Hamlin. "At the same
time, 150 miles of rubber-covered in
sulated copper wire was purchased and
sent to Cuna on the ship carrying the
dynamite. This might have been used
in the destruction of the Maine three
weeks ago to-nieht, as It was pretty
well established Weyler was using this
powerful explosive to form the most
terrible naval destroyers of modern
times."

TO STRENGTHEN
THE DEFENSES
Ordnance and Engineer
Officers Discuss Plans
to Fortify Coasts.
Assurances That Plenty of
Rapid-Fire Guns Can Be
Quickly Secured.
Improvised Mines and Torpedoes
May Also Be Turned Out by the
War Department.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March B.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Offi
cials of the Ordnance and Engineer
Departments of the War Department
were in conference to-day to discuss
plans for increasing the strength of
coast defenses with the portion of the
emergency appropriation of $50,000,000,
which it is expected will be allotted to
the army.
Brigadier-General Wilson, chief of
engineers, is absent on an inspection
tour of southern fortifications, and
Brigadier-General Flagler, chief of
ordnance, was absent from the depart
ment to-day on account of illness.
Their chief assistants, however, got to
gether and formulated general plans,
which will be submitted to their chiefs
and to the Secretary of War. Charles
Shales of the Ordnance Department
met several representatives of ord
nance manufacturing and supply firms
and received from them assurances
that they have ample facilities at their
command to furnish the department at
short notice with large supplies of
ammunition and guns of various cali
bers. It is expected that a large order
will be placed Immediately for rapfd
lire guns of 5-inch and 6-inch and
smaller caliber.
The American Ordnance Company
has on hand in this country, it is un
derstood, a considerable supply of
these guns, and through their agents
in France and England they are able
to put at the disposal of the Govern
ment immediately not less than 150
rapid-fire guns, and this number could
be greatly increased very soon. The
other ordnance companies are able to
each furnish immediately or to manu
facture rapid fire' guns and if neces
sary supplies could be drawn fron
Creusots in France, the Krupps of Ger
many and the Armstrongs of England
While some rapid fire guns are likely
to be added to the armament of points
already partially fortified more are
likely to be placed at other points
which are now altogether undefended.
Such points as in the opinion of the
engineer department require such pro
tection as could be provided by rapid
fire guns are Port Royal, S. C, where
the navy department has an altogether
unprotected drydock, Jacksonville, Key
West and Tampa, Fla., and several
ploces on the southern coast in par
ticular. M
While it has been proposed to Im
prove Dry Tortugas by mounting eight
and ten inch converted rifles on the
barbette parapet of Fort Jefferson it
is suggested by the engineering de
partment that the same number of
rapid-fire guns could be mounted
there as quickly, and would be much
more effective. By beginning work
immediately there are supplies enough
at hand to enable the engineers to
prepare emplacements and mount
several rapid-fire guns at any one
point that may be deemed necessary
In about a week. Steps will soon be
taken by the engineer department
looking to fortifying all the more im
portant harbors with torpedoes. The
department can place these immedi
ately and more can be procured
through agents of ordnance supply
companies in this country or Europe.
If necessary large quantities of impro
vised torpedoes can be manufactured
by engineer officers by the employ
ment of casks and barrels in which
may be placed about 250 pounds of
powder and which may be equipped
with double-test tubes, one filled with
sulphuric acid and the other with po
tassium chlorate and other combina
tions which will produce an explosion
upon the breaking of the test tubes
by a passing keel. The work of the
engineering department at all fortifica
tions Is being hastened, and guns and
carriages under construction are be- |
tag hurried to completion as rapidly ,
U possible. A duplication of the large
shell and powder contracts or last ,
week has been provisionally made, and .
this may be still further enlarged.
Officials of the Quartermaster s De
partment will enter upon the construe- |
linn of quarters and barracks for the
additional regiments of artillery. Ex
aminations of artillery officers who are
promoted by the provisions of the ar
tillery bill have already commenced,

BOSTON, March B.â All the modern
ammunition in the United States mag

JAPAN
MAY HELP
AMERICA
Alliance With the Mikado
Is Among the Pos=
sibilities.
In That Event Spain Would Be
Entirely Outclassed in a
War Upon the Seas.
NEW YORK, March B.â The
Washington correspondent of
the Herald says: I was told to
day that propositions are being*
considered looking to a possible
alliance between the United
States and Japan in the event
of war with Spain. I was also
told that negotiations had gone
to the extent of the preparation
of an informal memorandum
initiated by the Japanese Min
ister and Assistant Secretary of
State Day. It has not been pos
sible, however, to confirm this
report.
It was explained to me that the ob
ject of the proposed alliance is to
strengthen our naval forces on this
coast by withdrawing available ships
from Pacific and Asiatic stations,
and relying upon Japan to take the
Philippine Islands and look after Span
ish ships in the Pacific.
In consideration for this assistance
fro-m Japan, it is asserted, the United
States will agree to give some special
concession to that country in Hawaii
after the annexation of the islands
and allow Japan to obtain possession
of the Philippine Islands.
Japan is undoubtedly desirous of
getting possession of the Philippines,
but the question of joining hands
with the United States for that pur
pose is such a serious one that future
developments will have to be awaited
before it can be definitely stated that

that a row over the $440 that he still
owÂ«i the dredg - :>any was im
minent, McGrath scurried around and
raised the necessary coin, getting it
ready for payment about 10:30 o'clock.
Then he sent for President Witter of
the dredging company and announced
that he was ready to pay the balance
of the $1440 that he had collected more
tnau a year ago on the allegation that
he was the agent of the company. Wit
ter refused to accept the proffered coin
unless his partner, M. C. Harris, was
nt, and ser.t tor Harris. When the
manager arrived at the treasury where
the money was waiting in gold coin to
be paid McGrath remarked that he did
not owe the dredging company a cent,
but would rather pay the balance that
was claimed than to have any trouble.
"Well you are a fool to pay anything
you don't owe, " remarked President
Witter, and jus: then Manager Harris
stepped in.
McGrath demanded a receipt show
ing that he had acted as the ag- -:.: '
the company, but Harris refused to
give it, and then McGrath consented
to accept a receipt for the "bala.rn.-ir
due" the company. After the coin had
been turned over, Harris and McGrath
had a talk and when the former re
fused to admit that McGrath had ever
been appointed the agent of the com
pany. McGrath shouted, "You are a
Bar."
The words were hardly out of his
mouth when Harris' right fist shot out.'
and McGrath reeled against the wall
from a terrible blow on the Jaw. Harris
followed him up and Attorney Gett,
â who represented McGrath, Jumped in
to interfere. He was treated to a like
dose and went down just as McGrath
recovered and attacked Harris.
Quick as a flash, Harris put his
knee on the prostrate Gett's r.eck and
catching McGrath as he advanced put
h!s head in chancery and proceeded to
pommel him soundly. Witter and At
torney Hiram Johnson Jumped in, and
separated the combatants at this junc
ture and prevented further hostilities.
McGrath's jaw was bleeding and Har
ris had a bad cut on his hand.
The Investigation before the Board of
Supervisors developed another sensa
tion, President "Witter of the company
and Attorney Gett only being pre
vented from indulging in a personal
encounter by the intervention of a
Deputy BberlflC. AH the members but
Morrison were present. Witter was
testifying regarding certain matters
connected with th-* contract between
the Sutter Oovnty Island people,
the Supervisors and the dredging
company, when Gett took exception to
his statements and shouted. "You are
a liar, sir."
Witter was on his feet in a second
and started toward Gett, exclaiming,
"You are the arch fiend of liars. You
are at the bottom of all .this trouble."
Deputy Sheriff Kelly stepped in and
prevented Witter from reaching Gett
and the investigation went oiu
District Attorney Ryan conducted
the Investigation, which he said was
not so much for the purpose of investi
gating the bribery charges as to ascer
tain whether or not the dredging com
pany was entitled to any money from
the county. The members of the board
however, were more curious than the
District Attorney, and when P. H. Mo-
Grath was called to the stand, after
the reading of the contract, they began
to probe. They asked McGrath why
he had held out the $1440 so long. He
replied that he had been ready to turn
over $1000 at any time, but there was
an account between the county and

! obligation when the $1000 certificate of
I deposit was banded to Manager Har
; ris. He was asked why he had paid
the $440 a few hours previous.
"Because I did not want to be har
assed by a Maekmailer." he replied.
A general smile went around the as
sembly room.
Continuing, he denied that he had
: ever paid one dollar to mcmi

; had.
Supervisor Curtis wanted the hear
ing postponed until Supervisor Morri
son could be present, but no one sup
ported him, and it was decided to carry
on the Investigation, Attorney Gett was
sworn and denied having received one
dollar i>f the money collected by ifc-
Grath. He reviewed the history of the
transaction, and expressed the opinion
that the dredging company, having
done the work, was entitled to receive
its pay. either from the county or the
reclamation district.
President Witter of th*Â» company,
when called to the stand, reiterated his
charge that McGrath had told him.
when the payment of the $1440 was de
manded, that the money had been
spent in influencing members of the
Board to ;>ass the further claims of
the company.
He stated positively that McGrath
had specified Supervisors Morrison and
Jenkins as the men who had shared in
the boodle and that Attorney W. A.
Gett had received $500. Manager Harris
also testified that on February IT he
had been present in the Capitol build
ing when McGrath stated that he had
used the money to pay certain Super
visors for their influence and that $440
I not be brought back.
'"He stated positively that Morrison
and Jenkins were the men who got the
money." said Harris. "He said dur
ing that conversation that !f $*< VJV J of the
$1000 we had received from him was
properly used we would probably be
able to get our other claims allowed. It
developed during the hearing that Mc-
Grath had f.lod a second claim against
the county for $1792. of which the
dredging company knew nothing. This
was never paid."
Henry Elliott, trustee of "Reclamation
District No. 349 and county, and Sur
veyor B<~>yd were also examined regard-
Ing the character of the work dune by
the dredging company.
Grove L. Johnson represented the
dredging company and at the conclu
sion of the testimony requested that
the question of the legality of the
company's claims against the county be
referred to District Attorney Ryan to
examine the records and report to the
board. This course was adopted with
out a dissenting voice ?.nÂ«i the report
will probably be made to-morrow.

seems to be any doubt about the safety
of the gasoline schooner Bessie X,
which left San Francisco February 8
for Skaguay direct, and which was re
ported last week to have been lost
about one hundred miles above Vic
toria. The sidewheel steamer North
Pacific, which arrived in port this
afternoon, reports having passed the
Bessie X off Shelter Island at the en
trance of Lynn Canal on the afternoon
of March 3. The North Pacific found
the big steamer Cottage City of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's line
at Juneau badly used up from her
double brush with Ai&skan rocks and
sandbars. She was said to be leaking
badly, but intended to continue the trip.
The steamer Whitelaw, which was on
the rocks in sight Of Juneau, was
passed twenty miles north of that point
and going north.
The North Pacific left Skapuay on
March 3 and on the afternoon of that
day passed the gasoline schooner Bessie
K. Every one had given this little craft
. up for lost and the rumor that came
; down from the north last week that she
i had been wrecked during the big storm
was generally believed. Pilot Campbell
- that the Bessie X was off Shelter
* Island just at the entrance of Lynn
â  Canal. As they passed her the breeze
| freshened up. The gasoline engine was
shut off and her sails spread. The
1 passengers waved in answer to the
; North Pacific's whistle and nothing
i seemed to be wrung with the little
1 craft.
The Whitelaw passed the North Pa
cific about twenty miles above Juneau.
A short time before she had floated off
the bar on which she was fast for sev
eral days and was proceeding on her
; northern trip.
The North Pacific brings the first
news of the tugs Rescue and Willovra,
which :ett here several weeks ape \>,i,i
lumber barges on which a number of
passengers and cattle had been quar
\ tered. The Rescue had arrived at
â  Skaguay with everything in good order,
I but after a very hurd trip. The Wil
i lowa was in some sort of trouble, but
I had safely anchored about twenty miles
i north of Juneau. The Cottage City, the
; Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
! new steamer, was lying at Juneau when
â  the North Pacific touched there Thurs
day night. She had been ashore twice,
so the passengers told Pilot Campbell,
and was taking in considerable water.
Captain J. C. Hunter, however, in
tended to finish the trip and expected
j to leave the next morning for Skaguav.
"Old Fort Wrangel is one of the busi
; est places on the northern run just
i now," said Captain Carter this after
noon to the Call correspondent. "There
is an awful jam of freight and pros
pective Klondikers at that point. The
three big warehouses are full up to the

stating that Hildebrand had killed
himself.
Yesterday afternoon Hildebrand ar

number of saloons, taking a few
drinks. He said he was waiting for a

boats left for the city. About 7:30 in
the evening, after missing the last
boat, he visited the saloon known as
the Cottage Bar. where he obtained $1
on a silver watch from the proprietor,
giving in return a bill of sale.

SUISUN, March B.â Frank Belew this
afternoon had his first interview with
his "wife since he has been arrested and

ing his brother and sister. Mrs. Belew
was accompanied by the wife of
Photographer Bird, principal -witness
against the fratricide. Mrs. Belew first
visited District Attorney^ Devlin, and.
after remaining with him nearly an
hour, asked permission to visit her hus
band. The request was granted, and
the ladies were accompanied by Under
Sheriff Robinson.
Belew was surprised to see his wife,
and his face became deathly pale.
After the usual greeting. Mrs. Belew
proceeded to interrogate her husband
regarding his motives for committing
the horrible deed, but her Questions
only elicited replies frequently given to
similar questionsâ that he did not know,
why he poisoned his brother and sister.
Mrs. Belew then explained that the
object of her visit was to Induce him to
dispose of his share of the combined
estate of the murdered brother and sis
ter, toward the maintenance of his
small children. Belew listened ' atten
tively, and it was obvious that the
question of standing trial;*, with a pos

of more importance to him than the
maintenance of his children. Belew
expressed a desire to talk privately. to
his wife, but â¢ the Under Sheriff ob
jected.
Belew received Mrs. Bird with a look
of indifference, : his eyes betokening
the hatred he -. feels toward the Bird

acted strangely, : and Mrs. Belew â was
much affected when she bade thÂ« pris

RENEGADE
BOOKMAKERS
ARE SHUT OUT
Victory of The Call in Its Crusade
AgaiQst Gambling Schemes
at Washington, Yolo
County.
WOODLAND, Cal., March B.â T he Board of Supervisors to-day by
unanimous vote adopted an ordinance with stringent provisions which
will effectually stop the bookmakers driven out of Sacramento from
operating at Washington. Yolo County.
The above dispatch, brief and pithy, tells a story which will be hail
ed with delight by all citizens having the public morals at heart. For
months a flght against this nefarious traffic, which has cast a blight
upon fair Tolo and dragged the reputable citizens of Washington into
compankmship with the unsavory crowd who follqw the races for the
money which they can get out of them by methods which have long
since ceased to be questionable, has been going on, and in their strug
gle the better element of Tolo have always been backed and seconded
by The Call, which lost no time in exposing the methods of these pool
sellers.
About a year ago the bookmakers, driven from Sacramento, took up
their abode In the little town of Washington, just across the river. For
a time their presence there was unknown and unnoticed by the good
people of the hamlet, who, intent upon their own business, had little
time to pry into the affairs of others. After a time, however, the pres
ence of a number of well-known "sports" excited the suspicions of the
residents, and it soon became an open secret that the little hamlet was
in reality but the dumping ground for Sacramento. Ihe gamblers,
driven out of the one place, had taken refuge in the other, and were
apparently enjoying immunity from the law. True, the law in Yolo
County was just as strong as that in Sacramento, but it did not seem
to be enforced, and accusations of boodling were openly made.
It was generally understood that the law against gambling in Yolo
was enacted at the instigation of Frank Daroux, the leader of one
clique of gamblers, for the sole purpose of crushing out B. W. Cava
naugh. the leader of another faction, and that so long as the officials
were properly "fixed" the law was a dead letter.
The matter was recently looked up by The Call and a startling ex
pose was made. It appeared as though a person might do anything he
pleased in the gambling line by the judicious use of a little money.
The authorities, hitherto so lax. finally became aroused to a sense of
their duty and their action of to-day is simply the result of a long
agitation foi; a betterment of public morals and will, it is hoped, put
an end to bribe-taking and open and flagrant violations of both the
spirit and letter of the law in Yolo.

Special Dispatch tc The Call.
SEATTLE, March S.â A letter under
date of February 27 has been brought
down by the steamer Alliance from H.
B. Allen, who writes from Orca.
near the mouth of the Copper River.
He says that -within the past week the
Valdes Glacier has improred so greatly
in condition for travel that a general
movement to the interior has begun.
Ten days ago an exploring party trav
eling light returned from the interior
after a four days' absence. They made
the trip from the timber on the other
side of the range to the head of the
bay in fourteen hours.
Contrary to the general idea, the
Valdes Glacier is but fifty feet above
the sea level at this end and has a
gradual rise to the summit, seventeen
miles distant, averaging about 100 feet
to the mile. The descent on the other
side is but a trifle more of a grade.
According to recent reports it is about
one week's trip over an easy route to
the southern end of the Sickle bend
of the Copper River, where it is easily
navigable for small craft.
About four miles to the eastward of
the Valdes Glacier, at the extreme
head of Valdes Bay, the Valdes or Lit
tle River comes down from the moun
tains. Following up the course of the
river on an easy grade for about thirty
miles a narrow, high ridge is encount
ered, which precludes the passage by
trail to the other side of the range, but
it is the route already partially sur
veyed which has been selected as the
best to the interior by a railway com
pany incorporated at Phoenix. Ariz.,
last fall, whose representative. Senator
E. E. Greenlaw, has been on the ground
since December 15 looking after their
interests. They propose tunneling
through the ridge, reaching there by a
stretch of country gently undulating,
through which railway construction
will be comparatively easy. It is
claimed that Valdes Bay, being over
200 miles nearer Dawson than Dyea,
gives an immense advantage over the
latter point from whicn to begin rail
way construction. The fact of its being
an all-American route and much nearer
to all points on the Yukon below Daw
son is a strong argument in its favor.
The contour of the southern coast of
Alaska seems to many to indicate the
fact that ultimately Prince "William
Sound will be the initial point of the
permanent development of the district.
While no definite strikes have yet been
made on the Copper River, every indi
vidual prospector is enthused with the
idea that he is in the van, and if not
able to make the first big- find will be
in the company of those who do. Many
are looking also for copper, specimens
of which have been brought fromtheln
terior by the Stick Indians and in ? a
couple of instances by white men. IV
fore next fall It is safe to Rupert that
the Copper River district will furnish^
good news to a waiting world. ;.

Si>eclal Dispatch to The CalL
SAN JOSE, March S.â Thare is no dis
position on the part of the New Char
ter Club to underestimate the energy
and cunning of their adversaries in the
coming campaign. It is thoroughly
realized by the champions of good gov
ernment that no trick or device of prac
tical politics, as carried on by the
"gang," will be neglected by the lat
ter between now and the 11th of April.
The New Charter Club is perfecting
its precinct organisation and preparing
to protect the purity of the ballot from
the registration of votes to the final
count of the vote cast. This prelimi
nary work means considerable expense.
Besides there is literature to be written,
printing to be done, halls to be hired
for public meetings, and all the other
incidental matters pertaining to a hot
ly contested campaign.
In order to raise funds to meet these
expenses a canvassing finance commit
tee was appointed to-night, and' the
gentlemen appointed will begin work
to-morrow. Every citizen interested
in the cause of good government will
be given the privilege of contributing,
and it is anticipated that no difficulty
will be experienced in collecting a gen
erous fund. It is believed that no resi
dent, even If not a considerable tax
payer, will refuse to contribute his mite
to a fund which is to be used for the
trrand and nobie purpose of ransoming
one of the fairest cities of California
from the bondage of a ring of corrup
tlonists and boodlers.
Registration is going on at a rapid
rate. It is estimated that about 1500
changes will have to be made in the
register. At the proper time the New
Charter Club will have experts g\
the register and see that only those
qualified to vote are allowed to remain
thereon. On the day of election they
will have watchers at every polling
place. Any one detected in "an iiieg-al
act in connection with the election
will be vigorously prosecuted, and it
is probable that rewards win be of
fered for the arrest and conviction of
offenders-
Ten of the New Charter Club nomi

Three independent candidates for mem
bers of the Appointing Board filed pe

NAPA, March B.â The trial of Georga
W. Clark, the confessed murderer tit
his brother, William Clark, at St. He
lena in January iast, was begun to-day
before Judge Ham. A special panel
of 120 jurors was present when the
court opened. All but five of them an
swered to their names when the roll
was called. The five absent sent In ex
cuses, pleading sickness. About a doz
en others were excused from Jury duty
on statutory gTounds, and then the
work of selecting twelve impartial and
opinionless men from the remaining
Jurors to* decide the guilt of the ac
cused man commenced.
The defendant â was represented by
Attorneys Henry Hogan, C. J. Becr
stecher and EL L. Webber. Theodore
A. Bell, the District Attorney, ap
peared for the prosecution, and he was
wiliing to accept almost any one of
the panel as jurymen, but the defense
was more particular. They challenged
all who had read any of the newspaper
reports of the homicide and formed an
opinion on what they had read. Dur
ing the day one man was found who
had not read any of the reports of the
murder. He had been working in the
foothills where papers never reached,
and he had no companions to discuss
the crime with even if he had known
it was committed. He, however, was
excused on a peremptory challenge
by the prosecution for the reason that
a person who cared so little for what
was going on about him would not be
a proper perscm to be intrusted with
the life of a fellow-being.
Clark, the accused murderer, r.

his demeanor, but during the day when

ON THE CORONA
To Captain C. M. Goodall
and C. C. Lacey the
Credit Is Due.
The Blairrnore Litigation Has
Ended in Favor of the
Underwriters.
An Eloping Wife From Petaluma
Caught at the FerriÂ«6 by Her
Husband.
Captain C. Miner Goodall and Charles
C. Lacey, chief engineer of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's Umatilla,
have done some very clever work in
getting the wrecked steamer Corona off
the rocks at I,ewis Island. The vessel
went ashore while on her way to Dyea
and Skaguay, and Captain Goodall and
Mr. Lacey wore at once sent north to
see what could be done toward savin?
the vessel. How they have succeeded
is told in the following dispatch re
ceived by Goodall, Perkins & Co. yes
terday: "'Latest arrivals say the Co
rona has been moved to a safe place.
Expect she will be repaired and come
to Victoria, B. C, in a few days."
Captain C. M. Goodall has had an
incentive to do his best. He is to be
married on the 26th inst., and it was
the fear of having to postpone the cer
emony that haÂ« made him so eager to
get the Corona to San Francisco. He
got the vessel off the rocks once, but
found that she was leaking from dam
age she received under the engines,
which could not be reached by the div
ers. t?he was placed on a flat rock
near the one from which she had been
â¢taken, and after the hole had been
patched up she was beached and got
ready for the trip to San Francisco
via Victoria, B. C.
Yachtsmen are making great prepar
ations for the 20th inst. On that date
the draw bridge at Tiburon will be
opened and the following fleet of
yachts will come out of winter quar
ters: Clara, Seven Bells, Queen, Speed
well, Aeolus, Thelma, Freda, Mignon,
Cisne, Juanita, Will o' the Wisp, Magic
Eli, Flirt, Freddie, Florence, Pride, Se
cret, Guinevere, Bonita, Scout, Cornelia
and Nereid.
The owners of the boats and their
friends have been hard at work on
them tor a week past, and canvas has
bt-en overhauled, spars scraped and
oiled and cabins repninted and uphol
stered, so the fleet will come out of re
tirement in spick and span order. The
Florence and Secret had th%ir masts
ukLi; out last Sunday, while the Juan
ita haa had her decks canvased. The
Florence Is to have new cabins, masts
and sails, and, in fact, all- the yachts
ure to be thoroughly equipped for the
>n. It therefore looks as though
next season was to be a most success
ful one in yachting circles.
A very handsome steamer is being
built at Alanieda. Point for Captain
â¢.'harles Nelson. She is 210 feet over
all. 28 feet broad and 14 feet deep. She
is to be fitted with two Babcock boil
ers which are coming from the East,
and her machinery is being built by
the Fulto: Iron Works. Her speed is
expo. â¢ . â¢ abuut twelve knots an
hour. The new steamer is to be called
the Charles Nelson, after her owner,
and she will have accommodation for
150 passengers. Captain Nelson does.
not know whether or not he will put
he in the Klondike trade.
J, uite a number of people must intend
iking their home on the water next
summer. At the present time five arks
are beir.g built at Tiburon, two more
are nearly completed at the foot of
Berry street and three more are being
built at H'>uth San Francisco. This will
i^ake a ileet of about twenty-five arks
that will be in the Sausalito, Tiburon
and San Rafael waters in another
month or so.
The agents of the steamer lines who
have vessels on the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers are apprehensive
over the rainfall. Neither river has ever
been so low at this time of the year as
it is now, and unless there are some
good heavy rains this month it is not
at all beyond the range of probability
that steamers will be unable to reach
Stockton and Sacramento.
E. K. White, agent of the Sacramento
Transportation Company's steamers,
pays that last month the boats found
navigation difficult, and that it was '
getting worse every day. If that is the
case now, what will it be during the
summer months?
Mrs. Jennie Parrish of Petaluma and
â  a young horse-dealer of Santa Rosa
named Spears eloped from Petaluma
last Monday, and. coming to San Fran-
Cisco, put up at the Golden West Hotel, i
James Parrish, the husband, followed
his wife to this city and caught her and '
her paramour at the ferries, where she â 
was getting her trunk out of the bag
gage-room. He reasoned with the run
away couple and told his wife that he
had Joined the Salvation Army and
taken the pledge never to drink, smoke
or swear again. She finally agreed to !
go back to Petaluma with him, and
Spears was left on the wharf dlsconso- !
â  late. Parrish buys old horses and j
'slaughters them at Petaluma, where he
sells them to the farmers for chicken
feed. He has not hitherto treated his i
wife well, but he proposes to do better !
in the future. They are going to break
up their home in Petaluma and move '
to Stockton.
Tho British ship Blairrnore arrived
here on February 2, 1896, and early in
March she capsized in Mission Bay and
several of her crew were drowned, i
Captain Burns was sent out from Eng
land by the Underwriters' Association, â¢
and, after weeks of hard work, she was
finally raised on July 18, 1896. Then the
litigation began. The owners of the
vessel would not accept her. and the
insurance companies insisted that they j
were only liable for one-third of the ,
cost of the repairs. From court to court j
ise was taken, first one side gain- ,
li g an advantage and then the other, |
until finally it reached the House of i
Lords. That is the court of last appeal ;
In England, and it has decided against j
the owners of the vessel.
The repairs to the Blairmore would
have cost in the neighborhood of $20,- |
and over $200,000 has been spent in
!:tigation. Now that the matter has
settled and the insurance com- j
j-anies have only to pay one-third of
epalrs, the wonder is what will be \
done with the vessel. Captain Caw, her
if. aster, is still here, and the vessel lies
Oakland Creek. For the last eighteen â¢
i:onths a watchman has been the only i
I rscn living on hor, but now she will [
hly come out of her long retire
n -t. Her owners may repair her and
load her with wheat, or she may be
sold to the highest bidder. In which
jvent she would probably be put under
"he American flag.
Partners Disagree.
Joseph Glukfeld filed a petition In court
yesterday charging his partner, N. C
Krinsky. with entering Into a conspiracy
to defraud him. Glukfeld asks for the

HOW AND WHERE THE COLLISION OCCURRED.
PROVIDENCE
INTERVENED
; Travelers Escape in a.
Head-End Col
lision.
Passenger and Freight Trains
Tried to Pass on One
Track.
Engineers Quickly Reversed the
Levers and Jumped for
Their Lives.
Yesterday morning at about 7:30
o'clock the local San Jose train leaving
this city at 6:55 collided with a heavily
loaded freight train composed of forty
five cars carrying cattle from Los
Gatos, at the side track known as the
; Spring Valley crossing, or, as others
i state, the Union Coursing Park switch.
It is probably due to Providence that
j the passengers were not all severely in
. jured and a portion of them killed out
| right, as the passenger train was run
ning at a fairly good rate of speed. The
1 trouble seems to have occurred from a
I misunderstanding. The freight was
i late and had switched on the side track
at the point of collision. After a few
minutes' wait the engineer started the
, train at the orders of the conductor for
the siding at Ocean View, but as the
I two engines which were attached to
i the freight train passed on to the main
1 track the passenger flier was seen com
' ing but a short distance away. The
'â  brakes were reversed, but without
avail, as the two trains bumped into
1 one another with terrific force, throw
ing the passengers to their feet and
bruising the cattle which had been
penned in vie box cars of the freight
train.
The collision occurred just as the en
gineer of the freight was of the opinion
that all was clear for a run to the
Ocean View switch.
The engineer on the head engine of
the train pulling freight, as well as the
1 engineer and fireman of the passenger
; train, jumped after the lever of the en
gine had been reversed in an attempt
to reduce the force of the collision,
which was seen by all parties to be in
evitable. Conductor Emmicht of the
passenger train was thrown half-way
across the car in which he was stand
â¢ ing, and sustained a sprained wrist and
a bruised leg. No other train hands or
i passengers were injured to any extent,
although several of them fell from their
seats as the collision occurred. After
the wreck it was discovered that the
engines had been badly shaken up. The
front engines on both trains were dam
aged to a considerable extent in the
front portions and in the middle of the
cars on the freight train it was seen
that a flatcar had been twisted into
two pieces. It was thought remarkable
that most of the train had not been
damaged to a greater extent, but it was
due to the position in which the trains
were lying. The rails where the acci
dent occurred were not even twisted,
and within two hours after the wreck
the other trains were allowed to pass
to their destinations on the same rails.
The passengers from Monterey who
were on the way to the city were taken
aboard the San Mateo electric cars and
conveyed to this city, where they ex
pressed their satisfaction at not hav
ing been mingled in the wreck, which
might have resulted with a great loss
of life and property.
Other accidents have taken place at
the same point, and it is a wonder to
railroad men that more fatal accidents
have not happened. The opinion was
expressed by many yesterday that at
some future time a collision would be
witnessed at that point which would
result in a great loss of life. The
switches are badly situated, and or
ders are rarely given to the railroad
hands at that point. However, another
miracle in the way of railroad wrecks
has come and gone, and neither pas
sengers nor owners have suffered to
any great extent.
THE REGISTRARSHIP FIGHT.
Many Democrats Willing to Serve
Their Party and Take Office.
Registrar Hinton, who was appointed
Railroad Commissioner to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Dr. James I.
Stanton, has received his commission. He
is now anxiously waiting to mcc". his suc
cessor and surrender the Registrar's of
fice to him.
The delay of Governor Budd in naming
the new Registrar is causing many Demo
cratic politicians nights of unrest and
days of uneasiness. There are two score
or more aspirants in the field and the
friends of each one of them be.lleves the
man of his choice will bo the "winner in
the contest for political favor.
Pension Agent I. P. Walsh, who has
twice before occupied the Important office
of Registrar, is now, in the views of his
friends, the strongest man suggested for
the place. James H. O'Brien, the con
tractor, has a host of frfends working for
him and in addition he enjoys the friend
ship of Lientenant-Governor Jeter.
Harry Mulcrtavy, chief deputy under
Registrar Hinton, would not refuse the
place and P. W. MoGlade, who Is at
present in the Street Superintendent's of
fice, would consent to serve it asked by
the Governor.
To mention the names of all of those
who are either aspiring or are being "put
to the front" by their friends would look
like a directory of Democrats.
It Is believed, however, that the Gov

ernor will end the suspense within the
next forty-eight hours by naming the new
Registrar.

LITTLE ONES FEAST.
The Children of the Silver Star Kin
dergarten Royally Entertained.
A most pitiable sight greeted the vis
itor to the Siiver Star Kindergarten, 806
Sansome street, yesterday, while the 125
children of that institution were partici
pating in a feast at the expense of Miss
E. M. Stevens, an English ladf who has
been visiting this city some two years,
but who is now in Portland.
On the lady's first trip to this city she
became interested in this kindergarten,
and on the anniversary of her birthday
she presented the principal with J>7s to
give the little ones a luncheon. The
money more than paid tor the repast, and
the thoughtful principal. Miss Wain
wright, bought a pair of shoes for each
child. This year the gift of Miss Stevens
was repeated, but Colonel H. M. Hecht,
the honorary president of the Society,
presented the kindergarten with thirty
pair of shoes and suggested that the ex
tra money be made use of by buying
aprons for the girls and waists for the
boys.
The good things were not long upon the 1
tables, as each little child ate as though
it were his or her duty to devour as much
as they possibly could. There were sand
wiches with lots of jelly, cookies, or
anges, apples, a nice cup of milk and
many other delicacies, such as the chil
dren had hardly ever seen before, much
less tasted. In the middle of their en
joyment the children showed that they
were getting something out of the
ordinary by carefully wrapping up
in their napkins a cookie, apple or
sandwich that had been given them, and
wh.n asked the reason they answered
that their mamma would like it or their
baby sister had never had any. They
were always promptly given double their
share. The children, each of whom wore
a paper cap on its head representing a
chrysanthemum, sang several songs,
among them being the favorite soup of
their benefactor, entitled " Our Father.
DIBECTORS" ANNUAL MEETING.
The State Board of Trade Favors a
California Exhibition of Its
Products at Paris.
The annual meeting of the Cillfnrnla
State Board of Trade was held at Me
chanics' Pavilion yesterday afternoon,
i with General N. P. Chipman In the chair.
Those present were W. H. Mills, John
\P. Irish, J. A. Filcher, J. S. Emery,
' Cralgie Sharp, IL A. Messenger, Mrs.
â  Elizabeth Shields, B. N. Rowley, F. H.
Buck, E. W. Maslin, J. W. Davis.
Secretary Filcher stated that he was In
; possession of a communication which set
forth that Secretary Wilson of the Cabl
j net would visit California during the
' coming summer. It was also mentioned in
| the letter that President McKinley was
'' considering a vacation trip to California
,' in July or August. It was decided to
i make 'the entertainment of Secretary
1 | Wilson a special order for the next meet
' ing, at which time committees will be ap
â¢ pointed.
The matter of arranging a California
exhibit at the international exhibition at
[ Omaha this summer was brought up in
the shape of a report from A. A. Wat
kins, chairman of the commitee having
that subject in charge. Mr. Watkins
stated that there was no enthusiasm In
the matter shown, and that it was prac
i tically impossible to raise the $15,000 nec
essary for the purpose. Ip view of the
difficulties that H**-e presented them
selves Mr. Watkins recommended that
the project be abandoned. The report was
adopted.
"VV. H. Mills and Colonel John P. Irish
exchanged ideas on the acceptance of the
Alaska Trade Committee, which body
turned over Its affairs to the Hoard of
Trad^ with a cash balance of $500. Mr.
Mills spoke of the efforts made by the
Southern Pacific to equalize rates to
Alaska. The company was doing all U
could In the premises, but at a loss, ow
ing to the existing differential rates. He
suggested that the board might charter
trains from the East, and thus turn the
tide this way. He believed the local mer
chants would contribute to the expense of
this enterprise. After some further re
marks, Mr. Mills moved that the matter
be taken up at the special meeting to
morrow, which was adopted.
President Chinman submitted his an
nual report, in which he said that the
past year had been a prosperous one for
the fruit grower. The shipments to East
ern and European markets were very
large, the total carloads being 48,071. Of
that number 36,440 were of fruit, 6897 of
wines and grapes, and 4734 of vegetables.
Of prunes 8.3,902,tÂ£0 pounds were shipped,
and of limes and lemons 1728 carloads
were sent to the East. After giving much
data concerning horticulture in California
he said that the prospects of fruit grow
ers throughout the State were excellent.
Owing to the increased demand from
Alaska the fruit canning industry Is now
very active.
Regarding the work done by the State
Board of Trade, General Chlpman said
that Its work had been highly advan
tageous to the Interests of California
fruit growers.
The Paris Exposition and the advan
tages of having California fully repre
sented was then opened for general dis
cussion.
Several gentlemen representing the in
terests of the State were called upon for
their views on this question, and all were
unanimous in the opinion that California
should put forth its best efforts to make
a creditable display of her products.
Colonel John P. Irish offered the follow
ing resolution, which was adopted:
"Resolved, That the State Board of
Trade strongly favors and advises a com
prehensive exhibit of the products and
resources of the State at Paris in 1900,
and will promote and direct the same to
the extent of its ability.
"Resolved, That this board will re
quest of the next Legislature an appro
priation of $50,000, for purposes of such
exhibit at Paris."
Secretary Filcher presented his financial
report, which showed that out of the re
ceipts of $12,210 41 there remained in the
treasurer's hands a balance of $1311 81;
with assets, $1220. This showing was con
sidered to be creditable to the secretary's
good management of the board's affairs.
The following board of directors and of
ficers were elected for the ensuing year:
Directorsâ General N. P. Chipman, J. S.
Emery, W. H. Mills, George C. Perkins,
B. N. Rowley, Mark 1,. McDonald, C. F.
Montgomery, J. P. Irish. E. \V. Maslin,
C. M. Wooster, Mrs. E. Shields.
Officersâ General N. P. Chipman, presi
i dent: J. 8. Emery first vice-president; C.
i F. Montgomery, second vice-president; J.
i A. Filcher. secretary and general man
ager; Crocker- Woolworth National Bank,

RAGAN ARMS
FOR BATTLE
The School Director Pre
paring to Strike Back
at Stanton.
Threatens to Have His Accuser
Arrested for Attempted
Extortion.
A Letter and Telegram Which, He
Says, Will Fully Substantiate
the Charge of Blackmail.
School Director Ragan is on the war
path, and declares that before he
smokes the pipe of peace ex-Teacher
Stanton's scalp will be dangling from
his lodge pole.
The affidavit of the former teacher of
mathematics in the Commercial Night
School, as outlined in yesterday's Call,
in which he accuses the School Direc
tor of having Bold him the position for
$300, which he did not pay, and then,
â¢when the Grand Jury began its in
vestigation Into the affairs of the de
partment, offered Stanton $300 to go to
Australia, giving him $60 in gold and
promising to send the balance to Van
couver, is the cause of the uprising, and
Dr. Ragan will attempt to have Stan
ton punished for attempted extortion.
With this object in view Ragan sum
moned his attorney, J. J. Dwyer, yes
terday, with whom he discussed the
matter, and as a result Dwyer secured
the services of two other lawyers,
whose names Ragan declines to make
public last night, to assist him in the
case. The three lawyers will confer
with Dr. Ragan to-day as to what line
of action to pursue, and it is proba
ble that before night a warrant for
Stanton's arrest will be sworn to.
Dr. Ragan, in an interview last even
ing, said he had a letter from Stan
ton, bearing no address, in which the
writer demanded $240 and threatened
the director with all sorts of calamities
if the money was not forthcoming. This
letter was presented to Ragan by Stan
ton's nephew, who was to receive the
money. Ragan asked his caller to
return later in the day. and when he
did so Ragan had a friend secreted in
the room who overheard the conversa
tion that passed between Ragan and
his visitor. Moreover, Dr. Ragan says
that last Tuesday he received a tele
gram from Stanton, dated Vancouver,
which read: "240 or San Quentin."
Dr. Ragan is at a loss to account for
Stanton fixing upon $240 as the amount
of his demand, but scouts Stanton's
explanation, which, he says, is devoid
of a particle of truth.
C. W. Welch, secretary of the Board
of Education, is indignant at the use
Stanton has made of his name, and ve
hemently denies the charge that he
acted as the go-between between Stan
ton and Ragan. Mr. Welch says he
first met Stanton In a business way
in 1895, when Stanton was teaching
school In Vacaville. He did not see
him again until he came to this city
seeking a position. Stanton asked
Welch for a letter of introduction to
Ragan and Welch wrote a few words
on a card. Afterward Stanton told him
he had used Welch's name with all the
Directors, to which Welch made no ob
jection. One day Dr. Ragan told
Welch that he had appointed Stanton
as a substitute teacher. That .was the
only time they had talked about him.
Both Ragan and Welch state that
Stanton has an unenviable record
in Vallejo, where, they say, he was
strongly suspected of having set fire to
a store he owned in order to obtain the
insurance money.
E. C. Kilpatrick, the principal of the
Commercial Night School, who is now
under suspension on charges, which
Stanton's affidavit is intended, to clear
him of, is reluctant to discuss the mat
ter. He said, however, that one night
Stanton went to his residence and told
him he had been forced by Ragan and
the others to make the first affidavit
attacking Kilpatrick, but that he had
come back to right the wrong he had
done. He then gave Mr. Kilpatrick a
written statement which Kilpatrick
took to a notary and Stanton acknowl
edged it. This Is the affidavit that has
been brought against Dr. Ragan.
Wants His Marriage Annulled.
Malkom Nordstrom has applied to the
courts to annul his marriage to Annie
Nordstrom. The plaintiff alleges that he
married his wife in New York during the
month of November, 1895, while laboring
under a misapprehension. He also claims
that he was threatened by his wife,
which caused him to marry her. He has
since found, he alleges, that his wife"s
statements were false, and he now asks
for an annulment of the marriage con
tract.
San Francisco Elks.
San Francisco Lodge. P. B. O. E., has
decided to postpone the ladles' night
which had been announced for next Fri
day on account of the Lenten season. It
will be given in the latter part of April.
The lodge Is also making arrangements to
have produced under its auspices an
opera which has never yet been put on a
lyric stage.
Two Years for Burglary.
Louis Schwartz was sentenced to two
years In San Quentin by Judge Dunne
yesterday morning on a charge of burg
lary in the second degree. On June 2
last the prisoner broke into a house at 2128
California street, and rather than face
trial for the offense he pleaded guilty,
and in consequence escaped with a light
sentence.
DRUGGED IN
SLEEP BY
FRIEND
A Miner Is Chloro
formed While He
Slumbers.
His Bedfellow Relieved
Him of All the Money
He Had.
Albert Freeman Misplaced His
Confidence in Daniel
O'Brien.
SUPPORTED HIM MONTHS.
The Police of the California Station
Quickly Capture the Clever
Robber.
By misplacing: his trust in a man
whom he supposed to be a friend Al
bert Freeman is out $150, but a por
tion of the amount will be recovered,
as Daniel O'Brien, the supposed friend,
has been captured by Officer McGray
an of the California-street Police Sta
tion.
Last Saturday morning Freeman and
O'Brien came down from Stockton and
registered at the Golden Eagle Hotel,
on the corner of Broadway and Mont
gomery avenue. In the evening the
two men went to bed together, but
when Freeman awoke the next morn
ing his friend was gone, and with him
$150, which had been sewed up in Free
man's undershirt. The smell of
chloroform was noticeable In the room,
and, as the robbed man felt dazed, he
came to the conclusion that O'Brien
had drugged him while he slept.
The police were immediately notified
of the robbery and officers were de
tailed to find O'Brien. Yesterday aft
ernoon McGrayan found the man In
a saloon at 635 Clay street, arrested
him and placed him in the tanks of
the City Prison without filing any
charge against him. About $40 in pa
per money was found in his possession
and a money order for $50, which
O'Brien had purchased at Station D
Postoffice to send to his son John, who
lives at Hannibal, Mo. A battle of
chloroform In O'Brien's pocket proved
to the officer that Freeman's story of
having been chloroformed had some
foundation.
The tale of the friendship between
the two men is an interesting one, and,
while it shows up O'Brien's lack of
gratitude in brilliant colors, it also
proves that he is fully capable of liv
ing on hia wits. Freeman, who is a
mining man and rancher of Riverside,
met O'Brien at that place three months
ago, and the two struck up a friend
ship. O'Brien confided to his friend
that he o-wned a fabulously rich mine
in Washington, which he lacked money
to work, and asked Freeman to go in
with him to develop it. As proof of
his proprietorship he produced a legal
looking document purporting to be a
deed to the mine, and Freeman agreed
to go into the deal. Freeman did not
have the money at the time, but be
gan to beat about among his friends
to raise the required amount. He

them received $100. while $50 mare was
secured from friends in Redfields.
During the three months it took to
get the money for the venture O'Brien
was fed, clothed and lodged by Free
man, and the two were bosom friends.
Freeman now holds the deed to the
Washington mine, but it is not likely
that he will continue his trip north
to Investigate the value of the prop
erty. The Police Department tele
graphed to "Washington to see !f any
such mine existed, and received the
reply that Mr. O'Brien owned no prop
erty there.
When O'Brien was arrested he was
slightly under the influence of liquor,
but refused to talk of the matter at all.
He was seen in a saloon on Kearny
street about 7 o'clock Sunday morning,
and at that time displayed a large roll
of greenbacks. Officer Bell was ap
proached by the man the same day,
and O'Brien started a conversation,
telling him all about the mine. The
policeman became much interested,
and had serious intentions of throwing
up his position and entering into a
partnership, which O'Brien promised
would net the two $20,000 a year. The
case against O'Brien is a clear one,
and it is prc-bable he won't be able to
work his mine or friends for some
years.
SHIPS WE FIGHT WITH.
Interesting Lecture on War Vessels
by Irving M. Scott.
"Ships We Fight With" was the subject J
of a most interesting illustrated lecture i
delivered by Irving M. Scott last even- j
ing in the First United Presbyterian
Church. The lecture was for the benefit !
of the church fund and was the first of \
a series of four, the three remaining ones â¢
of which will follow at Intervals of a I
week.
Mr. Scott spoke of warships generally
at first, but the principal part of his ad
dress was devoted to those ships which
have been built on this Coast. He started
with the Charleston, the pioneer of them
all. and then he described in order the
San Farncisco. the Monterey, the Olym
pia, the Oregon, the Marietta, the Wheel
ing, then the Japanese cruiser Chitose,
just launched, and the United States bat
tleship Wisconsin, now being built. He
also showed some of the merchant ships
which had been built here. Mr. Scott de
scribed the construction of the ships, the
difficulties that have to be overcome in
some of the large castings necessary and
the appliances which must be used.
He spoke, too, on the necessity of a
navy, and showed how the United States
had grown and what amount of territory
she had to protect. To point his remarks
he showed a picture of the vessels of the
English navy grouped together and then
one of the American ships.
Toward the close of his remarks he
showed a picture of the ill-fated Maine
as she was just before she left the harbor
of New York to seek her death in the
waters of Havana. He described the lo
cation of her magazines and explained
tho various theories of her destruction.
His closing sentences were drowned in the
applause which greeted a beautiful alle
gorical picture of the flag, waved by Lib
erty with the dome of the Capitol in the
distance, which ended the pictorial por
tion of the entertainment.
For Country Trade.
The Manufacturers' and Wholesalers'
League, which is a branch of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association, Is
branching out In earnest again for the
summer trade. The purpose of the league
is to induce the merchants in the country
to come to this city and make their pur
chases instead of buying from Eastern
firms, whose only interest on this coast is
represented by drummers who go skating
along their routes from one town to an
other. To accomplish this the league fur
nishes to the country merchants free
transportation to and from the city, that
is those merchants who live any consid
erable distance away.
This does not mean that merchants in
the country may ride perpetually be
tween their homes and the city free and
at their own sweet will, for the time is
limited to that period when they usually
maJie their purchases for the season's
trade. This time the period of free pas
sage is from March 16 to April 18 on the
railroads and to May 16 to those who are
obliged to travel by the steamers. Last
year the invitations were sent out by the
local merchants to their mercantile
friends, but this year the invitations are
being sent from the rooms of the league
direct. Country liquor dealers are not in
cluded among those who receive these in
vitations.
On Constitutional Law.
Andy Sparks, a boiler maker, who was
convicted on a charge of petty larceny,
was locked up in the ctty prison last
evening by Deputy Sheriff Hinters of
Sacramento. The prisoner is here for the
purpose of testing the constitutionality of
the Police Courts in Sacramento in the
State Supreme Court. The prisoner's
lawyers will arrive in a day or two. when
the case will be tested. It is thought the
Sacramento Police Courts will come in
for a criticism not altogether compli
mentary.
WESLEY LEWIS ON TRIAL.
Considerable Evidence Admitted
Tending to Prove That He As
saulted Miss Ready.
The second trial of Wesley T. Lewis,
who Is charged with having criminally
assaulted Florence Ready, an attendant
upon the Lincoln Grammar School. 18
years of age. on the night of May 25.
1896, wan commenced before Judge Dunne
and a jury yesterday morning. After the
jury had been impaneled the prosecution,
which is being conducted by Assistant
District Attorney Black, put on many
witnesses and what seems to be a com
plete chain of evidence against the ac
cused was the result. S. A. Perry. P. D.
Dunn, Samuel Harris. T. C. van Bibber,
J. H. Hubachek. J. T. Brophy, B. Kick
erson. F. MoMullen. James F. Swift, S.
P. Robbins. James Rossiter. Sarah A.
Ready, mother of the assaulted girl: Jef
frey Powers, Alice G. Brant. Albert Hen
nesey and R. I. Cunningham were on the
stand during the day and all gave evi
dence tending to prove that the charge
aprainst Lewis was not falsely made.
Many more witnesses for the prosecution
will bo put on the stand and then the
defense will have an inning. . From cer-Â»
tain hints dropped by Attorney J. N\ B.
Wilson* who represents the accused, it is
surmised that an attempt will be mada
to prove that Miss Ready was in the,
habit of returning to her home at un-Â«
usual hours and that she was frequently
admonished for her actions. Mrs. Ready
denied on the stand yesterday that such
was the case and said that her daughter
had been very regular in returning from
school and that she was always accom
panied by her school mates. The trial
may occupy a full week and during that
period many sensational developments are;
expected.
W. H. Mammon and the Weather.
W. H. Hammon, the local forecast of
ficial and weather prophet, delivered a
lecture at the Mechanics' Institute last
evening before .he San Francisco Farm
ers' Club on the subject of "What the
Weather Bureau is Trying to Do for the
Farmers." The lecture consisted mainly
of a history of the institution since its
birth, why it was originally called Into
existence and the present and various
purposes to which it is now devoted. An
additional development of the present
scope of the bureau is the ascertaining of
the various atmospheric conditions at an
unusual altitude. Congress lately made
an appropriation for the purpose of carry-
Ing on and furthering this investigation
and experiments, and the money granted
has been devoted to the erection of sta
tions on mountains and high elevations
throughout ixie country. The first station
of this character on this coast was re
cently erected on the summit of Mount
Tamalpais.
Crushed While at Work.
George Miller, a fireman living at 1250
Filbert street and employed at Wieland's
brewery, received contusions of the chest
and back and possibly internal injuries
last evening. While placing a stop block
under the wheels of a coal cart which
wa*i backing to the coal bin he was
caught and crushed between the bin and
cart. The extent of his injuries cannot be
determined for a day or two, but it is ex
pected the injured man will recover.
Explosives His Subject.
The Y. M. I. Lecture Bureau has ar-
ranged another of its popular lectures,
which will be given on Tuesday evening
next in St Ignatius Hall, Van Ness
avenue. Rev. Henry Wooods, S. J., will
sp^ak on "Explosives. Physically and
Chemically Considered." As the lecture
will be under the auspices of Columbus
Council No. E5, Y. M. 1., it is expected
that a large crowd will attend.
Musicians Arrive.
Henri Marteau. the French violinist,
and Alme Lachaume, the pianist, arrived
from Chicago last evening. Marteau is
considered throughout the East as the
greatest artist visiting this country since
Wlenlawski. Lachaume will be remem
bered as the accompanist of Tsaye and
Rivarde. the violin virtuosos who both
made successses here.
In the Divorce Courts.
Mrs. Ella Peart was granted a divorce
from her husband, Louis H. Peart, yes
terday on the ground of willful neglect.
Bertha Zeust was granted a divorce from
Charles Zeust on statutory grounds.
Minnie E. Goodrich was granted a divorca
from Albert Goodrich on the ground that
her husband was convicted of a felony.

SON FRANCISCO (WO THE EXPOSITION
\\ AYOR PHELAN should act as promptly as
/ \ is consistent with a careful selection in ap
' * pointing a committee to represent San Fran
cisco in the projected enterprise of holding a grand
interstate exposition oi the resources of the West in
celebration of the admission of California to state
hood in the Union. The movement is well advanced
and the importance of the work is one that does not
admit of delay.
The situation of affairs is this: Governor Budd has
invited the Governors of States and Territories com
prised in the region known as the Great West to ap
point delegates to attend an interstate convention
to discuss the proposed exposition and to determine
where and when it shall be held and to. arrange for
undertaking it. When this convention meets there
will be other cities as well as San Francisco to apply
for the honor of holding the exposition, and it is
theiefore imperative that we should be prepared to
urge our claims with success, or at least with zeal and
reason, when the question of location comes before
the convention for settlement.
Under any circumstances, whether we are to have
a strong rivalry in the contest for the exposition or
not, it is important that we should have a committee
prepared to go before the interstate convention with
a definite programme of what this city will undertake
to do for the enterprise. California will be looked to
for leadership in the movement throughout the West,
and San Francisco will be looked to for leadership
throughout California. The lead cannot be held,
however, without doing something to deserve it. If
San Francisco is not prepared to make a good show
ing when the convention meets Los Angeles or some
other enterprising city of the Great West may carry
off the honors, and the profit of holding the first
Great Western exposition will be lost to us by our
own negligence.
The Mayor should act at once in appointing the
rommittee and thus give the committee time to ac
complish something before the convention meets.
THE CRIME AGfIINST OfIKLfIND.
SULLENLY and stolidly, but with as much
shameless effrontery as ever, the Solid Six of
the Oakland Council have carried out their
scheme of spoliation against the people in the inter
ests of the water companies. They have enacted their
ordinance fixing the water rate, and the only recourse
left to the citizens is to test the validity of the act
by an appeal to the courts as soon as an attempt is
made to collect water charges under it.
The people of Oakland should lay the lesson of this
experience to their hearts and resolve to profit by it.
Even if the courts grant relief the victory will have
been won in a tedious and costly way. Moreover, if
the exorbitant rates now allowed the companies be
set aside, the chances are the same influences which
procured the enactment of such rates may with more
cunning bring about a new ordinance on the subject
which will virtually give the companies all they de
sire and yet be so drawn and enacted as to stand all
legal tests and be upheld by the Judges.
The one lesson to be profitably drawn from the ex
perience with this job is the importance to a com
munity to elect to office men who can be relied upon
to keep their pledges, be faithful to their trusts and
guard the interests of the community against the re
petition of such jobs as this which has just been per
petrated.
If Oakland can keep the memory of the outrageous
scenes in her Council chamber during the last few
weeks fresh in mind until the next election comes
and act in accordance with the lessons they teach her
citizens will have no occasion to regret the perpetra
tion of the job even if the courts uphold it. It is
worth paying a high price for water if the water can
be made to have an effect in purifying politics.
Policeman Callinan needs to dance on the carpet
before the Commissioners. He arrested a sane man,
charging him with insanity, and seems to have had
absolutely no excuse. A citizen is not necessarily
crazy because he does not like a policeman who has
rendered himself obnoxious.
Several people have died on the desert lately from
the effects of wood alcohol. There is no occasion for
a man who is going into the desert to provide him
self with this poison. His chances of dying are pretty
good without it.
Of course there is no possible action for the Police
Commissioners to-dny but to dismiss Sergeant Davis
from the force which he disgraces. The man has had
an opportunity to defend himself and had no defense
to make.
New Yorkers think they have seen a sign of war in
the sky. They describe it as a tongue of flame. Prob
ably the correspondents expelled from Cuba have
reached home and arc breathing fire.
When next Sobral shall visit this country the au
thorities may have the felicity of hanging him as a
spy.
A PEOCE MEASURE.
f~* CONGRESSMAN CANNON was right when in
( introducing his bill appropriating $50,000,000
for national defense he declared, "It is not a
war measure. I say in my judgment it is a peace
measure. The Government of the United States would
not, if it could, trench upon the rights of any nation
upon earth." In that statement the crisis is exactly
described. The United States designs no aggression
against Spain, and the sum voted by Congress in the
bill reported by Mr. Cannon means peace, for it
gives warning to Spain that if war comes by her
provocation we shall be ready for it.
That Congress has not taken this action without
due cause is apparent to the whole world. We have
borne with Spain a long time. We have given her
ample opportunity to close the war in Cuba with jus
tice to the Cubans and honor to herself. We have
tolerated actions on the part of her officials which
have reduced American citizens resident in Cuba to
such a condition of destitution that relief has had to
be provided for them as objects of charity. We have
seen the Maine destroyed and a crew of American
seamen blown to death under circumstances which
justify a belief that Spanish treachery caused the dis
aster, and still we have stayed our hands.
Spain has not met this moderation on our part
with a proper spirit of friendliness. She has shown
no appreciation of our forbearance. At a time when
we are straining a point to preserve peace with her
she sends us a notice of objection to our Consul-Gen
eral in the islands and a request that our relief sup
plies for Americans in Cuba should not be sent in
any vessel belonging to the navy. This objection and
this request tend to increase the difficulty of the crisis.
They raise new points of international antagonism
and can hardly be regarded as anything else than in
tentional expressions of ill-will and hostility.
It is true that the firm attitude of President Mc-
Kinley in refusing to grant either request made by
the Spanish Government has been followed by a
prompt submission on the part of Spain. The with
drawal of the demands does not, however, weaken in
any way the effect produced by making them. They
disclosed on the part of the Spaniards a feeling of
animosity toward the United States, and the with
drawal does not imply that the animosity has abated.
It is high time for the republic to be on guard.
That the bill was passed by the House promptly
and without a division was no more than what was to
have been expected. There are no divisions among
the American people on issues involving national
honor and national defense. As a matter of fact a bill
appropriatingsioo,ooo.ooo would have as readily passed
the House and would have been received with an
even warmer approval by the country. The old sen
timent expressed by the phrase, "Millions for de
fense, but not one cent for tribute" still lives among
the people. Whatever sum may be necessary at this or
any other time to provide for defense in a just cause
will be forthcoming as swiftly as the emergency calls
for it.
Moreover, the vote was not in any way a bluff. As
Mr. Cannon explained, we have the money in the
treasury to meet the appropriation if it is expended.
We do not have to borrow nor to increase taxation
to provide $50,000,000 'or national defense. If bank
rupt Spain has any judgment left in her councils she
will take notice of that fact and not throw herself
into a conflict that will end only in her defeat and
loss.
THE RECIPROCITY TREATY.
THE failure of annexation brings to the front an
equable adjustment of our commercial relations
with Hawaii. No one questions the wisdom of
reciprocity arrangements, when the results are re
ciprocal and complementary.
If we receive eight millions a year trade from
Hawaii and that country take only four millions of
trade from us, the commerce is not complementary.
Jt means that we are settling the difference in cash, to
be used in buying of other countries what Hawaii
should take from us. A remission of duties only upon
a volume of imports from her equal to that of our ex
ports to her would be genuine reciprocity and a use
ful spur to our own trade.
It would stimulate the islands to consume as much
American products as they send of theirs to our mar
ket, and would do away with some of the objections
to the encroachment of their surplus upon the market
here of similar merchandise produced by our own
labor.
Reciprocity is an American policy. We pursued
it profitably in former days in our Canadian trade,
and have successfully experimented with it in our ex
changes with the West Indies and South America.
But these experiments have been so well guarded that
the sacrifice of revenue was offset by a gain in trade.
The reports of Consul-General Mills show that for
i 895 99 per cent of Hawaiian exports were to the
United States, while of her imports for the same year
only 79 per cent were from the United States. She
sent us practically all of her exports, but she spent the
proceeds with Great Britain, China. Japan, Australia
and New Zealand, Germany and Canada, in the order
named. Her total exports were $8,474,138, and her
imports were $5,714,017. As she sent to us $8,392,189
and took from us only $4,516,319, we had to make
good a balance of $3,875,870, of which she spent
$1,197,698 in buying of other countries and retained
the balance.
In 1896 her exports amounted to $15,515,230, of
which she sent to us $15,460,008, and in the same year
she took from us only $5,464,207, leaving a balance
against us of $0,095,801, and bought of other countries
nearly 25 per cent of all her imports, while we took
99 per cent of her exports.
This is stimulating trade with other nations at our
expense. These statistics show the need of applying
plain commercial principles to our relations with the
islands and the installing of a better form of reci
procity which will give to our export trade *o them
its proper expansion.
The men in control of the Hawaiian Government
should easily see that reciprocity of necessity depends
upon a fair equality of exchange. If we remit duty on
$15,000,000 of Hawaiian imports and she on only
$5,000,000 of American imports, this principle of
equality is largely lacking. Such a one-sided system
cannot long endure, and unless the advantages of re
ciprocity are equalized the whole system will fail and
the treaty will be abrogated.
It is to save the commercial principle involved and
to avoid the injury to interests concerned that we
advise a revision of these relations that will inflict no
wrong upon either country, but will be to the con
tinued advantage of both.
Announcement is made that a Tacoma man has suc
ceeded in transmuting antimony into gold. The great
charm about such reports as this is that nobody is
expected to believe them.
When Consuls begin to resign it is a sign that
something is the matter. Consuls have been known
to die, but this habit of resigning is something new.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1898.
IF the Board of Freeholders now engaged in com
piling a new charter desire to place before the
voters an instrument which will stand some chance
of adoption they will study the problem of economi
cal administration. The strong demand of the people
of this city at the moment is for an economical and
efficient government. There is no disposition to be
parsimonious, either in salaries, number of officials or
in amount that may be expended for public improve
ments. But it is perfectly safe to say that the people
will reject any charter which creates more offices J
without promising better government.
When the charter now in course of compilation
comes up for adoption comparisons will be made
with the present system. If the Freeholders create
more tax eaters the people will want to know how the
government is going to be improved by their employ
ment. All municipal extravagance begins and ends
in the salary roll. Every time a new charter is
adopted it is found to contain facilities for enlarging
the number of offices which may be permanently fas
tened upon the treasury. No one ever thinks of
abolishing or consolidating municipal functions, but
the slightest excuse for increasing the number of
places at the disposal of the head of this or that de
partment serves as a crying necessity for more office
holders.
The tendency to increase municipal expenditure
without producing corresponding benefit is well un
derstood in San Francisco. It may be set down as
certain that our people will reject any charter that
makes provision for extravagant management.
It follows, therefore, that if the Freeholders desire
to frame a charter which will receive the approval of
the people they should do four things. First, they
should provide an unchangeable limit on taxation;
second, they should place the power to increase or
diminish the forces of the different departments of the
city government in the Board of Supervisors; third,
they should cut the number of Commissi^ .ers down
to the lowest notch, creating only such as are abso
lutely necessary; fourth, they should pay for large
public improvements with bond issues. As bonds can
only be issued after a vote of the people this will prove
an effectual check on all wild or extravagant schemes
of improvement.
When the charter to be proposed by the Freehold
ers is placed before the voters it will be examined
solely with a view to ascertaining how and in what
manner the government has been cheapened. If it
shall be found that the extravagances of the present
system have all been retained and more added to them
and that a limit of taxation has been provided which,
by fixing expenditures, will create an annual deficit,
the charter will be rejected by a large majority.
What the people want is an economical and efficient
government. Efficiency can never be attained so long
as tax eaters are falling over each other at the City
Hall, nor can economy be produced s<~> long as there
is no limit to taxation and the power to create places
is uncurbed. Until the people can pet n charter which
will make provision for such a government as we have
outlined it is safe to say they will endure the evils
they have rather than fly to others they know not of.
DOVID BENNETT HILL'S PLATFORM.
BRYAN, Towne and other silver-tongued orators
who have words to she<i and arc prepared to
shed them now had better hasten swifjly to
New York and try the witchery of their eloquence
there or they may have tcar> to shed at the Demo
cratic convention in 1900, and briny, bitter tears at
that.
The astute and energetic David Bennett Hill is not
politically dead, neither is he sleeping. From his en
forced retirement at Wolfert's Roost there comes no
sound of words, but the l>uzz of the wood saw goes
on continuously and the hum of it is ominous to the
planks of the Chicago platform and all who stand
thereon. Mr. Hill is working while Bryan talks. He
is reaching out a glad hand to every Democratic ma
chine in the State of New York from Tammany in the
metropolis by the sea to that of Buffalo by the lake.
He has a candidate and a platform to substitute for
those put forth at Chicago, and they are of a kind that
are dangerous to the silver men and the issue of 16
to r.
Hill is wise enough to know that there is no way
of dodging the money question. He proposes, there
fore, to make it a subordinate issue of 1000 by setting
up another which will prove more tempting to the
Democratic hosts than the enticing proposition Bryan
offers. His plan of campaign as defined by the latest
reports from New York is to raise the battle cry of
"Down with the trusts" and array the combined hosts
of Democracy and Populism against corporations of
all kinds, from those that control transcontinental
railroads to those that manage local water companies.
It cannot be questioned that the tactics of the New-
Yorker are cunning. If there is anything which can
call off the dogs of war of the forces of discontent in
this country from pursuit of the silver issue it is to
offer them the trusts ns a new game to follow and
devour if they can. The campaign of education in
discontent on the subject is already well advanced.
Hill can appeal to a sentiment formed beforehand to
respond to him. It is this fact that gives importance
to his plans and renders it imperative upon the silver
men to head him off while there is yet time.
The new tactics are essentially the same as those
of the Bryanites, but are more dangerous because
they have more plausible grounds on which to ap
peal to popular discontent. Men of all parties con
cede that legislation is advisable to check the in
creasing aggressions of trusts against the general
welfare, but intelligent men recognize that such legis
lation should be the result of conservative counsel and
non-partisan action, as it has been in the past. To
raise the issue as a party cry is to give a new oppor
tunity to demagogues and agitators to divide the
people into classes rather than into political parties,
and would therefore be a menace to the social and
industrial peace of the republic.
The recent address of ex-President Harrison on
Washington's birthday is a proof that Republican
leaders well understand the evils produced in the
country by unscrupulous wealth, and are prepared to
redress them. That was the speech of conservatism
and of wisdom on the issue. Very different is the
course advocated by Hill. He would have the of
fenses of the trusts magnified, exaggerated and dis
torted to monstrosities in order to inflame the masses
against every one who is rich, whether he is a member
of a trust or not. It is a desperate game to play, but
it promises Hill and Tammany a chance to win their
way back to power in 1900. and they seem determined
to play it under the cry of "anything to beat Bryan."
It would be a pity if the Philippine Islands were to
free themselves now from the hateful rule of Spain.
If they will wait a little longer they would be likely
to find the task much easier.
Young Sullivan, who shot the Keatings, is said to
yearn for a reputation as a killer. A man with this
ambition deserves encouragement. He should be af
forded every facility for suicide.

) /"> EVERAL members of the signal corps and officers of the artil
) L lery have been experimenting with the searchlights at Sandy
) Hook and Fort Wadsworth, says the New York World. At pres
) Vs./ ent there are two projectors at Fort Wadsworth, each having
) reflectors thirty inches in diameter. Before the month is over
) two lights of the same power will be placed on the works at Fort
) Hamilton. The single great searchlight at Sandy Hook is the largest
i in the world. It was constructed by the General Electric Company for
) purposes of exhibition, and was so successful that the Government
) purchased it and placed it at Fort Hancock, where it now sweeps
i the sea for thirty miles from its pedestal, close to the . shore of the
i Hook.
This great light is ten feet six inches from the pedestal to the top
of the ventilator. Its weight is 6000 pounds, but so perfectly Is it bal
anced that a child can move It at will. The reflecting lens Is sixty
inches in diameter. It is a concave, spherical mirror and reflects a
sensibly parallel ray of light. This lens is three and one-fourth
inches thick at the edges and only one-sixteenth of an inch thick at
the center. It weighs 800 pounds. The metal ring which surrounds it
is 750 pounds in weight.
Just how far a beam of light reflected by this projector dan be
seen has not yet been definitely determined. It is estimated that it
is capable of manifesting itself for a distance of between 200 and 300
miles.
The thirty-inch reflector now at Fort Wadsworth, and soon to be
placed at Fort Hamilton, throws a beam of light nearly a hundred
miles. The power of the light is approximately equal to 100,000 can
dles.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
There were 15S court-martials in the
British navy in l^M on bluejackets and
marines afloat and 22S court-martials on
marines ashore, making a total of 356
court-martials for 491 offenses. The
strength was ".?M, making one man tried
out of every 300. In the United States
navy the moan strength during 1896 w;is
12. .'00 and there wrere 147 court-martials,
giving a ratio of one trial to S5 men.
Of the court-martials in our navy 101
were of the seamen class, of which the
mean strength was 10.000, and forty-six
marines, of which there were ttto. The
relative proportion of trials of the two
branches were one to ninety-nine in the
seamen class and one to fifty-four in the
marine corps. The latter service is im
proving every year if the diminishing
number of court-martinis is an indication
to that effect. It will be observed that in
the British navy there were 228 marines
at shore stations, the moan strensth not
exceeding 6200, which would make one
out of twonty-ttcven men tried, or just
twice the number in our marine corps.
The British cruiser-Diadem is still going
through a series of trials to determine the
coal consumption at certain speeds with a
given number of boilers in use. Each trial
is of fifteen hours' duration and has given
satisfactory economic results from the
water-tube boilers. With eight boilers, 270
pounds of steam and sixty-five revolu
tions, 3266 horse-power were developed on
a consumption of 2.35 pounds of coal per
horse-power. "With sixteen boilers, 260
pounds of steam and 89 revolutions the
horse-power was 7119 and the coal used
1.94 pounds. The latest trial with twenty
four boilers, carrying 265 pounds of steam,
resulted In 107 revolutions, 12.552 horse
power on I.BS pounds of coal. This last
trial lasted through thirty hours and the
speed, taken by land marks, showed an
average of twenty knots during nearly
eleven hours.
The launch of one of the cruisers built
at Stettin last December was not a suc
cess. The vessel was to be launched. De
cember 11, and high Chinese dignitaries
and others were on hand to witness the
affair, but the vessel refwsed to move on
time. During the first half hour the ship
moved only one yard and when darkness
set in she had progressed about thirty
five feet. It took several days to effect
the launch, and Involved considerable ex
pense, nor had it at last accounts been
ascertained if the ship had sustained any
damage.
The Japanese battle-ship Shikishlwa,
building at the Thames Iron Works, Lon
don, will be forty-eight feet longer than
the Majestic class of six in the British
navy. The horsepower will be 14,500,
against 12,000 of the Majestic, and the
main armament will consist of four 12
inch and fourteen quick-tiring 6-inch guns,
which exceeds the British battle-ship ar
mament by two 6-inch guns.
Twelve sailors were drowned in the har
bor of Kiel on the night of February 5.
They were crossing from the navy yard
over to the town in a steam launch when
a heavy sea boarded and sunk the launch.
The sailors, heavily clothed and armed,
went down with the boat.
The French naval estimates, as finally
passed by the Chamber, authorize the
construction of one battle-ship of the
Jena type, of 12 000 tons; three armored
cruisers of 9500 tons each, and eleven tor
pedo-boats.
With the Victorious, Barfleur and Gib
raltar added to the ships now in the
British squadron in Chinese waters, Eng
land's navy will exceed those of France
and Russia together by 25,000 tons.
The torpedo-boat destroyer Violet made
an average speed of thirty knots an hour
during a recent continuous trial of three
hours. ___^_^_______

"Certainly," said Silver Dick, without
even looking up from his hand. The East

down upon the table, saying "Give me

one white chip from the bank. "There

The Easterner looked stupidly about

STRONGER THAN ANY
OTHERSLID CRABWISE
DOWN THE WAYS
Launch of a New Stern
wheel Steamer at the
Fulton Yards.
She Will Constitute Another
Addition to the Yukon
Fleet.
Tha Vessel Was So Anxious to
Reach the Water That She De
scended Prematurely.
It was rather a peculiar launch, be
cause the great flat-bottomed boat, in
stead of gliding gracefully stern first
into the water, as most vessels do,
vent down the ways sidelong, getting
into the bay very much after the
fashion of a crab. But this method of
launching, adapted merely as a mat
ter of convenience and to save valua
ble ground space, did not detract from
the success of the event at all. There
was bustle and activity at the Fulton
engineering yards yesterday morning
when the time of high water drew
nigh. The situation is somewhat ex
posed, looking right across the entrance
to the harbor, and the waves of the
bay were anxiously watched, to make
sure that the swell which broke on the
beach was not strong enough to injure
the newly built craft. The launch
should have taken place on Monday,
but the sea proved too boisterous. Yes
terday, however, the weather was more
favorable, and punctually at 11 the
lashing which secured the ways parted
with a snap, and the vessel glided
swiftly down the steep incline into the
water. In fact, so anxious was she
to reach her native element that she
somewhat anticipated the wishes of the
shipyard people, and went off while
men were still knocking away the
shores under her bottom. Fortunate
ly no one was injured, though it was
a near shave for the shipwrights.
There was no ceremony about the
launching. They did not even brenk
the traditional bottle of wine over her
bows. The Alaskan trade is tar too
prosaic and money making, and has no
time to waste upon such frivolities. A
tug, carrying the president of the
Alaska-Yukon Transportation Com
pany, for whom the steamer has been
built, and several of the Harbor Com
missioners, watched the proceedings
from the water. Ashore Captain Hat
field, the superintendent of construc
tion fur the company, looked after af
fairs.
Also there were a great many small
boats manned with a miscellaneous col
lection of wharf loungers. The pictur
esque side of the event had, however,
no charms for them; their task was
more prosaic. As soon as the vessel
reached the water, and the cradles
which had hitherto carried her were
released, there were fine pickings in the
way of firewood to be obtained. All
sorts of logs and wedges and shores
floated to the surface, and the boats
promptly secured the spoil. Many of
the cradles, however, did not float;
thfey were retained under the flat bot
tom of the vessel, and will probably
remain there until dragged out with a
rope.
As she dances lightly on the water
the James Eva resembles nothing more
closely than the traditional Noahs Ark
of our childhood's days. She has the
game flat bottom, the same spoon
shaped bows, and above all, the same
high superstructure in which Noah is
popularly supposed to have stabled his
menagerie. But, nevertheless, she Is
a fine, substantial river vessel, solidly
built out of Oregon pine, and capable
of carrying some five hundred passen
gers, besides a large quantity of cargo.
She is so shallow that, when launched.
6he did not draw more than a foot and
a half of water. When completed,
with all her machinery on board, her
draft will not exceed twenty-one inches
and thus she will be able to cross the
dangerous flats on the Yukon, which
have proved fatal to so many of the
river craft.
"She would have been still lighter."
remarked Captain Hat field, "If we could
have built her of steel. I calculate
that a steel vessel of the same dlmen*
Bions would have weighed at least a
hundred tons less and would hay
drawn six inches less water. This would
have enabled us to have carried more
heavy cargo and to navigate the
river with greater safety."
The new steamer is 168 feet long, 36
fpet wide and 7 feet deep. She will
have compound engines of 400 horse
power, and will cost somewhere in the
neighborhood of $35,000. A sister ship
Js to be commenced at once by the
Fulton Engineering Company, and as
Boon as navigation opens both vessels
will be placed on the Yukon.

HEAVY BONDS
FOR DUGGAN
The "General" Must Stand
Trial in the Superior
Court.
Little Alice Loy Tells the Story
of Her Inhuman Treat
ment.
Mrs. Clark's "Army" Rallies to the
Defense of a Man Charged Wt'h
a Heinous Offense.
"General" George Spurgeon Duggan
has been held for trial before the Su
perior Court by Pulice Judge Low,
with bonds fixed at $3000, on the charge
of brutally attacking Alice Loy, the
seven-year-old girl who was brought
to this city from Portland by Mrs. J.
A. Clark about two months ago.
Yesterday's proceedings in the Po
lice Co-urt gave an insight into the life
of the crowd of vagabonds who, under
the cloak of religion, prey upon the
charitable for a livelihood, their meth
ods casting reflection upon the Salva
tionists and Volunteers, and retarding
in a measure the good work in which
those organizations are engaged.
The charge against Duggan bids fair
to disrupt the half-dozen people who
call themselves God's Regular Army,
of which Mrs. Clark Is the head. It
was she who swore to the complain L
against Duggan, and yesterday she
was one of the chief witnesses for the
prosecution, though it must be ad
mitted that she was a reluctant wit
ness and appeared to be shielding the
defendant in every way possible. Dug
gan called upon nearly every member
of Mrs. Clark's forces to testify in his
behalf when given an opportunity to
present his case, in addition to taking
the stand himself, and it is doubtful
if Falstaff himself mustered a more
unkempt crowd than that which rallied
to the defense of the man on trial for
the most heinous offense known. It
was noticeable that the "General" was
not supported by any of his own fol
lowers; not a member of "Jesu3
Christ's Army" was placed upon the
witness stand. But it is possible that
Duggan himself constituted the rank
and file of his forces.
Alice Loy, a pretty tot with a wealth
of soft, flaxen hair falling about her
delicate features, was brought down
from Sacramento, where she is being
cared for, and told the story of her in
human treatment with a childish sim
plicity and straightforwardness that
carried conviction of its truth. Dr. C.
D. McGettigan, medical superintendent
of the Sisters' Hospital, where Alice
has found shelter and friends, came
down with the child and gave expert
testimony as to the brutality of her ill
treatment. Mrs. Clark and Secretary
Frank Kane of the Society for'the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children also tes
tified for the prosecution.
The first witness for the defense was
Jessie Smith, a twelve-year-old girl,
who was at the headquarters of Jesus
Christ's Army with Alice Loy at the
time of the alleged assault. When the
complaint was sworn out this girl
made a statement to Prosecuting At
torney Reynolds, fully corroborating
Alice's story, but since then she has
modified her story to such an extent
that the prosecution did not see fit to
place her on the stand. However,
when it came Reynolds' turn to cross
examine her he brought out considera
ble that was damaging to Duggan.
Judge Low asked her if anybody had
talked to her about the case, and she
admitted that her father and mother
had, but afterward said they had told
her to state the truth.
Mrs. Flora Smith and Jacob Smith,
the mother and father of the girl, were
i also called on behalf of Duggan, both
seeming to be anxious to shield him
as much as possible. They are both
members of Mrs. Clark's army, and
came from Portland with her. J. W.
Pray and J. W. Dobbin, two more of
God's Regular Army, testified for the
defense, and then the Judge put a
str.p to the flow of eloquence that Dug
gan's attorney was about to uncork by
holding Duggan in $3000 bail.
POLICE AND FIRE
MANAGEMENT
Ireeholders Decide on a Joint Sys
tem of Protection for the
City. t .
But little work was transacted last
night at the meeting of the Freeholders.
The greater part of the session was de
voted to the discussion of the department
of electricity. It was decided to place the
department in charge of the construction
and maintenance of the fire alarm and
police, telegraph and telephone systems,
under the control of a Joint commission
composed of the Board of Fire Commis
sioners and Board of Police Commission
ers. The Joint commissions shall appoint
a practical and skilled electrician to have
general supervision of the department
and the commission shall have power to
appoint such assistants as may be neces
sary to keep the system in working order.
Any citizen, firm or corporation may, for
the purpose of police or fire protection, be
connected with the system, but not on the
main line, on the payment of such

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1898.
LITTLE EVA IS A DRUNKARD.
Infant Daughter of the Farzolos of the Latin
Quarter Attends a Kindergarten in an
Intoxicated Condition.
Little Eva Farzolo. a child 3 years of age. living in the Latin Quarter of
the city, is a confirmed drunkard who has learned to cultivate a taste for
liquor under the careful tuition of her parents. Her little body is literally
saturated with the liquor which
big door, where she would immediately fall asleep.
Her condition began to go from bad to worse, until one day in the
early part of last week Miss Walnwright decided to take action against the
parents and compel them to either discontinue giving the child wine or give
her over entirely into the care of some public institution, as she had en
tered the school that morning in a thoroughly hopeless state of drunken
ness. When she came into the building she was unable to stand, and stag
gered into the class room among her little classmates and fell in a pitiable
heap in one corner. She was lifted from the floor by one of the teachers
and taken from tfie room to the assembly hall, where she was placed upon
a couch to sleep off the effects of the liquor.
Miss Walnwright made a thorough investigation of the child's condi
tion, her home surroundings and the character of her parents, and ascer
tained that although they were respectable, hard-working people, they were
entirely neglecting the proper bringing up of the child, and warned them
that unless they discontinued giving it wine and unless liquor of every kind
was withheld from her, she would place Eva in one of the public institu
tions. This threat had the effect of frightening the Farzolos, as Eva has
not been in an intoxicated condition since the investigation was made.
Her parents are Italians, entirely unacquainted with the Enclish lan
guage, and don't seem to see the significance of denying the child the use of
FITCH AGAINST
THE SUPERVISORS
The Board's Appeal Argued
Before the Supreme Court
in Bank.
Reasons Given Why thÂ« Officials
Should and Should Not Bo
"Fired."
The case of George K. Fitch against the
Board of Supervisors was heard by the
Justices of the Supreme Court sitting in
bank yesterday. The matter came up on
arguments on the appeal by the board
from the decree of Superior Judge Wal
lace, which was that the Supervisors be
removed from office for not fixing the
water rates in February, 1597. The court
room was filled with law books and legal
talent.
E. S. Pillsbury and Garret McEnerney
represented the Board of Supervisors,
Frank McGowan and Stephen Costello
were there in the interests of Supervisors
Lackman and Rottanzi, and P. G. Galpln,
W. T. Baggett and G. W. Schell repre
sented George K. Fitch, the plaintiff.
Some of the Prominent Figures at Duggan's Examination.
The argument was opened by Mr. Pills
bury, who contended that If the malfeas
ance described is to be followed by re
moval from office it is under a general
definition of the code a crime, and a con
viction should be by ordinary methods
prescribed for the prosecution of public
offenses. The attorney further contended
that the statutes requiring the water
rates to be fixed at a certain time, with
removal as the penalty, do not conform to
constitutional requirements. Unforeseen
things might arise that would make com
pliance impossible, and the law does not
require impossibilities. Another point of
attack was that the law itself is defective,
inasmuch as it provides for the removal
of Boards of Supervisors Instead of the
individual members of the board. The in
tent was the removal of the officers, not
the board. Before taking his seat the at
torney raised the point that Mr. Fitch
was not an interested rate-payer. While
the plaintiff's testimony showed that he
used water, it did not show that Mr. Fitch
paid for it.
Justice McFarland threw out the sug
gestion that rates cut no figure in the
controversy. The statute directed that
the board fix the rates in a stated month
and if the statute be constitutional and
the rates not fixed on time removal must
ensue.
Frank McGowan argued hat his clients,
Rottanzi and Lackman, had done all in
their power to have the rates fixed ac
cording to law and that they had been
held guiltless by Judge Wallace, although
the order of removal applied to them as
well as to those really to blame. He
dwelt upon the injustice these two suf
her parents have allowed her to
use as freely as water, and her
mind, unless a check is put to the
vicious habit, â will become ruined
and leave the child an absolute
Idiot.
The first indication of her true
condition was noticed by Miss Eliz
abeth Wainwright, the principal of
the Silver Star Free Kindergarten,
where Eva attended.
Although the child was naturally
inclined to be good-natured, it was
found that at certain times she
was crabbed and nervous, display
ing an utter lack of interest in the
games and exercises which chil
dren as a rule enjoy and which
make the kindergarten an attrac
tion to them. Her mind, it was no
ticed, was totally unable to grasp
the ideas which suggested them
selves by the figures on the exer
cise cards, as she seemed to be al
ways in a semi-conscious condition.
At every opportunity she would
wander away alone into the hall
way of the building, to seek a se
cluded nook in the shadow of the
fered for the short-comings of the ma
jority.
Mr. Galpin spoke for Mr. Fitch and i
traced the history of legislation provid
ing for removal from office and he de
clared that until recently such a pro
cedure was considered a civil action.
Criminal proceedings are conducted in the j
name of the people and with the District |
Attorney as prosecutor. This was not re- j
garded as a criminal action. The attorney
contend' d that malfeasance is not the i
act of any one individual, but of the
board as a whole. This statute deprives
the accused of a trial by jury, which it
could n"t do if it was a criminal proceed
ing. In conclusion he said that there
were two ways uf reaching the board, by"
civil and criminal proceedings, and the
former was chosen as being the most
likely to give speedy results. Removal,
he asserted, was not a penalty, -but a
condition fastened to the law if the re
quirements were not fulfilled.
After further general discussion, in
which the Justices took a part, the matter I
was submitted. Judging from the present I
over-crowded condition of the calendar of !
the Supreme Court the Supervisors' terms j
of office will have expired before a de- !
cision is reached.
WITH AND AGAINST WIND.
Fly-Casters Practicing for the Open
to-AU Tournament in Sep
tember.
The San Francisco Fly-casting Club met j
last evening in the new quarters of
the Fish Commission, which Is room 2 on |
the seventh floor of the Mills building, i
In future the club will hold all its meet- j
ings in the assembly room, second floor*
of the building. The next gathering of
the fly-casters will be on Tuesday even- i
ing, the 22d inst. Considerable discussion I
was had relative to the change of posi
tions of the buoys and lines for long-dis
tance casting. Some members were of '
the opinion that the buoys should be j
placed so that every member of thÂ« club '
could reap a benefit. Then there were i
others who thought that by casting from I
platforms, where the back cast would not
be interfered with by brush or land con- i
siderable benefit would result to all con
cerned in long-distan.o casting. On mo- I
tlon of President Mansfield, the club de- !
cided to place <-c buoya in such a posi
tion that in future there will not be an
opening left for argument
On Saturday, the 19th Inst the first nf
the bait-casting contests will be held at i
Siowe Lake, and doubtless n.e new vÂ£t i
cumbersome style of casting will iffnr,! i
considerable pleasure, it being an in nova!
The executive committee decided, after!
the meeting had adjourned that in
future the results of Che contests and the l
order in which the events will take place
shall be written on blackboards placed
within full view of the contestants and
spectators.
The executive committee will also re
port at a meeting which will oe held in
the assembly-room on April 5 what plan
it will have formulated relative to Im
parting information to Kastern fly-casters
concerning the prizes, rules, etc of the
open-to-all tournament which will be held
next September on Stowe Lake under
the auspices of the San Francisco Flv

INDIAN MOTHER
MAY BE ALIVE
Her Children Were Ac
knowledged by Julius
L. Franklin.
Attorneys Are Preparing for
the Legal Combat to
Follow.
The Small Estate Explained by
Conveyances in His Life
time.
The two sensational petitions which
are the forerunners of a will contest
against the estate of Julius L. Frank
lin were filed yesterday morning in the
County Clerk's office; and concealed in
their legal verbiage is a story, the main
facts of which were told in yesterday's
Call. The allegations of fraudulent j
conveyances during the lifetime of the
deceased are emphasized by the attor
neys who will conduct the opposition to
the will, and they also asseverate that
they have an abundance of proof to
justify the action taken by their
clients.
The Indian woman â a genuine Chi
nook with the blood of a line of chief
tains in her veins â was supposed to
have disappeared from the sight of the |
world when Franklin changed his ad
venturous career as fur trader in the
wilds to that of business man in civil
ized Portland. The children by that
union accompanied him to that city, but
nothing is known positively about the
wife during Franklin's residence there.
But that she was alive at the time is
a fact that certain men who knew
Franklin persist in declaring. There i
are men in this town who say that the
dusky native-born daughter of the
heather was alive four years ago and
that there is every reason to believe she
still draws the air of this terrestrial j
sphere. That she was as a Nemesis to
Franklin in hia lifetime is assured, for
he never mentioned her name, and the
subject was at all times painful to him.
Those with whom Franklin was en
gaged in business say that he never
spoke of his former red-skinned com
panion. They knew that the report
was current that he had children
whose blood was not pure. In his will
he distinctly declares Benjamin, Mol
lie and Lena Franklin to be his own
children, and to each he leaves a spe
cific legacy, small in amount in com
parison to his reputed wealth. But to
the children of his second union he be
queaths nothing, trusting to his wife
to attend to their wants. The attor
neys of the children of the dead capi
talist and the dusky princess are of
opinion that in his lifetime suitable
provision was made for the offspring of
his present widow with a view to pre
vent all possibility of a successful con
| test of his will.
The lawyers are beginning to pre
pare for the fray. Coogan and Kahn,
attorneys for Mrs. Pauline Franklin,
say that they will protect the interests
of their client, and if a contest of tho
â will Is necessary it will be fought to
the bitter end. They declare that the
will is valid and it will stick like muci
lage. With scorn they laugh at the
idea of fraudulent conveyances with
the purpose to defraud natural children
of their interests. Julius Kahn said
yesterday: "Mr. Franklin's wealth was
much overrated. In his lifetime, seve
ral years before his marriage, he gave
to his wife presents of property, both
personal and real, but that he did this
with intent to injure others is ab
surd. Of course, he recognized these
other children as his own, for he men
tions them in his will."
But there are some who think other
wise. John F. Riley, attorney for Ben.
jamln J. Franklin, the first born and
issue of the deceased, tells another
He said: 'That the -inventory shows
an estate of a few thousand dollars in
value is nothing. We intend to prove
that Franklin was devoted to his chil
dren during the early part of his mar
riage with Mrs. Pauline Franklin and
that gradually his affection for them
was alienated. We have evidence that
real property worth $60,000 was con
veyed by Franklin in his last year of
life, and that this was done to exclude
his 'first children from inheriting any
portion of his estate. Also that large
blocks of bonds, shares of stocks and
personal property were converted with
j the same Intent. Nothing in the in
ventory shows an accounting of
Franklin's interest in the firm of Metz
ger & Franklin, lottery dealers."
Felix H. Merzbach, also an attorney
I for the children of the early union, is
equally asseverative of the rights and
justice of his clients' cause. "We in
tend to frame a bill in equity to set
aside every conveyance which was an
act of fraud against these children.
We will show that the history of their
childhood was full of malice and op
pression, and they were deprived of
their paternal estate without justice or
show of right."
The merry dance goes on, and now
the dramatis personae are the lawyers,
an Indian mother, a widow and a half
dozen children.
COMMERCE WITH CHINA.
Business Men Will Ask to Hive
America's Rights Preserved.
The subject of the commerce between
this country and China was under dis

Commerce yesterday. It was brought up
by a communication from the Chamber
of Commerce of New York. This sub
ject has caused all or the commercial
bodies of the United States not a little

thought. The manner in which the pow
| ers of Europe have swooped down upon
China and seized her ports has led the
American merchants to believe that their
former relations with China znight be
sadly impaired if some action was not
taken by the heads of this Government.
The New York Chamber lias sent to all
commercial bodies letters asking co-op
eration in calling 1 the attention of the
President to the situation. The local
chamber decided to help in tlft> movement
by sending a memorial to the President
requesting 1 him to take such steps as will

COMPLAINED OF BY MANY.
The State Labor Commissioner Will
Investigate the Clerks'
Exchange.
A local private institution, variously
known as the Shepard Publishing Com
pany, the Manufacturers' Register, Reg
istration and Employment Office, anrt
Clerks' Exchange, has become mixed up
with one of the State officers, because of
the many complaints made that all the
business is not conducted as it should be.
It Is the Clerks' Exchange department
that seems to be in the most trouble, and
to-day the Labor Commissioner will
make' an official investigation to see if
any of the laws relating to labor have
been violated. There are two offices for
the Clerks' Exchange, one at 313 Bush
street, and the other at 1039 Market. For
many days there have been complaints
made to the Labor Commissioner that the
managers of the business have been tak
ing money from their victims on the
promise of getting them employment.
One of the latest complainants was a
man to whom fate has been very unkind.
He said that a few days ago he paid the
managers his last $2, they promising to
provide him with work by the Ist of
March. In order to bridge over the inter
val he sold his furniture at a great sacri
fice and waited for the job which never
came. When he asked the managers to
make good their word he was told that
they had no place for him. The man.
who has a family, is really destitute and
his lot is similar to many other cases re
ported to the commissioner. Yesterday
the latter decided that it was time for
him to act and he summoned W. H. Shep
srd and Isaac Sheely, the managers, to
appear before him and show if they are
transacting a legitimate business. If not
they will be prosecuted. These men will
have to produce their books for inspec
tion.

DANGER IN SODA.
Serious Results Sometimes Follow ItÂ»
Excessive Use.
Corrtmon soda is all right in its place
and indispensable in the kitchen and
for cooking and washing purposes, but
it was never intended for a medicine,
and people who use it as such will some
day regret it.
We refer to the common use of soda
to relieve heartburn or sour stomach, a
habit which thousands of people prac-
tice almost daily, and one which is
fraught with danger. Moreover, the
soda only gives temporary relief, and
in the end the stomach trouble gets
worse and worse.
The soda acts as a mechanical irri-
tant to the walls of the stomach and
bowels, and cases are on record where
it accumulated in the intestines, caus-
ing death by inflammation or periton-
itis.
Dr. Harlandson recommends as the
safest and surest cure for sour stomach
(acid dyspepsia) an excellent prepara-
tion sold by druggists under the name
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. These
tablets are large 20-gram lozenges,
very pleasant to taste, and contain the
natural acids, peptones and digestive
elements, essential to good digestion,
and when taken after meals they digest
the food perfectly and promptly before
it has time to ferment, sour and poison
the blood and nervous system.
Dr. "Wuerth states that he invariably
uses Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in all
cases of stomach derangements, and
finds them a certain cure not only tot
sour stomach, but Ly promptly digest-
ing the food they create a healthy ap-
petite, increase flesh and strengthen
the action of tho heart and liver. They
are not a cathartic, but intended only
for stomach diseases and weakness, and
will be found reliable in any stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at 50 cents per package.

now available was large enough to keep
everything in good shape for active

fantry to perform the duties of an artil
lery regiment.
"The two regiments of artillery will
be stationed on the Atlantic coast,
where their services will most likely be
required. The cost of transportation
across the continent precludes the en
listment here of men for the new or
ganizations."
General Shafter arrived in the city
from the south early in the forenoon
and paid a visit to the fortifications.
He remarked that he found everything
In first-class order as usuai.
Speaking of ammunition, in response
to some inquiries on that subject, the
general said the guns of the harbor
were well supplied. He did not know
anything about the quantity of reserve
ammunition at Benicia arsenal, but
knew that the batteries at Fort Point
and Lime Point were supplied for im
mediate requirement.
General Shafter is here to remain,
and will no doubt keep a watchful eye
on the work of strengthening the de
fenses of San Francisco. It is ascer
tained that one of the two ten-inch
rifles recently received from the East is
already mounted at Fort Point, and
the work of mounting the other is
going ahead rapidly.
No sooner had the bill to increase the
army by two regiments of artillery
passed the Hmise than the wires were
kept hot with telegraphic instructions
to officers in charge of the sixteen gen
eral recruiting stations, and the re
cruiting officers at each military post,
to enlist men for the new Sixth and
Seventh regiments of artillery. The
sixteen general recruiting stations are
located at Albany, N. V.; Boston,
Mass.; Chicago, 111.; Cincinnati, Ohio;
Cleveland, Ohio; Indianapolis, Ind. ;
Louisville, Ky. ; Milwaukee, Wis. ;
Nashville, Term.; New York city;
Philadelphia; Pittsburg. Pa.; Portland,
Or.; Richmond, Va. ; Seattle, Wash.,
and St. Louis, Mo. San Francisco was
formerly a general recruiting station,
but it was abolished a year or so ago,
since which time an officer at the
Presidio has been detailed at that
place as recruiting officer. At the pres
ent time First Lieutenant Geo-rge A.
Detchmendy, Company F, First Infan
try, is the recruiting officer.
The recruit rendezvous are at Fort
Slocum, N. V. ; Columbus Barracks,
Ohio; Fort Sheridan, 111., and Jefferson
Barracks, Mo.
Details for officers of the general re
cruiting service are ordinarily made
for two years. The recruits of each
rendezvous are instructed by officers
and non-commissioned officers of the
garrison. The applicant must be a cit
izen of the United States or have de
clared his intention, unmarried, able to
read and write the English language,
able-bodied, free from disease, of good
character and temperate habits, and
be between the ages of 21 and 30. Re
cruiting officers are held to a rigid ac
countability for the enlistment of men
who may be found unfit for the ser
vice. During the last two or three
years recruiting stations have been
obliged to reject the applications of
more than 1000 eligible men per month,
and there will be no difficulty in read
ily procuring a full complement of men
for the new Sixth and Seventh regi
ments of artillery. The recruits will
be sent to the headquarters of the new
regiments at Fort Slocum, N. V., and
Fort Monroe, Va.
The report emanating from "Washing
ton, D. C, that the United States had
secured an option to buy the Japanese
cruisers now in course of construction
In this country is not verified.
Irving M. Scott, president of the
Union Iron Works and the builder of
the Imperial Japanese cruiser Chitose,
asserted yesterday that, so far as his
knowledge extended, the United States
had secured no option from Japan for
the purchase of the cruiser. He said:
"In my Judgment, there is no truth in
the story. Although negotiations for
such purpose would be conducted
through the Japanese legation in
Washington, I am confident that I
would be advised of the transaction
If it were pending. I have not heard
directly that any such negotiation was
In contemplation. To my mind, the
whole story lacks the element of proba
bility. The cruiser will probably be
ready for delivery to the Japanese
Government the latter part of this year!
Of course, the construction could bo
hastened, as the Chitose is not an arm
ored battle-ship, and no delay in build
ing need follow a short supply of
armor-plate.
"I understand," continued Mr. Scott,
"that our Government has not pur
chased a pound of armor-plate for the
battle-ships Illinois, Kentucky and
Kearsarge. While the price â $400 a
ton â has seemed high to the United
States, Russia has contracted to pay
Carnegie $600 a ton for a large quan
tity of armor-plate.
"We have received no orders at the
Union Iron Works to hasten the con
struction on the battle-ship Wisconsin.
Every week the naval constructors re
port to the department the progress
of work on the ship."

THE SAX FEAKCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, MAUCH 9, 1898.
TOM SHARKET is In the pink of
condition, and according to his
own words he has never felt bet
ter in his life,
Sharkey is matched to fight Joe
Choynski twenty rounds on Friday
evening at Woodwards Pavilion. The
Irishman stands 5 feet 8% inches, and
weighs 178 pounds. On Thursday even
ing a referee will be selected by the
contestants, and should they fail to
agree upon any of the men mentioned
during the conference, the National
Club will select some man from among
the ones who have already acted in
the capacity of referee of glove con
tests in this city.
Yesterday afternoon the sporting edi
tions of the three morning papers, by
kind invitation from the National Club,
enjoyed a very pleasant ride to and
from Sharkey's training quarters,
which are situated on the ocean beach
and known as Haggerty's sporting ren
dezvous. The muscular and all-pow
erful athlete, who is to hold a fistic
interview with the clever and agile
Choynski, was on hand when a spank
ing team, which was in charge of
"Curly Bill," the celebrated whip in
the good old days of Virginia City, had
arrived.
"How are you, Tom?" was the first
question asked of the man who has
already had a tilt with Corbett, Choyn
ski, Maher, Fitzsimmons and others of
less fistic fame.
Sharkey with a face illuminated in
smiles shook hands with the visitors
and in a very modest way remarked:
"Well, boys, I never felt finer in my
life, and if I am not greatly mistaken
I'll make short work of my man this
trip. There will be no more room left
this time for an argument about foul
fighting, as I will make a clean Job
of it."
Fifteen minutes after the arrival of
the reporters Sharkey appeared, dressed
in his best of fighting clothes and ready
to pose before the camera artists and
be shot in accordance with instructions.
He looked a perfect Hercules when the
huge bathrobe which covered his an
atomy was cast aside by his trainer,
Tim McGrath.
"Oh, I wish the contest was to take
place right now." remarked Sharkey,
as he shot out his powerful right fist
at an imaginary object, and the whirr
of the glove as it cleaved through the
smoky atmosphere temporarily drowned
the muffled sound of the ocean break
ers.
"Great Scot! what a terrific blow that
powerful young fellow can deliver," de
clared Colonel Barrett of New York,
who was one of the interested specta
tors.
The guns of the artists were now
placed in position, and Sharkey, with
his boxing partner, Jack Stelzner, toed
the scratch at the call of time.
The first picture shows Sharkey In
the act of delivering a right-hand body
punch; then follow a left swing for
the jaw and stop by Stelzner; then
right hand across, right swing at jaw,
left hook for body, landing on solar
plexus and right-hand upper-cut.
When this part of the performance
was over, Sharkey and Stelzner en
gaged in four three-round bouts, which
proved to be a much stiffer exhibition
of hitting and stopping than the spec
tators had hoped to see. Sufficient to
say however, that stelzner did not re
gret the fact that the bout had ended
before any serious damage to his an
atomy resulted, as Sharkey Is not ac
customed to light sparring.
Joe Kennedy, who is a big strapping
fellow with some science, then had a
setta with muscular Tom, but the ex
changes were comparatively light, as?
Kennedy had a rib broken a
few days ago by the "gentle"
man o' warsman, on whose pow
erful breast is stamped in Ink a pic
ture of .the battle-ship in which Shar
key has sailed the seas over.
Sharkey's programme of training is
as follows: Up at 6:30, breakfast at
7:30; run of ten miles at 9:30 through
the park, plunge In the ocean at 12,
lunch at 12:30, gymnasium work at 3,
dinner at 5:30 and bed ut 9:30.
The report that Sharkey has im
proved wonderfully In foot work and
also quickness in avoiding blows, is not
groundless. He satisfied some expert
Judges of the game yesterday that he
has vastly improved in many respects
Bince he fought a draw with Choynski
in this city. His style of fighting Â»s
entirely round-arm. He swings right
and left at body and head in the hope
of landing on some vulnerable spot.
Sharkey does not pretend to be a
scientific boxer. When asked why he
leaves his face open to attack he re
plied that a smash on the nose or jaw
does not affect him, and that his chin
cannot be reached, as it is protected by
the mounds of muscle on his shounJ
ers.
"I am always willing to take a punch
If I can give one in return," remarked
Pharkey, "and you can bet that a few
of my punches will set any man groggy
if they land on the right spot."
Betting on the figrht is $10 to $8, with
Sharkey on the long end, but it can
be safely said that the friends of
Choynski, who wager on pugilistic con
tests, will reverse the present order of
betting before the men will enter the
ring on Friday evening.

TWEEDIE
SAID TO BE
A PEELER
Is Expelled From the
St. Patrick's Day
Convention.
Accused of Giving Infor
mation to the Irish
Constabulary.
Aftermath of a Letter Written
Some Three Years
Ago.
IRISHMEN ARE INDIGNANT
Tweedie and His Friends Will Con
duct an Opposition Cele
bration.
Accused of being a "Peeler" and hav
inggained admission to the St. Patrick's
day convention, Daniel Tweedie has
been expelled from that body, and
leaves in Its ranks a general disrespect
for himself.
The trouble which has brought Twee
die into disrepute among local Irish
men is of long standing, and originated
from a letter which he wrote some
three years ago to the Royal Irish Con
stabulary. This letter, which on the
face appears perfectly innocent, re
cently fell into the hands of some local
Irishmen who are thoroughly conver
sant with the famous coersion act
and the methods of the Constabulary.
They read between the lines, and at
once branded the author of the docu
ment as a "Peeler" â a man to whom
the epithets of spy and traitor would
b<s complimentary.
Tweedie was at that time a member
of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
The letter was brought up and debated
upon at the meeting of Tweedie's divi
sion, with the result that his name was
erased from the roster. Out of respect
for his family, however, the matter was
kept quiet, and probably would
never have leaked out had not It been
that Tweedie wished to cut a promi
nent figure in the St. Patrick's day
celebration.
To get in by the channel of the A. O.
H. was Impossible, but he was a promi
nent member of an organization known
as the County Leitrim Social Club, and
through it succeeded in being sent as
a delegate to the convention.
"When the convention was called and
Tweedie was found there as a delegate
there was general consternation among
the men who had already voted his
name from the roll of one Irish organ
ization and naturally felt opposed to
sitting with him ac a delegate.
A conference was held and it was de
cided that for the sake of harmony It
would be better to have the offending
member quietly removed. Tweedie was
determined to hold his seat, and bit
terly contested his right In the conven
tion. It was no use, however, and at
an executive session of the convention
his seat was declared vacant by a large
majority. His fellow delegates from the
County Leitrim Club, Bob O'Reilly and
E. McOushin, resigned their seats as
soon as the action of the convention
was made known.
Tweedie, O'Reilly and McGushin now
say that they will get together and will
hold a celebration which will totally
eclirfse that of the convention, but the
members are not greatly alarmed at
this threatened opposition. They hope
that nothing will come of it, however,
as it might look as though the Irish
bodies were warring among themselves
on the day of all days when general
harmony is supposed to exist.
Tweedie freely admits the authorship
of the letter, but insists that there is
no harm in !t, and that the action of
the convention was stimulated by poli
ticians who have an ulterior purpose
and have been for some time seeking to
down him.

The ladles of St. Patrick's Alliance held

which will be addiesssed to the Irish-
American ladies of San Francisco:
"The men of our race all over the world
are uniting for great demonstrations this
year in honor of the martyrs and heroes
of ' '9S.' In San Francisco it has been
decided by the St. Patrick's day conven
tion to devote the proceeds of the cele
bration here to the fund for tho Wolfe
Tone monument to be erected In Dublin.
This pure and lofty purpose appeals with
special force to Irishmen; and we should
deem it a privilege to assist our brothers
with all our efforts. In response to a call
of the convention a meeting of ladies was
held at Hibernia Hall last Tuesday even
ing, and at this meeting a special com
mittee was appointed to address the
ladles of Han Francisco. It is in accord
ance with this that we cordially ln%ite
those ladies who love the dear old Moth
erland and revere the men who fought
that Ireland might be free, who are proud
of their nationality, devoted to the prin
ciples of their fathers, true to the tradi
tlons of the race to whom "98' is a sacred
memory, and who remember Lymric. to
meet with us at Hibernia Hall next Fri
day evening at 120 Ninth stret, to form
plans to help the convention in their ef
forts to make the coming celebration a
great success, so that California's contri
bution to the Wolfe Tone monument may
be worthy the patriotic generosity that
has always distinguished our great
State."

TELEGRAPHY-W. G., City. If you
will look in the directory you will find !
the names of those who deal in tel- ;
egraphic instruments. This department
will not advertise any business.
A CONVICTâ C. M., Yountvllle, Cal. The
fact that a convict receives creu.i. while
in prison, which shortens the term of im
prisonment, does not restore him to nis
civil rights. To regain these he must be
restored to citizenship according to law.
STAMPâ Subscriber. City. This depart
ment does not advertise any business,
therefore cannot give the names of
"prominent dealers in stamps." If you
will consult the City Directory, under the
head of "classified" you will find the In
formation you desire.
PEDDLINGâ A. S., City. The fact that
an individual is either deaf or dumb, or
both, does not, under the law exempt him
or her from the payment of a license
when engaged in the peddling of wares.
Possibly on application a free license
would be granted.

LEAP YEARâ Subscriber. San Mateo. A :
leap year, one of 366 days, is so called
because It leaps forward a day as com
pared with an ordinary year. It so hap
pens that leap years coincide with the
years that are dlvlsable by four, and
thus they may be known since tho adop
tion of the new style in 1752. Of Â»he
years concluding centuries and known as
"the hundredth year, c. g., 1800, 1900, only
every fourth is a leap year, beginning
with 2000; i. c.. only those divisable by

Arthur Hamlin Arrested
on a Charge of
Vagrancy.
He Is a Grandson of the Late
Vice-President Under
Lincoln.
Judge Conlan After Listening to His
Story at Once Dismisses the
Case.
Arthur Hamlin, a grandson of the
late Hannibal Hamlin, Vice-President
of the United States during President
Lincoln's first administration, ap
peared in Judge Conlan's court yester
day morning to answer a charge of
nibal Hamlin, Vice-President
nited States during President
first administration, ap-
Judge Conlan's court yester
llng to answer a charge of
vagrancy.
Policeman Chase testified that he
arrested Hamlin Monday night near
Fourth and Townsend streets on the
complaint " of a restaurant keeper.
Hamlin had gone into the restaurant
j and ordered a porterhouse steak, two
eggs on the side, three cups of coffee
and a package of cigarettes. After
partaking of the meal he ran out of
the place, and the â¢ proprietor pursued
him, blowing his police whistle. Chase
heard the whistle and pursued and
captured Hamlin. ,He placed the
charge of vagrancy against him be
cause he had no money and had been
loafing around ' the Cafe Royal for
some time.
Prosecuting Attorney Mogan asked
Hamlin if he had anything to say in
his own defense. . He admitted eating
the meal and not paying for it. In ex
planation he said: "I had not eaten
anything since Saturday, and, having
no money nor friends, I thought it bet- .
ter to do that than disgrace the name
I bear by stealing." He startled the |
court by announcing that he was the !
grandson of the late Vice-President, j
and in corroboration thereof handed j
the prosecuting attorney an envelope
bearing the signs of age, and Inside
was the following note: â¢ â¢ "

He also showed letters of recommen
dation from Thacker Brothers of Sac
ramento, for whom he worked as book-
I keeper in 1894, and from the B. and H.
Abstract Company of Seattle, by
whom he was employed from 1889 to
1891. About four years ago he had a
I stroke of paralysis, which affected his
right arm, and since then he had been
dependent for support upon his uncle,
Frank Hamlin, first assistant corpora
tion counsel in Chicago. He came here
from Seattle abc-ut six weeks ago, hav
ing been prevented from going to the
Klondike by lack of funds.
The Judge, after listening to his
story, said he could not be a party to
dishonoring the name of Hamlin, and
dismissed the case. He advised Ham
lin to procure a situation of some
kind, and Hamlin said he had been
unsuccessfully trying ever since he had
been here.
Hamlin is about 35 years of age, and
is a manly looking fellow. He said he
left Maine in the latter part of ISBB and
went to Seattle, where he secured em
ployment with the B. and H. Abstract
Company. U e remained there till 1891,
when he heard of his- grandfather's
death, who he says was the best friend
he had in the world. He went to Ban
gor and received a legacy which his
grandfather had left him, but he soon
went through it. Since then he had
been in Dakota and Chicago, and he
came here during the Midwinter Fair,
where he had charge of an exhibit.
While in Sacramento, before being
stricken with paralysis, he was em

SAX JOPE, March B.â Thomas W.
Flannelly. murderer of his father and j
slayer of Sheriff MoEvoy, went on the j
witness stand this afternoon in his own |
behalf. He made a good witness. At j
one time the witness choked and i
seemed about to cry, but he soon re- j
gained his composure and went on with j
his story. Flannelly's story of his j
crime tended to bolster up his claim of i
self-defense. He said his father was j
attempting to get a pistol out from un- j
der his pillow when he (Flannelly) j
1 lire and killed him.
At the opening of court this morning

murder occurred.
Edwin Thompson and Joe Getzman
were present at the arrest of Flan
nelly and told of the tight at the dairy
h, when the prosecution rested.
The case of the defense opened by
the reading of testimony taken at the
- inquest. This was admitted,
it was stated, to lay the foundation for
the Impeachment of witnesses John
X- rr and Sheriff Mansfield.
B. A. Hankin. Daniel Mullen, Hiram
Ebrlght, Claude U'ox and J. F. Greere
:.^d that prior to the homicide de
bit's reputation for peace and
Quietude had been good. Judge Lori
gan limited witnesses on this line to
five, and Attorney Straus took excep
tii n to the ruling.
Defendant Thomas Flannelly then
took the stand. He described the
shooting in a clear voice and without a
waver in his tone, even when the mi
nutest details were inquired into. He
showed great emotion when telling of
the killing, but he quickly recovered
himself and went on with his story.
Flannelly said he was born in San
Francisco and was 31 years old. He
first went into the dairy business at
Fair Oaks in 1592. On September 14,
1897, he took Daniel H. Doyle into part
nership, which firm existed for sixteen
days. The co-partnership document
was read and admitted as evidence. In
regard to the dissolution of the part
nership he said:
"Father wrote me a letter saying
that I would have to get off the place,
and Doyle too. My father said in a
conversation afterward that my part
ner was no good, that his father and
the whole family were no good and he
wanted me to get rid of him. I told
father I would get rid of Doyle as soon
as 1 could get any one else to do the
work, as it was too hard for me alone.
One niKht father threatened my life.
It was when I was delivering some
milk in my father's house. He asked
me if I had got rid of Doyle yet. I told
him that Doyle was not my partner
any more, and I would get rid of him
as soon as I could get some one else to
help me at the dairy. Father then
called me a liar and a thief. He said
a was cheating the customers and
Everybody else that I had anything tc
do with. I replied, 'Don't say that,
father.' My father would not listen to
me, but said, 'I will blow your head
off.' He then made a move toward a
lifle that was standing in one corner of
the kitchen. I made a warning move
toward him and told him not to touch
that rifle or he would have to use it,
as I was armed, too. Father then said,
'Well, I'll fix you, anyhow,' and he
went out of the house to the woodshed.
When I went out and got on my wagon
I saw him peeking out of a crack in
the woodshed at me.
"Th^ first notice we received from
father was to pay $25 a month rent or
move away from the dairy. When the
second notice came for us to move out
my partnership with Doyle had been
dissolved, and father knew it. I had
Bent word to him to that effect and
told him so repeatedly. I almost al
ways carried a pistol, either in my
pocket or on the milk wagon. I never
ssaw the pistol that father had, but I
knew he had one, as John Kerr told
me that he gave him one. The door
to father's room was open that night.
I lit a candle in mother's room and
went in and placed the lighted candle
on the stand at the head of father's
bed. I then asked him why he had
had more papers served on me and
Doyle. I told him again that I had no
partner, and he replied: 'You are a
liar; I wish you were dead and in
hell. You are drunk and a thief and
are no good to yourself or any one
else ' He then reached under his pil
low when I said: 'Don't draw a gun
on me, or I will fire, too, for I am
armed.'
"I tried to argue with father again,
but he would not have it. He threw
back some of the bedclothes and be
gan reaching under the pillow. Then
I fired three shots. Ido not know
where any of the shots struck. It was
the second time my father had threat
ened my life. I never had any trouble
with him before this quarrel. I was
not intoxicated that night.
"After the shooting I came out of the
room and saw my mother at the door.
She asked me if I had shot father, and
I told her yes, that I had to do so. She
wanted me to come into the room with
her, as she was afraid of father. I told
her there was no dajiger, as father was
dead. I thought he must be dead, as I
am a good shot. I have often practiced
at targets. Father was a good shot.
He could shoot best with the left hand.
About a year before the shooting he
came out to the ranch and used my
pistol in practicing at a target. When
my father first reached his hand around
under the pillow that night I stepped
toward him and touched him on the
Shoulder with my left hand. I told him
to look out, as I was armed, too. I
took my pistol out and showed it to
father Then I put It back in my pocket
and tried to argue with him, but father
continued to threaten my life."
The defendant was then asked: Did
you think your life was In danger after
father made that first movement?"
"I did, sir."
"Why did you not leave the room,
then?"
"I was afraid that if I turned around
to go out I would leave myself open to
be shot."
The witness denied that he held his
pistol within a foot of his father's head
at any of the shots so as to powder
burn the flesh.
i The defense then rested, and court
adjourned until to-morrow morning,
when argument in the case will begin.

TAKES A WIFE
Vliss Helen C. Curtis of
This City the Happy-
Bride.
Ceremony Performed in a Pic

Barbara.
Pouch, of Romance to the Brilliant
Event â The Wedding Breakfast
and Presents.
Special DUpatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, March B.â At
high noon to-day, at the residence of
Mrs. Edgerton Hart, Miss Helen Carle
ton Curtis and Thomas Magee, both of
San Francisco, were united In mar
riage, Rev. A. H. Carrier of the Pres
byterian Church officiating.
Punctually at 12 o'clock the bridal
procession formed and wended its way
from the residence proper through a
magnificent avenue of grand eucalyp
tus trees to a quaint, picturesque, old
adobe building. A carpet of canvas
was laid the entire distance. As the
procession ascended the steps the sweet
tones of Greig's "Bridal March" fell
upon the ear. Beneath a canopy of
smilax and the blossoms of the orange
and peach trees were said the words
that made Miss Curtis and Mr. Magee
one.
The bride looked strikingly hand
some in a robe of white satin and a
tulle veil flowing to the floor. The j
bridesmaids. Miss Hart of Santa Bar
bara and Miss Ladd of San Francisco,
were attired in white. Miss O'Sulllvan
of San Francisco was maid of honor,
and little Miss Helen M. Cowles was
train-bearer.
After the wedding a breakfast was
served, the table being beautifully ar
ranged with rare exotics. While the
bridal party enjoyed the viands the
Spanish orchestra rendered a number !
of fine old Castilian airs appropriate |
to the occasion. The room in which the j
ceremony took place was tastily decor- j
ated with vines and flowers. The scene
of this happy incident is one of the
oldest landmarks in Santa Barbara
and one of the most picturesque spots
of this place. In the days of the Dons
it doubtless was the scene of merri
ment and love-making.
The bride is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. James Marvin Curtis of San
Francisco. The groom is one of the
leading citizens of the same city. The
wedding took place here owing to a
desire of Mr. Oliver, an old girlhood
friend of Miss Curtis, to be nresent at
her marriage whenever it might occur,
and as she promised him he should at
tend and as he was too ill to go to San
Francisco the ceremony was performed
in Santa Barbara.
The guests were Mr. and Mrs. James
i Marvin Curtis, Mrs. Edgerton Hart,
j Miss McCurdy, Mrs. Dr. Doremus. Miss
. Doremus. Mr. and Mrs. Q. P. J. Oliver,
Mr and Mrs. Edwin Bradbury, Mrs.
L J Harrison. Miss Gail Harrison.
Mrs. Herzfeldt of Berlin and Mr. and
Mrs. Paul Cowles.
The bridal couple were the recipients
of many presents from friends in San
Francisco and in Europe. During the
wedding breakfast a number of con
gratulatory telegrams and cablegrams
were read. }
This afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
Magee left for an extended tour of
Southern California, after which they
will return to San Francisco to reside
on Broadway, between Devisadero and
Broderick streets, overlooking the bay.
WANT FREIGHT
RATES REDUCED
Complaint of Citrus Fruit
Packers, Shippers and
Growers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX DIEGO. March 8. -The San Diego
County Packers' and Shippers' Associa
tion, comprising the leading fruit ship
pers and growers of the county, have
written to Agent Stuart of the Southern
California Railway asking for a reduction
of the citrus fruit freight rates to the
East. This action Is taken in consequence
of the charges that the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific are In a pool whereby
the rates on citrus fruits are kept at a
ruinously high fipure. The Shippers' and
Packers' Association says:
"Southern California has at least 3000
carloads of seedlings still on the trees.
Unless the market Improves or the rail
roads come to the rescue half of this frutl
will never be shipped. Figure the loss to
the railroads, to the growers, packers and
shippers. At the low price of $1 50 per box
delivered the loss would be $756,000. Will
the railroad* see this fruit rot and the
leading industry of Southern California
damaged to such an extent?
â¢â Since the tariff law went into effect
Atlantic Ocean rates on imported citrus
fruits have been reduced one-third. Dur
ing this same time railroad freight rates
from New York to Chicago, for Instance,
have been reduced on the quiet by means
of rebates and otherwise one-fourth. To
p-ether this means 25 cents per box advan
tage to the foreign growers. Thus, what
we gained by the tariff Is largely nulll
t\e<\ If the transportation lines of the
Eastern States and the Atlantic Ocean
can thus aesist the growers, Isn't it right
and Just that we ask our Western lines
to help us? For ten years now the citrus
fruit rate to Mississippi Valley common
points has remained the same. During
that time the Belling price of our com
modities has been cut in two. The traffic
at one time could stand the rate. Under
present conditions that rate has become
excessive and the business can no longer
stand it."

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1898.
TO ALLAY ALL
APPREHENSIONS
Official Statement on the
Site for the Federal
Building.
On One Corner of the Site
Foundation Will Have to
Be Sunk Deeper.
Defects Revealed by the Special Ex
amination of General Smith
of Chicago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, March 8.
The Treasury Department, after j
considering the report of Civil Engl- |
neer General Sooy Smith of Chicago |
for two weeks, finally gave out a care
fully worded statement this afternoon â 
calculated to allay any apprehensions
that the people of San Francisco may
have concerning the foundation for
the new Postoffice building. The mea
ger statement given to the press con
tains little if any information beyond
that already telegraphed to The Call.
In fact, there is a very evident desire
on the part of the Treasury Depart
ment to give out as little information
as possible.
They claim that the examination
made by the engineer disclosed noth
ing of very great importance. But
j from the fact that those engaged in
making the excavations discovered a
soft place near the corner of Seventh
and Mission streets, and from the fur
ther fact that the department, instead
of sending one of its agents to make
the examination, employed a private
civil engineer, showed that they were
apprehensive about the character of
| the foundation. There has, too, been
I a deal of mystery surrounding the con
i sideration of Smith's report.
Day after day the correspondents of
j San Francisco papers have visited the
department for information, but not a
hint was given them. The officials con
sidered the matter of sufficient import
ance to bring General Smith here from
Chicago, and he had an interview with
Assistant Secretary at the Treasury
Spalding, Supervising Architect Tay
j lor and Chief Executive Officer Kem
per, and, as stated in the dispatches to
The Call last night, General Smith ex
pressed the opinion that a much bet
| ter site could have been selected, and
1 that the foundation plans near the cor
| ncr of Seventh and Mission streets
j would have to be changed because of
j the infirm character of the ground at
that point. The brief typewritten
statement given out at the Treasury
to-day is as follows:
"Owing to the general belief that
treacherous sands underlie the site for
the new Federal building, and to the
fact that soft strata were encountered
in excavating near the corner of Sev
enth and Mission streets, the Super
vising Architect of the Treasury De
partment decided to have a thorough
examination of the site made by a
civil engineer of national reputation.
Far this purpose there were secured
the services of General William Sooy
Smith, who proceeded to San Fran
cisco and made a careful investigation
by sinking twenty additional borings,
most of which were near the corner of
Seventh and Mission streets. The de
sign for the foundation as it appeared
in the office of the supervising archi
tect was also submitted for General
Sooy Smith's consideration, and was
pronounced by him to be the best that
could be adopted. General Smith, how
ever, concurred with the engineer of
the supervising architect's office in the
latter's recommendation that founda
tions near the corner of Seventh and
Mission streets be carried to a deeper
level than originally intended, thus
penetrating the yielding strata until a
satisfactory bed is reached."

San Mateo County's Sheriff Is

Bpeds] Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March B.â Sheriff Mansfield
of San Mateo County did not like the ex
pose of the questionable methods adopted
by himself and brother, C. T. Mansfield,
to obtain a reward for the arrest of Fred
Winters, as published In The Call this
morning, and consequently was in an
ugly mood to-day.
About 11 o'clock Lk Seidenberg, a spe
cial correspondent of The Call, met Sher
iff BC&nsfleld, who is In attendance at the
Flannelly trial, in the Sheriffs office and
asked him If he desired to make any ex
planation in regard to the charges made
in the article. Mansfield called Seiden
berj? a vile name in reply. Seidenberg re
taliated by saying the statements made
were the truth and called Mansfield a
thief.
Mansfield made a rush at Seidenberg,
and the newspaper man landed his right
fist In good shape on the officer's nose.
The skin was knocked off and Mans
fleld'a Mood was spilled over the carpet
ami his clothes. The men then clinched,
and Seidenberg was In the act of admin
istering a number of short-arm blows In

Canadian Pacific Will Ex

City.
Carries the War of the Rail

Pacific Ocean.
Steps to Be Taken by the Western
Passenger Association to Meet
the Foreign Competitor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 8. â The Canadian
Pacific has announced that it will take
its reduced rates into San Francisco.
It declares that from that city to the
East it will make the following rates:
St. Paul, $25; Chicago, $36 50; New
York, $40.
These rates are first-class and the
second class rates will be in each in
stance $10 lower than the rates given
above. In making these rates the
Canadian Pacific will have to connect
itself with the ocean route from San
Francisco to the western terminus of
its line.
The Southern Pacific will not allow it
the use of its Shasta route, and the
ocean route is all that is left for it.
At the present time there is a fight be
tween the steamship companies and
the Southern Pacific which has pulled
down the rates between San Francisco
and Portland to $5 net. The Canadian
Pacific has taken advantage of this
and has decided to carry the fight into
the chief points of the Pacific Coast
that are within its reach.
A call was to-day issued by the
chairman of the Western Passenger
Association for a meeting of the gen
eral passenger agents of the organiza
tion to be held to-morrow, fo-.the pur
pose of considering the latest phase of
the fight with the Canadian Pacific.
At the meeting the propriety of ask
ing the Northern Pacific and the Great
Northern either to abolish the rate
system of sellling tickets to points on
the Northern Pacific coast or to cease
all interchange of busniess with the
Canadian Pacific and the Soo line and
to route all of their business via Chi
cago will be discussed.

VALLEY ROAD MAIL SERVICE.
A Closed Pouch for Each of tue
Principal Stations.
STOCKTON, March B.â The people of
the lower San Joaquin Valley will here
after have an improved mail service. The
Valley road by the 7:30 train yesterday
morning took out the first pouches and
they were delivered at the various Post
offices sooner than the mail has hereto
fore left the Stockton office.
The principal points touched by this new
service are Fresno, Hanford. Visalia, Col
legeville, Atlanta, Burwood and Merced.
The service is what is known as the
closed pouch delivery, the bags being
handled at present by the Wefis-Fargo
messengers, but it is understood that as
soon as another division is opened the
Postoffice Department will allow a postal
clerk.
The 7 o'clock morning train of the
Southern Pacific Company does not carry
mail, and it accordingly has not left here
until the noon train south. The valley
mail will also arrive here at 5:40 p. m.
instead of 8:16 by the Southern Pacific

Kidney and Uric Acid Troubles Quickly Cured.
You May Have a Sample Bottle of the Great Discovery,
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, Sent Free by Mail.
Men and women doctor their troubles
so often without benefit that they get
discouraged and skeptical. In most
such cases serious mistakes are made
in doctoring and in not knowing what
our trouble is or what makes us sick.
The unmistakable evidences of kidney
trouble are pain or dull ache in the
back, too frequent desire to pass water,
scanty supply, smarting irritation. As
kidney disease advances the face looks
sallow or pale, puffs or dark circles
under the eyes, the feet swell and
sometimes the heart acts badly. Should
further evidence be needed to find out
the cause of sickness, then se* urine
aside for twenty-four hours; if there
is a sediment or settling it is also con-
vincing proof that our kidneys and
bladder need doctoring. A fact often
overlooked is that women suffer as
much from kidney and bladder trouble
as men do.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root is the dis-
covery of the eminent physician and
scientist and is not recommended for
everything, but will be found just what
is needed in cases of kidney and blad-

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" , usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In the Interior .and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these : conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
â¢ NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March B.â The tona of the
â tock market was much Improved to-day, as
compared with that of yesterday, the ground
for the greater confidence In values being the
apparent desire of the Spanish Government
to deprecate any Idea that they desire a rup
ture with the United States on their own In
itiative, or they sought to Irritate the United
States Government into assuming the offen
sive. The effect of this was clearly
defined In a sharp recovery in price of Spanish
fours, both in London and Paris. Americans
also were much steadier on the foreign ex
changes, but there Â»as nothing in the early
quotations from there to give a foretaste of
the sharp advances at the opening here. The
market was quite aggressively strong during
the whole of the earlier part of the day, but It
Is questionable whether this was due to any
large amount of buying for new accounts.
That the short Interest was largely Increased
yesterday was eusily to bo seen, and shrewd
professional manipulators were able to dis
cern that the market waa in an oversold con
dition. The better outloook In the relations be
tween Spain and the United States made the
shorts nervous, and there was something of
a scramble to cover at the opening. The man
ipulation for the rise was designed
to uncover bear margins. and the
keen demand at the advance proved the
maneuver to have been successful. It did
not require a very large advance to invite fur
ther liquidation, and the last hour saw prices
fall almost to last night's point. Covering by
belated shorts caused a slight stiffening again
in the final dealings. Outside of the profes
sional manipulation there was little doing in
the market. Some buying was reported for
London and Washington account. The con
tinued movement of cold. the easier tone of
money, yesterday's flurry being apparently
ended, a number of dividend announcements
and the statement that no bonds would be
made necessary by the proposed appropriation
of $60,000,000 for national defense were all fac
tors toward the more confident views of the
situation. Operations, nevertheless, were pur
sued with caution, and a disposition was ap
parent to adopt a waiting policy. Net gains,
except In a few of the specialties, were con
fined to fractions. The price of Northwestern
railway stocks were rather conspicuously
â trong In spite of the continuance of the trans
contnental rate war.
Bonds showed strength in sympathy with
stocks, but resisted the late weakness" In the
market, except Kansas Pacific consols, which
lost all of the earlier advance amounting to
nearly two points. Total sales, $3,430,000
L'nlted States fours registered were % lower,

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March B.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram Bays:
The markets opened steady to-day on the
closing of the Consul-General Lee incident, but
soon gave way on further heavy forced liqui
dation, prior to the settlement, and on the
news of the Queen's slight indisposition. Con
sols at one time were quoted at 110%. There
was a general recovery at the close, led by
American support from New York. The differ
ences to be met at the settlements are very
heavy, however, and occasion anxiety. Mining
contangoos to-day were the same as at the last
settlement. There Is a small account, but the
tone of the market Is flat. There was good
buying of Americans this afternoon.
I am told in the best quarters that the issue
of the Chinese loan will not be delayed, bar
ring seriously political developments which are
not expected. It will probably be issued on
Saturday or early next week.
To-day's saUs of eagles by the Bank of Eng
land surprised the money market, which was
very firm. The ban raised the buying price of
French and German coin to 76s 6d.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. March B.â A well-defined bullish
sentiment was apparent at the opening in
â  Wheat. There was a drop in English consols,
i reflecting the apprehension of trouble between
! England and Russia, and Liverpool showed a
I substantial advance and reported that receipts
i of Wheat during the last three days had been
â  considerably below requirements. There was
; seemingly less prospect of trouble between the
| United States and Spain. Plenty of bearish
â¢ statistical news waa at hand, but the crowd
â  was too bullish on the European situation to
pay any attention to this at first. With a good
; demand from shorts, July opened Vie higher at
j 90% c and advanced at once to 80% c. May
i opened Vi<ST%c higher at $1 05V4Â®1 05V4. The lat
! ter delivery, however, has almost failed to cx
i cite Interest. At 90% c for July offerings be
' came heavier, that being "call" price. There
was free selling against these privileges and
also a good deal of scattered realizing. This
i resulted in a gradual decline in July to 90% c.
A long period of dullness followed, with
! prices keeping within an exceptionally narrow
: range.
About the only Incident was the support
â  given May by Lelter brokers at $1 04, to which
I figure that delivery had declined. This buying
I prevented the market from getting below that
figure. Around the noon hour the market be
gan to show strength again. Bad reports as to
| the crop conditions In Missouri and Illinois
| carrie In. Buying of July by a house which has
â¢ been a heavy seller lateiy became quite pro
' nounced, and as Lelter brokers were at the
j same time supporting May and September,
prices slowly recovered. The advance also re
i tulted in a considerable broadening of the
j trade, as shorts came into the market to pro
tect themselves. Predictions of a cold wave to
follow rain was Ignored early, but brought In
j some outside orders late In the session. July
advanced to JlVfc'gOlVic and left off at 91c. May
closed at $1 04% and September at SO^jc.
The feetlnc in Corn w&b quite steady all

CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUITS.
NEW YORK, March The Journal of Com
merce says: There has been an unsettled feel
[ ing in spot market for prunes for several days
| owing, it Is reported, to Influences exerted by
I speculative operators. . Offerings of considera
ble quantities of sizes most wanted have been
made here within the past day or two by Chi
cago parties. It Is understood, at prices con
siderably below figures which local holders
are disposed to accept. Rumors current to-day
are to the effect that Chicago operators with
an ambition to corner the market, or at least
largely augment their supplies, having by
their purchase on the coast caused stronger
feeling and an upward tendency of prices
there, had come to New York with the Inten
tion of securing additional stocks here, and to
that end started out to further depress this
market by offering to shade spot quotations.
They were attracted to New York in the first
instance,. It Is said, by reason that this mar
ket for a long time past has been below pari
ty with California prices. All this, however,
is only market gossip, and no one seems ready
to confirm it. At the same time there has been
no positive denial of settling rumors so far as
we have been able to ascertain. If Chicago
operators have been trying to depress this
market with a view to picking up some bar
gains It would appear that they have had
their labor for their pains. Stock here, we
understand. Is concentrated \A . a few hands,
and holders, finding steady, ' fair demand for
both home consumers and export buyers, do
not feel at all disturbed regarding the future,
particularly as the most desirable sizes are re
ported to be getting into small compass both
here and on the coast, and telegraphic ad
vices from California Indicate a decidedly
stronger feeling among holders there.

It is estimated that twenty-two acres
of land is necessary to sustain one man
on fresh meat. The same space of land
if devoted to wheat culture would feed
forty-two people; if to oats, 88; pota
toes, Indian corn and rice, 176, and if
to the plantain or bread fruit tree, over
6000 people.

KESSLER'S NOTE
WAS A LOAN
Harry Thomas Denies It
Was Given as a
Bribe.
The Mayor Explains a Story
That Is Being Freely
Told.
One Hundred Dollars That Was Bor
rowed Was Promptly
Paid.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 8.
For several weeks Constable John
Kessler has been exhibiting a photo
graph of a note for $100, which bears
the signatures of Mayor Thomas and
his son, Harry, the secretary of the
Board of Works. Kessler has fre
quently stated that he received the note
in return for money paid to Harry
Thomas on the assurance that he
(Kessler) should have all Thomas' in
fluence to secure a position on the po
lice force when the new men were ap
pointed about two months ago.
The day after the men were ap
pointed and Kessler saw that his name
was not among them, he went to the
Mayor's office, demanded his money and
got it. Before returning the note, how
ever, Kessler had it photographed and
he has shown the picture to scores of
people as evidence that he had a finan
cial transaction with the Mayor. The
note is dated July 17 and is payable
after sixty days. It was not paid,
however, until more than five months
had elapsed. Kessler says he has
been told that he is to go before the
Grand Jury and he will tell all he
knows.
The story has been made so public
that Mayor ThomaÃ was asked to-day
by a Call reporter to give his explana
tion of the Incident, which he readily
consented to do.
"Some time ago," said the Mayor,
"Harry told me he wanted to borrow
a. hundred dollars and asked me if I
â¢would sign a note with him. I said
I would if he was fixed so as to take
care of it. He told me it was all right
and I signed it, but I did not know
then what name was on it. I have
learned since that it was in favor of
John Kesslor.
"This is what I know about Kessler.
I have known him for many years, and
he is a strong, able fellow, and would,
1 think, make a good officer. I told him
I would do all I could for him, and when
I received the list of eligibles from
Chief Lloyd I did not see Kessler's name
among them, so I wrote it in myself
and proposed his name, but neither of
the other two Commissioners would
vote with me, and I could not secure
him one of the places. The morning
after the men were appointed Kessler
came into my office and demanded pay
ment of a note. I told him I did not
owe him anything on a note, and then
he showed me a note that was signed
by myself and Harry for $100. I re
ferred him to Harry, and the money
was" paid. That is all. If Kessler in
sinuates that I attempted to get any
thing from him he lies. I did all I
could for him out of friendship."
Karry Thomas was very willing to
discuss the matter. "I admit that I
borrowed $100 of Kessler last July, and
I have paid it back," he said. "Kessler
Is a money-lender, and I wanted a loan
and went to him for it. I told him I
would do anything I could for him to
help him to get on the police force, and
I did ask my father to vote for him.
This has nothing at all to do with the
loan. These stories are all false. I was
asked about this matter by the Dis
trict Attorney and told him how it oc
curred. I know Kessler had the note
photographed, but he need not have
done that, for if he wanted any one to
gee the original I would gladly show it.
It is surely no disgrace to borrow a lit
tle money and pay It back. I am quite
willing to tell the Grand Jury all I
know about it."
John Kessler told a Call reporter last
night that in addition to the note he
has a letter from Harry Thomas that
throws considerable light on the trans
action. Harry Thomas says he wrote
to Kessler thanking him for so kindly
obliging him with the loan.
A SPEEDY TBIAL.
No Time Lost in Convicting a Cow-
ardly Murderer.
OAKLAND, March B.â Prosecuting
Attorney Harry A. Melvin made a rec
ord this afternoon that is probably
without a parallel in the State. With
in five hours of open court Eulalio
Gonzales was tried for murder and his
case given to the jury. Three hours
later the jury returned a verdict of
murder In the second degree.
Gonzales saw Antone Silva walking
with a young woman near Pleasanton
last November. He became jealous,
and from an ambush he jumped on
Silva and beat him to death with a
club.
At 10:30 this morning the case was
transferred from Department 4 to De
partment 1. A Jury was obtained and
an adjournment taken to 1:45 p. m.
The trial continued till 5:05, when the
case was given to the Jury- At 8
o'clock to-night a verdict was returned.
D. M. Conner of Pleasanton repre
sented the murderer.
Nothing But the Best.
OAKLAND, March B.â At the regular
meeting of the Board of Education last
evening the following section was added
to the rules and regulations of the High
School: "For positions in the High School
only those teachers shall be eligible who
hold high school certificates, and are
graduates of the State University or some
college or university of equal rank. The
provision of this section shall not apply
to those persons .vho are now or havo
heretofore been regular teachers in the
Oakland High Scheoi." The rule affecting
teachers in the other schools was made
to read that persons desiring to teach in
any grammar, primary or evening school
"must hold a grammar grade or high
school certificate and must have had at
least two years' experience in teaching,
or must be a graduate of one of the Cali
fornia State Normal Schools or of some
other State normal school of equal rank,
or must have taken a full pedagogical
course in the State University or some
other college or university of equal rank,
or must be a graduate of the San Fran
cisco Normal School of date prior to July
1, 1598." , â

HENNEBERRY
IS A SURPRISE
Had Documents Ready
to Meet Every
Emergency.
Water Rates Have Yet to Go
Through Several
Stages.
The Courts Will Probably Have to
Determine Their FatÂ©
Finally.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 8.
There seems to be but little hope that
â  the water rate payers will be s nle to
prevent being robbed for the next year
commencing on July 1. The tactics
followed by the solid six have been
carefully thought out by the attorneys
for the corporations, and it is believed
that even if the Mayor's veto shall be
held to be valid, the resolution handed
;in by Mr. Henneberry will stand. In
both ordinance and resolution the rates
! are the same â nearly double what is
' being paid at present.
The Mayor's veto will come up for
discussion at the next regular mating
: and the solid six will probably pass
Mr. Henneberry's resolution that he i
handed in last night, and wnlch pro- j
vides for completely Ignoring the May
er's message. It even declares that :
, it shall not be spread upon the min
utes or be noticed in any manner. It
will, of course, be impossible to securo j
the necessary eierht votes to pass the
ordinance over the veto.
The resolution was declared by City j
Attorney Dow to be invalid, but it is i
likely that the matter will be formally
referred to him for an opinion, as also
the point raised by Henneberry that.
according to the constitution of the
State, the Mayor has no authority to j
touch the water rate matter. Mr. Hen
neberry's ready-prepared resolutions 'â 
and ordinance, which he produces very |
dramatically from his pocket whenever '
an emergency arises, have caused much
surprise. Everybody wonders where he
got them, and who prepared them.
It is claimed by many attorneys that j
his legal point regarding the proposi- '
tion of a veto over a water rate ordi- i
nance is not well taken. The. consti
tution provides Oakland, or any other
city, with the power to make a char- ;
ter, and the charter of this city pro- j
vides for the fixing of water rates by
either resolution or ordinance. If by i
ordinance, it is held that It must go
the route of all ordinances, as provided i
by the charter, and go to the Mayor for j
his signature or veto.
There is little doubt but what the :
matter will be the subject of litigation !
before it is finally determined.
ESTATE OF
INCOMPETENTS
An Important Test Suit Is Filed
in Alameda County's
Courts.
One Day More Jacob Roth's Money
Would Have Passed Out of
His Control.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 8.
A suit was filed late this afternoon
in the Superior Court that will test
the right of people to obtain letters of
administration on the estates of de
ceased or insane persons to whom
they are not related and whom they do
not, in many instances, know.
Jacob Roth is an inmate of the Napa
State Hospital and a year ago it. came
to the knowledge of J. B. Feehan of
San Francisco that he had 51100 on de
posit In the German Savings and Loan
Society. Feehan came to Alameda
County and applied for letters of ad
ministration on Roth's estate. This
was a year ago and the time expires
to-morrow.
Attorney G. C. de Gnlia, acting for
the State, with the consent of the At
torney-General, has brought the suit
In the name of Dr. A. M. Gardner, su
perintendent of the Xapa State Hospi
tal, who Is the legal guardian of Jacob
Roth. Feehan had no authority to act
for Roth and got letters without the
knowledge of any one of his family,
and it is alleged is about to settle the
The suit Is brought to compel Feehan
to return any money he may have col

Stamp Ordinance Killed.
\KLAND, March B.â Judge Allen of
Police Court dismissed the merchants
under arrest for Riving away trading
stamps to-day and handed down a
lengthy decision, as was said he would in
Sunday's Call. In his decision he says:
"Where a power is reposed in a muni
cipal body it has the right to exercise
that power to its fullest extent. If the
Council has the right to say that gifts
shall not be made under certain condi
tions it has the right to prohibit them.
This would be virtually holding that it
1 may repeal the sections of the Civil Code
' which make gifts lawful. The exercise of
the authority attempted in this ordinance
would be 'n conflict with the general law.
The ordinance would be void for this rea
son alone. If for no other. It is an un
warranted interference with personal lib
erty and property rights, and was so held
by the Supreme Court of the State of
New York/ 1

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 1808.
NO CHARM IN
ROYAL LINEAGE
Johnny Heinold Sorry
He Married a Lady
of Title.
Fourteen Years of Mixed Joy
and Misery Leads to the
Courts.
His Wire Prefers the Kitchen and
Its Life of Ease and
Freedom.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 8.
Fourteen years ago Christine Marie
Heinold was a domestic. She cast
aside life in the kitchen to become the
wife of John Heinold, who has con
ducted a saloon on the water front for
so long that he. is regarded as a fix
ture. Now the lady is once more a
domestic and the husband has pub
lished one of those suggestive notices
that refer to bed and board, desertion
and refusal to pay debts. The interval
between is described in a suit for di-
vorce filed this, morning.
In 1884 Heinold met the young wo
man who is now his wife. She was a
servant in a private family, but was
very much given to talking of her an
cestry and her high lineage in the coun
try of her birth. Heinold was as much
captivated by her claims to aristocracy
as by her personal charms, and they
were married. For five years all weni
well. Annually another ear was added
to the Heinold sheaf. The increased
duties, however, did not add to Mrs.
Heinold's enjoyment of life, and she is
alleged to have shown less than the or
dinary care for her children.
Two of the little ones died and Hein
old declares that had their conditions
been different they might probably
both be living at this time. As the
wife became reckless the husband grew
angry and more discontented. He did
not like the manner in which his fam
ily affairs were conducted, and he de
clares that things ?rew worse instead
of better, and finally Mr. Heinold
found more pleasure in the company
of other gentlemen than with his own
family.
Last December Mrs. Heinold decided
that to be a domestic with all its at
tendant freedom was preferable to be
ing the wife of a saloon-keeper with
three children. After relating all his
trouble Heinold asks for a divorce.
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY.
Water and Boodle Investigated by
the Alameda County Censors.
OAKLAND. March B.â The Grand Jury
issued a dozen or more subpenas this
evening, and it is stated that some are
for city officials who may know some
thing interesting and others are for the
officials of the water companies.
Councilman Woodward was the most
important witness to-day. He was before
the Grand Jury several hours and was
questioned on his appointment, his inter
est in wnter companies and on at! mat
ters connected with his acts since being
made a Councilman.
He said he had not been Influenced by
anything but his researches, and asserted
that no one had attempted to bribe him.
Mr. Hotchkiss, the accountant, of 664
Eleventh street, was called before the
Jury. Mr. Hotchkiss was examined by
District Attorney Snook. He was asked
If he had heard on the train or on the
ferries anything about boodle In regard
to a passage or proposed passage of the
water ordinance by the Council. He stat
ed that, of course, like almost every other
citizen, he had talked on the subject of
the alleged influence which had been
brought to bear on members of the Coun
cil in the water case, but that was all he
knew about it. He had no positive knowl
edg-e on the subject. He did not know
any member of the Council, but kn^w
Mayor Thomas, because the Mayor was
a neighbor of his.
W. H. Davis, secretary of the Capital
Loan Association, whose headquarters
are in San Francisco, was called In. Mr.
Davis resides at 1522 San Antonio avenue.
Alameda. Davis was confined with the
jury for about fifteen minutes. He was
submitted to a variety of questions from
nearly all the members, the principal one
of which was as to whether or not his
company, the Capital Loan Association,
had ever loaned money to W. J. Dingee
on realty or collateral of any kind. He
answered that his company had never
loaned money to Dingee on security of
any kind. Neither had the company
loaned money,- bo far as known, to any
relative, agent or employe of that gentle
man. Neither had it loaned money to any
present city official of Oakland.
Work of the AssesÂ»or.
OAKLAND, March B.â The Deputy As
i sessors are all in the field and are the
, same as did the work last year except
I those at Pleasanton and East Oakland,
i who hnve moved away. "The assessment
j rolls will not differ materially this year
â¢ from those of last year," said Assessoi
i Henry Dalton to-day. "The valuations
'have "been pretty thoroughly equalized
; during my term of office, and as values
j havo remained the same, there can be no
raise. My office work tells for itself and
I am willing to go before the public ask
; ing for re-election."
Bridge Plans Considered.
OAKLAND, March R.â The complaint of
Johnson & Peterson against the report of
the expert of the Board of Supervisors
was taken under advisement this morn-
Ing after considerable talking. Peterson
claims that the expert's figures misrepre
sented his firm. When the firm appeared
before the board to-day they desired the
expert to show wherein lay the inaccur
acy of the plans submitted. This the
board refused to do. asserting that Peter
son had made charges nnd should go
ahead and prove them.
Trial Progresses Slowly.
OAKLAND. March B.â Judge Ogden
took up the John McGinnis murder trial
to-day, which had partially been heard
by Judge Ellsworth before his Illness.
The prosecution examined JamÂ«?n Holmes,
who sold the revolver to Bryan, and W.
G. Little, who worked In the saloon at the
door of which Cronln was killed. The
cross-examination was lengthy and went
into every detail.
THE CITY TRUSTEES
I Refuse to Increase the Bate Paid by
the City for Water.
ALAMEDA, March B.â At a meeting of
I the City Trustees last night Superin
tendent Borden of the water company
appealed to the board to restore the rate
to be paid by the city for sprinkling and
flushing from 15 cents a thousand
gallons to 30 cents, as he sup
posed the Trustees had original
ly agreed upon. The board refused, how
ever, to make any change.
The treasurer was directed to transfer
$1000 from the general fund to the health
Bids for dcing the street sprinkling were
ordered to be called for, as were bids for
improving Santa Clara avenue from Ver
sailles avenue to High street. This is the
work which the fciast Oakland Paving
Company contracted to do and then re
fused to" perform its contract because of
some flaw found by its attorney.
The Grider Party.
ALAMEDA. March B.â Several days ago
some of the city paper 3 published re
ports from Victoria with regard to the
Grider party, which is en route to some
alleged goia diggings in the extreme
northwest. The idea was conveyed that
there was suspicion as to the authenticity
of the affair. Letters received from Ala
meda men wl.o are with the party state
that they are entirely satisfied with the
conduct of the expedition so far and have
great expectations with regard to the
outcome. No dissatisfaction of any kind
is expressed as to the head of the party
or his conduct.
DISPOSITION OF GARBAGE.
A Proposition to Do Away With the
Nuisance of the Dumps.
ALAMEDA. March B.â The matter of
the disposition of the garbage from this
city was brought up at a meeting of the
City Trustees last night. For some time
there has been complaint concerning the
dumps on Webster street, which nave
become a great nuisance to people who
are obliged to pass there on the electric
cars going to and from Oakland. These
dumps are a menace to health and an
eyesore, as well as giving off the vilest
and most disagreeable odors. Heaps of
decaying vegetation and refuse are al
lowed to lie there festering in the sun.
until it has become a nuisance of large
proportions. The National Sanitation
Company made a proposition to the board
last evening to enter into a contract to
pay the city for the privilege oi handling
the garbage, furnishing receptacles, etc..
and performing the whole duty after the
most approved sanitary fashion. The
matter was taken under advisement, and
it is probable that something of the kind
will be done in order to abate the present
nuisance.
Fire Department Report.
ALAMEDA, March B.â Chief Krauth of
the Fire Department presented his an
nual report at last night's meeting of the
Board of City Trustees. The report
showed that there had been 239 fires dur
ing the year, with a total loss of $98,072.
Two deaths were caused by fireâ James
H Ross of Cordes hose company, and
Isabel White, a 3-year-old child. Six
firemen also sustained injuries while In
active service during the year. The mem
bership of the department has fallen con
siderably owing to the enforcement of the
roll call ordinance adopted by the Trus
tees forfeiting: membership after three
failures to respond to a night alarm. The
flre nouses and apparatus were reported
in good condition, and the purchase of
additional hose and minor appliances was
recommended.
Another Dog Suit.
ALAMEDA, March B.â Dr. Ambrose
Sander of Oakland has brought suit
against J. H. Rosseter, the well-known
dog fancier, for $169 alleged to be due him
for the board and keep of a number of
dogs belonging to defendant. Another
suit brought some time ago by Sander
against Rosseter for board and medical
attendance for his dogs was dismissed.
Now the amount has been reduced and
the claim is made for board alone.

PUSSY CAT IS
A WILD ANIMAL.
Such Is the Decision of Judge
Campbell in the Case of
Charles Bone.
A Warrant Is Now Out for the Arrest
of Bone Charging Him With
a Felony.
Judge Campbell has made a record for j
himself by declaring that a cat is not a j
domestic animal and cannot therefore be
claimed as the property of any one. In i
other words a cat, according to the whis- i
kered jurist, is a wild animal like a bear i
or a tiger, which will be a surprise to ',
many a housewife who loves her cat.
The decision was rendered in the case
I of Charles Bone. 1610 Steiner street, who
was charged with poisoning a, Maltese cat,
the property of his neighbor, J. C. Fred
ericks. The poisoning of the cat was not
denied, as Bone argued that it was a
nuisance by tearing up his shrubs and
annoying the neighborhood by its yowls
during the hours of the night, but the de
fense was put in that according to law the
cat was a wild animal and therefore did
not belong to Fredericks and the Judge
took that view of the case and dismissed
Yesterday Fredericks, who owns several
voidable dogs and cats, and is afraid that
they might all now be poisoned, swore to
a complaint in Judge Joaehimsen's court
for the arrest of Bone on a charge of
having placed poisonous matter with in
tent to destroy animals. This is a felony
and the bonds were fixed at $1000.

Building Record for Feb

Sellers Not Now So Eager to
Dispose of Properly as
Formerly.
Claxis Spreckels Purchases Country
Lands â The Records, Auctions,
Sates and Notes.
The situation in the realty line is lit
tle changed. If anything sellers are
not so eager to dispose of property as
a few months ago, but dealers report
the difficulty of getting buyer and sel
ler together as having but slightly de
creased. According to Magee's Real
Estate Circular the total sales of last
month were only 215, aggregating the
sum of $704,007.
In building the prospects seem to
grow brighter. The record for last

The Rancho Tequlsquito. near Gilroy, a
part of the Miller & Lux estate, has been
purchased by Claus Spreckels through A.
S. McDonald of Oakland. The transfer
is one of the largest made in California
for years, as the property consists of
10.000 acres. From what has been said
by others it is believed Mr. Spreckels
will devote the land he has bought to the
culture of sugar beets. Both parties to
the transaction refuse to reveal the pur
chase price.

Will Help Along the Cause
in a Most Practical
Way.
Proceeds of the First Game of
the California League De
voted to Patriotism.
Important Meeting of the New
Organization Held Yesterday
Afternoon.
The first money to be set apart for
the purpose of having a semi-centen
nial exposition to celebrate the golden
wedding of the State of California will
come from the baseball field, and will
be the result of the first game played
in this city by the new California Base
ball League, which has been organized
under National League rules.
This was decided by the Recreation
Park Association managers at their
meeting yesterday afternoon, and it is
expected that the enthusiasm will
spread to all the clubs In the league
and that the fund thus raised will make
a handsome nucleus for the big fund
which is to make the exposition a suc
cess.
There was a full representation of the
new clubs present at the meeting, and
the movement met with unanimous
favor.
At a meeting of the California Base
ball League at the Baldwin Hotel yes
terday organization was perfected by
the granting of franchises to the San
Francisco League Club. Oakland Base
ball Club, Stockton Baseball Club, San
Jose Baseball Club, Sacramento Base
ball Club and Fresno Baseball Club.

ahoo; Sacramento, N. O'Neill; Presi
dent H. H. McPike and Secretary C. E.
Wiggin.

by the league a resolution was passed
ratifying the action of President Me-
Pike In securing the national agree- ;
ment protection, and a letter was read i
from N. E. Young, acknowledging the !
receipt of $180 covering the protection. ;
This places the league under the juris- !
diction of the national board of arbi- i
tration, it being the first time any Call- I
fornia aggregation has secured this !
privilege.
A resolution was passed adopting the I
Spalding National League ball and the !
president was empowered to appoint
umpires and scorers. S. M. Rucker, H.
J. Corcoran and J. Cal Ewing were ap
pointed on the schedule committee and
authorized to confer with the mana
gers of the various teams and report
at the meeting to be held next Tues
day evening.
The committee on transportation was
filled by the appointment of Duboce,
Donahoo and Leffler and the committee
on uniform by the appointment of
Bunker, O'Neill and Dean. The latter
committee will decide upon the uni
forms of the various clubs in the
league.
It was decided to set the opening day
and to agree upon the length of the
season at the meeting next Tuesday
evening.
The Recreation Park Association
held a meeting yesterday afternoon
and decided that the association's por
tion of the proceeds of the first game
of the season would be given to the
fund for the semi-centennial exposi
tion. It was also decided that a start
would be made at once on the improve
ments of the park and that all neces
sary grading should be done to put the
grounds in perfect condition. A letter
was read from H. H. Lynch, superin
tendent of construction of the Market
street Railway Company, stating that
work would be pushed on the Eighth
street line, and it was expected that
the road would be completed before the
opening of the baseball season.
At the meeting to be held at the
Baldwin next Tuesday evening it is ex
pected that all business will be closed
up and that the order will go forth
that the clubs organize and go into
training at once.
STRATTON GIVES
HIS TESTIMONY
Denies That He Acted in a
Dual Capacity as
Attorney.
Another Monotonous Day in the Trial
of the Harbor Commission's
Suit.
The trial of the Injunction suit brought
by the Parafflne Paint Company against
the Board of State Harbor Commission
ers was resumed yesterday before Judge
Belcher. The entire session was devoted
to the examination of Attorney F. S.
Stratton, who took the stand in behalf of
the defendants, to testify that they had
acted under his advice and to further de
clare that the suggestion made that he
had been acting in a dual capacity, as
legal adviser of the harbor board and at
the same time attorney for a lumber com
pany interested, was without foundation.
Attorney Stratton went into the details
of his employment as attorney by the
Harbor Commissioners and of his deal
ings with the S. R. Slade Lumber Com
pany and Pacific Pine Lumber Company.
He testified that he advlse"d the commis
sioners not to let a contract on any of the
bids that are the subject of the present
legal controversy. He testified that he
told the commissioners that inasmuch as
they had been restrained from opening
the bids by injunction suit on the
day advertised in the proposals, there
was great danger of .serious legal compli
cations- arising if any contract was let
after the advertised time. When the bids
were opened on December 14 last and no
award was made that day, Stratton said
he told the commission that he further
believed another cause for legal contro
versy would be furnished, inasmuch as
the contract had not been awarded on the
day the bids were opened. /
Stratton then explained at considerable
length the dealings he had had with the
representatives of the lumber companies
mentioned In the present proceedings. He
testified that although he had been con
sulted by Slade, he had refused to give
the Harbor Commissioners any legal ad
vice on the question of paying the Slade
bills. He added that he had simply ad
vised Blade concerning his legal rights
and not on any matter Jn which the Har
%
bor Commissioners were directly inter
?sted. . .
Attorney Stratton. when questioned
â oncernin'g consultations had with Tirey
L Ford and \V. H. Jordan, relative to the
-uits that were subsequently dismissed
to the satisfaction of both the Pacific
Pine Lumber Company and the S. E.
â 51ade Lumber Company, substantiated
the testimony previously given by Fora
and Jordan. He will be called again to
the stand to-day for cross-examination
by Attorneys Cope and Sullivan, who rep
resent the "Paraffine Paint Company.
CUSTOMS APPOINTMENTS.

motions and Fills Vacancies in

occupation less laborious and more lucra
tive. ,

M. Wooster has been filled by the ap
pointment of Frank McDonald, an hon
orably discharged soldier.
Deacon Keppel's Case.
Deputy United States Attorney Bchles
inger announces that he will proceed with
the second trial of Deacon Keppel within
a month. The jury stood eight for con
viction to four for acquittal. The point
of contention was whether the expression
"married by practice" was obscene o*
It is stated by the prosecution that Mrs.
W. S. Little, the lady traduced in thÂ«
pamphlet sent through the mails by KepÂ«
pel, intends to bring against him a crimÂ«
inal prosecution in Butte County for liÂ«
bel. So that the troubles of the Deacon
are but just beginning, and his case Â«mÂ«
phasizes the saying that, whether true oÂ»
false, a man should never kiss and tell.

THE TALENT
IN RARE FORM
Nearly Every Winning
Horse at Oakland Was
Heavily Backed.
Chappie Downed a Fair Lot of
Sprinters at Tempting
Odds.
Throe First Choices in Frontâ Scarf
Pin Headed Her Field From
Start to Finish.
The track at Emeryville yesterday
showed but slight traces of rain, and
fairly good time was made in the dif
ferent events run. Three favorites, two
second choices and a rank outsider
gathered in purses for their owners.
The winners were all well supported,
and the majority of the bookies had a
crimp put in their bank rolls.
In the way of riding honors Thorpe
kept the ball rolling by piloting two
winners past the wire. Little Gray was
also in good form, getting two of his
mounts across the line first.
The win of Chappie in the final race
of the day was most unexpected. The
books laid 20 to 1 against his chances,
and, in front almost from the start, he
won ridden out, a head before Major
Cook, another outsider. The favorite,
Pat Murphy, was unplaced. Gray rode
an excellent race on the winner.
Judge Stouffer landed the opening
event, ridden by Thorpe, and a 9 to 5
favorite in the betting. Silver State
and Howard made a showing of early
speed, but the favorite shook them off
in the run home, winning cleverly from
the weakly ridden Lucky Star. Sutton
finished in the show.
The six-furlong run following went to
the even-money choice, Glorian, with
Lonnie Clayton in the saddle. Elsmore,
the Burns & Waterhousy entry, an S
to 1 shot, showed first when the barrier
was released, and led the big bunch
until weli into the stretch. Clayton
then went to work on the favorite, and
at the wire the brown colt won with
apparent ease. Rio Frio was a distant
third, several lengths behind Elsmore.
For a time it luuked as though Paul
Pry might make a runaway race of the
mile and a furlong selling affair. At
the start Lonnie Clayton rushed the 25
to 1 shot to the front, and the c-hestnut
horse simply toyed with his field to the
stretch. Thorpe now sat down on the
even-money favorite, Parthemax, and
gradually closed on the leader. Near
ing the wire the outsider tired, and the
favorite scored handily by a couple of
lengths. Benamela, a 30 to 1 chance,
came fast at the end, taking the show
from Holly Daylight
Ed Purser's good mare Scarfpin was
handed about as the right thing f^r
the seven and a half furlongs run, and
â¢was heavily played at 4 to 1. Gray
made all the running with her, and
with a little shaking up as the wire
was neared she won with something to
spare from patiently handled Refugee,
which receded in trie betting from 3
to 7. In a hard drive Conley took the
show with Montallade, a head in front
of McLight, the favorite.
Conley put up a very weak ride on
the favorite. Good Friend, in the five
furlong scramble, and the wise ones
who got aboard the fast filly Valenci
enne with all their belongings were in
line after the finish. The latter, backed
down from 5 to 1 to 7 to 2. beat the
barrier a couple of lengths, and, ridden
out at the wire, led the tardy coming

TRfICK ITEMS.
Arthur Helnrichs, the Jockey who gained
much notoriety in turf circles some four years
ago through his connection with the Little Pete
scandal, which resulted in his being ruled oft
the turf, together with Jockeys Chorn and
Chevalier, is paying California a visit. Hein
rk'hs was recently ruled off the outlawed Sln
gerly track, a battery having been found in his
possession at the conclusion of a race. On
Monday the disgraced rider was notified that
his presence was undesirable on the grounds.
He again put in an appearance yesterday, and
when told by President Williams to keep away
from the track, attempted to assault the latter.
He was taken from the grounds and placed
under arrest.
Conley's ride on Good Friend was a very bad
one. It was about on a par with the weak
effort furnished by little McNichols astride the
unlucky Lucky Star. This latter horse should
have won several purses during the meeting
now in progress, but either good or bad man
agement has kept him from doing so.
There was not much doing on Howard in the
betting and the horse ran as though short.
He is a most uncertain quantity to be a record
I Don't Know appears to have lost all of his
old time speed. He could not run across the
street yesterday.
The ring laid 100 to 1 against Rio Frio, the
show horse in the second event. Mike Hen
nessy put up a good ride on the outsider.
Hulda, the great race mare owned by A. B.
Spreckels, W j tn a record of 2.O?Vi, campaigned
through the grand circuit some years ago by
Orrin Hickok. recently foaled a fine looking
bay colt at Palo Alto Stock Farm, by Cupid
(2:18). a son of Sidney. The grand mare will
this year be bred to Dexter Prince.-
The stable hands at the Napa ranch of A. B.
Spreckels are happy. Honny Geraldine, the
erstwhile idol of the California turf, holder
of the world's record for half a mile over a
straightaway course, made at Morris Park.
August SO, ISS9, and whose six and a half fur
long record withstood the assaults of all the
cracks of the country for several seasons,
dropped a chestnut foal by Ravelgton
early In the week. Ravelston is a son of Flam
beau, and great things were expected of him,
but an unexpected break-down necessitated
nls early retirement. "Gerry" was a phe
nomenally fast piece of racing furniture, and
the career of her son will be eagerly watcht \
by turf followers.

THE GUARDS
NEED PRACTICE
National Guardsmen Who Are
Ready and Willing to Go
to the Front.
Reorganizing the Cadet Company.
What the New Uniforms
Are Like.
On several occasions the attention of
the proper officers has been called to the
fact that the National Guard of the State
of California should be placed in the best
condition possible in the matter of arms,
and that the State could procure an ex
change of the old-style Springfield rifles
for the modern ones, that a short time
since were discarded by the United States
army for the Krag-Jorgensens. "While
the modern Springfields are not the equal
of the arms now in use in the United
States army, they are as much superior
to the old 6prlngfields, which the Na
tional Guard of this State has, as the
Krag - Jorgensens are to the modern
Springfields. The exchange was promised
many months ago, but there has been so
much dilatoriness that the members of
the guard are still without the improved
weapons. Unless the proper officers "get
a move on" and urge the representatives
of California at Washington to have the
War Department issue the arms to the
guard of this State, the other States will,
in view of the preparations that are be
ing made all over the country for pos
sible war, secure their quota ana Cali
fornia will be left. In addition to it.c
in.mer of procuring arms for the men,
something should be done, and that witn
out delay, in the matter of rille practice,
so that "men might become more accus
tomed to the use of arms. The present
regulations are in such a condition that
the men are unable to obtain the amount
ol rractice they ought to have to enable
them to be at least fair marksmen at the
several ranges to which the weapon.?
carry. If there should be a call for vol
unteers the men of the National Guard
ought to be able to know how to handi?
and use the weapons placed in their
hands. Thete are a great many men in
the guard at this time, who would be will
ing to give up Sundays to go to the
â¢. anges to become proficient, but they are
not permitted to do so because of an or
der from the commander-in-chief to the
effect that there must not be any taigec
praiiice on Sunday. Ami these men c i:i
not spare the time from their labors dur
ing week days to go to the lurgvis. I;
is stated that Colonel Park Henshaw, in
spector-general of rifle practice, has de
termined to call a meeting of th? in
spectors of rille practice of the th"c*
brigades for the purpose of discussing the
necessity of changing the present rules.
It is the hope of those most interested
that stirh changes as may be made will

At the time the First Infantry went I
into camp at Ukiah last year a number !
of members of the companies did not go, !
and each handed in the old excuse, "My ;
employer would not let me off." There '
were so many of these that Colonel Smith |
determined to ascertain if it were true
so many employers were unpatriotic
enough to refuse to allow their employes j
to perform a duty imposed by the State. :
The result was Jiat exceedingly few of |
the employers declared that they could j
not allow their employes to absent them- j
selves on such duty, and the exception
was only in cases where the employer had
but one employe, whom he could not al- j
low to leave for a week without great :
detriment to his business. After having
had a full report in each case the de
linquents were brought up for neglect
of duty, and all such have been fined and !
Beverai have been dropped for the good of
the service. It is expected these examples
will teach the regiment a lesson not to be
forgotten.
READY FOR THE FRONT.
In view of the possibility of war, the
officers and men of the First Regiment
have consulted, and as a result they
have decided to offer their services to the
General Government the very moment
there is a call for volunteers. They de
clare themselves willing and ready to go
wherever ordered, but in case of war
with Spain they would prefer to he sent
to the front. Many of the company com
manders have received applications to
join in case of a declaration of war, and
from the number of such applications
there is no doubt that the Fir3t Infantry
would be ready to march with full ranks
within twenty-four hours after the call.
PETALUMA, March 7.â The members
of Company C, Captain Maciay, decided
at a recent meeting to Increase the com
pany to its full legal limitâ lo3 men.
Many eligible men have received requests
to join the company. The war talk of the
past few weeks has aroused the patriot
ism of the members of this company, who
express themselves as ready to go to the
front at a moment's notice should occa
sion arise. Their constant drilling shows
that they do not intend to be found want-
Ing in knowledge if called upon. Several
ex-members have signified their intention
to re-enlist, and Captain Maciay is in re
ceipt of letters from a number of ab
sentees who desire to be notified if their
services should be needed. This company
was organized June 29, 1869, when it was
known as the Hewston Guard. The com
pany is making arrangements for the
celebration of the thirtieth anniversary
of the organization, which will occur
next year. Of the old organization the
only local surviving members are: Ma
jor Armstrong, then captain; Hiram
Kundwin, J:.mes Stinson and Frank
Schell, who as armorer is still an active
member.
THE CADET COMPANY.
The Cadet Company, Captain Charles G.
Bartlett, attached to the First Infantry,
is being organized anew. Under the pro
visions of section 2032, rules and regula
tions for the National Guard, the officers
a at this time enlisting boys of the sev
eral High Schools* of this city who are!
over jive feet six inches in height and
able bodied. The enlistment, a result of
the war talk, was commenced two weeks
ago. and up to Saturday last the member
ship roll was increased to 102 officers and
men.
Ever since the Cadet Company was or
ganized by Colonel W. R. Smedberg thir
teen years ago the company has been lo
cated in the Lowell High School on Sut
ter street, but as the quarters there are
too contracted to accommodate the in
creased company it will leave the old !
armory and accommodations for it will
probably be provided in 'the regimental
armory at Page and Gough streets. The
change will be for the better, as for some
time past therÂ« was a lack of interest In
the company on the part of the pupils of
the school and of the teachers.
One difficulty in the company at this
time is the lack of equipments, and that
will be made apparent when the inspec
tion is held on the 21st. but the officers
expect that the deficiency will be noted
by the proper officers and the wants met.
In the work of reorganization the officers
have been assist**,! materially by Cap
tain A. J. Kelleher.
THE NEW UNIFORMS.
The first batch of new uniforms. In
tended for the company at Grass Valley,
was received in this city a few days
since. They were submitted to the in
spector from the United States army,
who pronounced them not only up to the
standard of the specifications, but in
some details better than was called for.
"If," said he. "all are like these, the
Guard of California will have the very
best uniforms ever furnished any guard."
NAVAL MILITIA.
A. E. Morgan lieutenant, junior grade,
and surgeon of the division at San Uiego,
and Ensign Delaney of Santa Barbara
were on the Pinta on the way down
when It was discovered that her boilers
were leaking. They will remain here un
til repairs are completed and so for ten
days the Marion win be their headquar
ters.

WILL BRING POWER
O'ER HILL AND DALE
Transmission of Electrical Force From the
Mountains to the Sea.
Tumbling Torrents in the Sierra Nevada to Be Utilized in
San Francisco Manufactories.
The most interesting scheme ever
conceived for the benefit of the manu
facturing industries of San Francisco
le about to be executed during the com
ing year. It means the transmission of
10,000 horsepower as a commencement
from the waters now running to waste
on the western slope of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, in Alpine, Amador
and Calaveras counties, by means of an
electrical line 110 miles in length to the
city of San Francisco, there to be dis
tributed at a small monthly cost to the
various industries needing it.
Many obstacles have presented them
selves to discourage the scheme, but,
â¢with the pluck and energy characteris-
HOW POWER WILL COME TO SAN FRANCISCO
tic of California, they have all been
overcome, and The Call is now enabled
to give exclusively the details of the
whole proposition.
Th" water supply embraces the Blue
Lakes Water Company's system, in the
above-named counties, which consists
of various natural lakes and artificially
constructed reservoir basins, ranging in
altitude from 8109 feet to 5670 feet above
B ea level. The highest of these is the
upper or west Blue Lake, which is a
deep mountain lake of fresh, pure
water, at present 375 acres in extent.
Lower Blue Lake is two miles south of
Upper Blue Lake, and the latter emp
ties into it through a stream having a
fall of about ninety feet. The catch
ment area drained by these two lakes
Is by actual survey 3050 acres, and the
surplus water from It, after filling the
lakes, is discharged into Blue Creek,
and flows through Clover Valley to its
Junction with Deer Creek, thence into
the north fork of the Mokelumne River
and down its rock-lined bed to the head
of the Amador Canal, into which it dis
charges at a distance of forty miles and
at an elevation of 2240 feet.
The additional sources of supply and
the reseivoirs are the Twin Lakes,
united into a single body of water by a
dam at their outlet on the northwester
ly side, embracing a watershed of 900
acres; the overflow discharging into the
Mokelumne River. Meadow Lake is an
artificial reservoir about three miles
westerly from Twin Lakes, formed by
throwing a dam 70 feet high and 430
feet long across the westerly end of an
Immense granite basin, forming a por
tion of the route of Meadow Creek,
which also 1b a tributary of the north
fork of the Mokelumne River, and has
over 2000 acres of drainage area. Bear
River reservoir is also formed by
throwing an artificial dam across the
Bear River. This dam curves upward
In the form of an arch, and abuts
against the granite walls of the canyon.
Its drainage area is over 7000 acres and
its altitude G670 feet.
The above list includes the reservoirs
available for the present actual run
ning of the power plant. In addition,
however, many storage sites have been
selected and set apart for future de
velopment, as the need for Increased
storage facilities arises. They include
Deer Valley site, which is three miles
below the dam of Lower Blue Lake, the
Grouse Valley site, the Snow Valley
site, Granite Lake, Bear River, Lower
Bear River and Gold Creek. The feat
ure of the whole chain of reservoirs is
their admirable location, on account of
which the water wasting from any of
those at a higher altitude can be ar
rested and stored by the ones lower
down, until the demand for use arises
during the dry season when the river
runs dry. The Mokelumne River Can
yon, along which all the waters must
flow for a distance of forty miles. Is in
a deep, precipitous granite gorge, where
no waste from seepage occurs and
small loss from evaporation can be
caused.
The canal system, which vill car^y
the large volume of water to the point
of Its conversion into power, may be
said to commence where the water
from Deer Creek flows into the Moke
lumne River, along which It runs for
forty miles to the commencement of
the Amador canal. Along this course
the water will follow the natural gran
ite bed of the stream, and during the
dry season the only flow will be the
discharge from the artificial reservoirs
of the Blue Lakes system. The present
Amador canal has been constructed
with a capacity of sixty cubic feet per
second for a length of forty two and a
half miles, mostly along the high moun
tain side north of Mokelumne River,
and it comprises the main artery for
the development of the proposed power
plant. Along its course are eighty-two
fiumes, which will cover altogether four
miles in length, with a grade of eight
feet to the mile; its average velocity
is five feet per second. In the past its
main duty was to supply the towns ",f
Jackson, Sutter Creek. Amador City,
lone and other villages with water;
but now it will have to be at lea-st
doubled in capacity to meet the re
quirements of the proposed power
plant.
The size to which it will have to be
enlarged and the water storapre required
to tide over the dry season are points
now bring determined by (skilled en
gineering talent. With a capacity of
120 cubic feet per second 28.352 million
gallons of water would be conveyed in
a year, while the total storage capacity
of the present reservoir sites, as per

The usual method of developing the
electric power is by means of water
wheels, to which the water from the
end of the ditch Is led by a large
wrought-iron or steel pipe strong
enough to resist the enormous pres
sure to which it is subject. In this
instance at the terminus of the ditch
there will be a fall of 1042 feet, which
would cause a static pressure of 480
pounds per square inch on the pipe.
The end of this pipe will be divided
Into a number o-f "V" branches, which
will lead into the water wheels at the
power-house. The elevation of the
floor of this building will be 624 feet
above sea level, and the nozzles will be
at an elevation two feet higher. At
the present time three 600-horse-power
generators have been Installed and
small transmission lines for power and
lighting purposes run north through
Amador County and south through
Calaveras County. The latter is leased
by the California Exploration Com
pany for a period of thirty years under
contract, and it is responsible mainly
for the evolution of the present project
in the mind of Prince Poniatowski,
who manages both the Exploration
Company and Pacific Syndicate.
The original conception of the whr/le
scheme is, however, due to Mr. Pierce,
who about a year since acquired con
trol of the Blue Lakes Company, which
heretofore was an unsuccessful con-
cern under the management of the
Dobles. Tfc-e financing is due to the
efforts of Prince Poniatowski of the
Pacific Syndicate, who has secured
both local and foreign backing for the
concern, as well as to Dr. Addieon, lo
cal manager of the General Electric
Company, who has undertaken the
contract for the construction of the
transmission line and the Installation
of all the electrical appliances on be
half of his company. Lieutenant Has
son. who has been Identified as con
sulting engineer with the Folsom, Ne
vada City and Los Angeles plantsâ all
a pronounced success â has laid down
the lines for the whole plant, and on
the strength of his advice capital has
been encouraged to Invest In the gi
gantic scheme.
It is at present contemplated to sup
ply dynamos ample for 10,000 horse
power at the power-house, and sub
sequently, as the demand increases
for the supply of power, to install
enough for 10,000 additional. The
pole line and wire will be ample
to convey a greater quantity, and the
length transmitted will be 110 miles â
the longest of any at present construct
ed In this country. A voltage of 30,000
volts is to be used through a copper
wire five-eighths of an inch in di
ameter, which will weigh over 8000
pounds per mile and cost at least $120,
000. The great object to be attained in
the transmission line is to cut the
length to the shortest possible limit,
and have no transformation of the in
tensity of the current, as every such
change adds greatly to the waste.
San Francisco Bay presents serious
obstacles to any conduit, and can only
be crossed by either a tunnel or a tower
construction to avoid obstruction to
navigation. After mature discussion, a
tower construction has been determined
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAKCH 9, 1898.
on, as the cost of an underground tun
nel would be prohibitive at this stage
of the enterprise. To further lessen any
obstruction to navigation, the tower
line has been located along the shallow
water separating San Leandro penin
sula from the southeast part of San
Francisco peninsula. No navigation
other than that to Alviso and Baden
stockyards will pass beneath the arches
formed by the wire, which at no point
will be less than 125 feet from the sur
face of the bay, so that vessels can pass
through without interruption. At night
the tops of the towers will be illumin
ated by arc lamps, so that mariners
can steer their way safely between.
Colonel Suter of the United -States
Army Engineers has been consulted
with the view of gaining Government
permission for the proposed structure;
but application must finally be made
to Congress to get the consent of the
authorities. As the navigable channel
at this point is only a mile wide, three
towers with two spans of a half-mile
each will be ample. The approaches
on both sides of the towers will be car
ried on high poles sunk in the bay mud,
and as the water is very shallow no
hindrance to navigation or the flow of
the currents will be caused thereby.
As can be seen from the accompany
ing map, the pole line will make an
air line from San Leandro to Stock
ton, skirting south of Mount Diablo,
and crossing the marshes along the
levees. Most of this part of the route
has been surveyed; east of Stockton
the line will run along the main coun
ty road to the northeast for aboat
twenty miles and thence make a di
rect line for the power-house. In the
city of San Francisco the line will run
north along Railroad avenue and Ken
tucky street, tapping first the manufac
turing belt of the Potrero, including the
Union Iron Works and such other
plants as at present consume a vast
quantity of coal, which it is proposed
to supplant with the new power. Sub
sequently it is proposed to enter the
lighting field here In competition with
the gas and present local electric com
panies who now develop all their il
luminating power by purchasing and
burning coal. The fact that the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company has do
nated the free right of way along its
lines to the corporation is evidence that
it will take power for its street rail
way lines from the new company.
Roughly speaking, the power plants of
San Francisco, with a population of
300,000, will aggregate 65,000 horse
power, and which, with the installa
tion of cheap power, will surely in
crease. Fuel in San Francisco is more
expensive than in any other large city in
the United States. This is due to the
fact that no large beds of good coal
exist anywhere in the vicinity, conse
quently the cost of steam power pro
duced by the combustion of coal is
correspondingly great. The average
price of coal in all large Eastern cities
is $2 to S3 50 per ton, while In San
Francisco the price of the best anthra
cite Is $7 per ton. Carefully compiled
estimates of the actual cost of horse
power in San Francisco with the past
prices of coal show a cost of $125 per
horsepower per year; or $10 04 per
month. As the new company will be
able to lease its power at $4 or $5 per
month per horsepower a splendid stim
ulant will be at once supplied in the
way of cheaper power to our local
small factories, as well as an incentive
given to many new enterprises to en
ter the manufacturing field against
Eastern competition. The market for
local coal consumption will also be af
fected by the lessened demand, and a
substantial reduction in price must be
given to the local consumer, under the
altered conditions which will prevail.
The cost of the whole scheme is es
timated to be $1,000,000, of which
$800,000 will go toward the electric ma
chinery and transmission line, for
which amount the General Electric
Company has guaranteed to supply
this portion of the plant and to war
rant its successful operation for a year.
The only difficult feature in the propo
sition will be the suspension lines be
fore mentioned across the bay. The
foundation of the high steel towers
will rest in concrete which will be
placed on piles driven in the mud to a
depth of forty feet. Mr. Burrell, pres
ident of the California Bridge Com
pany, has offered for $50,000 to con
struct the three high steel towers, the
tops of which must be at least 200 feet
above the bay surface. Between the
top of the towers a steel carrying
cable will be suspended, and to this
by ingenious devices the copper cur
rent wire will be attached. Excepting
this difficult point the wire will be car
ried on poles 120 feet apart, and It will
require at least 4400 of them. If the
pole line were brought on land around
by Alviso it would lengthen the line
forty miles, and besides increasing the
cost the excessive length would make
the eject rical waste so great as to
practically prohibit the inception of
this scheme at the present tii ie.
Taking the total of $1, 000,000 for a
10,000 horse power plant this would
make the cost $100 per horse power.
Taking the rental value of same at
$5 per month, one-half the present coat
of power from coal, and taking: the ex
penses of administration to be 25 per
cent, or $1 25 per month, this would
yield a return of $3 75 per month, or 45
per cent on th Â» total investment.
Should even one-fourth of this be the
result the promoters of this scheme
will be generously rewarded for their
enterprise. In comparison with the
East, where great extremes of heat
and cold, intense frost and snow storms
and other natural obstructions to ex
posed wires prevail, from which Cali
fornia is free, there is a fine field pre
sented for the building of such pro
jects on this coast, especially where
coal is so expensive that it retards
the natural development of manufact
ure and consequently limits the num
ber of Deople employed.
It is figured to take a year at least
for the completion of the system. As
will be seen from the accompanying
map the pole line crosses five coun
tiesâCalaveras, San Joaquin, Contra
Costa, Alameda and San Francisco
over all of which rights of way have
to be acquired. Franchises are at once
to be applied for to pass through the
city of Stockton, the village of San
Leandro and the city of San Fran
cisco, as well as from the various
Boards of Supervisors to carry the pole
line along the county roads where con
venient. The acquisition of rights of
way for the pole line is now being pro
cured by Prince Poniatowskl's agents
over private lands, and in a short time
announcement may be made of the
completion of all the preliminary
steps in the scheme, so that construc
tion can be actively prosecuted. Prince
Poniatowski is to be president of the
new company, Mr. Angus, once asso
ciated with the late Mr. Roe of elec
tric promotion fame, secretary, and
Mr. Pierce and other local capitalists
will be on the directorate of the power
company.

mand Attention of the Regents
In Secret Session.
The Regents of the State University
yesterday elected Professor James G.
Keeler of Allegheny, Pa., director of
the Lick Observatory to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of E. S. Hol
den. The friends of Professor George
W. Davidson made a gallant contest in
behalf of the veteran astronomer, but
the "combine" for a new man was tut
powerful to be overcome.
It is said that the offer was made to
Professor Davidson to elect him unani
mously provided he would agree to re
sign in the near future, but he declined
the proposition.
It is the talk now that Dr. Pepper has
been slated to succeed Martin Kellogg
as president of the university. The re
port goes that many regents have been
quietly sounded on this proposition.
The suggestion is advanced that Mrs.
Hearst would be pleased if the position
of president of the university were ten
dered to Dr. Pepper, as she entertains
a high opinion of his intellectual and
executive ability. The Regents are
disposed to respect the wishes of Mrs.
Hearst in order to encourage her to
munificently endow the institution. No
doubt her wishes will be consulted in
the selection of a president to succeed
Mr. Kellogg.
It Is understood that Governor Budd
has made up his mind to reappoint J.
West Martin as Regent. In place of
George T. Marye, whose term is about
to expire, it is said that the Governor
will appoint E. A. Denicke, who is now
a Regent by virtue of holding the office
of president of the Mechanics' Insti
tute.
The Board of Regents convened at
11 a_ m. yesterday. The members at
tending the session were: T. G. Phelps
(presiding). Governor Budd, A. S. HaJ
lidie, J. West Martin, I. W. Hellman,
Albert Miller, E. A. Denicke, J. F.
Houghton, Phebe A. Hearst, H. S.
Foote, C. M. Chase, Dr. Chester Rowell
(Fresno), Lieutenant-Governor William
T. Jeter, Arthur Rodgers, President
Martin Kellogg, George T. Marye, Wil
liam T. Wallace, John E. Budd, James
A. Waymire, J. B. Reinstein, C. W.
Slack and S. T. Black.
The forenoon session was devoted
chiefly to reading minutes in open ses
sion and a long pow-wow in executive
session. Regent Hallidie as usual
moved for the secret session, and when
the spectators and newspaper report
ers were excluded the business of the
board began. It was explained that
the Regents had financial matters to
consider. It was known beforehand
that some delay in a money-lending
transaction of $56,000 at Los Angeles
had been caused by the discoviry that
the title to the property offered ac se
curity was in the name of Henrievta
Workman, when the application for
the loan had been made by A. Work
man. Great haste had been made in
Los Angeles to complete the transac
tion before the first Monday In March
â all Assessors' day.
The Regents are great on money
lending, and are often called on to ad
just little vexations in secret session.
The Johnson property in this city is
held some way by the Regents, and
yesterday the sum of $3500 had to be
voted to repair the premises in order
to keep up the rents. The vote on this
proposition was not taken, however, In
secret session.
The Wilmerdlng bequest of $400,000 is
some way Invested in the Johnson
property. The money Is safe and draws
a good rate of interest, but the inter
est earnings are by some process
pooled with other loans, and hence
cmly an average is accredited to the
Wilmerding investment. The people of
the State are not to be troubled with
the details of these complicated trans
actions. It is enough for the people
to know that the standard of educa
tion, already high, is going to be
higher.
When the board met at 2 o'clock the
report of President Kellogg first occu
pied its attention. Professor Slate of
the department of physics proposed
that Assistant Professor Lewis be
given a traveling fellowship for one
year on the income of the Whiting be
quest fund. Although President Kel
logg recommended the appropriation,
many of the Regents opposed it. Judge
Slack was opposed to it on the ground
that this was a special use of the
fund, and contrary to its object, which
was to establish a permanent form of
expenditure. After Professor Kellogg
had explained his reasons for recom
mending the outlay, it was adopted on
a majority vote.
A communication was received from
the Academic .Council, which recom
mend the holding of summer schools
in other branches besides physics and
chemistry. It was referred to a spe
cial committee, composed of Judge
Slack, Mr. Black and Lieutenant-Gov
ernor Jeter, who will report on its ad
visability at the next meeting.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt of
the Navy Department sent a
communication, setting forth that ow
ing to the scarcity of officers it would
be impossible to detail a naval engi
neer as Instructor at Berkeley.
On the recommendation of Professor
Clapp of the department in Greek, Mr.
Husband was given the position of as
sistant in the place of Mr. Nutting, re
signed.
On motion the reports of standing
committees were passed and the spe
cial order of business calling for the
election of a director for the Lick Ob
servatory was taken up.
Mr. Houghton arose and placed in
nomination Professor George Davidson.
In his speech he called attention to Mr.
Davidson's fitness for the position. In
his hand he held a pamphlet in which
was printed, in chronological order, a
history of Davidson's achievements
from the year 1843. He told of his
abrupt dismissal from the Geodetic Sur

vey, and stated that his election to this
position would be a reparation in that
regard. As he was a man of tact and
ability, he would harmonize matters in
the observatory, In a way that we have
not had in many years past.
Judge H. S. Foote, in an eloquent
speech, seconded the nomination. He
said he knew of no man in this coun
try better fitted for the position and no
one who would carry greater weight
than Professor Davidson. He thought
he would organize the forces at the ob
servatory and keep it in better condi
tion than any one else; that he was a
splendid all-round man and last of all
that he was a Californian and an honor
to his State.
Chairman Phelps vacated his position
for the purpose of placing in nomina
tion Acting Director Schaeberle of the
Lick. In a speech full of fire and elo
quence, he told of his candidate's fit
ness for the important office.
Mr. Rodgers thought that President
Kellogg was a trusted member of the
university, and called upon him for his
opinion as to who was the proper man
for the position.
President Kellogg stated that he had
written to leading astronomers on the
subject. He then read communicatio"ns
from Professor G. E. Hale, who is In
charge of the Yerkes Observatory. In
which the latter gave as his opinion
that Professor Keeler was the best man
for the place. Professor Simon New
comb also chose Keeler, and Professor
Chickering of Harvard wrote that Pro
fessor Keeler would be his choice for
the position. Professor S. T. Langley,
head of the Smithsonian Institution,
also chose Professor Keeler.
Arthur Rodgers then arose, and said:
'â¢I need not remind ttie regents of the
importance of this selection and of the
fact that, owing to the fame of the ob
servatory abroad, we can secure the ser
vices of anybody, almost without ex
ception, for the position. I am sure we
can secure any of the leading astron
omers of America. I am satisfied we
could secure for the position Simon
Newcomb, who recommends Professor
Keeler, and is probably one of the most
distinguished in the world, who has
been in charge of the National Observ
atory at Washington, who has re
ceived more decorations than any other
astronomer in America. It is not neces
sary to go over the names In detail.
It seems to me it is our duty to select
the best man."
Mr. Rodgers then went on and told of
Professor Heeler's ability and Qtness
for the place. After paying Professor
Davidson many compliments, he closed
by saying that he thought Davidson
was better fit for the position of pro
fesor in geography at Berkeley.
Judge Wallace then followed with a
spirited speech, in which he indorsed
Professor Davidson. He said he did
not believe in petitions, as any one
could gttin any number. He closed by
eulogizing his candidate, saying that
he was an honor to his State and we
should further honor him by electing
him to the position and make his re
maining years a pleasure and give him
an opportunity to add further laurels to
his already well-known name.
The nominations being closed. Regent
Marye moved that the board go into
executive session, but after spirited
speeches by Foote, Wallace and the
mover of the motion. It was lost. An
other motion to have a secret ballot
met the same fate.
As the secretary called the regents
by name they voted as follows:
For Davidson â Jeter, Chase, Denlcke,
Foote, Hellman. Houghton. Miller,
Wallace, Waymire and Governor Budd
â10.
For Keelerâ Kellogg. J. E. Budd, Mrs.

On the second ballot Regents Phelps
and Black changed to Keeler, giving
him the election by two votes.
President Kellogg will advise Profes
sor Keeler of hi* election.
It was decided to exhibit some of the
celestial photographs at the New York
Academy of Sciences' exhibition and
they will be forwarded East by the ob
servatory in a few days.
Regent Rodgers then arose and
moved that Professor Davidson be ten
dered a professorship in geography at
the university at a salary of {3000 a
year. The motion was carried.
After a Jong debate it was decided to
give the senior graduating class $400
instead of $260, to be used in prepar
ing their exhibition on commencement
week.
The committee on buildings In
formed the regents through a commun
ication that East Hall had been com
pleted and was ready for occupation.
On motion it was agreed to approve of
the building.
The committee on reservoir reported
the early completion of the work. A
report was made on the work now In
progress, and the chairman stated that
within a month the college buildings
would be fully protected from fire. Re
gent Budd thought a celebration was
in order when the work was finished.
The protection of the Mark Hopkins
Art Institute from fire was next taken
up, and it was decided that the ex
penses of placing fire apparatus in and
about the building should be borne by
the regents.
The committee on congressional
land grant reported and recommended
that the California delegation in Con
gress be requested to oppose the In
dian appropriation bill, amendment No.
58, being what is known as the free
homestead bill. It was ordered that a
telegram be sent to the members of
the delegation to oppose its passage.
The committee on dairy school re
commended to the board that the
finance committee be requested to In
sert in the next budget an amount suf
ficient to cover the cost of establisfi
ing and maintaining a school to be
created in the department of agricul
ture in the State University.
Professor Christy asked and was
given $500 for the purpose of running
his laboratory for the balance of the
year.
An adjournment was then taken.
