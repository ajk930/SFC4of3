WASHINGTON, July 1 -The War Department has
received the following from General Shatter, dated at
Siboney :
"Had a very heavy engagement to-day, which lasted
from BA. M. until sundown. We have carried their
outworks and are now in possession of them. There
is now about three-quarters of a mile open between
my lines and the city. By morning troops will be in

be there. General Lawton's division and General
Bates' brigade, which have been engaged all day in

will be in line and in front of Santiago during the night.
I regret to say that our casualties will be above 400.
Of these, not many killed. SHAFTER."

by General Shatter and Rear Ad

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY BEFORE SANTIAGO
(via Playa del Este), July I.â Major General Shatter this
morning began with great vigor the attack on the outer
defenses of Santiago; From three directions the American
forces advanced toward the doomed city.
While General Luwton and General Wheeler were at
tacking Cariey* northeast of Santiago, General Kent was
advancing toward Agiiadores. General Garcia, with his
Cuban troops, at tJie same time approached Caney from
the southeast, and other divisions of the American army
pressed toward Santiago from the east, our forces thu s
presenting a ; solid front from the coast to General Linares'
northern defenses.

AMERICAN SPIES
General Shafter Receives Valuable
loformation as to Cor)di
tions in SaQtiago.
Special Cable to The Cull nnd the New York Herald. Copyriglited, 1808,
by James Gordon Bennett.
GEXKIIAI, SHAFTF.K'S HEADQUARTEKS, June 30.â (Via Port
Antonio, July 1, ria Herald-Call dispatch boat Mindora.)â Two Amer
ican B.ecrei service men- have penetrated General Linares' lines, entered
Santiago arid Pfetarped safely with an accurate amount of the situation
and the conditions in t lie city. These are the first Americans to pene
trate the enemy's lines and the information brought is regarded as
entirely reliable by General Shafter.
The men confirm the news that Cervera's ships are partially dis
mantled and also report, the Heina Mercedes scuttled by Cervera's or
ders to block the ha: !><>r entrance.
They brought exact, information as. to the strength of the defenses
of Santiago and of General Linares' army, which is very valuable.
<;â¢ nj ra! Shafter believes the water supply is partially cut off.
The secret serV^Sg imrn reported that yellow fever had" appeared in
Santiago in v mi!d form. .
General Siiaifet'k h-.-n I . quarters now are near Sevilla. Bai(iuiri will
be abandoned to-day and the base removed to Siboney. The report that
General I'ando with 4000 men is advancing from Manzanillo is given
little credence, but precautions are being taken to prevent a iunctioh
with Linares. Garcia, with 3000 Cubans, has been detailed for this
duty.
A large number of small mines were forwarded to the front to
day.
Cervera's fleet was hurling shells
in the direction of the American
and Cuban lines, whose batteries
of light artillery, acting under or
ders from Major General Shatter,
who went to the front at the head
of the troops, began the battle
of Santiago by attacking Caney.
From- this village a direct road
leads into Santiago and the ad
vance of our forces will be irre
sistible when they gain possession
of this road.
General Joe Wheeler, with a
detachment of his cavalry com
mand, and General ( iarcia. with
his Cuban troops, quickly joined
General Lawton's men in the ad
vance upon Caney.
The Spaniards for a time
fought desperately to prevent Ca
ney falling into the hands of our
forces. It was a vain effort. Be
fore the fighting had been long
under way the American and Cu
ban forces gained advanced
ground. Foot by foot the enemy
was driven back into the village.
It was evident after the first
hour's fighting that General
Shatter had gauged accurately
the strength of the enemy and
that he would be able to drive the
Spaniards into Santiago at his
pleasure.
It was with difficulty the com
manding officers restrained the
enthusiasm of our men until the
hour for the beginning of the at
"tack. The enthusiasm of the
American forces was intense and
their spirit quickly spread to the
Cuban troops. All have shared
the belief of General Shafter, that
Santiago could be taken by a
sharp, persistent attack, and they
have been impatient to advance.
Brigadier General Kent, who
'commanded the central of the
general line of attack, started the
Twenty-first Regiment of regu
lars toward Aguadores at the
same hour when General Law
ton's men advanced toward Ca
ney. Upon these troops fell the
brunt of battle to" the southeast
of Santiago during the early
hours of the day.
As I write this dispatch this di
vision. General Kent's forces, has
sustained the heaviest loss, of the
engagement thus far. : .
There was desperate fightiug
about Aguadorcs. Acting under
orders from General Linares, the
Spaniards at that point returned
the American fire with a fury
that aroused in our men the
fiercest â¢ determination. They
boldly fared the enemy's - fire,
holding their- ground tenaciously
and pressing forward whenever
an opportunity to gain an ad
vanced footing presented itself.
In their operations about
Aguadores the Americans were
greatly encouraged by the work
of the fleet, which poured a heavy
fire into the lines of the Span
iards. â¢ .
Admiral Sampson ordered the
New York, 'Gloucester and Su
\vanee to attack the batteries re
cently placed to the east of
Morro. The vessels engaged the
batteries at short range and left
only scarred hillsides to show
where the batteries had been lo
:ated. .;:.:â .
ThÂ« Massachusetts and New York
troops then opened with their big guns,
plunging a heavy fire into the enemy's
lines. Common shells and reduced
charges were used for this purpose,
and they demoralized the enemy's
ranks. The shells were fired at a hijrh
elevation, so as to clear the towering
coast line ridge.
The Newark joined the fleet this
morning, and at noon the lowa steamed
within 1000 yards of Morro Castle. Ad
miral Sampson had signaled from the !
flagship for the lowa to engage >lorro,
but a few moments later, just as the
lowa was about to open fire, an annull
ing pennant was hoisted. It was sus
pected that the watchful admiral had
noticed the Call-Herald dispatch boat
Somers N. Smith coming alongside
the lowa and had annulled the original
signal to allow the Smith to get clear
of the danger.
The Harvard arrived at Altares this
morning wi'fh INQO Michigan volunteers.
They were hurried ashore and has
tened forward to join the American
line.
As the enemy was pressed back

toward Santiago, both at Caney and
at Aguadores, the progress of our
forces was in entire harmony with
the plans of General Shafter. Our line?
thus became more closely knit, and
now the Americans and Cubans pre
sent a continuous front from the south
east to tho north of the city. Oh the
right at El Caney now is General H. W.
Lawton with three brigades. The first
is under Colonel J. J. Van Home, com
manding the : "hth United States
â¢Infantry, the Twenty-second Infantry
and the Second Massachusetts, Colonel
E. P. Clark, commanding. The Second
Brigade is composed of the First,
Fourth and Twenty-fifth United States
Infantry. The Third Brigade, under
General A. R. Chaffee, is composed of
the Seventh, Twelfth and Seventeenth
United States Infantry,
General Joseph Wheeler with four
light batteries is strung out in the rear
of Lawton's division. General S. B; M.

streams and through the dense under
brush. At no. time, however, were, they
unprepared to discard their luggage
and fight. . â¢ .-.'.' '. "â  .! â ' â  â  â  .
General Shafter's line took a. position
at the rear of .General Garcia's band
and succeeded in advancing nearer to
the defenses of Santiago than had any
other aTitivSpahish. force sine? t ope.raT
tions in .this Vicinity . bejyan. They
skirted the ; village of. GaixeyV within two
miles o-fihe city, arsenal, passing in
plain view of tfre : Spanish pickets. They
encamped last: night near. by and; pre
pared for. an. early attack.
Garcia's men, hot a- few of whom
lived in Santiago UTtfU they were driven
out by General Weyler's command,
could hardly restrain â  themselves, so
eager were they tQ attack Â£hÂ« city at
once. When they caught sight of their
former hJpnie they cheered erithusias
tically. They deniaiided to be. led for
ward against the city at once, and they
were restrained with difficulty by Gen
eral Garcia and his subordinate officers.
Cahey is made up of residences of the
wealthyy and Garcia was confident of
occupying It "without difficulty, espe
cially as the Spaniards showed a dis
position to abandon it withciut a fight.
General Garcia expected the honor of
leading the assault on the city, and ex
horted his men to fight desperately.
; General Shafter, after making a care
ful personal examination yesterday,
found many vulnerable points In the
defenses of Santiago, His men on the
northeast had been aWe to get within
two miles of the city's outward de
fenses, and another division of the
army had come equally near to Morro
Castle.
All of the enemy apparently were en
gaged .in strengthening the defenses
of the city. Through glasses yester
day one could easily see a force of 1500
Spaniards throwing up earthworks,
and. another force of Spanish cavalry
entering the city.
It is told me as a positive fact that
Colonel Wood and Lieutenant Colonel
Roosevelt with their Rough Riders are
officially criticised for their inipetuosity
in dashing into the fight with the
Spaniards last Friday without haying
more carefully considered their posi-.
tion. This division, I am told, will be
carefully handled in the future, lest its
members again lose sight of everything
in their desire for a speedy victory.
In the skirmish to the southeast of
Santiago yesterday, our men captured
the Spanish colors. .. . . â¢
After considerable effort General
Shafter's men have- succeeded in shut
ting off the Water supply of the city.
They have been working oh the prob
lem several days, but it was a difficult
one. The main water supply was ob
tained from another side of the : city
than that occupied hy our troops. \
After General : Shafter's. -success In
practically surrounding" the city, how
ever, it was pqssihle to locate the waiter
supply and. shut it off. This achieve
ment by the Americans hag added much
to the desperation of. the Spaniards,
who have been short of food for some
time. They now are threatened with, all
the horrors of a food and water famine..
After the Cubans began their, march
two companies of regulars armed with
picks and shovels as well as gun's went
forward to make Jtnprov.e-ments in' the
roads. During the night a heavy rain
fall had made the paths difficult for
travel. The work of the regulars soon:
put the roads in good condition, the re-
Mr inaer of the artillery was sent for
ward and last night was arranged in
positions commanding the city.
The plans of attack originally mn de
bj the : nival board were rejected by
General Shafter . as not feasib'o.
General Wheeler has sent a request
to Washington for immediate re-en
forcements of mounted cavalry. Nearly
all the cavalrymen now are without
horses* .
Another division of the American
army attacked the heights of San Juan,
disabling the Spanish battery there and
taking possession of the enemy's works.
The advance of General Shafter's
forces was checked only at the inner
line of the city's defenses. It was dark
when the fighting ceased for the day.
At sunset our troops were in possession
of the ground they had gained.
The battle will be resumed at day^
break.
Admiral Samppon's . fleet silenced
nearly all of the shore batteries.
The city may fall to-morrow.

PLATA DEL ESTE, July I.â A gen
eral assault on the city of Santiago de
Cuba by the land and sea forces of the
United States began at 7 o'clock this
morning. General Lawton advanced
and took possession of Cabona, a su
burb of Santiago.
Morro Castle and the other forts at
the entrance of the harbor were bom
barded by our fleet, the Vesuvius using
her dynamite guns with good effect.
The Spanish fleet in the harbor fired
on the American troops, who were very
close, to the city.
The battle continued until dark. Our
forces carried the enemy's outer works
and have occupied them this evening.
The battle will probably be resumed at
daybreak; ...
The American loss is heavy. Some es
timates place it at 500 killed and wound

lated by a Snanish shell. Our advance
was checked, but we are holding the
positions gained. Reinforcements are
being hurried to the front.

/WASHINGTON, July i.â An official
dispatch was. received last night at the
War' Department confirming the press
report that General Shafter had sent
back on transports to Aserradero,
whence they came, 2000 of Garcia's Cu
bans. The purpose is a double one â
first, to prevent re-enforcements com

the west, and second, to prevent the
retreat in that direction of the Span

CORBIN SAYS SHAFTER
HANGS ON WITH TEETH
IN ENEMY'S NECK
WASHINGTON, July 2.-The sus
pense which followed the receipt of
General Shafter's dispatch early yes
terday morning announcing that a bat
tle had begun near Santiago was re
lieved at 12:30 this morning when a
preliminary report of the day's oper
ations was received by General Corbin
from General Shafter.
The President and the war officials
are immensely pleased at the informa
tion conveyed in Shafter's message.
While they learned with sincerest re
gret that so many of the American
troops had fallen in the fight the
ground gained by the day's conliict is
regarded as a great victory.
Adjutant General Corbin put the sit
uation strongly and picturesquely this
morning, while speaking briefly of the
aggressiveness and tenacity of General
Shafter. "The old bulldog," said he,
referring thus half-affectionately to the
distinguished commander of the Fifth
Corps, "is lying right there with his
teeth in their neck, only waiting the
coming of daylight to finish the work
he has so magnificently begun.
"The engagement yesterday was very
heavy for a preliminary fight, but it
scores a decided victory for us. I re
gret to know that Shafter has sus
tained so heavy a loss, but we may
hope that there are not, as he says,
many killed. It is, however, pretty
certain to be true that the loss of an
army in an engagement like that of
yesterday, where the battle line extend
ed over several miles, will be much
heavier than is indicated by the first
reports. It is manifestly impossible^ in
cases where the battle has raged all
day and until dark, to ascertain with
definiteness the loss sustained."

army < officers on duty in the War
â Department this evening up to 12
ick, when the dispatch ar
rived from Major General Shaf-
ter, Adjutant General Corbin was
the only officer of the depart
ment. In commenting upon the
dispatch General Corbin said :â .:â 
: "Our troops must have acted
in the most heroic manner. The
dispatch is very encouraging. â 
X "The worst ; part of the whole
; â â â  affair is the number of casualties
â â :â¢"â ' reported â 400 killed or wounded
is a very large number for an
â â -â â â : army of 15, 000 or 16,000 men."
â 'â â â â  I asked General ; Corbin what
he thought would be the next
move of General Shatter. He
said: ;
- ; "The general is undoubtedly ]
going to continue the attack the
â X first thing- to-morrow. ;â ; He un
doubtedly means business and
will follow up the advantage
gained to-day as soon as possi
ble."
President McKinley, Secretary
Alger and General Miles, who
had all retired before General
â â  Shatter's : dispatch was received,
were awakened and given copies
of the dispatch. They were
pleased to learn of the advantage
: gained by General Shatter, but.
like General Corbin. regretted
that so many men had been killed
or wounded. That the American
troops were able to force the en
em v back all along the line is re- ;
garded as an indication of the
great superiority of General Shaf- !
ter's men over those of General !
Linares.
HEAVY SKIRMISHING

WASHINGTON, July I.â Just two

.. -r day of the month, like that

and : the question, 'was ift-eyi-ry:. i,...-'s
mouth, "Why did he not .report?" 'â :â â .:'â â :'.
Adjuta:,t General Corbin's -response
â was brief but >^olnted "He is flehtinir,
not writing," and thi3 was accepted as
a likely and sound explanation. Just
before 4 o'clock ..cam^ a brief dispatch
. from Playa del Este, : the cable . station
near Santiago. But it was from an
engineer officer to General Miles and
made no reference to the progress of
the battle, merely referring to certain
try material and livestock.
On the whole this very absence of offi
cial news was regarded as rather a fa
vorable indication, the reasoning being
that this morning's engagement was

but a skirmish, and that our army was
feeling the enemy to discover and at
tack his weak spot It was nearly 6
o'clock when the signal officer received
the welcome news that the enemy was
retreating.
General Miles was of the opinion that
the action of to-day was in the nature
of a heavy skirmish all along the
American front, particularly on the
right, and that its main purpose was t.>
develop the strength of the enemy, and,
if possible, learn the vulnerable point
along the Spanish front.
This, however, was based only on the
lack of definite information, and Gen
eral Miles felt that any hour might
bring word of a general engagement.
Hrigadier General Stone was inclined
believe that after maintaining their
stand to-day the Spaniards would re
tire during the night, leaving the city
evacuated.
The military authorities here are fully
considering- the chances of such a re
treat of the Spanish army from San
tiago, and are endeav >ririsr so to shape
events that General Hhafter's forces
will not only take Santiago, but v.iil
capture the 12,000 Spaniards befc. .-c
they get away northward to effect a
juncture with General Pando. Full in
formation as to the possible lines of re
treat has been placed at the disposal of
the War Department.

Americans was shipped from Tampa

SHAFTER CUTS OFF
POSSIBLE RETREAT
OF THE SPANIARDS
NEW YORK, July I.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: "Major General Shafter's ob
ject in first making an attack at Caney
was for the purpose of getting the
troops behind and to the north of the
city of Sanitago, and thus cutting off
the retreat of the Spaniards through
the pass of El Cristo."
This statement was made to me this
afternoon by Major General Miles. Just
bihind the city of Santiago, in a north
erly direction, is the pass of El Cristo.
In case the Spanish general found it
necessary to evacuate the city he would
certainly attempt to retreat through
this pass. Once his army was en
trenched in this pass it would be an
exceedingly difficult task for the United
States troops to force him to surrender.
Ten miles west of the Bay of Santiago
is the pass of El Cobre. It is not
thought the Spanish army will make
any attempt to retreat, in that direc
tion as the fountiy is very nviuntaln
oua a. â¢nâ¢ n Vikl, and it would get no ad
vantage in making such a move. There
is still another pam- through the moun
tain:-; in a northeasterly direction from
the city of Santiago. This pass is
known by the name of El Condella.
General Lawton has, however, by his
move this morning made it impossible
for the Spanish to retreat in that di
rection. They are now, in fact, cooped
up in the city of Santiago de Cuba.

SAGASTA SAYS PEACE
IS NOT IN SIGHT.
Denounces as Absurd the Rumors
That Spain Is Ready to
Yield.
MADRID, Jujy I.â Premier ' "Sagasta, .
in an interview to-day in regard â  to'
peace rumors, said: .
"They are absurd. I am astonished
that any attention }s paid to them.
There will not and cannot be any dis
cussion in regard to that matter. I
affirm this absolutely. The Government
cannot treat for peace now. That ac- â¢
tion depends on developments, and the
Government will not act until the
proper time."
While the Bishop of Barcelona has!
â¢leclared in favor of peace, the Bishop
of Segovia has issued a pastoral letter
in favor of a holy war.
The Chamber of Agriculture of Barce
lona has again petitioned the Govern
ment in favor of peace, and the central
committe.e of the Socialist party has is
sued a circular pofntlng out the folly
of continuing the war, in view of the ,
disproportion of the means of the com
batants, and setting forth also that the
working people desire peace.

Conference Committee Disagrees on
Morgan's Pacific Roads Re
funding Amendment.
WASHINGTON, July I.â The conference
cornmitti c on the deficiency appropriation
bill has disagreed cm Al^rgan's amend
ment, funding the debts of the Pacific
Railroads. The House conferees would
not consent to its adoption. The bill now
goes back to the Senate, where Morgan's
amendment will be either insisted upon
or yielded. The expectation is that the
Senate will insist, and new conferees be
appointed.
Representative de Aries has been hon
ored by Speaker Reed by being appointed
on the' Census Committee. This is a very
important committee, as it will prepare
the bill for the twelfth census. DeVries
is the ranking Democrat, his name stand

posing the minority.
The House to-day passed a bill to pay
P. F. Duiulon of San Francisco $2900, this
being the amount forfeited under contract
for work done by him on the Government
light at Grays Harbor, Washington.

HOW THE
BIG FIGHT
COMMENCED
General Shafter's Report
on Beginning of the
Action.
The Commander-in-Cr;ief Tells of
His Move on Northeast
Portion of Santiago.
WASHINGTON, July i.â
Secretary Alger received the fol
lowing dispatch from General
Shafter, dated at 9:45 a. m. to
day:
CAMP AT SEVILLA,
Cuba, July I. â Action
now going on, but Fir
ing light and desulto
ry. The fight was be
gun on the right, near
Caney, by Lawton's
division. He will move
on the northeast por
tion of the town of San
tiago. Will keep you
continually advised of
progress. SHAFTER.
Major - General Com
manding.
Secretary Alger directed Adju- I
tant General Corbin to notify the '
President at once of the text of!
General Shafter's message, and it
â was dune immediately. The Pres
ident will be kept continuously
advised of all news.
As the Secretary started to
the Cabinet meeting he spoke
â with satisfaction of the fact that
sufficient time had elapsed to per
mit General Shafter to get his j
army n ell concentrated at the
front and thrown out into good
battle formation. The Secretary
felt that our forces were on the
re. and that the mere
i.ci ihat the action was now go
ing pri showed that Shafter had
bided his time and was ready to j
strike his blow. Word had come .]
prior to the Shafter dispatch
showing that the artillery, which;
had been brought to the front,
was well placed.
â¢General Miles, commanding
the army, received a copy of the
dispatch soon after it arrived. He
had anticipated it, for only a few
hours before a dispatch came to
him from General Breckinridge.
inspector general of the army,
stating that the spirit of the
troops was high and that they
were eager and expectant of ac
tion.
General Miles also received an
other dispatch sent quite early
this morning from Shafter's head
quarters, saying that the big mil
itary balloon was now high in the
air and was giving opportunity
for observation over a great
sweep of country. This in itself
was of incalculable value to our
troops. Brave reconnoissances
had been made, but these were of
little value compared to what
could be seen from the balloon a
mile or more in the air, com
manding a radius of observation
of from twenty to forty miles
with powerful telescopes.
This was the first actual use of
the balloon by the American
army in the present war, and
General Shafter set much store
on the information they would
give as to the exact location of
all the Spanish forces, their
points of concentration, the defi
nite location of Cervera's war
ships in the harbor and possibly
the progress of the Spanish re
enforcements.
After the first announcement
of Shafter was bulletined, the
time dragged wearily with noth
ing from the field to answer the
intense anxiety to which every
one was wrought.
According to General Shafter's
report the attack on Santiago
was begun by the Second Divi
sion of the Fifth Army Corps.
This division consists 'of three
crigades, made up as follows:
First Brigade, commanded by
Colonel J. J. Van Horn, Eighth
United States Infantry; Twenty
second United States Infantry
and the Second Massachusetts
Infantry.
Second Brigade, commanding
officer unknown, but supposed to
be Colonel Bates, First United
States Infantry; Fourth United
States Infantry and Twenty-fifth
United States Infantry.
Third Brigade, commanded by
Brigadier General A. R. Chaffee,
Seventh United States Infantry;
Twelfth United States Infantry
and Seventeenth United States
Infantry.
Thus it appears that the divi
sion which opened the hostilities
of the day is composed entirely
of regular troops, seasoned and
experienced in battle, with the
exception of the Second Massa
chusetts Volunteer Infantry,
which is regarded as one of the
best volunteer organizations of
the army.
General Lawton, who was
chosen for the important and re
j sponsible duty of opening, the
battle by the capture of Caney
and the interception .of Spanish
re-enforcements now lieafing
Santiago, is described as a. good
fighter and \a soldier of : excep
tional ability/ He served in the
Union army, haying entered as.
j sergeant of Company E, Ninth
I Indiana Volunteer: Infantry, in
April,: 1 86:1,. and being succes
sively v; promoted through merit
on the field ofbattle to first lieu
tenant of the, Thirtieth Indiana
Infantry in August, 1:86 r; to cap
tain in May, 1&62,.. .and to lien
tenant colonel in 1 864., 1n March,;
1 565 , he was brevetted . colonel
for gallant and meritorious, ser-,
vices during the war. He entered
the regular establishment in July,
1866, as second lieutenant of the
Forty-first Infantry, colored, and
remained with that branch of the
army until January, 1 871, when
he was transferred to. the Fourth
Cavalry, with which he remained
until September, 1888, when he
was appointed inspector general,
with, the rank of major. He was
subsequently promoted to the
rank of lieutenant colonel and
held that rank until the opening
of the war with Spain, when the
President appointed him briga
dier general of volunteers and as
signed him to the command of a
division of the Fifth Army Corps,
commanded by General Shafter.
The Cabinet was in session for
almost two hours to-day, but
took no important action. The
session was mainly occupied with
a discussion of the news from
Santiago. General Shafter's dis
patch was read aloud before the
members of the Cabinet. The As
sociated Press dispatches were
also read verbatim to the Cabi
net. There was a general feeling
of gratification shown at the co
operation rendered by Admiral
Sampson's fleet. Careful plans to
this end were made in a general
way some time ago, though leav
ing to Sampson the widest dis
cretion.
The Cabinet also devoted some
time to questions connected with
the operation of the war revenue
bill.

Secretary Dong; .said that thie
fleet under Sampson was co-opeV
rating to the fullest extent with,
the land . forces,; and that lie ex
pected great results. He suggest
ed that there were two conditions
certain in the Santiago situation.
"One is," he said, "we will win,
and the other that it will "come

certain." .' .-

GENERAL KENT'S HEADQUAR
TERS, near Aguadores, June 30, by As
sociated Press dispatch boat Wanda,
via Kingston, July I.â The Spaniards
in the front of General Kent's line have
adopted a new method of preventing*
him from firing on their works. Thfey
have strung out at frequent intervals
Red Cross flags, the line being directly
in view of their entrenchments. The
object of this, it is thought at General
Kent's headquarters, is to prevent the
Americans from firing in that direction,
or if the Red Cross is ignored, to
spread the idea that the American com
manders are violating the rules of civ
ilized warfare in firing upon the hos
pitals. '

BLANCO'S ORDER TO

LONDON, July I.â The Pall Mall Ga

and Admiral Cervera, adding that
Blanco ordered Cervera to leave San
tiago de Cuba, and that the admiral
replied that he would be glad to leave,
but that his guns were dismounted, he
was without coal and the American
admiral was waiting outside for him.

DEWEY WAITING
FOR â¢E_TRANSPOrtTS
Germany's Marines Will Be Be
quested to Leave When
Manila Is, Captured.
NEW YORK, July I.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Rear Admiral . Dewey cabled
to the NaÂ»y Department to-day that
the situation in Manila is still un
changed. The dispatch was dated
June 27. At the time it was sent the
transports, with 2500 troops on board
had not yet arrived. Neither had the
cruiser Charleston been sighted.
Much to the gratification of the au
thorities Rear Admiral Dewey reported
that the insurgents had taken no offen
sive action against Manila. This is es
pecially pleasing, as it show 3 that Gen
eral Aguinaldo is still complying with
the wishes of Admiral Dewey and will
make no offensive move against Manila
until the transports and the Charles
ton arrive.
The troops will be landed at Cavite,
and when they have recuperated from
their long voyage they will be moved
forward to the insurgent lines. The
American warships will take up their
position in front of the city and its
surrender will be demanded. Failure
to comply with the demand will result I
in operations which it is believed will j
result In the capture of the city with- ;
out much loss.
It is not proposed to fire indiscrim
inately on the town. The points to be I
shelled are those occupied by the Span
ish troops. The authorities do not ex
pect that foreign marines are to be
landed, but if they should be they will
be invited to leave as soon as the city
is in the possession of the Americans. !
Rear Admiral Dewey will inform the \
German coromander-in-chief and the
senior officers of other naval forces
that the 2500 Americans at his disposal j
are sufficient to preserve order in the |
city, and that retention of marines on
shore is unnecessary. It is said in ad
ministration circles that such a state
ment will undoubtedly result in the
withdrawal of marines. On assurance !
from Rear Admiral Dawey that the
Americans can preserve order the other j
warships will undoubtedly withdraw j
their forces. In the face of such an ex
ample Vice Admiral Diedrrchs will
have no excuse for ordering the Ger
man forces to remain in the city.
DEWEY HAS MADE NO
â OFFICIAL PLEDGES
Carefully Avoided Committing the
Government to Any Line
of Action.
WASHINGTON, July I.â While not
prolix in his utterances, Admiral Dewey
loses no opportunity to keep the Navy
Department informed of the state o-f
affairs at Manila, A dispatch came
from him to-day, dated Cavite, June 27.
He had many other matters of interest
to communicate, but they were not of
a character that could be properly
made public at this stage. For one
thing it can be stated that Admiral
Dewey has been particular to avoid
committing- his Government to any
particular line of action respecting the
future of the Philippines or to do any
thing that -ttould embarrass .General
Merritt in framing a policy to meet the
heeds of the case when he arrives. He
has. made no official pledges to the in
surgent leader, although he has not
hesitated to openly praise his good
politics and his accomplishments.
GERMANY RECOGNIZES
OUR AUTHORITY
Admiral Diedrichs Rejects the Propo
sition of a Neutral
Governor.
BERLIN, July I.â The following dis
patch has been received from Hc-ng
kong: According to trustworthy intel
ligence from Manila the Spanish Govr
ernbr General had, a few days ago, at
his own request, a meeting with Ad
miral Diedrichs, commander of the
German naval forces in the Far East,
in order to propose, on behalf of
the Spanish Government, that Manila
should be handed into the provisional
charge of a neutral commander. The
proposal was rejected by Admiral Died
richs, in view of the American block
ade.
The Manila news, via Hongkong, re
ferring to the action, of Admiral Died
richs. may be looked upon as bomg
a semi-official note, as it watf issued by
the semi-official news agency here.

PORT SAID, July i.â The San Francisco entered the
Suez canal this afternoon. The Pelayo, Carlos V and the re
mainder are under way. They are going 1 just outside Port
Said, -where they will coal from their colliers.
NEW YORK, July I.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Although Camara's fleet is still report
ed to be at Port Said, State Depart
ment officials say they have reason to
believe that it will leave its present
position at the invitation of the Egyp
tian Government within the next few
hours.
Dispatches received by the depart
ment from its agents at Port Said and
Cairo give no reason for the delay of
the Spaniards except that they are
waiting for coal. The Egyptian Govern
ment has been f urnivhed the official ex
planation that the ships are undergo
ing repairs, but it is believed the
chances are that this explanation la
untrue and that the Spaniards are &im
ply tinkering with their machinery un
til fuel arrives or their Government
has made a definite decision as to their
destination.
In official circles it is believed Spain
is hesitating because of the intention
of this Government to send Commodore
Watson's squadron in pursuit of Camara
a second squadron, if necessary,
t bombard the coast of Spain.
In the meantime every day's delay is
beneficial to the United States. It has
been definitely decided not to send
foinmodnre Watson with his fleet in
pursuit of Camara until Cervera's
s destroyed. This work will be
plish- <1 with all possible dispatch,
and the lowa and Washington, which
belong to the Eastern squadron, will
be sent to Newport News, where they
will receive such repairs as may be
sary. Then, accompanied by the

Newark and three auxiliary cruisers,
they will proceed at once to cross the

way to the Philippines, provided Ca
mara's fleet proceeds to that point.
The exclusive announcement by the
Herald this morning of the intention
to send the Eastern squadron after Ca
mara's fleet, even if it had to steam to
the Philippines to catch him, was con
firmed by officials to-day, although
they declined to make any official
Statement concerning the matter. It
was said to-day that Commodore Wat
son could not sail for the East under
ten days, although every effort is being
made to hasten the assembling of his
squadron and perfect all the details
necessary to its efficiency. In view of
this fact the authorities are conslder-r
ably gratified at Camara's action in re
maining at Port Said, and th<\v purpose
to throw all pqssible obstacles in his
way in order that his arrival in the
Philippines may be delayed.

GIBRALTAR, July I.â Carbonera
Tower, near Algeclras, is being rebuilt
j and heightened. Three thousand men
| are coming to re-enforce the garrison
| at Fort Chorrueias, overlooking Alge
clras. Two gunboats reconnoitered
the Tangier waters to-day, owing to
news that the American squadron
would come to Tangier for orders.
to arouse Spanish enthusiasts to Join
them in an expedition to raid towns
along the Texas border.
These two Spaniards came in on the
Norwegian steamer Bergen, which re
cently arrived at Vera Cruz. Mexico,
with 110 passengers, most (if them Cu
ban refugees and non-combatants, who
boarded the steamer at Sagua la
Grande, a port on the north coast of
Cuba. The two Spanish army officers
also embarked on the Bergen at that
port, representing themselves as Cuban
refugees. They attracted no particular
attention, but began their work as soon
as they had landed at Vera Cruz, and
were soon located by Cuban agents and
their mission ascertained.
According to the reports of Cuban â 
representatives in Vera Cruz there is !
a large contingent of Spaniards and [
Spanish sympathizers who are very bit- j
ter in their expressions toward the
United States and who have been
secretly lending aid to the Spaniards
since the declaration of war and have
openly denounced the United States.
Captain Argudin and Lieutenant Ve
lasquez are secretly working and have |
aroused the more ignorant to such a |
state of excitement that they are ready
and anxious to join an expedition to
raid towns in the United States along
the Mexican border. No decisive steps
have as yet been taken toward carry
ing out this plan, but it is known to
< 'uhans th.'it the scheme is in progress
of formation and that steps have been
already taken to counteract it should
an attempt be made to carry it into

MUTINY IN
REA'S CAMP
School Trustees Are
Wavering.
MRS. CLEMENT NOT OUSTED
BOARD NOT YET READY TO
BREAK THE LAW.
Bealize That the Illegal Appoint
ment of Miss Hankenson
Would Result ia
Trouble.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July I.â Miss Irene Han
kenson of Gilroy failed to put In an ap
pearance at the Superintendent of
Schools' office this morning to assume
her duties as deputy, to which she was
recently elected, and consequently Mrs.
A. B. Clement retains the place. Late
yesterday afternoon a conference of
those interested in seating Miss Han
kenson was held in "Boss" Rea's office, i
at which it was decided to abandon the
matter on account of its illegality. A
legal opinion was sought and Rea was
told the law was very plain oh the
question, and that putting Miss Han
kenson in as Deputy Superintendent of
the city schools would be a direct vio
lation of the charter, which provides
that all deputies must be residents of
the cLty two years before holding of
fice.
This enraged the big boss, and he de
clared the City Superintendent must
throw Mrs. Clement bodily x>ut of the
office, but this official refused to do so.
Rea declared he would call a meeting
at once and depose Mrs. Clement, but
later he said they Would wait until
Tuesday, when the new members of the
board take their seats. At that time an
effort will be made to dismiss Mrs.
Clement and elect Miss Hankenson a
substitute teacher and let her do the
Deputy Superintendent's work. By this
j means it ia proposed to get around the
'charter provision.. But legal authori-
I ties claim this cannot be done, and that
i the performance <jf the Deputy Super
! Intendent's duties by a substitute
| teacher would be really filling the offire. â 
The removal of Mrs. Clement .has
caused suoh a rumpus that it is not
believed the Trustees, now that they
know the election, of Miss Hankenson
is illegal, will insist on seating her. It
is said that with the exception of Gra
MADRID, July I.â The liriparciil to
day publishes a dispatch from Santiago
de Cuba saying that four American
warships at 4 o'clock this morning
opened flre upon Manzanillo, Province
of Santiago de Cuba. The dispatch
adds that the firing, which lasted an
hour, was answered by the Spanish
gunboats in the harbor, and it is fur
ther said that "the Americans retired :
with one vessel seriously injured, 'as
she was towed away with her fires ex
tinguished." " V-\;-. : â  '
Continuing, the dispatch to the Im
parcial asserts that only one Spanish
peasant was wounded during the bom
bardment.
From the same source it is asserted
that the Americans used a captive bal
loon yesterday in taking observations
of the forts of Santiago.
In conclusion the dispatch says a fir
ing party of Americans fell into an am
bush yesterday and that one of them
was killed and two others captured.
ham the Trustees now see their mis
take and are in favor of retaining Mrs.
Clement. Rea is straining every effort
to whip them into line, but it is
thought they will heed the wish of the
public and turn the boss down. The
two new Trustees to be seated at the
next meeting are It. J. Langford and
T. O'Nell. Just how they stand is un
certain, but they are both good men,
and it is not thought they will do the
boss" bidding;
At a recent meeting of the Good Gov
ernment League of Santa Clara County
the matter of Professor Smith's dis
missal from the High School was dis
cussed. The charges of the Battlefield
Veterans that Professor Smith was un
patriotic were denounced as a political
trick engineered by the "gang." The
following resolutions were unanimously
adopted:
"Whereas, It is our belief that our pub
lic schools should be entirely free from
the influences that at present dominate
our politics; and whereas, the teachers
should be selected solely for their fitness
and efficiency and not as a reward for
political favors, and when they have
proved themselves faithful and competent
they should not be removed in order to
make iÂ»!aces for political favorites, or as
a punishment for refusing to obey the
orders of political bosses and rings; and
whereas, we believe that Professor Smith
of the San Jose High School has been
unjustly removed, for political reasons
only, from his position in said school by
the Board of Education of San. Jose,
against the unanimous protest of pupils
and patrons of said school; therefore
be it
Resolved, That we heartily commend
the pupils and graduates of San Jose
High School for the gallant fight they
are making for the reinstatement of Pro
fessor Smith as a fight in the interests
of our Rchools and in the cause of good
government.
Resolved, That we earnestly urge the
parents and friends of the Hign School
pupils, and especially such as are mem
bers of this, leagnf, to assist their chil
dren in this contest by every honorable
means in their power.
Resolved, That we heartily indorse Pro
fessor Smith and urgently request the
Board of Education of thÂ« city of San
Jose to reappofnt him to his position in
the San Jose High School.

CHICAGO, July : I.â The : " stereotypers
on all the " Chicago â  papers struck at 11
o'clock to-night and for the first time in
'fifty-one years Chicago will wake up. to
morrow, morning to find ah utter ; -dearth

Four weeks ago the stereotypers made
a demand for an increase of wages from
$3 75 to $4 a day, a reduction of time from
eight to seven hours o a day and, 75 cents
an hour for overtime. The - : publishers
were willing to concede the increase in
pay, but refused to accede to the demand
for 'reduced hours. The men demanded
all or nothing.' Several conferences were
held, but all attempts., at compromise
failed. â¢ â  ' : '* '. â -*..â¢* â '.
In the meantime the publishers .agree.d
to stand or fall together; that unless men
could be got to man all the offices none
would attempt to get out papers. The
stereotypers took advantage ; of .the prog
ress of Shatter's battle at Santiago .to-day^
to renew their demand, believing the pub
lishers would yield rather than forego the
privilege of announcing the greatest news
of the year to the i public. â â¢â  ' -.. :;
â¢ "A long and stormy session .was held
from 7 till 11. when finding the publishers
firm the men struck, and every, newspaper
plant in the city was closed, which in the
case of the Tribune, the oldest paper in
the city, was the first time in â¢ fifty : one
years. â 
No papers will be printed till the strike
Is settled. It is not probable 1 that the
strike will spread to other departments., of
the papers, as the "printers,* pressmen 1 and
mailers, though federated with. the stereo
typers, believe the derriands of the" latter
were exorbitant and that furthermore the
principles of the federation were violated,
when the strike', was ordered without con
â¢suiting others of the federated bodies/ '

DISCLAIMING A PARTNERSHIP.
DR. PARDEE. candidate for Governor, denies
rather vaguely that the railroad is behind him,
and somewhat more specifically, that the Ex
aminer is, doing all it can to advance his political
intercuts. Yet both assertions have the merit of be
ing true. That the good doctor should be aggrieved
at the 'publicity is not surprising: That he should
have used his influence to have the Oakland Enquirer
make denial for him is perfectly natural. That he
owns the Enquirer makes his influence. considerable.
Vet the d I Ottld not have permitted his agita
tion to carry him to extremes. To the dispassionate
array of facts printed in The Call yesterday he makes
the response that the writer lied. Such a statement
lacks dignity, and fails to carry conviction.
The Enquirer! man was doubtless doing the best he
knew how. but he got himself into a sad jumble. He
asserted tj&M: the article to which he was trying to
t has been inspired by a desire to defeat botW
Oakland aspirants, Pardee and Davis. A little fur
ther on he averted with equal directness that the can
didate who is not Pardee is the railroad man, and
that the purpose was to "fall into his arms" in due
season.
The doctor, needless to say, is wrong. The article
which stirred his bile merely set fottli the aspect of
politics in Alameda County. The writer who pre
pared it, in collecting material, found that Pardee
and the Examiner and the railroad "push" were all
engaged in inflating a Pardee boom. They had be
come campaign partners. Acknowledgment is made
freely that it is a queer combination, but even con
sideration for the doctor's feelings would not permit
a conscientious scribe to overlook it. Now the quick
swo<>p made by the doctor's paper to the rescue of the
Examiner confirms all that had been printed. Or, per
haps, he disavows the association, not for the sake of
the yellow sheet/but because he is ashamed of it him
self.
If the- doctor expects to impress the community
with his sincerity he must do more than deny that
which is known to be true. Instead of disclaiming
the partnership, he ought to repent, move for a dis
solution, demand the appointment of a receiver and
a speedy accounting.
AS TO THE ZOO.
J~\ N evening paper, which occasionally gives an
/ \ imitation of thinking, wants to know why The
* * Call favors a liberal expenditure for the im
provement vi Golden Gate *Park and not a cent for
the establishment of a monkey ranch in the Mission.
Were the paper in question, guided by intelligence
it would never have formulated such ail inquiry. Yet
an answer is easy to give, and may fall under the
eye of perspns so equipped that they can appreci
ate it.
The Call favors a liberal appropriation for Golden
Gate Park, because this park is already one of the
finest in the world, a source of comfort and pride,
capable of being made more and more attractive. Gol
den Gate I'ark is not only a beautiful breathing spot, J
but it is the one feature of San Francisco notable above j
all others. People from every part of this country
and from abroad have viewed it with amazement and
admiration. To in any measure check its--develop
ment would be a distinct loss. It belongs, more
over, to the whole city. It is accessible to all. It
is not for the especial benefit of the Miss-ion nor of
North Beach. These facts constitute a sufficient ex- j
cuse for advocating a liberal appropriation.
As to the proposed monkey ranch, it would be for
the Mission alone. The amount applied to it would
have to be taken from the fund now devoted, to a
park for the entire city. . There is no need of it, be
cause there is still much unoccupied space in Golden
Gate Park. There is rip justice in it, because the
majority of San Franciscans would Tjqt care to cease :
the habit of going to the- established resort, nnd i
whatever attractions, might be. put in the Mission j
would be at public expense, for the benefit of a few. â 
The city has no money available for the purchase of
a site. These are a few of the features of the situa
tion which constrain The Call to oppose the Mission
zoo, and the consequent crippling of Golden Gate
Pnilc.-: â¢
It is worth remembering, also, that the proposed
700 is a real estate scheme: that .a syndicate desires
to unload on the city for far more than legitimate
value a lot of land of which it might otherwise be
unable to dispose, certainly not at the absurd figure
mentioned in connection with the proposed sale.
These are a few of the reasons for the position we
have t&ken, nnd propose to maintain. The whole
zoo scheme is a piece of shameless robbery, and none
knows it better than the editor of the evening paper to
Whose work 8 pr.ssing reference has been necessary. If
further proof of the character of the scheme is needed
attention is called again to the circumstance that it
has his support
THE VICTORIOUS MARCH-
rROM the day the American troops landed on
Cuban soil the advance has been steady and
success constant. It has been a victorious
march on Santiago, hardly interrupted for an hour
by the ambuscades and entrenchments of the enemy.
The army, like the navy, has added new glory to our
annals, and the triumph achieved by the one on the
sunlit bay at Manila has been equaled by that ac
complished by the other amid the chaparral of the
mountains around Santiago.
The skirmish by which the advance guard cleared
the thickets and made way for the main : rmy to
ascend the hills has been swiftly followed by an at
tack in force upon the Spanish entrenchments in the
suburbs of Santiago itself. The reports of the battle
which we publish this morning speak for themselves.
They attest the energy and valor with which the
army under command of General Shafter is following
up the successes won last week. They also give as
surance of a speedy ending of the war in Eastern
Cuba, leaving the army and navy free to direct their
whole force upon Havana, there to end the conflict
in the island with a blow.
When Cervera, after dodging about the Caribbean
Sea for as long a time as he could, steamed with his
fleet into Santiago Bay for the purpose of avoiding a
conflict with our warships in those waters, he doubt
less indulged the fond hope that he would remain in
safety under the protection of the forts along the
narrow entrance to the bay, all summer; and, per
haps, keep his flag flying indefinitely. Such hopes
were based upon the belief among the Spaniards that
a land campaign in that part of Cuba was impossible.
For years the best Spanish troops, under their best
generals, strove in vain to dislodge a few insurgents
from the mountains, and it was theW conviction that
Americans would have no better success in an ag
gressive movement than themselves. They have learned
better now. Cervera's fleet would have been safer
in midocean than where it is.
With this brilliant feat accomplished in so short
a time the captious critics of our general will have
to relapse into silence or speak only to excuse them
selves. They can no longer charge the generals in
the field with delay or the commander-in-chief with
indecision. There can be no longer any sneering
at the Board of Strategy, nor any mocking reference
to it as a "board of lethargy." The fleet and the
army have moved together in perfect accord and
have combined to encompass Santiago and Ceryera
and rival in this hemisphere the triumph of Dewey
at Manila.
W'itii the winning of the battle of yesterday the war
enters upon a new phase. The period of prepara
tion has given way to the time of action. Unless
Spain speedily sues for peace other battles will swiftly
follow. News of additional triumphs for our arms
in Cuba will alternate with dispatches of victories in
the Philippines. Neither ambuscades nor the fevers
of the summer season in the tropics will stay the vic
torious march of the younger grand army of the re
public. We have in the reports of its progress news
to thrill us with keen ardor at the coming celebra
tion of the glorious Fourth. This is a new war for
the liberation of some of the oppressed peoples of
the world. It carries wider yet the glory of the starry
banner, and confirms anew the cause for which that
banner was first unfurled.
CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS.
THE frank declaration of the Examiner that a
"dependency" like Hawaii may be governed by
Congress without regard to the constitution
would be harmless, the mere vagary of a yellow freak,
if it were not expressive of the purpose of the annexa
tion crowd everywhere.
They throw to the winds every principle of this
Government. They propose to annex and govern
w-thout consent of the governed. They propose to
tax without representation. They propose to erect
diffeient rules and enforce different statutes, "accord
ing to conditions." At home will stand the eight
hour law, the prohibition of contract labor, the re
striction upon coolie immigration. In Hawaii there
wiil be the longest day that human endurance can
stand There will be contract labor, there will be free
immigration of coolies under contract. The fruits of
this labor system will flow into our market to com
pete with the fruits of labor at eight hours a day not
bound by contract and paid on a white scale. While
inequality of law will permit this advantage of cheap
tropical labor, there will be no complementary in
ecuality of law for the benefit of white labor at home.
No tariff will shut out the products of coolie labor.
Its sugar, raised on a wage of $6 to $9 a month, will
meet in the home market beet sugar produced by
labor paid three times as much, and the beet sugar
.will be driven out and the promising industry will be
ruHod. There is no end to the calamities that will fol
low government unlimited by the constitution and
therefore irresponsible to the people. Yet the organ
of annexation treats such government as proper!
The statesmen of this country saw in slavery an in
equality. To keep light and leading away from the
slaves there had tobe a Federal law regulating the
mails by prohibiting ihe carrying of "incendiary pub
lications.*' Greeley's Tribune and Garrison's Liber
ator were "incendiary." The law permitted their cir
culation by mail in the free States and prohibited it
in the slave States. In apportioning representatives
in Congress according to the population the law
counted every five negro slaves as three white men,
though the law denied to any black man the right to
vote. These and other inequalities of law were re
quired by the necessities of the slaveholders, yet our
Government was founded, on the principle of political
equality!
One day the voice of Lincoln rang out from
Cooper Union in New York with the declaration that
the Government could not live under such conditions
of inequality, that between .freedom and slavery there
was an irrepressible conflict, and if the republic were
to endure the Union must be all free or all slave. The
cry of ''one land and one law" smote the fountain of
patriotism and it was instantly affluent. The land was
filled with widows and orphans; industry took bur
dens of taxation on its back; the people gave up
luxuries first and necessaries at last, as willingly, that
there might be one law for all. The veteran heroes
of that struggle are yet with us. The verdure hardly
hides the battle-fields where fell a million of men in
that struggle for equality. Yet we are told now that
"dependencies" can be acquired and governed by un
equal laws; that in such inequality there is no ir
repressible conflict; that Lincoln was mistaken; that
the laurels of Gettysburg and Appomattox were ill
bestowed;, that the constitution does r.ot limit the
powers of government, and that the ancient cry of
"one land and one law" was a delusion.
Up to date the German admiral at Manila has re
fused to actually interfere, and if he know- what is
good for him he will keep on refusing.
General Rlanco's rule of not recognizing white flags
â¢will' get him into trouble sooner or later if it is one
of the rules working both ways.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 2, 1898.
1 N Pennsylvania and in the neighboring State of
I Ohio the campaign which is to end with the fall
* elections has virtually begun. The contending par
ties are lined up for battle and the issues on which the
result is to depend are being rapidly formulated. In
both States the silver question has subsided, and it
appears the main fighting will be done over matters
rising out of the war.
The Philadelphia Record, a gold standard, free
trade paper, has taken advantage of the situation to
try to make its way back to the Democratic camp, and
in order to effect this has begun a vigorous attack
upon certain policies advocated by the Republicans.
One of the measures favored by Republicans to which
the Record objects and in opposition to which it
wishes to array the Democracy is the construction of
the Nicaragua canal. On that subject it says:
"For years this project has been urged upon Con
gress by a powerful lobby, but it has been beatea off
because of the grave doubts as to the physical feasi
bility of maintaining the canal in a region of vol
canoes, earthquakes and tornadoes, and because also
of its dubious financial success, as well as of the poli
tical complications in which it would inevitably in
volve this Government in Central America. But since
the Nicaragua canal has also become an official meas
ure of Republican administration it can be defeated
only by the refusal of the people to send a Republican
majority to the next Congress."
While it is by no means desirable that a great com
mercial enterprise like that of the construction of the
Nicaragua canal should be made a party issue, the
Republicans will not be averse to accepting a chal
lenge from Democracy on the issue if it should be
made. The need of a waterway across Nicaragua has
long been apparent to persons interested in American
commerce, and the events of the war have now made
it known to all classes. If, as the Record says, "the
canal can be defeated only by the refusal of the people
to send a Republican majority to the next Congress,"
there will be an additional reason why a Republican
should be elected from every Congressional district
in the Union.
On another point, however, the Record makes a
more effective shot against the Republican platforms
of the two States. Commenting upon the declarations
in favor of American shipping it says:
"If the Republican party had been friendly to this
policy of steamship bounties and discriminating duties
on imports it would have been adopted when the
Dingley tariff became a law. The notorious twenty-
second paragraph, making discriminations in duties,
has been ruled out of the Dingley act by an Attor
ney General's opinion, and, notwithstanding the ex
istence of a protectionist majority in both houses of
Congress, the paragraph is as dead as if it had never
been enacted."
There is no evading that statement, and no retort
to it save the foolish one that Democrats have done
no more for our merchant marine than Republicans
have done, and that the Wilson bill was as barren as
that now in force of discriminating duties. Such a
retort, however, is not worth the making. The Re
publican party and the administration have a pledge
to the people which has not been fulfilled. So long
as nothing is done for our merchant marine, so long
will the party be justly subject to the taunts of its
oppo For Republican State conventions to
adopt resolutions declaring in favor of promoting
American shipping is good, but it would be better to
have the Republican majority in Congress pass a bill
on the subject. In that, as in all things else, actions
talk louder than words.
STRENGTH IN CONGRESS.
/"""* OMMENTING upon a recent display of the cx
l ceptional influence of Vermont in Congress the
Philadelphia Times says: "One reason why
Vermont secures the services of statesmen of high
rank to represent her in Congress is that' her people
give their representatives a chance to become familiar
with their duties. The Republicans of the State have
just renominated the two present representatives in
the lower branch, Mr. Powers, who is now serving
his fourth, and Mr. Grout, who is serving his eighth
term."
This view of the origin of State influence in Con
gress is unquestionably sound. The great States of
New York and Illinois, despite their preponderance
of votes in the House, have less influence there than
smaller States whose Representatives make up for
their lack of numbers by familiarity with the methods
of conducting business in Congress and their alliances
formed with other Congressmen during their long
term of service.
In this connection it may be noted that the people
of lowa have learned the advantage of giving their
representatives time to acquire influence at the capital.
It has been recently stated that when the present
members of Congress from that State finish the terms
they are now serving they will have had a total of 142
years' experience in national legislation, which makes
for the thirteen members an average of nearly eleven
years. The total for the two Senators alone is fifty
years; one member of the House has had eight terms,
another six, two five each, three fcur each, two three
each, and two others two each.
California will never hold her rightful place at the
national capital nor have due weight in Con
gress until the people have learned the les
son so profitably applied by the States we
have named. We have been vacillating and
shifting at home, and have changed our Congres
sional delegation as often as elections occur. As a
rcrult we have now at Washington more free traders
and free silver men to misrepresent our industries
and our financial interests than protectionists and
soi'nd money men to represent them. We are weak
where we should be strong, and are less potent in the
great councils of the nation than Vermont or Maine.
An effort should be made at this election to send to
Washington a delegation thoroughly representative
of California, and thereafter maintain it comparatively
unchanged from term to term. When we can point
to a Congressional delegation with a service record
like that of lowa we shall not see our interests so
often sacrificed as is now the case. The reciprocity
clar.se of the Dingley tariff, for example, would have
had in it something else than California products.
We would not now be purchasing a market in France
for lowa meat by paying for it at the expense of Cali
fornia wine.
When Blanco ordered Cervera Jo get out of Santi
ago harbor the Captain General was either in an ab
stracted frame of mind, or he has no mind. Two ways
are open by which the order might be obeyed. Cer
vera can put dynamite under himself and go up, or
scuttle himself and go down. But he can't get out.
It seems that Sharkey is getting little credit at the
East for having knocked out a bruiser. There really
should not be much glory attached to the fact of one
iUman's being a little huskier than another.

destinies of the Southern Pacific know no
equal. When relaxed from the cares of
transportation and traffic they might all
have their measures taken for a model
suit of affability. If you must see them
on anything outside of the pale of busi
ness the best time is immediately after
lunch, when the inner man is satisfied
and the taste of the cigar still lingers.
The person who supplies both the tragic
and the comedy element of the following
story did not know this and now he is
not on visiting terms with the "yellow
building." He was only a small boy and
should have been pardoned, but the in
exorable custom of the company knows
no pardon in these cases. The boy came
to the Southern Pacific with every recom
mendation for good conduct and great
mental potentialities. He was according
ly assigned to Mr. Richardson, master of
transportation. In two days the boy had
so completely absorbed the peculiar busi
ness of Mr. Richardson's office that the
head of the latter feared displacement, so
he displaced the boy. The boy was then
assigned to duty at the freight building
at Fourth and Townsend and there began
to mount the ladder which in his dreams
ended in the office of the master of trans
portation. Some time after this the em
ployes of the various departments had a
meeting in the "yellow building" which
the young man Was given leave to attend.
It was for the organization of some in
surance society among the lesser em
ployes', and the boy. primed for the occa
sion, dressed himself in his very best
clothes, with a glowing necktie to produce
a climax. Once again in the "yellow
building" he thought it was no more than
duty to call on Mr. Richardson. The
thought was father to the act, and the
next instant found him in the office. Mr.
Richardson arrived soon after and he
found the young man breathlessly await
ing him. There were stacks of business
to attend to that morning, and Mr. Rich
ardson was very anxious to get at it. The
boy inquired about his health and told
of his progress and his expectations. The
magnate listened. Then came an inquiry
from him what the nature of the business
was on which the young man had come.
The young man replied: "Oh, I didn't
come on business. I just came to pay a
sociable call. I knew you would be glad
to see me. Now let us talk of something
besides business. That's so common
place." Mr. Richardson became epigram
matic and the boy departed.

hits Informant With tncfj a
â  â . .â â¢ ;,â > doubt of thei ac
curacy of the statement, for it is through
that office that the -movement* of froops

The statement ey< n went Â«o far as to in
t.: with the reinforcements
fÂ° ''â  'â¢>: i ched to General Shafter, but
It taay be that Shafter Will not need re
inforcements by the time, the regiment
fly for Bervice. Iri which/event it win
probably be. â  used in the' " operations
against Havana. ... Â â¢'â¢ :
To man;- it seems nonsensical a
foolish waste of money for the Govern
ment to send a Xew York regiment across
the continent for service in the Philip
pines, and at the same- 1 time move the
California command East and to Cuba,
for the .transportation* of 1200 men 3080
miles Is an expensive affair; but the ad
ministration is justified in the undertak
ing for numerous reasons. In the first
place it Is the belief that men from dit
ferem sections will fight better side by
aide than a division or a brigade composed
.entirely .of men; from one State would,
for the reason that each .regiment would
Strive all the harder to uphold the glory
of its Commonwealth. und outdo the deeds
of the others, while, on the other hand, if
one force suffered severely, the others
would lose heart at seeing so many or
their own fellows falling.
Moreover, it gives heads of tha
army a better chance to study the fight
ing Qualities and discipline of G the various
sections when almost every State is repre
sented in one battle and under practically
the same conditions. ; <â 
So -for these, among other reasons, the
gallant Eighth, the picked command of
the California volunteers, will sustain
the honor and glory of the Golden ,StatÂ«
on Cuban battlefields, while the otheis go
to Invade the Eastern 5 territory of thÂ«
Dons. i Â© Â
I Beyond the steady progress made by
the examining Burgeons there has been
little doing in Camp Barrett to-day. The
hot wave struck cam:> with full force,
and the officers have shown much con.
sideration for the men, two hours': squad
and company drill early this morning be
ing all that was required of them. ; :
A furious northwester set in about 1
o'clock this morning which for a time
threatened to demolish the camp. The
terrific flapping of tents, snapping: of
lines and the clatter of tin plates awoke
officers and men. and for half an hour
everybody was busy making things snug.
Several tents were blown down, and but
for the prompt ! action of Captain C El
liott, thn temporary commander, and Ad
jutant Smith a great many more would
have gone by. the board. The wind died
down after' an hour or so, but when the
j men turned out at reveille they found
large quantities of hats, blouses, dishes
i and mess . equipage banked up against
the kitchens on the south line of camp,
where they â¢ had been deposited' by the
'.wind. The gale seemed to sweep from a
furnace and was almost; suffocating.
i- : Some idea of the . heat .may be formed
! when it is stated that at 3 a. m. the tem
i perature registered 85 degrees. . â

â .rendezvous here- no provision was made
for their sustenance, the orders being
to bring two 'days' field rations, which,

could be drawn on. ' 'â .'..- â¢ â¢ â ':
-.It turns out, however, that no stores
can be issued until the men enter the

lies in his" power, by allowing the com
panies to send in requisitions for rations
us soon as .they are examined, instead of
â¢waiting until they are mustered, in. In
this way the men are' beginning to draw

to-day. So far 6JO men have gone' before

Captain W. S. Barnes struck camp this
morning in all the tforgoousness of 7ils
new regimentals, and took command of
Company C. The warm ' weather had a

"|CHEAP JOHN UNIFORMS."
Colonel Smith of the First Ten
nessee Asks for a Board
of Survey.
There Is a protest from the First Ten
nessee Regiment. It is not the wail of
the men because they have not a table
d'hote dinner every day, nor is it the
o!d-time complaint of a lack of blankets.
This time it is Colonel Smith, who has
gone to Major General Otis and asked
for a board of survey to pass upon the
Ohi:iatown-made uniforms that were re
cently issued to his men. These uniforms
were delivered to the First Tennessee
about a week ago, and to quote Colonel
Smith, "As uniforms the garments are
worthless." The entire regiment is com
plaining, and it has a right to, for after
ten days' wear the uniforms issued are
In almost a worse condition than the old
uniforms that the regiment had when it
arrived here.
The uniforms were made under Gov
ernment contract by Hoffman & Both
child, and these particular uniforms that
were issued to the First Tennessee Regi
ment were, according to Colonel Smith's
statements, sublet by the Hoffman <fc
Rothchild firm to Chinatown merchants,
by whom they were made.
A TENNESSEE NIGHT.
Nellie Holbrook Blinnand Gen

unteers at the C. E. Barn.
Last night was Tennessee night at the
Christian Endeavor barn on Fifth avenue.
It was one of those special nights that
have been so successful under the skillful
management of Mrs. Nellie Holbrook
Blinn. Over 700 of the Tenncsscans were
there, headed by their commanding offi
cer. Colonel Smith.
The entertainment was well selected
and appropriate to the evening. Mrs.
Bllnn's recitation of Robert Ferrall's
â¢â¢Welcome to Tennessee," was replied to
by Colonel Smith. The colonel spoke wkli
all the delightful cadence and diction of
the southland, and he was applauded to
the echo.
General W. 11. L. Barnes followed in a
speech full of patriotism. Music by the
regimental band, by Captain John Leale
and his Hawaiian quintet, and by nuin
erous vocalists passed away a pleasant
hour until refreshments in the shape of
good hot coffee and home-made dough
nuts were served.

some of .the- bolder'-ispirited. ones, and
they were infdrmed' that .the firm could-,
â¢not' afford ..to pay any- higher wages; an<T :
that if the girl:? fns.isied' the -goods Would',

: ty-five coata, and that â¢ twenty.-flve was
: considered a day's work, lie Informed.
.the girls that If their 'demand Q-f $1 per
bundle were refused/he would procure
a hall, meet with thehi, and organize
them in the name. of., the Labor. Council.
The. girls readily ngreeld to the proposi
tion, but it wrts found unnecessary to
strike, as. the ilfm agreed to raise their,
wages. The next morning-, however, one
of the â  girls who took -a leading part in
the affair was called into, the superln- .
c tendent's, officer and after- being cjues-
tiohed was told that she might sunmise
. the consequences of calling the affairs of i
the establishment to the attention of i
union men, as the firm woUid not toler- j
ate an Investigation, by representatives ot i
organized labor. She said she Was will- j
ing to take the â¢coritjeauences, 'and : was
accordingly paid off.
This started Mr.. Robbina and Secretary
Rosenberg, nf the Labor Council, to milk
ing an investigation, arid they find that
many girls working in establishments
similar to' Neustadtor .Bros?, are actually
forced into competition with the Chinese,
and they have determined to organize the
-garment workers. A little careful sound
ing has been done, and it is expected that
within tv/n or three weeks there will t>e>

Owners of the Umatilla and
Acapulco Object to the
â¢ â¢ Impressing of Them!
The Umatilla .and Acapulco "arrived
from Pupet Sound and Panama yesterday,
but the Government has done" nothing so
far towarel pressing them Into service.
Goodall, Perftins & Co. say they will not
Kive up. either the Walla "\Valla or Uma
tilla wfthout a struggle, 'and if the. Aca
pulco is taken there is sure to be a roar
from the Mail CompÂ°a,ny. Goodall, Per- 1
kins & Co. reason that it 1 will be" a pe
culiar hardship on them, as their vessels
i are all in the coasting trade, In which
i nothing but American vessels can engage.
i In the case of the Mail Company, It mn
! v 'iarter vessels flying a foreign flag to
i take the place of any of its steamers tak
! en by the Government, but if thÂ« Walla
| Walla, Umatllla and Santa Rosa are tak
! en there is nothing to put in their place.
As matters stand the only steamers that
the Government has are the Puebla and
! Peru,, and as before stated, tho- chances
- are that these two will go out together on
: the l Oth inst.
The ship Tacoma. a large vessel and a

COFFROTH AND
BUNKER HAVE
THEIR TROUBLES.
BY JOE CORBETT.
: Thursday's Bulletin" contained a little
note calling attention to the tact that. Mr.
Bunker was now In full control of ; the.
Ban Francisco club. â¢ Mr. ; Coff roth, the
other half of the team, "was quite sur
â prised on being apprised of the late de
velopments in connection with the new :
â change of manage ineut. and ventured the |
Btatement that If such was the case he j
â was unaware' as to the facts. : Evidently
come -brio not familiar- with the peculiar
â¢workings of this Pacific .Coast " â  League j
'gave the 3 Information to the Bulletin's I
â representative. It averred that it. was !
true. â I am inclined to conjecture; how- j
ever, that many a game will be played '
by the San Francisco club belore one of
.Its managers condescends to vacate; They
'both entertain a similar view of the situa
tion, and being equally confident of their
ability to properly adjust - matters, , the j
â Idea that the team is to-be reorganized !
and placed under one head might just as i
â¢well be. dissipated. Coffroth does not pro
pose stepping out, after all the troubles
land inconvenience this team has' caused ;
him. Mr. Hunker is just as emphatic in j
1 declaring that he proposes a: continuance
In the managerial role," so it may be
readily concluded, from the above ' state
-imejrvts that Messrs. Coffroth and Bunker
iare still and will continue ,to be the sole :
[proprietors of that handsome (at times)-'
'collection' of sinister "stars.." = :.'â '
.' There never can be a change for the
better until half of that team is released.' ,
This assertion is positive. True, if either
: Mr. Coffroth or Mr. Bunker retired,': .the !
(chances for a revival of Interest among
the players would be excellent; yet. re
.cent information, which is positively au
thentic, declares that the prime cause of
all the trouble must be attributed ta the
; two different factions which have ex
â¢listed in the team ever since. the consolida
tion. It appears that Murphy, Monahari ;
end 11. Krug and the other players , who
â  â¢were members of the late California â 
kets.with which organization Mr.'- Blinker ;
'.'â¢was connected, entertain a , silent- con
tempt for Mr. Coffroth and the . players
who comprised part of the defunct Oak-;
â iland-Busnnell-Alert team, but which at
:; present composes the other half of th->
.San . Francisco club, and which .might'
properly be termed the .Co ft roth â¢end..
.â¢the team. " .The Coffroth. section 'is as]
cognizant of the fact as ie 'Mr. Caff roth; â 
' 'himself' that the regard in ; which they,
nre held by the Bunker clique Is <.>f a.de
;Bpicablo'-nature, and .in consequence tier :
turn, so to say, tit for tat. The rela.fiojis-.

GOOD TROTTING
AT THE
OAKLAND TRACK.
It seems a pity that the present meeting
at Oakland does not draw thousands dally
to the beautiful mile track, inasmuch as
the game offers advantages similar to the
running races, save that the distance Is
uniform â one mile. The betting is as un
certain a proposition as the winter races,
and one sees a whole lot of exciting sport
during the afternoon, yet reaches town
early enough to dine at regular hours.
Starter Havey handles the fields with
judgment, and does not tire his audience
by waiting perfect scores ere giving the
word. There Is always a scramble for
place and show money, and many of the
finishes for the first money have been of
the ding-dong variety throughout the
week. Then, too, horses to win have In
many cases had to take- records several
seconds below their last season's stand
ard.
As yet no waits have occurred because
of pulling shoes, breaking harness, etc.,
as used to be the case in the days of our
forefathers, when it was r 'be.st three in
five" and they trotted from noon till sun
downâlor the pool boxâ ln far too many
events. NflW they must train their horses
prior to the race and not in it, When the
word "go'"- .is sounded^ the fight begins,
and the best' ones go right out for. the
money instead of "laying up" so as to .get
the money on In the auctions at the ex
pense of the "suckers."
In the stables are many of the very
â bi st trotters and pacers. Id the far West,
â and mornings at the track one se.es work
outs from i* o'.clock until noo.n with the
homestretch quarter at top speed. There
are ;ilways plenty of railblrds about to
watch them, arid 'very interesting is it to
sit within earsho-t. of.'.a group of old
timers and listen to the things reminis
cent one after another feels off.. Now and
again one sees some horse working to a-
high-wheel, sulky; then the old horseman
gets on his thinking cap arid tells of the
'.'good old days". :of ; Goldsmith . Maid,
Rarus,. Occident,: St. Julien/and the men
-who teamed them. Sometimes there is a
story of a rare killing; : at other times 'tis
some "moonlight trial.'' and one after an
other tries to get first honors as. they, get

THE CHAMPIONSHIP
TENNIS TOURNAMENT
Tho eleventh annual lawn tennis tour
nament: of the Pacific States Lawn
Tennis Association of the United States
Lawn Tennis Association is now in
progress at San Rafael. The warring fac
tions, each determined to have its own
tournament, compromised, and the weaker
gave way to the stronger, with a few
tacit reservations. The first day's work
on the Hotel Rafael courts was given over
to preliminaries. To-day the more lm^
portant matches of the tournament will be
played. . .
The competition in tennis for honors
is not so strong as in former years. The
rivalry between the old Oakland club and
the California club of this city was so in
tense that the members of each would go
into active training for the. big tourna
ment at San Rafael, which' was always
an event of some magnitude, both from
an athletic and a social standpoint. Of
late years the first-class players have nar
rowed down to tour men, two pairs of
brothers. Walter Magee and.. George
Bradshaw are ranked as first-class, men,
but they are just kept out of that class
by the narrowest oi margins- So it is
that the present tournament, from an
athletic standpoint, is not the event that
it formerly was. As far as the merit of
playing goes, the Hardys and the Whit
neys surpass in quality the playing- of any
former, champions. William Taylor, who
for som-e years held the championship of .
the coast, was at his best an inferior
player when compared with these men.
The drawing of the tournament at San
Rafael 'will find, the two Hardys contest
â  ing one another before e.tthef rm-ets his
San Francisco rival, Robert N. .Whitney.
It is never safe to prejudge a tennis
â¢ match 'between the Hardy brothers. Their
playing is of such an even quality that
either is likely to prove the wiriner. Both
Sam and Sumrier have been before the.
public sittee 1891, when they -were young
boys, an.d but seldom have -they" expert
1 enced defeat by an outsider. This year one
I will have to surrender before the final
â¢ round " jof the tournament is reached.
Whether it will be Sam ox Sumner who
I willrne.et Robert Whitney is a matter of
j great uncertainty. " .
â¢ â¢ George Whitney will not ' defend 'the
championship" which he won last year. He
is out -of condition- and has. not been feel-.
.ing w.ell of late. This is. to be regretted,
as 'a 'match, between the winner .of the
'â¢tournament and. George Whitney would
be asplendid exhibition of tennis. Robert
â Whitney is pretty sure, to come out in the
finals. "Though a good pjayer, he" is not
â¢steady, especially -.under the excitement .
of a * tournament. But something may
happen to steady him, and then he will ba
as formidable as his brother" George. â¢
OUR RIFLEMEN

dollars, /to.. say nothing of' the hundreds
of trophies, . medals and' general prizes.
The scores and records made, will be
watched with the greatest interest by the'
local marksmen, for they- hope to- see

their' Winchester fine target rifles with
them, while Young and MeLaughlin- have
! taken their Pope-Ballards. Young, who
is the originator of the Columbia target
which received third choice in the vot
ing contest for a standard target when it
j was scarce a year old, proposes to do
some missionary work among the East
ern marksmen. The Columbia target
has already been adopted by many of
the clubs on this coast, the Northwest
1 and not a few In the Eastern and Middle
States. He will have a hard time to con
vert those who have become wedded to
the standard American and German 25
ring targets. After the shoot Young will
go on a visit to his folks "away down in
Maine," returning about September 1.
From what can be learned it is be
lieved that the others will return very
soon after the festival is ended. While
In the East the California delegates to j
the Bund will exert every effort to in
d'uee the powers that be to bring the j
Bund to this city in 1901, the next time
the festival is held. It is known that
many members of the association are
very much in favor of having the event
take place on the Pacific Coast, and those
who have gone East have been instructed i
to pull all together to accomplish this
end. At a recent meeting of the presi
dents of all of the dozen or more rif !â¢:
clubs of this city the pledge was made
for all to support the movement.
The Call will make; arrangements to
have daily telegraphic reports of the
highest scores in the principal events
during the present festival at Long Islr.;
and, for all of the best shots of the East,
are well known to the marksmen of this
city, and it goes without saying our I
sharpshooters who have been obliged to
stay at home want to see how their' own
scores compare with those we have sent
East and those already there/"
There will be considerable rifle shoot
ing .at the Schuetzen Park, range near San - :

their regular bullseye and medal, con

AMONG THE KENNELS
AND HIGH CLASS DOGS
The local kennel world is much amused
at a contretemps of which F. Van Sickien
Is the victim. The event., which has
aroused the risibilities of the fanciers. Is a
whelping of a phenomenal nature achieved
by that gentleman's English. setter bitch,
Van's Belle. It appears that Van's Belle
was sent to Pleasanton to tfhe Verona ken
nels to be bred to John E. de ; Ruy.ter's
crack English setter dog, Count Glad
stone IV. The union was felicitously ac
complished, so It was supposed, and Belle'
was returned to. her owner. In due course
the expected, happened, and last Monday
Belle became the happy mother of a litter
ofâ Scotch eolliesL Now. our breeders are
In a Quandary. Either English setters are
exceptions to nature's laws orâ well, the
Verona kennels are, anyhow, noted for
their Scotch Collies. Still, it does seem
remarkable, to say the . least, that two
thoroughbred English setters should pro
duce a progeny of Borzois-headed Scotch
collies. Which is it, the lady or the tiger? <
The agitation among the . collie club |
members for holding field trials' it col- j
lies is gaining strength, and it is' probable ,
â¢ that an early attempt will be made., to !
carry the proposition to a successful con- j
elusion. D. \V. Donnelly of â¢ Burlingame â 
will, enter four dogs that have achieved!
local celebrity, by their clever work In j

A meeting of the. San Francisco. Kennel

carried to the. effect that .an ttte present

able to fofmu-late a new set of rules to' be j

These -rules, have been already ' published

the necessary invitations to the country

two delegates and specialty clubs one

FOR THREE DAYS
THE DOGS
WILL COURSE.
The greyhounds continue, to enjoy "dog
days." And while the "muggy" heat of
the Eastern dog days is lacking on this
coast the greyhounds generate consider
able sultriness..
At both parks there will be coursing to
day, to-morrow and on Monday,
At Union Park to-day the stake is an
open feature, comprising- seventy-two
grand performers, and on Monday a con
solation contest will also be pulled off.
At Union Park the performers are un
questionably of high class. The celebrat
ed For Freedom is again entered and is
very naturally picked by the talent to
win out. False Flatterer, though, is in
the game, and "there are others.*'
Arthur Massey has divided his Eastern
s'.ring for this week's running, and has
a portion at both parks. Hot Stuff
should do well at Union' Park; Beauty's
work there is doubtful. At Ingleside ' c
should stray well up into the coin, as the
dogs are accustomed to the park and ap
pear to like the hard going.
Magnet is said to be in excellent shape
for his work at Union Park to day. In
his duys of only a year ago ''excellent
shape" meant a stake for Magnet.
Lady Jane is at Ingleside again to-day
and may be heard from. Lady Jane 13
one of the coming ones. And she'll not
be long in coming. She is fast, close and
clever.
Dave Winders is down from Stockton
again to-day with Arno. Arno is up
against Lady Blanche at Union and
stands as. little. show ac she would. against
a cyclone. .At the same time it's not
Dave's faulty He has done his best at
buying, a dog, but after his usual pro
clivities he wants a good one or none,
. and good cines are scarce
Little Dell will not be seen to-day. Sha
Would have been up again from San Jose
but .she met the poisoner and she was
"his'n." It was . a dastardly trick and
â the peo>etrator deserves lynching.
The Union P;irk managers will inaugu
rate seivera.lmb.re valuable improvements
during the enming week. The hares have
been brought to a wonderfully additional
strength during the past few weeks, and
it is now the design of Mr. Jerome that
every point of the inclosure shall show
perfection.
The winners at Union Park for to-day 8
run down should be as follows: Laurel
wood; Magmt. Blayflpwer, B B, Douglass,
Black Patti, Lord Byron, Forget, Minne
apolis St. (\irlo, Skyball, Jesse Moore,

'â -.â¢.There was the liveliest kind of a row: at
; Howard-street wharf on Thursday night
: over the pbssessio.n'.of the- new steamer,.
-.CUy.'of -i)awson.. recently built for the
â  r Yukon 'and Northwest- Trading Company
;by V/.Ulia-m. Birch & Co. / .- V , -

: comt>ahy;th;r6ugh' their attorneys, Reddy,
Campbell (V- Metaon, ; refused to pa the
balance. due.on . the boat, about $5000. On
Thursday afternoon Mr. Birch, .accompa
nied "by. a half dozen 'sturdy watermen,
took possession of the bout without going
through : any..' legal â¢ formalities. The at?
torneys for the stockholders heard of this.
proceeding, ; and .In turn ; sent Thomas .
Keogh with: a : gang of- men to capture
the boat. A tug was brought.; up to trie
dock entrance to. tow the boat out into
the channel,: but it; was found j the- way
was obstructed '--by- heavy hawsers, so the.
tug was dismissed. " At intervals all' night .
there were battles, for possession "between
the rival parties. Sergeant Flanders and
a squad of men from the. Harbor Police
Station were 1 sent down to keep the peace
and had their hands .full.- 'As soon : as
one party would board, the Vessel: the. Oth
'â  ers would .-attempt .'to eject- them, and
blows were ..freely-, exchanged,: A .second
attempt was; made to- tow â¢ the '. vessel â¢ out
into the stream," and- the ..stockholders'
party stood- ready 'with . axes to cut the
ropes, but a heavy wind sprung up and.
the tide was running: .SO strong that the

the steamer was going -to sail immediate
ly. Then Kimhall Co.. made' : afranf,'<?- ,
ments with the Ala.-ika.7~Yukon Transpof
tatlon company, to connect with' .their-
Steamer James Eva' at St/ Michael; aiia
â¢with that understanding thÂ« "Dirigp-'was
got ready to sail.. Then the : passengers.'
began to kick again because, some 6f:l|iem
â were taking ajong a couple .-pt toils of â 
freight and there was no guarantee thai,
the James Eva could take .It up the rlye'r.
Finally the matter was straightened out
and late last night the Dirigo got: away.
Three of the passenger's of the' Dlrigd
did not depart without interviewing the.
Sheriff's representatives.- In fact, nearly
his entire force must have been on duty
on the City of Dawson and Dirigo'. '. Wil-
Ham Grant â¢ forgot â¢to pay Mrs. 'â  M. K.
Dougan, 238 Kearny street, $250, and he
had to find the money before he was
allowed to leave for the Yukon. He paid'
'up $100, ' and while ho was hunting up
his brother to get the other $150 he lost
. his valise. No trace of it could be found
: and he had to sail for the Yukon with
out it. " ,
At an early hour this morning the
trouble broke out afresh, and Officers Me-.
Grath and Dillon descended on the
steamer and arrested "Bogie" O'Donnell/
a well-known prize-fighter, who is one of
the gang employed by Ready. Campbell
& -Metson. He was taken to the Harbor
police station and charged with using vul
gar language and exhibiting a deadly
weapon in a threatening manner.
The big raft that left A?torla last week
.Is expected here to-day or to-morrow. On
Wednesday o last the steamer Umatilla
pdesed through a number of loose logs'
and lumber. The conclusion arrived at
was that it was the deckload of.-somo
lumber schooner, and when the news
spread along the front many people came
â  to the -conclusion that it was the raft.
Captain Cousins, of the Umatilla, how
â  ever, says that he passed the raft oft
Crescent City Thursday, and that it
was then all right. . Only one tug had
hold of It, and tho supposition was that
the other had run into Crescent City or
come. other port for supplies.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 2, 1398,
warm night Into a hot morning by at
tributing It to the hot air forced over
the mountains from the interior val
leys. The north wind which was pressed
down into the valleys generated ad
ditional heat, which made its escape
over the mountains and into this dis
trict. With the shifting of the wind to
the westward it brought in its wake the
fog which soon had the effect of reduc
ing the temperature.
The two extremes in this city were
strangely accented. At noon there was
not a breath of air stirring. In an hour
the wind from the ocean was whistling
around the corners of streets wherever
it had full sweep. Flags that had hung
listless on their staffs fluttered and
tugged at their halyards and the city
was relieved from the domination of
the sun.

FOR SCHOOL APPROPRIATION.
Richmond Is Early in the Field With
Its Request for New Buildings.
Richmond i? not going to get left this
v.-'t for nri appropriation for its schools
if asking early, and often will do any
pood. The Point Lpbos Improvement Club
that wed so many benelits fur the
people residing fit the valley which has
beÂ© trie one' Of national reputation be-
C&UM ot Its mili-tary fame, has once more
stepped -.'to the front and reminded the
City Fathers that Richmond fs in great
need of better school aceorrimudatUms
than it has at present.. â  , .
.. The if.crt us In Richmond's population
louring thÂ« last four years, has been such
â¢that t,he Bchoo.l 'buildings are entirely in^
\AdequÃ-toto accommodate One-half .of the
Fcho.ol childTPn who are anxious, to at
tend. Asa reÂ»ult of this : 'families' where
thefe were two or more children were
: compeil;ed to. divfde the^day, one portion
of. them goh}g â in the ' forerioah' and the
other In the afternnon In order that- all
of the chlldron might obtain at least
some education rather than no.ne at n.ll.
The Parents'. Club, an organization late
ly started in the Richmond district ;U the
instigation', oif Gebrgfe R. Fletcher, presi
dent of the Point. Lobos Imprdveinent
Club;. has dorif much In bringing to the
notice of the city authorities the'necessi
ties of the place, particularly .on- the'
school question.
A' large building 1b needed In which all
of the grades, up to the High School, can
be taught. Richmond people say they
will hot consent to be treated as a village
in the future.
HIS HEAD CRUSHED.
Albert Williams Killed at the Union
Iron Works.
Albert Williams, a boy working at the
Union Irorl Works, had his head crushed
by some machinery yesterday afternoon,
and death resulted from che injuries.
While there were a number of employes
in the shop near the boy when the acci
dent happened no one seems to know just
how he met his death.
Williams was an npprentice and had
been working with James Hamilton, as
sisting him in running a machine to cut
holes in boiler heads. About 3 o'clock yes-
. terday afternoon the bit with which the
holes .ire.-cut broke and Hamilton took
it to the "blacksmith shop to have it fixed.
Before leaving he stopped the machine
â¢and blocked it up with a piece of wood
to prevent its starting again. On* his re
turn to the machine a half hour later he
found Williams lying on the floor, dead,'
with the entire left -side ' of his head
crushed -and' torn away.
Tho supposition of the men at the. iron
works Is that Williams had been brush
ing' the' Iron shavings from the boiler
head, and in doing thts ho- knocked out
the wooden block, thus starting the ma
chinery. A large arm of the machine
in revolving is believed to have caught
Williams: head and crushed it against an
iron upright of the machine.
â  The deceased was ft boy of 16 years
and lived with his parents at 205 Guerre
ro street. Fie is the oldest of a family
of four childrenâ two boys and two- girls
âand assisted his father, who is an oiler
on a streetcar line, to support the family.
He was formerly a clerk in a store, bu-t
two months ago began to learn the trade
of boiler-maker. .

The best that could be done was to
consume soothing things, such as- ice

CARL HOFFMAN
DISAPPEARS
He Was a Gay Remit
tance Man.
MISSING FOR SEVEN DAYS
RECENTLY BOUGHT A SALOON
ON SIXTH STREET.
Started for the Cliff House Last
Saturday With Much Gold on
His Person, but Never
Came Back.
Carl Hoffman, a dashing young fellow
and a remittance man of consequence, has
disappeared in a manner so mysterious
as to Indicate that the earth has opened
and swallowed him up. He was a com
parative stranger In the city, having been
here only a few months. Being somewhat
overburdened with cash he was Induced
to "o into the saloon business at 10 Sixth
street, which is the old Bavaria saloon.
The partner of the missing man is
Phillip Ful'er. and the firm aa&e Is Hoff
man & Co. The place was opened about
two and a half weeks ago, and a week ago
Hoffman received the usual remittance
from his parents in Ravensburg. Wurt
emberg, Germany. It Is said that he had
been acting rjueerly of lnte. and some of
his friends thought that his mind was fail-
Ing.
However, on Saturday last he put about
$100 In his pocket and started out, saying
that he was going to the Cliff House, anÂ«l
that he would be back by 2 o'clock in the
afu-rnoon. He never came back, and hm\v
foul play Is suspected Oy his friends, ay
they say that sureiy someth&g would
have been heard of him by this time.
Hoffman is described as a young Ger
man of the. blonde type, about 24 y>;trs
ol age, 5 Cteet G or 7 inches in height," with
a soft blonde mustache. He wore a suit
â of light material, had a gold watch and
chain and several rings of value. He was
a college man, and. had traveled exten
sively throughout Europe, Asia, Austra
lia and America.
The suicide theory iÂ» dis-credited by
his acquaintances,, and they say that ho
is not in the habjt of going off on a rte.
bauch in a manner that would cause
him to be lost.
. The strant-'t- part of the affair is that
the matter has not been reported to the
police, and no particular exertions have
been made to recover the lust man,
though he 'is. presumed to own the prin
cipal interest In the business at 10 â¢ Sixth
street. : â¢ â

The soldiers at both Camp Merritt
and Camp Barrett suffered intensely
from the heat. Across the "bay Captain
W. S. Barnes, U. S. V. was in training
for life in the Philippines and suffered
for the glorious cause. His too, too
solid flesh seemed at the melting point
and drops of perspiration chased one
another v.own his florid cheeks.
The recruits who were being initiated
into the mysteries of Lay foot, straw
foot were anything but happy.. Their
heavy uniforms and arms were not
conducive to comfort.
An officer of Use Montana regiment
came into town early in the day dressed
in a service suit of crash, topped off
with a pith helmet. He did not know
of the vagaries of the climate. Late in
the afternoon when the wind blew he
was an object of pit- or ridicule in the
eyes of passers by as he made his way
to the camp in Richmond.
FIGHTING FIRE
AT LIME POINT
The Powder Magazine
Has a Close Call.
BATTERY D'S GOOD WORK
TWO TIRES, COVERING 800
ACRES, ARE EXTINGUISHED.
Another Exciting Blaze Occurs at the
Presidio Last Evening at 6
O'clock â A Welcome
Diversion.
*Â« Yesterday , afternoon while General
Shafter's army was bravely battling
with the Spaniards at Santiago the troops
at Lime Point and at the Presidio were
engaged in fiercely fighting a â â â¢red-hot
enemy in the- shape of fire which, after
a long and hard struggle, they succeeded
In subduing. . < - ' < â  . ,
At about 1:30 the bugle alarm of fire
was sounded at Lime Point, and in a mo
ment the men of Battery B, First Cali
fornia Heavy Artillery Volunteers, re
sponded to, the summons and, under the
command of 'Captain Hay and Lieutenant
Huie, rushed to the scene; a short dis
tance 1 northeast of the camp. 'In some
way the grass had been set on lire, and.
fanned by the * stiff -breeze from the
ocean it was soon rapidly, spreading and
approaching the fortifications. -The men
of Battery B, however, faced the flames,
and with sticks and branches of trees
and blankets whipped' out the fire after,
half an hour's lively fight.' â¢ "
No sooner had they, done this than an
other alarm was sounded, a second lire
having started about a mile and a half
distant, out towards Point Bonita. In a
few minutes it came 'sweeping' over the
hills with â¢ the rapidity and. fierceness .of
a prairie fire, and threatened to -destroy
the tents of the camp and cause: an ex-,
plosion of, the powder. magazine. It was
apparent to all that the situation was seri
ous, and with great promptness Captain
Hay, assisted by Lieutenant Huie, who'
was officer of the day, lined up the men
in front of the tents and around the mag
azine, and took every precaution to pro
tect the property. Meanwhile the . flames
came sweeping on, and then the men,- who
.were under the best -discipline, advanced,
and after a prolonged .and .vigorous, de
fense checked the fire and gradually ex
tinguished it to such an extent 'that no
more danger was. feared: It spread- over
an. area." of about acres and. lasted. over"
two .hours and a naif , burning, itself out.
at about 4:30. -It 'was a. very close call; licit
only" for the. tents, but for .the powder

'.At- about 6 o'clock in the evening the
troops 'at the. Presidio had a somewhat'
similar experience. T.he grass and brush
on.' the hillside near the. Jackson-street
entrance had â¢â â¢â  caught fire: and '.when" dis
covered the blaze had mad g considerable
way down the hilli At- the sound ..of the
bugle alarm every, uno of. 1500 soldiers, .
both at Camp -Miller and at the' Presidio
post, sprang from the dinner â¢ .table in â¢
answer' to â¢.the, summons. In a moment,
under the orders of .the .*. officers; they â¢
formed in double, column; 1 and were soon
,on -the', double-quick up the .-hillside.- It
â was an exciting scene, and .reminded one

" Dear Zilr.s. Pixkham: â I cannot be-

that I couldhardly walk across the floor
without falling. I had womb trouble
. and such a bearing-down feeling ; also
suffered with my back and limbs, pain
in womb, inflammation of the bladder,
piles and indigestion. Before I had
taken one bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's

better, and after taking two and one-
half bottles and half a box ,of your

take your medicine they would Dot
have to suffer so much."
Mrs. Joseph Peterson, 513 East St.,

"Dear Mrs. Pixeham: â I have suf-
fered with womb trouble over fifteen
years. I had inflammation, enlarge-
ment and displacement of the womb.
I had the backache constantly, also
headache, and was so dizzy. I had
heart trouble, it seemed as though my
heart was in my throat at times chok-
ing me. I could not walk around and
I could not lie down, for then my heart
would beat so. fast I would feel as

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July . I.â Wheat started firm on
crop damage reports. The latter were around
on the sidewalk before regular trading com
menced and crowded out of sight .the decline
with which Liverpool started. The opening for
September was at from CS?Â»Q6S%c, as compared
with 68*40 at the close last night and after a
slight reaction to 6SVÂ»c it became difficult to
buy much except by bidding up the price, sel
lers being scarce.. Some of ' the crop reports
were quite alarming, some sections reporting
ft. total loss. Later it was claimed It was true
as to large sections of crops In the best wheat
lands in the south. The market was run .by
these reports* there being nothing else of a
df-cidedly bullish or bearish character |In the
news of the day. ' Prices continued to advance
until July reached 77'; c. a gain of 4"-f ana
September advanced 2c, selling at 70% c. There
were a good many reactions on the way up and
the trade at times became rather excited. One
important reason for : strength was the great
desire of â  shorts to cover pending - the : three
days', .vacation â¢in connection with the I uncer
tainty of crop conditions and the possibility of
a wild bulge In the meantime. . = Speculation

DUN' REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, July I.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The second quarter of the year 'â â¢loses with
more encouraging returns. Failures have been
a little larger than In the first quarter of the
year, whereas a decrease of 6.2 per cent might
have, been expected from yperlence of the past
ten years, but with that allowance a difference
of only $3,500,000 can be charged to war and
fears of ' war, . whereas solvent payments
through clearing houses for. the 'quarter were
over 600,000,000. In the very best years de
faults range froni an eighth to a fifth of 1 per
cent of such payments, and in bad times from"
a third to a naif of 1 per cent more, but this
year the proportion Is less than a fifth. The
quarterly statement : given to-day, shows ,an
aggregate of $34.498,075, : which is smaller: than
In . the second quarter of any year since ISW,
except 'â  one, and the average of liabilities, de
fault to firms ;In business and to h exchanges

sales since the culmination of speculation in
February has been most remarkable.
The iron Industry shows Borne decline in
prices in Bessemer pig at Pittsburg to $W 25,

$11 25 at Philadelphia lor Xo. 1 anthracite,
while shipments during the week 'have been

the aggregate not large. But contracts for
12,000 tons of steel rails have been placed at
Chicago, and pending contracts there for struc
tural work are estimated at 25.0U0 tons, while
the demand for implement and car material is
still beyond all precedent, and in general it
may be said that the markets west of Phila
delphia are remarkably strong, with scarcely
any indication of decline in the demand for
finished products. Minor metals are quiet. Tin
plates are a shade weaker at $3 SO for full
Weight American, the corresponding foreign
grades growing somewhat stronger.
Failures for the . w.eek have been 254 in the

BRADSTREETS REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July I.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say; In a period as usual devoted
largely to stock taking,, and with holiday and /
midsummer Influences making for a narrow and
unrestricted trade, there is little that is novel
to be fou"nd regarding current distribution. The
first half of the year closed with a very "satis
factory showing in many lines of trade, as evi
denced by- the returns of ba-nk clearances, rail-
read earnings, reports as to the consumptive
and distributive demands, and last but not
least, by that Infallible' barometer, of the-mer
cantile worldâ business failures.' â  .
Harbingers of the future are found in the.
generally favorable crop prospects, not Only.' of '
cereals, but of cotton, fruits and most product.-,
of agriculture, and a continued heavy foreign
demand for American products.
Few important events are chronicled this
week in the business world, The semi-annual
shut-down of many industrial concerns, par
ticularly those in Iron and steel arid glass and
Sunn- textile, manufacturing concerns, has been
announced" to occur in the first week of July,
but this has been without much effe.ct upon the
prices of those staples. Advices from the West,
indeed, lead to the belief that .this shut-down, '
in uome cases, may not occur at all this year,
while In others the time devoted to repairs and
stock taking will be considerably aorogated.
The sit'uatfcn in irori is rather a mixed one,
most complaints t-cmlng from the West. It is
significant, however, that the fall in coast'rail
road rates has been credited with' improving
demand. for. iron and steel for export Â»^"id con
siderable orders have ' beÂ£n already booked,
notably some steel rails for -Egypt arid Mexico,
while orders for 15,000 tons are. reported â  re
fused on account of time limits set.. .Pigiron
and steel rails reflect the lessened activity -in
a shading- of prices. ' Doubts are' expressed as'
to the ability -of the pigiron makers to control'
production, .and the next two weeks will prob
ably be full of interes-t to the Iron' trade gen
erally. The tone of the wheat.- market cori.
tinues bearish, notwithstanding, that the world's
visible supply, has Uec-n-ase.d 13,70U,0W in two
Weeks, and that the probabilities are that vis-
lble stocks of old wheat on August 1 will.be
as low. If not ;lbwer, than last year's, which
were the smallest on record for seven years.
A heavy falling off In the condition of the
Kansas wheat, crop Is indicated.
Rather less steadiness in prices Is observable,
most cereals, pork, lard, .cotton -and several
makes of pigirtn being lower far- the- week,
â¢wliiie the list of advances- is exceedingly small.
S'tead!ri>-ss has been afeature, however, of raw
wools, hides and heavy Leather, coffee, sugar |
and iirlnt ClQths, copper' and -lead. A large
distribution of bleached cottons at price con
cessions has been a feature and the demand Ir>r
fireworks and. Hags this year is conceded to 'be
heuvier in advance of itast years. . â¢
Cereals still move abroad- in quantities un
precedented for. -the time of year. Wheat ship
ments for the week aggregate 4,716,401 bushels.

NOTICE TO MARINERS.
Branch Hydrographlc Offic?, U. S. N., Mer
chants' Exchange, San Fra-ncisco, July
1, IS9S.
Forecast of wind and weather in the North
Pacific Ocean for July, ISSS:
The sub-chart of isobars and Isotherms for
July, which appears elsewhere on the chart,
shows an almost- permanent high of larger area
and slightly farther weft than the one during
June, the center being near latitude 30 degrees
north and â  longitude -ISO degrees ' west. The
trade wind Hmtts extend farther north than in
the preceding month.-
In the zone between 35 degrees and 50 degrees
north gales accompanied with rain may be ex
pected, less frequently, however, than during
June. Out of 2177 observations in that part #f
the ocean included between latitude 33 degrees
north and ."0 degrees north, and lone Hurt? 1?">
degrees west and 145 degrees east, 9 per cent
give a force of wind above 5 and 2 per cent
above 6 (peaufort scale), as against 13 per
:ent and 4 per cent, respectively, for the month
of June. In the China Sea and the vicinity of
the Philippine Islands frequent, rain squalls
and thunder storms may be expected. Squa.iy
weather 'may be expected in the vicinity of the
Hawaiian Islands and thunder storms on tha
toasts- of Mexico and Central America.
â¢Occasional si>iral circulations. â¢â¢ viz.. the
cyclonic (against the sun/, with low barometer,
and anti-cyclonfe (with the sun),; with high
barometer, will be found moving in a general
easterly direction across the ocean.' .Generally,
in front of the cyclonic area, or the low, ths
weather 4s damp, with thermometer rising and
barometer falling, while in front of the anti
cyclonic circulation,'- or the ' high, It is dry,
cooler, and. the "barometer rises. The "average
storm track, traced on the chart shows thai â¢ -'â :â 
"average -path of the centers of these lows.
' o The average low over Asia will have art-,
vanced toward .the coast and deepened, and tha
southwest monsoon may be expected to blow ,
steadily, accompanied by hot. sultry weather.. '-";â 
."typhoons may be expected during this month
In 'the China seas; probably first appearing to
the eastward qr the northeastward of the J
Philippine Islands. â  The paths of a few typical.' â 
typhoons that o have occurred during July in-.: ;
previous J'ears are sh6wn on the chart. â¢ :â â¢
' After crossing tne : line coming north vessels
bound for the = wesf coast of America may ex
pect heavy rainÂ° squalls and thunder storm*,
and also occasional wind squalls in passing
through tho region of the doldrums.
Fog and heavy mist will be prevalent along*. ; '
the' American coast, ptfrtfcjilarl^ Sq n^rth of
33 degrees. North of the t-hirty-flfth parallel,
from the American to the Asiatic coast, occa

Beginning at- 9. o'clock in the morning,

open for business yesterday, there was a

to 3 o'clock, the .'.closing hour. Some lines

business yesterday, there was a good sup
ply of 50,-25, '3" and 1 cent documentary
etampÃ left. The amount sold during the
day was nearly ,C*oo. â 
Restaurant .men and grocers who sell
California and French claret by the bot
tle besieged the office with Inquiries as
to whether they were obliged to place
etemps.on'the bottles of claret which they
"serve to their patrons at 10 cents per-bot
tle or free with meals. Special Revenue
Agent Thomas replied that the value of
the wine cut no figure, and that bottles
of wine given with French dinners would
have to be stamped equally with cham
pagne or Lachrima- Christi.-at the rate of
a 1-cent stamp for every pint bottle ana
2 cents for every quart bottle every t-imo
it was refilled. In answer to the "ques
tlun whether wine could be served -or sold
In glass pitchers and similar .vessels other
than bottles without being stamped, Mr.
Thomas said that the tax was only on
bottled wine, and that .restaurant men
and grocers could sell It in glasses, tin
measures or pitchers without any stamps.
He further announced "that he had writ
ten to Washington for information as to
whether a demijohn can be considered as
a bottle. n Mr. Thomas is of the opinion
that, a demijohn should not be considered
as a. bottle In this connection, but he pre
fers to have the opinion* of 'the depart
ment. If It should be In favor or the
bottle theory -a 2-ccnt stamp will hÂ«
sufficient-, for a 'demijohn of. 'no matteÂ»
v/hat capacity. Otherwise, wine may too
drawn from Â° a barrel .into a class or
pitcher and no tax need be paid.
The following circular from the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue at Wash

WOKE THE POLICEMEN.
Did Not Heed the Sign Telling Him
to Keep Away.
OAKLAND, July I.â David Barry will
hereafter pay attention to notices which
read "No peddlers wanted" and similar
signs. He was convicted In the Police
Court this morning of disturbing the
peace of Police Officers C. H. Truman and
W. F. Woods, who room in East Oakland.
Officer Woods posted the following notice
on the door:
Don't come up the stairs; don't hammer on
the door; don't try to ring the bell. We work
by night and sleep b- day. We won't set up
for anybody or anything, fire exeepted. By
order of two big policemen. If this will not
suffice we will get a Gatling pun.
Barry is an old man, who makes a liv
ing going from door to door polishing
furniture. In his daily travels he went
to the headquarters of Truman and
Woods. He disregarded . the sign, ham
mered at the door, woke the policemen

THERE WAS NO
DEBT TO COLLECT
MISS CLARK WILL DEMAND
SATISFACTION.
Will Follow Up Her Attack With a
Curtain Pole by an Appeal to
the Courts if Neces
sary.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 1.
Miss Clark, the superintendent of the
Woman's Exchange, intends to secure a
complete vindication through the courts
if necessary, from the debt collectors and
Constable who raided the Exchange a
week ago and arrested her for battery.
Miss Clark admitted driving Constable
Yon Kapff and Attorney Heaton from
the Woman's Exchange with a curtain
pole. Judge Allen, in the Police Court,
commended her stand, but expressed his
regret that she had not made better use
of her weapon.
Miss Clark says that the alleged debt
which the intruders attempted to collect
by snatching her watch and purse has
no. existence, and she will try to collect
damages for the unwarranted trespass
upon the Exchange.
"Some time ago," says Miss Clark to
day, "an insurance solicitor visited me
and tried to induce me to take out a life
policy. I told him I did not desire to
do so, but he was very persistent and
finally assured me that 1 was taking no
risk in signing an application. I signed
what I believed to be a forma â¢ applica
tion for a polk-y, bur which 1 was as
sured made me rcbpynslble for no pay
ment. Some time later these debt col
lectors visited me and assured me that
1 had signed a note for a certain amount,
of money. I denied having done so, but
they persecuted me for several weeks
Finally I understand they brought suit
to recover. Before coming to the Ex
change to levy the attachment, they com
municated with the treasurer and prv;-;
dent of the Exchange and were plainly
told by those ladies that I was merefv
an employe here without any interest in
the Exchange, and that even if I did
owe any money there was nothing at the
Exchange to attach in satisfaction of the
judgment.
"Even after this they came to th.- Ex
change, and nut until they, beeran to
seize everything in sight did I drive them
off."
The ladies on the board of directors of
th.- Exchange believe that their super
intendent has been very unjustly ami Il
legally dealt with, and they have caused
it to be known that they are prepared
to give her moral support in vindicating
her rights.

REALTY INVOLVED.
Henceforth the Actual Value

Stated.
With the issuance of the Internal reve
nue- stamps for the collection of the
various taxes placed by the Government
upon- the- business men of the community
has come a. general, although not ex
preFseu, dissatisfaction.
The insurance and real estate brokers
content themselves -with the fact that
money collected from them personally will
be paid by those with whom they deal,
and. consequently such an act of govern
ment is to be applauded and not decried.
To oppose the tax, especially as it is for
the good of the country, would be incon
sistent in the extreme, and would have a
tendency to conflict with the principles of
patriotism. Although the Insurance men
contemplate a partial payment of the gen
eral tax, the real estate brokers are
sanguine that, as far as they are con
cerned, the money expen -ed by them in
the purchase of the necessary stamps will
be in tho long run returned by the pub
lic.

FEATURES OF
THE FOURTH
Money Assured for City
Hall Decorations.
THOUSANDS TO BE IN LINE
MILITARY MEN ARRANGE THE
DETAILS OF THE BATTLE.
Exercises at the Macdonough Theater.
Line of March Is Laid
Out by the Grand
Marshal. i
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 1.
The arrangements for the Fourth of
July are now complete. This morning
Grand Marshal Webb Pearce anounced
that the line of march will be from the
foot of Broadway to Sixth street, thence
to Washington, to Fourteenth, into Broad-
Way, down to Seventh, where it will
countermarch and proceed out to Twenty
fourth street, where the reviewing stand
will be stationed.
The parade will start at 10:05 a. m. and
all organizations are expected to be in
line at 9:30. The committees are all busy
taking the necessary precautions to see
that their plans are faithfully executed.
The City Hall will be decorated and
the nagging between Councilmen regard
ing the small fund required is ended.
Councilman Earl telegraphed to Presi
dent Heitman, who is now out of the
State, and the latter consented to vote
for the necessary appropriation. This
insures a sufficient vote to pass the bill
for bunting, flags and greenery, and the
work of beautifying the municipal barn
has been commenced.
The military authorities are taking
great interest in the sham battle which
will be fought in the afternoon on Adams
Point. The plans for the attack and de
fense are very elaborate and will be car
ried out by 2500 soldiers.
The parade committee has not yet re
ceived a reply from Governor Budd, but
there is a firm belief that he will- accept
the invitation to attend the shajn fight.
It has been decided to hold the exercises
in the Macdonough Theater. Captain
Witthorne of Tennessee, a brother of the
Congressman, will be one of the speak
ers. . '
The finance committee is receiving lib
eral support, and there will be no possi
bility of a deficit.
The Mexican War veterans will assem
ble at the City Hall and will be provided
with carriages. Mayor Thomas is mak
ing another effort to secure the Wyoming
Battery for the parade. A yacht gun
will be placed at the foot of Broadway
to fire salutes,, and it is probable that
the Eighth Kegiment at Camp Barrett
will take part in the celebration.
Company A, Fifth Regiment, has been
acc< i'ied by the committee, and will do
sentry duty at the battle ground.
Asks a New Franchise.
OAKAXL, July I.â The Oakland Tran
sit Company has changed its application ;
for a franchise at Eleventh and Oak
streets. The company asked for a rig.ht
of way from Broadway to Oak and down
Oak to its existing tracks on Eleventh
street. This route would make a very
dangerous curve at Eleventh and Oak
estate brokers to record the actual
amount and value of every deed record
ed and filed in the city archivesâ a cus
tom which has heretofore been abso
lutely Ignored. Every deed made, trans
ferred or filed must of necessity set forth
and state the exact value of the deed re
corded, in order that the proper Govern
ment tax may be collected upon it in
proportion to its true value. Heretofore
the value of a deed has often been
placed far below its actual worth, in or
der to delude the Assessor and escape the
tax which would result from its exact
appraisement. Deeds have been recorded
below their value by a joint agreement
by the real estate broker. and the person
involved, the former being remunerated
for the work of filing the deed and main
taining silence with the usual considera
tion, dictated by custom, of $10. The
only possible lo.ss that' the real estate
men seem to discern, as a consequence
of the tax, Is in the sale of property and
the collection of rents, including various*
other minor transactions.
The tax collected on rents is regulated
and depends solely on the extent of time
and the value of the collection. Ordi
narily the sum collected on a rent of $50
is placed at ten cents, which the broker is
compelled to defray out of the commission
he receives for collecting the money.
Unless the Government stamp is affixed
to every receipt given or taken, such re
ceipt can be declared null and void. As
a consequence of this fact the Revenue
Collector's office was deluged yesterday
by hundreds of applicants, eager to get
possession of the legal forms in order to
carry on their business. Long before tho
demand was satisfied, however, the sup
ply was exhausted, and in order to make
up the deficiency, 2-cent stamps were is
sued, which are to be used in place of
the war stamps until the receipt of an
other supply;
BASEBALL NINES PUNISHED.
Santa Cruz and Fresno Heavily Fined
for Squabbling Over Last
Sunday's Game.
A special meeting of the executive
committee of the Pacific Coast Basebn.ll
League was held at the offices of Pres
ident Bert in the Clunie building last
evening to consider the disputed game at
Fresno on Sunday last between the Fres
no and Santa Cruz teams. The entire
board of ofllcers and all the members of
ttte executive committee were present.
A large number of witnesses were ex
amined, including the captains of the
contesting teams and Umpire Burleigh,
who officiated. Affidavits were also pre
sented, and a petition numerously signed
by residents of Fresno was read. Upon
the conclusion of the taking of testimony
the executive committee held an execu
tive session, upon the conclusion of which
It was announced that the management
of the Santa Cruz team was fined $100
for leaving the grounds during the eighth
inning, and before the conclusion of the
game. The Fresno team was lined $25
for not using the official umpire desig
nated by the president, and an additional
$75 for not settling promptly with the vis
iting team.
Jn an interview last nlgh^ President
Bert said: "This business of teams leav
ing the- diamond before the conclusion of
the game must be stopped. Baseball play
ers have no right to quit under any pre
text before the end of the game after the
baseball loving public have paid the price
of admission with the expectation of
seeing a game. 1 have instructed Mr.
Stevens the secretary of the leagues to
notify the management of all the teams
in the Pac'lflo Coast League that if a sim
ilar offense Is committed again during the
season I shall expel the captain of the
offending team and fine every member
of the team quitting. If I am not sus
tained in this action by the manager of
an offending team I shall deem .such con
duct sufficient justification to forfeit the
franchise of the offending managers. I
think BUch a course Is but Justice to the
baseball loving public who support the
national game. My reason for expelling
the captain and simply fining the other
players Is that no team will leave the dia
mond unless ordered to do 30 by its cap
tain, but there ought to be something to
prevent disgruntled or dissatisfied players
from leaving the field and disappointing
the audience."
because that block is one of the most
thickly inhabited in the city, there being
a score* of families facing the two sides
that would make the turn. This matter
has been called to the attention of the
company and it has altered its applica
tion so that the franchise asked for will
go down Twelfth street to Fallon; thence
to Eleventh street and across the tres
tle. This is a much safer route, will meet
with no objection from residents and will
no doubt be granted by the City Council.
Estates Appraised.
OAKLAND, July I.â The appraisement
of the estate of Jane Easton was filed
this morning. The estimated value Is

Fire on Eighth-Street Bridge.
OAKLAND, July I.â Fire was discov

car of the East Oakland road came along
and succeeded in checking the tire until
a chemical engine arrived and finished
the work. The fire was probably caused
by children and fireworks.

TELLS HARD TALES
OF HER HUSBAND
QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF
MARITAL SORROWS.
Mrs. Kleupfer Files a Suit for Di
vorce and Charges All Manner
of Cruelty to Herself
and Children.
Oakland Office San Francisco Gall,
90S Broadway, July i.
David Kleupfer has been made the de
fendant in a ivorce suit. A lew weeks
ago Kleupfer was suing his wife, Lucy,
for maintenance, on the ground that she
was rich and he did noi have a cent.
His^wife won the case. Now she alleges
that for just a quarter of a century she
has been subjected to cruelty and abuse
from her husband. They were married
during the Civil War, and for about ten
years they apparently lived happily. In
ISM the .wife avers that her husband
struck her with his fist and threatened
to break her head with a bureau drawer.
Two years later he modified his cruelty
by attempting to cut her throat.
Still later Mr. Kleupfer chased his eldest
daughter out of the house, after which
he proceeded to threaten his wife with a
shotgun, and, she says, would have killed
her but for the interference of the chil
dren. Still later, while living on the
wife's ranch in Brooklyn Township, the
husband again threatened to sever her
head, as well as that of her eldest son.
There is one allegation which is cer
tainly up to date. In June of 1885, Mrs.
Kleupfer say? her husband was Chasing
their daughter with a brick. When the
wife remonstrated, the complainant says,
"he dropped the brick, drew a knffe and
advancing like a Spaniard threatened to
kill her." The peculiarity of this is that
he was only prevented from carrying out
his design by a Spaniard named Frank
Garcia, the .hired man. Butcher knives,
clubs, broken teeth and other adjuncts
to matrimonial unhappiness figure freely
in the complaint. . .

least 1000 guests. With this large num

USED OTHER NAMES.
Healer Francis Changed His Title to Suit
His Circumstances.
Healer Francis, whose ministrations are creating so great a sensa
tion among the residents of Oakland, has found it convenient at vari
ous times to use other names.
Thus he has been known as Dr. "W. Prank and Dr. Francis Warnon.
During his last stay in this city, terminating In March, he had hum
ble apartments in the Prescott House, an unfashionable hotel on
Kearny street a..d Montgomery avenue. The people of the hotel have
a lively recollection of his sojourn with them. They say he lived by his
wits then, and intimate that he was preparing himself for the field of
endeavor in which he is now a worker.
He was a tireless reader of the newspapers. He studied both the
news portion and the advertisements. He answered many want adver
tisements each day, and as a consequence had many visitors. He al
ways posed as a wealthy man, awaiting an opportunity to invest in
some mine or other business enterprise.
Within the knowledge of his former acquaintances he never made
a purchase, always finding some loophole through which to escape if
the vendor proved too insistent.
Even in those days he practiced the art of healing on his friends.
He was not successful. On one occasion he made mysterious passes
over a man's head to relieve him of a headache.
The trouble did not end and the healer's patient blandly told him
he took no stock in such practices. He was chided for his lack of faith,
but was never again us/id as a subject.
"I think he. was a fraud," was the laconic summing up of the man
yesterday.
When he first went to the hotel he was accompanied by ' a young
woman whom he introduced as a "patient." After a time he intro
duced her as his wife.
The healer takes issue with the members of the Christian Alliance.
He affirms that their stories of his having been a seller of silver plate
polish have no foundation In fact. "As to persecution, we do not heed
it," he said yesterday. "To men conscious of self-integrity it has no ef
fect." '
The primitive tent in which the meetings have been held will be re
placed by the Exposition building in order to accommodate the crowds
that are attracted.

REFUSED TO
LEAVE HIS
WARM COUCH
Inhuman Treatment
of a Soldier.
CUT IN A SALOON ROW
TAT O'DOOLIN DENIED PROPER
MEDICAI* ATTENTION.
.Assistant Police Surgeon Bunnell
Is to Be Hauled Over
the Coals for Hia
Conduct.
;' During an altercation In a saloon at Mc-
Allister and Fillmore. streets early yester
â  day morning Patrick 6'Dooliii; a. member
: : of Company X, Twenty-third Massachu
setts, was stabbed three times in . the
. . fcreast. Immediately after the cutting his
'"â¢ murderous assailant ran 'from the- saloon
Â»nd made his escape. â¢â¢'; â /.'. â  ' > _. 'â ''.. ' .
â¢;â â¢â ;â¢ The wounued soldier was. subsequently
taken to the Receiving Hospital by th?
..sergeant of the company, who met him
â¢'Â«. short distance from the saloon. As they
â¢ entered the hospital they were met by. a
young man named" Hopper,' who is em
ployed as janitor around the City Halt
'â¢Hopper was engaged in mopping the floor
â¢â¢â of the hospital when the wounded soldier
and his companion appeared. . After cast
ing aside the mop which be was using
â¢. Hopper escorted the injured soldier to the
. epe-rating room. .
On learning that the unfortunate man
" sad been si-abbed Hopper at once notified
Assistant Police Surgeon Bunnoll, who
â â â  â was reclining in a bed In.th e sleeping
â¢ apartments of the hospital doctors. when
â¢ informed that the patient was a soldier
Bunnell ordered the Janitor to dress his
â wounds. â  â 
"Without oven washing the dirt off his
iiands Hopper, who has a slight smatter
ing of surgical science, having attended
. the Cooper Medical College, proceeded to
. examine the cuts in the soldier's breast.
Notwithstanding that . o.'Dnolin com'"
plained of pain in the region of the lung.
Hopper merely washed the wounds, after
telling him that he was .not seriously
â¢hurt. The sergeant who accompanied
him severely criticized the treatment ac
corded the wounded private, and imme
: diately took him to the damp hospital,
: where he was properly. treated by the sur
â  geon of the company. â â  â¢ â¢ â¢.â¢
Dr. Bunnell explains his action by say-
Ing that Hopper failed tp- inform him of
the nature of O'Doolln's wounds.. Several
bystanders, however, distinctly heard the
janitor tell Kunneli that the soldier- was
suffering from three knife wound*, which
. needed immediate attention. Despite the
... â¢warning Bunnell, rather than leave his
. comfortable quarters, ordered Hopper to
dress the wounds. -\ . 'â¢â¢ ..' . â¢'"â¢'.'
â¢ It is not unlikely that the : conduct of
: the Assistant Police Surgeon will be called
to the attention of the Board of Health
by the sergeant of the company. He. is
considerably vexed over the treatment ac
corded O'Doolin. and threatens to make It
very Interesting for Bunnell. : - .
BOXING CLUBS MUST
PAY HEAVY LICENSE
SUPERVISORS TO SHUT DOWN
ON ISSUING PERMITS.
Manhattans Severely Criticized for
the Manner of Handling Fights.
Ne-ws of Other Clubs.
A great deal of adverse criticism was
heard at the Manhattan Athletic Associa
tion's boxing exhibition on Thursday I
evening from many hundred flght-goere
â who sat in a hot-house atmosphere wait-
Ing for the club management to conciliate
the men who were to furnish the even- ]
Ing's entertainment. Jimmy Anthony :
caused the first wait by refusing to go
on until assured he would receive the full
amount of the purse offered. As this â â¢
xould not be given him he very wisely
concluded to drop out, arousing great dis- !
appointment among the impatient crowd.
Lon Agnew followed his example in do- I
znandlng a full purse, and the manage- j
onent had 10 accede to his demand, as he '>
â was to participate In the event of the
'evening.
Jack Granfleld of the San Francisco
â Athletic Club and Billy Otts of the Ex
â â celsior Athletic club will have another
ichance to prove which is tho cleverer
ftmxer on July 11. Both boys have been
'matched by the Alpine Athletic Club,
â¢and judging by the slashing "go" they put
up at their last meeting there will be
?plenty of fighting when they again come
together. E. Dahl and Jim Oioole will
meet on the same evening at catch
-welghts.
The Merchants' Athletic Club has ar
ranged an interesting programme for to-
Tiight. Billy Otts and Johnny McMahon
Trill meet Is an eight-round go, and Morti
mer Myers, C. A. S. C, and Joe Hayes,
J. A. C, will fight six rounds for a valu
able trophy. Other prominent boxers
;will exhibit their skill.
Gus Koster will meet George Riccoml i
'â in a six-round bout before the San Fran
mlaoo Athletic Club on next Thursday i
evening, for the heavy-weight champion
ship or the coast. J. Dean and Willie
[jDlrks will go six rounds, and Alex Gng
[yains will box Frank McConnell, who re- i
[cently defeated Charley McKeever, and
â who Is now matched with Tommy Tracy.
Supervisor Delany is opposed to ama
teur organizations charging admission to
their exhibitions, and yesterday, at the
meeting of the Health and Police Commit
tee, asked for the recall of permits given
to the various athletic organizations al
ready mentioned In this column. This
â course was favored and will be reported
back at the next meeting of the board. .
â¢The committee will report adversely on
the requests of the Golden Gate and
Western Athletic clubs for permits to
hold boxing exhibitions. The Mission and
Excelsior clubs will be allowed to bring
oft their fights if, in addition to their
licensps, which amount to $IDQ in each
case, they each contribute $100 to the Red
' Cross fund.
At a meeting of the Mechanics' Athletic
Union, U. S. A., held last Tuesday even-
Ing, it was decided to hold a horseshoe
ing contest at Central Park, commencing
'Saturday. July 80. Thomas D. Carroll,
'superintendent of the union, was author
ized to go ahead and make all arrange-
jments for the same. There Is great en
;thusiasm among the horfoshofcrs of tHe
[city over the prospects of a contest, and
several entries have already been made.'

Mrs. Lulu Kessing, 735 Eddy street,
t:Â«wore to a complaint In Judge Mogan'.s
i court yesterday for the arrest of Joseph
HHenuerson on a charge of impersonating
'an officer. She said that on. June 28 Hen
i derson called at her house and repre
isented that ho was an officer. He accused
her of stealing a trunk containing $3000
â worth of diamonds and defrauding a ho
tel keeper in the Mission out or three
months' board. He insisted upon search
ing the house and creating a disturbance.
Before he had gone she recognized him ;uj
a relative whom :=ne had not seen for
years. His accusations wore false.

DAVIS' MEN
ARE FULLY
AWAKENED
Working Hard to Beat
Dr. Pardee.
NEW CANDIDATE APPEARS
NO COUNTY OFFICIAL HAS ANY
TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE.
Supervisor Church Pursues His Own
System of Politics, but Is
Not Therefore Less
.. v . Active.
Over in Oakland the supporters of Mr.
Davis have prepared for active fighting
and are putting new life into the struggle
between the two Athenians who want to
succeed .Governor Budd.
I For many months the Pardeo cohorts
| have been, in evidence.. They bave nuver
j lost an oporttinity. to show themselves,
! and if ever they have missed a chance to
Shunt It Is not on record. Now the con
! servative element In the Republican party
In this county Is awake. In nearly every
campaign this element is slow to act and
tin' result of its aotioni? is always subject
for speculation. Sometimes the shouters
bave won, and sometimes they have found
( tht.-ir tallies on election nlÂ«ht so far be
i hind those of the conservatives that they
! were at a loss to explain how it happened,
1 What will be the result this year cannot,
I of course., be predicted at this time, but
! the two men will undoubtedly divide the
delegation for neither has tho remotest
â  intention of quitting.
Within the pa,Â«t few days Davis demon
' stratit>iis have been held at Elmhurst.
i AlamtHia. Second and Fourth wards, and
I at each gathering reports are made of the
; gains shown by the club rolls. Since the
I Republican League convention In San
' Francisco a month ago, the Pardee boom
! ers have not been so much In evidence,
I and now that the Davis managers are
! tjyt-tematically going ahead, it is mislead
! ing and untrue to convey any other im
j pression than that each man seems to
I Lave an equal hold on the county.
All the scramblers for county offices
tumbled over each other to get aboard
the Pardee band wagon. an<l this Bdlfish
I effort on their part did not help the doc
! tor in the eyes of the conservative ele
ment that Is now tuning up the Davis mu
sic. A few days ago both gentlemen
openly declared that they were not in
tending to make any combinations with
any other- candidate and this has caused
i some of the county politicians to do a
great deal of thinking, because the loy
alTy t)f the majority of them to Dr. Par
dÂ«e wad measured by the amount of sup
i port they would derive in return.
There is. a disposition in certain qnnr
ters to break up the' self-nominated ticket
i that emanated from the county buildings
some time ago. Thomas Robinson, who.
is at present a deputy in the office of
Assessor Dalton. Is gradually increasing
In strength (nr the nomination of Tax
Collector, which office is now filled by
James B. Barber, a candidate for re
election. A. K. Grimm of Berkeley is
making a very careful campaign against
Recorder Spear of Berkeley for that
nomination, and little by little some of
those who were formerly supposed to
support the incumbent are gradually let
ting it be known that Mr. Grimm's
chances are not to be slighted. In this
miinner many other canu. dates are being
put up and thrown down, and in order
to prevent the Oaklunders fram doing
too much scheming, it Is reported that
| Barber and Oscar Rogers, who wants to
be Sheriff, have combined in Alameda. As
that city sends the largest single dele
gation to the convention, it can afford
to do a little talking, though It Is gen
erally conceded to be impossible for It
to nominate Oscar Rogers and Barber In
the same convention.
As an example of the truth of the say-
Ing that there are "politicians and poli
ticians," tne case of Supervisor Church
may aptly be mentioned at this time.
Mr. Ch'-rch's term expires this" year and
he is a candidate for re-election. So far,
however, he has not caused his name to
he given the slightest publicity. When
the Fourth Ward Republicans organized
a week ago Mr. Church was one of the
leading factors, but no "Davts" or "Par
d< c" club was created, but simply the
Fourth Ward Republican Club. Church
Is making as keen a campaign as he
knows how, but he Is not doing It on the
surface. In which practice he contrasts
very strongly with the rest of his breth
ren generally dominated as the "county
machine."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATTIKDAY, JULY 2, 1898.
CLOSING IN ON
CONTRACTORS
Garments for Soldiers
Made by Chinese.
THE PROOF IS FURNISHED
CLOTHING DEALERS SUBLET
CONTRACTS TO COOLIES.
A Grand Army Man Gives His Shop
a Chinese Name So as to Secure
Some of This Pat
ronage.
On Thursday evening the Building
Trades Council paused resolutions con
demning Major Long, of the quartermas
ter's department, for allowing the work
of making the garments for Uncle Sam's
soldiers to firms who sublet the con
tracts to Chinese. When the council
passed the resolution its members were
satisfied that even at the present time the
bulk of this work is being done'by Chi
ne-se. In order to furnish proof that their
assertions were correct a committee com
posed of J. Rose, J. Brumfield and C.
Jackson, of the Building Trades Council,
and Ed Rosenberg of the Labor Council,
was directed to make a personal investi
gation of the matter. Early yesterday
morning they called upon Labor Commis
sioner Fitzgerald and asked that the in
vestigation be made official by having
some representative of the office go with
them. Deputies Dam and Green were
delegated to this task. Their work wa*
made lighter by the receipt of. the fol
lowing letter:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 30, IS9S.
E. L. Fitzgerald, Labor Commissioner Dear
Sir: The following- Is the location of Chinese
firms working on Government clothing, with
the list of white firms they get their sub-con
tracts from: ' . â -â¢('.
310 Washington street, Charlie Yen, from
Greenbaum, Weil & Michaels; 1014 Stockton
street. Sine Yen, from Greenbaum, Well &
Michaels; 1002 Stockton street, Sing Yen, from
Greenbaum, Well & Michaels: 1004 Stockton
street. Sing Yen, â  from Greenbaum, Well &
Michaels; 40S Sacramento street, Sam John,
. from Meyerateln & Co and Greenbaum, Weil
& Michaels;. 19 Webb street, Jfm Kee, is also
working on Government work, but do not know
the tirm that gives It to him; 1117 1 * Stockton
"street, Quong Lung is also doing Government
work. I furnish you' this list because 1 am
placed where 1 pee poor women who need work
turned away. This -week 1 saw a poor widow
whoso son is at Manila laughed at when she
applied for work, at the same time 1000 over
shirts were leaving' the factory for Charllo
Yen, 310' Washington street.
Most or all of these Chinese firms are In
structed to put their garments. In cases as
soon as finished and they are that way re
turned to Greenbaum,. Weil & Michaels and
Meyerstein & Co. â 
Greenbaum, Weil & Michaels' address is 17
Sansome street; factory. 631 Mission street;
Me.yersteln & Co. address is" corner of Bat
tery and Bush streets; factory, Stevenson
street, near First. Respectfully, ' 'â ?'â ?".:â 
There Is a very good reason for omit
ting: the name of the writer. The com
mittee and the officers were not long in
learning that the "Up" on the locations
of the Chinese who are doing work on
soldier's garments was correct.- Mr. Fitz
gerald" said: â  "Before, to-day I was at
times a little afraid that the. stories of
the extent of the work done by Chinese
had been exaggerated, but now I know
that no mistake. has been made and that
the writer of this letter is correct and
knows, what he is writing about."
The first place visited was 1002 Stockton
street. Over the door was the Mongolian
sign, "Wing Lung," and inside a dozen or
more Chinese were making duck -trousers
for the soldiers. Hundreds , of pairs of
these garments were scattered about in
all conditions, from the plain cloth to the
fully made garment. Attached to every
one was a tag bearing the initials of the
firm of Greenbaum, Well & Michaels. A
demand was made for the boss, and in a
little while that individual made his ap
pearance. He confessed to â  owning the
name of Jacob Kerminsky, said he was a
Polish Jew and asserted that he was a
member of the Grand Army of the Re
public. He wears the button of that hon
orable organization. A sample" of the
tagged goods and an order for more
clothes were taken as evidence of the fact
that he has the contract and is getting
the work done by Chinese.
': At 19 Webb- street,- the shop of Quong
Yek Lee, several .dozen Chinese were at
work making shirts for Uncle Sam's boys.
Some of the work was a sight to behold,
the seams being either half sewed or sewed
after the â¢ manner .of accordion-pleated
skirts. The orders showed this work is
being.done for Meyerstein & Co. The other
places visited developed a similar condi
tion' of affairs, the work being done ex
clusively .by Chinese. ' " " â¢ â¢
This decided the Labor Commissioner
to make an official investigation, and a
number of witnesses were subpenaed for
hearing In the afternoon:.. The Chinese
confessed to having done considerable of
this kind of work. Leopold Weil of Green
baum. Well & Michaels testified that- he
does not know anything about the busi
ness, the working department being under
the charge of his factory foreman.- Jacob
Karmtnsky acknowledged that he is the
sole proprietor- and owner of the firm of
"Wing Lung," but that' he does not go
under that name. He refused to tell the
names of the firms from whom he receives
the contracts to make soldiers' garments,
and was threatened' with arrest by the
Commissioner, Who has the authority to
compel witnesses to testily in such mat
ters.
The investigation will be continued in
the Commissioner's office at 11 o'clock this
morning. â¢_ ' 'â¢

BEEF BARONS
BOLDLY ACCUSED
A ST. LOUIS DEALER ASSAILS
THE DRESSED BEEF COMBINE.
Government Inspection of Meats a
Farce â Rendered Inoperative
Through Bribery and Fraud.
The cattle producers of the West
have been In conference many times,
the wheat growers have met, the silver
advocates awakened and the industrial
class, composing the labor unions, have
been many times In secret session. The
butchers of all leading cities are meet-
Ing yearly. Why these conventions and
caucuses They are the protests of out
raged society against the arbitrary
control of our markets and against the
unfair tnethods of associated capital.
To be more specific, the hardships
â which have been Imposed upon the
masses, the tyranny of trade monopoly
"which they endure, and the Immensity
ofan Indebtedness which no human ef
fort can. lighten, have all, unawares,
been forced upon them. By years of co
ercion, partly through their own folly
and principally through manipulation,
they have been led, step by step, into
the meshes of monopoly, until now, Hke
caged animals, they chafe like the
ISRAELITES OF OLD AGAINST
THEIR BONDAGE
The cause of this Is to be found In
class legislation or in discriminating
laws and franchises; which have en
riched a few at the expense of the
many, until the few control and dictate
values In every branch of American in
dustry- The combined trusts and mo
nopolies have seized upon power, and
through the abuse of our governmental
ideal of liberty, they have usurped
rights which threaten the pnslave^fient
of the people. The butchers' battle,
through their national organization, is
only a part of the great struggle inau
gurated in the civilized world, and now
fairly begun in the United States be
tween the principle of industrial co
operation, or centralization, on one
hand, and of competition upon the
other. There is no question at all but
what the large dressed beef companies
control the cattle industry of the Unit
ed States, and there Is no question at
all but what they nearly control also
the fresh meat supply of the United
States also. If retail butchers buy
their fresh meats from those meat com
bines, it means the elimination of the
principle of competition, it means one
bid for cattle and one bid for the fresh
beef, and this bid, regulated by the
selfishness of conspirators; it means
one price to consumers, and this price
REGULATED BY THE SAME YARD-
STICK OF COMMERCE.
It means that the beef combination
will continue to pocket the profits. The
retail butcher stands between the pro
ducer and consumer. He represents a
great Industry, and is responsible to
sorlety. If he deserts his trade, his
freedom and independence, what will
be the consideration? He will simply
become the hireling, a distributor of
meats that have been shipped thou
sands of miles, and which has, per
haps, been refrigerated for weeks to
make it tender, and he cannot tell
â whether it came from an infected herd
or not. Right here I will say, without
fear of contradiction, that the Govern
ment inspection Ii w for home trade is
nothing but a farce for the benefit of
the beef barons. I am ready to prove
before a proper committee that thou
sands of cattle have been killed in Kan
sas City, Omaha and other cities that
were never seen by a Government vet
erinary surgeon or a meat inspector,
but, notwithstanding. Uncle Sam's
stamp of Inspection was tacked on the
carcasses to maka our citizens believe
that said beef was Inspected and
THUS DECEIVE THE GENERAL
PUBLIC.
The power of the dressed beef mo
nopolists is such that they can depress
prices at will, as It has been proven
that they have the value of an animal
almost cut in two. This domination re
sults from the fact that they have kill
ed : opposition whenever and wherever
It has developed. The whole cattle in
dustry is cowed. The humiliating' fact
is apparent that the ranchmen, wni:
mission men and butchers will all soon
wear a collar upon which should now
be branded. "Slave to the Dressed Beef
Monopoly." If all the. retail butchers
go into the league, the stock formerly
killed and marketed at home will be
sent across different States to the large
abattoirs. This will result in a double
set of transportation charges, commis
sion and other expenses* and the dress
ed carcass will be shipped back again
for consumption. Do consumers for a
minute believe that they will not pay
for this? The dressed beef company
will first make their profit, the railroad
company makes two profits, the com
mission men and shippers a profit, the
stockyards a profit and the retail
butchers a profit. When the competi
tion of butchers is totally removed it
means a permanently Increased cost of
living, and in return for his home mar
ket or stock killed at home and inspect
ed by the proper meat inspector, a non
descript and unclassified quality of
meat that he can't tell whether it came
from a healthy animal or not, and the
consumer must therefore trust to Prov
idence*
"OR SOME AGENT OF THE
DRESSED BEEF MONOPOLY."
The meat, of course. Is tender, but
the oldest and ] oorest ranch cow would
be tender if refrigerated thirty days or
more. Consumers might as well fill
their stomachs with woody fiber as
with this refrigerator stu/f, as there is
nothing strengthening in it, and it is
without nourishment. Aa stated pre
viously, we have cheaper beef here In
St. Louis and other cities in the West
than in Eastern cities, but I venture
the prediction that in three years after
opposition Is killed, so that it will place
prices of meat in the absolute control
of those dressed beef barons, the re
sult will be manipulated markets. As
to the power of the beef barons, the
butchers have felt it as well as seen It,
and I protest that the public will soon
have a manifestation of It. It is a
humiliating confession, an avowal of
the weakness of our governmental sys
tem, a reflection upon the political
honesty of the age. I refer to our own
Legislature in the year 1889, when our
live stock inspection bill for the State
of Missouri was defeated in the Senate
by Influences and boodle from the beef
monopolists, and which was given pub
licity by the Post-Dispatch. I refer to
boodle report of State of Minnesota,
Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where
the dressed beef lonopolists worked in
the same manner and defeated all
measures for
LIVE STOCK INSPECTION WITH
THEIR MONEY.
Such legislators are practic .lly slaves
to the money powers. Consumers in
the "Western States are not paying* so
high a price for meats as those of the
East. There is yet, to a certain extent,
a competitive market in cattle, which
enables Western butchers to buy the
stock or buy their meats from home
wholesale butchers. It is different in
the East. The dressed beef monopolies
control the fresh meat trade east of
Pittsburg, and all the New England
and Middle States. Meat of the same
quality sells there from 5 to 10 cents
per pound higher than it sells in St.
Louis. Ten years ago the farmer vied
with his neighbor in furnishing the
finest herd of .ttle for the home mar
kets, ai.d they, as well as butchers,
were prosperous. How changed is the
scene. The home market for the cattle
producer has ceased. The butchers of
the country have been driven from their
trade or converted into mere meat cut
ters, distributors or salesmen for the
beef barons, and if this continues a few
years longer and the combine carries
their scheme the butcher will be finally
bounced and the
BOY AND DELIVERY WAGON.
WILL DO THE WORK.
I claim that the cattle and beef com
bine fight not to cripple, .but to anni<
hilate. The cry of the dressed beef men
a few years ago that we had an over
production of cattle in our country was
all bosh, and the cry now of cattle
shortage is all rot. The world market
regulates the so-called market value.
When this market is manipulated and
controlled by cliques, combinations,
pools, trusts and rntion speculators,
values naturally for the time become
I the shuttle-cock of gamblers. That the
j beef barons have and are controlling
' the cattle and beef market was proved
i by Senator Vest and his Congressional
I committee in IS9O, and can be proven
again by a proper committee. It has
been shown, by Philip Armour's evi
dence that they are in a "combine,"
"trust" or company to fix the prices of
beef to the purchaser or consumer, and
they have an agreement not to interfere
with each other in certain markets and .
localities. It can be shown now that
the combine are opening shops to un
dersell and ruin butchers who buy live
cattle. They also have a uniform price
on their beef and pork products, thus
practically destroying all '
COMPETITION AMONG THEM
SELVES. .
Mayor D. R. Francis at the opening
of the first .National Convention of
Butchers in St. Louis in 1886 said: "A
sad day it will be for this country when
i the dressed beef interests are in the
hands of a few moneyed kings." The
time is nearly at hand and apparently
the sad day will soon be here. I claim
that a sad day has dawned on Ameri
can politics whea our legislation. State
.and national, is dominated, guided and
controlled by monopolistic influences.
This is my apology for earnestness in
these matters, and vhen representa
tives of the people refuse redress they
Bhould seek it themselves. The cure
for these evils are: Opposition in all
trades against monopolists; competi
tion in the butchers' trade by the erec
tion of abattoirs in the different centers.
All that is required is intelligent leader
j ship and education, for the industrial
war in this country is more serious and
threatening to the liberties of the na
i tion than was the struggle of our fore
fathers one hundred years ago. The
i struggle was then against the domina
i tion and the taxing right of another
i country, while now It is against the
; domination and taxing power of co-
I operative industrial monopoly. â Chris

LEES' FEEBLE ANSWER.
The Chief of Police Refuses to sur
render Murderer Haynes' Gold.
Chief Lees made a rather feeble an
swer yesterday to the order issued by
Judge Hunt directing him to appear be
fore him and show cause why he should
not be punished for refusing to relinquish
his grip on the money found in the cabin
of Theodore Park Haynes, the murderer
of Lieutenant Burke.
A short time ago Attorneys J. N. B.
Wilson and Eddie Sweeney, who defended
Haynes, secured Judgment against their
client for the amount held by Lees. Not
withstanding that the court ordered Lees
to turn over the money to them, he per
sistently refused to do so. Yesterday he
appeared before Judge Hunt and feebly
attempted to explain why ho would not
let go the sack of gold. â 
He declared that the money was held
by him as evidence in the case of Haynet*.
notwithstanding that neither in the Poli-ce
Court nor the Superior Court was the is
sue of the murderer's gold raised.
After hearing his weak answer Judge
Hunt took the case under advisement un
til next Friday.

The relief committee of the Foresters
and Companions of America met last
night in the Alcazar building to take fur
ther steps in the matter of providing for

cause, and as an earnest thereof several
contributed the sum of $5 each to the nu
cleus fund. It is probable that at the
meeting to be held next Friday a perma
