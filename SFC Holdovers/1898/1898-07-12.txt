SPANIARDS THOUGHT TO BE SNEAKING
AWAY FROM THE CITY OF SANTIAGO
AS COMMODORE WATSON'S SQUADRON WILL APPEAR EN ROUTE TO SPAIN.
SPAIN'S CABINET HAS
TENDERED ITS RESIGNATION
TO THE QUEEN REGENT
Negotiations May Soon Be Commenced to Termi
nate th;e War-Alleged Conditions of Peace
Demanded by the United States.
LONDON, July 12.â The Mad
rid correspondent of the Times
telegraphing Monday says: Senor
Sagasta went to the palace to
day and tendered his resigna
tion and that of the Cahinet. It
is said that he advised the
Queen Regent to appoint a new
Cabinet, largely consisting of
the military element, which
would not necessarily mean the
adoption of a warlike policy, but
probably the reverse.
It is generaly expected that
the resignation will be acoc-pteil,
but the result may possibly b^
merely a partial reconstruction
of the Cabinet. The Ministers are
now in council, and S^nor Sa
gasta has doubtless communi
cated to them an account of his
audience with the Queen Regent.
MADRID, July 11.â It is asserted
that the United States makes the fol
lowing demands as conditions of
peace:
Firstâ The possessions of Cuba and
Porto Rico with a port in the Canaries.
â¢ ndâ An indemnity of Â£48,000,000
(about $240,000,000).
Thirdâ The retention of the Philip
pines as a guarantee of- the payment of
the indemnity.
FALSE RUMOR? ABOUT
OVERTURES FOR PEACE
Dispatches From Madrid Calculated
to Sound the Disposition of
Uncle Tana.
NEW York. July 11.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: There La no foundation for th"
report from Madrid that the United
States has made demands from Spain
.â¢is to conditions for peace, contemplat
ing thi cession of Cuba and Porto Rico,
with a port in the Canaries, the pay
ment of indemnity of Â£48,000,000 and
retention of the Philippines as guaran
tee of payment of the indemnity.
This Was the report sent out from
Madrid last night I was Informed by
a member of the Cabinet to-night that
this Government had made no proposi
tion whatever, either directly or indi
rectly, concerning peace, nor has any
proposition been received from Spain,
either directly or Indirectly.
The only basin for hope of the admin
istration that Spain will soon sue for
peace is the conviction that all classes
in Spain are rapidly being convinced of
the hopelessness of continuing the
struggle. This conviction is based on
the tone of the Spanish papers and on
The San Francisco Call
These terms are regarded as impos
sible.

PREPARED FOR PEACE

don Rennett.
MADRID, July 11.â The papers which
state that peace negotiations arc act
ually going on are not strictly cor
rect. The actual condition of affairs is
being diligently prepared in view of th<;
solution which may bring about peace.
The word "peacf" is written in b'g
letters at the head of the leading ar
ticles in the principal newspapers. Tne
Government wishes peace deeply, and
is Intensely anxious to know wliat
terms the United States are willing to
grant. If America sees the way to
anything like terms which may save
Spanish honor the war is at an end.
If, on the contrary, the terms are harsh
and sweeping, that is, if the American
jingoes dictate terms, their confreres
here will inevitably come on top with
their programme of war. If the mod
erates In America gain the day the
moderates h^re will predominate.
Premier Sagasta, on leaving the
council this morning, in answer to a
information received through press dis
patches from Madrid and other sources
of the sentiment of many leading men
I In Spain.
The report from Madrid that Senor
Sagasta's Ministry has resigned is be
lieved here to make the prospects for
early peace more favorable. It is
â  thought probable that Senor Sagasta
j has stepped out of the way to make
! room for a Cabinet which will nego
{ tiate for cession of hostilities and that
the dispatch from Madrid purporting to
! give demands made by th- I'nited
States was inspired for the purpose of
feeling the temper of th.' United Stat.s
by seeing how such terms would be
considered here.

question, said that the moment had not
come for discussing terms of peace, but
I have the best authority for the state
ment that the Government is in accord
that such time will be ripe when the
impending: fall of Santiago or the sur
render of Manila has taken placeâ in
fact, any further disaster which brings
home to the nation and the army the
hopelessness of further resistance
against the unlimited resources
brought to bear by the United States.
Sagasta is an out and out patriot, and,
according to the words of one of his
Cabinet, has to take into consideration
not only the dignity of the army which
has fought so heroically, but aJso the
future of a large body of Cuban volun
teers, far outnumbering the rebels, who
gave their services to the mother coun
try and who cannot be left to the
mercy of the insurgents.
It is said to be possible that Austria
might be a mediating power. The Gov
ernment knows from inquiries made
that the spirit of the people in the
country is favorable to peace, and the
partisans of the war would quickly be
reduced. In the army the sentiment
is universally in favor of a continua
tion of hostilities. Within four days
the Ministers have placed their resig
nations in the hands of Sagasta, who
has held them over.

WORK MAPPED
OUT FOR WATSON'S
EASTERN FLEET
First of 011 It Must Destroy the
F^emnaQt of the Spanish
Navy.
NEW YORK, July 11.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
All chance of interception of Camara's
fleet in the Mediterranean by the East
ern squadron has disappeared as the
result of the departure from Port Said
to-day of the Spanish men-of-war. The
longer Santiago holds out the longer
Commodore Watson's command will
remain in Cuban waters. The author
ities, however, are making every effort
j to get the fleet ready to sail by the lat
ter part of the week.
The Naval War Board was in com
! munication with Commodore and Rear
i Admiral Sampson last night regarding
j the supplies needed by the Eastern
squadron and the plan it will follow
on its cruise. It is understood the cor
respondence which has passed related
to an increase of Commodore Watson's
squadron. The department will de
termine within the next few days
whether it will be politic or not to in
crease the force, but naval officers in
Washington strongly recommend that
i the fleet be made more imposing and
; stronger, so that it may without any
| possibility of failure destroy Admiral
Camara's squadron without injury to
itself. The need of protected cruisers
such as the New Orleans, Minneapolis
! and Columbia is especially pointed out.
! These ships, the officers say, would be
I especially useful in overhauling and
destroying the swift Patriota and Ra
pido, formerly the Normannia and Col
umbia of the Hamburg-American line,
which can run away from any of the
I ships now attached to the Eastern
j squadron.
An official with whom I talked told
me that the squadron would be kept off
the Spanish coast indefinitely if need
be. Its first work will be to destroy
the remnant of the Spanish navy now
under the command of Admiral Ca
niara, and, when this has been accom
plished, to cripple the Spanish mer
chant marine, to destroy ships now
under construction at Ferrol, Cartha-
Kena and Cadiz, and, if necessary, to
bombard coast cities.
Admiral Camara's destination, ac
cording to information received by the
I State Department to-day, is Carthe
gena.
A dispatch from the American con
sular agent at Port Said anm 'meed
that the battle-ship Pelayo, the . of
the Spanish men-of-war at Poi\. Said.
I left that port this morning and joined
the remainder of the fleet outside the
harbor, and proceeded on its way to
Carthngena. The officials also received
word of the departure of torpedo-boats
from Messina, Sicily, on their way to
the same port. It Is expected Camara's
fleet will occupy eight days in making
the voyage and will arrive at Cartha
gena on Tuesday of next week. It will
be impossible for Commodore Watson
to reach Spain before the early part of
August.
In accordance with the department's
instructions tho Yankee has taken on
board 350 tons of ammunition for the
Oregon, and tho Massachusetts is under
orders to proceed to Hampton Roads,
where sho will await the coaling of the
colllprs now at Norfolk. Thursday is
fixed by the department as the date of
sailing of this portion of the fleet.
PORT SAID, July 11.â The remainder
of Admiral Camara's fleet has sailed
for Spain.
MESSINA. Sicily, July 11.â The Span
ish torpedo-boats sailed for home to
day.
BRITISH CONSUL TELLS
WHY HE LEFT HAVANA
Says His Term Has About Expired
and His Departure Is Not Due
to the War Situation.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 11.â Sir
Alexander Gollan, British Consul to
Havana, was asked to-day why he left
Havana.
"My term In the Consular service has
almost expired, " he replied, "and that
is the reason for my departure from
Havana. I have been tllere eight years,
and now am going home to enjoy my
self. I have not been recalled, nor is
my departure due to conditions in Ha
vana.
"I will say the stories of starva
tion in the Cuban capital are much ex
aggerated. Of course, privations and
want always exist among the lower
classes, and these conditions are inten
sified by the blockade, but tho situation
is not as serious as I have seen it re
ported to be, although hundreds are
dying of starvation."

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY BEFORE SAN
TIAGO, Sunday, July 10, by the Call-Herald dispatch-boat
Somers N. Smith, to Port Antonio, Jamaica, Monday, July
ii. â To-day's attack on Santiago began wiih a premature
volley from the rifle pits. No one then waited for the bat
tery signal. Within thirty seconds, over a distance of five
miles, the batteries belched a hail of shells. There was a sharp
reply of Mauser bullets for five minutes, but this soon died
away and the Spanish trenches were silent. Our guns
pounded on. In twenty minutes we had finished and, the
Rough Riders were cheering in the trenches. Either the
Spaniards have moved out of the city, leaving a few men to
cover their retreat, or they have withdrawn into the city and
are waiting behind barricades. This means a street to street
fight or a continuation of the bombardment. Our dynamite
gun hit one of the enemy's big guns fairly under the lip and
threw it thirty feet in the air. This caused cheering in the
camp of the Rough Riders.

TVITH GENERAL SHAFTER'S
ARMY. BEFORE SANTIAGO, Sun
day night, 10 o'clock, by The Call-Her
ald dispatch boat Somers N. Smith to
Port Antonio, Jamaica, Monday, July
11. â Major General Shafter believes
that the main body of the Spanish
army has abandoned Santiago, and
that it is now fleeinr to the west ward.
It is the expectation as" I write this dis
patch that the American army will he
in full possesion of the city by noon to
morrow. A joint attack by the army
and navy was made upon the city late
this afternoon, and much destruction
must have been wrought by the Amer
ican guns on land and sea. To this at
tack the Spaniards made only a feebl^
reply. Our loss was insignificent. No
really earnest attempt to reduce San
tiago was made to-day. It was the

plan merely to give the Spaniards an
idea of what they might expect when
the American land and sea forces made
thoir final attack in the morning.
During to-day's firing, however, the
dynamite gun did great damage in the
city as did the shells fired from the
fleet from a position off Aguadores.
There is little question in the minds
of the officers of the American army
that General Toral's troops evac
uated the city, wUIÂ« the Spanish com
mander was parleying with Gen
eral Shafter over the terms of surren
der. This belief is strengthened by re
ports from Aguadores, which place has
b,eon abandoned by the Spaniards.
Bands of Cuban soldiers report that the
enemy before evacuating the coast
town placed timbers over their in
trenchments to represent guns.
In my dispatches the fact that the
Spanish commander has authorized his
men to loot Santiago was mentioned.2
WHAT WAR COSTS
THE UNITED STATES
Nearly $100,000,000 Already Paid
Out of the Treasury to Con
duct the Army and Navy,
NEW YORK, July II. â A Washington special to the. Herald says:
Nearly $100,000,000 in cash has already been paid out of the treasury on
account of the war with Spain. It is impossible to obtain an accurate
estimate of the cost of the war for the reason that it is difficult to draw
the line exactly between what would be the ordinary expenses of the
army and navy and expenses directly chargeable to war. However, ex
penditures on account of the army and navy since the passage of the
national defense act have run more than $75,000,000 over the expendi
tures for the same period of last year. The greater part of this was ex
pended for the War Department, the expenses of which have increased
more than $50..000.000. The increase in naval expenditures has been over
$25,000,000. These figures represent the actual cash payments and do
not include contracts on which payments have not yet fallen due, as is
the case with many of the contracts made under the national defense
act. Since July 1 the war expenditures have averaged about $1,000,000 a
day, and it is expected they will run over this amount, when more of our
army is actually in the field, as the cost of maintaining it there is much
greater than in camps.
That news, taken in connection with
General Shafter's belief that the Span
iards have cro-ssed the bay and Ac
now retreating to the westward, caused
great apprehension in the American
ranks. Our troops fear that when they
rapture Santiago they will not take the
Spanish army, too, and they are keenly
disappointed over the prospect of find
ing only an abandoned and pillaged
city.
At the same time the belief is gen
eral that the evacuation of the city
and escape of the Spanish army would
be the most natural tactics for Geueral
Toral to adopt. It hay been evident for
BeveraJ days that the Spanish com
mander realized the hopelessness of hi 3
position, and the contention of many is
that he could make no shrewder :nove
than to cover the retreat of his army
by prolonged negotiations Cor the city's
surrender. General Shatter sant word
to Commodore Schley. who was tempo
rarily in command of the American
â  to bombard Santiago from off
Aguadores to-day. Admiral Sampson
had g>>ne to Guantanamo, anu Commo
ddre Schley, with the Brooklyn, Massa
chusetts and Indiana, took a position
off Aguadores.
These three vessels fired thiz ty shots
into th- Spanish defenses and d.'l some
damage In the city. Commodore Schley
used the big guns of the Beet in this
work. The American gunners reaaily
found the range and their effective
work was a splendid sight to witness.
While the lleet bombarded the city
Cr.-mmodore Schley signaled to General
Shatter asking if he should continue
the work. The answer signaled bacK
was to wait until to-morrow.
The American commander has noti
fied General Toral that the city will be
destroyed to-morrow, when the fleet
will renew its bombardment. All of
the American reinforcements now are
at the txpvt, as is all of the artillery.
It was 4:45 o'clock this afternoon
when the land forces made a feint on
the city. Hinds' battery from its po
sition at the extreme right of the
American line sent the first shell into
the Spanish intrenchments. This was
the signal for other batteries, and Im
mediately thin smoke* swept along the
rifle pits and across the ravine. Ca
pron's battery on the right with
Grimes 1 and Best's batteries on the left
chimed in. For some time the Spanish
batteries made no reply to our fire.
Presently one battery on the extreme
right of the enemy's position began to
throw shrapnel in the direction of
Hinds' and Cai -on's batteries, but most
of their shells went too high.
This fire made a pretty sight for half
an hour, but the men in our trenches
kept up a steady and accurate fire, to
which the Spaniards finally replied but
feebly. They earned to keep close
v.-ithin their intrenchments, and their
volleys came only at irregular intervals
and from various positions. One of the
Spanish batteries quickly was silenced
by a shell from Sergeant Barrowe's
dynamite gun. This shell sped with
deadly accuracy to a point where one
of the enemy's batteries was located.
The range had been obtained from a
study of the enemy's firing, which ap
peared to be lieavy at that particular
point. Our men only can conjecture as
to the damage this shell did, but the
battery fired no more afterward.
After our land firing had been under
way for an hour the reply of the enemy
was so feeble that the order was given
to cease firing. It was dusk by this
time. Supper was served and soon
afterward hundreds of camp fires
flashed along the ridge. Our men
chatted about the fight and made them
selves as comfortable as possible. Our
loss in the afternoon's fighting had
been insignificant and all the American
troops were in good spirits.
General Shafter was at the front dur
ing the firing. As the fighting pro
gressed the American commander, with
Generals Wheeler, Kent and Summer,
was puzzled by the feeble reply of the
Spaniards. They had expected that the
enemy would return a hot fire, and
their failure to do so seemed to confirm
the growing belief of the American of
ficers that General Toral had with
drawn his troops from the city. Dur
ing the early hours to-day the army
lay Impatient in the trenches, waiting
for word from Washington to renew
the attack. Our troops were holding
themselves in readiness to spring for
ward the moment the signal might be
given. Tho day had dragged along
slowly, for the troops were impatient
to attack. None of the soldiers had
â wanted General Toral's proposition for
conditional surrender accepted. They
did not want the Spanish troops to
have an opportunity to peacefully evac
uate the beleaguered city. While the
Spaniards left white flags floating over
their entrenchments, the stars and
stripes were raised over the American
line as soon as the armistice ended.
It is expected by to-morrow six bat
teries, with thirty-six guns, will be in
position to sweep the Spanish lines, al
though General Shafter can get along
without them when our troops open
fire from the ridge of San Juan hill.
From that point the Spanish position
can be swept with artillery and infan
try fire, and it will be impossible to
withstand it. I am told by soldiers
and line officers that whole regiments
in the forward trenches have agreed to
rush upon the Spanish lines at the first
opportunity, with or without specific
orders. Officers or regiments and com
panies when asked about this report
pretend ignorance, bi" they add that
they do not know whether they can
hold the troops In check or not.
A great part of the results accom
plished thus far in the operations be
fore Santiago have come about without
specific orders. At El Caney, for in
stance, our men had fought all day,
slowly forcing their way through the
hedges, lined with barbed wire, and
through woods filled with entangle
ments in the face of a withering fire
to within a few hundred yards of the
enemy's trenches. While these troops
were preparing to charge I am toll
one of General Shafter's aids rushed
up to General Chaff ee with an order to
desist from attacking El Caney and
prepare to march to the support of
troops In front of Santiago. General
Chaffee, my informant alleges, refused
to obey except on the written order of
General Shafter. The aid went back
to General Shafter's headquarters and
returned safely an hour later with a
written order to cease the attack on
the village. General Chaffee pointed to
the lines of the Twenty-fifth and
Twelfth Infantry, who then were
climbing the steen hill toward the prin
cipal fortification of El Caney, and
said: "There are my troops; go and
stop them." The aid returned to Gen
eral Shafter and reported the alleged
insubordination, but before his report
was heard by the American commander
El Caney had passed into the posses
sion of General Chaffee's troops.
I am told that the reason the Spanish
proposed to evacuate Santiago if they
could march out quietly with their
arms and ammunition was because
they feared they would be massacred
by the Cubans if they should surrender
unconditionally. There Is much feel
ing between our troops and the Cu
bans due in part to the refusal of the
insurgents to help build roads. The
New York, Massachusetts and Michi
gan troops havo done this work.
A Spanish deserter who entered our
lines this morning was taken to Gen
eral Wheeler's headquarters, where he
talked freely of the situation in Santi- i
ago. He said that the Spanish sol- ;
diers were much better satisfied since
General Toral took command, owing ;o
the wounding of General Linares. To- j
ral, he said, issues a supply of rum to !
the soldiers three times a day, and has
paid each soldier $3. That is the first
pay the Spanish troops have received
la six months. They still are willing
to fight if given plenty to eat. Although !
the water pipes leading into the city i
have been tapped, enough water for all .
present needs is obtained from the
wells in the city. There are also S
enough rations, particularly rice and I
beans, on hand to supply the Spanish
forces for some time, so the deserter
declared. He said that the city's streets
were filled with trenches and many
houses had been loopholed so troops
could fire from within. From this same
deserter the information was obtained
that there were no war vessels of any
kind in the harbor; that General Toral
has plenty of rifle ammunition, but \
that artillery ammunition is scarce. He
estimaled the garrison now in and
about the city numbered 12,000 men, in
cluding the reinforcements which re
cently arrived. The condition of the
refugees at El Caney is slightly im
proved, but the situation is such as to
invite disease.
The Red Cross is doing excellent
work, but the relief furnished sufferers
still is inadequate. Efforts are being
made to mark the graves of all Amer
icans killed in the operations about
Santiago.
Vultures already are attacking the
mounds where our fallen heroes are
buried. It Is proving impossible to
keep our soldiers from violating the
rules laid down for their guidance. The
men persist in eating green fruit and
drinking unboiled water.
The soldiers to-day carved the name
of the late Lieutenant Guerney on the
San Juan blockhouse. He participated
in the fighting on San Juan hill as a
member of the Twelfth Infantry and
was killed there.
HOW TORAL WOULD
SURRENDER SANTIAGO
Proposition Beceived With Favor by
a Majority of the Generals
Under Shafter.
SIBONEY, July 10(via Playa del Este).â I
General Shafter held a conference with !
the American generals at the front to-day
concerning the offer made by the Spanish |
commander, General Toral. to surrender .
Santiago If the Spanish garrison were al- i
lowed to march out with side arms and |
to have twenty miles' start without mo- j
lestatlon.
General Toral agreed that if this were
accepted he would not destroy the ships
in the harbor, the ammunition In the forts
or the bulldinps In the city. The majority
of the generals, Wheeler leading, are in
favor or the acceptance of these terms,
on the ground that the Spaniards can
march out to the westward anyhow, and
burn the city and destroy all the vessels,
guns and ammunition before leaving.

POPULAR TENDENCY
IN FAVOR OF SCHLEY
But AmonÂ£ Naval Officials the
Desire Is to Suspend Judg
ment Till Sampson Reports.
NEW YORK July 11.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
In the absence of an official report from Admiral Sampson of the naval
battle before Santiago there is a popular tendency, based on the story as
already told, toward Commodore Schley as the hero of the engagement.
But among the navy people especially and among many public men
there seems to be a desire to suspend judgment until ;.ll the facts shall
have been developed. This neutral feeling was helped along among
army and navy officers when they learned the contents of the dispatches
received to-day from Commodore Schley and Admiral Sampson, one giv
ing Sampscin the credit of victory and the other denying that there was
any friction between these two naval commanders, and commending the
officers of the licet, including Schley, for their effective work.
Public men, however, are outspoken. For example. Representative
Bailey of Texas, the Democratic leader in the House, said to me to-day:
"I should prefer to await the arrival of official reports before expressing
an opinion, but I think that the victory was undoubtedly due to Schley,
and the credits and awards should be his accordingly."

ONLY TWO SPANIARDS
SEEM IN TWO BATTLES
Wounded American Officer Relates
His Strange Experience nt San
tiago to Secretary Alger.
WASHINGTON, July 11.â Secretary
Alger shook hands to-day with the first
of the wounded men direct from the
field. A small party of the wounded ar
rived here during the day, consisting of
Captain Brereton of the Twenty-fourth
Infantry; Lieutenant McCoy, Eighth
Cavalry- ; Lieutenant Cash of the Rough
Riders. Lieutenant Mead of the Twen
ty-first Infantry and Lieutenant Trail
of the Seventy-first New York.
They were on leave and on their way
home to recover from their wounds.
Lieutenant McCoy was on crutches and
all of them showed they had been in the
hands of the surgeons. About noon
Lieutenant Cash of the Rough Riders
went to the War Department and re
ported to Adjutant General Corbin. The
latter showed the wounded officer
through to Secretary Alger's private of
fice. The Secretary was engaged for
the moment with a Senator, who, no
ticing the wounded man, arose and
said:
"After you, sir."
The Secretary warmly greeted this
first eye-witness of the fight. He held
out his left hand to the Secretary, for
his right hung in a sling, having been
shattered during the first day's light
at Santiago. The Secretary listened
with much interest to the recital of the
conditions prevailing, and assured his
visitor that he and all the other wound
ed would be given the fullest attention
and consideration.
Lieutenant Cash said that the men he
left are cheerful and full of enthusiasm
and had no complaints of suffering to
make. He said: "The Spanish are
desperate fighters and very fine marks
men. Their fire was extremely hot and
well directed and our great trouble was
that we could not see them. We simply
had to fire where we thought they
might be. During the two engagements
I was in I saw but two Spaniards.
Both of these I saw in the first engage
ment. In the second engagement I did
not get a chance to fire my gun, though
I was in it for several hours and was
half way up the hill when struck.
"At the first engagement near Sib
oney, where the Rough Riders were
first subjected to such a galling fire and
where we lost a lot of our men, we were
not surprised. We knew that the Span
iards were in ambush and we were try
ing to beat them out."
FREEMAN HALSTED'S
SENTENCE MODIFIED
Curzon Makes a Statement Regarding
the Canadian Wnr Correspond
ent's Case.
LONDON, July 11.â The Parliamentary
Secretary for the Foreign Office. Mr. Cur
! zon, replying in the House of Commons
to-day to a question on the subject of thn
! arrest of the Canadian war correspond
: ent. Freeman Halsted, who was arrested at
I Porto Rico and sentenced to nine years'
I imprisonment for taking photographs of
j the fortifications at that place, said that
j recent reportÃ showed the conditions of
j Halsted's Imprisonment had been altered,
as they were threatening to seriously af
' feet his health. The British Embassador
I at Madrid, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff,
i had i.ierefore been instructed to make
! representations to Spain, with a view to
1 obtaining more humane treatment for the
prisoner, and he had expressed the hope
that the latter's sentence of nine years'
' Imprisonment would eventually be miti
â  gated.

Popular Demand for the Big Bond
Issue â No Chance for Banks
or Corporations.
NEW YORK, July 11.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Sub
scriptions for the $290,000,000 bond issue,
which will close on Thursday of this
week, continue to come in rabidly, and
the loan will be subscribed several
times over. The intention of Congress
to make it a popular loan will be car
ried out, and the present Indications
are that It will be distributed among
at least 200,000 individuals, the average
amount of bonds allotted to any one
person being 51000. Assistant Secre
tary-Treasurer Vanderlip told me this
afternoon that individual subscriptions
would amount to more than the entire
loan, and not a bond would go to any
bank, corporation or firm.

aaaaaaac-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao
WASHINGTON, July 11. â General
Shafter's report from Siboney, sent just
before midnight last night, caused the
officials of the War Department to
wait all day with the expectation of
hearing that the bombardment of San
tiago had begun. No word to that ef
fect came, however, up to the time the
department closed, and though there is
little reason to doubt that th? general
carried out the programme of which
he had notified the department, it was
regarded as possible that he had con
sented to a further extension under the
â flag of truce, in view of certain signs
of weakening' on the part of the Span
ish commander. It is supposed here
that General Miles, with additional re
inforcements on the Yale, will arrive
at Siboney to-night or to-morrow
morning, and if a surrender has not
been secured by that time, it is be
lieved that the assault upon the town
proper will be prosecuted at once with
the greatest energy and determina
tion.
Tests made recently of the naval ord : '
nance gave very unsatisfactory results,
when it was attempted to project [
' shells over the high hills from the open
, sea into Santiago City. Possibly bet- !
\ ter results may be attained to-morrow j
; if the attack is resumed then, but there
ia more likelihood that the main re- ;
liance will be on such of the lighter j
draught vessels of Admiral Sampson's j
j fleet as may succeed in getting closer
i to the shore and in a better position
than the heavy battle-ships.
The officials here are satisfied that
what appears to be delay on the part
of General Shafter was really caused :
; by his efforts to carry out strictly the '
: President's injunction to prevent the
Spanish army from escaping to San
tiago. He might have attacked the
town several days ago, with the result
that if the Spanish were overcome they :
would have retreated without obstruc
tlon to the northwest, beyond the reach
jof our soldiers to follow. His dispatch
[ written late last nisrht indicates clear- ;
i ly that he has been trying to complete ;
' his line of investment so as to prevent !
1 such an escape, and as he appears to
â  feel satisfied that h^ has accomplished
this the final assault will not be de
layed much longer.
General Shafter is disposed to save
' every life possible in the war, probably
having in mind the particularly large
â  proportion of killed, wounded and mips
ing compared to the total strength of
his army from the battle of Caney.
, whi*h the official figures promulgated
to-day show was exceptional In modern ;
warfare.
It is to save our troops that he de- j
sires to make a free use of artillery be- !
fore the assault proper begins, and I

; duel of yesterday appears to have been
more serious in its results than was at
first inspected by General Shafter him
' self, for, during the afternoon he was
obliged to report as a result the death
; of Captain W. Rowell, Second Infantry,
j one of the most gallant and popular
j officers of the regular establishment.
! Captain Rowell was born in New York
j and was appointed to the military
! academy in 1870. He became a second
lieutenant in 1874, a first lieutenant in
j 18S1 and was placed in command of the
: company which he led to his death in
! 1596. His death caused deep grief
! among the officers of the department,
! who respected him for his soldierly
qualities as manifested in his hard
! service in the West.
Ex-Secretary Herbert had quite a
conference with Secretary Long this
afternoon upon the subject of fire
proof wood for naval construction. He
brought with him a formidable array
of facts, gathered from the newspaper
reports of the naval battle, to show
that fire was the element that worked
the greatest destruction among the
vessels of the Spanish squadron, and
thaft wherever American vessels had
been hit, even in the case of the tiny
torpedo-boat, they had escaped such
fires because all of their woodwork was
fire proof. So impressed was Secre
tary Long with the statement that he
had concluded to reconvene a special
board which was appointed some time
ago to deal with this matter and which
had recommended that the use of the
prepared wood be curtailed in some
measure in American warship build-
Navat officials say that a serious ir
regularity occurred at the time the
ships of Admiral CVrvera's fleets
hauled down their colors and surren
dered. Inquiries have brought out the
fact that the breech blocks of the ?uns
were thrown overboard, thus disabling
the guns and making them practically
worthless, and th^ Talvea by which thÂ»
ships were flooded were opened after th"
surrender, which was a breach of the
rules of warfare. th<> enemy having
ceased fighting and having asked for
quarter. It is said that further de
struction of the ships at such a time
vq? both wanton and dishonorable, and
that if the persons responsible for it
are located they are likely to be held
accountable.
The department has not yet received
the report of the court of Inquiry,
showing in detail the injuries to thes<Â»
ships and the possibilities of salvage.
The press report of the hoard's find
ing:?, saying that only the Maria Teresa
:<: < could be saved, excited much surprise,
; as it was confidently believed that the
; CYiinn also muM be saved in w&olo or
lin part. The officials are still hopeful
j that the full report of the board will
show that there is a chance of saving
I the Colon.
lipht artillery and 815 recruits for the
regular infantry are now ashore, and it
is probable the Eighth Ohio men from the
St. Paul will be landed by noon to-mor
row. A coal-laden schooner, the Stevens,
drifted against the hospital ship Relief,
and both would have drifted ashore but
for the prompt assistance rendered them
by the Cynthia 11.
Food and water are very scarce in San

TOWARD THE FUSION REEFS

TO WRECK THE CRAFT
There'll Be Mutioy Aboard if Maguire's Southern
Seamer) Succeed in Getting Control of
tf)e hjelm.
Middle-of-the-Road Members of the Crew Certain to Desert Unless a
Pilot of Their Own Choosing Be Put
in Charge.
SACRAMENTO, July 12. â At midnight the fusionists were loudly asserting that they were complete masters
of the situation; that they would elect E. L. Hutchinson chairman of the convention and would deliver the party over
to Maguirc
Chairman Wardell of the State Central Committee called a caucus late to-night, which was held in the dining
room of the State House. Wardell, in calling the caucus to order, said that several members of the committee
met this afternoon to ascertain the will of the majority in regard to organizing the convention, and decided upon a
caucus.
The first victory for the fusionists came when a motion was made and carried pledging the delegates to abide
by the action of the caucus. In vain the middle-of-the-roadsters protested, and when the motion was finally carried
R. H. Webster nnd his followers withdrew, leaving the fusionists in complete possession.
From that time everything was harmonious. Van Meter of Fresno was elected chairman of the caucus and
Gregory of Alameda secretary.
When nominations for chairman of the convention were called for_Douglass T. Fowler of Alameda and E. L.
Hutchinson of Los Angeles were nominated. The ballot was secret and Hutchinson was announced to be the choice
of the is by a vote of 55 to 21. This shows the strength of the fusionists at the present time.
(.re .;.iry of Alameda was chosen secretary by acclamation, and after considerable discussion as to the pro
gT.-mme to be followed it was decided to caucus again to-morrow.
The anti-fusionists, though somewhat disconcerted at the outcome of the caucus, are still full of fight and say
they are by no means whipped. They say the 76 votes for chairman show the full strength of the fusionists, while
many of the middle-of-the-roadsters will not be here until morning. Some of them talk of bolting the convention if
fusion carries and nominating an independent ticket from top to bottom. Johnson, the veteran journalist and one of
the earliest Populists in California, opposes this plan, and in the event of fusion will issue a call to the Populists of
the State. dedans that the party has been delivered over to Maguire by spoilsmen; and, as the best way to defeat
their object i- to make every Populist vote count for two, he will urpe that every Populist vote for the Republican
head of the ticket and support the remainder of the fusion ticket. The ballot will serve the double purpose of de
feating the place-hunters and demonstrating the strength of the Populists and serve to keep the party alive.
This plan is meeting with much favor among the middje-of-the-roadsters and it will undoubtedly receive their
united support. J. J. COREY.
BREAKERS AHEAD OF
PEOPLE'S PARTY
If Fusion Wins Many Delegates
Will Walk Out of thje
Convention.
SACRAMENTO, July 11.â That there
will b.- a spirited and hotly contested
fight over the fusion proposition when
th-- PomiJtet Cunvention meets to-mor
:ig in che Assemt'y chambers
at the State Capitol is now evident.
Judging from the tenor of the remarks
! the delegates there is every
Indication of a split in the Populist
ranks. If an open rupture is avoided it
will be due to the radiance oÂ£ some
itar that has not thus far ap-
I -d on the political horizon.
Quite a number of the delegates from
southern portion of the State are
in favor of fusion. With them fusion is
Bynonymoua with Maguire. The fine
work of the Gallagher-Maguire wing of
the Democracy is now showing. The
Bouthern fusionists want to see Con
nominated for Gov
ernor, as they believe that it will
strengthen hid fight in the Democratic
convention.
From the counties of the north dele
gates have been sent who are opposed
to Magulre and fusion. They hope to
see Khunahan, the "tall Sycamore of
Shasta," head the State ticket, and
they are not overlooking any points
in the political game. With them it is
Shanahan or nothing. They will not
listen for a moment to any suggestion
of fusion. They think that an out-and
out straight Populist ticket should be
nominated, and that the party should
go before the people on purely Populist
lines. Maguire, they say, has become
bo adept in straddling the fence and
dropping oil on the side that will bring
the greater number of plums to his
friends that they have no faith in him.
They say that he could take a Populist
platform for breakfast and swallow a
icratlc platform for dinner, with
out feeling the least disquietude, no
matter bow diverging might be the
planks.
The Populists stand to-day on the
brink of a precipice. If the fusion idea
obtains there is certain to be trouble
and probably a disruption of the party.
With Maguire in the front there will
be many Populists dropping out of the
ranks. In lact some of the interior
delegates have been instructed to vote
against the proposition of fusion, and
their instructions go further. If the
fusionlsts carry the day the delegations
are to withdraw from the convention.
These instructions will be carried out.
With fusion and Maguire there is a
FtG-rmy time ahead of the Populist
party.
Until the question of fusion is set
tled the delegates are at sea. The fight
of the convention will come on a reso
lution pledging the delegates to not
nominate or indorse any candidate for
a State, legislative or Congresional of
fice who will not unequivocally sup
port the platform of the Populist party.
If this resolution prevails Maguire will
be out of the race, for there is certain
t be a < onflict on some vital points be
tween the platforms of the Populist and
Democi parties.
If the anti-fusion forces carry the
day .Shanahan will find a strong rival
in J. V. Webster, who ran for Governor
four years ago. Webster is one of the
leaders of the anti-fusion forces and
has a host of friends. T..v ;
George W. Monteith, a San Francisco
attorney, who raji for Congress two
years ago, is mentioned as a guberna
torial < -andidate. Whether his name
will go before the convention will do
voive on the fusion fight. His friends
believe that if fusion prevails he will
Btand a good chance in a race with
Bhanahan and Webster. Shanahan has
]o?t considerable ground because of a
rumor that he does not want the gu
bernatorlal nomination "for keeps." It
is charged against him that if nomi
nated on an anti-fusion ticket he would
fali from his lofty perch to drop into
a place on the Democratic ticket as
nominee for Lieutenant Governor
So it is that the divided forces are
watching one another as closely as does
a cat watch a mouse.
In the struggle over the fusion propo
sition the offices on the State ticket are
being to some extent overlooked There
are hosts of candidates In the field but
none of them know which way to turn
until the question of fusion is settled

BUCKLEY BACK OF
JUDGE MAGUIRE
"Banjo -Eyed Kid" Is One
of the Congressman's
Lieutenants.
SACRAMENTO. July It.â Lounging
about the office of the State House, ap
parently taking little or no interest in
the tumult surroundine him, yet never
theless keeping a watchful eye on Ma
guire's reconcentrados and the middle
of-the-road Insurgents is a fairly -well
groomed man with close-cropped, red
dish b<>ard. Though he seldom engages
in conversation with the busy states
men, when he does single one out for
his attention he gets right down to the
kernel without any backing and filling.
This unassuming individual is none
other than the more or less notorious
"Banjo-eyed Kid," who has served and
is serving his master, Christopher A.
Buckley, well and faithfully, and to
whom has been delegated the difficult
task of capturing the Populist State
Convention for James G. Maguire. The
duty is naturally a compliment to the
"Kid," but of necessity fell to him, for
who better than he is fitted to carry
out the plan of campaign so familiar
to those who know of Buckley's past
It will be a painful surprise to those
who still believe in the Representative
of the Fourth District to learn that he
has irrevocably allied himself to Buck
ley and delivered himself into the
hands of the "Banjo-eyed Kid." Time
was when Maguire spurned Buckley,
his metltods and his henchmen, but
that was when he was just beginning
to mount the ladder of political fame
and before his ambition soared to the
gubernatorial chair. But his growing
ambition has smothered all sense of
propriety and even decency, and to-day
finds him ready to enter into any com
bine, ratifying all the sand-bagging
methods known to the most depraved
of political bosses to further his asplra-
The delegates from the south came In
this morning fairly well organized and
shouting for fusion. Their arrival
| created somewhat of a stampede and
i for a time the anti-fuslonlsts, who last
! night had matters all their own way,
i were engulfed in the maelstrom of
i union sentiment. However, they man
aged soon to get their heads above
water and later in the day there was a
turn in the tide. Men who in the mum'
' ing would listen to no argument
j against fusion became less boisterous;
Maguire's political record, which was
persistently flaunted in their faces,
! could no longer be ignored and as they
! studied it the more closely their fusion
' ardor chilled.
The Fresno delegation, which was
. counted on to lead the fight, became
less enamored of their task and finally
they admitted that it was "going to be
a pretty fight in the convention," and
I "guessed" they would not take a hand
in it just yet.
When one sees George W. Baker, cor
poration lawyer and Silver Republican,
laboring in behalf of fusion and in
cidentally the indorsement of himself
for the Supreme bench, one asks him
self all sorts of unanswerable questions
about Maguire's anti-railroad anti-cor
poration postures, and the more such
questioner finds himself marveling at
the celerity with which the Congress
man can get under the same political
blanket with those he has publicly de
nounced and secretly aided.
The middle-of-the-roadsters are la
boring unceasingly and their work is
j telling, but what the situation will be
\ to-morrow no man will venture to pre
! diet. T. W. H. Shanahan, on whom
1 they have concentrated their hopes, has
any number of warm personal friends
among the delegates who have hereto
| fore announced themselves as favoring
! fusion without considering its conse
j quences, and when they fully compre
i hend that on the action of this conven
tion depends the very life of their
1 party in this State It is more than like
; ly they will turn from fusion to the
j tall "Sycamore of Shasta."
1 When it la said the life of Populism
Some Populists and Others Who Lined Up on Sunday Night to Ornament the Hotel Register.
depends on this convention it is not ex
aggerating matters, for it is generally
admitted that if the Democrats can
control this convention they can con
trol future gatherings and, therefore,
it is quite useless to keep up the sem
blance of a party organization merely
to be used as a catspaw for the Demo
crats.
More delegates arrived to-night and
the light against fusion became
warmer. The middle-of-the-roadsters
are laboring under the disadvantage of
being unorganized, while their oppo
nents are marshaled under the leader
ship of experienced politicians, men
who later will have a large-sized hand
in the Democratic proceedings in the
interest of Maguire.
However, the right became so warm
to-night that the "Banjo-eyed Kid"
cast aside his reserve and for two h>>urs
harangued a crowd of delegates in
front erf the Statehouse on Maguire's
virtues. He laid particular stress in the
strength shown by the Congressman in
carrying his own district three times in
succession, and solemnly assured his
hearers that Maguire was the only man
in the Stale who could poll the full
strength of his own party next Novem
ber; while as for the .Populists, c-nce
they indorsed him they would fairiy
tumble over each other in their anxiely
to rally to his standard.
The "Kid" would have been talking
yet had not somebody in the crowd
shouted to him to give Maguire's posi
tion on several questions of vital inter
est to the Populists. Then the "Kid"
became pensive and took himself off
to the Golden Eagle for a time.
The fusionists made a rather clever
play to- split up their opponent? to
night and leave the field clear for them
selves to labor unmolested with the
fresh arrivals, but to their disgust the
scheme was not as successful as they
had ho-ped. Late in the afternoon no
tice was posted in the office of the
Statehouse calling for an anti-railroad
meeting in the Supreme Court chamber
at S o'clock, and urging delegates hos
tile to the railroad to be present and
prepare a strung plank for insertion in
the platform. The meeting was held,
but less than a dozen delegates took the
bait and it soon adjourned.
The convention will open at 10 a. m.
and the first real fight will take place
on the election of olfieers. R. 11. Web
ster will receive the support of the
middle-of-the-roadsters lor chairman,
while the Maguires are divided between
Hutchinson of Los Angeles and liogers
of Napa. The latter, however, is not
likely to cut much of a figure and the
contest is expected to simmer down to
Webster and Hutchinson.
The story has been started, with the
undoubted intention of causing a
break-away from tfhanahan, that in
case he is nominated for Governor he
will step aside in favor of Maguire
after the convention adjourns and take
second place on the Democratic ticket.
The straight-outs pooh-pooh the story
and assert that it is circulated merely
to alarm and bewilder the more timid
ones. Among those who take the rumor
seriously is Attorney George W. Mon
tieth, who has capped his career by
joining the ranks of saffron journalism,
and now, standing with bared head
under a clotfdless sky, Montieth awaits
the stroke of the political thunderbolt.
Yes. Montieth is a candidate for Gov
ernor â not an open and avowed candi
date, but he figures that with Shana
han out of the way, the middle-of-the
roadsters will cast about for somebody
else on whom to lean. And who with a
Populistic record as stanch and* un
yielding 1 as ho? Two years ago, he re
calls, as do some others, he shunned all
attempts to drag him down after he
had received the nomination for Con
gress in the First District, and re
mained a candidate to the end, defeat
ing, in a measure, the fusion agree
ment entered into in that campaign.
However, any chance that Montieth
might have will be blighted when it be
comes generally known to-morrow that
he has attached himself to the Third
street faker, for with that sheet as the
organ of Maguire and fusion Montteth's
reputation as a straight-out Populist is
quite apt to suffer to a considerable
extent.
The country delegates are yawning
frightfully and talk of the fearful dis
sipations these political conventions
lead Â«. man into, but few of them will
go to bed, fearful that the other side
will score an advantage should it be
left unwatched for an instant.

MAGUIRE NOT CAPABLE
OF LEADING A PARTY
Carleton H- Johnson Reviews t\)e Political
Career of the Congressman and Draws
Son)e Logical Conclusions.
SACRAMENTO, July 11.â To the Editor of The Call: There are many
mm in the Democratic party who would be more acceptable to Populists
than James G. Maguire, if the question of nominating any Democrat could
be considered. Maguire has already said in his letter, asking for the Dem
ocratic nomination, that he will make no promises except those contained
In the Democratic platform. In 1892 and In 1894 he made a canvass of the
State against the Populist candidates, and condemned the Populist party
repeatedly by saying that the Democratic party was the only anti-monop
oly party. It Is well known that after leaving the Democratic party in 1887
he came back into it in 18S8, because of his admiration of Grover Cleve
land.
Maguire Is only a recent convert to free silver. In 1892 he could have
had the Populist nomination for Congress in the Fourth District, and was
offered it on the condition that he would subscribe to the free silver plank,
which he refused to do, and the Populists were therefore compelled to nom
inate a man against him. On October 11, 1895, he declared In the Bulletin
that he was opposed to the payment of gold debts in silver, as it was re
pudiation in his opinion, and that greenbacks ought to be redeemed. He
moved and voted to strike the income tax clause out of the Wilson bill
in Congress and made a long speech against the Income tax. He voted
to deprive Tom Watson, the Populist from Georgia, of his seat in Congress
In favor of a Democratic candidate elected by the most glaring frauds,
and in that matter he was opposed by William Jennings Bryan, who was
in Congress at the time and who voted for Watson.
Maguire voted against the bill to restrict immigration, which Populists
demand, and which the labor organizations all demanded. He voted and
worked against Hawaiian annexation, in the face of resolution passed by
Populists within his own district. He has joined the Croker Gold Bug Club
in New York, an organization having as one of its avowed purposes the
knocking out of the free silver plank from the Democratic platform in
1900. He is a pronounced individualist and in speeches in public has de
clared himself opposed to the Government operation of railroads, and has
also declared himself opposed to collectivism in any form, and Is alto
gether an absolute opponent of the fundamental basis of the Omaha plat
form.
While he has said that he was not a candidate in the sense of the ma
nipulation of conventions it is notorious that his agents have interfered to
stuff Populist conventions in many parts of the State and in San Francisco
not only in a most obnoxious but a fraudulent manner.
When Maguire left the Democratic party in ISB7 he announced his pur
pose to elect Henry George President, and to never return to the Demo
cratic party unless It took up Henry George's doctrine, and in 1888 he was
back in the party, stumping the State for Grover Cleveland.
And now, ten years later, when he is a candidate for Governor, and has
sufficient influence to control a Democratic platform, he practically ad
vises his party not to take up George's doctrine for fear he will lose votes
by it, and in every respect he has shown that he is not a leader, but a
follower and a trimmer. CARLETON H. JOHNSON,
Secretary of the County Committee of the People's Party of San Fran
cisco.
SILK TILES AND
FINE APPAREL
How the Fusion Populists Are
Distinguished prom the
Others.
SACRAMENTO, July 11.â To fuse or
not to fuse, is the question upon which
the forces of the Populist Convention
will divide. Whether it is best to pur
sue the course of an independent or
ganization, free from the influence and
control of domineering Democracy, or
to amalgamate with them, is the one
bone of contention, the solution of which
promises dissolution, in whatever way
it may be decided.
A casual reconnoiter among the del
egates discloses the presence of two
factions, one representing the pioneer
Populists of 1592 without office, the
other representing those who either hold
office or have promise of one at the
hands of the Democracy. Wardell,
Shannahan and a long list of lesser
lights belong to the latter class, while
the former la made up of those who
are only seen in public as they pass
through the door of the convention hall
once in four years. This latter class
has been designated as the middle-of
the-road Populists, while the other is
without designation, beyond the cut of
their clothes and silk hats, which are a
decided contrast to the plainer attire of
their country brethren.
Fusion, to the "middle-of-the-road
Populists," means Maguire as a proba
bility. The mere possibility of such
a compromise arouses them to open re
volt. Maguire's vote on the bond is
sue, even as a war measure, has for
ever destroyed the hope of a reconcili
ation between himself and the simon
pure Populists of the State.
The "patronage Populists" look with
complacency upon Maguire, as they
do upon any other fusion candidate.
To fulfill their contract, to turn over
their party to the Democrats is their

only desire and design. The vote upon
the question, however decided, will be
a close one, and the defection, in either
instance, wfll be sufficient to destroy
the fruits of victory.
The Silver Republicans are wander
ing: lone and weary through the streets
without a place to lay their heads, with
out a hand to shake. The Populists
ignore t": '.'in entirely. H. A. McCra
ney, for four years a Republican at
tache in the office of the clerk of the
Supreme Court, who recently resigned
in order to become a State organizer
of the Silver Republicans, is very much
in evidence around the room of the
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

SPEED EVENTS
Directors Adopt the
Programme.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 11.â The State

Wilson.
The speed programme committee sub
mitted its report, -which was adopted.
The single dash system has been
adopted by the State Board, an Inno
vation that seems to take with the pub
lic, and does away with the tedious
heat affairs. Each day will witness
five events, one of which will be a

action and a snappy afternoon's sport.
Under this system horses can be raced
every day and not feel the effects of
racing, as they do after a six or seven
heat race.
It was decided to have alternate trot- â 
Ing and running during the twelve days
of the meeting. The first day, Sep
tember 5, -will be a harness horse day.
Eight thousand seven hundred dollars
is offered In purses for trotting and
pacing stakes in six events. The con
ditions are: Five to enter, three to
start. If but two appear to start, money

OUT OF HER DEPTH AT
THE BATHING BEACH
Mrs. S. G. Squires of San Francisco
â¢Has a Narrow Escape at
Pacific Grove.
PACIFIC GROVE, July 11. -An accident
that came perilously near ending the life
of one of Pacific Grove's summer visitors

Mrs. S. G. Squires of San Francisco waa
bcthing In the surf with Mrs. MacMurdo,
and in following her friend, who is an ex

toward a raft, Mrs. Squires went beyond
her depth. Being of a nervous tempera

presence of mind, and, feeling herself
going, opened her mouth to cry for help
thus filling her lungs with water. There
being a large number of people In the
surf, her plight was not observed for some
seconds, but when she rose to the surface
a young man who was near went to
the rescue and, with Rome assistance, suc
ceeded in bringing her ashore. Many will

work before full consciousness was re
stored. Mrs. Squires was then removed to
her cottage, and is now receiving every
care. Her physician believes she will
have completely recovered in. a few days.

Dr. Haskell Denounces the Corrupt
Influences That Dominate San

SAN JOSE, July 11.â Tho alleged cor

the conscience of these young people;
therefore it is criminal, and every man

schools be closed until they can be freed
from these bad, vicious, criminal political
influences."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 12, 1898.
NEW HIGH SCHOOL FOR SAN RAFAEL
SAN RAFAEL, July 11.â It will not be long until this city will be ornamented by a new high school building,
a beautiful structure, that will reflect credit upon the spirit of progress manifested by the City Board of Educa
tion, and especially upon "William Ma gee and Dr. Wickman, two members who have labored assiduously for the
necessary appropriation.
The design adopted by the board is that of Cunningham Bros. The main building will have a hundred-feet
frontage on E street, and will extend back 38 feet. The annex will be 42x50 feet. It is to be a two-story
frame building, with a basement 8 feet high. The ceiling of the main two floors will be 13^ feet in height. The
free library room will occupy a floor space of 1600 square feet and will be provided with two toilet rooms and an
office for the librarian. The heating system of the library will be independent of the school heating apparatus.
The school rooms will consist of a large assembly room, a commercial room, four class rooms, a principal's
office, teachers' rooms, toilet rooms, laboratories and hallways. The interior of the edifice will be furnished in
yellow Oregon pine. In all its appointments the building is to be strictly up to date, the ventilation and heating
systems being the best yet devised. When completed and ready for furnishing the cost will be over $11 000. The
grading of the lot will cost an additional sum.
The building will be located on an old cemetery lot and work on the structure will have to be postponed un
til the bodies are removed, which cannot be legally done until some time in August. In the meantime the spe
cifications will be prepared, bids of contractors invited and all arrangements completed for the vigorous prosecu
tion of the work of grading and building, so that the structure may be inclosed before the beginning of the rainy
season.

REAR ADMIRAL
AMMEN DEAD
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 11.â Rear Ad
miral Ammen, retired, one of the he
roes of the Civil War, died at the Na
val Hospital here this morning, aged
78 years.
Admiral Ammen had been at the
Naval Hospital for ten months, and
death was due to general enfeeblement
of the system. He leaves three daugh
ters, unmarried, and two sons, one a
paymaster in the navy. He was well
known here, where he had lived many
years. He served in the navy within
six months of a half century. He was
born in Ohio, May 15, 1820, and entered
the navy as a midshipman In 1836. He
first served as a passed midshipman in
the Wilkes exploring expedition In the
Mediterranean in 1837-38. In 1849, while
ranking as a lieutenant, he was at
tached to a commission to select a site
for a naval station in the bay of San
Francisco, later accompanying a scien
tific expedition on the steamer Water
Witch to the Paraguay River.
He was executive officer of the North
Atlantic blockading squadron at the
outbreak of the rebellion. At the re
duction of Port Koyal November C.
1861, he commanded the Seneca of the
South Atlantic blockading squadron,
and was sent ashore to hoist the Union
Hag over the surrendered forts and to
hold them until the army took posses
sion. He commanded the forces enter
ing via the Whale branch in the at
tack on Port Royal Ferry, and was
also engaged in the operations against
Fernandina. He commanded the moni
tor Patapsco in the attack on Fort Mc-
Allister and Fort Sumter.
In May, 1864, he was ordered to As
pinwall in command of 220 seamen as
passengers on board the California
passenger steamer Queen. Two days
out of New York a well-organized at
tempt at mutiny was suppressed by
him, aided by several officers and a few
volunteers among the passengers.
Subsequently Admiral Ammen parti
cipated in the two attacks on Fort
Fisher in the winter of 1864-65. He
reached the grade of rear admiral in
1889. Of his service twenty-one years
and one month were spent at sea. He
was a delegate to the Interoceanic Shiu
Canal Congress at Paris in 1879 and wt*
a member of the Naval Advisory Board
in 1881. The ram Katahdin was de
signed by him. He wrote several books.

GO TO CATCH
A PRIVATEER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, July 11.â In response
to the request of United States Consul
Dudley of Vancouver Admiral Pulleser,
commander of the Pacific British squad
ron, stationed at Esquimau, has dis
patched H. M. S. Amphion, a second
class cruiser, carrying nine guns, and the
sloop of war Icarus, mounting eight guns,
to cruise the waters of the north to search
for the privateer which, according to re
ports that have reached the ears of the
Consul, lies hidden in the vicinity of
Dixon entrance, through which the
treasure ships pass on their way south.
The fleet was at Vancouver in connec
tion with the celebration and citizens
there were surprised yesterday to see the
two warships hoist their anchors and slip
off to sea. Inquiries were made, and ac
cording to the naval authorities the ad
miral decided on the information re
ceived to take steps to prevent any hold
ing-up of ships for the purpose of loot
ing. Although probably only American
boats would bo stopped, the injury would
not in case be confined to them, as many
of the miners on board with gold would
be Britishers.
Seafaring men here are divided In opin
ion as to the truth of the report of the
privateer's presence on the coast. Many,
especially those who have interests at
stake, believe In the existence of the ves
sel, while others doubt it. One thing,
however, is certainâ a strong feeling of
sympathy with the Americans exists at
Esquimau and every officer spoken to on
the matter expresses himself strongly In
disfavor of privateering. If the report
that reaches here be true Captain Fin
nis has orders to blow the vessel out of
water if she shows tho least light when
found.

SOLEDAD IS NEARLY
WIPED OUT BY FIRE
SALINAS, July 11.â News was received
here by telephone about 10 o'clock this
evening that a fire had broken out at Sole
dad in a dance hall at the east end of
town. The fire spread rapidly and in a few
minutes the telephone office, which is sit
uated about 100U yards from the region of
the fire, was in flames. It has burned all
the business portion of the town, including
the stores of Charles Denange, the large
establishment of Wahrlich, Cornett ft Co.,
dealers in merchandise, W. H. Bingaman,
grain and stock dealer, the Railroad Ex
change saloon, several stables and other
buildings. The residence portion is now
on fire, with no hope of saving it. All tele
phonic and telegraphic communication is
cut off.
No assistance can be obtained from any
of the neighboring towns, as there is no
fire department nearer than Salinas.
The buildings destroyed in addition to
those already sent are the Eagle Hotel,
Rodgers' saloon. Miller's stables, Tholke's
saloon, Campbell's stable, Bernord's
blacksmith shop, the postoffice. Bay's Ho
tel, Stover's drug store, Grey's Hotel,
three Swiss saloons and several other
buildings. The loss will probably reach
about 140,000, partially covered by insur
ance. The only protection from fire af
forded the stricken town was from several
tanks in the neighborhood.
The reflection from the fire can be seen
from Salinas distinctly. The people here
think that the whole town has been de
stroyed.

There is help. There is assistance that
actually alters the state of living. Weak
men have weak backs. Weary men do not
feel inclined to work. Weak and weary men
have no such fee/ing as that of full power or
of vitality. They are at all times forced to
confess that they are unfit for the duties of
man. A man who is full of power goes at
his daily work with vim and a cense that
he can accomplish all he desires to. The
puny man never does this. He fears at all
times. He shakes. His nerves are half
gone. "Hudyan" restores nerve power.
"Hudyan" is the one thing that does. The
bright look in the eyes, the feeling of con-
fidence, the grand muscular development of
all of the organs and the sense of vigor are
produced by it. It is nature* remedy for
the men of weak and weary constitutions.

Charles C. Bull Writes Interest
ingly of Their Initial
Fight.
Charles C. Bull of Belmont, stroke of
the Harvard crew, halfback in the Var
sity '.earn and private in A Troop ot
Roosevelt's Rough Riders, has jusi
achieved the rare honor of having the
degree or bachelor of arts conferred on
him In h:r- sence by the Harvard fac
ulty. Mr. Bull was the youngest man of
his c'.-i.-s yet the dean officially declared,
la conferring the gree, that he .stood
so hlfh that had he been able to take
the examinations he was certain to have
passed with honors.
The following letters from the brilliant ,
young student, "t whose record Califor
nia is justly proud, give a vivid illus
tration of the dangers which our heroes
so bravely withstood during the early
days of their landing on Cuban soil. In
the light of events that have happened
since they were written, these letters wilt
prove of especial Interest to readers, more
especially the prognostications about Cer
vera's fleet:
SANTIAGO DE CUBA (On Transport),
June 10, ISSS.
My Dear : Well, we are here at last,
but after a very tirepome and tedious trip.
There are thirty vessels in the licet. with ten
warships for a convoy. This makes traveling
slow. Then we are towlnt two schooners,
which are aded with provisions and ammuni
tion, which also delays us. The Cuban coast
resembles our California shore very much. The
hills are high and barren, not covered with
Valrns, bananas, etc. An occasional green spot
breaks the monotony. The water is the j.i<-t
tlesl eight of all. It reminds me of a tubful
of bluing. Men ard, who have seen both.
Bay that the Mediterranean is not half as
colored. .l.
We were informed by a war vessel this !
morning that a fight had taken plai-<> at Guan- :
tanamo (forty miles east ot Santiago) between
800 marines and 3000 Spanish. The marines
were well entrenched and the Spaniards tried
to drive them out. Oui forces lost â¢ Ipht killed
and .'â > wounded, while the Spanish lost 150
killed. 2SO wounded and IS prisoners. This may .
be a story, but that is what the captain told
us. The tight last 100 hours and is still go-
Ing on.
I hurt my knee in Tampa and was taken abed
while we were on the road here. It came on
that night when I got soaked through. I caught
cold in it and got a Blight attack of rheuma- ,
t!s>m. I was in hard straits for a while, but
am all riKht now.
The champagne was smuggled aboard safely
and kept me from being sick the entire trip. ;
Two bottles were broken when it arrived. The
medicine bad not yet reached me when at ,
Tampa.
We expect to land to-night and begin opera
tions against Santiago. I don't think we will ;
entrench, as that would mean disease and sick
ness. \y> expect to be in the city in a week
and starve out those cruisers which are bottled
up. We have a rumor on board that they have
been destroyed. Give my best love to all. Sin
cerely yours, CHARLES C V.VI.L..

MAGUIRE INDORSED
FOR GOVERNOR
THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN ,
COMMITTEE'S RESOLUTIONS.
A Primary Election to Select Dele
gates to the State
Convention.
The campaign committee of the local '
Democracy held its first meeting last i
evening at t ho Baldwin Hotel and disposed
of considerable business of more or less
Importance. Major P. J. Harnr-y presided
and John F. McGovern was elected per- !
mane-it secretary.
The primary object of the meeting was
to discuss different metlKids for tho selec
tion of delegates to the coming Staf con
vention, but Major Harnoy somewhat de
layed matters by springing :i surprise in
the shape of a set of resolutions Indorsing
Hon. James G. Magulre for Governor. The,
articles recited at length the nominee's j
political career and pledged to him the j
active support of the committee. The res
olution was adopted unanimously.
a sub-committee was appointed to in
vestigate different methods of selecting
delegates to Stat<> conventions, to report ,
a* length on Baturday evening next How- 1
ever, the campaign committee is almost of
' nc voice in favor of a primary election
for that purpose, so that the work of the
Rub-committee will simply consist of
gathering points on the method of proced
ure
Bach member of the committee will ap
point in his own district a committee to
â¢ "ii some evening of the present week
to arrange for tin- vigorous district cam
paigns that It has been decided to wage
all along tho line. They also will report
at th<- meeting of next Saturday evening.
Charged With Battery.
Charles Scott, who was arrested Sun-
day night for assaulting Grace Rodgers,
as told in yesterday's fall, was formally
chnrgf-d with battery last evening by Ser
geant Martin. The woman yesterday re
gained her power of speech, of which she
wan temporarily deprived, due to the ef
fects Â«,r the boating she received. For
some unexplained reason Justice Barry
released Scott on his own recognizance.
The Day's Fires.
An alarm was tinned In from box 64 at
2:10 yesterday afternoon for a fire In the
dwelling of Mrs. S. Midlrton at 406 Te
hama street. Tho blazo started from
sparks from the chimney, and the dam
I boys made good use of them, for the milk is
much better than the water we pet to drink.
i Before we landed some 1200 Spaniards made a
I demonstration as if to oppose our landing. The
i Kunboats and cruisers turned loose on them
and shelled them out of the place. Some Cu
bans arrived shortly afterward, *" our landing
really was not opposed. Two colored boys Of
the Tenth Cavalry were unfortunately drowned.
At GuantanHmo the marines have cartured the
forts and hold the place.
Leaving the landing place we marched twelve
miles to a seaport town over hill and through
jungle. My left knee came neuriy giving out.
but 1 struggled through safely. The Spaniards
held this town. Before we came to this place
the Cubans began lighting them. Then our
regulars came up and the Spaniards Imme
diately fled. We captured eighteen prisoners,
I two enclnes and about SOO tons of coal ln
j tended tor the Vizcaya and other war vesseis.
Here we camped for the night, and early the
next morning we started forward. About
three miles trom the latter place we ran into
2500 or 3000 Spaniards in ambush. They simply
raised the devil with us for a while. They had
a Hotchkiss and three machine guns. \\ c
walked right into It and they turned loose on
us. We deployed and started to Hank out. For
two hours it was the hottest fight it could pos
sibly be. We were enfiladed and got right In
a cross-fire. We had two aetro regiments
with us and they fought well. It was my first
experience of battle and among bullets. Our
troop had two killed. One was killed right
next to me. He was In my squad. He never
knew he was hit. The whole regiment lost
nine killed, one captain and forty-six wounded.
| We have found sixty-one jead Spaniards. They
take their wounded with them, for the Cuban*
always massacre them, and they expect like
treatment from us. They are on the run be
fore us. It is a wonder that our whole troop
was not killed, for we were within fifty yards
of the machine gun and did not know it. The
Spaniards used explosive bullets, contrary to
the rules of war. The Spaniards say we are
fools in the way which we fight. They say:
"We (Spanish) tir* a volley and run back, and
you fool Americans lire and then run forward.
The major told us we would never be In hot
ter f're again, which is a relief. I Troop, you
can see was in the thickest of the fight and
of course lost the most men In the last stuge
before the Spaniards ran. We got on thUr
i flank and si. t the gunners. We camped on
their own camp ground. ith love. Sin
cerely yours. CHARLES C. BULL.
The envelopes containing the above let
ters were indorsed:
"Willi.im O. O'Nell, captain First Regi
ment United States Volunteer Cavalry,
commanding A Troop."
This gallant officer, it will be remem
bered, has since been killed in battle.
. Mrs. Alpheus Bull of Belmont received
yesterday the following telegram:
PORT TAMPA, Fla., July 9, IS9S.
To Mrs. Alpheus Bull. Belmont, Cal.â
: sick with rheumatism. Telegraph some money.
In first battle. CHARLES C. BILL.
Mrs. Bui! is naturally much disturbed.
: Prompted by maternal forebodings that
the dispatch has minimized the nature
and extent of her son's illness, she will
start on Tuesday night for Port Tampa.
It is to be hoped that she will find hei
heroic son sufficiently convalescent to be
brought home.
MUSTERING COMPLETED.
The Eighth Regiment Begins
the Real Work of Hard
Drilling.
CAMP BARRETT, Sather Station, July
| 11.â Captain Murray. U. S. A., has com
pleted his work of mustering into the vol
unteer army the Eighth Regiment of Cali
fornia Infantry. United States Volunteers.
The last to be mustered were First Lieu
tenant John R. Tyrrell, who has been as
signed to Company H of Redding; First
Lieutenant W. E. Smith, the former cap
tain of the Redding company, and Second
Lieutenant Frank S. Drady, both of whom
have been assigned to Company L of
Marysville. It will require some time for
Captain Murray to complete the muster
rolls and clerical work required. The
transfer of property to the regimental offl
' cers will be attended to next.
The discipline of camp has been drawn
: close and from now on the soldier boys
will have earnest work before them. Regi
mental, battalion and company drills hayÂ«
begun and will be daily features of, vie
camp life herea.f,ter. Both Colonel Hen
shaw and Lieutenant Colonel Carrington
will drill the regiment, while Lieutenant
Colonel Carrington and Majors Whittun
i and Forbes will drill the battalions. The
company lieutenants will be exercised in
drilling the companies from time to time,
thus giving all an oportunity to become
, proficient In handling th*-ir commands.
The matter of a chaplain is still held in
abeyance, although there is any quantity
of material to select from. The services
Sunday were conducted by Rev. Jesse
1 Smith and his workers from the End--.iv
orers' Seamen's Rest at 700 Broadway,
Oakland. Arrangements have been made
' for a special gospel service Thursday af
ternoon at 3 o'clock, with Rev. E. R. Dille,
; D.D.. as the speaker. Ther is a large
1 number of earnest Christian men in the
; regiment. Teh reading and writing tent
of the t'hristlan Commission was erected
near the hospital tents this afternoon.
The dally routine of guard mount to
night showed a gre.it improvement over
; former occasions. The men and non
commissioned officers went through the
tactics in a creditable manner. Cnptaln
H. L. Partridge of Company B was officer
of the day. Lieutenant E. R. McDonell of
Company G officer of the guard. Lieuten
ant H. W. Everson, Company C. super
officer of the guard. There were two ser
geants, three corporals, fifty-four pri
vates and one musician in the detail. The
work of the band is a surprise to the of
ficers. Organized but five days, from men
who never played together before, they
have, become an attraction, under the
skillful leadership of Mr. Gomez. Richard
McKilllcan, son of ex-Sheriff McKillican,
carries the honors of drum major with
ease and dignity. New suits have been
ordered, and will soon be ready for the
boys' use.

Charley Tye and Morris Jacobs to
Meet in the Olympic
Club.
Matchmaker W. J. Kennedy of the
Olympic Club arranged one of the bouts
last night that will he preliminary to the
meting of Frank McConnell and Tommy
Tracey on August 2.
The match is between Charley Tye of
the Reliance Club. Oakland, and Morris
Jacobs, the "midget Sandow." The men
will box ten rounds and will weigh In at
125 pounds. Tye is well known here as
a clever boxer and hard hitter.
Jacobs has never performed on this
coast. 11 Is small of stature but muscled
liko a Hercules. He has a reputation aÂ»
both a boxer and wrestler. Before bein*
matched with Tye he was severely "tried
out" In th.> Olympic Club gymnasium and
acquitted himself creditably.
Superintendent Kennedy will endeavor
to match Charlie Reno and Jack Gran
field for an eight round bout to-day.
Tracey will train at Croll's Gardens,
Alameda, and will do much of his worn
on thf road.
Billy Klmer, the actor-boxer, has retired
from the ring. Ho has accepted th*> posi
tion of manager of a Port Orford cannery
and will henceforth devote himself to
business. He may have need occasionally
for his knowledge of boxing, as the men
of the canneries settle many of their dif
ferences with nature's weapons.

nexed to Department
of California.
There was considerable of a stir at military headquarters yester
day afternoon upon the receipt of several important telegrams from
the War Department, the most important of which was the one from
Adjutant General Corbln attaching the Hawaiian Islands to the De
partment of California. The telegram was directed to Major General
Merriam, commanding the department, and reads as follows:
"It has been decided to include the Hawaiian Islands in the
Department of California. The First New York Regiment of Volun
teers, now en route to San Francisco, is probably the best equipped
for service at Honolulu."
This puts the new territory under the jurisdiction of General Mer
riam, who, in addition to the Department of California, has also un
der his command the Department of the Columbia, In other words
his jurisdiction now Includes California. Neveda, Oregon, Washington,
Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands, making a vast area and largely in
creasing the business of the commander.
Honolulu Is now the intermediate station between the Department
of California and the Department of the Pacific, the latter including
the Philippine Islands, in command of Major General Merritt, whose
headquarters are at Manila. This not only makes Honolulu a very im
portant naval station, but adds much to the importance of San Fran
cisco as a depot of supplies.
General Merriam at once appreciating the gTeat responsibility
that has been placed upon him has already put on his thinking cap
to work out the military programme for the islands. He said last
evening that he proposes at an early day to take a trip to Honolulu
and spend some little time there for the purpose of thoroughly ac
quainting himself with the situation and learning the needs of the
near future.
A military post will be established at Honolulu. One regiment,
without much doubt the First New Tork Volunteers, will at once be
established there as the garrison and very likely several batteries of
artillery will be sent there at no distant day. The colonel of the In
fantry regiment will be the commander of the post. There also will
be a quartermaster and a commissary officer stationed there.
The transports Peru and City of Puebla will sail for Manila on
Thursday by the way of Honolulu, where a stay of perhaps two
weeks will be made. Major General Otis and his staff will sail on
the Peru. His staff is composed of Brigadier General R P. Hughes.
United States Volunteers, inspector general, chief of staff of the De
partment of the Pacific: Lieutenant Colonel T. H. Barry, assistant
adjutant general; Major John S. Mallory, Inspector general: Captain
Charles McClure of the Eighteenth Infantry, acting judge advocate;
Captain John L. Sehon, assistant adjutant general and aid, and First
Lieutenant F. TV. Sladen of the Fourteenth Infantry, aid.
The baggage of the troops will be put on board the transports to
day and the soldiers who are ordered t" be in readiness will embark
to-morrow. The following is the official order:
Headquarters Independent Division, Eighth Army Corps. Phelan Building,
Pan Francisco, Cal.. July 11. IR9S. Special Orders. No. 39:
2.â The following designated troops of this command will be placed In
readiness to embark for the Philippine Islands In steamers City of Puebla
and Peru by Tuesday next, the 12th instant, and are assigned to ves
sels as follows:
On the steamer City of Puebla: Headquarters and remaining companies
o? the Fourteenth United States Infantry; recruits of First and Second Bat
talions of the Eighteenth and Twenty-third United States Tnfantry: pnllsted
men of the First North Dakota, First Wyoming and First Tdaho Regiments
of Volunteers, medical officers and members of the hospital corps to be
hereafter announced.
On the steamer Peru: Squadron of thp Fourth T'nlted States Cav
alry designated for expeditionary proposes; light batteries of the Sixth
United States Artillery, detachment of the Third T'nited States Artlllereyâ
members of batteries which have already embarked; one company of the
signal corps. T'nited States Volunteers, and such medical officers and mem
bers of the hospital corps as may be hereafter named.
By command of Major General Otis.
THOMAS H. BARRY. Assistant Adjutant General.
The Peru and City of Puebla will remain at Honolulu until the ar
rival of the next fleet, which will bo composed of the Pennsylvania, the
Rio Janeiro and the St. Paul. This fleet is slated to sail within ten
days, but what troops it will carry has not yet been decided. This
matter will be left to Major General Merriam, v, ho is to have charge
of all the Philippine expeditionary forces remaining here after the de
parture of Major General Otis. The regiment to be stationed at Hon
olulu will be transported within a few days on a vessel yet to be char
tered.
General Otis, while waiting for this regiment and the three other
transports, will arrange matters at Honolulu for the military post and
have everything in readiness for the demonstration in honor of the
annexation, in which all the troops of the five vessels, together with
the garrison regiment, will take part. At Honolulu General Otis will
receive additional orders from Washington.
Rear Admiral Joseph N. Miller, who sails for Honolulu on the
Philadelphia on the 20th, will have charge of the naval demonstra
tion and of the ceremony of raising the American flag over the Ha
waiian Islands, as he is the ranking officer.
In case the New Tork regiment is not fully equipped the Seventh
or Eighth California will in all probability be ordered to Honolulu.
REJOICING IN THE
SUNSET DISTRICT
! CELEBRATING THE ACQUISITION
OF CAR SERVICE.
Mass-Meeting of Citizens, Followed
by an Evening of Music
and Dancing.
i
Lights out and locked doors were the or
: der of things in the Sunset District last
' night except at the corner of H street and
Ninth avenue, where the people assemhled
to give vent to their joy over the aequlsl
i tion of some of the many things for which
j they had been contending during the past
| year. Among these were the completion
; of an intersecting sewer, a sufficient water
supply and a direct line of cars to the val
i ley by the sea.
These they got; but, alas, the district is
' still in Egyptian darkness. There is nnt a
j glimmer of either gas or electric lights to
J be seen west of Stanyan street, and cltl
! Zens who turned out last night guided
: themselves to the hall by the aid of a '49
' lantern. Nevertheless the hall was not
sufficiently large to half accommodate
those who did come.
The new line of electric cars brought
quite a crowd from the city east of the
dividing line. Among those who swelled
the crowd were E. P. Vlning, manager of
the Market Street Railroad Company;
Miss Vining, School Director E. L. Head,
Supervisors Lackmann, Sheehan, Brltt
and Devany. Joe O'Ponnell, Charles Ga
gus, Frank Conklin, whitewasher for tho
! School Department, and many more who
| came to loin the hospitable residents ot
; the favored Sunset Valley.
President Kelley of the Sunset District
Improvement Club presided and Intro
duced the speakers. Miss Irma L. Tilden,
principal speaker of the evening, delivered
an address of welcome.
After the address, which was generously
'. applauded, the remaining part of the pro
gramme was carried out. It consisted of
recitations and home-made songs applica
ble to the Sunset Valley, with dancing and
a sumptuous repast in the large hall down
stairs.

SHE WAS DESPONDENT.
Nellie Sullivan Dies From the Effects
of an Overdose of Paregoric.
A middle-aged woman named Nellie
Sullivan died in the Receiving Hospital
yesterday from the effects of a
dose of paregoric, taken with sui
cidal intent. The unfortunate woman
lived at 119 Ninth street. At
6 o'clock yesterday morning a friend
named George Davis rapped on the door
of her room, but failing to get a response
forced an entrance.
Lying on the floor, her head partly un
der the bed, was Mrs. Sullivan, appa
rently in a dying condition. After placing
her in bed Davis summoned a doctor, who
advised her removal to the Receiving
Hospital. Notwithstanding the efforts of
the doctors she died last evening without
regaining consciousness.
In his statement to Detective Ed Gib
son, Davis said that Mrs. Sullivan had
frequently threatened to do away with
herself. He met her last May, he said,
and they agreed to live together.
Mrs. Lay, who lives in the house in
which the unfortunate woman took the
fatal dose, claims that Mrs. Sullivan in
formed her several days ago that she
would have to "take something" to pro
duce sleep, or she would go crazy.

HELP THE GOOD WORK.
Troops Will Probably March Aboard

Japanese residents have shown their
sympathy with the Red Cross Society by
generously responding to the call of the
local Japanese bank and subscribing $ISS.
The latter sum comes from the local so
ciety, and is in appreciation of the great
work now being performed by the organi
zation. The bank has also added $25, mak
ing a neat sum to be used In the good
work. The Japanese were asked a
few <tays ago to lend their aid, and very
quickry responded. It is thought that more
funds will come from the same quarter.
Armed with neatly printed books con
taining numbered receipts, and stubs, the
ladies on the subscription committee have
started out again on their pursuit for sub
scriptions. They are meeting with the
same success as on their initial trip, as
the merchants are fully aware of the
noble work already done by the society
they represent.
Mrs. John F. Merrill, president of the
local society, returned yesterday from a
much-needed vacation, and took up the
reins of governing the destinies of the
local branch.
Donations for the much-needed hospital
ship are pouring in. Among the subscrip
tions received by Mrs. E. R. Diamond yes
terday was $1 from Mrs. M. V. B. Brad

Captain Baldwin accepted the gift in a
grateful little speech. He was taken en
tirely unawares in the matter, as he had
been induced to attend the gathering on
some pretext, there being no hint that
he was to play so prominent a part in
the proceedings.
He was followed by Major Forbes, who
has. been a lifelong friend of Captain
Baldwin. He told of their ambition to see
active service in Cuba and said that from
what he knew of the captain his sword
would never be sheathed in dishonor.
Captain Dunleavy of the Harbor Police
spoke in behalf of the department of
which Captain Baldwin has been a mem
ber. The addresses were all liberally ap
plauded.
DIVISION HOSPITAL.
Visiting Civilians, and Espe
cially Ladies, Break the Rules
and the Patients Suffer.
Some time ago Surgeon Major W. O.
Owen, in charge of the Division Hospi
tal, made a complaint to Major General
Otis about the indiscriminate way in
which civilians visited the hospital and
went among the sick soldiers. He point-
Ed out that serious consequences might
result from this, such as the spreading 1 of
an epidemic. This was easily possible,
as the visitors "would go in the infectious
wards, and were in danger of catching
diseases themselves. They were in the
habit of slipping- in when no one was
watching. As a result of this letter
guards were posted around the hospital.
It was learned yesterday beyond the
shadow of a doubt that Major Owen has
again had cause to complain of civilian
visitors and that he has written a let
ter to Major General Otis requesting that
the severest measures be immediately
adopted to prevent the admission to the
hospital of any person, citizen, so Âier or
officer, who has not written authority to
be admitted.
This letter is a result of very serious
consequences. On Sunday some lady vis
itors managed by some pretext to get by
the guards and were admitted. They en
tered one of the tents where some of the
pick were confined and fed the men on
cheese sandwiches with the result that
Private Burkland of the Twenty-third
Infantry had to be removed to the French
Hospital with convulsions. He is now
critically 111. It was also found that a
number of the sick had been supplied
with medicines not prescribed by any of
the Division Hospital surgeons, and
which would have had serious results had
the patients taken them before they were
found. These medicines were given to
the soldiers presumably by the lady vis
itors. There is no doubt that in the fu
ture every precaution will be taken to
exclude every one not entitled to admis
sion to the hospital.

YOU MUST REGISTER.
ALL citizens who desire to vote at the coming
elections must register. Former registration
does not count. The necessity oi registering
anew applies to everybody. That iact does not seem
to be generally understood, for although general
registration has been in progress for upward of five
weeks only about 8000 out of the 73,000 voters of the
city have attended to it.
The old maxim, "go early and avoid the rush," is
particularly pertinent to the duty of registration. It
is a task that requires some little time to perform,
and those who delay to the closing weeks of registra
tion rind themselves compelled to wait in the office a
long time before they can get their names recorded.
That has been the case in every general registration
in the city. There are people who put everything
off to the last moment, and their name is legion.
That class crowd one another at the registration of
fice during the last days and make a tedious work of
what could have been readily and quickly done had
they attended to it earlier when there was no rush.
It should be borne in mind that registration closes
August 9 and that time flies fast. Of the total num
ber of citizens who will have to register to vote, only
about 10 per cent have attended to it up to this time.
That means that over 60.000 voters will have to regis
ter between now and the closing day. As the time
grows shorter the rush will increase and the crowd
at the office will augment. That means the neces
sity of waiting in line will become more certain, and
the waiting longer with the passing of each succes
sive day.
A word to the wise should be sufficient. Register
now. To-day will be better for the purpose than to
morrow, and to-morrow better than next day. By
attending to the duty at once your registration can
be made in five minutes. By postponing it until
later it may take you half a day to get to the desk.
Get your name on the register at once.
HEARST'S WEAK APOLOGY.
HEARST evidently has heard of the laughter and
indignation excited by his story of the beheading
of forty Spanish prisoners. He hastens to cor
rect a false impression by explaining that the number
was four instead of forty. This is a start in the right
direction. He should have eliminated the four and
left the cipher as the representative of the truth in
his weird yarn.
But the real secret seems to be revealed in Hearst's
opening words: "On a day when my experiences
were uneventful, I sent you from the field near Si
boney a description of Colonel Lame and his story
of his day's adventures," etc. Or, to put the same
thing in other language, when there was not truth to
tell Hearst sent a fantastic lie. There is reason for
believing that he regrets now having done so, but his
efforts to squirm from under the consequences are
not marked by dignity. The correspondent who in
the absence of news forwards a fake cannot get into
good standing again. He hoists himself without the
pale.
The correspondent goes so far as to admit that he
cannot be positive of the accuracy of Lame's story.
He does not make clear why he sent it if he doubted
it or why he applauded Horse Doctor Lainc, who is
either an immeasurable liar or an assassin. More
over, Hearst has a wrong idea as to the reasons
Americans object to such stuff. It is not out of sym
pathy for the Spaniards. It is because they do not like
stupid fakes, and because the honor and welfare of
their soldiers is held by them in considerable regard.
They do not wish to have the regulars and volunteers
rated as bloody-handed marauders accessory to willful
murder, nor do they wish such fool reports to reach
the ears of the Spaniards, who, believing them, would
be goaded to new and in part excusable excess.
Hearst's apology is weak, as the thing for which he
apologizes was absurd and malign.
Soldiers deserting from the Spanish affirm that
during the last three months their pay had consisted
of three packages of cigarettes. Of course no
civilian is competent to criticize military matters, but
it is almost safe to affirm that such wages are insuffi
cient to keep patriotism up to a white hjeat.
Some of the soldiers here are beginning to fear
they are to sec no active service, but their alarm is
groundless. If they do not get to Manila there is
a demand in Cuba and a promise that things will be
interesting in either place they land.
If it is true the officers of Cervera's fleet heard of
the battle of Manila only after their capture it is cer
tain the Spanish have such a way oi suppressing
news ;is this country knows nothing about.
Blanco still urges "war to the end." If he will
glance back at history he will ascertain that the habit
of war to keep right on to the end is invariable.
Gentlemen who are engaged in wiring verbatim ac
counts of supposititious conversations between Samp
Â«on and Schley ought to send news instead.
THE VAGARIES OF AMBITION.
THAT excellent aspirant, Dr. Pardee, who gives
to the public every day his good opinion of him
self in his own newspaper, has agreeably varied
the matter by enlarging, through the same channel,
his bad opinion of The Call.
It is a piece of innocent finesse which moves a pro
fessional beauty to heighten her charms by placing
them near a very plain, if possible very ugly, person.
The excellent aspirant of Alameda County has been
looking around for a foil to his good opinion of
himself, and has found it in The Call. His disregard
for this paper is frankly admitted to be caused by the
"fights" it has made. The Call's fight against a cor
rupt or neglectful Los Angeles City Council and a
grasping water company in possession of the city s
water plant and demanding an enormous ransom
therefor is admitted by the excellent aspirant to be
disagreeable to him. He exults that, as he says, The
Call lost that fight. He may exult prematurely, but
even hair trigger exultation, fired too soon, may get
him the sympathy of the millionaires who dole out
drinking water to the people of Los Angeles for a
consideration from works that belong to the people.
It seems worth trying, and the excellent aspirant
tries it.
The next feature in his bad opinion of The Call is
his dislike for the fight we made against the gang in
San Jose. Having the push in his own county with
him, his sympathies go out to the push everywhere.
The gang politician whose nights are lushy and whose
days are bleary, whose breath would draw buzzards
and kill them when they come are at present the con
fidants of the excellent aspirant, and not a nerve in
him protests when they whisper to him. The push
in San Jose are his valued friends just now and The
Call is under the ban for fighting the same.
Gently gliding from censure for the afflictions we
visited upon these persons and corporations who are
useful to his excellent aspirations, the doctor proceeds
to rejoice that the San Francisco charter was adopted,
not because it is a good charter, but because The
Call opposed it. In like manner he rejoices that Ha
waii was taken in, not because it was right to do so,
but because we opposed it. Pushing himself into the
company of things wrong and men vile, opposed by
The Call, he introduces himself as fit for Governor
because of the company he keeps.
We will be very glad to feel that he is fit, since we
rejoice when unfit men refrain from ambitions that are
I too large for their capacity. But Dr. Pardee must
I bear with us. We were not informed of his transcend
ent qualities until he bought a newspaper in which to
j tell us what they are. His virtues were hidden under
j a bushel until he bought a phylactery on which to
I display them. As his case, therefore, differs so widely
! from that of other aspirants, we must have time to
i see him as he sees himself. They must content them
; selves with such public statements of their qualities
\as may be volunteered by others. The doctor does
j not wait for appreciation to come to him over such a
I slow road. He carries appreciation with him and
puts it on tap in his own newspaper. Perhaps had we
i known sooner how well he stands with himself, how
I thoroughly he enjoys himself in his own company and
how much he admires his many talents, we would
1 think as much of him as he does himself. But, even
then, we are painfully aware that we would not stand
I well with him. Love is jealous. Behind Cupid flies
i the bat-winged, green-eyed monster. The doctor
brooks no rival as a lover of himself. The dear
I caress, the stolen interview, the balcony tryst, must
ibe by himself and with himself. With him love's
I young dream has himself for its dear object, and no
; rival must enter the charmed circle where he sits on
: his cAvn knee, affectionately whispering soft nothings
! into his own ear.
POLITICAL GASTRONOMICS.
IT is characteristic of the Populists that at the be
ginning of every campaign they look around for
somebody to swallow them. The delegates to the
State convention of the party which meets at Sacra
mento to-day have for some time been discussing the
situation with a view to being deposited by the Demo
cratic organization where the whale deposited Jonah.
They have no idea of swallowing the Democracy.
They realize that it is their mission on earth to be
eaten and they subject themselves to the process with
a self-sacrificing spirit which, in a less laughable
part}-, would be sublimely heroic.
It is also characteristic of the Populists that they
generally quarrel over the meal that is made of them.
This is due to the circumstance that among the dele
gates to every Populist convention there are always a
number of men who do not want offices and who, con
sequently, are devoted somewhat to principle. These
men continually object to being swallowed by any
body. They believe their only hope of political suc
cess consists in maintaining a single flag pole with a
separate set of nailed colors. Some of them know
from experience that when the Democrats swallow
them success at the polls only result* in Democratic
officeholders. They also know that there can be no
assimilation of principles in political parties, even if
it were possible for a swallowed party to get any of
the offices after election; and so they always object to
being swallowed. At Sacramento to-day the anti
swallowers will be called middle-of-the-road Popu
lists.
We refer to these matters, not because they are in
any sense news, but for the purpose of calling atten
tioa to the tendency of history to repeat itself. The
Populist national convention in 1896 was not swal
lowed, but it downed at a single gulp the Presidential
candidate of the so-called National Democracy. The
result of the attempt to swallow a half-breed Popu
list arrayed in Democratic vestments was over
whelming defeat at the polls. Bryan and the Wat
son-Sewall combination, a freak ticket with two tails,
ended where it should have commenced â in a
museum.
At Sacramento to-day the Populists are evidently
intent on repeating their history. They are going to
eschew the gastronomic necessity of their existence,
as their predecessors did at St. Louis, and nominate
a half-breed Populist for Governor â James G. Ma
guire. Later on the Democrats will choose the same
candidate, and thus again the political rag tag and
bobtail of the State will enter the campaign with a
two-tailed freak ticket.
It is said that Mr. Shanahan, Governor Budd's
Code Commissioner, is pledged to defeat this pro
gramme,, but we are convinced that Tie will not be
able to do so. Next to being swallowed by office
seeking organizations of politicians the chief end of
Populism is to place before the people freak tickets.
A ticket with two tails will be too great a tempta
tion for the Sacramento faithful. Even middle-of
the-road logic will not suffice to distract the attention
of the bewhiskcred party from such a delightful situ
ation. The fact that Bryan lost on a similar com
bination signifies nothing. The Populists in one re
spect resemble the Spanish. The only way to get an
idea into their heads is to beat it in with a thirteen
inch gun.
Even the most enthusiastic young woman ought to
realize that a soldier in a buttonless uniform is labor
ing under hardships which his country never ex
pected him to endure.
THE SAX FRA K CISCO CALL* TUESDAY, JULY 12, 1898.
OUR NOBLE BATTLE-SHIP-
rROM reports given of the naval battle off San
tiago by officers of the American fleet it appears
that while all the ships bore their part nobly
and all the crews performed their dangerous duty
with conspicuous courage the chief praise and honor
are due to our own Californian built battle-ship, the
Oregon. This special praise and honor is in no
wise a reflection upon other ships ot the fleet. How
ever good all may be in any' particular company, there
is always one better than the rest. In this case the
superior one was the Oregon, and the superiority
seems to be like that of Saul among his brothers:
"head and shoulders above the rest."
From the outbreak of the war to this time good
fortune has afforded the Oregon an opportunity to
display her incomparable excellence as a battle-ship.
These opportunities have put her to severe tests, and
had she been weak in any part or particular they
would have been accounted misfortunes rather than
good fortunes for her. She was first tried by a long
voyage around the Horn and found to be as good an
ocean-going craft as ever met the winds and waves
with a frolic welcome. Next it fell to her lot to
carry the first company of Americans to land on
Cuban soil. Finally, as if no honor was to be
denied her, she had the glory at Santiago of fighting
four Spanish ships at once.
All of these opportunities added to the glory of
the Oregon simply because she was able to profit by
them, master them and compel them to serve as evi
dences of her superb qualities. The conspicuous
part she played at Santiago was not due to chance.
As a matter of fact the lowa from her position at the
time the Spanish fleet emerged from the bay had the
better chance of distinction, since she was the nearest
of the American fleet and got in the first shot. The
Oregon, however, was the first to get up steam, and
by her superior speed managed to cut out the lowa
and get the place of honor in the forefront of the
running battle for herself.
The brilliant honors of the Oregon reflect an equal
honor upon the working shipbuilders of San Fran
cisco. The brawny, earnest men, whose names are
unknown to fame, who constructed the big ship, and
who put good, honest, patriotic work into her from
the day her keel was laid until the day she was turned
over to the Government a completed ship, are the
men to whom honor belongs for her glorious record.
Give as much credit as we may to her officers and
her seamen, their skill could not have carried her
through the stormy ocean around the Horn if she
had not been well built, she could not have stood
the cannonading of four Spanish ships in succession
if her armor plate had not been put on well and
strong, neither could she have stood the strain of
the firing of her own big guns if there had been a
weak spot of careless workmanship in any part of her
hull or machinery.
When we give honor to the noble Oregon, there
fore, let us not forget the workmen of the Union Iron
Works. They built a ship that has to-day a prouder
record than any other battle-ship on the globe, and
San Francisco is proud to claim them as her own.
& HERALD OF DARKNESS.
A SALT LAKE paper, the existence of which we
cheerfully make known outside its township,
and called therein the Herald, in a recent issue
contributed to the gayety and likewise the misin
formation of nations by an attack on The Call and
its proprietor, in which The Call is accused of being
the "latest ally of Spain," and of expressing its con
tempt for "American volunteers."
The Salt Lake paper probably has all seasons for
lying, and the feculent exhalations from its columns
indicate that the name of the president of its company
has no lid.
The Call is too busy in the promotion of the Red
Cross and other public activities and patriotic expres
sions to traverse the Salt Lake organ's emanation of
the pulseless emulsion which it mistakes for brains.
The red coal which seems to have touched its rep
tilian nerve was found in The Call's criticism of poli
ticians appointed to military commands without the
soldierly training, taste or experience^ to qualify them
for positions in which the lives of thousands of men
depend upon the training to arms and tactics of their
leaders. Oddly enough the Salt Lake fellow speaks
of Ben Butler as an ideal general lifted from civil life
to a command at the beginning of the Civil War.
While Butler was probably the best of the cornstalk
generals, yet he and Banks and the other politicians
cost the lives of thousands of volunteer privates by
their ignorance of the art of war and their incapacity
to acquire it in actual service.
It is the opinion of the Salt Lake organ that igno
rance of military matters and lack of training therein
are no bar to a commission to command troops. Its
models for officers are frankly announced to be Mr.
Hearst and William J. Bryan!
One can fancy the pleasure of the seasoned Spanish
officers at the pro?pect of being called on to meet
armies led by such commanders!
An investigation of the list of stockholders of the
Herald Company reveals the cause of its misery.
Confirmed idiocy and incapacity had reduced it to
beggary and blackmail, and a few silver millionaires
took it under shelter. The wandering magdalen has
waxed on three meals a day and now wants admission
into society as a "lydy." Remembering Messrs.
Bryan and Hearst as acquaintances of old days, they
are naturally commended as "gents" for whom noth
ing is too good.
One of the Pullman boys wants to join the army,
but he wants also to have a commission. His im
pulse seems to be of a dual sort. Part of it comes
from patriotism and the rest from that quality best
described as "nerve." Civilian kids who want to get
into the army and are too proud to carry a musket
ought to be encouraged to stay out. However, if
Pullman will organize a regiment of sleeping-car
porters and arm them with whisk brooms they might
forage to the consternation and ultimate disaster of
the enemy.
There seems to be no doubt the Spanish naval offi
cers thought the American ships a lot of tubs, manned
by aliens who would not fight, and Americans them
selves much given to words and to nothing more
dangerous. It is reasonable to suppose the Spanish
officers have changed their minds.
The only way to ascertain the conditions prevail
ing in the Klondike seems to be to go there. If you
get rich it's a good place; if you freeze to death as
the only method of escaping starvation its disad
vantages will have to be acknowledged.
Spaniards are denouncing a "bought press." They
have not progressed so far as to term it yellow. Be
sides, this, being the national color, might fail to con
vey the desired meaning. â¢
This country is not ready to accept as true the
statement that any of the Spanish have had their heads
cut off. They seem to have lost them in some other
way.
Next time the Colorado boys toss a peddling
nuisance in a blanket they should send him higher
and then lose their grip on the blanket
DEMOCRACY OR IMPERIALISMâ WHICH?
Possible Alignment of Parties.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 11, 1898.
To the Editor of f~e San Francisco Callâ Sir: Since my communication
in The Call of Monday, July 4, appeared, so far as that result can be ob
tained by an unconstitutional resolution, Hawaii has been annexed. I sup
pose the annexation must be regarded as an accomplished fact, though with
out any law to sanction it. When an Englishman with his feet in the stocks
was told by an educated bystander that under the laws of Great Britain
the punishment was unconstitutional, he replied, "But, you see, I am here."
In relation to Hawaii the identity of the situation is apparent. I observe
that even Senator Hoar, who has manifested some regard for the consti
tution of his country, was betrayed into gross inconsistency, and while pro
testing against a policy of conquest found an excuse for this gross depar
ture from fundamental American principles. The excuse, however, was as
irrational as the act is dangerous. There have been precedents for the un
constitutional acquisition of territory, of which the case Ojf Texas is the
most conspicuous. But in that instance the injury resulting from Congres
sional disregard of the organic law was minimized, because the territory was
on this continent and in every sense desirable, and it was converted into a
great and prosperous State which some day may be divided into five. More
over, the annexation of Texas in no way interfered with the Monroe doc
trine, and apart from the question of slavery it did not involve the absorp
tion, against their own will, of a ser.vile population, incapable of being even
educated into a capacity for American citizenship.
It Is useless, however, to cry over spilt milk. So far as Hawaii is con
cerned the game is made and must be accepted as it is. The annexation, in
its essence, is a conquest, achieved by strategy instead of force. Is this to be
the end of the new departure or are we on the verge of revolution? This is
the transcendent question now, for If the whetted beak of the American eagle
is to be plunged into the flesh of humanity, whether broiling in the torrid
zone or freezing in the arctic region, so complete a departure from the
theory and the practice of the republic means political revolution and noth
ing less.
The British Government is a mass of expedients wonderfully adapted to
a settled policy of imperial colonization, which has been slowly developed
and inflexibly extended for centuries. The administration of that Govern
ment at home and abroad has been an unprecedented combination of power,
diplomacy and statesmanship. On the other hand, the Government of the
United States, as It was founded and as it has existed for more than a hun
dred years, was the first organized expression of the most deep-seated as
piration of man, namely, for the exercise of his own sovereignty, limited
only by the interests and necessities which are common to all. It rested,
therefore, upon an eternal principle, and, in an abstract or theoretical sense,
was the most perfect government upon earth. Its practical success was
measurably guaranteed, not only by the race from which it came, but by the
Declaration of Independence and the Federal and State constitutions. Its
administration for more than a century, with many defects and perturba
tions and in spite of internal corruption, on the whole was the most re
markable achievement in history. The Monroe doctrine, while in no respect
interfering with the extension of commerce and the ordinary relations be
tween civilized nations, kept our political system free from European and
Asiatic entanglements and gave us ample range for the consolidation and
elevation of our people between the two oceans and from the chain of great
lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. And when the Pacific supersedes the Atlantic,
as it may largely do in the twentieth century, while avoiding the debauching
influences of Asiatic immigration, Alaska and the great West secured us a
commanding position in that mighty development.
The mission of Great Britain, whatever the original motives which pro
pelled it in the extension of Its dominion, was and is to prepare the
world for liberty and civilization. The mission of the United States was
and is to establish for all time a government, resting upon freedom and
order, without an unnecessary trammel upon the limbs of humanity, and,
therefore, adapted to the highest phases of individual, industrial, intel
lectual and social progress. These two missions are distinct from each
other, and yet, in the order of Providence, inseparably connected. The
one demanded indefinite and rapid expansionâ the other, limitation to this
continent, until the work of the fathers had been so consolidated and
strengthened that the edifice they had projected and founded could not be
overthrown. We had sufficient territory for three hundred millions of
people. We had almost inexhaustible resources. Under the operation
of justly restrictive laws, the necessity for which was slowly forced upon
us, we gradually absorbed the best blood of the best elements of the
world. We stimulated education and made it general, and, by that train
ing and experience which, in conformity with our institutions, would ulti
mately extirpate religious bigotry and intolerance, while preserving that ele
stntial morality which holds society together, have raised citizenship to
ward a height which, if it is ever reached, will enable us to command a
view of manifest destiny on all continents and on all islands.
What is manifest destiny? It has been grossly misinterpreted by sec
tions of all political parties, and, in the midst of war, it is now being per
verted to an extent which, if realized, would destroy the constitution it
self. It does not mean filibusterism. It does not mean conquest by force
of arms. It does not mean the prostitution of our laws to the protection
of the speculative enterprises which, as I am credibly informed, are now
being pushed from Cuba to the Philippines by men who would justify the
false saying that "patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel." It does
mean that, when the wisdom of the fathers has been vindicated on this con
tinent, and our Government has absolutely ceased to be an experiment, and
the exquisite light of freedom, law and order illuminates the territory we
now occupyâ then our beneficent institutions will peacefully and certainly
extend themselves over other communities, prepared to receive them by
the colonizing labors of Great Britain and by the general advance of man
kind in intelligence, education and virtue.
When from the summit of Telegraph Hill Father Junipero Serra gazed
through the Golden Gate upon the blue Pacific he t- mght of the future
and his pure soul was filled with the spirit of prophecy. As Edmund
Randolph once said, three-quarters of a century later, an American specu
lator, on the same elevation, turned his back upon the Golden Gate and
looked upon the water underneath and he, too, thought of the future which,
to him, consisted of water lots at $500 apiece. Much of the sentimental rot
printed nowadays about the Philippines and Porto Rico has an underlying
motive no higher than speculation. The dream of c nquest which is so per
sistently encouraged in many quarters and which means the sapping of our
national vitality under the pretense of spreading American ideas, is to no
small extent the suggestion of sordid treason to the Constitution and to
every element in true Americanism. But there is another and a greater
danger to our institutions which springs from the most ardent patriotism
and from conceptions which would be lofty if they were not untrue. Old
men watch the trees in their slow growth and discern the forests of the
future. Young men become impatient and by undue stimulation produce an
apparent luxuriance which ends in decay and death. This tendency is Il
lustrated in the history of nations, and by the history -hich we are making
at the present moment. There are tens of thousands of ardent spirits who
would not hesitate to attempt the grafting of American vigor and energy
upon the Oriental rottenness c: the Philippines. The thing cannot be suc
cessfully done. It is our country, our constitution, our civilization, that
would suffer and not the Philippines. Providence cannot be forced or
driven and an American grip upon Asia or upon Spain would not raise them
up but would relax our muscles and weaken our digestive functions and
our nervous system.
Undoubtedly Spain must be thrashed; she is thrashed already. She
must also indemnify us for the war and give us security for payment.
But unless we are prepared for the failure of our republic we must not be
seduced or driven into the imperial colonization which is the peculiar func
tion of Great Britain, or into a policy of conquest, which would destroy
our constitutior xl system an<" emasculate ourselves.
Still the same class of influences which have secured the annexation
of Hawaii t 11 concentrate upon the project of imperial development under
republican forms, and I should not be surprised if, within a very short pe
riod, the question became a predominant issue in politics. Events crowd
rapidly upon us. and there Is a queer mixture in i arties as they exist.
There are Free Trade Republicans and Protection Democrats. There are
Sound Money Democrats and Free Silver Republican* The clear and dis
tinct issues that have divided parties in the past and which were based
upon conflicting principles not assailing the Constitution are either settled
or confused, and, in these days, the main controversy is over the division
of the spoils. A division upon the Constitution on the one side and Im
perial Americanism, if such a phase can be tolerated, on the other, would
be a renovating fact.
In our civil war the Constitution was rudely shaken, but the object of
the war was the Union, under and not without the Constitution, and, when
secession was defeated and peace declared, though not without much oscil
lation, the ship of state swung back to her constitutional moorings. There
she has securely ridden for many years, and, when the present storm is
over, I hope and I believe that she will be found anchored in the same place

He never comes here without giving birth
to something which is worthy of chroni
cling. As a man of daring enterprise and
of thorough gameness he has few su
periors. On Sunday night Mr. Ryan and
Tom McCarthy, the insurance adjuster>
were sitting in the Palace grill smoking
their post-prandial cigars and waiting for
an after-dinner drink, when Dr. Drucker
sauntered in. Introductions followed and
the School Director took a seat at the
table. He asked the gentlemen to nomi
nate their poison and put a dollar on the
table to settle once and for all any pos
sible quibbling concerning the privilege of
paying for the first round of drinks. Mr.
Ryan then repeated the actions of the
doctor, and he also placed a dollar upen
the table, saying, "Doctor, this is on me."
"Oh, no," replied the School Director,
and out came a twenty from his pocKet
with which he covered his silver dollar.
Without any hesitation or manifest sur
prise Mr. Ryan accepted the cue and did
likewise. It was now Drucker's turn to
respond to the ante and he did not fall.
Another twenty was added to the pile,
and almost simultaneously the stack be
longing to Mr. Ryan received an addi
tional story. Up the buildings rose until
each man had exposed on the table a gold
and silver stack of $141. If had been a
silent game of "I see you" up to this
point, but now Dr. Drucker began to
scratch his head. This was productive of
a wavering apology which evoluted, "I
have a $10 and a $5 piece left and that is
all, but 1 don't suppose you have any ob
jection, Mr. Ryan, to my drawing a
check."
With calm deliberation and a most
suave manner the gentleman from the
south said, "If you do, doctor, I will
cash it."
Mr. Ryan paid for the drink.

J HAPPINESS.
O happy man. To
o him has fallen
the lot of being
made ecstatically
Â° happy twice in
O the same day,
OOOOOOO^O and It is an ex
perience whichâ strange to sayâ he does
not wish to have repeated. Yesterday
Dr. Kenyon told Joe that he was a father
to sach a boy as the world never saw
bctcre. Joe was so delighted that he
started down the street at once to an
nounce the event In person. Ten min
utes after he reached the city's main
thoroughfare every man, woman and
child knew that an heir had been born,
to the house of Kerr. All Joe said as he
walked down the "line" was '"it's a boy."
No further explanation was given. In
one of the gilded palaces where Joe was
portraying the future for his 2-hour son
the telephone startled him from prophetic
indulgences, and it was discovered that
Joe was the party wanted by the person
at the other end of the line. It was the
doctor attending his wife who wished to
speak to him. Joe was advised to come
home at once as something very import
ant had happened. Joe lost no time. He
was out of that place in a second and
had boarded the first car home in less
time than the telling takes. He did not
even wait for the car to reach his house,
buc left it two blocks before it arrived
there and ran the rest of the distance
like a wild man. The doctor received
him ct the door, and after quieting Joe
somewhat he told him he had a very
interesting thing to show him. Joe was
taken into a dark room and was advised
to look on the bed. He did so and some
thing like the following came from his
lips: "Hello, what in the world is this.
This Is my boy, but who in the deuce ia
that stranger. Take it away. I don't
want him next to mine. Get it out ot
here." Then he ceased his diatribe for
a moment and appealed to the doctor:
"Doctor, tell me, if you love me, are there
two kids there. I don't see double, do
I? Now don't keep me in suspense!"
The doctor said there was only one, but
Joe was convinced of the correctness of
his perceptions and he persisted that
there was another, a stranger. In the new
crib. "Whose is it? When did it come
and who put it there?" Joe continued.
The doctor was forced to answer: "Job,
my boy, it 1b yours also. It was born
two hours after the other. There are
now in San Francisco a Dewey and Samp
son Kerr."
Joe is thoroughly happy, but let no
man wish him many happy returns of the
day.

Awarding of a Contract for
Hay at Nineteen and a
Half Per Ton.
The session of the Board of Supervis
ors yesterday afternoon was long drawn
out, but comparatively uneventful. The
fact that last Monday was a holiday laid
over many resolutions passed to print at
the preceding meeting, they m>t luivlag
been advertised a sufficient number s*
times to be taken up at yesterday's mn<
Ing.
Clinton introduced a resolution to reduce
the rates of fare on the street railroads.
There is the usual explanatory preamble,
and it reads as follows:
Whereas, In consideration of the many privi
leges granted to and enjoyed by them, and the
use of the public streets, the right and privi
lege ought to be granted in and on the street
railroads, operated in whole or in part in this
city and county, to certain ofrieers and em
, ployes of the city and couuty and to mall car
riers in the employment of the United States,
as -well us to mechanics and laborers during
certain hours of the day Jn going to and re
turning from their respective places of busi
ness: also to pupils of the public schools in
going to and returning from their respective
schools as herein provided; therefore, the peo
ple of the city and 'county of San Francisco do
ordain as follows:
The order goes on to provide that be
tween the hours of 6 and 7 a. m. and 5 and
6p. m. only 2\ 2 cents shall be charged for
a single fare. At other hours the fare will
remain at 5 cents. Police officers, mem
bers of the fire department, deputies of
the Superintendent of Public Streets,
members of tha Health Department, and
mail carriers shall at all times while en
gaged in the discharge of their respective
duties be permitted to ride free of charge
on all street railroads in this city.
1 upils of the public schools going to or
returning from schools within one-half
hour prior to the opening or subsequent to
l e , closing of the respective schools
shall be entitled to ride at the rate of 2^
cent for a single fare, provided that each
pupil shall have a card from the principal
oi the school certifying that the party is a
pupil of said school and reciting the resi
ilt-nce of the pupil and the location
c the school and the hours at which
paid school is opened and closed. Such
card with 2Â» 2 cents will entitle the holder
to a continuous ride from the residence
of the pupil to the school or the connec
tions nearest the school. The cards are to
be issued by the principal every three
months.
. A violation of the order is made puni
shable by a line of $100 or by imprison
ment in the County Jail for fifty days, or
both. The order, If adopted, is to go into
effect on Beptember 1 of this year.
The order was referred to the City and
County Attorney without debate
The order granting a franchise to the
Southern Pacific Company to make con
nections with existing lines was laid over
lor two weeks and rereferred.
The clerk was ordered to advertise for
proposals for lighting the streets in ac
cordance with the specifications of the
committee, all proposals to be in by Au
gust 1.
A resolution was ordered passed to print
adopting the recommendation of the su
perintendent of the police and fire alarm
telegraph system to lay the wires under
ground in the business districts, and
recommending- an appropriation for three
years;
A recommendation was adopted calling
for the use of salt water for sprinkling
the streets and flushing the sewers.
The proposition to utilize part of La
fayette Bquare for a site for the Lowell
High School was rereferred to the Board
of Education, with the request to con
sult the attorney of the board as to the "
legality of the proceeding.
The resolution to grade and sewer the
streets on Bernal Heights was laid over
for one week. Smith protesting that the
lots were but 25x70, assessed for only $>>
each and owned by poor people who
could not afford to pay $200 each to have
the work done. It would amount to con
fiscation, he added.
A motion was defeated to reconsider the
vote at the former meeting whereby the
Devany slot-machine order failed of
adoption. Clinton remarked that Devany
was one of the first to vote against the
poolroom order, and he was therefore ln
consistent in the matter of gambling.
Devany. replied by saying that the clos
ing of the Ingleside track had not done
any good for the cause of morality, be
cause people went over to the Oakland
track and bought pools there.
An ordinance by Sheehan was passed
to print prohibiting the renting or use of
any house on Berry place for immoral
purposes. Sheehan said that he had not
Included in the ordinance Dupont street
from Bush to California, or Bacon place!
off Pine street, between Kearny an<l Du
pont, because he bad been Informed that
the police had suppressed all disorderly :
houses on Dupont street and because
Bacon place had been closed in by gates
and was no longer an eyesore to passers
by.
The joint committee on Health and Po- '
lice, Hospital and Fire Department, re
ported that Scott & Magner were the i
lowest bidders for supplying the public '
Institutions with forage, consisting of
hay, straw, middlings, ground barley and
carrots; D. Keefe for white feed oats and
Peters & Cowle for hny. alfalfa and bran.
The contract price for hay was $19 50 per
ton. Dodge recommended that the con
tracts be let in accordance with the
recommendation of the joint committee. ;
The prices wore reasonable, considering
the fluctuations of the market. He had
been told by a contractor that he (the
contractor) had lost several thousand dol
lars on a contract because the price of
nrticles which he had to furnish had gone
up. Dodge added that he expected to see I
hay go up $10 or $12 a ton this year.
Smith wanted the hay bought in the
open market. He could buy all the hay
lie liked In the market at the present time
for $17 or $18 per ton.
The report was laid over for a week.
In tho matter of the rescinding of the
action of tho board in granting free per
mits to certain athletic clubs to give non
professional exhibitions of boxing, De-
Jany reserved his right to movo at the
next meeting for a reconsideration.
I.ackmann introduced a nlckol-in-tho
plot machine order, imposing license as
follows: Machines giving cigars, cigar
ettes, drinks or liquor, $3 per quarter for
each machine; phonographic, fortune
tPlllng, punching, lifting, music and elec
tric plot' machines, S2 per quarter; candy,
chocolate, postage stamps and other raer
chandise. $2.
On motion of Clinton representatives of
banking and other corporations were In
vlted to appear before the Board of
Equalization next Friday afternoon at 2
o'clock for the purpose of being examined
respecting the value of their property.
The board adjourned until Friday, July
. 15, at 2 p. m.

PACIFIC MAIL FORCES THE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC.
Freight Tariffs on Certain Commodi
ties Lessened by Both These
Companies for the Benefit
of the State.
The Pacific Mall Steamship Company
has forced the Southern Pacific to reduce
freight rates for certain staple commodi
ties. The new rates of the steamship line
for freight traffic from San Francisco to
New York have just become effective, and
show some important reductions. The fol
lowing reductions have been made by the
Pacific Mail steamship line, the first fig
ures being the rates fixed at the end of
February', the second the new rates:
Barley (in bags), 60c, 40c; beans (double
sacked), 60c,. 40c; bone black, 60c, 40c;
borax, 60c, 40c; brandy in cases (strapped),
80c, 75c; brandy in wood, 70c, 60c; fruit,

50c; rice, 60c, 40c; seed, mustard, 55c, 40c;
tallow, 60c, 40c; wine, in cases (strapped),
SOc, 75c; glue, 60c, 40c.
For wine in wood in lots less than 500
barrels the freight charge will be Csc;
more than 500 and less than 1000, 62% c; over
1000, 60c. All these rates are for hundred
weights.

from New York, Boston, Baltimore and
points common with each other to San
Francisco. The new class rates are: First,
$1 80; second, $1 50; third, $1 30; fourth,

50c; canned salmon, 50c; rags, 60c; wool,
40c; rubber junks, 60c; quicksilver, 75c;

MISSION ROAD NEGLECTED.
School Accommodation and Other Im
provements Are Needed There.
What !s known as the Mission Road
and Five Mile House, but now Mission
street proper, Is on the list asking for
| Improvements out of the next tax levy.
The first and most Important addition
I needed by the people residing on the line
I of Mission street west of Islais Creek is
i a twelve-class schoolhouse fully equipped
jto make It a grammar school. The only
i school accommodation is afforded by the
Monroe Primary, with poor facilities for
seven classes.
The building was moved from Army
street, near Folsom. twelve years ago,
and Is rotten and unfit for use. It has
I none of the modern improvements, and
Is unsanitary in the highest degree, yet,
i notwithstanding the thousands of do.lars
â  spent by Director Burns, this building
I has been shamefully neglected. In addi-
I tion to its unhealthy condition, it is too
i small to accommodate one-half of the
' children of school age in this section of
! th city, and as a result two cowsheds
have been rented by the board as addi-
I tional class rooms. These are under the
| control of one principal, who must wade
her way through mud and slush in the
winter season to and from tho school.
i The people there will request the erection
j of a grammar school. This they consider
I they are entitled to, as the population ig
i sufficiently numerous to justify it. The
! nearest grammar school is the Horace
Mann, on Valencia and Twenty-third
streets. Following the school ' building,
the citizens in this district have come to
the conclusion that they are entitled to
street lights and water.
CAFE SPRECKELS. 15th floor. Call building,
has changed hands; now under management of
Mr. Albert Wolff, formerly proprietor of Malson
de I' Opera, Oakland. Regular lunch, with
wine, 75c; dinner, with wine, $1.
Selling Immature Veal.
F. P. Blie, butcher, 1236 Stockton stree,
was arrested yesterday afternoon by Po
liceman Butterworth and Health Inspect
or Brennan for ouerlng for sale immature
veal. The veal was seized by the officers.
The Hardtmuth lead pencil is the best in
the world. Try the Koh-I-Noor. â¢
A Chinese Perjurer.
Lee Ho, a laundryman, came from
Berkeley yesterday to testify for the de
fense in the case of Leong Sing, charged
with stealing a gold watch from Mrs. H.
E. Pike, 904 Powell street. He swore that
the defendant had worked steadily for the
past six months in a laundry in Berkeley
and had not been across the bay during
that time. Mrs. Pike was sure that the
right man was charged, and Detectives
Gibson and Wren testified that the de
fendant had to their knowledge been sell
ing lottery tickets in the city for the past
three months. The Judge at once or
dered Lee Ho into custody on a charge of
perjury.
WELBUBN'S BONDSMEN SUED.
Action Brought to Recover Money
Alleged to Have Been
Stolen.
A suit was filed yesterday in the United
States Circuit Court against Stanley Wil
ley and Edward Henry Farmer, bondsmen
of Osca M. Welburn, former Internal Rev
enue Collector, who is now a fugitive from
Justice
The parties named In the complaint were
on Welburn's bond as disbursing agent,
and it is alleged that he received the sum
of $1".,463 89 as salaries for persons who
never received them and office expenses
which were never incurred, and that he
sent in vouchers for the same and con
verted the money to his own use. The
action was brought by Assistant United
States Attorney Bert Schlesinger, under
the direction of the Solicitor of the Treas
ury. There is already a suit for $35,000
pending in the courts against the bonds
men of Welburn.
What Must Be Stamped.
Another batch of treasury decisions
was received at the local Internal Reve
nue Office yesterday, the most important
among which were that stamp tax must
be paid on checks drawn by the officer of
a company for the payment of workmen
ar.d that brokers must pay a special tax
in each city where they do business.
Poisons are not taxable and baking pow
ders and shoe dressing are also exempt.
Soaps without wrappers or directions are
not taxable, but if a medicinal or cos
metic value is claimed for them they are
subject to taxation. Proprietary food
preparations are free from taxation.
Collector Lynch is now ready to receive
brokers' tax and issue stamps for the
same. The total receipts yesterday was
$33,460, of which about $28,000 was for
stamps and the balance bonds.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 11.â To-day's stock mar
ket was not remarkable for breadth. In fact
the list as a whole showed little activity and
very little movement. There was a distinct
tendency to heaviness in parts of the list,
which might early have been pronounced but
for the sustaining strength in special stocks.
The dullnrss was the outcome of the uncer
tainty natural on the eve of an important
military operation. Great confidence Is felt in
the early occupation of Bantiagi . hut the halt
in speculation Is significant of th<- desire for
accomplished facts rather than probabilities.
The effect of the resumption of hostilities and
the abandonment of peace talk had a greater
Influence on the minds of foreign speculators
than it had even in Wall street. London sold
Stocks here all day. and the reaction in Span
ish 4s in I'aris. where the most accurate knowl
edge of Spanish governmental affairs Is likely
to he reflected, was even more significant. The
later recovery In I'aris in Spanish 4s was prob
ably associated with the conference between the
President and the French Embassador at
Washington. But the New York stock market
â was redeemed from dullness and perhaps from
positive weakness by the character of the buy
ing of special stocks and railroad bonds. The
Strength in th* early market was largely con
fined to the Vanderbllts. and the Interest in
had become specialised to Illinois Central
and Hawaii. Omaha reacted sharply before
the dose and New York ('pntrai was distinctly
heavy in tone. Early in the day the Atchison
adjustment bonds showed conspicuous strength,
as did also the Denver and Gulf firsts. This
was attributed to foreign account, even while
London was selling storks. Net changes gen
erally are small and mixed between gains and
losses.
There was active demand for some of the
speculative bonds at higher prices. Total sales,
*5. 235. 000.
United States 5s coupon were % lower and
United States 5s registered >4 lower bid price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 11.â Lower Liverpool cables,
better eroj. news and fine weather started
wheat easy. More radical weakness quickly
developed, however, when It became known
that St. Louis receipts of new wheat were 76,
000 bushels and the weather In the Danublan
provinces was fine and settled after heavy rains
reported from there Saturday. The opening de
cline wae partly recovered later on buying
against puts and the expected heavy decrease
in the visible supply. The fact that the Gov
ernment crop report was expected In the after
noon kept the trade In a waiting mood, as few
cared to enter into new obligations pending
the arrival of information which might change I
the whole situation. The world's shipments to
Europe were 6.051. 0<J0 bushels last week, against
1,796,000 busbeta the similar week of 1897. The
quantity on ocean passage decreased 3,200,000
bushels. July closed l'ic lower and Septem
ber lost VÂ»c.
Scattered liquidation on more favorable crop ]
reports and the decline in wheat weakened
corn. July cloyed 'ie down.
Sympathy with wheat and corn was respon
sible for a decline in oats. July declined 'v.
Suggestions of an Improved foreign demand
for provisions offset the effect of an ovrrrun
of hoes, lower prices at the yards and a
smaller cash business. There was a Bharp
rally early on liberal buying by packers. ThÂ»
advance was lost later, however, on general
selling by commission nouses. Pork and ribs

Probably Will Be Paid
Without Protest.
ASSESSMENT WAR BEGINS
EX - SUPERVISOR PELOUZE IS
GRANTED A REDUCTION.
Water Companies, Railroads and
Other Corporations Have Not
Yet Filed Their Annual
Protests.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
; , July 11.
The annual war over the county assess
ment roll commenced this morning, and
for the :â â¢: â â¢ jcl two weeks and longer if the
State b irii' agreeablo the Supervisors
jll hold daily sessions until all petitions,
whether for reductions or raises, are
passed upon.
The rolls contain that section of tho
water front awarded to the Water Front
Company by the Supreme Court. There
Is some doubt as to whether this property,
valued at $600,000, should be on the roll or
not, as the decision of the Supreme Court
in the matter was not final. The case was
Bent back to the Alameda courts to be
retried and for judgment to be rendered
along certain lines. The situation is be
ing watched with great interest, for there
Is some doubt as to whether the Water
Front Ccnr.pany will object to the assess
ment or pay its taxes.
For nearly a year, or since the ren
dering of the opinion by the Supreme
Court, the" aeent for the Water Front
Company In this city has been trying to
negotiate the sale of some of its prop
erty, and has gone so far as to promise
a guarantee to prospective purchasers
that they shall be forever protected in
their title. This information has come to
the knowledge of the Assessor, and he
will use it as an argument against the
company should it object to the assess
ment.
There Is another point in connection
with the water front that is also being
brought forward. During the time of
office of ex-Assessor Leckle, the water
front was placed on the roll at a low
figure and the company paid its taxes
regularly. The payment of taxes for
many years was one of, the prominent ar
guments used by the wat( Front Com
pany during the trial of the great suit.
When Assessor Dalton took office in 1894,
he took the assessment off the roll on
the ground that the property belonged to
the city. For three years the property
was not assessed and there is some talk
aa to whether Mr. Dalton was justified
in taking it off the rolls, and If he be
not personally responsible for the three
years' taxes that nave been lost to the
county. Mr. Dalton declares he is will
ing to combat this position, and pays ho
haa no fear regarding the legality of all
be has done."
The first applicant for a reduction of
sment at to-day's session was ex-
Supervisor W. S. Pelouze. After mak
ing his plaini his property was reduced
from $750 to $500. Another reduction thai
he asked was not granted. One or two
smaller reductions were asked, but no ap
plications from the Southern Pacific, the
street railroad companies or any of the
larger corporations that annually create
much trouble have yet been tiled,
Another interesting light Is expected
o\er the assessments of the water com
panles. When fixing the rates last Feb
ruary, the two companies gave much data
trains the values of their plants. Thfs
data showed that the joint value, accord
ing-to the company's figures, approaches
$11,000,000. Owing to the â â â¢ ssment be
ing placed in the different townships and
cities, it is difficult to arrive at the total
assessment, but as the Assessor has been
guided by the sworn statements of the
companies there will probably be a warm
contest.
RETURNS FROM THE EAST.
President W. D. Heitman of the City
Council Tells of ihe Omaha
Exposition.
OAKLAND, July 11.â W. D. Ileltman,
president of the City Council, who has
visiting his father in Omaha, re
turned to-day. He was greatly pleased
with the evidences nf energy-, thrift, en
terprise ,- 1 n < j good tini'-s he saw on every
In Bpeaking of Omaha, the city
of his birth,' Mr. Heitman said:
They have made more progress in the past
few years than have those of any of the Middle
West cities. rever they have gone as dele
gates to ntions lately they have en
deavored to bring the succeeding National
gathering to Omaha. In this they have almost
<>ut-Chicasoed Chicago. Omaha, this year, I
believe, will have as .any large National con
ventions as Chicago. That will advertise the
place and bring thousands of dollars to many
lines of business.
As regards the Inter-State Exposition it must
be seen to be appreciated. It 1b really the Chi
cago World's Fair in miniature. There have
been few like It outside of Chicago. It is one
of the greatest shows ever nit up. They have
built a lake there about 1000 feet In length
and stocked It with gondolas. The buildings
are erected on either side. They are all white
and extremely beautiful. At night the place
Is lighted up with myriads of 'â â â¢â¢â  trie lights,
and the effect cannot be described. It la
really dazslinÃ In its brilliancy, and seems
more like a fairyland than It does the work of
human being?.
The Government exhibit Is a great feature.
It contains models of all the great war ves
sels of this country and a number of other
features which are very interesting.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
TAKEN FROM
THE MOTHER
Neither Side Won in the
Hurt Contest.
A GUARDIAN IS APPOINTED
JOEL J. HURT REVILES HIS
EX-WIFE'S HUSBAND.
Judge Ogden Says the Case Is the
Most Difficult He Has Ever
Been Required to
Decide.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 11.
The contest over the children of Joel
J. Hurt of "Wyoming ended this after
noon. Neither the father nor mother can
claim a victory, although the honors are
probably with the father, inasmuch as
the children have been legally taken from
their mother and placed in charge of a
guardian.
This morning Hurt took the witness
stand for tho first time and told of his
experiences. He testified that at one I
! time he was worth $000,000, but he does !
| not believe he Is worth a quarter of that j
: just now. While giving hie testimony he
; frequently referred to his ex-wlfe's hus
i band. Alphonse Schaeffer. as "this thing"
and "that thing" and "such a thing." He
' gave vent to his inmost feelings when he j
said: "It would be the greatest pleasure |
of my life to bring this mother and her |
! children together in my own household, j
but 1 could never do it while she asaoci- j
; ates with this horse thief." Hurt also
stated that in every letter he sent his lit
tle girl he placed $5 and a tinhorn gam
bler (Schaeffer) stole it. "The Sheriff of
Cheyenne County," said Hurt, "told me
i that Sehaeffer took the alimony that I
paw my wife before she was married and
; gambled it off. He also receipted for the
I alimony at the bank. All this loafer
j wants Is the alimony from his wife."
Mry. Carrie Mentell of San Leandro,
' who has known Mrs. Schaeffer for four I
j weeks, created quite a sensation by her |
eloquent defense of women in general and I
Mrs. Schaeffer In particular. She told
the court that all the procedure being !
; held was highly improper and assured '
: Judge Ogden that if he knew Mrs. '
I Schaeffer as well as she did he would
Bhare her (the witness) opinion. Mrs.
I Mentell, when asked to confine herself
jto matters before the court, said the
Judge had bitter excuse her because the !
attorneys objected to her testimony and ,
she was so "riled" that she could not do ;
any better.
Josie Hurt, the eldest of the three girls,
told the story of how carefully her
mother cared for the children and of how
her father had tried to make them be
lieve her mother was a bad woman. She !
said that her father had told her he j
1 would kill Schaeffer if he ever came
across him. Alice Hurt was put on tho
stand, but when she tried to speak and !
realized that she might be taken from ;
j her mother the little girl could do noth-
Ing bin cry. r>nd was excused.
Mrs. liirchlnell, a neighbor of the !
Schaeffen at San Leandro, created some j
amusement by stating that even the cats
j followed Mr. Sc-haeftVr around the yard, j
) and when kittens were in his way ho was
â¢ too kind to even Step on them, but drove
them out ot His path. Several other wit
b testified to Mrs. Schaeffer's char
acter.
In rendering his decision. Judge Ogden
Btated that he had never felt the weight
jponsibllity more than In the case at
liar. He briefly recited the family history
from the time of the divorce to the prfts
. ont. He referred to the fact that the i
I father was able to give the children groat j
i advantages and also that they needed a j
mother's care.
"The court see.Â« great difficulty in this
case," said Judge Ogden. "The benefits
j of the father's wealth, rightly applk-<l. are
great. If the mother be a moral woman |
! it is absolutely necessary for the growth j
I of the, children's' character that sho. attend !
Ito their development. I dread to take the |
> responsibility of saying that the children
I shall not reap the benefit which the
father's wealth may bring, and. on the
other hand, I cannot take them from the
mother and give them to the father where
he can have exclusive power outside the
control of this court. The second hus
band's crime- is not to be considered, for
he was pardoned and restored to full cit
izenship. Whatever may be said of
marrying a man of this character, this
court will encourage the two to remain
together and to hold fast to the espousal
sanctioned at the altar. If this mother
would consent to some fit and proper per
son who should be so deemed by the
court, being appointed guardian of her
children, who should have their custody, ;
allowing such access to them on the part j
of the mother and father as such guardian
' should consider fit, then this court would
recommend such a course."
Judge Ogden suggested that Mrs. S. C.
Ranford be appointed the guardian, and
i hinted that if such an agreement be not
. tered into by trreir mother the children
should bo sent at once to their father and
there receive such benefits as he could j
give them.
This solution of the difficulty was ac
ceptable to Mrs. Hurt, and when the :
ary papers were drawn up the chil
dren became the legal wards of Mrs. San- :
ford, and the groat struggle for the chil
dren, which had lasted two years, was
ended.
SUPERVISORS DECLINE
THE RAILROAD'S OFFER
WILL NOT ACCEPT THE USE OF
ALICE STREET BRIDGE.
Traffic Will Be Seriously Disturbed
While the New Bridge Is Build
ing at Webster Street-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 11.
The Southern Pacific Company sent a
â communication to the Supervisors to-day
I offering to the bounty the use of the
Alice-street bridge as a means of com
munication between Oakland and A!a
meda until such time, as the new county
bridg" shall be built at Webster street.
The Supervisor* refused the offer.
The railroad company has almost com
pleted Its arrangements for transferring
the Alice-street steam travel and the
Webster-street steam travel from these
two bridges to its new bridge at Harri
son street; Under the old system, the
railroad -used a large part of the county
bridK" It Webster street and had a bridge
of Us own at Alice street. Their liarrison-
Btreet bridge, which Is now being llnlshed,
will accommodate all their travel, and
they must within a certain time entirely
remove the discarded Alice-street struc
ture. The communication from Chief En
gineer Curtis to the Supervisors states
that after the tracks are taken from the
Alice-street bridge, and while the old
Webster-street bridge Is being pulled
down and the new one built, the public
could use the discarded bridge if the
1 Supervisors desired.
It was learned thut in order to make the
Alice-street bridge lit for teaming after
the tracks were torn up, about J2OOO would
have to be spent, and consequently the
otter was declined by the votes of Roeth
j Talcott and Wells. Messrs. Church and
Mitchell favored the acceptance of the
offer, stating that it would be a great con
venience to both towns while the new
bridge is In course of construction
Nothing is known at present of the
future or Webster-street bridge. Ail tho
plÃns. petitions and protests have been
forwarded to the War Department and
as Secretary Alger la supposed to bo very
busy at this time, Alameda County's
bridge Is not likely to be considered as an
I urgent necessity. The bridge should have
: been completed a month ago, but with
j the exception of preparing plans and let-
Iting the contracts nothing has been done

H. G. Rudolph Robbed Theodore Geir
OAKLAND, July 11.â Officer Jack Scan
lan arrested Henry G. Rudolph, a printer,
at Seventh and Webster streets to-day on
a charge of burglary. He was accused
ot the iheft of a' sack of coin containing
$76 from Theodore Gier's store a few
days ago. When faced by Detectives Hol
land and Quigley, he admitted the charge
und returned the sack and $5 30. Rudolph
was familiar with Gier's place of busi
ness, and often hung around there. The
police were satislied that the crime was
committed by some one who knew the
place. To the officers Rudolph stated that
he had seen the sack hid, and becoming
tired of living on 5-cent meals, he could
not resist the temptation of taking it and
living high. He lived in" luxury for three
or four days, when he took too much
liquor and a friend relieved him of $40.
Pie will appear In the Police Court in tho
morning.
Anton e Smith Accused of Robbery.
OAKLAND. July 11.â Jacob Weil, the
free market butcher who has been in the
Police Court numerous times for violating
the city ordinances, to-day told Captain
Fletcher of the police force a tale of al
leged robbery lo which he was subjected
yesterday. He asserts that he went out
in the vicinity of the Fish Ranch yester
day to purchase some calves. He declares
that when he reached the ranch he was
dragged into a barn by Antone Smith
and compelled to give up $100 he had in his
pocket, under threats of arrest. He ad
mits that he has had trouble with Smith,
but denies that he owes him money. Aa
the affair occurred in Contra Costa Coun
ty, Captain Wilson advised him to apply
for a warrant for the man's arrest In Mar
tinez. It is possible that Smith will tell
another story when his side is heard.

struction of tho. court, and you will havo
the will here at that time," replied tha
court as he turned to the next case.
The Hawaiian Commission.
When the Hawaiian Commission arrives
in this city the members are likely to be
the guests of the Chamber of Commerce
for a day at least. Yesterday Hugh Craig,
the President, sent the following to Sen
ator Cullom of Illinois: "The Chamber of
Commerco desires to tender a public re
ception to you and the members of the
Hawaiian Commission upon your arrival
here. Kindly inform us of your move
ments."
The reception will probably he of an in
formal nature, and Mr. Craig wishes as
many of the public as can attend to be
at the rooms of the chamber upon that
occasion. It is believed that the commis
sion will leave Washington about August
1, and it will not complete its mission
until October.
LEGISLATES
FOR LIQUOR
Henneberry Objects to
Cigarettes.
BERKELEY CITED AS EXAMPLE
OAKLAND COUNCIL WOULD RE
DUCE SALOON LICENSES.
Says the War Tax Is a Burden on j
Everything They Sell and
They Should Be
Relieved.
OAKLAND, July 11.â There were two
little surprises at the meeting of the City
Council to-night. Councilman Henne
berry submitted an ordinance providing
for the suppression of the sale dt cigar
ettes. Tho ordinance says:
It Is hereby declared unlawful for any per
i Bon in the city of Oakland to sell, offer for sale
j or Rive away any cigarette or cigarettes.
No person shaJl permit any cigarettes to be
; Fold in any place owned, leased or occupied
by him.
It is hereby declared unlawful for any minor
to smoke any cigarette In any railway car,
Btreet, square, public building or place in the
city of Oakland.
The ordinance is to take effect. If passed,
on and after October 1. It was referred
to the ordinance committee.
Councilman Hcnneberry's second surprise
was an ordinance providing for the reduc
j tion of the liquor license from $100 to $50
; a quarter, in explanation of his ordin
ance, Mr. Henneberry said: "The war tajc
; has laid a heavy burden on liquor dealers.
It has required them to pay taxes on
I everything they sell, and it is but equita
ble that they should be shown some con
sideration. Just across the line, in Berke
ley, the, license has been reduced to $50 per
quarter, and it Is but right, In my opinion,
that we should do the same."
The ordinance went to the committee.
The Council appropriated $75 to-night to
pay for a national flag for the Eighth
i Regiment at Camp Barrett.
The new Davie Freight Ferry Company
i applied to the Council to construct a
â  freight shod at Franklin,-Btreet wharf.
The protest of property owners against
j the remaeadamlzing of Webster street
was sustained.
The annual report of thÂ« Free Library
was presented to the Council. It concludes:
: "In reeard to the needs of the library
thrre is one that is ever present and ln
; sistent, and we can but reiterate the state
. merit made last year that the library has
| almost reached the limit of its usefulness
! till a more suitable building is provided.
The present building, erected thirty years
fitro, did well enough for the Oakland of
1868, but Is hardly consonant with the dig
nity of the greater Oakland of 1598."
Next Friday night the Council will meet
as a committee of the whole to take up
j the matter of Cemetery Creek.
DEMING SURPRISES A
PHILADELPHIA CROWD
AN OAKLAND CRANK COMMANDS
THE ATTENTION OF ALL.
Tells of His Peculiar Mission, Which
Is to Advocate a Complete
Anglo-Saxon Alliance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, July 11.
Arthur Buel Deming of this city has
just created a sensation In Philadelphia.
On the 4th of July, at the conclusion of
Senator Edmunds' speech at Independ
ence Hall, a patriarchal man of com
manding presence arose from tho front
row, and. with a gesture, bade the audi
ence listen to him.
The chairman and others who had
fought in the second war with. Great
33ritain were too much surprised to re
monstrate. "Sons of the Revolution,"
said Deming, "I have come all the way
from California to speak to you. My mis
sion is to proclaim the alliance of the
Anglo-Saxon races. That alliance is sure
to come. My mission is to promote and
perfect the amity of our race in the bonds
of peace. Such an alliance is absolutely
necessary for business, society and re
ligion."
After he had left the platform and been
cheered by the audience, the speaker said
he was A. B. Deming of Oakland, Cal.
He said to a reporter: "A mnn is greatly
impressed by his waking thoughts. I was
awakened at 4 o'clock on December 20,
ISO 7, by the Idea of an Anglo-American
race. I formulated a proclamation and
mailed a copy of It to Queen Victoria. She
got it, I know, and Chamberlain's recent
speech was the result. I suggested to
Victoria that she should get herself car
tooned, and if you notice lately, her pict
ure has been appearing with that of Un
cle Sam, their arms entwined about each
other. Yes, Victoria is running the end
over there and I am struggling- along the
best I can with this end of the business.
But it will succeed."
A. B. Deming is well known In Oak
lani as an earnest religionist. He is the
inventor of a peculiar preparation of
charcoal for rheumatism, and has been
a f.-imiliar figure for years. He is*an in
telligent, well-educated man of good ad
dress.
Sergeant Hughes Weds Miss Miller.
OAKLAND, July VLâ Sergeant Thomas
B. Hutches of the Fourth Cavalry, sta
tioned at the Presidio. San Francisco,
called at the County Clerk's office to
night and secured a license to wed Miss
Rosalna Kdna Miller. She accompanied
him, and they immediately repaired to
Justice Cliffs court, where they were
married. He Is a native of Florida, aged
31, while the bride was born In this State
twenty-eight years ago. Both are resi
dents of San Francisco.
Private Alexander Goodman of the
First Montana â  Infantry, now at Camp
Merritt, and Miss Alice Wilcox were unit
ed in matrimony ttt the same time. They
had intended being married yesterday af
ternoon by Rev. It. Ritchie, but the cere
mony was postponed until to-day. An
other soldier, a private, when he saw the
two married, wanted Judge Clift to per
form the ceremony for him, but having
failed to secure a license, the Judge had
to refuse. The six then went away to
gether.
THE WOODBBIDGE CANAL.
A Higher Bid for the Property by
the Receiver, E. C. Chapman.
The sale for $11,000 of the Woodbridge
canal property, Which has been the sub
ject of so much litigation lately, came up
before Judge Morrow yesterday morning
for affirmation. \V. C. Chapman, receiver
of the property, through his counsel.
Judge Fox, made a conditional bid of
$23,000, with the understanding that the
property be sold to him subject to all
costs incurred by the receiver, which
amount to $35,000.
The contention was made by parties rep
resented by Attorney Cannon that their
claims, amounting to about $5000, be de
creed by the court to be preferred over
the bonded indebtedness, as they repre
sented money owed by the defendant cor
poration. The whole matter was referred
back to Commissioner Heacock, who will
hear It next Monday at 11 o'clock.
A Trick of Peddlers.
J. L. Aiken, 1188 Noe street, swore to a
complaint In Judge Mogan's court yester
day for the arrest of Nick Wyley and
"John Doe" Lyons, peddlers, on a charge
of petty larceny. He alleged that his
wife, last Tuesday purchased 85 cents'
worth of articles from Wyley and Lyons
and gave them a $5 gold piece to get
changed. They forgot to return with the
change. The police say that similar com
plaints have been made by other people.
MAMIE GRIFFIN'S
GREAT MILE
Lowers Oakland's Track
Record to 2:12.
MABEN SPRINGS A SURPRISE
GREEN PACER LOLITA STEPS
THREE CLIPPING HEATS.
President Knight's Mare Silver
Queen Easily Defeats the Soft-
Hearted Favor â Turf
Notes.
The racing at Oakland yesterday was
gilt-edged and during the afternoon Jim
my Sullivan made a little turf history
with Colonel Henshaw's beautiful black
mare, Mamie Griffin, by lowering all
trotting records over the course to 2:12.
Mamie can surely touch 2:10, and her mile
was a splendid one and entirely within
hers-lf. Every one regretted the absence
of the genial sportsman who owns her,
for he would have received an ovation
most surely.
To beat Toggles and Clay S, two sup
posedly formidable opponents, was in
deed a performance "Oregon Jimmy" can
view with eminent satisfaction. Then,
too, the rating was to perfection. The
quarter 33 secondsâ just a 2:12 gaitâ half
in 1:06^4, at the three-quarters it was
1:39V4, and the last quarter In 32Va seconds,
a 2:10 clip, showing that the contest was
not a hollow one. Mamie's old record
was 2:12%. In the books she was 2 to 1
and Toggles, her chief competitor, a 1 to
2 shot.
Still another surprise was the defeat
of Resort by the green mare Lolita, by
Sidney, from Walter Maben's stable, and
driven by Brooks. The mare never saw
a crowd till yesterday, cost her owner
Just $35 at auction and In her Initial heat
was close second in 2:16. coming from the
rear brigade at the half-mile ground.
She went her mile, too, with a tire
"down." Resort was all out and seemed
about done, while the black mare was
fresh as a daisy. Early betting favored
Resort, but Lolita was 4 to B for the sec
ond heat; Resort at ovens.
'ihe story is soon told, as Lolita, with
out a skip, closed it out in 2:17, 2:ISVj,
Gaff Topsail and Harry Ramon being the
chief contenders. Resort quit like a dog
in the stretch. The. Los Angeles contin
gent played Lolita for quite a nice win
i ning, she having stepped work-outs hand
! ily in 2:l7>>. and being exceedingly level
i headed. Gaff Topstai] went a grand race,
and in the, hopples races far steadier than
otherwise. He is a four-year-old and with
age will be quite a pacer.
Silver Queen went an honest mile in
2:21, trotting from nowhere and beating
Favor where they pay off. She can beat
! 2:20 her next race, sure. President Knight
took a day off, so did not see her splen
did performance. She and Favor were at
even money, and all there were of any
account in it, *a Lottie easily outfinished
Mr-nlo Belle for show money.
Hijo del Diablo handily disposed of the
special for named pacers, in 2:16, away
be..md his recordâ 2:llVi. F W got the
place over Delphi. Rex Alto was not on
his good behavior, and finished last, in
the dust. Hljo del Diablo and F "W were
each held at 6 to 5 by the pencil wfc . !
era, Rex at 2 and Delphi 10â he might as
well have been at 100, for he cannot class
with any of the others at present. They
stepped away at a 2:10 clip, but the last
quarter was only :36, showing how easy
It waa for NelsotfH big horse.
Sullivan won the 2:17 trot with Colonel
Henshaw't handsome bay gelding <uir
Jiick in -:17',. trotting a very pretty mile.
Hi- was favorite at 1 to 2 over the field â
May B, Bilver Ring find Myrtle Thorne.
The latter went a grand heat and linished
dose up. Our Jack stepped away to the
half in l:o7'j. He was backed heavily, as
it looked a sure victory for him over that
field. In the auctions rr was Jack 5, field
3, and the most of the betting went that
way.
To-day's card promises grand sport, and
some surprises will doubtless be enacted.
.Among the starters are some new to the
game, which have been stepping the track
in Grand Circuit style of late. The book
makers lost considerable money, as at the
quotations the favorites are played hard,
but then their day always comes, and to
day's winners look to be uncertain and the
"wise" money is very apt to get a tum
ble. The starting is the best ever wit
nessed in California, and patrons are cer
tain to make the 5:30 boat yet see a great
deal of racing.
It should be remembered that ladies are
cordially Invited to become the guests of
the association and will enjoy the enliven
ing scenes beyond a doubt.

Anna Taylor's Will.
The Supreme Court has upheld the de
cision of the lower court in the contested
will case of Anna Taylor. The action and
appeal were hot based upon the usual
grounds of fraud or that the deceased was
of unsound mind and did not comprehend
what she did when making the will, but
that the execution of the will was not
sufficiently proved. The document was
made over twelve years ago, and one of
the witnesses, named Heard, only remem
bered that he was present when the sev
eral signatures were affixed, many
of the incidents having slipped from his
mind. The higher court decided that the
failure of one witness to remember all
that took place on a certain occasion was
not sufficient to invalidate the will.

GOOD PLAYS
PRESENTED
"Faust" at the Alcazar a
Big Success.
"ROMANY RYE" MAKES A HIT
i
A LAUGHABLE COMEDY AT' THE
COLUMBIA.
"Lostâ 24 Hours" Is Bright and
Funny â More Star Acts
Given at the
Orpheum.
The Frawley company presented a Jol
ly and entertaining comedy drama at the
Columbia last nightâ one that will not
only make many friends for those in the
cist, but should bring satisfactory re
turns to the box office. The dialogue is
bright, on the up-to-dato order, the sit
uations comical and these features, com
bined with good acting, constitute a rich
producer of good, wholesome, hearty
laughter. This being the mission of
"Lostâ Twenty-four Hours," the fact that
the plot is not new does not matter. The
familiar subject of the troubles of a
young married man who takes advantage
of the absence of his wife to get dread
fully drunk and lose a day by over-sleep
ing is handled in such a clever and origi
nal manner as to make it decidedly ac
ceptable. The lirst two acts are solid
fun and there is no wasted time In the
matter of promoting hilarity in the au
dience. The last act drugged somewhat
last night, but will be all right with a lit
tle more adjustment and rapidity of ac
tion. The plot of the play was given in
these columns on Sunday. The trouble
In the story all arises from the acquisi
tion of that remarkable condition of in
ebriety, the Incidents following In a
natural manner.
The part of Dick Swift, the husband,
who is one of the most gifted liars on
earth, is played by Edward Hell, and it is
by far the best thing he has done since
the opening of the Beason. He is to De
congratulated on his success, for the char
acter was as carefully and correctly
drawn as could well be done, for he cer
tainly brings out all the fun there is in
the Tines and situations. His work laÂ«

tixnation of the patrons of the Columbia

The curtain-raiser. "The Littlest Girl,"
1? a pathetic short sketch, glv^n as a rel
ish for the comedy that follows. It Is from
R'.ehard Hnrdlng Davis* Van Bibber
Stories, the two principal speaking parts
being taken by T. Daniel Frawley as Van
Bibber and Theodore Roberts as Caruth
ers. The character fits Mr. Frawley com
fortably and thi> desired sympathies of the.
audience are gained, but Mr. Roberts
could greatly improve on the finale, when
he acknowledges his discarded child, by
displacing some emotion, as a father
should in such a situation.
The play g â âºâ¢s for thÂ« week and ought to
hfive a successful run.
At the Alcazar.
Seldom, If ever, has such a wildly en
thusiastic audience assembled within the
walls of the Alcazar as the one lnst
night. Lewis Morrison, during his mag
nificent Impersonation of his Satanic Ma
jesty in Goethe's masterpiece of "Faust,"
met not with one ovation but a series
of them, and at the close of each act
he was several times called before thw
curtain. His conception of the part has
lost none of its villrity or brilliancy, but
if such a thing were possible time haÂ»
improved it. Florence Roberts was ;in
Ideal Marguerite and shar^'l with hei
husband the honors of the evening. At
the close of the second act she was pre
sented with a beautiful bouquet of mar
guerites. In the death scene she was
simply superb. Frank Denithorno was
disappointing as Faust. He seemed all
through to be conscious of the fact that
he was overweighted in the part, which
marred his performance. In the garden
scene he was too tragic for a lover, anrt
in other scenes he was lacking in natur
alness. He has certain mannerisms that
he should study to get rid of. George
Foster Platt gave a clever Interpretation
of Valentine. ;md Mrs. F. M. Putts waÂ»
in her element as Martha. The other parts
were well sustained. The piece is well
mounted.
Grand Opera-House.
After an absenco of several years, "The
Romany Rye" has made its reappearance
at Moroscos Grand Opera-houHe. The.
cast Is strong, and for the linn night the
members held to their parts with remark
able smoothness. Janus M. Brophy. as
the Romany Rye, performed his part well,
and won the applause of the audience.'
The leading lady was Miss Maud Edna.
I lull, in the character of Gertie lleckett,
which she sustained with ease and tact'
Julia Wane played a double part Miss
Adrlen and that of Mother Shipton and
in the latter a more vicious old hag 'could
not be found in seven counties. She came
in for much applause in the cellar scene.
The audience w.u* not aware how near
its evening's amusement came to being
spoiled. Landers Stevens took the part of
Philip Royston, the gentleman villain and
so hard did he work to fullill this char
acter that at the end of the third act he
foil in a faint from heart trouble induced
by overexertlon. It was with difficulty
that he whs revived sufficiently to go on
when the curtain went up again. No one
observed that there was anything wrong
but the effort to carry out the character
during the most trying scenes at the con
clusion was a terrible strain upon him
but he succeeded.
The scenery la all new. and several
splendid effects were brought out The
scene of the gypsy camp is a living pic
ture. The moonlight scene on the Thames,
â¢with London in the distance. Is equally
meritorious. Probably the most striking
scene is that of the shipwreck, in which
the entire space of the big stage is util
ized. It is grand and well worth seeing,
as is the entire production. "Captain
Impudence" comes on next week.
The Tivoli.
Yon Suppe's ever-popular and tuneful
opera, "Futlnitza," was presented at thÂ»
Tivoli last evening, after an Interval of
nearly three years, and was much enjoyed
by the large audience which listened to
the familiar and catchy music. With new
scenery, new costumes and new faces, the
revival of the opera was a brilliant one.
The sweet voice of Elvla Crox Seubrooke
was heard to advantage in the role of
Lieutenant Vladimir Samailoff, the maa
querading and prankish young officer.
The clever and vivacious singer played
the part with vim and a proper Interpre
tation, winning much applause. Miss
Helen Merrill shows constant improve
ment. As the romantic and beautiful
PrlncesÃ Lydia she adapted herself to the
part. Her singing of the duet with Miss
Seabrooko in the harem scene was ex
ecuted with taste and feeling.
Edwin Stevens seems to adapt himself
to a difmifled role with as much ease as
he would a comic one. Although the part
of General Kantchukoff demands gruff
ness and an Imperious bearing, the pop
ular comedian cannot resist showing his
humor, and he frequently causes laughter.
Branson is In his element as the New
York Herald correspondent. He acts the
role 'to perfection, and his methods of
getting news are ludicrous in the extreme-.
Although West, as the reformed Pu-sha,
has not much to do. what ho does is done
with neatness and ease. Harney Reynolds'
delineation of SttMpann, the old corporal,
created much laughter. The othe.r roles
are in good hands, and, all in all. the
opera is well rendered. Judging by last
night's audience and the appreciation
shown by it, the Tivoli should be well
filled during the remainder of the week.
At the Orpheum.
One of the very best all-round bills ever j
seen at the Orpheum Is on this week, j
There is more legitimate comedy than has j
been seen in that house on any bill be- I
fore. The one-act farce by Bert Coot and
Julie Kingsley and their support is a
clever comedy conceit, cleverly acted, j
well staged and bubbling over with fun
and humor. Bert Coot as tho young man j
whose chief characteristic is an aching ,
void where his brains ought to be, had a
part which he has ever made a success
of. He seems to catch the Idiosyncrasies
of the man who Is always laughing when .
he ought to mourn, and who cries when >
he ought to be mirthful, and he presents i
| them without overdoing. Miss Kingsley i
| as the woman who wants to win back her
estranged husband, and. falling, has it
out on 11 .Mr. Timid." clearly demonstrated I
her schooling in the legitimate. She makes
the most of even small things, which itÂ» |
other hands would fall flat. Jules Kusel ,
and Kate Peal furnish good support to
I the two stars, the work of Mr. Kusel be
ing particularly aceptable. To miss Jos-,
eph Hart aud Carrie de Mar Is to miss one
of the besi acts of its kind the Orpheum ;
has ever presented. There Is nothing
boisterous about their workâ Just good.
; clean-out comedy and songs that Interest
' and amuse. Of their songs, a duet, in
which they express the different ways va
rious nationalities have of saying "Good
â  by" and "Gpod night," was the best of
! their character hits, while Mr. Hart's
I "Jew" song is worth the price of admis- j
stun to hear. The pair make one of the
best vaudeville teams that has been seen
here, and they scored a h.i from start
to linlsh. Flour* tte is a dainty little piece ;
of femininity, -who can even make toe |
dancing appear artistic, and her back- j
1 bending is done with a grace that in no j
wise suggests the contortionist. Falke
and Semon have a new act that was a
h!t. Mrs. Alice Shaw and daughters are
; attractive. Others retained from last ;
! week are: Anna Caldwell. Charles
Wayne and Jones, Grant and Jones.
At the Chutes.
The Chutes Theater was crowded as
usual last evening and every number on
the programme was well received. Colby
and Way, the "ventriloquist and the danc
ing doll." made a hit, and Belle Williams,
who is styled the "Quaker City Coon- j
singing Cyclone," gave some brand new ;
. songs. The three Leandos, comedy acro
bats, do some clever work, and George
iH. Diamond, the author-vocalist, is a j
j favorite. A number of new animateu
> war and humorous pictures were shown.
I and Henri Maurice Cannon, the corpulent
1 Swiss, beamed upon hundreds of visitors.
! Great preparations are being made fop
the celebration of the Fall of the Bastile
on Thursday.
At the Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall had its usual
crowded house. The hits scored were by
Ordway and Rand, the bicyclist and the
tramp, in a very funny act: Quizina, the
male La Lole, whose dancing Is equal to
that of a premier danseuse. Tony Ryan,
the mad musician, was as eccentric as
ever. Maude Rockwell and the Royce sla
ters are favorites.
FIRED A BULLET"
INTO HIS BRAIN
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE ,OF A
NEBRASKA YOUNG MAN.
George W. O'Brien Wanted to Die
Rather Than Go Oil Suffering
From Sciatica, Which Had
Crippled Him.
George W. O'Brien, a young man from
Fremont, Nebr. , attempted to commit
suicide yesterday afternoon in his room.
307 Golden Gate avenue. He lired a shot
at his head, und the bullet entered the
left eye, destroying It, and Is supposed to
have lodged in his brain.
O'Brien was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital in the patrol-wagon, and Dr. Fitz
gibbon probed for the bullet, but could not
definitely locate it. The chances of his
recovery are doubtful.
A dispatch was at once sent to his
father, Samuel O'Brien, who is a wealthy
farmer in Fremont, notifying him of his
son's condition and asking for instruc
tions.
O'Brien is 2S years of age and a boilor
maker, but he has hern a sufferer for
years from sciatica, which prevented him
from working. About six months ago his
father gave him $3XI, and be came here i
in the hope that the change of climate i
I would be beneficial to him, but he
worse, which made him despondent. While
i in bed yesterday afternoon he fired the
i Hhot that may cause his death. The owner
of the house ran for a doctor, and while
he was away O'Brien attempted to lire a
second shot.
He did not deny that he intended to
i commit suicide, but said it came nooner
1 than he expected. He thought the re
volver was not loaded, and was practicing
j aa to where to shoot himself when it
i went off.
NEW NATIONAL GUARD.
Governor Budd. States Some Facts
About Its Proposed
Reorganization.
Governor Budd has been devoting much
attention to the proposed reorganization '
of the National Guard, and his plans are I
about completed. Ho announced yester
day afternoon that the new guard would ]
constitute half the number of companies
! of the former guard and half the number
lof each company. This would be equlv
: alent to a quarter the number composing
1 the guard before the war.
"As to the officers for these new com- I
?anies," said he, "1 have not decided, but ]
will say that the officers of the com- j
; panics that were mustered out by me on I
, the former reorganization will be eligible >
i for positions in the new guard, as they
i are only regarded aa being temporarily
I on the retired list."
"How about the guardsmen who may
j return from Manila after the war Is
! over?" was asked.
"Well, 75 per cent of them will be taken
back into the ranks if they desire, and
there will be some proper arrangements
made as to officers returning from the
; Philippines. The distribution of the !
brigades will be determined upon the
return of General Dickinson, who is in the
. south now. obtaining data upon which to
base the brigade boundary lines. I can
' say, however, that San Francisco will
have, six companies, and the remainder
will be properly distributed, throughout
the State."

concluded. The witness shows signs of
the prolonged and tedious questioning
and answers the queries put to him
without an effort and In a monotonous
way.
Yesterday the Attorney General took
him over the coast road and examined
him on Its minutest details. He was
called upon to grive the weight of rails
used from this city to Tres Pinos, their
cost and probable length of life. Ho was
called upon to describe the kind of fences
used alonjc the line, the number of inches
In each board, whether they had a cap
ping; whether they were two or threu
barred and what they cost. He was ex
amined on the amount paid for grubbing
and clearing along the line; how much of
that class (if work done, and last, but not
least, he whs asked whether there were
any snowsheds along the route. To all
of which tho witness either answered or
stated that from his present recollection
he could not enlighten his questioner
without refreshing his recollection from
notes and profile maps and other infor
mation stored In his office, which ho

used in making his examination of the
.road to aid him in making his estimate.
.Attorney General Fitzgerald invited him
to bring those things into court, which
â was promised. Mr. Curtis called the At
torney General's attention to tho large
number of papers which he had brought
1n at his suggestion, but the latter only
made a hasty glance over them, telling
the witness he was not ready for .them
at present, but would notify him when
the maps and papers were needed.
Judge Hayne, who is assisting Judge
Pltzgerald in the examination of wit
nesses by suggestions and questions, lis
tens attentively to what is being said.
He generally breaks his silence by find
ing fault with the witness and Mr. Her
rin lends his protection. This occurs
lonce a day and relieves the monotony of
things. Railroad Commissioner Hinton
Is caught napping at times, but just the
â¢moment a question Is put that will aid
him in his examination of the witness In
future he is all attention.
It Is expected that the examination will
â be finished by August 24, on which date
Judge Beatty will begin the actual trial
of the long drawn out case.

Slim Registration.
Considering the importance attached to
the coming election In which the people
' will be called upon to select the officers
who will govern, not only this State, but
the city and county of San Francisco,
: the Interest that should bo manifested by
| the voters is larking. T*p to the present
! time something like 8000 voters have regls
! tered at the Registrar's oftlce in the City
! Hall, out of a possible 80,000 that will
claim the right to vote when the time
comes. This, as compared with the regis
tration two years ago. when from Ir.OO to
1800 were registered daily, causes HoniÂ»
lack of interest taken now as compared
i wiiu uxa.l nine.
Registrar Biggy is unable to account for
this apparent lack of interest.
Berkeley's Water.
BERKEI.KY. July 11.â The Town Coun
cil this evening passed an ordinance ab
solutely prohibiting the use of the city
water for irrigation while the scarcity
exists. After the final passage of the or
dinance, which will be on Thursday, the
water company will be empowered to
shut off the supply of any householder
violating the ordinance.
The municipal water supply committee
reported progress and was voted $2500, to
be applied tn necessary tests. It Is pos
sible that the threatened drought may be
relieved by making connections with the
Alameda mains.

A RAILROAD
BARRICADE.
TORN DOWN
High Handed Outrage by the
Southern Pacific Manage
ment Resented.
Scheme of the Company to Assert Exclusive
Ownership of the New Ferry Depot
Promptly Upset by the Board of Har
bor Commissioners.
Southern Pacific managers, obvious
ly forgetting that San Francisco had
been emancipated from railroad slav
ery, sought last Saturday evening to
Introduce the old-time tactics of bar
ricading the water front. For very
many years the corporation had such
complete ownership of every official
connected with the Harbor Commission
that the political manager of the com
pany had only to hold up his finger
to the board in order to secure Instant
compliance with any decree from the
railroad.
Notice was given a few days since
by the Harbor Commissioners that the
new depot at the foot of Market street
would be ready for occupany on Mon
day, July 11. Although preparations
had been . making for years to get
everything in readiness to give the
public the advantages to be derived
from the occupancy of the new quar
ters, the Southern Pacific boats were
not ready to receive passengers on the
upper deck. Instead of issuing rush
orders to get the boats ready, the relics
of a past generation in railroading con
cluded to barricade the stairways lead
ing from the first floor of the depot
to the capacious and finely appointed
â waiting rooms and grand nave of the
second floor. The consent of the Har
bor Commission was not solicited and
the convenience of the public was
never thought of for a minute. It was
enough for the corporation to know
that the old boats had not been put
in order and the new boats to fit the
new conditions would not be ready un
til next October. What was more nat
ural then for the Southern Pacific, in
the light of its past dealings with the
California public, than to close up the
entrances to the depot and exclude the
people until the corporation got ready
to open up for regular business?
To the surprise and consternation of
every one about the railroad institution
from the president down the antique line
to i in ticket clerks, tiie Harbor Commls
sionera instantly removed the iron rods
barring admission to the second floor of
the new depot. In olden days such an
;,. r would have been construed as hign
n and the offending Commissioners
would have been bounced from office and
; out to the cold charities of the
I. The audacious Harbor Commis
rs who removed the bars did not
complain to the managers of the railroad
al out the obstruction, l:ut simply treated
the corporation as a common trespasser
str.'l broke rf'iwn the iron gates. So far as
can be ascertained the company has not
demanded of Governor Budd that the
Commissioners be removed. Everything
is differeni from the style of the old
days wlvti Governors s-'nt around ever>
Pi< rn'ng to get instructions from railroad
Â« arters.
The utter lack of enterprise in the man
agement of the Southern Pacific is again
very clearly exhibited. After all the
money and time expended by the progres
sive people of San Francisco to prepare
modern and first-class accommodations
for the traveling public, it is now found
that the boats belonging to the old South
ern Pacific are not ready to receive pas
sengers on the cabin deck. Noah could
have done better with his ark In the days
of the deluge than the Southern PacifU:
is able to do at the dawn of the twentieth
century. Forms keep moving about the
yellow building and there is a tradition
that some of the inhabitants of the housÂ«
are really alive, but one watching the
construction and repair of the ferry boats
to fit the new depot landings would not
fancy that vitality existed in the man-
agem^nt.
The trouble between the Commission
ers and the railroad grew out of the
quarters set aside for the Southern Pa
cific in the new ferry depot. The Har
bor Commissioners notified the corpora
tion last week that the apartments in
the building that had been arranged for
them would be ready for occupancy on
Tuesday, and it was supposed that the
long-suffering public, after years of
â¢waiting, would be at last afforded thÂ«?
luxury of up-to-date depot accommoda
tions.
On Saturday the board was shocked
with the statement that the Southern Pa
cific Company had sent its employes to
the ferry depot and erected barriers to

! the entrances leading to the second
story and upper decks of the steamers,
evidently intending to use only the lower
floor, with all Us old-time inconveniences.
As soon as this fact was learned there
! was a hurried meeting of the board, and
; its first act was to order the barriers re
moved. Another communication was sent
; to the corporation in which it was noti
fied in an explicit way that until further
; orders they must remain in their present
quarters, known as "the cave of the
; winds." Furthermore, that explanations
were obtainable at the office of the
board.
In other words, the Commissioners were
individually and collectively experiencing
a high degree of temperature and deter
mined that there should be no such
wrecking of their plans of the disappoint
ment of the public.
"The railroad company pursued its
usual course," said one of the Commis
sioners, In explaining: the situation yes
terday. "It ignored the Board of Com
missioners wholly and simply erected the
blockades to the upper lloors. doubtless
supposing that all it had to do was to
head off the public and herd them into
the old lower deck chutes as heretofore.
and that would be the end of it. How
ever, the corimrat'on counted chickens
too fast and had not rf-okoned on the
fact that that Rreat building had been
built primarily for the convenience of the
traveling public as well as for the cor
porations that make use of it. There
was no trouble with the other two ferry
companies and the people who patronize
them can enjoy the benelits of the mod
ern building.
"What made the commissioners partic
ularly incensed was the fact that in the
construction of the section of the depot in
tended for the Southern Pacific Company
or.r architect and superintendent of con
struction advised with the representatives
of the company as to the arrangement of
the rooms, entrances and all matters af
fecting the convenience of the corporation
as well as the comforts of the public.
These upper floors, on which are tne su
perb waiting rooms and retiring rooms for
men and women, are the iinest things in
the great structure, the apartments for
ladies being fitted up as luxuriously as a
palace car; where they can fix their hair,
see that their hats are on straight . and
make themselves more presentable on ar
rival or departure from the city.
"We had just cause for ang.r at this
presumptuous action of the company, par
ticularly in view of the fact that It did
not show us the small courtesy to say
'by your leave,' or offer any explanation
for the astounding move. A couple of
weeks ago we notified these people that
there would have to be a readjustment of
the rental, and they replied that they
would 'take the matter up' after iuly 4.
The way they "took it up' caused us to
suspect that they had concluded to dodge
the rent of the upper floor for a while on
the ground that they did not need it.
However, we did not leave the matter
long in doubt, and with the removal of the
barriers notified the Southern Pacific Com
pany to stay where they were in the old
ram-shackle cattle-pen until further In
structions from the board. The way they
had matters arranged the. people would
have found even worse accommodations
than they now have in the old shed, and
that stems Impossible, but they would
have found It necessary to temper them
selves to the foggy, dusty zephyrs in the
corridors instead of enjoying their rights
In the comfortable waiting rooms. All be
cause the company found it inconvenient
to make things convenient for the public.
The Inconvenience lay in the fact that
they might have to employ a couple of
men at $50 per month to tend the gates
and take up tickets. On the other hand,
it looks as though ihey would not need as
many employes. It all comes back to the
proposition that for some small matter
that could be readily adjusted the com
pany deliberately fenced the peopi,- out of
thefr own property and went about its
business as though that were an ond of li.
The board does nut propose to submit to
any su<-h autocratic work, as time will
prove. We propose to see that that build
ing is devoted to and used for the purposes
for which It was intended."
There was consternation at the head
quarters of the Southern Pacific Company
when the action of the Harbor Commis
sioners was learned, and ad soon as pos
sible General Superintend' nt Fillmore,
accompanii l by Division Superintendent
Agier of Oakland and Agent White, hur
ried to the office of the State Board for :i
conference. '1 he private consultation
lasted for a long time, the full board be
ing present. Upon the departure of Mr.
Fillmore, President Colnon. speaking for
the board, said that Superintendent Fill
more had proposed jx temporary compro
mise, which had been accepted." upon the
understanding that it would be strictly
observed.
"Mr. Fillmore's explanation of the ac
tion of the company." said President Col
nnn, "is that the ferry-boat Oakland is
laid up for repairs and that the N.-wark
Is not fitted for taking passengers on the
upper deck; also that a new steamer wlli
not be completed for two months, at the
least. He proposed, however, that his
company take a boat from the Alnmeda
line and operate it on the broad-gauge
route until the Oakland was refitted. By
this means the company could operate the
Oakland line during the daytime up to 7
o'clock p. m., and give the public all the
advantages of the use of upper and lower
| deck entrances and reception rooms This
THE SAX 'FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 12, 1898.
service will begin on Wednesday at noon.
On the narrow-gauge only the lower deck
accommodations will be available until
the new steamer is completed."
Superintendent J. A. Fillmore, when
seen after the conference, said that he
thought that, under the circumstances,
matters had been satisfactorily adjusted.
"The company," he remarked, "most
certainly desires to conform to whatever
regulations may be laid down by the
board. In the present instance we were
handicapped by the laying off of the Oak
land, and thought that there would be no
objection to the postponement of the
opening of the upper entrances and exits
until our new steamer was completed and
the twenty-minute service inaugurated.
However, the Commissioners said no, and
that settled it. We will give the double
service on the broad gauge up to 7 p. m.,
beginning Wednesday noon, but on the
narrow gauge will only use the lower
deck entrance until the other boats are
ready. As the travel is light in the even
ing the closing of the upper entrances
after night will not be very inconvenient,
am. is only temporary at that. The trou
ble is over, and I don't think the public
will have any particular cause to com
plain of the arrangement."
Governor Budd, when told of the action
of the Harbor Commissioners, expressed
mm h satisfaction.
"You say the barriers have been re
moved." said he. "and that the rail
road company will operate the main line
up to 7 p. m.. as was originally intended?
That Is good. These matters are in the
hands of the Commissioners, and I am
satisfied that they will manage the affair
to the satisfaction of the public."
A DAY WITH THE OYSTERS.
The Twentieth Annual Sail to Mora-
ghan's Beds in the Bay.
One of those happy bay excursion par
ties that don't invite everybody to join
them and had inclosed cards of Invita
tion with the words "not transferable"
printed and underscored on the margin
assembled .it the Folsom-street wharf
last Sunday morning at S o'clock, and
from there sailed away on board the tug
Elizabeth and two sailboats for the oyster
beds of M. B. Moraghan Company down
the bay.
The day was everything that could be
desired and tho company being select a
more jovial party seldom pushed away
from the wharf for a day's outing.
The visit to sleeping bivalves, where
crows on hand yanked up the fattest and
most luscious of the tidbits inclosed be
tween their shells was a feature of the
visit, more particularly as by the time
the party reached the oyster beds the
guests were as hungry as a band of cap
tured Spanish soldiers and ready to eat
raw oysters with feathers on. How
ever, everybody was more than delight
ed with the trip and, judging from the
appearance of the party as it stepped on
the wharf at 7 o'clock in the evening, each
member looked ten years younger than
he did when he started in the morning.

GEEMAN SYMPATHY.
It Is Entirely With the United States
in the Present Trouble With the
Haughty Don.
| G. Holtzscherer. a prominent resident of
i Strasburg, Alsace, arrived from his home
; in Germany last night and Is the gruest of
i his cousin, Colonel F. S. Pott Mr. ilolt
scherer is an educated gentleman, speak
ing English tlut-ntly. lie was very much
surprised to learn on his arrival in New
York a week ago last Sunday that the im
, pression prevailed In the United States
that the people of Germany were un
friendly to the I'nited States on account
of the war with Spain, and that their sym
pathies were with the people of that coun
! try. Mr. Hbltscherer said that he had
conversed with hundreds of his fellow
countrymen in Germany and found that
their friendship for the United States had
not been affected in the least by the war.
On the contrary the!*; aympainies were
: altogether with the American people in
1 the present struggle.
"We have never forgotten that we are
relatives of the American people as mem
bers of the great Anglo-Saxon race." he
Bald, "and we take pride In the achieve
ments of a member of the family in
spreading the gospel of enlightenment,
progress ami civilization all over the
world. The English newspapers are re
sponsible for this false impression that
has gone abroad respecting out feelings.
All that Germany desires is to protect and
f- T~t < r her commercial Interests, ami we
believe that those interests will be the
gainer by the American acquisition of the
Philippines and the Spanish West Indies."
Mr. Holtzscherer is here on business
connected with the settlement of the Lux
oj Miller estate, in which his cousin.
Colonel Pott, is also interested.
Caught in the Act.
For some time past C. L. Samson, who
owns a paper warehouse on Montgomery
j street, has been missing bundles of paper
I left in front of his store by draymen.
He reported the case at the California
i street station, and an officer was sent to
| watch the store. Yesterday morning Of
fleer W. H. Young saw a man walk de
] liberalely up to the store, pick up a ream
of paper and start away with it. lie ar
rested the man, who gave his name as
George Dillon. Dillon has been selling the
paper to an Italian at 25 cents per ream.
: It is worth about $3 a ream.

HER VOYAGE
A PERFECT
MELODRAMA
Strange Happenings on
the Ship Eulomene.
THEY BEGAN WITH A WEDDING
VESSEL WAS NEARLY WRECKED
IN BASS STRAITS,
A "Dead Beat" Stowed Away and
Three of the Crew Were Washed
Overboard and Two Washed
Back Again.
Captain Ellis of the British ship Eu
lomene has passed through some exciting
scenes during the past six months. First
and foremost, while the vessel was in
Adelaide, South Australia, he was mar
ried to Miss Gertrude Hunt, a beautiful
and charming young lady of that city,
who accompanies her husband. While
the vessel was on her way to Newcastle,
N. S. W., she was nearly wrecked in Bass
Straits. After being loaded with coal the
Eulomene started for San Francisco, and
when twenty-four hours out a stowaway
was found aboard. The crew took him
for a second Butler, and he was treated
as such throughout the voyage. May last
the good ship wound up her adventures
for the voyage by having throe of the
crew washed overboard. Luckily two of
them were washed back a^ain by a re
turning wave, and were rescued by their
companions. The third man went down,
while everything possible was being done
to savo him.
Captain Ellis' account of the disaster
is short and to the point. His entry In
THE MEN WHO ESCAPED.
While on her way from Newcastle, N. S. "W., for San Francisco, three
of the crew of the British ship Eulomene were washed overboard dur
ing a gale. Two of the men were washed back by the returning wave, but
the third went down within a boat's length of the ship.
the ship's log is as follows: "While all
hands were hauling aft the main sheet
the ship took a large body of water over
the weather side. It washed Allen,
Thompson and McDonald aboard. Allen
and Thompson came back on the crest
of the next wave, but McDonald was
washed clear of the ship.' All possible
assistance was rendered. The ship was
hove to and the boats cleared. McDonald
failed to catch the life buoy that was
ti.rnwn to him and went down within a
boat's length of the ship."
The men of the Eulomene who had such
a marvelous escape from a watery grave
are W. A. R; Allen, an apprentice, and
J. C. Thompson, A. B. "What were my
thoughts and teelings when 1 found my
self in the water?" repeated Allen, slowly,
yesterday, when asked that question.
"Well, do you know, 1 don't think I had
any. it all happened so quickly that I
hadn't time to think before I was b.-u-k
alongside the ship, and Connor grabbed
me by the back of the neck and pulled me
aboard. Then 1 did think, and the
thought of, my narrow escape nearly
made me faint. You .see, it was just a
smother of water, and then a struggle
to g(Â»t my head above the wave ,lust in
time to see the vessel, as I thought, trav
eling toward me like lightning. The next
instant Connor had made his grab, and I
â¢was on the deck."
Allen is a gentlemanly young fellow,
who would go to sea, and this narrow es
cape has not robbed htm of his love of the
sen. -
Thompson tells his story in a blunt
Btraightiorward manner. "McDonald and
I were reefing the sheet." said he,
"When the big wave caught us I grabbed
the stopper for the sheet. This T held
on to for a minute and was thrown
against the side of the ship. I was badly
bruised, and thought more of my injuries
than I did erf death. The next wave
â¢washed me aboard again and the boys
held me until all danger was passed. Mc-
Donald grabbed the sheet ;.s he was go
ing over, and held on. Murray, who was
on the main yard, saw his danger and
came down, hand under hand, to help
him. but arrived too late. McDonald got
exhausted, and. letting go, vas carried
away from the ship. Everything possible
was done to save him, but he went down
before our eyes."
The disaster happened on May 2 In lat
itude 28 north, longitude 170 west. A
heavy breeze, Increasing to a gale, was
blowing, and the storm was accompanied
by fierce squalls and rain.
When passing through Bass Straits on
her way to Newcastle. N. S. W.. the Eu
lomene nearly went down with all hands. |
It was blowing a hurricane and not a j
stitch of canvas could be kept on the !
ship. She was drifting rapidly toward a
perpendicular cliff, which meant instant
death to all on board if once the vessel i
struck, when Captain Ellis ordered both
anchors let go. Luckily they held and
for eight days the Eulomene lay within
a stonethrow of a rockbound shore that i
was waiting to destroy her. 'When a
chance came to get away Captain Ellis
had to leave his best bower and 150 fath
oms of chain behind him, but he was
only too glad to get his vessel away with
that slight loss.
The day after the Eulomene left New
castle for San Francisco a tall, lantern
jawed man crawled on deck. He was a
stowaway and said he had eaten nothing
for three days. He was hardly able to
stand from hunger, so the first thing was
to give him a square meal. Then he told
First Officer C. Sherratt that his name
was John Walker and that he wanted to
reach the United States. He was useless
as a sailor, and as the men set him down
as a fugitive from justice Walker had a
hard time of it. He told Mate Sherratt
that if he wanted to know very badly
what he was he would tell him. When
told to "spit it out" he said: "I'm a pro
fessional dead beat. I've beaten my wax
over every railroad line in America; I've |
beaten my way on every steamship line
that runs to and from Europe; I've beat
en my way to the Southern seas and from
there to the Arctic, and I beat my way
to Australia, but I'll never do it again.
No chance back there for a dead beat to
make an honest living."
"What are you going to do when you
get to Frisco?" asked Mate Sherratt,
and the answer came trippingly, "Beat
my way to the K.ondike."
When the Eulomene anchored off Al
cntraz Mate Sherratt was going to put
Walker in irons, but the man protested
so earnestly that ho would not try to es
cape and the chancos of doing so were so
Blender that he was allowed his liberty.
Soon after this "Busty" Hart, the boat
man, took Dr. Mac Donald alongside the
Eulomene and the two of them went on
hoard. It was dark and no one saw
Walker slip over the side and into the
boat. He cut the painter and rowed si
lently away. In a few minutes the boat â¢
was missed and while another was being
pot ready to lower to go in search of it
Walker was nlso missing Then every
body knew what had happened. Walker
rowed ashore and then cast the boat
adrift Yesterday afternoon Hart found
it on the Alameda mud flats. The "pro
fessional dead beat" is a tall, thin man,
and wears a full brown beard. His
clothing is fairly good and he will surely
make somebody suffer before he is long
In San Francisco.
There is likely to be trouble over Dr.
ifacDonald's visit to the Eulomene. He
went aboard before she was passed by
the quarantine officers, and now State
Quarantine Officer Chalmers says he will
have the master of the vessel and the
pilot who broueht her in arrested for al
lowing Mac Donald aboard.
DYNAMITE ABOARD.
Captain Gilbert of the Schooner
Aitair Got Himself Into
Trouble.
Captain Gilbert of the schooner Altair,
which arrived from the "Island of Gold"
la Sunday, rot himself into trouble yes
terday. He rec ived permission to dock
his vessel sÂ»' AVashlngton-stret wharf to
discharge some ore (the specimens
brought from the new El Dorado), but
did not say a word about having dyna
mite aboard. An hour later a stevedore
ran into the Chief Wharti.iger's office,
saying he had to discharge the explosive
and did not ire to handle it with a lot of
drunken sailors aboard. Assistant Chief
Wharfinger Scott at onco ordered the yes-
Bel into the stream and threatened to
have Captain Gilbert arrested for dis
obeying the rules and regulations of the

for running away with a boat from a
British ship. He went for a Bail and then
abandoned the boat when he had no more

MINISTERS MEET IN
WEEKLY CONFERENCE
REV. T. D. BUTLER TALKS ON
MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.
He Condemns the Present Marriage
State for Being Vicious and
Disgraceful â Other Sub
jects Discussed.
According to Rev. Thomas D. Butler,
pastor of the. First Christian Church of
Oakland, the- condition of the marriage
state in America is vicious and disgrace
ful. The well-known minister visited
this city yesterday and gave voice to this
statement before a body of fellow
ministers who listened with approval to
his views on the familiar subject.
"What is the relation of the minister of
the gospel to the administration of the
| marriage ceremony? is marriage a politi
cal association or modern institution? Is
the minister the agent of the state, of so
ciety or of God?" In answer to these
queries, the speaker said in part: "The
I condition of the marriage state in
America is largely vicious and disgrace
ful, hence the very frequent recourse
which is had to the divorce courts for
1. gal separation. I cannot mention any
evil more productive of misery and the
indescribable ills of human society. It is
Clear to my mind that if anything anrnng
us needs the purifying and sweetening in
fluence of Christ's religion it is this evil.
â¢'When we come to speak of society and
its mandates In this realm we are speak
ing of an uncrowned potentate whose un
bridled will may affect the personal popu
larity of the minister. Hut he is a servant
of an uncertain quality and quantity, that
he should for money insert the clause of
sensationalism by appearing officially in
public places to draw a crowd to see him
openly prostitute his otlice by making a
burlesque or mockery of sacred ordi
nances of the marriage ceremony.
"I hold that a minister of the gospel
commits sacrilege and thereby inflicts a
grievous injury on public morality, and
specifically on 'the marriage ordinance in
the popular mind and practice, when he
has reasonable ground to know the fact,
that he becomes a party to an ar
rangement by which a sacred ordinance
is prostituted into a mere spectacular
event for a money consideration or for
the entertainment of a crowd who furnish
the money that is to compensate the pro
moters of such a show."
Dr. Butler held that except on scriptural
grounds a minister cannot properly recog
nize divorce. "This.'" he said, "will neces
sarily involve absolute refusal to be a
party to the marriage of divorced persons
with* others. The minister of the gospel
is paid to maintain God's word and ordi
nances, and he cannot rightly join to-
I gether by the marriage ceremony those
where one or both have been unserip
turally released from their marriage ob
lii.:i ! lonS."
Dr. F. 11. Foster, professor of the Pacific
Theological Seminary, appeared before the
Congregational ministers and read a paper
on "What Constitutes the Deposition o*. a
Congregational Minister." The paper con
tended that when a man loses the certili
cation of his ministerial character by the
legal association of churches and minis
ters, he thereby loses his character as a
I Congregational minister and that such
loss Is the real equivalent of deposition.
The theory that action of a council is nec
essary to deposition was examined and it
was that such a council can only
! do what has already been done by expul
sion from the local conference and conse-
q uently does and can add nothing to what
the conference affects.
Dr. S. H. Wiliey and Dr. James H. War
i ren, pioneer ministers, were elected hon
orary members of the body.
The Presoyterians elected the following
as their olllcers for the ensuing term:
Rev. S. S. Cryor, president; Rev. R. W.
Reynolds, vice president; Rev. James
AVoodworth, secretary and treasurer.
Reports of commissioners to the Win
ona conference were heard. Rev. John
Hemphill told of the work accomplished
there, and Rev. Theodore F. Burnham
described the trip and gave other inter
esting information.
Rev. D. W. Chilton addressed the Meth
odist meeting on "The Social Problem."
He was listened to with great interest and
at the conclusion of his remarks a general
discussion took place.
Rev. Dr. Milnes of Fruitvale said that
the church was not doing its duty toward
the poorâ not looking after their interests.
"Christ paid comparatively little atten
tion to the rich, but mostly to he poor,"
he said. "I consider that if we would do
our work God would not lift up the Sal
vation Army to meet the want."
MAY COMPROMISE THE CASE.
Growth of Timber Destroyed by Sul
phurous Fumes From a
Smelter.
Judge Beatty sat on the bench of the
United States Circuit Court yesterday and
called the calendar. Among the more im
portant cases was that of the United
States vs. the Mountain Copper Company
a suit instituted by the Forestry Commis
sion to compel the copper company to
pay indemnity for damages done to verd
ure.
The works of the company are located
at Keswick, Shasta County, and It is al
leged that the fumes have destroyed all
verdure in the vicinity of the works. It
is stated by Attorney Knight that thÂ»
copper company will compromise the case
if possible and is willing to pay a reason
able indemnity,- as it is willing to admit
that verdure has been destroyed by the
fumes, and it alleges that it "is impossi
ble to carry on the business without gen
erating a large quantity of sulphuric
acid, which would either kill the fish if
dumped into the river or destroy the
verdure if vaporized. The company haa
chosen what it considers the lesser evil
and is accordingly willing- to compromise
the case if the law will allow.
The Oakland water front case was con
tinued for the term, us it is now being
considered by the Supreme Court. The
(â¢use of the United States vs. the Coal
Dealers' Association was continued until
September 5.
Chinese Robbers.
Wo Hen Tee 'and Won Win were ar
raigned in Judge Megan's court yester
day on a charge of assault to rob, and
at their request the case was continued
until to-morrow. They are accused of
going into the laundry of Mah Sing, 777
Folsom stivct, Sunday afternoon, and
attempting to rob him while he was
asleep on a lounge in a room in the rear
of the laundry. They were arrested by
Policemen Greenan and Murphy.
Willing to Compromise.
The executors of the estate of Dr.
Washington M. Ryer have petitioned the
Probate Court for permission to compro
mise a suit brought by James G. Phelan
for $3500. The application will be heard
next Friday.
