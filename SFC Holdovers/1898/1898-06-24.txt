ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL
DISPATCH BOAT MINDORA, off
Santiago, via Port Antonio, Jamaica,
June 23.-Hard though desultory
fighting was going on in the moun
tains on all sides of Santiago last
night. Shafter continued the land
ing of troops at the Sigua Iron Com
pany's docks. While this was going
on several transports proceeded
westward twelve miles, and troops
were landed to co-operate directly
with the Cuban forces marching
upon the doomed city from that
direction. From the hills back of
Santiago 900 Cubans have appeared
and are harassing the enemy. Two
bodies of Spaniards were driven
from the hills in this direction back
upon Santiago. This was only done
after desperate fighting, in which
twenty-five Spaniards are said to
have been killed and twice that
number wounded.
The Spaniards have plenty of
ammunition, but show the effects
of the terrible strain they must
have been under since the appear
ance of the American troops.
Admiral Sampson gave orders
that the Texas, Massachusetts
and Oregon should maintain a
steady fire this morning upon the
batteries on each side and back
of Morro Castle. Unless the or
der was countermanded hard
fighting is surely going on all
along the line.
Admiral Sampson also ordered
Captain McCalla this morning to
keep the Marblehead busy at
Guantanamo to-day. The Cu
bans who came out of Santiago
last night report the city suffer
ing terribly. Hunger is encroach
ing upon the citizens and soldiers
alike. The citizens of Santiago
are already petitioning the Gov
ernor that a surrender be made
without further fighting.

MADRID, June 2 3 ._ An offi
cial dispatch from Santiago de
Cuba, dated June 23, says:
"The attack commenced yes
The San Francisco Call
terday. The enemy concentrated
his landing forces in front of Pun
ta Borraco, lying eastward of our
left flank, which extended for
eight leagues along the coast."
Another official dispatch from
Havana says: "The commander
at Santiago de Cuba announces
that the American squadron has
commenced the bombardment
and is trying to disembark at
Baiquiri and at Punta BorraCo.
An American warship has shelled
and destroyed a small wooden
fort near Cienfuegos. Seven
Spaniards were slightly wound

News of serious fighting near
Santiago de Cuba has been re
ceived here. Admiral Cervera
cables that the situation is criti
cal, and the Governor of Santi
ago admits the Spaniards have
been obliged to retire, but a
Spanish victory is claimed.
The Minister for War, General
Correa, it is announced, has re
ceived an official dispatch from
Santiago de Cuba, announcing
"that the Americans' attack on
Punta Borr.aco has been repulsed
after a hard-fought and bloody
engagement." Punta Borraco is

and is under the guns of the
American fleet.
Cable dispatches received here
from Admiral Cervera say the
crews of the Spanish warships at
Santiago have joined the land
forces in order to take part in the
defense of the city. He adds that
the situation is critical, but a later
dispatch affirms that the Span
iards "have victoriously repulsed
the enemy."
A dispatch from the Governor
of Santiago de Cuba says: "The
attack on Seboney and Baiquiri
continued until nightfall. The
enemy were repulsed except on
the left at Baiquiri, where the
Spaniards were obliged to retire
in consequence of the flanking
movement on the part of the ene
my, who landed several kilomet
ers east of Baiquiri. The Span
ish forces retired in good order
into the mountains. Seboney
and Borraco were destroyed by
the American shells."
During the afternoon a semi
official note was issued "in order
to avoid a misunderstanding,"
pointing out that merely the
Spanish retired and took up a
position in the mountains, owing
to the Americans landing nine
kilometers east of Baiquiri, where
there were no Spanish troops,
and endeavoring to outflank the
Spaniards.

PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica, June 23.â
Two hundred Cubans from General Ce
brecos' camp, six miles west of Sao
tiago, attacked the Spanish outposts
west of Santiago this afternoon. The
Cubans were led by Colonel Cebrecos,
the general's brother.
General Shafter's plan called for a
force of 2000 Cubans, and had that
number responded and had they
obeyed, General Shafter's hope of
drawing the Spaniards hi force west-
Avard while he disembarked eastward
would surely have been successful, but
the Spaniards moved in neither direc
tion and stayed entrenched at Santiago.
The rifle fire of a handful of Cubans
and the presence of two transports and
one schooner and the accustomed bom
bardment from sea was not enough to
convince them that the Americans in
tended to make a landing.
The Cubans say that the non-arrival
of promised food prevented them from

concentrating 2000 men. However, they
contend they have driven 400 Span
iards from Coletta, a most important
outpost. Had the full design carried
General Shafter would have been in
control of the nearest hill to Santiago,
within half range and upon the flank of
the harbor entrance and could easily
destroy them, allowing Sampson to
drag torpedoes and capture or destroy
the Spanish ships and incidentally have
Santiago city and the troops there at
his mercy. Â»
SHELLS MAKE THE
SPANIARDS SCfIMPER
LIKE JOCKRABBITS
PLATA DEL. ESTE, Guantanamo
Bay province of Santiago de Cuba,
Thursday afternoon, June 23, 2:07.
â Before the landing yesterday the fleet
in front of El Morro opened out and
the ships steaming along between San
tiago and Baiquiri, to prevent re-en
foicements by the railroad to the latter
point, shelled every village on the coast.
The Bancroft, Wilmington and Vixen
discovered a regiment of Spanish sol
diers defiling down the road to Jura
gua and their shells sent them scamper
ing up the hills like jackrabbits.
The warships, before the landing,
shelled the town of Baiquiri and the
surrounding hills for half an hour.
What remained of the smoldering vil
lage was wrecked, the crash of the
guns rending the rock and reverberat
ing among the hills. Great smoke banks
drifted in shore, completely veiling the
ridges for miles. Steam launches with
one-pound Colt guns in the bows and
the Tecumseh and Suwanee covered the
landing inside the pier.
The firing was reopened after the As
sociated Press dispatch boat Dauntless
left. The iron mines and most of the
property at Baiquiri are owned by a
Baltimore company.
SPfJNIARDS REFUSE

FIGHT IN THE OPEN
SANTIAGO DE CUBA (by the Her-
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
aid-Call dispatch boat to Port Antonio,
Jamaica), June 23. â The apparent les
son drawn from yesterday's general
attack covering fully twelve miles of
shore line is that the Spaniards have
decided to remain sullenly within the
trenches nearest Santiago, and there
await attack by the American forces.
Every opportunity was given them yes
terday to come out and fight with a su
periority of position and numbers in
their favor. They refused to accept the
challenge, and fought only where di
rectly attacked. The determination of
the Spaniards is somewhat disappoint
ing to General Shafter, as it probably
means a prolongation of the Santiago
campaign, yet it is satisfactory in that
it simplifies matters, and the American
general knows exactly "what task con
fronts him.
The armies will close in on the city
as soon as the commissary department
completes its arrangements.
One of Shafter's aides at midnight
predicted the fall of Santiago within
ten days.

PRESS DISPATCH-BOAT WANDA,
BAIQUIRI HARBOR, Cuba, Wednes
day, June 22, 5 p. m. (via Kingston, Ja
maica), Thursday, June 23, 5:30 p. m.
At 6 o'clock this afternoon 6000 trained
American soldiers are camped in and
around Baiquiri, and 10,000 more rest
on their arms on board the transports
ready to join those who have debarked
as soon as the available launches and
boats can carry them ashore.
The Cuban insurgents bore their
share in the enterprise honorably and
well. Five thousand of them, in
mountain fastnesses and dark thickets
and ravines, lay all last night on their
guns, watching every road and moun
tain path leading from Santiago to
Guantanamo. A thousand were within
sight of Baiquiri, making the approach
of the Spaniards under cover of
darkness an impossibility.
General Shafter, on board the Se
gueranea, closely watched the landing
of the troops.
Brigadier General Lawton, who had
been detailed to command the landing
of the troops, led the way in a launch
accompanied by his staff, and directed
the formation of the line of operation.
General Lawton threw a strong de
tachment for the night about six miles
west, on the road to Santiago, and an
other detachment was posted to the
north of the town, among the hills. The
rest of the troops were quartered in the
town, some of them being housed in the
buildings of the iron company. Other
troops were quartered in desefted
houses, while < thers still preferred the
shelter of their tents in the adjoining
fields.
The landing was accomplished with
out loss of life, the only casualty being
the wounding of an insurgent on the
hills by a shell from one of our ships.
He will lose his arm. The insurgent
troops at Baiquiri are commanded by
General Castillo and are estimated to
number a thousand men.
NEW YORK, June 23.â A special
dated at Playa del Este, Cuba, to-day,
said that at 1 o'clock this morning the
last of General Shatter's army of in
vasion had landed at Baiquiri.
SHAFTER WILL SOON
BE HAMMERING fIT THE
GOTES OF SANTIAGC
WASHINGTON, June 23.â Secretary
Alger and General Miles were in con
ference in the Secretary's office at 4
o'clock to-day when the first Madrid
bulletin announcing that fighting had
begun was shown to them. The Secre
tary read it aloud with evident satis
faction and both of them expressed
themselves gratified with this favorable
report, coming as it did from the enemy.
There was no surprise that the fighting
had begun so soon. It was suggested
by the reporter that the troops had
completed their landing only this morn
ing.
"Yes, but they have gone there to
fight and are ready to begin it at once,"
replied General Miles. Secretary Alger
said that no word had been received up
to that hour indicating that fighting
was in progress. He had no reason to
doubt, however, that our troops had
encountered the Spanish forces and had
given a good account of themselves.
He commented on Admiral Cerver.a's
cable that the situation was "critical."
and that the Spaniards had been
obliged to retire as in strange contrast
with Madrid's claims of a "Spanish vic
tory."
General Miles said that the American
troops would now push forward ag
gressively, driving in the Spaniards
and forcing them to fight. There was
not a suggestion of apprehension or
doubt, eithei with Secretary Alger or
General Miles, as to what the outcome
would be. They had made their plans
and they were confident that General
Shafter and his troops would be ham
mering at the gates of Santiago before
long.
The impression here is that the Span
iards will make their strongest stand
close to Santiago and the inner harbor, I
within the range of protection of the
guns of the big Spanish warships lying
there. There is no doubt that until
these ships are removed from the field
of operations the campaign against
Santiago will be conducted against i
odds. The guns of the ships command I
the hills over which our soldiers must
come to attack the town and reach the
bay, but we will soon bring our own ar
tillery into play.
The naval officials here believe that !
when the time comes for an attack by
land upon the town Sampson will force
his way into the harbor and take part
In the engagement. They are satisfied
that the wreck of the Merrimac does
not completely block the channel, and
say that U Sampson does not come in
the Spanish fleet is likely to make a I
desperate eilort to get out. The mines I
are to bo considered in such a case,
but It r s believed that once Morro
Cattle is taken by the combined at
tack of the soldiers and fleet these ob
structions can be easily removed with
the experience gained in Guantanamo
Bay.
The only positive news coming to the
War Department up to the close of of
fice hours was a dispatch to General
Miles from one of his staff officials with
General Shafter and also a brief dis
patch to General Greely from Lieuten
ant-Colonel Allen. General Miles' dis
patch stated In substance thattheland
ing of troops had been completed with
out any casualties save one Cuban sol
dier, who had his arm Injured by the
bursting of a shell. The troops of Gar
Â«la and Rabl, about 5700 in number,
had met the American forces with en
thusiastic greetings. Stress was laid
upon the point that the Cubans were
well armed and well disciplined. Gar
cia was confident that his forces would
be swelled to 10,000 men as soon as San
tiago fell. About the only need among
the Cubans was shoes and quinine.
The dispatch to General Greely merely
stated that progress was being made in
connecting the military forces directly
with the War Department.
During the day orders were Issued to
the entire division comprising the
newly created command of Brigadier-
General Guy V. Henry for its speedy
departure to re-enforce General Shaf
ter at Santiago. Already the Thirty
third Michigan regiment and one bat
talion of the Thirty-fourth Michigan
have started on this mission. To-day's
orders cover the balance of General
Henry's command. It includes the re
maining battalions of the Thirty
fourth Michigan and the Ninth Massa
chusetts regiment. These will complete
General Duffleld's command. The Third
Virginia, which belongs to this brigade,
will not go, as its equipment is Incom
plete. The orders also cover the entire
brigade of Brigadier-General Garret
son, which includes the Sixth Illinois,
Sixth Massachusetts and Eighth and
Ninth Ohio regiments.
The plan is to move all of General
Henry's division on the Harvard and
Yale, the ships to make two round
trips. The first trip will carry most,
if not all, of General Duffleld's brigade.
The War Wepartment allows three days
for the trip, two days to unload troops
and three days to return to Newport
News, making eight days. By tttat
time General Garretson's brigade will
be at Newport News, ready to go on
board the ships, and then comes the
second trip, taking three days, with
two days allowed for Garretson's
troops to unload in Cuba.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va.. June 23.â
The auxiliary cruiser Yale, with the
Thirty-third Michigan Regiment and
one battalion of the Thirty-fourth
Michigan, sailed from Old Point this
evening at 6 o'clock for Santiago. The
troops, to the number of 1600, are in
command of General Duffield. Colo
nel Boynton of the Thirty-third Regi
ment is second in command. The men
arrived from Washington by steaiftf>r
early this morning. A large crowd as
sembled to see the troops embark, and
when the Yale weighed anchor and
headed for the capes a mighty cheer
went up from the soldiers and dVJl
ians on the Government pier. The aux
iliary cruiser Harvard will leave Old
Point for Santiago Monday or Tues
day with another expedition.

OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 22
(via Kingston, Jamaica, June 23).â
With the complete investment of Santi
ago de Cuba by land and by sea but a j
few days off the admiral has decided to j
strengthen the blockade of the large
ports of the southern coast westward
of Santiago. For three weeks the south
coast, west of Santiago de Cuba, to
Cape. San Antonio has been practically i
unprotected. The blockade ha's been |
simply on paper In name only, with j
the result that it is known that quite a j
number of ships have run the blockade '
and that an Immense quantity of pro
visions has been smuggled into
Havana.
Most of the blockade runners have
landed their cargoes under the lee of
the Isle of Pines, and thence the pro
visions, etc., have been taken in small
boats to Batabano, whence the railroad
runs to Havana, only thirty-five miles.
The majority of the blockade runners
have gone out of Jamaica, and two of
them at least are known to have made
several trips. Only last week the
steamer Purisima Concepcion, flying
the Spanish flag, took a cargo out of
Kingston, ostensibly for Manzanillo,
but probably for the Isle of Pines. The
auxiliary cruiser Yosemlte missed her
by a few hours. The Purisima Concep
cion carried, In addition to provisions,
arms and ammunition. These cargoes
were undoubtedly smuggled Into the
Spanish line and will aid Captain-Gen
eral Blanco greatly in withstanding the
siege. .
The admiral has now decided that
the blockade running must cease, and
yesterday he dispatched four fast ships
to patrol the coast from Cape Cruz to
the Isle of Pines.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JDNE 24, 1898.
IN DEFENSE OF HOBSON.
Yellow Examiner Journalism Insults the Brave
Prisoner Whom the People Honor.
To Its habit of printing bogus "news," heretofore mentioned, the Examiner has added the offense of insult-
Ing its readers and the crime of being imbecile. From long practice It is able at times to so present a fake that
it Beems plausible, and one not familiar with the character of the sheet may accept as truth that which is not
only not true, but intended to deceive. Yesterday the Examiner outdid Itself. It printed a story so outrageous and
palpably false that it could mislead no one, and which was a reflection upon the intelligence of the public, an indi
cation of its own denseness and a scurrilous gibe for the hero of the Merrimac, a man whom the world honors.
The matter in question purported to be a letter from Lieutenant Hobson to the lady he expects to marry. It
was not a letter from the lieutenant or any other gentleman. It was a crude and boorish effort such as an un
scrupulous correspondent might send, but how it got past the editorial desk must ever remain a mystery. It
was badly constructed, full of cheap bombast, silly and inane. The person who composed it lacked brains, char
acter, common sense, ordinary decency and a knowledge of grammar. A schoolboy could have done better as a
mere feat of composition, not necessarily a bright schoolboy either.
Think of the gallant Hobson sitting in Morro scribbling of "our bravery." Imagine him penning a message
setting forth his "daring," praising his deed, and at the same time affecting a mock modesty more disgusting
than an open boast. Had Hobson ever written such a fool letter he would be no longer regarded as a hero. His
pen would have pried him from the pedestal.
Aside from the "letter" there are some surrounding circumstances which tend to emphasize the ricldulous
ness of the Examiner's attempted swindle. It is hardly to be thought that a young lady receiving a note
from her affianced would immediately put it on display. No such note could have left Morro. If Hobson
could communicate with anybody he would manage to get some word to the commander of the fleet. If he
had anything to say it would at least possess the element of importance, and there would be some news in it.^
The trick writer makes Hobson discuss the reports of the explosion as published by the American pa
pers. Now the individual who thinks the American paper circulates in Morro is so nearly an idiot that he might
as well be an absolute one, and stop thinking altogether. Even the Examiner would not soberly set up a
claim to circulating there, unless in its wee, collective mind there Is confusion as to the identity of the place.
Possibly it believes Morro and the garbage crematory to be the same.
For the purpose of so discrediting the fake that the faker would be unable to defend it, or to make ex
cuses, The Call sent to an editor at Little Rock, whence the letter was alleged to have escaped, and asked as to
its authenticity. A reply was promptly received and is presented herewith.
An analysis of the fictitious Hobson message would be waste of space. One may perceive at a glance that
the originator of it simply strung together a collection of incidents with which everybody is familiar and
palmed them off as having been compiled by the prisoner. Had not the pretense been detected at once this
would have put Hobson in the position of being an uncultured ass. As it was. It merely draws attention to
the fact that the correspondent is in this position and that he has the directors-general of yellow journalism
to bear him company.
That such a correspondent Is a disgrace to the profession about the edge of which he glides like a hyena in
quest of scraps needs no saying. He deserves to be in jail as an impostor. He If a knave so scurvy that
any honest citizen would deem the task of kicking him a plain and pleasant duty. But he may have felt the
impulse of hunger with no chance to pick a pocket. However, for the editors who helped him to carry out the
game there is no shadow of mitigation. From every point of view the publication of that 'Tetter" was an nut
rage, a gross affront to all under whose eye it fell, a slander directed against Hobson. But yellow journalism
is growing bolder. Once it tried to disguise its falsehoods; now it seems to glory in their being falsehoods.
HOBSON'S ALLEGED LETTER A BARE-FACED FAKE.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 2u.â The sensational story sent broadcast last night by an irresponsible
newspaper correspondent of this city to New York, Chicago, Cincinnati, San Francisco and numerous papers
of an alleged letter supposed to have been received by Miss Ella Ellston, a cousin of Lieutenant Hobson, who
has been confined in 'Morro Castle at Santiago since June 2, is a cold-blooded fake. The story is absolutely
without foundation. The closest Investigation proves that there is not a family in the city who ever heard of
Ella Ellston.
The correspondent who sent the story discussed with a quondam friend the best way out of his sore
financial straits. The latter jokingly suggested that Lieutenant Hobson, the center of attraction throughout
the nation, might have a Little Rook connection who might be made a source of revenue to one in his fix. The
story was thereupon concocted and sent out. All the local press will appear in the strongest denunciation of
the fake.

The Spanish soldiers known as the |
regular troops are on half rations, and
no rations or supplies are furnished to
the local Spanish forces, numbering
about 3000 men. They are compelled to j
forage for themselves. The spirit of
discontent, it also seems, Is very wide- j

STRIKES A
BATTLESHIP
Kills an Apprentice and
Wounds Six Others or)
the Texas.
But the Big Vessel Soon Succeeds
in Silencing the Socap a
Battery.
ON BOARD THE HER
ALD-CALL DIS P A TCH
BOAT OFF SANTIAGO. 6 p.
m. Wednesday, via Kingston,
Jamaica, June 23. â General Shaf
ter to-day had the Cubans make
a demonstration against Mata
moras and the western outposts
with the idea of drawing out the
Spaniards in force. While the
demonstration failed to accom
plish what General Shafter de
sired, it resulted in a fine piece of
work by the Texas.
The Texas, unaided, silenced
and apparently destroyed a bat
tery which all the ships in Com
modore Schley's division of the
fleet had twice fiercely bombard
ed without result. Steaming in
so close that she almost touched
the shore, the battleship took
Socapa battery on the flank,
pouring into it 135 six-inch and
twelve-inch shells. The Spanish
forces that had been driven from
Matamoras field batteries now
fled from Socapa.
Officers of the Vesuvius, which
lay opposite the Texas' target,
say the marksmanship of the bat
hip's gunners was the finest
of the war. Admiral Sampson
Vv.as delighted with the work
when Captain Philip told him:
"We have destroyed them."
The Texas was struck by sev
eral Spanish shells, but sustained
little damage.
The Texns waa struck by a single
shell which killed one man and wound
ed six ..thprs.
Killed: F. R. Blakeley, apprentice,
first class, of Newport.
Wounded: R. Russell, apprentice,
Philadelphia; W. J. Siinonson, sea
man. New York; H. A. Gee, appren
tice, Philadelphia; J. E. Lively,
landsman, Norfolk, Va.; G. F. Mul
len, apprentice. New York; A. Soog
vist, seaman, New York.
Russell is very seriously wounded.
The others will recover.
The shot which struck the Texas was
about the last fired before the Span
lards abandoned the battery under the
heavy accurate fire of the Texas. This
Fh>>ll entered the battleship twenty feet
abaft the st'-m at a point on the out
side about three feet below the main
deck line. It cut a jagged round hole
from the measurements of which it is
deduced th-- siz.' of the projectile was
six and one-half Inches.
Oddly enough, after striking the first
obstruction it failed to explode, pass
ing through the hawser reel and then
rutting in two the heavy iron stanch
ion in the center line of the berth deck.

li re the explosion occurred. Standing
around at quarters, but not in action,
were the crews of two 6-pounders lo
cated in the forward compartment of
the berth deck.
Blakeley stood by the chain stopper
about two feet distant. He was torn to
pieces. Pieces of shell flew in all direc
tions, wounding the others. A part of
the shell struck the starboard plates,
causiiiK a trilling bulge outward. The
compartment was filled with smoke,
and the fire hose was ordered into use
to extinguish the flames.
Other shells exploded near the Texas.
Ensign Anderson, second in command
of the port turret, says a shell exploded
ten yards away on the water, filling the
turret with smoke.
The firing on board the Texas was
confined to the port battery. Captain
Phillips spoke highly of all his men and
officers. The best hits were scored by
Li< utenant Bristol, In charge of the
port turret.
The death of Blakeley cast gloom
over the crew. For the first time dur
ing the war they witnessed the impres
sive ceremonies of a burial at sea. The
Texas steamed out to sea and buried
Blakeley, returning to her post on the
blockade at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
SENDS TERROR INTO
A SPANISH CAMP
Vesuvius Throws a Dynamite Shell
Which Makes a Magnifi
cent Hit.
ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL
DISPATCH BOAT, OFF- SANTIAGO,
via Port Antonio, Jamaica, June 23.â
Last night at 10 o'clock the Vesuvius
glided through the darkness to a po
sition 500 yards from the batteries east
of Morro. The first shell exploded
made a great hit. It was magnificent
and imposing and must have terrorized
the Spanish camp. The shell struck
squarely in front of the sand batteries,
knocking down great masses of debris,
stone and other objects, which, flying
in the air, were plainly discernible from
the fleet through the aid of glasses.
For more than 250 yards there seemed
to be a lake erf flames.
For one hour a cloud hung over
Morro. A gunboat threw a searchlight
on the scene. Strangely enough Morro
did not show a sign of activity but
several shells came whistling from
other batteries. The .officers are elated
over the success of the Vesuvius.

INCREASING
HER FORCE
England Sends More
Ships to Manila.
INTERFERENCE SCOFFED AT BY
OUR AUTHORITIES.
WASHINGTON, June 23. â To
night's press dispatches announce that
Great Britain's three warships in Ma
nila harbor will be augmented by two
more from the Asiatic station. This
creates the impression that Germany
may really intend to interfere. But
officers of the administration place no
credence in the report that Germany
has landed a naval force at Manila.
The report is believed to be inspired
by Spanish allies for the purpose of
precipitating trouble between the
United States and Germany.
Secretary Day is confident that Ger
many has no ulterior motive in Its na-
val movements at Manila and that
Admiral Dewey will execute his in
structions without having any compli
cations with Germany or any other
foreign power.
A member of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee said to-day: "I am
very sure that the story is not true,
and I am equally positive that if Ger
many or any other country is landing
troops or in any other way attempting
to interfere with the American occu
pation of the Philippines she is making
a grave mistake for herself.
"It is unquestionably proper under
ordinary circumstances for neutral
governments to land marines in the
territory of belligerents where its own
citizens may be in danger. America
has done so frequently. On many oc
casions in Central and South America,
when rebellions and interstate wars
were in progress, we have landed ma
rines to protect our citizens. Ameri
can marines were landed, too, at Al
exandria during the British bombard
ment. The practice has become al
most a custom with this country.
"The situation in Manila is different
in every essential particular. The land
ing of troops by any European nation
at Manila at this time would have sig
nificance beyond that erf the act itself.
"Even were it done simply to pro
tect neutrals there must be a sugges
tion of intention to intervene.
"In addition to this there is no neces
sity for the move. The United States
forces at Manila are capable, abun
dantly, of protecting all neutral citi
zens and property. The insurgents
have shown no disposition to break the
rules of civilized warfare or commit ex
cessses.
"The United States would resent any
such move. There would be active re
sentment by force of arms if any such
landing were in the least to assume the
aspect of interference."
LONDON, June 24.-â The .Washing
ton correspondent of the Daily Chron
icle says:
"Dr. yon Holleben, the German Em
bassador to the United States, has ar
ranged for the landing of German ma
rines at Manila to protect the German
consulate, if necessary, with American
permission."
Bead what Russell Sage has to say
on "War as an Investment," in next
Sunday's CalL
ceived reliable information that
this so-called reserve squadron
would be kept in home waters to
defend Spain's coast cities.
ADMITTED BY SAGASTA-
LONDON, June 24.â A dis
patch from Madrid says that Sa
gasta informed the Chamber yes
terday that Camara's squadron is
now on the way to the Philip
pines.
DEWEY IS IN NO DANGER
NEW YORK, June 23.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Should it prove true that Camara's
squadron is really proceeding to the
Philippines It can be stated authorita
tively the formation of a flying squad
ron will take place at once and will be
sent to Spanish home waters with all
possible dispatch. This action will be
necessary in order to compel Spain to
recall her fleet. Even should it fail
to accomplish its object the officials
say that a demonstration on the Span
ish coast would have a great effect on
the people of Spain and be conducive
to peace. No anxiety is felt concern
ing the safety of Admiral Dewey.
The Monterey and Charleston will
reach Manila several days .before Ca
mara's squadron can arrive at that
point. Manila will be in the possession
of the American troops, the harbor will
be mined and the fortifications be well
manned by expert American artillery
men. There is no fear expressed as
to the outconpe of a battle between Rear
Admiral Dewey's and Admiral Ca
mara's squadrons.
MISS MEETING
AT SAN JOSE
Strong Protest of High
School Students.
RESOLUTIONS REQUESTING HIS
REINSTATEMENT.
SAN JOSE, June 23.â A mass-meeting
at Turn Verein Hall this evening under
the auspices of the students of the
High School, to protest agafnst the dis
missal of Professor Leigh R. Smith, as
vice-principal of that school, filled the
place with one of the most select au
diences ever assembled in the city.
Many people were unable to gain ad
mittance.
Upon the stage were seated a num
ber of prominent business men. Henry
French was made chairman, and spoke
a few words of praise for our public
schools. He stated the purpose of the
meeting.
Rev. N. H. Haskell of the Unitarian
church made some plain statements
about remedying our public school sys
tem, and denounced the dismissal of
Professor Smith. His remarks were
followed by applause and cheering,
during which the students gave a high
school yell.
Professor Miller of Stanford Univer
sity spoke In behalf of Professor Smith.
He stated that Professor Smith's work
was accredited at Stanford, and that
his students were the only ones that
were accepted on recommendation. He
said San Jose High School students led
all others in Latin, and pupils from this
school were always at the head of the
class. He said Professor Smith was
considered one of the best Latin teach
ers on the coast. He was glad the
students were making this move to se
cure the reinstatement of their teacher,
Attorney S. G. Tcrmpkins followed
and indorsed the uprising in favor of
Professor Smith.
F. M. KeesHng of the High School
alumni said Professor Smith's removal
was to make room for a certain young
lady with a political pull, who was
about lo graduate at the Normal
School.
The following resolutions were adopt
ed by a stai ding vote, every one rising
but the faculty of the High School:
Whereas, At a recent meeting of the
Board of Education of the city of Saii
Jose, said board did, without just and
sufficient cause, retire from the faculty
of the High School Professor L. R.
Smith, one of the most competent and
useful teachers in our public schools
therefore, be It
Resolved, That we, taxpayers, voters,
fathers and mothers, who have our sons
anu uaughters in the High School, in
mass-meeting assembled, do declare our
most earnest and solemn protest against
the action of said Board of Education,
believing it to be unwarranted, unjust
and unwise and against t.ie best inter
ests and success of the High School. We
therefore request said Boaru of educa
tion to reinstate Professor Smith to the
position from which they retired him.
After the meeting about 300 students
marched in a body to Professor Smith's
residerce and serenaded him. Sevenl
speeches were made by the students
and great enthusiasm prevailed.

RAIDING A DEN
OF GAMBLERS
Arrest of Pool-Sellers at
Sausalito.
HARVEY AND HARRISON ARE
NOT MOLESTED.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, June 23.âSimultane
ously with the opening of Harrison's
and Harvey's poolrooms to-day the es
tablishment of Broyer, Glynn, Hum
phrey et al. threw open its doors for
business in accordance with their reg
ular campaign plan. In about fifteen
minutes Marshal Hannon and his
squad of deputies swooped down upon
the rival gambling den.
Five arrests were made, namely: W.
J. Barnett, Ray Falk, James Smith, "W.
Humphrey and John Schulz. They
were taken before Recorder Simpton
and released on their own recognizance.
Deputy Marshal Johnson was placed
in the doorway of the raided rooms
and given four deputies to assist htm
in preventing a crowd from congregat
ing inside. Gamesters were permitted
to enter in single file all day long,
each man being warned as he entered
that he was liable to arrest.
The attorneys of the rival factions
tried to induce Justice Bellrude to is
sue warrantÃ for the arrest of Harri
son and Harvey, on the ground that
they were violating an unrepealed or
dlnance preventing the selling of pools
on races. The Justice refused to issue
the warrants on the ground that he
had no jurisdiction in the matter. Then
an appeal was made to Recorder Simp
ton, who also entered a refusal and
backed his position up by reference to
a decision rendered by the Supreme
Court.
To-morrow all the cases of those ar
rested will come up to have a date set
for trial.
The rival pool men have threatened
to bring a crowd of "heelers" to town
to see that their doors are kept cleared,
so the officials assert. The latter state
that any such action will result in a
"hot time" for Sausalito. The excite
ment Is at fever heat and any kind of
a move would not be unexpected.
RAILROAD FARES REDUCED.
The Southern Pacific announced yes
terday its Intention to reduce the pas
senger rate to Los Angeles. Instead of
a charge of $15 for a ticket from San
Francisco to Los Angeles the fare will be
$13 35 after July 1. This reduction ap
plies only to limited tickets with no stop
over privileges. The six months' tick
ets will not be reduced.
The Valley road has been instrumental
In forcing the Southern Pacific to make
this reduction. In order to meet the rate
set by the Valley road to Bakersfield
the Southern Pacific was forced to re
duce the fare from San Francisco to Ba
kersfield from $9 10 to $6 90. The fare
from Bakersfield to Los Angeles on the
Southern Pacific line is $6 45, thus mak
ing the complete fare to Los Angeles
$13 35, $1 65 less than a through ticket to
Los Angeles. The fares will in future be
the same.

PLENTY OF
EXPERIENCE
BUT NO GOLD
Sad Stories Told by Those
Back From the Copper
River Country.
Hundreds Who Have Succeeded
in Reaching the "Diggings"
Cannot Return.
JUNEAU, Alaska, June 17 (by steam
ship to Seattle), June 23.â Sixty-one pil
grims, foot sore, sunburned and weary,
arrived here to-night from a futile
search for the golden fleece. They look
more tanned and tough than the men
who came up the Yukon River in the
dead of winter. They came from Val
dez and the Copper River country and
are going home "no more to roam."
' They have had enough and to spare.
The steamer Wilcott, which was char
tered by the party, brought them down
from Valdez, Copper City and Orca at
an average expense of $13 each. Some
have no more money, and must try to
find work here before they can go a
mile farther toward home. Accord
ing to the stories told, the Valdez
glacier, which must be scaled and
crossed before getting into the Copper
River Valley, is about the toughest
stretch of scrambling that can be found
in Alaska to pack outfits over. The
Chilcoot summit is about as green and
inviting as the Berkeley campus as
compared with it. Several men, names
not preserved, never got over, for the
reason that they slid down into awful
crevasses, black and bottomless. There
were snowslides, too, in the spring,
from which many were rescued, but
not all, and again names are missing.
E. W. Hoag, who published a newspa
per fourteen years at Poplar Bluff,
Missouri, near St. Louis, one of the
energetic men of the party, said:
"We are coming back because we got
tired, sick and disgusted. We were de
ceived, and I hope the truth will be
told. Thirty of us who went up on
the steamer Albion last spring were
told at Portland that we could get over
the glacier in two days and that it was
easy work. It is high time the news
papers were given the facts about that
country, so that they can be published.
If there is any tougher territory on the
face of the earth than you meet trying
to get to and up the Copper River I
would like to see it through the Lick
telescope. It took a large party of
men eight weeks to get a thousand
pounds of outfit fifty miles; everything
must be packed over the glacier. Sleds
cannot be used.
"About 2500 men succeeded in getting
over the glacier and into the Copper
River valley. Some of the cracks in the
glacier are frightful â enough to turn a
man's hair white to give them a pass
ing glance. E There has been some sick
ness and a few deaths from over exer
tion and exposure. Nearly every man
was rescued from the snow slides so
far as known, but it is really impossi
ble to tell how many were caught in
the snow. The current of Copper River
is swifter than a mill race. It runs
from ten to fifteen miles an hour. One
hundred and seventy-five miles is the
farthest any man got up the river.
This party finally lost their outfits and
returned nearly starved. Ido not think
a color of gold was found. There were
reports that colors had been discovered,
but nobody was able to find the man
â who made the discovery. It is a
marshy country on each side of the
river for miles and miles. Outfits can
not be sold.* They are not worth any
thing. Many men have lost their out
fits, are dead broke and stuck at Val
dez unable to get home.:. The great
majority of the three or four thousand
men who have gone to Copper River
are doing nothing now and don't know
what they are going to do. Hundreds
â will not get back this season and must
camp in this country through the win
ter. Many finding no gold on Copper
River will prospect the tributary
streams, and others will try to work
their way up the river and over the
divide to the head waters of the Tanana
and into the Yukon country. -. The boats
taken in are not suitable for navigat
ing the swift current of the upper river.
You have to wade through a marshy
country up to the knees or hips before
reaching the Copper River.", .
"Is there any copper in the country?"
"No doubt about that." Mr. Hoag
exhibited a piece of very heavy copper
ore which might also carry some gold.
He said but few Indians are met with
on the river and they are friendly.
â¢ Since so many lives have been lost In
White Horse Rapids and in the par
ticularly swift places of the Lewis
River before those rapids are reached
the Canadian police have Interested
themselves to minimize the dangers. It
is estimated that about forty persons
have been" drowned in the rapids' and
not less than sixty boats wrecked and
outfits , lost. Narrow escapes from
death are even more numerous. ; The
one corpse that was taken to Seattle
a few days ago on the steamer Discov
ery Is the second body that has been;
recovered. When once a man goes
down in White Horse Rapids his body
seldom comes to the surface. i The po
lice have taken a hand in . the super
vision of boats constructed all along the
river from the head of Lake Linder
mann to the foot of Lake : Marsh.
Many have tried to build boats with
as much success as if they had at
tempted to construct an auxiliary
cruiser for service off the coast of
Cuba. All shapes, kinds and conditions
of "things" have been produced with
the whlpsaw and hammer. Some of
them hardly possess the common merit
of wood on the waterâ the capacity to
float. They are the craziest, crankiest
things imaginable. Many have per
pendicular sides and are shaped like
ceffins. Others are modeled on the
casket style. Some are mere cata
maran, and it is an exception when
one of them rests steadily and >: well
balanced in the water even when load
ed. Klondikers by the score load these
unstable, craft to the gunwales, - and
climbing on top of the cargo of beans,
bacon, baking, powder, sugar and flour,
start down, toward the land of gold, ex
pecting to shoot In safety the White
Horse Rapids,, where the water runs so
swiftly in the tortuous channel that its
surface Is convex, six Inches: higher in
the middle than on the sides, a ; boil-
Ing, roaring, tumbling â  mass. The po
lice will now not allow any ; more of
these : kinds of : boats to put . out ; : from
*horÂ»^ A catamaran Is safer.
The " reported discovery of cround
near Lake Teslin which ; went â : $300 to
the pan is denied by parties who have
recently ? arrived 1 - here from 5 ; that " lake
by way of Takou trail, which is sixty
miles from tidewater to the lake, while
the V/rangel and Stickeen route is 160
miles. Gravel going a few cents to the
pan has been discovered.
RUSSIA'S EMBASSADOR
FORMALLY PRESENTED
Makes a Neat Speech in an Exceed
ingly Friendly and Cor
dial Tone.
WASHINGTON, Juno 23.â Russia's first
Embassador to the United States, Count
de Cassini, was formally presented to the

He laid special stress and emphasis upon
this part of his address. Altogether, the
speech was exceedingly friendly and cor
dial in tone, and did not contain a sen
tence not in entire accord with a feeling
of perfect good will and friendship. The
President's reply was in the same amica
ble vein.

RECIPROCITY WITH FRANCE.
Ruling Upon tha New Treaty Made
by Assistant Secretary Howell.
WASHINGTON. June 23.â Assistant
Secretary Howell has decided that sec
tion 3 of the act of July 24, 1897, under
which the wine clause of the present
reciprocity treaty with France was r.a
g-otiated, imposes a uniform rate of 3j
cents per gallon on all still wines in
casks containing 24 per cent or less of
alcohol, and that no imitations or com
pounds of such wines and no genuine
wines, not the product of France, are
entitled to the benefits of the treaty.
It is further held that section 3, re
ferred to, does not interfere with the
provisions of paragraph 296 of the tariff
act, which provides that any wines Im
ported containing more than 24 per cent
of alcohol shall be classed as spirits and
pay duty accordingly. This ruling waa
called forth in answer to inquiries from
certain wine dealers in California,

If you are weak get strength. If you are puny become manly.
Why not? Do you begin to believe that you cannot be helped? If
so you are WRONG. "Hudyan" has saved â absolutely SAVED â
over 20,000 men. Are you content to think you are the weakest man
EVER bom? "Hudyan" will make you a big, strong and a healthy
man again if you will give it the opportunity. Circulars and testimonials
about it are free. " Hudyan " not only produces sweet, refreshing sleep,
but it stops the cause of the disease in a week. Manliness and man-
hood are yours if you will have them. You may be afraid that you have
abused your big powers instead of using them sensibly. Perhaps you
have. But "Hudyan" makes up for waste. All organs of the body are
restored to good condition by it.

Â©{ INDUSTRIES [A YEAR.ORDER TO BREAK CAMP
IS HOURLY EXPECTED
IMPORTANT messages by wire were
exchanged between the War De
partment and the headquarters of
the Eighth Army Corps yesterday.
The telegrams related to the prep
arations for the sailing of the third ex
pedition of the forces destined for the
Philippine Islands.
Major General Merritt's purpose to
sail on the Newport had not been
changed up to a late hour last night,
but there was talk during the day at
headquarters that he had a mind to
select quarters for the voyage on the
Indiana. It is acknowledged all around
that the Newport is a faster boat than
the Indiana and would be able to leave
San Francisco two days after the main
body of the expedition sailed and over
take the fleet before it reached Hono
lulu. What happened to cause the
general commotion about the proposed
change of ships is not known to out
siders, but whatever it was induced
General Merritt to make a personal in
spection of both vessels during the
forenoon and repeat the survey during
the afternoon. When he got back to
the Palace- Hotel in the evening he was
quite weary of ship-seeing.
Unless the plans officially announced
are modified or revised to-day a fleet
of five ships will Fail from this habor
for Manila via Honolulu next Monday.
The extra room allowed by the engage
ment of the Newport will be filled, as
The Call stated yesterday, by batter
ies of the Third United States Artil
lery and the Astor Light Battery.
To-day Major General Merrltt will
issue his official order, assuming com
mand of the newly created Eighth
Army Corps. The order will designate
the troops comprising the command
and will also announce the name and
rank respectively of the staff officers
assigned to the corps.
The present assignment of troops to
compose the various brigades and di
visions of the corps is only temporary
and will be revised when all the forces
reach Manila. The troops remaining
In Sari Francisco when the third expe
dition sails will surely constitute one
division of the corps under the com
mand of Major General Otis.
T'lmn assuming the office of Gover
nor General of the Philippines, admin
istrative functions will engage the at
tention of General Merritt and doubt
less then he will assign the command
of the corps to another officer.
WILL CO INTO CAMP
ON TUESDAY NEXT
The Eighth Regiment of California
Volunteers to Assemble
by Battalions.
Next Tuesday the companies desig
nated to form the Eighth Regiment,
California Volunteers, will begin to
rendezvous on the slope of the Pied
mont hills, juÂ«t out of Oakland. It
was at first expected that the assem
would take place to-morrow or
Sunday, but ft has been found impos
sible to finish the preliminary medical
inspections of the men at their home
stations before Monday, so the
movement of the troops has been de
ferred until Tuesday.
The entire command will not be or
dered to move simultaneously, but four
companies will be brought in at a time
and mustered in by battalions. The
first to go into camp will be four com
panies of the Fifth Infantry, B of San
Jose, E of Santa Rosa, F of Oakland
and G of Alameda. These constitute
the First Battalion.
The companies that will comprise the
Second Battalion will be ordered to
move Wednesday. They have not yet
been selected, but will undobutedly be
the companies from San Rafael, Peta
luma. Woodland and Marysville, leav
ing the Chico, Grass Valley, Colusa and
Redding companies for the Fourth Bat
talion, which will move to the rendez
vous next Thursday.
Colonel Park Henshaw returned to
Chico last evening, leaving the selec
tion of the camp ground to Lieutenant
Colonel Carrington. That officer -has
been made familiar with the results of
the inspection of the proposed sites by
Colonel Henshaw, Captain Murray and
Captain Baldwin, but, accompanied by
Lieutenant Heller, the quartermaster
will visit the various localities him
self to-day.
one! (nrrington has in mind a de
lightful spot near Fruitvale, but he
said yesterday that in view of the ex
cellent sanitary conditions of the
Pierce tract on Piedmont avenue, and
its proximity to the baths, he would, in
all probability, fix the location there.
All the baggage brought by the com
pantea will be unloaded at the Slx
f' â¢ nth strr-et station, Oakland, which is
not more than two miles from the camp
Bite.
Colonel f'arrinprton is most enthus
iastic over the new regiment. During
his long Bervlce as inspector of the Na
tional Guard of California Colonel Car-
Fington has become thoroughly famil
iar with every company In the State,
and he siys thai n<> better material for
Meal soldiers could be found anywhere
than in the ranks of the picked com
panies of the KiKhth Regiment. This
command, he says, would have one
great advantage over the First, Sixth
and Seventh, in that ample time will
be given it to be thoroughly equipped,
while the others were rushed into ac
tive service as soon as the men could
be <x:> mined and mustered in.
When the Eighth is turned over to
General Otia it will be provided with
everything essential to a soldier's kit.
and if necessary can march on board
a transport from the Oakland rendez
vous. Xo raiment that has reported
so far has gone into camp in as good
condition as- the Eighth will go.
Governor Budd made the formal an
nouncement yesterday of the selection
of Lieutenant Heller as quartermaster
of the Eighth. The appointment was
exclusively forecasted in yesterday's
Call, as was that of Dr. J. C. Yost, who
will be assistant surgeon of the new
regiment.
AMBITIOUS RECRUITS.
The Detachment for the First
to Go Into Camp To-Day
Fully Equipped.
Colonel Carrington has finished his
work of mustering the recruits for the
First California Volunteers, and this
morning they will march out of the Page
street Armory for Camp Merritt, equipped
in every detail. Colonel Carrington has
taken great pair.s with this detachment,
and every man is provided with tiie ne
cessary underwear, blankets, knapsacks,
haversacks, canteen, mess kit and rifle,
the colonel having drawn new ordnance
to arm them all.
His efforts have been most ably sec
onded by the officers detailed from the
Seventh ' California, who in throe days'
time have taken these raw recruits and
worked them into such shape that they
march like veterans and are already
finite proficient in the manual. The men
are anxious to learn their duties, as they
appreciate the fact that there will be lit-

tie or no opportunity for instruction afer
they Bail for the Philippines, and have ac
tually called for more work when their
officers thought they had enough. Their
great ambition is to show Colonel Smith,
when they Join their re^injent. that they
are more proficient in drill than many of
the men who went out with him.
Lieutenant Rumbough ol the Third Ar
tillery will begin the mustering in of the
new company of engineers this morning,
and has selected the Page street Armory
for the purpose. The men will be quar
tered there until they are equipped and
ready to go into camp. Lieutenant Kum
bouffh was engaged yesterday in making
requisitions for his quartermaster
stores and ordnance, which will be deliv
ered at the armory by to-morrow.
There arrived yesterday 558 recruits for
different commands at Camp Merritt, as
follows: Two hundred and one for the
First Colorado, 2GO for the Seventh Cali
fornia. 42 for the Second Oregon, 20 for
the signal corps, 35 electricians and tele
graph operators for the engineers and 11
from Ohio for the Fourteenth United
States Infantry. They came in detach
ments at different times and were enter
tained in the usual hospitable manner by
the Red Cross Society at the ferry depot.
They started out to Camp Merritt with
full "stomachs and light hearts, and with
repeated cheers for the ladies.
TWO GALLANT OFFICERS.
A Change May Be Made in the
Command of the Regular
Artillery Battalion.
Among the army officers that called
at the headquarters of the Eighth
Army Corps yesterday to pay their re
spects to the commanding officer, Ma
jor General Merrltt, was Major Wil
liam A. Kobbe, Third United States
Artillery, from Fort Canby, Washing
ton. It is said that the major will
go to Manila next week as the com
j mander of the Third Artillery Battal
ion.
Surprise was manifested in army cir
cles yesterday when it was whispered
that the gallant Major Hess, Third
United States Artillery, now in com
mand of the artillery camp at the Pre
sidio, had been ordered to appear be
fore a retiring board. It had been ac
cepted as a fact up to last evening that
Major Hess would go to the Orient
with the artillery, and it is not abso
lutely certain yet that the assignment
will be changed. The service may de
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, JUNE 24, 1898.
mand the presence of both majors.
Under the law Major Hess will retire
in 1900, but Major Kobbe's retiring year
is 1904. Each officer has a gallant re
cord of distinguished service in the
War of the Rebellion.
Major Hess participated in the great
battles in which the Army of the Po
tomac was engaged and was brevetted
for gallant and meritorious conduct in
the battles of Gettysbury, Pennsylva
nia, and Kelly's Ford, Virginia. He
was in the front at Malvern Hill,
Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg
and Appomattox.
Major Kobbe was promoted for faith
ful and distinguished service through
out the war. He won a brevet for
gallant conduct at the battle of Nash
ville and was also brevetted for gal
lantry in the storming and capture of
Fort Blakely, Alabama.
MOSBY'S COMMAND.
The Noted Confederate Raider
Will Lead a Company
of Cavalry.
Colonel John S. Mosby, the famous Con
federate raider of the Civil War, may yet
have an opportunity to show his devotion
to the stars and stripes. The man who
telegraphed General Miles some months
ago that "he had no influence but only
a military record" when told to get the
assistance of the Senators from his
State when he volunteered his services at
the outbreak of the war, is determined to
show that he is still capable of leading a
charge. As captain of the Light Cavalry
Troop that is daily drilling in Kohler's
Hall In Oakland, the old soldier is instill
ing the same vim that he showed when at
the head of his "Raiders."
. It is the Intention of, the company to re
cruit to the limit and present Its services
to the Government fully equipped and
ready to proceed to the front. In this the
members have the support of leading cit
izens of Oakland and this city. The com
pany is composed of men who are expert
with the rifle and on horseback, and
many have had experience as cavalry
men in Uncle Sam's service. â 
The men who are learning the first rudi
ments of cavalry drill are members of the
best families in the Athenian City. Colo
nel Mosby's first lieutenant is Paul S.
Luttrell, a son of the ' ex-Congressman.
W. J. Tormey, the second lieutenant," has
been in the cavalry service five years,
during which time he has been in two en
gagements. At Wounded, Knee he suf
fered a wound, and in another outbreak
tie was struck again.
Under the able drilling of their officers
the men .â . are being rapidly "licked"
into shape and will soon be able to offer
their services. They appreciate the fact
that so far the cavalry has not been
called into the field, but they hope to :be
chosen, as they will be able to offer a
fully equipped company. '
READY TO BREAK CAMP.
Baggage, Ammunition and
Supplies Going Aboard
the Transports.
Up to a late hour last night there
were no orders issued from division
headquarters by Ma.ior General Otis rela
tive to the day of departure of the next
expedition or the assignment of troops
to the transport Newport. There is hard
ly any possibility of the troops getting
aboard before Sunday. None of the offi
cers at Camp Merritt seem to know the
exact cause of the delay, but the general
opinion is that it is attributable to some
hitch in getting ready the vessels that are
to transport the troops. Yesterday those
forces that are to go upon the next ex
pedition were busy hauling their camp
baggage, ammunition and supplies to the
wharves to be loaded aboard the vessels,
so that from this fact it would seem that
the breaking of camp to-morrow may not
be as improbable as most of the officers
seem to think it is.
The forces at Camp Merritt were aug
mented yesterday by the arrival of a
large number of recruits. Lieutenant
Colonel Schrieber of the Seventh Califor
nia arrived from the southern part of the
State with 260 picked men. The recruits
were met at the ferry by the officers and
the band of the regiment and escorted to
camp. Lieutenant Biddle of the First
Colorado brought in 102 recruits. These
men will in all probability be sent to join
their regiment when the fourth expedi
tion sails.
A genera! court-mnrtlal was in session
at the Third Brigade Headquarters yes
terday morning: for the purpose of trying
a number of potty oases that came' be
fore it. Lieutenant J. D. Fredericks of the
Seventh' California was the judge advo
cate of the court, which consisted of 14
commissioned officers from the Third
Brigade.
The recruits of the Utah troop of cav
alry were examined yesterday by Major
Choate of the Seventh California, pre
paratory to being mustered into the serv
ice.
Colonel Berry and staff. Seventh Cali
fornia, were entertained at the Cliff
House on Wednesday night by Colonel
Smith and staff. First Tennessee. Gover
nor Richards of Wyoming: and Major
Foote and officers of the Wyoming Bat
talion were entertained on Wednesday
night by Pr. Magnus, the United State's
examining surgeon, at his residence on
Haye 1 * street.
Lieutenant J. J. Bradley, Fourteenth
United States Tnfantry, who has been on
detached service in Alaska, rejoined his
regiment yesterday and reported to Ma
jor Robe." He was assigned to the com
mand of Company M.
Tn the afternoon the troop had a hot
skirmish drill on the Presidio hills. The
cracking of their big Cnlt revolvers lent
a realism to the practice that was in
spiring.
The recruits of th^ Klghteenth Tnfan
try and the Astor Battery will be paid off
to-day by Paymaster Rochester.
On Tuesday evening Colonel C. McC.
Reeve of the Thirteenth Minnesota was
presented with a hnnrtsomp gold-mount
ed sword, a gift of the officers of his
regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Ames de
livered a very happy presentation speech.
An order has be^n issued from division
headquarters assigning all recruits on
the waiting list to the Second Brigade,
under Brigadier General King.
WILL MAN THE SCOUTS.
Naval Reserve Officers to Com-
mand the Coast Mos
quito Fleet.
The tugs purohaspd by the Government
are to go Into commission at once, and
will be manned by the Naval Reserve.
Over 100 nf the boy? have been sworn In,
and to-day they will go to Mare Island
to join their ships. When the officers of
the reserve went up for examination they
were given a strict examination, and
in consequence very few of them re-
ceived commissions, and those few prin
cipally because they were old and ex
perienced navigators. The boys, how
ever, were not out for commissions,
neither were they out for pay â all they
wanted was a chance to serve Uncle
Sam. Accordingly, the following have
been appointed masters' mates, and will
probably be assigned to the Iroquois,
Vigilant and Active: W. F. Burke, J. M.
Squier, \V. G. Morrison, G. E. Kam
merer, J. J. Delaney and A. H. Elliott.
Louis H. Turner and W. E. Gunn secured
commissions as lieutenants, and T. M.
Shaw and A. K. Morgan were made en
signs. T'nder present plans Turner will
command the Iroquois, Gunn the Vigi
lant and Shaw the Active.
With all the men shp can get from the
Naval Reserve, the Philadelphia is still
short handed. In ord^r to complete her
complement she requires forty seamen,
thirty ordinary seamen, three carpen
ters' mates, four chief machinists, four
first-class machinists, .four oilers and
three water tenders. As soon as these
men have been secured the vessel will
sail for Manila to join Admiral Dewev's
fleet.
COLONEL FAIRBANKS
DID NOT RESIGN
Proud of the Fifth California Regi-
ment and Glad to Be Its
Leader.
PETALUMA. June 23.â Colonel Fair
banks was seen at his summer residence,
the Lakeville Club, eight miles below
Petaluma, this evening by a Call reporter,
and when asked if he had resigned the
colonelcy of the Fifth Infantry, N. G. C,
said:
"No, sir; there is nothing in it. The
tale is manufactured out of whole cloth.
I have no intention of resigning at pres
ent, and when I do I shall do so in the
proper manner. Until my boys are called
into active service I will go ahead and
look to their welfare as I have in the
past, for I have just the same regard for
every man in the command as I have nl
ways had and feel that all feel the same
toward me. I shall see that they respond
as soldiers and that they maintain the
standard of the corps and the well-earned
title, of the 'Dandy Fifth,' the best regi
ment in the National Guard, and until
they are taken off my hands I will care
for them as their colonel. Nothing was
further from my mind than resigning, and
I shall stay with the Fifth."
The colonel complains bitterly of being
misrepresented all around, and states t.iat
he had no consultation with any officer
regarding the major-ship of the new regi
ment. He stated that he is not looking
for any such honors, and broadly hinted
that such an offer would not be to his
taste. Colonel Fairbanks is highly indig
nant at the rumor and is at a loss to ac
count for its origin.
THE MONADNOCK SAILS.
A Noisy Farewell to the Float-
ing Fortress and Her
Consort.
The coast defense steamer Monadnoek
and her consort, the collier Nc-ro, sailed
for Manila yesterday at 2 p. m. The
warship was the first to get under way,
and as soon as she began to move to
ward the Golden Gate every steam
whistle on the water front was let loose.
The Nero was a little longer in getting
away, owing to the delay in heaving up
the anchor, which had become foul.
As the Monad nock passed the ferries
the signal. "Remember the Maine," was
run up at the peak, and trie steam whis
tles, which had quieted down for a mo
ment, broke out into redoubled whistling.
while the crowds that thronged all the
wharves along the front raised a yell and
hurled back the cry, "Remember the
Maine."
The Monadnock and rsero went out
under easy steam. Neither of them will
hurry to Honolulu, and the fleet that
leaves next Monday will reach Honolulu
almost as soon, if not sooner, than they.
From Hawaii the warship and her con

THE GLORIOUS FOURTH-
tZIJ ROM all parts of the country come evidences
of a popular sentiment directed toward making
* the celebration of the Fourth of July this year
one of almost unprecedented brilliance and signifi
cance. It is to be an occasion for manifesting the
universality at?d the intensity of the patriotism of
the people. The war has aroused the ardor of even
the most indifferent to such spectacular displays, and
all over the Union preparations are under way for a
demonstration of loyalty to the nation and devotion
to the great principles upon which its government is
founded.
For some years past there have been in the public
mind doubts and fears concerning the welfare of the
republic. Our Fourth of July oratory has been more
or less devoted to a discussion of so-called problems
confronting the nation. To a considerable extent the
baneful spirit of pessimism affected the addresses of
the day. Orators pointed out dangers which they
saw or thought they saw confronting the nation or
its social structure, and much of their eloquence was
uttered in warnings against this or that evil supposed
to be menacing the land.
A different mood prevails among the people now
and we shall have a different oratory. Once more
there has awakened in the hearts of all an abiding
faith in the destiny of the nation and a sure confi
dence in its glorious future. There are no longer any
fears of sectional prejudices or class antagonisms.
Men of the North and of the South are marching
together under the same flag, and rich and poor are
serving in the same regiments. A common patriotism
and a common friendship bind together all the people
of all the States. The heart of the nation is in full
harmony with the occasion that is to be celebrated.
This year the ceremony of the day will be no per
functory observance. It will not be necessary to urge
the people to close their places of business and take
part in the great festival. All will do that of their
own accord.
It will not be overlooked that the celebration of
the year will be held over a wider area than ever be
fore, as well as with greater fervor. The great day
will be hailed and the flag saluted not only in our
own land, but by our fleets in the West Indies and in
the Orient. San Francisco must make her part of the
celebration equal to that of her sister cities and
worthy of the occasion. To that end every citizen
should cordially co-operate. Let us make it the most
glorious day of festival in the history of the city.
Admiral Camara remarked before embarking on
one of his celebrated jaunts out of Cadiz that he
would not return until his flag was wet with the
enemy's blood. Evidently the gentleman's intentions
are hostile. However, when his flags get wet it will
probably be with salt water, into which the enemy
will take grim pleasure in sending them. It is surely
not a libel to add that Camara seems chiefly success
ful as a false alarm.
Blanco explains that he did not free Hobson for
fear the lieutenant would carry valuable information
concerning the defenses of Santiago. However, this
excuse cannot be regarded much longer as good for
the American army is about to inspect the defenses
from the inside.
There are so many rumors as to the intention of
reviving the rank of lieutenant general that this will
probably not be done. Since every statesman has a
favorite candidate for the prospective position, the
interests of peace would suggest that the position be
not created.
If Alger and Long cannot in their little nests agree
they ought to hoist flags of truce until peace with
Spain shall have been declared. Then they may pro
reed with their personal scrap and depend upon an
entire nation to referee.
A fine of $1500 together with an indefinite sen
tence in jail for not answering questions will probably
impress upon Mr. Overend that as an obdurate wit
ness he stumbled upon a time when silence was not
golden.
Apparently nobody outside the highest military
circles knows whether Porto Rico is or is not to be
invaded. The announcement is varied every other
day, so that interest in it never flags.*
Just what "rewards" have been given by Blanco to
some of his valiant soldiers is not stated. It is hardly
believed he went so far as to actually pay them their
The tendency to criticise General Miles appears in
many quarters. He is simply undergoing the penalty
for being at the head of the army in war time.
The report that Blanco had been shot at probably
grew out of the circumstance that he deserved some
such delicate attention,
ANNEXATION GEOGRAPHY.
IT is probable that no other question ever before
our people has so depended on ignorance, prejudice
and misstatement as the annexation of Hawaii.
It was a dead issue until Dewey's victory in Manila
Bay revived it. It was resurrected, panoplied in
falsehood.
When it was up before an argument made for it
was that Honolulu was on the shortest route between
this city and Hongkong and Yokohama. Senator
Perkins himself disposed of that by showing the
shortest route to be nearly 1600 miles north of the
Sandwich Islands. In the prospect of a temporary
or permanent occupation of the Philippines the an
nexationists came up again with the shortest route
to Manila via Honolulu, and the old argument now
stated in the form of a military necessity.
The Oakland Board of Trade addressed to Con
gress a petition, to which we have referred, demand
ing annexation on the shortest route to the Philip
pines idea. In answer to our criticism of this ex
hibition of geographical ignorance the Oakland
Board of Trade exhibits a statement by Lyman
Bridges, In which the distance from San Francisco to
Manila, via Honolulu, is given at 6000 miles, and that
from San Francisco to Unalaska at 2035, Unalaska to
Yokohama at 3600 and Yokohama to Manila 1800,
making a total of 7435 miles, and showing 535 miles
in favor of the Honolulu route. Just why Mr.
Bridges diverged to Yokohama, or why, while di
verging, he did not go to Seoul or Vladivostok, is
not explained.
But he is not the only geographer. Mr. John
Haynes appears in the Chronicle with a desire to
use up Senators White and Pettigrew on this mileage
question. Mr. Haynes says that these Senators state
what is "grossly untrue" about the mileage of the two
routes, and proceeds to prove it by the map. To
quota his inexactness exactly, he says:
"An air line drawn from San Francisco to the
northern end of the island of Luzon passes about
four degrees, or 240 nautical miles, north of Honolulu,
while Unalaska is twenty degrees or 1200 miles north
of the same line. Yet the Senator figures that the
Unalaska route is shorter by 800 miles; that is, the
Senator contends that the greater the divergence
from a straight line the shorter the distance between
two points."
Reading this, one is convinced that Mr. Bridges
and Mr. Haynes went to school to a teacher who
taught that the world is round or flat, and that they
took it flat, hence Mr. Bridges' zigzag by sea and
Mr. Haynes' air line cast upon the waters, and his
innocent prattle of "degrees" in discussing east and
west mileage on the surface of the globe.
If these two gentlemen, whose geography is ante-
Ptolemalc, who seem not to have heard of Copernicus
and to whom Maury is unknown, will inquire they will
learn that the world is round, that in sailing east and
west meridians of longitude are crossed, not degrees
of latitude. They will learn that as these meridians
converge at the poles they are widest apart at the
equator, and continually approach each other until
they cross at the poles. Sailing directly around the
earth east and west the greatest circumference is at
the equator, and lessens as the poles are approached.
Hence to get the shortest distance between two
points east and west of each other in the Northern
Hemisphere, even if they are both upon the equator,
sail north on a curve, and if in the Southern Hemis
phere sail south. This is circle navigation, which
was explained by Maury and is so well understood
by navigators and by all landlubbers who were
taught that the world is round that they refuse to be
taken in by Mr. Haynes' "air line."
In every ocean steamship company's office may be
found a map called "Tracks for Full-powered Steam
Vessels." These are the circle tracks, and by this
map the distance between San Francisco and Manila
via Unalaska is about 800 miles less than by Hono
lulu.
Congressman Grosvenor was taught that the world
is round and that its east and west diameter and cir
cumference decrease as you go north or south from
the equator, therefore he admits Unalaska to be the
shorter route, and so do Commodore Melville, Sen
ator Perkins and everybody except those who were
taught in a flat world school.
THE "POPULAR" GOVERNMENT OF
COLONIES.
JULES LEMAITRE, a noted Frenchman, has
published an article in which he discusses at
some length the difficulties, theoretical and
practical, which beset the government of colonies
under a democratic constitution. He says that one
of the greatest of these is the necessity which at the
outset compels the governing power to flatly re
pudiate the principles of self-government Comment
ing upon Lemaitre's observations an Eastern re
viewer quotes and advocates the immediate adoption
as a national motto of the following couplet:
A marciful Providence fashioned us holler
O' purpose thet we might our princerpels swaller.
Perhaps the formal adoption of this couplet would
be opposed, but it is quite certain that if the policy of
acquiring outside territory now so generally advo
cated by the yellow papers, and some not quite so
yellow, is ratified by Congress, some such rhyme as
this will be necessary to explain exactly where our
"princerpels" have gone.
In his article Lemaitre said the French armies had
invaded Madagascar for the purpose of murdering
"a childlike people who have as much right as we
have to be free, to govern themselves and to own the
land left them by their ancestors." He declared also
that those among these childlike people who had not
been murdered by this expedition had in the name of
civilization been enslaved.
As we are about to invade the Philippines on a sim
ilar "civilizing" mission, it is interesting to keep track
of such discussions as have been precipitated by this
Frenchman. What are the Americans going to do
with the Philippines after they have landed their
army and placed General Merritt's military govern
ment in command? What are they going to do with
Cuba after Admiral Sampson has bombarded all its
port 9 and General Shafter has taken all the Spaniards
into custody? Are they then going to withdraw and
permit the turbulent races who inhabit these two re
gions to govern themselves? Or are they going to
"civilize" them after the method adopted by the
French, English and Germans, and thereupon their
"princerpels swaller"?
There is no doubt that a strong public opinion is
forming at the present moment upon this subject.
What policy it will cause to be adopted cannot now
be foretold, but that something will have to be done
toward amending the American notion of non
interference in foreign affairs seems almost certain.
Cuba and the Philippines are an unworked field and
will require far from the usual republican treatment.
The question raised by Lemaitre is one that will dis
turb the American people for a long time to come.
Anybody who wants that Cadiz fleet will have to go
to Spain for it.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JVJSK 24, 1898.
ANOTIiER DEMOCRATIC PLAN.
DURING the last few days, for the purpose of
keeping our readers posted on the drift of
things in the national Democratic camp, we
have presented three policies suggested by members
of different factions for the campaign of this falL One
of these, favored by the Richmond Times, was a pol
icy of opposition to an increase of the army and
navy, to the annexation of any island territory and to
all forms of so-called "imperialism." The second,
supported by the Louisville Post, advocated a broad
scheme of colonial expansion and the maintenance
of an extensive army and navy. The third, advanced
by the Examiner, was a contest against the adminis
tration on the alleged ground that the war revenue
bill places nearly the whole burden of taxation upon
the poor. This was designed to continue Bryanism in
politics by appealing to a supposed antagonism of the
poor to the rich.
This morning we have a fourth Democratic pro
gramme to present. It comes from a letter pub
lished in the New York World, and which, accord
ing to the World, was written '"by one of the most
prominent Democrats in the State and nation." The
writer in discussing the outlook for the campaign in
New York says:
"The ablest leaders seem to think it unwise to press
national issues in a time of war, even if the party was
wholly united on them, as the war issue alone absorbs
and overshadows every other national question.
Therefore, as a matter of expediency, it is deemed
wise to postpone the presentation or discussion of
national issues until the war is over and press State
issues 'to the front, upon which the party Is not only
strong, but entirely united. There seems to be much
wisdom in this course, and it will undoubtedly pre
vail with little or no friction, as all elements of the
party seem desirous of success."
It will be seen that each of the four plans is in con
flict with all the others. The Richmond and the
Louisville men would bring the war questions di
rectly to the front, but they do not agree on the
policy to be pursued with regard to them. The Ex
aminer plan subordinates great issues to the minor
one of taxation and puts forward a policy of per
nicious demagogy, while the New York proposal
favors the abandonment of national issues altogether,
leaving the Congressional candidates of the party to
make the fight any way they please and concentrating
the whole strength of the organization to carry the
State tickets.
Out of this confusion it is impossible that harmony
can be brought in time for the elections. Democ
racy will make a guerrilla fight this fall. Each petty
leader will rally his followers by whatever war cry
seems best to himself and them. Between the platform
put forward in one State and that in another there
will be inconsistencies and contradictions without
number. If by any possibility the Democrats should
elect a majority of the members of the House of
Representatives by such tactics the proceedings of the
next Congress would be confusion worse confounded.
If for no other reason, therefore, the people will have
to vote the Republican ticket this fall for the purpose
of providing the nation with a government capable
of governing.
BOSTON GIVES IT UP.
/^~* COMMENTING upon the complex problems of
I foreign policy which have arisen out of our
new relations to the Philippines the Boston
Globe says: "Nothing has happened in the war that
was planned before it began. We have been the sport
of chance." Then, after describing the doubt and
confusion in the public mind on the subject, it adds:
"Even Boston, which is the greatest compounder of
solutions for all problems that vex the minds alike
of the finite and the infinite, discovered when its
wisdom was assembled in Faneuil Hall on Wednes
day that there was no complete solvent ready made
for this most novel and unforeseen occasion."
Since the wisdom of Boston assembled in Fanueil
Hall could not solve the problem, 'it Is the opinion
of the Globe that the rest of the country might as
well give it up. It says: "Since circumstances are
responsible for involving us in such a strange situa
tion we shall have to wait for circumstances to ex
tricate us." There may be many people who will
agree with that conclusion, but few will accept the
ground on which it was based. Some will hold that
while it may be best to wait on circumstances in or
der to see what will be developed, it would not be wise
to wait simply because Boston has no solution to
offer.
The objection to waiting and drifting is that na
tions as well as individuals who surrender themselves
to the current not infrequently find themselves car
ried into situations from which it is difficult to es
cape. If we had dealt with the Cuban problem reso
lutely several years ago we might have escaped the
cost of this war. If we now clearly determine what
we are to do with the captured colonies of Spain we
may save ourselves from some serious complication
later on.
We have had ample experience in our compara
tively short history of the folly of waiting on events.
By postponing the settlement of the slave question in
the early years of the republic we had a great civil
war to fight out. By neglecting to settle the finan
cial problems of the nation in a time of prosperity
we had a free silver agitation in a season of panic
and distress which caused untold disaster to many an
industry and many a home. By postponing consider
ation of the problems now before us we may permit
the growth of an erroneous sentiment among the
people which will be as troublesome to eradicate as
the free silver craze.
It should be determined at once that whatever it
may be necessary for justice sake to do with the
colonies wrested from Spain, we shall not annex them
to this country nor shall we ever include among our
citizens the Mongol and mongrel races of the
islands of the Orient. Incidentally the same may be
said of Hawaii. Boston may give it up, but the rest
of the country doesn't propose to drift.
Now the members of the ex-Grand Jury who failed
to do anything with the water front jobs have another
chance to be ashamed of themselves. Evidently the
scare Commissioner Colnon got did not wholly re
form him.
There is believed to be a fair profit in the lumber
business without robbing the State. Happily this
belief seems to be entertained by a majority of the
Harbor Commissioners.
When we read so much false news designed to
"buoy the Spanish heart" we can but wonder if the
Spanish brain is not to be considered.
The announcement that the bodies of American
soldiers slain in Cuba were not wantonly violated is
gratifying and it is also surprising.
Blanco will be remembered in after years for the
power of imagery characterizing his fiction.
Perhaps ex-Treasurer Widber pleaded not guilty
just for the joke of the thing.
ROUTE TO THE PHILIPPINES.
Hundreds of Miles Longer via Honolulu Than by the Way
of Unalaska.
Professor George Davidson has carefully computed the distance be
tween San Francisco and Manila by three routes. He finds that the Una
laska route is hundreds of miles shorter than the route by way of Hono
lulu. The argument that the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands will
provide a stepping stone on the most direct way from Manila to San Fran
cisco is therefore seen to be based upon a false and misleading assump
tion. Professor Davidson's statement is as follows:
OCEAN ROUTES BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND MANILLA IN
THE PHILIPPINES. Nautical
Miles.
r. Composite route from San Francisco to Manila, via Iliouliouk harbor,
on the north side of Unalaska Island, Bering Sea.
Distance from San Francisco to Unalaska Island by Great Circle route 2035
From Unalaska a Great Circle sailing route canot be laid down to
Luzon Island. It would pass close along the north side of the Aleutian
chain, pass through these dangers, and then find Japan in the track.
So a vessel must come out into .he Pacific through the Akutan Pass,
then follow under the south shores of the islands to a point south of
Adakh Island for a distance of 465
Thence by a Great Circle to Point Engano, the northeast point of
Luzon Island, cutting very close to Cape King, off Yokohama Bay 3450
Thence by the shortest steaming route around the Northwest Cape
of Luzon to Manila % 420
Total San Francisco to Manila, via Unalaska 6370
2. By a Great Circle route from San Francisco to the Northwest Cape of
Luzon Island 5850
From Northwest Cape to Manila 330
Total, San Francisco to Manila 6180
This sailing route reaches close to latitude 46 degrees 20 minutes in
longitude 165 degrees west, or five degrees of latitude (300 nautical
miles) south of the southernmost of the Aleutians.
3. Composite route from San Francisco to Manila, via Honolulu.
By Great Circle from San Francisco to Honolulu 2090
By Great Circle from Honolulu to Cape Engano (northeast cape of
Luzon Island) 4445
Cape Engano to Manila 445
Total, San Francisco to Manila, via Honolulu 6955
Of the route by way of Iliouliouk, Unalaska, reaching latitude 54 de
grees, it should be borne in mind that the vessel must pass out of the
Pacific into Bering Sea through the Akutan Pass; and in coming out
again run. the risks in that channel. That whole coastline is very % wild,
high, rocky and enveloped for days and even weeks in dense fogs.
Furthermore, a vessel going westward by that route must run
counter to the Great Japanese Warm Stream for the whole distance,
and at all seasons she is under the southeast edge of the typhoon storm
path. These paths are laid down on the North Pacific Pilot Chart, and
their origin among the Northern Philippines.
Many years since I was consulted by a large steamship company of
San Francisco whose steamships had suffered from heavy storms on
the Great Circle route from Yokohama. I advised that they would
meet with a mdre equable temperature, better weather and smoother
sea by not running higher than 40 degrees north latitude. I have seen
no good reason to change my opinion.
TEST OF THE VESUVIUS.
The Vesuvius is officially styled a dyna
mite gunboat, of 929 tons displacement
and 21.42 knots, but our naval high explo
sive for use in great quantities is still
guncotton, 60 that she is really a gun
cotton or pneumatic gunboat. The exact
effect of her three tremendous shots we
may not know until after we have taken
Santiago and examined the points of im
pact, but they seem to have fulfilled all
expectations. The Vesuvius, in short, has
a sphere of her own. She may never be
risked alone against a hostile ship, or
certainly against a ship that can hit other
things than the ocean, yet her uses in at
tacking forts and defending harbors or
narrow passes are obvious, and her high
angle flre was exactly suited to the cliffs
of Santiago.â New York Sun.
It Is the function of vessels of the Vesu
vius type to deliver the finishing blow.
They are properly classed, therefore, with
the torpedo boats, and not with the ships
that go into action for the purpose of de
livering a broadside or turret flre and
keeping it up until the enemy is crush
ed. The Vesuvius crushes at one blow
precisely like a torpedo or a submarine
mine. She resembles a torpedo boat,
moreover, in being defenseless against a
heavy fire. If she is hit hard it is the end
of her. The tremendous efficiency, of
shells charged with a large quantity of
high explosives had often been demon
strated in experimental firing. The safety
of the pneumatic gun and the trustworth
iness of the fuses used for the shells were
also established before the test of the
Vesuvius at Santiago. What she proved
there was her ability to get near enough
to a shore fortification to reach it with
her guns, which have an effective range
of only about one mile and a half. Un
der cover of darkness, with the Oregon's
searchlights serving the double purpose
of illuminating her target and screening
her from observation, she was able to ex
plode two shells on the hill where the
Spanish battery was placed, and to send
one shell over the hill to the anchorage
of the Furor and the Pluton. The first
use of the pneumatic gun in actual war
appears to have had results that will
greatly Increase professional Interest In
this arm.â New York Times.
Some fear has been expressed that the
enormous guns of the Vesuvius might
possibly be more dangerous to the per
sons on board than to the party attacked.
They have been proved at a practice on

harbor, and the execiition of the shells
was terrible beyond description. The ex

rock and earth were huried into the air.
No fort of whatever it might be con

necessary to attack Havana Blanco's
"impregnable forts" would be no better
protection against the guns of the Vesu

Another unknown quantity of the
American navy has been tested and has
not proved disappointing. The dyna
mite cruiser Vesuvius, the only war ship
of its kind In the world, was given a
chance to try Its terrible dynamite guns
at Santiago the other night. Three heavy
charges were fired, with marked effect,
and the experiment was repeated the
next night, when one of the shells struck
Cayo Smith, the small fortified Island
Just Inside the harbor of Santiago, and
"tore a hole in it large enough to hide
a church." It can hardly be claimed that
the tests thus far made have been con
clusive, but the destructiveness of the
dynamite gun has been abundantly dem
onstrated and its practicability has been
proved. The Vesuvius marks a new era
In naval construction.â Chicago Times-

The most terrible product of modern
sclenbe to be used in future warfare was
tried against the forts guarding Santiago
harbor and proved a great and complete
success. It was the first use of a dyna
mite cruiser in actual warfare, and the
result proves that the United States has
the most mighty destructive engines afloat
in the Vesuvius. As a destroyer the
cruiser has proved to be the most terri
ble and frightful agent known to science
to-day.â Brooklyn Times.
Now that the Vesuvius has been tried
on Santiago and found equal to the best
expecfations. if the dispatches give us
correct information, we may rest In the
confidence that the reduction of the Ha
vana fortifications will be easy. It would
not take more than two or three shots
planted in Morro Castle at the mouth of
the harbor to destroy it so effectually that
not a gun would remain mounted and
not a gunner would escape.â Brooklyn

clock fro round,
conscious that every move was so much
nearer to the hour when his labors ceased
and his sleep began. The overland was
late that night and there was little for
O'Brien to do but keep awake. A few
idlers were sitting on the chairs counting
ti.e flagstones or the electric lights that
stud the handsomely decorated ceiling of
the Palace office. A complete silence
stood master of the moment, save for the
regular beating of a man's heels on the

DAYLIGHT
BURGLARS
Surprised in a Steven
son-Street House.
ARMED WITH A STOLEN GUN
THREATENED TO SHOOT, THEN
TOOK FRIGHT.
One or Them Captured After a Long
and Somewhat Exciting Chase
Across Blocks by Detec
tive Cody.
A daring burglary was committed by
four men In broad daylight yesterday on
Stevenson street, and one of the thieves
was chased for several blocks and cap
tured by Detective Cody and booked at
the City Prison.
P. F. Angonnet is a saloon-keeper on
the corner of Seventh and Stevenson
streets. He lives in a house in the rear
nf the saloon, and shortly after 1 o'clock j
yesterday afternoon, while his family was
away he had occasion to go home.
When Angonnet reached his front door
a man jumped out and asked him in vig
orous language what he wanted there, j
He pushed past him and in a room in the |
rear another man confronted him with a l
revolver in his hand and threatened to j
shoot. Angonnet ran into the street j
shouting tor the police and the burglars |
rushed out through the open doorway
after him and fled.
Detective Cody happened to be stand
ing on the cornet of Market and Sev
enth streets, and hearing Angonnet's
cries, and seeing the men running in dif
ferent directions, he gave chase to one
who ran across Seventh street In the di
rection of Market. The burglar sped
across Market and ran through the prem
( Gladding. McÃean & Co. to Park
avenue. He continued his flight along Mc-
Allister street and turned north on Hyde
street. Cody was in close pursuit and
overtook the fugitive at Golden Gate ave
nue. Cody soon had the handcuffs on him
and took him to the City Prison, where he
was booked on the burglary.
He gave the name of James Mahoney,
and his occupation as a horseshoer. He
is unknown to the police.
Angonnet found tnat the burglars had
rar..-.t'-ked every room in the bouse, but
they only succeeded in getting away with
a revolver and two gold pins. His Fister
in-law, who is visiting him, fortunately
took the most of the jewelry with her
when she left the house as a precaution
against burglars.
Descriptions of the other three men
are in the hands of the police, and every
effort will be made to arrest them. They
were seen loitering in that locality all
morning, and one of them had a black
bilk handkerchief partially concealing his
face. Another of the men about 11 o'clock
called at the residence of M. Scheramsky,
C2l'4 Stevenson street, and made an in

GRAND JURY
THE ONLY
SALVATION
Lumber Contractors'
Peculiar Methods.
COLNON AN EXCELLENT AIDE
THE STATE SAVED MANY THOU
SANDS BY AN EXPOSE.
Strenuous Efforts to Foist a Deal
the Harbor Commissioners
by Unscrupulous Lumber
Dealers.
Harbor Commissioner Oolnon's ears
must have tingled yesterday if there is
any efficacy in the old superstition of be
ing talked about. The unfavorable com
ments hurled at him by citizens who read
of his peculiar attitude toward the lum
ber combine in The Call of yesterday
must have certainly caused a warmth
about the organ of hearing of any one
less calloused.
It is evident that the many exposures
made of hfs methods during the past few
months have had little effect, as in the
face of his fellow-Commissioners he at
tempted to foist a contract on the State
which would have placed it at the mercy
of a grasping contractor for the next six
months, necessitating a loss of many
thousands of dollars. As was stated yes
terday the Interference of Commissioners
Harney and Herold averted the calamity,
for which every one should be thankful.
During the past few years it has been
the policy of a number of large lumber
dealer*- to form a "â¢combine" and charge
the Commissioners a price for lumber j
I much larger than ordinarily sold to out
! sidt-rs. This went along unchecked up to ;
a month ago, when the E. K. Wood Lum- i
ber Company broke away from the "com- j
bine" and placed a bid before the Com- !
mlssioners offering to furnish them with
lumber at $11 50 per thousand feet, much
less than they have been in the habit of
paying.
When the lumber merchants wore in
formed through the columns of The Call
that this had been done, they immediate
ly set about finding a means to punish
the daring deserter. The "combine knew
that the E. K. Wood Company would not
have sufficient lumber to fulfill the con
tract and must necessarily appeal to other
companies for assistance, and it was in
tended to compel the firm to pay the
usual tariff of $14 50, although the market
had depreciated. It was evident that the
E. K. Wood Company became intimi
dated, as it withdrew its bid, thus allow
ing the field free to preferred companies.
As was stated yesterday, the S. E. Slade
Lumber Company put in a bid offering to
furnish the State with lumber during thÂ« j
next six months at $14. which was vir- I
tually the old price. Their offer might
have been granted but for the fact that
Major Harney and Mr. Herold had been
Informed of the combine's manner of
transacting business and much to the dis
appointment of Colnon the bid was re- I
Jected.
A little green pamphlet containing the
schedule of prices, which Is carried by j
members of the "combine" and other '
dealers fortunate to possess them, gives j
the present open market price on the
same lumber the Harbor Commissioners
purchases at $13. This alone Is conclusive
evidence that the amount asked In the I
bid of the Slade Lumber Company was !
$1 50 in excess of the regular selling price.
It would seem that there is an out and
out job to fleece the State fund, and the
sooner this is prevented the better it will
be for th^citizens whose taxes go to ex
pand it. If the Harbor Commissioners are I
unable to protect themselves from the
grasping contractors it would seem that
the matter should be taken up by the
Grand Jury. And if the Grand Jury can
not fathom the mystery it might be well
for Governor Budd to instruct the Com
missioners as a matter of protection to
the State and State funds to purchase i
their lumber through the San Quentin
Prison. If this is done lumber can be had l
at a much cheaper rate than that fixed ;
by the combine, thus saving the State
from the grasp of money-making con
tractors.
For purposes of comparison It may not
be ill timed to again refer to the table of
prices quoted in yesterday's article. As I
can readily be seen, the Simpson Lum
ber Company, one of the combine, fur
nishes the San Quentin Prison with lum
ber at a less figure than is generally
charged the Commissioners. The follow
ing table affords a comparison:
Rough. Selected. Flooring. !
Harbor Commission. sl4 00 $19 00 $24 00 !
San Quentin 10 50 ir, 00 23 50 j
Difference $3 50 $4 HO $0 50 |
It costs $1 50 to deliver the lumber at the
prison, but this falls on the contractor.
Even if this addition were charged the j
Commissioners they would be getting the j
lumber at a less figure than that offered
by the Slade Lumber Company.

the Cause.
A TELEGRAPHIC BOOMERANG
BUSINESS MEN REFUSE TO IN
DORSE THE ARMY OFFICER.
The Labor Unions and State Officials
Take a Hand in the Inter
ests of White
Workers.
An interesting condition of affairs has
arisen out of the letting of contracts for
making uniforms for Uncle Sam's sol
diers to contractors who have had and are
having the work done by Chinese. As
coon as the discovery was made that Chi
nese were making these uniforms, while
hundreds of white people are only too
anxious to get the work, the matter was
published in all of the local papers and
even the papers of the entire State had
something to say about the injustice of
the transaction. Nowhere was the letting
of the work to Mongolians more con
demned than In the labor unions. Major
Long of the local Quartermaster's Depart
ment, who let the contracts in question,
was called to task, by public voice at
least, and he assumed the position that
the contracts were let to white men and
that he did not believe that the work was
being done by Chinese. He further stip
ulated that if such proved to be the case
he would cancel such contracts at once.
It did not take very long to find where
a goodly number of Chinese were engaged
in the business. In the meantime the la
bor union folks asked the State Labor
Commissioner to direct the attention of
the officials at Washington to the Injus
tice, which he did, addressing his letter
to Congressman Maguire. The letter from
the California Labor Commissioner was
sent to Secretary of War Russell A. Alger
by Maguire, who made the following addi
tion :
WASHINGTON, D. C. June 4. IS9S.
Hon. Russell A. Alger, Secretary of War,
Washington, D. C. â fair: I am in receipt of
the enclosed letter and newspaper clipping from
San Francisco, to which I respectfully call
your attention. The people of San Francisco
have been enduring an unprecedented period
of hard times, from which they have nut >vt
recovered, and therefore feel Treatly aggrieved
that at such a time work required by their
Government should be farmed out through un
patriotic contractors to Chinese labor, while
they are exrluded from the opportunity to
share In the employment. I am sure that the
state of affairs set forth by Labor Commis
sioner Fitzgerald in the enclosed letter is con
trary to the intention of the Government, and I
trust that you will be able to find a speedy and
satisfactory remedy for the injustice of which
our people comDlain in the matter. Yours
respectfully. JAMES G. MAGUIRE. M. C.
A short time after the Congressman re
ceived a formal note, accompanied by a
copy of a telegram sent by Major Long
to the department, both of which are
here given, and which were sent to Com
missioner Fitzgerald:
First indorsement. War Department, Quar
termaster-General's Office June 17, IS9B. Re
spectfully returned to Hon. J. G. Maguire,
House of Representatives, whose attention is
invited to the accompanying copy of telegram
from the post quartermaster at San Fran
cisco, Cal, upon the subject
QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL, U. S. A.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., June 7, IS9B.
Quartermaster-General, Washington, D. C. :
This department does not and has not know
ingly during my incumbency employed Chinese
labor on uniforms or anything else manufac
tured or contracted for here. On two early
contracts made wrnie weeks ago I discovered
that Chinese labor was being employed and im
mediately canceled contracts. Representatives
of labor organizations visited me, and after
explanation expressed themselves as perfectly
satisfied. I invited them to Investigate and
assist in ascertaining which contractor em
ployed Chinese labor, and that I would at
once annul contracts. All contracts and ordere
require white labor only to be employed. It

Â® Records and time-tables made by the pen of Mrs. Nettle R. Craven Â®
Â® while principal of the Mission Grammar School are now In the hands of Â®
Â® the Superintendent of Schools and incidentally within the grasp of the Â®
Â® Police Department. This fact, however, need cause no shudder to Mrs. Â®
Â® Craven or her friends, as the mare's nest supposed to exist in the records Â®
Â® and that did exist in the mind of the venerable head of the Police De- Â®
Â® partment is not to be found. The second day's hearing in the case re- Â®
Â® suited in a defeat of the efforts of Attorney A. Ruef, who was appointed Â®
Â® amicus curiae, or the court's friend, during the trial of the action for the Â®
Â® recovery of the books, to prevent a transfer, and the volumes, fourteen Â®
Â® in number, were handed over to the School Department. The court was Â®
Â® inclined at first to deliver the books to the -department, but the vigorous Â®
Â® protest of Attorney. Ruef, who contended that the title to the property Â®
Â® had not been determined by the plaintiff's witnesses, resulted in a con- Â®
Â® tinuance of the case for one day, that more evidence might be gathered. Â®
Â® When the trial was resumed yesterday, Nellie Sullivan, first vice prin- Â®
Â® cipal of the Mission Grammar School, was called. She Identified the Â®
Â® books as the property of the School Department to the satisfaction of the Â®
(â¢) court, and Judge Troutt ordered the books transferred 'to their proper Â®
Â® owner. . , .. . Â®

Â® dence to prove that Mrs. Craven had falsely testified during the trial of Â®
Â® the action brought against Mrs. Craven by the executors of the will of Â®
Â® James G. Fair to quiet title to valuable property was not notoriously pres- Â®
rtj) ent In but one instance did the books in any way bear out the theory of Â®
Â® the' Inquisitive Police Department. On the date of September 24, 1894. the Â®
Â® day on which Mrs. Craven stated that she was given | the deeds to the Â®
Â® contested property by James G. Fair, and also the date of. the famous pen-
Â® ell will, the books show that ; Mrs. Craven was â  present at school at 8:45 Â®
Â® in the morning. The figures plainly show that Mrs. Craven was present Â®
Â® on that day and at that hour, bpt superimposed over the figures is a large Â®
Â® A, the abridged abbreviation of the word absent. The A, however, is in Â®
Â® the hand of Mrs. Craven, is written with the same colored ink and wears Â®
Â® the same appearance of age. Many other dates are mentioned by the po- Â®
Â® lice, but the records fail to show that the startling theory advanced that â¢ Â®
Â® perjury was committed is based on facts, and before the light of invest!- Â®
Â® gation the theory is dissipated and leaves but a trace of suspicion behind. Â®

When the contents of the telegram be
came known In the labor unions it raised
a merry war. Several of the prominent
leaders made it their business to find
who in the ranks of labor had called upon
the major and given him their assur
ance, as representatives of labor, that
workingmen were satisfied with what the
hud done when, aa a. fact, the unions are
very much dissatisfied with hia course.
No one could be found who would father
the responsibility for this assertion, and
the conclusion reached was that this
much was a misstatement. J. P. McCar
thy a member of several labor organi
zations, made personal calls yesterday
upon the presidents of the State Board of
Trade and City Board of Trade. Accord
ing to the statement of McCarthy deni
als were vigorously made at both places
of having indorsed anything Major Long
had done or said. In fact, they had never
been consulted or advised on the sub
ject and they asserted they were against
the employment of Chinese labor in mak
ing uniforms for Uncle Sam's boys.
Commissioner Fitzgerald and Deputy
Dam made a call upon Hugh Craig, presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce, who
expressed his disapproval of the use
made of the name of the Chamber of
Commerce in very forcible language, add
ing that he did not indorse anything
that Major Long had done. From all that
can be learned the major has had an ink
ling of what was going on and has mani
fested some concern in regard to the
matter. For instance, one of his Oak
land relatives by marriage is said to have
gone to President Craig and intimated

! that if Mr. Craig took an energetic part
In denying that he indorsed the course
of Major Long and the members of the
boards of trade took a similar course the
city might be hurt to the tune of sev
eral hundred thousand dollars, as : the
major would make his purchases in the
East instead of on this coast.
According to report Mr. Craig reply
was to the effect that he would see the
whole crowd in a hotter place than Ma
nila and Cuba combined before he would
I allow any one to bulldoze him on such
a proposition, adding that the depart
ment at Washington is a peg higher than
any of the officers on this coast, and the
i first signs of carrying out the threat
I would be the signal for action that would
I have not a little effect with the depart
ment at Washington.
There was still another point that had
to be attended to, and the Labor Com
missioner and his deputy made a tour of
the Chinese Quarter to see if the promise
of the major to cancel contracts where
Chinese labor is employed Is being car
ried out. They found half a dozen or
more places where soldiers' garments are
being made, although the telegram of
Major Long would indicate > otherwise.
The recent murder of Little Pete's nephew
also shows that the Chinese have the
monopoly of the business of making sol
diers clothing. This Chinese would not
I enter the Mongolian pool to control the
manufacture of this class of garments
and his life paid the forfeit. It might
be harsh to say that Major Long has a
dead Chinaman on his hands, but some
may be so uncharitable as to think so.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council the following resolutions were
unanimously adopted: _-â ;.
Whereas, In response to the memorial con
cerning the manufacture of clothing tor the
United States soldiers by Chinese labor, sent
by Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald to the Hon.
James G. Ma&uire and by the latter laid before
the War Department, said department has been
communicated with by Captain Lbng, quarter-
master In charge, with the result that the
quartermaster denies the facts are true, and
that the Chamber of Commerce and Board of
Trade have tendered their support In sustain
ing his position; and whereas, It la a notorious
fact that the said quartermaster, after his
attention had beeti called to the fact, has per
mitted the work to continue In the hands of
the Chinese, while deserving white labor of San
Francisco has been deprived, denied and in
sulted upon asking this work of the commis
sary department: and whereas, ths telegram
sent by Captain Lpng to the "War Department
Is willfully and malloiously a misstauÂ»ment of
facts, misleading in Us effects, sent to his su
periors with a view of rendering himself blame
less and offering the co-operation and Indorse
ment of prominent mercantile bodies which
have never taken official action and the offi
cers of which individually sustain the position
of Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald in denoun
cing the manner In which these contracts have
been performed to the deprivation and exclu
sion of competent, skilled, needy and deserving
women of San Francisco, whose daily bread
depends upon this work; and whereas, no
stronger evidence of the false position as
sumed by Captain Long is necessary than the
fact that one Chinese contractor forfeited his
life only last night aa a punishment for hav
ing underbid his countrymen in the manu
facture of these clothes.
Resolved, By the Building Trades Council
In regular session assembled, that we denounce
the action of Captain Long as dishonest and
deceitful and unworthy of a soldier and gen
tleman.

A Story. By GEORGE MOORE, author

$1 50. .
Mr. Moore's comparative silence for the
last few years has been due to his pre-
occupation with his most serious and
important work, which is now given to
the public. This novel is a masterly
analysis of a conflict between art and the
â¢world on the one side and religion upon
the other. The^heme is developed with
a penetrating fhslght into motives, a
grasp of character and a -mastery of lit-
erary technique which make "Evelyn
Innes" a notable book. The action of
the novel passes in large part in London
and Paris. It is a story of the present
day, characterized by a vivid perception
of the ; doubts and complex conditions of 'â 
modern life. The musical motif which '
has so large a part in the development
of the story is interwoven with others,
which in t.ielr unfolding show a rare
subtlety and power of expression.

DRIED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial says of Califor
nia dried fruits: "Probably the leading article
on the dried fruit list, if any may be called
leading where all are so backward, is Cali
fornia apricots. Spot BUppliM are light, both
here and at the coast, and prices are well
maintained. In all probability tne crop of apri
cots at the const will hr smaljer thaji last
year and growers are demanding good prices
for fruit fur canning purposes. A few samples
of new evaporated apricots have been received
here, but no prices wore named. It is under
st 1 that foreign buyers have been cabling
for pries on future prunes and apricots, but
there seems to be a tendency to hold back,
and buyers will probably have to wait until the
fruit Is ready before prices are issued. In re
gard to prunes it may be said that the easy
tone previously noted is still In evidence, ap
plicable, however, only to the more undesirable
sizes. Large and small prunes are scarce, and
only the medium sizes are in good supply.
bt< ickn here are said to be lighter than ever
bef >re at this season, apd news from other
distributing points Is to the same effect. Cali
fornia raisins are very quiet at the moment,
but prices are unchanged. Reports (mm the
growing crop are favorable for a large pro
duction."
THE WAR TAX.
The tax on backers and brokers, on checks,
drafts, notes, telegraph and telephone mes
snKes, sales or transfer of stock, bills of ex
change, deeds, sugar and oil corporations, etc,
goes into effect July 1.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 23.â G00d weather in the
Vest and the landing of a considerable part of
the American army near Santiago, together
with the firmness In London, acted as a stimu
lus in to-day's stock market. The persistent
drives by the bears against special stocks was
a feature. The trading for some time was
lacking to-day, and In consequence the ap
parent change of front by these interests vas
reflected in substantial advances in fc-ugar,
s Gas, Tobacco, Brooklyn Transit and
Manhattan. The buoyancy exhibited by these
properties exerted a healthful influence upon
the general railroad list, whtch was conse
quently augmented by the execution of fairly
la iK- buying orders In the Vanderbilt prop- j
ertles. The Grangers received more attention
than for a long time and conspicuous advances
were registered in Hurlingtor. and Rock Island.
The revived Inquiry for Pacific Northwestern
Ptinrks lent color to persistent rumors that an
amicable settlement of the tranteonllnental
rate war may be forthcoming. Evidence of
commission-house pui-ch^st-a also developed a
brisk covering throughout the list. Some of
the high-priced investment shares responded
in a noteworthy extent to a moderate inquiry,
notably Puilman, which figured for a rise of 3
points. The market at Intervals during the j
day displayed stagnation, but prices neverthe
ri.'fd continually upward, operations for |
arbitrage account were in fairly large volume j
and included =alrs of most of the international
favorites. The offerings from this source,
however, were well absorbed and the steadiness |
of the local speculation induced some purchases
for foreign account, mainly in St. I'aul. A
development which has been regarded with
considerable gratification by substantial ln
t-n-.-ts lias boon thÂ« growing expansion in rail
way and miscellaneous bonds, which in a meas
ure retlects the general healthful tone of
finances. Operatings in this department em
braced an extensive variety of mortgages, with
demand for the Issues of reorganized properties
heavy. The aggregate transactions were $3,060,-
W).
QcvemmÂ«nt issues also participated In the
general strength, the old 4's registered lmprov
iTitr tfc and <ld 4's coupon and the new 4'b %

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. "
CHICAGO, June 23.â Continued favorable
weather for harvesting exerted a bearish In
fluence In wheat at the start. During the
first half hour there was enough short selling
and liquidation to cause the market to Bell off
MrS%c from the close last night. But crop
damage reports again became very numerous
and the .selling soon came to a halt. Consider
able rain was reported in those sections where
harvesting is not going on, and injury to the
grain was regarded as probable. Chinch bugs
were said to be numerous in Southern Illinois
and from any sections where the grain has
been gathered the yield was said to be disap
pointing. : With Armour supposed to be work
ing to sustain the price of the future to protect
his cash property and the trade already rather
nervous, these reports scared shorts and there
was a disposition to cover, the demand grad
ually Improving the price. Some considerable
lines were covered and the bear scalpers were
eventually driven In. During the existence of
the buying fever, July sold up to 75c, Septem
ber to SS'<Â»c and December to 6S*j,c. The trad-
Ing was very light after the first hour, but
exceedingly nervous. There was a strong sus
picion of manipulation and a wholesome dread
of the alleged manipulators. Prices were near
the highest point of the day at the close. July
left off %c higher and September lost %c on the
day.
After a weak opening corn turned strong on
the rally in wheat and the early decline was
more than recovered. July closed Vie better. -
Oats were weak early but firmed up later
with the other grains, leaving off %c higher.
Outside buying started provisions firm.
Toward the latter part of the session there was
moderate packing house Felling, which started
prices downward. July pork closed 7&c loweÂ»
and lard 5c and ribs 5c lower.

WEDDED TO
AVOID WORSE
Romance and Tragedy in
a Divorce Suit.
SOLDIER FOR A HUSBAND
SEQUEL TO GRACIE TAYLOR'S
SECRET MARRIAGE.
They Separated at the Altar and
Have Never Spoken a Word
to Each Other
Since.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 23.
Just two years ago Grace M. Taylor
one of the prettiest belles In Berkeley,
was married to Arthur P. Hansen. an
employe of the ferry steamer Piedmont
at San Rafael. The wedding was a great
surprise to the friends of both parties,
and after their return to Oakland it was
kept secret for over a year, and oven at
the present time many of the young
lady's acquaintances cannot understand
how she comes to be the plaintiff In a
divorce suit.
Mrs. Grace Hansen's story appears to
be very simple, but as a matter of fact,
the little romance of the trip to San Ra
fael was only taken to avoid a tragedy,
with Arthur P. Hansen the victim. Mrs.
Hansen alleges that five minutes after
their wedding they separated and have
r.ever lived together since. Hansen has
rover contributed one cent to her sup
port, and has shown no desire to provide
her with a home or take care of her. She
therefore asks the court to grant her di
vorce and permission to become once
more Miss Graca Taylor.
Hansen tells a very sensational story.
In crose-complaint, which he has served
upon the wife's attorneys. He says that
for some inexplicable reason he was
to marry the plaintiff. Miss Taylor has
a sister named Mrs. Kelly, and on the
15th of June, 1596. Mrs. Kelly called on
Hansen with a gun. SLÂ»* declared that if
her sister, Grace, did not oecome Mrs.
Hansen without more ado she would
take such action that Mr. Hansen would
never again be bothered with affairs In
this life.
Her threat evidently had a good effect,
for five days later Mr. Hansen and Grace
went to San Rafael, where they were
quietly married. A good-by succeeded
the minister's kiss, and they have not
spoken since.
In her complaint Mrs. Hansen asks for
$25 a month alimony and such other re
lief as the court may grant. It will be
rather difficult. In view of the latest de
velopments of the Cuban matter, for any
such order to be made. Hansen is a
member of Company F, Fifth Infantry-,
which has just been ordered into active
eervice. Next Monday he will leave his
job on the Piedmont, where he is get
ting a fair salary, and enter the service
of his country at $15 60 a month and ra
tions. He has shown an inclination not
to press the contest, and Mrs. Hansen
â¢will probably get her divorce without
much trouble.
The plaintiff is a petite woman, not
yet 21 year* of ago, plthough she has th*
appearance of a pretty school girl of 17.
EXAMINING COMPANY F.
Men Are Ordered to Quit Jobs by
Next Saturday.
OAKLAND, June 23.â The members of
Company F are now being examined by
Prs. Dunn and Hamlin and, although
the test is severe, there are very few
disqualified. The boys have been told
that they must vacate their situations
by Saturday night, as they will probably
be ordered into camp next Monday. There
â will be no difficulty In recruiting to the
full number of 106, as there is a big emer
gency roll.
Captain Wenk has been notified that
only single young men are desired. When
the troops go into camp they will prob
ably rendezvous on the Pierce tract at
Piedmont.
COMPANY G.
Active Work Being Done to Prepare
It to Take the Field.
ALAMEDA, June 23.â 1n response to
the notice served on them yesterday, the
members of Company G of the Fifth

GRIEVANCE OF
A POSTMASTER
Forty People Want to Be
His Janitor.
FRIEND'S MANY FRIENDS
THEY PETITION HIM TODO THE
IMPOSSIBLE.
Is Sorry That the Civil Servioo Rules
Do Not Extend to the
Knight of the
Broom.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 23.
Postmaster-elect W. H. Friend has a
difficult problem to settle. In a few days'
time he will succeed to the office now
filled by Postmaster J. J. White, and will
enjoy a four years' reward for his loyal
servicesâ mostly In the interests of Mr.
Hilborn â to the Republican party.
The civil service law goes to extremes
In the matter of the Oakland postoffice,
and presumably all other offices of like |
class. It makes possible a change with j
every administration in the postmaster- '
ship and the assistant postmastership j
and then secures everybody else In his |
position until the janitor is reached, and
he goes in and out with the occupants
of the White House.
Mr. Friend long ago decided that the
assistant should be Charles O. Alexander,
a young Republican of this city, who is
at present secretary of the \V. R. Davis
campaign committee. There were sev
eral applications and bitter fights made
for this place, but it was a foregone con
clusion, even before Mr. Friend's nomina
tion was sent to the Senate, that Mr.
Alexander was to have the place.
The appointment of the assistant was
comparatively easy compared to the task
of harmoniously filling the janitorship.
This position is worth $45 a month, and
Mr. Friend is now in possession of thirty
nine petitions from various applicants, all
sgned by prominent Republicans, and he
signed by prominent Republicans, and he
ia at a loss whom to appoint.
"This $45 a month job," said Mr. Friend,
"is actually making me sick of politics.
The task of naming an assistant was
child's play compared to this. I go Into
office in a few days and have not yet
tilled the Important position of janitor.
I have been working, or. rather, have been
worked for three .months on behalf of
one or another of nearly half a hundred
candidates, and I am seriously consider
ing the proposition of calling a conven
tion of the friends of the various candi
dates and of appointing any one candidate
on whom they can all agree."
W. H. Friend was chairman of the old
Third District Congressional Committee
that made such a notable fight for recog
nition in the State convention, but was
turned down In the national convention
two years ago.

STRATEGY OF
IRA BISHOP
Prevented the Colonel's
Trip to Fruitvale.
NO CHANCE FOR MR. STONE
TWO RAILROAD MANAGERS
COMPETE FOR NICKELS.
Courtesy of the Haywards Electric
Road Not Accepted and the
Syndicate Gets the
Plum.
Oakland Office of San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 23.
Ira P. Bishop, manager of the large
street-railroad system of the Realty
Syndicate, is a politician. He accom
plished a victory yesterday which shows
he is a natural strategist. As a result his
company will within the next six months
net a sum of anywhere between ten and
a hundred thousand dollars In nickels.
Yesterday afternoon Colonel Park Hen
shaw, who will command the new regi
ment of California Volunteers, came to
this city to inspect sites available and
commendable for a military camp. Most
of these sites are located on the Pied
mont lines of the syndicate. Another is
located where it can be reached by
the Haywards electric road as well as
those of the syndicate. Mr. Bishop kindly
placed a special car at the disposal of
Colonel Henshaw and the Board of Trade
directors. Andy Stone, manager of the
Haywards road, did not discover until
noon yesterday that the company was to
start on its tour of inspection from the
â¢office of Prison Director Fitzgerald. He
wont at the appointed time, but only to
discover that Mr. Bishop had piloted the
company to his Piedmont car. Mr. Stone
then told the gentlemen that at the con
clusion of the Piedmont trip he would
have a special car at Thirteenth and
Broadway ready to take them to see the
large Brugulere tract at Frultvale.
The party started toward the Piedmont
hills, Mr. Bishop was pilot and passe par
tout for the occasion. He saw beauty
everywhere and camp sites occasionally.
He took particular trouble to have the
special car slacked up whenever there
was the slightest excuse for doing so. Mr.
Bishop was a fund of information. He told
little stories, dilated on the Bushrod Park
site, the many good features of Blair
Park, and also of the advantages of the
Pierce place in North Oakland.
As the inspection proceeded the com
pany passed the Piedmont baths. Mr.
Bishop invited them all to inspect the in
terior of the institution. Some time was
spent doing this, and It was nearly 4
o'clock. At that time the special car of
the Haywards line was waiting at the ap
pointed place.
Some one happened to suggest that it
was about time to return. But Mr. Bishop
stifled tiie suggestion, and it is said ac
tually proposed that all the gentlemen
should take a bath at his expense. This,
however, was declined, but Mr. Bishop's
little stories consumed several more min
utes before the car was reached. Colonel
Henshaw said that if the military camp
were located on the Pierce place it would
be necessary to have a convenient resi
dence near by for the headquarters of the
officers.
Mr. Bishop highly approved the colonel's
idea. He had, several nouses in his mind,
and proceeded at once to take the com
pany with him to inspect them.
And all this time the special car of the
Haywards line was waiting at Thirteenth
and Broadway.
After the inspection of the houses Colo
nel Henshaw referred to the fact that it
was nearly 5 o'clock and tTiat he must re
turn to the city. The company returned,
and as it reached Thirteenth and Broad
way they sighted the car kindly placed at
their disposal by Andy Stone. There was
no time then to take a trip to Fruitvale,
and Colonel Henshaw returned to San
Francisco, stating that he believed the
Pierce site would be accepted.
Tho waitrhg car was ordered home, and
to-day Ira P. Bishop is "mentioned" as
a suitable candidate for Governor. But
for his great interest in Colonel Henshaw
his company might have had to share a
wealth of nickels with Mr. Stone's com
pany.

A salesman who travels for a Bridgeport, Conn., factory reports
that he has always been subject to colds caught from exposure in
draf ty places. " I used to muffle myself up no end," he says, " and yet
my head and throat were continually stuffed up and I was hoarse as a
crow. I was waiting at Plainfield Junction for a train one day ancj
wet a man who gave me a
Ripans Tabule

he says, " I always keep the TABULES by me and take one at the

GRAND JURY
REPORTS ON
THE DELAY
Considers the "Hall of
Justice" Case.
IT IS PAST UNDERSTANDING
SUCH IS THE OPINION AND NO
REMEDY IS FOUND.
Suggestion That the "Brick Inspec
tor" Be Discharged â Members
Grieve at Newspaper
Criticisms.
A report was filed by the Grand Jury
yesterday. It related to the delay in the
construction of the Hall of Justice and
on the subject of "delay" was an able
treatise, but failed to suggest a remedy
by which the long-existing and ever
present evil could be remedied. When
the report had received its tinal inspection
by the various members of the Grand
Jury that body informed Presiding Judge
Belcher that it was ready to report. A
majority of the members entered, and
tho court was informed by Foreman
Hecht that the Grand Jury had a
grievance. He presented an article pub
lished in The Call on the 17th lnst., in
whioh the effort of the Grand Jury in
the investigation of gross frauds prac
ticed in the construction of the new
forry depot was characterized as a weak
kneed investigation. After reading the
article to the court Mr. Hecht stated that
in his opinion the jury had been criticized
without cause.
"Must we submit?" interrogated Fore
man Hecht. "Can the court take official
cognizance of this unjust criticism? Is
there any protection for grand jurors -as
a body from such attacks in the news
papers, or are they obliged to submit to
them? Cannot the court protect grand
jurors from a repetition of the attack?"
In answer to the plea Judge Belcher re
plied: "Freedom of speech and liberty of
the p^ess Is the scope granted especially
in this country, and the vast influence the
exercises as censor of public morals
and critic of acts of public officials can
do naught but good. There is nothing in
such criticisms of which a court could
take official notice. There is nothing on
which to base an order to show cause.
It is not within the province of the Grand
Jury as a body to take cognizance of
such publications, but any grand juror
who feels himself individually aggrieved
may take personal action."
The court then advised the Grand Jury
to go the even tenor of its wayâ to go
ahead fearlessly and conscientiously and
pay no attention to newspaper criticisms,
just or unjust. The report was then
filed and the Grand Jury returned to its
rooms.
In the report the Grand Jury found
that in the year 1595 the Board of Super
visors decided to tear down the old mu
nicipal bunding. On January 6, 1596, plans
were advertised for, architects responded
with alacrity, and in a short time a suit
able plan was accepted. Then came de
lay. The Grand Jury lays considerable
of this blame at the door of the Board
of Supervisors. It states that the build
ing committee of that body delayed in
having the debris of the old building re
moved. This resulted in an extension of
time being granted Bateman Bros., who
received the contract to erect the build
ing. The last extension of time expires
October 1 of this year, and the Grand
Jury deplores the slothlike progress of
the constructors. In the report it is
stated that the Hall of Justice was vis
ited several times by the body since its
appointment, and at no time prior to Oc
toher 9, the date of the Grand Jury in
vestigation, was there a mechanic in the
building.
At one time a few men were found put
ting up a sample ceiling and removing old
lumber, but a general spirit of inactivity
prevailed. The Grand Jury had examined
all officials whosp duty it was to see to
the speedy completion of the building,
but had been unable to arrive at the
cause of delay. One of tne members of
the Building Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, when questioned as to the
reasons for the delay and continued
granting of time extension, stated that it
was the best that could be uone. It was
also his opinion that the contract was il
legal. This Jast fact was the occasion of
much surprise to the Grand Jury, as
"that member" of the Building Commit
tee had voted "aye" on nine different oc
casions to make payments ftn the very
contracts he considered illegal.
The Grand Jury also found that up to
June 13, 1898, $8818 had been paid on prog
ress estimate? of (105.600, and also that
during the whole period since the work
co/nmenced on the building, notwith
standing weeks and months when no la
bor was performed, a superintend
ent of construction had been employed at
a salary of $250 a month, and another offi
cial bearing the title of "inspector of
bricks" at IS a day.
The delay is past the understanding of
the Grand Jury, which points to the
r:Â» p:Â«l completion of many of the largest
private buildings in this city, but no sug
gestion is offered, excep' mat the law be
taken advantage of and the work of con
struction be taken from the hands of the
contractors and placed in those of the
proper officials. It is then suggested.
somewhat in the spirit that a panacea for
all existing evils had been discovered,
that the office of "brick inspector" be
abolished, and that the "brick inspector"
go out with his office.

AGENT TROY IS WANTED
* .'â â¢â 
DEBT COLLECTORS AND GOLD
HUNTERS ANGRY.
' . -; â 
H. Zadig and W. J. Laymance Went
to the Rescue and the Steamer
Dirlgo Will Sail To-Day
for St. Michael.
The Alaska Trading and Transporta
tion Company (Swiftwater Bill's ven
ture) has gone into eclipse and a hundred
angry gold-hunters were hunting in vain
for the man who sold them tickets for
Dawson by the steamer Dlrigo all day
yesterday. The matter has in a measure
been straightened out by H. Zadig and
W. H. Laymance, owners of the river
steamer City of Dawson, and the Dirigo
with that vessel in tow will get away to
morrow, 6ut nevertheless C. P. Troy, the
man who sold the tickets, is very much
in demand.
Two or three months ago the Alaska )
Trading and Transportation Company |
was formed and Swiftwater Bill started i
for the Yukon to take charge of the |
concern's interests there. With him went i
a man named James and a party of men
and women. At Skaguay there was a
disagreement and the gold-hunters de
cided to stay *with James. For his part
Swiftwater Bill paid over to James $1000,
which was to be used in paying the tram
way charges on the men's belongings to :
Lake Bennett. Instead of paying the bills ,
the money was used in a wild debauch, i
and the tramway company is still hold- j
ing the men's outfits in lieu of $1500
charges. A draft for that sum was given j
by James on the company here, but it
was dishonored, and the tramway is still j
looking for its money.
H. Zadig, the stock broker, is the owner j
of the river steamer Thomas Dwyer and j
\V. J. Laymance, the real estate man of j
Oakland, "is Swiftwater Bill's representa- j
tive here. Zadig entered into a contract
with Swiftwater Bill through Laymance
to deliver to Dawson 3X) tons of \
merchandise this season at $200 a ton.
Having this as a basis upon which to I
work, Zadig thought he could take up a j
certain number of passengers and addi- j
tional freight, so he secured Troy as a j
ticket agent and gave him $3dO with
which to pay the rent of tin office on the
corner of Sutter and Montgomery streets, i
The office was furnished on credit and I
then Troy chartered the steamer Dirigo j
to tow the City of Dawson to St. Mich- |
ael and also to take up all the passen- I
gers secured by the Alaska Trading and .
Transportation Company. j
A deposit was paid on the vessel and I
the work of selling tickets began. All j
went well until the time for making the ,
forfeit on the Dirigo good and then the ;
trouble began. J. S. Kimbali & Co., own
era of the vessel, demanded their money
and sundry other bills began to pour in i
upon Mr. 'Troy. Those who had pur
chased tickets began to clamor for the '
return of their money, and one big Swede i
put a six-shooter on the counter and gave !
Troy three minutes to refund him nls i
$150 The money was forthcoming. W ed- ,
nesday night the office on the corner of j
Sutter and Montgomery streets was ;
closed and Troy has not been seen since.
Yesterday a man presented himself with
a bill of "sale for the office furniture, but
the clerk refused to give up a stick until
bis salary was paid. Finally he gave up ,
all but the office desk, and that he took ;
away in payment of his claim.
Things were now in such a tangle that i
no one seemed able to straighten th^m
out. Kimbali & Co. were the big losers,
as matters stood, while the passengers
who had purchased tickets seemed to I
have no recourse. It was then that
Messrs Zadig and Laymance showed
their quality. They found out exactly
the number of tickets that were sold and â¢
paid over the money for them .to Kir- :
ball & Co. The ticket-holders were then i
sent to the office of the owners of the j
Dirigo and that firm took up the old tick
etfl and issued new ones for them. If the i
repairs to the City of Dawson's engines j
are completed to-morrow the expedition j
will get away. If not the start will be de
layed until Sunday.
"The Dirigo has been ready to start for
Seattle for two weeks," said J.. S. Kim
bali yesterday. "When the time came to
put up the money called for by the con
tract Mr. Troy did not respond and then
the trouble began. We could get no sat
isfaction nut of him and were besieged by
people daily, who wanted to know when
the vessel would sail. Then Messrs. Za
dig and Laymance came to the rescue
and everything has been put on a satis- |
factory basis. The, engines of the City of |
Dawson did not work properly and the j
contractor has to make some alterations, j
As soon as she is ready the Dirigo will j
make a start."
Swiftwater Bill seems to be unlucky in j
both matrimonial and business ventures.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT.
The steamer Hermosa, which arrived
from Seattle yesterday, ran away from
the Sound to escape from infuriated gold
hunters who had purchased tickets foi
St. Michael by her. The Hermosa used
to run between Santa Barbara and the
Catalina Iqlands, but when the Klondike
rush began last year she came up here
and was fitted out for that trade. I^ast
month some Seattle parties chartered her
and put up a deposit, but no more money
was forthcoming as sailing day ap
proached. Seeing a storm arising the
owner of the vessel gave Captain Lars
son a wink and that bold navigator got
up steam during the night and came
post haste to San Francisco. When the
Klondiken who bad purchased tickets by
the Hermosa reached the wharf next
morning their vessel was gone.
The little schooner Saga, which arrived
here from liarbadoes yesterday, is in
trouble. She has no register, and the
captain sailed with his passengers with
only an open Ict4er from the American
Consul at Bridgetown. This document is
valueless, and the vessel has neither a
registry nor a flag, so the customs au
thorities are in a quandary what to do
with her. The matter has been sub
mitted to the Secretary of the Treasury.
Mrs. Doby of 5 Freelon street will prob
ably lose her life from a peculiar accident.
She was hanging out some clothes when
the pulley broke and the weight of the
articles on the line pulled her into the
yard, sixteen feet below. She was taken
to the Harbor Receiving Hospital where
Dr. Stafford treated her for broken shoul
der blade and probable fracture of the
base of the sku!l. She is a very heavy
woman, weighing over 200 pounds.
The river steamers Saldie and Dawson
City sailed for the Yukon yesterday. The
Saidie is the Alaska Commercial Com
pany's river tug. while the Dawson City
takes north a party of gold hunters.

CORNELL AN
EAST WINNER
Intercollegiate Boat Race
a Procession.
YALE FAR AHEAD OF HARVARD
SLOWEST TIME MADE FOR SEV
ERAL YEARS.
In the Freshman Racs, Yale Defeats
Harvard and Cornell After a
Most Exciting Contest.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
NEW LONDON, Conn., June 23.â The
great intercollegiate aquatic contests
which for months have been looked for
ward to by thousands took place to
day and the results again place Cor
nell on the pedestal of fame as the
champion university crew of America,
and to the freshmen of Yale belongs
the honor of success in the triangular
race with the youngsters of Harvard
and Cornell.
The two races were strikingly incon
sistent with each other in that the one
stands as a perfect antithesis of the
other. The university race, which was
rowed down stream at 12:30 this after
noon, was a procession of the first class,
while the freshman contest was a battle
royal.
The first race was uninteresting, ex
cept to Cornellians. after the first quar
ter of a mile hai been rowed. The
slight lead which Yale secured at the
start was then taken away by Cornell
at this point and Courtney's men were
not again headed.
The eight of fair Harvard were never
in the race. Prettier form and water
ship has never been seen in America
than that presented by Captain Colson
and his Cornell crew throughout the
four miles of the race. The work of
Yale, the second crew, is capable of
characterization as first-class when
not subjected to the deadly parallel
with Cornell. Harvard was never a
factor in the running.
The time of the winning crew as given
by the race officials was 23 minutes 48
secondsâ the slowest time made in a
university race for several years â but
this is attributed to a head wind and
the fact that Cornell was not forced.
Yale crossed the finish line 14 seconds
behind the champions, while the trail
ing Harvard eight rested on their oars
33 seconds later.
If the university race of the early
afternoon was tame as a contest the
freshman race, which was started at
5:03, was thrilling to the last degree.
Every yard of the course was fought
viciously and the result was in doubt
until the second Yale rushed across the
line winner in the official time of
11:22 2-6.
The three freshman crews of Yale,
Harvard and Cornell rowed one of the
best races ever seen on the Thames
this afternoon. Yale won, but Harvard
spurted at the finish and was so close
a second that only a few feet separated
the two crews, while the boat of the
Cornell crew was opposite No. 7 of Har
vard's crew. It was a royal battle
from atart to finish, with Cornell lead
ing at first, Yale catching her at the
one mile and Harvard maKing a grand
rally and beating out Cornell at the
line. Considering the weather condi
tions with the wind blowing strong up
stream and the tide also running in
that direction, the time was fast, al
though the slowest since 1892. Every
one of the freshmen came over the line
in the very best condition. The race
was called for 3 o'clock, but a strong
wind caused a postponement and it was
5:05 when the pistol was fired. Harvard
caught the water first and shot ahead
about three feet. Cornell, however, was
right after the Cambridge eight and
with the first ten strokes had drawn
up even and then passed her. Harvard
rowed about 34 at the start, Cornell 32
and Yale 35. The race to the first half
mile was very close, Cornell being in
the lead, with her rivals both lapped
on her quarter.
Yale, however, put In a good spurt
just before the mile was reached and
passed Harvard. At the first mile Yale
crept up even with Cornell and the two
crews swept by the mark with abso
lutely no difference between them,
while Harvard was not over a quarter
of a length behind. The next stroke
after the crews crossed the mile flag
put Yale a foot In the lead, but Cor
nell recovered in the next ani. In the
half mile following the crews alter
nated, first one showing ahead and then
the other, while Harvard seemed con
tent to have the nose of her shell at
No. 7 oar of the Cornell boat. Just as
the shells went by the one and a half
mile mark Yale succeeded in getting
the nose of her boat beyond Cornell's
and held it there. Then came the finish,
and such a finish has not been seen on
the water for many a year. Harvard's
cockswain called on his crew and they
responded nobly, with a spurt that put
them almost on even terms with Cor
nell.
At another eighth of a mile from the
finish line Cornell put on another spurt
and established a alight lead over Har
vard but could not catch Yale. Again
the Harvard cockswain called on his
men and the shell jumped this time
well beyond Cornell and with the line
only a few yards distant the Cambridge
crew had taken second place and pluck
ily started after Yale. Inch by inch
they gained, pulling a dashing stroke
that sent the boat through the water
without a hitch, but the finish line was
not quite far enough away, and with
Harvard's boat at Yale s No. 2 and
Cornell's boat at Harvard's No. 8 the
crews sped over the line and Yale had
won.

DEMOCRATS
ARE DELVING
INTO HISTORY
Engaged In Searching for Proto
types of the Three Tailors
From Tooley Street.
Wastebasket Record of Maximilian "Parkhurst"
Popper, the Sometime Boss and Present
Since It was announced In these col
umns that the Three Tailors of Tooley
Street had come to life in the persons
of "Whispering" Gavin McNab, Frank
"Hood" Gould and William "Hallucina- j
tion" Alford, and that they had con- j
stituted themselves the Democratic
party of San Francisco, a new dignity I
has attached to the persons of the three
Illustrious gentlemen.
Knowledge of the fact that they hold
a warranty deed to the local Democracy
besides holding the world and Mayor
Phelan in trust for the benefit of all to
whom these presents may come, has
had the effect of casting a gloom over
the lives of all who are so unfortunate
as not to have a speaking acquaintance
with the members of the unholy trinity.
Those politicians who hope to be in the
Bwim have been turning their attention
to the study of history with the hope
that they may find among the great
men of the past some one to whom the
Three Disgraces of the present may be
likened.
Little success has attended the effort
to find the prototype of William "Hal
lucination" Alford, the inspired school
boy of Tulare. His closest friends agree
In saying that he is a living refutation
of the axiom, "All men are created
equal." It is as if Nature, In a lavish
mood, created him and then destroyed
the design. His dreams regarding his
fitness to occupy the gubernatorial
chair and his half-waking reveries con-
cerning the attorneyship of the Board
of State Harbor Commissioners are
striking instances of his singularity.
"I wonder if dreams come true" is with
him a favorite and frequent soliloquy.
With Frank "Hood" Gould, the indi
rect descendant of the merry wag of
Sherwood forest, the case is different.
He has been likened to the illustrious
Colonel Pride who was sent by Crom
well to take care of the obstreperous
members of the Long Parliament. He
has, in fact, gone the doughty colonel
one better, and instead of taking the
strife makers of the local Democratic
Parliament into camp he has chopped

Reformer.
their heads off and created a limp
ing Parliament of his own. Thus doth
the world progress.
The very top shelf of ancient his
tory must be drawn upon to find the
like of "Whispering" Gavin McNab.
He has been likened to the lean and
hungry Cassius of Caesar's time, be
cause, like him, he seldom sleeps and
never smiles. Had he lived in the
time of the Roman republic he would
have schemed and conspired with Cat
aline, and had he lived in Athens he
would have plotted day and night with
Alcibiades. Had he been the ancestor
instead of the descendant of "Smooth**
John EfcNab he would have conspired
with the Red Comyn and the false
Monteith to deliver Sir William Wal
lace over to the bloody vengeance of
Edward Plantagenet. As it is he is
the king-pin of the trio of world beat
ers, and, like Charity â with due apolo
gies â he is "the greatest of these."
An apologry is due to Colonel Black
Bart Burke, the recent arrival from
Santa Cruz and a member of the sa
cred band of One Hundred and Three,
for omitting his name from the list of
nominees for Superior Judge. His is
a name that cannot help being a tower
of strength to any cause. The travel
ing public has ever dearly loved it and
many a stage driver has drawn inspir
ation from it while traversing the
mountain ranges on the road to Devil's
Gulch and Bitter Creek.
It is admitted on all sides that the
most brilliant star in the constellation
so hurriedly swept together by the om
nipotent hands of the Three Disgraces
is Maximilian "Parkhurst" Popper, the
speediest reformer on the track of of
fice. There are several close second:*,
a few third choices and a goodly hum 1\
of "also rans," but there is but one
Popper, and he is a crackerjack. Once
upon a time, before the coming of the
Three Wise Guys from Anywhere, he
was a boss himself. Now he is a re
former â that is to say, a sort of seams
tress in the trinity tailor shop of the
gentlemen from Tooley street. Because
be is a reformer after being shorn of
such great power he has been likened
to certain members of the French
demi-monde, who, after their charms
have taken wings, retire from the
world and atone for the follies of their
youth by endowing institutions of piety
and learning.
In the oarly part of June, 1894, this
up-to-date Parkhurst made a speech
at Metropolitan Hall. In the course of
his address he had occasion to refer
to the corruption that has marked the
administration of affairs in this city
and he frankly confessed that he had
been, "as deep in the mud as anybody
had been in the mire." Some irrever
ent youth in the gallery replied:
"That's so, Maxey."
Like all great men Popper has made
mistakes. One of these was his con
fession at a well-remembered meeting
of the Tea and Toast Club thai he had
secured favors at the hands of certain
Supervisors at a cost to himself of $650
per month. Commenting on this con
fession the yellow mouthpiece of the re
habilitated Democracy said: "He ought
to be prosecuted for being guilty of one
of the most atrocious crimes in the
catalogue of iniquity, a crime which
is a species of treason, destroying the
very mainspring of government." The
same saffron mouthpiece later spoke of
the reformer in this wise: "His in
ability to realize that he has been doing
wrong makes weird and almost awe
inspiring the nonchalance with which
he admits things which qualify him for
San Quentin." Still later the same
paper exclaims that "the grand jurors
who were present in court at the con
clusion of the hearing which granted
to Parkhurst Popper immunity for his
failure to answer certain questions,
seemed almost to hear his insolent
question: 'What are you going to do
about it?' "
But this is ancient history and does
not enter into the qualifications re
quired by the Three Tailors of Tooley
Street.

REOPENING THE LOUVRE.
Artisans Have Made the Old Estab-
lishment Like a Moorish
Dream.
After being closed for alterations for
several weeks the Louvre, on the cor
ner of Powell and Eddy streets, re
opened at noon yesterday and for the
balance of the day Mr. Bogen, the pro
prietor, was the recipient of congrat
ulations from numberless friends for
the notable improvements he has made
in this popular cafe. The entire es
tablishment, which has an area of
140x60 feet, has been remodeled in the
rich style of Moorish architecture ex
emplified by the old Alhambra Palace
of Spain. Artistically in the huge apart
ment stand the supporting columns,
and this colonnade with Moorish capi
tals ranges the length and breadth of
the room. No pains have been spared
to make the effect and coloring har
monious as to tinting and pleasing to
the eye. The coloring effect is worked
in vermilion, with cobalt blue for the
groundwork, with high lights of gold
leaf upon the relief portions.
The Moorish style has been faith
fully reproduced and it is doubtful
whether in this country a more perfect
type of this style of architecture has
been executed.
The flooring and wainscoting can- j
not be equaled in the city, and the firm j
of Mangrum & Otter of 27 New Mont- i
gomery street, which makes a specialty
Of this kind of work, has at the Louvre :
created its masterpiece. The floor is
of vitreous tile in blue and white and
the wainscoting is pink onyx enam- ;
eled. The entire 11,000 square fleet of |
floor space is covered with enamel, j
making the lower parts impervious to !
moisture, hard as flint and perfectly
sanitary.
The plaster decorations and plastic
relief were done by J. P. McMurry of
10 Fulton street. This was extremely i
difficult, as the work is all in relief. Ar- i
tists say that no improvement could
be made on it.
The construction of the bar, bar fix
tures, cigar stand and ice chest was in
the hands of John Furness, whose of
fice is at the Builders' Exchange. The
fixtures are all of polished mahogany
and in a style to harmonize with the
Moorish effects. Mr. Furness also put
in the art glass work and prepared the
basement for the other artisans. A
large portion of the entire work has
been done under contract by Mr. Fur
ness and is of a high character of work
manship.
Mr. Bogen, the proprietor. Is one of
the best-known caterers In the city and
he resolved to make the old L.ouvre the
most popular and artistic establishment
of the kind on the coast. This is proved
by the beautiful dpcorations and his
having placed in the center of the room
a grand stand for the orchestra, which
will be undpr the direction of Professor
John Marquardt. There will be music
there every evening.

PUT THE BABY OUT IN THE COLD.
Little Frank White, Shivering and Naked, Found a
Welcome Friend in a Policeman.
The police discovered a case of cruelty to a child yesterday, and the per
son guilty of the crime was the baby's own mother. Little Frank
White, four years of age, aroused the people in the vicinity of 11 Pol
lard place by his cries at 3 o'clock in the morning, and investigation showed
that the boy had been thrust out into the street with nothing on but a night
gown. The little fellow was shivering with the cold, and his helpless con
dition caused him to immediately make friends with Officer Hutcnings, who
was called to the place. The policeman cuddled the shivering child in his
arms and carried him to the station.
"When asked why he was out at that time of the morning the child, who
is remarkably bright for his age, replied, "Mother put me out." The next
question, "Do you want to go back to your mother?" brought the quick re
sponse, "No, no; I would rather go to papa."
The boy was taken to the Central police station and given In charge of
the matron.
Officer Hutchings knocked at the door of the house where the boy
claimed his mother was, and after some time succeeded in arousing the
woman, whom he placed under arrest, charging her with cruelty to her
child. From Mrs. White it was learned that she and her husband had quar
reled about 12 o'clock, and that he had left the house. On his departure the
heartless mother put the baby into the street, where it remained for nearly
three hours before found.
The police were searching for the father of the child when he walked
Into the California street police station, inquiring about his â¢wife. Officer
White Informed aim that the woman had been transferred to the Central
6tation, and added that as he seemed so anxious to see her he would be
given an opportunity. The officer then booked him on the same charge
which had been placed against the mother.
The father of the boy Is named John White, and is employed as a jani
tor. The neighbors say he is a hard-working man, and when sober a very
good fellow, but it is said that he and his wife both drink, and when under
i the influence of liquor both are violent. Quarrels have been numerous dur
ing the past two years, and it is claimed that the child has been fearfully
i abused. One of the little legs has been broken, and it is believed that this
i was done by a blow from one of the parents, though they claim that it was
i the result of an accident.

CHIEF LEES
REMEMBERS
RELATIVES
To Do So He Creates a
Needless Office.
NEPHEW WOLFE CARED FOR
GIVEN A SOFT POSITION IN
THE CITY PRISON.
Detective Seymour Does the Work
Required and Wolfe Remains
on the City Pay Roll.
When Bret TT.trte mam- years ago wrote
his now world-wide known lines:
For wnys that are dark and tricks that are
vain
The heathen CMnee is peculiar,
He was not acquainted with the senile
but gold-laced Chief of Police of San
Franciscoâ l'm Wealthy Lees. Had Harte
been acquainted with the undistinguished
but shortly-to-be extinguished Chief of
our local thief-catchers he would un
doubtedly have given him prominence in
stead of the "Heathen Chinee."
The ways of Chief Lees have been dark j
and the tricks he is now resorting to are j
vain. He is a great reader and lover of
music. He is particularly fond of chin
musicâ especially so when he Is the mu
sician. When not engaged in the haz
ardous task of "throwing himself Into a
hack" to follow a hot clew that might
lead to the unsolving of the mystery of
the murder of Eugene Ware in the St.
Nicholas pharmacy, within a stone's
throw of his office, he surrenders to mu
sic and literature. One day in the course
of his literary and musical studies he
came across a piece entitled "The Wolf
Is at the Door." A few days later he
found another reference to the wolf. It |
was the simple story of the boy who
amused himself by crying "wolf" just to
see his neighbors run, as did the valiant
star-wearers on the day Lieutenant
Burke was shot to death by the tinker
Haynes on Bernal Heights. That boy
cried "wolf" so often that on the day the
wolf came no one went to his assistance â
like in the case of Burke â and he was
killed. So it was that Chief Lees became
imbued with the idea that the "wolf"
Htnrii-s should' be given the quietus once
and for all. He remembered that he had
a nephew named Wolfe, a young fellow !
who was only drawing $100 a month from
the city treasury. Now he didn't want
to see that particular Wolfe at the
door, and by his order the "door" was
openedâ the door of the City Prisonâ and
Wolfe took the place of Captain Robertson,
who found it necessary to go East "for
his health" and incidentally avoid a lit
tle unpleasantness. Robertson occupied
the position of captain of the prisonâ a
position won by him through having placed
several othrr star-wearers in dangerous
proximity to the resort at San Quentin,
managed by the State. The "vacant
chair" was large enough for the Lees
Wolfe, but the Lees Wolfe was not large
enough to hold it down. It takes more
than the weight of the influence of a I
Chief L^es to hold down the management
of theÂ»City Prison. Something had to be

done. Nephew Wolfe, who had been pro
moted to the rank of sergeant with an In
crease of $25 a month salary, could not be
displaced, and some one had to assist him
in holding his position and his salary.
Detective Ben Bohen, one of the clever
est men ever in the department, had been
elevated to the office of Captain of De
tectives when Captain Lees went to the
front to attempt to occupy* in a decidedly
unsatisfactory way the office vacated by
the retirement of Chief Crowley. Chief
Lees soon found that Nephew Wolfe
would have to abdicate the throne in the
City Prison unless given assistance. He
was in a worse position than the Span
ish fleet. The Spanish fleet is bottled up,
while Wolfe is in danger of Wowing out
of the soft billet he now holds in the City
Prison.
Chief Lees is a great thinker and he
rested for a day or two from the work
of preparing explanations to be given the
public, why the thugs, burglars and sand
nag artists who have boon doing a thriv
ing business since he has been at the
head of the Police Department have not
been caught. He thought of how success
ful he had been in the work of suppressing
the scandal that attended the "vacation"'
and retirement of Captain Robertson and
the subsequent promotion of Nephew
Wolfe. He finally hit upon a plan. It was
to have an Assistant Chief of Detectives,
with rank of captain, the said assistant
to look after the general management of
the City Prison and allow Nephew Wolfe
to hold on to his soft position and large
and unearned salary.
Detective Seymour w:is selected to hold
the nominal position of Assistant Chief
and do the work of prison management.
No one has ever questioned the ability
or integrity of either Bohen or Seymour.
They are both competent men and any
duty ever intrusted to them has been suc
cessfully carried out.
The pertinent question is why there
should be an Assistant ChjÂ»f of Detec
tives unless his duties are simply to look
after Nephew Wolfe. No one would dis
pute or question the fitness of appoint
ing, for the present, an Assistant Chief
of Police, with full power to act in lieu
of the present senile occupant of that
important office.
An Assistant Chief of Police with vest
ed powers, as suggested, is absolutely
necessary. There is no need of an As
sistant Chief of Detectives. It was an
office that was sorely needed when I'm
Wealthy Lees presided over the detective
branch of the department.
Had Detective Seymour or Detective
Bob Hogan. who knew so much more
than the then Captain of Detectives Lees
that he had to be relegated to the Dis
trict Attorney's office to do clerical work
In order that he mipht drop from the
view of the public, who appreciated his
clever work, been chosen Assistant Chief
of Detectives some years ago, the tax
payers would have applauded.
With an Assistant Captain of Detec
tives who could do detective work it
would have been known long before this
who it was that murdered Eugene Ware
in the St. Nicholas pharmacy. Durrant
has been hanged for the butchery of Min
nie Williams and Blanche Lament In the
Emmanuel Baptist Church, but no one be
lieves him the slayer of Eugene Ware.
With an assistant Captain of Detectives,
when Chief Lees presided over the des
tinies of the detective department, the
mystery of the Harrington murder would
undoubtedly have been solved. Then
again, if there had been an assistant
Captain of Detectives when Blanther
committed his foul crime he would have
been arrested before he got over the State
line and thus prevented adding suicide to
his other crime. With an assistant Cap
tain of Detectives when Isaac Hoffman
was found dying- on the floor of his office
on Battery street the police would have
looked for proof that was not alone in
tended to sustain the Lees theory of sui
cide. Some years ago, the department
was sadly in need of an assistant Captain
of Detectives. That time has passed,
however. Captain Bohen is fully able to
look after the affairs of the department
and the time of Assistant Captain of De
tectives Seymour should not be taken up
in the work of assisting Nephew Wolfe
to manage the City Prison.
With either Hogan, Seymour or Bohen
at the head of the Detective Department,
even in the capacity of assistant, with
power to direct, something might have
been found out concerning the looting 01
the Property Clerk's office and the carry
ing off of most of the "evidence" against
the Eastern safe crackers, Randall, Hintz
and Thomas, who so successfully operated
here when they followed in the wake of
the Knights Templar conclave. Eight
members of the most successful gang of
safe blowers and pickpockets that ever
worked, came here. Five of them got
off again with the most of the plunder.
The others evidently felt conscience
stricken and waited behind to be ar
rested by the then Captain of Detectives
Lees. Had they been inclined to be mean,
they might have rented a room in a
building next to the old City Hall and
there been safe from the detection of Cap
tain of Detectives LePs.
An assistant Captain of Detectives was
then neededâ not now.
The assistant captain is only required
to help out Nephew Wolfe. \\ lthoiw Help
he is hopelessly lost in his new job.
Then again there is the Jacobson murder
case that has never been satisfactorily
solved. Sydney Bell, footpad now under
going a life sentence at Folsom prison,
is charged, with the crime. He protests
his innocence, and direct proof has never
been produced to show that he tells an
untruth.
An assistant Captain of Detectives
would have been of benefit at the time of
the Jacobson murder.
To attempt to show all of the benefits
that might have accrued to the com
munity had Captain of Detectives Lees
had an assistant, who would have been
assured that if he worked diligently he
would not he stowed away like Detective
Hogan, would require too much space.
Chief Lees appreciates full well that
his official life is short. Hence his fle
slre to see his nephew, Wolfe, well taken
care of at the expense of the city.
TO CELEBRATE HIS
SILVER JUBILEE
CEEEMONY IN HONOR OF REV.
M. O'RIORDAN.
Archbishop Riordan and a Number
of Priests of the City Will
Participate in the
Solemn Rite.
Michael O'Riordan, rector of the
Church of the Nativity at Menlo Park,
will celebrate the silver jubilee of his
priesthood this morning with impressive
ceremony. Solemn high mass will be said
at 10:30 a. m. by Father O'Riordan in per
son, assisted by Father Nugent of
this city as deacon and Father Clancy of
Petaluma as sub-deacon. Rev. James
Cooper of San Mateo will officiate as mas
ter of ceremonies.
An improvized throne for Archbishop
Riordan was recently erected in the
sanctuary to the left of the main altar,
and will be occupied by him during the
ceremony of mass. The deacons of honor
to the Archbishop are Fathers Callaghan
of San Mateo and Waehem. the director of
the now seminary at Menlo Park.
The cerebration of the silver jubilee
this morning is tendered to the faithful
priest as a testimony of respect and
honor by the clergy of the Catholic
church g-enerally throughout the State.
Although born and educated abroad
Father O' Riordan is practically a Native
Son. as he came to California when a
young man, and in fact immediately af
ter his ordination as a priest.
He was born on December 19, 1850, and
received his education at the Mount Mll
leray Seminary. Upon completing his
studies at the seminary he was ordained
a priest of the Catholic church at All
Hallows College after several years of
study and teaching.
When Father O'Riordan arrived in Cal
ifornia, some time after the ceremony of
ordinat.on. he was appointed assistant
pastor of St. Joseph's Church in this city.
Later he was transferred to Stockton,
where he remained for four rears. From
Stockton the priest, ever ready in the per
formance of his duty, in answer to a sum
mons from the Archbishop, left the val
ley town and took up his residence and
new duties at^the San Rafael Orphan
Asylum, where he acted as assistant to
Rev. James Croke. In ISRI he was ap
pointed pastor of the Church of the Na
tivity at Menlo Park, where he has re
mained constantly ever since.
â¢ Immediately after the solemnization of
mass this morning a banquet will be ten
dered the aged priest by the Archbishop.
Fully fifty priests, most of whom will
come from this city, will be present. The
banquet will be held in the new semi
naxy. The morning exercises will be fol
lowed by a literary programme and a pre
sentation, which will conclude the jubilee
exercises.
