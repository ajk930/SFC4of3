MRS. CLARK
VISITS THE
MURDERER
Accompanied by a DauÂ£h=
ter, She Goes to Napa's
Jail to See Him.
Sheriff McKenzie Taking Precau=
tions to Guard Against Any
Attempt to Lynch the
Prisoner.
WERE THE OFFICERS NEGLIGENT?
NAPA, Jan. 25. â The opinion Is general that the murder of
"William Clark should have been prevented. It is contended thai
had the peace officers of St. Helena run down the attempted
poisoner of William Clark at the time the repeated attempts were
made, Clark would now be alive and his brother precisely where
he Is. It does seem that there has been Inexcusable negligence
The attempt" d poisoning: was known at the time, and it woulc
have been little trouble for the officers to discover the perp>-trn
t<>r. At least the second effort should have opened th>- â¢ y.s t<
the intended crime. They should have known that such persist
ence meant success in the end. George Clark, the murderer, is
Very Ignorant. The bungling manner in which he carried oui
his crime showed his utter lack of intelligence and the task o
proving him a poisoner would have been easy, especially as h
was suspected and openly accused by his brother.
NAPA, Jan. 25.â There was a scene
at the County Jail to-day when Mrs.
Clark, accompanied by her daughter.
Bertha, and Marshall Johnson, who had
come down from St. Helena on the
early morning train, confronted George
Clark in the Sheriff's office.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Clark stoutly
declared that "the children" certainly,
and most probably their mother, would
I .-.way fn-n' the N'apa Jail, where
r-)nrV Lt. This morning Â»he came down,
iP^nietl by one daughter, and the
reason that the other four and the two
small sons did not accompany her Is
doubtless a pecuniary on*>. The chances
an- (hat before the close of this re
markable case this characterless fam
ily v.ill be thoroughly united in spirit.
Clark himself hnsn't wit f-nough to
know when he is injured nor stamina
enough to resent an injury should he
be so unusually clever as to perceive
it.
Mrp. Clark Is taller and stouter and
stronger than George Clark. As they
stood in the Sheriff's office to-day she
looked like a lumbering schooner tow
ering over an erratic cockleshell of a
boat. Clark stands so badly, his nar
row shoulders are bent and he walks
bily, hanging his head, though
expressionless, dull, big, dark
eyes of his can meet one squarely.
}[â¢â  and Mrs. Clark shook hands and
Clark asked after the children. But
Mrs. Clark had not come down from
Ft. Helena to exchange polite common
places with her brother-in-law. She
wanted him to deny positively that she
had been implicated in the murder of
Great Eastern Building at Spokane in Which Bight Persons Were
Incinerated.
The San Francisco Call
1 her husband or had known that the
i murder was contemplated. There can
j be no questioning the influence of this
guilty woman over this guilty man.
| Yet, surprising to relate, Clark devel
j oped strength to refuse to answer her
! question.
"Won't you, won't you do this for
: me?" Mrs. Clark pleaded. "Won't you
answer the question? Won't you say
; that I hadn't anything to do with tt?"
"I won't talk any more," answered
Clark, doggedly. "I won't say any
thing without my attorneys here."
It wasn't yet 8 o'clock, but Attor
ney Hogan was rung up and called to
th.- Sheriffs office. Clark's bovine eyes
rested gratefully upon the lawyer. He
| is so easily swayed, so complete a prey
! to every intellectual tide that eddies
about him that he clings to his lawyer
with a pitiful dependence. Mrs. Clark
repeated her question, and then Clark
and his lawyer withdrew for a consul
tation.
"He's not going to answer that ques
tion nor any other," declared Attorney
i Hogan when the two emerged from the
â  inner office.
Mrs. Clark arose from her chair be
fore the fire. She put a hand on Clark's
shoulder, saying:
"Why don't you just answer that one
question? You sent for me and I came.
What did you send for me for, then?"
"Because I wanted to see you," Clark
answered.
"Well, now, won't you tell me â won't
you relieve me?" the woman coaxed.

NEW YORK, Jan. 25â A spec
ial cable to the Sun from Ha
vana says: The news has
spread in the town like wild
fire to-day that General Blanco
has gone to have a conference
with General Maximo Gomez
in order to reach an understand
ing with the Cuban commander
and establish peace in the
island. It is said here by the
Spanish authorities that this is
an unfounded report, but upon
careful investigation there is no
doubt there is something se
rious in the wind.
There is no doubt Gomez feels
inclined to offer Spain an in
demnity of $100,000,000 for the In
dependence of Cuba and that the
same idea prevails in the Cuban
Government, but It is also cer
tain that he will energetically
reject all proposals for auton
omy.
It is believed here to-day that
Blanco will send a message to
Gomez from El Jucaro before
starting to meet him. If the
Cuban leader accepts the Inter
view it will then take place at
some point near the trocha in
Santa Clara province. General
Gomez is reported to-day very
near El Jucaro.
HAVANA, Jan. 25. â The United
States battleship Maine steamed into
Havana harbor this morning and came
to anchor with no more disturbance
than attends the arrival of the Key
West mail steamers.
Signals were flown fro Morro Cas
tle at 10 o'clock that an American
steamer had been sighted, but no pub
lic attention was attracted until the
battle-ship was passing Morro Castle,
when crowds began besieging the piers.
When the Maine was almost alongside
Morro Castle she saluted the Spanish
flag with twenty-one guns. This was
respemded to by the guns of Cabanas.
The firing attracted great crowds to
the water front to view the spectacle.
A few minutes later the Maine ran up
the Spanish royal ensign and saluted
the flagship with thirteen guns. In re
sponse the Alforso XITI hoisted the
stars and stripes and returned the sa
lute gun for grin. Captain Sigsbee
then made official calls on the admiral
of the port and the captain of the Ger
man cruiser Gneisenau.
When I boarded the Maine Captain
Pigpbee told me that he was at Dry
Tortugas at 11 o'clock when the tor
pedo-boat Dupont arrived from Key
West with orders to sail. He got under
way Immediately and came over under
easy steam. He stopped outside the
harbor to take on a pilot at 2 o'clock.
Captain Sigsbee came ashore at Ma
chlna wharf unattended, and drove to
the American Consulate. The crowds
respectfully made way for him. After
the call on General Lee Captain Sigs
bee returned to the ship* Absolute
tranquillity reiens In the city.
NEW YORK, Jan. 25.â Washing
ton special to the Herald says: No
word has yet been received here con
cerning the evolutions of the fleet off
Key West. Secretary Long has finally
determined to assign the torpedo boat
flotilla to the North Atlantic squad
ron, with a view to practicing the ships
in combined maneuvers.- Orders have
been sent to Lieutenant*. Commander
W. W. Kimball. commanding the flo
tilla, directing him to report with the
vessels under his command to Rear
Admiral Sicard. and perform such serv
ice as he may direct. These orders re
voke the instructions issued to com
manding officers of the ships and to
Rear Admiral Sicard, informing them
that if they should fall in with the flo
tilla they would have no command
over it. Lieutenant Commander Kim
ball had been told, too, that the flotilla
was only under orders which he might
give.
The programme prepared contem
plated the maneuvering of the flotilla
down the Atlantic coast into the gulf,
where it would touch at gulf ports and
during the coming spring ascend the
Mississippi. This programme has of
course been abandoned as a result of
the new orders sent to the flotilla, al
though it is still possible that the tor
pedo boats may ascend the Mississippi
during spring. The assignment of the
torpedo boats to the North Atlantic
squadron, it is suggested In some quar
ters, Is due to the Cuban question. This
is true so far as it relates to the reten
tion of one of the boats at Key West,
which will convey any dispatches from
Key West to the squadron, but with
the Maine at Havana there Is no ques
tion in the minds of the officials that
there is an adequate force at Havana
to adequately protect American inter
ests. This fact tends to substantiate
the statements of officers of the depart
ment, who say the main reason the
torpedo boats have been placed under
Rear Admiral Sicard's command is
that they may engage In the maneu
vers of the squadron.

MADRID. Jan. 25â Whether It con
siders the arrival of the Maine at
Havana timely or not the <'i<>\ eminent
has decided to regard It as an expression
of good will, more so as all conditions
are so favorable and there is a firm
conviction that President McKinley
will abide stanchly by his message,

the compliment of the Maine's visit.

SPOKANE, Jan. 25.â Eight lives lost,
families broken, a mother crazed by
the loss of her two daughters and a
property loss of over a quarter of mil
lion dollarsâ that is the result of last
night's fire In the Great Eastern block.
The list of dead so far known fol
lows: Miss AliceWllson, aged 18: Mlps
Maud Wilson, her sister, aged 5; Mrs.
Rose Smith, tight-rope artist, known
as Greba, aged 20; Mrs. H. B. Davies
of Nebraska City, Nebr.. aged 72; W.
B. Gordon, mining engineer; Mrs. Cora
Peters and two daughters. Ethel and
Alma, aged 9 and 7. Mrs. Peters was
erroneously reported to-day as Mrs.
Gordon. Gordon sacrificed his life try-
Ing to save her and her children, and
It was In their rooms that he met his
death.
To-day the local Board of Fire In
surance Agents compiled an estimate
of the property lost, fixing It at $225,000.
The Insurance was $133,825. The loss
is generally believed to be far in ex
cess of the estimate, for the building
cost $250,000 only nine years ago.
Mrs. J. K. Wilson, whose home was
formerly at Tekoa. lost both of her
daughters. She has become insane over
the loss, and is being cared for at the
Protestant Sanitarium.
Mrs. EL B. Davies, who was killed
by falling to the pavement from the
fifth floor, fell In attempting to follow
her son-in-law down an electric cable.
Her hands slipped on the icy strands
and she fell headlong. She retained
consciousness until she died two hours
later. She had recently been visiting
her daughter. Dr. Emma J. Pronger,
who saved herself by leaping from the
fifth floor and catching a ladder a floor
below. Mm Davies leaves two sons,
Rev. F. G. Davies of the First Baptist
Church of Ottumwa, lowa, and Sam
uel T. Davies of Nebraska City, Nebr.
Her body will be shipped to the latter
place for interment.
Mrs. Smith, the tight-rope walker,
had an inside room on the fifth floor.
She was recovering from an attack of
pleurisy. Her screams were heard
but no one could save her, because of
the intense smoke.
Mrs. Co-ra Peters hailed from Wicks,
Mont., and had relatives at Marshall
Junction, this State. She was some
times known as Mrs. W. B. Gordon,
although another lady who lives a few
Mocks up the street is generally ac
credited with the name. Gordon was
not In the building when the fire
started. He rushed upstairs when the
halls were filling with smoke and tried
to get Mrs. Gordon and children out of
their fifth floor rooms. The boy is
supposed to have escaped by the back
stairs and is said to have sprained his
ankle doing so. Gordon was cut off
by smoke.
John H. Peet, from the avenue, saw
Gordon's face at the window and tried
to have ladders elevated to him, but the
ladders fouled the electric wires and
produced a short circuit. Then the peo
ple began to swarm down the ladders
from the fourth floor, jumping out to
catch them. Presently Gordon was
seen to fall back, evidently overcome by
smoke, and flames played where his
fare had been. He was a mining man,
formerly superintendent of a smelter at
Wicks, Mont., and later of the smel
ter at Pilot Bay, B. C. He was re
garded highly among mining men. The
local mining men will bury him when
the remains are recovered.
All the loss of life occurred on the
fifth floor. When the fire started in the
basement the flames ate their way
through the first floor before being dis
covered, then shot up the elevator and
air shaft to the roof, filling the upper
corridors with dense smoke. This
caused a panic among the people. Sto
ries of hearbreadth escapes on all the
floors are numerous.
On the second, third and fourth
floors there was no panic. City Con
troller George Liebes. William Gaston,
N. B. Buckler and others directed the
escapes and saved many lives by quiet
ing the women and covering delicate
women, who were making frantic
efforts to get out, clad in only night
clothes, although the temperature was
close to zero.
PEOPLE
WIN ONE
VICTORY
First Step Taken at Los
Angeles for City
Water.
Examiner Seeks to Befog the
Issue by Breaking Into the
Field in Its Usual and
Awkward Fashion.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25. â Somebody has evidently awakened the
San Francisco's yellow Journal from the trance it has been in relative
to events in Los Angeles. After The Call has won a number of de
cided victories for the people in the great war for economical munici
pal ownership of the water works in this city, the Examiner, for the
'first time seemingly, discovers that there is* an issue, or rather, a num
ber of them, between the people of Los Angeles and that aroh monop
oly, the Los Angeles City Water Company.
Just what the purpose of the Examiner is in coming into the fight
at this late day, after The Call has victoriously borne the brunt
of the battle for more than a week, is not quite clear. Judging, how
ever, from the peculiar tactics adopted by its local correspondent, who
is employed on one of the syndicated papers, the faking journal's pur
pose is either to delude its readers by another one of its infamous
strokes of fake enterprise, or it is seeking a pretext to get behind the
Los Angeles City Water Company in the contest that is now on with
full vigor.
Through its agents, the Examiner caused to be distributed in this
city to-day a circular in which the following three questions were pro
pounded:
"Are you in favor of municipal ownership of the City Water Com
pany's plant?"
"Are you in favor of the position taken by the majority of the City
Council on the water question?"
"Do you favor the position taken by Mayor Snyder on the water
question?"
To these questions, citizens were asked to answer in the affirmative
or in the negative and to subscribe their names and addresses.
If the Examiner were really alive to the situation and sincere and
honest in the handling of this great water question, it would not
have undertaken to reanimate a corpse. The issues it attempts to
raise are dead. The three questions in which it appears to be deeply
interested all of a sudden, have been fully and emphatically an
swered by the people of this city in the platforms adopted by the Re
publican, the Democratic and the Populist city conventions before the
last municipal election, more than a year ago. The water plank in
<?ach of the platforms adopted by the different policical parties has
been lived up to by Mayor Snyder and a minority of the City Coun
cil, comprising Councilmen Grider and Hutchison.
From this statement of facts it is not difficult to form a conclu
sion as to how a large majority of the people of Los Angeles feel in
this matter. They have already answered the first and third ques
tions, now ridiculously propounded by the Examiner, in the affirmative,
and the second question in the negative. The course entered upon to
day by the Examiner will only tend to befog the situation. Its ques
tions do not formulate any of the live issues of the great water prob
lem of Los Angeles.
The situation may be briefly stated as follows: There is a contract
or lease between the city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles City
Water Company. This lease expires in July of this year. Under its
terms the water plant and all that appertains thereto reverts to the
city on the payment by the latter for the improvements made by the
water company during the period of the lease. The only disagree
ment between the city and the water compr.ny is over the value >f these
Improvements. The expert civil on^ineer arpointed by the ci*y to
make an inventory and place a valuation upon the improvements es
t'mr.tec' them to be worth, at a liberal valuation, a little less than one
million two hundred thousand dollars. The water company claims
that they should be reimbursed in the sum of three million dollars.
Thus the matter now stands. What the people desire is an early set
tlement of this question of price.
By the most progressive people and those most conversant with the
situation it is held that whatever is paid for this worn-out and obso
lete plant of â¦he Los Angeles City Water Company will be an abso
lute loss to the city. This claim is based on the fact that neither the
water sources nor the plant are adequate to the needs of Los Angeles
and are daily becoming less adequate. It is becoming more and more the
opinion of the best class of taxpayers that an entirely new water system
should be designed and operatedâ one that will be sufficient to supply
a city of 350,000 inhabitants, and Mayor Snyder and Councilmen Grj^r
der and Hutchison are the two representatives of this class of people.
In the remarkable change of attitude assumed by the City Coun
cil to-day, brought about through the efforts of The Call, may be seen
the first step toward the accomplishment of the wishes of the peo
ple. If this is followed by other measures equally public spirited, ju
dicious and well directed the chances of the water company to mulct
the people will certainly be diminished.
With the city engaged in the enterprise of constructing its own
water works. It will be a much simpler matter to arrive at a fair and
equitable valuation of the so-called improvements which the Los An
geles City Water Company is to Sfrll to the city.
Meanwhile Mayor Snyder's position, which is held to be proper by
some of the best legal authorities in this city, if sustained by the
Council would give the city the key to the situation. At the expira
tion of the lease he proposes to have the city take possession of the
water works which the Los Angeles City Water Company holds un
der a lease from the city, and to operate them under municipal con
trol. This would make it devolve upon the water company to institute
any litigation that might be found necessary to determine the value of
the improvements.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25.â The people '
of Los Angeles have won their first
victory in the City Council in their ;
great battle with the water company.
This victory was only made possible by
the exposures which have been made
by The Call as to the actual condition
In which the fight was. The people had
been basely deceived and betrayed by ;
the syndicated press, and had only beÂ°n
given such information as the corpo- ;
ration desired they should have.
The result was the rights of the peo
ple were being trifled with. Matters
were progressing just as the watr;r
company desired them to. and the deal
whereby the people of this city will be
mulcted in the sum of $2,000,000 or
bound hand and foot to the monopoly
for another period of fifty years w.is
being rapidly carried to a successful
consummation.
But things have changed. The C.';ll
has aroused the people to the danger
which confronts them. The water
logged syndicated local press is dis
mayed, and the water stock holders
realize that their job to hold up the
water rate payers of this city after
their lease of the city's plant expires
is doomed to certain defeat.
This is the work The Call has thus
far accomplished, and its labors in this
connection are by no means at an end.
No citizen of Los Angeles who is at all
posted on the water fight will contend
for a moment that the action the City
Council took to-day in passing a reso
PRICE FIVE CEXTS.
lutlon appointing a special committee
to investigate sources of mountain wa
ter supply for this city and report back
within three weeks would have been
taken by the Aldermanic body if The
Call had not laid bare the water com
pany's plot. To-day such action was
taken by a unanimous vote.
When the Council met this morning
Councilman L. M. Grider offered the
resolution covering the matter, and
which was given in full in The Call of
yesterday. Councilman Ashman, .who
was the first to desert the water com
pany phalanx, seconded the resolution.
This threw the water company
forces into confusion. They knew not
what to do. Up jumped Councilman
Toll with an amendment to the resolu
tion which provided that the investi
gation as to sources of mountain sup
ply should be made by a special com
mittee instead of by the Water Supply
and Fire and Water Committees. Upon
this amendment the vote was six to
threeâ Nickoll, Baker, Matthus, Silver,
Toll and Blanehard; against, Grider,
Ashman and Hutchison. The resolu
tion as amended was then carried by
a unanimous vote.
The appointment of the committee
was of course left to President Silver,
and here came a surprise. Mr. Silver
at once named as the committee:
Messrs. Grider, -Hutchison and Mat
thus. The personnel of the committee
could not be improved on. Messrs.
Grider and Hutchison are the firm and2
unyielding friends of the people in the
water struggle and they can be relied
upon to make a report which will be a
truthful presentation of facts in the
people's interests.
The action which the Council took
to-day could just as well have been
taken a year ago. It is simply in di
rect line with the pledges all political
parties made to the people prior to
the last municipal election. The re
port which this committee will make
will disclose to the people of this city
the fact that no matter what the out
come of the pending litigation Is as to
the head works site or as to the Crys
tal Springs water rights the munici
pality is in a position of independence
as far as the present water monopoly
Is concerned in the matter of the con
struction of a new and independent
plant.
Be it said to the credit of the presi
dent of the Council, Herman Silver,
that he has appointed a committee to
investigate the matter in which the
people have faith, and there is a gen
eral feeling of confidence that they will
make a report, after full investigation,
which will in.no way be dictated by
the water company.
Councilman F. M. Xickell. chairman
of the Water Supply Committee, says
the water company has not indicated
to the committee one single solitary
step that it has in contemplation now
or in the future, let alone closing up
negotiations for the city to take pos
session of its plant at the expiration
of the lease, and he states that beyond
the offer made a year ago to sell the
plant for three million dollars, two
million more than it is worth, the com
pany has never placed since then any
price upon its' plant. The company;
Nlcki II says, has never in any way in
dicated what it would do as to arbi
tration.
This is from the chairman of the
Water Supply Committee and shows
Just exactly the Rtatus of the case.
The water company is doing: absolute
ly nothing on its paii as Car as pre
paring <>r paving the way for the city
rry out us contract is concerned.
Nickell himself tella the story of the
plans of the corporation to defeat the
will of the people by a policy of delay.
and he as a member of the Council and
the Water Supply Com
mitte i> assisting to carry out that
programn r bo doing he re
ceives the approval of the syndicated
. tress.
But by others Mr. Nickell is being
called to account. A communication
has been addressed to him which is
both sharp and pointed and which
will force him to take a position either
in th~ open for the people or on the
water company's side. This communi
cation is signed by Telfair Creighton,
chairman of the Democratic City Cen
tral Committee; Milton Carlson, chair
man of the People's party City Cen
tral Committee, and by W. M. John
ston and W. C Petchner of the Silver
Republican executive committee. By
this combination of political parties
Mr. Nick< 11 v. as elected.
The communication recites the plat
form upon which he was elected and
asks him if he is going to stand by
the pledges he made or repudiate
them. Nickell was shown a copy of
the letter, but declined to be inter
viewed upon it until he had had time
to read and digest it. It calls him to
time in very sharp words and it will
probably be some time before he di
gests it.
The Jeffersonian Society met to
night and a motion to indorse the ac
tion of the Democratic City Central
Committee on the water question
taken Saturday evening was laid on
the table by a vote of 10 to 9. This
action was the result of urgent work
to save the traitorous Herald from the
condemnation it so well merits for be
traying the people's interests in the
great water fight. it was not unex
pected. The resolution .was put in
merely to get a test vote so that there
could be an alignment of forces. It
was deemed best to asecrtain as soon
ns possible the men who could be de
pended on to stand unalterably with
the people in the water struggle. The
desired information was obtained and
a change of one vote would have re
sulted in the adoption of the resolu
tion.

might be at the command of this city
for use as a domestic water supply, and
as far aa possible determined the prac
ticability, feasibility and cost of each.
The report says:
It should have been the duty of the
City Council to perform those labors, but
Bint c that body has nut seen lit up to the
present time to do bo, we have attempted
to do the best we could. Being without
tn< - â  of an engineer, and with
out the means at our hand to secure re
porta from scientific sources, we have
been compelled to resort to such pub-
Ilshed literature as we could find, to the
maps of Loa Angeles and adjoining coun
ties, t<> our personal knowledge of the
country and to such information as we
could collect from informal talks with
engineers, water company owners and
persons familiar with the mountains and
streams.
The data which we furnish Jn this re
port concerning other cities are taken
principally from the Manual of American
Water Works for ISM. This work is oub-
Ushed by the Engineering News, and Is
Btrtctly scientific and reliable. It is not
the province of this committee to discuss
the general matt r of municipal owner
ship of water works; but we trust it' will
be a matter of interest to submit a few
ligures and remarks at the outset
The People's party is ordinarily accused
of advocating theories and experiments,
tvr-n if this accusation Is correct In some
â  ts, it is entirely wrong so far as the
municipal ownership of water works Is
concerned.
In England, as well as Continental
Europe, all the titles and towns are sup
plied by municipal works, while In Can
ada, out of a total of 146 cities and towns
now possessing complete water works iO9
are owned by the municipalities while
only 36 are controlled by private corpora
tions. And even in the United States It
self, Where <->>rporations and trusts are
securely enthroned, out of 3196 cities and
towns that have a full Kupply of water
1690 an- supplied by the municipalities'
while only ]45>i> are controlled by private
corporations.
It is also interesting to note that since
the birth of the People's party the muni
cipal ownership idea has made wonderful
progress.
When the pioneers of this party met fci
convention in Omaha in ls:Â»0 and adopted
the first national platform and gave birth
to this party, the municipalities of this
country owned only 43 per cent of their
water works, while at present the mun*
cipalities of this country control 54 per
cent. We believe that this rapid growth
is largely due to our advocacy of these
principles. The good that a party does
U not always gauged by the number of
voteÃ it casts. A party may wield a \^o
mendous influence in molding public Ma
' tlment and yet be a minorical organiza
tion. If the present rate of construction
Rnd purchase of private plants by muni
cipalities goes on, it will not be long be
fore private monopolies will cease ho far
as water systems are concerned.
It is also interesting to note the
progress made in the large cities. To-day
of all the cities in the 1 nited States hav
ing a population of over JOO.OOO. uiily six
â  have water- works in the control of pri
vate corporations, and two of the six are
in California. Let us hope that very soon
these remaining six will be along the line
followed by the others. So the history of
the present shows us that we are not
experimenting or theorizing in our ad
i vocaey of a municipal water plant
It is the duty of this committee tn In
: vestigate. as far as il may tie able to do
j so, any sources of mountain water that it
i may be practical to use for this purpose
in the city of Los Angeles. There are
numerous streams which rise in the ad
jacent mountains which find then way
either Into the ocean beyond or sink in
the sands of the valleys. In order to de
termine what would be practical the chief
and foremost question is, "How far from
th,e city of Los Angeles will it be prae-
I tlcal to go to find a water supply?" Tho
| distance is only a matter of oost if the
, altitude and other circumstances are fa
1 vorable. Consequently It becomes a ques
j tion of important interest at the outset
i to determine how much money the city
I of Los Angeles e,an afford to invest In a
[ water system.
In this connection it would be inter
1 esting and perhaps very useful to see
what other large cities have invested in
I such plants. We have compiled a table
! concerniiiK all those cities of the I'nited
States having a population of over 100.000,
: giving the cost <>f the water plant, the
j cost per. capita, the gross income f<>r I V S,
the cost <>f expense and maintenance for
said year, the net profit to Che City (<x
cluding any interest on bonded debt, the
rate of interest which the plant is pay
ing on the investment less the interest on
bonds, the present bonded debt of the
: city for water purposes, the rate of inter
est which the last bond issue bears, and
also the family rate as near as may be
there prevailing for a seven-room house,
with kftchen faucet only. This table is
annexed t" this report as appendix A,
and is submitted for your Information.
The tables of population are based on the
census of l v< .Â«>. except the population of
Los Angeles, which is based <>n the must
recent census. This calculation may not
be fair in all cases, but it is the host that
we could arrive at, and when we take
Into consideration that the country has
not grown largely sln< c 1896, and that the
data concerning the water systems are
not altogether of the most recent date, it
may be a more fair statement than would
appear at first glance. At any rate, how
ever, It Is all that we could do and we
submit it accordingly.
By this table it will be seen that the
average per capita cost of all the water
systems of the United States in cities of
over 100,000 population where the plants
are owned by the municipalities is $H3.
When we add to our calculation tin
of the plants as given in the citi< B of
Omaha, Denver, Indianapolis and New
Orleans, which are operated by private
companies, and again calculate the jrrand
total of per capita cost of water works in
the I'nited States In cities of over :
population, we have a per capita cost of
$35 56. There is a very great diversity in
the per capita cost of the various sys
tems. The lowest cost of any system" in
the I'nited States belonging to a munici
pality is that of the city of Pittsburg,
where the per capita cost Is only Jl4 &{.
while in Boston we find the highest at
$67 77. It may be contended, and perhaps
correctly, that the larger the city the less
the per capita cost should be, and if the
city of Los Angeles should build works
to accommodate a city of the future size
the proportionate cost would be lea*.
This may be true, and would certainly
seem reasonable, but the experience of
all the cities in the United States which
we have considered does not prove the
truth of this assertion. The city of Alle
gheny, which is the smallest in popula
tion of any of the municipal ownership
cities In our list, has expended per capita
in the construction of its water system
$21 84, while the city of New York has ex
pended $.'>" per capita. N<Â«r is this a soli
tary instance, but a careful study of the
table we submit to you has failed to show
us in any manner that the size of tb<
has any effect in actual BXperiem a upon
the per capita cost of the water works.
The cost seems to depend more upon cir
cumstances and construction than other
wise.
The city of Xew York has constructed j
an immense and adequate water supply. !
It is taken from gravity sources and Ls
probably the grandest municipal water
system in the world. The cost is $.",n per
capita and tho city of Chicago, ranking
second in population, quite on the con
trary pumps Its water from Lake Michi
gan and has constructed a cheap system,
the cost being only $21 Rl per capita
MVhlle the city of Chicago in the con
structlon of its system has encountered i
B debt that the city of New York, :
nevertheless the magnificent system of
the city of New York is not without its
advantages. The cost of operation of the
New York plant is only 42 cents per cap
ita per annum, while that Oif Chicago i.s
isl 30 per capita per annum. Thus, while
: the city of New York nas expended â 
j much larger sum In the construction of i
Its plant, its citizens not only enjoy a su
perior system, but the annual tax for op
, eration, which goes on forever, is thus â¢
in favor of the city that has based its
system upon the sure foundation, al
though the cost w;us large at the outset.
If the city, of Los Angeles desires to
construct a system for a city of 103 0tÂ»0
people. Its present population, upon the
i basis of the average per capita cost of all
: the municipal systems of the L'nlted
j States that are located in largo cities, the
: city will expend the sum of $3.399 ,wO. If
it desires to expend an amount equal to
the average per capita of all the cities
of the United Stat.-a given in the accom
panying tables and based on the present
population, it will expend $3,662,000. If It
expends the per capita cost of New York
It will expend $5,150,000, or if it equals that
of the city of Boston the amount will be
$5,950,000.
j All these calculations are based upon
; the present population of the city of Los
Angeles. If. however, we are to build a
system for the future and are to con
struct such a system aÂ« is recommended
by Mr. Dockweiler in his report of last
March, based upon a city of 247,000 people
, and the per capita average of all the
cities having municipal plants, the cx
i penditure would amount to $8,160,000:
! while if the system to be constructed
i was upon the basis of 247,000 people and
the expenditures per capita were to be
equal to those of New York or Boston,
the sums would be so largo that we fear
the people of Los Angeles would be
frightened.
The present net income of the Ix>s An
geles City Water Company pays 4 per i
cent interest, according to thoir state- I
ments, on the sum of $7,825,000. The build-
Ing of a water system is no small task,
and we earnestly urge you to consider
well the cost of the water plants as com
piled and furnished in the tables we pre
sent, for by the careful consideration of
the table you will be able to understand ,
the largo amounts thai have been ex- I
pended by other cities in the construction
of water works and will be prepared for
tho expenditure on your own part of an
adequate sum. Tho city of Los Angeles
has a credit at the present time of about
$7,5U0,000. However, if the school bonds
and fire department bonds are voted, this
credit would be extinguished to perhaps
a trifle less than $7,000,000. (N. B.â These
bonds did not carry.)
It Is not to be said that we shall ex
pend as much as other cities or as much
as the average, or in any manner that
our expenditure is to be gauged by that
of other cities. Our expenditures should
be gauged according to the circumstances
and according to the cost of what an ade
quate* system would be, but we believe
j that the publication of the tables of the
costs of the various systems will encour
age our people to believe that an ede
quate system can be constructed for the
| city of Los Angeles on a more reasonable
j basis than they have been formerly led
I tO believe
However, let us revert to the main sub-
Jcet of our Inquiry, that is, mountain
water sources.
The city of San Diego, with a popula
tion one-nixth that of the city of Los
Angeles, brings its water ior a distance
of fifty-seven miles. This is by conduit
line, the air lino being much less. How
ever, for purposes of considering the
feasible sources of mountain supply with
reference to distance, we have concluded
to mention all those streams of any im
portance flowing from mountain sources
that come within a radius from the city |
I of Los Angeles equal in distance from the |
center of the city of San Diego to its
Cuyamaca reservoir.
These streams are eleven in number
the Piru, Elizabeth Lake, Soledad. Little
Tujunga, Hlg Tujunga, Arroyo Seco. San
Gabriel, San Dlmas, San Antonio, Dry
Creek and Lytle Creek. We have ob
tained whatever information we could
concerning them all, though in many
cases our Information simply consists of
the county map and talks with persons
who have been over them.
Piru Creek has its origin in Ventura
< ounty, flows thence into Los Angele*
County, easterly of Antelope Valley,
thence again re-enters into Ventura
County and empties its water:; Into the
Santa Clara River. It is said that the
water could be diverted and brought t â Â»
the city of Los Angeles. Above lti<s point
of diversion where it would be necessary
to maintain a sufficient altitude to reach
the city of Los Angeles we would have- in
the neighborhood of 300 square milt-3 of
drainage area. This is by all mean.? li.o
largest stream within the radius of our
city which we have assumed. It is said
that there are reservoir sites alons the
stream, though we do not find any rec
ord of any private ownership. The ciis

tance from the city, of Los Angeles will
be perhaps almost sixty miles. Thin :.
the great barrier, but it Is only, as we
said before, a question of cost. The con
duit line for the distance would probably,
if properly constructed, cost somewhere
in the neighborhood of $1.00u,0U0 We
would recommend that th's source of
supply be Investigated.
The second source of supply is that of
Elizabeth Lake. This lake lies to the
east of Antelope Valley and at an alti
tude of 1200 feet above sea level. It has
a drainage area of about fifty square
miles and presents one of the most mas;
nificent reservoir sites in the country,
having a drainage which would be suffi
cient for the city of Los Angeles for all
time. This system would lie about al
most equal distance from the city of Los
Angeles.
Our next source of supply would be
that from the Soledad. These are the
headwaters of the Santa Clara River,
and while the drainage area is quite
large, the mountains are not high, the
stream is not large and the distance,
While less than the former systems men
tioned, is quite great. It is said that
there are no good storage sites upon the
stream, and from the best that wo can
learn it would not be a feasible s-ource
of supply.
Next we would mention the Little Tu
junga. The drainage area la about
twenty-five square miles. This stream
has been developed to a certain extent
and now supplies the town of Fernando
and the surrounding country. The drain
age are. i. as you will see, Is compara
tively small, and the fact that it is. al
ready partly consumed would render it
Inefficient for the city supply.
Next we would mention the Big Tv-
Junga. Here we find a drainage area of
134 square miles, which la amply suffi
cient lor all necessities. it is said that
a pipe line leads from this stream, ; ".p
plying Monte Vista with a small quantity
of water, bul that the sum th'Â«i utilized
would cut- no material figure with a
larger use. Otherwise this stream is not
utilized. Its outlet is located only .-.bout
fifteen miles by air line from the city of
Los Angelas, ;:nd > we are told al'Cit
twenty-two miles by surveyed line It is
said that this stream flows a very la:ge
quantity of water In the winter time, and
that there are some good storage rites
along it. We find from the records that
the Hamilton Irrigation Company seems
to be the owner of nine valleys along the
stream, which were acquired from the
Government as stated for reservoir pur
poses, together with a right of way
down the entire canyon for such use. We
understand that some work has been
done in the development of this system,
but not a great deal. By all means this
system should be investigated. Its large
drainage area, its nearness to the city,
present features which are not found in
any other propositions we have consid
ered.
Next we find the Arroyo Seco, with a
drainage of twenty-seven square miles,
which, however, is thoroughly consumed
and is used to supply the city of Pasa
dena.
Following our course to the east on the
Sierra Mad re range we next come to the
San Gagriel. which, with its !!â¢>â ) square
miles of drainage area, is the largest
stream of the range. However, we find
here the waters are utilized for irrigation
purposes by more than one hundred own
ers and the cost to acquire the water
would simply mean the purchase of the
ranches and orchards of the San Gabriel
Valley, which would be impossible. We
also find from the records that three pri
vate power companies have attempted to
secure themselves along this stream and
we presume that they have succeeded in
establishing proper claims to the water
for power purposes. The water being
both used for irrigation and owned for
power purposes, we do not see how the
city of Los Angeles could avail itself.
There seemed to be no claims for reser
voir Bites along the stream and it is said
that none of consequence exist.
Next east we find San Antonio Creek,
the waters of which, however, are used
for irrigation at Ontario and the power
of which Is developed and used for elec
tric lighting and other purposes in On
tario and as far east as San Bernardino
Beyond this we lind Dry Creek with a
comparatively small drainage area, but
which supplies a good stream of water
the entire year. This water, however is
entirely consumed for irrigation at Roch
ester and Etiwanda and the land along
the stream is said to be entirely private
property. v
Next east, and the last stream which
we shall mention, is that of Lytle Creek
Lytle Creek has a large drainage area
and reaches to high altitudes. Its per
ennial flow is good, but is all utilized and
owned. It supplies the City of San Ber
nardino, the settlement of Rialto and
other sections with water for domestic
and irrigation purposes. The Lytle Creek
Reservoir and Power Company claim to
be the owners of two reservoirs along
this stream that will impound in the
neighborhood of 4000 inches of water
which would be sufficient for a my of
half a million people. If the city should
construct a system on Lytle Creek it
would necessarily be an exclusively stor
age system, and. the distance is about
sixty miles. The cost would be very
treat, but it is Possible and the supply
would be ample. v y
Thus we have reviewed all the moun
tain streams which come within a radius
of ,? lxt Â£.. 1 2 lleH ot the <itv " { ''" Angeles
and which are of sufficient consequence
to be mentioned In connection with the
city supply.
It is not our purpose to recommend any
particular supply but only to have ex
amined in this casual way and to deter
mine which streams were of sufficient
importance to receive a proper investiga
tion and after looking over the ground
as carefully as we have been able we
submit this report and make the recom
mendation that the source of supply from
Piru creek. Elizabeth Lake. PWg Tv
Junga and Lytle Creek receive an in
vest gation at the hands of our city of
ficials. Our City Engineer could de
termine , with very little .Investigation
which of these systems were feasible and
which were not, and for the city of Los
Â£?Â«Â«??â¦ i nd or - th ? se P art Â»es which have
committed themselves to a mountain
source of supply, to lie dormant and make
no Investigation and no determination as
to which are feasible and which are not
Is in violation of our trust and should
not be permitted. lv
There is one other matter which we
would like to submit In connection with
this report, and that is in regard to the
protection afforded against lire- by a sys
tem of ample pressure.
There are many cities in the United
States which maintain no steam fire en
gines at all and depend absolutely upon
the pressure maintained by the water
system. The fire department of the city
of Los Angeles costs us $81,000 per an
num. It is v confidently predicted that
more than half of this sum could be
saved If a proper water system with a
Â£ roper pressure was constructed. The
,os Angeles River is too. low for fire
pressure even at Its very source. We
must have a mountain supply in order to
provide a Hre pressure.
Of the three political parties which
nominated candidates In the last muni
ripal Â« lection all platforms agreed that
we must have a system of sufficient pres-
TY n ' \'? tire Purposes. This is impossi
ble with the Los Angeles River. Conse
quently there should be perfect unanim
ity anionn ;.il parties in this mattir. No
city official can refuse to support a
mountain water proposition and go be
fore his constituency and tell them he
has not been false to the provisions of
his platform.
We append to this report a list of cities
of the United States of over 10.000 popu
lation that use their system for fire pur
poses without the agency of steam fire
engines. Some of these cities use fire
engines In portions of the city, some at
large fires and otherwise, but this com
prises a list of cities which in some man
ner have done away with steam fire en
ginesâby the construction of water sys
tems of sufficient pressure to enable them
to be utilized for that purpose.
We mark this appendix "H." Respect
fully submitted.

MRS. CLARK
VISITS THE
MURDERER
Continued from First Page.
"I won't say anything my attorney
tells me not to."
Mrs. Clark continued to plead with
him until her daughter said:
"Never mind, ma; don't ask him any
more."
Clark shook hands with his sister-in
law and with the child, saying:
"Good-by, Bertha; be a good girl."
Which is good advice, even tho-ugh it
came from a murderer.
Mrs. Clark and her daughter went
back to St. Helena, Clark back to his
cell.
"I told her," he said later, when
speaking: of the interview, "that we
might meet again, something might
happen. Life is so uncertain. You can
never tell from one day to another.
That's what I have always said."
Sheriff McKenzle fears that the pris
oner may resort to suicide, and it
wouldn't be hard to imagine this mel
ancholy, miserable man driven to des
peration.
"I never thought of suicide," he said,
when the Sheriff's precautions were
mentioned. "Why, I ain't even thought
of it. I ain't afraid to go up to St.
Helena. I ain't afraid of there being
a mob."
But Sheriff McKenzle is. He re
members a preliminary examination in
St. Helena some years ago that was
never concluded. There were so many
witnesses to be examined that court
adjourned over night and a St. Helena
mob took the prisoner from the law's
custody and hanged him. Sheriff Mc-
Kenzle doesn't propose that his prede
cessor's experience shall be repeated
during his term.
Clark will be taken to the little town
where the crime was committed in a
wagon if the weather is fine, with an
extra deputy to guard him. Should the
examination be pro-longed beyond train
time (there is but one train from St.
Helena in the afternoon) Clark will not
be trusted for a single night to the
doubtful security of a St. Helena jail.
The Sheriff will drive back again to
Napa at whatever time the examina
tion may conclude.
The murderer is worried about the
financial affairs of the Clark family.
"People up there," he said, complain-
lngly, "appear to be kind of down on
her. She says she will do anything to
support the children. She wants to take
in washing, but I don"t know whether
she'll git it. I told her to be patient,
and I guess she'll live It down. She
told me all about the moving and
that. 11
"Shall you see Mrs. Clark If she
comes again?"
"O yes; I'll always be glad to see her
and the children," he answered, with
that half-grotesque, half-pathetic, but
wholly Bincere regard for the younger
Clarks. "But I won't talk to her or
to any one else about my case. I've
talked too much a-lready, and I won't
see anybody to talk to without my at
torney's there. When I go on the stand
I'll tell all the truth."
It is quite probable, too, that he will.
George Clark is too weak, too dull even
to lie well.
The Sheriff has in his custody a let
ter written by Oark to the husband of
Mrs. Clark's eldest daughter, G. W.
Dax, whose name is signed to the war
rant issued for Clark's arrest. It is
a pitiably ignorant letter that would
disgrace a boy of 10. It is kept that
the handwriting acknowledged by
Clark may be compared with that of
the notes which in his confession he
says he wrote, signing his brother's
name. These notes are nearly illegible
now, so they have been photographed.
They are written on dirty scraps of pa
per with a lead pencil. The following
letter, written the same day Clark con
fessed his crime, shows the intellectual
caliber of the man:
The prison Walks are dark and dreary
but the lite comes through the little win
dow so bright and cheering. The Lord
is with me In this cell and to him I
chant. George, I am not guilty, and God
knows it If you will come down I would
like to talk to you. I am well I do be
lieve I will come out all write are you all
well. From G. W. Clark to G. W. Dax.
Old residents of Pope Valley remem
ber the burning of the house in which
the Clark family lived, and recall their
suspicions at the time. The whole fam
ily, with the exception of William
Clark, who was hard at work up at
the Aetna mines, lived in a three
roomed structure on a ranch for
which they never succeeded in paying.
William Clark toiied to keep that great
family of his, and paid part of the

Dyspepsia Cured
First Bottle of Hood's Sarsaparilla
Gave Relief.
"My mother was troubled very much
with dyspepsia and began taking
Hood's Sarsaparilla. The first bottle
gave her relief, and Bince taking three
bottles she has net been troubled with
dyspepsia at all." EARL AKERS,

debt. When the man to whom the
money was owing suggested to George
Clark that he work in exchange for
part of the sum owed, George declined,
saying that he could not leave his sis
ter-in-law alone on the place. The
scandal of the relations existing be
tween George Clark and his brother's
wife was public property in Pope Val
ley years ago.
This afternoon Henry Hogan, who
with Attorney Beerstecher will take
charge of Clark's case, was closeted
with the prisoner. Mr. Hogan refuses
to say what the defense will be.
"But we've got a vase," he said,
stoutly.
"And you've actually hope?"
"Yes, sir," he answered. "For one
thing, that confession will never be
admitted as evidence. I'll fight that.
I'll show that it was extorted from this
man while he was in durance vile; that
the man who got it assured Clark, with
an arm about the poor wretch's neck,
that he would do everything for him
if he would confess, and that if he did
not he would be hanged within sixty
days. "I'll put District Attorney Bell
upon the stand and have him swear as
to whether he did or did not question
this man.
Clark did not confess without hope
of reward or fear of punishment. The
confession should not stand. The man
is half an imbecile, anyway. Any one
can make him do or say anything. He
Is like one of those masses of clay that
the man at the Orpheum molds into the
likeness of a man's face, which be
comes merely a mass of clay again."
All Clark expects of his attorney, he
Fay?, is that the latter shall "save his
neck." But the saving of that neck
becomes more and more doubtful to
I body but Clark and his attorney.
The murderer is cheerful. He re
ceived with pleasure a lot of religious
books brought from his little cabin on
Dr. Osborne's place in St. Helena, and
he developed a surprising degree of
reticence when questioned about the
hat he wore in covering the distance
between th<> old Clark house and his
own cabin the morning of the murder.
The prosecution is laboring to make
the identification of Clark as the man
seen running along Pine street posi
tive. It is said that that link in the
chain of evidence corroborating Clark's
confession is not as vet complete.
Clark aided the Sheriff when the lat
ter came ostensibly to improve the ap
pearance of his room, but really to
search the place carefully and to make
sure that there shall be no possibility
of suicide. Everything, including the
mattress, was changed and the mur
derer's clothes were searched. Then,
in the housewifely way a single man
knows who has "batched" for him
self, Clark set to work to sweep out
his cell.
Clark's father, Joseph Clark of Pin
ard, Tryame County, 111., which is just
ninety-six miles from St. Louis, has
been communicated with. The father
is as yet wholly ignorant of the terri
ble tragedy which has deprived him of
one son and made the other a mur
derer. The prisoner was loth to let
his old father know of his crime.
"It will kill him," he said.
There are rumors in Napa to-night
that the defense is planning a sur
prise. It may not improve Clark's
chances of escaping the gallows, but
there is a possibility that Mrs. Clark
may be arrested as accessory to the
murder of her husband. The course
of events at the preliminary examina
tion will probably decide the matter.

PROVIDENCE. R. 1.. Jan. 25.â The
small two-masted filibuster steamer

board of her were saved in the midst
of a terrible stnrm by the schooner

Forty tons of dynamite, three dyna

of ammunition, undoubtedly intended
for the warring Cubans, were on board
the Tillie when she sank.
The Governor Ames arrived from
Newport News at 11 o'clock to-day
She was docked at once. On board
were the nineteen rescued from the

Captain dust Waldemar of the Gov
ernor Ames says that last Sunday
afternoon about 2 o'clock, while twen
ty-elght miles south by west of Shin-
s', he si^ht'd the steamer in dis
tress. The wind was blowing forty
miles an hour and the sea was fierce.
Two boatloads of men from the found
ering steamer commenced to work
th'-ir way toward the Ames. The sea
threw them around with great
lence and they were in danger of cap
sizing or swamping. Lines were
thrown to the boats. It was impos
sible for them to come near enough
to the schooner to allow the men to
climb aboard, for the seas would have
thrown th-ir boats against the Ames'
side and a wholesale fatality would
have resulted. Bowlines were made
of small lines and thrown to the en
dangered mÂ»-n. They placed the bow
lines around themselves, jumped over
board, and in that fashion were hauled
aboard on" at a time.
Eleven m-->n finally stood safe on the
A mop' quarter deck. They said that
twleve more, including Captain Berry,
were still aboard the Tillie. Captain
Waldemar called for volunteers who
went in the Ames' largest boat to save
the r<- in Rind or of the steamer's crew.
Kight of th" men was all the boat could
carry. Four poor follows were left
aboard. By the time the other men
had boon hauled aboard the gale had
increased greatly in force. The wind
was blowing Blxty-flve miles an boar
picking up the tops of the waves bodily
and blowing the watpr in sheets along
the surface of the sea. Darkness be
gan to lower. Tt would have been use
less to have trkd to make another trip.
All hands realized that tho poor fel
lows on tho Tilll" were doomed. Re
luctantly Captain Waldemar put the
vessel on her course.
A reporter Interviewed r-aptain
George Berry, master of the Tillie. He
said that she was purchased two
months ago by McAllister Bros, of New
York, and was fitted for carrying cat
tle and freight. He took in a cargo
of 2^ tons of soft coal and a groat
quantity of cased provisions last week
in New York, and sailed on Wednes
day, bound for Tampa, Fla. lie said
that affr discharging the coal at
Tampa, ho understood that the vessel
was to enmmonco carrying cattle fmm
Tampa to Havana for the Spanish
Government. Leaving New York, he
ded to Montauk Point, whore on
Saturday fifteen Cubans joined the yes-
He took them merely ns passen
gers, the captain averred, and was go-
Ing to land ihom at Tampa. The Tillie
put to S'-.-t -it one,. She proceeded in
a southwesterly direction from Mon
tauk Point inder steam and sail at tho
rato of r"v-n knots an bour. Satur
day r,i;rrt she commenced to leak. Tier
ill was apparently tight, but
In Berry thi:;!;s that the shaft
alley must have been broken, for water
commenced to come in around tho stuf
fing bow The danger was apparent
from tho ptnrt. for it was no tiny
stream which trickled in at the foot of
the Tillle's Rternoost.
At the time the trouble began the
vessel wan fifty miles to the eastward
of Barnegat and forty-three miles from
the nearest land. The steam pump
soon became choked and the situation
quickly became desperate. An unsuc
cessful attempt had been made to stop
the leak upon its discovery, but It
seemed to become worse steadily. The
pumps became choked and the fires
were put out. For two hours steam
was kept up by using kerosene. At
last the fires were drowned out. and all
hands pave up the last hope of reach
in* shore.

CARSON. Jan. 25.â The Douglas
Grand Jury met at 10:30 o'clock this
morning and worked on the Ãber
lynching case until noon. After lunch
eon it met at 1 o'clock, and, going to
the juryroom, had an informal talk for
about fifteen minutes, and then began
the preliminary discussion before bal
loting on the case. The jury took seven
ballots, and the result each time was
the same â nine to eight in favor of in
dicting the seven men who were the
ringleaders in the lynching of Ãber.
The State lacked three votes of
enough to make the indictment stick,
and it was plain that the successive
balloting would not make the slightest
difference. This balloting and discus
sion was kept up until nearly 3 o'clock,
when Judge Mack was sent for, and
the jury came into court. There was a
large crowd of people anxious to hear
the result. Richard Cook, the foreman
of the jury, arose and said:
"I don't think there is the slightest
| use of this jury doing anything more
in the Ãber case. It is impossible to
secure an indictment."
Tne news spread rapidly over town,
f, mi , a telephone message was sent to
â  Gardnerville, where there was great
satisfaction.
i n Genoa" It was. different, and the
majority of people expressed intense
disgust that the jury lacked the back
j bone to do its duty.
Foreman Cook, who all along grap
' Ple? wlth the case honestly and with a
*Â£Â£%&
, .-The Jury go t all the evidence avail
able, and in all there were sixty-five
witnesses who testified against the
lynchers. Nine of us considered that
District Attorney Virgin made out a
complete case but there were eight
m en who apparently did not think so.
They seemed weak-kneed, hut I can
| not lit.li(. the stories tnnt any of them
UU Vere corruptly influenced. They seemed
| honestly to think that there was no
I evidence. I will say that there was no
attempt to smother evidence."
District Attorney Virgin said: "There
was sufficient evidence to convict sev
eral men. It was plain, direct evi
dence. I cannot say now that I will
ask foT another Grand Jury, but if I get
some additional evidence which I ex
pect I shall certainly call for it. I think
i the court will give me another Grand
; Jury if I ask for it."
The Judge said, when questioned: "I
i have nothing to say. It is not my place
j to say anything except that District
i Attorney Virgin and Mr. Cook, fore
man of the Grand Jury, did their whole
duty honestly and fearlessly. They did
vio-
splendid work in the cause of justice
and law."
In the town of Genoa the talk was
very free after the result was known.
"It took lots of this to save these
scoundrels." said one- man, rubbing his
thumb and finger together suggestively.
"They had their paid workers here all
the while."
Another said: "I saw a little valise
come over from Gardnerville last week,
and it was very heavy when it came,
and empty when it went bark. Some
people, who were red hot against the
lynchers when it happened, changed
their tune after the stuff came over
here."
This was a fair sample of the talk
on the streets of Genoa and about the
saloons. It is not charged, however,
that the eight grand jurors were
bought to ignore tht j bill, but that men
were paid to influence them by making
them think that the majority of the
people wanted the county saved th*
expense. This was the main lever mcd
to influence them. Some, it is said, had
openly expressed themselves in favor
of the lynchers before the Garnd Jury
was called, and It is also charged in
Genoa that the Grand Jury was ille
gally drawn by the clerk, who in
drawing the names out of the box laid
some aside on the table that really be
longed to the panel. Had the indict
ment been found thp accused would
have set this up as a defense. Some My
that this was an accident, and some
hint that it was design.
GREEKS ARE PLANNING TO
OVERTHROW KING GEORGE.
NEW YORK, Jan. 25.â A morning pa
per says: Four hundred thousand Greeks,
disgusted with the treachery, cowardice
and bad faith of the Danish dynasty,
which; by the grace of the concert of the
powers rules, are organizing to depose
King George and establish a Hellenic re
public.
"This movement comprehends nothing
else, than the establishment of a pan-
Hellenic republic." said one of the prin
cipal Greek merchants of New York last
night. Preparations are already on foot
for a revolution. There are .TOOO Greeks
In New York, many of whom returned
home to participate in the late war. All
will be with us when the signal comes
for a stroke of freedom. We, who are
here and In other foreign countries, will
furnish money and munitions. We will
also seek the moral support of the gov

SPARK FROM HER
PIPE CAUSES AN
OLD LADY'S DEATH
Mrs. Richardson, a Colton Octo
genarian, Incinerated
in View of Her
Daughter.
TACOMA. Jnn. B.â Mrs. Rirhar.ipf.n. an ae^d woman. replii
inp at Colton, met death yesterday afternoon in a horrible man
mr. She sat >>y the kitchen stove, smoking her corncob pipe,
whil^ Mrs. Anselin, her daughur, with whom she lived, was
washing at a neighbor's, going home every little while to see if
her mother was all right.
While hanging out her clothes, Mrs. Anpelin noticed smoke
nt her own home, and running thither found her mother writh
ing in pain on th^ kitchen floor and unable to sp"eak. Her clothes
were blazing and she was in terrible agony. Recognizing her
daughter, she signified that it was too late for help. Mrs. Ange
lin screamed for assistance, but her mother died before It ar
rived.
Mrs. Angelin fainted when she realized what had happened,
falling at her mother's feet. The villagers rushed in in re
sponse to her calls and revived her as si dily as possible, first
putting out the fire which lingered in the remnants of Mrs.
Richarilsim's clothing. The old lady's face, head and body were
charred beyond recognition. The pitiful sight overcame strong
men, who wept as they tenderly pk-ked up the fragile body and
carried it to the old lady's bedroom.
No inquest was h.ld. but the Colton Justice of the Peace made
an investigation which develoned that Mrs. Richardson's clothing
must have caught fire from her pipe. She ran to the kitchen ta
ble and endeavored to extinguish the flames, as was shown by
the fact that water was spilled over the table, on which was also
a hunch of burnt matches. An oil cloth on the table was burned
on its edges. She was too feeble to put out the fire and fell to the
floor.
The sad tragedy has filled Colton with grief and the whole
neighborhood will turn out at the funeral to be held to-morrow.
Mrs. Angelta is nearly crazed by the horrible event. Mrs. Rich
ardson was over 80 years old. She was an estimable woman and
leaves a number of children at Pullman, Colfax and Walla
Walla, whom she was in the habit of visiting each summer at
their homes. During cold weather she resided with her favorite
daughter, Mrs. Angelin.

BY A CHILD
Fresno Business Men De

Small Sums.
Clever Scheme of a Little
Girl to Obtain Pin
Money.
Loans or Food Supplies Solicited on
Behalf of Alleged Sick
Women.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Jan. 25.â The new woman
has been discounted In Fresno by the
new girl. The latter Is an innocent
looking child, rather stout, and has the
appearance of being a little miss from
school. Her age is placed at about 14
years by those who have seen her.
This little miss has been working a
very clever bunko game on a number of
business men of this city, and no doubt
is "having a high old time" with her
easily earned pin money.
Last Monday afternoon the girl in
short dresses who has taken to living
by her wits entered the insurance of
fice of W. T. Mattingly. on I street,
near Tulare, and said breathlessly:
â¢Mamma wants four bits, right
away."
Now it happened that the new girl
addressed H. B. Choice, Instead of Mr.
Mattingly.
"Who is your mamma?" queried that
gentleman.
The bunko girl mentioned theranie of
a widow of this city, whose business
Mr. Mattingly has been attending to.
"But please hurry up, sir." she plead
ed, "because the baby swallowed poi
son. He was playing on the floor,
sir "
"Well," said Mr. Choice, unsympa
thetically, "Mr. Mattingly >.v ill be back
in half an hour."
The girl feigned to be worried about
the baby that ate poison, but she did
not wait for the return of Mr. Mat
tingly.
When the insurance man returned
and investigated the matter he found
that the girl's story was a pure fabri
cation, and concluded that her game
was simply to get spending money.
Festerday Manager Coats of the
Sperry mill dropped into Mr. Matting
ly's office and the girl's little ruse to
obtain a half dollar was brought up in
conversation. He had heard of her op
erations in other places, and it is bo
lieved that the clever little rogue has
victimized quite a numot-i of peopi*-.

BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 25.â The Derby
v.as finished to-day, and the winner
turned out to be Alex C, by Glenbetgh-

cas of San Rafael. Second place fell to
Cuba of Kenwood, by Olenbeigh Jr.-

field, and third to the English setter.
Lady Rodschaff. by Rod/chaff-Cruis
seda, owned by Frank Maskey of San
Francisco. Lady Rodschaff, being the
best setter in the trial, won the Bennett
Clip.
The all-age stake was next on the
bill of Care. After luncheon Count
Harold, handled by \Y. O. Couts of
Kenwood, met Hueno, the only pointer
In the trial, which was handled by Al
lender. Tin- dogs were cast off at 2
p. m., on pood ground, but it was some
time before Baeno pointed stanchly
and the Count refused tn liack. Al
lender fired and both dogs remained
steady to shot. Bueno pointed again,
but the bird ran and flushed after run
ning a few yards Th- Count ranged
splendidly, but showed poor dose and
poor judgment. The dogs were called
up at 2:40.
Nimrod E, handled by Allender, and
Dona Alicia, handled by Walters, were
cast off at 2:50, in a country profuse
with sage. The birds were rery un-
Bteady and continued on the run, but
Nimrod was nÂ«.t to be denied a place.
He kt-pt on the windward side of his
game and by roading he again drew
on point. Dona Alicia had also pointed
in a crouching position, but th.- birds
would not lay. Finally Dona pointed
Walters flushed and miss. d. Nimrod
was going like an old Trojan and road
ed a runner for several yards, finally
pointing stanchly. Allender shot and
crippled the bird. Dona again pointed
and was well backed. They were or
dered up at 4 o'clock.
The great event of the day came
next. It was the casting off of Cham
pion Dash Antonia, a double-time win
ner of the international cup, run at
Mitchells Bay. Canada, and also a
winner of the Manitoba all-aged stake
and other important events on bench
and field. He was handled by William
Coutts of Kenwood, Sonoma County
Hopp, a Portland dog. handled by
Dyse, was his opponent. The dogs
were cast off on an open piece of
ground' with enough cover so that the
spectators could see every point made
The Portland dog was first to locate
birds, but after being shot over he
grew excited and ranged wildly Scat
tering birds were found. Suffice It to
say that Dash electrified all observers
His work was perfect. He made point
after point and roaded his birds time
and again fully 400 yards, pointing
stanchly and holding steady to shot
The manner in which he covered
ground, coming to a point like a snap
when under full swing, was simply
grand. The great dog made not a sin
gle mistake, scoring at least forty
points while down. The critics took
their hats off to him and acknowledged
that he was the greatest field trial dog
they had ever seen. Dash was finally
lost after having roaded birds folly
half a mile. He was discovered at a
late hour by one of the party who was
looking him up in a small gully stanch
on point and waiting for orders.

PORTLAND, Or.. Jan. 25.â Gus
TYaohline, under sentence to be hanged
February 4 at Hilisboro for the mur
der of John D. Ledrick, made a state
ment to-day implicating Robert Buck,
a well known farmer. Wachline killed
LedrSck three years ago, made his es
cape, was captured last November and
tried six weeks ago, the verdict being
murder in the first degree. The con
fession is in part as follows:
One Friday in April. 1593, Mr. Buck,
with whom I was staying, took a rifle
and told me that he was going to look
for two cows on the range near the
Catholic church north of the farm of
John D. Ledrick. This was early in the
afternoon. He did not return until be
tween 9 and 10 o"clock that night. When
hi- returned be did not have the rifle, and
I asked him what he had done with It.
and he told me he had left it near the
Catholic church, as he did not care to
carry it back and would get it next day.
The next morning he asked me to go
with him. as be had found one of the
cows and one calf. I accompanied him, he
tarrying a double-barreled shotgun, and
when we reached the line fence between
tht- farm of Robert Buck and tne farm
of John D. Ledrick, he. the said Robert
Buck, informed me that he had killed
John D. Ledrick.
I did not believe him at the time, and
laughed at him: but he told me It was
true, and wished me to go to Ledriek's
house with him. I did so, and on reach-
Ing the house found Ledrick lying on the
floor, in what I supposed was the sitting
room. Bock then wanted me to carry
Ledrick*fl body to the barn. I refused.
He Instated, and I finally assisted in car
rying the body to the barn; and then ne
Insisted that I should bury it. I refused,
and he insited tnat I should, saying that
he would watch and see if any one came.
He then went to the house, cleaned up
the blood and then told me that he de
sired to bury the gun. he having previ
ously told me that he had shot John D.
Ledrick through the window, and then
having beaten him with a club, and at
thai time I saw the club in the sltlnc
! room of the house of John D. Leurick.
He then started north from the house of
i John P. Ledrick. and he found the rifle
I and burled It under a log about 200 yards
from the house of John D. Ledrick.
We then returned to the house of Rob
ert Buck and he made me promise that T
would not tell any one about the killing
of Ledrick. This Is all I had to do with
the killing of John P. Ledrick. I know
'. nothing whatever about his being dead
until informed of the fact by Robert
. Buck.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 25.â The Pacific

JURY FAILS TO AGREE.
VISAT.TA, Jan. 2. r >.â One of the longest
trials ever heard in the Superior Court
Of this county came to a close to-day
when the Jury in the Thomas M. Blake
will contest was discharged because it
cduld net agree upon a verdict. The
contest began on the 21st of December.
Over eighty witnesses were examined
and the expenses of the case amounted
to a small fortune, if lawyer's fees are
counted, for five of the best attorneys
were employed.
The contest aroused wide interest.
Blake, the maker of the will, was an
old pioneer of this vicinity and the fam
ily is known up and down the valley and
In San Francisco. The Blake estate was
conservatively valued at $23,000 at the
time of the testator's death last Septem
ber. Nine > ears before that he had
married a second wife, who was younger
than his five grown daughters, and the
daughters refused to have anything to
do with the new Mrs. T'.lake. At Blake's
death he left his wife and three small
children much more of the estate by his
will than the prown daughters thought
was just, hence the attempt to break
the will, the charge being that he was of
unsound mind and that the will was pro
cured through undue influence on the
part of the wife.
The jury stood seven for the contest
ants and five for the widow, after hav
iiitr been out nearly seventy-two hours.
The contestants are talking of a second
trial.

RECOGNIZES
RIGHTS OF
HAWAIIANS
Mr. Damon Makes
a Speech That Is
Applauded.
But It Is Not Relished
by Other Members of
Dole's Cabinet.
Question of Voting Population
Being in the Minority Can't
Hold on Forever.
WOULD SOOTHE NATIVES.
P!ea for the Pardon of Political
i 'ffenrior-3, However, Is Opposed
by Annexationists.
Corrospondpncp of The fall.
HONOLULU, Jan. 17.â T0-<lay is the
fifth anniversary of the deposition of
the Hawaiian monarchy and the as
sumption of power by the Provisional
Government, the predecessor of the
present republic. It is observed as a
Government holiday and recognized
only by a small minority of the peo
ple. Its only celebration is in the form
of a military parade to especially re
mind the people that they are con
trolled by an armed force which hav
ing once conquered them is still com
petent to hold them in subjection un
til brighter days dawn. Those days
cannot be far distant, for the Minister
of Finance has touched a chord that
has been responded to almost unani
mously, and with enthusiasm, by the
people of all parties, annexationists, in
dependent, republican and royalists,
except a very exclusive and very big
oted minority whose influence is wan
ing daily.
Mr. Damon has boldly uttered, in
the presence of his colleagues and the
solemn Council of State, the following
memorable words: "This question of
the voting population being in the
minority cannot hold on forever." His
speech throughout is marked with force
and liberality and is not pleasing to
one of his colleagues â the Attorney-
General â and even the acting Presi
dent and Minister of Foreign Affairs is
not especially charmed with it, for
viewed from the standpoint of a poli
tician Mr. Damon hus scored a very
strong point !'t fore the electorate of
Beptemb.-r, 1899, which, in the event of
there being no annexation, will num
ber from twelve to fifteen thousand;
for it has been almost decided that the
oath to the republic, the anti-restora
tion portion as well, shall be swallowed
Whole in order that the people's voice,
shall be heard at the ballot box in no
mistaken I ea in the election of the
6enat< a: [ouse of Representatives,
ar - d ' . the President in Sep
tember, Th" Council of State
Will then also be renewed, for it is con
stituted of live members elected by the
Senate, five by the House of Represen
tatives and five appointed by the Pres
ident with the approval of the Cabi
net.
The Council of State met on the 14th
to consider the full pardon, restoration
to civil rights, and the remission of
fines pending over them, of the few re
maining unfortunate political prisoners
who were entangled in the much-falsi
fied and exaggerated emeute of 1895
and who for many months have been on
parole and have conducted themselves
In a most exemplary manner in spite
of the treatment they received.
It was generally anticipated that
these concessions would have been al
most unanimously granted, but when
the test came it was found that one
or two narrow-minded men, for the
cake of the influence they thought it
might have in the Senatorial debates
on the question of annexation, and to
gratify personal spleen, discovered
that there had been no formal petitions
lor pardon and no formal promises al
though they had been honest though
Informal ones, of taking the oath of
allegiance to the republic. After a
debate that at times approached to the
limits of temper and in which the ex
ecutive was soundly berated by its
firmest friends the matter was deferred
on technicalities. " Â«â¢â¢â¢â 
The opposition was led by the Attor
ney-General, who is deeply galled by
the personal and political antagonisms
he has earned since he learned a little
law in a ministerial capacity.
The able leader of the House of Rep
resentatives, Hon. A. G. M. Robertson
himself one of the most active lawyers
In connection with the Military Com
mission of 1595. spoke forcibly. He de
sired the Ministry to learn the feelings
entertained by the Council. He was
decidedly in favor of pardoning all the
political prisoners on parole and of re
mitting their fines. Their offense had
passed away, and these fines hanging
over their heads embarrassed them in
Boclal and business life.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs
availed himself of the technical points
advanced by the Attorney-Genera]
that formal application and formal
promises Bhould humbly be made by
the paroled prisoners. He claimed that
the executiveâ by which he really
meant W. O. Smith and H. E. Cooper
had so decided.
The Councilors began to show symp
toms of annoyance and revolt, and
were only half quieted when Mr. Da
mon, the Minister of Finance, rose and
with marked emphasis as he looked at
the twin rulers of the homogeneous
Cabinet said: "I feel myself that the
time has arrived when we ought to
hold out the right hand of fellowship
to any on" who has been in opposition
to us in the past, and who shows a de-
Blre, even if, as it has been expressed
at the very last moment, to recognize
the republic. It seems to me wise that
NEW TO-DAY.
Pears' soap is health to

If you wash with proper
soap, your skin will be

your health is bad.
we should forget the past and look
ahead to the brighter future. The
most of these men are Hawaiian*, and
now looking at it in a purely political
spirit it seems to me that it is our
golden opportunity to say to the Ha
walians: 'You have been in opposition
to us; we respect your feelings; we
respect you more because you have
seen fit to come forward and recognize
the republic and forget the past.'
"It has been no easy affair for the
Hawaiiana, nor is it so to-day for
them, to recognize the change in af
fairs. Foreigners are accustomed to
a republic, but the Hawaiian has been
brought up for generations to look up
to his chief and his sovereign. And he
does feel a dread of the power of the
â¦ uajsis J9U. 'uosiJAl priÃK esjj^ -â¦-
foreigner coming here. He feels as
though he was to be brushed to one
side, and I believe this is an opportu
nity for us now to say to him: 'The
door is open; we are ready to forget
the past.'
"Whether we are to be annexed to
the great republic in a very short time
or in a longer time, we should be ready
to welcome those who are in opposition
to us. If we are not ready now after
a lapse of practically five years, my
opinion is that that time will never
come. Five years is time enough to
make up our minds whether we are
going to call the past quits and start
in again. It seems to me that the re
public is too well established to harbor
this enmity. We want to go ahead and
progress in this country. This question
of the voting population being in the
minority cannot hold on forever. If we
are a republic we want to have a com
mon country and a common ground to
work upon; and to say that a part of
this community is to be kept outside
the pale seems to me a great mistake,
and 1 have always urged this in the
past. Every time we have taken an
advance step and allowed those who
are ready to come in and join us we
have never lost ground. It has always
been a help to us to take that step, and
I maintain that it is the proper step
for us to take at this Mime."
Several other Councillors indorsed
most warmly the views of Minister Da
mon and even Councillor Wilder prac
tically reprimanded the executive forre
missness in not having brought the
matter properly before the Council, but
as the Council had not been called to
consider it he hoped the executive
would take care to bring it properly
before the Council at its next session.
It is anticipated that whatever Mr.
Smith's or Mr. Cooper's views may be
Ministers Damon and King will insist
upon the question being brought up at
the next Council when the pardons will
probably be granted by a practically
unanimous vote. It is becoming quite
evident that so far as our ministry is
concerned, "two dogs never agree about
a bone," and they are becoming wo
fully and dismally alarmed at the num
erous questions they will have to an
swer in the Legislature next month in
regard to their ministerial actions.
In the first place there is a strong
impression that a large amount of pub
lic money has been lavishly expended
in some mysterious manner in connec
tion with the annexation fight, and the
expenses of President Dole's Junketing
trip will be criticized.
Another battle they will have to fight
will be in regard to the Japanese
claims and dispute. Another impor
tant one will be in regard to their re
ticence in connection with the claims
made for redress by American, British.
Portuguese, Norwegian, Danish and
other citizens to the number of two
score or thereabouts for illegal deten
tion in 1895. It is believed that, ex
cept in one or two instances, the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs contends that
in accordance with British precedents,
and notably in the famous Jamaica
case, the Hawaiian Government was
Justified in its auctions and is not re
sponsible to any one for the injustice
it did. Interesting developments,
it is learned, are, however, near at
hand.
The Japanese Minister has informed
The Call correspondent that he is still
awaiting replies from his Government
to his request for more definite instruc
tions in connection with his previous
dispatches in regard to certain points
in dispute before he can again com
municate with the Hawaiian Govern
ment. It is not improbable that, ow
ing to the changes and conditions In
Japan, these may be delayed for some
time to come unless, perchance, they
arrive by the steamers due this week.
He asserts most firmly that in the cor
respondence he has already received
there is no limitation of $200,000, or any
sum whatever, mentioned as to possi
ble claims Japan may have rendered
in her favor against Hawaii. He also
permitted your correspondent to leave
with the impression that Japan w.ould
adhere to the King of the Belgians as
arbitrator and not accept the Hawaiian
suggestion of three Jurists in his Ma
jesty's stead, and further that Japan
would probably contend that she could
not retire from the position she has as
sumed in the correspondence, but, of
course, he could not divulge the nature
of instructions which he has not yet re
ceived. He was under the impression
that if Hawaii became annexed the
T'nited States would act friendly to
ward Japan and see that justice was
done to her citizens who felt them
selves aggrieved by the conduct of the
Hawaiian Government.
The officers of the Bennington gave
a very charming reception ami dance
on the evening of the 14th. The ship
was gaily illuminated and decorated
and the attendance select. Tho acting
President, Government officials, mem
bers of the diplomatic and consular
corps, Hon. A. S. Cleghorn and Prin
cess Kaiulani and other distinguished
society people were present.

Major Carter Tells Why He Is Opposed to the

NEW YORK, Jan. 25.â A special to

He is a white man, of American par

In discussing the expediency of annex
ation Major darter said to-night:
"1 am too k lan American to want
to see the United States annex Hawaii,
and too good a Hawaiian to want to

Moreover, the desire of the whites for
annexation is waning."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JA\t T AT?Y 26, 1898.
DECLINES A POLITICAL HONOR.
Ex-Sheriff Wilson Will Not Be Sacramento's
Chief of Police.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.â Mayor William H. Land has returned
from San Francisco, whither he went, it was understood, to take part
in the festivities attendant on the celebration of the Golden Jubilee.
But he had a mission on business as well, and the object of his visit
has been Just learned. He had gone to the Bay City to see J. W. Wil
son, one of Sacramento's best known and most respected citizens, who
is at present acting as one of the Judges at the Ingleside race track, to
offer him the nomination of Chief of Police of Sacramento. The City
Trustees having refused to confirm the nomination of William Lowell for
that position. Mayor Land made up his mind to get a man whose ap
pointment would be confirmed without hesitation, and J. W. Wilson
was that man beyond the remotest possibility of a doubt.
Mr. Wilson gained a flattering vote for the Mayoralty on the Repub
lican ticket when B. IT. Steinman divided the Republican vote with
him. He has held with honor and to the satisfaction of all his constitu
ents the office of Sheriff of the county, and also of Supervisor, and by
reason of his public spirit, his ability, his enterprise and his unques
tioned integrity, he is to-day one of the most popular citizens of the
county.
After Mayor Land had stated the object of his visit, he was very
much disappointed to be met with a declination of the proffered
honor. Mr. Wilson's declination was expressed in the most positive
terms. He would do almost anything in the world for his friend, the
Mayor, but he was satisfied with his business position, and therefore
he would not accept the nomination under any circumstances. Mr.
Wilson added that he was out of public life, and that he wished to con
tinue so as long as possible.
Mayor Land to-night sent to the City Trustees the nomination of
Thomas Dwyer to be Chief of Police. Dwyer is a young man of su
perior intelligence and qualifications for the place, and, though there
is always politics in these matters, it is believed he will be confirmed.

Meet in Convention at
Denver for Mutual
Protection.
Brighter Prospects for the In
dustry in Its Various
Branches.
Grievances Against Transportation
Companies That May Be Remedied
by Legislation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER. Jan. 25.â The first session
of the National Stock-Growers' Con
vention was called to order in the Col
isseum Hall at 10:30 o'clock by George
L.. Gouldlng, chairman of the general
committee of arrangements. There
were present about 1000 delegates, rep
resenting twenty-one States and Ter
ritories of the West, Northwest and
Southwest.
In a few words the chairman stated
the object of the meeting. He said that
the years of depression to which the
cattle industry had been subjected had
caused a loss in that branch of busi
ness of hundreds of millions, but that
there now uppeared brighter prospects
for stock-growing in its various
branches and this convention was
called to consider the new conditions.
Governor Alva Adams welcomed the
delegates in the name of the State. He
dwelt upon the difference between the
present conditions and those of ten
years ago, when, as Governor of Colo
rado, he welcomed a similar body of
delegate* to the State. His spee< h warn
very optimistic for the stock-growing
industry. He urged the cattle men
and the sheep men to get together and
adjust their differences.
Mayor T. S. McMurray of Denver de
livered a welcome on behalf of the city.
John W. Springer, president of the
Continental Cattle Company of Texas,
was elected temporary chairman of the
convention. He was escorted to the
chair by Governor Richards of Wyom
ing and Lieutenant-Governor Brush of
Colorado.
Charles EL Gould of Nebraska was
chosen temporary secretary; K. E. Mc-
Ginnes of St. Paul reading clerk, and
W. H. O'Brien of Denver sergeant-at
arms.
The afternoon programme opened
with an address by G. F. Patrick of
Pueblo, on 'The Benefits to Be Derived
From an Interstate Organization. "
He argued that organizations of pack
ers and carriers had forced the stock
growers to organize. He cited many
abuses Buffered by shippers from rail
road companies, stockyard companies
and packers. Local organizations, he
Bald, could not properly meet these
abuses. He declared that individual
shippers were at the mercy of the im
mense organizations and could not ex
pect prosperity unless they were pre
pared to meet combination with com
bination.

INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 25.â Four hun
dred delegates were present at the
Grand Opera-house to-day when
Chairman Hanna of the executive com
mittee called the monetary convention
to order. Two Governors â Governor
Mount of Indiana and Governor Shaw
of lowaâ were the speakers at the af
ternoon session. Governor Mount de
livered the speech of welcome, and
Governor Shaw spoke for more than an
hour on the gold standard and the re
tirement of the greenbacks.
Governor Mount spoke briefly. His
speech was an earnest plea tor the
maintenance uf the gold standard. He
showed that Thomas Jefferson, the
founder of Urn Democratic party, held
stoutly to the belief that the local
ratio of coinage Bhould conform to the
mercantile ratio of the metals, and he
queried in this connection how this at
titude would compare with modern
Bryanism, which insists upon 16 to 1
as the legal ration, while the commer
cial ratio is S3 to 1.
He pictured the disastrous results
which would follow from the free coin
age of silver in this country, and as
serted that (apital would seek invest
ment in this lountry only when as-
Bured of the .soundness of our money
system.
At the conclusion of Governor
Mount's address Chairman Hanna pre
st-ntt-d Governor Shaw of lowa to the
convention v its permanent chairman.
Governor Shaw made an interesting
address on the money question.
Upon the conclusion of the speech of
Governor Shaw, Chairman Hanna re
quested th<- State delegations to select
vicfe-presidents and members of the
committe <>n resolutions, to be re
ported before the evening session. The
convention then adjourned until 7
o'clock, when addresses were to be de
livered to ;i large audience by Hon. C.
Stuart Patterson of Philadelphia and
Colonel Jacob T. Greene of Connecti
cut. Mr. Patterson spoke on behalf of
the monetary commission as one of its
members.
. The executive committee ', was con
tinued by the unanimous vote to-day
and will be given power to add to its
members. It held a meeting in the
morning and resolved to prosecute the
fight for currency reform to the ut
most and to make an effort to raise
the necessary funds by impressing up
on the business community the import
ance of placing the currency upon a
stable hasia.

CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â Another severe
6torm similar to that of Saturday swept
down upon the city from the northeast
this morning and raged till late in the
afternoon. It started out with an in
tensity that promised to literally bury
Chicago, and when it ceased another
six inches had been added to the half
a foot of snow that fell Saturday. The
drifts of the first storm remain and
were made higher by the fresh down
fall.
The storm caused great inconvenience
and delays on all transportation lines.
Of through trains on lines centering in
Chicago two were reported missing
early this evening. One trf them was the
St. Paul limited of the Great Western
Railroad, and the other a train running
between Chicago and Eau Claire on the
Wisconsin Central road. Nothing has
been heard from either of the trains
since their departure. The wires along
the roads are down at many points,
but at those where communication is
possible nothing has been heard of
them, and officials of the road say the
trains are snowbound.
Other roads fared scarcely better, but
the storm played havoc with their
time tables, and there was hardly a
through train that arrived on the ap
pointed hour.
The suburban service on the rail- i
roads as well as street railways was
delayed. Many trains from outside
points were snowbound, and those that
arrived, all of them behind time,
reached their destination by plowing
through snow banks several feet in
depth. Trains from Kansas City and
other surrounding points encountered
the most trying obstacles, as their
route was directly through the path of j
the storm.
The entire Middle West was a prey
to the ravages of the blizzard, and re
ports from 300 points from Winnipeg
and Montreal on the north and east to
St. Louis and Denver on the south and
west indicate a snow fall of sufficient
depth to practically put a stop to all
traffic. Through the entire territory a
high wind raged which caused drifts
in the prairie districts of lowa, Nebras
ka, Minnesota and Western Illinois, in
some instances twenty feet deep, which
will, when they cross wagons or rail
roads, require several days to clear
away. Cattlemen of Nebraska fear the
herds will suffer, particularly if the
prevailing winds should be accom
panied by a falling of the thermometer,
in which case the snow, which was
very wet, will freeze so hard that cat
tle cannot graze through It.
At St. Louis the storm was accom
panied by a vivid electrical display and
wind of Buch velocity as to recall the
terrible cyclone of 1896. It blew at the
rate of sixty-three miles an hour. Au
gust Weymeyer, a carpenter, was
blown from the Shields school roof and
killed. Thomas J. Peterson, 4 years old.
was blown from a porch roof at his
home and killed. Mrs. Sarah Lorin
was caught under a falling fence and
will probably die. Mrs. Dodridge, wife
of the general manager of the Missouri
Pacific Railway, was struck by flying
debris, but not seriously hurt. Many
minor Injuries of the same character
are reported.
At 2 o'clock this (Wednesday) morn
ing several trains were reported miss-
Ing by the Chicago and Northwestern
and Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Tf ul
on their Western lines, and fears for
the comfort of the passengers aboard
are entertained by the officials. When
the coal srives out the steam will go
down and the cars become untenable.
If the trains are not near farm houses,
where food and shelter can be pro
cured, some fatalities from exposure
I may result.

NEW YORK. Jan. 25.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Should Spain send a man-of-war to an
American harbor the administration, it
was told by an official, will extend
every courtesy possible to her officers.
Having publicly announced that the
Maine's visit to Havana was solely a
friendly one, they would regard the
presence here of a Spanish man-of-war
in the same light.
Minister de Lome had been advised
of the purpose of Spain to send a ves
pel here at this time. He considered
it quite a natural thing to do. He
could see no reason why vessels of both
countries should not freely enter har
bors of each other, and one of the best
evidences of the peaceful condition of
affairs in Cuba and of the friendly re
lations between the two countries
would be an exchange of friendly calls
by naval vessels.
Another Spanish representative with
whom I talked remarked that the
Spanish were a very polite people, and
would not be outdone in courtesies.
The State Department received to
night a dispatch from Consul-General
Lee, announcing that Captain Sigsbee,
commanding: the Maine, had paid him
an official visit, which he would re
turn. The condition of affairs in
Havana remains quiet.

BOSTON, Jan. 25.â There is a big
sensation at Harvard, and serious con
sequences are feared. One of the most
startling tricks played at Harvard for
some years was the insult which some
undergraduates offered this morning
to Professor Barrett Wendell. As Pro
fessor Wendell was starting on his lec
ture on English literature the bell of
an alarm clock situated in the rear of
the lecture room startled the 400 stu
dents. A half hearty laugh on the part
of the listeners and a serious smile on
the face of the professor followed.
After the bell had ceased ringing he
continued. But just when the lecturer
had recovered himself and was pro
ceeding to take up his comments again
another clock started off somewhere
behind the lecturer's seat. Then a third
burred away. The professor, after
making a short, almost unheard com
ment, took his hat and coat and left
the room, while the class applauded.
A few of the men, It is understood, re
mained behind to hunt up the clocks
which were stationed at various places
in the room, some of which had not
yet gone off. The profeÃsor returned
to the lecture room just when these
men were leaving with their clocks,
and that he took the clocks away from
the students with appropriate remarks
and that he hurled the ticking things
against the outside walls of the build
ing so as to break them goes without
saying.
The incident was the one topic of
conversation throughout the university
all day. On several hands the men ex
pressed an Intention of doing some
thing to show Professor Wendell that
the great majority of the members of
the class are very sorry for what hap
pened, that they do not countenance
such proceeedings and that they will
do all in their power to have the of
fenders made known and punished. It
is becoming more and more evident
that unless some way is found of en
forcing better conduct in the large lec
ture courses at Harvard this system
must give way to something else.
Should this happen, as Is threatened,
it will mean that the eminent profes
sors at Harvard, such as Professors Sha
ler, Norton, James, Royce.Taussig, Hart,
Charming, MacVean, Wendell and oth
ers who all conduct large and popular
courses, must be reduced in their
sphere of influence â an event that
would be much lamented by every one
who has the best interests of collegiate
education at heart, and which would
certainly make the cheek of every true
Harvard man burn for shame.
RAYMOND'S DAY
OF DOOM SET
REDWOOD CITT, Jan. 25.â C. H. Ray
mond, alias Samuel Moore, who was ar
rested, tried and convicted for the mur
der of C. A. Andrews at Baden, was to
day brought before Judge Buck to receive
his death sentence. A large crowd con
gregated at the Courthouse, curious to
get another glimpse of the murderer,
who may soon expiate his crime on the
gallows. The attorney for Raymond, C.
H. Kirkbride, made the usual motion for
a new trial, but it was denied. Thirty
days were allowed him in which to pre
pare his bill of exceptions, to be used in
an appeal to the Supreme Court. Ray
mond was then told to stand up, and was
admonished by the court and sentenced
to be hanged by the neck until dead.
During the ordeal the prisoner was
probably the coolest person in the court
room. He never flinched nor betrayed
the least excitement. The Sheriff was di
rected to deliver him to the "Warden at
Folsom, to be there confined until the Bth
day of April, the date set for the execu
tion. On this day, at the same place.
Winters, the accomplice of Raymond,
who was also convicted of the murder,
will hang for his crime.
Raymond has a most sanctimonious ex
pression on his face and was known while
serving time in Folsom at "The Parson."
While there he was at the head of al
most every revolt and disturbance that
took place, but when he goes back this
time it will be as a close prisoner.

"Washington, Jan. 25.
To-day's session of the Senate was
characterized by a heated, almost acri
monious debate of the financial ques
tion. For nearly two hours the Teller
resolution was under consideration, the
principal speeches being made by Alli
son of lowa, Berry of Arkansas and
Hoar of Massachusetts. The sharpest
colloquy was at times Indulged in be
tween the advocates and opponents of
the resolution, the debate often ap
proaching bitterness. The feature of
the discussion was a speech by Teller,
author of the resolution, his statement
calling out a suggestion from Hoar that
he (Teller) ought to have them stricken
from the record. In response to an in
quiry by Spooner, Vest admitted that
he though the system of coinage re
ferred to in the resolution meant the
free and unlimited coinage of silver,
that admission apparently giving sat
isfaction to the opponents of the meas
ure.
The Senate, on motion of Hoar of Mas
sachusetts, went into executive session
to-day as soon as it convened. The doors
were opened at 12:13, and Quay secured
the passage of the bill to indemnify the
Etate of Pennsylvania for money expend
ed In 1864 for militia called into service
rnment. The amount in

Butler of Is'orth Carolina offered an
amendment to the postoffice bill provid
â  tn. extension of rural free dcliv-
S< â  Btnd Territory of the
Union, and to as many sections "of those
- and Territories as possible.
Butler p;ud the amendments -had been
drawn after full consultation with the
/ istn eral.
" Perkins of California called up the pen
sion appropriation bill. The amendment
proposed by Alien providing that the low
est pension paid by the Government be
J^ per month was ruled out of order.
Allen then offered an amendment to the
bill increasing the amount appropriated
from $141,000,000 to (148,000,000 in accord
ance with the estimates made by the
Commissioner of Pensions, but it was lost
without division. The pension bill was
then parsed.
The Teller resolution was then laid be
fore the Senate. Allison reviewed the
history of the Stanley Matthews resolu
tion, maintaining that its purpose at that
time was not in oposition to public inter
est or in derogation of the rights of the
public creditors. He held now that the
situation was different. He insisted that
the pending resolution Rave the Secre
tary of th<' Treasury no more authority
under the law that he had now. Th<
retary may now pay Government obliga
tions in coin. He held that there was no
disposition upon the part of the adminis
tration to evade the law. and added that
the Republican party had maintained
that it ought tn be the purpose of the
Government to maintain the pold and sil
ver money of the country at ;t parity.
Tillman asked Allison whether he would
Fay in terms that the bond obligations of
the Government were payable in silver.
In reply Allison quoted'the law that the
bonds were payable in coin, but that was
not satisfactory to Tillman, who insisted
upon an answer "yes" or "no."
Allison declined to have words put into
his mouth. In response to a question of
Teller, Allison said he thought it would
be proper for the Secretary of the Treas
ury to pay the obligatk>ns"of the Govern.
ment in either stiver or gold.
"But," declared Allison, "the Secretary
of the Treasury, if he is an honest man,
in reaching his derision of action upon
that point must take into consideration
existing conditions, one of which is that
the Government is pledged to maintain
the gold and silver currency of the coun
try at a parity."
Allison thought if it were the purpose of
the advocates of the pending resolution to
force a depreciation of one of the great
i meys of the country they ought to i
, ow that purpose. He maintained that
i the objects of the silver advocates
carried into effect it would be im*
possible to main tain the parity of gold
and silver coin. "If I were assured." said
he, "that the resolution would strengthen
the credit of the country I should cer
tainly vote for it."
Berry il>.> of Arkansas, in an extended
speech, declared that the pen. ling resolu
tion was precisely the .same as that for
whk-h the Senator from lowa (Allison)
twentw years ago. If it was not
a violation of publi" faith then, he added
It could not be so now. One of the re<i- i
sons why Berry was desirous of the pas
t the resolution was that it would
disprove the charge brought in 1896 that \
the Democratic party was composed of i
repudiationists and dishonorable men.
Aldrich of Rhode Islandâ Do you desire
â¢â¢ from the Secretary of the Treas
ury his discretion to pay Government ob
ligations in either gold or silver?
Berryâ The trouble is the Secretary of
the . has turned over the Gov
ernment option to the bondholders
Aldrichâ Would the passage of the
resolution by the Senate and Hous* act
as instructions t o the Secretary of the
Treasury?
"It would," replied Berry, "but I am
satisfied, in view of the recent actions
and words of the Secretary of the Treas
ury, that he would not obey the instruc
tions."
Hale of Maine said â¢when the present
law was put In the statute book silver
was about twice aa valuable as It Is now,
and Aldrich interjected the inquiry
whether, in view of the fall in the price
of silver, the Senator from Arkansas
(Berry) believed the Government ought
to take advantage of its creditor and
pay him In tli<- cheaper money.
Berry replied that ho was aa much in
favor of maintaining the honor of the
country a.s the Senator from Rhode
Island, but he held that the bondholders
ought to be willing to live up to their
contract and accept coin In payment.
Lodge of Massachusetts said it was well
understood that the bond purchasers
to be paid in gold, as they paid gold
'Â« r the bonds, and he quoted from a
speech of Teller showing that he (Teller)
had the same ld<
Berry denied that there was such an
understanding and would defy anybody
to establish as a fact that there was
such. Berry said that the country had
before It the spectacle or a Secretary of
the Treasury who wanted to redeem sil
ver dollars In gold and firmly to fasten
J? c S old standard upon the country, yet
the President had not the nerve to ""kick
him out of the Cabinet." In conclusion
Berry made an appeal for the passage of
the resolution on the ground of public
interest.
Teller followed in an extended speech
in favor of the resolution. He declared it
was a question of law which he wooW
discuss.
"Well." inquired Foraker, "doea this
resolution mean the same now as it did
twenty years ago?"
"Bping a question of law," replied Tel
ler, "it can mean notning else."
"But was not the resolution of twenty
years ago," persisted Foraker, "paased
to meet a state of affairs existing then
that does not now ex:.-=t?"
"Not at all." replied the Colorado Sen
ator. "No man could then have known
what financial legislation Congress would
enact. The resolution then bound no man
to vote for frt-e coinage, and it binds no
man to so vote."
Hoar dissented from Teller's proposi
tion that this resolution involved a ques
tion of law. and urged that it fame now
to a question of honor.
"This is not a question of law." said he;
"it is a question r>f the violation of pub-
He faith. Bhylock had the law on his side
for a good wnlle, but nobody said that
Shylock. without degradation of the
rights of Antonio, could take the pound of
flesh."
Teller contended that he had quite as
much regard for the national honor as
had the members of the Senate.
"I am getting tired." shouted Toller, "of
the position assumed by certain Senators
here because they live In the Eastern part
of this country. They are no more honest,
they are no more strenuous in upholding
the public honor than J am. 1 want to say
here, and now, that T believe in paying
the debts of the Government in silver,
even if that is the cheaper metal. The
Government has the right to the differ
ence, according to Its contract. The silver
dollar which the gentleman from lowa
(Allison) says is not as good as the gold
dollar is paid to the mechanic, the artisan
and laborer in liquidation of obliga
Incurred with them; and I hold that the
bond purchaser Is no b< tt< r than the man
with the blistered hands, and ought to be
paid In the same money. ThÂ»' Secretary
of the Treasury la now bound by law to
regard the Interests of ili.> i pie, but
that departm.-nt has been making laws
to suit itself for twenty years."
Teller held that there could be no deg
radation in paying the bills of the Gov
ernment in silver.
Fair bank arose, and endeavored to pro
pose a question to Teller.
"Sit down!" cried the <'<>lorado Senator.
"I've been badgered enough!"
As Fairbanks sat down. Teller said he
would answer to-morrow the question,
but he did hot desire to be Interrupted
now. Teller declared, in conclusion, that
he had Been the national treasury robbed
â a transaction the most disgraceful ever
iplished by a national administra
tion. In view of that fact, he thought
that the arrogation to themselves by the
opponents of the resolution in all honesty
was not warranted by facts.
Hoar replied to Teller m a speech in
which he deplored "the remarkable ef
fort" of the ''olorado Senator. He con
tended that the question was not one ,if
legal power, but of honor and good faith.
He would not say that the Senator from
Colorado had "squirmed" out of the ques
tion, nor would he order him to "sit
down" as he had ordered the Senator
from Indiana.
Tellerâ l win strike that out of my
speech.
"If I were the Senator." said Hoar. "I
would have the entire speech stricken
from the record."
Following Hoar, Rawllns (D.) of Utah
spoke in support of the resolution, taking
occasion to reply to some statements made
by Hoar concerning the deposits in sav
ings banks.
Hale declared the debate during the
day had settled the fact that it was the
desire of the advocates of the resolution
to bring the country to a silver basis and
to make the payment of all debts, public
and private, in silver which was now
worth less than half what gold is worth.
lie was willing, he said, to have the peo
ple of the country pass upon that propo
sition.
"It was voted down in ISM." declared
Hale, "and I have no fear that the Amer
ican people will take the back track upon
it."
Vest of Missouri insisted that the Maine
Senator's remarks had placed the advo
cates of the resolution in a false light.
"We are not monometallists. 1 ' said he,
"but bimetallists. While I do not care to
discuss the question at this late hour, I
think I can demonstrate that the free
coinage of silver would raise the price of
that metal to its former value. I main
tain that the opening of the mints to the
free coinage of silver would not be in vio
lation of the public honor."
Allison asked Vest whether he thought
the Bland-Allison act in substantial com
pliance with the concurrent resolutions of
twenty years ago.
"This is no financial kindergarten."
said Vest. "The Senator from lowa ought
to know what the Bland-Allison act
meant, because he framed it himself."
"I want it understood." declared Alli
son, "that the resolution of IST* did not
mean the free coinage of silver, as the
Senators from Colorado (Teller) and from
Missouri (Vest) have both said that this
resolution means. I want an answer to
my question, and if it requires a financial
kindergarten to obtain an answer I would
like to have the Senator from Missouri
open such a school now."
Vest did not deem it necessary, he said,
to extend the colloquy further at so late
an hour, but he asked that the amend
ment to the resolution offered by Lodge
earlier in the day be read for Information.
The Senate then, at 5:46, adjourned.
SUDDEN DEATH
OF MRS. HAGER
Heart Disease Claims the

Close of a Life Crowned With a
Record of Generous
Deeds.
Mrs. Elizabeth Hager, one of the best
known society women of San Francisco,
whose hospitality and great benevolence
were far-famed, died suddenly at her
home at Sacramento and Gough streets
yesterday forenoon. Though she had
been as well as usual during the morning
her death was not a great surprise, as it
had long been known to her family and
friends that she was likely to die of heart
disease at any moment. She had long
been a sufferer from that ailment and
physicans gave her no hope. So her de
mise was not without warning.
Mrs. Hager was born !n St. Louis,
where her family was an old and aristo
cratic, one. She was married before she
net the late Judge John S. Hager, ex-
Collector of the Port, her name at that
time being Mrs. Hicks. For many years
she had been known as one of the most
charitable of all the society women of
California. Though popular at summer
resorts and in the highest social circles
she was equally beloved in the wider
ranks of those who were often the re
cipients of benefits at her hands. She
was particularly well known in Los An

Wide Scope of Talk
on an Appropria

Prosperity Returned
to the Country.

Indians.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Rlggs Honse,
Washington, Jan. 25.
Fnder the parliamentary fiction of
discussing the Indian appropriation
i bill the House devoted almost the en
' tire day to a political debate in which
the main question was whether pros
perity had come to the country, as a
result of the advent of the present ad
; ministration. As speeches were limit
i ed to five minutes many members par
ticipated, and partisan spirit kept the
interest keyed up to a high pitch. The
\ acrimony which usually characterizes
such debates was almost entirely ab
sent, and, although good-natured,
; some hard knocks were given and re
: ceived. Smith, the delegate from Ari
zona, made an attack on the system of
educating the Indians, and Walker
i moved to strike out the appropriation
I for the Carlisle school. No vote was
j taken on the motion to-day.
When the session opened a bill was
passed granting an American register to
the foreign-buiTt steamer Navaio.
The }(Âuse then went Into Committee
of the Who].- and resumed consideration
Of the Indian appropriation bill.
The House consumed a considerable
portion of the afternoon in a discussion
of industrial conditions. Republicans af-
Hrming and Democrats denying that
prosperity had returned.
Richardson (D.) of Tennessee adduced
some figures and financial authorities to
that prosperity had not yet ap
peared.
"If prosperity has not returned," asked
Stone i h.i of Pennsylvania, "how does
it happen that in all the Industrial re
gtons men are employed and that they
are not supported by charity as they
were under the Cleveland admlnistra
tion?"
â The trouble *v;th the gentleman," re
plled Richardson, "is that his premises
are all wrung. Labor is rmt employed In
all the Industrial regions. In New En
gland 125,000 workers 4re now out on
Grosvonor, Stone, Dingley and other
Republicans rose to reply, and in the
confusion Richardson called out that he
had no desire to interfere with Stones
gubernatorial boom.
â¢"I am glad to have the indorsement of
that side," replied Stone, smiling.
Qrosvenor cited the wool-raising indus
try v an example of what the Dlngley
law had done.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri, in discussing
the cotton mills strike, contended that
the strike had been urged by tho operat
ors in order that they might dlspo
their surplus stock. The trouble was we
\\'V enormously over-producing in this
country and in the face of that fact the
Republican party was restricting and
narrowing our markets.
The political debate continued for an
hour, the Republicans maintaining and
the Democrats denying the existence of
prosjx rity.
Smith (D.) of Arizona made an attack
on the present system of educating the
Indians. He declared that the Carlisle
and Hampton schools were a mistake
that an Indian could not be civilized by
Tef.chfng him to read and write and sing
dm. The Indian, he said, must re
an Industrial education, but It must
be given him in the vicinity of hia home
not in the East. In this Dill, he said V -
500.000 was wasted. ' '
Walker (R. > of Massachusetts agreed
with Smith that the present policy WAS
unsatisfactory, illogical and impractica
ble. He moved to strike out the appro
priation for the Carlisle school. Without
voting on th*> amendment, the committee
rose and at 5:20 p. m. the House ad
journed.

POLITICIANS
AT WAR IN
ALAMEDA
Plan to Purchase the
Enquirer Now-
Pending.
G. B. Daniels Anxious to
Get a Controlling
Interest.
Superintendent Leach Too
Busy to Work Actively in
Politics.
DAVIS' CAMP DOUBTFUL.
A Syndicate- of Pardee Men Said to
Desire the Interest of Mr.
Leaoh.
Alameda politicians are now working
in wholesale lots. So warm has begun
the contest over the nomination for
Governor on the Republican ticket
that the plcayunish system of trying
to take away each other's support one
vote at a time has been cast to the
winds and an attempt has been made
to obtain bodily at one sweep the main
strength of one of the candidates in
the interest of some one else.
The bone of contention between the
two camps headed by ex -Mayor Davis
and Dr. Pardee is the support of Frank
A. Leach, Superintendent of the Mint,
and his active evening paper, the Oak
land Enquirer, which has always been
a powerful factor in politics across the
bay.
It has been surmised for some time
that Superintendent Leach is not at all
anxious to make an active canvass or
indeed do any active work at all in
the coming State campaign. A few
months ago he became forcibly in favor
of W. R. Davis for Governor. He in
dorsed him editorially and gave him
substantial assistance in organizing
his campaign committee. At this tine
it was not known definitely that Et.
Pardee was coming out as a candidate.
When he did so Mr. Leach's position
was not a comfortable one. He was
practically the president of a divided
house. Frank Leach, to a great ex
tent, made Dr. Pardee in politics. He
took up the Don-partisan movement,
succeeded in electing Pardee, and the
two men are firm friends. Since the
announcement by Dr. Pardee of his
aspiration Mr. Leach has not shown
any particular fervor for his candi
date. Mr. Davis.
When Mr. Leach took charge of the
Mint ht? t<><.k his nan:-- from the head
of his paper, and his managing editor,
A. B. Nye, has since been in active
control. Mr. Leach has let it be
known that his new duties take most
of his time, and that his other private
interests made it impossible for him
to give the necessary attention to his
newspaper.
Thu promotion of the editor naturally
made an opportunity for some one else
to take his controlling Interest in the
Enquirer, and it was not long before
offers were in the field.
George B. Daniels a few weeks ago
showed a desire to secure a controlling
interest in the property. He made
known his ideas to the management,
but bo far no deal has been made. The
politicians are now guesslnp why Mr.
Daniels, who is a book seller, should
be desirous of having a controlling in
terest in a newspaper that had already
pledged itself to rapport Mr. Davis.
The knowing onÂ°s think they found an
easy solution. Georse B. Daniels is
perhaps the warmest, and stanchest
friend politically thsu Dr. Pardee has.
He has appeared in print as an advo
cate of the doctor and has never lost
an opportunity to further Pardee'a in
terests. It was at once declared that
Daniels has planned the great coup of
knocking the foundations from under
Mr. Davis' support in his own county
and adding a tower of strength to Par
dee's chances.
Dr. Pardee vigorously denied that he
was In any way connected with the
proposed deal, and said that if his
friends contemplated any such action
it was without his knowledge or sanc
tion.
Politicians outside of Alameda Coun
ty are busy calling attention to the
fact that the county across the bay has
already done pretty well in the mat
ter of Republican patronage, and hint
that her ambition to name the Gov
ernor is one step too far. The county
now has the Naval Office, Superintend
ent of the Mint, a United States Sen
ator, the Congressman from the Third
District and the patronage of the State
University, besides smaller plums, and
this argument is being used to down
its aspiration to have the Governor.
Leach seems to have graduated from
State into Federal politics, and is now
above the small plane occupied by Ala
meda County. He has been graduating
for twenty-five years, and all this time
he has been the firm friend and firm
supporter of the aspirations of Joseph
Mi-Kenna. The friendship of the two
began in Solano County years ago, and
has never wavered. He has also been
an ardent supporter of Senator Per
kins and with such substantial friend
ships Mr. Leach does not now want
to do wheel horse work in Alameda.
This is. of course, very disappointing
to the friends of W. R. Davis, who re
!i<-'l mostly upon Mr. Leach and his pa
per to land their candidate a winner.
The latest move to try and obtain the
support of the Enquirer is said to be a
syndicate which is contemplating its
purchase. This syndicate is supposed
to consist of friendp of Mr. Hilborn,
who is anxious to return to Congress-
Assessor Dalton, who wants to suc
ceed himself; County Clerk Jordan,
who is out for another term, and Dr.
Pardee. The principals, to a man,
strenuously deny they are undertaking
any such move or know anything
whatever of such an undertaking:.
A. B. Nye. managing editor of the
Enquirer, said to-night that an effort
had been made to purchase the paper,
but he did n<>t know what negotiations
were now pending. "So far as I know,"
he said, "Mr. Daniels was acting more
in the rapacity of a broker than in any
partioular interest. I think he first
wanted to see if the paper was for sale
and then try to find a purchaser for it.
So far as I know he did not make any
mention of wanting it to further the
interests of any particular candidate.
Of course when Mr. Leach went into
the Mint he had to cease his active
work <>n the Enquirer. .and this natur
ally made an opening for some one
else. I heard later that there was some
talk of a syndicate wanting to get thâ¢
paper, but I know nothing definite."
DINED WITH HIS
STAFF OFFICERS
Governor Budd Meets His
Military Family at a
Banquet
The Feast Spread in a Con
venient Suite of Rooms in
the Palace Hotel.
Official Reins May Be Handed to
Lieutenant-Governor Jeter for
a Time.
Governor Budd arrived In this city
last evening from Stockton and dined
with his staff at the Palace Hotel. The
banquet table was spread in a large
room of a suite just across the hall
from the Governor's apartments. Lieu
tenant-Governor Jeter was a guest at
the dinner.
This was the first dinner given by the
staff to the present commander-in-chief
of the military and naval forces of the
State, and was in all respects a sump
tuous function. John C. Kirkpatrick,
manager of the Palace Hotel, is now a
full-blown colonel on the staff of the
Governor and it is surmised that his
influence with the commissary depart
ment of the caravansary had something
to do with the excellence of the feast
and the exquisite state of the service.
It was the gossip among the younger
officers that Colonels I. Chadbourne,
Sanborn and Burgin never prepared
anything quite so elaborate when they
had the honor of directing the military
banquets.
Among the officers present were:
Brigadier-General A. W. Barrett, Adju
tant-General Colonel R. L. Peeler, Assis
tant Adjutant-General Colonel F. S.
Chadbourne, Colonel Frank McLaughlin,
! Colonel W. D. Sanborn. Colonel J. F.

Doolittle, Colonel H. Choynski. Colonel
W. K. Hopkins. Colonel Frank Vail,
Colonel J. S Young. Colonel H. P. Bush,
Colonel Dunn and Colonel A. G. Gassin.
Yesterday was the day appointed by
i the Governor for an interview with
| Judge Carroll Cook and Detective Still
well in the matter of S. D. Worden's pe
1 tition for executive clemency, but on
i account of sickness the Governor was
| not able to reach the city in time for
| the meeting at the hour named. The
! Governor has been in bed for several
: days and was only able to remain a
short time at the dinner last even
: Ing.
It Is not Improbable that he may call
upon Lieutenant-Governor Jeter to
take the official reins for a few days.
The Governor remarked last evening
that he had not yet considered the ap
plications for the vacant place on the
Hoard of Railroad Commissioners, and
that there had been no new develop
. ments In that direction. He was not
able to say last night when the ap
pointment would be made. He said:
"I expected to have two hours to con
sider some things this evening, but I
have been so besieged since my ar
rival here that I have not had time to
see the barber. I have not disposed
of the Worden petitions and I have not
had the opportunity to consider the ap
plications for appointment to the of
fice of Railroad Commissioner. In fact,
I am just out of bed and am not able
to do much. I may be obliged to call
in Mr. Jeter to help me out."

TESTIMONY
THAT BALKED
C. O. BROWN
An Overman Affi
davit the Public
Never Saw.
But Members of the Bay
Conference Knew
All About It
Direct and Specific Confession
of Guilt Supported
by Oath.
NO SIGN OF VAGUENESS.
Mrs. Tunnell Contributes a Sworn
Statement Showing Her Com
plicity In the Affair.
After a happy period of relief from
RCT. C. O. Brown that individual has
again become public. That he had !
"confessed" to the Bay Confernece; !
that his confession has been respect- j
fully received and he straightway
thrust from the fold was printed yes
terday. But a matter which once oc
cupied so much public attention, in
volved so much scandal, dragged so
many names in the mire and rent the
social fabric of a great church is not
destined to be dismissed the moment
a climax seems to have been reached.
There has been some wonder that
the Bay Conference was so little in
clined tube merciful; that Brown's pro
testations of innocence apparently fell
upon deaf ears. As a worldly observer
expressed it, the conference had some
thing up Its sleeve. That staid and dig
nified body acted as though certain of
Brown's guilt; it was. It has for a long
time been certain that he was much
more guilty than the "confession"
would have appear. In the possession
of one of its members has been a "con
fession" which went to the length of
confessing, and doing it with a partic
ularity stamping it as genuine. "With
this positive evidence of Brown's im
morality and details of his unministe
rial conduct, the members of the con
ference failed to be impressed by the
man's eloquence. The strongest testi
mony he could produce was of no ef
fect. The hearers to whom fell the duty
of weighing it knew it to be false.
There is no reasonable doubt that the
affidavit of the Overman woman, made
in Los Angeles, after she had professed
to be reclaimed from the ways of sin,
and forwarded to Chairman Rev. J. K.
McLean of Oakland, was the greatest
obstacle in the path of Brown. Each
member of the committee was made
familiar with the contents of the docu
ment at once. After this they all con
sidered that they were being guided
not by rumor but by fact. Yet the
document was withheld from the pub
lic, and while it has been seen by a few
outsiders will probably never become
c<. mnion property. This course of se
crecy was taken in opposition to the
judgment of Dr. McLean, the other
members denying him permission to
make it known and thus at once clear
up a matter c-f general concern. He has
often since expressed a regret that he
had not made the affidavit public and
consulted his associates later.
His view is now shared by others who
opposed him at that time, they feeling
that an earlier and definite exposure of
Brown would have been advantageous
to church weal, and have brought the
offender sooner out of a false position.
"When Mattle Overman sent the affi
davit to Dr. McLean she sent a Ions:
letter stating her motives. She said
she had been brought back to the lov
ing Savior, from whom in an hour of
weakness she had wandered; that she
believed in the scriptural injunction,
"to confess your sins and he is just and
able to forgive them." She had deter
mined to lay bare the truth, not spar
ing herself. Then followed the confes
sion, which is not of a Brown style of
vagueness. The substance of it can be
given in fewer words than the writer
employed. It set forth how she had
lived in the Brown household, and told
of the love that sprung up between her
and Brown. She made up her mind to
flee, but didn't flee. In the presence of
Brown she forgot all but his affection,
and in his absence was torn by re
morse. This continued until exposure
seemed certain, and then at Brown's
suggestion a room was secured where
they, by approaching from different di
rections, were enabled to meet without
fear of discovery. She affirmed that
such a condition arose that medical at
tention was sought to save her from
disgrace, and that the medicine was
procured by Brown.
The affidavit then tells of her escape
from the city, Brown paying the ex
penses. At Seattle she heard that he
Intended to abandon her. this making
her angry and having the effect of pre
cipitating the scandal. She alleges that
when she returned to face Brown he
told her what she must say at the trial,
and tried hard to get her to commit
perjury on specific points. She also de
clares that the Overman-Tunnell let
ters were genuine, this having been de
nied at the trial. Thus she makes out
a seemingly perfect case against
Brown; at least hershowing wasaccept
ed as final and has been the instru
ment of driving him from the pulpit.
There Is another affidavit in the
hands of this committee, and though it
is from Mrs. Tunnell, whose word many
would not regard as impressive, it
dovetails so perfectly with that of MiS3
Overman, while made when the two
were hundreds of miles apart, that the
pair are considered mutually confirm
atory. Mrs. Tunnell tells of having re
ceived money from Brown for her own
and Matties expanses while the young
woman was trying to get out of the
country. She tells of meeting Brown at
Stockton by telegraphic appointment,
and how he tried to induce her there
to sign a paper tending to vindicate
him. When he first saw her he said:
"For God's sake, don't recognize me."
After a conference at the # hotel he pro
posed to give her $400 for expenses, but
would not hand it to her. Instead, he
made her leave the room, and in her
absence put the money under a pillow,
where she found it. She also declares
that the famous Overman-Tunnell let
ters are genuine, and that wherever In
them reference was made to Brown he
was designated as "R," this being a
preconcerted plan.
Rev. George C. Adams, who succeed
ed Dr. Brown as pastor of the First
Congregational Church, was loth to dis
cuss the confession of his predecessor.
Since accepting the pastorate. Dr.
Adams has succeeded in uniting the
warring factions and to do this called
for the greatest tact on his part. Stren
uous efforts were made by both sides
to enlist his sympathies and support,
but the pastor steadfastly held to hla
purpose not to uphold either tha
"Browns' 'or "anti-Browns."
"When I arrived here," Bald Dr,
Adams, "I found a great breach exis=|"
ing between the members of the churcfc,
and I set about to bridge the chasm.
I realized that in order to do this it
would be necessary to take an abso
lutely neutral ground, and that I have
endeavored to do. I have refused to
discuss the Brown affair with anybody,
and even informed the Bay Conference
that I would not attend any meeting
at which Dr. Brown's case was to be
discussed. This resolution I have kept
to the letter.
"Were you aware, doctor, that Dr.
Brown had returned, to be present at
yesterday's meeting?"
"No; and I imagine that only a few
of his closest friends knew of his pres
ence. As I was leaving the Ministerial
Union yesterday Dr. Hatch asked me
to attend the conference in the after
noon. I was aware that Dr. Brown's
case was to come up for discussion, so
I refused. Dr. Hatch urged me to be
present, saying he was sure I would
be interested in the proceedings, but I
replied that I had promised the church
board not to attend any meetings
when the Brown matter was up for
discussion, and that 1 did not intend
to go back on my promise. I did not
think much about it at the time, but
I suppose now that Dr. Hatch knew
Brown was going before the confer
ence, but he was not at liberty to tell
me so.
"In regard to the confession of Dr.
Brown, of course I cannot say whether
he has told everything, but I am in
clined to believe he has. My reason
for thinking so is this: Some time ago
Dr. McLean showed me the last con
fession made by Miss Overman. This
was after she had gone to Los Angeles
and had become reconverted. This con
fession has never been made public,
and was known by only a few. Dr.
McLean presented it to a committee of
seven of tne conference, and an effort
was made to have the woman attest
it before a notary, but this she refused
to do, although she declared it was the
entire truth. This confession was ac
companied by a letter from the matron
of the home where Miss Overman was
staying, and expressed the writer's be
lief in the sincerity of the girl.
"I do not recall the exact reading of
this confession, but to the best of my
recollection it coincides with that made
by Dr. Brown, and for that reason I
am of the opinion that Dr. Brown tells
the truth."
Deacon Vasconcellos, however, still
pins his faith to the unfrocked parson.
He said yesterday that he believed tha
confession was a fake and that Brown
was not in the city.
"I saw one of Dr. Brown's most inti
mate friends Sunday," said the deacon,
"and he did not say anything about
the doctor being here, and he would
surely have known it and would have
told me were it true. I do not believe
Dr. Brown ever made such a confes
sion, but I am of the opinion it is a
fake, pure and simple. Moreover, I do
not believe the Bay Conference met
yesterday. I would certainly have heard
of it had such a meeting been called."

TRYING TO BREAK IN.
AT last the Examiner displays interest in the fight
of the Los Angeles people against the water
company. After The Call had opened battle in
behalf of the rights of citizens and had made a full
exposition of the plans of the corporation to set aside
the contract by which it has been governed, yellow
journalism awakened to the fact that something was
going on. Accordingly it prepared a set of questions
tor residents of Los Angeles to answer. These ques
tions had already been fully replied to in The Call.
Upon the answers received by it the yellow outfit is
sure to base one of two things. Either it will take the
side of the people and endeavor to shine as a re
former, or it will take the other side and make an
effort to get on the payroll where three papers of the
southern metropolis now find sustenance and would
like to find comfort.
As a reformer or as the agent of decency the Ex
aminer would be harmful to any object it might in
dorse. It could, by supporting the most just and
holy cause, throw about that cause the shadow of sus
picion. In its usual chara. :ir as the undisguised wolf
the Examiner is fully as much respected as when it
drapes itself in sheepskin and turns its customary
howl into a bogus baa. There is no reason to suppose
that there is a good purpose behind the present at
titude of that paper. Judged by its record, the Ex
aminer is trying to get into the watet war for no
other reason than to grace with its presence the pay
roll of the corporation as it once graced the Southern
Pacific payroll. We do not wish the water concern
any ill beyond that which it has properly earned, and
therefore feel it a duty to warn it that though the
Examiner be bought it is fickle. To purchase it is
deemed possible, but to receive an assurance that it
will stay bought is beyond the power of the most
liberal bidder.
CURRENCY REFORM PROSPECTS.
JOHNSON of Indiana, a
I â S member of the Banking and Currency Comfnit
â¢ * tee, is reported to have stated recently that the
Republicans on the committee would before long
submit a bill for currency reform, which he and they
were quite sanguine would be passed by the House
at this session.
The proposed bill will be drawn on lines similar
to those suggested by Secretary Gage. It will pro
vide â first, a reaffirmation of the present gold stand
ard; second, the retirement of the demand obligations
of the Government; third, the abandonment by the
treasury of the functions of a bank of issue; and
fourth, the substitution for retired demand obligations
of a circulating medium of bank notes to avoid a
contraction of the currency.
According to Mr. Johnson, it is assured that a
measure of the kind outlined will receive the support
of nearly every Republican in the House. Its pas
sage by that body is therefore feasible, and the only
question that confronts the advocates of the bill is
that of the expediency of bringing in at this session a
measure which apparently has little chance of passage
in the Senate.
Early in the session the probability of a currency
reform bill this winter was slight. It was known that
the Senate was hostile and it was believed the House
â was lukewarm. Every week, however, since the as
sembling of Congress has increased the confidence of
the advocates of immediate action. The antagonism
in the Senate is weakening, and the ardor of the
House is increasing. The sound money press of the
country, backed by the business sentiment of all sec
tions of the Union, has had its influence in both
branches of Congress, and in place of the vacillation
of a few weeks ago there is now a growing spirit of
resolution to bring the question to an issue at once.
There is, in fact, no good reason why there should
be any delay in presenting a currency reform bill and
pressing it to a vote. It is full time to let the people
know what Senators are opposed to legislation so
essential to all the industries and commercial interests
of the country. The House will render an important
service to the nation by passing a bill of the kind pro
posed even if the Senate rejects it. It will be worth
something to put the artful dodgers among the Sen
ators on record so that the public may know where
they stand.
The murderer of Actor Terriss in London was sent
to an asylum "at the pleasure of the Queen," which
means until he shall die out of his predicament. Now
the people of England are dissatisfied, deeming the
penalty too light and fearing that others by it will he
encouraged to commit crime. Sometimes Americans
find fault with the British, but the most radical critic
will never accuse the British of being maudlin.
Perhaps even Morgan's effrontery never arose
above its present pitch of maintaining that Cleveland
is in favor of annexation. The statement that Lin
coln issued the emancipation proclamation for the
purpose of perpetuating slavery would not be more
LOOK TO THE FUTURE.
r LUSHED with the success of the celebration of
Jubilee day by a street pageant the most splen
did in our annals and looking forward to new
triumphs in the Mining Fair, the people of San Fran
cisco are liable to become over sanguine of the con
tinuance of the prosperity that surrounds them and
neglect to take the steps necessary to assure it.
An evidence of the over sanguine tendency is found
in the report that the Alaskan trade committee is not
receiving the support from the public which the im
portance of its work justifies it in expecting. Con
tributions to the fund for advertising the advantages
of San Francisco as an outfitting point for Alaskan
miners are by no means what they should be. Our
merchants and manufacturers, it is said, are so well
satisfied with the way trade is coming now that they
feel no need of efforts to increase or maintain it.
It may be conceded that the Alaskan trade of the
season is encouraging. The demand for all kinds of
outfitting supplies is large, that for transportation is
about equal to the shipping facilities of our coast
ing fleet, and the work of constructing new vessels
is keeping busy all the shipyards around the bay.
Granting all these things, there remains the question
of the future. We have the bulk of the Alaskan trade
this season. Will we have it next year?
It is no longer doubtful that Alaska and the Yukon
district of British Columbia are about to receive an
extraordinary industrial and commercial development.
The Klondike strike has not been a mere pocket.
Every ship that comes down from the north brings
a new company of returning miners, new sacks of
gold nuggets, new stories of wealth and new proofs
of the wonderful richness of the placers. The ex
ploration of the widespread gold districts will be a
matter of years, and the business of the region will
involve millions of dollars taken into the country as
well as millions taken out.
It is a vast commerce and not a petty trade that
we must prepare for in Alaska. We must, therefore,
make preparations for the future as well as for the
present. We have done well this year. The Alaskan
committee traveling in the East and the opening of
the Mining Fair here added to the fame of San Fran
cisco as the metropolis of the Pacific Coast have won
for us the great bulk of this season's trade, but they
will not hold it for next year. The efforts thus far
put forth must be increased and multiplied instead
of diminished. This is no time to relax either vigi
lance or energy.
TWO COMICAL BOODLERS.
WE are not surprised that the Evening Bunko
should join the Mission street Boodler in its
loud demand for a weak and inefficient admin
istration of the criminal law in this city. The Even
ing Bunko is in the same fix as its morning com
patriot. Its proprietor and chief editor are up in one.
of the police courts for criminal libel, and it is now
naturally in favor of any plan by which they may be
enabled to slip through the meshes of the law.
The Evening Bunko, however, should be given the
credit of sincerity. Unlike its colaborer in the field
of pure and undefiled journalism it has never advo
cated a sharp and prompt administration of the crim
inal code. Anything in the shape of law has never
seemed satisfactory to the Bunko. All it has desired,
if one may judge from its general policy since the
spirit of the lamented Pickering departed from it, has
been to be let alone. Allowed to pursue the even
tenor of its course in bunkoing merchants out of ad
vertisements, it has never questioned the right of
every other bunkoer to follow its example. It is only
when its personal interests are concerned that the
Bunko becomes obstreperous.
Not so with the Mission street Boodler. That
sheet's policy is distinctively monopolistic. In the
courts it wants judgment for all except itself; in the
Legislature it opposes every bill except its own; in
politics all candidates are thieves and rascals save
those to whom it gives its support. In short, the
Boodler is a frightful example of selfishness in jour
nalism. Not only does it insist on maintaining its
privilege of extorting "advertising" contracts from
corporations, but it is determined that its mon
opoly shall not be interfered with by other boodlers.
To the credit of the Evening Bunko it must be said
that its policy is at least generous. It does not claim
an exclusive right to the bunko advertising busi
ness.
But, seriously, the attitude of these two sheets is
uproariously funny. If Dickens were alive he would
find in the solemn effrontery with which they are now
discussing police court prosecutions the material for
a living volume. We venture the assertion that the
annals of journalism furnish nothing so humorous as
the unanimity with which these libelers agree that the
employment of special counsel in criminal cases is
subversive of human liberty and calculated to under
mine the foundations of the republic. Such nerve
less things as they are rarely seen. To their affright
ed visions a jail seems to be a horrid specter. They
remind us of nothing so much as the African ostrich,
which is said to thrust its head into the sand and
imagine that its entire body is concealed. Do the
Mission street Boodler and the Evening Bunko think
for a moment that the public does not understand the
purpose of the honeyed words they are now address
ing to the Prosecuting Attorney of Judge Campbell's
court?
The question is, however, will that official let them
slip through the meshes of the law? We shall watch
the result with interest.
Farmer Brown, who won fame by being robbed of
$400 at San Jose, is to be congratulated. The rob
ber beat him nearly to death, but was caught and the
money recovered. Then the police who had chased
the miscreant, the doctor who sewed up the victim's
injuries, the landlady upon whose linen the Brown
gore had thoughtlessly permitted itself to be spilled,
all made such demands for recompense that there
seemed no particular advantage to the farmer in the
fact that the cash had been taken from the thief.
Now these people have become ashamed of them
selves and withdrawn the suits, which, save for the
lack of evidence, to the unbiased observer did not
seem to have much better moral standing than the
original theft. For a time it seemed likely that
Brown might be arrested as accessory to a disturb
ance.
Denver department stores have received a lesson
in business and manners. They demanded a 30 per
cent reduction in advertising rates, and pending a de
cision withdrew their patronage from the papers.
Then with one accord customers withdrew their
patronage from the stores, and the stores had to drop
the boycott, finding themselves to be at the muzzle
end of the weapon.
The water organettes of the Los Angeles monopoly
set m to wish the public to forget the exposure of their
crcoked methods. However, there are others who
will endeavor to prevent this consummation, though
the pipes of the organettes fairly burst with silence.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1898.
A VISIT FROM THE PRESIDENT.
WASHINGTON dispatches announce that
President McKiniey is making plans to visit
Yellowstone Park during the coming summer,
and if possible will extend his visit to this coast.
The reports are based on good authority, and while
the proposed visit will of course be dependent upon
the circumstances that will surround the President
after the adjournment of Congress, the prospects for
the accomplishment of the plan are at present con
sidered excellent.
It is well known that McKiniey has long desired
to make a trip through the West and see with his
own eyes this magnificent portion of the broad repub
lic he has so faithfully served and that has honored
him with its highest office. He had such a visit under
consideration last summer, but was compelled to
forego it. His new plans, therefore, are in line with
a long cherished wish, and unless something unfore
seen happens will be carried out.
Whatever San Francisco and California can do to
bring about the visit should be done. This is a jubilee
year with us, and we are in the mood to receive the
President with honors that will make his visit a fes
tival from the time he enters the State until he leaves
it. He will not see California at its best if he comes
in midsummer, but even at that season he will see how
much Better it is in climate, soil and products than
any other State in the Union, and with what patriotic
loyalty its people honor the chief magistrate of the
nation.
The announcement of the President's plan to come
West will of course be the signal for a thousand in
vitations to be sent him to visit States, cities and
towns along the route of his journey. It is right that
this should be so, and San Francisco should promptly
send her invitation along with the rest. It is a far
cry from Washington to this coast. We do not often
see a President. We have, therefore, the more rea
son for urging any one to come who shows any in
clination to do so.
In particular should we be cordial hi our invita
tion to McKinley. The champion of protection and
prosperity ought to see the State where prosperity i?
most abundant and his policy most completely justi
fied by results.
COOLIE COMPETITION IN REFINED
SUGARS.
SOME one asks why refined sugar does not come
from Hawaii, and it has been said that as our
beet sugars are refined, the raw sugar from the
islands does not compete.
The reason that Hawaiian sugar does not come
here refined is because it would then have to pay a
tariff of $39 per ton, while raw it comes in free.
It is a mistake, however, to say that because the
island sugar comes raw it docs not compete with our
beet product. The beet itself is the raw material of
beet sugar, and the island cane plantations, operated
with servile coolie labor, compete directly with the
beet farms of California operated by white labor at
white wages. The island output of sugar is about six
times as great as the beet sugar output of the whole
United States. This shows plainly that beet sugar
production is in its infancy and that its growth is re
tarded by the free entry into our market of six times
its volume of alien sugar grown by coolie labor.
But this is not all. If the islands are annexed their
refined sugars will also come into our market free,
and the cheap labor which now so disastrously com
petes in the production of raw sugar will then be
turned to competition in refined sugar also, and not
only our beet sugar farmers and their labor but our
beet sugar refiners anÂ«l their labor will feel the double
competition most disastrously.
Thousands of people are already employed in re
f ning in the beet sugar plants of this State, and thou
sands more in the fields which raise the beets. An
nex Hawaii and give her refined sugar the same free
entry to our markets now enjoyed by the raw sugar
and a shadow will fall upon every community now
brightened by the hopes invested in the sugar beets
of California and other States.
Do the beet farmers and the labor employed in re
fining beet sugar in Nebraska and lowa expect that
they can provide against the austerities of their
climate and furnish themselves with food and shelter
while competing in the profits and wages with Asiatic
coolies in tropical Hawaii? The demands of their
diet rirc alone greater than the requirements of the
Hawaiian coolie in food, clothing and housing. In
deed it is probably tri:e that a coolie in the islands
will feed himself fur a year for what our American
farmer or laborer in a sugar refinery has to spend for
school books for his children.
Mr. Holman, in a recent issue of the Pacific Rural
Press, speaks of the favorable effect upon 'community
life of the beet sugar industry wherever it has been
domesticated in California. The farmers have ad
vanced in agricultural skill and grown in thrift. The
whole community has been raised and its every ex
pression of comfort and refinement emphasized. Con
trast this with the effect upon community life in
Hawaii by increase in the sugar industry, where the
civilization and gentleness of the native race have
l.'cen displaced by the barbarism of Asiatic coolie
life and the community morality and refinement have
been overgrown.
If we take Hawaii we take all this into our system
to compete with the American foundation of the beet

The proposition is intolerable, and its calm con
sideration by our people means its crushing defeat
under the weight of public opinion.
This talk about our friendly relations with Spnin
tends to produce the justly celebrated tired feeling.
We have not the slightest reason for feeling
friendly toward that country, and the mere fact that
the United States is not fighting and not likely to
fight can hardly be construed into an evidence of
affection.
For some reason the New York Journal hastens to
disclaim responsibility for signed articles it prints
e-vpressing opinion. This act can only be accounted
for on the theory that the Journal thinks somebody
cares what its opinions, signed or unsigned, may be
on any topic under the sun; in truth a very peculiar
illusion.
Edison has had to make public announcement that
the various "interviews" with him in the yellow pa
pers are bogus. It could hardly have been otherwise.
People were slow to believe that the mind of the
great inventor was crossed by a broad, silly streak.
In the closing paragraph detailing by rounds the

a bit of information sufficient to cause a pang of re

Ihe Marshalls came to this country
from Germany in the early part of the
Piphteenth century, and were among
the first settlers of New Jersey. The
itruprgles and hardships of the pioneers
formed the school from which gradu

the mainstay of the conquerors of the

characteristic elements of leadership.

entered the patriot army and soon be
came one of "Washington's most trust
ed officers. During the war he several
times won praise and promotion for
bravery and devotion to the cause.
Another ancestor was John Hart, one
of the signers o# the Declaration of In
dependence. In succeeding generations
the Marshalls have been known for
their progressive and enterprising
spirit. Philip Marshall, the father of
the discoverer of gold, built the first
railroad in the United States. It ran
between Baltimore and Washington,
and was operated by horse-power. Be
fore its completion he died at his home
in Lambertsville. New Jersey.
â \VHiir\m Marshall was for many
years identified with the foremost en
terprises of Illinois, to which State he
emigrated when a young man. He was
one of the chief promoters of the Hen
nepin Canal and a prominent railroad
contractor. The late Dr. Larisson

Whom he marrted, why he married or

"Many happy returns of the day from

prenticed to a wheelwright. This pro
saic calling did not suit his restless
dispostion, so. after prudently and
faithfully learning all the details of the
art of making 1 wheels, he ran away
from his home in the quiet village on |
the Jersey Flats and was not heard
from by his family for many years.
William Marshall moved West with
the tide of emigration and settled in
Illinois near the present site of Rook j
Island. While there he received a let- |
ter from the wanderer, then in the
southern part of the State, saying he
was doing well and asking his friends
not to worry about him, as he was able
to take care of himself. He was next
heard from in Omaha, engaged in his
old trade of making wheels.
The American Fur Company was
then doing a flourishing business, and
Marshall closed up his business and
entered their employ. As their agent
he crossed the plains and mountains
and came to California. Of his career
on the coast it is not the purpose of
this article to treat.
About the year 1572, James W. Mar
shall returned to his boyhood home in
New Jersey. His eccentricities were
a constant source of distress to his
staid and sober-minded relatives. He
declared it would smother him to sleep
In the house, so he would take his
blankets and make his bed In the door

suaded to attend church, but as he was
asked to remove his hat he never re

When William Marshall was a rail
road contractor In Missouri he attend

was to discuss the subject, "Gold In

Bhirt, with trousers tucked in his boot
tops, was the chief speaker, and Wil
liam was astonished and delighted to
recognize his boyhood chum and rela
tive, James Wilson Marshall. A pleas
ant reunion was the result and the cou
sins spent several days together. No
amount of persuasion, however, could
induce the famous discoverer to fore
go the delights of a miner's life. For
him the luxuries of the East had no
charms equal to the fascination of "the
diggings." The happy-go-lucky life
he had so long enjoyed, with its ups
and downs, its times of privation and
festivals of lavish prodigality, had
wholly destroyed the steady, prudent
trnits, so carefully inculcated by his
early training, and he soon returned to
the life he loved among the glittering

Bre casting about to ascertain whether
pome reductions can be made in the
expense of the free delivery system
without detriment to the public serv
ice. Two years ago inspectors of the
department were sent to this city to
note the methods and manner of the
free dcliv ry system here, and they
filed a report, in which it was main
tained that the force of letter-carriers
could be diminishedâ that thirty car
riers in this city might be let out
without Injury to the service.
It does not appear that this report
recommending a reduction in the force
was sustained by facts or figures relat
ing to the expansion of the city. The
conclusion was doubtless the result of
careless observation, and obviously did
not produce much effect in Washing
ton, as no reduction followed the
recommendation.
The subject of a proposed reduction
in the letter-carrier force of large cities
has again been brought up. W. W.
Montague. Postmaster of San Fran
cisco, has been requested to submit his
views on the subject so far as the
contemplat- â¢â¢' reduction may apply to
this city. It Is known that Eugene F.
I,oud, chairman of the Congressional
Committee on Postoflice and Post
Roads, clearly understands the re
quirements of the office in this city,
an<l will not hesitate to properly use
his influence to maintain an efficient
delivery service here.
"When all the facts are presented to
Congress it will be shown that the
threatened deficit, which rigid economy
is now seeking to avoid, is not due to
increased expense in the maintenance
of the letter-carrier system, but is due
mainly to greatly diminished allow
ances for clerk hire and other neces
sary expenses. Figures obtained from
the report of the First Assistant Post

Postmaster-General further says:
The above table shows that but $200,000

ditional clerks, which amount Is but 36
per cent of the average ($555,031 01) for
the same purpose for the last four
years. It will be seen that our
predecessors had $K04.284 53 available
for increases in clerk hire in 1894-95. and
that I;ust year, with the smallest balance
for increases during their term, they had
$406,077 *>."). On June 30. 1595, the unex

appropriation) ami during the last four
years <.'<>r,grt-ss was so very liberal that
an average unexpended balance of $125,

By reason of the smailness of the pres
ent appropriation this administration has
been seriously crippled. Five hundred and
forty-six postmasters whose claims could
not lorger be denied were recently al
lowed temporary clerks for short periods,
and many other equally meritorious de
mands are still under consideration. Our
present unexpected balance is but $I!*,

employment of thirty-eight additional

r..Htmaster Montague has brought
the subject of the threatened reduc
tion to the attention of the Chamber
of Commerce and Board of Trade of
San Francisco and immediate steps
will be taken to advise the authorities
. : Washington of all the facts per
taining to the case. At present the
facilities accorded to San Francisco
are not equal to those given to New
York. Chicago and other cities east of
the Mississippi Valley. In the central
business districts of these Eastern
cities there are nine free deliveries
daily. In many other buslnesfc sec
tions there are six. seven and eight
deliveries daily. The highest number
a day in San Francisco is five. In
some business districts the number is
four. In some of the resident districts
there are three deliveries a day, but
the general rule is two. In the out
lying residence districts one delivery a
day is all that is accorded.
In order to place Snn Francisco on
an equality with Eastern cities in the
matter of postal accommodations the
force of letter carriers should be in
creased, so as to insure six, seven.
eight and nine deliveries every day in
the centers of greatest business ac
tivity. If reductions must take place
the beginning should be made In cities
having more than five deliveries daily.
The work of the San Francisco
Postofflce is constantly increasing.
The indications are that the increase
in the volume of business during the
next two years will be unusually
large. The growth of the city is keep
ing pace with the development of the
Pacific Coast region of country. The
postal facilities accorded to San Fran
cisco are now inadequate. Investiga

ties at Washington that an increase
rathor than a reduction of postal fa
cilities is demanded.

LOST WIFE AND MONEY.
Joseph Roderick, able seaman and descendant from a lons lino of
navigators, went ashore last November at this port for a rest on dry
land, and the experiment had so disastrous an ending that he pines
again for the salt sea and the oily odor of the steam whaler Jean
nette, of which stanch craft he was the third mate.
Roderick's experience warrants a paraphrase on an old saying, "A
sailor and his money are soon parted." He hails from the Cape Verde
Islands, and is an industrious and thrifty man. When he shivered
in the foretop of the Jeannette and shouted, "There she blows!" he little
thought that on dry land there were things far more dangerous than
right whales, or left whales, for the matter of that. Not knowing this,
and longing for rest and refreshment ashore, he landed with his bag
gage and 5690 saved from his share of the whale catch, and betook
himself to the society of a Portuguese family named Alvas, residing at
5 Green place. The name of the place was singularly appropriate for
Joseph, as subsequent events developed.
There were two girls in the Alvas family â one 16 and the other 21
years oldâ and Joseph fell In love with the younger and asked for her
hand. The mother vftiuld not consent, for the girl had not yet made
her debut In society, and was not even a bud. But the old lady sug
gested that the elder sister would make a better wife, she having had
more experience of the world. Joseph would rather have had the
younger one, for she was plump and pretty; but he concealed his dis
appointment as well as he could and married the elder. He paid for a
nice trousseau for his bride, a beautiful bridesmaid's dress for his
first love, and did not forget his mother-in-law in the presentation of
toggery that was alike the envy and the admiration of Green place.
Like a dutiful husband, he gave the remainder of his money to hla
wife, and she locked it in his trunk. All wont along well until about
two weeks ago, when his wife remained out all day and did not return
until dusk. She failed to satisfy her better half with such replies as she
gave to his inquiries, and after dinner she went out again and did not
return until late at night.
Joseph was angry, and the suspicions that he had entertained
were strengthened by his wife's apparent indifference. He made an
examination of his assets, and found that all his money, amounting to
$380, was missing. He thereupon took his trunk and other effects out
of the house of his mother-in-law and changed his residence. Last
Saturday he was up before Police Judge Low on a charge of disturbing
the peace, preferred by his wife. When the Judge heard the whaler's
melancholy story he dismissed the case, remarking that Joseph's wife
ought to be satisfied with getting his money.
Yesterday morning his wife swore to a complaint accusing him of
threats against her life. Roderick was arrested and taken to the Cali
fornia-street police station in a highly indignant state of mind. He
said that he had not been near his mother-in-law's house since he
moved away, and that he could not have threatened his wife's life and
she be aware of it.
This being the time of the year when the whaling fleet is prepar
ing to start for the frozen north, and as men are in demand, it is likely
that Roderick will leave the frigid atmosphere of his home and seek
the warmer welcome of the Arctic seas.
THE SAX FHAiS CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 2G, 1898.
RETURNING TO PORT.
A SEA LAWYER
MAKES TROUBLE
The Sailmaker on the
Anglesey Had to Be
Put in Irons.
H. M. Johnson a Prisoner on
the Coptic for Not Answer
ing Questions.
Lack of Hands and m Sick Cook Caused
the Putting Back of thÂ«
Rio Roy.
There was a lively scene In the
steerage of the steamer Coptic yester-
day. Immigration Commisioner Strad
ley and Interpreter Gaffney were ex-
amining passengers as to their rights
to land. Every steerage passenger
must have at least $50 In United
States gold coin or its equivalent be
fore he can get ashore and it is Mr.
Stradley's duty to find out if they
have the necessary coin.
Yesterday he met with a passenger
named H. M. Johnson, who rÂ» â¢
point blank to answer his questions.
Asked how much money he had with
him he told Gaffney to mind his own
business. Told that he must answer
the question before he would be al
lowed to land he answered: "Young
man, I didn't come to America to take
any of your blooming impudence."
Gaffney called Stradley and before the.
latter could ask a question Johnson
turned to him and said: "I say, mis
ter, how much money have you got in
your pockets?" The immigration offi
cer explained to him that he was
simply following the law in making
the inquiry and was not asking from
idle curiosity. Johnson, however. In
sisted that it was nothing but Ameri
can impudence and refused to give the
Information, saying that he was only
going to stay In San Francisco long
enough to procure transportation to
British Columbia. The attempt to
overcome his obstinacy was then
given up and the captain of the
steamer was instructed to hold him as
a prisoner until he was ready to give
the United States authorities the
necessary information. He will prob
ably relent some time to-day.
The British ship Anglesey came Into
port yesterday with Sailmaker Tyrone
in irons. The latter is a sea lawyer of
the first water and pave trouble dur
ing the entire voyage. When twenty
four hours out from Swansea he re
fused duty and abused the first officer
in the vilest kind of language. Cap
tain I^ewis had him put in irons and
fed on bread and water for a couple
of days when Tyrone begged to be put
back to work again. His request was
granted, but two or three weeks later
he went on another strike and so it
went on throughout the entire voyage.
,A few days before the vessel reached
port he refused to mend a sail and
threatened to head a mutiny, so ho
was again ironed and was kept In
durance vile until the ship dropped
anchor off Harrison-street wharf.
Half an hour after his release he de
serted the ship and Is now ashore
The Anglesey had a fair-weather
passage nearly all the way out, run
ning into only one terrific thunder and
lightning storm. On January 22 in
latitude 35:41 north, longitude 131
west, she spoke the American ship
Rotch, now 220 days out from New
York. On November 13 last the Rotch
put Into Talcahuano with her cargo
shifted and topsides strained. She
was repaired and sailed again a few
weeks later. M she must te making
very quick time in her nm up the
coast.
Tin; schooner J. II Ingalls; has been
sold to the Alaska-Yukon Transporta
tion Company for the Klondike trade
She will probably take 300 tons of
cargo from bert to St. Michael In the
spr'ng. As shf draws less thp.n six feet
of water loaded, an attempt will be
made to tow her up the river to Daw
son City. Should she not be able to
â d all the way up, she will be kept at
one of the stations on the river and will
be used as a stor*Â»ship.
Mike Mahr nearly lost his life while
crossing Third and Bryant streets yes
terday. He was knocked down by a
Bryant-Street electric car. and had to
be taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital for repairs. He was badly cut
about the face and scalp, and over v i
dozen stitches had to be taken in his
wounds before he could be sent to his
home.
The steam schooner Sunol was towed
in by the steam schooner Alcatraz last
night. While off Port Harford the
schooner broke her crank pin, but re
fused assistance from the steamer fianta
Rosa. Temporary repairs were made,
and a start wafl made for San Fran
cisco. The progress; was so slow, how
ever, that the captain was glad to ac
cept a tow from the Alcatraz when the
latter came along.
The schooner Rio Rey had to put
back to port yesterday. She left here
for Siuslaw River several days ago,
short-handed. Very heavy weather
was encountered from the start, and
after battling with a northwester for
twenty-four hours the cook was taken
sick. A man could not be spared to
take his place, so the captain thought it
was better to put back to San Fran
cisco. A cook and a full crew will be
shipped to-day, and another start will
be made for Sluslaw River.
In spite of the number of coal vessels
that have arrived within this last
couple of days, coal took a Jump yes
terday. The price of the Seattle and
P.ryant articles advanced $1 a ton, and
the chances are that there will be a
still further rise before the month is
out.
SIDEWALK ORDINANCE.
The Merchants' Association AsKs
for the Opinion of Its Mem
bers as to Its Practicability.
The ordinance- proposed by Supervisor
Devany to compel property-owners who
utilize the space under the public side
walks to. pay a quarterly license for the
same has stirred up quite a commotion
among not only the property-owners but
mercantile community on thlsquestion the
ascertain the extent of the feeling of the
mecantlle community on this question the
Merchants' Association sent out a cir
cular to Its members asking for an ex
pression of the'r views, the same to be
sÂ»ent to the secretary's office on or before
Monday. January 31, when the associa
tion meets.
The proposed ordinance Is summarized
as to rates as follows: Sv-iirways for
ascent or descent (into basement), $5;
stairways parallel with front (cut Into or
projecting over), $10 to $15, according to
measurement; storage space under side
walks (charge is based on space exca
:. cvon if not all used, no charge if
only to give light to basement or to re
ceive or deliver or ship goods, $10 to $TiO
according to measurement; steam boilers
under sidewalks (eai-ht, BO; signs on lan
terns, globes or transparencies (if the
same indicates any business), $3 to $5, ac
cording to size of lamp; signs or other
advertising device on polea over side
walk, $10; signs attached to or projecting
over sidewalk. $4; signs painted or in
serted in sidewalk within the fire limit*
$5; entrances, columns or other projec
tions, $- r >; show windows on first floor

Many persons canno: take

They cannot digest it.
It upsets the stomach.
Knowing these things, we j

50c. and $1.00, all druggists.
SCOTT & BOWNE, ChemUts, Ntw York.
Fcalo is proposed to be collected quar
terly.
The ground taken by Supervisor De
vany is that the sidewalks belong to the
public, and as such no man, merchant or
otherwise, has any title to their use. If
they insist on using them he claims the
city should derive a revenue for the
using of them.
In his argument he goes further and
Fays that this is a custom which has
grown up with the history of San Fran
cisco and which cannot be found in any
other large-sized city in the world.
The custom of using the sidewalks in
this city as storerooms and sale marts,
and, in fact, for almost any purpose that
the people may desire, he says, is not in
keeping with the requirements of a great
metropolitan commercial Â«ity, but is
rather a n-lic of some country village,
where the storekeepers place their plows
and other agricultural implements on the
side of the street in front of their stores.
Open hatchways and stirways leading
from the sidewalks into the cellars, he
asserts, should never be permitted In a
city like San Francisco. He admits that
elevators are a necessity for the recep
tion and delivery of goods in transit, but
thinks they should not be permitted to
remain open the entire day, to the dis
comfiture of the public, -which has prior
rights to every inch of space on the side
walks at all reasonable hours of the day.
The proposed license, if sustained by the
courts, will. Supervisor Devany irain
toins. do a great deal to correct a much
abused custom.

TO CURE NERVOuIIYSPEPsH
To Gain Flesh, to Sleep Well, to Know
What Appetite and Good Digestion
Mean, Make a Test of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Interesting Experience of an Indianapolis
Gentleman.
No trouble is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People having it think that their nerves
are to blame and are surprised that
they are not cured by nerve medicine
and spring remedies; the real seat of
the mischief is lost sight of; the stom-
ach is the organ to be looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the usual symptoms of
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspep-
sia shows itself not in the stomach so
much as in nearly every other organ;
in some cases the heart palpitates and
is irregular; in others the kidneys are
affected; in others the bowels are con-
stipated, with headaches; still others
are troubled with loss of flesh and ap-
petite, with accumulation of gas, sour
risings and heartburn.
Mr. A. W, Sharper of No. 61 Prospect
street, Indianapolis, Ind.. writes as fol-
lows: "A motive of pure gratitude
prompts mo to write these few lines
regarding the new and valuable medi-
cine, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I
have been a sufferer from nervous dys-
pepsia for the last four years; have
used various patent medicines and oth-
er remedies without any favorable re-
sult. They sometimes gave temporary
relief until tne effects of the medicine
wore off. I attributed this to my sed-
entary habits, being a bookkeeper with
little physical exercise, but I am glad
to state that the tablets have over-
come all these obstacles, for I have
gained In flesh, sleep better and am
better In every way. The above Is writ-
ten not for notoriety, but is based on
actual fact. Respectfully yours,
"A. W. SHARPER,
"61 Prospect street, Indianapolis. Ind."
It is safe to say that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets will cure any stomach
weakness or disease except cancer of
stomach. They cure sour stomach, gas,
loss of flesh and appetite, sleeplessness,
palpitation, heartburn, constipation
and headache.

NATIVE DAUGHTERS ENTERTAIN
THE FATHERS OF THE STATE.
THE city did not lose its holiday
appearance after the parade of
Monday. The second day of the
Golden Jubilee celebration
opened with the streets filled
with pleasure-seekers. During the fore
noon the street-car lines to the ocean
beach were crowded and most of the
visitors to- Pan Francisco spent the
morning at the Cliff House and at the
park.
In the afternoon the football game
was the attraction. It was between
teams from the T'nited States army and
the National Guard of California, and
it was played at Central Park. There
was some misunderstanding about the
time the ball was to I"' kicked off, and
the crowd did not put in an appearance
at the grounds until the ball was well
In the field. It was a hard-fought
game. Both teams were at thoir best
and every foot traveled by the ball
meant a hot scrimmage.
While the ball game was in progress
the parlors of the Native Daughters of
the Golden West of the city and Oak
land and Alameda were entertaining
the visitors to the city at the Native
Sons' Hall. The reception was the
feature of the day's programme in the
celebration. Thirteen parlors combined
to entertain the visitors and a right
royal welcome was tendered to all.
Great care had been taken in the deco
rations of the hall, and the large room

in their commemoration of a
great event. While many of us
went to California to mine, we
found that the wealth of Califor

erals. We found that in its soil
was -wealth. Its great s<>a coast
made it a great center. Its agri
cultural and horticultural inter
ests are known throughout the
world.
May California continue on its
great march of progress, and
while not attempting to make in
vidious comparisons with the rest
of the world I still insist that it
is the "garden of Eden."
Its climate is grand, its indus
tries large ami prosperous and
its public schools, colleges and
universities compare most fav

tutes of learning throughout the

thing to say to others that you

and the California Pioneers attended
in a body. The Calaveras band, with
its members in the rustic garb of the

WELL WISHES FROM
MARION DE VRIES.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 25.â T0
those whose industry, persever
ance and suffering have added
bo many millions to California's
greatness and the nation's
wealth the heart of every true
American must on this day re
spond with gratitude and pride.
More especially must this be true
with those whose nativity is
honored by California as a birth
place. As one of the latter I
extend my humble well wishes to
those patriots (the California min
ers) whose sacrifices and toils
have won for my native State
an honored name and deem it
a rare privilege to offer my ser
vices to their command. The
day of the Golden Jubilee should
be one of thanksgiving.

the banquet-room presented a very
pretty appearance when the guests had
been seated. The red shirts of the old
Veterans and the hoary-headed Pio
neers were vividly contrasted with the
pretty faces and light-gowned figures
of thoir young escorts. Evergreens
formed the basis of the decoration of
the room and every available spot had
been utilized on which to hang a sprig
of fern or flower, and through it all was
woven the bright yellow colors of the
Jubilee celebration.
During the evening vocal selections
â¢were given by Miss Lillie Wilson, Mrs
Kendall and Mr. Boyson. and a cornet
solo was given by Mr. TeazH, a young
Native Son of Dix<m. William T)'. Far

cited a poem that had been written for
the occasion. A long programme of
dances followed.
EXCITING FOOTBALL.
The National Guards Defeat the
Arrays at Central Park 5 to 4.
In the game of football yesterday at
Central Park between the Army and
National Guard teams the superior
brawn and muscle of the latter, com
bined with the poor judgment on the
part of the Army, gave the victory to
the Guards by the close score of 5 to 4.
The game was exceedingly clean and
free from slugging, and while both
teams exhibited a tendency to play
slow and take the time limit on all oc
casions, it was nevertheless exciting
and full of interest. The crowd was
small, but enthusiastic, and especially
so were the Wild West Indians, who
occupied seats on the eastern side of
the field.
From a critical point of view the
Army should have won, but after the
first ten minutes of play their team
work dropped off, and on several occa
sions Captain Carson used exceedingly
poor judgment in the running of the
team. Especially was this the case
when, with only half a minute to play
in the first half and the ball on the
thirty yard line. Captain Carson tried
the Guards' right end instead of a goal
from the field. A similar occasion
arose when th^ Guards had the ball.
Captain Thierkauf dropped back Car-

tor, and he made an easy goal from the
field.
Then again B. F. Seahright of the
Army was on the side lines instead of
being in the game, although he had
captained and trained the t-.itn and
had expected to play until a fÂ»\v min
utes before the game, when he was
superseded in command of the team
by Lieutenant Carson. Seabright was
Stanford's famous half in 1595, and has
one â â !" the best records ;ts a player on
thÂ«- coast. The Army team was greatly
weakened by his absence.

THE DELAYED FIREWORKS.
A Magnificent Pyrotechnic Display
in Castro rights.
Three hundred and fifty dollars 1
worth of fireworks went up in glitter
ing lights last night on the summit of
rastro Heights !n honor of the Miners'
Jubilee.
For a full hour the sky and sur
rounding hills were Illumined with a
maze of light and dazzling electrical
effects, which to an observer in the
distance could be mistaken for a vol
cano in full eruption belching forth
fire and smoke into the surrounding
gloom.
Promptly at 8 o'clock the two rocket
mortars placed on the side of the
Heights facing the city began to belch
and hurl their missil.-s heavenward.
The rockets from the mortars bursting
in the air descended to the earth in all
manner of grotesque and weird shapes,
some assuming the forms of different
animals and others presenting the ap
pearance of a mass of fiery serpents
descending in clusters to the earth.
The prevailing colors In the display
were white and gold, and the mortars
used in the tiring of the rockets were
so arranged that at a given signal
they could be fired simultaneously.
This was done for the purpose of send
ing them in a direct line into the air
that they might meet and descend in
a mingled mass of white, anil gold
lights. The resounding crash conse
quent upon the explosion of the rock
ets and -the prismatic^ effect caused by
the intermingling of 'colors was daz
zling in the extreme. The red fire, four
hundred pounds of. which was burned
on the hilltop facing the city, was par
ticularly effective, presenting the ap
pearance of an Immense bonfire. its
radiating gleam : pierced : the darkness
for a distance of half a mile and 11
lumlnated the entire heights and sur
rounding valley.
The display was conducted by A. W.
Gonzel. and was a success in every de
tail. A similar demonstration has been
proposed by Mr. (Jonzel for the illumin
ation of the <"ity Hall dome on next
Friday and Saturday nights, but as yet
he has received no answer to his pro
posal from the Jubilee headquarters.
His plan for the illumination of the
municipal building is more extensive
in its details than the exhibition on
< 'astro Heights last evening. His Idea

fire in the corridor directly beneath the
dome, twice this amount of the same
illuminating material on the next lower
elevation and a magnificent display of
fireworks In the third corridor.
A Wealth of Golden Hearts.
NEW YOItK, Jan. 25.â G. W. Schu-
Mann, who is one of the few oldf'alifor
nians in Now York, when seen by a
Call correspondent this afternoon said
he was greatly interested in news of
the Golden Jubilee celebration.
"I have a very warm corner in my
heart for California and her people,"
he said. "The developments and pop
ulation of the Golden State are to me
like a fairy tale. Matrniiicent cities
have sprung up where there were but
a short time ago only a few shanties.
There are stores of luxury and all mod
ern improvements on every hand. The
heroism of the old California's has
made room for a nobler sentiment of
generosity and charity. In which the
ladies excel. I have happy memories
of California. It is a State I love so
much and where to its mineral wealth
is added mines of golden hearts.
"My last visit to California was In
IK9O, and my sojourn in San Francisco,
fairest of all cities, was the pleasantest
in many years. I prefer San Francisco
to any of the world's big cities. There
is a particular happiness and content
ment to be found among the people
there, and a hospitality at all times not
to be found elsewhere."

TIMELY AND
FITTING TRIBUTE.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.â The
Golden Jubilee is a timely and
fitting tribute to the hardy and
intelligent pioneers who laid the
foundation of California's great
ness and the fiftieth anniversary
of the discovery of gold in Cali
fornia is a fitting occasion for
sui'h a celebration. That event
greatly promoted the settlement
and development of the great
empire of our country's terri
tory lying west of the Rocky
Mountains. California owes
much of its present greatness to
that event. Certainly more than
to any other single event in her
history. lam sure that the cele
bration will be entirely worthy
of the occasion and hope that its
success may surpass the expec
tations of its public-spirited pro
moters. I join most heartily in
the sentiment which has inspired
the Golden Jubilee and which
will, I am sure, carry It to a
glorious success.

Thief Lees 1 office looked like a tailor
Fhnp last evening. Samples of cloth.
trousers goods and remnants of gar
menta ordered by customers were
Btrewn about the desks and floor.
This all came about from a daring
burglary which had taken place, early
the previous evening in the large tailor
shop owned by Numair Bros.. ;it Oil
P< st Btreet, near Taylor. As has been
the custom tor years the brothers have
slept iii apartments in the rear of the
establishment, and heretofore there has
been no trouble from intruders.
On the night of the robbery, the pro
prietors stn>lk-d along Market street,
and after having dinner returned I
th^ir place of business. They were sur
prised to see the front door open, but
when they passed into the store their
surprise turned to grief, for they
missed several hundred dollars' worth
of suits which had been ordered, us
well as bolts of cloth and garments
which were nearly finished.
< Â»n looking through the estaolishment
they saw cloth strewn all Â»ver tfv
house, and the books in the office had
been hurriedly looked over, Bhowlng
that the burglars were conversant with
the running of affairs in connection
with the business.
The matter was reported to the Chief
of Police and samples of the stolen
property %vere taken to the office.
It has since been learned that many
small burglaries have taken place in
the neighborhood during the past few
days. The places which have been
robbed are surrounded by other i
of business, which makes the burg
laries even more daring. The police
are of the opinion that they will cap
ture the culprits within a few days.
All pawnshops are being vi.-ited and all
means will be tak>-n to cause the ar
â f the desperate characters.
( 'Th'-r matters have come to the at
tention of the police as well.
Small, h box maker, and
I^ni'-i Reardon, who gives his occupa
tion as a bartend' r, were arrested last
evening by Officers Graham and Sulli
van and charged with vagrancy at the !
f Sty Prison.
Small is known to the police as an
"old timer." He was arrested about a
year ago on Market street for having
acted in a suspicious manner, and af
terward charges were brought against
him for burglary. It Is thought that
there is an organized gang of pick
pockets, brass ring sellers and "sure
thing" men in the town, but all sus
piciuos characters will be promptly ar
rested.
When the prisoners were arrested
' they were operating on Bush street,
where many complaints have lately
been made, and it is supposed that
Small has been the main cause of the
trouble.
DUPED BY A
WILY SWINDLER
Easterners Promised Po-
sitions That Never
Materialized.
An Agent of a Mythical Com
pany Gained Their Ducats
and Enmity.
Bunko men have adopted the Klon-
V ke fever as a means of prosecuting
"rnf-ir nefarious calling. Dispatches
from the East tell of many instances
of people being swindled out of their
savings by the smooth-tongued, scoun
drels.
A dispatch from New York yesterday
told how Arthur ML DavlÃ, who claimed
to be acting as agent for the North
Pacific Trading and Transportation
Company of this city, had persuaded
half a dozen young men to surrender
good position* and k<> with him to St.
Michael as i mployea of his company.

fi<l<ls, Harry Jackson, Albert Bell, D.
F. Smith, Hurry O'Neill, Herbert En
gel, William Bonner, a. J. Vansauen
and John S. Lozier, residents of Hack
ensack, N. V.. accepted Davis' offer.
Two or three of the young men paid
over to Davis $150 each as a guarantee,
while the others paid smaller amounts.
Acting on the supposed agent's sugges
tion they supplied themselves with Arc-
U< outfits, from rubber boms to rlHes,
and which cost from $75 to SI-jO. Young
Vansauen, who wears glasses, laid in
a stock of six pairs at $3 each.
Everything was in readiness for the
start, and, after bidding good-by to
their families and friends, they jour
neyed to New York, and went to the
Pennsylvania depot, where they were
to meet Davis, who was to furnish
transportation. After waiting for an
hour and Davis not appearing, ih^
travelers became nervous, and began
tacing up and down the depot, glancing
cpectantly at every person that en
ired. The train which was to bear
them westward pulleu out, and male

more, and he then not appearing they

NARROW ESCAPE OF THE COPTIC.
Tons of Bullion Crashed Through the Forward Hatch.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company's Coptic which arrived from China via Japan and Hawaii
yesterday had a very narrow escape from going to the bottom â while in Shanghai harbor. As it was, a consid
erable quantity of the vessel's cargo was damaged ami one of the officers was so seriously injured that he had to
be left behind in a hospital.
The Coptic arrived in Shanghai on time and the work of discharging progressed rapidly. Kv. rything had
been cleared out of the lower hold save six tiers of flour, which were consigned to another port, and a large
quantity of bullion which was temporarily stacked on the forward hatch. While the -hip v. as being got ready
to proceed to Hongkong, Third Officer Atfaeaus and Storekeeper llorphy walked forward and took up their sta
tion on the hatch, one on one tii!-' of tin- bullion and one < n the other. Without a m< ment'a warning the hatch
: ray ami l.oth men and bullion were precipitated into th<- hold below. The f used a concus
sion that was felt all over the vessel, it cut through five of the tiers i I i\ing only one tier between it and
the hull of the ship. Had there been no Hour there to receive it, the bull >n would hi ye undoubtedly gone clear
through the hull and th â  Coptic would probably have gone to the bottom.
The third mate and storekeeper were quickly got on deck and attended to by th> ship's Burgeon. Atheaus
had his right thigh broken, his hip dislocated and h" was bruised and cut all body. His injuries w.-r..
found to be too serious for him to lie taken to sea, so he was landed and placed in th;- .Marine Hospital, where he
will be cared for until the Coptic returns to Shanghai. Storekeeper M orphy had his l- ft b . ted and was
also cut and badly bruised. He was, how ted on board the ad came to Han Franclsco>
On board the steamer very little stems to be known about the accident. Those of the officers who will speak of
the matter at all, lead the Inquirers to believe that the men met with the accident during the heavy weather that
encountered between Japan lulu.
This was not so, however, as th^ only disaster that occurred during that part of th.- run w.ts the loss of

A New York company of manufacturing chemists, the Rlpans Chemical Company. %
placed upon lie market about rive years ago a medicinal tablet or " taUule " composed 5
_ of compressed powdered preparations of certain medicinal drugs which had been mm m
â  t.,i .. .i to be of more geuerul use among medical men than any other, for the cure or nl- â¢*
I legation of such Ills common to man as have their origin in an Impaired digestion or W
* weak., capacity for agtfimllatlntr food, absorbing nourishment and eliminating waste. q
The catalogue of ills Included under this head Is said to Include pretty nearly every _,Â«
w disease for which the physician Is called upon to prescribe. In preparing their stÂ«n<!ard CJ
remedy for the acceptance of the American people the company laid down the principle . 1)
â  that everything fnuirim Into the packet should be of thÂ« highest grade, and so prepared V
W and protected as to retain Its qualities Intact and unimpaired through any extended *
k lapse .if time in any climate. Only the choicest drugs should be used, their preparation _â  .
A should be.li accordance with the latest perfected methods of modern science, thetabules r
j packed In glass, protected by absorbent cotton, and securely corked. Even the corks >
U used have been of a grade so high In Its requirements that no manufacturer of these \
everv-day stoppers could supply more than a small proportion from his output that . â
m wiml.l meet the exacting specifications. The glass vials ware In turn packed In boxes of X
a quality not surpassed In beauty and perfection of workmanship by thoe used ty the f'
i most fastidious dealers In Jewels and ornaments of gold. Having t-et vhelr high standard, (
I and neverconsentlnKto vary from It, the proprietors resorted to the accepted modern B
H methods of making their commodity known, and seven hundred thousand dollars in- 1;
1 vested within live years In newspaper advertising has Informed every American citizen *
D concerning the superior and surprising qualities of Rlpans Tnbules. I
Being thoughtful and painstaking observers of the changed conditions that sweep a"
U over the commercial world, and careful to note every circumstance having a bearing Â»
â  upon the sucsessfut prosecution of their trade, the managers of the company have noted WL
:> A that there, is a present Insistent demand for a lower price for every article that 1>
â¢2 reaches or approaches an unlvt.rvai use, and that the people, althoush requiring the' C
B best of everything, resent being called upon to pay heavy percentages for superfluous \
wrapping and packing or unnwssory protection against deterioration that might re- Â«
m suit in rears, but Is needless la the case of a purchase Intended to be consumed In a m
â  week, it has aliÂ»o been discovered, and proved by the test of time and actual experience, WL
B that th">sc> Tabules do not have the tendency to loss of qualities or diminution of ex- M
V oellenee from exposure that might at flirt have been expected. Inasmuch as, under â¢
favorable conditions, those that have lain loose In a drawer, a traveling bag or pocket _9

DEATH CLAIMS
ALEX. BADLAM
Had Been in Poor Health
Lately and Died at
Midnight.
The Deceased Was One of the
Earliest of the California
Pioneers.
For Many Years He Was Promi
nent in Business and Politi
cal Circles.
Alexander Badlam, the well-known
Insurance and railroad man, died at
his home, 1024 Franklin street, shortly
after midnight last night. He has been
ailing for some time, and his death was
not unexpected.
Mr Badlam comes of an old family,
which dates back to before the Colo
nial days, both his parents having been
New Englanders.
In 1850, when Alexander was 15 years
of ape, his father returned from Cali
fornia for his family, and they, joining
an emigrant train, like thousands of
others in those perilous days, started
for California.
In Sacramento in IS.">7 Mr. Badlam
associated himself with Charles L.
Farrington, Frank "Webster, John Ben
son and Nat Ford and organized what
v. as then well known as the Alta Ex
press Company. Considering that the
party had but little capital to begin
with, ami that they sold out their busi
ness at the end of a year for $30,000. it
is apparent that the tact and gagacity
Of young Badlam manifested itself on
more than one occasion.
In 1863 he was nominated for the
Legislature on the Republican ticket,
and ran against ex-Governor John Big
ler, beating his opponent almost two to
one at the election. It was while serv
ing the people in the capacity of a leg
islator he first attracted public notice.
The prominence achieved in that gath
ering Boon secured for him more than
an ordinary degree of recognition. He
th<?i came to San Francisco, where he
liv. (1 up to the time of his death.
In 1869 he was elected a member of
th>- Hoard of Supervisors by an almost
unanimous vote. In that body he per
sistently and judiciously fought every
ring and corrupt measure proposed.
This gained for him the approbation of
the people, and in 1875 the Supervisors
elected Mr. Badlam Assessor. It was
in that capacity thf.t he gave the best
evidence in the world of his ability to
hay.' everything reduced to a perfect
systematic order.
In the fall of 1575 he was re-elected
by the people!, receiving a majority of
6000 votes over his adversary. At that
election the Democratic candidate for
Governor, Mr. Irwin, was elected by
the same majority, and almost the en
tire State and county Democratic
ticket went into office at the time.
Mr. Badlam was married in 1861 to
Miss Mary Burgess of Sacramento,
and was the father of three children,
the oldest being a youncr man now en
gaged in insurance business, and a
younger son who has achieved a world
wide reputation as a mechanical engi
neer and inventor. His daughter
Maude is an exceedingly accomplished
lady of society, with a phenomenal
range as a vocalist and a fine pianist.
For the past six years Mr. Badlam was
president of one of the most successful
insurance companies in California, and
was interested In railroad building and
many other enterprises.

restore the strength of the nerves and the tone of the parts, and nature
will do the rest.- Nature has no better ally than this Compound, made of
her own healing and restoring herbs. *
Write freely and fully to Mrs. Pinkham. Her address is Lynn, Mass. She
will tell you, free of charge, the cause of your trouble and what course to take.
Believe me, under right conditions, you have a fair chance to become the joy-
ful mother of children. The woman whose letter is here published certainly
thinks so:
" I am more than proud of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and
cannot find words to express the good it has done me. I was troubled very
badly with the leucorrhoea and severe womb pains. From the time I wag
married, in 1832, until last year, I was under the doctor's care. We had no
children. I have had nearly every doctor in Jersey City, and have been to Belvin
Hospital, but all to no avail. I saw Mrs. Pinkham's advertisement in the
paper, and have used five bottles of her medicine. It has done more for me
than all the doctors I ever had. It has stopped my pains and has brought me
a fine little girl. I have been well ever since my baby was born. I heartily
recommend Mrs. Pinkham's medicine to all women suffering from sterility. â

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 25.â The timidity mani
fested by dealers In stocks yesterday be
â¢cause the. warship Maine ha.l been or- f
dered to Cuba was fully equaled by.
the confidence with which traders nought
back their ' stocks to-day when the ship
had arrived in Havana. The most notable
feature of the day's trading was In the . large
volume of transactions fpr London^ account.
.The number of shares bought. In New .York
for London was estimated at fr0m. 30.000 to
40.000 shares. Even with this large demand to
be filled, prices -were not lifted at open
ing fully to the London parity. The sharp de
cline seemed to have awakened a demand in
London for Americans and early quotations
from there showed yesterday's declines here
largely recovered. The strength of the Span
ish fours in London also Indicated the absence
of apprehension of an embroilment between the
United States and Spain. London gave the
tone to the day's market and sustained It by
the 'absorption of free offerings of securities
after the opening. The foreign buying of se
purities was sufficiently heavy to have a
. marked effect on the exchange market, the
actual rates declining with the demand for
bills very light. London's large buying, of se
curities in fact leii to renewed talk of early
imports of gold, and this talk is given addi
tional force by the showing of merchandise
exports from N'.-w York for the week, which'
.were over J1. 200, 000 in excess of last week and
over $3,000,000 greater than those In the clos
ing wreCk of last year. It was evident that
some, of the professional traders who put out
â¢short contracts In yesterday's Cuban scare re
turned from covering in the early transactions
In the belief that the market would become
easy after London had ceased operation. The
belated shorts nished to caver in the final
transactions and made the tone buoyant at the
c!"se, which found price* at the best for the
day for the standard stocks. Y<*terday"H
losses on the average have been more than re
covered. New Ye-). Centra] was most con
rÂ«plcuoup- iii the dealings, with its net gain of
over 3 j-oints, and the stocks of allied proper
ties shared In the strength to a somewhat Jen
extent. I'nlon Pacific, the Northern Pacific
and i he other properties which go to make up
the Klondike group were all conspicuous for
strength and the Grangers and Suuthwesterns
may be added to the list. The local transit
end gas stocks moved in a somewhat erratic
manner under palpable manipulation, all show
ing gains except Third avenue, which reacted
â harply.
The bond market showed increased activity
and strength as the day progressed and showed
pains as a rule. Total sales, J3.fi00.000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â The opening In wheat
was weak. May, which closed yesterday at
S3vac. started to-day at 93't,!&93^4c, and crÂ«jÂ»
paratlvely little trading was done, even at
those prices. The weakness was due both to
ff. reign and domestic news. The Liverpool ca
bles were but higher at the opening, Â£nd
this slight advance was soon lost. There waa
no confirmation of the sensational reports of
yesterday afternoon regarding the Austrian de
mand for Argentine wheat, or of the Russian
Importation of German grain, and news from
Havana was very pacific. Heavy snows were
reported all over the winter wheat Country.
Minneapolis and Duluth received 523 car loads.
against 250 the corresponding day of last w. â¢ k.
and 125 the similar day of the previous year.
Chicago got 85 cars, against 4j a yÂ«\-ir ago.
Primary market receipts In the West were
316,000 bushels, against 327,000 bushels a year
ago. The Atlantic port exports were very lib
eral, being equal In wheat and flour to 53t,000
bushels. That Includes a considerable quanti
ty from Newport News. About 40 minutes after
the opening, the pit was set in commotion,
January being the center of Interest. That de
livery was nominally worth Me at yesterday's
close, and wan offered at SÂ»4*Â»'" at to-day's
opening. About 10:15, however, brokers for
Lelter began bidding for January, and the
price was ad\anced so far that for a few min
utes it appeared to be fairly running away.
From 9j"Â»c it Jumr>ed half a cent at a time,
brokers raising their bids that much until Jl
was hid. Then the reaction tame, the price
dropped almost as quickly as it advanced. It
brought up at 97c, and for the rest of the ses
sion was comparatively quiet. The gyrations
of January were generally believed to be due
to a clever move on the part of the I
crowd, who it Is thought touk this method to
advance the price of May. This belief was
strengthened by the unloading which took place
In the latter optkM nt Me, to Which price It
was carried while the pyrotechnics were going
on In January. Alien nnl GrW were said to
have taken 10,000 bushel* of January in get
ting the price to a dollar. For the rest of the
morning prices were nn \ illlt. though no great
trading was done. Bradetr** t's visible report
showed a decrease of but 780.000 bushels, and
was a disappointment, and was a factor In the
decline to 93 H, which took place after the
bulge to 94c. Late in the srsslnn. however, re
ports that Italy's bread rids were increasing
and the military had been called oat, started
some brief buying and May waa adwneed to

DRIED FRVIT MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 25.â The Journal of Com
merce says: In the dried fruit market the po
sition of Grecian currants seems to be one of
the chief features of interest. In spite of the
higher duty, statistics seem to show that there
has been little decrease in Imports, as com
par<d with last year. The effect of a higher
tariff, however, has been to Increase the spot
market values, and higher prices here have
apparently Induced holders on the other rtda
to turn their attention to this market, as. In
Fplto ( ,f the Increased prices, goods still seem
to be wanted by American consumers, who do
not seem to find In California fruit that is
offered as a substitute for Greek currants the
flavor for which the foreign article has long
been esteemed by the consuming pub!!
the other hand small seedless raisins of Cali
fornia have. It Is reported, been selling more
freely during the past season than ever before.
although importers are dlsposea to attribute
this to the growth of consumption of dried
fruits as a whole rather than to the substitu
tion of the California product for the Cir^k
fruit. Latest advices from Greece by mall In
dicate that the stock there Is larger hr Sivn
tuns than was st.it hO by recent cables, hut
whether this Includes some of the stock h- !d
back under the retention law. or represents
the quantity available for lmmedlatp delivery,
we have no Information. In any event, the
situation In all markets seems to depend upon
whst further shipments or offers may be made
from primary sources. At present the *pr>t
market is steady, with under small and uvll
concentrated supplies.

DOUBTLESS A NEW WOMAN.
Some time ago a young married wom
an in one of the principal towns of
Lincashire made a curious blunder.
She put some eggs on to boll for her
husband's dinnor tOVO after breakfast
one morning. They were still on when
he came home at dinner-time. Upon
her husband asking what was in the
saucepan, she answered:
"Eggs for your dinner. They have
been on since soon after breakfast. I
have tried them with a fork, and they
are not boiled soft yet!"
His astonishment may be better Im
agined than described.
THE VERY SWORD.
A Scotsman on a recent visit to Dub
lin went to see a private museum
which was advertised to contain the
oldest and queerest antiquities in the
world.
The Irish showman brought out a
larpe sword and said:
"This is the sword that Balaam slew
his ass with."
The Scotsman, being well up on Bi
ble history, here interrupted and said:
"T'.nifiam did not s!;iy his ass: he only
wished for a Sword to slay it."
"Oh!" returned P'.it. 'th^n this is the
very sword he wished for."

WITH POISON
Mrs. Mary Alberti of San
Rafael Drinks Car
bolic Acid.
The Fatal Draught Bought for
the Woman by One of
Her Children.
HÂ«tJ Grieved Over the Alleged Circu
lation of Slanderous Tales
About Her.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 25.â Mrs. Mary
Alberti, wife of Joseph Alberti, pro
prietor of the William Tell House on B
street, committed suicide this after
noon by swallowing over an ounce of
carbolic acid. This was the fourth time
that Mrs. Alberti has attempted sui
cide, according to the statement made
by her husband shortly after the body
was taken to the Morgue. Once Al
berti found her with her mouth full of
strychnine, which he compelled her to
vomit, and again he broke Into a bath
room, when she made an attempt to
drown herself in the tub.
Mrs. Alberti was about 37 years of
age, the mother of three children and
a native of Ireland. At noon to-day
she appeared to be in her usual spirits,
and sent her eldest daughter, 8 years
of age, to P. S. Malone's San Rafael
pharmacy with a bottle to have it
filled with carbolic acid. At the store
the child said that her mother wanted
the bottle filled with carbolic acid, to
be used for a wash, and that she want
ed the strongest they had.
After the children had been sent to
school Mrs. Alberti, in the presence of
one of the boarders, drank the poison,
and soon afterward her husband's at
tention was attracted by her moans
of distress.
He went into her room, and when she
saw him she told him to go away â that
she wished to die in peace. Alberti
sent for a doctor, and when he arrived
she was dead.
Albertl said that last night his wife
seemed sad and wept. She said that a
woman had been telling: slanderous
stories about her and that she wanted :
her husband to have the woman ar
rested, but he told her that if she
wanted her arrested she should have It â 
done herself. This morning she cried :
again, and was evidently distressed.
Later, however, she became cheerful,
and about 2 o'clock took the poison.
Her remains are at the Morgue.
ROBBED A LADY FRIEND.
George Wilson. a Racetrack
">3ut." Has Slipped to
New Orleans.
For a week Detectives Eg-an and T.
B. Gibson have been searching for
George Wilson, ji race track "tout." who
Is wanted on a chargre of grand larceny.
They learned yesterday that Wlison had
pone to New Orleans and the search has
been abandoned.
Wilson was introduced to Mrs. Alice
Hall, 13tS Oak street, by a lady friend and
had been in tlio habit of calling at' her
house. Last Wednesday, during her nb
penee, he got Into the house by means
of a false key and stole her diamond
earrings, her gold watch and chain and
her husband's gold watch, the whole be
ing valued at 1375. Wilson pawned the
earrings and Mrs. Hall's watch and
chain at Wagner's loan office and
skipped to New Orleans.
Trie articles were recovered from Wag
ner by the detectives and yesterday
Judge Conlan made ;ui order giving Mrs
Hall i'ossession of them
POWERS OF
SUPERVISORS
They Will Be Limited Under
the Proposed Char
ter.
The Railroad Franchises Will Even
tually Kevert to the Munici
pality.
The Freeholders last night continued
the work of outlining the powers to be
vested In the Board of Supervisors to
be elected under the provisions of the
charter now being framed.
T'nder the provisions of the proposed
new law the Supervisors will be re
quired to meet in the month of Feb
ruary of each year to fix the rates to
be charged by corporations furnishing
water, heat, light, power and telephonic
and telegraphic service to the city and
county and the inhabitants.
The Supervisors will also be author
ized to provide in the annual tax levy
for a special fund to bo used in the
construction of a general system of
drainage and sewerage; to fix the
hours of service to be required of la
borers in the employ of the city, pro
vided, however, that eight hours shall
be the maximum hours of labor in any
calendar duy, and the wages not less
than $2 a day; to open, close, straighten
or widen any street, road or highway
and to regulate all streets, railroad
tracks and cars; to fix, establish and
n.-duce the fares and charges for
transporting passengers and goods and
to compel the railroad companies to
pave and keep the streets in repair be
tween their tracks and for at least two
feet outside the rails.
A lengthy discussion then followed
as to the fixing of the distance on
which different car linos may use the
same track. With tho view of giving
a chance, the cross-town lines that can
now only reach the water front by
horse cars from the terminus of their
cable roads, it was decided to make the
distance ten blocks.
The granting of additional franchises
to street car railroads was next taken
up for consideration.
T.ippman Sachs thought the franch
ises should be for a term of fifty years,
and that the companies should be
compelled to pay 1 per centum of the
gross receipts into the treasury every
year.
P. H. McCarthy, Alfred Cridge and
H. N. Clement argued against grant
ing such long franchises, and it was
finally decided to empower the Super
visors to grant railroad privileges not
to exceed twenty-five years, and at
the expiration of that time the tracks
and roadbeds are to revert to the city.
The Supervisors will be then allowed
to lease the lines to the highest bidder.
It was also decided to empower the
hoard to grant water front privileges
to any transcontinental or other road
desirous of entering the city that has
not less than fifty miles of road con
â¢tructed and in operation.
TWO KIDS WHO STARTED FOR THE KLONDIKE BUT DIDN'T GET THERE.
INFANTILE
KLONDICITIS
Two Youngsters Are At
tacked With the New-
Disease.
They Disappear and for Hours
a Searching Party Looks
in Vain.
At I_ast They Are Found With a
Somewhat Incomplete
Outfit.
Tt Is a well known fact that the
Klondike fever, has spread to an alarm
ing extent among adults, but not until
lately was It known that it had become
a Juvenile affliction, and the proud dis
tinction of having first contracted
this insidious disease in youthful cir
cles belongs to two heroes by name
James Ooleman Brazel, aged 10 years,
and Mursell Hinton, who has reached
the more advanced age of 11.
The latter it was who, on account of
the larger experience of his years, con
cocted the scheme to go to the Klon
dike to seek fortunes new, but happily
for them their little plan miscarried,
their plot was nipped in the bud, they
were discovered and now they are for
tunate to be in the bosom of their re
spective families.
Mursells father is the good-natured
and Jovial William M. Hinton Jr. (sur
named "Tiny," a misnomer in his
case, for he is far from Bmall), who
says that the first intimation he and
the mother of their boy had of his de
parture was when a note was found
under the front door of the family res
idence at 1610 Grove street about 8
o'clock one evening last week. The
note was brief and to the point, and
was evidently intended to ease the
minds of the parents should they be
come distracted. It was in printed
characters on a piece of yellow paper
and read: "Notice â We are all right.
We will be home in the morning.
"J. C. B. and M. H."
The initials stand for the names of
the two lads. Wondering what It all
meant the father immediately set out
with two volunteers to find the ad
venturous youths. By this time the
news <if the disappearance had spread
through the neighborhood, and the im
provised searching party was soon
Joined by others. They surmised that
the boys might be lost in the sand
dunes and scrub oak on a piece of land
known as the Treadwell estate, on
Hayes street, near Masonic avenue,
and accordingly every inch of that
ground was thoroughly gone over,
but after experiencing considerable
discomfort by reason of scraped shins
and lacerated hands the quest was
given up as futile at 12 o'clock and the
party returned home in despair.
It was then that the where
abouts of the lads was discovered, and
on the information of some neighbors
they were found peacefully sleeping
under the stops of the residence next
door to the Hintons. For company
they had thÂ« gas meters which are
generally kept in such places parti
tioned off below the stairs, and both
boys were probably dreaming of their
intended journey.
When they were awakened the elder
one, as spokesman of the precious duo,
said that it was their intention to go
to Klondike in the morning right after
they had breakfasted. He then
brought to light their "outfit." which
consisted of a bed quilt, a pillow case
stuffed with odds and ends of discard
ed clothing, a tin bucket, a pie plate
and for food a small bag of potatoes, a
half-dozen eggs and a handful of cof
fee. They intended to have an early
repast and then "ho for Klondike."

THE SAN IRAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1898.
POPTLISIS
ARE SAVED
The Party in Alameda
Gets More Than It
Earned.
The State Vote Gives Them a
Place on Election
Boards.
Supervisors Will Name Some of the
Party for Officer* of
Election.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 25.
The Populists were somewhat alarm
ed to-day that they would not have
any representation on the list of elec
tion officers. As a matter of fact the
Populist party in this county did not
earn representation in Alameda, but ac
cording to District Attorney Snook
they were saved by the loyalty of their
fellow political followers in other parts
of the State.
This afternoon the Supervisors Bat
as a Board of Election Commissioners
under the Stratum primary law. Coun
ty Clerk Jordan had been ordered to
report on the standing of the various
parties in this county, as shown by
the vote of 1896. His report was brief
and was as follows:
The highest vote cast for the candidates
of the several political organizations rep
resented on the ticket voted at the last
general election was reported by the
County Clerk as follows:
For Duncan E. McKir.ley, Republican
candidate for Presidential Elector, 13,429
votes.
For J. W. Martin, Democratic candidate
for Presidential Elector, 5202 votes.
For William Kelly, Nationalist. 55 votes.
For J. V. Webster, People's party can
didate for Presidential Elector. 135 votes.
For Emll L,eiss. Socialist Labor candi
date for Presidential Elector, 101 votes.
For James K. O'Brien. National Demo
cratic candidate for Presidential Elector,
127 votes.
That the aggregate votes cast, taking
the highest vote cast by each party for
a certain candidate was 22,241 votes.
And that 3 per cent cast in Alameda
County would bo 667 votes: and that the
parties for whose candidates 3 per cent
of xhr total vote caÂ«t was given are the
Democratic and Republican parties.
Supervisor Roeth wanted to know
whether Mr. Jordan had used the State
or county figures, claiming that the
State basis was the proper one.
The County Clerk said hie duties
were confined to the county and that
the question was one for thf District
Attorney to determine, and it was re
ferred to that official.
It was found that the total vote for
Presidential electors in this State was
312,215. Of this number the Populists
cast 21.734. As 3 per cent of the State
vote would be 9366, the Populists be
lieved they should be represented.
District Attorney Snook reported
Inter that in his opinion the State vote
sh<>u!d govern the action of the Super
visors, and the Populists be riven
representation. His decision will be
acted upon by the board.

LEES' REVENGE
ON CAMPBELL
An Incident of the Jubilee
Parade That Escaped
Notice.
The Judge Disobeyed Instruc
tions Regarding the Right
of Way.
Tha Chief Says That the Jurist Has
Apologized for His
Action.
The smoldering fires that have been
burning In the hearts of Chief of Police
Lees and Police Judge Campbell for
some time past have broken out afresh
and all because of a little question of
authority.
It all happened during the Jubilee
parade. Fired with patriotism and en
thusiasm, Judge Campbell decided to
take a prominent part in the proces
sion and hired an elegant rig with a
driver to handle it, in which he en
sconsed himself, his wife and his
whiskers.
Captain Lees, at the head of the pro
cession that was passing up the
thoroughfare, saw the Judge's vehicle
coming down the line and threatening
to throw the procession into commo
tion. 11155 face grew black.
When the Judge reached a point op
posite the captain he was ordered In
no uncertain tones to turn baok, but
the Judge was bound for a place in the
line, and heeded not the beh>st.
"Go ahead, driver," he said to his
jehu, and the driver proceeded to do
so. Once more the captain called a
halt, adding that Judge Campbell was
no more entitled to break up the pro
cession than any other citizen.
Still the Judge's#arriage Lore proud
ly down upon the line and it became a
question of authority between the two
officials. Chief Lees took one glance at
the determined face of the Jurist and
then motioned to two of his mounted
patrolmen who were striving to keep
back the surging crowds.
"Lead that carriage out of the line
of march," he ordered, and before the
astonished Judge could protest a po
liceman was on either side of his span
and the carriage was being hurried
toward Fifth street.
The policemen broke a way through
the waiting throng and Just as the
first division reached Fifth street Judge
Campbell found himself alone in his
glory and gazing at the backs of the
crowd.
Of course Captain Lees would scorn
a suggestion that he was Retting re
venge on the Judge because the lat
ter dismissed a number of cases of

the fact remains that when the oppor

Captain Lees was inclined to make
light of the matter when rpoken to
about it last evening and affected to
believe that Judge Campbell was not
hurt by the incident.

HOME FROM
THE ORIENT
Admiral McNair Returns
From the Asiatic
Station.
The Feeling in Japan and China
One or Fear and Un
certainty.
American Interests Weil Protected
Abroad, but More Battle-Ship*
Needed at Home.
Rear- Admiral McNalr. who has been
in command of the Asiatic squadron
from November, 1595, until the 3d inst..
when he was relieved and ordered
home, arrived in the city yesterday by
the Coptic on his way to Washington,
D. C. where he has been told to re
port to the department for further
duty on one of the other stations.
The admiral was seen last evening In
the parlors of the Occidental, where he
Is Btaying with Lieutenant Rearay
and Lieutenant Logan, who accompany
him as aids. Though closely question
ed on the situation in the Orient, all
three of the officers absolutely refused
to express any opinion on the matter
whatever, as the regulations of the
Navy Department are very stringent
In such cases.
"I would be very glad to give you
matter for an article on the Eastern
question," said the admiral, "but of
course, in my position, any expression
of opinion would be exceedingly bad
taste.
"The feeling in China and Japan may
be said to be one of uneasy uncer
tainty.
"Every one knows that the diplo
matic situation is one of the greatest
delicacy and that the anticipation of
trouble can only be realized or allayed
by what appears in the future.
"The fleets of the powers in Asiatic
waters have been increased until they
are all represented by an unusually
heavy armed force, but what that may
portend is something I know as little
about as you do. In fact, since Janu
ary 3, when I turned my command over
to Commodore Dewey, I have been
far less informed on the situation than
are the papers here in America, which
are getting dally telegrams from all
points of the compass on the probabil
ity and improbability of war.
"Yes" â in answer to a question re
specting our force in Asiatic waters â
"we are amply represented. When I
left there were five American ve63Â»lÂ«j
there, and, with one on her way from
this port and the Raleigh due shortly
from the Atlantic, we will have a
fleet of seven vessels, the best of their
class in the world, to protect American
interests and uphold, if necessary, the
honor of the American flag."
"What do we most need at present
in the way of addition to our navy?"
was then asked.
"Wo should have more battle-ships,"
replied the admiral.
"This coast should have at least six
more vessels of that class, while an
addition of twelve battle-ships to the
fleet on our Atlantic seaboard would
still leave us below the limit."
The admiral and his party will only
remain in San Francisco until this
evening, when they will leave on the 6
o'clock overland and go straight
through to Washington.
TO SUCCEED
W. J. MARTIN
Frank R. Steele Appointed Man
ager of the Local Western
Union Office.
Formerly Manager at El Paso and One
of the Best Known Men in the
Company's Employ.
Frank R. Steele, who will succeed Wil
liam J. Martin as manager of the Wes
tern Union Telegraph Company in this
city, arrived from El Paso yesterday
morning and is a guest at the Palace
Hotel.
Mr. Martin's resignation will go into
effect on February 1. and on that date
Mr. Steele will assume the duties of the
office, but between now and then the
transfer of books and accounts Is to be
madeâ a laborious proceeding, which will
occupy the entire time of both gentlemen.
Although a stranger to California and a
comparatively young man. Mr. Steele is
an old and trusted employe of the West
ern Union Company, having spent
eighteen of the thirty-seven years of
his life in Its service, while holding some
of the most Important offices in the coun-
Enterlng the company's employ when
but 19 years of age. he has risen from
check boy to operator, to chief operator,
and for the past six years has been man
agor of the El Paso office, one of the
most Important in the country because
of its being a relay station on the south
ern overland route as well as the transfer
point of all the Mexican and considerable
of the Central and South American busi-
Previous to going to E! Paso Mr. Steele
had charge of the Board of. Trade offico
in Chicago, a position that requires the
highest Â« apabllltics. nrd it was his ex
(client work in that position that earned
for him his advancement to the mana
gership of the Xl Paso office.
Mr Pt^ele has also held positions of re
sponsibility In Denver and Deming. where,
he was chief operator, and In Omaha,
where he was wire chief.
There were several candidates for the
position of manager of the local office
when it was announced that Mr. Martin
would retire, but Mr. Steele was selected
as being best fitted for the place.
Pan Francisco ranks third In order of
importanre from a telegraphic stand
point. New York and Chicago being the
only two oftVes that exceed it. and it is a
high tribute to Mr. Btecto'l business qual
ities to be selected for the position.

MYSTERY OF A
MAN'S DEATH
Theodore Figel Placed on
Trial Before Judge
Cook.
It Is Evident It Will Not Be
Easy to Secure a Jury
to Try Him.
None of the Talesmen Examined
Yesterday Were Found to
Be Available.
It will not be an easy matter to se
cure a Jury to try Theodore A. Figel,
the young bookkeeper, who is accused
of having murdered Isaac Hoffman,
one of his employers, on the evening of
June 1 last. The examination of the
talesmen summoned to try Figel for
his life was commenced yesterday be
fore Judge Cook, and, when the ad
journment hour arrived not a Juror had
been selected. The talesmen were ex
cused for various reasons; some of
them being disqualified, and others
who were acceptable to the prosecu
tion were not acceptable to the defense,
and vice versa.
The examination of talesmen is gene
rally a wearisome process, and owing
to the wide latitude taken by counsel
in questioning the prospective jurors
yesterday the proceedings soon be
came dull, dreary and monotonous. The
defendant appeared to be the most
disinterested person in the courtroom.
He leaned back easily in a chair by the
side of his counsel, W. H. L. Barnes
and Davis Louderback, and compla
cently chewed gum. He seldom spoke
to the attorneys, and seemed to be en
tirely indifferent as to the proceedings
that mean so much to him.
"^'hen the case was called Flgel's at
torneys announced that they were
ready to proceed to trial. Ex-Judge D.
J. Murphy and Henry Ach, who will aid
Assistant District Attorney Hosmer in
the prosecution, said that they were
also ready, and Judge Cook instructed
Clerk Tolle to draw twelve names from
the jury-box.
W. H. Wickersham, L. Lassar, J. W.
Hinds, F. Soderer, G. O. Jewett. S. M.
Fielding, K. Meussdorffer, A, McLaugh
lin, F. W. Hadley, A. R. Wells, J. R.
Drew and F. A. Will were the first
twelve called.
After they were sworn ex-Judge Mur- j
prfy arose and made the opening state- I
ment for the prosecution. He reviewed j
at length the circumstances surround
irp the discovery of Hoffman uncon
sciots and dying In the office of j
his store at the corner of Bush I
and Battery streets. He claimed
that the vounds could not have
been self-inflicted and that Hoffman
had been shot dcwn by some one who
was familiar with the premises. HÂ«
scoffed at the idea Â«t suicide and said .
the prosecution expected to prove by :
a strong chain of circumstantial evi
dence that the bullet wour4s fram
which Hoffman died a few houT-s. after j
being taken to the Receiving HospV&l '
had been inflicted by Figel.
Then followed the examination of the i
talesmen. They were questioned by j
ex-Judge Murphy as to whether they
were opposed to capital punishment or i
circumstantial evidence, and then as
to their acquaintance with any of the
witnesses examined for the defense at
the preliminary hearing, or acquaint
anceship or friendship with either the
defendant, his counsel or any member
of his family.
The examination for the defense was
conducted by Attorney Louderback,
who wanted to ascertain how far the
talesmen had read the newspaper ac
counts of the tragedy; whether they
had formed any opinion as to the guilt
or innocence of the defendant, and
whether they had any acquaintance
with the officers for the prosecution or
the relatives and friends of Hoffman.
F. Saderer was the first talesman ex- :
cjsed. He was not on the assessment
roll.
W. H. Wlckersham satisfactorily an- ,
swered all questions asked him, but, '
like Soderer, was excused because he ;
was not on the assessment roll.
L. Lassar was temporarily passed, j
and K. Meusdorffer was excused be
cause he had formed a fixed opinion I
on the case.
J. W. Hinds and S. If. Fielding were
excused because of sickness; G. O. Jew*
ett because ho was opposed to capital !
punishment, and F. A. Will because he ;
had formed an opinion and said he \
would not like to be tried by a juror
who was in the same frame of mind j
as he was.
J. R. Drew, A. R. Wells and A. Mc-
Lauphlln, like Lassar, were temporarily
pnssed. but the four of them were aft
erward peremptorily challenged. Las
sar and McLaughlin were excused by
the prosecution and Wells and Drew
by the defense.
The Jury-box was then empty and
the following twelve talesmen were

OPPOSES AN EASTERN TRIP
Editor Creed Declares Berkeley's
Athletic Team Is Not Well
Equipped.
BERKELEY, Jan. 25.-In an editorial
in the Californian this morninp Editor
Creed vigorously opposes the proposed 1
Eastern tour of the university athletic
team in statements that will doubtless be
contested by the athletic enthusiasts. In
the course of the editorial he says:
The fact is that the Eastern team project is
one that should be undertaken only by an as
sociation which is strong financially and well
equipped. Oura is neither. There Is, it is
true, a certain amount of advantage to be
derived by a team If it go East just as there
Is an advantage In contesting against them,
hut it is not worth $6000. There is also the ar
gument that a tour of the kind will advertise
the university, but our idea of what the '95
team did In this particular is exaggerated. It
was the blast of our own trumpet we heard.
Besides, we are sufficiently advertised by the
work of the Phebe A. Hearst Architectural
Plans, and it Is our opinion that when an ath
letic team is used in a conscious endeavor to
advertise a university. It Is bad both for the
university and athletics.

the Day.
Myth Defeated by San Marco â Imp.
Tripping Led a Good Field
Past the Wire.
The talent gave the hooks another
awful drubbing at Ingleside yesterday.
Everything broke in their favor Malay,
favorite for the opening event, did not
command much of a following, and the
youngster's downfall profited the books
but little. After that little miscue.
Myth was the only favorite to go down,
and the winner, San Marco, was equally
as heavily supported. The books were
eoused with coin on all of the winners
and the twenty-seven now doing busi
ness will probably be reduced at the
next drawing.
The Canadian delegation, led by Mar
ley Kittleman, the well-known pprin
ter, were out for a "killing" with Myth
In the mile and a sixteenth. They back- j
ed the gelding down from 11 to 5 t>> 3
to 2 favoritism, and had "Skeets" Mar
tin in the saddlo. (After leading to the j
stretch, he was overtaken and beaten !
out rather handily by San Marcn, which
horse opened favorite. The winner was !
ridden to good advantage by Charley {
Thorpe.
The mile purse run went to the fa- |
vorite. Imp. Tripping, piloted by Loir
nie Clayton. The mare was a pro- I
noimced choice in the betting, and j
â when half the distance had been cov
ered looked beaten. She finished strong
in the run home, however, and with
little to spare won by half a length
from Harry Thoburn. The latter made
all the running and killed off the well- I
played Cabrillo, astride which Thorpe !
did too much hustling the first part.
Thfl two year-old scramble developed
a good thing in the Panlque-Waiting
II colt, Als.) Ran, which skylarked out
in the front of his field and won gal
loping from the favorite, Malay, at the
luscious price of 25 to 1. He was rid- |
den by J. Harris, a colored lad. Prince i
Will, an outsider, finished in the show, j
Although the suspicious underpin
ning of Kamsin did not offer much en
couragement. Ezell's gelding was play
ed from 5 to 2 down to B to 6 and de- j
feated his company in the six furlong
sprint following with ease. Thorpe,
who had th 5 mount, forced his way to
the front near the far turn, and taking
a commandirifr lead won hqnds down

ARCHITECT SHEA TALKS.
Interesting Results of an Investigation
of a Suppressed Grand Jury-
Report.
Architect Frank Shea and the mem
bers of the City Hall Commission are
Indignant at the sensational statements
of Contractor D. O'Sullivan, formulated
by him while a member of the former
Grand Jury, which plainly charge rob
bery and jobbery in the construction
of the City Hall dome. Their expla
nations, supported by the records of
the commission, rather extinguish the
glimmering light in which Mr. Sulli
van posed as a coming City Hall St.
George, about to slay the dragon of
corruption.
"The so-called 'suppressed report' i
made to the former Grand Jury," said ;
Mr. Shea yesterday, 'is wholly inac
curate as to detail, and was inspired
by vindictiveness. Mr. O'Sullivan Is
Its author. About the time he was
concocting It the Mayor received
anonymous information that a private
Investigation of scandalous import was
in progress on behalf of the Grand
Jury, and like advice was received by
one on the outside. The matter was !
brought to the attention of the com
mission, and they at once instructed
the secretary to formally invite the
Grand Jury to a full and thorough in- j
quiry, proffering at the same time every |
possible assistance. The invitation *Â»â¢

. &ir. O'Sullivan failed
to bine - me subcontract for whi^h he
bid. the plastering. Shortly afterward
he got on the Grand Jury."
It seems that Mr. Rudgear endeav- I
cred to befriend Mr. O'Sullivan. "His i
bid." said Mr. Rudgear, "was a thou- i
sand dollars in excess of the lowest,
but I told him that if he would pare it
down as closely as possible he might
secure the subcontract, inasmuch as I
would look to him for a good class of
â¢workmanship. He came within $600
of the lowest bid, and then I offered to ;
make the contract with him. He ob- I
Jected to signing it on account of a I
clause which was embodied in all my j
subcontracts, because it is in my con- i
tract with the city. This clause has !
ccst me several thousand dollars, I'll
admit; but I have taken great pride
In the work and gone to every length
to satisfy the commission. I would not ;
let a subcontract without a similar !
agreement, and the result was that Mr.
O'Sullivan angrily declined to take the
work.
The objectionable clause was as fol
lows:
13. In case it should be found, during the
progress of the contract, that any work or
any portion of any of the work or material
Included in the contract can, without preju
dice to th<Â» building, be omitted; or, if con
sidered desirable for any other reason, the
contractor shall, on receiving the written or
der of the architect, omit any work or ma
terials as bo ordered: and puch omission if
any, s=hall not in any wise vitiate or put' an
end to the contract, but the value of the
name shall be ascertained and fixed by the
architect, according to fair and current rates
and prices, and the amount thereof be deduct
ed and kept back from the contract amount
or from any Installment or balance due or be
coming due to the contractor on account of
the contract.
The protective purport of this agree
ment requires little elucidation. Its
plain intent is to leave the commission
and their architect masters of the con
struction, both in the matter of pro
curing the best class of materials and
In modifying the plans for architec
tural betterment. While the law does
provide that no alterations shall be
made in the plans between the time
bids are made and contracts entered
into, for the obvious purpose of pre
venting collusion, it authorizes modifi
cations subsequent to the date of con
tract, manifestly to afford scope for
complete control of the materials used
and for those architectural improve
ments which inevitably become expe
dient in raisins great structures as
practical progress is made. It is in
keeping with the latter power that the
commission Imposed on the San Fran
cisco Novelty and Plating Company
the agreement quoted, which Mr
O'Sallivan found to be obnoxious when
he was about to enter into a sub-con
tract.
The specific scandal in Mr. O'Sulll
van's report, to which he points as
proof positive of willful evasion of the
law, in that certain contract specifica
tions were omitted or changed, looks j
ugly until the law and the records have '
been investigated. It. has been pointed
out already that the commission is 1
fully empowered to change the plans
and specifications during the perform
ance of the contract, provided that
thereby the contract be not vitiated i
They are further required, in making
such modifications, to convert the ma
terials to have been used to other uses
or to apply the sums of money repre
sented to improvements not contem
plated in the original plans. That Is to
say, when the architect found that an
economy of iron or ornament could be
made in one place .and used advan
tageously in another, the commission,
if satisfied with the recommendation'
bo ordered. If, again, he discovered
that a certain specification was either
unnecessary or undesirable with rela
tion to the original plans, and that in
the plans and specifications an un
foreseen improvement, found to be
necessary or desirable, had been un
provided for, he advised the omission
of the one and the substitution of the
other Under the law the contractor
la protected to the full amount of his
BATTERY I'S HERO.
PRIVATE JOHN M. JONES SAVES SEVEN SOLDIERS
FROM HORRIBLE DEATHS.
Battery I of the regular army has a hero In the person of Private John
M. Jones.
To the courage and quickness of Private Jones seven men owe their lives.
The people of the State owe him a debt of gratitude, for he saved Jubilee
Day from a disaster that wimld have cast a cloud of sorrow upon the fes
tive occasion.
TVlth his bare hands he extinguished a fire In a smoldering hag that
contained fifty pounds of powder during the time the Jubilee salute of
twenty-one guns was being fired at Lime Point. It all happened in an in
stant, but it was one of those brief periods of time that seem an age and that
often make brave men grow gray. The event came about in this way.
Lieutenant Charles W. Foster of Rattery I, stationed at Lime Point, was
detailed to take charge of the firing of the salute from the Marin shore, and
with him were Sergeant M. L. Mitchell and Privates Davis, Dunigan, Seigle,
Morley. Winters, the gunner, and Jones. The squad loaded one of the big
fifteen-inch guns with fifty pounds of black powder. The priming wire was
driven down â¦*- â¢ -Â»- friction primer put in place. At the signal
ls silent. Three times this was
jsion that the vent hole had
rge, which was sewed up In a
by screwing a worm, fast
% the bag out. This took the
n, Seigle and Morley, for the
d every man turned pale In
next moment. The last
'nstant the whole charge
. was berÂ». v . ,ne smoldering bag and with
he ...a smothered the burning wool before It could
. ..'i to make sure he plastered some damp earth Into the
. ..i enges.
The danger past, the brave fellow arose, stepped back to his place
and touched his cap in salute to his superior officer. His face was white and
beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead, but not with fear. The faces
of those he had saved were even whiter and for a moment no one spoke.
Then all broke out in thanks and praise for the noble act that had saved
their lives, officers and privates alike.
As soon as the soldiers recovered th^ir nerves the charge was again
placed in the big gun and fired, and the roar was heard for miles. One of
those whose life Jones saved said: "If it had not been for Jones' presence of
mind and bravery every man of us would have been blown into atoms in an
other second, and all that there would have been left would have been a
dismounted gun and a big hole in the ground. There was no chance to es
cape, and if the fire had reached the powder it would have been all day with
vp â and the salute. I have read of deeds of valor and rare presence of min'l.
but this has no equal, and all the boys in the battery have voted Jones the
bravest man in the service."
Jones' bravery was the talk of the enlisted men yesterday at all of the
stations around the bay. The hero bears his praises modestly and keeps his
blistered hands out of sight as much as possible. He is only twenty-four
years of age and has been in the service only two years.
Jones is a native of Rogersville, Term. He has been in Battery I for eigh
teen months.
contract by the duty imposed on the
commission to apply what is subtract
ed in the one instance by the annul
ment or change of a specification to
what is deemed to be expedient in the
other under a new specification. The
new specifications are drawn on the
basis of average cost for materials as
specified in the original contract cov
ering the entire structure. Thus it will
be seen the architect and commission
are given requisite latitude for per
fecting the work, while the contractor
is bound to suffer no material loss on
account of curtailment of contract
after he has agreed to complete the
work for a specific sum.
Mr. O'Sullivan's alleged violation of
the plans consists of eighteen items.
The architect's records show that he 4s
in fault as to each and every one. Nor
are the several amounts provided for in
the several specifications correct. The
facts are proved in detail to be as fol
lows :
"1. Cast iron base in the three floors
of the rotunda and grand staircase â
$1400." These bases were changed to
marble at a cost of $3400.
"2. Sixteen iron columns, supporting
lantern mounting inner glass dome â
$200." Changed to steel at a cost of $200.
"3. Thirty white metal capitals of
columns in first and second floors of ro
tunda, to have been copper plated at
three pounds per square foot and then
electrically plated with goldâ s7soo." This
sum is wrong. It was $3400. For a like
amount heavy hammered pure copper
was substituted.
"4. Twenty-three white metal capitals
of columns in grand staircase, copper
plated at throe pounds per square foot â
$650." These are all present according to
contract.
"5. Ornamental belt on top of the
marble wainscoting of lower rotunda, to
have been white metal, copper plate
same as aboveâ slÂ£oo." Changed to heavy
pure copper; same cost.
"6. Twenty-four chandeliers in ro
tundaâ $550." All in place acording to
contract, with an additional one worth
$100 in Mayor's office for which no pro
vision had been made in the contract,
and which the contractor gratuitously
furnished.
"7. Six standards on newels of grand
staircaseâ sl2o." Four omitted, with the
value offset by wiring for and providing
for twenty electric lights in ceiling and
dome of grand staircase.
"8. Two rooms over Mayor's office to
have been furred and lathedâ sloo."
"9. Two new windows to have been
put in over Mayors officeâ sloo." Not
called for in contract.
"10. Plaster cornices, with ornaments,
in grand staircaseâ slso." Changed to
dome form, necessitating large amount of
steel framing.
"1L Plaster cornices, with ornaments,
in three floors of rotundaâ sÃoo." Placed
on two floors and removed after erection
because of 111 effect architecturally Ex
ist now on one floor.
"12. Two mantels in rooms over Mayor's
officeâ s2oo." Omitted for want of neces
sary flues, and $200 applied to putting in
large oak door from an architrave at en
trance to main hall from rotunda.

With a Sandbag.
ROBBERS HAD TO RETREAT.
Police Notified of the Affair, but So
Far No Arrests Have Been
Made.
One of the boldest and most desper
ate attempts at robbery every record
ed In this city was committed early
yesterday morning in the saloon owned
by W. H. Davies on the corner of
Haight and CJough streets, known as
"Burkes old saloon."
About 2 o'clock two men entered the
saloon and asked for Fred Hanson, the
bartender, who was alone at the bar,
for two glasses of whisky. Hanson
served them, and after drinking the li
quor one of the men asked to be shown
the toilet room. Hanson directed him
to it, and after he left the other man
asked to be allowed to use the tele
phone.
The saloon extends from Market
street through to Rose avenue, a pas
sage extending through from the bar
with boxes on each side. About, the
center of the boxes is the telephone
room. Hanson told the man that the
proprietor was in the telephone room,
but he would go with him to ask him
to allow the stranger to use the instru
ment. They went together, and on
reaching the telephone room Mr. Da
vies was leaning back on a chair doz
ing. Hanson said: "Mr. Davies, this
man wants to use the telephone." He
had scarcely got the words out of his
mouth when the stranger grabbed hold
of him and threw him into the room
against Davies. Hanson recovered
himself immediately and jumped for
the stranger, divining his intention.
There was a fierce struggle between
the two men and the stranger all the
time attempted to use a revolver which
he hid hurriedly drawn, from his
pocket. In the struggle the revolver
fell from his hand and alighted at Da
vies' feet who had not up to this time
comprehended distinctly what was go
ing on. He remarked, "What's this?"
as he stooped to pick up the revolver.
The other robber had by this time
made his appearance, and as Davies
stooped he was struck a violent blow
over the head with a sandbag. The
force of the blow burst the sandbag
and Davies was covered with sand and
slungshot. He was stunned for a
moment and then he fully realized that
the two men were intending to rob
the cash register and himself.
He made for the sand-bagger and
meantime the bartender had succeed
ed In throwing his antagonist down
and was holding onto him like grim
death. Before Daviea could tackle his
man he had turned upon Hanson and
thrown off the robber who Jumped to
his feet and rushed out of the side door
leading to Gougrh street. The second
robber rushed along the passage way
into the saloon, closely pursued by Da
vies and the bartender. Each seized
a bottle and made for the robber who
had by this time reached the exit into
Market street. He turned around at

! borhood was made for the two robbers,
; but no trace of them could be found.
Davles and the bartender were able to
j give a good description of them, and
I the detectives who have been detailed
I on the case expect to have no difficul
ty in capturing them.
A portion of the sandbag is in the
hands of the police, which they think
may help them in locating the two
robbers.
The robbers had been watching- the
place for over an hour, as they were
seen by several people standing on the
opposite corner, apparently waiting
the chance when the saloon was empty
of customers.
"I feel sure." said Davies yesterday,
"that the robbers were familla* with
the interior of the saloon, and they ex
pected that the bartender would be
alone, as I don't stay so long as a
rule. The thing happened so quickly
that I had scarcely time to realize
what it was all about when it was
over.
"The men were not masked, and that
shows that they were either novices in
the business or strangers in the city.
I have a lump on my cheek, and I
suppose I must have been struck on
the face also by one of the robbers."

FRIENDS NO LONGER.
Timothy Driscoll and Con Crorjin
of the Potrero flgree to
Disagree.
Timothy Driscoll and Con Cronin live in
the Potrero, and they were fast friends
until Sunday. They agreed Sunday after
noon to row across the bay to Oakland,
but they were foolish enough to Indulge
in frequent libations before they started.
The result was that after they were
about 100 yards from the shore the boat
capsized, and they had to swim ashore.
The cold bath had the effect of sobering
them, but thoy started in again, and on
their way home late at night in an elec
tric car each charged the other with
trying to irown him by capsizing the

smoke of b&ttle cleared away one of the

were arrested and bunked at the City
Prison on charges of disturbing the peace
and malicious mischief.
