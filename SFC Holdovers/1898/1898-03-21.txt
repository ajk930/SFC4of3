SPAIN FORTIFYING
HOME PORTS AND
THE PHILIPPINES
By the 15th of May the Madrid
Government Will Have Reached
the Zenith of Its Fighting
Strength.
NEW YORK, March 20.â
A special to the Herald from
Washington says: Information
has reached the authorities that
Spain is actively fortifying her
home ports and those in the
Philippine Islands. This is one
of the many preparations which
the Spanish Government is mak
ing' for emergencies of the
future. According to informa
tion in the hands of the authori
ties the entrances to Manila har
bor are being prepared for the
reception of mines, which can
be placed down at a moment's
notice in the event that war is
declared. This is also true of
some ports of Spain.
Commodore George Dewey, com
manding the Asiatic squadron, is keep
ing a sharp watch on the movements
of Spanish official^ in the Philippines,
and he advises the department as soon
as possible of what they are doing in the
line of putting ports in such condition
as to resist offensive movements of his
squadron, which is stationed at Hong
kong, 600 miles away.
The vessels comprising his squadron
are the cruisers Olympia, Boston and
Raleigh, and the gunboats Petrel and
Concord. This squadron will be re
enforced within two weeks by the
cruiser Baltimore, which left Honolulu
on March 17 for Hongkong With this
force at his command it is believed by
the department that Commodore Dewey
will not have any difficulty in destroy
ing the five Spanish gunboats which are
in Philippine waters and reducing the
fortifications of Manila and other points.
Naval preparations are being pushed
with the utmost vigor by the Spanish
authorities.
Information which has reached the
naval attache of the Government in
Madrid is to the effect that Spain will
reach the zenith of her naval strength by
the 15th of May. By that time all her
battleships and torpedo boats and tor
pedo boat destroyers now under con
struction will be finished. Her naval
force in commission will therefore be
increased within the next two months
by the battle-ships Pelayo, Numancia
and Vittoria. The Princesa de Asturias
will not be ready for service for several
months, although Spain is workinc
night and day on her and i pushing
her completion in every way possible.
It is known by officials that iust as
soon as Spain completes work on these
vessels they will be placed in commis
sion and sent to the Canary Islands,
where the torpedo boat flotilla is an
chored. This point is some 700 miles
nearer to Cuba than is C 2 "!z. and it will
be naturally to Spain's interests to sta
tion the fleet at this point.
The plan of campaign which will
be followed by this Government, as the
Herald has stated, will be to intercept
the flotilla in case it should attempt to
cross from the Canary Islands to Porto
Rico unattended by a fleet, and it will
be an easy, task to destroy it in daytime
The San Francisco Call
I as the armament of these vessels will
j have to be removed in order to permit
i them to make the cruise.
RELIEF FOR THE
STARVING CUBANS

TORPEDO BOATS
AND DESTROYERS
BADLY NEEDED
As Enough of These Vessels Can't
Be Bought Abroad Long Will
Place Emergency Con#
tracts at Home.
NEW YORK, March 20.â A
Washington special to the Her
aJd says: In order to strengthen
the navy where it is weakest
Secretary Long is contemplating
the placing of contracts for the
rapid construction of torpedo
boat destroyers and torpedo
boats. This matter is under seri
ous consideration on account of
the failure of efforts of represen
tatives of this Government
abroad to purchase destroyers
and sea-going torpedo boats. Al
though the United States naval
attaches and diplomatic repre
sentatives have been negotiating
with ship builders and Govern
ments for the last two weeks for
the purchase of vessels of this
type no success whatever has at
tended their efforts, and It is
apparent, according to state
ments made by naval officials,
that it is practically Impossible
to add such boats to the navy
by purchase from foreign ship
builders.
In view of this fact and of the pos
sibilities of the future Secretary Long,
in accordance with the recommendation
of the Roosevelt strategic board, which
completed its work the first of last
week, telegraphed on Friday to ship
builders in all parts of the country re
questing that they inform him at once
of their price for building destroyers
and torpedo boats. Destroyers, the Sec
retary stated, must be of 350 tons dis
placement and capable of steaming at
a rate of thirty knots per hour, and
must be finished within the shortest j
possible time. Torpedo boats, the Sec
retary added, were to be of fifty tons
displacement, each with a speed of
twenty knots or more. These boats are
to be for torpedo defense only.
In response to the telegrams Lewis
Nixon of the Crescent Shipbuilding
Works of Elizabethport, N. J., and
other representatives of shipbuilding
firms, came to Washington yesterday
and conferred with the Secretary and
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt, but no
contracts were let. I understand that
Mr. Nixon offered to build torpedo
boats within thirty days, working night
and day. This is considered a good
proposition by the department and has
been taken under serious advisement.
It is appreciated by the officials that
it will take longer to build torpedo
boat destroyers than torpedo boats.
Chief Naval Constructor Hichborn es
timates that by working night and day
a ship-builder ought to finish a de
stroyer within four months, and tor
pedo boats In less time. The Chief Con
structor is in favor of placing heavy
penalties in all contracts made in case
â¢builders should fail to deliver on time,
and offset this penalty to give a high
premium for every da'- that the boat
is delivered ahead of time. This matter
has been brought to the attention of
department officials and will, undoubt
edly, be adopted.
Should Secretary Long decide to
abandon entirely the efforts to get de
stroyers and torpedo boats abroad, It
is explained he will at once make con
tracts for these types of vessels. A de
partment official with whom I talked
told me this Government ought to have
at least fifteen destroyers and suffi
cient torpedo boats to place a number^
In each harbor for defence of cities
located on the shores. It If feared by
officials in favor of the report of the
Rodgers board that the department
will not be able to secure yachts which
will be suitable for torpedo-boat de
stroyers, although It is expected that
a number of seagoing tugs and small
yachts will be acquired and converted
into torpedo boats. The most pressing
need of the navy to-day, however, ac
cording to the officials, is tornedo-boat
destroyers, and all their efforts are be
ing directed toward the acquirement of
this type of boat.

PRESIDENT M'KINLEY
PREPARING DEMANDS
AND A PITHY MESSAGE
Formulating a Note of Representation to
Spain and Information for
Congress.
_ ââââââ
Conclusions and Report of the Maine Court of In
quiry Will Be Promptly Followed by the
Recognition of the Independence
of Cuba.
NEW YORK, March 20.â
The Herald's Washington cor
respondent telegraphs: Having
positive knowledge that the re
port of the Naval Court of In
quiry investigating the cause of
the Maine disaster will show that
the vessel was destroyed by an
external agency, President Mc-
Kinley is now engaged in form
ulating a note of representation
to Spain and a message on the
subject to Congress.
In furtherance of his proposition,
previously announced in the Herald,
the President intends to take Congress
into his entire confidence, and to sub
mit the full text of the report, together
with the findings and with a statement
setting forth that he has made vigorous
diplomatic representation to Spain. It
is also intended to send all the Cuban
correspondence to Congress at an early
date.
These conclusions have been finally
arrived at as a result of unofficial in
formation coming from official sources
which reached the President yesterday
from Rear Admiral Sicard. who con
vened the Court of Inquiry, and who is.
therefore, empowered to discus 9 with
the court the evidence it has taken and
the findings it has reached. I can state
authoritatively that the report of the
Court of Inquiry has not yet been sub
mitted to the President or received in
Washington, but it is confidently ex
pected it will be here by Tuesday.
As a result of the receint of Rear Ad
miral Sicard's communication, I can re
peat with emphasis what has already
been stated in the Herald, that the court
has found that the destruction of the
battleship Maine was clearly due to an
outside cause, in which the Spanish had
no official participation, and that the
court has been unable to definitely de
termine the person or persons respon
sible for this cause.
It will acquit the officers and men of
any blame in connection with the dis
aster, on the ground that the ship was
in excellent condition at the time, and
that the second explosion resulted from
the first, which took nlace on the port
side, directly under fr* forward maga
zine. The contents of this magazine
were detonated by a primary explosion;
and the ship was consequently de
stroyed.
The information contained in Rear
Admiral Sicard's letter confirms in
every particular the deductions made by
the Herald from the discovery of the
keel plates of the Maine above water,
made by Ensign W. V. f owelson. The
court has laid specific stress upon this
discovery.
Although the President has been led
to expect just such a finding as reported
by Rear Admiral Sicard, he was not
fully prepared to definitely outline his
policy until he obtained the information
which has just come to hand. Mr. Mc-
Kinley realizes that the publication of
the report is likely to create a profound
sensation in Congress, even though the
court is unable to connect the Spanish
Government with the crime. But he has
not abandoned his purpose of treating
the question judiciously and diplomatic
ally. He appreciates that Congress and
the country have a right to all the in
formation in his possession, and it is
with this idea in mind that he intends
to transmit the report and findings to
Congress at once.
As another indication of the adminis
tration's purpose tc take prompt action
on the court's report, I learned to-day
that telegraphic instructions were sent
to Rear Admiral Sicard some days ago
directing that he request the court to
make two copies of its record and find
ings. One of these will be for Con
gress, the other for Spain. With the
first will go the President's message;
with the second his demand for immedi
ate reparation. v It is not the desire of
the President 'to pre.cinitate action .: by
Congress pending diplomatic negotia
tions for settlement of the Maine disas
ter, and it is, therefore , . not likely that
he will make any recommendations as
t-> the course Congress â  shall pursue.
On the contrary, his message will show
that he is dealing' with the matter in a
vigorous, diplomatic way and that he
will promptly communicate further as
soon !as Spain's reply is received.
.If the reply .is â¢ not satisfactory Con
gress will then be in position to share
the responsibility ; with the President
for i any i further â¢ -action .' that i may be
necessary; py : Ggvernp^eat pu.tgl^g.
the usual diplomatic channels. It is the
firm expectation <'f the administration
that Spain in repy to the President's
representation wE forward the report
of the Spanish Co-.rt of Inquiry, which
will find that the jessel was destroyed
by an internal cau^e, due to negligence
of one of the officers or members of the
crew. Then will <:orae a diplomatic
clash, the outcome: of which can hardly
be anticipated.
It is surmised that Spain will suggest
arbitration, and in view of this possi
bility the authorities are already dis
cussing how they will meet the propo
sition if it comes. Conservative mem
bers of the Cabinet will be inclined to
recommend the adoption of such a
course, but so much depends upon tine
temper and possible action of Congress
that it is hard to say what the final
decision will be on this point.
As previously stated in the Herald
the Maine disaster will at first be
treated independently of the general
Cuban question, but it will be consid
ered as a kindred subject in connection
with future action looking to the ending
of the war in Cuba. Just at the present
time the authorities are feeling the
pulse of other foreign countries as to
whether they would follow the action
of the United States in recognizing the
independence of Cuba in case that step
should be taken.
Jt is believed, if the President
can receive the assurances of Great
Britain and South American countries
that they will join in such recognition,
that he will act in this direction im
mediately. In this connection a promi
nent member of the Cabinet said to
me to-day:
"My judgment, from the tone of the
British press, is that England and
other European nations would, in the
interest of humanity. If for no other
motive, Join the United States in
bringing to an end the distress now
prevailing in Cuba.. In dealing with
the M?aine disaster this Government
must be able to satisfy the world that
the destruction of the ship was brought
about through the agency of the
Spanish Government before we can de
mand damages. The question of dam
ages is a subject for arbitration, but
there is nothing to arbitrate in the act
of recognizing Cuban independence.
"As much as we deplore the terrible
calamity which befell the Maine and
her gallant crew, we must demonstrate
beyond question that the Spanish Gov
ernment is directly or indirectly re
sponsible. To my mind tne great ques
tion to be met, and met promptly, is
whether the United States shall inter
vene to put a stop to the cruel and de
vastating conflict that is now going on
in Cuba. As I said, I believe all civil
ized nations will Join the United States
in such a humanitarian and Christian-
like act."

AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT
OF EXTERNAL EXPLOSION.
It Is Given in Secret Instructions
Returning Captain Sigsbee
to Active Duty.
HAVANA, via Herald-Call dispatch-
boat Triton to Key West, Fla., March
20. â The first announcement on author
ity that the Maine was destroyed by
an external explosion, and that the
Court of Inquiry so finds, has been re
ceived here. It comes in the form of
secret instruction from Washington
to Captain Sigsbee that he is to be re
turned to active duty. This announce
ment sets all doubt aside, for the rea
son that any other finding than de
struction by means of force externally
applied would mean a court-martial
for Captain Sigsbee.
No date has been set for the cap
tain's departure from Havana, but he
understands that as soon as the demo
lition of the Maine proceeds a little
further he will be called to Washing
ton and his ship will technically go out
of commission. As soon as proper ar
rangements can be made and a crew of
men and officers be gathered together
he will take charge of one of the
additions to the new American navy.
Should President McKinley be success
ful in his efforts to purchase the O'Hig
gins and San Martino, Captain Sigsbee
will be given command of one of those
fighting monsters, so his friends in
Washington have been assured.
To the superficial observer there has
been little change in Havana during the
past week. The local press, however,
has assumed a more radical tone. The
censor now permits the publication
daily of inflammatory articles hereto
fore carefully suppressed.
More than all the causes for the in
creased surliness and hostility shown
toward Americans is the undoubted
fact that Spaniards here begin to be

GENERAL MOORE
FAVORS ALLIANCE
Commander of the British Land
Forces in North America
Speaks on the Pros
pect of War.
NEW YORK, March 20. â General Montgomery Moore of Halifax,
N. 8., commander of the British land forces in North America, spent
Sunday in Boston.
"What do you think of the suggestion of an alliance of the two Eng
lish-speaking nations?" he was asked to-night.
"That has long been talked of, and I think it desirable, but we have
an Idea that many of your people do not have any too much affection
for Great Britain. We think that the history you teach in your public
schools does not do England justice, and that it tends to prejudice the
young against us. The English have great pride in the fact that they
planted colonies here which have produced this vast republic, and
think we should be closely allied."
"Do you think that war will be the outcome of the Maine affair?"
"No, I do not. It would be deplorable if it should. It would set
civilization back many years. I do not think there will be any cause
for war. Nothing is known of course, officially, but I am inclined to
think the explosion was of an internal character. These things have
happened in our own navy. It is seldom, or almost never, that a con
spiracy is so completely successful as to destroy a vessel so utterly as
was the Maine."
"If it shall be shown that the disaster was not caused internally,
general, do you think the United States will have ground for any de
mand upon Spain for reparation?"
"It is preposterous to think that the Spanish Government could
have been concerned, but if any of her servants did it, I think the law
of nations would compel her to make reparation and discipline the of
fenders. If one of my servants should drive over a man in the street,
I should bo legally responsible. So it would be if a servant of the
Spanish Government blew up the Maine. But if the deed was done by
desperadoes, Ido not think Spain could be held responsible. I should
not want to express a decided opinion upon this point, but warships
would be unrioeirable visitors in friendly ports if the nation in whose
port they were visiting had to become insurers of their safety under
all conditions."
expected, however, early in the pres
ent week, and as soon as received it
would be handed at once to trie Presi
dent, and when it has been read by the
President it will be made public. Sec
retary Long, in speaking of the report,
said that while fully realizing its im
jh.nance, the country, in his opinion,
would willingly accord to the President
a day or two for its consideration. The
Indications seem to be tTiat the report
will be made -Ã¼blic by the middle of
the present week.
The presence of Charles R. Flint at
the conference naturally gives in
ference that the President and his ad
visers are discussing the question of ac
quiring additional ships. Mr. Flint
whose commercial interests are largely
with South American countries, is be
lieved in a measure at least to repre
sent Chile and Argentina in negotia
tions which are under way for the dis
position of their war vessels. A re
porter to-day asked Mr. Flint if he
could say wether or not the United
States had secured possession of the
Chilean ship O'Higgins and the Argen
tine ship San Martino, but he declined
to make any statement as to the par
ticular feature of the subject. When
pressed for information in regard to the
matter he replied: "Both Chile and the
Argentine Republic have the warmest
friendship and admiration for the
United States and her institutions.
Neither country is anxious to sell its
ships to this Government, basing the
Indisposition on the belief that we have
an excellent navy of our own. They
want these vessels themselves. If the
time should come, however, when it
was apparent that the United States
needed these vessels they would gladly
part with them to us."
The attention of Mr. Flint was called
to the published report that the United
States would purchase the Brazilian
torpedo boat Tuby, but he said it was
not done so far as he was aware, as
there were no negotiations under way
to that effect.
Aside from the meeting of several
members of the Cabinet at the White
House there were no incidents of im
portance during the day. Judge Day,
Assistant Secretary Adee, Chief Clerk
Michael and other officials were at the
department, but this has been quite
common during the recent month. Also
at the War and Navy Departments a
number of the chiefs of bureau were
at the-ir desks for several hours, mainly
for the purpose of disposing of the busi
ness which recently has accumulated so
rapidly.
The most interesting topic of the day
was based on the dispatches from Ha
vana, indicating a prospective confer
ence between General Pando and Gen
erals Garcia and Gomez and others of
the insurgent army for the purpose of
submitting to the latter a formal offer
of autonomy. The basis of autonomy
as outlined in the dispatches apparently
found no credence with the officials of
the Spanish legation. They stated their
disbelief that a conference on the pro
posed lines was probable and added
that they had no information on the
subject. Minister Polo y Bernabe ex
pressed the opinion that the report
from Havana was unfounded as he said
the basis upon which it was proposed to
grant antonomy was absurd.

NEW YORK, March 20.â Over 400
people arose simultaneously to-night in
the Metropolitan Opera-house and
joined with the chorus on the stage
In the singing of "The Star Spangled
Banner," with more enthusiasm than
has been exhibited in the opera-house
for many months. It was upon the oc
casion of the performance for the bene
fit of the Maine monument fund.
On the great stage stood the well
known opera singer, Camille D'Arvllle,
and behind her were massed the com
bined choruses of the Broadway
Theater, the Casino and the Whitney
and the Madison-Square Theaters. In
the background an immense American
flag waved from a tall pole. Each, of
the singers carried a small flag and the
moment the patriotic air was started
the entire audience arose in their places
and joined in the melody. At the con
clusion there were tremendous cheers
and a great demonstration. Then "My
Country" was sung.
The entertainment, aside from the
subscriptions, netted about $12,000.
Many of the best-known actors and
actresses took part in the performance,
and among the spectators was Miss
Evangelina Cisneros, who came in for
much applause at one time in the even-
Ing.

HAVANA, March 20.â Little work
was done on the wreck of the Maine
to-day by the divers or contractors.
The city has been quiet after the fes
tivities of last night, lasting till nearly
morning at the Tacon Theater, where
a dramatic representation was given
in aid of the fund of the Spanish navy.
There was plenty of enthusiasm in the
crowded theater. Every patriotic sen
timent was cheered to the echo, but
there were no sensational features. The
proceeds are not all in yet, but it is be
lieved that they will amount to be
tween $30,000 and $40,000 in gold. For
mer estimates were too large. Even
with the enormous prices paid for the
boxes and seats it was impossible to
get any such receipts as $80,000 or $100,
1)00, as was hoped by some.
The Austrian cruiser Donau, which
left for New York last evening, is not
expected to reach her destination for
a week or two, as she is slow, even
with auxiliary sail power.
The Red Cross Society of America
having decided to devote itself hence
forth in Cuba to hospital, asylum and
kindred work, Dr. Egan prefers not to
serve on the general committee. The
distribution relief committee now con
sists of Consul-General Lee, Dr. R.
Guzman, representing the Cuban com
mittee, and J. L. Vanderwater, secre
tary of the Western Railway of Cuba,
representing the American contrib
utors. General Lee will act as arbi
trator in the event of a difference of
opinion between the other two mem
bers.
The food on hand will afford relief
to all the needy in the island for a
week or more, and additional supplies
are afloat. Relief has been sent to 134
central pionts, from which 462 towns
and villages have been supplied. Corn
meal is the principal ration, as being
good food for the really hungry, but
not likely to tempt beggars or the un
worthy. Besides there is no difficulty
in getting it through the customs
quickly.
Special Commissioner Klopsch has
appointed three men to travel con
stantly through the island to verify the
count of the needy, to see that the sup
plies are properly received and handled,
to prevent fraud and generally to assist
in the work of distribution. The latest
total reported to Mr. Klopsch is 205,000
necessitous cases.
If the Government will sanction the
arrangement a large building in the
suburb of Guananbacoa, where the
j Alfonso XIII regiment is now quar
| tered, will be rented by the relief com
j mittee. Several hundred reconcen
trados have just been set to work at
cultivating ten acres of ground sur
j rounding the building, thus contrib
uting to their own support. The plan
is experimental, and, if successful, is
capable of extensive development else
where.
WILEY HOLDS TO THE
ACCIDENT THEORY.
Captain of tne Wrecking Tug Under-
writer Talks of the Maine
Disaster.
WASHINGTON, March 20.â A special
to the Post from Newport News says:
The Merritt wrecking tug Underwriter
arrrived in port at midnight last night
from Havana, whither she went with
the derrick Chief, which is assisting in
the work on the Maine. Captain Wiley
believes that the Maine was destroyed
through the agency of an internal ex
plosion. In an interview he said:
"When I reached Havana, I con
versed with Captain Sharp, Merritt's
expert, in charge of the wreck, but
could not learn anything about the re
sult of his personal investigation.
While at Havana I heard no opinions
as to the cause, and it seemed to me
as if the affair was a nine days' won
der blown over. Without having had
an opportunity to examine the wreck
below the water line, I would say that
the Maine was blown up by an internal
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 21, 1898 c
REPORT OF THE COURT ON
THE WAY TO WASHINGTON.
KEY WEST, Fla., March 20.â The report of the Maine Court of Inquiry
is now on its way to Washington. This important news has been conveyed to
me from a source that cannot be doubted. The report is in charge of Captain A.
S. Barker, U. S. N. f who arrived here on Friday.
Captain Barker formerly commanded the battleship Oregon, and his ap
pearance here excited much comment, but no hint was given as to the purpose of
his visit. He was closeted with Admiral Sicard during the morning hours and in
the afternoon went out to the battleship lowa, which flies the pennant of Cap
tain Sampson, president of the court, and in whose cabin the court has been
holding sessions.
Captain Barker returned at 9 o'clock last night, and half an hour later was
steaming away for Tampa on board the steamship Olivette. I am positively as
sured, and have no reason to doubt the assurance, that he took with him the re
port of the Court of Inquiry. He should reach Washington on Tuesday morning.

explosion. It is the most confused pile
of distorted metal imaginable. There
Is one deck above water which is
turned completely over by the explo
sion. The deck is bottom side up, with
the deck frame on top. That looks to
me as if the destructive force came
from within. If a mine did the work
and played so much havoc with the up
per deck, where must the bottom be?
Can she have any? Yet, they say they
have found some of the bottom intact.
My opinion is that if the affair had oc
curred in an English harbor, say
Kingston, Jamajoa. there would not be
one man in a hundred who would say
the cause was external after looking
at that wreck as it is to-day. I heard
that the Spanish divers found a piece
of the forward turret. I do not believe
a mine in tne harbor would have
broken the turret, while an internal
explosion would."

CONSIDERS SPAIN
A VERY WEAK FOE
LONDON, March 21. â The Daily Mail this morning, in an editorial refuting "some of
the American accusations of British coldness," says:
Among many reasons for Great Britain's comparative non-interest, not the least is our
better knowledge of the Spaniards and their paper navy and our conviction that the Anglo-
Saxon will always defeat the Latin, jndeed, the trend of British thought is toward surprise
that the greatest of republics should excite itself unduly about so poor a foe.
The Americans should remember that, while we are full of trust in their capability to
deal with Spanish impertinences, we are fully occupied with a greater trouble threatened or
active in various parts of the world. They have our full sympathy at a time when France,
Germany and Russia are backing Spain as fully and almost as openly as they are opposing
British efforts for th^freedom of foreign trade throughout the world.
But there is no occasion now to talk of an offensive and defensive alliance. The dis
proportion between our mission and America's makes it impossible. There will be time to
propose this way of re-cementing the race when America is ready to face the splendid responsi
bilities it entails.

The Policy of the Administra

However, There Is a Prospect of
Report on the Maine Disaster Â«nd
a Presidential Message.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 20.
Whether the report of the Naval
Board of Inquiry on the Maine disas
ter goes to Congress this week with a
special message from the President,
caJling for Congressional action, rela
tions with Spain and the proximity of
war, as viewed from the standpoint of
emergency preparations now going on
to place the country in a state of de
fense, probably will be exhaustively
debated in the House In connection
with the naval appropriation bill, the
consideration of which will begin on
Tuesday. The emergency items in the i
bill, the large increase in the enlisted
force, the liberal provision for battle
ships, torpedo boats and drydocks, will
bring the whole subject for the neces
sity for these preparations directly be
fore the House.
While the conservative leaders,
doubtless, will seek to prevent innam- !
matory expressions under the recent j
ruling of the Speaker, which practi
cally places no limit upon the latitude
of debate in committee on the whole
on the state of the Union, the leaders,
except by their example, probably will
be unable to repress sensational j
speeches. An effort is likely upon the
part of some of the radicals to force
from those in confidence of the admin
istration a declaration of the policy of
the administration regarding Cuba,
This they hope to do by taunting them
with some of the rumors which have
been floating about, in the newspapers |
during the past few Cays. Altogether
it is likely there will be a general ex
pression of the sentiment in the House
on this question before the bill is pass
ed. Should the President transmit the
report of the Board of Inquiry with a ;
request for Congressional action dur- |
ing the week, everything else will give |
way to it. Any action that might be
decided upon would be in the complete
control of the Republican leaders, as
to the limit to be put upon debate. If
the report of the board does not go to
Congress this week the naval oill will
probably consume all the time after to
morrow. But if it should be passed be
fore Saturday, which seems unlikely,
the bill for the reorganization of the
army and authorization for recruiting
it to* a footing aggregating 104.000 men
in time of war. will be taken up.
To-morrow the bill for the relief of
the victims of the Maine will be called
up immediately after the reading of the
journal, under the arrangement made
last week. It is not expected to con
sume much time, but probably will be
made the occasion for several patriotic
speeches in eulogy of the heroism of
the sailors who went down to their
tragic death. The rest of the day will
be occupied in the consideration of pri
vate bills in pursuance of the order of
last Friday. Altogether, it promises to
be an exceedingly eventful, if not sen
sational, week in the House.
No programme has been prepared for
the Senate for the present week, and
the course <>f events is liable to be in
fluenced largely by developments from
the outside.
The quarantine bill is the unfinished
business on the Senate calendar, and
if opportunity offers Senator Pettigrew
will get up his public land bill. It is
expected the sundry civil appropriation
bill will be reported Wednesday or
Thursday, and if it should be it may be
taken up later in the week. The Senate
committee is making many changes in
this bill and it will consume several

THEJRUTH !
The poor mortals who know
in their innermost hearts that
they are not men in the best
sense of the word get dis-
heartened because they are
often given to understand t
that their cases are incurable ,
when they are not. It is true
that nothing except that
grand remedio - treatment,
"Hudyan," is infallible, but
that really seems to be equal
to all cases. Xot only is life,
vitality, strength and vigor
restored by it, but it corrects
all results of the abuses of
nature's great functions
which erring mortals are sub'
ject to. It corrects them un-
failingly ; it replaces the
strength that has been lost; *
it makes life again worth
living. It does this always.
It has done it for nearly
15,000 people on this coast.

about it ? Ask for
THE TRUTH !
The Hudsonian doctors give their
advice free, and they willingly send
circulars showing what wonders the
"30-day blood cure" has accom-
plished. It is as swift as safe. It

Special Disratch to The Call.
EL, PASO, Texas, March 20.â The no
torious Black Jack gang, which has
terrorized the New Mexico and Ari
zona border for years, is a thing of the
past, the entire band having been
wiped out by the vigilantes of the Mor
mon colony, near Casas Grandes, Mex.,
last Monday morning. The gang, which
had been robbing trains and looting
towns for several years, was driven
into Mexico a few months ago, after
holding up a train on the Santa Fe Pa
cific at Grant Station, New Mexico.
The United States authorities have
since sent two expeditions across the
border after the outlaws, but were un
able to locate their hiding place.
The crime which brought death to
the entire gang was the murder on
February 23 of Mrs. A. F. McDonald,
a member of the Mormon colony at
Round Valley, about fifty miles from
Casas Grandes, in the Sierra Madre
Mountains. Two members of the gang
murdered the old woman, chopping her
head open with a hatchet and then
looting her store.
The crime aroused the community,
and the Avenging Angels, as the vigi
lantes call themselves, after keeping
the trail two weeks, located the head
quarters of the band at an almost in
accessible point In the mountains near
ly fifty miles from the scene of the
crime. They surrounded the camp of
the desperadoes, and at daylight began
firing from points of concealment, not
ceasing until the last of the gang, nine
in number, had been slain. Their bodies
were discovered next day by a party
of American prospectors, who after
ward learned from the Mormons the
Btory of the killing. They brought the
news to Casas Grandes to-day.
Black Jack's gang twice held up
trains of the Santa Fe Pacific at Grant
Station, the last hold-up being about
live months ago, when it was reported
the robbers obtained about $30,000. The
f-iine RaT'gr looted the town of Solo
monviTle, two years ago, and killed the
postmaster, and also held up a Santa
Fe Pacific train at Rio Puerco. where
one member of the gang was killed.
Many other crimes at various points
in the Southwest are attributed to
there murderers, who were the bold
.=t and the most successful operating
Â«the Southwest in recent years.
h"n hard pressed the gang always
succeeded in making its escape across
the border and hiding in the Sierra
Madre Mpuntains, which until recenly
had never been occupied by whites.
ENGLAND BUYING ALL

Even Sends Vessels to Intercept Col-

TACOMA, March 20.â Officers of the
Korth#n Pacific steamship Victoria,
which arrived last night from China
and Japan, report that the British Gov
ernment is massing a very powerful
fleet of -warships in Chinese waters and
that the British are buying all the coal
coming to those waters for their men
of-war. So anxious are they to get It
that they send vessels to sea. and there
halt colliers and bargain for their car
goes, paying gilt-edged prices if neces
sary. The British are said to be buying
all the available coal from the Suez ca
nal to the northern coast of Siberia, as
they do not want to use Japanese coal.
Purser McDonald says there are now
thirty-five or forty British war ships on
the China station, and the fleet has
been considerably augmented during
the last few weeks. Among the latest
arrivals was the big n.arine fighter

FORGED THE
NAME OF HIS
OWN FATHER
Theodore G. Eilers of
Sacramento a
Criminal.
Squandered a Fortune and
Then Robbed His
Parent.
Belief That His Employers
Also Are Among His
Victims.
THEY ARE INVESTIGATING
Disastrous Speculations Thought to
Have Caused the Young Man's
â¢ Downfall.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 20.â Theodore
j G. Eilers, a prominent young business
; man and native son, has gone wrong.
Eilers was a peculiar young man
among his fellows. He was so exem
plary in respect to frugality that he
was regarded as extremely parsimoni
ous. He had none of the evil habits
that pursue the shiftless or the gay.
But Theodore Eilers spent money as if
j it were water that he was pouring out
jto quench the thirsty earth. How he
spent it nobody seems to know exactly,
but it is suspected that he has been
secretly engaging in disastrous specu
! lation in the pool rooms, in the wheat
' pit of San Francisco or in other vent
i ures that open themselves invitingly to
! the speculatively disposed.
Eilers lost about all that he possessed
in his own right without confiding to
anybody the secret of its disposal. All
| the while he maintained his outward
habit of economy and neither his fa
ther, D. W. Eilers, nor his business as
sociates suspected that he was treading
the path that has led so many to ruin
and disgrace.
His own fortune exhausted, Theo
dore looked about for a chance to re
trieve himself. He was engaged in a
prosperous business and could not ask
for financial accommodation without
betraying the secret that was weighing
him down. First he drew a few hun
dred dollars on his father's name,
which he forged. That sum went along
with the rest and another check was
forged and another and so on. It is
â  said that this continued until the bank
! sent to D. W. Eilers notice that his
cash balance was running low. The
father went to the bank, examined the
checks and at once pronounced them
forgeries. For the first time he realised
the terrible truth. He had been robbed
by his son.
The bank was paid in full and Theo
! dore was thus saved from the peniten-
I tiary. It is reported that checks were
j not the only instruments utilized to raise
money on the forged signature of the
father, but that notes were realized
upon.
The firm of Neal**, Eilers & Co. Is not
yet able to say whether or not Theo
dore appropriated any of Its funds.
An investigation is being made.
No one feels authorized to give an es
i timate of the total of the young man's
pllferings. but it is stated that $8000
would hardly cover the known short
ages. He is believed to be In San
Francisco at present and no one seems
to know anything of his future plans,
if he has any. It is likely that he will
be brought back to stand trial.
PASTURAGE OPEN TO
STARVING STOCK.
Herds of Cattle May Be Driven Into
the Public Reservations and
Parks.
STOCKTON, March 20.â -In view of the
reported distress of herds in various parts
of the State, a statement by J. "Walter
Smith, register of the Vnited States Land
Office at this point, is of general interest.
Mr. Smith says:
"Considering the dry season and the
lack of feed for stock, it might be well
for owners of cattle to remember that
under an ord^r Issued in 1594 the Govern
ment allows the pasturing of any stock
except sheep in this State, on the public
reservations. Including parks. There are
about 5,000,000 acres of land in these reser
vations in California."
The McCormick Bros., local men hav
ing large stock Interests, expect to have
to lease new pasturage for their stock,
as their pasturage south of the San Joa
quin la giving out.

MUSICAL PRODIGY
UNKNOWN TO FAME
Little Uda Waldrop of Visalia Ex
cels Great Artists, Though He
Uses No Notes.
VISALIA, March 19.â Very quietly, and with no desire, evidently,
to tread the courts of fame there lives In this town a musical prod
igy, a small boy by the name of Uda Waldfop.
Uda was born at Berryville, near Ltitle Rock, Arkansas, thirteen
years ago. He never saw a musical instrument until he was 3 years of
age, when he chanced to be in a room containing a piano. The wee
baby toddled up to the instrument, put his dimpled hands on the keys
and actually played a little, although he was not tall enough to see the
keys.
He began improvising little tunes of his own when he was about
5 years old. Even at that tender age he produced harmony that was
excelled by few adults. He amazed all who heard him. He could fol
low all the modulations of every air he heard played, and his harmony
was almost faultless.
When the boy was between 5 and 6 years old his parents moved
from Arkansas to Oregon, and while in his 6th year he acted as prin
cipal performer in a music booth in Portland for a large firm of that
city. It was there that Liberatti, the noted Italian band leader, first
heard Uda sing and play. He thought at first that the big pipe or
gan before which the tiny boy was seated was being operated by ma
chinery. He could hardly believe the child had created the wonderful
strains of music to which he had listened. But- when he did become
convinced he offered Uda's father a tempting price for the boy's ser
vices on a continental tour as a soloist. The father refused to part
with his boy, although Liberatti promised to give him a thorough edu
cation in music.
Soon after this the family spent about two years touring the
Northwestern States, giving concerts in all the larger cities. Several
times during this tour Uda gave piano recitals in the presence of men
and women eminent in the profession of music, and they all declared
that he was a wonder. They admitted fhey could not produce such
harmony even with the notes before them, yet this child, in his sixth
year, played without any written music whatever.
Perhaps the strangest feature of this boy's talent is that it Is not
inherited. Neither his father nor his mother was musically inclined,
either vocally or instrumentally. He has always had a wonderful
jiow.-r of reproducing any musical selection he once hears. Ue plays
without the least apparent trouble in such keys as A flat. D-flat and
G flat, transposing even in the midst of a strain without the least per
ceptible confusion.
He delights in playing "Cavalleria Rusticana," "The Holy City,"
and various selections from Wagner, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mozart. Beet
hoven and others of the great masters, producing harmony according
to his own ideas in each selection, and competent critics have pro
nounced his harmony inferior to none. His counter melodies are an
other Important feature of his playing.
Uda has never accustomed himself to play in any special key. He
can make music on almost any kind of instrument, but the piano 13
his favorite. And he can play as well blindfolded as with his eyes wide
open.
Yet this boy does not know one note of written music from an
other, and has never taken a lesson in music In his life.
When Uda was about 10 years old his family moved from Oregon
to Healdsburg, in this State, where his father Is still a prominent
Baptist preacher. His mother died not long ago, and he is now living
with his sister, Mrs. Louis Beyer, In Visalia. He is very modest and
unassuming, and does not seem to realize that his musical talent is out
of the ordinary.

The department of publicity has just
received the architects' drawings of the
Minnesota building, the Montana build

CLOSES A BIG
DEAL IN WHEAT
San Francisco Firm Buys
Seventy-Five Thou
sand Sacks.
Purchase Price as High as
$1 4O for a Portion of the
Consignment.
Other Extensive Sales Made at Stock
ton Within the Past Two
Weeks.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, March 20.â The bi^gost
wheat sale of the season was consum
mated here yesterday, when Woods
Bros., well-known island farmers,
parted with about 75.000 sacks, the
consideration aggregating $115 000.
There were several grades, and it is
$1 37% to $1 40. The purchasers of this
lot were Balfour, Guttorie & Co. The
larger portion of the grain is in ware
houses in this city, and has been storid
for sometime.
Negotiations for the sale of the
wheat have been under way for some
time. McNear and several big deal
ers have been bidding on the lot. It is
understood that a better offer was
made ten days ago, but was not ac
cepted, in hope of improved mark-it
conditions.
Several big lots changed hands in
the past two weeks, but no announce
ment was made until yesterday. , The
mills have been increasing their supply
very quietly at daily quotations. They
paid $1 45 for best milling yesterday,
and had a particularly choice sample
of milling wheat submitted for a fifty
ton lot, the owner of which would
probably have realized $1 464 for it.

MILITARY AWAITS ORDERS
Colonel Anderson Wishes to Delay
Action Until the Maine Affair
Is Settled.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DYEA, March 14.â (Via Seattle,
March 20.)â Collector Ivey yesterday
called upon Colonel Anderson, who Is
in command of the four companies of
infantry here, and a; d if the com
mand could. support him by sending
troops with bonded goods across the
summit as far as Lake Bennett. He
explained that when a convoy was sent
out by the Skaguay Inspector of Cus
toms with goods bonded through
American territory, the convoy's papers
read to Lake Bennett, but at the sum
mit of the White Pass the convoy was
told by the Canadian customs officers
that he could not proceed further as
convoy, tout might go on to Lake Ben
nett, if he wished, "for the fun of the
thing."
Colonel Anderson believes the Ameri
can Government would take action in
regard to the encroachment of the
Canadians were it not so engrossed
with the Maine affair, and under those
circumstances he is averse to precipi
tating trouble b- hasty action. Colonel
Anderson, as commander of the dis
trict, has been given large discretion
ary powers, and is the sort of man who
is likely to use and is capable of using
them.
He to-day issued a notice to the peo
ple of Dyea and Skaguay that they
must observe certain health conditions
he set forth. He said that although he
did not wish to interfere in such mat
ters where it could be avoided he
should take care that his suggestions
were enforced. This is in reality a
warning that this has been made a
military district and military law will
be put into force at any time at the
discretion of the commander.
Three men have been arrested for the
shooting of Samuel Roberts, whose real
name is Samuel Ross, the gambler. A
half-hour after the shooting a man
named Corbett went to a doctor to have
Â«. bullet extracted. This led to his ar
rest. Then a man named Kelly went to
the Marshal and said he shot Corbett.
He also was arrested.
Two partners at Sheep Camp quar
reled this morning over the division of
their outfit and one, Gottlieb Schneider,
shot Frank Clements of Hillsboro, Or.,
through the body. Clements is not
likely to recover.
It is rumored that John L. Smith.
United States Commissioner, has re
signed. Many charges had been made
against him.
MINER AT SKAGUAY
KILLED BY A WOMAN.
Attacks a Negress in Her Cabin and
Receives a Fatal Bullet
Wound.
SEATTLE, March 20.â Two steam
shipsâthe Al-Ki and the Huenemeâ
arrived to-day from Skaguay. On the
afternoon of the 12th. on the up-trip,
Captain Melntosh reports fire broke out
in the hold of the Hueneme. The ves
sel had just docked at Fort Wrangel
when flames were seen to shoot out.
The officers were unable to get into the
forward hold on account of the heat
and smoke. Water was turned on, but
without success. Finally the fire w;is
<-xtinguished by turning steam into the
hold. There was no excitement a.mong
the passengers and all speak highly of
the prompt and efficient work of the
officers and crew. Very little damage
was done to the steamship, but outfits
were damaged to the value of nearly
$6000. The fire originated through tho
igniting of some matches among the
outfits.
The officers of the Al-Ki report the
fourth fatal shooting at Skaguay with
in two weeks. On Sunday evening a
prospective miner, whose name is not
remembered, visited a colored woman's
cabin and after leaving found that his
watch had disappeared. He returned
and accused the woman of having
stolen it. She denied the charge and he
used abusive language to such an ex
tent that she fled from her cabin. The
miner pursued her and was in the act
of choking her when a white woman
came upon the scene with a gun in her
The miner was induced to depart, but
said that he would get his revolver and
then there would be some fun. He poop
returned to the colored woman's cabin
and resumed the quarrel. Finally the
woman drew a revolver and shot her
assailant. He died before morning.
She claims that she killed him in self
defense. Federal officers took her in
charge, but when the Al-Ki left the
generai opinion prevailed that the wo
man would easily be cleared of any in
tent to do injury.
ALMOST A LYNCHING
AT SHEEP CAMP.
Maryland Argonaut Barely Escapes
a Mob After Slaying His
Partner.
DTEA, Alaska (via Astoria, Or.),
March 20.â Frank Clement of Hills
boro, Oregon, was shot and killed at
Sheep Camp this morning by Gottlieb
Schneider of Howard County, Mary
land. A lynching was averted only
by the prompt action of the officers
In getting the murderer out of the
way. He is now in jail at this place.
Clement lived several hours, but failed
to give an account of the quarrel.
Schneider's story is as follows:
"I met Clement coming up on the
steamship Elder in February and saw
him once here and in Dyea after
ward. Several days after we got
here Clement came to me and said that
his partner had decided to go back
and he wanted me to buy the outfit and
go to Dawson with him. I told him
that I had nothing with which to buy
it. JÂ£e then told me he had enough
money to buy out his partner, and if I
would go along with him he would sell
the outfit and let me pay for it after
we got to Dawson. I finally agreed to
this and we drew up an agreement in
German and each took a copy. In the
first two weeks we got some of the
stuff up to Sheep Camp and some to
Scales. By that time I found out that
Clement would start a quarrel every
chance he had. We were camped at
Sheep Camp, a short distance below the
power-house.
"One day, the weather was very bad
and it was snowing so fast we cou.ld
not see. Clement wanted me to but
ton up his coat, but I could not see
to do it. He became very mad and
cursed me and again that night, after
we retired in the tent, he cursed me.
The next morning, as I was getting
breakfast, he told me to get out. I
told him I would do so if he would
pay me for what packing I had done.
Yesterday we had another quarrel and
in the evening I was sleeping in the
tent, when Clement came in and yelled
at me:
" 'Stop that snoring, or I'll cut your
throat.'
"I said nothing, but did not go to
sleep, being afraid he would carry out
his threat. This morning I was cook
ing breakfast, when he came in and
said he was going to divide some of
the flour we had bought together and
then sell the other outfit. I told him
he had already sold it to me, but he
said, 'Yes, when you have paid for it.'
I told him I wanted what was fair for
my work. He said, 'To with your
work.' I grabbed him and he reached
around and got a knife and said he
would cut my heart out. I reached
for my revolver and cocked it, and
holding my thumb so that the ham
mer, which would not stay up alone,
would not drop. Clement hit my hand
and knocked my thumb off. which dis
charged the gun. He ran outside,
crying that he had been shot, and I
went out and gave myself up to the
officers." .
Schneider was surrounded by the
mob and threats were made of hang
ing him, but he was gotten away be
fore the threat was put into execu
tion.
CANADIAN CUSTOMS KTTLES.
WASHINGTON, March 20.â The De
partment of State is informed by the
United States Consul-General at Ot
tawa, Ont., that the same duties are
imposed on goods destined for the
Klondike region as are imposed on
goods imported into any other part of
Canada. The instructions to the Can
adian customs officers are as follows:
Wearing apparel, articles of personal
adornment, toilet articles and similar
personal effects of persons arriving in
Canada, to be passed free, without en
try at customs as traveler's baggage,
under the provision of the customs
tariff; but this provision shall include
only such articles as actually accom
pany and are in the use of and neces
sary and appropriate for the immediate
purpose of the journey and present
comfort and convenience and shall not
be held to apply to merchandise or ar
ticles intended for other persons or for
sale.
In the absence of rulings by the board '
of customs as to articles included in the i
foregoing regulation, customs officers â 
at the port of entry are to decide the j
class and quantity of the wearing ap- ;
parel and like articles in use entitled
to pass free under the foregoing pro- |
vision, having due regard to the length j
of the journey and to the reasonable !
requirements of the traveler for his
comfort and convenience of the jour
ney. Articles of personal adornment, |
however, may be held to include one j
watch and the jewelry ordinarily in
use by the traveler.

MUSKOGEE, I. T. ( March 20.â A das
tardly outrage was committed last
night near the town of Wybark, five
miles north of here, resulting in the
death of two men and a woman. The
house of Ed Chalmers, a negro who
recently married a white woman, waa
attacked during the night by six white
men, who had evidently determined to
murder both the negro and his wif^
both of whom had been threatened b^
white men who disliked the union. A
door of their cabin was broken in and
both the negro and his wife were shot
down, but not before Chalmers had put
up a good fight against his assailants.
The woman was killed outright, and
although Chalmers succeeded in driv
ing off the attacking party, they left
him mortally wounded and he died be
fore daylight.
This morning the body of Matthews,
an aged white man who lived at Gib
son station, was found near the
Chalmers cabin pierced by a bullet.
Matthews answers the description
given by Chalmers before he died of
one of his assailants. There were evi
dences that Matthews' body had been
dragged from Chalmers' house to the
place where it was found. A gun lay
beside the body, evidently put there
to give the impression that the dead
man had murdered the negro and his
wife.
Deputy United States Marshals arÂ«

CLEARER COMMERCIAL SKIES.
THE business situation is better than a week ago.
At that time it was marked by a pronounced un
certainty, susceptible of development in almost
any direction, favorable or unfavorable. But since
then the sky has cleared again and it is now seen that
the immense war preparations all over the country
were the sole cause of the temporary unsteadiness.
The wonder is that the disturbance was not greater.
True, Wall street continues to show varying moods
as the Cuban situation clouds or clears, but the rest
of the country has again settled down to business and
things are going on as usual.
Commercial reports from New York show that the
backbone of the situation is the excess of merchandise
exports, more than $41,000,000 in February, with an
increase of $2,200,000 in miscellaneous products.
$_',ioo,ooo in provisions, $4,500,000 in cotton and
5r.000.000 in breadstuffs, compared with last year, and
$15,000,000 in all products. In two weeks in March
exports have been 16 per cent larger than last year
and imports have gained but 8.7 per cent. The outgo
of cotton surpasses all expectations, though the price
was stronger last week, and the export demand ap
parently paid no attention to market fluctuations.
In the last issue of Bradstreet's appears a table of
comparative prices of 108 staple articles, raw and
manufactured, showing fluctuations from April I,
1595. to March 4, 1898. From this showing it is
learned more than half the articles mentioned ad
vanced in February and only fifteen actually declined.
Compared with low water mark in July last 24 out
of the 108 are lower in prices, but the decreases were
in: important and in some cases due to climatic in
fluence.
In fact, the aspect of affairs is decidedly bullish all
over the country. AÂ» one trade authority tersely
puts it, "neither peace nor war reports have changed
the onward current of business." The financial situa
tion is distinguished by orders for more than $25,
500,000 from Europe, which effectually check any
tendency toward monetary stringency, while treasury
receipts of over $1,000,000 per day keep the currency
supply fully up to all probable needs. Wheat also
moves in spite of all speculation. Atlantic exports,
flour included, have been 1,824,569 bushels, against
1,253,300 last year, and from Pacific ports 1,371,826
bushels, against 268,505 last year, making for three
weeks from both coasts 10,659,125 bushels, against
4,538,441 last year.
The usual barometers of trade show continued high
pressure all along the line. The bank clearings of
the country last week were 35.4 per cent larger than
for the same week last year. Failures were about the
same in number. Favorable weather has increased
the distribution of goods everywhere, the West and
Korthwest sending in the best reports in this respect.
Navigation has practically opened on the great lakes,
and by the first of April this important branch of na
tional trade, which has been closed during the winter,
will be in full current again. The staples remain
about as they have been for the past few weeks, iron
being active and firm, wool fiat, and dry goods, gro
ceries and other lines of business being in satisfactory
movement everywhere.
On this coast the weather continues to engross at
tention. Light scattering showers in the San Joaquin
Valley have kept the grain crop growing fairly.
though present indications point to only a moderate
yield. Hay and minor cereals continue to advance,
and the stockmen in some districts are worried about
the slim outlook for feed.
Heavy frosts have almost wiped out the apricot
crop and damaged the peaches more or less here and
there, but all other fruits have thus far escaped and
promise good crops. San Francisco is still under a
cloud as to the Alaskan business owing to the rail
road war in the north, but our local bank clearings
still show that we are doing considerably more trade
than at this time last year, so things must be in pretty
good shape after all. There is nothing now in sight
to indicate that we will not have a first-class year,
taking it as a whole.
Aubrey Beardsley's death will be regretted because
he was a brave young fellow with the courage to back
up a ridiculous fad and fool people into the idea that
it possessed merit. As a matter of unromantic fact
the Beardsley style of illustration was an exemplifica
tion of the accuracy with which rank idiocy could be
reduced to a pictorial form.
Professor Wenzell sets forth that other cities burn
gas as dangerous as that furnished to San Francisco.
However, something more than scientific dissertation
is necessary to establish firmly the theory that two
wrongs make a right. This theory has always had
advocates, yet it may be successfully assailed.
Complaint is often made that some people talk too
much, but complaint about the local telephones is
based on the opposite grounds. They do not talk
enough after they have absorbed the nickel supposed
to woo them into a communicative mood.
There seems to be an idea that an American ship
would be in danger if anchored off Havana, but it
would be easy to put enough American ships there
that the danger could be spread so as to not be con
fined to the white navy.
PREPARED FOR PEACE OR WflÃ.
THE report of the Naval Board of Inquiry ap
pointed to inquire into the cause of the disaster
that wrecked the "Maine will soon be in the
hands of the President, and it is reasonable to assume
that he will at once transmit it to the Senate and thus
make known to the people the information they have
so long desired. The period of suspense and waiting
is therefore nearly at an end. In a few days we shall
know all that the Naval Board has discovered and
have a clearer conception whether the controversy
with Spain can be arranged by diplomacy or must be
settled by war.
It has been more than a month since the wreck of
the Maine at Havana startled the country, roused
patriotic sensibilities and stirred the people with
something of the passion of battle. From that mo
ment the great mass of Americans have been ready
at any time to sustain Congress in a declaration of
open hostility against Spain, and Congress in turn
has shown itself ready to uphold the President in any
action he might take to that end. Nothing has
occurred during the month of waiting to diminish or
weaken that feeling. Calm resolution has succeeded
the first burst of wrath, but the calmness of to-day is
even more ominous to Spain than was the fiery indig
nation that raged when the people first had reason to
suspect that the destruction of the Maine was due to
Spanish treachery.
It goes without saying that the same spirit of de
termined resolve which has kept the country free from
any manifestation of undue excitement for all these
weeks will have the same effect on the public mind
during the remaining days of waiting. Ample evi
dence has been given that both Congress and the
President are prepared to maintain the honor of the
republic in whatever way the emergency may demand.
The vote of $50,000,000 for national defense was an
evidence of the swiftness with which the representa
tives of all parties in the country will act together if
war is necessary, and the energy with which the ad
ministration has made use of the money to strengthen
our military and naval force is sufficient proof that
it will show no weakness when the time comes for
decision and action.
With confidence in Congress and in the President
the people wait the result. They will expect to have
the report of the Naval Board made public as soon as
it is received. If it proves to be noncommittal on the
question of Spanish responsibility for the wreck they
will be likely to accept that as a confirmation of their
suspicions that the act was one of treachery. Nothing
will now relieve the war strain but a demonstration in
the report that the Spanish officials were in no wise
concerned in the act, either directly or by their pro
tection of parties guilty of the crime.
As a nation and as a people we are fast losing
patience with Spanish sovereignty and Spanish bar
barism on any part of this hemisphere. If this crime
and its crisis .afford us any rightful ground on which
to demand the freedom of Cuba and atonement for
the wreck of the Maine there can be no question but
that the people of all sections of the Union would
be opposed to any diplomatic arrangement for waiv
ing that right. We are not a nation of jingoes, but
neither are we one of those nations among whom
"the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that honor
feels."
THE SEASON OF FETES OND FLOWERS?
THE season of singing birds and blossoming
orchards has come. The roses, heliotropes and
geraniums, which at all times of the year lift
up their beauty to adorn our gardens, are now at
their best and brightest, while the native wild flowers
bloomii.g on hill and plain vie with them in color and
sweetness and add to the spring a glory which the
other seasons know not. This, therefore, is the time
when the minds of all who are not harassed with
labor turn to thoughts of floral fetes and festivals of
roses.
Already reports of preparations for these entertain
ments come to us from many parts of the State.
Santa Clara County is to lead off with a festival
unique in its nature. This is to be known as a "car
nival of buds and blossoms" and will consist in put
ting the whole county on exhibition and inviting all
the world to come and see it. It is to be no display
in a hall or a pavilion or any building even if it were
big enough to serve for an exposition. When the
orchards bloom every acre of land for miles around
San Jose is a flower show. It is to see this splendor
that the county invites visitors next week. The
guest will not be expected to walk through flowers
.".long aisles hundreds of feet long, but will be taken in
a carriage and driven through blossom-bright
avenues for miles and miles.
After that display the fetes in other portions of the
Sate will follow thick and fast. One of the most
notable of these will be that for which preparations
arc iow being made at San Rafael. That beautiful
home cf wealth and refinement has a host of advan
tages that give it special facilities for entertainments
of this kind. A considerable number of its people
live cf i:tinually in an atmosphere of beauty, joy and
hospitality. It will be for them as natural as breath
ing to make a rose festival as perfect as can be at
tained anywhere on the globe.
F>"Â»r all of these fair things to come we may rejoice
to-day. San Francisco is near enough the center of
the State for her people to visit every fete that come?.
We will see San Jose, San Rafael, Santa Rosa and
all that make merry in the spring. Their hospitality
and their visions of beauty will be our joys, and
thoMcnnds of our people will attest the fullness of our
delight ir such neighbors.
TriE POSTfJL DEFICIT.
WHEN the Loud bill providing a means for
making the postal service self-supporting by
putting an end to the costly abuses which have
grown up in second class mails was defeated The Call
expressed the opinion of the people generally in say
ing that it then behooved the opponents of that
measure to devise some other for getting rid of the
deficit. It was promised at the time that this would
be done by reducing the expenditures for mail trans
portation. That promise has been broken. The
appropriation bill passed by the House on Saturday
afternoon, so far from reducing expenditures, actually
increased them by $1,700,000 over the appropriations
for last year.
This is the result of a difference of opinion among
reformers. It seems clear that a considerable major
ity of the members of both houses of Congress is
in favor of an economical postal service. It is equally
clear that with the practice of economy we could
make the service self-supporting without diminishing
its efficiency. It happens, however, that some of the
reformers desire to effect the economy by restricting
the privilege of second class mail to legitimate news
papers and periodicals issued as frequently as four
times a year, while others are willing to permit abuses
in that class of mail matter to go on and would at
tain a surplus for the postoffice by reducing the
rates paid the railroads for transportation. The friends
of economy being thus divided, both plans have failed.
We have had to make an increased appropriation for
the postoffice at a time when strict economy is im
jiortant, and the chances are that in spite of the in
THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 21, 1898.
crease we shall have as big a deficit a3 ever at the end
of the year.
The deficit In our postal revenues is the more
aggravating because the postofnee service in Great
Britain, France and Germany is not only self-support
ing, but actually yields a surplus. We could have
equally good results if our postal affairs were con
ducted on anything like a similar basis. The letter
postage and first class mail matter generally yields
us a handsome revenue. The surplus which is plied
up by that class of mail, however, is swallowed up by
the cost of handling tons of 6tuff at rates that do not
pay the cost of handling. The only two plans for
remedying the evil which have had any strong 6up
port in Congress have just been voted down one after
another. The deficit averages about $11,000,0001 1,000,000 a
year, and It seems likely to stay with U3.
POOLROOMS AND OPIUM JOINTS.
DURING the past week The Call exposed the
extent to which opium joints and poolrooms
are being conducted in this city. The exposure
showed that the two evils are carried on with a de
gree of defiant publicity which constitutes not onl/
a scandal to our laws, but a serious menace to all men
and women who by reason of any mental or moral
weakness are liable to be enticed to ruin either by
the gambling mania or a desire for opium.
On our statute books there are laws against each
of these evils, but the laws are not enforced. The
police know of the existence of the poolrooms and
opium dens. They know where these places are, they
know the persons who maintain them and they know
also a considerable number of those who attend them.
Knowing all these things they make no arrests be
cause, as they claim, long experience has shown that
it is impossible to obtain convictions. In other words
according to the police the laws are inefficient or the
courts are inefficient to deal with either the dope
fiends or the poolroom fiends.
So far as the opium dens are concerned it seems
clear that the defect is in the law, which requires for
conviction a degree and kind of proof that cannot be
obtained. So long as all persons arrested for main
taining an opium joint or resorting to one for opium
smoking have to be tried under the State law there
can be hardly any convictions. The only chance
for suppressing this evil before the assembling
of the Legislature gives a chance for an
amendment to the law lies in the suggestion
made by Attorney Drury, that if a test case were car
ried* to the Supreme Court that tribunal would hold
that such offenders could be tried for violating the
city ordinance. This course should be followed. The
test case should be raised at once and the issue deter
mined.
As for the poolroom keepers, their immunity seems
to be dependent upon the juries that try them. The
law on the subject is sound enough and the police
have in the past made many arrests, but convictions
are about as rare for this offense as for that of running
an opium joint. This view of the subject carries the
source of the evil one step further back and raises the
question of reform in the police court jury system.
Assistant District Attorney Black, who agrees with
the police that the failure to suppress poolrooms in
the city is due to the juries before whom the arrested
pool-sellers are tried, said in an interview published
in The Call on Saturday: "If the Police Courts acted
as they do in the Superior Courts in regard td the
impaneling of juries better results in bringing law
breakers to justice would prevail. Where an officer
is given the power, as he is in the Police Courts, to
bring any one or anybody for a juror it is hard to
expect that a verdict will be giv.n in accordance with
the evidence, as a friend oi the man on trial can easily
get in the way and be placed on the jury."
In that direction, then, the enforcement of the law
seems to be blocked. Mr. Black says, however, it
would still be worth while for the police to make ar
rests and keep trying to procure convictions. Police
Commissioner Gunst seems equally convinced that
the evil can be suppressed if the fight is kept up. This
policy should be vigorously pursued. Poolrooms in
the city are forbidden by law "nd the police should
arrest all who violate the law even if the courts fail
to convict them.
A PLAY has been received by The Call. It con
sists of one reprehensible act. The author is
Colonel Joseph A. Nunez, who apparently is
not ashamed of being caught in the act, for he sends
the thing with his own compliments. A not unnat
ural impulse would be to wrap it about a brick and
send it back again. Possibly worse plays have been
written, but there is no record of any such event
To attempt to pass upon the merits of the Nunez
soar would be to reach out after the unattainable;
there are no merits excepting the single one of
brevity, and of this there is far too little. Neither
would there be any object in analyzing the creation.
Enough to say that it is entitled "The Fragmented
Maine Shatters Proud Spain." This will be recog
nized at once as poetry. It is not perfect poetry, but
it constitutes the loftiest flight of the whole produc
tion and is so much superior to the play that it ought
to cut loose from a hampering environment and go
sailing adown the centuries on its own hook, claiming
no histrionic value but the glory of being simply the
songlet of a bardlet from away back.
The use of the term "fragmented" is most happy.
It serves to divert the mind. In contemplation of it
there is, it is true, a tendency to hope that the author
and the play may likewise be "fragmented." The
shrewd observer will be so taken with the hope that
a kindly providence will place upon him the task of
doing this that he will immediately drop the pamphlet
and begin looking for a club.
Nunez has gone too far. , When he begins to wietd
the deadly pen a stricken world appeals to him to go
back to his customary and less formidable dynamite.
Perhaps the Gas and Electric Company can set up
the plea for retaining the "voluntary" contributions
it has forced from customers that it wants the money
itself. Any footpad could make a similar plea. .
There is no reason except the kindness of Provi
dence preventing some of the dangling wins which

INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS,
BY A MODEST CRITIC.
The Lame letter about Weyler Is
about the worst attempt to fool the
public deeply Interested In the disas
ter to the Maine that has yet been at
tempted. This piece of news is, of
course, due to the New York Journal.
The Lame confessing himself a pris
oner In Cabanas Fort swears he saw
a couple of tons of dynamite laid in
Havana harbor. Will this class of
nauseating insult to intelligence never
cease? I recommend Mr. Hearst to
employ, at any rate, one news editor
who knows the rudimentary princi
ples of handling explosives. And I
sometimes wonder what the ignoram
uses who concoct these stories Imagine
an electrically connected submarine
mine to be. They are not expected to
know much about the mechanism, but
from matter that has been printed by
the Journal and its miniature, it is evi
dent that they imagine a mine to be
constructed by wheeling a few hundred
sticks of dynamite over the water in a
hand barrow (made buoyant by occult
power) and dumping the load into the
water. One of the assistants at this j
strange seance then plunges his arm
into the water and, lo! electrical con
nection with â anywhere â is made!
Another of the elect (as the work is
done by night) then smells the briny
deep and the position of the mine is
plotted by intuition! The most mar
velous thing to me about it all Is that
anyone can read and digest such crass
nonsense as the Journa/ sees fit to
publish.
The ghost of the Chronicle's strate
gic attache appears ag"in. It is, how
ever, not very painfuJ to have to lay
him anew, as he arises from his inter
ment much like a "Jack-in-the-box,"
for the face amuses, though it be the
same old face. He still squeaks of the
strategic value of the Hawaiian Isl
ands, but this time thusly:
"It has not escaped the notice of the
Senate and the House during the present
war scare that Honolulu is the one weak
point as it stands in the defensive sys
tem of this coast. Spain could not send
a single- modern cruiser under steam
from the Philippines or Carolines to the
neighborhood of the Golden Gate unless
she could coal the ship en route. The
first attempt of the enemy in the Pacific,
therefore, would be to seize Honolulu and
use it as a base of supplies."
Spain would, as she could, coal her
ships en route if we were at war with
her, which we are not and are not
likely to be. If we owned Honolulu,
however, she might possibly, but not
probably, take it and use it as a base,
but will this innocent never see that in
the hands of a neutral power the occu
pation of Hawaii by n enemy is impos-
sible? The independence of the islands
is already guaranteed, and our enemy,
no matter what nation it might be,
that would choose to incur the wrath
of either Germany, Great Britain or
any other first-class power by seizing
an independent State, would wish his
cake dough and even flour. By refus
ing to annex these islands and insist
ing on their independence, we wipe out
a serious menace to the coast. With
the independence of the islands firmly
established all our enemies who desire
to attack this coast are truly robbed
of all but a floating base. Possibly
Captain Mahan will tell me how much
wisdom there is in a strategic move
ment which gives the enemy a clear
chance to obtain a point of If
in the next twenty years we increase
the navy so that we can spare a dozen
ships to protect the group, leprosy be
ing stamped out, the Chinese and Jap
anese having by the grace of the Crea
tor betaken themselves to their native
soil, there might be no such very seri
ous objection to making them a part
of American territory; but to-day it is
evident that we cannot spare the ships;
the leprosy flourishes exceedingly, and
the Orientals are there in their revolt
ing swarms. The Chronicle is placed
in this position by its advocacy of the
annexation of these islands. It is
either willing tha.t they should become
a county of Californ'- or it does not
object to take the risk of the addition
of two Senators to represent a handful
of men. Which is it? There is no pos
sible logical escape from the dilemma,
and it is welcome to which ever horn of
the bull it chooses to grasp. Will that
paper join the Examiner in its out
spoken wish to inosculate this State
with leprosy, if so, the people of Cali
fornia should know that fact. It has
been demonstrated so often that from
any standpoint these islands are worse
than valueless to us that it seems idle
to continue to discuss it, but public
opinion in California should be farther
awakened to what this polluting plan of
annexation actually means.
The purchase by the Government of
cruisers abroad and the evident intent
to move more rapidly in the rebuilding
of the navy draw attention to the
manning of the ships. I opine that
the encouragement of boys to enlist
can scarcely be too strongly urged.
And of course training ships must be
provided. American ships should have,
as far as possible, American hearts on
the mess deck as well as in the ward
room. Our navy is now recruited from
seamen of the various merchant ser
vices of the globe, and that is unwise.
The day of the striking of topmasts in
fighting ships has passed. The most
valuable seamen in the marine branch
of the national service to-day are
those who are capable of properly
serving modern guns. Those who have
had opportunities for fairly consider
ing the matter agree that boys trained
for service in any navy lead lives as
happy, and have prospects quite as
good as those who learn trades in their
various countries. Men of large ex
perience are satisfied that this is a
long way the best plan to get the most
efficient naval force. Naval reserves
may be good, but they axe rarely up
to the necessary standard. The Naval
Reserve which will be created by the
fostering of the building of American
steel steamships will, undoubtedly, be
exceedingly valuable. High class mod
ern vessels make cruisers that will be
quite formidable to anything but a
protected enemy. Those of other na
tions look business like enough when
fitted with guns, and we should pro
ceed to add to the nucleus for a fleet of
this sort we already have in the Paris,
the New York and a few others as rap-
Idly as possible. Congress should begin
to be generous to American shipping.
It has been stunted long enough.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Electricity is being introduced In the
Russian navy for raising ammunition,
loading and working guns on board ships.
Of the 250 torpedo-boats which the naval
programme establishes for the French
navy, 175 will be afloat during the present
year.
The British battle-ship Illustrious has !
passed through her full power trial of
eight hours under natural draught, and |
developed 10,241 horsepower, an excess of
341 horsepower over_the contract.
It is reported Â»that the Japanese have
by this time laid a number of torpedoes
off the Pescadore Islands, near Formosa.
The work was to be done under the su
perintendence of Captain Tasuda of the
Japanese navy.
The British torpedo boat destroyer Vio
let passed through her coal consumption
trials last month. Steaming at the rate
of 13 knots she used one ton of coal to
make a distance of 30 knots. As the boat
carries S4 tons of coal, this supply should
enable her to make 2520 knots at a speed
of 13 knots per hour.
Experiments have been made at Kiel
by German naval officers with a contri
vance regulating the movements of tor
pedoes discharged from a ship. It is
claimed that absolute accuracy of aim
was obtained with a Schwartzkoff tor
pedo up to a distance of 4300 feet, or over
four-fifths of a mile.
The Woodlark, one of the latest built
light draught turbine twin screw gun
boats for service in Egypt, has had a
successful trial. The boat is 145 feet in f
length and Â« feet beam, and was to draw
not over 24 inches with a load of 30 tons,
at which her Speed was to be 15 statute
miles. At her acceptance trial with the
stipulated' load the boat drew 2SV4 inches ;
and made 30% miles in two hours. The hull
is plated with bullet-proof steel plating,
and the Woodlark is now credited with
being the best boat in the British Nile
flotilla.
The British sloop-nf-war Algerine Is at
the prseent time in drydock at Tung-Ka
doo, China, making good the damage she
suffered recently in a collision with a
junk. She has been remarkably unfortu
nate since her first commission on Feb
ruary 11, ISfT. It took her eight uuys to
make Gibraltar from Plymouth, losing
one boat and smashing 1 others. Arriving
on the China station one of her officers
committed suicide, and in November last
she ran aground on the Shanghai flats,
remaining high and dry for some hours.
Still more recently she ran aground
again, carrying away her starboard bilge
keel and ripping off the wood sheathing
on her bottom, and to cap the climax of
misfortunes she afterward collided with
a junk, by which she lost several boats
and was badly damaged about her top
sides and deck. The reparirs will take
several weeks and will cost at least $15.

The experience which the British
cruiser Edgar recently had with a tramp
steamer indicates that it is more difficult
to sink a merchant vessel than a ship of
war. The Edgar fell in with the Eden
moor, a tramp steamer from Newcastle,
bound for an Asiatic port with a cargo of
refined petroleum. The steamer was on
fire fore and aft, and the crew was taken
off with some difficulty. The captain of
tho Edgar concluded to quicken the sink
ing of the doomed steamer and opened a
brisk fire with her quick-firing guns and
an occasional shell from her 9.2-inch gun.
After an hour or so of this gun practice
the Edenmoor evidently became some
what dilapidated and took a gradual list
to port. This was her condition at noon,
and an hour later she was nearly bottom
up. At 2 o'clock the man-of-war's crew
renewed the attack, and after firing sev
enty shots from the 6-inch quick-firing
guns and the 9.2-inch gun the hapless
sn-amer "fluked" and gradually disap
peared stern foremost, sinking in sixty
fathoms. The money expended in firing
shells at this tramp steamer must have
footed up close to $2000. but it was a
practice in gunnery of which the Edgar
was evidently very much in need.

turtles in the Gulf of California.
"I was reading in the papers to-day of
a fashionable wedding that took place
from the Palace Hotel, and it brought to
my mind a wedding- that once came off at
Point Barrow, in the Arctic. A man by
the name of O'Hara had been left in
charge of some bone that was ashore, and
had tak>Mi up with a native woman, with
whom he had been living for some time
when the revenue cutter, with Missionary ,
Sheldon Jackson, the same fellow who
has played the Government for a trip
abroad to procure reindeer when he could
get them on this side at half the expense
and far less trouble, came along.
"Jackson heard of the connection, and
was properly shocked, as became one of
his professed sanctity. 'Captain,' he said
to the vessel's commander, 'this is scan
dalous! It must be stopped. They should
be married.' 'Well, why don't you marry
them?' answered the captain. 'The man
might object,' replied the missionary.
'Object!' exclaimed the commander. 'I'd
like to see any fo-castle son of a tar
bucket object aboard this ship. 'I am the
law here.' Tnen, turning to the quarter
master, 'Send O'Hara aft." That indi
vidual soon appeared, and the captain,
addressing him, said: 'O'Hara, report at
10 o'clock to-morrow with your
woman for marriage directly after
muster.' 'Aye, aye, sor,' answered
the disciplined son of Neptune,
as he saluted. The next morning O'Hara
and his lady love were on hand, but
Jackson refused to perform the ceremony,
as he said the sailor would desert his
wife as soon as he got to civilization.
â¢What has that to do with it?" inquired
the practical captain. 'Would he not do
the same thing if ne was wedded to a
Malay girl in Java or a Chinese at Hong
kong? However, since I have given the
order it must be executed. O'Hara!' 'Vis,
sor!' 'Are you ready?" 'Oi am, sor:'
â¢Salute and consider yourself married,
and lake this plug of navy to begin your
honeymoon on.' O'Hara did as he was
ordered, and the happy couple went over
the side hand in hand.
"The wedding stood, for when O'Harn.
j came down to civilization he took a
; little 2-year-old boy with him, which he
â  now sends to school, and every time the
whalers go north he sends enough to keep
Mrs. O'Hara through the ensuing year. "

This correspondent submitted the follow

a well-known fact that idiots and fools
are never bald. Is that correct?" This
was submitted to Asa Clark, medical su
perintendent of the Stockton State Asy
lum, and he has kindly furnished the fol
lowing answer:
"In my experience with the Insane I
have not found baldheadedness more or
less prevalent than it is met with on on
average outside of the asylum, aod I see
no reason why the growth of hafF should
be interfered with by reason of any form
of insanity present. As far as idiots are
concerned, the saying 'that fools are nev
er Laid' cannot be true, as we have at
present representatives of forms of idi
ocy among whom baldheadedness is pres
ent. As deformities uf the organs of the
nervous system as well as of the body
is generally characteristic of idiocy, one
might meet with a profuse as well as a
scanty growth of hair, though the latter
is more apt to be the case."

Union Square Hall Last Evening the
Scene of an Auction by Girls Â»
and Men.
The Bush Street Temple Bnzaar closed
last night The remaining hours of the
fair were spent raffling; off the various
articles that had not been otherwise dis
posed of. There was a great deal of
amusement over this, as the ladies and
gentleman vied to see which sex was
most fitted to sell goods by means of
auctioneering.
Dr. L,. R. Jacobs amused the people
present by his sleight-of-hand tricks, at
which he is auite an adept Miss 11.
Nathan was also successful as an enter
tainer, and quite captured th..se present
by her dialect and dramatic selections.
Thrs fair has been both a financial and
social sucft-ss, and everybody is sorry
that it has closed.
The holders of the lucky tickets In tho
raffling may find out all about the win
ning numbers and procure their articles
any day at the synagogue between the
hours of 1 and 2.

THE DUTY OF MOTHERS.
Daughters Should be Carefully
Guided in Early "Womanhood.
1
What suffering frequently results
from a mother's ignorance; or more
frequently from a mothers neglect to
properly instruct her daughter 1
Tradition says "woman must suffer,"
and young women are so taught.
There is a little truth and a great deal
of exaggeration in this. If a young
woman suffers severely she needs
treatment and her mother should see
that she gets it.
Many mothers hesitate to take their
daughters to a physician for examina-
tion; but no mother need hesitate to
write freely about her daughter or
herself to Mrs. Pinkham and secure
the most efficient advice without
charge. Mrs. Pinkham's address is
Lynn, Mass. â 
The following letter from Miss Marib
F. Johnson, Centralia, Pa., shows what
neglect will do, and tells how Mrs.
Pinkham helaed her :
"My health became so poor that I
had to leave school. I was tired all the
time, and had dreadful pains in my
side and back. I was also troubled
with irregularity of menses. I was
very weak, and lost so much flesh that
my friends became alarmed. My
mother, who is a firm believer in your
remedies from experience, thought per-
haps they might benefit me, and wrote
yon for advice. I followed the advice
you gave, and used Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound and Liver Pills as
pou directed, and am now as well as I
Â»ver was. I have gained flesh and have
i good color. I am completely cured of
xregularity."
THE FINEST
ARE EXCITED
Promotions Are Looked
For on the First Mon
day in April.
The Resignations of Two Cap
tains and a Lieutenant
Are Expected.
A Sergeant Will Bo Appointed at a
Meeting of the Commissioners
To-Night.
There is considerable speculation in the
Police Department as to who will be ap
pointed sergeant to fill the vacancy
caused by the dismissal of Sergeant
Davis from the force. The appointment
would have been made at the meeting
last Monday night if it had not been for
the absence of Commissioner Alvord,
awing to indisposition.
The appointment will be made at the
meeting of the Commissioners to-night,
and among the names of those mentioned
as likely to secure the desired promo
tion are Policemen Rainsbury, Merrick,
Leonard, Fraher and Al Wright. All
i these men have done excellent service in
the department, and it is conceded that
any one of them would till the bill except
; ably.
The resignation of Lieutenant Bennett
I of the Potrero, which will take effect at
I the next quarterly meeting of the Pension
i Commissioners on the hrst Monday in
' April, has also caused a good deal of
i speculation as to his successor, it is
currently reported that at the same meet
| ing the resignations of Captains Bohen
and Dunleavy and Sergeant Shields will
| be accepted, and tne names of their prob
able successors are being freely dia
j cussed.
To fill the vacancy caused by the res
ignation of Lieutenant Bennett the names
of Sergeants John Martin and Price are
mentioned. They are both able and ef
ficient officers, and richly deserve promo
tion. The general impression is that
Sergeant Martin will get the plum. If,
however, Captain Dunleavy's resignation
is accepted, that would mean the pro
motion of a lieutenant, and consequently
there would be two vacancies of lieuten
ants to be lined, and both Martin and
Price could accommodated.
Following the same reasoning, the
question of successors to the two cap
tains comes into prominence. It Is gen
eral ly understood that a successor to
Captain Bohen lies between Detectives
Bee and Seymour. The former Is well

CAME FROM MONTANA.
Determined to Wreak VÂ«ngoÂ«noÂ« on
the MÂ«n Who DeoÂ«ived
Her.
The husband of Mrs. Alverson, the
woman who claims she was twice robbed j
by Frank Hall, alias Hartman, a remit
tarice maji, is determined to make his ;
wife's despoiler suffer for the double :
crime. Alverson is a Montana cattle king. 'â 
After learning the story of his wife's j
disgrace, he concluded to visit the city !
for the purpose of wreaking vengeance
on the man who had robbed her. Alver
son arrived here last Saturday night, and ;
at once repaired to his wife's apartments, |
..! 208 Eddy street. She pleaded for for- !
giveness, hut her tearful entreaties only '
sed his anger. Shortly after 8 ;
<>'. lock yesterday -morning the cattle king,
accompanied by his wife, visited the office |
of Chief of Police Lees for the purpose,
aa he stated, of learning the facts of the ;
robbery. Mrs. Alverson, pale and trem
bling, remained silent while the clerk
briefly t<>ld the indignant husband of his
- downfall. Evidently dissatisfied
With the story told him, Alverson de- i
manded to know the name of the police
man who had arrested Hall. When told
that the arresting officer was William
Brophy, Alverson asked that he be sent
for. As Brophy was not on duty at the
time it was arranged that he should meet
the cattle king in his wife's apartments
at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Brophy
appeared at the appointed hour, and to
the indignant husband he informed him j
of what had transpired. Furious with :
rage, Alverson swore vengeance against
his wife's despoiler. He declared that he
would spend his entire fortune in running
him down, and make him suffer for his â 
despicable act.
Last night Alverson was searching for
Hall, but he failed to find him. It is
believed that he became aware of the
visit of the cattle king, and fearing
violence at his hands, he wisely conclud
i â ': to leave the city.
Mrs. Alverson, about a week ago, met i
Hall in a resort on Eddy street, and j
after having several rounds of drinks,
they repaired to his apartments. Dur
ing the night he stole her money and !
valuables and quietly left the room.
On discovering her loss a short time
afterward she at once notified Chief Lees,
who detailed Policeman Brophy to find
the thief. He located him in a saloon
on Market street, and when searched
all the stolen property was found in his
possession. Hall was then taken to the
City Prison, but as the woman refused i
to prosecute him he was shortly after- i
ward released. Several days later Hall j
again met Mrs. Alverson and invited her j
â¢ a ride to Golden Gate Park. While >
passing a lonely spot, she claims, a
masked man sprang out upon them, and !
at the point of a revolver ordered the !
thoroughly frightened woman to throw |
up her hands. Hall, she claims, took j
her money and jewelry, and after threat
ening to kill her if she informed the po
lice ne and his confederate disappeared
In the brush. Mrs. Alverson reported i
the robbery to a private detective agency
and offered a reward for the recovery
Df her diamonds. Her husband learned
Df her conduct by reading a dispatch in
a. Montana paper, giving a few details i
Df the robbery, and he immediately de- j
rided to wreak vengeance on the. man j
who had basely bertayed his wife. Last i
night he again visited police headquar- i
ters, and invoked the aid of Chief Lees '
in assisting him in finding Hall. When !
told it was believed that he had left the i
city he declared he would follow him to i
the north pole, if necessary, and force j
liim to atone for his double crime.
WINDY DAY AT
PARK AND OCEAN
Thousands Seek the Beach,
Hoping to See a Great
Storm.
Electrio Lights Will Bo Put In
Golden Gate Park This
Week.
Owing to the high wind yesterday there
were comparatively few people at the
park, though thousands visited the Cliff
House, hoping to behold a heavy sea.
The sea, however, was comparatively
light, though the wind was a regular hur
ricane along the beach.
There were no accidents at the park
or beach. In spite of the fact that a great
many of those who went to the ocean
were considerably inebriated when they
got there.
There were two donations to the Park
Museum last week. John L. Bardwell
save a bronze monument In the shape
of a frog, and the Mayflower Mining
Company presented a beautiful piece of
cement, rich in free gold.
Important improvements are now un

PAID TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THEIR DEPARTED LEADER.
The temperance workers of the continent propose to erect a monument to the memory of their departed leader.
Miss Frances Willard. The site for it has been chosen and Chicago is the place selected. It will be a gigantic me
morial building. Members of the "W. C. T. U. have already commenced to collect funds for the memorial, and yester
day quite a snug sum was realized in this city as a nucleus for the donations that are expected to follow.
The movement was initiated ail over the United States by memorial services that were conducted in all the
cities, towns and villages in the Union where branches of the organization exist. In this city the services were held
at the First Baptist Church. Words of tribute to the memory of the departed leader of the army that is waging a
hard war against intemperance were said by Mrs. B. Sturtevant-Peet and Miss Jessie Ackerman. Miss Ackerman
in her remarks said:
'"In 1885 there was an exciting scene witnessed in New Tork. Word had come that U. S. Grant was deadâ a
man whom all loved and all equally honored. Every one vied with his neighbor to show the most honor to the de
parted hero. I remember so well the crowd as his funeral procession passed through the street and I went into a
doorway that I might better see the cortege. I did not notice for a few moments where I had gone, and when I did
I found it was a little shop. In the window the proprietor had a card, poorly written, poorly spelt, but the senti
ment of that card meant more than all the mottoes that hung around the streets. It simply said, 'A man has died.'
Truly the grandest tribute that was ever paid to Grant was paiS in these words.
"In the early part of February of this year there flashed across the wires the news that 'A woman had died.'
Yes, a woman had died, and that woman caused a great part of the world to lay down Its work and weep over her
departure. It was Frances E. Willard, the grandest woman of the age, who had left this world.
"Miss Willard was a friend of the lowly, a friend of the oppressed. She had a sweet smile and a gracious
way for all. She was a woman with a marvelous and imperial intellect.
"To-day we do not come to mourn over her death, but to pay tribute to her memory â not to weep, but to
honor the beloved departed."
street was crowded by the friends and
relatives of the late T. J. Bass, who had
gathered to testify to the respect and
love which were his during life.
The funeral oration was delivered by

PROMISED TURF UPHEAVAL.
Jockeys Jones and Spencer to Be
Placed on the Rack Wednesday-
Night â Ingleside Races.
The coming Investigation of the charges
against the suspended riders, Jones and
Spencer, together with the prohable im
plication of several others In the scandal,
will be food for the gossips the coming
week. The California Jockey Club offi
cials seem determined to sift the thing
to the bottom, and unless the rumored
charges of fraud assume gigantic propor
tions there is apt to be a vacancy or two
on the turf. Some very prominent names
are being mentioned in connection with
the thing, but racetracks are most pro
ductive of "dope stories" and it may all
end in the suspended individuals being
completely exonerated.
The scene of racing operations will
again be transferred to Ingle.side this
afternoon. Like nearly all of the cards
offered at the local track there is a no
ticeable paucity of entries, but with
more or less class attached.

POOLS GOOD,
POOLS BAD
Jurors Refuse to Fine One
Dealer and License
Another.
A War Between Pool-Sellers
at the Track and Those
in the City.
Commissioner Gunst Tries to Blame
Chief Lees for Not Closing
Poolrooms.
I The situation regarding the prosecution
' of poolsellers in this city Is so strange
1 that it presents many interesting fea
tures and Is likely to lead to scandals and
! exposures.
It Is openly charged by the poolsellers
in the city that Commissioner Gunst is
protecting the poolsellers at the race track
and is doing all in his power to have
those in the city punished and closed up,
j not because he is religiously opposed to
! the selling of pools, but because he is
> interested in doing all in his power to
hurt the city poolseliers, so as to give
those on the track a monopoly of the bus
iness.
There have been something like seventy
arrests for selling pools In San Francisco
thirty-five cases have been tried and
about an equal number aro pending in
the courts. Of all cases tried but two
have resulted in convictions. The fine
in these was the petty sum of $5, which
sum the brokers would gladly pay daily
for immunity from molestation.
There was a rumor on the streets a
few days ago that Gunst had blamed
Chief Cees for the failures to convict,
the accusation being made that he in
structed officers to select men who are
Indifferent on the subject.
In regard to the charges last night
Chief Lees made the following statement:
"There ia no conflict between Mr. Gunst
and me. The Juries have all been satis
factory to Judge Murphy, who has been
specially prosecuting the cases. In every
Instance the jurors have been represent
ative merchants and business men, but
they have been too broad minded to make
fish of one and fowl of the other. They
have not been willing to allow men to
sell pools without molestation on the
race track and punish others In the city
severely for doing the same thing. We
have done all we can do. We have taken
licenses away from all saloons that sell
pools, and have driven the poolsellers to
selling in secret. They no tonger issue
tickets and they will not sell unless they
know their man is all right."
WHO STRUCK J. S. GADDISP
! The Police Tracing the Man's Move
ments to Find the Guilty Party.
The police were at work all day yes-
I terday tracing the movements of J. S.
I Gaddis on last Friday night when he was
injured so seriously that he died the fol
lowing evening- There is but little doubt
, in the minds of the officers that he be
1 came engaged in a brawl and received his
w.mnds during the tight, but who the
guilty are they have been unable to de
termine.
Officers Bean and Ellis of the harbor
station were detailed on the case and
; starting from the saloon at 23 East street,
where Gaddis was last seen, found the
woman whom he had been with on Fri- I
day night. She was Lily Hill, and she
gave to the police a full account of where
. she and Gaddis had boon. About 530
o'clock they went from the saloon to a i
: rooming house at 9 Clay street, run by
I a Mrs. Mulloch. Shortly before S o'clock
j Gaddis ran down stairs with the woman's
t shoe in his hand, and Lily followed him.
Mrs. Mulloch took Gaddis to task for
creating a disturbance, and when he be
gan to curse her she had him put out of '
the house, and it is said that after he
was on the street he had a fight with
some men. Whether he was assaulted i
while in The house or after he left it is i
a matter of conjecture, but the police are
inclined to believe that it was on the side
walk.
The records of the Harbor Station show I
that a J. S. Gladdis wasarrested for be- ;
ing drunk about S o'clock Friday night
and investigation has proven that this
was the man Gaddis. A boy informed
the station, on that evening, that a man
was lying on the sidewalk in front of 9
Clay street. Officer J. F. McKay went
to the place and found Gaddis, with his
coat and hat off and his face considerably
bruised. Inquiry of the crowd around the
man as to whether there had been a
fight failed to bring any response. Gad
dis was taken to the station and was
| booked, but when asked how he had been
j hurt replied that it was all right, batur
: day morning he was taken to the Cen
| tral Station, and when discharged by one
; of the Judges returned to his room at
I the Golden Eagle Hotel, and seemed all
: right until late in the evening when he
I became unconscious. It is not known ex-
I actly what caused the man's death. The
! Receiving Hospital people believe that his
! skull was fractured, but this will not be
i known for certain until the autopsy is
i held to-day The man complained of
I pains in his abdomen before he lost con
i sciousness, so he may have been injured
Internally.

Nellie Bray, 23 years of age, living at

night by stabbing herself In the left
breast. The deceased attempted her life
early on Saturday morning, but she was
prevented t'rum carrying out her purpose
by her parents. She had been ill for
several months from consumption and an
ailment of the etomach. Her physicians
recently hatte been prescribing morphine
to ease her sufferings, and she took her
life while in delirium under the influ
ence of ih<? drug. Her father, Patrick
Bray, made an effort to prevent the girl
from takii:sc hf-r life, but he was too late
in reaching her side to stop her from
inflicting the wound that caused her
death. Sh.- died almost instantly. Dr.
Hubbell r. ported the death of the girl
to the Morgue, and he was of the opin
ion the blade of the weapon with which
she committed the deed had pierced her
heart.

troubled with terrible sick headaches and spells of vomiting ever since
she was a little tot. Her father thought she would outgrow them, bat
she didn't. She did not chew her food enough, and what she threw
up seemed but half digested. Through the advice of a friend, I
began giving her

She was benefited at once, and after a treatment of one week the

Since writing this letter, the lady states that she has reduced the
dose to half a Tabule a day and the good effect still continues and she <fc
believes that the use of the Tabules may soon be wholly discontinued,
for her daughter appears now to be absolutely well.

Value of Municipal League in

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 20.
fiverything in Oakland at this time is
subordinated to politics. Woodward has
had his day, Brosnahan ceases to inter
est, scandals sit the City Hall have been
so frequent that they are commonplace
and do longer shuck and even the bold
programme undertaken by the Grand
Jury is fast taking on an opera bouffe
air. But there is a State and a county
I close by it another
municipal election, so that there is al
most one year of active politics in sight,
and even Oakland is satisfied with the
prospect.
Something I wrote last week has called
forth a very comprehensive and intelli
gent communication from some one who
Is evidently a keen student of Oakland's
municipal politics. A large portion of the
letter is of public interest, but some of
the ideas expressed are not borne out
by experience. It states that with the
exception of the poolroom enactment,
which was shortlived, Oakland retained
the good name it had bo long held and
was a growing and prosperous city, until
the Municipal League came into exist
ence and elected Pardee Mayor and a re
form Council. The letter proceeds:
The Mayor, at the head of a mob, took forci
ble possession of private property, to which
they had no more title than you or 1 have to
Dr. Coyle's church. They then Interfered ..>y
ordinance â¢th the running of our local trains,
under the time table which had been JV-* years
In existence, and under which <.>r .-~ >"â 'â¢ it was
impossible to run their traU>-. 'with regularity
and which resulted fiaaHS) In depriving tho
people of East and nest Oakland of the privi
lege of free riding, which for all previous time
they had enjoyed, and which will never be re
covered. Then the water front suit was com
r.ience.l, which, besides tying up, indefinitely,
the water front, will cost, all told, the larger
jart of SIOO.COO. while, by the employment of
Bo:ne reliable firm of lawyers, at a coat oil not
over $10,000, and Intervening in the Davie suit,
nil tho points could have been raised and
brought 1 â â¢â¢:'. re our Supreme Court and a de
cision reached.
Next, more particularly to please Pardee.
the charter was amended and the police and
fire departments brought back Into ward pol
itics, the results of which we see In the scan
dals of the day.
At the bottom of most of our present trou
bles, and responsible for them, you will find
the solid saloon element, controlling 1000 or
more votes, and a very excellent (In some re
6pecta) Christian element, who will Insist
upon putting up third candidates, and then
allowingâ as a sample â Fibush to be elected In
the Fifth Ward, instead of an excellent and re

The above is the nrst time I have heard
Iâ outside of Southern Pacific Com

city had no more right to open Broadway
than has any individual to preempt Dr.

years and no one knew he would return

the points, which could not have been
brought up at a more timely period.
Now, what is to be learned from these
lessons? The answer is simple. Any
one who remembers the method by which
the last so-called municipal Republican
convention was foisted upon the party
can see that the only remedy is for the
party to adhere to precedent and to elect
its own delegates at properly appointed
primaries. Frank Leach was the first
to detect the infamy of last spring and
it is an open secret that he and Dr.
je Tardee quarreled over the early
sof the plotâ now successfulâ to give
ty into the hands of the water com
â  rdee was honest in the matter
and sincere, but results are the true crit
erion and everybody's eyes are now
opened. It is timely to ask the ques
tion are the Republicans now posing as
leaders, or holding offices, doing their
to preserve the party intact? In some
Instances, most assuredly not. The RÂ«Â»
publican members of the Board of Works
may be loyal to themselves, but they are
not loyal to the party that elected them.

the Mayor and the City Attorney slighted
the Republican party for over a y ea Â£
by refusing to acknowledge that there
are two men among all the hosts tnat
voted for McKinley capable of making
heads of department? It has been said
that the Mayor will not seek another po
litical office, and while this may oe
true' of him, it does not apply to Mr.
Dow, who has himself stated that he in
tends, if possible, to stay a few years m
political life. If the two men who are
running for the nomination of Governor
on their Republican records have as
much Influence In the party as is elaimeu
for them let them use it right at home
and show that their claims are well
The unification of the Republican party
in this city and the exercise of discreet
party discipline would prevent water
scandals and Jobbery In the departments.
Alameda has during the past few weeks
furnished a most remarkable example 01
the uncertainty of juries in criminal
trials. About a month ago a member or
one of Oakland's vicious gangs was on
trial for burglary. He was found guilty.
A few days ago another member of the
gang arrested under the same circum
stances and at the same time for a
charge Identically the same, was found
not guilty. The testimony in each case
was the same, the witnesses were the
same, the attorneys for the defense were
the Fame and only the verdicts differed.
Why?
Apparently Oakland cannot be anything
but funny, even in little things as well
as great. Its unwritten history surely
cannot be such that every time an indi
vidual breathes heavily some one consid
ers he is In danger of having his reputa
tion tarnished. This remark, however, is
not without cause and Is Justified by the
fear of certain individuals that their
doubtful acts may. appear In print. Once
every few days a tour is made of the
newspaper offices to "keep out" some
trifling circumstance that would never be
heard of but for the fear that follows it.
Not once in a hundred times has the cor
respondent heard of the silly event, and
not once in a thousand is there a story
in it. Yet the fearful clique never seem
to understand that they are simply mak
ing fools of themselves twice over, for
in these competitive times there is not
Influence enough in the county to prevent
the publication of a legitimate good story
once it gets into a newspaper office. Two
days ago the "suppression committee
went around and succeeded in arousing
a great deal of suspicion that would
otherwise never have nrlaen. What is
the meaning of this exhibition of fear
over trifles? Does the doctrine of mil
tual protection expjair^t?

CAUSED BY A BROKEN THIGH.
Gee Lee Refused to Accept Dr. R. T.
Stratton's Treatment and
Is Dead.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, March 20.
Gee Lee, a Chinaman. 41 years of age,
who keeps a laundry on lower Broadway,
is in the morgue to-night, the result of
his faith in a Celestial surgeon. The Cor
oner will hold an inquest to-morrow, and
in the meantime every effort is being
made to ascertain the name of the phy
sician who treated the unfortunate man.
Lee was driving his wagon yesterday ,
afternoon, delivering washing in the
neighborhood of Fourth and Alice streets.
His horse became frightened in some
manner and ran away, throwing him out.
As a result of the fall Lee's thigh was
broken. He was picked up and taken to
the Receiving Hospital, which was only
three blocks frnm where the accident
happened. Dr. R. T. Stratton reduced
the fracture and placed splints upon it.
Ordinarily a man under such circum
stances would have remained in the hos
pital until after the reaction from the
accident.
Lee's friends removed him to the laun
dry and called a Chinese physician from
San Francisco. From the condition Lee
was found in to-day it appears that the
second physician undid all that Dr. Strat
ton had accomplished. The splint was
torn off and the thigh wrapped in bark
and silk bandages. His death occurred
this morning, and the Coroner declares
that the Chinaman is responsible. The
men in the laundry refuse to give the
physician's name, but it is believed it can
be ascertained In time to-morrow to have
him present at the inquest.
It is expected that he will be charged
with causing the death of Gee Lee.
Moffett Still Improving.
OAKLAND, March 20.â J. H. Moffett is
Improving fast, and it is expected that he
will soon be able to be removed to the
County Jail. The Coroner will hold an
inquest to-morrow evening on the re
mains of his wife, which had been post
poned In order to learn whether all of the
testimony would be necesary in the case.
Had Moffett died the circumstances would
not have been necessary for a verdict.
As it is, all details of the case must be
gone into.
A PICNIC IN A NORTH WIND.
Terpsichore and Bacchus Revel at the Initial Outing
of the Season at Shell Mound.
Old Boreas, fresh from his play in the ice-fields of the fro
zen North, in company with briny Neptune, struck the Shell
Mound picnic grounds yesterday afternoon and whistled
through the slats of the dance pavilion to the time of the mu
sic within. The first picnic of the season was on and the Mu
sicians' Society was responsible for It.
Pent up during the winter months, the picnickers were ready
for a npread. All the belles of all the various cliques, dressed
in their finery, were well attended by the gallant
knights of the slippery floor. Altogether, Jt was quite an ex
clusive affair, but the rank outsider now and then slipped in
to the discomfort of some and the amusement of others. The
son of a prominent tea merchant, in Prince Albert, silk tils
and patent leathers, with a lady of society on his arm, were
in It, but not of it. With the hauteur of the Statue of Liberty
he explained things to the young lady. The real element dis
played a frigid shoulder and a chilling glance to this infringe
ment of their Bacred rights and allowed no poaching.
The polico pronounced tho picnic "most orderly indeed."
But there -were a few who violated the proprieties of good be
havior and poured the white-foamed beverage down their
throats until a super-saturation caused an oozing out at the
pores. The alaHul ones' now and then became obstreperous, and

Another Typewritten Reso

Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 20.
To-morrow evening the City Council
will take up the Mayor's veto, but it is
not likely that the matter will arouse
much discussion. The committee has al
n ady decided to refer it back to the
Council without recommendation, but
Mr. Henneberry, of resolution fame, will
probably produce the little, typewritten
paper that he excitedly brought up at
the last meeting and wnich "resolves"
that the Mayor has nothing at all to do
With the matter, and that his veto be
laid on the table Indefinitely.
In a few days the Council will have to
elect a new president for the coming
year. This means that the personnel of
all the .standing committees will be
changed, as each president names his
own choice.
It is rumored that the solid six may
; decide to make "Woodward their choict.,
i and as there are but eleven votes they
can do as they please. Such an act would,
i of course, bo an insult to the commun

The manner in which the "Water

WING WINS FROM WYMAN.
The Strong Wind and a Punctured
Tire Spoils a Day's Sport.
OAKLAND. March 20.â The five-mile
bicycle rare between J. E. Wing of tne
Olympics and Go^rere Wyman of the Re
liance Club at Elmhurst to-day resulted
in a victory for the former. At the start
Wyman took his position behind Wulc
and let his pacema.kers follow, so that if
he should be unable to hold the pace they
could pull him up again. The first mile
was ridden in 2:is 2-."). In the third lap of
the second mile Wing- shook Wyman. who
was picked up by Egan and Llnu but he
could not hold the pace, and was soon
caught by his clever opponent. In the
fourth mile Wyman punctured both tires
and retired, leaving Wing to ride it out
alone.
The time for the five milesâ ll:3l 4-5â
was very good, considering- tho strong
wind with which they had to contend.
The baseball game was won by the
Olympic (.earn with a score of 9 to 4.
Next Sunday the second of the Acme-
Reliance team races takes place, and
should be a great race, as both teams
have trained hard for it.
personal ejectment was served upon them. One shock-headed
son of Bacchus was thrown out, but he left his hat Dehind.
Some one called him "Chapeau-nit," but he didn't respond to
the name. All the way home ho was singing "Just tell them
that you saw me and I left my lid behind; 1 will not go there
again until my hat I find." Some one gave him a greasy cap
on the boat, but he atill called out for his "lid." "They stole
me lid, and I'll sell this for six bits." was the refrain to his
songs and hla extemporaneous eloquence.
It was during the eighth waltz that an. International war
was threatened. Mr. Bijou, the officer of the day, blew his
whistle, and, with a wave of his mighty hand, cut the dance In
twain. Mounting the platform, in true forensic style, ha be
gan to shadow a number of prospective events. All went well
until ho reached the "Americus Club" prospectus. The club
with the patriotic appellation is not in high favor with the
musicians on account of the employment of non-union men, so
a storm began to rise Immediately upon the mention of its
name. All strife was avoided, however, by the magnanimity
of the musicians In the union and the generosity of the Amor
icus delegation, which was displayed by ordering much small
beer. The picnic continued until the cold wind petrified the
devotees of Terpsichore, and the chill that the setting sun left

NATIONAL
GUARD NOTES
Things That the Inspec
tion of the First Infan
try Developed.
Captain Carrlngton's Report
Was Something of a
Disappointment.
The Naval Militiaâ The Fifth Division
at Eureka Celebrates an Old
Time Day.
Owing to the absence from the city of I
the division commander, the division j
headquarters, bo far as news of the guard \
is concerned, was closed during the past
week.
Since last Monday the members of the
local companies have been Interested In
the Inspections that have been held at
the regimental armory by Brigade Inspec
tor Major Jansen and Captain Carring
ton, U. S. A., inspector and instructor' of
the' National Guard of the State of Cali
fornia. All the companies of the First
Infantry Regiment have been inspected j
except C and G, that are to go through
the ordeal to-night, and Company B, the
inspection of which has been courteously
postponed until some future date on ac
count of the absence from the city of the
commanding officer, Captain Qeorge Fil
mer. Of the nine companies inspected all
but Company H made a good numerical
showing. That company, commanded by
Captain Frank W. Warren, had nine ab
sentees at roll call on Wednesday night.
None of the' other companies had an ex
cess of three. Still the showing made by
Captain Warren's company was much
better than at the previous inspection.
Generally speaking all the companies
made a good showing, and in appearance
there was a decided improvement over ths
Inspection of the previous year. Their
service uniforms, though much the worse
for age and wear, showed that they had
been brushed up and made to look aa
well as they could under the circum
stances, and that they toad been put on
with the idea that the uniforms should
lit the men and not as in the past, the
men forced Into uniforms fit or no lit.
That tended much to improve the soldier
ly appearance of the men. The orders
required that the men at inspection
should wear the regulation tin cup, as
well as haversacks and canteens.
The inspection both by day, when the
property was examined, and by night.
When the men were examined, developed
the fact that thi armory, while a decid
ed improvement on anything In that line
previously had In this city, is not what
Is required for a twelve company, or even
eight company, regiment The company
rooms have not sufficient space to admit
of closet room in which to properly ar
range the uniforms. The drili room, whils
it is large, is so small that when, as tho
other evening, one of the companies was
called upon to drill in extended orders,
but one-half of the company could take
part in the movements, that is only thirty
men. It is v remarkable thing that tha
State expects that the men shall be sol
diery, but it fails to provide them with a
proper place, in the sha>sÂ« of an armory,
in which they can learn the duties of a
soldier and the movements they are, by
the regulations, required to execute. Tha
inspection also disclosed the fact that
while the store room* provided for tho
eight companies in the regimental ar
mories are k<i>t neat and the property
therein apparenti. well, cared for, the
space allotted to iaeli company is much
too small. With more room the State
property could be better taken care of,
and at each inspection there would be less
property to condemn. The inspection, as
far as it has gone in this regiment, also
shows that there is a deficiency in over
coats and that the men are still armed
with a poor lot of rifles of the pattern
of 1573. Had the authorities been as ac
tive, as they ought to be, the guard at
this time would be armed with the mod
ern rifles, thousands of which are now
at the Benicia arsenal, and have been
there since the regulars were furnished
with the Krag-Jorgensen.-?. Recently,
Illinois and Nebraska made applications
for an exchange of the i>?:; rilles for the
members of the National Guard, and In a
few weeks they obtained them, because
the men at the head of the guard took
an active interest in its welfare.
This afternoon the cadet company of the
First Infantry will be inspected and to
morrow night the field and staff officers
will appear before the inspector. The
brigade orders say that the medical corps
will be inspected at the same time, but
that is a mistake, tor the inspection of
that branch of the service has been left
to the discretion of the surgeon-general
to name the time, and he has not yet fixed
it. Troop A and^the signal corps will
be Inspected on Wednesday.
The brigadier inspector, when he has
finished with the first regiment, will have
a number of recommendations to make.
As soon as he has finished the inspec
tions here, he will proceed to inspect the
companies of the First Regiment of In
fantry.
TUB NAVAI, MfI.TTTA.
At the election held last Monday at
Santa Cruz, and over which Lieutenant-
Commander Nerny, a (tins captain of
the militia, presided, resulted In the pro
motion of Carl E. Llndsey to the posi
tion of lieutenant, vice Morey, resigned,
.T. C. Doyle, lieutenant junior grande, vice
Llndsey, promoted, and Thomas Arm
strong, ensign.
The order of the Board of Harbor Com
missioners that the Marion shall cast
her moorings and go into the stream is
not relished by the members of the Naval
Militia stationed at this port. Lieutenant
(''unrnander T. A. Nerny, commanding the
miiitia during the absence of Captain
Turner, who is in Alaska, when informed
the other day of the action of the Har
bor < 'ommissioners, and asked what he
proposed to do about the matter, made
repfy in words that were as expressive
as the famous answer of Cambron on
the field of Waterloo, when told by an
English general that the guard must Bur
render. The ground for asking the re
moval is that there is a lack of wharf
room. Now the officers of the battalion
are at a loss to understand how there
can be a lack of room when there were
two berths empty for several days just
above the Marion. The matter will be
called to the attention of the Governor
and it is asserted that the Marlon will
not be moved until the order to do so
comes from the commandt-r-in-chief. The
vessel was recently completely wired at
considerable expense, so that there might
be electric lights on board.
For several weeks the men of the two
divisions have been drilling on board of
the vessel, and they are becoming quite
proficient In the work they are called
upon to perform.
Adjutant General Barrett recently paid
a surprise visit to the Marion for the pur
pose of ascertaining in what condition
the vessel is kept when an official or
semi-official visit is not expected. To his
great surprise he found everything in
first-class condition and there was not a
thing in the arrangements that called for
condemnation.
THE FIFTH DIVISION.
EUREKA, March 19.â 0n the loth of
March, 1579, Company A of the men
Tenth Infantry, N. G. C, was organized
at Eureka, Humboldt County, and was
assigned to the then Sixth Brigade. On
each 15th of March subsequent to the or
ganization Company A gave a grand ball,
and that was continued until 18iÂ»5, when
on a reorganization of the National Guard
Company A was merged into the Fifth
Division of the naval militia stationed at
Eureka.
With the change the annual ball was
discontinued, but this year it was decided
to revive the memories of days gone by,
and the members of the division decided
to celebrate the 15th just for old time's
sake. On the evening of that day Ar
mory Hall presented a most beautiful and
interesting appearance.
Early In the evening the hall was filled
with people. The men of the division ap
peared in white uniforms, and for half
an hour went through the approved drill
of the naval militia. After a short inter
val at the conclusion of the drill a blank
cartridge was fired from tho one-pounder
by Chief Petty Officer Caldwell and al
most simultaneously the orchestra began
to play and the engagement was on.
About 100 couples appeared on the floor
and dancing began.
The Fifth Division is under the com
mand of Lieut, nant C. V. Otto, who is
ably supported by Lieutenant Smith and
Ensigns McLaughlin and Barnum. The
division is quite ready for service, having
recently received from the Government
seventy new Leo magazine rifles., the re
quired" belts, pistols and other equip
ments, and a rapid-fire one-pounder
Hotehklss. They are "xpecting at any
time to receive from the Government new
uniformsâ the regulation blue of the
United States naval militia. This divi
sion under its careful and painstaking
commander and officers has reached a
high degree of efficiency; and since the
late crisis both officers and seamen are
taking an unusual Interest In their work.

THE DAY IN THE CHURCHES.
Ignorance and Knowledge.
"I Am the Way. the Truth and the Life"
â¢was the subject of the address given by Rev
William Rader at the Third Congregational
Church yesterday morning.
"The words of the text." he said, are a defi
nition of education. It comprehends the ap
preciation and right use of ourselves. The
ship may be drawn out of the forest trees
but it must also be mastered and kept in its
path Jesus gives a right method, a right
truth and a right life. If one Is Ignorant of
these he la not educated.
â¢â¢We are kept in ienorance because we
Ftifle inquiry; resist new truth: worship an
tiquity, not progress, and because we follow
the false dictum that â¢where ignorance Is
bliss 'tis folly to be wise. 1 China is an Illus
tration of resisted know-edge. It may be an
Impertinence to opp â  pagan i .-ions, but It
i" worthy of the highest ambition to Impart
the doctrine of a right method of life, a right
truth of life and a right Christ line of char-
"One of our San Francisco papers has chal
lenged the right of missionaries to go abroad
â with their message. I attribute this to a mis
understanding-of the message of the mission
ary, which is not to tear down a faith or de
stroy a heathen Bible, but to introduce these
three principles of a real civilizationâ right
method, the right truth and a right life. Uni
versities and schools which do not Impart this
knowledge are failures. Education is not an
end. but a means to a moral end.
â¢'Jesus was the best educated man, not as
Bpencer or Plato or Aristotle, but In the ele
ment? of true power. Ills was the education
of wisdom. The reason, the Bible, the church
Â«.nd the spirit are among the instrumentalities
leading us to a right philosophy of life. The
more knowledge a man has of this life the
more capacity he may have to enjoy the other
life. The Bible naturally leads to th*J ideal of
my text. It Is a lantern to guide, not a shot
eun to controvert. When we make rifles of
lamps we do violence to the Bible. The church
IB! here to teach these three things: How to
behave how to think, how to be. The Holy
Spirit Is a guide to these truths. The spirit
does not give one brains. A man Insult Ood
when he says the spirit gives him something
to say as by magic. The spirit brings things
to our remembrance. Jesus Christ is the seat
of authority. He said. 'I am the living Illus
tration of how you should behave, of what you
should think and of the life you should live
The revelation of this idea has cost blood and
sacrifice. Our Anglo-Saxon civilization is in
that utterance: and we have not yet worked It
out in all its perfection."
Progress of the City.
"I hope that if In a thousand years a Jew
rrmes into your presence to attempt to solve
the problem of thÂ» progress of civic Rovern
mentâl hope he m;iv do better than I am able.
to do to-nieht." This WAS the clima-v that
Kabbl VoorÂ«ang-er reached in his lecture on
the City" before the oon
jrrepn.ti.in i.f the Second Unitarian Church last
The address consisted ol a discussion
of the existing evils of the municipality and
a well-defined i'a.rallei between tfce corrup
â  the Greeks and Romans and of the
,â¢ to-day. He Bpoke of the women of
111 fame who lay in wait for the young men
,-â¢â  th- city with their bestial Invitations to
It Bin and contrasted them with the
â an women who in ancient times in
fested the groves built expressly for them in
the ancient city. .
â¢What have you to pay about Parisian vo
latility and the corruption of the Greeks and
Romans." he raid, "when in your midst are
,1b of iniquity that yearn for your chil
dren who are almost nurtured on the poison
GRAPPLES WITH
TWO BURGLARS
E. J. Croly of Sacramento Re
ceives Probably Fatal
Wounds.
Shot Twice by One of a Pair of
Thieves Who Tried to Loot
His House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 20. â Ex-
Street Commissioner E. J. Croly, who
lives on the corner of Twelfth and P
Btreets, was shot and probably fatally
wounded to-night by one of two burg
lars who were attempting to rob his
house. The shooting occurred at about
9 o'clock.
Mr. and Mrs. Croly and their servant
girl had retired for the night and the
house was dark. The supposition is
that the burglars took it for granted
the family was not at home. Mr. Croly
heard voices in the house and got out
of bed to investigate. On opening the ,
door of his room, which is in the up
per story of a small cottage, he en
countered the two men. One of them
had Just lighted a match, and they
were evidently just about to enter
Croly's bedroom. Though unarmed,
Croly grappled with the nearest burg- j
lar and struck him several blows with
his fist. The burglars started to get
away, but Croly, though 60 years of
age, followed and continued to assault
the one nearest to him.
The burglar then drew a pistol and
fired two shots at Croly. Both took
effect, one in his left and the other in j
his right breast, both well up near the j
collar-bone. Croly fell in the hallway j
and the men escaped. Chief of Police j
Dwyer, several officers and a doctor j
goon arrived, and while the latter at- j
tended the wounded man the police
searched the premises, but the burglars
had of course got away. It was found
that one of the bullets had cut an ar
tery and Mr. Croly sank rapidly. He
was cool, however, and gave the offi
cers a fair description of the burglars.
Â« >ne was a man about five feet eight i
Inches tall, with a dark mustache and
well dressed. The other was a short,
h'-avy man, whose features he was not j
able to see plainly.
It is thought that Croly cannot live, i
Only a few weeks ago his former part- i
ner. Silas Carle, died. They were prom- !
inent contractors and had erected many :
county and other public buildings in
the State, including the Fresno Court
house. They also built the great
ninety-mile flume that supplies San |
Diego with water.
ASTRONOMER PERRINE
FINDS ANOTHER COMET.
Wanderer of the Skies Seen Through I
the Big Telescope at Lick
Observatoy.
SAN JOSE, March 20.â second com
et of the year 1898 was discovered at the
Lick Observatory this morning at about
4:30 o'clock by C. D. I'errine. It is situat
ed in the western portion of the constel
lation Pegasus, south of the star lota. Its
position at 53 minutes 50 seconds. Green
wich mean time, was right ascension 21
hours IS minutes 36.89, and its declination ;
north 16 degrees 43 minutes 23.3 seconds.
It is moving north one degree per day
and east nearly four minutes of time.
The comet is as bright as a star of the
seventh magnitude, and can be seen with
a very small telescope. The bead is
round and about two minutes of an arc
in diameter, with a bright central con
densation 10 seconds in diameter. This
nucleus Is not stellar, but has a granu
lated appearance. A tall about one de
gree long extends away from the sun.
As soon as two more observations can
be secured its orbit will be calculated at
the Lick Observatory. Until this is done
little can be said of Its - future move
ments. The last six cornets have been
consecutively discovered at the Lick Ob
eervatory by Assistant Astronomer C. D.
Perrine,

however, is the woman of that type of_ whom
Solomon speaks aa the scarlet woman.'
Heredity and Morality.
"Heredity and Morality." or the Influence of
heredity on morality, was the subject which
the Rev. B. Calzia, S. J.. chose for his lecture
at St. iKiiatius church last evening. The ad
dress in substance wa.' as follows:
There is a law in nature by which all beings
endowed With life tend to repeat themselves
In their descendants. This tendency is what
Is called heredity. The .question is whether
heredity has any influence ..n morality or
whether moral qualities are transmitted from
parent to child. Materialistic philosophers
claim tiNit moral qualities virtues .t rices
â¢ire transmitted like physical external or in
ternal qualities. Such a doctrine cannot stand
In th.- light oi reasi n, for these moral quali
ties are spiritual and reside in the will, which
is a faculty nf the soul. Reason teaches that
thy soul, being a spiritual substance, cannot
come Into existence by generation; but only
by creation !n the very Instant In which the
body is ready for its reception. Consequently
the o.ualitiÂ«s nr virtues ana vices cannot be
'transmitted by generation. The child, there
f re, does not enter the world as some main
tain a criminal or a saint He enters the
world with organic dispositions favorable lor
tl â â  unfi Iding of the germs of virtue or the
tendencies of vices. The development of these
germs is the result of education.
For Three Great Purposes.
Dr. Charles Edward Locke at Central Meth
odist Church last evening delivered a ser
mon on "What Can a Wowan Do? or Prac
tical Lessons From the Remarkable Career I
of Frances Willard. His text was psalm '
6S, verse 2: "The Lord glveth the word; the j
women that publish the tidings are a great ;
hoot."
â¢'God has given to woman her own unique |
place in the world," said the speaker. "Emer
son said â¢Civilization is a good woman,' and
Napoleon declared that what France most j
needed was a aeration of mothers.
"Frances Willard's life stands for at leapt
three treat purposesâ the destruction of the ;
liquor traffic, woman's suffrage and social
purity. Almost the last public act of her life
was the writing of a letter to the authorities
of Yale College protesting against certain |
loose customs concerning the use of strong
drink in the gTeat educational center. She fa
vored woman's suffrage because she believed
that woman, bearing her share of the burdens
of taxation, should be entitled to all of the
rights of citizenship, and because she thought
woman's vote a necessity in overthrowing the
drink cause, and was she not right?" In :
conclusion he said: "Christianity has made i
woman,- and I believe woman will save Chris- I
tianity from its foes."

A BUBGLAE CAPTJRED.
Got Away With His Plunder, but
Was Quickly Overtaken by
the Police.
The art of entering the rooom of An
drew Ruskl at 47 Sacramento street
brought Thomas Rlley, burglar and all
round bad man, into the clutches of the
law shortly after his unlucky visit, and
as he took with him two suits of clothes
and a rinp when he left the chances are
that he will be boarded by the State for
a yeat or two. Ruski. who had been out
to' the theater Saturday night, returned
rather late, and as he was going up to
his room passed Riley on the stairs.
When he reached the room he found the
dooor open and some wearing apparel
missing. He immediately ran after Riley,
and picking u-p Officer Charles O'Mally on
the street, chased Riley into the
Rococo saloon, where he was captured
with the stolen property in his posses
sion.

METERS THAT
PLUNDER THE
UNSUSPECTING
How Electric Light
Companies Wax
Unduly Fat.
Consumers Made the Vic
tims of a Conscience
less Device.
Mechanical Contrivances That
Will Cheat Without Human
Agency.
CANNOT BE MADE HONEST
One Company Forced to Make Res
titution to the Palace Hotal of
a Largo Sum.
Do you use electricity for light or
P Â°lf so you will do well to keep close
watch on the meter which tells the com
pany how much to charge you, for it is
a tricky little Instrument and as erratic ,
as a lovelorn maiden. Left to its own ;
devices it will play the most fantastic i
tricks with the indicator, such as register
ing a less quantity than is actually used ;
when only a few burners are lighted, :
while with a large number turned on it .
will register anywhere from 10 to 60 per
cent more than it ought to.
With such a bare-faced little fraud ;
plundering consumers unaided, it is easy j
to imagine what It is capable of doing
with a little friendly assistance. This as- ;
sistance may be any one of a hundred i
influences. For instance, one pole of a
strong magnet will greatly decrease its
speed, but the other pole, if brought in
close proximity, will start it off at a rec- i
ord-breaking gait. An old file, a length
of pipe, or even a wire left lying close i
to the meter will be the means of adding
10 or 20 per cent to the bill.
In short, the mechanical electric meter
is so thoroughly disreputable that it could j
not be honest if it tried. This statement
may sound rather strong, but it has the
Indorsement of no less an authority than
H. N. Sessions, expert for the Gas Con
sumers' Association, who says, in the â 
course of an article on the Watt meter in
the Journal of Electricity of August, 1597:
â¢'One point about the Watt meter, and,
perhaps, not the least in the favor of
the campanies selling light and power,
is the very small percentage fast that
their meter would have to record on large
loads to discount a large percentage slow,
and even the stoppage of the meter, on
small loads. For example, a meter read- .
ing 5 per cent fast on 600 lamps burning
for one hour, would discount an error of

50 per cent slow on ten lamps burning
Sl "One ir %ay ask why the companies
rely on meters that are liable to
register slow as well as fastâ in other
words, cheat them as well as' the con
sumers? This is easily answered. A me
ter is apt to register slow only when
a few lamps are burning, as. for instance,
in the day time when the company s em
ploye comes around to examine the me
ter to determine the amount of your bill,
or the meter man comes to test It. 1 nen
a limited number of lamps will be used.
But at night. wTien all your ineandes
cents. as well as your arc Â»&hts. are
blazing away, the little machine In the
basement is doing business for the com
pany with the greatest fidelity.
Mr Sessions states that there is no
mechanical meter, and in the very nature
of things never will be one that is abso
lutely correct, that is within one per
cent of cornet, while none of those now
in use are within three or four pe r â cent
of being correct. The only absolutely
correct method of registering electricity,
he sayÂ«. the old ztiic-copper-chemical
meter) but that is so expensive the com
panies have abandoned it for others
There are three mechanical meters
used by the companies in this city, the
Scheffe'r. Thomson and Schellenber all of
which register the watts used by a dial.
The Thomson is the meter most Kenerally
used and is fully : .s accurate as either of
the others, which need not be constroed
as a strong recommendation of us \ir
tues. Some of the largest consumers in
the city have, by experience, earned of
Its vagaries, with the result that ttre>
employ their <>wn experts t.Â» test the me
ters and compel the companies to strike
with the Palace
Hotel, which is the 'â¢' ! 'K t "f!, l ind j vidu . al^^
sumer in town. The bills for l'f h " n Â«
that hostelry with electricity will foot
up $30 000 a year, n sum that warrants
the keeping of careful watrh on the met
er^ There are thirteen used to register
the number of watts consumed, each at
tached to a different circuit. For several
rears the hotel management operated its
own electric light plant, but with the
starting up of competing companies tne
cost was rerluc.-.i. until it was deemed
advisable to buy electricity. The hotel
employs an expert electrician, who s
constantly inspecting the meters and his
tests are invariably compared with those
of the company's expert. Frequently
Mr Sessions has been called upon by the
management to assist its expert, .and
their figures have, at times, shown a
startling discrepancy from those of the
company's employe. The result has been
some big reductions in the bills, the
largest being that of last October, when
the company allowed a rebate of between
$1100 and $1200 on what it claimed.
This, and numerous other rebates, were
allowed without any protest, on the part
of the company, probably because it
knows that the hotel people are thor
oughly familiar with electricity and the
peculiarities of the meters, and conse
quently cannot be imposed upon. But
with smaller consumers, who do not em
ploy their own expert and rely entirel;
upon the employes of the various com
panies, the case is different, and com
plaints are daily occurrences.
One such case is that of the Orpheum
Theater, whose bills for lighting ran up
to such proportions, that recently it was
deemed advisable to change from one
company to another, with the result that
the bills showed an immediate decrease
of $30 to $40 each month.
But the wickedness of these meters
could be dwelt upon for an indefinite time,
and for the benefit of the victims of their
criminal work The Call will refer to them
again.

WINNERS AT THE TWO PARKS.
COURSING AT THE TWO PARKS
The Local Dogs Easily
Won the Day at
Ingleside.
The Eastern Racers Do Not
Seem to Improve in
Form or Speed.
A Large Crowd Bet Piles of Money
on the Result's and the Talent
Was HÂ«ppy-
At the Ingleside Coursing Park yester
day a large crowd saw the Eastern flyers
defeated by the local hounds and the
money that poured into the many pool
boxes running showed conclusively that
the talent are of the opinion that the
Eastern dogs will never equal the speed
of those raised on this coast. For wei:ks
past many dog followers suggested that
before giving an opinion they should wait
for the hare chasers to be acclimated,
but now that weeks and months have
passed and better form is not shown, the
betters are becoming aware that they
have repeatedly placed their money in
ihe wrong direction.
The improvement shown by Deckelman
& Panario's Glen Roy during the past
few months is a surprise, and although
the hound has never b-sen outside the
money he went clear down the line yes
terday and ran the final with Magic and
sold favorite on the o^urse. The talent
had everything their . wn way, with one
or two exceptions, and the bookies had
all they could attend to handling the
money. The crowd was large, and al
though the wt-athtr was raw the good
sport was enjoyed. A splendid run was
made by Lady Napoleon, a sapling,
against Johnny R., and if improvement
follows as is expected the Lady will be a
stake winner in the near future. The
odds on the Johnny R.-Bendalong course
in the second ties was $5 to $1 in favor of
Johnny R..Â»jjtl the talent suffered on the
result when the white nag was shown at
the instigation of Judge Grace. The hares
all ran well, some of them making their
A b 'â¦ of $100 to $20 was offered in the
Little *ngleside a day or two ago that
Johnny R. would not win the stake. Ihe
money was soon deposited and interest
was taken in the Johnny R. courses and
much money went to the bad on the nn
ish. It is supposed to be the bet that
made the hound such a favorite over
Bendalong, as the speed of the two
hounds does not warrant such uneven
money. On next Saturday and Sunday
an open stake and a sapling stake, $2.50
entrance, $600 added, will be run off. Sap
lings to be eligible must be whelped in
March, April and May, 1897. The draw
ing will take place Thursday evening.

A Rank Outsider Cap
tures the Finals at

For Freedom Easily Defeats
the Cracks, Rosette and

t
â¢
The New Wonder Has Just Been
Imported From Old
England.
â 
Great is For Freedom. The masterly
performance of this hound yesterday at
the Union Coursing Park set the large
crowd to talking. From being a rank
outsider at 30 to 1, he gradually came
to be noticed, and when he beat Ro
sette, the favorite, it was presto change,
and the English hound went against
Eclipse in the final course a red hot fa
vorite, and won with all the ease imag
inable.
For Freedom Is the property of the
Pasha kennels. He was purchased In
England for $500 and only arrived here
on Wednesday, having been in a ship
ping crate for six weeks. No one knew
anything of him. He was, however, in
great shape and showed phenomenal
speed. Rosette and Moondyne were the
favorites, and they had been heavily
backed for the finals. A few people had
the proper tip and were upon For Free
dom, but they were few and far be
tween. As soon as Rosette lowered her
colors to the British hound there was a
sudden effort upon the part of the talent
to back the new wonder, but the odds
had dropped to sto 4, and this kept
the betting down, especially as Eclipse,
who had pulled through to the finals by
luck and scratches, was to go against
For Freedom.
The wind was cold and swept across
the park with almost the force of a
gale. The hares were only fair, but
occasionally there was one that would
give the hounds a good course. With
the exceptions of For Freedom and the
nuky defeat of Patria at 5 to 1 in thÂ«
second round by Eclipse, the favorites
generally won. The betting was lively
and heavy and the ring presented a very
animated scene. The women were out
in large numbers and were much in evi
dence in the ring, where at times they
almost forced the betting upon their fa
vorites.
In the finals in the Puppy stakes Bo
nita proved herself superior to Master
Jack, which was quite a surprise, as the
latter had had an easy thing of it in
his courses against Quiver and Pastime.
Moondyne was rather heavily backed !â¢>*
the talent after Rosette's defeat to lower
For Freedom's colors, but he was un
equal to the task.
Rosette and Moondyne are looked upon
as two of the best, if not the fastest
hounds upon the coast; at least they have
been so considered, but now It is For
Freedom that every one is praising.
Following is the score:
Puppy stagesâ Second ties: Sandow beat
DempMT Lass, Bonita beat F-elle Seward, Pas
time beat Arrow and Master Jack beat Quiver.
Third ties: Bonita beat Sandow and Master
Jack beat Pastime. Final: Bonita won.
Open stakeâ Second ties: Kosette beat Rusty
Gold, !â¢"â â¢!â  Freedom heat Mountain Beauty.
Eclipse beat Patria, Santa Aiiuia beat Galla
gher. Theron beat Green Valley Maid and
Moondyke beat Commodore In ih<> bye. Third
ties: For Freedom beat Rosette. Eclipse L>-->ii
Santa Alicia and Mnomlyne beat Theron.
Fourth ties: For Freedom beat Moondyne tuid

is to be on a good American man-of-war
with a battle on hand and an enemy
worth whipping."
For a few years he gave up naval life
and tried to resign himself to stagnation
in a little Western town; but the experi
ment went hard with him. The only
water near the place was a miserable lit
tle stream that went sliding along in a
disconsolate way. A foot bridge crossed
it on the edge of the town; and there,
leaning over the railing, staring in a
homesick fashion at the strip of water
and puffing at his cigar, the ex-naval man
could be found at almost any hour of the
day Moat of his matter-of-fact Western
neighbors thought it was funny, but there
were a few who called it pathetic.
When news of the Franco-Chinese
trouble came the fighting blood in Mc-
Giffln's veins boiled and the West had to
go by the board.
"I'm dying for the salt water, anyhow."
he said, "and spoiling for a fight, ana I'm
going to take a hand in this shindy. I
may never have another chance, we're so
blamed peaceable in this generation."
He started for China, but the trouble
was ended before he had a chance to join
in, and then fate dropped him into the
place in the Chinese navy, where at last
he found the fight he had been looking
for. The Yalu was hot enough to satisfy
even him. Every one knows how he
fought; and when, after it was all over,
he came home a physical wreck and with
death staring him in the face, he had
only one regret.
"It was a great fight." he said to an old
friend, "but if I'd had a Yankee ship un
; <irr me and Yankee sailors beside me and
; a Yankee flag above me, we'd have shown
| the Japs what fi~hting means. I wisli I
could have been knocked to nieces under
thf stars and stripes, if it had to come.
Still, it was a pretty fight."
We've others like him in the navy of
which our Spanish friends speak so
slightingly; but if the fight is to come it's
a pity McGiffln couldn't have lived at
least a year longer and have had his
heart's desire.â New York Sun.

INIQUITY BEHIND
GILDED GATES
The Combined Influence of the
Churches United Against
Bacon Place.
An Effort Is Being MadÂ© to Cleans*
thÂ« Tenderloin Dis
trict.
The evil that has tainted the atmos
phere of what Is known as "The Tender
loin" section of this city and on which
so much has appeared in the public pa
pers during the period when Quincy and
Mary streets were being purified, has
once more assumed shape, in the united
action of the Protestant and Catholic
churches to drive this evil entirely out of
At present those who have been driven
out of Chinatown and the two streets al
ready mentioned have become domiciled
in what is known as Bacon place, a
small cul de sac running off Pine street
between Dupont and Kearny streets. Here
behind closed doors, so to speak, as the
alleyway is enclosed by gilded gates, are
concentrated over 100 of the most de
praved females known to this comraun-
Living off and following these unfortu
nate creatures are a set of male parasites,
opium fiends, thieves and all-round ras
cals, with police records. To keep this
class of social outcasts within bounds it
costs the taxpayers $tfx> a month by keep-
Ing sufficient police officers on constant
duty day and night, exclusively in this
So objectionable has this evil become
that the clergy of St. Mary's and of Grace
Cathedral are now united in making one
final effort to have the women removed,
and the entire section known as the "Ten
derloin" cleansed of all such influences.
The Chief of Police will be appealed to
once more, and should this fail then the
courts will be resorted to for relief.
TOOK CARBOLIC ACID.
Mrs. Sallie Silverman, While De
spondent, Attempts to End
Her Existence.
Mrs. Sallie Silverman of 439 Geary
street tried to commit suicide yesterday
by swallowing carbolic acid, but was pre
vented by her sister-in-law, Mrs. Wall
flsch. who dashed the phial containing
the poison from her uplifted hand. The
latter's hands were terribly blistered by
the acid, while the would-be suicide es
caped with a burned mouth and fac*.
Fearing she had swallowed some of the
poison Officer W. "W. Wilson was called
in and he hurriedly removed her to thÂ«
Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. Silverman. who is but 22 years of
age, separated from her husband a few
weeks ago. She had been living with
her three-year-old child and sister-in-law.
Becoming discouraged at her lot she
bought the poison and attempted to take
it. Mrs. Silverman said last evening that
she wanted to die. because she had trou
ble, but after being put to bed, the
thought of her child made her repent.
Dead, Dying or Worse.
Sam Thall. who is at present manager
for Jim Corbett, has just received a let

known theatrical man, now in Johannes
burg. I* is short, succinct and terse:
"Tell the boys I have quit the show busi
ness forever. Beg them not to write, but
just pray for me."
