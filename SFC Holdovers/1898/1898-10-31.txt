WIDESPREAD CONSTERNATION CAUSED BY MAYOR JAMES D. PHELAN'S OFFER TO
SELL OUT HIS PARTY AND TRADE HIS PATRONAGE FOR THE SUPPORT OF RAINEY
WOULD DELIVER THE PARTY
TO THE MEN WHOM HE HAS
DENOUNCED AS SCOUNDRELS
In His Speech at the Sacramento Convention the Mayor
Fiercely Assailed the Harney-Rainey Delegates
and Their Leaders, and Called Them the
Creatures of the Allied Corporations.
PHELAN. RAINEY & CO.. Polit
ical Purists. Kid Glove and
Silk Hat Politics a Specialty.
Such Is the sign that Mayor Phelan
â¢would hang in front of his office door
to attract the notice and secure the
political patronage of the honest voters
of San Francisco.
The news that Mr. Phelan had opened
; negotiations with Sam .Rainey, Major
I Harney and the men whom he has for
so long denounced as the rogues,
scoundrels . cutthroats and black
' guards of the local Democracy, came
' as a decided shock to the few good citi
i zens of this city who have persisted in
â¢ closing their eyes to the failings of the
: youthful but wealthy Mayor, and have
been willing to' accept his pretensions
: of personal purity as gospel truth. Now
â¢ that the mask has fallen and revealed
the supposed political purist to .be only
a poor, miserable political shyster, who
prefers dishonor to defeat, and who is
willing to betray those who have sup

that .the, .-'youthful and aristocratic
Mayor was honest from inclination and
not from necessity. .
Th^ members of the Non-Partisan
convention â or most of them â who held
Phelan up as the â white angel of
political purity, the personification of
public virtue and th bright and shin
ing light of oiHciai cleanliness, are ask
ing each other ha y far they have been
committed by Phelan's act in casting
discretion and past pretensions to the
winds to become an humble slave beg
ging for a smile, a word, a vote, at the
hands of Sam Rainey â an . willing and
anxious to exchange for the smile or
the kindly word or the much-needed
vote ilt dges tn thf- people and the
ectiv< spoils â¢ ' his office. It was
this same Non-Partisan convention
that indorsed the nominations made by
Phelan through his nominating conven
tion com of the members of his
Committee of One Hundredâ or at least
those of them who wore candidate
patronage offices. It is this patronage
that Phelan te using as a bribe to in
duce Rainey et al. to come to his arms
and be to him as a brother. Can it be
possible that the good, the pure and the
upright Mr. Phelan sought the indorse
ment of the Non-Partisan convention
for these seekers after patronage of
fices, having in mind a desire to thus
enhance the value of the goods that he
intended later to barter for the em
braces Of Sam Rainey?
There was once an honest burglar <
who had never killed his guards and j
escaped from the penitentiary, because
he had never been caught and sent to j
prison. There are those who, In the
light of recent events, are asking them

it has not been necessary for him to
do so. â  I
Once upon a time there was a white
pwan that posed as an object of beauty
and purity upon the surface of a calm
and peaceful mill pond. But the pond
went dry, leaving nothing but an ex
panse of black mud, and the swan, in
stead of seeking the fountain from
which the pure water that once filled
the pond had come, fought with the
swine for the worms that lay beneath
the mudâ and seemed to like the Job.

FRAUDS AT THE
OMAHA EXPOSITION
OMAHA. -Neb., Oct. 30.â A sensation
has developed in the Department of
Exhibits at the Exposition growing out
of the arrest of H. B. Hardt, assistant
manager of that department and gen
eral superintendent, on two warrants
charging him with forgery. He will be
arraigned to-morrow.
Hardt denies the charge, and in turn
declares he will make some counter
charges to-morrow that will pause
more of a sensation than his arrest in
Exposition circles. What these counter
charges are can only be surmised but
th -eneral impression is that Hardt

publicans for his election. If such was
the case he has evidently come to. the
conclusion that he does not need Re
publican support, fox he must know
that Republicans will not vote for a
man who seeks alliance with Sam
Rainey.
It was less than . three months ago
that Mr. Phelan went to Sacramento
on the occasion of the meeting of the
Democratic State Convention for the
purpose of making an open fight
against the seating of a delegation sent
to the convention by the Harney-
Rainey branch of the local Democracy.
He won the fight and was crowned
King of the Purists by the Examiner
and those of his following who had
helped him. steal the control of the
Democratic party in San Francisco. On
that occasion Mr. Ph â â â in placed himself
; on record before the people of the State
! by making a speech before the con
vention on the subject of the standing
of the men who composed the Harney-
Rainey delegation. It had been sug
gested that a compromise be effected
whereby both contesting delegations be ,
seated in the convention and that each
be entitled to half a vote. This offer

principles he claimed to represent. He
said:
"But there are some occasions on
which, we cannot, in justice to our
selves and to the principles for which
we stand, even breathe the word
'compromise.' You cannot jump half
way down Niag-aral"
Having put the temptation of the of
fered compromise behind him, Mr. Phe
lan turned his attention to Sam
Rai'ney with whom he is now flirting
and to whom he would betray the men
who have remained' his supporters be
cause they believed in his honesty and
sincerity of purpose. He spoke as -fol
lows:
"But for two years I have been
fighting hand-to-hand, at close quar
ters, with a power whose strength
and whose corrupt methods I have
learned to appreciate, and I feel, and
' I know in my heart and soul, that
the men who represent the Committee
of One Hundred are here arrayed
with a sincerity of purpose and a
strength capable of accomplishment
against that power. I do not impute
dishonor to other men, but I know
that in the city and county of San
Francisco there is a boss (Rainey);
that he seeks to control conventions;
that he is omnipotent in controlling
small bcdies of men, because his
means and weapons are such as you
13 I may not employ. I have seen

urer. I have seen the Board of

delegates:
"It has be*n asserted here that
there has been a delegation sent to
contest our seats, and that that power
of bossism sympathizes with them. I
can only tell from tne personnel of
that delegation whether it is true or
not. I feel, and I tell you here, that
the boss of San Francisco (Rainey),
the fountain-head of corruption, has
relations, and intimate relations,

the door of this convention for ad

The complaints allege that Hardt
changed the awards of Judges so that

remains that Hardt made these

; encore. Now, if Major Harney be
lieves that he speaks for the people
of San Francisco or represents any
thing here except the influences
which stand behind bossism, nur
tured by Southern Paoific money,
tnen I am mistaken. I, therefore,
accuse no gentleman. I simply tell
you what I know."
If Mr. Phelan still holds to the same
belief to which he gave expression In
i Sacramento he is how, In bidding for
the support of Major Harney, bidding
i for the support of the Southern Pacific
: Company, that hated corporation
; against which he has uttered so many
I threats and carried out so few <â¢* then;,
being so It may be expected that
! the Examiner will come out with a de
nunciation of the silk hat boÂ«fr who Is
j seeking the support of the corporation
| and is. willing to barter his honor and
j his patronage in order to get it. This
I should be its logical and only course,
for when the Harney-Rainey delega
tion had been turned down by the con
vention Mr. Phelan wrote to the Exam
iner over his own signature and said:
â¦â â¢J?he repudiation of Raineyism.
was decisive and stamps the charac
ter of the convention."
After using the columns of the paper
for the expression of such a sentiment
it is an act of base ingratitude for him
to kiss the Rainey foot at this late day
in the campaign.
In his speech at Sacramento Mr. Phe
lan made one last oratorical thrust at
his enemy. Sam Rainey, which is here
reproduced that a careful and thought
ful comparison may be made between
it and the circumstances of his recent
proposal to deliver the party organiza
tion and a portion of the patronage of
the city to Rainey in exchange for his
support. He said:
"What a mockery it -would be for
the boss of the city (Rainey) to send
a delegation her 3 reeking with the
bribe money of the water, gas and
electric companies, of the Southern
Pacific and of the other great powers,
seeking to control courts and Legisla
tures."
It will be observed that Mr. Phelan
mentions Rainey's intimate and repre
hensible relations with the allied cor
porations, so it may be safely inferred
that if he has not changed his views on
this point within the past few weeks he
is now seeking corporation support by
attempting to buy the good will and
support of Rainey and Harney.
Politics makes strange bed fellows.
The spectacle that Mr. Phelan is now
trying to prepare for the benefit of the
good citizens of San Francisco is him
self tucked in his little bed with the
burly form of Rainey on the one side
and that of Harney on the other.
And this is the man who wishes to be
the next Mayor of the great city of San
Francisco who p^ees as the model of
ficial of the municipality; who de
clares himself to be the friend of
honest workingmen, and who would
have it understood that he and he
alone possesses all of the virtues that
are necessary to the perfect man.

RAILWAY POOLS
ARE BENEFICIAL

M. Depew.
REVIEWS RECENT DECISION
HE SAYS IT TENDS TO CREATE
MONOPOLY.
With the Traffic Association Dis
solved, Stronger Lines Will
Force the Weaker to
the Wall.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 30.â Chauncey M.
Depew, having made a study of the de
cision by the Supreme Court on traffic
associations, gives his opinion as fol-
lows:
The decision of the Supreme Court ne
cessitates the dissolution of the Joint
Traffic Association as at present consti
tuted. Broadly stated, the decision means
that there shall be no association among
or agreement in regard to either the
maintenance of rates or the prevention of
rate cutting or the prevention of dis
criminations against weak shippers in
favor of strong ones or against small lo
calities and those along the lines in favor
of the gr<>J.t terminal cities.
The object of the Joint Traffic Associa
tion was, first, to assist the interstate
commerce act; second, to prevent secret
rate cutting:, and third, to prevent the
favoritism to great cities and to great
shipping firms which had been gradually
wiping out intermediate towns and the
email business men.
It Is absolutely necessary for the rail
roads of the country to know thn move
ment of traffic ar.d traffic conditions as
tn freight which is to '"be moved at the
different reservoirs where it is concen
trated. It is also necessary that they
know whether and why this freight is
securing an outlet, if for export, through
the Guff of Mexico or by the Canadian
route, or by the Atlantic seaboard.
It will be necessary, therefore, that some
association should exist as a statistical
bureau for the purpose of gathering this
information and presenting it in frequent
report* to the lines which are members.
All that the railways ask is that under
a form of voluntary agreement or a pool-
Ing law they may be permitted to arrange
among hemselvea so that there shall be
uniform rates to everybody who ships
over thÂ« various lines for the same serv
ice. In other words, as the railroads are
ef-mi-public corporations, then the publics
should be treated upon lines the same as
the Government treats people who use the
postofflce or the- same as people are
treated who use the telegraph lines, viz.:
Uniform rates and. the same treatment
governing for like service.
The great error of the people who
framed the interstate commerce act is
supposing that in preventing the rail
roads agreeing upon rates and having a
pool they are getting lower rates for the
people and preventing discrimination?.
Xnelr legislation proceeded upon the
thought that there is but one line, for in
stance, between New York and Chicago,
whereas there are eight lines. Now, It is
possible for a combination of capitalists
to take the weak line and ship its product
over that line upon an agreemtn much be
low the current rates. The weak lines
may be In the hands of a receiver and
have no obligations to pay either upon its
Btock or upon Its bondsâ ln other word",
upon tho invested capital which built it.
The other lines cannot afford to go into
bankruptcy by following this ratÂ« and so
they let the weaker lines have this traffic,
or they conduct their own traffic upon
reasonable rates.
The effect of this is very soon evident.
The rates which these big shippers get
over this bankrupt line enable them "to
make the'r product so much cheaper than
the people who are situated upon the
other lines, or who send to market from
other places than the terminus of the
bankrupt line, that they drive them out of
business. Then the anti-trust, antl-'-nr
poration, anti-combination people by their
own device have created a combination
and a trust. This process has been going
on ever since the interstate commerce
act and " the anti-pooling combination
were in force. If the process continues
the present rapid progress ot the con
solidation of every product into the hands
of one concern or a few men will con
tinue, until both the producer and con
sumer of tho country would have their
prices fixed by the combination Jn tho
various products of the people. If the
eight lines, howfcver. were in a position
where they could protect each other and
the public in giving equal opportunities
by all lines, then the enterprises and
energy and natural facilities of inter
mediate places with smaller expenses and
less capital in their business, with the
owners attending to their own affairs,
would result in a wide distribution of in
dependent business, in the fanner find
ing many competitors for the produce of
his farm and the railways having thou
sands of customers instead of a very few.
The objection to a pooling law has
always been that tho railways would

combine to raise prices. It is apparently
useless for th<- railroad man to say what
he knows to be a fact, that the demands
of the different markets, the competition
of the waterways and the conditions of
the different centers at which freight is
gathered make it impossible for the rail-
ways to raise rates. But the railways are
not only willing, but maintain, that this
danger should be obviated by. securing the
Government control over all pooling
rates. The railways ask for no pooling
law except upon these conditions:
First- that the pooling contract shall
not be made until it has been approved by
the Interstate Commerce Commission,
and,
Secondâ That if the rates prove oppres
sive or unjust in the traffic which is
Subject i" the pool, the Interstate Com
merce Commission shall have the right
to step in and right the wrong, if there
is any, or abrogate the po >1.
The only objection I have ever heard is
that the Government cannot be trusted.
Certainly there has been nothing in the
conduct of the interstate commission]
since its formation which justifies such j
a charge. If such a charge is true, then
ail governement is a failure when great
risibilities devolve upon it. The rail
do not care how much the Inter-
state Commerce Commission is strength
ened it" in its present form it is not en
tirely satisfactory. The tailroads ara
anxious that the commisslpn should be
as strong and judicial as possible. The
nearer it approaches the absolutely in
dependent form of the Supnemo Court of
the United States, the betttr it will suit
the railroads. ' /
Failing, however, in legislation on the
suuject and supposing that the law re
mains as the Supreme Court has decided,
against railroad pooling and agreements
under the present statutes, the natural
tendency of the railroads will be to follow
the general trend of the other business of
the country. This' will not be a rapid
process, but this tendency will be sure.
The weaker lines will be unable to stand
the strain of irregular and wholly uncer
tain or unremunerative compensation
which follows. They will not be able to
raise the money which the stronger lines
can to. take advantage of every invention,
every improvement, every elimination of
grade crossing, every powering of grade,
every taking uut of curves, every substi
tution of machinery and automatic appli
ances which can cheapen the cost of car
rying. So they will be bankrupted and
ultimately absorbed ,by the stronger lines,
and the business'of the country .-will be in
the hands of the latter. This absorption
and the consequent formation of a few gi
gantic corporations to do the carrying
business of the country would threaten
another railway agitation, whether wise
or not. and a long period of disturbance
of businessâ that sort of disturbance
which makes bad times, because the busi
ness man has factors to deal with in leg
islation and in uncertain rates which
make it impossible for the wisest head to
forecast the future.
This decision will be a fortunate docu
ment, if Congress in a calm, broad way
will take up the whole question and so
legislate that, the public and railways and
their investors and their employes may
be fully protected; that large freedom for
agreement may be granted to the railways
among themselves under strict supervision
and rigid control of the Government ' of
the T'nited States. If the Government is
not equal to the task of impartial super
vision of this business under these condi
tions it better retire from the thought of
rerunning- the responsibilities for Cuba,
Porto Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines.

the time of ' the Ist of
February, but >n was de
clined. Arrant "\e landing
and camping o.- an forces
have been compl< Â«^,u^ Â although
some of the de\. have not been
worked out yet. Â£. .ie recall at this time
of Colonel Heclref and Colonel Lee from
Havana is pimply to secure their aid
here in the working out of these de
tails.
General Fitzhugh Loe came to Wash
ington from Richmond last night, but
remained only until an early train this
morning. His business was purely pri
vate and he called on no War Depart
ment officials. Important orders will
be sent him early this week relating to
the movement of his corps, but as yet
the War Department has not disclosed
their nature.
HAVANA, Oct. 30.â Colonel Hecker
and Colonel Lee of the United States
Special Transportation Commission,
received cablegrams from Washington
by the first steamer available!. The
messages, which were from Secretary
Alger, were very brief â simply direct
ing the recipients to report to the War
Department â and there is considerable
perplexity as to the object of the recall.
Answers were immediately cabled to
Washington, but up to the hour of fil
ing this dispatch no rejoinder had been
received, thus leaving the matter of
Colonel Hecker's departure doubtful,
though Colonel Lee will leave to-mor
rov.- by the Ward line steamer Seneca.
The supposition is that the death of
Colonel George W. Waring Jr. in New
York City has necessitated some
change in the plans of the War Depart
ment. General Wade and Lieutenant
Colonel Clous had a long conference
with Colonel Lee and Colonel Hecker
this afternoon. Colonel Lee's departure
will leave the commissions on trans
portation and the selection of camp
sites without a chairman and the quar
termaster's department without a dis
bursing officer. Dr. O. Kciley, upon
whom the chairmanship of the two
commissions will devolve, is now head
quartermaster.
The impression is general among the
Americans here that the recall of Col
onels Lee and Hecker at this particular
Juncture is highly significant.

LARGE FIELD FOR FRAUD
SYSTEM DISCREDITABLE TO THE
GOVERNMENT.
Mail Service in Alaska During the
Past Year Shown to Have
Been Irregular and
Unreliable.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 30.â The im
mense work of transporting the mails
throughout the United States is dealt
with in the annual report of Second As
sistant Postmaster General William S.
Shallenberger, which was made public
to-day. The main feature of the re
port is a vigorous arraignment of exist
ing star route methods. Mr. Shallen
berger refers to the present system of
speculative bidding for star routes as
"discreditable to the Government." He
says the bidders cut a little under the
regular contract prices and risk being
able to sub-let at a profit. The com
petition results in the greater part of
these contracts being awarded at very
low rates, the accepted bidders or their
agents often using deceit and misrepre
sentation in securing sub-contracts
from poor and ignorant men as prin
ciples and sureties. The report re
cites the subsequent steps, saying the
sub-contractors, if complaining of
greater requirements than they under
stood, are threatened with the penal
ties by the contractors or if the sub
contractors attempt service with inade
quate equipment, fines are imposed
upon them. Finally, if the sub-con
tractors abandon the routes or the de
partment is compelled to remove
them and employ temporary service,
the cost of which is charged to the
contractors, the latter in turn take ac
tion against the sub-contractors, who
may thus lose the little property they
have.
'Then there are the unscrupulous con
tractors," it is added, "who fail to pay
their carriers, which causea hundreds of
claims against the contractors flled in
this office and necessitates voluminous
correspondence to get the claims ad-
Justed. Again, there will be a bidder
who, in his inexperience and eagerness,
will make his bid at rates lower than
those for which he can secure sub
contracts. There follows a general
failure to perform the service awarded
him, and the department is put to
trouble and expense of arranging tem
porary service and reletting the con
tracts."
The conclusion drawn is that the
I profit to contractors must be consider
able, and It the department could deal
dirÂ«ukly witV (Vr.mfcÂ» who do tht; worK,
the total ar mm paid by the Govern
ment being Vut into the service, with
out any margin to speculative middle
men, it would undoubtedly produce bet
ter mail service. It is conceded that
exclusion of speculative bidders would
increase the cost to the Government,
and recent examinations at the re
quest of Congress indicate the addi
tional cost would be $1,500,000, which,
however, would go into effect gradually.
The belief is expressed that a con
siderable larger sum for faster trans
portation would be well expended, if it
resulted in improved equipment, "as
many of the vehicles now used in carry
ing the malls present such a dilapi
dated and disreputable appearance as
to be a strung argument in condemna
tion of the present system."
Legislation is recommended, requiring
all such bidders to reside m or contig
uous to the route covered, or formally
agree to reside and personally super
vise the service, and authorizing re
fusal to accept bids, deemed excessive^
The report shows the number of mail
routes at the close of the year was 33,
795, total mileage 380,381, and averaging
on each route nine trips per week.
There were 434,332,691 miles traveled on
these routes, costing almost $107 a mile
of length each, or almost 12 cents a mile
traveled. The total annual rate of ex
penditure for both routes within the
United States and in the foreign mail
service was $53, 823,454.
Discussing Alaska, Mr. Shallenberger
says the mail service on the overland
route from Juneau by Dyea to Circle,
providing for letter mail only, was ex
tremely unsatisfactory, the contractor
falling to render the required number
of trips, and those performed were ir
regular and unreliable, serious com
platnts following. The arrangement
with the Canadian Postofnce Depart
ment regarding a monthly exchange of
letter mall between Dyea and Dawson
also fell below expectations. To secure
regular service in the Alaskan interior
relay stations were established at fre
quent Intervale along the routes and
equipped to meet all emergencies. This
was done with the consent of Canada.
The establishment of an overland mail
route from Cooks Inlet or Prince Wil
liam Sound through the interior to the
Yukon River has been considered, but
it is not practicable to establish it at
present.
The expenditures to railroads for mail
transportation, so far as shown by ac
counts stated to September 30, was $30,
440.537. and the estimate for railroad
transportation for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1900, is $33,275,000. A defi
ciency of nearly $1,000,000 in this fiscal
year for transportation is probable.
Concerning the railway mail Rervice,
the report shows there were 1268 miles
of traveling poÃtofflces, and makes a
recommendation for a reclassification
of thp service and for legislation re
quiring newspaper publishers to make
primary separation of their papers and
periodicals for mailing, requiring postal
clerks to -wear badges instead of the
present regulation caps, and for the
general establishment of postal stations
in railroad depots.
For ocean mail transportation in the
next fiscal year $2,154,000 is estimated.
Over fourteen million letters and post
cards have been distributed in transit
in our international sea postoffices and
only 1500 errors were reported.

Immense Damage to Property and
Many People Injured by
Flying Debris.
LONDON, Oct. 30.â During a severe
storm last night a small area, about half
a mile square, around Denmark Hill,
Camberwell, London, was visited by a
cyclone. Cabs were overturned, windows,
doors, lampposts, trees and chimneys
were blown down and a number of houses
unroofed.
The contents of numerous hawkers'

SEA TELEGRAPHY
REVOLUTIONIZED
Rapid Transmission of
Information.
GENERAL GREELY'S REPORT
VALUE OF THE SINE-WAVE
SYSTEM.
Experiments Prove the Superiority of
Alternating Cur'-ents Over
the Methods 1 ow
In Use.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.â One point
in the annual report of General Greely
has escaped public attention owing to
its disassociation Avith the late war. It
relates to the discoveries of two young
physicists, Professor A. C. Crehore and
Lieutenant Colonel George O. Squier,
volunteer signal officer, who have lately
pursued, under the direction of the
chief signal officer of the army, certain
scientific investigations that promise
to work a revolution in methods of
ocean telegraphy. General Greely ex
presses his belief that these discoveries
and inventions have assumed such
form and phase as to be of the greatest
value to the commercial world. The
discoveries outline the true scientific
methods of telegraph known as the
sine-wave system.
The first experiments were made at
the Artillery School, Fort Monroe, Vir
ginia, and were discussed theoretically
in 1897 under the title of the "synchrono
graph," a new method of rapidly trans
mitting information by the alternating
currents. The next step was the test
ing of this system on a long telegraph
line, and for this purpose Professor
Crehore and Colonel Squier visited
England, where they were afforded
every facility for experimental work
over the Government telegraph lines
through the courtesy of the Postmaster
General and the distinguished electri
cian. Chief Engineer Preece.
The experiments, the report sets
forth, proved conclusively the superior
ity of a modern alternating current
smooth wave, the typical form of which
is a simple sine wave as compared with
the system now exclusively used
throughout the world in code teleg
raphy. Under the sine wave system
words were sent and received over a
line 1100 miles long at a rate of over
3000 words per minute. Under this new
system the speed of the Wheatstone
commercial receiver was increased as
much as threefold when operated under
identically the system of. the old code
of telegraphy. The superiority of the
sine wave having been decided by ex
perimental apparatus, the next step is
to construct transmitters for actual
commercial conditions. Two special ap
paratuses were devised, one for operat
ing land lines and the other for the
transmission of messages over long
cables. The cable transmitter was com
pleted and land instruments advanced
whe<n the late war interrupted prog
reps, which has only lately been re
newed by direction of General Greely.
The first practical tests of the cable
transmitter have just been made
through the courtesy of George Clap
perton and other officials of the Com
mercial Cable Company of New York.
The experiments were made over the
cable betweeen New York City and
Canso, which had a length of 827 knots,
and electrical resistance of 13.700 ohms,
and an electric distributing capacity of
231 microfards. These tests were made
between September 25 and October 16,
1896.
The change from existing telegraphic
methods consists in the substitution for
the present appliance of a transmitter
sending smooth waves, such as are ob
tained in alternating currents working,
without maki^-- any other changes
whatever in the elements of the present
system. The conditions in the trans
mission of messages over long cables
are distinctly and wideJy different from
those on aerial lines. The necessity of
increased speed over ocean cables, the
report continues, while not generally
appreciated, is strikingly obvious when
examined from a commercial stand
point. Since every cable spanning the
Atlantic costs several million dollars
the value of any discovery that will in
crease the working power of these ca
bles is at once apparent.
General Greely says he has no hesita
tion in expressing the opinion that the
sine wave system, which also admits
of easy duplexing, will, within a year
or two, increase very materially the
working capacity of every cable to
which it is applied.
FURTHER SPACE FOR
AMERICAN EXHIBITS
General Commissioner Peck Reports
Having Secured Every Conces
sion Required.
CHICAGO, Oct. 30.â Director of Exhi
bits J. H. McGibbon received yesterday
from General Commissioner F. W. Peck,
at Paris, a telegram stating that he had
been allotted 35,000 square feet of addi
tional floor space for United States ex
hibitors, and had also secured every spe
cial concession demanded. The telegram
was also sent as a contradiction to a
number of reports which have recently
caused considerable misunderstanding.
â  The floor space for American exhibitors
at present amounts to 210,000 square feet.
In the fall of last year the exposition
officials said they could grant the United
States only 100,000 square feet, but before
leaving Paris Major Handy had secured
an additional allotment which increased
the total to 175,000 square rfeet. The many
requests for space and the character of
the exhibits caused a renewal of the de
mands upon the exposition officials, and
although they declared the 175,000 Bquare
feet was the final allotment, Mr. Peck,
through his recent visit to Paris has se
cured an additional floor space of 35,000
square feet, which swells the total to
210,000, besides ground for a Government
building, space for an agricultural pa
vilion on which agricultural implements
will be Installed and a complete and fully
equipped railroad train in operation.
MAN AND WOMAN HELD
UP BY HIGHWAYMEN

While Proceeding to a
Danoe.
REDDING, Oct. 80.â Two masÂ»d high
waymen held up Bent Graham Â£id a lady
companion on Churn Creek, eight miles
north of here, at 8 o'clock last night. They
had started for Redding to go to a dance,
and on the road this side of Churntown
the highwaymen stepped out of the brush
by the roadside and, with revolvers point
ed at Graham and his companion, ordered
them to stop. The lady was much fright
ened, but Graham quietly yielded to being
searched, and was relieved of $40 and his
watch.
The section where the holdup occurred
is lonely and thickly wooded, and the
escape of the robbers will be easy. Red
ding officers have grone out, but ft is not
expected that the search will amount to
anything*

SILVER QUESTION
STILL A MENACE
Ex-President Harrison
on the Subject.
WARNS THE INDIANA VOTERS
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS MEANS
DISASTER.
i
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS. Oct. 30.â Chairman
Hernley of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee recently invited ex-
President Harrison to take part in the
campaign. The ex-President has sent
Mr. Hernley a letter Baying that im
portant legal business will occupy his
time for several weeks. He discusses
national questions as follows:
In New York, where I was recently, the
Democratic party has pushed aside the
free silver question and is making a
campaign upon the theory that national
issues, and especially the free silver ques
tion, are not involved. In Indiana the
case is quite different. The Democratic
party here has affirmed with emphasis
the Chicago platform of 1596, and in our
own district 1 understand the Democratic
candidate for Congress is strongly urg
ing upon tho people the issue of free sil
ver coinage at the ratio of 16 to 1. Now,
whatever may be the case in New York,
here a Democratic success would dis
tinctly set forward and strengthen the
propaganda for free silver coinage. In
New York many gold Democrats who
affiliated with the Republican party in
1896 are saying that the silver issue is
not involved, but men of that faith cer
tainly cannot say so in Indiana.
It seems to me that it would be a dis
tinct setback for the cause of honest
money and a distinct injury to the State
of Indiana if, in a year so prosperous as
this, a majority of our people should
.'ote for the free coinage of silver. Hon
est money Democrats who have hoped
that the issue might not meet them again
in a Democratic national convention, will
help to make its appearance there cer
tain if they aid in securing a Democratic
victory In Indiana this year.
The apparent settlement of that issue
in 1896 contributed immensely to bring
the prosperity which we now enjoy, to
give confidence to capital, and to secure
work and wages in good money to the
workingman. These classes were awake
then to the vital importance of this issue
and responded with an overwhelming
negative. It would be an unpleasant
thing to contemplate if, while in the en
joyment of the fruits of that victory, any
of those who supported the cause of
sound money in 1896 should now, either
from lethargy or pique, or through the
influence of minor questions, be led either
actively or passively to give their aid
to the revival and perpetuation of this
disturbing influence.
I cannot understand why any Republi
can in the State should withhold his influ
ence or votes from the Republican ticket.
Small differences as to the details of ad
ministration and smaller differences grow
ing out of personal disappointments
should be put utterly aside.
Another consideration, I think, should
strongly influence the voters of the State.
The nation went into war with Spain,
supported by the moral sentiment or the
freat majority of our people of all parties.
t was felt that as to Cuba there was a
distinct call upon the United Btates to in
terpose for the ending of Spanish cruelttes
and misgovernment there. The firing
lines have been withdrawn and our ships
are largely In our own harbors after
achieving on land and sea victories that
have given increased fame to American
arms; but our foreign relations are still
acute and unsettled, and the appeal to
which the response was so generous and
non-partisan at the beginning of the war,
to stand by our own country and its exec
utive and administrative officers, should
be felt and responded to. Our election re
sults Bhould not give, or even seem to
give encouragement to those who would
find in our discords and divided counsels
their advantage. Our British cousins
have i Â»rood habit of standing by when
tfteir nation is conducting delicate and ir
rittatlng foreign qestions. Very truly
yours, BENJAMIN HARRISON.

IMPORTANCE OF
THE NEXT HOUSE
Sound Money Majority
Imperative.
H. H. HANNA SCENTS DANGER
VITAL ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE â¢
OBSCURED.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 30â A
statement regarding the importance of
the election of a sound money House
this autumn was made public to-day
by H. H. Hanna, the chairma,n of the
executive committee of the Indianap
olis Monetary Conference. Mr. Hanna
said:
1 regard it as of the greatest importance
to the business prosperity of the country
that the House of Representatives cnoaea
next month should have a clear majority
for sound money. This issue Is being ob
scured in some quarters, and an effort is
being made to evade it. It cannot be
evaded in Congress, nor could the effect
of a silver victory be obscured in its in
fluence upon the prosperity of the coun
try. It is almost, if not quite, as impor
tant as it' was in 1896 that the friends of
sound money should act together to se
cure a majority in the next Congress. The
country is upon the threshold of a revival
of business activity which -will mean work
for many hands and increased wages in
many pockets. The election of a silver
majority in the House might not check
this revival absolutely in respect to cur
rent production," but it would exercise a
far-reaching effect by preventing the or
ganization of new enterprises requiring
time for their development. The abandon
ment of such enterprises would ron^r iwni
all industries and interests by diminish
ing the demand tor capital and tne em
ployment of labor.
What I consider important, and what I
think the business community generally
conslders important, is that the majority
of the next House shall be pledged to
organize the House for sound money. The
really important question is not so much
the exact shade of opinion professed by
a candidate upon the money question, but
whether he intends to vote for a Speaker
who is a friend of the gold standard or a
supporter of the free coinage of sliver.
This- question, in my opinion, ought to be
squarely answered by every candidate for
Congress: "Will you vote under any cir
cumstances for a candidate for Speaker
who is favorable to the free coinage of
silver?" A candidate who answers it in
the affirmative or who evades it should
not receive a single souud-money vote
from either party, no matter what haze
he seeks to throw over his personal views
upon the silver problem.
I think the importance of the election
of a sound-mo Hey House is beginning to
be appreciated throughout the country,
and that the issue will be more distinctly
drawn during tho closing days of the cam
paign than it has thus far been.
Mr. Hanna concludes by saying that
he has received letters referring to the
importance of the issue and the neces
sity for a sound money victory from
the following: Ex-Senator Edmunds
of Vermont, John Claflin of* New York,
ex-Senator John M. Palmer of Illinois,
William E. Dodge of New York, Seth
Low of New York, John C. Bullitt of
Philadelphia, John K. Cowan of Balti
more, Stuyvesant Fish of New York
and ex-Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Charles S. Hamlin of Boston.
Hamlin's is perhaps the most pithy of
the letters received. It says:
I believe it to be of the highpst Im
portance that a sound-money Congress be
elected in the coming flection. The silver
delusion is on the WL..ie ancT most of the
people begin to comprehend that it would
be more difficult to get cheap dollars than
dollars of the present standard; that they
would have to work harder and receive,
in the end, less remunerationâ ln other
words, that free silver would affect th<Â»m
Just" as does a protective tax. Every effort
should be made to bring out the voters to
the caucuses and the polls that the real

VIENNA, Oct. 30.â The death is an

outbreak of the bubonic plague in Vienna-ANTI-SEMITE
PAPERS TRY TO
CAUSE WRATH
Would Arouse Hostile
Demonstrations.
COURT OF CASSATION LASHED
TRENCH GENERALS THE PREY
OF DESIGNING FORGERS.
Dreyfus Decision Seems to Have De
layed a Solution of the
French Cabinet
Crisis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 30.â Nowhere is there !
any sigm of agitation to-day. The city !
Is quiet. The anti-Semite papers vainly j
endeavor, by abusing- the Judges of the j
Court of Cassation, to lash the public |
into a hostile demonstration, but the \
people seem rather inclined to resent j
the culpability or imbecility of the high I
officers of the general staff, who al
lowed themselves to become the prey
of unscrupulous forgers.
This refers especially to the officers
deputed to investigate the Dreyfus
affair.
It is believed even now that impor
tant facts are being concealed in order
to shield the headquarters staff.
Most of the Paris papers approve the
decision of the Court of Cassation, al
though the Gaulois and the Eclair de
clare that even now revision is by no
means certain. The JLiberte bows to
the decision, but does not think it will
end the agitation. The Figaro an
nounces that Comte Esterhazy has been
deprived of his membership in the Le
trion of Honor.
The Dreyfus decision seems to have
flelayed a solution of the Cabinet crisis.
M. de Freycinet is again hesitating
to accept the portfolio of Minister of
War on the ground that in view of the
rnlo the Protestants have played in the
Dreyfus case it would be Inadvisable
for two Protestants, himself and M.
Ribot. to hold the portfolios of War
and Justice.
COURT OF CASSATION
MAY SUMMON DREYFUS
PARIS. Oct. 30.â 8y Saturday's de
cision the Court of Cassation obtains
the most absolute control over the
Dreyfus case. It can demand and ex
amine any documents whatever, In
cluding- the dossier, of any case bearing
upon the Dreyfus matter, and can ex
amine, under oath, any witness, how
ever high his position.
In short, if the court makes a sin
cere use of its powers the truth will
have a much better chance of being:
discovered than would have been the
case had it merely ordered reÂ» r iÂ«ion be
fore another, courtmartial, whose mem
bers might have been actuated by a de
sire to shield the general staff.
Having concluded its inquiry it can
present a new dossier to either civil
or a military court for the final de
cision. Its proceedings will not be j
public, and there can, therefore, be no
objection to an examination of the al
leged secret dossier, if this is still in
existence, while the numerous generals ;
who have expressed their belief in the i
guilt of Dreyfus will now be called on l
to explain the grounds of their convic
tions.
Although the liberation of Dreyfus
has not been ordered, the court can or
der him brought to France at any mo
ment, and will probably do so at an
early stage of the Inquiry.
The court refrained fmm ordering his
release on Saturday because it would
have been an assumption of his inno
cence.
Taul de Roulede of the Patriotic
"League turned the patriotic manifes
tation at Ln Hourget to-day in memory
of the soldiers who fell there in the
Franco-Prussian war of lftlo, into a
revolutionary demonstration against
the decision f >f the Court of Cassation.
Marcel Habert, member of the Cham
ber of Deputies, followed with a still
more inflammable harangue. There
were, however, no disorders.
As President Faure left the Grand |
Opera House to-night about 11 o'clock |
he was greeted with prolonged shouts I
of "Vive l'Armee" and "A has le i
Juifus."
Count Esterhazy. it is reported, has
written to several citizens demanding
money under the throat of exposure.
SECRET DOSSIER WOULD
CONVICT GEN. MERCJER
LONDON. Oct. 3i.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Times, pointing out
that a serious dilemma has now de
veloped in the "reyfus affair, says:
"If the secret dossier is now com
municated to the Court of Cassation, it
is conceivable that it may incriminate
Dreyfus, but i m .11 certainly convict
General Merrier, the Minister of -War
at the tim<Â» of conviction of Dreyfus, of
a criminal violation of law in communi
cating to the courtmartial documents
that were not communicated to Drey
fus and his counsel.
"It is said that In order to shield
General Mercier, who acted thus owing
to hifi Weakness <>r his ignorance, that
all subsequent Ministers of War have
adopted an obstinate attitude. If, on
tho other hand, there has never been
Â» secret flossier, the whole case rests
on the bordereau and must fall to the
ground. How, then, since Lieutenant
Colonel Henry's admission of forgery,
I the general still have declared
Dreyfus' guilt?
"The allegation that the dossier, if
therr- he one, contains a letter from
Emporor William to Colonel Scw.ir
koppen fOerman military attache in
Paris) is utterly improbable. In view of
the Emperor's character and habits he
would never .have written to a military
attache. "
LAKE CITY PROFITS"
BY A MINING BOOM
Discovery of Pay Dirt Doubles the
Town's Population in a
Few Days.
ALTURAS. Oct. 30.-The arrival o* a
Redding capitalist named Brown, accom
panied by a mining .-xpert named Robin
son, at the newly discovered mines in the
vicinity of L,ake City has thrown that
vicinity into a fever of excitement. Some
months ago the announcement was made
that a valuable metal had been discov
ered in the vicinity of the town. Citizens
began to stake out claimn at once. Some
of the quartz was sent to an assayer In
Ban Francisco, and the result has in
terested outside capitalists and miners.
Brown and Robinson are well pleased
with the prospects and are arranging for
the erection of a stamp mill at once.
. People from all sections are coming to
the mines, and the population of Lake
City has been nearly doubled in the last
few days.
The assay shows the quartz to contain
a large percentage of silver and will go
$27 to the ton. The location is easy of
access and supplies can be obtained with
out difficulty.

BVENOS AYRES, Argentina (via Gal
veston, Tex.), Oct. 30.â A dispatch from
Santiago announces that the protocol
about the Puna de Atacama dispute has
been signed. The protocol establishes
that in case the conference of commis
sions is without result each country will
appoint one commissioner, who will pro
i ceed to fix the boundary of Puna accord
j ing to the treaty of IS'.KJ.
I- It is announced that the Chilean Gov
ernment will request Congress to annul
the law by which Puna was proclaimed
Chilean territory. Next Monday the
Chilean Congress will discuss the proto
co), which will shortly afterward be sub
mitted to the Argentine Congress. Both
will approve it.
When all is concluded there will be a
manifestation of Argentine-Chilean friend
ship, with participation of the army and
navy of both countries: Presidents Roca
â  Err^suriz will meet at Mendoza.
U.PARAISO (via Galveston), Oct. 30.â

tion.
The Chilean Commissioners carry in
structions to promote commercial and in

PRESIDENT HOPEFUL
OF EARLY SETTLEMENT
'â  Believes the Paris Negotiations Will
Soon Be Brought to a Con
clusion.
â WASHINGTON. Oct. 30.â An informal
session of the CabineJ was held' to-day.
The President embraced the opportunity
afforded by the presence of several mem
bers of the Cabinet to discuss with them
the forthcoming annual reports. The
members of the Cabinet present were
Secretaries Alger, Long, Blisa and Wil
son and Postmaster General Smith, As
sistant Secretary of the Navy Allen, Ad
jutant General Corbin and Surgeon Gen
eral Sternberg were with the President
during a part of the evening.
The peace negotiations at Paris were
referred to, but were not seriously con
sidered, it is understood. This statement I
is borne out by the fact that Secretary !
of State Hay was not a party to the !
conference. It is authoritatively stated j
that none of the developments in the
Paris situation have arrived here to-day.
The President is said to believe that the
negotiations will be brought to a satis- j
factory conclusion sooner, perhaps, than
is generally expected.
TWO CONSTRUCTIONS ON
BLANCO'S RECENT ORDER
Refusal to Discharge Spanish Troops
in Cuba May Be a Pretext
for Delay.
NEW YORK, Oct. 30.â The Herald's
I Washington' correspondent telegraphs:
i Two constructions are put upon the re-
I cent order of General Blanco that Span
j ish troops in Cuba shall not .be dis
j charged, but shall first go to Spain and
receive their pay.
This cancels the previous order of Oc
tober 4, Baying such Spaniards ci* desired
could remain In Cuba. Should the troops
choose to return under this latter order
to Spain, it would give the Spaniards a
pretext for asking longer time for the
evacuation, which may be their desire.
On the other hand, it is urged by a high j
"War Department official that the cause i
of this order may have been the inability
of Blanco to pay them and the hope,
therefore, that they would desert and
thereby relieve the Spanish Government
of further obligation. The Spanish regu
lar troops in Cuba, now much scattered,
number about 85,775.
THREATS OF LYNCHING
MADE AT SANTA YNEZ
Citizens Enraged by the Crimes of an
Indian Incendiary, Who Con
fesses His Guilt.
I.OS OL.IVOS, Oct. 30.â The house and
barn of T. Z. McMurray in Santa Aguerla
Canyon, three miles east of Santa Ynez,
â were burned last Sunday while the owner
was away from home. Indications led to
the suspicion that incendiarism covered
a robbery. Later in the week MeMurray
found a San Jacota Indian, Jose Cer
bantez, riding in his cart, which had been
missing since the fire. He got out a
pearch warrant and found a wagon-load
of stolen goods in the Cerbantez house.
The Indian was brought before Justice
Lyons at Ballard and pleaded guilty to
charges of robbery and incendiarism.
He was-tyDund over to appear before Su
perior Judge Day.
There were threats of a lynching at
Santa Ynez last night. The town has ex
perienced several such fires In the past
three years.

CUBANS GIVE
GENERAL WOOD
MUCH TROUBLE
Leaders Clamor for
Offices.
RIVAL FACTIONS QUARRELING
EACH WANTS ALL FEDERAL
APPOINTMENTS.
Insurgents Refuse to Lay Down
Their Arms and Strut About the
Towns in Full War
paint.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANZANILL.O, Oct. 30.â The visit of
General Leonard Wood, Governor of
the Military Department at Santiago,
has been instrumental in bringing: all
the elements among the Cubans to the
front. No fewer than 2000 insurgents
have come forward, of whom 600 are
officers who want offices, and their
clamors amount almost to a demand.
There are two leading factions, one
headed by General Jesus Rabi and the
other by General Rios. At present
most of the offices are held by repre
sentatives of the Rabi faction, includ
ing the mayoralty and the custom
house inspectorship. General Wood, in !
order to pacify the Rios faction, has
given them six positions on the rural
police force and turned over to one of
their people the lighthouse at Cape
Cruz, together with several other minor
appointment's. But neither party is sat
isfied, each thinking that it ought to
have all the offices. General Rios j
does not dare express his opinion of i
General Rabi publicly, but he feels that j
this is his district, as he has had the
nominal charge of it for three years,
and that it ought to belong to him so j
far as appointments of Cubans to office
are concerned and all the more so be
cause he represents General Garcia.
The majority of the insurgents here
have no money and go about living
from hand to mouth and wondering
what will happen next. Armed men
are not allowed rations. As the Cubans
will not disband and will not work,
nothing remains for them but to strut
about the city with machetes and re
volvers. .' > -- Vj
Some of them are nearly naked; oth
ers appear in long legged patent leather
boots with silver spurs, carrying su
perbly wrought Toledo machetes. A few
wear immaculate white suits and pan
ama hats. They are for the most part
the New York contingent.
Except when he is on board the gun
boat Hist, which brought him here,
General Wood is besieged by these
seekers of office. Among the interviews
he has had was one with General Rios,
who wanted the Mayor of Manzanillo,
one of Rabi's faction, dismissed and his
own man appointed to ' thÂ«Â£ mayoralty.
General -Wood- askott on *fhat gmunds
the dismissal could be su? rained. Said
he: I
"Is not the Mayor a competent offi
cer? Has he not an excellent reputa
tion? Did he not serve bravely and
effectively throughout the war?" â¢
To all of this General Rios replied in
the affirmative, but he insisted that his
own nominee was entitled to the posi
tion because he was a Rios man. The
interests of the city, the locality, were
apparently minor considerations in the
mind of the Cuban commander. But
this appears to be the case everywhere
among the Cuban insurgents.
General Wood and Colonel P*ttit re
gard the outlook as rather discourag
ing. Still they hope that some means
may soon be found to break up the Cu
ban army. The members of the rank
and file are anxious to go to work, but
the leaders refuse to allow them to do
so, and the men do not dare to do so,
as they would certainly be shot if cap
tured.
General Wood Is hoping that the j
other towns he will visit on his trip
around the province will not present
the same vexatious conditions as pre
vail here, where the Cuban problem is
presented in a very difficult form, the
most difficult he has yet encountered.
It was necessary to send a detach
ment of the Fourth Immune Regiment
and insurgents to the Reina plantation
in order to compel the armed Cubans
to allow men to work there. The under
taking, however, proved successful,
and 200 men are now regularly em
ployed.
The latest advices from Santa Cruz
del Sur, the meeting place of the Cuban
Assembly, do not report the arrival
there of General Gomez, .but there are
persistent rumors that the friends of
Gomez who are delegates to the Assem
bly wil endeavor to embarrass General
Calixto Garcia and his supporters.
Lieutenant Young and the officers of
the Hist have been most enthusiastic
ally welcomed here by the Cubans, who
are grateful for the help many times
extended to them. The gallant little
boat during the war was as much an
object of enthusiasm and love to the
Cubans along the coast as of fear to
the Spaniards. Lieutenant Young has
formally claimed on behalf of the
United States navy the wrecks of the
Spanish gunboats which are ashore or
sunk by the United States gunboats in
the engagement off Manzanillo on
July 1.
After a conference with Colonel Pet
ttt regarding the management of the
district General Wood left for Santiago
at noon to-day on board the Hist. On
Wednesday next he will proceed to
Guantanamo, from which point, after
first returning to Santiago, he will
leave for the north coast of the prov
ince, to be gone probably a week or ten
days.
Two companies of Colonel Pettifs
immunes are to be sent immediately to
Bayamon. â
FISHERIES QUESTION
A HARD NUT TO CRACK
British, Canadian and American
Commissioners About to Re-
sume Their Labors.
NEW YORK, Oct. 30.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: Ne-
I gotiations for the settlement of all pend
ing questions between the Uniteu States,
Great Britain and Canada will be re
sumed on Tuesday, when the inter
national commission having the matter in
charge will reassemble here.
The work of the commission was dis
cussed on Thursday last by Secretary
Hay and Sir -Julian Pauncefote. when the
j British Emhassador called at the State
I Department. It is the expectation of both
! officials that the commission will finally
| determine all questions before them dur
ing the coming Bession, and it is hoped
that they will have completed their labors
and drawn up a treaty for presentation
j to their respective governments before
! the Christmas holidays.
The Bering Sea seal question will be
one of the first to be disposed of. It is
the understanding of officials that this
question will be settled dv the purchase
' by this Government of the vessels and
| outfits of Canadian sealers, provided that
i pelagic sealing is thereafter prohibited.
The British Commissioners estimated the
' expense of such action would aggregate
; 1750,000, but it is expected a proposition
will be made that this Government pur
i cbase the vessels and outfits of the
Canadians for about $300,000.
I am told that the Alaskan boundary
question is in a satisfactory state of ne
gotiation. The fisheries question will be
a hard nut to crack, the British and
Canadians having demanded concessions
which are not acceptable to the American
Commissioners.

ing of an inter-oceanic canal through
our isthmus, granted to Messrs. Cragin
and Eyre, representing a syndicate of
American capitalists. The Govern
ment has formed a clear and well-de
fined opinion that the Cardenas Meno
cal contract of March, ISB7, has been
forfeited for non-fulfillment of its most
essential claims and for the abandon
ment of work for nine consecutive
years.
"The promise made to Messrs. Cragin
and jiyre is based on the security of
the reputation and standing of the par
ties we are dealing with and on the de
posit of $100,000 in gold.
"It is true the contract of ISS7 prom
ises the canalization of Tipitapa River,
betwen Lakes Managua and Nicaragua,
but Messrs. Cragir. and Eyre offer
something more positive in the line of
inter-oceanic transportation from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, that will be
completed three years after the new
company is organized."
PORTO RICO DEMANDS
TERRITORIAL RIGHTS

SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Oct. 30.âDele
gates from the chief towns of the island
met this afternoon in the principal
theater to consider and draft recom
mendations regarding the necessities of
the island for special commissioners, who
will be selected later, to represent Porto
Rico at Washington.
The meeting received with enthusiasm
resolution? demanding territorial rights,
cessation of present military rule and in
stallation of regular civil government.
Other resolutions were adopted asking an
eight-hour day for the laboring man and
severely denouncing the present corrupt
system of registering deeds of land.
It was obvious that the delegates pro
ceeded upon the assumption that the
United States would grant territorial
rights to Porto Rico.

HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 30.â A bull fight
and bapeball game advertised for to-day
were vetoed by the Civil Governor, the
former owing to alleged fraudulent means
used in advertising it and the latter be
cause a license to play was not obtained.
These are the official reasons given, but
the real reason was probably to pre
vent trouble with soldiers and "the fear of
a riot.

fWOTriEK LULL IN TRADE.
LAST week in trade was hardly as favorable as i
its predecessor. True, the bank clearings
showed a material gain, being v per cent over |
tiiose for the corresponding week in 1897, and only !
t-wo cities of importance â Philadelphia and New Or- j
leans â recorded a loss of any consequence. The j
country's failures numbered 219, against 218 for the ;
same week in 1897, so the honors were about even j
in this respect; but the general condition of trade 1
was more unsettled and considerable uncertainty j
and reluctance to operate were manifested in the ,
large Atlantic cities.
The main cause of this was the Fashoda incident, |
which at one time looked acute, and rendered the
heavier lines of trade and speculation dull. But that
affair has now pretty well died away, hence those
lines that were affected by it ought to recover tone. l
. The leading staples, too, did not maintain the
improvement promised the week before. Cotton fell
back again and quieted down, it being manifest that
the American and European mills both have surplus
stocks of last year's high-priced cotton that they can
not profitably market in the present state of the trade.
The crop is not too large, but it is handicapped by
the free stocks on hand, and this of course depresses
the trade. Wool is in the same predicament. Stocks are
so heavy that it is no longer a question of profit with
manufacturers, but of avoiding loss. Concessions on
the part of holders have resulted in a large increase
in sales, but it is calculated by the National Wool
Association that a full year will be necessary to work
off the abundant supplies. The iron trade shows
little change, though the demand has certainly fallen
off of ite, and some descriptions exhibit a slight
decline. In other lines of industry the report is that
work is more plentiful, and in the State of New York
alone there are 52,000 more persons employed in the
leading industries than a year ago, but the same re
pert adds that the margin of profit to the manufac
turer is smaller.
While the colder weather has served to stimulate !
the distributive trade in the West and Northwest,
where for months it has been so active, bad roads, ;
f< [lowing rains, have offset this, so that this impor- i
hint factor is not making the showing that it did. I
Still, business in these sections is by no means dull.
The wheat trade is following the others in some
respect. The outward movement is large, but the
farmers are showing more disposition to sell than
they dkl last year, and there is some apprehension as
to the permanence of the foreign demand, though
this is something which cannot be foreseen a week
ahead. The feeling in Wall street is kept unsettled
by the foreign'complications arrd approaching domes
tic elections, though tlie market has made no pro
necmeed movement, either up or down.
The local situation is tame, but there is less rnonot- I
liny. Commodities which have been dormant for
some time are showing rather more movement. Pro- â 
visions, which have been uniformly dull for a long
time, are reported in improved demand, though there
is no improvement in prices. Livestock of all kinds t
is firm, and the tendency in quotations is rather up
ward than otherwise. Hides have weakened under
the proposed closing down of a number of Eastern
tanneries by the leather trust, and several kinds are
slightly lower. Canned fruits continue in demand,
both for. Eastern and foreign account, and in Eng
land the market is bare and very firm, with constant
call for replenishment of supplies. The reverse is to ;
be said of dried fruits, which continue very dull, with
a tendenpy in prices downward rather than upward.
Apparently a halt has been called iri the wine market, i
and, though grapes advanced to exceptionally fine
prices, they were somewhat weaker again at the close.
Wheat has been steadily weakening for some days, in
sympathy with the Eastern and foreign markets, and
the demand is not as brisk as a week ago. There
have been some changes in oils in the direction of
higher quotations.
While the financial market is not materially
changed, the political campaign tends to render
operators and financiers conservative until the out
come is determined. Nothing makes capital warier
nnd more reserve! than even the bare possibility that
the laws may be tinkered with by incompetent or
visionary theorist', who are always the reverse of
practical. Still, funds are in ample and accessible
supply for solvent borrowers at the normal rates of
interest, for the undercurrent of opinion is that com
mon senÂ«e will triumph over the gilded visions of
fickle and hair-brained enthusiasts.
Getting arrested on a change of fraud is a new
advertising dndpe. and we are inclined to think well
of the innovation. The only fault to be found is that
the enterprising young woman would not stay ar
rested.

THE WHITE MAN IN THE TROPICS.
WE have received many inquiries and some
criticism for our statement, in a recent series
of editorials on "Our Tropical Colonies," that
the only kind of people who will ever be found under
a vertical sun are those who are there now, and that
white men cannot colonize there and rear families.
! Criticism of this statement is natural, since our ac
quisition of land in the American and Asiatic tropics
has been continually analogized by its advocates with
our territorial expansion on this continent and within
the temperate zone. It is natural, under the circum
stances, for our people to look upon the tropical
islands as new territory, upon which they will settle
and found states and Anglo-Saxon institutions.
The Erglish Government has done everything to
encourage marriage between English soldiers and
white women in India, but Major teneral Bagnold,
reporting on the result, says: "We have never suc
ceeded in raising enough male children to keep the
regiment supplied with drummers and pipers." Dr.
Orgeas reports from French Guiana that 418 mar
riages were made there between Europeans from 1859
to 1882. Of these unions 215 were childless. The off
spring of the remaining 203 numbered 403 children, of
whom only 141 survived to represent the posterity of
836 married Europeans! These survivors were almost
uniformly creatures with small skulls, stunted in their
growth, wrinkled and afflicted with manifold defor
mities.
Max Nordau says: "The most virile and warlike
white peoples degenerate in the tropics in a few gen
erations, until they become so feeble and indolent,
so stupid and cowardly, so incapable of any resist
ance to vice and ruinous habits, that they are in time
scarcely more than shadows of their fathers and an
cestors, if they do not die out entirely from' barren
ness and disease. This was the fate of the noble Van
dals in a hot climate. As Germanic giants they con
quered Carthage, and a hundred years later as whining
weaklings they were driven out by the wretched By
zantines. The same phenomenon is observed to-day
whenever a tropical country is subdued by a people of
the Caucasian race. The Caucasian settlers between
the tropics, therefore, are doomed to deterioration;
they not only fail to advance the civilization they
brought with them, they even lose it entirely, and
soon have nothing left of their birthright but a de
based language and the self-conceit of the caste, none
of whose distinctive features physical or intellectual,
have been retained."
The same writer, supposing a progressive and con
tinuous yielding to the temptations of tropical con
quest, continues:
"In the presence of these degenerate starvelings the
vigorous immigrants entertain no scruples, and the
feeble resistance the former are able to oppose is not
worthy of consideration. A new .stratum of human
beings, needing land and sustenance, therefore
spreads out over these lands bathed in the sun's most
fervid rays, burying beneath it the previous layer
which has been dried up, and resuming the ineffectual
battle with the climate. The equatorial regions will
therefore perform the same function in the history of
man as in meteorology. In the same way as the cold
waters of the poles flow toward the equator, evaporate
there, and are sent back in the form of vapors and
clouds; in the same way the ocean's surface is low
ered by this evaporation, which lowering must be
counteracted by the arrival of new waters from the
cold regions; in the same way, finally, as the waters
of all the oceans- are thus kept in constant motion, the
respective rainfall upon the whole earth rcpnlnted
the remotest lands made fertile, so the si
the older civilized countries will flow to t
perish there, evaporate, as it were, and be r
a constant, flowing stream. The equator
a fearful caldron in which human flesh
evaporate. It will be a revival of the ant
of Moloch. The people? of the temperat
cast a portion of their children into the ja\ .is
fiery furnace; and thus manage to retain Â * .1 iii
which to prosper and develop themselves, the pic
ture is horrible; the reality, however, is not. For it
is not a painful death to which the children of the
nations are condemned. A life of luxurious ease
smiles invitingly before them in the tropical climes;
soft breezes and waves envelop them; field and
forest offer them food in- abundance without compul
sion; existence seems easier and more delightful to
them there than to their fathers and brothers on the
refractory home soil; and with sweet, burning
kisses, to which they yield themselves in a volup
tuous ecstacy, the sun drains their life from every
pore. It is a death which every* effeminate nature will
prefer to the rude struggle for existence; it is a melt
ing and dissolving away, which is as delightful as an
cpium dream, and which is more likely to arouse
envy then pity."
Nordau, while indulging in speculation to a degree,
it will be seen is guided by the known physical facts
presented by the tropics. The white race enters them
to die. The decay of Spanish virility and current
events enforce the lesson. Nordau wrote in 1885,
thirteen years before our tropical war with Spain.
We met her under a vertical sun, where she has as
serted empire for three hundred years, to find her
blood mongrelized or degenerated, her language de
based and her people incapable of resistance. If we
try to take her place we take it with all the irrevocable
curses of nature upon it, and under the peculiar law
that dominates the Anglo-Saxon, which forbids to his
blood successful mongrelizing with the inferior races.
Spain has existed so long in the tropics by that pe
culiarity of the Vandalized and Gothicized Latin races,
that their blood can flow with that of the lower, dark
and tropical races. Ours cannot.
THE EFFECT OF MAGUIREISM.
AFTER reviewing the issues precipitated irÂ» the
campaign in this State by the nomination ot a
single tax agitator for Governor, the Phila
delphia Inquirer says: "The importance of this cam
paign lies in the effect that its results will have upon
national politics a few years hence. Should the
Democratic candidates win this fight upon the issues
indicated, the Pacific Coast will come to the Demo
cratic national convention with a single tax plank."
No man who has paid sufficient attention to his
tory to note the development of political movements
can doubt the accuracy of the forecast made by our
Philadelphia contemporary. The election of Maguire
in California would give an impetus to radical social
ism all along the line, and the next Democratic con
vention would put forth a platform in comparison
with which even the raving of the document adopted
by the Bryanites at Chicago would seem like con
servatism.
The effect upon the nation, however, would be
slight in comparison with the effect upon California.
With Maguire in the Governor's c'.iair the State would
become the storm center of all forms of radical and
extravagant agitation. Every industry would be
harassed, every interest threatened, every form of
property assailed and capital and labor alike would
be incessantly menaced.
The Inquirer says of Maguire: "While protesting
his adherence to the Chicago platform and his ad
fHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1898.
miration for Bryan, he is far, very far, ahead of both
on the logical path that Democracy has opened vp â
namely, the commune."
Such is the view taken of the single taxer's cam
paign by the people of the East. Those who study the
situation nearer at hand, however, know that before
the commune there would be a period oi lawless revo
lution and confiscation. The immediate effect of Ma
guireism would be a tendency to anarchy. A Governor
of the sandlotter type would in a single term of office
inflict injuries upon the State which it would require
years to efface.
THE CAT AND THE CANARY.
PEOPLE who in the closing week of the politi
cal campaign look about for the Phelan dickey
bird that has been so busy chirping his chicka
dee song of purity and reform will look in vain. Even
if they follow his traces to the Harney headquarters
they will hardly find more than the scattered feathers
of him, for there sits the Rainey cat with a grin that
means, "I have eaten the canary."
The catastrophe is not surprising. As long ago as
September 18 the Examiner, which seems to have
had the keen interest of proprietorship in the canary,
foresaw the danger and uttered the warning: "The
State Central Committee did an excellent thing in
upsetting Rainey, but that did not complete the
emancipation of the city."
On the next day it repeated the forebodings in
another form, saying: "Rainey is politically dead,
and the convention need not fear him unless by its
own acts it puts life in the corpse and makes a con
vention of the Harneyites a possible thing."
That which the fond keeper of the canary fore
saw has come to pass. Yesterday the Examiner de
clared: "On Friday evening the campaign commit
tee of what is known as the Harney branch of the
Democracy resolved that a meeting should be called
to consider the propriety of giving a united support
to the entire Democratic ticket. Major Harney him
self advocated such a course, and there is no question
that it will be followed."
On September 7 the Examiner, after declaring that
a Democratic primary election in the city would af
ford an opportunity for base bosses and their hench
men to commit all forms of fraud, such as "repeating,
false personation of voters, stealing ballot-boxes,"
etc., went on to say: "For the decent body of the
party to go into a primary, therefore, in competition
with the Rainey gang, would be as a man who
should go into the ring bound by all the rules of the
Queensberry code against a savage armed and free
from all restraints."
The Rainey gang has shown now that it can win
without a primary or even a voice in the selection
of party nominees, and the Examiner surrenders the
purity candidate to their greed without a murmur.
It even went so far yesterday as to say, "The action
of these Democrats (the Harneyites) is both pa
triotic and consistent."
"There are certain differences within the ranks of
the Democratic party," says the yellow organ in a
burst of candor. "Those differences will be adjusted
equitably. But the field of battle is not the place for
such adjustment."
Thus it appears the equitable adjustment is to be
done in secret. The canary is to be eaten behind
closed doors with the blinds pulled down. The ad
justment will be made, of course, at the expense of
the taxpayers. So many sinecures for this boss, so
much boodle for that.
In the meantime the peoplfe will recall the old
song-
A lady on the banws of the Niger
Went to ride, with a smile, on a tiicer.
They returned from the ride
With the' lady inside.
And a smile on the face of the tisrer.
0 TAINT OF THE BLOOD.
NOT long ago a man named Eubanks was hanged
for having killed his daughter.. It would ap
pear that he w^as a person of bad judgment.
He should have killed another daughter.
The girl he permitted to live recently swore that
she had been assaulted, and the unfortunate charged
with the crime was sentenced to twelve years in the
penitentiary. Now this guileless lass makes oath that
her testimony was perjured, a suspicion to this effect
having been raised by her threat to send a second
man to the penitentiary on a similar charge unless
he should advance a certain sum of money.
The conclusion is inevitable that the Eubanks girl
is a bad sort, but the question of what shall be done
with her arises, and the answer is not forthcoming.
There is no provision by which she can be elimin
ated. She has been bora into the world, and the world
must grin and bear it. She seems to have been born
under a curse, with a taint in her blood. Perhaps
sVie may be described as unlucky, but so may other
people who chance to come into contact with her.
When a mere child displays so vile a tendency,
when, hardly out of short skirts, she begins exercising
a power to deprive men of their liberty, it is plain
that she is a dangerous element in society. What is
society to do about it? She would demoralize a re
form school, and a prison sentence, unless for life,
would serve to make of her a worse criminal. The
Eubanks creature constitutes a puzzle. There is, of
course, the hope that she may die, but it is faint.
She does not belong to those who die young.
The death of Colonel George E. Waring is to be
regretted. Waring was one of the few men who, ap
pointed to a place of responsibility, devoted to his
duties the best efforts and the judgment of a ripened
experience. He kept New York clean, something
nobody else had ever done, and, being sent to Cuba
to study the sanitary conditions, contracted the yel
low fever, of which he died, as truly a martyr as
though he had given his life on the bloody field.
Word comes by telegraph that the Commissioners
in Cuba have been instructed that the removal of im
movable property there must ce;.se at once. We
should certainly think so. Also that if the Commis
sioners observe an irresistible force about to collide
with some of this immovable property they swear out
an injunction.
The Non-Partisans are not any deader than they
have been from the start, but they are beginning to
realize the futility of mixing up in a campaign with
live people.
The wearing of a silk hat is in itself no possible
objection to any candidate, but voters have a right
to inquire what is under the hat.
Knives are out for Phelan, but ;he most dangerous
blade in the lot is wielded by himself. The Mayor
seems bent on hara-kiri.
A Dutch reporter offered his arm to the Queen
and was hastily placed under arrest. They suspected
him of being loaded.
Cubans remain in an ugly mood not so much be
cause they love war as that they hate work.
THROWING SAND IN OUR EYES.
Editor The Cail: This is the chance of a lifetime. Perhaps never again
in our day shall the issue be so clearly denned between good government and
bad. On one side is Mr. Phelan and his subordinates, who are pledged to
give us good government and a low rate of taxation. On the other side are
the greedy corporations whose sole object is to bankrupt us with heavy
taxes and to loot the city treasury.
If we now vote for Mr. Phelan, and those who are pledged to let him
have his own way, we will have a good government, if not of the people and
by the people, at least for the people. We shall not have to pay taxes. The
corporations have so much property that they can support the expenses of
the municipality.
These are arguments which Mr. Phelan is using every day, and which
his Assessor, Mr. Dodge, has developed with praiseworthy industry and elab
orate charts. They are arguments that appeal to the plain citizen, to you
and to me. Politics come very close home to us when we have to pay taxes,
and we are naturally with the party that promises to reduce the tax rate.
In fact, no matter how we may enthuse about the Declaration of Indepen
dence, and about liberty, we are inclined to make experiments not exactly in
line with such enthusiasm when it is a question of saving several hard-earned
dollars. It is a very difficult thing to hold up one's head high and swell one's
chest with the air of freedom when there is a leak in our pockets.
But the plain citizen, like you and me, has very definite ideas about
money and money-getting. We do not pretend to deal with high finance, or
political economy, or the scientific basis of taxation. Single tax and double
tax do not make pleasant reading for us. We usually fall asleep, over the
deep discussions that these matters occasion. The only literature on taxation
that arrests attention and stirs our feelings is our own half-yearly tax bill.
But, at the same time, as we are plain people who are accustomed to
earn our money with hard labor, experience has taught us one fact, the funda
mental fact of political economy â you can't get something for nothing. As
citizens of this city we demand streets, sewers, parks, schools, lighting,
water, gas, protection against lawbreakers, a convenient and sure method for
securing title to our property, law courts, and the like. All these cost some
thing. They ,are benefits, and we must have them. When even the disciples
of good government come to us and tell us, "You can get them for
nothing, plain people like you and -me put on our considering caps and try
to puzzle the matter out.
NOW THE WAY IN WHICH ALL THIS IS TO BE
Is delightfully simple. There are several corporations engaged in supply
ing public utilities to the people. Thus we have a water company, a gas com
pany, a street railway company. These companies make their money out of the
people. If they are fairly taxed, the amount of money which they would
turn into the treasury would relieve the plain citizen, that is, you and me,
of the necessity of paying any taxes at all.
But here again the plain citizen is met with that rock bottom fact of
experience â you can't get something for nothing. Can there be anything in
the glorious climate of California that changes the laws of nature, or has Mr.
Phelan, or his Assessor, Mr. Dodge, discovered some kind of a financial
Keeley motor that will run a mint stamp when you whistle at it?
The plain citizen is well aware, by sad experience, that the great, quasi
public corporations have no private mines from which to draw the money
to run their system. Every time the conductor comes along with his inevit
able "Fare, please," it is borne in upon us that it is the plain citizen, you and
I, who must pay for the running of the motors, the repair of the tracks, the
salaries of the officials â aye, even of the remorseless conductor whose ob
ject is life seems to be to work off on us his stock ot plugged quarters
and Canadian dimes. Every cent of the money that these corporations
earn comes from your pocket and from mine. Therefore every cent that they
might, could, would or should turn into the treasury in taxes would come
out of your pocket, and out of mine. Even were Mr. Phelan and Mr.
Dodge sincere in their promises so to tax the corporations that the proceeds
of such tax would run the city government, still it would be the plain citizen,
you and I, who would pay these taxes in the end. You can't get something
for nothing honestly.
The only effect of such a line of procedure as that held up by Mr. Phelan
as a sure cure for all our woes would be to bring back the ancient Roman
system of taxation. In that republic it was not the custom that the taxes
should be collected by state machinery. The privilege of gathering taxes wa3
put up at auction, and the highest bidder became official tax-gatherer. His
bid paid all the exoenses of the Government, and for his profit he squeezed
all he could out of the people. The system was not economical; it was not
popular. It hai long been rejected by all enlightened â¢ communities.^ The
plain citizen is not yet prepared to take the power of taxation from its own
representatives. Now he has some control of the affair. He has not such
confidence in the street railroad companies that he is prepared to turn over
this important branch of the government to its hirelings.
BUT NO DOUBT MR. PHELAN AND HIS ASSESSOR
Will say we are going too far. and too fast. The prices of street car
transportation, water and gas are regulated by law. Therefore the com
panies cannot increase the rates, and the extra taxation will come out of
their profits. In other words, the plain citizen will get more for the nickel
he pays the car conductor â lie will get not only his transportation, but also
a dividend from the city expenses.
Now the plain citizen, like you and me, has no objections to getting more
for his nickel. We wish to make our nickels go as far as possible; but, again,
we are not fools. We scan very closely the machinery by which vve are to
get this increase in value. We have no desire to drop our nickel in the slot
and then find that the machinery is loaded against us.
To put the matter plainly, because the plain citizen believes that he must
see plainly if he would understand, let us take the case of the street railroad.
You and I pay a nickel for transportation from one point to another. Let
us suppose that of that nickel, under the present arrangement, two cents go
to the expenses of the company, two cents to the profits of the shareholders,
etc.. and one cent to the city in taxation. Now Mr. Phelan's cry is that the
proportion should be different. As it now stands the plain citizen gets for
his nickel two cents' worth of transportation, and his share in the one cent's
worth of city work. Mr. Phelan says add another cent to the taxation and
the citizen will receive in effect four cents for his nickel, while the company
will get only one. â 
This is a very taking cry, but the plain citizen looks at it with consider
able suspicion. If is too easy. Mr. Phelan says all this can be done and
shall be done by electing him as Mayor, and his assistant, Mr. Dodge, as
Assessor. The Assessor will simply say the word and the trick is done.
Plain citizens fight shy of magicians. They may won-der at the man who can
produce $5 gold pieces out of an empty pocket, but they take particular
good care to keep at a safe distance from his nimble .fingers. It may do no
harm, even though the subject is dry. to look a little closer at Mr. Dodge's
chart.
His campaign cry is that he can reapportion the component parts of the
nickel. Now two cents go to expenses, two cents to profit, and one cent to
taxes. He will change it to two cents for expenses, two cen'.s for taxes and
one cent for profit. Now here is the funny part of it. The minute the â¢
five-cent piece leaves the hands of the plain citizen it goes into the possession
and control of the street railroad company. No. one except the street rail
road company can henceforth lay a hand on it. It is divided and apDor
tioned solely and entiely by the corporation. How one cent is allotted or
where two cents are put is. decided, not by Mr. Phelan, not by Mr. Dodge, riot
by you or me. but by the officials of the company or combine.
Now Mr. Phelan and Mr.- Dodge have worn out the English. language in
telling of the viciousness of corporations. The plain citizen, of course, takes
their remarks with a grain of salt, but neither you nor I have much confi
dence in corporations. They are looking out for their, own interests, and
where our interests and theirs clash, they, will take care of their own if they
have the management of the affair.
But Mr. Phelau and Mr. Dodge. afe of such a mild and Christian char
acter that they
NOT ONLY LOVE THEIR ENEMIES, THEY TRUST THEM.
They hand over the. nickel of the plain citizen to the corpora
tion, and they expect the corporation so to divide it as to
lessen the corporation's -'â¢ofits. The plain citizen knows that
there is another combination possible with the cents of the
nickel. Now it is two cents' worth of transportation, two cents to profit, one
cent to taxes. Mr. Phelan imagines that by shaking a row of figures at the
Octopus and saying "Shoo!" he can change the combination into a two cent
ride, one' cent profit and two cents taxes. The plain citizen knows very well
that' the result will inevitably be. as long as the corporation has the alloting
of the cents â one cent's worth of transportation, two cents' worth of profit to
the company, and two cents' worth of taxation to the politicians. No matter
how the assessment may be increased, it is the plain citizen that will bear the
burden.
' Now it may be objected that the companies cannot afford to cut down
their running expenses. Can't'thev? The plain citizen would like to know
anything in the shape of retrenchment that a corporation is not capable of
if it wishes to save its profits. You and I have no desire to go into long rows
of figures. We can't understand them ourselves, and we suspect that the
fellow who is talking so glibly does not understand them, either. We go on
the common sense proposition that once we let the nickel go out of our hands
into the power of the railroad company,, the railroad company will take good
care that if any one is to suffer it will be the plain people, you and I. The
taxes may be raised, but the profits will remain the same. The only difference
will be that we won't get so much as before.
Of course the plain citizen wants more for his nickel, but the way to get
it is not by handing it over to a railroad company to divide, but by mak
ing the division himself. Let him hold on to his nickel, and if he thinks
the ride is not worth five cents, he has. his Legislature with power to make
it four, or three, or two, or one. Plain people know well that if the railroad
company is making illegitimate profits, and it may be for all we know, the
way to fight it is by an agitation for lower fares, and not by electing Mr.
Phelan Mayor or Mr. Dodge Assessor.
What is true of the railroad is true of the water company and the gas
company, and of every > uasi-public corporation. The plain citizen is anxious
to get their services as cheaply as possible, and because of that anxiety he
lends a ready ear to those who promise him great things for a little exertion.
Mr. Phelan knows this is a popular cry, and he promises a relief from
heavy burdens if we elect him and his Assessor. The plain citizen does not
object to the relief, but he does object to the man who says he can do what
every one kno- he cannot. Mr. Phelan is not sincere. He is using a false
cry as a decoy. The plain citizen is afraid of hypocrite who are looking
for power. False in one thing, false in all, applies to professional purists
as well as to liars. If they are throwing dust in the eyes of the public now
it is because they wish the public to bend when their real designs are put
in action. The plain citizen may not be a very great statesman, but he knows
enough to detect a stalking horse. A PLAIN CITIZEN.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Rio de la Plata, a small Spanish
craiier^ofiare tons, was launched last
month at Havre. Her cost was defrayed
by public subscription of loyal Spaniards
in the Argentine Republic. The cruiser
Will have 7100 horse power and a speed
of twenty knots, and carries a light Bat
tery.
The only Russian navy order given to
England of the contracts distributed over
Germany, France and the United States
is one torpedo-boat destroyer of thirty
knots, to be built at Laird's. She will be
similar to those built by the same firm
for the British navy, and which nave
proved exceptionally speedy.
The Philomel, British cruiser of 2575
tons and built eight years ago, has had a.
refit and passed through a natural
draught trial. She developed 4798 horse
power and 16.3 knots, an improvement
upon her original performance. The
Sirino, on the other hand, also built In
IS9O, fell over Tie knot short on a recent
trial, as compared with her speed seven
years ago. *-*
A Cammell steel armor plate 11.8 inches
thick and treated by the Krupp-Harvey
process was tested last month at Sno
buryness, near Woolwich. Three Holtxer
armor-piercing shells of twelve-inch di
ameter and 720 pounds weight were nrea
against the plate at iB6O feet per second
velocity, but none of the shots penetrated
the plate more than to a depth of four
inches and the shells broke up. There
were no cracks in the plate and only a
fine hair line was visible after the third
shot, extending from the point of impact
toward the upper edge. The lot, of which
the plate tried was a test piece, was ac
cepted, the trial being considered highly
satisfactory.
An armored cruiser of 9517 tons and
19.600 horse power is to be built at l'Qrient
for the French navy. She -will be 460 feet
length, 63 feet 4 inches beam and have
a draught of 24 fet 7 inches. The arma
ment will consist of two 7.6-inch breech
loaders, and the following rapld-nrers:
eight 6.4-inch, four 3.9-inch, sixteen six
pounders and six three-pounders, milking
a total of thirty-six guns, and there will
be two underwater torpedo tubes. This
new ship, to be named La Gloire, is of the
same displacement as the Guyedon, also
building at l'Orient, but is longer and
has a little less beam. Their speeds are
twenty-one knots, but in the La Gloire
the horse power is 600 less than in the
Guyedon, her finer lines enabling twenty
one knots to be reached with less power.
The estimated cost is $4,043,000.
Sweden is acquiring quite a navy, and
all of its armored vessels are built in
home yards, at Stockholm and Gothen
burg. The latest additions are Njord,
Odin and Thor, coast defense turret
ships. They are identical in dimension*
Â«uid displacement, beine 179 feet in length,
forty-nine feet six inches benm and
sixteen feet six inched draught
and displacement 3400 tons. The Odin,
built in 1896, averaged 16.8 knots during
a six-hours' trial. Their armor belt is of
steel ranging from twelve to 'our inches
in thickness, equal to a thickness of Iron
from fifteen to five inches. The arma
ment consists of two 9.8-inch Carret guns,
four 4.7-inch quick-firers, ten slx-pounders
and one torpedo tube, and their comple
ment is 210. Other armored vessels are
undergoing refits and changes in batter
ies, the Swea having- 4.7-inch quick-firers,
taking the place <<f the old six-Inch
breech-loaders. The John Ericsson, al
though built in 1865, has also been re
constructed and most of armored gun
boats have likewise been thoroughly re
paired and rearmed with modern ord
nance. _^^__^___

Sad Story of Two
Neglected Girls.
FOUND ASLEEP IN THE PARK
ACCUSE THE FATHER OF CAST
ING THEM ADRIFT.
Discovered by a Policeman, They Are
Taken to the City Prison
and Given a Place
to Sleep.
"With tear-stalr.ea faces and bedraggled
appearance two girls were led into the
City Prison yesterday morning by a po
liceman who had found them sleeping in
Golden Gate Park. Amid spbs they gave
their names as Maud Snenker, aged 13,
and her sister, Lille, aged 14 years.
The officer had Desk Sergeant Brown
register their namps in the lodgers' book,
as they were without a home.
According to the story of the unfor
tunate girls they recently arrived here
from the interior with their father. They
were almost penniless, but through the
efforts of a friend their father secured
employment In a tannery in South San
Francisco.
Saturday night he returned home and
they say severely beat his eldest daugh
ter, and when her sister interfered that
he also abused her and finally drove them
from the house. They appealed to him
not to cast them adrift as the night was
cold and they were without money to
rent a room, but they were turned away
and the door was shut in their faces.
They say their father threatened to kill
thi m if they did not go away.
With heavy hearts the girls left the
plnce. determined never to return. After
walking for several hours they found
lelves at the entrance to Golden
Park. Tired and footsore they re-
Bolved to Bleep on a bench until the
morningr. when I ::d -i d to make
efforts to procure employment.
They were awakened by a policeman,
who saw them enter the park, and
thinking they were lost he determined to
follow them.
After listening to their story the officer
took took them to a restaurant, where
they were given something to eat. Rather
than accompany the policeman to their
home, where he intended to take them,
the girls asked to be sent to the police
station. They were at once taken to the
City Prison and given in charge of the
matron.
"I cannot understand why father turn
ed us out," remarked one of the sisters
yesterday. "He was always so kind to
us. I suppose we are in his way and he
is anxious to get rid of us. If we could
get something to do I know we could
earn sufficient money to at least buy
food and a place to sleep."
Honored Their Commander.
Mrs. Ella P. Jacobs, lady commander
of Mission Hive, left last Wednesday on

proved a very enjoyable affair. Mr.'.

THE ILLS OF WOMEN
And How Mrs. Pinfcham Helps
Overcome Them.
Mrs. Mary Bolltngkr, 1101 Marianna
St., Chicago, 111., to Mrs. Pinkham:
"I have been troubled for the past
--- two years with falling of the womb,
leucorrhoea, pains over my body, sick
headaches, backache, nervouwiess and
weakness. I tried doctors and various
remedies without relief. After taking
two bottles of your Vegetable Com-
pound, the relief I obtained was truly
wonderful. I have now taken several
more bottles of your famous medicine,
and can say that I am entirely cured."
Mrs. HexryDorr, No. 806FindleySt M
Cincinnati, Ohio, to Mrs. Pinkham:
"For a long time I suffered with
chronic inflammation of the womb,
pain in abdomen and bearing-down
feeling. Was very nervous at times, and
so weak I was hardly able to do any-
thing. Was subject to headaches, also
troubled with leucorrhcea. After doc-
toring for many months with different
physicians, and getting no relief, I had
given up all hope of being well j
again when I read of the great good !
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com- j
pound was doing. I decided immedi- i
ately to give it a trial. The result was
simply past belief. After taking four :
bottles of Vegetable Compound and
using three packages of Sanative Wash
I can say I feel like a new woman. I
deem it my duty to announce the fact
to my fellow sufferers that Lydia I
E. Pinkham's Vegetable remedies have
entirely cured me of all my pains and
suffering \ I have her alone to thank ;
for my recovery, for which I am grate- j
fuL May heaven bless her for the

FIREMAN FATALLY INJURED.
Michael Kelleher of Truck 3 While at Prac
tice Falls From a Ladder a Distance
___ of Thirty Feet
AN unfortunate slip of the foot caused the death of Michael Kelleher,
a fireman connected with Truck 3. on Market street, near Tenth, yes
terday morning.
The members of the company were at practice at the Moulder Primary
School, Page and Gough streets, about 7 o'clock. An extension ladder was
placed against the wall of the school building facing Page street, and the
men ran up It to the__roof. The ladder is thirty feet long with an exten
sion of fifteen feet. It topped the roof by about six feet.
Kelleher was the sixth man to come down the ladder from the roof.
He held on by the sides instead of the rounds, and when he reached the ex
tension and placed his foot down it slippped and the jar threw him round.
He clutched at the ladder with his disengaged hand, but the momentum
was too gTeat and he fell, making two complete somersaults before striking
the ground. He fell on his left side, and the force was so great that he
rebounded about two feet. He fell a distance of about thirty feet.
He was picked up in an unconscious condition and taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital in the ambulance, where it was found that his skull was
fractured, his left hip bone shattered, and there was a compound frac
ture of the left arm, besides lacerations of the scalp and eyebrow and in
ternal injuries. Dr. Botkin, the physician for the department, had been
summoned, and at the request of Assistant Chief Dougherty he had Kelle
her removed to St. Mary's Hospital. Kelleher died a few hours later.
The Coroner was notified, and agreed that the body should be taken to the
parlors of an undertaker.
Kelleher was a shoemaker by trade and lived with his wife and two
children at 1007 Natoma street. He was 35 years of age. He was a substi
tute for an extraman and had only been in the department as such for
about six weeks.

! tost of the Second District of thÂ«
; League of the Cross, held yesterday af
1 ternoon at Mission Parlor Hall, Arthur
' Osborne of St. Joseph's Parish, won the

I There were many points, however, partic
; ularly the delivery and the style, in Os
borne's essay which won for him and |
his parish the silver trophy of victory.
The medal was presented by the Rev. â 
Father O'Ryan of St. Marys Cathedral.
J The Rev. C. E. O'Neill, of St. Charles
Parish, delivered the principal address of I
. the occasion on the subject of intemper- ;
I ance and its baneful effects upon the en- '
tire nation, society generally and the ;
home.
In conjunction with the essay contest, ;
1 an entertaining programme was rendered, j
; including many instrumental and vocal ]
: selections.
Among the many who made this feature
of the rally a success are the following.

F. Hqane, George F. Johnston and Dr.
Joseph I. Richards?.
The rally was concluded with an oral
prayer by the cadets, led by Father

SLEEP WAS HIS UNDOING.
Romaldo Echerara Does Politics to
His Sorrow.
Romaldo Echerara was rudely awak
ened from a nap he was taking on the
roof of his front porch early yesterday
morning by Officers Backullch and
Peshon, who took the youth for a burglar.
His assertion that he was at his own
home was doubted by the policemen, and
while Backulich covered the supposed
burglar with his revolver, Peshon rang
the bell of the house, arousing Echerara's
mother, much to the disgust of the son,
who had taken up his position on the
porch in an endeavor to enter the house
without her knowledge.
Echerara took in a political meeting
early in the -evening, and incidentally
considerable liquor. He cheered for, and
drank to and with his favorite candidates
until quite late, and when every other
place was closed made his way toward
home. The road he found long and cir
cuitous, and when he finally reached his
domicile all efforts to find the keyhole
were unavailing. Fear of the wrath of
his mother prevented him from ringing
the bell and prompted him to scale a
pillar of the porch in the hope of finding
an unlocked window. The exertion or"
climbing to the roof of the porch added to
the sleepiness produced by his liberal po
tions of liquid refreshment of which the
young man had partaken, was his undo
ir.g. Falling asleep before he had gained
an entrance, the watchful officers spied
him. Just how he explained the matter
to his mother will perhaps .never be
known, but it is rumored that he has
foresworn politics.

BURGLARS RAID
MISS MALOFF`S
APARTMENTS
Expected to Make a
Rich Haul.
WERE AFTER HER NUGGETS
FRIGHTENED OFF BY A GTJEST
OF THE HOUSE.
The "Dancing Girl" of Dawson Vis
ited by Crooks â Police Are
Working on the
Case.
The police are searching for the perpe
trators of an unusually bold burglary
committed Saturday night in the Royal
Eagie House on Powell street.
Two of the rooms on the upper floor are
occupied by Freda Maloff, the "dancing
girl of Dawson City," as she is famil
iarly known to her friends, and Emma
Smith, who won fame and money in
Alaska by her sweet voice. The women
arrived here a short time ago and rented
apartments in the Royal Eagle. Miss Ma
loff displayed a number of nuggets which
she had received from her admirers in
Dawson City, and at once among the
guests in the house It was whispered that
the "dancing girl" had untold wealth
stowed away In her trunk. The stories of
her vast richness evidently incited the
cupidity of some thief, who determined
to rob her.
Last Saturday night Miss Maloff and
Miss Smith left the house soon after 8
o'clock to see the Republican parade.
They returned to their apartments a^out
half-past 10 o'clock and discovered that
burglars had paid them a visit during
their absence.
After forcing open the door of the
apartments with a "jimmy" the crooks
proceeded to open Miss Maloff's trunk.
They succeeded in breaking the lock, but
failed to get into the trunk on account of
the lid being screwed down. While they
were furiously endeavoring to open it a
woman who lives in the adjoining room
heard them at work and called the bell
boy.
Becoming alarmed the burglars ran
from the room and made their escape.
Before leaving, however, they stole a silk
dress belonging to Miss Smith and a re
volver, the property of Miss Maloff. The
police were at once notified of the burg
lary, but despite their efforts the perpe
trators c-ire still enjoying their liberty.
Miss Maloff is convinced that the crooks
were aware that she had a number of
gold nuggets in her trunk and determined
to make a desperate attempt to get them.
She believes that they saw her leave tue
house with her friend and lost no time in
breaking into her apartments.
On a table in her room Miss Maloff had
placed a small bag containing several
nuggets, which she says are worth $200.
In their eagerness to pet into the trunk
the burglars overlooked the bag and its
precious contents.

What Mariani Wine Does to Soothe,
Strengthen and Sustain the
System.
Yin Mariani (Mariani Wine) is
recommended as a tonic by the med-
ical profession all over .the world. It
has received written recommendations
from more than 8000 American physi-
cians.
Marlanl Wine soothes, strengthens
and sustains the system and braces
body and ~ brain. It gives strength;
therefore may ' it be described as the
conqueror of disease and the promoter
of health and longe. ;y.
Mariant Wine is specially indicated
for malaria, fever and ague and all
miasmatic fevers. It promptly dispels
chills, abates malarial fever, and gives
a sense of buoyancy and vigor.
Mariani Wine is furthermore of es-
pecial value in cases of Neuralgia, Ner-
vous Debility, Muscular Relaxation.
Mental and Physical Depression and
Exhaustion, C erwork or Overstrain.
Insomnia, Headache, Nervous Dyspep-
sia, Loss of Appetite, Emaciation and
Consumption. It builds up the vital
forces and is a powerful rejuvenator. It
gives strength to the nervous system,
firmness and elasticity to the muscles,
and richness to the blood, It benefits
all. ? â
Marlanl Wine is palatable and suited
to the most delicate stomachs. . In the
cases of pale, puny, sickly children it
is invariably used with great benefit.
For overworked men and delicate
women Mariani Wine works wonders.
Marani Wine Is sold by all Druggists.
Try it and you will find that it will well
sustain its reputation. One word of
caution, however no representation
or explanation induce you to accept a
substitute. "Just as- good" usually
leads to disappointment.

REA SEEKS THE
VETERANS` VOTES
War Heroes Urged to
Aid the Boss.
HIS HENCHMEN ARE BUSY
BRAZEN ATTEMPTS TO CORRAL
OLD SOLDIERS.
Activity of the So-Cp.lled "Battlefield
Veterans,"' an Organization.
Composed of Members
of the Gang.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
R^.s' JOSE, Oct. 30.â The campaign Is
sizzling in Santa Clara County and dur
ing ihe coming week Rea and Macken
zie will turn their followers loose to
try and intimidate the respectable vot
ers into supporting the gang ticket.
Preliminary to this the Union Battle
field Veterans, composed of about a
dozen of Rea's closest friends, are en
deavoring to whip the old soldiers and
eona of veterans into line. At the head
of this organization are W. J. "Wolcott,
Major Starck and L. L. Xattinger, and
for years they have tried to control the
veterans' vote for Rea. ' It is this trio
that did the dirty work for Rea that
culminated in the dismissal of Profes
sor Smith from the High School and
nearly wrecked that institution. They
accused Smith of being unpatriotic,
and under this false accusation, the
School Board, at Rea's dictation, dis
â¢l him. For this political job the
Union Battlefield Veterans received a
scoring in the paers at the hands of
all Grand Army societies of this city.
But these minions of the boss are
again in the field under Rea's orders.
They occupy a half column in the
gang's organ, the Mercury, with reso
lutions and try to head off the old sol
diers, who are flocking over to the Good
Government ticket. They announce
that their "trust is unshaken in the
ability and integrity of the characters
of the regular Republican nominees"
and then "deprecate the persistent use
by the opponentk <>f the regular Repub
lican ticket of gross and vile personal
abuse, both verbally and by the
medium of newspaper slurs and vul
garisms, as unseemly and revolting."
What mockery and gall! These are
only the weapons of the gang, and their
leader, iion^ Rea, now stands convicted
of slander in the Superior Court for
conducting just the sort of a campaign
they deprecate.
The "regular Republican" county
ticket is gang from top to bottom, and
this is the ticket the Union Battlefield
Veterans want other old soldiers to sup
port. These "political soldiers" boast
openly that they control the Grand
Army vote and that they will deliver it
to Rea. The testimony of Rea, given
during the slander suit, showed that
Major Starck and W. J. "Wolcott con
sulted with Mackenzie and himself in
regard to putting up a city ticket.
The gang is to make a hard fight for
a big majority in this city. This is
absolutely necessary to overcome the
great vote the Good Government
League will get in the country districts.
It was proposed to adopt the same dis
reputable tactics employed to carry the
Republican primary, but the election
officials appointed are getting "cold
feet" since it was possible to get a jury
to convict Rea of slander. Beside, the
Good Government League has made ar
rangements and raised a fund to prose
cute ballot-box stuffers and all such
offenders.
The three-cornered fight for Sheriff
is attracting the most attention.
James H. Lyndon, the Good Govern
ment candidate, Is opposed by two gang
men, R. J. Langrford, Republican, and
G. Y. Bollinger, Democrat. Either of
the two is satisfactory to Rea, and the
boss' order is "anything to beat Lyn
don." "Johnnie" Mackenzie wanted to
be Under Sheriff four years ago, but
Lyndon refused to have this lieuten
ant of Rea around, and consequently
incurred the enmity of the gang . Lang
ford holds his position on the Board of
Education through lira's Influence, and
his action in school affairs has con
vinced people that should he be elected
Sheriff the people's interests will be sec
ond to Rea's. Bollinger was Sheriff
once before and his gang alliances are
even stronger than Langford's. Just
now the gang is shouting for both these
worthies in the hope that Republicans
will be drawn away from Lyndon to
Langford and the independent and
anti-gang- Democrats -. to BollLnger.
When these forces are separated the
gang will throw its full strength to the
strongest man. These tactics will not
be able to defeat Lyndon, as the re
spectable classes are now solid for him

Health was informed of the death of
Colonel Waring within five minutes
after It occurred. Dr. Roberts, the
sanitary superintendent, was ordered
to have the bod" placed in a hermet
ically sealed calfeket at cmce. Mr.
Murphy also gave orders that every
precaution should be taken to prevent
the spread of the disease.
Colonel Waring had been sent to Ha
vana as a special commissioner of this
Government to ascertain the exact san
itary conditions of that city and to form
ideas for the best methods of putting
the place in first-class sanitary shape.
He was to report to the President, and
| on the day he returned he said he ex
! pected to go to Washington the next
morning. He said he felt unwell, but
it was not thought he was seriously ill.
He said he had a great deal of informa
tion, which he said he thought would
be of great service to the President.
Colonel Waring was a native of New

was spent in the study and practice of
scientific agriculture. He was for some
time in charge of Horace Greeley's
farm at Chappaqua, N. Y.
In 1857 he was appointed agricultural
engineer of Central Park, this city. He
entered the military service in 1862 as

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1898.
GEORGE HARPER
WAS SIMPLY
INVINCIBLE
Pitched Superbly and
Shut Out Oakland.
MERTES ALSO PLAYED WELL
THE GAME EASILY THE FINEST
YET SEEN.
San Jose Beaten by the Athletics and
the Gilt Edges Win From the
San Franciscos â Other
Games.
By Joe Corbett.
Forty-five hundred lovers of our great
national game turned out yesterday af
ternoon to see the Stocktons, reinforced
by "Sandow" Mertes and George Harper,
defeat the Oaklands by the score of 1 to 0.
Not in many years has such a perfect
exhibition been witnessed as that of yes
terday. The StocktonÃ, who have hither
to been looked upon as anything but an.
up-to-date ball team, more than surprised
the persistent fans by their steady and
at intervals really brilliant playing.
Harper, their new pitcher, was dimply
invincible, and with Mertes to steady the
Held it is not hard to conjecture why It
was that the Oaklands could not score.
Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon
these two Eastern men. Their playing
was at all times superb, Harper pitching
elegantly and Mertes playing shortstop
as unly a National Leaguer can. They,
and, of course, their cohorts, did not have
what is generally termed a walkover. In
fact the bitterest sort of opposition greet
ed them at every step, and had it not been
for a fortunate base hit by Rice in the
second inning, with a man on second, the
game might have been going on yet.
Moskiman. who opposed Harper, did
almost as well as Harper. But four hits
were made off his delivery, but two of
them came at a time when they were
needed, and hence the run that won the
game. A base on balls coupled with two
hit.-; was, therefore, the cause of Oak
land's defeat, but they need not feel
ashamed, as they played as good a game
as their opponents, save in the third inn
ing, when Moskiman was hit opportune
ly and the only run of the game was
scored. The score follows:

REMARKABLE STRIKE IN
THE REPUBLIC MINE
Free-Milling Ore Yielding Fifteen
Ounces to the Ton Pierced
by a Tunnel.
SPOKANE, Oct. 30.â The most marvel
ous strike recorded in a mine of Wash
ington was made to-day in the Republic
mine at Republic, on the north half of
Colville reservation. Free milling ore
averaging 15 ounces of gold or nearly $300
to the ton, was encountered at a depth of
400 feet from the surface. The drills cut
through twenty-four feet of ledge, the
last sixteen feet averaging fifteen ounces,
and the farther wall of the pay streak
has not yet been encountered. The Re
public mine tunnel is 145 feet long, having
been driven with a view of ascertaining
if values on the surface held with depth.
The mine has always shown rich ore,
but this discovery makes other mines
near by almost certain of encountering
the ledge at great depths.
The effect of the u.scovery was electri
cal in Spokane. A party of mining brok
ers has done a landofflee business all day,
although it was Sunday and speculators
were supposed to be at home. Quotations
for stocks .of mines in the vicinity jumped
from ten to thirty-five cents a share and
10 I I 00 shares of various companies chang
ed hands in the afternoon. The stock of
the Republic has until now been quoted
at $25.

MARKET ST.Sf.^S^CORINTHIANS IN WINTER QUARTERS.
MANY of the Corinthian yachtsmen spent Saturday afternoon and the early part of yesterday morning In prepar
ing their craft for the winter. Light spars and canvas were stripped off, cushions, blankets and cabin furnish
ings taken out, stoves and cooking utensils packed, and all stowed away in the club house. During the morning
launches hurried to and fro and preparations were made for raising the draw-bridge leading into the lagoon. At 12:15
a team of four horses was attached to strong blocks and tackles, and with a little creaking the bridge was success
fully raised, though not quite so high as it might advantageously have been.
The yachts, towed by launches, then began to file through the bridge. The first to pass through was the yawl
Spray, which was followed by these yachts in the order given: sloops May, Lois, Thetis, Volunteer, Clara, Ella, Ro
ver, Thelma Emelie, AVawona, Halcyon, Juanita, Merope, Cupid, Venito, Mignon, Paul, Queen, Edna. Pride, Amigo,
Truant, Emma, Flirt, Rambler and yawl Seven Bells. The launches Gipsy, Cynthia, Envoy, "Wang and R. Tittel's
Crescle rendered mosf valuable service In towing. The yachts passed through almost without a hitch. The wire
rope stays of two or three caught against the bridge, but they were quickly released without Injury.
The launch "Wailelo was not so fortunate. In trying to pass out of the lagoon Into the bay through the bridge
the falling tide carried her broadside on to the bridge, breaking some of her windows and their frames.
After the yachts came the arks, which, from their size and unwleldiness-caused more trouble. La Fiesta, Pa
loma, Utopia, El Pizo, one belonging to A. P. Rothkopf, and two or three others, were at last all safely got through,
with some soraping of their sails and the loss of a little paint.
Though a large number of the Corinthian yachts are now lying in the lagoon, the following are still out In the
cove: Onimodore Carl Westerfeld's flagship Aeolus, the yawls KJttlwake, Plnta, Arcturus and Naiad, and the
sloops Mistral, Ceres, Wave, Harpoon and Phoenicia. The sloop Nixie will be drawn up on Stone's ways and pro
tected by a canvas cover from the rains. The sloop Stella is drawn up on the beach, and the schooner Bonita Is on
"ways." Thus nearly one-third of fleet will spend the winter outside of the lagoon.

At exactly 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon the transport Zealandia weighed an
chor and pulled out from Pier No. 7 with
seven companies of the First Tennessee
Regiment aboard. As the big vessel
swung around In the stream the great
crowd on the pier sent up a, mighty cheer,
which was answered by the soldiers as
they waved a good-by with their hats.
The soldiers left camp about 9 o'clock In
the morning. The seven companies in
cluded the entire First Battalion, Major
Bayless commanding, and thro companies
of the Second Battalion, Major Cheatham
commanding, and all under the command
of Colonel Smith. The most direct route
to the J transport was taken and by noon
all the men were aboard. A large crowd
assembled at the pier to see the Tennes
seeans off, and the majority of these were
women, who brought flowers for the sol
diers and other last souvenirs

GOD'S METHOD OF PURIFYING
He Places Grave Responsibility Upon
Man That He May Knew How
to Properly Govern Men.
The First Congregational Church was
filled to its utmost capacity last even
ing, the occasion being the song service
of welcome to the pastor, Rev. George
C. Adams, D. D., who has just returned
from his vacation. He has been in the
East â where he has traveled extensively.
The theme of the pastor's sermon was,
"God's Method of Purifying a Nation."
He chose as his text the fortieth verse
of the thirty-second chapter of Jeremiah.
"And I will make an everlasting cove
nant with them that I will not turn away
from them, to do them good, but I will
put my fear in their hearts, that they
shall not depart from me."
Dr. Adams spoke of the fact that the
corruption now existing in the large cities
would be for the present overshadowed,
because the nation's attention was cen
tered in the great questions that were
confronting It. In tnlt connection he
mentioned the pending annexation of the
Philippines and Cuba. He said that men
would have to be placed in the new ter
ritories to govern them, and that their
responsibility would be great, and that
under them would grow up a good people",
who might some day in some measure
effect the purification of this country-
Then he cited the fact that the wisest of
England's rulers had grown up in her
colonies. These men saw the necessity
of good government because their re
sponsibility was pxpat. and that thus it
was God deepened a man's nature by put
ting upon him grave and great responsi
bilities.
During the service the choir sang Rud
yard Kipling's "Recessional," which has
been set to music by DeKoven.
THE HAPPIEST LIFE.
Rev. J. Hemphill Preaches on How
Man Should Live for the Life
of the Hereafter.
Rev. J. Hemphill filled the pulpit of hia
church, the Calvary Presbyterian, last
evening. His topic of discussion was,
"The Happiest Life, and How to Live It,"
and he chose his text from the tenth
chapter and tenth verse of the gospel of
St. John, "I am come that ye may have
life and have it more abundantly. The
preacher began by saying that life had
been likened to vapor that was as noth
ing. Vapor, he said, was steam, and that
was more than nothing, for science by Its
aid was enabled to draw a train from
the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic and
back again in ten days. He then quoted
from a number of the world's greatest
authors, who have treated life as a little
thing and of small consequence, and by
logical deduction showed the folly of
their doctrines.
Life, the Rev. Mr. Hemphill said, was
what we made it, and we could make
little or much of it. It was In our hands
to give a good account of our days on
earth and to make the world the better
for our having lived In it.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
NOT A TIME
TO EXERCISE
SELFISHNESS
Republicans Facing a
Grave Duty.
CAMPAIGN OF WHISPERING
CANDIDATES WATCHING THE
SILENT VOTE.
Ticket Scratching at This Time Can
not Fail to Have a Pernicious
Effect on the National
Party.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 30.
Although but one week will elapse be
fore the State election, there Will no
floub be many changes in the standings
of some of the county candidates in that
period. Politics are mixed in Alameda :
County -badly mixed. The unanimity \
which prevailed locally at the time of the
primary which elected George C. Pardee ;
a candidate for the nomination of Gov
ernor, has disappeared, and a few selfish
office-hunters are inaugurating a return j
to factionalism which cannot but have a j
pernicious effect unless it be stifled or i
killed off during the coming week.
The Republican county ticket fairly ;
represents the wishes of the party. All j
talk of favoritism, slates, foreign bosses
and similar things are but the walla of
disappointed and out-generaled cand Â»
dates. In politics, as In business, the j
Bhrewdest and most persevering reach
the top. and this is true of mose candi
dates nominated at San Leandro. It is
but fair to presume that those Intelligent
gentlemen who nominated the ticket I
knew wthat they were doing. It is not j
reasonable to presume that when they j
voted to nominate Judge Allen, Mr. Jor
dan or Mr. Dalton they did right and that
they suddenly lost their senses and be- ;
came irresponsible when tney nominated â 
Mr. Church and Mr. Talcott. Part of the
district represented In the Board of Su
pervtsors by Mr. church is the Fourth
Ward. Among the representative Repub- |
licans who compose the Fourth Ward
delegation was Dr. George C. Pardee. If
Mr. Church deserves the confidence of Dr.
Pardee he can certainly be trusted by the
remainder of the party.
For reasons kept below the surface, but
which are none the less apparent, an ef
fort is being made to throw the control in
the Board of Supervisors to the Demo
crats, and regrettable as the fact may be,
some Republicans a-e aiding the move
ment. Such practices degrade party poli
tics and reduce them to the level of the
ephemeral organizations that bob up in
the morning and die with the darkness.
Buch practices do not build up Repub
licanism. The fact seems to be lost sight
of In this county that a stream cannot be
purer than its source. The inspiration
imparted last week by the Hon. Webster
Davis to the vnst multitudes that assem
bled in the big tabernacle, would give
this county a larger Republican majority
than she na. c ever known if those who lis
tened to the great speaker would be lead
by th^r convictions and not by their per
sonal prejudice or selfishness. Thf broad
spirit of his address was a refreshing
contrast to the personal plaints for votes
â with which the voters have been satiated
for over a month. Mr. Davis did not
once ask that any one vote the Republl
can tlrk.t. He simply told in language
forecful. as simple, of the great principles
of the party and left the rest to the in
telligence of the voters. He advocated.
IN DESPERATION SHE
WOULD DON TROUSERS
Pretty Waitress Finds Her Sex a Serious Drawback in Earning
Her Livelihood.
-i-tDITOR Query Column: Will you kindly Inform me, through your paper, if
there is any way I could get permission Inform me. through and to whom
there Is any way I could get permission to wear male attire and to whom
i t I would have to appeal?
By so doing you would greatly obligp. a woman who has for years been doing
a man's work at starvation wages and who Is drfVen to desperation.
A. B. C, Mission street.
In a vast tenement house on Mission street lives A. B. C. Her four sisters
share her cramped quarters, and, like bar, strive to earn their livelihood as wait
resses. Ail the girls urr: employed in one of the largest downtown restaurants
that make a. specialty of the employment of women, at .wages that are nearly less
than 50 per cent of what man commands.
A. B. CL, though only about twenty, has known for years the responsibility
of taking care of herself and her many sisters. Life for her has had no pleas
ures. It has been work from early morning till late at nightâ work with aching
brow and heavy heartâ work and smile and earn $6 26 per week.
Poor little waitress! Spending her Sunday, her day of rest. In tidying up the
"housekeeping rooms," mending sisters' clothes and washing aprons and caps for
next week's duties.
"I'm desperate." said the little girl, "that is all there is about It. Doing a
man's work and getting far less than a man's pay is not very amusing. I must
earn more money. I can't live on the salary I am now receiving and there is no
possibility of an increase of wages. I ask no consideration tot my sex, but I do
ask for equal rights. There are many thingsâ disagreeable thingsâ that employ
ers never think of asking a man to do (and they do ask me), but that is not what
I complain of. I want to be paid for the work I do.
No A. B. C, there Is no way In which you may gain permission to wear male
attire ' so as you may command the salary your work deserves. But there ought
to be a way that you may command that salary and therein lies the work of the
champions of the persecuted, the weak, the unjustly nerved.
by natural inference, the election of every
Republican candidate. He painted In
plain words the duty of every citizen to
sunnort the administration, especially at
this time, when the eyes of the world are
turned toward this country and her for
eign relations more than at any time in
American history.
Without a suggestion of bombast ana
without rendering himself liable to the
charge of being verbose, Webster Davis
left on his vast audience this deduction
from his speech: "If the next Congress
should not be of such a political complex
ion as to show to all nations that Amer
ica indorses and supports the acts of her
President and her army and navy during
the past year, what view would the
European powers take of the Spanish-
American peace commission now sitting
at Paris?"
He did not answer the question, but left
it to the common sense of his hearers.
No better example of duty could be plac
ed before the Republican party in Ala
meda at this time. In order to support j
the administration of President McKlnley j
it is necessary that Congress should be
as near a unit as possible. If the princi
ples df Republicanism are right for a
Congressman, they are right for a Gov
ernor, for a County Assessor. Recorder
i r i 'ounty Clerk, for a Supervisor and
even for a township Constable. Only by
building from the firmest of foundations j
can a staple structure be reared, and If j
it be right to vote one part of the Re- I
publican ticket. It must be right to vote j
it all, for the intelligent men that nomi- ;
nated one secion as faithfully represented i
the party as those who nominated other |
sections. If party fealty means any thing
it means this.
The defeating of the bond Issue on Sat- !
urday has again drawn attention to the I
"silent" vote of this city. It was stated |
in this paper on Saturday morning that |
the bonds hung upon the silent vote and j
although all the surface Indication were :
favorable to the proposition, the voters ]
who do their thinking at home were nu
merous enough to prevent the. necessary
two-thirds majority.
Oakland has had many startling ex-!
perlfnces with her silent voters. One of j
the most notable experiences of this was ;
the election of John L. Davie for Mayor
four years ago. His opponent. J. W. Nel
son, had the nomination of both the great i
parties and also of the Non-Partisan or- j
ganization, then In the zenith of its power.
Everything was apparently for Nelson till ;
the votes were counted and it was then j
discovered that Davie was elected. H. P.
Dalton was likewise elected by the silent
voters, when surface indications pointed
to the election of R. S. Leckie. At this
time the center of interest to politicians
is the silent vote that will be registered j
next week. There has probably never
been a campaign when so much whisper
ing has been done, and the effect of this !
will decide the fate of many candidates.
The fate of the bonds is proof that the
balance of power is still with those who â 
do not voice their politics on the side
walks. STI'ART A. BOOTH.
ANNUAL HARVEST FESTIVAL.
Appropriate Exercises at Many Oak
land Churches.
OAKLAND, Oct. 30.â The annual "har
vest festival" was observed at some of j
i the local churches to-night. At the First
Presbyterian Church the space about the
pulpit was a veritable picture of plenty.
Fall stalks of corn graced the sides, and i
nt the base and upon the platform was
any amount of fruits of the landâ apples,
provisions, preserves, packages of mush i
and cornmeal, sacks of flour, and in Bhort,
a rare quantity of wholesome good things
that the deacons and deaconesses of the
church will distribute among the needy j
families of this city. The musical ser- ;
vices was specially arranged for the large |
choir, and the competent quartet of the
church was heard to advantage in Dud- i
ley Buck's "Festival Gloria in Excelsis."
Rev! Dr. Coyle's sermon was short, per
tinent and most appropriate to the occa- j
Eton. He spoke on the special reasons of j
thanksgiving. First on the crops of the
country at large. Secondly of the success
of the country's flag; its wonderful his
tory during the past six months; and he '
expressed the hope that it continue to |
float where once planted as long as it
floats over the capitol at Washington.
The evening services at the First Con- ;
gregational Church 'also consisted of a i
harvest festival by the church and Sun
day school. Rev. Charles R. Brown, the
pastor, delivered an appropriate address. |
and the musical selections rendered by |
the choir were from "Harvest Cantata," ;
by Dr. Garrett.
'At the First M. E. Church an autumnal
service was held this morning. This was :
arranged by the young people's society of
the church specially for the elderly folks.
After an address by the pastor a reminis

A MOTHER'S SAD BURDEN.
1 Mrs. Enos' Little One Dies From the !
Injuries Sustained by a Fall.
OAKLAND, Oct. 30.â Mrs. Joe Enos re
turned to her home, near Haywards, late
last night, carrying in her arms the dead
body of her 11-monthsold baby with whom j
she fell down a cellar stairs at Davis* :
grocery, corner of Ninth and Wash- i
ington streets, yesterday afternoon.
The child's skull was 'fractured, and j
though Drs. Sharp and Church success- j
fully performed the operation of triphin
ing in the hope of saving the little one's j
life, the subsequent strain was too great, ;
and during the evening the child died
at the office of Dr. W. B. Church.
The grief-stricken mother hastened
with the corpse to her home, and not un- ;
til to-day was the Coroner's office notified, j
when it was learned that Dr. Church had â 
signed the death certificate. On this,
however, no permit for the burial could |
have been obtained from the Health Offl- !
ecr. An inquest will be held to-morrow I
night.

score of 6to 0. It is expected that a dele
gation of from 300 to 400 men will ac
company the army team over to the uni
versity town, and the college students
will meet them at the train in a body and
escort them to the field.

ROCK ISLAND BOY
IS TOO CLEVER
FOR MAYFLOWER
Won the Big Coursing
Match Yesterday.
EXCITEMENT RAN VERY HIGH
A GOOD CROWD AND NUMEROUS
SPORTS AT INGLESIDE.
Rocket, a Short-Ender, Pulled Down
the All-Age Stake â Pleasant
Girl Beats Star of Cuba
for the Sapling.
The big event of the day, a match race
between Mayflower and Rock Island Boy,
was witnessed by hundreds of people at
Ingleside yesterday afternoon. The dog
proved himself too much for the bitch.
This became evident in the first heat of
the stake, so the bettors played their
money accordingly. The odds on the first
heat. were 1 to 2 "in Rock Island's favor,
but for the two successive heats they
tapped off at 5 to 3.
Eleven hundred and fifty dollars Â»c a
pile of money to be at stake, consequently
every advantage and clever play of either
dog brought forth a thunder of applause.
In ..ie first go Rock Island Boy led up
by three lengths on the hare and served
himself for the next turn. The hare
swung to the bitch for the kill. Score. 4
to 2, in favor of Rock Island Boy. A few
more points were made in the second
course, which was sensational and excit
ing. Rock Island Boy led in the run-up,
the bitch laying; off her game, and the dog
took the turn by three lengths, thus keep
ing possession of the hare for several
points and allowing the bitch only five for
her work. Score, 14 to 5. The third round
was short and may be told in a few
words: Rock Island Boy led off by three
lengths, serving himself for several more.
The bitch killed, but it was all she ac
complished, for the score stood 8 to 2.
In the all-age stake three dogs, all
owned by the same man, came in ror
final competition. Ordinarily the winner
of the last course would be declared win
ner of the stake, as there la no way of
guarding the entries, but in justice to ,the
betting public the rules of the Ingleside
Club require the owner to run his dogs to
a finish, and this finish yesterday added
anoti er dog to the long list of short-end
ers which had been coming in all day.
Royal Buck, Rocket and Flyaway were
mixed up in it for the last. Rocket beat
Flyaway in the last course of the fourth
round and thus Royal Buck and Rocket
stood against each other. The betting
was on Royal Buck and the odds were 2
to 1, but he made a fatal drive and fell
and his game was up. The dog was so
badly hurt he had to be packed in on! the
field.
The sapling stake was interesting.
Pleasant Girl won. Star of Cuba, who
was against her in the final did . some
clever work and greatly encouraged her
owners.
The results were as follows:

MIALMO WINS.
J. Dean's Clever Hound Captures An

Mialmo, the good hound owned by J.
Dean, captured the open stake at Union
Coursing P;irk yesterday and the old yet
game hound Firm Friend, owned by the
Pasha Kennels, was runner-up. The lat
ter dotf made pome grand performances
all through the day. Firm Friend is get
ting to be an aged dog and would no

Life.

BEAST.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KINGMAN, Ariz., Oct., 30. â Judge
Spates, an- old mining prospector and
hunter, has arrived here, after a jour
ney with his little burro caravan from
Southern Utah, 150 miles distant, and
is describing to his friends an encoun
ter he had with a grizzly bear a few
days previous to his s irting. He was
hunting for game and prospecting for
gold. Having been out farther than
usual from camp, he was returning
home post hr te in order to arrive be
fore darkness overtook him, when he
was suddenly confronted by a bear
right in his path and not more than
thirty feet away.
Spates brought his Winchester rifle
to his shoulder and fired. He missed,
and a bound brought the beast so close
to him that he could not fire again. Then
a struggle to the death commenced. It
lasted a half-hour or more. Spates
tried clubing his gun, but this was of
no avail, for he was in the embrace of
the grizzly. Next he fought desperately
with his fists.
Spates is a powerful man, though well
along in years. Seeing that the beast
was gaining the mastery he gave the
bear a powerful blow directly between
the eyes, which for the moment stag
gered it backward. This gave, him an
opportunity to reach to his belt for his
knife.
By this time the bear was again upon
him. With a desperate thrust the
brave hunter met the rush, plunging
the full length of the knife into the
heart of the beast. The bear dropped
dead and his conqueror fell to the
ground, bleeding and exhausted.
Regaining his strength sufficiently
Spates made his way home. He re
turned the following morning to view
the scene of his narrow escape from
death and to dress his game. It was a
powerful beast, and is believed to have
weighed 500 o\' more pounds. Most of
the meat wail feft hanging up in his
cabin, and the balance brought along,
together with the hide, which is soon to
go through a process of tanning and
dressing, to be kept as a memento of
the adventure.

his rooms at the Palace Hotel yesterday
and will resume his campaign duties this j
morning. I>ate Saturday night he was
very nearly overcome with exhaustion by
reason of loss of sleep and constant work j
In traveling and speaking. His powers ,
of mental and physlclal endurance are re- j
markable. but the tension Saturday j
night, following the tour of Northern
California and the trips through Napa

Mr. Gage has filled every appointment '
fo far made for him by the Republican
State Central Committee and has als^ :
made side trips not embraced in the com- j
mlttee's schedule. In this regard he has
broken the record of gubernatorial candi
dates. He will stay with the work to the
finish, nr as long, at least, as he is able
to speak a word or walk a step.

VAN FLEET'S
MALIGNERS
ANSWERED
Jurists of the State
Support Him.
THEY STAND FOR HAIR PLAY
HIS DECISION WAS BASED ON
THE LAW.
No Invidious Distinction Was Made
Between the Child of the Rich
and the Poor Man â Judi-
cial Comment!.
"There is not in this country one rule
of law for the rich and a different rule
for the poor."
The following correspondence ex
plains itself and conclusively shows
that great injustice has been done in
misrepresenting a decision of our high
est judicial tribunal:
To the Honorable, the Commissioners
of the Supreme Court and the Judges of
the Superior Courts of the State of Cali
forniaâGentlemen: We, the undersigned
members of the bar of California, ven
ture to represent to you that a most
serious misunderstanding exists in the
minds of some of the good people of the
State relative to a decision recently ren
dered by the Supreme Court (Justice Van
Fleet writing the opinion) in the case of
Fox vs. the Oakland Railroad Company,
and reported in 118 California, page 55.
It has been publicly charged that in said
decision our Supreme Court held that in
assessing damages for the death of a
minor child, the child of poor parents is not
of as much value as the child of rich
parents. â¢
We submit that no such opinion has
rendered by the Supreme Court or
any member of that court in the case
referred to. or in any case; and that be
ing so, it is but just that the facts should
be stated so that people outside of the
profession may know the truth.
We, therefore, respectfully ask you to
briefly state the facts relating to that de
cision. Very respectfully,
MORRIS M. ESTEE.
JOHN GARBER,
GARRET W. McENERNET.
To this letter many answers have
been received. The following form of
reply was signed by Judges of the Su
perior Courts whose signatures are ap
pended:
To the People of California: We, the
undersigned Commissioners of the Su
preme Court and Judges of the Superior
Courts of the State of California, re
spectfully represent that we are familiar
with the decision rendered by th<- 5 l
preme Court of California in the cast- of
Fox vs. the Oakland Railroad Company,
and reported in 118 Cal.. page ."5.
The opinion in that case was written
by Justice Van Fleet, and was concurred
in in department by Chief Justice Beatty
and Justice Harrison and was confirmed
by the other Justices of the Supreme
Court by a refusal to grant a rehearing.
The opinion correctly states the law of
this State on the question involved there
in, and it nowhere appears therein that
in an action for damages for the death of
a minor child, that the child of a poor
man is not as valuable as that of a rich
man. On the contrary, the opinion states
in words that:
After a careful review of the au
thorities we are clearly of the opin
ion that the question of the parents'
neglect cannot be made to turn upon
the state of his finances, and tnat
the rulings of the lower court in this
respect were erroneous.
Neither the Supreme Court of this State
nor any Justice thereof has ever rendered
an opinion to the effect that there was
a difference in value in the life of a minor
child dependent upon the financial con
dition or its parents.
We venture to make this statement to
the public at the request of certain mem
bers of the bar and in vindication of the
truth in this matter.
The foregoing is signed by the follow
ing Judges of the Superior Courts in the
counties named: J. C. B. Hebbard,
George H. Bahrs, Edward A. Belcher,
city and county of San Francisco; E. S.
Torrance, San Diego; John L. Campbell,
Frank F. Oster, San Bernardino; J. W.
Ballard. Orange; W. H. Clark. M. T.
Allen, Los Angeles; Wheaton A. Gray,
Tulare; J. R. Webb, E. W. Rialey, Fres
no; N. A. Dorn, Monterey; Edward J.
Jones. San Joaquin; E. C. Hart, Sacra
mento; Frank T. Nilon, Nevada; A. J.
Buckles, Solano; W. G. Lorigan, Santa
Clara; Albert G. Burnett, Sonoma; E. D.
Ham, Napa; E. E. Gadis, Yolo; Joseph
P. Jones, Contra Costa; J. M. Mannon,
Mendocino; Edward Sweeney, Shasta; E.
A. Davis. Yuba and Sutter; F. A. Kelly,
Lassen; T. E. Jones, Trinity; Stanley A.
Smith. Sierra: Niles Searls, I. S. Belr-her,
John Hayes, N. P. Chipman, E. W. Britt,
Commissioners of the Supreme Court.
Several oth^r Judges expressed similar
opinions, and in addition thereto made
statements from which the following ex
tracts are given:
Hon. Joseph H. Budd, San Joaquin â
On the contrary, that court (the Su
preme Court) stated in the opinion in
this case of Fox, quoting with approval
the language of Judge Dillon, that
"there is not in this country one rule
of law for the rich and a different rule
for the poor."
Hon. â William O. Miner. Stanislaus â
As a matter of common fairness I will
say that I am familiar -with the opin
ion of the court in the case of Fox vs.
Oakland Consolidated Railway Com
pany, and that Judge Van Fleet did not
say in the opinion in that case nor in
any other that I know of that the child
of a poor man is not as valuable as the
child of a rich man.
Hon. Carroll Cook, city and county of
San Francisco â I will say, after a care
ful reading of the opinion filed in the
Fox case, I am unable to find any state
ment therein from which it can be in
ferred that the court held the value of
a poor man's child to be less than that
of the child of a rich man. On the con
trary, from some of the language used
the contrary can be inferred, for lan
guage is used from which the inference
can be clearly drawn that the child of
a laborer is of greater value to him,
pecuniarily, than would be the child of
a capitalist to him.
Hon. Lucian Shaw, Los Angeles â "The
value of the life of a child was not in
controversy in the Fox case. The ques
tion at issue was the value of the serv
ices which the child would probably
have rendered to or for its parents dur
ing its minority if It had lived." Judge
Shaw then takes the same view as
stated by Judge Cook as to the infer
ence in favor of the poor man's child.
Hon. F. M. Angeilotti, Marinâ l have
carefully examined the opinion in the
Fox case and I am unable to find any
thing therein that intimates that the
value of the life of a poor man's son is
less than that of a rich man's son. In
view of some of the charges that have
been made against Judge Van Fleet in
regard to this opinion, I deem it only
fair to make this statement.
Hon. John F. Allison, Tehama â After
stating clearly the real issue in the
case Judge Fllison adds:
"While it is true, as suggested in the
press, that a boy may become a profes
sional man or successful business man,
the court could not overlook the fact
that when he did become either the one
or the other hÂ» would have obtained
his majority, and with his majority his
father's rljarht to his services would
cease and thpy would be the exclusive
property of the boy. So the court was
limited in ite investigation of the case

simply and solely to the question. How
much money, net, would the boy have
made for his father between the day
he was killed and the day he would

court was thus limited not because it
wanted to be but because it thus found

Judges did, Judge York adds:

POLITICS IN THE
ENCINAL CITY
PARTY LINES GTVE WAY TO
LOCAL PRIDE.
Oscar Rogers and T. C. Stoddard Sup
ported by Both. Republicans
and Democrats.
1 ALAMEDA, Oct. 30.â As election day ap
proaches the political situation in A la
in., ia becomes more and more compli
cated. This city has candidates on the
various tickets for Sheriff, County Clerk,
| Tax Collector, Senator and Assemblyman,
'â  and the indications are that the citizens
will cast party affiliation aside and give
a. I \k vote to the local candidates regard
less of the side of the political fence on
which they srand. They seem to look
upon the matter as one of local pride en
tirely.
City Marshal Rogers, Republican candi
date for Sheriff, has practically no oppo
sition in this city. Louis Schaffer, in
dependent, has made no effort to get an
Alameda vote. T. C. Landergan, Demo
crat, has had his campaign managers
here offering various Inducements for
support, but they were given no encour
agement whatever. Rogers will not only
receive the entire strength of the Repub
licans, but will get fully 50 per cent of
the local Democratic vote as well.
J B. Barber, Republican candidate for
Tax Collector, will not receive as much
outside support as Rogers, but he will
poll the full vote of his party, and the
focal campaign managers ligure that he
will go out of his home city with a ma
jority of between 700 and 800 votes.
T C. Stoddanl, Democratic candidate
for County <"lerk. occupies a position in
the political situation here almost similar
M that of Rogers. Frank Jordan's friends
claim that Alameda will give him a small
majority Conservative Republicans con
cede that if he carries this city at all it
will be by a narrow margin. On the other
hand many leading Republicans have
identified themselves with the Btoddard
fight and they figure out a clear majority
for him. In both the Sheriff's and Coun
ty Clerk's contest party lines are cutting
hardly any figure in Alameda.
E K. Taylor, for State Senator, is pit

DETECTIVE BEE IS DEAD.
Passed Away at His Residence on Broadway
From a Complication of Diseases After
Two Months' Illness.
THE Police Department lost one of its ablest and most successful offi
cers in the detection of crime when Detective Joseph Bee died early
yesterday morning at his residence, 1706 Broadway. Two years ago,
ifter an attack of grip, he complained of stomach trouble and he was
granted leave of absence for six months to make a trip to England for
health, but he stuck to his arduous
work until about eight weeks ago.
when he was forced to take to his
bed. He could not assimilate his
food, which weakened his heart and
dropsy added to the complications.
He died about 5 o'clock yesterday
morning, and Sergeant Anderson,
who sat up with him all night, tele
phoned thp sad news to the Central
Police Station. He leaves a wife and
a married daughter to mourn â¢ his
a corporal on December 28, IS7R, and
a detective on April 1, 1884. Prior to his promotion as a detective he was
on special duty for several years. No one feels his death more keenly than
Detective Gus Harper, as the two worked together for the past seven
teen years, and during all that time they never disagreed. Their par
ticular line was the detection of burglars, and they were eminently suc
cessful. They were detailed on almost every important case.
Bee was universally beloved and respected. Every one who had any
business with him became his friend, inside and outside his field of
operations. He was a fearless officer and an honest, straightforward,
manly man. His death has cast a gloom over the department, as his
genial, kindly presence will be sadly missed.
will be a mere matter of popularity and
not party. Joseph R. Knowland (Repub
lican), who aspires to repreSeni this dis
trict In the Legislature, has, fr in all In
dications, a walkover. His opponent is
an Oakland man who hus not yet had
the hardihood to extend his can\-iss into
Alameda.
In the contest for township officers In
terest has centered on the fight for Jus
tice of the Peace. Henry Morris was
nominated by the Republicans, and as a
compliment to him the Democrats placed
no one on their ticket to oppose him.
D. T. Hard, who failed to get the nomina
tion at the San Leandro convention, has
come out as an Independeni candidate.
He has endeavored to pull the G. A. R.
into his fight, claiming that the veterans
residing in this city have not been prop
erly recognized in the distribution of
political favors. The G. A. R. men, how
ever say they are well satisfied and will
keep th'elr hands off. At present Ala
mÂ» da mpmhprs of the organization occupy
the following public positions: One Su
perior Judge, one Court Commissioner,
one county expert, three employes of the
Alameda School Department, two police
officers, one City Trustee, one bridge ten
der and one poundmastrr.

lightened any when it was learned that
the flag was half masted out of respect
to the memory of Rudolph Neumann, the
able and popular manager of the Alaska
Commercial Company. The deceased was
one of the best-known and best-liked
business men in Alaska.
"Mr. Neumann's death was a very
tragic one," said J. Homer Fritch, the
well-known coal man, who was a pas
senger by the Portland from St. Michael.
"He was the general agent for the com
pany throughout Alaska, and after set
tling up his business for the year at
Unalaska went over to L'nga on the
schooner Pearl to wind up affairs there.
In company with T. C. Mayon, superin
tendent of the Apollo mine, he was going
over the company's property.
"A new vein had been struck In the
Sitka mine and Mayon and Neumann
were going down the shaft to Inspect It.
At the 100-foot level both men got out of
tne bucket and were standing on a plat
form, Mr. Neumann holding on to one of
the uprights. Mr. Neumann made some
remark about the darkness, and Mr.
Mayon asked him, 'Can you see?' 'Yes,
I'm all right,' was the answer, but the
next instant he got dizzy and went crash
ing to the bottom of the shaft 209 feet
below. How Superintendent Mayon got
out of the mine he does not know, but
he succeeded somehow and sent a party
of miners down after the body. It was
brought to the surface and embalmed by
the doctor on the island and sent to San
Francisco for interment.
"The Indians were broken-hearted over
the death of Mr. Neumann. He was like
a lather to them, and lacy were still
weeping for him when we left the Isl
and."
Leopold Neumann, the well-known
dentist, was a brother of the deceased,
and I'aul Neumann, Attorney General of
Hawaii under the monarchy, was his
uncle. O.he Messrs. Sloss, Mr. Neumann
and a host of the deceased's friends were
down at the wharf to meet him, only to
be confronted by the Portland with her
flag at half mast.
Rudolph Neumann first went to Alaska
in 1873 in the schooner Eustace with Cap
tain Blair. He became the Alaska Com
mercial Company's agent at St. Michael
in that year, but when Alfred Greenbaum
retired he became general agent for the
concern with headquarters at Unalaska.
The news from the Yukon is not very
encouraging. The labor market is glutted
and thousands of gold hunters are wish
ing they were home again. At least a
dozen river steamers are stuck on the
sandbars of the river, and not one of
them will be saved. The Dawson City,
which left here in June last wuh a party
among which was "Chancy" Bruce of
the yacht Rover, was a total wreck.
She went on a bar in the Yukon flats and
broke her back. The gold hunters de
serted her and were making the best of
the circumstances at St. Michael when
the Portland sailed.
The Herman and Tacoma of the Liebes
fleet were also on sandbars and in dan
gerous positions. The Linda pulled on the
Herman for a whole day in an effort to
get her off, but failed. The other river
boats were all in bad positions, and the
chances are that they will go to pieces
in the spring when the ice breaks up.
The gold hunters who were to have gone
to Dawson on the river steamer City of
Paris played in hard luck. After waiting
nearly a month for their vessel they gave
it up in disgust, sold all their outfits and
fittings for the steamer and left for Daw
son to go home by the trail. Shortly
afterward the City of Paris arrived at
Dutch Harbor in tow of the tug Mystery.
They were forty-two days getting from
Nanaimo, B. C, to Dutch Harbor, so it
was no wonder they were given up for
lost.
Ice was making in the Yukon and there
was thin ice at Dutch Harbor when the
Portland sailed on October 11. The Port
land towed the Alaska Commercial Com
pany's tug Sadie from St. Michael to
Dutch Harbor, and she is now in winter
quarters there.
The Portland brought very little gold
from the Alaskan mines.
