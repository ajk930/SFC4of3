LOS ANGELES. Jan. 17.â The publi
cation in The Call this morning of the
position in which the city of Los An
geles finds Itself, as regards the public
ownership of a water distributing
plant, has already borne fruit. This is
despite the fact that the paper contain
ing the first comprehensive review of
the matter that has ever been printed
has not yet reached this city.
- At 10:10 this morning a messenger
/ arrived at the City Hall in breathless
Â â â â¦haste. He carried in his hand a letter
\ Addressed: "Hon. F. M. Nickell. chair
pan of the Water Supply CommiUee."
i. The messenger was in a great hurry to
/ find Councilman Nickell. He delivered
. f the message and a few minutes there
|'; after Mr. Nickeil; as chairman of the .
\ ; Â»Â»KVater Supply Committee, submitted to
;\ the Council the following communica
'-.* tion from the City Water Company:
i ' "We received your note of December 29,
m 1897. and have been desirous of making
â¢ reply thereto at the earliest moment
practicable.
"We have submitted to the attorneys of
the water companies, who are here in the
city, the question of how to approach this
matter in the event we can agree upon .
prices. The legal difficulties of carrying
that agreement into effect are. as we are
advised, considerable, and it is our de- !
elre, at the same time we negotiate with
you as to terms,- to also negotiate with
you as to the mode of carrying our con- :
elusions into effect, should' we come to
conclusions.
"One of our attorneys is absent, but
â¢will return shortly, and If agreeable to
your committee we would like to have .
. you meet a representative or representa- i
tives to be appointed by the companies \
In a short time for the purpose of con- )
sidering these questions. Senator White,
one of the attorneys, will be In the city â 
some time about the middle of February,
and we should like to have matters in ,
such shape that he. In connection with i
our attorneys here, may determine on the
legal proceedings to bring matters be- I
tween us to a conclusion.
"Representatives will be appointed by
the boards of directors and we shall in
form you at once who they are, and a !
time can be arranged to get together and '
discuss the plans of procedure, and that it
may be submitted to the attorneys for the i
respective parties for their consideration :
' as to Its legal feasibility.
"We desire also, if -we can agree- upon !
terms, to bring the. matter to a conclusion i
at once, and to that end we are working
â with our stockholders and endeavoring to
get the consent of all of them that will
authorize us to carry the transaction Into ;
effect as soon as the proceedings neces
sary for that purpose can be taken; and
â¢we have strong hopes that in th*Â» course
of the next five or six weeks we shall
have the consent of all of them.
c "S. H. MOTT, Secretary."
This communication is the first result
of The Call's exposition of the local wa
ter situation. As soon as The Call ap
peared on the streets of San Francisco
this morning, the secretary here was
immediately informed by wire of what
M it contained. It was then that the
" characteristic communication* given
above was forwarded to the Council,
post-haste. The people of Los Angeles,
however, thoroughly understand the
"Water Company's tactics, and this
â¢\.' communication carries absolutely no
â¢'.â â¢-â ' . -weight whatever.
The popular feeling is most concisely
stated by Mayor M. P. Snyder, who In
talking about the latest communication
â¢'â '.'â  this evening said:
"It Is but Illustrative of the methods
of the Water Company In the past in
blocking the will of the people. They
have always claimed they were ready
and desirous of bringing about nego
tiations whereby the i.'lty would come
into possession of its plant at any early
date. Then, through their news
papers, attorneys and understrappers
generally, they have always imme
diately set about to block every possi
ble settlement which could be obtained.
In this latest communication, . which
hns been sent forth, and which in mV
Judgment is the result of The Call's
work, there is absolutely nothing sew.
Whenever we have in the past succeed
ed In getting matters down to a point
where the Water Company was com
pelled to <lo something, it has invaria
bly set forth that some o^e or the other
of its attorneys was absent from the
city, and that for that reason it could
not proceei. The directors now claim
that Senator "White is away and that
thf-refore they are privileged to delay
matters. They all knew White was go
ing to be absent from the city during
the session of Congress, and it is prob
able he will continue to be away for
B orne time to come, as this is thÂ« long
session of Congress.
"Put this water question has got to

COMPANY.
be settled, and the water company
must secure attorneys who will be pres
ent. The directors have about exhaust
ed excuses on that line. I am just as
confident now that the water company
has no more intention of entering into
negotiations in pood faith with the city
than it has of deeding its property to a
charity, as I was a year ago.
"We have been striving ever since I
went into office to get the company
down to business. But It has delayed
and procrastinated and put matters off.
It has muzzled the daily press and pre
vented the people gaining any accurate
information as to what the situation as
to- municipal ownership was. Every ef
fort we have made to do something for
the people in this matter the Times,
Herald and Express have ridiculed and
made light of. In the Council the wa
ter company's forces are strongly or
ganized and held well in hand.
"The corporation is playing for a
stake of a million and a half, and It can
afford to- effect many combinations to
carry Its point. Everything is being
carefully looked after by the manipu
lators.
"Now that The Call has determined
to give the people of Los Angeles a
hearing in the settlement of this great
and important question, which means
so much for the municipality, we have
renewed hope of our ability to protect
the people's" interest?. Tbe communi
cation that was put tn to-day by Sec
retary Mott is a Jumble of words ab
solutely without meaning. It was evi
dently written in great haste, and is
the first recognition by the water com
pany of The Call's labor."
One of the men who was foremost In
pushing the petition asking the Coun
cil to call a special election to vote
bonds so that the city could build a
water distributing plant of its own in
dependent of the city water company's
trust was A. W. Fisher, a well-known
business man and taxpayer. Mr. Fish
er has always been an ardent and con
sistent advocate of municipal owner
ship of the water plant, and to a Call
correspondent he this evening gave his
views of the matter as follows:
"The city water company claims per
fect willingness to bring to a conclu
sion the negotiations whereby the mu
nicipality is to acquire the plant. I
have arrived at the conclusion that It
don't contemplate anything of the kind.
It is not now, and never has been, deal
ing in good faith with the city. The
water company people claim they are
willing to give up if a fair price is
awarded them for their rusty streaks

of Iron pipe. What they mean by that
is that if the people will submit to a
robbery of $1,800,000, they will consent
to retire. They want us to pay $3,000,
000 for a plant that is at a liberal esti
mate not worth over $1,200,000.
"It is perhaps true that they would
be perfectly willing to have a bond
election called to vote bonds to pay
them this exorbitant figure for their
old junk. They know, and we all know,
that the people would not consent to
pay any such figure for the plant, and
the bond scheme would be defeated.
This is what the water company wants
done. They would certainly herald
the result far and near as evidence of
the f.ict that the voters of Los An-
F-lÂ« s had pronounced against munici
pal ownership of a water plant.
"The truth of the matter is nine
teen-twentieths of the people of this
community are a unit for it. and they
propose to have It. Hut, at the same
time, they will not consent to any
proposition that consummates a cold
blooded hold-up of a million and a half
or more. The net Income of the
water company is about J.", 00.000 per
year. They can afford to spend $200.
(>oo or 5300. <X>0 per annum for a long
period of years delaying this matter
and holding off. Then their Idea Is
that they can at an parly date get a
Council and Mayor who will renew
their lease for a long term. This will
give them another opportunity to sand
bag the water consumers and accumu
late millions. The present plant is ob
viously Inadequate to the wants of the
city, as every consumer knows. The
mains are Inadequate as to size, and
the system is for a village and not a
great city. One of the great desidera
ta to be obtained by municipal own
ership is a plant fully and amply ade
quate to a city's needs.
"It Is now a year since I actively
took this matter up. I looked upon
it as a part of my duty as a citizen
and I am going to stay with it to the
end. During the past twelve months,
though, we who have been honestly
striving for municipal ownership have
met with many discouragements. Un
derstand, we do not desire or advocate
the taking of anything trnm the City
Water Company that belongs to it
without giving it value for every dol
lar. We are willing to be liberal with
th<Â» corporation, but we are not in fa
vor of being robbed.
"One of the great obstacles we have
met with has been the combination ex
isting among the three daily pppers.
They have allâ the Time*, Herald anil
Expressâ been as one in their policy of
protecting the water company in this
all-Important controversy. They have
refused absolutely to give any one who
'stood for the people a hearing. All
avenues of reaching tho people in or
der to inform them as to the gravity of
the situation have been cut off. The
newspaper combine has been all-pow
erful, and any Intelligent discussion of
this question has been tabooed. This
has made It very difficult to keep the
masses informed, but, now that The
Call has taken up the matter, we are
going to be released from the news
paper thralldom which has held us
down. We want The Call to give full
Justice to the Water Company's side
of the case, and we know that It will.
But at the same time we shall expect
it to do what the syndicated dally pa
pers of Los Angeles have not done â
that If. to keep the people Informed
as to th'-lr side of the case and to let
them know when their rights are In
jeopardy.
"The public officials chosen at the
last municipal election were all pledged
solemnly to do everything in their pow
â¢er to effect' municipal ownership. Of
nine Councilmen, only two have kept
their pledges. The other seven h.-f*e
', equivocated and shuffled around until
i the people do not know where they
stand. Councilman Nickel], as chair
j man of the Water Supply Committee,
| has exhibited unpardonable weakness,
while Councilman Toll, as a member of
that committee, has rather acted ns a
1 special pleader for the Water Company
than otherwise. And so I might go on
and enumerate.
"I superintended the circulation of
the petition asking the Council to call
a special election to vote bonds to build
an Independent plant. I talked with
hundreds of citizens and taxpayers
then, and I know the sentiment of the
people. They arÂ« in deadly earnest In
this matter.
"We realize that we have a hard
fiKht on hand, but we are enlisted for
it, and we are going to stay with it to
the end. Thus far we have received no
aid, support or help of any kind or
character in this contest fÂ«>r the people
from the League for Better City Gov
ernment. We did not look for any help
from that organization and we have
not been dloappointed."

Special Dispatch to The CalL
PARIS, Jan. 17.â A great anti-Drey
fus and antl-Pemltic meeting at the
Tivoli Vauxhall produced extraordinary
scenes. The neighborhood was pa
trolled by police, mounted and on foot,
and the rapidly growing crowd in
creased the excitement. At 9 o"clock,
on the opening of the meeting, the hall
was a seething sea of humanity, crowd
ing every part, gesticulating, shouting,
"A bas Zola," "Vive lArmee," and
"Vive revolution soclale." The members
of the anti-Semitic committee display
ed banners bearing the words, "Death
to the Jews," and wore lnscripti s. It
was soon seen that the 5000 present
consisted largely of anarchists and
others bent on opposing the students.
On M. Guerin, the president, propos
ing that the honorary presidency be
conferred upon 11. Rochefort and M.
Drumont, a groat uproar ensued, the
anarchists trying to wrench the ban
ners from the anti-Semitics. Scuffles
took place, in which two of the officials
were injured.
M. Thiebaud delivered an address de
nouncing the Jews and urging the
meeting to support the Government.
Tumults and fights for the banners
contlued. with shouting, - .whlstllnir and
Kinging of the Marsel'l^i^i Â«. 1 th- Car
magnole, while M- Thiebaud proceeded
In a violent speech declaring that the
Dreyfus scandal was the commence
ment of a social revolution by "a band
of scoundrels desiring to overthrow
everything In order to raise a traitor."
The scene now became a saturnalia.
The anarchists removed the iron stair
case giving access to the tribune, so
that the committee was unable to de
scend. Free fights began around the
flaps. Finally the students, rhased the
anarchists out of the hall. The organ
izers of the mooting then seized the
flags decorating the hall ami arranged
a rendezvous at the military club, cry
ing "Vice l'Armee."
The hall partially emptied, but soon
the anarchists returned and. breaking
open the great doors, began further
flighting. It is alleged that several were
injured. Finally the students were van
quished and the anarchists were mas
ters of the situation. The meeting
broke up and the anarchists replaced
the ladder and invaded the tribune, led
by M. Curtois. flourishing a red flag
and all shouting, "Conspu<>z Rochefort"
(spit upon Rochefort) and "Long live
Zola."
The disturbance continued, the anar
chists declaiming from the tribune
against the army and acclaiming Drey
fus. Some of the injured people were
carried out with their faces covered
with blood.
Tho interest was now transferred to
thfÂ» atreeta. where th*Â» police had been
reinforced by tho Republican guards.
At 10 o'clock this evening large bodies
of students, flourishing the tricolor and
shouting, "Vive l'Armee," proceeded in

epuez Zola" to the offices of the Temps,
the Aurore and the Libre Parole, but
the police again dispersed them. Near
midnight 500 students, led by M. Mille
voye, assembled at the Military Club,
but they met with the same fate. In
the melee some were wounded and
others arrested. Ultimately M. Mille
voye obtained permission of the police
to march before the club crying, "Vive
l'Armee."
By midnight those who had been ar
rested were released and quiet had
been restored In the Palace de l'Opera.
There were only trifling manifestations
elsewhere.
M. Blanc, the Prefect of Police, has
personally taken the direction of the
men who- were protecting the Military
Club, through fear of further trouble.
Telegrams from various provincial
towns r.port student manifestations at
Marseilles, where the windows of Jew
ish citizens WCIC broken.
At Nantes there have been some at
tacks on shops and the synagogue.
The crowd rescued those who were ar
rested.
The events of the past few days are
beginning to produce a feeling of panic
in Jewish circles. Both tht> business
and private houses of the Rothschilds
and other wealthy Jews are guarded by
special detectives and gendarmes, for
fear the crufade produce a sudden pop
ular outbreak.
A heavy fog settled over the city this
afternoon and made it difficult to as
certain until late exactly what had
happened. It ceems that, fearing dis
orders, a large body of police moved in
the direction of the Pantheon about 4
o'clock and barred the bridges across
the Seine. Half an hour later the stu-

filled the Place de Pantheon. An agi
tated crowd shouting, "Conspuez Zo
la," and raisins other cries, moved in
the direction of the bridges. Several
attempts to cross the river were frus
trated, but eventually a large number
reached the Place de la Republique. In
one case the crowd stopped in front of
a shop that bore the name "Levi,"
shouting:, "Death to the Jews. Let us
pillage, let us pillage." The students
at the rear, ignorant of the cause of
the delay, pushed on, and the mass
continued its onward course, after at
tempts in various directions to reach
the principal boulevards, always frus
trated by the police. Many were ar
rested. The students were now joined
by the riff-raff of the city, but llnally
desisted until evening.
The students, having the sympathy of
the authorities, were treated with sig
nal forbearance by the police, who only
kept them within necessary bounds.
According to some accourts. twenty
people were wounded in the cavalry
chars* outside the Tivoli Hall, which
the police eventually clear*!. The fin
prisoned committee in the tribune was
unable to make Itself heard and hung
out a placard announcing that the pro
ceedings were closed.
There is no doubt that the policy of
the Government is beginning to be
strongly assailed. General Billot. Min

There were several embarrassing cir
cumstances connected with the arrival
of President Sanford B. Dole of Hawaii
yesterday morning, but they did not
seem to ruffle his usual good temper or
Inconvenience him in any manner, ex
cept that he did not know Just how to
act. The President's wife accompanies
him.
Heretofore the arrival of potentates
from the distant islands o-f the sea has
been the occasion of burning a great
deal of Government powder by firing a
salute. In the case of the President of
Hawaii there was nothing whatever to
indicate that a person of rank had ar
rived.
The few people who got aboard the
Peru told Mr. Dole Market street was
decorated; that General Shatter had
been instructed to meet him with an
escort, and that his reception was to
be a brilliant one. Accordingly, news
was sent to the Mail dock that the
President of Hawaii was going to leave
the steamer in a tug and land at the
Clay-street float, whence he was
to drive uptown under the waving flags
that had been strung across Market
street in his honor.
A long hour was the Peru detained
in the stream awaiting the salute that
never came from the guns on Black
Point: then when the news reached the
steamer that the flags were flying in
honor of the Golden Jubilee the anchor
of the Peru was raised, and a start was
made for the Mail dock.
When the steamer got alongside the
wharf Lieutenant Noble, aid-de-camp
to General Shafter, went aboard and
proffered his services, and that was the
nearest approach to a military escort
the President of Hawaii got. The only
carriage to met him was one sent down
by the proprietor of the Occidental Ho
tel, and into it Mr. Dole got hurriedly
and was driven away. Once at the ho
tel the President was as accessible aa
the humblest citizen. Though weary
from the Journey and crowded with
work which he had laid out for the day.
he granted representatives of the press
an interview. To every question he
gave a clear and courteous answer,
saying that there was nothing to hide,
and that there was no secret mean
ing to his visit.
"It was the sense of the officers of the
Government." said the Chief Executive
of Hawaii, "that I make a visit to the
Chief Executive of this country for the
purpose of discussing with him va
rious phases of the proposed treaty
with Hawaii. I do not come here as a
special pleader for annexation, nor
shall I appear before any Congressional
committees. It would not be a very
proper thing for me to do. The pro-
I posed treaty has been ratified by my
; Government. If it is finally ratified by
the United States Senate in the pres-
e nt shape, or with immaterial amend
ments, there are a great many little
questions that will have to be settled.
Something will have to be arranged as
regards the form of government that
will be maintained during the period
between the ratification of the treaty
by this Government and the period
'â  when Hawaii will finally be turned over
jto the United States. For example, all
suits would have to run in the name
iof the United States. It would have to
be arranged in detail what would be
I the status of the Hawaiian Islands2
during the transition period. I desire
to be In "WnEhhisrtori long enough to be
of some service to the Executive of this
country and to the Hawaiian Lega
tion. 11
The President disclaims any desire
to appear before any committee In an
offensive way, and he thinks it would
not be wise to appear before any legis
lative body at all. Speaking of the eti
quette of the situation, he said:
"I do not suppose I am really wanted
In Washington, but this question of an
nexation is d<^e to my heart, and it is
my desire t<> servo my country In any
way that I can. I shall not become a
pleader for the cause, but I want to be
here ready to expedite matters all T
can if the treaty becomes the policy of
this country."
The President is not hoastful repard
ine: the probabilities of the case. n"r
does h<> make such extravagant claims
as some of the more bitter annexatlon
ists. Tn response to a question as to
the sentiment of the natives on the
BUbject, he said:
"Tt won !<l be a very difficult matter
to Bay what proportion of the natives
are opposed to annexation. I think the
more advanced and intelligent favor
the treaty with the United States. Of
course there are a great many who op
pose it, and who are bitter in their
sentiment?. T believe it may be said
that most of the white people of the isl
ands are in favor of the treaty, as it
now is. or of something of substan
tially the same character. It is gener
ally understood that there would be
some such government, for a time at
least, as that which is now common in
the case of Territories of the United
- before they are admitted to full
statehood."
President Dole denies that he comes
to this country clothed with any un
usual powers relative to assenting to
amendments of the treaty. He says
he might advise the Government of
this country almut what would be ac
coptible to his own people, but his
opinions would in no manner be bind
ing.
"I hope to be In San Francisco three
or four days." he said, "but the pro
gramme has not yet been definitely ar
ranged. I hope to visit President Mc-
Kinley while in Washington, though no
official correspondence has passed be
tween us on the subject."
President Dole spent the day quietly
at thÂ» hotel. He was called on during
the afternoon by General Shafter and
his staff.
President Dole and party occupied a
box at the Baldwin this evening and
witnessed the performance of "The
Man From Mexico." His box was
rated with the Hawaiian and
American flags and he was the cyno
sure of all eyes. In the third act the
portieres were Hawaiian flags and the
ladies in the cast wore the colors of
th<- Paradise of the Pacific.
Mayor Phelan has extended an invi
tation to President Dole to take break
fast with him to-morrow morning at
the Pacific Union Club. Governor Budd
has been invited to be one of the
guests.
DOLE LOTH TO TALK
UPON HIS MISSION
TO THIS COUNTRY.
Says at Honolulu He Is Going to Washing
ton to See President McKinley, but De
nies That He Has Been Invited.
HONOLULU, Jan. 7.â Before depart
ing from Honolulu President Dole
courteously broke through an accepted
understanding controlling high digni
taries and accorded to The Call cor
respondent a brief interview this after
noon.
"I do not desire," said Dole, "to talk
to the newspapers here or in the States
about my mission. I am going to
morrow most certainly, and when once
I have arrived in California I shall de
cline most positively to talk to the
gentlemen of the press. Good-by. I
shall not be away long."
This was said in that pleasantly
paternal style of "God bless you. my
dear boy, be good and you'll be
happy." for Mr. Dole's gray 'hair and
full whiskers give him a grandfatherly
appearance scarcely coinciding with a
leisurely life of only fifty-three years.
"Don't you think. Mr. President, that
it would be advisable and pleasant for
you to let The Call publish the fact
and motive of your mission. It might,
you know, aid in relieving you from
embarrassment and annoyance on your
Journey, for of course when our irre
pressible friends abroad learn that you
are not to be interviewed they will
leave you severely alone It is their
invariable custom in California."
"WelL" said he, "1 don't know but
that I might say M The Call that I am
going to Washington to see and talk
to President McKinley and his ad
ministration as the representative of
the Government of the republic of Ha
waii and of this community."
He laid great stress on the expres
sion "of this community," and at the
suggestion of the words "annexation
ists" or "country" repeated, "Of this
community. I go to discuss matters
connected with the annexation of this
country to the United States, and to
place before the President our views
and to show him very good reasons
whs should be promptly annexed. I
sha.l further discuss with him the con
duct of affairs and arrangements to be
made after we are annexed. That is
about all. Of course I shali do my best
to make my mission successful, as I
thoroughly believe it will be. Please
say to The Call, and it applies to all
newspapers, that I shall firmly decline
to speak to their representatives. It
would not be quite proper for me to
talk on this matter when once on my
journey. Good-by."
"There is an impression in town, Mr.
President, that you go to Washington
as a sequence of an invitation or a
suggestion from President McKinley,
members of his Cabinet or persons so
closely allied to him as to anticipate
his wishes. Is this so?"
Very forcibly, and with a slight show
of feeling. Dole promptly answered:
"Most absolutely not. Please contra
dict that impression. I have received
no communication from Mr. HcKinley
whatever, nor have I had any corre
spondence with him or any one con
nected with his administration I go
at the request of the Council of State
the Cabinet and of those who, with us!
believe that annexation is for the best
Interests of Hawaii. My Government
and those associated with us think that
it will be advantageous for me to thor
oughly discuss the subject with the
President in all its bearings, conse
quently I shall go. Please state that
this action emanated in Honolulu and
not in Washington. It is entirely our
own policy and free from any sugges
tion from the administration. I do not
expect to be away from home more
than two months, but I cannot toll how
long it may be. Mrs. Dole may accom
pany me for part of my journey. And
now good-by until to-morrow."
Be this as it may, the annexation
camp is fairly divided on the expedi
ency and policy of the President's de
parture. It is now well known that,
while his mission was sanctioned by a
tacitly unanimous vote, this was ob
tained only through a deferential sac
rifice of opinion to the personal wishes
of the President, and the necessity in
the present crisis of the conflict of pa
rading a semblance of absolute solidity
of forces. It Is admitted by them thtu
this hi the (strongest trump card that
the anr.exr.l'or.ists can play and that if
the President canr.ct win th>- trick then
their situation is forlorn Indeed.
Perhaps the general Impression is
correct that had not J. O. Carter de
j elded last month to go to Washington,
| President Dole would have remained at
home for the opening of the Legisla
ture next month. This of course is de
nied by the organ of the Annexation
Club, which claims that Mr. Carter
went because Mr. Dole is going. This
is putting the cart before the horse. It
further asserts, on a baseless founda
tion, that Mr. Carter carried with him a |
"sack" of nearly $40,090 to be "used in i
opposition to annexation and Hawaii's
best interests." It states that $10,000
came from one house, and members of
the club credit this to an English firm.
j The story Is too absurd to contradict
i authoritatively, although if money is
j wanted for legitimate expenses it will
j doubtless be found.
This being the sorrowful anniversary
; of the sad events of 18!*.". the annexa- I
; tionists' press is "rubbing it in" on the
I unfortunate misguided Hawaiian* and
I others who were victimized and misled
j by a rriysterious combination, the se- ;
j orets of which some day may be di
â  vulged, and which it is honestly be
. lieved by many are known to some of
I those who benefited by Its failure. This
â¢ is not the way to promote harmony and
j peace in a community in which, not- 1
! withstanding the essential differences
i in political opinion at this juncture of ;
i our affairs, all are desirous of being
friendly and of trusting to fate to set
everything right. Fortunate is it that
j the political press does not echo the
! sentiments of its patrons who are more ;
! sensible. This was fully exemplified Â«n j
j New Year's day, when all stores. in
cluding the numerous Japanese, were
closed, th' 1 town deserted and all went '>
| merry holiday making on the bay, at
I the cricket fields, at baseball or at Cy
| clomere Park, with luaus and dances
j innumerable.
The Irrepressible little Anti-Annex
ation Journal is keeping th.- town in
roars of laughter by its parodies and
sarcasms on the Presidential "junket
ing trip." It is so rejoiced at what it
believes to ho an error in the policy of
the Government that it is as good na
tured as it is poignant in satire.
Our next holiday is January 17, the
anniversary of the establishment of the
Provisional Government. On that day
the Acting President and Minister of
War. Mr. Cooper, is to review our mili
tary and civil armed forces. L,ot us
hope he will have better weather than
the present storm of rain ar>d wind.
ANNEXATION TREATY
CANNOT BE RATIFED
BY THE SENATE.
And the Chances Are That All Bills and
Joint Resolutions for Taking Hawaii
Will Be Snowed Under
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 17.
It is quite apparent now that even
Chairman Davis of the Foreign Rela
tions committee realizes the Hawaiian
annexation treaty will fail to be rati
fied by the Senate. The probabilities
are that he will soon abandon the ef
fort, and that a bill for annexation, or
Senati r Morgan's joint resolution, wiil
be taken up. The anti-annexationists
are confident that the Joint resolution
will not pass the House, although it
would only require a majority vote in
stead of two-thirds. It is believed that
Speaker Reed will oppose the adminis
tration both as to the annexation of
Hawaii and the Cuban policy.
Congressman Amos Cummings of
New York said in an interview to-day:
"The legislation decks are clear, and
each ho-use of Congrcsr. is settling down
to its work. The big committees have
divided themselves into sub-commit
tees, and the process of grinding out
bills for the consideration of the House
is already in operation. On January 3
548S bills and 107 joint resolutions had
been referred to the House committees
and 2918 bills and 77 joint resolutions
to Senate committees. The calendars
are hoppers into which the grist of
these committees is thrown. The House
has already sent two of the givat ap
propriation bills over to the Senate.
They carry $161. ,000; eleven others
fo-llow. . These appropriation bills are
the essential of legislation. Without
them the Government is blocked. When
the difference* concerning them have
been settled by conference committees
and they have passed both hnust-s and
received the signature of the Prt-sident,
Congress will be ready to adjourn. It
is evidently the int'-ntion of leaders in
the House to scale the general appro
priation bills as closely as possible and
to force an adjournment at an early
date. Under the rules other bills car
rying appropriations can be buried
without allowing them to come before
the House. An appropriation bill is a
privileged measure, and it is frequent
ly used to shunt offensive legislation
from the track. It has the right of
way at all times, except when con
fronted by a contested election case or
by a special order from the Committee
on Rules. An appropriation bill can
switch a contested election case from
the track at any time by a vote of the
House, but it requires unanimous con
sent to set aside a special order after
it has once been sanctioned by the
House.
"Bearing this in mind, the question of
annexation of Hawaii becomes inter
esting. If the Senate fails to ratify the
treaty by a two-thirds rote, a bill pro
viding for its annexation will undoubt
edly pass that body. If the leader:- of
the House are opposed to such a bill
they can easily prevent its considera
tion by the House. It may be buried to
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and
If reported from that committee there
is no way in which the House can con
sider it except by a special order from
the Committee on Rules. In other
words, if Speaker Reed favors the bill
it will pass the House; if he is op;
to it the House will have no opportuni
ty to vote on it. This aptly Illustrates
the eccentricities of a purely represent
ative government. The Cuban ques
tion is in a similar situation. The House
is held up by an application of its own
rules. If three-quarters of the mem
bers favor the recognition of Cuba
would have no opportunity to vote for
it. The Senate resolution is still buried
in the House Committee on Foreign Af
fairs. If this committee should report
it favorably to the House, it is in the
condition of Lord Lovell's wife, who
jumped into a box that closed with a
spring. It could not come up for con
sideration without the usual special or
der. Once on the calendar, it might
be called upon suspension day, provid
ed the Speaker would consent to recog
nize a member of the committee for
this purpose. Then a two-thirds vote
would pass It."
Replying to a resolution of inquiry.
Secretary Wilson sent to-day to the
Senate a statement concerning the pro
duction of sugar in this country, and
his opinion of the effect of the importa
tion of Hawaiian sugar on the produc
tion of beet sugar in the United States.
He gave the average importation of
sugar to this country for the past -
years as $101,575,293 worth, of which the
Hawaiian importation was $9 973 9*>4
Hf concludes that Hawaii will not se'r
iousiy compete with sugar producers
in the United States, and says that
"when the people of those Islands come
to consider the possibilities of coffee
production it will be found that they
wl''. have a monopoly with which no
State in the Union can interfere."
Mr. Wilson also expresses the opinion
that Hawaii would be a very profitable
acquisition, because of its fruits

RESISTING
REDUCTION
OF WAGES
Employes of Cotton
Mills Out on a
Strike.
Refuse to Accept the Cut
of Ten Per Cent by
Employers.
Prospect of the Battle Spread
ing Throughout New
England.
MANY PEOPLE AFFECTED
Hundreds of Canadians Who Flock to
This Country Mny Have to He
turn to Their Homes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 17.â The fight between
employers and employes in the New-
England cotton mills is on, and \vhut
it will lead up to cannot be foretold.
The great corporation* in New Bcdf >rd
are silent and thousands of operjtlves
are idle,, while here and there discon
tent has cropped nut all day. the most
serious being at Biddeford. Me., where
3200 persons refused to work, thus clos
ing two mills, and at Lewiston.
where one mill was crippled by 4"<>
weavers staying out. The general wage
reduction is estimated to affect L 2
ins and about 150 mills.
To-night finds the textile operatives
everywhere intently interested in the
New Bedford Struggle, for then
real strength and the endurance will
come, and upon the outcome will de
pend the question of an industrial bat
tle the entire length and breadth <-i
the Now England States. The chief
point in this battle will be discipline.
From the point of view <.f the mill own
er, the New Bedford situation is now a
lockout. Intervention by the State
Board of Arbitration this week is hard
ly to be allowed, and no overt act on
the part of the strikers and no attempt
to open a mill is expected for a num
ber of days.
The New Bedford strikers will receive
strike money from operatives else
where, but the sum total will be re
served until a protracted battle brings
<>n want and hardship, which the
unions wii! then try t<> relieve.
All the New Bedford mills opened at
the usual time. When no help came
in, lights went out, speed stopped, over
nd hands ; i tpared to
make everything snug and mill i
were closed indefinitely. The labor
unions did little work to-day, except to
carry out plans of campaign, which
will be developed only us faint he
weavers seek to retarn to work.
Of the other strikers little had been
developed in them as yet t<> {>â :â 
the future. The Laconia and Pepper
ell mill works in Riddefor-1 struck be
cause they were anxious to, while the
â yes in the AmJroseoggin mill.
Lewiston, simply tÂ«..Â»k mutters into
their own hands, regardless of other de
partments. These two strikes, while
on identical issues, will serve only as
minor fights along the line unless ir-e
strike fever grows and tney become the
nucleus of a general fight in Maine
cities. One other minor right now â¢â ".
is at Hurlington, Vt., where .he Queen
City mills shut down Indefinitely be
cause the operatives refused point
blank to accept the reduction,
trouble, however, began a number of
days ago, but reached the acute stage
to-day.
Taking the day's events throughout
New England, it may eonservatlv?ly
be said that things came to pass just
as expected. It Is the Immediate' fu
ture which awakens apprehensions.
OnÂ» feature of the labor troubles
which may manifest itself is the re
turn to th<Mr <'anadian homes by hun
dreds of families who speak French,
who flock to the States in winter to se
cure employment. Following is an
estimate of the number of operatives
affected by the cut down, b;u the ac
tual result win scarcely be t-eÂ«n until
the new schedule of wages is tried:
Knight. Qoddarda <fc Chase mills in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Con
necticut. 20,000;. Lowell mills. 15,000;
Lewiston, EOOOj Fall River, 4000; Bidde

MOO.
NEW BEDFORD, Mass., Jan. 17.â A
shut-down, the most complete in the
history of the cotton mills of New Bed
ford, began this morning. Not â  spin
dle was turning nor a loom in motion
in the factories of the cloth corpora
tions an hour after the usual time of
beginning work. Betwen forty and
fifty operatives went inter Bristol mill
and twenty-five or thirty into the
Whitman, but. aside from these, no
mill made any show of running, and
these two soon shut down. Nine cor
porations, operating eighteen mills, in
which upward of f>ooo hands are era
ployed, are involved in the strike. The
cut is uniform all over the cityâ lo per
cent. The tctal payroll of those cor
porations is estimated at $70,000 weekly.

WOOXSOOKET. R. 1.. Jan. 17.â The
2300 people employed In thÂ» Social
Globe and Nourse Mills of the Social
Manufacturing Company and the <"lin

reductions of wages averaging, it is
stated, about 10 per cent. Fears are
felt that trouble may yet arise. â¢
P.IDDEFORD, Me.. Jan. 17.â Every
department of the Pepperill and I,a~
conia Mills in this city, and all the de
partments of the York Mills in Saco,
with the exception of the carding and
mule spinning rooms, shut down to
day as a result of the decision of the
operatives to resist a 10 per cent re
duction in wages which was to go into
effect on this date. At the York Mills
in Saco the weavers remained out and
were followed by the ring spinners
The cut at these mills is said to aver
age 12 per cent. There are 1500 opera
tives and 51.204 spindles. The man
agers o fthe mills refuse to say what
their policy will be.
LEWISTON, Me., Jan. 17.â The oper
atives of all the mills here except those
of the Androscoggin went to work as
usual to-day under a reduction in
wapps of from 10 to 11 1-9 per cent
At the Androscoggin only seven out of
400 weavers went to work. The re
duction went into effect at the mills
of the Continent and Androscoggin
Hill. Barber and Bates corporations'
and at the Lewiston Bleachery and

PRAGUE, Bohemia, Jan. 17.â Stormy
scenes were witnessed at the session of

measures dividing the country into dis

when nationalities were equally divided,

conduct of official business. Therefore, he
declared, all officials should be able to

PREMIER MELINE
THREATENED THAT THE
CABINET WOULD RESIGN.
So the French Chamber of Deputies Did
Not Force the Publication of Drey
fus' Alleged Confession.
PARTS, J;in. IT.â A semi-official note,
relative to the demand that the alleg
ed confession of Alfred Dreyfus to If.
Lebrun-lter.aud should be published,
says: "If the Government conceded
the demand it would bring under dis
cussion and appear to place in doubt
the authority of the Dreyfus decisio-n.
Moreover, the Government does not
consider that it has the right to make
such a communication for reasons ana
logous to those which determined thÂ»
court-martial to try Dreyfus behind
closed doors."
There was great excitement in the
Chamber of Deputies to-day when M.
Cavaignac, U< publican, demanded a
discussion of the semi-official note is
sued to-day, in which the Government
declined to make, public the alleged
confession of Alfred Dreyfus to M. Le
brun-Renaud. The Premier. M. Meline,
in refusing to discuss the matter, de
clared that if the Chamber voted its
immediate discussion the Cabinet
would resign.
The lobbies of the Chamber of Depu
ties were crowded, and there were heat
ed discussions, .-vt-n among the usually
cool-headed politicians.
The session opened with a speech
from M. Jourde. Republican, on a mi
nor question respecting prisons, but in
view of the impatience of the mem
bers h<- abandoned his speech on the
prisons questions, which was adjourn
ed until to-morrow.
The Minister for War. General Bil
lot; the Premier, if. Meline, and If,
Cavalgnac here entered the house and
the President of the Chamber, M. Rrls
son. announced that he had received a
request from If. ("avaignac to question
the Government regarding its Dreyfus
note. If. Meline asked him to adjoairn
the matter, requesting the Chamber to
reassure the country by continuing its
legislative labors.
Re said the budget mast be voted,
and the Dreyfus affair, which had be
come a party question, should be set
aside.
Continuing, the Premier said: "The
Government's policy has already had
excellent results at horrid and abroad,
and we appeal to the v. Isdom of the
Chamber to put an end to the exces
sive agitation."
The Premier concluded with a refer
ence to the honor of the army and the
respect due to the judges, and asked
for a vote of confidence in the Gov
ernment.
iM. Cavaignac refused to be satisfied
â¢with this harangue. He declared the
terms of the semi-official note were rot
acceptable (cries from the Leftists),
protested against the silence of the
Minister for War at the time the army
was attacked, and urged the publica
tion of the alleged confession of Drey
fus.
When the vote was taken the House,
by 310 ayes to 257 noes, decided to
shelve the discussion.

ITS PRESTIGE
HAS DEPARTED
Plight of the Los Angeles
League for Better
Government.
Citizens Now Realize That It Is
Dominated by Political
Tricksters.
Flat Failure of Its Attempt to Smirch
tha Character of Director
Webb.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
J.OR ANGELEP, Jan. 17.â Within the
past week there has been a remarkable
change in public feeling, so far as Wal
ter L. Webb is concerned. The fair and
unprejudiced accounts of the School
Hoard investigation published in The
Call have been a revelation to the peo
ple. There were a few who did not be
lieve Webb to be as black as he was
painted by the Wil'.ard-Gibbon-Otis
newspaper syndicate, comprising the
Express, the Herald and the Times, un
til The Call entered the field and gave
th" facts as they were, and not as cer
tain interested corporations and indi
viduals wanted them to be.
All tho testimony in the investigation
before the School Board is now vir
tually in, and people are wondering
what has become of all the sensational
â¢pments that have been promised
by the various attorneys for the de
fense, particularly by T. K. Gibbon and
W. A. Cheney. All the rules of evi
dence were ignored, and everything
was dragged into the light that could
possibly reflect upon the legal or moral
guili of the accused. The result of this
drag-net method of procedure was to
bring out nothing against Webb, ex
â  â¢ pi the statement of two self-confess
ed perjurers and bribe-takers.
Penpio -who have given a retrospect
ive view to the situation are now ask
ing why Webb alone was singled out
for persistent prosecution, and why ev
erybody else, from Janitor CVmper, who
confessed to paying a bribe, to Banker
Rraley, who confessed to having com
mitted an act that is felonious, was ig
nored or deliberately defended by the
League for Better City Government
and the syndicated misconception of
journalismâ the Tirm-s- Hera HI -Express.
The opinion Is freely expressed that the
league and its newspaper confederates
were not engaged in an investigation
of corruption, but in a man-hunt.
And then comes the question: "Why
was the scalp of Webb wanted? This
hns been answered by Webb in his
signed statement published in Th^ Call
of January 4. In this he Stated that he
was being pursued by the league as a
matter of revenge for having been
partly instrumental in bringing about
the removal of Miss Mac Owrn from
the list of public s;-hc-ol teachers, and
for having defeated the efforts of the
league to secure control of the city
Board of Education. This assertion of
Mr. Webb has since been apparently
borne out by the facts that have de
v!Â«>ped.
That the men who control the League
fi-r Better City Government are cap
able tÂ»f entering upon a conspiracy,
such as this appears to be, is demon
strated by what they have already
done in connection with the affairs of
the league. The latest election of di
rectors of the league took place on
June IS, 18*7. At ti:;it election three
men Ineligible to the office were elect
ed as directors. One of the bylaws in
force at this time provides as follows:
The corporate powers, business and
property of the corporation shall be exor
cised, conducted and controlled by a
board of directors, all of whom must be
members In good standing.
Amone the twenty-three members of
the board of directors declared elected
were Harry ("handler. Octavius Mor
gan and If. Wish, none of whom had
paid the semi-annual dues payable on
or before the day of election. In .the
notices of the election sent out to mem
bers, the following sentence was con
spicuously displayed in heavy, black
faced type: "The semi-annual dues of
<<ne dollar are due and payable before
June 15, 1597.* 1 On the ballots mailed
to I'.ich member attention was called
to the same duty in the following line:
"Semi-annual dues of $1 must be. paid
before voting."
The fact that Chandler. Morgan and
Welsh were not qualified at the time
they, were elected was called to the at
tention of C. S. Walton, the secretary
of the league, and he promised to call
the attention of the directors to the af
fair. Nothing has been heard of it
from that day to this, and the three
men illegally elected have been allowed
to â â¢xereise their functions as officers
without question by the proper author
ities. It is claimed that the men who
were frozen out by this fraud were not
acceptable to the men of the inner cir
cle. Chandler is a son-in-law of H. G.
Otis, the editor of the Times, and is the
superintendent of circulation of that
nevspaper. Chandler is now the sec
ond vice-president of the league, and
Morcrnn was the second vice-president
of that organization previous to the
last election. Neither of them, appar
ently, could be spared from the board
of directors.
That the league has been under sus
picion by the perspicacious ever since
It was launched upon the political
ocean is shown by its own confessions,
made in its official printed bulletins.
There is a peculiar vein of apology and
explanation running through thesa cir
culars that savors strongly of hypocri
sy and deception to one who can read
between the lines. In the bulletin is
sued as far back as June 29, 1596. occurs
the following significant remarks:
Since the Better Government circulars
came out the street has been full of
strange and often ludicrous rumors con
.cerning the movement. These may be ex
pected right along, and need not worry
anybody. Some of these are so enter
taining as to be worth repeating:
It is said Â«^nt the presence of four or
five stockhe'ders of the water company
on the original list shows very plainly
that it Is a scheme in favor of" that cor
poration.
For similar reasons it Is said to be a
Los Angeles lighting scheme and street
car company scheme.
It is said to be a Democratic .scheme to
elect a certain man Mayor. . ... â¢
That these rumors have not been ex
ploited in the local newspapers is
simply due to the fact that the owners
of these journals are part and parcel
of the gigantic scheme to turn over the
control of the city government to the
corporations. In the bulletin of July
13 occurs the following:
If this movement does not wholly suc
eced this year it may do so the following
or the year succeeding that. At all events
the agitation must continue until it is a
success, whether that be in one year or
in ten. *

ONLY HARNESS
HORSES WANTED
Rich Men of Chicago to
Own a New Race
track.
Thoroughbreds Will Be Kept
Out and There Will Be
No Betting.
Intended Simply for Â« Gentlemen's
Driving Park and Matinea
Covirse.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 17.â Chicago is to
have another race track, and at once.
The new track will be unique. On it
runners will have no place whatever,
for it will be devoted exclusively to the
pacer and trotter.
Lovers of harness racing are disgust
ed with the results of the efforts In the
past two years to keep sport alive in
this city. They point to the la^t two
meetings of the Northwestern Breed
erg' Association at the Washington
Park track, during which large purses
were hung up, and for which the fastest
horsos in the wurld contended. At these
meeting's the strict letter of the law
v.as observed, and there was no pool
soiling or bookmaking, with the result
that the association quit many thou
sand dollars loser and was forced out
of existence. Experience taught a les
3on which will never be forguttcn.
There are in the neighborhood of 100
men high in social and business stand
ing in Chicago who are loven of fast
horses, and who have their money in
vested in them. The schema is to buy
property, either in the city or near it,
build tracks, stables and grand stand,
and to have matinees much on the or
der <>f those held in Cleveland and New
Turk. There will be nr> pool setting or
bookmaking allowed. It will simply be
a g'entlemen's driving park, where own
ers and their friends may go and drive
their own horses and enjoy the sport
which at present is denied them.

RUMORED DISASTER TO
THE CITY OF SEATTLE
Big Steamer on the Way to Alaska With
Over Five Hundred Passengers Reported
to Ha ye Gone Ashore.
SEATTLE. Jan. 17.â 1t Is rumored here
to-night that the steamer City of Seattle
has gone ashore at some point on the
route to Alaska. It is impossible to con
firm the report or discover Its origin. The
City of Seattle sailed from here last
Wednesday for Skaguay and Dyea with I
550 passengers and 600 tons of freight.
Captain Pierce of the steamer Corona,
just in from Dyea. says that he saw the
Seattle two days ago, when she was i
bound north and all was well. The of- |
fici.ils of the company operating th~e City
of Seattle are at a loss to know how the !
rumor pained circulation. They made a
thorough investigation to-night and state
positively that there is no reason for be
lieving that the steamer is not now well
on her way to Dyea.

Sun from Washington says: Frank A.
Leach, Superintendent of the United
StateÃ Mint in San Francisco, had a con- !
ference with Secretary Gage to-day on

YOUR NERVES
Are All Over Your Body.
When you have a nervous twitching of the
mouth and of the nasal passages, it is these
nerves which you see here represented that are
disordered. These nerves originate in the
brain, and are distributed to the tongue, nose
and lips. Sometimes they are the very nerves
that tell a tale of decay. Those are the nerves
that begin to twitch before the other nerves
show any sign of loss of power. Sooner or
later, however, those who exhaust the vital
forces of life by overwork, over-exertion or
abuse will discover the inroads created by
these exhausting debilitated losses, and will
note the nerves of the face, of the mouth ami
of the eye to twitch. When you beg-in to note
these disorders it is time to use the Brand

IN A SANTA

Bowlders Crash. Down
Upon a Force of
Workmen.

by Fire, Give
Away.
Roadmaster Lyons Killed and
Foreman Matthews Is
Dying.
OTHERS BADLY INJURED.
Had Baen Engaged In Fighting a Blaze
That Raged for Twenty-
Four Hours.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
WILLIAMS, Ariz.. Jan. 17.â One of
the most dreadful accidents in the his
tory of the Santa Fe took place to-day
at the Fairview Tunnel, about nine
miles west o-f here. Sparks from the
engine of yesterday's passenger train
No. 1 ignited the timbers in the roof of
the tunnel. A gang of men was quick
ly dispatched from this city under
Foremen Matthews and Parker. The
men fought the llames all night with
out flinching and all day to-day.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon, when the
flames were all but out, the men were
alarmed by a loud crash, and in a mo
ment a solid mass of rock and burn-
Ing timbers came falling down. Every
one ran for his life. Roadmaster Ly
ons and Foreman Matthews cot ap
pearing, the workmen went back into
the tunnel to look for them. Roadmas
ter Lyons was found in the debris, and
was quickly ta.ken out. It was seen
that he was quite dangerously hurt.
After considerable difficulty Foreman
Matthews was found under a heap of
rock and charred timbers. Unawares,
the men had walked over him several
times. He was finally extricated. He
was seriously hurt about the head and
limbs, and complained of a pain in his
Several other men were hurt, but not
as badly as were Lyons and Matthews.
â  mtendent Hibbard and Parker,
who were standing within two feet of
Lyons and Matthews, barely escaped
with th^ir lives, the former being
a huge bowlder in his dash
for life. That there are not more killed
is miraculous, as there were about
fifty men inside the tunnel at the time.
ons, Matthews and some laborers
were taken to William* on Superin
tendent Hlbbard's train. Lyons lived
short time after being taken out
oi" th<- tunnel. He is a widower and
leaves two children in Los Angeles. He
had been in the employ of the com
pany for ten years and had but recent
ly been transferred to the Arizona-
New Mexico line.
tthews is resting as easy as could
be expected. It Is very doubtful if he
will live until morning. He was gen
eral foreman of the building depart
ment, and ha.s heÂ»n a faithful employe
of the company for many years.
No through trains will be able to
pass through the tunnel for several
days, for at this time it is a sheet of
flame from one end to the other. Pas
sengers on to-day's train had to be
transferred around the mountain
through the snow.
WANTS ANOTHER
EASTERN OUTLET
San Diego Lets a Franchise for
a Railway Through the
City.
Awarded to a Commutes of tha Coun
cil to BÂ« Used In Furthering
Its Object.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN" DIEGO. Jan. 17.â The Common
Council to-night awarded an important
railway franchise. It is for a right of
way- 100 feet wide through the city limits.
The franchise is awarded to the follow
ing gentlemen: Matthew Sherman. U. S.
Grant. SI. A. Luce, William N. King
and C. L. Josselyn, all prominent citi
zens, who were appointed by the Cham
ber of Commerce as a committee to take
such measures as in their judgment
seemed best for securing a railroad di
rectly eastward from this city to the
Colorado River.
Members of the Chamber qf Commerce
Committee when questioned regarding
their purpose in obtaining this franchise
would only say that their object" was to
procure for San Diego at the earliest
possible day a shorter and more direct
eastern outlet, and that they considered
the franchise the important preliminary
to that end.
Under the terms of the franchise the
grantees are obliged to locate the pro
posed road within one year and to have
it in full operation within two years.
SENDS A CHARGE OF SHOT
THROUGH HIS OWN HEART.
Suicide of the 22 -Year-Old Son of Rancher
Collins of the Alexander
Valley.
HEAL.DSBUR&, Jan. 17.â The residents
of Healdshur^r were shocked to-day
â when the Intelligence reached them that
J. P. Collins, son of Mr. and Mrs. J.
Barney Collins, prominent farmers of
Alexander Valley, had committed suicide.
The r ;ir * !1 ts of the unfortunate young
man had left home and on their return
found the body of their son lying in
front of the house.
The young man had shot himself
through the heart. Filling a sack with
ri-i'ks. he had tied a rope around the
pack and attached the other end of the
rop< to the trigger of the gun. He then
lay down, placed the muzzle of the wea
pon to bis heart, pushed his foot against
the sack of rocks, which discharged the
gun.
The young man was aged about 22
years. Melancholia, with which he had
been afflicted for about two years, was
the cause of ins unfortunate ending.
Two Consuls Confirmed.

INSURGENTS
HATE WON
A VICTORY
The News Held Back
by the Spanish
Authorities.
Explosion of a Bomb Is a
Cause of Great Excite
ment in Havana.
The Particulars of This Matter
Also Are Suppressed by
the Censor.
PANDO AT SANTA CRUZ.
Ordered Back to Hie Post Under More
Than a Suspicion of Cow
ardice.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 17. â A special ca
ble to the Run from Havana says: A
d;. namite bomb was exploded to-day
near Dejame, Havana, at the moment
when a Spanish military train was
passing with soldiers. The explosion
shattered the cars, disabled the lc-como
tive, destroyed the rails and killed and
wounded many Spanish soldiers. The
press censor has refused to allow any
reference by direct cable to the num
ber of killed and wounded.
At this time of general excitement in
Havana the startling news of the ter
rible defeat by the insurgents of Gen
eral Molina is causing a great sensa
tion- Molina, with his 1500 men, met
the insurgents at Camarioca and Punta
Maya, Matanzas Province. The Cu
bans were led by Jose Clemente Go
mez. Rojas and Tabares, and num
bered SOO men.
The engagement lasted four hours,
and was a sharp one. The Spaniards
made three attempts to dislodge the
patriots from their strong positions, but
were repulsed every time with heavy
losses. In the third baycmet charge of
the Spaniards the Spanish captain,
Emilio Cervera was killed, and lieu
tenant Manuel Gonzales was severely
wounded.
Leaving fifty dead on the field, Mo
lina retired, reporting to General Blan
co that the positions of the insurgents
were bravely defended by them in or
der to gain time to remove their wound
ed, but they were finally dislodged
after two hours' lighting, and left six
dead on the field."
According to Molina, his losses, be
sides Captain Cervera and Lieutenant
<:<>nzales, were only three privates kill
ed ami twenty-eight wounded. He re
ports also several soldiers bruised.
General Pando has arrived at Santa
Cruz del Sur, in Puerto Principe Prov
ince, from Manzanillo, Santiago de Cu
ba. He made a trip by steamer in or
der to- ask for reinforcements from the
Spaniards in Puerto Principe. His sit
uation at Manzanillo is desperate. His
troops are threatening to revolt on ac
count of the ill-treatment they receive,
as they are starving and receive no
payments. Furthermore, the insur
gents under Garcia and Rabi have ex
tended their control to the very doors
of Manzanillo. As soon as General
Pando arrived In Santa Cruz, General
Blanco cabled stringent orders to him
to return Immediately to Manzanillo
and remain there attending to his duty.
It is just reported from the Palace that
Pando will return to Manzanillo to
day. Among military men here the
whole affair is making much comment.
In spite cf the decree of General
Blanco forbidding troops to destroy
property in the country and not to
harm women and children, an official
report is published to-day of a savage
attack by the battalion of Canarias on
families of insurgent soldiers at the
farm Herrera, in Pinar del Rio Prov
ince. The report says that seventeen
modern rifles and twenty-six old rifles
were captured, and that everything
was destroyed by the troops, including
some acres of vegetables and stores of
food and tobacco kept by the family.
Five women, ten children and four
men, the report says, were made pris
oners. The affair is a very good illus
tration of General Weyler's methods.
Another official report to-day says
that twenty Cuban families, numbering
ninety-two persons, mostly women and
children, have been made prisoners
near Sanrti Spiritus and brought to
town. This is another Instance of con
centration. Five thousand more regu
lar troops were brought into Havana
yesterday by Generals RalecedOj Ma
rote and Bernal, who were summoned
by General Blanco to reinforce Gen
eral Arolas against rioters.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â Consul
General Lee cabled to-day from
Havana, asking that more re
lief supplies be forwarded by
the Central Cuban Relief Committee.
This request is considered to be ample
evidence that no obstruction is being
interposed by the Spanish Government
to relief supplies being forwarded from
the I'nited State?.

BRAINED HIS WIFE
AND TWO CHILDREN
Fearful Crime of a Despondent
New York Merchant Before
Committing Suicide.
NEW YORK. Jan. 17.â John Matthews, a retail procer, some time be
tween last Saturday night and this morning, murdered his wifa and
their two children, a boy 10 years old and a girl 12, by hacking them to
death with a hatchet. Matthews then committed suicide by shooting
himself in the head. Before dying, it is believed, he turned on the gas
with the intention that asphyxiation should complete his murderous
work. The crime was committed in a small bedroom in the -ar of the
store kept by Matthew?.
The tragedy was discovered by a milkman. On the floor of the sleep
ing room the officer who was summoned found the corpse of Matthews.
In his hand was a revolver, and there was a bullet hole just above his
mouth. There were two beds in the room. On oneof these lay Matthews'
wife. Her head was chopped and mangled almost beyond recognition. On
the other bed the two children lay side by side. Their faces, too, were
frightfully cut and hacked. That the murder and suicide were premed
itated was evident. Matthews had waited until his wife and children
were asleep. Then he stripped himself to the waist, took the hatchet In
his hands and brained his wife. After that he attacked the children.
From letters left it was ascertained that for some time Matthews had
intended to end his own life. He had been in the dry goods business
farther up town and had failed. A few months ago he opened the gTo
cery store and had met with little success. His wife, a pretty little
woman, had recently undergone a severe operation. Tt was these things,
evidently, that prompted Matthews to write this letter, which was found
open and unaddressed:
"It is a terrible thing I have to do," he wrote, "to keep my word.
T promised that all shall go with me. and delay is no good. If I could
only have died alone. I love my wife and littlo children. I told them I
did not want to go In any business, that my mind was gone, and I
guess that my nerve Is all that is left. For five yean wo have talked
the thing over. I always wanted to go out in a boat and accidentally
capsize. I knew that otherwise 1 would have a hard time of it."
From a letter left by Mrs. Matthews to a friond, it was gathered
that shf* was a party t<> th>* BUldde agreement Mrs. Matthews left in
structions as to the clothe* in which the dead children should be buried,
and signified the place of interment for the entire family as Highland,
N. Y. Matthews was 35 years old.

FRESNO. Jan. 17.â John Williams,
aged 74 years, was burned to death at
4 o'clock this morning. He was a hos
tler in the employ of Dr. W. T. Mau
pin. Williams lived In a barn back of
the house at the corner of M and Cala
veras streets. He occupied a room in
the middle of the stable, and on both
sides were apartments in which wood
and household furniture were stored.
The blaze was discovered by Night
watchman W. M. Rodgers, and he turn
ed in an alarm. By the time the en
gines reached the scene the fire had
gained great headway. When it was
extinguished the body of the man was
found in th* ruins. It presented a
ghastly sight. The charred corpse lay
in what was left o-f Williams' bed.
The legs and arms were burned off
completely â in fact, nothing but the
trunk remained, and that was pro
tected by heavy blankets.
Williams had evidently attempted to
arise from his couch, but was probably
overcome by the smoke and fell back
on the bed.
The origin of the fire is not known
definitely. Williams had been drinking
heavily Sunday night, and at 12:30
o'clock was taken home in a hack. The
fire resulted either from sparks falling
from his pipe, as he was an inveterate
fmoker, or from a lamp explosion. It
is thought Williams left his lamp burn
ing, and that it exploded after he had
retired.
Williams was a native of England
and an old California settler, having
come to this State in 1*49. He engaged
in teaming and mining, and was at one
time quite well-to-do. He came to
Fresno six years ago. and of late had
lived on the bounty of Dr. Maupin. He
was a well-known character about
town, and was not a stranger in the
Police Court, where he had been ar
raigned several times for intoxication.
He always made a plea of illness.
MRS. DORA CLAY
LOVES BRYANT
Season Why the Child Wife
Will Not Remain at
Whitehall.
! Special Dispatch tn The Pall.
VALLEY VIEW. Ky.. Jan. 17.â That
General Cassius M. Clay's child-wife Dora
: is in love with William Bryant there can
be longer a doubt. This is the true reason
for her refusal to remain at Whitehall, al
though both she and General day have
declared to the contrary. Since <"!eli
Uii hardson drove Bryant away from his
home, where Dora was staying, he found
Dora very hard to get along with. In-
I deed, so bitter had her feeling become to*
ward her brother that there was a family
! row, and Clell shot at Dura and his own
wife's mother, who was taking sides with
his sister.
Dora returned from Whitehall last night
and went to the home of her sister, Mrs.
Kny Kelley. who resides about a mile
from this plncf. She says the General did
! not want her to remain at Whitehall be
cause he is afraid that someone would kill
! them 1 "'h. This is absurd, and people of
: this pla< c have begun to realize that it Is
; young Brj "t alone who is the cause of
i the separation. This is borne out by the
fact that he and Dora have met at the
].osi office here several times and every
time they have walked away together, go
ing to the far end of the village, up the
' river. On these occasions they have been
gone several hours, and have been seen
sitting on the bank of the stream. Dora
went to the postofÃce to-day and mailed
a letter. She said she came back because
she wanted to and because It was Gen
eral Clays wish. Bryant was here wait

SAX BERNARDINO. Jan. 17.â
Judges Oster and Campbell of the Su
perior Court in delivering a charge to
the Grand Jury this morning gave the
present Grand Jury system some se
vere blows. The last Grand Jury in
this county was in session twelve days,
cost JI7OO and returned only one Indict
ment. The charge was an argument
â gafnat the Grand Jury and the system.
Extracts from it follow:
We believe the sentiment to be very
general in this Stut.- that the present
Grand Jury system has outlived its use
fulness and that its continuance is only
a neeoit m l urdea on the taxpayers of the
commonwealth. No doubt it has In the
past performed valuable functions in the
administration of the criminal law, but
this consideration appeals rather to the
antiquarian and the student of political
hiÃtory than to the property-owners
â easing relief from heavy taxation. These
same functions can now be. performed
with less expense, greater efficiency and
more In accordance with the spirit of our
institutions by the District Attorney,
aided by the examining magistrate and
the machinery of a modernized criminal
Jurisprudence, aa already established.
Secrecy and divided responsibility are
the cardinal characteristics <>t the Grand
Jury system, aa contra-distinguished
from the modern mode of Instituting
criminal proceedings, and, while there
may possibly arise times .in which the or
dlnary channels through which justice
DOWS become corrupted or powerful em
anations ot "Tiiniiiais are to be ferreted
mil, and when, therefore, this secrecy
and uivided responsibility may give the
Grand Jury system an advantage over
simpler and m<>n public mode of
instituting criminal proceedings, this pos
sibility perhaps constitutes an argument
for thÂ« retention of the lirand Jury as an
agency of the court, to be invoked by it
only when in its opinion one of the ex
traordinary conditions may
require, but it is :io argument for the
continuance ol the present law necessi
tating the calling of a Grand Jury every
i ear. On ihe. contrary, and ordinarily,
this secrecy and divided responsibility
are among the moM objectionable feat
ures of the Grand Jury system, and
make it possible for the coward to make
a covert assault on the character of an
honest and upright citizen, at the same
time depriving him of the usual means of
redress.
It may, perhaps, be urged in defense
of the present scheme that no other body
except the Grand Jury possesses the
necessary inquisitorial power over the
officers of the county to investigate their
accounts and correct abuses; but in an
swer !o such an argument it may be said
that like power, including by necessary
implication the authority to employ ex
ports, is already vested in the Board of
Supervisors, and it is expressly made
part of their duty at least once a year
to examine and audit the accounts of all
officers having the care, collection or dis
bursement of county moneys.
However, ire believe it to be an easy
matter to suggest a better mode of au
diting the county books than by experts
to be appointed by either of these bodies.
Too often it has happened In this county
that among the so-called experts em
ployed by Grand Juries were persons of
such limited experience and knowledge as
to subject their reports and recommenda
tions, when adopted and promulgated
through the Grand Jury. to contempt and
ridicule, thereby visitinp on trie i,r;irm
Jury itself odium which should have been
attached to the expert himself.

JUNBAU, Alaska, Jan. 12, via Seat
tle, Wash., Jan. 17 (by steamer Co
rona). â The Cudahy-Healy Company Is
still buying claims in the Klondike. A
party of Yukoners which has been
waiting at Dyea several days frrr a
ship to take it south has more of that
company's paper, which will be cash
ed in San Francisco or Seattle, than
any other party which has come out
of Dawson this season. There are also
500 pounds of gold dust and nuggets
among the members of the party.
The rule with Klundikers is the same
as with sagacious business men. Those
who really have large sums of money
or a big buckskin sack heavy with gold
say nothing or little about It. Those
who have little or no money or dust
are certain to be the least reticent con
cerning the large wealth they have
made inside. For this reason it has
never been possible to arrive at an ac
curate estimate of the amount of
wealth, collectively or individually, in
a returning party. The gold and
checks of the party aboard the Corona
is variously estimated, however, at
from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000.
James O'Brien, one of the party, has
been in the Yukcrn country ten years,
and has the reputation of not exagger
ating things. H.^ said:
"The Cudahy-Healy Company has
spent about $3,000,000 for claims. It
will take out from two to four times
as much as it pays for the claims. It
is a wonderful country â almost beyond
belief. I look for ether rich strikes."
Several of the party left Dawson on
December 14 and 15 last and are the
latest out. The weather was mild for
a Yukon winter, the mercury hanging
between twenty and forty degrees be
lu\v zero, and the trip out was made
in from twenty-five to thirty-two days.
In the party is one woman â Miss.
Louise Kellar of Juneau â who has had
quite a romance and returns to the
States rich. Miss Kellar was fromerly
one of the Venuses of a variety theater
in Juneau. She went to Dawson la3t
spring and is the second woman to
come over the trail in the dead of win
ter. She rode most of the way on a
sled behind i> <lop team, walking a mile
or two when she felt cold. Miss Kellar
is a slender brunette of good figure.
She ranked as one of the prettiest girls
in Dawson. She was clad from head
to foot in beautiful furs.
Rumor says a man who had a good
claim on El Dorado Creek fell an easy
captive before the charms of Miss
Kellar. He is known as "Butch" Sedg
wick. He sold his claim to the Cudahy
& Healy Company for $65,000 a few
weeks ago and laid his fortune at her
feet. They came out together and are
going to Seattle to have the knot tied
by a city minister.
Miss Kellar says the trip did her
good and improved her health. The
rosy glow on her cheeks bears out the
statement.
As to claims, development work is
being greatly retarded by the exceed
ing scarcity of kerosene and candles.
On account of darkness development
work is at a halt on many claims.
What few candles and comparatively
small quantities of kerosene remain
are held without price. They are worth
more than their weight in gold. Tal
low candles at the last quotation were
worth $2 25 each and coal oil $2 50 a
P The river trail is spotted with return
ing Klondike**, who have sold their
outfits or claims, or both, from Daw
son to Dyea. On this account the quan
tiy of provisions has increased among
those who remain, and the probability
of a shortage in food is greatly lessen
ed Every man in the party says that
starvation for Dawson is now .vholly a
scare of the past.
A number of old-timers, who have
come out during the last few weeks, as
well as men among the present party,
say that Hunker Creek prospects look
as favorable as the claims on Bonanza
and El Dorado.
Considerable complaint is made about
the mail facilities to and in Dawson.
There is no postmaster at the gold cen
ter The mail is in charge of the police
station, and when the watches shift
or squads change, a different man has
charge of a stack of several square feet
of letters. The service is very unsatis
factory. It is said to be almost impos
sible to find a letter, and that there are
doubtless letters in the pile that have
been there for months undelivered.
The principal dance halls and gam
bling resort* are again open after the
fire and are running as though noth
ing had happened. A large unfurnish
ed building on Second street was com
pleted and a large lodging-house was
remodeled, and dance halls are run
ning wide open in each. Gambling has
b*Â»en put out of sight a little bit. The
police have required the games to be
confined to compartments away from
the bar and dancing rooms. The report
is current in Dawson that when Major
Walsh reaches the town gambling and
dance halls will be closed, and the
sporting element is consequently breath
ing in gasps. But Major Walsh Is still
at the Little Salmon River and will not
reach Dawson with established relay
police stations until spring. The tons
Of mail for Dawson are still stalled on
the river in charge of the police.
Frank Plavin. the pugilst. reported
discoverer of the mother lode, is only
severe] day* behind on the trail. It is
said that Mr. Slavln is bringing out this
mother lode, with a pay streak < f vir
gin gold twelve miles long, on his sled.
The discovery of the mother lode of the
Klondike is not believed In Dawson,
the present party says. Slavln or some
one else found a large piece of quartz
bearing considerable pure gold, a con
siderable distance below the surface on
El Dorado Creek, and this was said to
have been chipped from a quarts ledge.

DANGER GREATER THAN EVER.
Season's Rush May Result in a Yukon
Famine Next Winter.
From figures complied by a local steam
shlpman, who has naturally a good In
sight Into such matters. It would appear
that the coming season In the gold-stud
ded region of the Klondike will be one of
the greatest suffering from starvation if
the rush assumes anything like the pro
portions it now promises.
In the days of "49, when the famous gold
fields of this State brought thousands
across a dreary stretch of prairie land,
we are told that the trail across the
great American desert was an easy one
to follow; it was marked by the bleach-
Ing bones of thousands who in their haste
to reach the land of almost fabulous
wealth started without a proper equip
ment, or were physically unable to reach
the coveted goal, and fell by the wayside:
grewsome reminders of the perils of the
search for wealth.
Alike and yet unlike this is the journey
to the Klondike. While the way is some
what perilous, the dangers are not over
when one reaches Dawson. The early
pioneers found in California a land with
marvelous productive resources, and the
disapiÂ»'intt-'<l gold aeeker was enabled to
turn his hand to agriculture, and the land
provided him with a subsistence if not a
competency. But how different is Alas
ka. The perils of the journey will have
been somewhat overcome by the trans
portation companies which will take care
of the argonaut on his journey, transport
his veriest necessities, and then â leave
him In a land which produces little or
nothing and handicapped by a long and
hard winter.
Placing the numbers at the lowest ex
treme, there will be, during the coming
season, 150,000 people In the Klondike re
gion for whom supplies must be found
for one year. Taking for a basis the
United States army calculations for ra
tions, it will take 10S.000 tons of provisions
to sustain life in those people for one
year. Adding to this 54,000 tons for kit,
tools, weight of packages, etc., and 20,000
tons for grain, hay, hardware, oil and
other miscellaneous supplies, there is a
grand total of 182,000 tons as the very low
est on which the 150,000 can subsist.
There are now but five river boats ply
ing on the Yukon, but that number will
perhaps be increased to twenty, with an
average capacity of not over" 600 tons
each, and these making two trips to th<;
season, which is hardly possible they will
be able to do, could only transport 24,000
tons at the very most.
There is a remote possibility that 20u
tons a day could be brought into the min
ing region via Chilkoot, Whites Pass and
other routes, but if this were attempted
the pass would soon be blockaded. If it
were possible, however, and the supply
could be kept up for seven months, only
42,(KK) tons of provisions could be calcu
lated upon. This total of 68,000 tons could
not, at the most, supply more than 55.000
people, for it must be borne in mind that
there are no stocks of supplies to draw
on. and there are added to this the addi
tional dangers of prolonged seasons and
disasters to transportation, which would
sadly cripple this meager supply. If all
the means of transportation in sight were
doubled they woirtd not be adequate for
the wants of 70.000 people.
Considering former estimates and the
rush which has already made itself ap
parent, and including the number already
in the gold belt of Alaska, 150,000 Is a very
small estimate, and it will in all proba
bility at least be doubled, if not trebled.
Of those who are going all intend staying:
at least a year, and few of these, par
ticularly those going on foot across the
Chilkoot. will be able to take anything
like a year's supplies, whilp many seem
to count on the food being dropped down
from heaven and are simply taking along
a good supply of blankets, mining tools
and camp utensils.
There will not be much difficulty In
getting the supplies up to Dyea. St. Mich
ael and other ports, as the steamship
companies are well equipped for trans
porting them so far, but further they
cannot go.

WOLCOTT ON BIMETALLISM
Lengthy Speech Dellyared by the
Colorado Statesman in the Cause
of the White Metal.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. Jan. 17.
The features of to-day's proceedings
in the Senate were the speech of Sena
tor Wolcott of Colorado, chairman of
the bimetallic commission, upon the ne
gotiations of the commission with Eu
ropean countries relative to interna
tional bimetallism, and the passage of
the Lodge bill, restricting immigration
into the United States. The proceed
ings were the most interesting and im
portant that have characterized any
single day's work in the Senate during
the present session. In anticipation of
them the galleries were crowded at an
early hour. Quite unexpectedly Sena
tor Hanna appeared at the opening of
to-day's session. Foraker, the senior
Senator from Ohio, presented Hanna's
credentials for the remainder of Sher
man's term, which will expire cm March
4, 1893, and asked that the oath of office
be administered to him. Foraktr es
corted his colleague to the desK,. where
Vice-President Hobart administered the
oath of office.
At the conclusion of the morning
business Wolcott, at 12:50, was recog
nized to begin his address. He was in
fine voice, and commanded the earnest
attention of his auditors. At the con
clusion of the speech Wolcott was in
stantly surrounded by his Republican
colleagues, desirous of tendering tv him
congratulations.
At the conclusion of "Wolcott's speech
the immigration bill was taken up and
discussed until 4 o'clock, the hour at
which by previous agreement it had
been arranged to vote finally upon the
amendments and the bill. An amend
ment offered by Spooner of Wisconsin,
providing that the ability on the part
of an immigrant either* to read or
write should be accepted as sufficient
teat of his literacy, was adapted by a
vote of 42 to 22.
Another amendment by Spooner, pro
viding that the members of the family
accompanying an immigrant rejected
under the conditions of the bill should
be returned to the country whence
they came by the steamship -om
paniep, was also adopted. Other ef
forts were made to amend the measure,
but failed. The bill was then passed
by a vote of 45 to 28.
The bill as passed provides that all
Immigrants physically capable and
over 16 years of age shall be able to
read or write the English language or
some other language; but a person not
able to read or write who is over 50
years of age and is the parent or
grandparent of qualified Immigrant
over 21 years of age, capable of sup
porting such a parent or grandparent,
may accompany the immigrant, or the
parent or grandparent may be sent for
and come to join . the family of the
child or grandchild over 21 years of
age, qualified under the law; and wife
or minor child not able to read or write
may accompany or be sent for and
come and join the husband or parent
â who is qualified.
The act does not apply to persons
coming to the United States from the
island of Cuba during the continuance
of the present disorder there who have
heretofore been inhabitants of that

regular order of business, which was the
immigration bill, and as he was sustained
by the Vlce-Presldent, Allen said that,
as he had the floor, he would speak on
that bill.
Hoar of Massachusetts announced that
he would be compelled to leave thÂ»* cham
ber, anil requested Allen to yield him a
few minutes fur some remarks upon the
bill. The request was granted, and Hoar
spoke in favor of thÂ»> bilL
Bpooner of Wisconsin, while supporting
the general character of the bill, pointed
out a feature which, he said, was indefen-
Bible, namely, that requiring an Immi
grant to both read and write portions
<>f the United States constitution. Rather
than support the provision requiring the
.immigrant to write as veil us read he
would be compelled to vote against the
bill.
At the conclusion of Spooner's remarks,
an agreement having been reached by
the Wisconsin Senator and I^odge. in
charge of the measure, that Mr. Spooner
should draft an amendment providing
that steamship companies should take
back to Europe the wife and children of
an Immigrant who faJled to meet the
requirements of the proposed law. Lodge
spoke briefly in support of the measure.
He declared' that the opposition to the bill
had been stimulated by the German
steamship companies, who would suffer
by its passage. They had aroused the
opposition to the measure, and had tx
aided materially by the Deputy Com
missioner of Immigration, who hart h : -^-
self been a citizen 01 this country for
scarcely seven years.
The amendment offered by Spooner was
then adopted by 42 to 22.
(":iffery of Louisiana offered an amend
ment increasing the age of immigrants
affected by the bill from 16 to 21 years.
The amendment was lost by 28 ayes to 36

Kyle of South Dakota offered an
amendment providing that any immigrant
convicted within a year of his landing
in this country of a felony or other vio
lation of the law shall be returned to the
country from which he came. The amend

After the Immigration bill was disposed
of the Senate devoted some time to the
Oration of bills on the calendar.
Among the measures considered was one
oalle.i np by Mr. Hansbrougb of North
Dakota, amending section 22.14 of the Re
vised Statutes so thj t registers of land
offices and receivers of public moneys for
each land district established by law shall
be liable under their bonds for all moneys
n ceived by them for the saie of Indian
lands. The bill was passed.
A bill authorizing the Mus^ogee Coal
and Railroad Company to construct and
operate a railway through the Indian Ter
ritory and Oklahoma Territory and for
other purposes was passed, on motion of
Baker.
eerier, chairman of the Census Com
mfttee, gave notice that after the dispo
sition to-morrow of the urgent deficiency
bill he should insist upon the considera
tion of the unfinished business, which is
the measure providing for the appoint
ment of a director and thirty-one other
employes of the twelfth and subsequent
censuses.
Allison, chairman of the Appropriation
Committee, in this connection desired it
to be understood that the appropriation
hills which, under the Senate procedure,
have the right of way over other legisla
tion, would be pressed by his committee
and that the pension appropriation bill,
now on the calendar, would be called up
probably on Wednesday.
In response to an inquiry from White of
California, Carter said he had no desire
li avor t" displace the consideration
of the Hawaiian annexation in executive
session, but he thought the census meas
ure ought to be passed promptly. Fills
were passed providing for an American
register for the steamer Navahoe, and to
amend section 4440 of the Revised Stat
utes, authorizing the licensing of mates
on river and o^ean steamers.
The Joint resolution providing for par
ticipation by the United States In the
fisheries exposition to be held this year in
Bergen. Norway, which had been passed
by the House, was passed.
The Senate then, at 4:45 p. m.. on motion
of Quay, went, into executive session, and
at 5 p. m. adjourned.
BOSTON HARBOR
TO BE PROTECTED
Land Purchased by the Gov
ernment for Suitable
Fortifications.
Whan Needed Batteries Are Put In
All Danger From Foreign Fleets
Will Be Averted.
Special Pispatrh to ThÂ» Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 17.â A large tract of land
on Cushlng Hill, Hull, belonging to the
Battery Heights Land Company, has been
sold by Charles Howard Smith to the
T'nlted States Government on private
terms, for fortifying purposes. The total
area is 347. 74S square feet. Batteries lo
cated at these points would command a
full view of the harbor and Massachus
etts Bay, while an auxiliary battery on
Paddocks Island, which, by the way, has
also been purchased, would cover the
broad sound, the Narrows and Nantasket
Roads. The acquiring 1 of this piece of
land is of a great deal of importance to
the national Governrmnt . :ts it is in a
position of great strategic strength in
the defense of the harbor.
If this place were left unfortified It
would be possible for a hostile fleet to
lie behind Telegraph Hill, and without
much difficulty la:id batteries which could
be plac-d on or/ just behind the crown
of the hill and from this elevated position
deliver a plunging lire which would
grettly embarrass the occupants of the
fort. and. if heavy guns rould be landed
would silence it altogether, provided that
the position couid be hold from a land at
tack. What might prove even wnrs<-, it
would be possible for a hostile fleet by
taking shelter behind the hill, to almost
fompletely screen itself from the tire of
the fort, while, as the fnrt itself would be
a fixed spot, its range could be easily as
certained, so that shells c<Â»ui<i be dropped
into it, while with heavy enough metal
the city could be shelled, pra^tlcallly
from cover. With a battery of heavy
guns mounted on the hills this danger
will be entirely removed, and a hostile
fleet will be unable to approach within
four or miles of Boston light without
being subjected to a heavy plunging flrÂ«.

Big Appropriation Bill
Now Before the
House.

ice Is Not Up to
the Standard.
Son of the Famous General in
Favor of a Complete
Reorganization.
LEWIS JOINS THE DEBATE
Denounces thÂ« Dolncrs of Trusts and
Talks About Seligman's Con
gratulations to Hanna.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House.
Washington, Jan. 17.
This was District of Columbia day in
the House, but only three bills of local
importance were passed. The remaind
er of the session was devoted to further
consideration of the army appropria
tion bill. The debate was particularly
notable for a vigorous speech by Mc-
Clellan of New York, a son of General
George B. McClellan. attacking the
present army organization as obsolete
and Inefficient. He asserted that we
were woefully unprepared for war,
should a crisis come, and he contended
f'-r modern methods In organization,
equipment and supplies which would
enable the United States to meet an
emergency.
Lewis of Washington also made a
speech that attracted attention in de
nunciation of trusts, which, he de
clared, were threatening the liberties
of the country. The consideration of
the army appropriation bill was not
completed to-day.
In the course of the general debate
Griffith (R.) of lowa defended the policy
of retiring army officers on three-qurters
pay.
The debate was ma<sf> significant by an
attack upon the efficiency of the several
branches of the army by McClellan (D.)
Of New York, a son of General George
B. McClellan. The army, he declared,
was little better than a clumsily organ
ized national force top heavy with the
gold lace of staff officers, many of whom
had not seen more active service thun
falls to the lot of a member of the police
force. The army should, he declared be
entirely reorganized. He said this In
no spirit of Jingoism, but for the purpose
of calling attention of the country to tho
fart that we were paying a large price
for a very inefficient army, utterly un
prepared for war. while h very small ad
ditional Â» -xpenditure, with proper reor
ganization, would work wonders.
McClellan then went into a detailed
discussion of the various branches of the
service. Our infantry formations, he
said, would have been considered excel
lent in the seventeenth century. He criti
cized particularly the organization of the
cavalry. As indicating the poor quality
or condition of the mounts pur<
for the cavalry, he said, we were each
y ar replacing; 25 per cent of the cavalry
horses, while In Europe, Austria, for in
stance, but 12 per cent of the cavalry
horses were replaced annually, one of
the gravest defects in the present or
ganization, he said, was the lack of a
properly instructed and competent staff
In the modern sense of the word we had
no staff. At the present rate of accumu
lated reserve, he said, at the end of five
years we would only have enough ammu
nition to supply the lnfai.tr>- for two
days at the tiring rate of the battle of
Gettysburg.
Lewis (D.) of "Washington made a vig
orous speech against any increase in the
army, lie created something of an inno
vation by taking his position in the area
in front of the Speaker's rostrum and
speaking to the House face to face as to
a congregation. He charged that ih.
trusts were in control of the country and
constituted the mailed hand of power be
hind the decrees of the courts. If the
army were Increased the people would
he said, be justified in asking whether it
was not- to be used to barricade the
courts and break down everything that
means the freedom of tho country. He
differed, he said, Trom the leader (Bryan)
whose cause he had followed to the pit
He was not willing to subscribe to the
idea that free silver was the single end
to be fought for. There was necessity he
said for a return to the true democracy
which had for its end the freedom of the
individual as an individual. Lewis quoted
a telegram which he said Senator Ilanna
had received from Frankfort. Germany
signed by A. Selipman as follows: "I
congratulate you on your election: it is
most satisfactory to me." That message
he said, came from the man who >.
to placÂ» a mortgace on this Government
of $200.<Â«iO.OOO. Its insolence, he. said had
no parallel in history, save in the message
sent by I'ontius Pilate to the executioner
of Jesus Christ, congratulating him that
his work was well done.
Orosvenor interrupter to ask if Lf>wls
was aware that Seligman was an Ameri
can citizen.
"I am." responded Lewis. "He 1b an
unpatriotic American citizen." (Applause
on the Democratic side.)
Grosvenor recalled the fact that Mr
Seligman. with the credit of his house"
rendered Invaluable aid to the Union
cause during the war. To this Lewis re
plied with the statement that Mr. Selig
man had removed his residence from this
country at a time when he feared the
Income tax law would compel him to pay
his sharÂ«Â» to the support of the Govern
ment. "He is the last man," said he
"whom I should take pride in calling an
American citizen."
Hull (R.) of lowa, chairman of the
Committee on Military Affairs, expressed
concurrence In the views of McClellan to
the extent that he believed the arm y
should be reorganized, as the present or
ganization was obsolete. lne discussion
Â°* v 2?._ n . "/^. f tnt> arm >* was continued
by Wheeler CD.) of Alabama. Clark (D)
of Missouri Cox (D > of Tennessee. Marsh
(R.) of Illinois and others.
Without completing the bill, the com
mittee arose, and at 5:10 p. m. the house
adjourned.

REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 17.â Tn the
matter of the contemplated boulevard
through San Mateo County, Surveyor
Gilbert made a report to-day to the
Board of Supervisors. His estimate, of
the cost was 5310,000. The Commission
of Highways, comprising Messrs. Price.
Ash* 1 and Marson, was present, and
made a supplemental report commend
ing the project. The board considered
and accepted the reports, and instruct
ed the District Attorney to Incorporate
In his call fÂ«.r an election to refund the
county indebtedness and to bond the
county for a $50,000 courthouse, a call
to further bond the county for $310,000
for the proposed boulevard. At the
next regular meeting of the board the
call for an election will be passed, and
the election probably will be held early
in March. After the passage of the call
for an election the Highway Commis
sion will make a tour of the county,
advocating the bonding of the county
ar.<l showing Btereopticon views.
Surveyor Gilbert's report, which was
submitted to-day, was as follows:
To the Honorable the Board of Super
visors of San Mateo County â Gentlemen:
In accordance with the order of your
board passed on November 1. 1597, I here
with submit a report upon the following
highway:
Commencing at the intersection of the
renter line of the county road between
Menlo Park and Palo Alto, and the center
line of the San Francisquita Creek, the
same being the boundary line between
San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, and
extending thence along the best grades
and alignments and as nearly as may be
on existing rights of way through Menlo
Park, Redwood, Belmont, San Mateo,
Millbrae and Colma to the county line be
tween San Mateo and San Francisco
counties, at a point 600 feet, more or less,
west of the Intersection of the said county
line with the center line of the right of
way of the San Francisco and San Jose
Railroad; thence southwesterly on the
best grades and alignments and upon
grades not In excess of four degrees,
through Spanlshtown, San Gregorlo. Pes
cadero and Pigeon Point to the line be
tween San Mateo and Santa Cruz coun
ties, at a point two and a half miles, more
or less, east of Xew Years Point. ,
The right of way of said highway in no
case to be less than forty feet.
The substructure of said highway to be
of durable material, as follows:
Small drains and culverts of the best
quality, thick-walled, salt glazed iron
stone sewer pipe, with concrete guard
walls.
Large culverts and bridges to be of ma
sonry or concrete and existing structures
to be utilized where they may be found of
sufficient durability and strength.
The ditches to be of adequate size and
conducted on true grades to proper out
lets.
The roadbed on that portion of said
highway between Santa Clara and San
Francisco County lines to be not less than
forty fv<'t wiiif and no less than eighteen
(18) feet of this width to ho macadamized
throughout with at least nine (9) inches of
broken stone, well selected, thoroughly
screened and weU roiled and sprinkled
and laid in three layers.
The remainder <<f the roadbpd to be
graded to conform with the macadam por
tion, rollfci] and sprinkled to form an
tarth road for rammer use.
The essential features of the work on
that portion of paid highway between the
San Francisco County line and the Santa
â¢ 'ruz County line are to correct Urn ex
isting dangerous and at times Impassable
grades and alignments, and to grs
roadbed not less than twenty (20) feet in
â¢width upon grades not exceeding four (4)
per cent: the roadbed on this portion of
said highway to be not less thi-n forty (40)
Met In width in the level cutting and
twenty (20) feel of graded roadway on
Bldehill cuttings.
That portion of said graded hlghway
from the San Francisco County line to
the summit of the Snn Pedro Mountains
Is abundantly supplied with rock of â 
fair quality for surfacing ut a moderate
cost.
That portion of said graded roadway
from the summit of the Ban Pedro Mount
ains to Spanishtown traverses a section
of country, the suhsoil of which is a good
road surfacing material, except in cer
tain limited portions thereof which are to
be surfaced with rork or graveL
The remainder of this highway from
Spanishtown to the Santa Cruz County
line to be graded as herein merit lon. d. and
graveled or surfaced with rock as the M
ture of the soil may reo,uir<\ and SJ th<
locality may furnish suitable material
The estimated cost of this work In $.110,
000.
Mo estimates are made for riKhtn of way
for the various properties and lntÂ«rÂ»sts
Involved will be sufficiently benefited to
Justify the wanting of such right without
charge to the bond fund.
I respectfully recommend that no work
be done, nor contract let, except upon tin
basis of detailed plans and specifications
prepared by this office and approved by
the Department of. Highways of the Stalo
of California.
In their auxiliary report the mem
bers of the Highway Commission say:
Wr- have made special studies of the
development of suitable quarries. In ex
amining all existing quarries and many
available cites we arc pleased to find that
your county furnishes an abundance of
excellent materials. There exist several
localities from v.hich an excellent sub
rrade or foundation layer of material can
be obtained.
Fn.m some of these the hardest flinty
Jasper (or chert> can be separated, which,
mlxt'd with one-fourth of the siliceous
limestone from near Byrne's store, will
make a surface material of the best qual
ity. In regard to this latter material, it
has been alleged that it injures the var
nish and palÃt Of vehicles, \Y> sub
mitted t..Â»s stone to a urelimfnary exami
nation In the College of Chemistry in the
T'nlversity of California, and l'nd this
idea entirely unfounded, the material
being neutral and harmless; the opposite
Idea being probably advanced as r>.n ex
cuse for neglect in promptly cleaning ve
hicles of dust or mud. which from any
source is injurious ir" neglected.
The mixture of the hardest, clean and
welt-crusted jasper, with a proper pro
portion of the siliceous limestone as a
cementing and binding material, with
thorough rolling and sprinkling, forms â 
good road surface of unexcelled quality
and durability, and we are pleased to note
that your county furnishes soon excellent

| the front of this important step.
In an interview with The Call cor
j respondent. Commissioner Price said
regarding the proposed boulevard:
â¢'The Department of Highways has
Riven some attention to the condition
of roads and the linancial policy of the
| present road building system in San
Mateo County. It finds that the Board
of Supervisors is expending every year
in the neighborhood of 160,000 fur road ;
purposes. In the year IV"> there was
: expended $63. 278 95 for general road
purposes. The assesssed valuation of i
I taxable property in the county for the
same year was about $13,284,000, of
which $11,643,170 was assessed for road
purposes at the rate or 40 cents on the
$100 for the year 1596 and for 1817 4'J
cents on the $100. the board taking ad
vantage of the late law permitting an
assessment of I mills on the dollar for ;
i general road purposes.'
"The Department of Highways has
; made a careful estimate of the cost of \
; building a model road upon good i
grades and alignments, and is informed
that in no county in the State is there
i a greater demand for better roads than
in San Mateo County. The topography
of the county is such that a portion of ;
the coast range mountains virtually
separates the eastern from the western
inhabitants. Along the shore of San
Francisco Bay the eastern division of ;
the county is located, one of the most
i prosperous and important sections of
the State. Over the roads of this sec
tion all travel from or to San Fran
cisco, by land, must pass. There is no
other outlet to the interior of the State
by land, except this. It is a portion of
the peninsula upon which stands the
metropolis of the Pacific Coast. The
present county road is graded and I
graveled or rocked to some extent, but !
with very inferior material, and upon i
very faulty grades.
"The electric car lines have taken
possession nf the present county road i
â  from the San Francisco County line to i
a point near Baden, a distance of about I
six miles. The roadbed has been so i
thoroughly neglected and used by the
ear tracks that the Commissioners are i
inclined to resort to another route
through this section of the county, as
no good highway can b<=> constructed on
the present right of way with the car
lines and other obstacles to contend
against.
"A mad constructed along the coast
on good grades will become the great
artery of communication with the me- ,
tropolis, n<>t <mly for the people living
along and adjacent to the road, but to
all travel from the coast counties
south of San Mateo and San Francisco.
It win Immediately open to inspection
some of the most inviting country on
the Pacific Slope, and if properly con
structed is destined to become one of
the scenic resorts of our State.
"Xo county in the State possesses ;
more favorable material for road pur
poses than does San Mateo. The length
of road from the Santa Clara line to |
San Francisco and thence to the Santa
Croi lino is about ninety-five miles
and the Highway Commissioners have
asked for $310,000 with which to con
struct the road. With this sum they
propose to correct the grades of the
present road. Increase the width of
macadam or rock roadway to eighteen
feet or more and replace all bridges,
culverts and drains with rock or con
crete and drains with terra cotta drain
pipes laid In cement.
"The conditions upon whi^h this per
mission shall be granted, if the people
grant the same, is unl- rsto ! to be
that the Board <>f Supervisors agree to
reduce the road tax levy every year
hereafter to the amount required to
pay interest and principal upon the
bonds as they may become due. Under
these conditions and none other would
the Department of Highways consent
to undertake the task of convincing
the people that it would be a business
proposition. It will thus be seen that
this scheme does not purpose the in
crease of the taxes of the property
owner except in incorporated towns,
where no road tax is levied.
"The towns of San Mateo and Red
wood ran well afford to pay their por
tion of the tax In return for the
benefits derived from a pood road
system. It will increase trade, increase
travel, build up the surrounding coun
try, populate the beautiful building
places and gradually increase the
value of assessable property in the
county.
M NÂ« less than 500 bridges, culverts
and drainways must be maintained on
the road. Borne of the bridges are ex
tremely expensive to maintain, many
of them being over streams of a consid
erable watershed, entailing the con
struction of costly bridges. The lum
ber bills alone for the care of San Ma
teo County bridges and culverts often
reaches $7000 per year, without the con
struction of a single new bridge. The
average bills for lumber for the past
four years has been $3000 for each year.
It has cost the county of San Mateo
$20,000 for lumber, labor on the bridges
and drainways for the years 1895 and
18P<5, or $10,000 per year. How much
more has been expended in labor the
records do not show.
"The present structures, with one or
two exceptions, are all composed of
wood, which are fast decaying and will
require rebuilding very soon. No less
than 140 bridges of lengths varying
from twenty to 200 feet, span. the var
ious drainways of the road above de
scribed. The life of a bridge construct
ed of wood may be put at five years.
Therefore in the next five or ten years
the county of San Mateo must renew
all these structures either with wood
or some other material. If the present
system of building with lumber is con
tinued it is safe to estimate the cost of
bridges for ten years next following on
the present highway at $70,000. or $7000
per year, and as long bm this system
Im continued every ten years win call
for nil expenditure of $70,000.
"The taxpayers can well figure what
tin- future moans, run upon the pres
ent tÂ»yntoni of temporary repair*. In
twenty yours you will expend for
hrlrtrcoH nlonÂ« $140,000: In thirty years
no !â¢â¢â¢ than $210,000. Win this pay? If
we replace these structures with rock
or concrete the expense will be at an
end, stone roadways can be construct
ed over them, thus making a perfect,
imperishable roadway."

The celebrated chemist, Dr.

; This statement by the eminent

in addition to the guarantee
which the .U. S. Government
gives of its being 100 per cent

seen upon every bottle of the

that it is bottled under the di-

Five Others in a Run
From Honolulu.
Arrival of the Wrecked Bark
Blairlogie's Crew From
Papeete.
Aver ,l Sailing Vessels Purchased
and Chartered for the Klon
dike Trade.
The fleet of racers from Honolulu ar- '
rived in a bunch yesterday. Sunday
night they were all off the Farallones,
and came into port one after the other
In the morning. The distance covered
Is considerably over 2000 miles, and yet
there was not six hours" difference in
the time occupied by the different yes-
Bels making the run.
They sighted each other on many oc
casions during the race, and the bark
entine Archer and the brig: W. G. Ir
win were in company on several occa
sions. In light weather the brig would
run away from her more heavily spar
red companion, but when it came on to
blow a bit the Archer always caught
up with her. The fleet that got in was
the brig W. G. Irwin, the barkentines
W. H. Dimond and Archer, the bark
Albert and the schooner Transit. The
brig Lurline also came In from Kahu
lul, but as she was not in the race her
time does not count.
The Lurllne was off Meiggs wharf
end at anchor before any of the other
vessels showed up. The Irwin was the
next to come in, and she was followed
by the Dimond. Then came the Arch
er, in tow of the tug Rescue, and the
Albert, In to-w of the tug Alert. The
Transit, which was backed in Honolu
lu to win the race, was the last of the
fleet to get in.
The barkentine City of Papeete ar
rived from Tahiti yesterday with eight
een of the crew of the wrecked British
bark Blairlogie on board. The vessel
Trent ashore on Matahira Island, one
of the Tahita group, and became a to
tal wreck. The crew escaped, and Cap
tain Maokay sent a boat to Papeete to
ask for assistance. The steamer Croix
de Pud was sent out by the French.
Government, and brought in the ship
wrecked men, all of whom took pas
sage on the Papeete/ save four who will
cast their fortunes in with the natives.
ThoFe who came up on the Papeete
were Captain Mackay, his wife and two
children. First Officer Archibald Faill.
Becond Officer J. A. Haddock, Third Of
ficer John Bishop. Carpenter J. Howe
and thirteen Beamen. The Blairlogie
was from Pelagoa Bay for Astoria, and
went ashore during heavy weather.
Captain Mackay says that when she
Btruck on the reef everything possible
was done to get her off, but she swung
broadside on, and soon began to break
up. The entire crew had to walk across
the island on which they were wreck
ed, In order to meet the boat that was
Bent to their rescue. When half way
across the men deserted the captain
and his wife and children, saying that
It was a case of every man for him-
Belf.
When Captain Hutton of the French
steamer heard what the men had done
he refused to allow any of them aboard
until they went back and brought in
the captain and his family. This the
men did. and then the Croix de Sud
started for Papeete.
Frank Cookson, late chief engineer of
the Proereso. is going out as chief en
gineer of the steam schooner Navarro.
Nearly all the berths on the steamer

The steamer City of Stockton was
nearly eight hours late in getting in
yesterday. When a mile out of Stock
ton she stuck in the mud, and the cap
tain and crew had great difficulty in
frying her.
The T'nited States steamer Adams
palled from Honolulu on the Oth inst..
Bnd may bÂ« expected to arrive here In
time for the Jubilee celebration. She
has on board eight prisoners and four
Elck men from the Baltimore and Ben

Mare bland as soon as the warship
reaches port.
The old scaling: schooner Emma and
Jjoulsa is having a hard time of It In
Hawaiian waters. She was purchased
by San Diego people when her sealing
days were over and placed in the
Honolulu trade. This was her first voy
age to the Paradise of the Pacific as a
â trader, and it is likely to be her last.
The Hawaiian authorities got it into
their heads that there was something
wrong with the vessel's cargo, and
threw every obstacle possible in the
captain's way. The Hawaiian Inde
pendent said: "The schooner Emma
end I^ouisa has seventy tons of oargo
left in her hold. The Is making
n storehouse of the vessel, which is be
ing guarded by Custom House guards
et the rate of $6 n day." Cnrnmentins:
unon this matter, the Independent said:
"The owners of the schooner and its
cargo attempted a commercial pxneri
ment whi^h might have materially ben
efited ouite a section of this communi
ty. It is unfortunate that their first re
ception should have beÂ»-n so onkind'v,
but probably, as ever, the eusto-m offi
cials, when properly called upon may
be in a position to justify the extra pre
cautions they are said to have taken in
resrard to the vessel's cargo."
The schooner Adam "W. Spies, from
Boston to Honolulu, was on fire while
the Peru was in port. Tt started in the
lazarette. and Cantain Ondotte is of the
opinion that it was Incendiary. The
crows of the Baltimore. Bennington
and Adams were soon on the scene, and
it did not take them long to get the
fire under control.
The call for ships for t*e Klondike
rush Is still unabated. The schooner
M. Coleman has been chartered at the
rate of $100 a day and thÂ» ship Eclipse
at the rate of $50 a day.. ln the case of
theColeman the owner paysthe rnnriinE:

Mor* Reports of the Success of the
AlasKa Trade Committee's
Car.
D. M. Carman, secretary of the Alaska
trade committee, returned Sunday even
ing from Chicago, and reports that the
interest in Alaska and the Klondike
throughout the sections visited, as well
as those with which he corresponds, far
exceeds his expectations, and he believes
the number of people going Into the
Alaska gold fields during the coming sea
son has not been overestimated.
The trip from here to Chicago was a
signal success. It Is doubtful whether a
party for a similar purpose ever received
such welcomes and was entertained by
such people as met the Alaska trade com
mittee's car. In every city visited the
party was received by tin- Mayors, to
gether with representative business men,
iind in three of the States the Governors
came to the car and extended a welcome
to the party. In addition to this the
Governor of Nebraska sent a long tele
gram to Omaha expressing his regret at
not being able to meet the party, and
subsequently he sent hia chief of staff to
personally receive it. Governor Tanner
of Illinois was at the Great Northern and
awaited the arrival of the party there.
Mr. Carman was quite enthusiastic in
the expression of his views concerning
the desirability of the jubilee mining ex
hibit being taken to Omaha at the <-]oÂ«a
of the fair here. He believes that greater
good can be done for California in gene
ral, as well as San Francisco in particu
lar, by this than by any other effort
that could be put forth in connection
with the Trans-Mississippi and Inter
national Exposition at Omaha.

A FENDER HAS BEEN ADOPTED.
The San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway Company yesterday
asked the Board of Supervisors for permission to equip all Its cars with
fenders. The officers of the company. In making the request, say they
have been considering the question of fenders, and after careful examina
tion of the many contrivances that have been submitted for the considera
tion of the board and of their company they concluded that the Hunter au
tomatic fender was superior to most, if not all, of them. The fender they be
lieved was essential for use In this city, owing to the severe grades over
which the electric car lines run. It has a scoop fender under the car Just in
front of the wheels that Is automatically dropped and locked to the rails.
Another and important feature which Induced the selection of the fender
for use by the company is a resilient lath cushion attached in front of the
car which takes up in a great measure the force of a blow struck by a mov
ing car, at the same time tripping the fender in front of the wheels, allow
ing it to fall and lock on the rails and preventing a body from going under
the wheels. The railroad officers say in support of their request: "We
have taken this step in the hope that we may at least succeed in Impress
ing on your honorable board, as well as on the public, that we desire to
equip our cars with a life-saving device," and that no consideration other
than merit has governed us in the selection made."

SAX QUBMTJN PRISON. Jan. 17.â
Warden Hale lost one of his striped
guests to-day, when Rudolph Wagner, a
convict serving a sentence for burglary,
managed, through a technical point, to
gain his liberty.
Wagner's case I? one In whlc.i a law
point of considerable Interest was In
volved, and that he was successful In
gaining his freedom may encourage oth
ers In the big penitentiary to adopt sim
ilar methods. Wagner applied to Superior
Judge Frank M. Angellottl of Marln
County for a writ of habeas corpus. It
was issued, and the hearing came on to
day In San Rafael. Late this afternoon
Judge Angellottl rendered his opinion,
which gave to the convict his freedom.
The decision, which Is In writing. Is, In
part, as follows:
On December 22, ISP3, Wagner, on a plea of
guilty of burglary, wan adjudged to suffer one
year's Imprisonment in the State Prison at
San Quentin. i . ".\ .â¢*â¢â 
Subsequently, to-wlt: On December 27, 1893,
he entered a plea of guilty to a second In
formation for burglary that had been filed
against him. and. waiving time, was there
upon sentenced to Imprisonment at said State
Prison for live years, "said term to commence
from expiration of sentence rendered Decem
ber 22, 1533. of one year.'" On December 30,
18M, he was, by the Prison Directors, deprived
of all his credits. â¢ â¢ â¢ ..
Petitioner's claim is that the two sentences
ran concurrently, and that he became en
titled to his discharge upon the expiration of
four years' imprisonment In the State Prison,
and in this contention I am satisfied that he
is sustained by the statute.
If both convictions had been suffered prior
to the pronouncing of sentence In either case
section 669, Penal Code, would have applied
and" the Imprisonment on the second conviction
made to commence at the termination of the
first term. As I understand the law that sec
tion prescribes the only case in which one
term can be made to commence at the ex
piration of other terms. In all other caÂ»es
the term of Imprisonment fixed by the Judg
ment commences to run upon the delivery of
the defendant at the place of imprisonment.
This is the case with the second, or four
year Judgment, pronounced against petitioner,
and he, having suffered Imprisonment for the
full term, has satisfied the demands of the
law and Is entitled to his discharge. Let an
order be entered accordingly.
Wagner has not been a model prisoner
since his confinement in San Quentin and
lost all of his credits for breach of disci
pline. However, now he has his free
dom and others In the prison having
double sentences to serve may secure
their liberty In the same manner.

WON'T PAY HIS
HOTEL BILLS
Byron S. Burns Wanted
for Defrauding an
Innkeeper.
The Complaining Witness Is
Mrs. Irwin of the Hotel
Bradbury.
Lady Proprietor of the Hotel Suther
land, Where He Is Stopping, Is
Also After Him.
Mrs. Tlllie A. Irwin of the Hotel
Bradbury swore to a complaint In
Judge Low's court yesterday afternoon
Byron S. Burns with defraud
ing an innkeeper.
Mrs. Irwin, in stating her case, said:
"Burns and his wife and two children
came to my hotel on July 4 last and se
cured a suit of rooms. He represented
to me that he was connected with the
Sonoma Wine Company and had re
cently come from the East. He had a
good appearance and dressed and spoke
well. As it is a rule in my house to pay
in advance I asked him for money. He
made an excuse that he was then short
of funds, but would pay me very soon.
"My suspicions were aroused from the
fact that they had no trunks with them
and after a week or id I asked him
where his trunks were. He replied that
owing to the crush caused by the Chris
tian Endeavorers coming to the city he
supposed the trunks had got mixed up
by the transfer company, but would
come all right soon. Things went on
for two or three months, but there was
no appearance of any trunks, and he
finally said they had been detained in
New Jersey.
"I got altogether $90 out of him and
about October 11 I told him he would
have to leave by October 15, and he
must pay me then $167, the balance due
me. On that day he quietly removed
the few things belonging to them and
was slipping away, when I met him In
the hall. I demanded my money and
he gave me the 'Ha-ha.' I have been
since trying to find him, and it was
only this morning that I learned he and
his wife and two children were stopping
at the Hotel Sutherland, on Sutter
street.
"I went there and saw him, hut he
declined to pay me, telling me frankly
that ho had nn funds. I asked him to
frive me an order on the Sonoma "Winp
Company, but he paid he had left them
some weeks aj?Â°. I ascertained that he
had never fvÂ»Â«Â»n connected with that
company at all.
"I consider him a regular hotel dead

The lady proprietor of the Hotel
Sutherland accompanied Mr?. Trwin to
Judpe Low's court .and also wanted to
sipn a complaint against Burns, but as
he was still livinp there she did not ob
tain It. She corroborated what Mrs.
Irwin said about Burns owing her $80,
and said she would secure an attach
ment from the Justice Court for his
trunk.
Burns claims to he a teacher of elo
cution, hut Mrs. Irwin said that she harj
made diligent Inquiry and could not
find any one who knew him or where he
taupht his class. She does not believe
that he has a class anywhere.
RECEIVED BRASS
BUT NOT GOLD
Robert Mental of the Lombard
Auction Rooms Arrested for
Petty Larceny.
The Police HayÂ« Been Receiving 1 Nu
merous Complaints From Women
Who Bought Jewelry There.
Mental, of the Lombard auction
rooms. Market street, opposite Fifth, was
arrested yesterday afternoon on a â wrwr
rant from Judge Campbell's court charg
ing him with petty larceny.
The complaining witness Is Mrs. Domp- j
eter, 401*4 Oak street, and she allegres
that a few days ago she went Into the
auction rooms to see what was going on. !
A lot of Jewelry was put up. and a woman i
"capper" came to her and advised her to j
buy the lot and she would buy a portion
from her. She hesitated, and another
woman "capper" whispered to her that
phe would buy another portion of the I
lot, the two making up the price asked
for the supposed jewelry, which was bid
up to $12. She paid $2 ."0 on deposit and
took the jewelry away with her.
Becoming suspicious, she showed the
Jewelry to three different Jewelers, and
they all declared that it was brass in
stead of gold and not worth 25 cents al
together. She went to the auction rooms
and demanded the return of her money,
but It was refused, so she went to the
Police Court and secured the warrant.
The police have received numerous
complaints recently from women who had
been entrapped Into buying Jewelry in
the same way by women "cappers," and
Chief Lees only on Saturday gave Cap
tain Splllane Instructions to detail an of
ficer to watch the place. In several In
stances Prosecuting Attorney Drury of
Judge Joachimsen's court sent a letter
to the auction rooms with women who
had called to get warrants of arrest, and
it had the effect of getting the money re- j
funded.
CARMEL COAL MINE SOLD.
Alexander M. Allen of Oakland the Pur
chaser of the Property.
MONTEREY, Jan. 17.â Alexander M. Al
len, a mining man of Oakland, who for
the imst six months has been negotiating
for the purchase of the property owned
by the Carmel Land and Coal Company,
on which the Carmel coal mine is situ
ated, has at last closed the deal with the
company and is now sole owner of the
640 acres of its property. The land trans
ferred Includes part of the old Rincho
San Jose y Sur Chiquito in the Point Lo
boa vicinity, about ten miles from Mon
terey. When the Carmel Land and Coal
Company bought the land about eight
years ago. it laid out a townsite which it
called Carmelito. and, some of the lots
having been previously sold by the com
pany, the entire tract could not be trans
ferred to Mr. Allen.
The Carmel coal mine was opened
when the town was surveyed and platted
and was worked profitably for some time,
but was afterward abandoned and not
reopened till three months ago. when the
present owner bepran his investigations re
garding the value of the property. Mr.
Allen has already expended considerable
money on the mine, but it nas developed
In a manner that fully justifies the outlay,
he thinks. The coal is semi-bituminous,
of an excellent quality and is present hÂ£
large quantities in the mine.

tered with a babe in her arms, and, plac
ing- it on the bar. loft with only this fare
well, speaking loud and distinctly:
"The father of this child deserted me
and my habe, caring more for whisky
than for either of us. I wish to tender
now his child, so that his appetite may
be gratified to the extent of the deposit."
Her remarks created consternation, and
there was a wild rush for the youngster,
seventy-five men coming- forward to ask
for the little waif. The Probate Judge
was compelled to settle the controversy
and has taken charge of the baby. The
affair is creating wholesome comment.
The woman's name is Bell, and her hus

JUDGE CAMPBELL'S JOKES.
THE course of the Mission street Boodler in
attempting to destroy Judge Campbell's reputa
tion as a judicial humorist is reprehensible iv the
extreme. From a literary standpoint it is utterly in
defensible.
For a long time the bewhiskered jurist has been
the Boodler's beau ideal of a joker. It has never
tired of inflicting his witticisms upon the public, dur
ing the past two months especially having in this re
spect flagrantly trampled upon the rights of its read
ers. During that period it is reported to have kept
a writer constantly stationed in Judge Campbell's
court with instructions to transfer that jurist's light
est sayings to paper. Two or three times a week,
with an utter disregard of the close season in chest
nutting, it has appeared with a column of jokes al
leged to have been cracked by the judicial humorist.
Of course the discerning few have all along known
that the attempt of the Boodler to work up a repu
tation for Judge Campbell as a joker was attributable
to the fact that one of its editors had fallen into the
clutches of the police and was before the police court
for examination on a charge of criminal libel. The
Boodler flattered the Judge in the hope that he might
be induced to release its editor from the thralldom oi
the law.
The moment, however, Judge Campbell turned it
down â or, to be more technical, declared that its edi
tor must stand trial â the Boodler pounced upon him
with savage fury. It is now rumored that it has a
man stationed in his court under instructions to steal
all his jokes and attribute them to Police Judges Low
&nd Joachimsen. We do not blame Judge Campbell
for protesting. This method of reprisal is, as we have
already remarked, utterly indefensible. The liberty
the Boodler is taking with police court literature
ought to render it liable to indictment for assault
with a deadly weapon.
Everybody knows that the jokes which the Boodler
is attributing to Judges Low and Joachimsen are
Campbell's. Many actually have whiskers upon them,
plainly showing their origin. Besides, the Boodler's
method of revenge should be barred out of journal
ism. It is uncivilized and barbaric. It comes under
the head of cruel and unusual punishments. Our ad
vice to Judge Campbell is to lay his grievance be
fore the Grand Jury.
THE USEFUL INJUNCTION.
THE injunction has won much admiration. Per
haps there is nothing known to the beautiful
civilization, of which there are evidences all
about us such as may be discerned with the naked
eye, that has done more to show that man did not
waste the time he spent in developing from a state of
monkeyhood. No simian chattering in a tree ever
had the blissful knowledge that if a neighbor proposed
to thump him with a cocoanut he could protect him
self with an injunction. The injunction has never
yet been employed to check the cyclone, stay the pre
mature frost nor stifle the gab of the political speaker.
Neither has it been applied to the regulation of the
movements of the sun. With these exceptions, how
ever, it has been adapted to most human needs and the
exceptions will merely serve to show that ahead are
new possibilities.
The latest instance in which the injunction achieved
fame was in South Dakota. There a young man and
a young woman wanted to get married, but a pair of
parents $aid "nay" iir a loud voice. They had, with
their riper discretion, picked out another fellow t(*
lead their daughter to the altar, and they proposed to
have her led despite her tendency to balk. But, being
wise in their generation, they did not rely on simple
protest nor the sometimes hasty shotgun; they knew
a better trick. They got an injunction restraining
the ardent suitor from interfering and from intruding
upon the happy home where the sacred knot was
being tied. An officer was on hand to serve the pa
per, and when the lover appeared he was clapped into
ir.il. Meanwhile the bride was given away amid con
gratulations and many a hope that they might live
happily ever after.
Now that it is all over and with no desire to mar
a honeymoon so auspiciously begun, the suggestion
is made that the old man get out a new injunction to
prevent the almost son-in-law from giving him the
kick he deserves, and have tacked to -it as a rider the
provision that the daughter must not elope.
A correspondent goes to considerable length in
treating the subject, "Why does Southern beauty cap
ture Northern men?" and to show the vital impor
tance of the screed relates that since the war twelve
Southern belles have been married to men from this
side of Mason and Dixon's line. She seems to have
overestimated the relevancy of the essay. The war
closed nearly thirty-three years ago. If she cannot
dig up a few more matrimonial samples she would be
wise to rewrite her stuff giving the title, "Why the
Southern beauty does not catch on with more fa
cility."
THE LOS ANGELES WATER WAR.
A CAREFUL reading of the contract, made in
1868, between the little village of Los Angeles
and the little corporation which undertook to
build a $1000 fountain and supply the people with ten
inches of potable water, will furnish complete infor-
mation upon the accrued rights of the great city of
Los Angeles and of the big corporation which is
furnishing water to its tens of thousands of people.
The contract was made in good faith on both sides,
and is apparently without ambiguity. The little town
had provided and owned its water supply. It leased
its water property to the little corporation for thirty
years, with no provision for a renewal, but with the
expressed intention of resuming control of its own
property at the end of that time, agreeing to' arbitrate
the value of the betterments put thereon by the cor
poration and to pay the award so reached. Between
individuals there would not be a moment's hesitation
nor a word of dispute over the terms of such a con
tract. The arbitrators would be chosen and the value of
the betterments would be determined and the trans*
action would close in business order and decency.
Why cannot this be the case when the parties in in
terest are a municipal and a private corporation? The
wisdom and economy of municipal ownership are not
in issue at all. Such ownership may be wise or un
wise, that does not touch the issue.
The sole point is the right of the city of Los An
geles to enforce a contract and recover possession of
her own property and franchises at the expiration of
the lease.
The laws of California give sufficient advantage to
the leaseholder. He need not surrender the proprcty
on the expiration of his lease nor forfeit possession
upon failure to perform any covenant of the lease.
No matter what terms of the contract he may violate
the lease is judicable and the leaseholder cannot be
expelled from possession except by judicial process.
It is not necessary to state the reasons for this condi
tion, inherent in legal principles, by which the owner
of property is considered as deserving the harsh hand
of the law. while the dishonest possessor of it under a
leasehold is protected in its use beyond his tenure or
after violation of his covenants, to the spoliation of
the rightful owner.
All of these advantages run to the artificial person,
the corporation, as a leaseholder, and to the disad
vantage of the municipal corporation, the owner of
the water plant. It is for this reason that the people,
the actual owners of the property, need and are en
titled to the zeal and fidelity of the officers of the
municipal corporation. The stockholders of the pri
vate corporation are getting the zealous service of
its officers, and what evil genius denies to the people
similar zeal on the part of the officers of the muni
cipal corporation?
The disadvantage put by the laws of the State upon
the ownership of leased property is a very high reason
why in such cases as this in Los Angeles the people
should be faithfully represented. If the city govern
ment fail to make good its rights under the contract
the most serious consequences may follow. Suppose
that the date fixed for arbitrating the value of the
betterments pass without action, then the rights of the
people will be seriously affected. These rights un
derlie all others. The right of the people to govern
ment in the form of a municipal corporation had to
precede the right of the private corporation to mak%
a contract of lease of the property which belonged to
the people.
Corporations must be taught to respect the source
of their existence and of all the rights they have.
Partisan corruption and official treachery must not be
peimitted to hold the rights of all subordinate to the
interests of less than all.
In pursuance of its settled policy The Call sustains
the right of the people of Los Angeles to recover
possession of their own property in the way and
upon the terms set forth in the contract. We ask for
them only what is nominated in the bond. They want
no drop of blood nor anything vital nor valuable be
yond the plain terms of the contract, compliance with
which is as easy as honesty always is.
A SINECURE AND AN INCUBUS.
WHEN a public office degenerates into a pine
cure it soon becomes an incubus, and an in
cubus is a nuisance. This is what has become
of the position of State quarantine officer in this city.
The national quarantine service does all the work of
protecting the port against the importation of disease
and does it well. The State officer does nothing but
draw his salary, and cannot be said to draw it well
because money taken without being earned is never
well paid nor well received.
The utter futility of the office is shown by the fact
that captains of incoming ships pay no attention what
ever to the demands or the pleadings of the official
who holds it. If any captain should pay attention to
him the official would be in a quandary because the
State has provided him with no quarantine station at
which to hold the ship or send the passengers whom
he might wish to inspect or fumigate.
Being a complete sinecure in every respect, the
office is an incubus on the taxpayers who have to pro
vide the money to keep it up, and on the shipping
interests of the port which it sometimes disturbs.
Being without power, the official is without dignity.
Every time he exerts himself to make a play before
the public the ship captains are obliged to ignore him
and thus treat him with what seems to be contempt.
Thus his spasmodic activity tends to diminish the
prestige of the State, and, bad as the office is as a
sinecure, it becomes worse when the official who
holds it makes it an incubus, not only to the pockets
but the patience of the people.
An official who is nothing else soon makes him
self a nuisance. Thus we have seen our State quar
antine officer who is paid to serve the whole State
making himself compliant to special interests, acting
as the representative of private enterprises, becoming
a special reporter for a newspaper and refusing
news to others. The lack of any public work to do
renders him forgetful of the fact that he is paid to
serve the public, and accordingly when by any chance
he plays at quarantine officer he seems to regard the
performance not as a public duty, but as a private
snap.
A sinecure should be abolished, an incubus should
be removed and a nuisance should be suppressed.
There is no need in this city of a State quarantine
office nor of a State quarantine officer. There are
many uses to which the money of the taxpayers can
be better applied than that of maintaining a futile
pretense at doing something which the National Gov
ernment is already doing to the satisfaction of the
public.
China is said to be dickering with England, but
perhaps a better term could have been chosen to ex
press the situation. The mouse about to be eaten
might feel an impulse to dicker with the cat, yet their
relations hardly rise to the degree of equality im*
plied by this description.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1898.
AN important step has been taken toward the
accomplishment of the long discussed grand
boulevard around the bay. The credit of the
step belongs to San Mateo County, or at least to
the Supervisors of that county. There is every rea
son to believe, however, that the people will indorse
it and San Mateo will have the honor of leading the
way in the great enterprise.
The State Highway Commission, which has taken
an earnest interest in the proposed boulevard, visited
San Mateo and, in association with the County
Surveyor, had surveys made of the route of
the highway. By these surveys it was determined
that the boulevard could be constructed from the line
of San Francisco County through San Mateo to the
line of Santa Clara County and a highway to the line
of Santa Cruz County without entailing extra
taxation upon the people, provided a bond issue
was voted for the purpose.
The Supervisors, after careful consideration of the
plans proposed by the commission, approved them'
and decided to provide for a bond election at an
early date. Full details of the plans and the steps
taken by the Supervisors are published in another
column. They show that the movement is well
launched and in every way merits the support of the
community that is to be benefited by its comple
tion.
The action in San Mateo will be hailed with satis
faction by the progressive element of the people in
all sections of the State. It is but a short time
ago that Sacramento by a large majority voted for
the construction of the Folsom boulevard, and the
San Mateo movement following so swiftly after
shows that the progressive impulse is felt to a
greater or lesser degree throughout the common
wealth.
It may be accounted a sure thing that if the people
of San Mateo go forward in the enterprise as did
those of Sacramento the people of San Francisco and
Santa Clara will imitate the example. We shall have
the grand drive around the bay in \ time much
shorter than the most sanguine looked fr>r. In fact
it would not be surprising to see all the counties take
up the enterprise before the year is over and set to
work to accomplish it with a vigor that will make
it a new illustration of the energy and public spirit
which now animate California and her people.
UNDER the title "The Farce of the Chinese Ex-Â»
elusion Laws" J. Thomas Scharf, who
until recently held the post of Chinese
inspector at the port of New York, con
tributes to the North American Review
an article which in a striking and impressive
manner directs attention to serious defects in the ad
ministration of this important part of our protective
legislation.
It will be remembered that not lonj< ago Mr. Scharf
resigned his office on the express ground that owing
to judicial technicalities and official corruption it was
impossible to enforce the laws. At the time of the
resignation he made a statement of facts to justify his
action. This statement was published in The Call and
commented on at the time. The article in the Re
view elaborates the original argument and gives stat
istics which demonstrate the truth of his charges and
show that as administered at present our Chinese ex
clusion laws are but sources of fraud and corruption.
According to Mr. Scharf, the rumber of Chinese!
in the country is not known, nor ii it possible to learn
how many enter in each year. The census reports are
not accurate on this subject for the Chinese avoid the
census taker when possible and deceive him when
they cannot evade him. In proof of this statement it
is noted that the census of 1800 gave 2935 as the num
ber of Chinese in the State of New York. When the
registration under the Geary act was completed, how
ever, it was found that over 7000 had registered in
New York City alone. The number of Chinese in the,
whole country, according to the census of 1800, was
107,475, but Mr. Scharf estimates the correct number
to be not less than 700,000.
Chinese immigration continues along the whole
length of the northern and southern borders of the
country and along the Gulf coast. It is particularly
large in the State of Vermont. The Custom-house
records of that State show that between June I. 1895,
and February 23, 1897, 2947 Chinese came into the
country legally. How many were smuggled in is not
known.
Much of this continuous stream of Chinese immi
gration is due to corruption on the part of officials
charged with the duty of preventing it. That, how
ever, is not the worst feature of the situation. The
greater evil is the attitude of the courts toward the
law. Mr. Scharf cites many authorities on this point.
The United States Attorney for Vermont said that
in his district "hearings are in a certain sense far
cical." Leigh Chalmers, examiner in the Attorney-
General's office, said in an official report "nine out of
ten of these cases do not r.mnunt to the dignity of a
farce." The United States Attorney at Buffalo in a
report to the Attorney-General stated that he had
attended certain Chinese examinations and that "it
was absolutely useless under the present condition of
affairs to attend any further examinations as it was a
waste of time and money."
The causes assigned for the inability of the law
officers to enforce the law are: "The loose interpreta
tion of the law by sympathetic United States Com
missioners, the radical diversity of opinion by Judges
of the Federal courts, the crafty practices and fraudu
lent devices of the Chinese, the ready aid of well
paid allies along the border line, perjured witnesses,
and oath breaking and bribe taking officials."
In the face of such obstacles it seems impossible
to enforce the exclusion act, but the necessity of en
forcement is imperative and the seeming impossibility
must give way before it. Mr. Scharfs article will help
the cause by arousing public sentiment In the East to
something like the earnestness of the West on the
issue. The wily Chinese may be hard to stop, but a
resolute people can do it.
England's courtesy in deciding that the Vice-
President of the United States shall be permitted to
take precedence of the British Embassador at Wash
ington dinners deserves some token of grateful ap
preciation. To cable over permission for the Prince"
of Wales to get to the table ahead of Embassador
Hay and receive the prime cut of white meat would
be a neat and delicate return.
A prominent Washington woman shot herself, and
all her friends at once refused to tell the particulars,
â¢but threw an air of mystery about the matter. The
natural result was the creation of a belief that the
shooting was not accidental, which was not, it is
supposed, the purpose of the friends.
It was a notable triumph of evening journalism
that only one of the reporters who greeted Dole went
into hysterics about him.

WHO IS RESPONSIBLE ?
t
MÂ»rre<J Evening Bun.
The libel case of Claus Sprockets
against Andy Lawrence, managing
editor of the Examiner, is attract
ing 1 wide attention throughout the
State, and already numerous news
papers have indorsed the Exam
iner's contention that Lawrence
could not be guilty because he had
no knowledge of the article com
plained of until after it had been
published. The same argument
would, of course, apply to Mr.
Hearst himself, the owner of the
paper, if that gentleman had been
made the defendant instead of Mr.
Lawrence.
This brings us face to face with
the proposition whether or not
anybody is responsible for what
appears in a newspaper; and if
anybody is responsible, who is that
anybody?
It is manifestly unfair to presume
that the public is entirely at the
mercy of the newspapers; that a
newspaper can say what it pleases
of anybody, and then legally hide
behind the statement that some
employe wrote the article and pub
lished it without the knowledge of
the editor or proprietor. Suppose
a Southern Pacific train should
run over and kill a team of horses
belonging to Mr. Smith, and Smith
should bring suit for damages
against the company; what sort of
a defense would it be for the of
ficers of the company to go to the
stand and swear that it was the
fault of an employe â the engineer â
and that the killing of the horses
was done without their knowledge
and consent, and thnt, therefore,
Smith could not recover damages?
Could a sillier defense than that
be imagined? Yet it is exactly in
line with the contention of the Ex
aminer.
The owner of a newspaper should
be held morally and legally respon
sible for everyth.ng that goes into
its columns. And whether or not
he has knowledge of what goes In
his paper is his own lookout. If
his employes use poor judgment he
should pay for the result of that
poor judgment, just as he would
have accepted the profits that
might have resulted from the ex
ercise of better judgment.
FREE GARDEN SEEDS.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
As The Call Interests itself In the indus
tries of the Pacific Coast, I venture to
solicit its active influence in opposition
to a shameful waste of public funds by
the United States Government to the in-
Jury of one of these industries which de
serves rather to be fostered.
In the present state of trade the seed
industry of the Pacific Coast suffers more
than that of any other section of the
country from the foolish practice of the
United States Government in distributing
common seeds free of cost. I therefore
hope that you will be able at this time to
devote some attention to this growing
abuse in the columns of The Call. It
may not be necessary for me to indicate
to you what are the facts of the case
but stress may probably be laid upon the
fact that last year gUu.OUO whs spent in
this way for free seeds to be distributed
by the members of Congress in their re
spective districts and JTu.ooo additional in
the mailage of those seeds. This is
practically a waste of J2"0,w0 of public
money in one year which accomplishes no
appreciable quod, but acts as a serious
detriment to the combined industries of
seed-grpwing and seed-distribution. As
a wholesale distributor of Beeda over
most of the States of the Union. 1 know
that thousands of merchants complain
of the direct and indirect injury which
this thing does to their business in seeds.
It is well, of course, and a. public need
recognized by all new countries, that
Government should expend some money
upon the discovery and introduction of
new and valuable seeds and plants, and
no doubt the abuse of which I complain
grew out of that need in this country.
But at this time there is practically noth
ing done for the acclimatization of new
seeds and plants except by private busi
ness enterprise, and the money of the
Government expended upon seeds is
thrown away upon the distribution of the
commonest kinds of garden and flower
seeds. So far as I know. Government
distribution of seeds is .not practiced in
any other country in the world except in
times of famine and distress; and to
have it known all over the world that
the United States Government spends
money in this way is no compliment to a
country and people supposed to be pros
perous. Hoping you will take this mat
ter up for public exposure and censure,
I remain. Yours truly,
E. J. BOWENT.

And bullies he haJ chased.
And they that heard him boasting

With the feeling that his courage
AnÃ his might were truly vast.
He spoke and others trembled.
They let him have his way; ' '
Nobody dared to question
Aught that he had to pay.
As some anointed monarch
He held his lordly sway â
He spoke, and they that heard him
Rushed blindly to obey.
One flay there came a stranger.
Who knew not of the might.
The bravery, or prowess
Of this unconquered knight:
Who had not heard him boasting.
Who knew not of his fame.
Who did not even tremble
When he heard his awful name.
Somehow they met nnd quarreled
Kre the stranger knewâ
The man of might was humbled
When they finally got through.
And the stranger, when they told him
The truth, was fain to own
That he never could have licked him
If he'd happened to have known.

THE COMING CHARTER.
San Francisco, Jan. 16, ISS7.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: It was
with extreme pleasure that I listened last
Friday evening to President Jordan's ad
dress on "The Management of Cities."
It must have been a severe shock to
some rigid republicans who think that no
good can be found under a monarchy to
listen to Dr. Jordan's conclusion in favor
of the British system. 1 must say that
the Scotch system with which I am con
versant is far and away ahead of any
thing I have seen in American cities.
With your permission and for the bene
fit of many of your readers I will state
a few salient features in the municipal
government of the city of Edinburgh.
The city is divided into thirteen wards,
each of which returns three members to
the Town Council, ono retiring annually
in November. They elect one of their
number Lord Provost (or Mayor), who
presides at the meetings of Council,
whose term of office is three years. Tney
also elect six bailies or magistrates, who
must be councilors and who dispense
justice at police courts without fee or re
ward. They also elect one of their num
ber treasurer of the city. None of the
Council receives a salary, not even the
treasurer. An honorarium of $2500 is vot
ed to the Lord Provost at the end of each
year. Although the two members of
Council elected provost and treasurer may
have but one year to run, they do not
retire, but the next in rotation retires in
their place.
There are no park, police or fire com
missions. These departments are all
managed by committees of the council.
All the paid city servants are elected by
the entire Council.
You will see from the foregoing that
in barren little Scotland men rule in
Cities for honor, whereas in America men
rule for what there is in it. The spoil*
system is the bane of American munici
pal government.
It would be well for the citizens of San
Francisco to place themselves on record
in some tangible form that no charter
shall be satisfactory unless it places the
entire control of the city government in
the hands of the people.
Apologizing for taking up your valuable
space, I am yours truly,
D. K. ANDERSON.

YELLOW JOURNAL METHODS.
Los Banna. Cal., Jan. 10. 1898.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I
deslro to call to your attention a new ex
ample of yellow Journalism of a very
moan nature. The Examiner published
an article in the issue of December 27
under the heading:, "Dank Marshes May
Hide the Secret Crime." which was ut
terly untrue in every particular and did
great injustice to the people of L/OS Banos
and vicinity.
On Monday night, December 27. I wrote
to' the Examiner, calling Its attention to
the untruth and Injustice of the article,
and asking them to correct the same. No
attention whatever was paid to my letter,
not even to the extent of acknowledging
the receipt thereof.
Dissecting the article. !t Is found that
the amount of truth contained therein is
all in the two opening lines. Porter is
not believed to have been killed by mar
ket huntersâ nor by the people of Los
Banos, nor by the people of Fresno, for
I have talked with responsible citizens of
Fresno, who were well acquainted with
him, and they laughed at the idea.
Los Banos has never had 150 market
hunters, nor anywhere near it; twenty
five would come much nearer the truth.
The community is not greatly excited
over the big gun law of 1897, for that law
was enacted in 1593, and any excitement
it might have caused has had four years
to coul down.
Not one hunter in five uses or ever has
used a gun weighing thirty pounds, and
there is no law among them written, un
written or imaginary requiring them to
make but two shots per day or any other
number.
Sonic of them have oxen and some hive
not, but none of them wade out into the
marshes, for there are no places here
that could be properly called marshes.
The officers of Merced County have
made little or no effort to enforce this
law beyond warning the hunters of its
existence, and but one arrest has been
made under it since 1893.
No officer has been set upon and beaten
by the hunters, nor have they had a clash
of any kind whatsoever. On the con
trary, on December 11 one of the hunters,
acting under the advice of his attorney,
voluntarily surrendered himself into cus
tody end pleaded guilty in the Justice's
Court (my own) to the charge of using
a bi:,' gun. The case was begun for the
purpose of testing the validity of the law,
and is now isniier advisement by the
Jucisro of the Superior Court of Merced
County. Thus, by taking out the parts
that are utterly without truth or founda
tion we are left the matter contained in
the two opening lines â "that Porter hes
been missing since November." The hunt
ers of Los Banos are as law-abiding a
class of citizens as any other body, and
it is a shame that a yellow journal, with
out responsibility, apparently, should
spread broadcast such charges, Injuring
these people and the community In which
they live, and then â worst of all â refusing
to retract its statements when it is
shown to be in the wrong. Yours truly,
C. F. BERTHOLF.

AX FRAXCTSCO will find her new ferry
depot worth having waited for, when

dirty, oM-fashioned, grimy room, all the
priors of visitors und the complaints
of residents, will be forgotten In the
pleasure of taking possession of the
commodious, well-arranged structure at
the foot of Market street, which is one
of the finest of its kind In the world.
The impression produced by the new
ferry building is at once an effect of
lightness and of strength. It is steel
gied throughout, fireproof of course,
no wood has b^on used In its con
ction except in window sashes and
-s. It se< ms to have been made of
steel and glass, bo enduring and so well
lighted it looks.
From north to south the ferry build
ing measures C 56 feet. Its width is
about one-quarter its length, except
where the great central tower strides
in advance of the main building.
This tower measures 275 feet to the ball
of the flagstaff, and contains a winding
staircase, which nimble-footed view
hunters may climb to look upon the bay
ringed round with cities. The main
building consists of two lofty stories
and a mezzanine story above. The walls
are of galvanized iron, the roof of cor
rugated iron, and th* pale gray gree.n
stone from Colusa'fl quarries covers the
unlovely skeleton.
Behind the. gr-vit, ugly fence which is
scion to be torn down, and the old post

old temporary sidewalk. Twelve feet
below this, though, planks are to be

sand topped by a steol support, over
which the new concrete sidewalk is to
be laid. It will bo twenty feet broad.

lowest floor will b*Â» the North Pacific
company's bappnge and waiting room.
N> \t will com. 1 the San Francisco and
North Pacific Toast baggage and wait
ing room. Wells, Fargo & Co. have
space 2 s : by 4." feet for their office, which
will relieve the present office on New
Montgomery st-eet Immediately at the left of the main entrance is the post
office department But the space on the ground floor is not all that is given to
Uncle Barn's malls In the new ferry building. Up on the second floor there are
other quarters, making 13.^0 square feot In all taken up in the collection and
distribution of mail. Behind the main entrance, which is flanked by two intpos
lng double stairways twenty-five feet wide. Is the elevator to be used In the post
office department.
The arrangement to the right of the main entrance is similar to that on the
left The Pout hern Pacific waiting rooms come first, occupying a space 145 by
100 feet. To the right is the South Pacific Coast's department, nearly half as
large, and at the south end Is the Southern Pacific's baggage rooms, as large as
Its neighbor.
The ground floor of the new depot Is strictly business. When one mounts the
broad iron staircase and reaches the second floor, though, he finds as much that
is beautiful here as was merely useful tx
The Grand Nave, which Is a corridor CG6 feet long and 45 feet wide, is the
atonement the Harbor Commissioners have made to San Francisco for the old
ferry waiting room. It's a beautiful corridor, arched above with graceful dark
green iron curves belnw a skylight 14 feet wide, the entire length of the building.
Besides, there are broad, large arcades all along, and above clerestory windows.
Thr. place Is delightfully light and airy and graceful. The floor, 40.0tÂ«J feet square,
â will be paved in random mosaic with a two-foot border of red marble. But it Is
the walls that you'll want to look at. lined with pearly Tennessee marble to a
height of 12 feet 3 inches, above which the buff brick and terra cotta are
used. The walls are so arranged that six panels of marble fill the space
on each division. Each of these panels, 4 feet by 9in height, is a pure, solid block
of marble. And each of the divisions is so matched that various effects, all
beautiful. havo been produced. On one wall the rosy stains of the marble have
been fitted so that alternate panels of pink and pale gray occur. On another
â wall all the flecks have a slanting direction; on another a zigzag. The whole is
a beautiful piece of architecture, and the satisfied eye looks along the dark green
arches, one beyond the other, surmounting this marble wall, culminating in the
great wlrdow at either end.
Only brass signs, specially designed by the architect, will be permitted in this
marble hall, so that nothing- may detract from its lofty beauty. At night it will
be lighted by brass incandescent lamps Jr.tting out from the cornice of each pillar
and from f-ach depression of the glass and steel arched ceiling great arc lights
will depend.
Beyond this corridor Is the real waiting room, -which will be fitted up with
wooden settees like those in use on the Piedmont. Bronze grill partitions will
divide up this great hall, so that the beauty of Us proportions will not be con
cealed. Here are ticket officesâ for one may purchase tickets upstairs or down,
and after he has purchased them go up or down as he pleases before going on the
boat â and lavatories; these on the upper floor only for women.
Rolling wooden shutters ten feet wide separate these halls. The weights at
tached to these are so finely balanced that a man can easily lift these flexible
doors, which fold up into the cornice above. This middle hall is finlshea off in
Oregon pine, finely polished.
After you have bought your ticket you pass on into the third hallway, which
Is painted a soft, warm cream tone and then sanded over. This rear gallery will
be provided with movable partitions, by means of which the sheep-like crowds of
ferry passengers will be steered in the way they should go. Bridges which divide
and lead in two directions, thus connecting with two boats. Just out from this
last corridor to join the upper decks of waiting steamers. Special aprons de
signed by the chief engineer, which are supported by rams in the middle, connect
with the ordinary apron. The two outer corridors have cement floors.
The heating of the entire, building by steam and an elaborate conduit system
of electric lighting complete the arrangements made for the comfort of those
who come to and those who leave San Francisco.
The front part of the second story is given up to offices. It is buflt of hollow
terra cotta J'.reproof tile. There are four private offices for the Harbor Commis
sioners at the southerly end, a nine-windowed meeting room, a room for the
filing of documents, an office and a private office besides for the secretary. The
chief engineer has a sampling and testing room, a draughting room and a pri
vate office.
In the middle of the building is a small public hall lighted by three large win
dows. The third of these will bo changed into an entrance for the elevated way
for pedestrians, when the bridge shall be built from the corner of East and Sac
ramento streets. By means of this elevated road one may avolfl all the bustling
and confusion of tho ferry, and calmly wend his lofty way upon a path which no
clanging streetcar bell, no nerve-racking shout of profane driver, may disputo
with him.
The north end of the second floor Is given up to the postofflce. Here Is room
for thirty-two clerks to sort out mail. Here is the carriers' room, the stamp
windows, the office of the superintendent of Station D, and a room for the public
to address its letters and post them at the last moment before the boat leaves
the slip.
The mezzanine rtory is divided between the exhibit of the Mining Bureau
Which will occupy the north end. and that of the Board of Trade on the south.
The clock in the ferry tower will Lave one of the largest dials in the world.
It Is the largest in America, but there's a church in Belgium which has a. dial
nearly twice as large as this. Our fr>rry clock, which will move eerenely, pitiless
ly on while tiny daily parodies on the old tragedy "Too Late!" are being enacted
beneath its Impassive face, will !,e plÃced at a height of 114 feet. Its outer dial is
twenty-two feet in diameter; tho diameter of the inner dial, which will be illu
minated at night, is just twice the length of a six-footer. The numerals on the
inner dial will not be visible by day, as They're on the inside of the dial.
One thing about this ferry clock which will commend It to short-sighted peo
ple and those who wish to know the worst, while still there may be time to rem
edy it and catch an elusive boat, is this: The hands of this clock are large, the
numerals are only of secondary importance. The minute hand is 11 reet long,
the hour hand 7 feet 6 inches.
"Time when read from a distance," says the architect, "is told by the posi
tion of the hands in the circle, the individual character of the letters having no
significance except as spots which divide the circle into twelve parts. At a great
distance the position of the hands could be more readily distinguished if there
were no characters whatever."
Every seven days this great clock will have to be wound. A crank is fitted
to the axle- of the great wheel, and a special arrangement called the maintaining
power kepps the clock going during the Jive minutes it takes the giant husband
man at the ferry to wind his great <
Within a week or two, now, the disliyuring debris which spoils the approach
to the new depot will be carted away. Postofflce Station L> will disappear, un
wept, unsung. J'.;:t if the Harbor Commissioners invite you to be present at their
grand housr-warming on April 1, it would be advisable to consider such an invita
tion as a joke befitting the time. However, if you're traveling on the Ist of May
half the disagreeables of your trip will be forgotten in the comfort and the pleas
urable impression you'll receive on starting out from or arriving at a ferry
depot so well-; finely built, and such a delightful contrast to the old
one we've borne with and suffered from and grumbled at so long.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1898.
WILL SOON BE FINISHED.
IN THE GRAND NAVE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW FERRY DEPOT.
POLICE COURT
BUGABOO AGAIN
Constitutionality of the
Courts Brought in
Question.
Ex-Judge Murphy Raises the
Point in a Case Before
Judge Low.
If the Defendant Is Held to Answer the
Supreme Court Will L-lkely
Be Appealed To.
The bugaboo of the constitutionality
of Police Courts 2, 3 and 4 will not down
and it cropped up again yesterday.
On the last occasion it was to have
been tested before the Supreme Court
In the case of Sidney Kellett, who had
been convicted and sentenced by Judge
Low for having burglars' tools in his
possession. Judge Low had instructed
the Sheriff not to recognise an order
for Kellett's release issued by Judge
Campbell, who had accepted Kellett's
bond on appeal. The matter was taken
before Judge Carroll Cook, who decided
that the committing magistrate could
only accept a bond on appeal and K.'l
lett's attorney took the case to the Su
preme Court.
At that time Attorney Lemon was to
argue tho unconstitutionally of the
courts, but Judge Low for.-stalled him
by indorsing th-- order of discharge Is
sued by Judge Campbell, and the buga
boo was once more removed.
It looks ominous again. Yesterday
Judge Low refused to trn I
a case in which Mrs. Louise
Kersten Is defendant. The at
torneys for the defense had asked for
a change <>f venue, but the Judge held
that under the law he could not trans
fer the case upon a mere allegation of
prejudice. Was on the part of the court
had b<--en alleged, because of th^ Judg
ment recently rendered, holding Cro
ner, the woman's associate, to answer
before the Superior Court.
When the clerk of the court asked
Mrs. Kenti n to stand up for arraign
ment ex-Judge Murphy, one of her at
torneys, made n motion to the effect
that the Judge was not in a position to
try the case as committing magistrate,
from the fart that the police court*
were unconstitutional, being establish
ed by sperial legislation. The Judge
promptly dismissed the motion and the
case went on.
It is now in the record that the un
constitutionality of the court has been
called in question and if the Judge
should decide upon holding the defend
ant to answer before the Superior
Court the probability is that ex-Judge
Murphy will test the question before
the Supreme Court.
Judge Low, as well as Judges Con
lan and Joachimsen believe that the
constitutionality of the courts cannot
be called in question, but it is consid
ered better that the matter should be
settled â¢ definitely without unnecessary
delay by the highest court.
IS THE BRIDE OF
A POSTMASTER.
Nuptials of Jake Golinsky
and Miss Flora Rich.
Jake Golinsky, the popular young post
master of Keswick, Shasta County, nnd
Miss Flora Rich, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. I-. Rich, were married last evening
at 8 o'clock at the home of the bride's pa
rents, 044 Turk street.
Although it was an extremely qui^t
wfdiiing, only the relatives of the con
tracting parties being present, elaborate
preparations were made for the affair.
The parlors were bright with roses, car
nations and violets. The bay window of
the drawing-room was converted into a
floral bower, and there, standing under a
bell of pink and white roses. Rev. Dr.
Voorsanger pronounced the young couple
man and wife.
The bride was attended by her little
nieces. Miss Flora Stern, who officiated as
maid of honor, and Miss Rose Franken
berg, who acted as bridesmaid. S. Simon
was best man and the little Misses Clar-
Isso Marx. Alma Dlttenhoefer, Marlon
Dlttenhoefer and Amy Marx led the
bridal procession, strewing fragrant blos
soms along the bridal path.
The bride wore a dainty toilette of white
organdie over white taffeta. The over
dress was trimmed with alternate tiny
tucks and rows of Valenciennes Insertions.
At the hem of the skirt was a border of
orange blossoms, caught at regular inter
vals with white satin rosettes. A veil and
orange blossoms completed the modish
costume.
Mi. Flora Stern and Miss Frankenberg
were attired alike- In white chiffon over
White silk. The little flower girls wore
pretty gowns of white chiffon over pale
blue.
Mrs. Gollnsky, mother of the groom,
who on this occasion also celebrated the
twenty-seventh anniversary of her wed
ding, wore a magnificent black velvet
gown, the corsage of which was trimmed
with duchease lace.
Mrs. Rich, mother of the bride, was at
tired in black brocaded Bilk, trimmed with
rare old lace.
Mr. and Mrs. Gollnsky will go to-day to
Del Monte for a short stay, and then re
turn for â  few days previous to leaving
for their future home In Keswick.

TO EMPLOY UNEMPLOYED.
A Proposition for Permanent Re
lief Suggested to the Board '
of freeholders.
A meeting: of the executive committee
of the unemployed men and women of
this city was held at 310 O'Farrell stret
last night, and the following petition to
the new Board of Freeholders was form-
ulated and unanimously adopted:
To the Honorable the Board of Freeholder*
to frame a charter fur San Francisco: We.
the unemployed, respectfully petition your
beard to make provision in the charter of
San Francisco for the public employment of
the unemployed, and we show that the condi
tion of Industry 'â¢ such that the number of
operatives required to produce products of all
kinds by the use of machinery and modern in
vention leaves constantly an ever increasing
number of persons unable to obtain employ
ment by reason of which the ability to con
sume goods and products In diminished, and
that these causes lead rapidly to the produc
tion of more goods than can be sold at a
profit, and this In turn" throws more men out
of employment and thus panics are . frequently
produced, and the question of unemployed la
bor Is therefore the most serious question of
the age; and we further show to your board
that the poor who have nothing but their
hands with which to work. If denied the op
portunity to work must of necessity starve,
and we therefore insist that to deprive men
of the right to work deprives them of their
life; and we further show to your board that
the number of the unemployed constantly In
creases and In this city many times has been
very great, and Is now on the increase, and
that this city has found it necessary to at
tempt to relieve this condition heretofore by
obtaining private subscriptions to raise money
to put the unemployed to work and that such
method of relief has proved entirely inade
quate: and we -further show to your board
that it is not Just that funds to employ the
unemployed should bo raised by an irregular
manner, and demands made upon certain Indi
viduals, but that the same ought to be" raised
by taxation equitably and lawfully laid, and In
some sufficient- and genuine relief; anil we
further show to your board that public works
cf many different natures In the city and
county of San Francisco are required and that
public moneys may be expended in the em
ployment of the unemployed at all times when
private employment shall fall with benefit to
the tax-payers and inhabitants of said city.
We therefore ask that you place In sala
charter a section or provision substantially as
follows:
Section â . There Fhall be Inserted In the
regular annual tax levy for said city and coun
ty each year the item of three hundred thou
sand dollars, which amount shall be laid,
levied and collected by Bald annual tax levy
as and for a specific emergency fund for trie
purpose of employing the unemployed upon
public works of said city and county, in sucli
manner and under such rules and regulations
as shall be prescribed by the Board of Super
visors of said city and county, provided al
ways that no person shall be so employed who
had not been at least six months continuously
next immediately preceding his employment
a bona fide resident and Inhabitant In said city
and county.

K. J. corhktt. Secretary,
K. W. TIIURMAN,
Committee.
Other business consisted of the election
of K. \V. Thurman as a member of the
committee to fill a vacancy and the con
sideration of a proposition to secure per
manent headquarters. A committee was
appointed to look after suitable rooms,
and the meeting adjourned to the call of
the chair.
FOR CRUELTY TO A HORSE.
rierjry Hauser Arrested for Beat-
ing a Poor Beast Tf)at Could
Hardly Walk-
Henry Hanser was arrested for rruplty
to animals l>y Otttcers W. T. Hooper and
M. Miiurrie of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals. James
Hawkins, a member of The society, saw
Hawser leading a horse that could hardly
walk behind a peddlers' cart on Spear
street, near Market. He notified the peo
ple at the pound, who made the arrest.
The horse whs found to be very old and
one of his hips was broken. When the
officers arrived on the scene the poor
beast was actually leaning up ap.iinst the
wagon to hold Itself up. The condition of
the animal as it was driven up the street
attracted the attention of a number of
people and the cries of "shame" were nu
merous. The horse was so badly injured
that the officers had to shoot him.
From the owner it was learned by the
officers that the animal had been sold to
1 > A. Kenyon, who runs a green bone mill
at Petalurha. and was being taken to the
wharf for shipment when the officers took
charge of him. Kenyon, according to the
officers, comes to the city once a week to
buy up all the decrepit horses he can. and
then ships them to his mill where they
are killed and pround Into chicken feed.
The society has warned him before not to
have the "f*nimals driven through the
street and is determined to put a stop to
it Some of the animals sold Kenyon are
said to be in a worse condition than the
one killed yesterday, and many of them
die on the "boat before they reach Peta
luma. As low as thirty-five cents is the
price Kenyon pays for some of the horses.
RAILROAD-CAR THIEVES.
Three of Then) Chased, but Es
cape. Leaving Their Plunder
in a Wagon.
Ahout two weeks ago a car of the
Southern Pacific was broken open and a
large quantity of brass Joinings was
stolen. Since then the detectives of the
company have been looking for the
tllieV. H.
Special Officer Lewin was driving: along
First street yesterday morning when he
and Soe are well known to the police and
past him with a lot of the stolen brass
I< linings in the wagon. Lewin gave chase
and the thieves Jumped from the wagon
and made their escape. Lewin took pos
session of the rig and drove with It to
the t'ity Hall. It was shortly afterward
claimed by A. P. Hanson, a livery stable
keeper >>n ' nrannan street, between Sixth
and Seventh.
Th<> three thieves, Abbott, Anglesey
and Coe are well-known to the police and
warrant! were issued for their arrest.
tives Ryan and ODea were detailed
to help Lewin in capturing them.

In Favor of Honest Illiteracy.

SAX FRANCISCO. Jan. 17, IS9S.â Hon.
Stephen M. White, United State 3 Senator,
Washington, D. C. : On behalf of the Italian
and other illiterate Immigrants I appeal to you
and to all friendly Senators to oppose the Im
migrant bill before the Senate, It being
against the policy of our institutions. Let the
Bag which proclaims liberty and freedom to
the world not be stained by a measure which
If It should be enacted would contradict the
glorious principles of our forefathers and the
example set by Columbus. There is plenty
place in the region of this T.'nton west of the
Missouri River where immigration Is abso
lutely needed. These illiterate immigrants are
a hardworking, enterprising, good people, con
sumers and who help to build up our country.
They seek no office and none of them occupy
our penitentiaries as forgers, counterfeiters,
swindlers, etc. Kindly submitted.

A FEW GOOD POINTS.
K7"That a person in perfect health,
rarely catches a cold. It is only when
the system is run down and the blood
does not circulate properly that people
fall victims to colds.
IC That it is a bad sign to feel weak
and shivery and to constantly suffer
from tired, miserable feelings. If you
do not eat well, work well and sleep
well, there is evidently a weak spot in
your system.
â¢c That ordinary food and drink can
not supply the great vital force re
quired by people who work hard with
their hands and brains. They need
something to stimulate their energies,
promote digestion and keep the blood
moving. There is nothing better for this
purpose than pure malt whiskey.
E7 That there is only one really me
dicinal whiskey and that Is Duffy's pure
malt. It is not an ordinary whiskey, but
a pure stimulant that has a wonderful
effect on the system. It stirs up the
sluggish blood, builds up the health,
creates a good appetite and promotes
digestion. It prevents and will cure
coughs, colds, chills, and even pneumo
nia. Every reliable grocer and druggist
keeps it. Beware of inferior imita
tions. Remember there is no other
whiskey like Duffy's and no other that
can possibly take its place.

THE Jubilee colors have been flung
to the winds, Rnd yesterday for
the first time the city breezes
played with gorgeous banners of
yellow and gold.
Decorators Commenced work
at an early hour yesterday morning, and
before noon they had given Market street
a most festal appearance. As far to the
westward as Kearny street the brilliant
Tbuntlngs flapped and fluttered, and they
eeemed to lend to what sunshine there
â was what little -warmth It contained.
By Friday all the decorations will be in
jtlai-o. and then the streets will be gay
Indeed. Out Market street from the ferry
to Van Ness avenue, down all the side
streets from Market to Mission, a.nd from
Second to Eleventh; over Montgomery, as
far as the lino of march shall lead and
back again over Kearoy; up one block on
every street that runs west from Market,
and out one block on every one that runs
north â tliat Is t^e plan as outlined; the
yellow and poiri will bfl the burden of it
all, as It Is on the main thoroughfare, but
the national colors will have the place of
honor through it all.
The Jubilee fever has even seized John
Chinaman, for he, too, is busy with his
division of the parade â arranging orders
of march, choosing regalia and designing
floats, and even going to the extent of
electing marshals and aides, for John
Chinaman is going to run outside the tra
ditions of his race for this once, and he
will sacrifice two of his cousins In order
that the Grand Marshal shall h/ive
mounted Chinese for his aides from their
division.
The organization having charge of the
Chinese, division is known as the United
Parlor of the Native Sons of the GoKien
Ftate. There will l>e two floats in their
peotlon, and various characters in the his
tory of China will he portrayed by suit
ably costumed Celestials; every man In
the Chinese section will carry a banner or
Instrument or weapon of 8 I
The parade committee has been annoyed
by a report to the effect that the Mu
sicians' Union had a grievance against it
for not adhering to union rates. It was
eald, too, that the musicians had forced
up the price of bands for the day from $5
a man to $7 a man. This has not been the
case. The rules of the union were looked
up for three years back and it was found
that $7 a day for each man has always
been the rate, and that there had been no
forcing of the prices. There has been no
attempt on the part of the committee to
antagonize the union In any way, and in
hiring bands it has hired all the union or
ganizations it could find.
Out at the Pavilion all is activity. The
MORE PROOF
RAESIDE WAS
MURDERED
Coroner Baldwin Still
Probing the Shell
Mound Mystery.
A Significant Verdict Is
Brought In by the
Coroner's Jury.
Many Facts to Prove the Horse
man Was Not Killed by
the Train.
AWAKENED BY A SCREAM.
Statement of â¢ Resident of the Neigh
borhood â Made a Big Winning
That. Day.
Murdered for the winnings he had
â¢yron that day at the Oakland race track
and his body cast upon the track of the
West Berkeley train to divert suspi
cion.
Evidence Is accumulating that such
â was the fate of Joseph H. Raeside, the
horseman, at Shell Mound last Thurs
day night. That the Coroner's Jury,
Impaneled by Coroner Baldwin of Ala
meda County, Inclined to this belief Is
shown by the verdict returned by them
last night, to the effect "that death was
caused in some manner unknown."
When the unfortunate man's re
mains were first picked up it was the
opinion of the railroad men that he
had thrown himself in front of the lo
comotive with suicidal intent, but this
belief was dissipated as soon as the
Coroner and his assistants began an
Investigation. Their first inquiries
tended to show that Raeside had stum
bled onto the track while intoxicated,
but the deeper the tragedy was probed
the more firmly convinced Coroner
Baldwin became that the man was the
victim of thugs, and finally he called
upon the police authorities for assist
ance. Detectives Holland and Herbert
were detailed on the case, and they,
too, express themselves as satisfied
that murder has been committed.
There are many circumstances tend
ing to substantiate this view. Raeside
was known to have made a large win
ning on Ricardo at 30 and 40 to 1 that
day, the first of any consequence for a
long time.
Shortly after 9 o'clock that night he
was seen by an acquaintance in this
city, apparently sober, hurrying along
Kearny street toward Market, evident
ly to board a car for the ferry. Then a
brakeman on the Berkeley train re
members a man who tallies with Rae-
Blde's description get off at Shell Mound
about 10:40 o'clock. The brakeman
says the person he saw may have been
slightly under the influence of liquor,
but was by no means intoxicated.
But there are other things which
were brought out at the inquest last
"leht, and the Alameda County au

thorlties will sift the matter to the bot
tom.
Raeside has been a familiar figure on
the local tracks for some time. He
was a Scotchman by birth, and at one
time was possessed of considerable
funds, but of late he has been at the
bottom of the ladder, and finally was
compelled to accept a position as rub
ber for Capp, the owner of Ricardo.
That Raeside was well connected wns
shown by his speech and manners. He
was also a thirty-second degree Mason
and a Knight Templar, being a mem
ber of the Waukeegan, 111., ("ommand
ery, which body has ordered a thor
ough investigation into the cause of his
death. The same authority ordered the
remains shipped to that place Sunday
night for burial.
Coroner Baldwin has traced with
considerable accuracy the movements
of Raeside on the day of his doath. It
is known positively that he won
something like $1200 on the races that
day, and after finishing his work at
the track went to Oakland and after
ward came to this city.
Some of his movements wer.e told to
the Coroner's jury at Saturday night's
hearing, but new and important evi
dence was brought out last night.
James Collins, a barkeeper at Earl's
saloon on Thirteenth street, near
Washington, testified that Raeside
went into his place about ten days ago
and called for a drink, placing a dime
on the bar in payment. Collins knew
Raeside was not flush with money,
and told him to have a drink with the
Switch at Shell Mound Where Raeside's Body Was Found.

It !s expected to be possible to open the

and if that be so an admission fee of 10

may wish to see how things are made
ready for a great exposition.
Arrangements for the military games
to be given at Central Park are progress
ing rapidly and a most successful meet
is promised. The events will be mostly
composed of those peculiar to military
tournaments, and each of these has a
distinct value as a means of Instruction
to the soldier as well as being an Interest-
Ing contest to witness. Among the events
will be a wall scaling contest, in which
the prize will go to that squad which first
pÂ»ts its five men over a wall ten feet
high, the men to fire twenty-five shots at
an Imaginary enemy while going over.
Another event is a shoe race, where each
man is separated from his shoes by fifty
yards, and then after the shoes of all the
men in the race have been thoroughly
mixed the men are started. They must
find their own shoes, put them on and he
wins who first reaches the scratch again
with his shoes properly laced and neatly
tied. A feature which adds interest to
the event Is that any man who picks up
the wrong shoe is at liberty to throw It
as far away from him as he can. There
will also be a hasty entrenchment race,
in which each man will be given five min
utes to entrench himself, the man mak
ing the best cover to win.
The managers of the flower market
have progressed as far as the appointing
of two judge* to pass upon the flowers
which will bloom in Union Square. The
Judge* chosen are Mayor Phelan and
John McLaren, superintendent of the
park; there will be three other Judges
appointed, but the exhibitors will be con
sulted before they will be named. It has
been decided to offer live prizes ranging
from $.">0 downward, and this number will
be increased if the executive committee
can spare the money. The square will be
brilliantly lighted during the evenings,
and a fine canvas awning will be erect
ed ;i round the big flag pole in the center
of the square to protect the exhibitors
house. Thursday evening about 6
o'clock Raeside again visited the sa
loon nnrl said to Collins: "I don't for
get a favor, it's your turn to drink
with me." He told Collins he had
made a good winning that day, in
proof of which he displayed $10 or $12
in silver and about |$0 in sold. He
stated that h u warn coming to San
Francisco to pay a bill of $10 he owed,
and promised the barkeeper to let him
in on a "good thing" at the tra^k In a
few days. "1 have taken a liking to
you." said Raeside, "and I will give
you a good thing next week. lam no
tout and only try to help my friends
out."
He said further that he had left |M 0
with the bookmakers, that he never
took his money away and never let
the touts know he had any, for some of
them would rob a man for 60 cents.
i '"llins said liaeside had taken a few
drinks, but was by no means intoxi
cated. He left the saloon at 7:10
o'clock to catch the train for San Fran
cis"D.
Dr. Porter was recalled and testified
that from measurements he had taken
of the body he judged Raeside to have
been 5 feet 9 or 10 inches in height.
He had also measured the space be
tween the rails of a standard-gauge
track, and it was his opinion that the
body had lain across the rails and the
wheels had passed" over his head and
the legs below the knees. The broken
ribs he accounted for by the body be
ing caught and rolled under the en
gine.

The trainmen were called to grive
pome further evidence, and then the
jury brought In the following verdict:
"We, the jury, do find that the name of
the deceased was Joseph H. Uaeside, a
native of Scotland, aged about #3 years,
and that he came to tils death at Shell
Mound â  station, * Emeryville, Alameda
County, <".il.. at some time between 10:40
and 11 lock p. m. January 13, IK'S, and
that death was caused in some manner
unknown to this jury.
A Call reporter, accompanied by an
artist, made a careful inspection of the
scene of the tragedy yesterday, and
picked up one bit of information which
had been overlooked by the officers.
I-i ss than 200 feet from the spot where
Haesi'it : body was found lives an old
man named Holland. He stated that
sometime between 10 and 11 o'clock last
Thursday night he was awakened by a
piercing scream. He got out of bed,
but heard nothing more and went back
to bed. All the trainmen declare they
heard no sound, so it may be that the
shriek Holland heard was uttered by
Raeside when attacked by robbers.
The West Berkeley train runs on to
a side track in coming into Shell
Mound station. The engine is un
coupled and runs ahead onto the main
track again, then backs down to the
switch it first came on and back to
the single car It draws. This occupies
loss than two minutes, and when it
first ran on to the switch Thursday
night nothing was to be seen of Rae-
Btde. When it came back the second
time the man was lying on the track.
The engineer tried to stop his engine,
but could not do so in time and the
wheels severed the head from the body
and cut off the legs. On the east Bide
of the track there is a fence extending
t<>u;ird the station fully 100 feet be
yond where the body lay, and it would
be hardly possible for a drunken man
to walk that far before the engine re
turned. There would be ample time,
however, to throw the body over the
fence and place it across the track and
for the murderers to Jump back over
the fence and out of sight.
Raeside slept at the race track near
the gate opposite Shell Mound, so that
is where he would get off the train.
He would have no business near the
Wrst Berkeley track and certainly
none where he was run over.
If he was murdered the assassins
planned their work so carefully that
it Is doubtful if they will ever be
brought to Justice.
WERE CAPTURED
VERY CLEVERLY
Notorious Burglars Arrested
Last Evening by Offi
cer Thompson.
Two notorious burglars, recognized as
Frank Mitchell and Sidney Kellett. were
arrested by Officer K. J. Thompson late
last evening on Howard street, near
Twelfth. While standing at Mission and
Fifteenth streets Thompson saw the two
men, who were acting in a peculiar man
ner, and followed them to the place
where they were arrested. Kellett was
placed on the detention book at the
Seventeenth Street Police Station and
Mitchell was charged with carrying
burglars' tools. Mitchell was in posses
sion of a jimmy and several articles of
Jewelry, supposed to have been stolen
WÂ«re in K.llett's possession.
Kellett la at the present time out on
bonds, pending an appeal on a one year's
sentence for carying concealed weapons,
and he is well known by the police as a
desperate character. Mitchell and Kel
lett have been closely watched for several
days past and the captur* Is supposed to
be clever as well as fortunate for the
residents In the Mission. While the men
were passing down the street they were
evidently taking notes of the lay of the
land, as they stopped for a short time in
front of each house on the trip.

FIRE-PROOF WOOD
YET TO BE USED
Secretary Long Directs That
Battle-Ships Be Built Ac
cording to Contract.
This Material to Be Employed In Joiner
Work, as Provided, in the-
Specifications.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 17.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long has directed that the specifications
for the construction of the battleships
K'-arsarge, Kentucky, Alabama, Wiscon
sin and Illinois, providing for the build-
Ing of the joiner work with fire-proof
wood be carried out. This comprises over
two-thirds of the woodwork in the ves
sels named.
The Secretary says that after a careful
consideration of the advantages derived
from the use of electro fire-proof wood
on naval vessels it is decided that no
electro fire-proof wood shall be hereafter
used for the decking of naval vessels, as
the advantages that might be derived
from the use of such wood are incommen
surate with the cost of the same, and
that its use on torpedo-boats now under
construction be discontinued, as there is
so little woodwork on them, but that
electro fire-proof wood shall be used in
all joiner work of the new battleships as
provided in the specifications accompany
ing the contract, therefor, as the advan
tages to be derived from its use for such
purposes would seem to justify the in
creased cost incident thereto.
It was officially announced at the Navy
Department to-day that Civil Engineer A.
G. Menocal had been ordered to return
to New York and report his arrival to
the department by telegraph. It is ex
pected at the department that Menocal
will return to the United States within
the next ten days.
Chief Engineer Kirby has been trans
ferred from the Baltimore to the hospital
in San Francisco.
THE CONGREGATION
THROWN INTO PANIC.
A Prankish Boy, Dressed as the Devil, Plays
a Trick that May Hare Serious
Results.
CHICAGO, Jan. 17.â A special to the
Times-Herald from Bourbon, Ind., says:
Rev. Mr. Akin, pastor of the flock of
Bethel Church, on Sunday took for his
theme "His Satanic Majesty." He Is an
eloquent man and he painted the arch
fiend In vivid colors. At the climax of
the description a being dressed to repre
sent the devil, with large head and
switching tail, ambled up the aisle, blow
ing smoke from his nostrils and bellow
ing:
â¢1 am the devil and I want all of you."
The audience became panic-stricken.
Men, women and children were hurled to
the floor and trampled upon In the mad
rush for the door. In the confusion the
stove was upset and the building caugnt
fire. Before the horrified members had
regained their senses the fire had made
such headway that all attempts to save
the church were In vain.
This morning George Akin, eon of the
pastor, confessed that he. in company
with other boys, rigged up a devil suit,
and knowing the subject of his father's
sermon concealed himself behind a chair
and awaited the arrival of the audience.

to advance prices, as no more goods were
to be had on the coast at less than 3
cents f. o. b. for Santa Clara fruit, and
the stock of northern and southern
prunes was closely controlled by specu
lators. The feeling in lemons is steady,
owing to the comparatively small quan
tity of Sicily fruit on the spot and to
arrive, but, while the tendency of prices
on the latter is upward, rather free of
ferings of California fruit in the inferior
markets at comparatively low figures

lers, however, are confident and look for
better figures during the coming week.
Jamaica oranges are quiet, but prices are
maintained. Florida oranges are in
small stock and in few hands. The mar
ket is firm, but we hear of little demand.
Valencia oranges are ebout out of mar
ket, and, so far as we can learn, there
is nothing to arrive near due. Spot prices
are nominal and unchanged.
CHARLES M. SHORTRIDGE'S
CONDITION IMPROVED.
Slight Change for the Better Warrants the
Hope That He May Yet
Recover.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 17.â The condition of
Charles M. Shortridge to-day was consid
ered critical, and at one time during the
afternoon it was the opinion of the at
tending physicians that he had but a few
hours to live. During the evening his
condition changed for the better, and a
telephone message received from Gilroy
Hot Springs at midnight stated that his
improvement was such as to warrant
some hope of his recovery.
Mrs. Clara S. Foltz, a sister of Mr.
Shortridge, arrived in San Jose from New
York this evening, and, accompanied by
her son, David M. Foltz, has left for Gil
roy.

HENDERSON, THE BOY
MURDERER, COMMITTED.
His Father Believes Him Guilty, but Pleads
That His Mind Has Been Deranged
by Typhoid Fever.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 17. â Samuel
Henderson, the 15-year-old boy v/ho is
charged with the murder of 5-year-old
Percy Lockyar, was committed to prison
to-day by Magistrate Johnson to await
the action of the Coroner. There seema
little doubt now that Henderson brutally
hacked the boy to pieces, and, before Ufa
was extinct, threw him in Reddles Creek
and weighted the child down with heavy
stones. To-day's hearing was not with
out its sad scenes. Tae boy, armarently
unconscious of the extent of his crime,
stared stolidly at the magistrate, while
his father knelt by his side and wept over
and caressed his boy. Mr. Henderson be
lieves his boy guilty, but asserts that ha
is not in his right mind. Samuel had an
attack of typhoid fever some years ago
and his father maintains that ha haa
acted strangely ever since.

The Construction of a New City and

Rushed.
"You He, you scoundrel, you lip,"
hissed Supervisor CHnton at Super
visor Britt as he shook his finger under
the nose of the representative from the
Ninth Ward at the meeting of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday.
Britt struggled in the embrace of
Supervisor Smith, blind with rage and
swiping the air with his fists in an en
deavor to get at the man who de
nounced his veracity and turned the
meeting room of the fathers of the
municipal government into a prize
ring. Smith held fast to the angry
Supervisor and averted bloodshed.
Both men were forced into their chairs
and for the rest of the meeting the two
men sat glaring at each other.
The dispute arose over a resolution
that had been introduced providing for i
a. survey of the tract it is contem- i
plated to purchase for the proposed J
Mission Park and Zoo. Supervisor
Clinton, when the resolution was pre- '
sented, took occasion to resent some j
allusions that had been made concern
ing him in a daily paper, and in main
taining his position he said he believed |
that the project to purchase the tract ,
of land for the Mission Park was a job. :
"I walked over the land offered," he
said, "and in my opinion I do not
think it is worth over $150,000, and 1
repeat it is a job when it is tried to be
foisted on the city for $360,000. Our in
digent sick are suffering for the want
of covering at the shack known as the
City and County Hospital, and why
should we establish a zoo and take
care of a lot of monkeys when our own
kind are suffering? I have been ap
proached by persons at the instigation
of members of this board with induce
ments to favor the purchase of the
land offered for the park, and because j
I have refused to sell myself I have
been referred to by some of them in a
very ungentlemanly way. My record j
has, been attacked. I -will place my
record alongside that of theirs, and I
can assure you that mine will not suf
fer by It. I could mention a name in
r this matter and the person would hang
his head In shame."
"Nothing he can say will make me
hang my head in shame," shouted
Supervisor Delany, as he Jumped to
his feet and shook his fist at Clinton
from across the room.
"Do not indulge in personalities,"
cautioned the Mayor as he rapped for
order.
"He can't do nothing else," blurted
Supervisor Britt as he Joined in the
melee. "He's a gallery player, he is."
The newspaper article Supervisor
Clinton referred to charged him with
having run away from a meeting of a
number of residents of the Mission dis
trict who were to take him to task for
opposing the purchase of the tract for
the proposed park. Clinton said he did
not know what the object of the meet
ing was, and he left it shortly after it
had been called in order to attend to
some other business.
"When order had settled over the
meeting Britt got the floor, and he com
menced an attack on Clinton. "When
the gentleman says he does not know
what that meeting was called for," he
said, "he is talking to the gallery. I
saw the gentleman a few minutes be
fore the meeting was called, and I have
an opinion, and I have a right to ex
press it, and I say it is true. That
gentleman knew what that meeting
was called for." ?: > v
"Mr. Mayor, he knows he lies when
he says it," roared Supervisor Clinton,
as he Jumped to his feet and pointed
his finger at Britt.
"I am not afraid of you!" yelled
Britt, as he made a rush at Clinton.
- Supervisor Smith caught Britt and
held him back.
"You knew what that meeting was
for," shouted Britt, as he waved his
fists in the air and struggled .to get
loose from Smith's embrace.
"You lie, you scoundrel, you lie," re
-irted Clinton, shaking his linger under
\Britt's nose.
The sergeant-at-arms came to the as
sistance of Supervisor Smith, and they
succeeded in pulling both men to their
eeats before blood was spilled.
Order was again restored, and the
resolution providing for a survey of the
property was adopted.
The committee on health and police
presented a report recommending the
granting of permits to the Empire Ath
letic Club to give two exhibitions of
physical culture next month. Super
visor Clinton asked if there had been
any other applications for like permits
from any other persons, and if so, why
had they been refused.
Supervisor Delany, the chairman of
the committee, who was still smarting
under the remarks of Clinton, jumped
to his feet to answer the question.
"There were other applicants," he said,
"for such permits, but they were re
fused because they were fakes like
some gentlemen who sit in this board."
On motion it was decided to grant
only one permit to the club.
A resolution was adopted instructing
the City and County Attorney to agree
to a judgment for $5000 in favor of A.
V. Smith for damages to his property
on East street, near Jackson.

struction â of a new City and County

Supervisor Delaney presented a reso
lution r^iuiiing the Market Street
Railway Company ,to allow, working
models of fenders of apparent merit to
be fixed to their cars for the purpose
of testing them, iJnd also that as soon

The object is to protect passengers

fnE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1898.
JUDGE LOW IS
ON HIS METTLE.
He Is After the Scalp of
Policeman Luke
Livingston.
Charges Him With Conduct
Unbecoming an Officer and
Is Relentless.
| Trouble Arose Over a Cnns In Which
Livingston Was the Arrest
ing Officer.
Judge Low yesterday derided to pre
fer charges before the Police Commis
sioners against Policeman Luke Liv
ingston arising out of the dismissal erf.
a case In which Livingston was the ar
resting officer.
The case was that of P. Faro, who
was charged with assault to murder.
The complaining witness was Joseph
Marino, and Faro was accused of stab
bing him during a tight in a saloon.
When the case was heard on Decem
ber 24 Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds
was not present in court, and Attorney
Long, who represented the defendant,
performed the double role of prosecut
ing attorney and attorney for defend
ant.
I-lvinfrston protested against the case
going on without the prosecuting at
torney being present, and he and Long
had an altercation "n the subject.
The evidence showed, acogrding to
Judge Low, that Marino was the ag
gressor, and that Faro in stabbing him
merely acted in self-defense. He ac
cordingly dismissed the case. Living
ston at once laid the matter before
Chief Lees, and the chief instructed
him to take it before the Grand Jury.
The Grand 'Jury threw out the case.
The Judge secured a copy \<f the evi
dence given by Livingston before the
Grand Jury, and alleges that he made
many misstatements. besides intimat
ing that the case had been squared.
'"I do not propose." said Judge Low
yesterday, "to allow any policeman to
come into my court and because a case
is dismissed' to make false statements
about me to his superior officer or any
body else, and I propose to make an ex
ample <>f Livingston. He has acted all
through in a manner that was totally
uncalled for. The case was decided on
Its merits. The complaining witness
had been up on several occasions f<>r
using a knife, and is considered a dan
gerous man.** _^_

development and our mldocean colony Is har
vesting a phenomenal crop or sugar, gladden
ing the heart of the seaman, the shipowner,
the lumberman and the commission ngent.
He stated that the fisheries have yield
ed abundantly, and domestic Interstate
and foreign commerce have responded
to thÂ«" general Impulse of prosperity.
The trustees have endeavored to forward
the Interests of the city and State, and
the stand of the chamber has always
been for Internationa] arbitration of all
vexatious questions. Upon >.ie subject of
excessive pilotage Mr. Craig speaks thus:
Your officers were active at Sacramento In
the Interests of reduced pilotage, without suc
cess, however. Vented Interests were too
strong for â a sad commentary on the State
Legislature to admit; that twenty pilots ana
their henchmen at Sacramento have for forty
years blocked reform, defied the shipping In
terests of San Francisco and public opinion.
We hope ' for better success a year hence.
The position of the chamber is well
known to have been for sound money,
and this fact is forcibly brought to the
attention of the members. In his report
the president makes special reference to
the Nicaragua canal, and the progress
made on that great undertaking, and
particular stress is laid on the compliment
paid to the chambers former secretary.
Captain Merry, who was appointed as
Minister to the Central American States.
Attention Is called to the petition of the
chamber to the Treasury Department to
have the growing commerce of the coast
better protected by the establishment of
an efficient patrol along the Alaskan
shores. The position of the body is
also reiterated in the matter of annexa
tion of the Hawaiian Islands, and a few
pleasant words are spoken on the brighter
prospects of the mining Industry in thia
State.
A passing word of congratulation for
the.suocess of the belt railroad on the
water front and the enterprise of the lo
cal merchants in reaching out for the
Klondike trade are made, and. after
mentioning the decease of seven mem
bers of the chamber, Mr. Craig prophe
sies a successful year for UK.
The reports of the secretary, treasurer
and librarian will also be presented. Af
ter the regular business of the annual
meeting is over the new officers, elected
last week, will meet and organize.
. â¦ .
A Presentation.
At the meeting: of Court Eclipse of the
Foresters of America, the retiring past
chief ranger, A. J. Enermack. was on
behalf of the court presented with a fine
gold badge and a framed certificate in
recognition of the faithful manner in
which he performed Ids dutiess while in
office.
DOGS TRAINING
FOR THE TRIALS
Setters and Pointers That Are
Now Quartered Near
Bakersfield.
Bennett's Lock Will Mot Be an Oppo
nent of Sullivan's Dash
Anlonio.
Weather permitting, the sportsmen
who will attend the field trials at
Bakerfield next week should witness
some excellent contests between dogs of
high degree.
It is said that one of the judges-
William Dormer of this cityâ cannot at
tend the meeting, as business of import
ance will detain him elsewhere.
The two remaining Judges are A. Van
dorfort of Pasadena and A. Merriman of
the East. In all probability Judge Post
of Sacramento will be selected to fill
Dormer's nhtce.
Arthur Bennett stated a few days ago
that his champion English setter Lock
will not be a contestant in the Bakers
field trials. The dog only recently ar
rived here from the Bast and Is not in
condition for trials that give promise of
being very warmly contested.
The following letter is from The Call's
co: respondent at BakersfieM:
The eighth annual field trials of the Pacific
Coast Field Trials Club will begin here on
Monday. January 24. It Is more than likely
that the trials will be held over the same
ground as last - year, it being optional with
the Kern County Gun Club, who has control
of all suitable grounds In the county.

the present time are: R. M. Dodge of Verona,

FOR THE NEW CHARTER
Organized Labor Will MaKe Its
Wants K noWn Next Sunday.
Organized labor in this city is deter
mined to have its say in the new charter
If it can possibly get It. and if it cannot
have the paragraphs .introduced which it
wants, a determined effort will be made
by the forces to defeat this charter even
as others have been defeated, or more
emphatically if possible.
The matter was brought up when the
charter was first talked of and a success
ful eff jrt was made to have represt nta
tion on the committee of one hundred,
but b<"yond having the name; on the roll
nothing was accomplished, as almost
every move made by labor's representa
tives was voted down. On the day of tho
Destructive Storms Alonft the Coast.
Reports of maritime disasters along the
coast come In thick and fast. People who
"go down to the sea in phips" should bear In
mind one thing in particular, namely, that It
ts highly desirable to take along a supply of
Hostetter's Stomach Bitters as a remedy for
sea sickness. Nausea, dyspepsia, biliousness.
con*tipat: >n. malaria, nervousness an<l kid
ney trouble, all succumb to Its beneficent and

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate maximum temperature
for the day?; those underneath it. If any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in inches
and hundredth* during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The wind "high" means high ;
barometric pressure find Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In the Interior and low
along the const, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" i.Â« inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result. 9S7ME

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 17â Standard shares show
a fractional improvement on the day except
In the case of some shares on which special
influences were operating in their favor and
In these the Improvement wns more marked.
The deallnirs were widely distributed and the
tone generally healthy. Stocks sold Friday
and Saturday on the ground of possible for
eign complications were repurchased to-day,
total dealings amounting to nearly half a
million shares. London and the Continental
bourses were sustaining factors, although the
purchases for foreign account were meager as
the local market early outstripped the foreign
Initiative toward a higher level.
Sugar, in enormous transactions, made a net
gain of %, although In the earlier transactions
there was considerable weakness noted In that
security. The old subject was brought up of
what the result of Hawaiian annexation would
be. with free Importation of Hawaiian Sugar
and the probability that by midsummer
there would be competition between sugar re
fineries now l>ein>> erected. Stocks of proper
ties located !n the Pacific Northwest were gen
erally benefited by the belief that they se
cure much traffic, owing to the Klondike
boom. Oregon Hallway and Navigation Com
pany had earnings from July 1 to November
30 said to be very large. Burlington, St
Paul, Northern Pacific and Union Pacific were
strong. The non-appearance of the Nebraska
maximum freight decision was a factor in tho
day's news. lookers seemed to give some
credit to the reports of closer relation In the
management o.' all Vanderbilt railway*.
The fact that New York and Chicago are
lending money on the London and Continental
markets continues to be a favorable factor
the foreigners so far having liquidated their
debt for America's unparalleled exports only
to the extent of returning some American se
curities.
The Bond market showed a falling off In
transactions, but a considerable undertone of
strength was evident which was reflected In
substantial appreciations In many of the us
ually dormant issues. Seattle. Lake Shore and
Eastern firsts (trust receipts) jumped 7 points
to ~^i on reported competition for control of
the road, but subsequently lost one-half of the
rise. The aggregate sales were $3,628 r'-<r '-< Gov
ernment Bonds showed heaviness, the 5s and
new 4s losing slightly.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 17.â .Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet and irregular to-day.
Home rails were the best market on dividends
and the end of the strike. Argentines rose
readily as did also Grand Trunks.
Americans were quiet and steady. Continued
pessimistic telegrams from New York concern-
Ing currency reform changed public confidence
here.. The London Daily News Washington
cablegram was gloomy. Indian sterling bills
for Â£1.000.000 have been sold in six months'
bills at an average of about 2Vi per cent.
A Cape loan of Â£1,250.000 is announced at a
minimum of par. It is quoted at 24 premium.
1 have reason to doubt the accuracy of the
details of the Chinese loan as cabled the Lon

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 17.â Influential news was
scarce at the opening In Wheat. The unex
, pected firmness at Liverpool was the most
. prominent feature. The course of that market
; attracted a (treat deal of attention and was
| directly the cause of the opening advance here.
1 Prices for May ranged from 90*ic to 90 7
! against Saturday's final price of 90^c. A little
1 realizing by scalpers caused aâ : momentary
| drop to 90%@90\c, which represented the
I low point of the day. Buying carried the
; price steadily upward and about noon 91Vic
i was bid. Liverpool showed from %d to Id ad
' vance at the opening here, although It had
i started at a slight decline and that advance
was In the main held to the close. A New
York house reported bids received from
Mannheim. Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium,
for Wheat at 2 cents above what they were
willing to pay a few days ago. Argentine
Wheat Is usually shipped heavily to these
countries and It was Inferred that offers from
the South American country were falling off.
; That was given as the explanation of the
' strength at Liverpool also. The visible de
creased 1.025.000 bushels, leaving the total at
37.838,000 bushels, against 1,413,000 bushels de
crease and a total of 52,459,000 bushels at the
similar time last year. The big decrease lent
i additional strength to the market. The
I world's shipments of Wheat and Flour last
week were officially reported at 7.007.000
bushels, without any from India. The pre
! vious week they were 4,850. bushels and a
i year ago 4,132.000 bushels. The day's domestic
exports of Wheat and Flour from Atlantic
, ports equaled 320,000 bushels. During the last
, hour's trading a little realizing was done, suf
i ficient to cause a reaction to &07i@Slc, the
1 market closing steady at that price.
; Corn was very dull. May ranged from 29^c
i to 2874 c, and closed a shade lower at 25"4529 c
| Oats were fairly active for awnlle. but be
; came quite dull toward the close. May ranged
from 23?; cto 23*;ic, and closed a shade higher
at 21%@J3%c.
Trading In provisions was of moderate vot
i ume and mostly at an advance. Realizing was
: quite free later and a reaction took place.

Thus did the Supervisors to-day
unanimously warn all their employes
that they must not neglect their work
during the coming months for the pur
pose of doing politics.
When the resolution was read no
names were mentioned, but it was re
cited that the law requires all the de
partments of the county government to
be kept open during certain hours, and
by Inference it was stated that in some
instances this law has been violated. A
statement follows that there are under
the direct supervision of the Supervt
many appointees who should be
at their posts so as to give the best ac
commodation and assist mcc to the gen
eral public, and it is at these that the
resolution is aimed.
This new rule of the board has been
varloi . ted at the county
buildings this afternoon. It includes all
the staff of the City and County
I ivlng Hospital, county
expert, additional department rU-rk.
courth >use gardening and engineering

altogether about forty p
Then â  who think that there is
a Joker in the resolution and that its
Intent is to give a foundation for cer
tain changes that could not diplomat
ically lie madi> otherwise. It has no
bearing, of course, on the heads of de
partments, but it is known that many
complaints have been made in certain
quarters that the attention is not what
it should be; A few weeks aero pome new
rules were made for the government of i
the Receiving Hospital, and to-day's
proceeding is along the Bame line.
There ar^ many politicians in the cm
ii.rd of Supervisors and
now that politics are daily becoming
more active, there Is a general inclina
tion on the part of the "'ins" to neglect
their duties und go around town and
county repairing fences. Any one
caught doing this hereafter knows the
penalty, although there is a very gen
eral impression that the carrying- out
of the resolution will depend a great
deal on whose ox is gored.
BOARD OF TRADE
FAVORS PARKS
A Canvass of Members Shows
the Feeling on the Sub
ject.
Argument Before the Council and
Presentation of Opin
ions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Jan. 17.
The Board of Trade has made a can
vass of many of its members for the
purpose of determining whether a ma
jority or not are in favor of continuing
the agitation for a public park. At to
night's meeting of the Council the result
of the canvass was submitted and showed
that about 70 per cent favor such an im
provement.
This effort was made by the board for
the purpose of being able to present an
opinion that would be honestly repre
sentative of Its membership. There are
about 400 members in the Board of
Trade and the minority of them are op
posed to parks because they consider
that there are other Improvements more
necessary at. this time. Those who op
pose the movement submitted their rea
sons for doing so, and these' reasons
fairly represent the opinions of the mem
bers who object to spending large sums
of public money for land at the present
time. Taxes are said to be high enough
THE GREATER UNIVERSITY.
Professor William Carey Jones Outlines a Plan for Berkeley's
Advancement.
The programme for an international competition of architects, whereby it is
designed to obtain a plan for the complete and permanent architectural improve
ment ami arjornment of our university grounds, has been published to the *' orl^-
With the launching of this enterprise it would he well If the students individ
ually or as a body, were to become fully conscious of its scope and import.
What is designed for the University of California in this project for an ar
chitectural plan? There is designed a noble home for a noble universityâ a
home of larger !ifo for a university of larger scope. Beautiful forms in art
are to match beautiful forms in nature. Aspiring minds are to find ideals that
will lift them above themselves. Education 1b to be refined; character is to be
ennobled; science and philosophy are to be exalted; art is to find Its new home
in the seat of all the knowledges; spiritual influence is to pervade the heart
and core of all our manifold life.
The rerjr Inception of this plan means a fuller and more pregnant life for
the University of California, Rnd the student or professor who fails to realize
this loses from his current experience a large and ennobling factor. To the man
of faith and imagination, the plowed field and the seeding time are as beautiful
and inspiring aa the time of bursting germs, verdant spring, bountiful summer
and refulgent autumn. Every season has its harvest for the prescient mind.
Breathe the life of hope and loyalty. Realize that we are enjoying the
things that our predecessors, or we in earlier dayÃ, planned and planted for us.
They strove with confidence and Joy, feeling the glow of endeavor and the
satisfaction that the fruits of their work would bless the generations to come.
Let us in all things be equally sanguine, hopeful and joyful in devising the
forms and features of the coming days. Read the programme. Observe the
scope of it, see the motive, comprehend the tendency. Believe in the goodnesÃ
and purity and beauty of things. Understand that the plan aims at things of
the intellect, of the spirit, of the soul, and aid, by your faith, and your work*, in
MHrl Â» to its highest aim the fullest re alization. WM. CAREY JONES.

davits were filed to-day In the case of

i never said to Mrs. Palmanteer or any one
| that the note and mortgage were Just
i claims against her or that she owed the

gage were extorted by the Morrises
through the threat of Mr. Morris Sr.
that he would send my husband to the
State prison for forgery if I did not ex- ,
I ecute the note and mortgage, and I never
knew of the existence of the 'old note
upon which my name was forged until
July 12. when the Morrises called at my
house with it and told me they held the
note against me and my husband. 1 never
knew until that momentof my husband

' rises."

and competent persons to the various of
fices of the city of Alameda. without re
gard to party affiliation. The mainte
nance of the referendum principle in mu

proval and criticism of the acts of munici

SAN LEANDRO
IS ANXIOUS
The Cannery Question to
Be Decided Next
Wednesday.
Wealthy Men Not Doing Any
More Than Are the
Preachers.
The Ten Thousand Dollars Still a
Lontj Way From Beituj
Raised.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. IT.
A meeting that means much to the
future of San I^eandro is to be held In
that town on Wednesday evening next.
It is the final gathering of the citizens
to decide the question as to whether
the town shall have a cannery or
whether the movement shall be aban
doned.
For several weeks the committee In
charge of the scheme has been trying
to raise a bonus of $10,000 with which
to approach cannery ownt-rs seeking to
locate at. San Leandro. A great deal of
interest has been aroused, and many
subscriptions have been promised, but
the encouragement has not been what
was expected, nor has it come from the
very quarters in which it might be sup
posed the most substantial donations
would be given.
Rev. Father McAvoy, the parish
priest, and Rev. Barton Berry, the
Presbyterian minister, have worked en
ergetically for the furtherance of the
project. They have contributed liberally
according to their means, and have per
suaded many others to do likewise. The
public schools have also borne part of
the burden, but there is still much more
than half the required amount to be
raised.
Some of the citizens have been look
ing into the state of affairs, and they
have discovered that tht? wealthy resi
dents who own a good portion of the
town and have a lucrative interest in
another portion have not done what
the people have a moral right to sup
pose they would do. It is recounted
that Rev. Mr. Berry, with a salary Of
$7,-> a month, has promised as much as
Banker Farelly, wh-; !s interested in
several capitalistic schemes, and who
is generally raU -d as a millionaire.
Father McAvoy. anxious to see the lit
th- town go ahead, has contributed
equally with L. <\ Morehouse, the
wealthy banker and State Equalizer,
and Socrates Huff, the president of the
local bank, has done no better. It was
thought when the scheme started that
these wealthy people would be the
main contributors, but public expecta
tions have bt-en disappointed.
In San Leandro at the present time
it is said there are about eighty vacant
houses, and a permanent cannery
would bring enough residents to fill
th^m. As most of the houses are under
some obligation to th& local capitalists
the citizens think that more encourage
ment should be given to the cannery
movement in proportion to the wealth
of the contributors.
Wednesday evening the matter will
be brought up, and it will be decided
whether the affair is to be a success or
not.

HER IDENTITY
IS ESTABLISHED
The Young Woman Who Com
mitted Suicide in Los Ange
les Was Mary Hegle.
Charles Raabe of the Park House In
the Mission Was Her Stepfather
and Notified the Police.
The Identity of the young woman who
committed suicide in Los Angeles Janu
ary 3 by swallowing a dose of carbolic
acid was made known yesterday and
Chief Lees' wired the information to the
chief of police there.
She went under the name of * Mrs.
Gladys Harris in Los Angeles and in
Denver, where she had been living before
going to the former city, her husband be
ing Charles Harris, a dry goods clerk.
Yesterday morning Charles Raabe of
the Park House, Twenty-fourth and Mis
sion streets, called upon Chief Lees and
said that he had seen the dispatch In the
morning papers a few days ago about the
death of Mrs. Harris in Los Angeles. She
was his stepdaughter, and her name was
Mary Hegle. Her mother died May 27,
last year. At that time she was keeping
company with Charles Harris, a clerk
In the Chicago Clothing House. Harris
left the city about a year ago and she
left shortly afterward to join Harris. He
had not heard of her from that time un
til he saw her death mentioned in the
newspapers.
From the dispatch it appeared that
jealousy drove the young woman to com
mit suicide. "While she and Harris were
living in Denver she attempted to com
mit suicide by swallowing carbolic acid,
but as she had eaten a hearty meal
shortly before the poison did not have
the desired effect and her life was saved.
Her stepfather did not know whether
she had been married to Harris, and

If climbing thÂ« summit of Chllcoot
Pass Is a more difficult undertaking
than picking winners at the race track
these days, the Klondike gold discov
eries will attract very few turf patrons
to the frozen north. Between Jockeys
â¢whose muscular developments entitle
them to a place in the front rank of
pugilism, gluey mud that almost pulls
the plates from the feet of the equine
racers, and startling reversals of form
that appall the officials In the stand.'
there Is little wonderment that people
begin to think the game a hard one to
beat. The going at Oakland yesterday
was sticky and holding and but two fa
vorites could master it. The history of
the four beaten choices is replete with
epice and humor.
There did look to be one "caat-iron"
on the card, and that was the queerly
named I Don't Know, but Q. Morse, a
cherry complexloned rider from Mon
tana and way ports, volunteered to see
that the books ?ot none the worst of it.
The mouse-colored sprinter was a 4 to
f> choice in the betting, and a liberal
crowd of bookies gave a deserving pub
lic all they wanted of It without rub
bing. Their kindness was amply re
worded. Morse eventually landed I
Don't Know In third place, after nearly
pulling all of the horse's teeth out in
doing so. If Morse were a politician
with a pull as strong as his was yes
terday. Presidential aspirants would
be prostrating themselves at his feet.
For his Sandowic exhibition he was
Indefinitely suspended, and the owner
of the horse, F. Reed, requested to
check his stable for some other parts.
The race, a flve-furlong dash, was cap
tured by Lo Lo, a 6 to 1 chance in the
betting, which led out the second
choice, Koenigen, rather cleverly.
This pyrotechnical display was sec
ond only in Its depressing effects to the
win of old Red Glenn at odds of 100 to
1. The most scantily supported start
er In the fourth event, a seven and a
half furlong tour, ridden by a stable
lad named Klley, and carrying only a
few paltry dollars of his owner to get
the show, the gelding came ploughing
through the deep mud in tha stretch.
and in a mild drive led Kaiser Ludwig
and El Moro past the wire. At several
points lower in the betting a few scat
tering dollars were placed on the
chances of Purser's horse.
McLemore's gelding. Jack Martin,
was a pronounced favorite for the sev
en and one-half furlong run, but the
sticky going was more than he could
negotiate, and, though he was piloted
by Thorpe, he ran unplaced. The ia-to-1
shot, Magnus, ridden by Clawson,
jumped away in the lead, and was nev
er caught, v.iuninp. hardridden. less
than a length in advance of Our Cli
mate, another outsider, with Conley up.
Coda was a fair third.
Captive came out In Sam Hildreth'e
colors after a summer's recreation In
the country, and was heavily played at
odds of 4 to 5 to capture the mile run,
third on the card. He passed Gotobed
before half the route had been travers
ed, but the last sixteenth was in turn
passed by The Dipper, with little
O'Connor In the saddie, and beaten less
than a length. Nonchaianee, the sec
ond choice, finished in the show. Cap
tive pulled up very lame.
It was only the superb riding of
"Skeets" Martin that landed the mile
and a sixteenth purse for Barney
Schreiber. His brown horse, Schiller,
â¢was a 4-to-5 choice in the ring, and
after making all the running was chal
lenged the last furlong by Hazard, with

Chief of Police.
The latter, after listening to his story,
j ordered Detective Anthony to Inter
j view the we/man and obtain 'her ver
j sion, of the alleged robbery.
Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday aft
| ernoon Mrs. Palmer, accompanied by
I the detective, visited the City Hall.
i She was fashionably dressed, and in a
rather indignant tone told her story.
She pave her address as 702 Howard
I street, o#d claimed, that she was be
ins persecuted by the mining man from
I Montana.
! "Some time ago," she began, "my
I husband died, leaving me almost penni
j loss and with our little girl to provide
! for. Unable to properly care for her, I
concluded to seek employment, in the
â  hope of earning sufficient money to at
I least buy us the necessaries of life.
"On the advice of a friend I inserted
an advertisement in a morning paper,
asking for a position as housekeeper in
some respectable family. The following
day Bahrs. who claimed to be a brother
of Superior Judge Bahrs, visited my
house in answer to the advertisement.
He pretended to fall madly in love with
I me, and asked me to become his wife.
I told him that on account of our short

off- r, but laughingly informed him I
I would think it over. He promised to
j call again on the "following day. which
:he did. After a short conversation,
: during which he declared his undying
I love for me, he again begged me to
marry him.
"He spoke of his vast mining inter
ests in Montana, and also claimed
; that he owned some valuable property
in Seattle. Thinking he was telling the
I truth I half promised to become his
j wife. To my surprise a few weeks ago
he visited my house and proposed that

"This is like getting money from
home," she claims he remarked, "you
i represent yourself as his widow and
| we will have money to burn."
"He wanted me to go to Seattle with
him," she continued, "claiming that
we would have no difficulty in getting
the insurance money. I scorned his
proposition and ordered him never to
speak to me again on the subject.
"Last Saturday was the day fixed for
our marriage, and after waiting long
after the appointed hour Bahrs finally
appeared. He handed me his watch
and chain, and after announcing that
he had lopt all his ready cash against
a brace game, as he expressed it, he
told me to realize on the timepiece. I
refused to take his advice, and as he
had played with my affections long
enough I determined to keep the watch
as a memento of our marriage that did
not take place. After I had Informed
him of my intentions he told me to
keep the watch and to remember him
by It. Since then I understand he has

him. She is seriously thinking of com

"Shamus O'Brien" was not a con
spicuous success In New York last
season. "Brian Boru" was â and the
distinction Is hardly In favor of New
York.
"Brian Boru," the words by Stanis
laus Strange, the music by Julian Ed
wards and the authors' description "a
romantic opera," was produced at the
Tivoli last night. I Bhall not attempt
to predict its popular and pecuniary
fortunes at that opera house. It
strikes me as a work that should ap
peal especially to the persons who did
not enjoy "Shamus." It does nothing
that "Phamus" did and nearly every
thing that It did not. The only point

at which the two may be compared is
comedy. "Shamus" had moments of
| bad comedy exalted by good music,
and "Brian" has hours of bad comedy
: relieved by very little good music. Be
; yond this remote relationship simi
larity stops. "Shamus" told a story,
a good, old-fashioned melodrama, and
. made it vital and stirring and Irish-
It had dramatic power and character.
"Brian" has no character, no na- \
tionality. With few exceptions It is [
built on the old ballad scheme. Some
i of the music is amiable, 'most of It is
I clap-trap and a rtty little of it might
be called descriptive â that is where a '
few well-known Irish tunes are worked
; into the score, either directly or in
counterpoint. There is a good quartet
\ at the close of the second act, in which
: one of the voices sings "The Harp
That Once Through Tara's Halls" in
; concord with an agitated piece for the
; others, and one or two of the Irish
> comedy songs have something of the
I brogue and spirit in their make-up.
But on the whole the music might
i have been written by twenty men of
as many countries.
One moment it walls "Wagnerianly,
the next it waitzes in the mode of de
| funct Viennese operetta, the next it af
; fects the metrical sentimentallsm that
j marked the youth of Signor Verdi, and
I oftenest of all It runs to the mongrel
ballad form of to-day. The orchestra
tion is heavy, pompous and puffy; It
has no more regard for the lyrics than
it has for the drama, often drowning
them at Just the moments when their
articulation is necessary to the sanity
of the plot.
The book of "Brian Boru" would
be a good one if it had one hour less
of Strange comedy. The story was
fairly forecast in Sunday's Call, only
that account omitted the details of
the comic relief. They are terrible.
Mr. Strange's fun runs to horse-play:
his humor seems to center in that
anatomical feature which is not m-jn
tionable in polite society, and Mr.
Leary and Mr. Kavanaugh. who have
the roughest of the comedy parts, do
not pretend to any subtleties that are
not suggested by the text.
The production is the best the Tivoli
can do in the present circumstances
of the company. Arthur Donaldson
has been brought out from the East to
play the part of Brian. He is not a
sensation nor particularly magnetic,
but his voice is reasonably evpn and
sure, his presence is comely, and he
has an air of reliability that promises
to woar well. Every <>ne in the cast
worked hard last nieht without any
one arriving at individual glorification.
The chorus was as fortunate as usual,
and the orchestra something less
through playing too violently.

A PECULIAR
DISAPPEARANCE
Josephine Kane Has Not Been
Seen Since Last Wednes
day.
Detaetiva Anthony Detailed on the
Case at the Paj-ents' Sug
gestion.
Much anxiety Js felt by the parents of
Josephine Kane, a young girl 13 years of
age, who mysteriously disappeared from
her home last "Wednesday under rather
peculiar circumstances. The girl has
been Rttendlog the Turk-street school,
between Turk and Buchanan streets, but
last Wednesday failed to appear at roll
call. She returned to her home as usual
at the noon hour, but a note from .the
teacher had preceded her asking for an
excuse concerning her absence. Mrs.
Kane ui'istioned her daughter and dis
covered that the girl had stayed away
without any cause. She was severely
Si olded and told to mend her ways. In
the afternoon she went into the basement
to pet some wood with which to build a
fire and h:is not been seen since.
Her father, \V. H. Kane, a painter by
trade, living at 1408 Ellis street. Is in a
cjucmlary concerning his daughter's dis- :
:ance. but the police are of the
opinion that the young girl has gone to
Borne family with the excuse that she
was an orphan. Detective Anthony was
detailed on the case and is working dill- ;
gently, as the parents are .almost pros
trated over the affair. At the time of the !
girl's disappearani c she was attired in a ;
dark green dress, button shoes, and wore
no coat nor hat. As she is slender and
has rather dark brown hair the detective
la of the opinion that if she ia in the i
neighborhood she will be discovered In a
few days, as the description has been
carefully given.

have got away at noon yesterday, but
there was a rush of freight at the last
moment, and the sailing time had to
be again postponed.
tile Library Association, which promised
on the surface to be so exciting, turned
out to be a very tame affair, so far as the
1000 subscribers were concerned. Only 120
of them saw fit to vote for the men and
women Into whose hands the destiny of
the association will be intrusted for the
next year.
Of this number there was anything but
a choice as to whether Thomas Magee or
Edward Perely would be the president.
The vote was a tie as between these two
candidates, each receiving sixty, and
while the tally-sheet showed only 120 cast,
yet thore were three ballots cast which
failed to count for either candidate. A
similar condition of facts was made ap
parent in the result of the general ticket
where there was no opposition, each can
didate receiving 122 rotes, while Charles
J. King received 61 votes and Captain X
Peniel received 62 for the office of record
ing secretary, making 123 votes cast for
this office.
The result of the election shows that
the regular ticket has been elected with

SUICIDE'S POOR SOLACE.
MISS MILDRED A. CLARK.
A maiden, just in the flush of young womanhood, dead by her own hand be
neath her loving mother's roof.
A maiden beloved by all who knew her; with more than falls to the lot
of most young women to make her cling to life and rejoice over environment*
calculated to confer happiness upon almost any mortal being. . â¢: .
Such Is the sad story of Miss Mildred A. Clark, who deliberately shot her
self to death at the residence of her mother. Mrs. Mary PJ. Clark. "216 Webster
street, at 5 o'clock p. m. yesterday.
There is no doubt that the unfortunate young woman's terrible act was the
result of a mind temporarily unbalanced. The deceased had been seriously 111
for several days past with a severe cold and nervous prostration, superinduced
by arduous labor in connection with a musicale in which she took a prominent
part on the evening of the 3d inst.
At about the hour above named Mrs. Clark left her daughter's bedside,
where she had been tenderly ministering to the patient, to step into an adjoin
ing room for a moment. Almost immediately the mother heard the report of
a pistol in tho chamber which she had just quitted, and, rushing back into
that apartment, she was horrified t< find her daughter weltering In her own
blood, with a smoking pistol in her band. She had shot herself in the mouth,
and death was. of course, almost instantaneous. The deceased was 25 years of
age and was greatly beloved by all who knew her. She was of charming dis
position and possessed of many qualities of head and heart calculated to endear
her to her intimates. With vocal talent of a very high order, she gave promise r
of rare distinction in musical art. her superb voice having received flattering
praise at many musical entertainments in this city, where she had lived during
the greater part of her life. She was an only child, and if she had any reason.
In her sane moments, to wish to end her life, it ia not known to the grief
stricken mother.
