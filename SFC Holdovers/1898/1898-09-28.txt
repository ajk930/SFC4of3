Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW Y< >RTC. Sept. 27.â The Wash-
ington correspondent of the â  Herald
who has Just arrived in \Vas.hineton
from Manila, personally delivered 10
Acting Secretary Allen to-day a eoi i
munication from Rear Admiral Dewey,
understood to contain his' views with
respect to the disposition of the Phil-
Ippine Islands. This communication j
was subsequently presented tc â¢he
President, and a copy will undoubtedly
be forwarded to the Peace Commission
for its information.
Rear Admiral Dewey believ?3 with
the President that the United States
should occupy the island of L<uzon. and
should have reversionary rights with
respect to the remainder of the islands.
It is the expectation of the authorities ;
that Rear Admiral Dewey will continue |
his efforts to destroy the insurgent
navy, and no .surprise need be experi
enced at reports in the near future an
nouncing the capture of other Filipino
vessels by American men-of-war.
â¢ I was also told as the insurgents fly
an unrecognized' flag, it is technically j
â vvithin the province of any manrof-war !
to capture or destroy any of their ships i
as piratical craft. 'While Rear Admiral
1 Dewey is not proceeding on this as
sumption, it is fuily within the limit of
intc-inatii nal law for him to have seized
the Abbe;' for violation <>t neutrality.
When General Greene reached Gen- j
eral Corbiri'B office he found awaiting '
him a commission of major general of i
volunteers, dated so as to place him in
that grade from August last.

UNPRECEDENTED GALE.
Many Disasters Feared Off the Brit-

VANCOUVER, H. C, Sept. 27.â Sinrr
last night an unprecedented sale of wind
has raged. The steamer Horsa was
blown ashore at Steveson. She is prob
ably not damac-i! much, as she is flying
no distress signals. It is rumored that a
number of fishing boats have been cap

th" rumor cannot be confirmed. The hill-

which blew down a great deal of timber.
TO IMPROVE THE
STATE HIGHWAYS
Commissioners Draft a Bill for
Submission to the Coming
Legislature.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 27.â The State Highway Commissioners have
prepared a draft of a bill that will be submitted to the coming Legisla
ture and which they think will result in good roads throughout Cali
fornia. The plan is to provide that one-half of all moneys collected in
the counties for road improvements be placed in a separate fund, to be
expended on roads indicated as State highways, the contracts tor the
work to be let by the Supervisors on plans and specifications to be ap
proved by the Commissioners.
The Legislature will also be urged to pass a bill to the effect that
when any county completes five miles of road in accordance with the pro
posed amendment the same shall on petition to the Highway Commis
sion and with the approval of the Governor be accepted by the State as
a State highway and maintained as such.
The Commissioners assert that the counties raise annually nearly
two million dollars for road purposes and that under the proposed
amendment and without increasing the present tax, from seven hun
dred and fifty thousand to one million dollars would be put into
permanent improvements yearly, and that in the course of a few years
every county would have many miles of good roads, which would be
in*Â«niained by the State at no exueneo to the county.

Office has taken great pains to treat
the American and Spanish commission
ers â in precisely the ?ame manner, it
; must be admitted that the general at

pression here that the American com
missioners have instructions to provide
for the retention of Manila and the Is
land of Luzon, "and for the ' commis
sion to pretend to negotiate is a farce,"
said a prominent diplomat. He con
, tinued:
"America will put herself diplomati
! cally in â¢ the wrong when she exceeds
the provisions of the protocol which
both nations signed. I. know the Span
j iards have come to make concessions,
' but if the Americans' instructions are

i generally believed her" to be the case,
j you can rest assured that the work of

Spaniards will retire and America will
at least have to threaten a resumption
of hostilities before she will gain her
point."

As the joint commission Is not a de

! some quarters to be the wiser plan, as
| tending to promwte closer working re
, lations between the two commissions
and to facilitate an ultimate adji:st

SAX FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1898.
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
BEGINS ITS DELIBERATIONS
CHARLES L PATTON, WHO HAS CONSENTED TO ACCEPT THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR MAYOR.
YIELDING to a pressure which for days had been becoming
stronger, Charles L. Patton has consented to become a
candidate for the Republican nomination for Mayor. Yes
terday Mr. Patton was called upon by a cpmmlttee of
prominent citizens who urged him to this course, setting forth
that he was the most formidable opponent who could be named
to run against Mayor Phelan. Bo urgent were they that the
plea they advanced decided Mr. Patton to enter the race. This
committee told him only that which many individuals had told
him before. The honor Is not of Mr. Patton's seeking, but it
seemed to him that as a good citizen and a good Republican
he could no longer refuse. Once in the fight, he will devote to
it his best energies, and Republicans are confident that he will
triumph.
In personal appearance Mr. Patton has everything to com
mend him. Midway of the thirties, he is in the very heyday
of manhood's prime. The dignity of his bearing makes him
look older.- He is large of frame, with a fine nead showing
gray at the temples. In manner he is frank and hearty, and
blessed with the- faculty of instantly winning friends. As the
Mayor of this city he would be a credit to it and representative
of its best citizenship. He is at home on the platform, ready in
speech and quickly adapts himself to any situation. Mr. Pat
ton is a native of California, and has long been a resident of
San Francisco, where he maintains a beautiful home. A law
yer.of large practice, and active socially and in business, he
has never held ' office nor been a 'candidate. Yet his party
affiliations are well known, and his liberality has contributed
much to Republican success. There has never been any hesi
tancy in calling upon him, and he has always responded to the
The French Government Is arranging
to provide at the salon where the joint
sessions of the commissions will be held
an elaborate buffet daily for the use of
all the commissioners.
The morning and afternoon sessions
of the United States peace commission
ers to-day were devoted to the inter-
national affairs of the commission and
the systematizing of the working force.
President Faure will receive the mem
bers of the American and Spanish peace
commissions separately to-morrow
afternoon. In the morning the Ameri
can commissioners will visit the
grounds of the Paris Exposition of 1900
in company with Ferdinand W. Peck,
United States Commissioner to the ex
position. ________^__

opportunity to boar a share of the party's legitimate expenses.
Hlb unostentatious contributions to charity are familiar among
those, whose duty it has been to ask his assistance, or who have
been recipients of his bounty. As a lawyer, Mr. Patton holds
high rank, being especially noted for an executive ability. He
lias a clear grasp of any case he undertakes, and his record of
victories is long.
Mr. Patton has the peculiar advantage- of never -having held
a public position, and never having solicited one. His political
record is simply that of the earnest, upright citizen who casts
a ballot according to his conscience. He is not attached to any
boss. There is no clique to claim him. He stands simply for
the Republican party of San Francisco and that the party can
depend upon him to carry its standard and in advancing its
interests advance the interests of the entire city none who
know Mr. Pattnn will doubt. A rnun of unquestioned Integrity,
of loyalty to his friends, and whose loftiness of purpose is evi
dent to nil who come into contact with him, he goes into the
contest unhampered and to win.
"With all his quiet bearing Mr. Patton is a flgnter. He never
enters unprepared into conflict. Having made up his mind,
there will be no half-way measures employed, no sloth of which
the enemy may take advantage. The campaignâ if he be at
the head of itâ will be to a finish, and no relaxation from be
ginning to end.
It is a compliment to Mr. Patton that while Republicans are
delighted at his consent to seek the nomination, the consterna
tion in Democratic ranks is general. There had been a hope
that against Phelan would be put an acknowledged politician,
one who had no end of entangling alliances, but the Republic
cans shrewdly picked out a man free from all taint of Jobbery,
independent, fearless and clean; a citizen of repute, of financial
and social standing, with an honorable place In his chosen
calling, with friends without number, and not weakened by
having been in a position to make enemies.
COLOMBIA WILL PAY,

PANAMA, Colombia, Sep. 27.â 1 can
state with entire confidence that Colombia
has not defied Italy by declining to pay
the Cerruti claim. The dispute with Italy
is regarded as settled, so far as the
award of President Cleveland In the case
is concerned. Sixty thousand rounds
sterling has already been paid to Ernosto
Cerruti for personal damages, and pay
ment of the liabilities of Cerruti & Co.
has been guaranteed.
The presence of Admiral Candiani's
squadron at Cartagena was to enforce
recognition of the latter part of the
award. It only withdrew after Colombia
haa recognized the legality of this and
guaranteed payment. Colombia declares
that President Cleveland exceeded his
powers, but according to the terms of the
arbitration treaty his decision is final.

GREAT SUFFERING ON
THE ASHCROFT TRAIL
Canadian Authorities Taking Steps

Prospectors.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 27.â As a re
sult of the many stories told of the dis
tress of the prospectors on the Ashcroft
trail, it is stated that the provincial gov
ernment is taking the necessary steps to
send aid and that the Dominion Govern
ment will be asked to do its share.
J. A. Grey of New York city and J. At
wood of Boston tell a story which con
firms former reports of the horrors of the
Ashcroft trail. They left Ashcroft April
28 and nearly starved, they say, before
they reached Glenora. Said Grey: "Our
sufferings between Hazleton and Glenora
were almost beyond endurance. For ten
days we lived on a few ounces of porridge
daily and for five days, when the pangs of
hunger drove us to desperation, we shot
a horse and lived on horse flesh. Weary,
footsore and weak to death we reached
Glenora. Not having any money after
reaching here to get home we applied to
the American Consul for aid from the
United States Government."

Effects Temporary Or
ganization and
Adjourns.
Merton C. Allen Made Chairman
and T.E.Atkinson Secre
taryâPersonnel of
Committees,
The Republican conventions met last night in the Native Sons' building
and perfected temporary organization. The municipal convention se
lected for its chairman Morton C. Allen, and for secretary Thomas E.
Atkinson. Committees were appointed, and an adjournment was taken
until to-night. On accepting the chairmanship Mr. Allen made a brief
and well worded speech on the record and aims of the Republican party.
The address was received with hearty applause. The educational,
judicial and Legislative conventions proceeded on the same lines. Ex-
Stats Senator Edward I. V/offe was elected temporary chairman and Ed
ward J. Casey secretary. Mr. Wolfe announced his intention to deal
with all matters brought before him with the utmost fairness. After
the appointment of committees the convention adjourned to meet to-night
at the same place.
The Republican iiunlcipal Convention
held its initial session last evening and
accomplished the preliminary work neces
sary to the Important task of naming the
citizens who will represent the party as
candidates of municipal and legislative of
fices.
Merton C. Allen, a .well-known news
paper writer of this city,- was selected as
th 1 ? Ltemp.(jrary_^ch*iirinam of tht; . .' conven-
I tton. When pernrui'nerit '" 6rga.rilia.tl6n '-'â  had
been effected he will no doubt be selected
as the permanent chairman and will pre-.
side over the deliberations the body un
til Its final adjournment. His address to
the convention last' night was a fine ora
torical effort and embraced a summary of
the issues that confront the Republican
party and the voters of the city and State
rat the coming election.
The convention selected T. E. Atkinson
as its temporary. secretary, appointed nec
essary committees and transacted such
other business as is necessarily prelimi
nary to the deliberations of a nominating
body. "When the convention meets again
this evening all will be In readiness for
the adoption of a platform and the mak
ing of nominations.
The convention assembled at Native
Sons' Hall. The assemblage and sur
roundings presented such a marked con
trast to the convention- that was held In
the same building by the Democrats dur
ing the past week that it excited comment
on every hand. The one hundred job
chasers, who constituted themselves the
Democratic convention, occupied a limited
floor space in the front of the hall and
their deliberations presented much the
appearance of a ward caucus. The ap
pearance of the hall last evening recalled
memories of the great conventions held at
Sacramento.. The entire floor space was
necessary to accommodate the delegates,
who numbered more than three hundred.
Banners placed at intervals Indicated the
position of each of the eighteen Assembly
District delegations and made it possible
for the chairman to aetermine the district
to which any delegate on the floor be-
longed.
The hall was beautifully decorated with
flags and tri-colored bunting that hung
in festoons from the gallery railing, and
was draped from the walls to a magnifi
cent cluster of color in the center of the
vaulted ceiling. Around the gallery rail
and back of the speaker's chair were
hung life-size lithographs of Henry T.
Gage and Jacob Neff, the Republican
standard-bearers. Where was before a
lobby and gallery packed with hooting,
hissing and perspiring men there was
here an orderly and respectful assem
blage that was, apparently, as deeply in
terested in the well conducted proceed
ings on the floor of the convention hall as
the delegates themselves.
Thomas D. Riordan, chairman of the Re
publican County Committee, called the
convention to order. He had hoped to be
able to make a brief address to the as
sembled delegates, but was. unfortunate
ly, so ill as to necessitate his retirement
to his home immediately after the elec
tion of a temporary chairman. His in
disposition, while not of a necessarily se
rious nature, was still so serious as to
make it necessary for him to disobey the
positive orders of his physician in oraer
to be present at the initial meeting of the
convention.
When nominations for temporary chair -

man were called for ex-State Senator
Thomas C. Maher placed Merton C. Allen
in nomination. The nomination was sec
onded by Frank H. Powers. There being
no other candidate put forward for the
position the election of Mr. Allen as
chairman was made by acclamation. Ma
her and Powers were appointed a com
mittee to escort Mr. Allen to the plat
form, lie addressed the convention as
ICIIIOWK.
"Gentlemen of the convention: I thank
you heartily for the honor which you
have conferred upon me, and I desire to
express my gratincatlon at being called
upon to preside over a gathering 1 of
American citizens who represent the best
there is in American citizenship â the
grand old Republican party.
"This matchless organization, aside
from the great record It has made since
its inception, has made history in tha
past six months which has resulted in the
revivifying of the nation â made it taka
on a new glow of being â a proud position
before the peoples of the earth. (Cheers.)
"These conditions were brought about
by a Republican President, the gift of a
Republican people to a Republican con
tinent. This war that has just ended was
not a Republican war and the party will
not endeavor to glorify itself by the splen
did victories achieved on land and sea.
What our heroes have done to vindicate
the honor of the country will never be for
gotten. The fields of El Caney and San-
tiago have been made sacred by the blood
of new American heroes, the luster of
whose names will live while heroism is
admired of all people. There was no poli
tics there. It was warâ an outpouring of
the sentiment of the nation. Not a waro
if conquest, but of humanity, dignity and
philanthropy. Our soldiers in the stress
Df battle fought like Americans, and in
;he flush of victory and In the face of
the helpless enemy were as gentlo as
American women. (Applause.)
"It seems a special kindness of Provi
flenee that always in the nation's need
there is a Republican on deok. In the
Sarkest hour of the history of our coun
try there was an Abraham Lincoln to lead
Us to the light of peace and unity. So
there was a soldier-statesman. TVllli'.m
McKinley, at the head of state affaiis
when it needed a man of wisdomâ a
statesman and when need be a warrior-
President to properly handle the situa
tion. (Applause.)
"From the hour the Maine was de-
Itroyed in the harbor of Havana until tne
[>lâ>n< time the nation has been proud of
that wise and able s'aiisman, William
McKinley. (Applause.)
"The Republicans of San Francisco are
|ustly proud of President McKinley, and
thr>y are also proud of the standard
bearer of the party of this State, Henry
T. <i:ige. (Cheers.) Not only this, but of
every man on the ticket from top to
bottom.
"We are here to select nominees for
municipal and legislative offices. It Is
not our ftfrpose to choose them because
they are Republicans, but. because th*Â»y
are the !)cst men for the onions that are
to be filled. The Republican party stands
for good government and I know that
when our work is completed the party will
have reason to feel proud of our work,
For- we will have nominated a ticket sat
isfactory to every man whose interest is
for the good government of the city.
"So far ns I am concerned I have no
ends to serve, no favors to give, no pun
*!shment to inflict. The only desire is to
place in the field a. ticket that will com- j
mand the united 'support of the intelligent
ritlaens of San Francisco. I await your
. pleasure." K3P lfr3PH*flPl(
After the applause with which Chalr- i
tnan Allen's address was greeted had sub- j
Bided Frank ,H. Powers moved that the
convention proceed to' the election of a"
temporary. secretary. The motion -was,
adopted, and Powers placed in nomina

WOLFE CHOSEN CHAIRMAN.
Will Preside Over the Judicial and
Educational Convention.
The Republican Educational, Judicial
and Legislative Nominating Convention
met last night in the banquet hall of jmsl
j tive Sons' building. The delegates were
called to order by P. H. Prendergast, sec
| retary of the Republican County Conven

i to be performed by the convention Sec
retary Prendurgaet declared that nomina
tions for temporary chairman were in
order.
Edgar Peixotto then placed Senator Ed
wuni I. Wolfe in nomination for chair
man. He said in making the nominating
speech that Wolfe would act impartially
and fairly and would seÂ« that every dele
1 gate had his voice and say in all the mat
ters of business coming before the con
vention.
The nomination of Wolfe was seconded
by A. J. Morgenstefn.
There being no further nominations,
Wolfe was elected temporary chairman
by acclamation.
Senator Wolfe, in taking the chair,
thunked the convention for the honor-con-,
ferred on him.
"1 pledge you, gentlemen," said > he.
"that while I act as presiding offlcef or
this assemblage I shall rule with abso
lute impartiality and fairness to' all. 10
my mind thin is a very important conven
tion. We are here to nominate a ticket,
legislative, judicial and educational, tnat
will be a counterpart of the excellent
ticket named by the State Republican
Convention at Sacramento. The nomina
tions of Gage and Xeff have been most
favorably received by the people. It be
hooves us to act calmly a^jd deliberately
and nominate men who win aid in rolling
up a magnlno'Ut majority for our stan
dard bearers.
Chairman Wolfe then called for nomina
tions for temporary secretary.
Ed J. Casey was placed in nomination
by W. A. S. Nicholson. There bÂ» ing no
other nominations, Casey was elected by
acclamation.
"I thank you for the honor conferred,"

CHETCO VENDETTA CAN
GO ON UNINTERRUPTED
Grand Jury of Curry County, Or.,
Fails to Indict the Murderers
of Coolidge.
CRESCENT CITY, Or., Sept. 27.â The
Grand Jury, of Crescent City, Ore
gon, which was expected to Indict the
parties charged with the killing of A. -
Coolidg-e at Chetco last Octoher, failed
to make any indictments. Thomas Van
Pelt and five sonsâ also E. C. Hughes, a
son-in-lawâ had been under arrest nlnce
the date of the murder, and It was con
fidently expected that they would be
brought to trial.
The killing of Coolidge was the result
of a feud of long standing, and one In
which there had previously and have
elnce been other acts of violence and
bloodshed,, which, as a whole, became no- j
torious as the "Chetco vendetta." The
Van Pelts and Hughes were for a time
kept in Jail at Gold Beach, the county
seat of Curry County, but were finally
released on ball, soon after which the :
senior Van Pelt was ambushed and slain, ;
presumably by a friend of Coolidge.
By those who are acquainted with the
feeling that prevails In the vteinlty of
Chetco it Is predicted that the failure
of the Grand Jury to indict those charged
with the crime will encourage greater â 
lawlessness tnan ever, and UÂ»at the coun- |
ty will eventually, aftor other murders ,
have been committed, have to bear the !
burden of investigation and meting out !
justice that it has In the present instance

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, lÂ»aÂ».
INDEPENDENTS
ARE ARRANGING
TO CONVENE
To Nominate a Full
County Ticket.
FUSIONISTS ARE AT WAR
__
WILL HAVE A CANDIDATE FOR
ASSESSOR.
Chairman Breed Names the Republi
i can Sub-Committees to Manage
the Campaign This
Fall.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 27.
Much Interest is expressed In- the In
dependent convention, which has been
called to meet at Germania Hall next
i Friday evening. There is a good deal of
dissatisfaction regarding some â  of the
; nominations, especially on the so-cnlled
| fusion ticket, and there are some Inde
; pendent Republicans who, finding they
. could not win at the primaries, still per
j mit the political bee to buzz, and they
are now being led on to try to get on the
ticket.
The peculiar manner In which the Sil
ver Republicans were placed in the posi
tion of nominating a gold-bug Republi
canâHenry Dalton for Assessor â la still
the leading topic of conversation among
the Demo-Populists. Very few peoples
knew that there was a Silver Republi
can organization in this city and no one
knows who appointed the committee with
power to treat with the Democrats and
Populists. The result of it all Is that
the Democrats are now casting around
for a strong candidate to put up for As
seesor and probably one may be nomin
ated by the Independent convention on
Friday.
There was also another Independent
movement called the Non-Partisan party,
and this seems to have collapsed with the
passing from the political arena, of
George Hunt, whose shattered mentality
has prevented him from doing anything
more in his Independent race for Sheriff.
It is now probable that nothing more
will be heard of the Non-Partisan move
ment. It never received much support
and was generally regarded as the laÂ«t
effort of a few soreheads.
All over the county so-called fusionlsts
are in revolt, and hourly the feeling of
discontent Is growing. The Populists, es
pecially, feel that tn< have been com
pletely swallowed. Their standing is not
so great prospectlvely an It is at the pres
ent time. Now they till throe of the moÃt
lucrative and fatâ from a patronage point
of viewâ offices . in the county, whereas at
the fusion convention they were only
given about three nominations with not
the slightest hope of electing any of
their nominees.
Aaron Bretz has the middle-of-the-road
end of the party; the Silver Republicans
claim Henry Dalton; the ; Democrats
grasped all the offices for which there
was even a ghOÃt of a lighting chance,
and it looks aa though the Fusion Popu
lists were not leading % forlorn hope.
Morris Isaacs, a prominent merchant of
this city, has Issued a statement in re
ply to Rabbis Friedlander and Voorsang
er, in which he defends the position of
the For'y-elghth Assembly District Good
Government Club. Mr. Isaacs says-.- . â â > r
Bpveral 'articles hay* been published in the
newspapers <>f thlÂ» city reflecting upon the
methods of thi)i>e who compote the Grxxl Gov
ernment Club of the Forty-eighth Assembly
District. In vindication of those bo vllln'M I
aÂ«k your kind perfltissfsgi to Insert the follow,
ing explanation:
With all due d-ferenc* to Rabbis Friedlander
and Voorsanger (Mr. Sol Kahn Included, If so
desired). let us take as a supposition that they
are right In their opinions bo publicly ex
pressed In respect to the wrong doing ot certain
Hebrews In forming a political club for tlio
purpose of receiving the fame political recoKni
. tion as their Christian neighbors. Are they
(the rabbis) right in expressing themselves as
they have done through the public press In
holding up to ridicule those who supply them
with bread and butter (figuratively), or should
they have gone to "these foreigner* whom they
consider too Ignorant to understand their ! po
litical franchises" and by persuasive eloquence
1 and logical argument reasoned those "igno
ramuses" back to the right path? ,
The above is only a supposititious argument,
so that the following facts figures can be
appreciated. Tha Good Government Club of
the Forty-eighth Assembly District waa In
augurated for the purpose of seeking to Im
prove that part-'of the city which is embraced
In the Forty-eighth Assejnhly District, and Is
composed of Democrats",' Republicans, Socialists
and Populists of different creeds (which gives
the He to those who have unauthorltatlvely
stated that only Jews belonged to the club).
The constitution and by-laws of the organiza
tion states In the most positive terms that not
one cent shall be taken from any aspirant who
Is . seeking political honors. For the Hebrew â 
community at larje it would be well for them
If those reverend gentlemen would study up the
abstruse problems of the Talmud Instead of in
dulging In tirades against their own people to
the delight of those anti-Somites who can point
â with a good' deal of truth at the â¢ doings of
those who are supposed to be the spiritual
heads of the Hebrew race. Let Rabbis Fried- '
lander and Voonmnger, In proclaiming" their
Americanism, remember that we are not in
the medieval ages, and aIBO beer In mind the
old Latin quotation: "Tempura mutuntur et
noa rnutamur in Mis."

THE SEVENTH MUST
PROCEED TO MANILA
WIDE VARIANCE OF OPINION IN
THE REGIMENT.
Enlisted Men Generally Desire Re
lease, but the Officers Said to
Favor Active Foreign
Service.
Orders were received nt the Presidio
yesterday from the War Department stat
ing: that the Seventh California Regiment
would go to Manila, but that those mem
bers of it who so desired and who could
show good and sufficient reasons for leav
ing the service would be discharged. This
means that over three-fourths of the men
must remain in the service whether they
wish to or not. The situation in the regi
ment has practically narrowed down to a
fight between the enlisted men upon one
side and the officers upon the other. The
men want to get out of the service Just
as soon as they can 1 that is to say, at
leant 80 ncr cent of them do. And they In
tend to use all of their influence to ac
complish their ends. The men claim that
they have been misrepresented by Colonel
Berry as far as their wishes are con
cerned. The men did not hesitate to say
yesterday that thrlr officers had been
"playing them"; that Ib, that they had
been all along pretending thoy were also
anxious to be mustered out, when, in
J'iU't, through Colonel Berry they have
been secretly plotting with General Mer
rlam since his return to have the regi
ment kept in the service.
Yestordny morning:. when Captain
Pratt, tho mustt-rii/lj officer, rerrched the
ramp, he announced that at the evening
parade he would take a vote upon the
subject of whether the men wanted to
be mustered out and thus ascertain their
wishes in the matter. At parade the men
all turned out, even those who were sick
In quarters and excused, but Captain
Pratt and Colonel Berry did not appear,
and the vote was not taken. The men
were loud in their denunciations of the
way they had been treated in the matter.
Colonel Berry and uaptain Pratt left
shortly before parade for department
headquarters, where they had a confer
ence with General Merriam. Captain
l'ratt returned later In the afternoon, but
refused absolutely to mako any state
ment for publication. Colonel Berry was
not to be found in camp yeeterday even
ing.
Yesterday morning the men were eager
and expectant at the prospt?cts of an
early home-going, but later in the day,
when they got wind of the orders from
"Washington, they began to express them
selves in no uncertain terms. No official
information on the subject of the regi
ment remaining in the service was given
out to the men yesterday.
The officers refused to dtscuss the mat-
ter.
The men of the regiment declare they
do not wish to go to Manila. They say
they have no desire for garrison and po
lice duty, and many of them were even
mutinous In their expressions, declaring
that they would leave the service any
way, or else that they intended to make
it warm for their oincers.
An outbreak upon the part of the men,
however, Is not feared, and It is the gen
eral opinion that in a few days they will
accept the Inevitable with that fortitude
and alacrity that ever characterize tne
American soldier.
CORBETT AND SHARKEY.
The Sailor is Willing to Fight but
the Ex-Champion Is Doubtful.
' Jim Corbett, the fx-champlon pugilist of the
! world, need not watt long for an opportunity
to make big money, that Is, provided he la
I sincere In his Idea* about entering the ring
again.
Now that his proposed "mill" with McCoy 1b
oft for good, Corbett can pocket a cool $15,000
puree by whipping Tom Sharkey, the powerful
sailor, In this city.
Last week the National Club of this city
offered a purse of $10,000 for a twenty-round
contest between Jeffries and Corbett, but when
the manager of the club learned of the little
Interest the sporting people of this olty took
In a contest of this kind he decided to drop It
quick, and yesterday he telegraphed Corbett
and Sharkey offering a purse of $15,000 for a
twenty-round bout to be held in this city.
Tom O'Rourke, in behalf of Sharkey, an
swered the National Club's dispatch, stating
that Sharkey would be only too anxious to fight
Corbett In this city under any old rules and
that the purse was satlsf actor}-. O'Rourke
stipulated, however, that a referee from the
East must be selected, and to this proposition
t lie r!ul) will willingly consent.
Corbett lias not answered the telegram aa
yet, but Eastern sporting men who are visiting
this city say that Corbett will not fight Shar
key, and that he would much rather meet
Jeffries. The friends of Cnrbett contend that
the ex-champion is not afraid of Sharkey, and
that he will send a favorable reply to the offer
that has been made to him by the National
Club. If Jim should consent to a match of
this kind there will be very little time lost in
bringing the men together.
In the Divorce Courts.
John J. Ford wns granted a divorce
'< from Madge H. Ford yesterday on the
ground of willful desertion. Martha L.
I Staples has been granted a divorce from
AVilllam J. Staples on the ground of cru
; elty. John \V. Lemmon has been granted

STRIVING FOR
THE POPULIST
PARTY NAME
Factions Before the
Supreme Court.
CASE FINALLY- SUBMITTED
A WARM PASSAGE OF WORDS
BETWEEN COUNSEL.
Attorney Cator Resents the Applica
tion of His Acts at St. Louis
Convention as an Illus
tration.
The struggle for the Populist party des
ignation on the State ticket was resumed
yesterday before the Supreme Court, in
bank, the seven Justices being in attend
ance.
T. y. Cator alone entered the lists for
the "Middle-of-the-Road" Populists, while
the fusionists had as spokesmen Garret
McEnerney, Senator Stephen M. White, E.
A. Bridgford and Judge Van Meter. The
parties at interest agreed upon a state
ment of facts in the premises and sub
mitted the case late in the afternoon after
each side had argued the law points in
volved.
Mr. McEnerney outllnedthe situation at
Sacramento during the Populist .conven
tion, July 12, 13 and 14. He told of the
convention meeting on the first twodaya
in regular session and how the delegates
opposed to Maguire and fusion called an
other convention in the Senate chambers
on the following day. He held that this
minority did not represent the Populist
party, but that the men who remained be- r
hind and completed the labors of the
original convention were the true repre
sentatives of the party. He argued that
the convention properâ not the courtsâ
waa the last resort of the People's paxty.
Political parties, he declared, must, bo
treated like any unincorporated religious
or social organization. That the majority
rules has grown to be an axiom in Amer
ican politics and relief must be sought In
the party itself and not in the courts.
Secretary of State Brown when filing
the certificate of election was not acting
In a judicial capacity, he said,' and all
that was required of him was to tile the
certificate and not to decide any ques
tion. â  He submitted that the People's
party had done its duty, consequently
that there was nothing to decide, and he
asked that a writ of mandamus issue.
Senator White grew sarcastic in hla
summing up of the fusionists. In speak
ing he assumed that the court would not
prescribe rules of morals and behavior for
political parties. He insisted that . the
convention was a convention of the Popu
list party and said that Mr. Cator and nis
friends did not find anything wrong with
it until his man was defeated.' When they
did not get what they wanted fifty-three
of them withdrew and set up for them
selves. '
He said if they were proclaimed the rep
resentatives of the Populist party that
they were subject to a penal law punish
ing the voting for two men for the same
office. On these grounds he said they
should nottbe before the court unless in.
answer to habeas corpus proceedings. Ha
spoke of the tlfty-three bolters aa: <r exilÂ«s"
of the Populist- convention and that under
the conditions they -could not set them
eelvesup as the true and only represen
tatives â of the Populist ticket. Because
the convention acted contrary to the
wishes of Cator and other* waÂ« no reason
why they should set up a convention lor
their own..- - â¢ f-
In closing he said they accepted the
platform of the Populists, showing that
they agreed upon the principles of the
party but disagreed upon the spoils.
Mr. Cator made an earnest plea for the
persons he represents in the controversy.
He disputed the statement â of his op
ponents to the effect that due notice of
the ' third day's session had . not been
given. He also said that Secretary
Brown had to decide which convention
represented the People's party, as each
had filed certificates. He claimed that
the minority -were the only delegates
faithful to their trust. He said the dele
gates were trustees of the party and were
not supreme. That they became the only
trustees present when the majority re
fused, as he claimed, to carry out the
wishes of the People's party. The others
abandoned it by commingling with and
fusing with the other parties. â 
The only incident to ruffle the surface
of the proceedings was a short passage of
words between Mr. Cator and Mr. Bridg
ford. The latter, I.n citing cases In fa
vor of his argument, said that two years
ago Mr. Cator was sent to St. Louis-in
structed against fusion. On the journey
he changed his opinion and voted for
Bryan.
"That is .not true. Judge," interjected
Mr. Cator, "the opposite is the case.'.'
"Well, you voted for Bryan and came
back and voted for him," was the re
joinder. ;â¢
The court took the matter of contro
versy under submission. It has ninety
daya in which to render a decision.
TO GOVERN CYCLE RACING.
California Associated Cycling Clubs
Are Asked to Assume Control
by Eastern Riders.
The struggle of the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs for local option in
the matter of cycling raring: has been won
after a great single- handed light. Accord
ing to a telegram received by F. 11. Ker
rigan last night from Philadelphia, the
racing men of the East have cast their
lot with the governing board of the sport
on this coast.
The telegram . was signed by twelve of
the racing men whose minus are as
household words wherever- the bicycle is
used. The change In the sentiment of
the Eastern men has been gradual. Tho
officers of the League of American Wheel
men have imposeS exacting rules upon
them until the burden became too great
to bear. The climax was reached when
men were fined for training on a track
that had been blacklisted. It was sup
poÃed that the rider did not come within
the jurisdiction of the racing board until
he competed.
The cycling officials on this coast believe
the men of the East should have their
own organization. The sport must be
f;overned from either Chicago or New
'ork by a national organization to insure
permanency.
"It is gratifying to know that we have
won our fight and that the Eastern racing
men look to the California Associated
Clubs for guidance," said Chairman R. M
Welch of the association racing board
last night: "I thought though that they

MANUFACTURED AND
"SHOVED THE QUEER"
A CLEVER COUNTERFEITER IS
CAPTURED AND CONFESSES,
R. R. Lambert Has Been Making Bo
gus Money on Barbary Coast
for Four Months.
R. R. Lambert, a man nearly sixty
years old, was arrested by Officers Mc-
Mahori, Freel and Duane last evening and
charged with counterfeiting. When taken
into custody he acknowledged his- guilt
| and confessed that, he had been operating
in the city for the last four months.
A number of pieces -of counterfeit sil
ver ironey have been discovered in differ
ent stores on the Barbary Coast, recently
and during the past week Officer McMa
hon has been endeavoring to trace them.
Last evening he succeeded in locating the
maker of bogus money at the Rock
House, 438 Broadway. With Freel and
! Duane he entered, the room of Lambert
I and found the old man asleep. When ;
| awakened Lambert at iirst. denied ' hig j
guilt, but after the officers had searched j
the rooms and brought to light about 'f 100 i
of "the queer" and a complete outfit for
Us manufacture he gave in and confessed..
The counterfeit money is all in fifty,
twenty-five and ten cent pieces, ranging
in dates from 1X43 to 1897. The dies, twelve
fn number, are good ones, and the' coins j
are almost perfect as far as looks go, !
but thc-ir "ring" is very poor. ' Lambert
says that the metals used in the. manu- j
I facture of the money were' antimony and i
tin, with a small amount of sheet silver.
While the counterfeiter gave the name
of Lambert, it is believed that he is an
ex-convict nÂ«r.?.-,i Charlie Everrett. who j
was released from San Quontln about a
year ago, after serving a. sentence' for j
counterfeiting. . The man Everrett was
captured by Lieutenant Esola.and a num
ber of the officers at the California-street
Station identify Lambert as the', same'
man. A picture taken of Everrett at San
Quentin is very much like Lambert,
though the growth of a goatee acts as a
disguise. â  ' "
Lambert claims that he has only been
able to pass one or two pieces a day, but
the investigation made by McMahon leads
him to tho belief that the counterfeiter
has been getting rid of about twenty dol
lars each day:

COLONEL THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
CONVENTION HALL, SARATOGA^ N. V., Sept. 27.â The Republican
convention nominated the/following ticket to-day:
For Governor-^Theodore Roosevelt of Oyster Bay.
Lieutenant Governorâ Timothy L. Woodruff of Kings.
Comptrollerâ William j. Morgan of Erie.
Secretary of Stateâ John T. McDooough of Albany.
State Treasurerâ John B.Jaeckel of Cayuga.
State Engineerâ Edward A. Bond of Jefferson.
Attorney Generalâ John T. Davie s of Oheida.
The day for the Republican conven
tion to nominate a full State ticket
opened bright and clear. ' All â¢ of.' the
leaders were up and all reached headi
quarters early and air said that there
was no. change in the situation. The ; .
Black men still said that their candi T
date would be placed before the con
vention. . â¢ . â¢ :
Between 10 and 11 o'clock a number r
of special trains arrived, some- from
Troy, bearing Black banners and with \
brass bands playing patriotic . airs, j
Every Indication pointed to an' un
usually large and very enthusiastic
convention. The fact that Elihu Roofs
opinion as to Colonel Roosevelt's can- I
didacy would not be made public be- '
fore the convention went into session
caused some comment. Abraham Gru T : :
ber of the Black forces said at 11 o'clock i
that he would attempt on the floor of. j
the convention to compel the Roose- .
velt people to show their proofs of his
eligibility. The â  Roosevelt people |
laughed at this and said that they were j
prepared with an answer which Mr.
f Koot would present- to the convention
If the question were raised by the |
Jilack jjf'ople. " . 1
Th" delegates were rather slow in cn 7 j
tering the convention hall. A banner
bearing a portrait of Colonel Roosevelt 'â 
wa6 carried in and was loudly . ap
plauded. ThÂ»> ex-Minister to Spain,
Stewart L. Woodford, was greeted with
hearty applause. At 12:14 Mr. Platt cn r
tered. Somebody saw him as he came .
through the dour and started applause, .
â which finally became general. I
.At 12:25 Chairman Oflell rapped for â¢â 
order and Rev. S. D. Johnson of Sara
toga was asked to offer prayer. Follow-
Ing the prayer Louis P. Pay.ne entered
with his delegation,- passing Mr. Platt"
without recognition. The roll of dele
gates for ': -.bstitutes and corrections
was called, . and white it was being
called Lieutenant Governor Timtohy L. ,
Yroodford entered the hall and was
greeted with the heartiest cheer of the j
day, the roll call having to be delayed. |
Mr. Platt had another ovation when
he arose to make a substitution in the
Tioga delegation.
Congressman Zerino E. Payne was â 
chosen temporary chairman and es- I
corted to the platform. He madÂ« the
opening address. After referring to the
victory of the Republican party over
the Democratic-Populist combination
two years ago, he said:
Now, our friends and enemies tell us
that they have lost all interest in national
affairs. They propose to make a cam
palgn upon .State Issues solely. They evi
dently fear to face th'> people on their na
Â«!onal record. Having no decent record j
n HÂ»ate affairs, they are willing to go |
I.efore the people on that issue. We will i
rm-et them on State issues if they desire.
We shirk no responsibility.
Mr. Payne recited the events In con-
L nection with the Spanish war. critlciz
) ing the Democrats for their advanclne
an Income tax proposition to raise rev
enue for war. expenses and continued as
tr" â 'ws: .
The President knew at the beginning,
as the country now- knows, how unpre
pared we' were'. for war. We had a navy
which any nation might envy, but we had
' only the skeleton of an army. To prop
erly -equip and organize an army of iSuO.OOO
men, and to place them in the field in
ninety- d.ays,.fs a tremendous undertak
ing. Mistakes have' undoubtedly been
made: Officers and men have overlooked
the necessity- for sanitary regulations. We
would have -.gladly postponed the war un
tl.l the- autumn, but events thrust it upon
us. Men went from necessity where they
were not acclimated. . We realized that
t.lrÂ» war was not a picnic, but a stern
reality. That there should be suffering
and disease history has taught us to ex
pect. â¢ ' . . â¢
But when the record .of the war is made
up it will .appear that no. great army was
ever -organized anu equipped so' well- and
, pro completely, with less, privation and
less sufferine. than our own vo.lunteer
army in our present war.
I^'ew .questions have grown out of the
war. New territory has been acquired.
What shall be done with- it? New arimin
lstrativequpstions will arise, questions of
revenue, questions of finance, all- of which
are disturbed by our responsibilities. Shall
we adopt 'a colonial policy? What Fhall
It- ho? Whatever is done with these
islands," .wÂ« must' lift up their serai-bar
barous people toward the level of Ameri
can citizenship. Their government, .their
civilization, their education, demand the
best wisdom of our â¢ ablest statesmen.
Shall we' trust- their settlement to those
who two years a^o we're maklngacrusade
against law and- order, against American
credit, and- appealing to the lowest mo
tives of the citizens?- Or sna4l we stand
by the administration and give to Presi
dent -McKinley . at the naUfnal capital, a
Senate and a House of Representatives
who -will aid him in every endeavor to
carry sound systems of- government into
those islands of the sea?
This cannot" be done, gentlemen, by
losing a Senator her.c and an Assembly
man 'there in the State of New York.
We. must see to It that our Democratic
Senator retires to the shades of Troy.
We must have a- Republican, in his place.
We mast have a Republican House. We
must see- to. it that we 'have a Republican
executive in the Empire State. We mUst
stand by the administration in these peril
ous times that ah to .come, guaranteeing
to these islands .a stable, just and equit
able government that 'will give to- Cuba
a place among the nations of the earth
and give to. "Porto Rico a chance beneath
the American flag to march up toward
American civilization and to become a
part of the American people.
The mention of President McKnley's
name was the signal of wild and con
tinuous cheering, and- Delegate Charles
A. Moore of. Brooklyn capped the cli
max by asking -for three cheers, which
were given with a will.
When the convention reassembled at
4 o'clock, after a recess, the committee
on organization reported the perma
nent officers, including Senator Horace
White of Syracuse, for chairman. The
committee on credentials reported that
there were no contests and Senator
White took the chair. References in
his opening speech to Governor Black
and Senator Platt provoked tremen
dous applause. The war hero>s, too,
came in for approbation when refer
ence was made to them by the speaker,

issues, the position of the Republican party and the necessity to the coun-*|

me to present the name of, as it will persuade you to nominate as our^

â¢yelL If he were only the hero of a brilliant charge on the battlefield, and
there was nothing else which fitted him for this high place, I would not^
him in nomination. But Colonel Roosevelt haÂ« shown conspicuous
in the public service for ten years. He was a soldier three months. *s
is not time which tells with an executive mind and restless energy like

The wife of a Cabinet officer told me that when Assistant Secretary

of disease and death, and resulted in our boys being brought im-<

and when he spoke of the charge of
the Rough Riders at Ran Juan the con
vention arose to Its feet with a great
outbreak of demonstrative expression.
The delegates stood in their plac- and
cheered.
The report of the committee on res
olutions was delayed, and it was de
cided to proceed with the nomination*?.
J. Rider Cady of Hudson, who nomi
nated Governor Black two years ago,
took the platform to prrform again the
same service. Judge Cady finished
amid tremendous applause, his closing
remark about Governor Black's faith
fulness to the ticket calling forth the
enthusiasm of the audience.
At 4:55 o'clock Chauncey M. Depew
took the platform to nominate Theodore
Roosevelt. For some minutes Dr. Depew
could not begin his speech for the ap
plause that ensued. Th<jse portions of
his speech relating to President Mc-
Kinley were received with much ap
plause and there was a vigorous recep
tion of the tribute to Governor Black.
When Mr. Depew told of the famous
charge of the Rough Riders and men
tioned Colonel Roosevelt the audience
went into almost hysterical enthusiasm.
When Mr. Depew had reached the point
in his speech where he alluded to the
effect of Mauser bullets two or more
men rushed down the aisle bearing a
big portrait of Roosevelt in Rough
Rider uniform. There was a three' min
ute interruption and the picture was
taken to the stage and set up. Mr.
HHAUNCEY M. DEPEW.
(From a recent photograph by Sarony.)
Depew closed amid applause that was
almost pandemonium.
Then Charles T. Saxton of Wayne
mounted the platform and seconded the
nomination of Governor Black. Assem
blyman Wallace of Queen seconded the
nomination of Roosevelt, Abraham
Gruber that of Governor Black and
George N. Southwick of Albany that of
Roosevelt.
Senator Lexow took the platform to
speak for Governor Black, but the au
dience showed its dissatisfaction at de
lay by crying for the vote. He spoke
briefly.
Elihu Root was called to the platform
by the chairman, and made a statement
as to the eligibility of Mr. Roosevelt to
hold offk. . He said Mr. Roosevelt had
always voted in Oyster Bay, and had
merely removed his personal property
to Washington. He had always paid
taxes In Oyster Bay and had merely
refused to pay taxes on property he
was using in Washington, and by his
affidavit he merely said that he was
not a resident of New York.
When Mr. Root read a letter from Mr.
Roosevelt to his lawyer, asking for
some money, and saying that he had
expended so much money that he was
beyond his income, Mr. Root said:
"Mr. Roosevelt had expended that
1 oney to raise the Rough Riders."
There was a great burst of applause,
and Mr. Root closed by saying the doc
umentary proof not only showed that
he never had lost his residence, but
rathe- had paid money that he wa- not'
obliged to pay to retain it.
Edward Lauterbach made a personal
explanation of his connection with the
recent attack on Colonel Roosevelt's
alleged inedibility.
At 7:15 o'clock Secretary of State
Palmer moved a roll call, and the mo- j
tion was adopted. Before it trot
through the delegation it was evident
Mr. Roosevelt had practically a walk
over, and at 7:32 enough votes had been :
cast to nominate.
At 7:41 the ro!- call was completed,
and the vote was announced as follows:
Roosevelt 753. Bh k 218.
Then the auditors and the delegates
arose in a great mass and cheered.
Judge Cady got the floor and moved the
unanimous nomination. While the
question was pending, Senator Krum,
who had supportec". Governor Black,
said:
"On behalf of Governor Black and
his friends, I say that they stand by
Theodore Roosevelt as he stood by the
country."
The nomination was made unanimous
and at 7:46 o'clock the convention took
a recess until 9 p. m.
The night session was not called to
order until 9:45 o'clock. The chairman
announced that the platform was ready
and General Woodford took the plat
form and read the resolution. The
reading was frequently interspersed by
applause and when finished the plat
form was adopted unanimously.
The platform congratulates the coun
try upon the conclusion of the war with
Spain, praises the "patriotic wisdom,
the patient courage and the broad hu
manity which distinguished the con
duct of President MeKinley during
critical periods of diplomatic negotia
tions and battle, and which now guide
him in the restoration of peace."
"Citizens of every State and every
party fought and won under his com
mand," the resolutions continue, "and
all lingering sectionalism was buried in
the heat of battle."
After praising the splendid heroism
of the army and navy, the platform
says :
We have abiding confidence that the I
President will conclude this peace upon
terms that will satisfy the conscience, the
judgment and the high purpose of the !
American people. We realize that when the i
necessities of war compelled our nation j
to destroy Spanish authority in the An
tilles and Philippines we assumed solemn !
duties and obligations alike to the people j
of the island we conquered and to the j
civilized world. We cannot turn these |
islands back to Spain. We cannot leave \
them unarmed for defense and untried in ;
statecraft to the horrors of domestic |
strife or to partition among European \
powers. We have assumed the reaponsl- ;
bilities of victory, and wherever our flag
has gone the liberty, the humanity and
the civilization which that flag embodies
must remain and abide forever. The Re
publican party has been the party of !
brave conservatism and of triumphant
faith in the nationality of this people, and |
we know that the President and states- '
men and voters of the Republican party 'â 
will meet these issues of the future as '
gravely and triumphantly as we have met
the issues of the past.
We commend the annexation of Hawaii :
in the interest of commerce, of national 1
security and national development.
We renew our allegiance to the doc- '
trines of the St. Louis platform. We i
continue to condemn and resist the Demo
cratic policies declared at Chicago. The

organized Democratic party of the na
tion adheres to these policies of free silver
and free trade and denies the right of the
I courts and of the Government to protect
persons and property from violence. On
the coming Sth of November we are to
I elect not only our four State officers, but
I also representative in Congress and mem-
I bers of our State Legislature. That
Legislature in its term will elect a
United States' Senator to succeed the
present Democratic Senator from this
; State. Democratic leaders declare they
; will conduct this campaign upon Stcite is-
I sues alone. But it is known that if the
I Democratic party secures the State Legis
lature it will re-elect to the United States
Senate that Democrat who now represents
his part}' there and misrepresents the
i State. That Senator supported the cause
of free silver, supported the nominees of
the Chicago convention in the last Presi
dential election; gave his vote in the Sen
ate for the heresies of that Chicago plat
form, and, if re-elected, will continue to
j support these heresies. Democrats may i
try to deceive the people by Ignoring the !
anarchistic doctrines of that instrument in j
their State platform, but their members of
Congress and their Senator, if they should
suceed in re-electing him. cannot and will
not ignore these doctrines at Washington.
We are ready to meet the Democrats
in all State issues, but in a larger sense
this campaign is a national campaign,
I and our people cannot escape its national
consequence. The election of Republi
can members of Congress and of a Re
publican State Legislature will mean
that New York shall stand for the main
tenance of the gold standard, and for
such a revision of the currency laws as
I will guarantee to the labor of the coun
try that every paper promise to pay a
dollar issued'under the authority of the
United States shall be of absolute and
equal value with a gold dollar always
and everywhere.
The Republican party is fulfilling its
pledges made at St. Louis.
In the interests of American labor and
i commerce we believe American products
i should be carried in American ships, and
we favor the up-building of an American
I merchant marine which will give us our
i share in the carrying trade of the world
I in time of peace and constitute an effec
tive naval militia in time of war.
The platform commends the admin
istration of Governor Black, the work
of the Legislature and then deals with
purely State issues.
The platform, having been adopted,
the convention speedily made the bal
ance of the nominations. All but
i Davies were nominated by acclama
tion.

pointed to be an advisory board for the
State committee: Thomas C. Platt,

STOCKTON, Sept.. 27.â The Standard
Electric Company of California, the
company organized by Prince- Ponia
towski and his associates for the pur
pose of conducting electricity from the
electrical works of the Blue Lakes
Water Company in Calaveras County
to San Francisco, and for supplying
intermediate towns, will immediately
apply for a franchise covering the city
of Stockton, allowing the company to
distribute its power throughout this
city. The idea is to furnish electricity
for both lights and power.
Prince Poniatowski stated to-day
that 1000 horse-power would be availa
ble here at the start.
The intention is to continue the line
on to San Francisco. Rights of way
have already been secured from the
power works to San Francisco. The
line will cross the islands to Bethany
and then on through the Llvermore
"Valley to Oakland. In crossing the bay
a cable will be used, although there
has been some speculation as to
whether it would not be preferable to
use a suspended wire, utilizing the' isl
ands and shallow places where supports
could be placed.
Power will be furnished nojt only In
this city but in towns near the line, by
running branch wires to them from the
main one. Electricity will also be fur
nished on the islands for pumping
water for irrigation purposes.

Special Dtspatch to The Call.
SANTA ANA, Sept. 27. â Orange
County adds another to. the series of.
magnificent demonstrations in Southern
California in honor of Henry T. Gage,
the Republican nominee for Governor.
A vast concourse of people assembled
in Santa Ana to-night.. Bands of musiu
tnd artillery salutes are not required
to bring the people together,, but the
young Republicans o.f Santa. Ana, im
pelled by public spirit, determined to
introduce all the elements of a. political
gathering, and go brought out the band
and fired the salutes. The booming of
the cannon announced Air. Gage's ar-r
rival, and when he alighted from the
car the Santa Ana Band discoursed pa
triotic music
He was greeted at the railway sta
tion and escorted to the Kossmore by
a reception committee consisting of the
following citizens: . J. YYV Banird, J..
ilcFadqen, Z. B. West, John llclfad
den, U 1* Shaw, Cash Harvey, W- OL
Smart, J. J. Gray, R. Melrose, C. A.

Dr. J, A. Crane, R. H. SUnborn, L. Gild
macher, George Huntingion, Ira Chand
ler, W. F. Lutz, Frank Ky, D. M- Nor
man and H. A. -Mei'hee. . '
The parlors l of the Kossmore had been
beautifully decorated for the reception
ceremonies by Mrs. J. R. Bowler and
other ladies. From 3 o'clock until 5 in
the afternoon the popular standard
bearer gr*^ led the many citizens who
called to grasp him by the hand.
In Orange County, as in Santa Bar
bara, Yiiviura, San Bernardino and. San
Diego, Mr. Gage is at home. His law
practice has .. frequently brought him
here, and as he is a man who makes
friends wherever he goes he has a large
following of personal friends in Santa
Ana. Republicans, Democrats and
Po-pullsts were in the thrcfng received
by him this afternoon. Apart from
those residing in Santa Ana there were
many from Anaheim,. Orange, Tustin,
Westminster, . Garden Grove and the
country surrounding. â¢ .
General W. H. L. Barnes, who loiter
ed by the sea at San Diego until 1
o'clock to-day, did not arrive in Santa
Ana until- nearly. 6 o'clock. He received
on hiÃ arrival a demonstration almost
as great and enthusiastic ;as that which
hailed the coming of Mr. Gage. The
band was at the railroad station to play
inspiring music and the members of
the reception- committee, accompanied
by Mr. Gage, were there to escort him
to the hotel. The. fame of Barnes as an
orator had been proclaimed in the
orange groves of Southern California.
and wherever he alights from a train
there is always a throng of spectators
eager to see him. â  . .
Before 7 o'clock peopje oh the streets
began to turn their, steps toward-the
Grand Opera House, the place desig
nated for the meeting. The cannon
boomed again, rockets ascended arid
the populace cheered for Gage. The
house was : so densely, packed before $
o'clock that . the committee- could not
press the orators through the crowd, in
front, but had to. gain admission to
the hall from the rear. The; opera house
was beautifully decorated. â  â  .
The vast audience was- called to order
by Z> B. West of the Republican State
Central Committee who announced the
following vice' presidents: J. "W. Watts,

* SAN DIEGO, Sept. 27.â The conversions to Republicanism in San *

* tonishirig and- is highly gratifying to the local leaders of the Re- *
* publican party. It is freely predicted that while San Diego gave *
* Bryan 300 majority, it will give this year its old-time Republican ma- *
â¢â¦. jority of 1500. The Democrats are dismayed at the prospect. They *
* realize that fusion is doomed to certain defeat and the only question *
* in doubt is what. the majority â will be which will overwhelm the com- â¢

Ainorig the open, and avowed supporters of Mr. Gage who have â¢
*â  left the Democratic and Populist parties is Judge J. Wade McDonald. *
* The Judge Is well known throughout San Diego County, for he has *
* been for twelve years a resident and prbminent.legal practitioner. To *
* a Call representative McDonald said:.. *
* ."Yes, lam for Gage this year. lam disgusted with the action *
* the Populists and Democrats have taken, and for the first time I find *
* myself in the ranks of the Republican party. . I believe that I made *
* the first Democratic political campaign speech that was delivered in *
* : the city of Topeka, Kans. I resided in that State for a long period, *
* and although the Democratic party was always in a hopeless minor- *
* ity, I was always a Democrat just the same. Mr. Cleveland's policy *
* made me a : . Populist, and fusion in California this year makes me, for *
* this campaign at least, a Republican.- I believe that San Diego Goun- *
*. ty. will this year give its old-time majority for the Republican ticket: *

* the Republican ranks." â "'. . â¢â¢ *
* A. A. Dunn is the editor of- the Escoridido Advocate, which was *
* the first Populist newspaper in California. Mr. Dunn is no longer *
* conducting a Populist newspaper. He has come straight over into *
* the Republican party, and he has brought "his newspaper with him. *
* In giving his reasons for this. change, Mr.- Dunn to-day said: *
* "I. have always been a Populist since the party was organized. *
. * I. supported Bryan in 1896, and Weaver in 1892. But this year lam *
* in the ranks of the Republican party. The fusion made in Caliror- *
* Jnia and the action of the Democratic State. Convention convinces me *
* that the. Democratic party is not in earnest in the reforms which *
*. we, as Populists, advocate. A confidence game is being played on *
* the Populist party and I do not propose to have it played upon me *
* as an individual. The best way we can secure the reforms we are *
* seeking is to defeat Maguire and the fusion combination. There- *
* lore. I will, for the first time in my life, cast my vote this year for a *

Ballard, was battling for principle.
"We have never fooled the people;
we have never tried. to fool the people,"
said. he.
Referring to the Legislature he said:
"It: is essential that the Legislature
i should be Republican In order to elect
i a man- in sympathy with the adminis
| tration. . Our seven Congressmen in
i California should be in harmony with
President McKinley."
Speaking of Mr. Gage the chairman
said: "It .is useless to say to you that
i he is a man of ability, because you
know that he stands at the head of
1 the Los Angeles bar. He is an honest
; man. He is not a politician, he has
I never held public office, but the people
intend to thrust an office upon him."
As Mr. Gage arose in response to the
introduction the audience gave him a
rousing salute of cheers. When the
I tumult subsided and the flags ceased
waving the standard-bearer thanked
the multitude fur the greeting. He re
marked that the enthusiasm, touched
his heart, yet he understood that the
demonstration was not a tribute to him
as an individual, but was an expres
sion of adherence to Republican prin-
I ciples. Mr. Gage told his friends and
i neighbors that -demonstrations of equal
"' enthusiasm had been given throughout
California and that assurances came to
him that Republicans elsewhere were
confident of victory.
"The people," he said, "know that the
Republican party represents the 'high
est and noblest aspirations of our pol
itics. They know that fusion stands
for the infamous doctrine of single
tax, which means that no man has a
title to the home that he owiis."
Mr. Gage was confident that the good
â¢ sense of the people of California would
condemn the revolutionary sentiments
of Maguireism. He asked the. people
of Orange County to consider what thÂ«
result. would be if the land owner wen
compelled to pay all the taxes imposed
to maintain Government.
Mr. Gage then took up the question
of the railroad settlements handling
the matter with the ability and lucid
ity displayed in his masterly and con
vincing speech at San Diego. He pro
j-ducedj-duced .the record, showing that Ma.
I quire sat in Congress silent and speech
less when the Speaker asked if there
was objection. Mr. Gage read from
the Congressional . Record, .. cited, the
page, and invited inquiry from the au
dience. The production of the Record,,
sustained by the fact that the bill pro
viding fp.r . the settlement came from
Senator Morgan- and v- is supported by
| Senator "White, impressed the audience.
j The remarks of Mr. Gage and partic
! ularly the sentences which closed the
| review of Maguire's record on the rail
! road settlement evoked a- tremendous
shout of approval. ...... V
The gifted standard bearer then took
up Maguire^s record on the question of
providing revenue for' the soldiers in
the war. It was shown that Maguire
voted against the war. revenue .bill and
! did not vote for the' bill granting the
.soldiers who staked their lives for their
country the- right to vote.
As at San Diego, Santa Barbara and
San Bernardino, he thanked the oeoole
for the support : which they gave him
in the nominating convention at Sac
ramento. He resented the imputation
of. Maguire that Orange County dele
gates fo the Republican. State Conven
tion were railroad hirelings, and said
| it was dishonorable for any man aspir

ing to Hie high office of Governor to
cast such reflection on the delegates.
At the conclusion of Mr. Gage's ad
dress a quartet consisting of Minnie
Roper, Happy Smith, Conrad Crook
shank and Fred Lockmann sang for
the entertainment of the audience, and
at the. conclusion of General Barnes'
speech they delighted the audience with
another selection.
Judge Ballard presented General
I Barnes in a speech which the audience
] cheered to the echo. After touching upon
the eloquent attributes of the orator
he said:
"Many people assert that there is
good timber in General Barnes for
jLnited States Senator. [Great aD
i plause.]
"The time may come when the peo
ple of California will rise and demand
his election to that high office. He is a
thorough California man. He is loyal
to the State and understands the inter
ests of California. He is indeed an elo
quent speaker who deals honestly with
the people."
Mighty shouts of welcome arose as
the gifted talker stepped to the front.
He began his address with a reminis
cence of Abraham Lincoln's first in
augration. The sketch of Lincoln was
drawn with the skill of a great artist in
the use of words. The tribute to Lin
coln's character evoked the warmest
commendations from his listeners.
Groyer Cleveland, whose name was
not mentioned by the Maguire Demo
crats, was spoken of as the greatest
Democrat the country had produced in
a half-centuryâ the one man who had
the ability and personal magnetism to
lift the party from the slough of mire
and mud in which it had wallowed for
twenty-live years and lead it to vic
tory.
There are three features of Barnes"
campaign speeches which call from his
hearers unreserved tributes to his skill
as an orator and spellbinder. The first
is his portrayal of the creation of the
world according to the theory of evo
lution. In this he traces the develoD
ment of man up to Thomas Jefferson.
There he takes the reverse picture and
shows the Democratic party in its de
scent from Jefferson to Maguire.
The second is his ideal sixteen-to-one
proposition. He traces with marvelous
beauty of phrase the voyage of the bat
tleship Maine to Havana and the de
struction of the ship as she lay like a
dove of peace with folded wings. Then
he enumerates the sixteen Spanish
ships, ten destroyed at Manila and six
at Santiago, as the sixteen of the ratio
in. which he believes.
The. third is the. American flag and
the expression of the thought that peo
ple do not love their country half
enough. In this he places the flag
among the stars â God's torches in the
heavens. â 
After the speeches there were cheers
and more cheers. People crowded to the
stage to congratulate the orators. The
talk of the city to-night is that the
meeting was the greatest ever he'd in
Orange County. .
Mr. Gage and General Barnes will
speak in Riverside County to-morrow

Special Dispatch, to The Call.
. RIVERSIDE, Sept; 27.â Hon. James
G. Maguire, Democratic nominee for
Governor, and E. L. Hutchison, nomi
nee for Lieutenant Governor, addressed
a' large audience at the opera house this
evening. The large hall was crowded
and many were turned away for want
of room.
Maguire's reception was a hearty one.
Mr. Maguire was introduced by Hon. D.
E. Myers, fusion candidate for the As
sembly. After paying the city a splen
did tribute Mr. Maguire plunged into
his subject with a will.
He first discussed the monopoly phase
of the present pulitical situation in the
State; insisted that the present cam
paign was one in which great issues
were involved, and tnat one of the
greatest of these was the struggle be
tween the money power, as repre
sented by the monon^Mes of the State,
and the people. It was a struggle, be
tween money and the people's rights;
it was a fight for the emancipation of
the people, from the grasp of monopo
lies which, he said, were granted spe
cial privileges until they had become
powerful enough in the State and coun
try to overthrow the rights at the
masses. The manhood of the people
was at stake, and in the support and
success of the fusion forces lay the
only hope of the people of this great
State.
He charged that the money power
was so strong that it found no diffi
culty in electing legislatures to do its
bidding, and that this kind of work was
a direct blow at all our free institu
tions.
He took up the war question and
maintained that it was the people's
war, waged by all parties and all were
entitled to whatever credit was due.
The Republicans, as usual, claimed all
the credit, he said, but the record
shows the claim to be unjust.
Referring to the charge that it had
been said that he refused to support
the war revenue bill, he said it was not
true. He had voted for every dollar
asked for the purpose, and his only ob
jection was to the methods used to
raise some of the war revenue. He
claimed that the revenue bill took more
from the poor than the rich. He asked
his opponents to point to a single meas
ure favoring the soldiers which he had
voted against in Congress.
Mr. Maguire next referred to the
funding bill, and claimed he was the
foremost in endeavoring to have the
railroad company pay the State what
it justly owed.
Mr. Maguire's speech was temperate
all through and was attentively listen
ed to by his auditors. Not in a single
instance did he refer to his opponent in
any but a gentlemanly way.
TIPTON REPUBLICAN RALLY.
Senate and Assembly Candidates
Make Happy Speeches.
TIPTON, Cal., Sept. 27.â A rousing Re
publican meeting w..a held at Tipton to
night. This community was favored by
the presence of George B. McCord, can
didate for Senator in the Thirty-second
District, and E. T. Cosper, candidate for
the Assembly from the Sixty-fourth Dis
trict. The former is a prosperous farm
er, and is making his race against his
opponent, who is a physician, on the
ground that he can better represent his
district, which is an agricultural one,
needing both irrigation and drainage. He
consequently portrayed its necessities and
explained the legislation that would help
it and how he could secure it.
The latter gentleman is a noted law
yer, weH known here, and made many
happy hits in his speech that met with
approval from all. He argued that no
great issues like those of the past now
divide the people, and that the real issue
is in the men to be elected. It is the men
behind the guns, he said, to whom we
must look for effective work.
Democratic Rally at Auburn.
AUBURN, Cal., Sept. 27.-The first rally
of the campaign was given here to-night
by the Democrats. William H. Alford

and Ben P. Tabor acted as chairman or

SENTIMENT IN
FRANCE CHANGING
Violent Attacks on the
Army Leaders.
ARE CONSTANTLY INSULTED
STEPS TAKEN TO REPRESS THE
ASSAULTS.
Rightist Senators and Deputies Pass.
Resolutions Denouncing the
Revision oi the Drey*
fus Case. .. !
Special Dispatch . to The Call.
PARIS. Sept. 27.â At a Cabinet coun
cil held to-day, at which M. Faure, the
President of France, presided, the Min
ister of Justice communicated to- those
present the letter he had addressed to
the Court of Cassation, in which he
submitted the request for a revision of
the Dreyfus case. . The Minister also
read a circular which he had caused to
be sent to the. public prosecutors
throuph the country, instructing them,
to energetically repress any attacks
upon â¢ army.
M. Sarrlen, in his circular to the pub
lic prosecutors, says:
A veritable campaign of insults and
defamation of the chiefs of the army
has broken out. These attacks have as
sumed an exceptionally grave' character'
and are calculated to destroy discipline
and break the confidence of the' soldiers
in their chiefs and introduce a germ of
-disorganization into the army. These at
tacks are . peculiarly Unjustified- in view
of the fact that the Dreyfus affair has
entered upon a judicial phase, and thus'
the chiefs of the army can only oppose
silence to the calumnies of which they
are the object. .
The Rightist Senators and Deputies
at the meetings held to-day passed res
olutions denouncing the revision. The
former declares that the Government's
decision was taken in spite of the re
signation of two Ministers of War and
the vote of the Chamber of Deputies,
and condemns the Ministers for not
convoking Parliament and for disre
garding the army's honor. The Depu
ties of the Right party declared the
Government had violated its pledges
not to agree to a revision, in virtue of.
which the chamber voted confidence in
the Ministry; condemned the Cabinet
for changing the Dreyfus affair from
a Judicial to a political question and
demanded the convocation of Parlia
ment. . .
A deputation of twelve members of
the Right party was appointed to pre
sent the resolution to President Faure,
but he refused to received the deputa
tion on the ground that the procedure
was unconstitutional.
LONDON, Sept. 28.â According to the
National Review, if France requests,
Germany will permit General Schwarz
koppen, formerly German military at
tache in Paris, to reveal all that he
knows regarding the Dreyfus affair.
The National Review's article Indicates
that much of the information published
In London by Mr. Conybeare and others
really emanated from Colonel Schwarz
koppen and Colonel Panlzzardi, the
Italian military attache in Paris.

JARMAN-REA CASE
Lawyer Delmas Rattles 1
the Defense.-
MAKES AN UNEXPECTED MOVE
VIGOROUS PROTEST OF USE
"BOSS' " COUNSEL.
**.n Amended Complaint for Which.
They Were Unpreparedâ Jury
Given a Furlough Pen(*^
<ng Argument.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept: 27^-The Jarman- [
Rea slander suit was resumed before !
Judge Kittredge this morning. But 1
little headway was made. The plain- !
tiff practically completed his case,: and i
an amended complaint submitted by.;
Delmas resulted in. nearly the entire j
day being devoted to argument, which j
will be resumed to-morrow. â¢!
Interest in the case still continues
and the courtroom was again crowded.
Sensations are expected at any time.
Boss Rea has promised to tell some in
teresting facts about the inner work
ings of Santa Clara County politics
when he goes on the stand, and whom
the "lightning" Will strike is hard to
tell.
E. T. Sawyer of the Mercury was the
first witness. He testified to writing
an Interview with liea, in which the.
latter had repeated his slanderous ut
terances about Ja,rman. ' â¢ : '
J. P. Jarman, the plaintiff, was re
called and questioned by Attorney Del
mas in regard to : the purchase of a
sU-am roller by the Common Council.
He said he had, with Councilmen Fay
and Noltlng and Major Koch, visited
Stockton and investigated the steam
roller. Witness said: he had no inter
est in the O. S. Kelly Company. of To
ledo, Ohio, from whom the roller had
been purchased, and that he had no i.n
terest in the machine sold to. the city.
He also denied that he had received
any money on the . purchase of the
roller. . . .
A discussion ar&se over admitting an
interview printed in the Mercury, and
Judge Kittredge held that the inter
view bo admitted simply as a statement
made by Rea, as in doing so neither
the truth nor falsity o.f the statement
would be set up. â ' . â¢â¢ ' .
Attorney Delmae then sprang a sur
prise upon the defense.. He stated that
h<" would argue a reconsideration' of
the question decided Friday In -which
the court ruled that certain testimony
of witnesses showing Rea's remarks
â were slanderous was not admissible.
He also presented, an amended- com
plaint showing that Jarmah was not a
member of â¢ the. Q;*S; Kelly Company
and had never received a cent while
Councilman on. the purchase of the
roller from that company.
This was strenuously objected to by
ftea'a attorneys, who claimed plaintiff
had mi right to submit an amended
complaint at this time. They claimed
they had not even subpenaed any wit
nesses, because they were convinced
Jarman had no case against their
client and had intended to move for a
nonsuit. , â¢'â¢
Tho jury was excused fnr.the balance
of the day and the matter was argued
before the court. . . .

Purser Price reports that on the way

I seventy-six river steamers, small and
large, ' bound for Dawson. Four were:
'ashore and the Yukoner spent some j
time unsuccessfully endeavoring to |
I draw them from the grip of the sarid- \

J. B. Stlnebaugh relates a very queer
incident of yesterday evenin- b storm.
He, with his wife, sun and daughter, was
at the farm of E. E. Stinebaugh, six
miles south of the city. They were all
out of the buggy except the son, a boy
of 12 years, when a gale of wind caught
the buggy, and tore the harness into
shreds, separating the buggy from the
horse. The buggy, with the boy in it,
shot up into the air several feet and
turned completely over, landing severnl
feet away upon the. ground a mass of
ruins. The boy came down on the top
of woven wire fence, but was uninjured.
Mr. Stinebaugh went out to-day after
what was left of his buggy. Mr. StMie
baugh cays he has had several experi
ences, â with storms and wind, but never
saw anything to equal his experience of
yesterday.âOttawa Herald.

SAN JOSE'S TWO
CONFLAGRATIONS
But One Fatality at the
Hotel Vendome.
â 
FIREMAN MILES M'DERMOTT
THE TWO MEN INJURED WILL
BECOVEB.
Porter Bros.' Fruit Packing Ware
house Totally Destroyed â Loss
Abov.t $30,000â Covered
by Insurance.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 27.â One fireman
killed, three injured and a number of
miraculous escapes are some of the re
sults of the Hotel Vendome fire. An
other . person, a San Francisco
fireman, spending his vacation here,
was also supposed to be burned, but a
thorough search of the debris to-day
failed to discover the body.
The dead man is Miles McDermott, a
member of Eureka Hose Company, who
was carried down when the wing col
lapsed. The body was recovered! about
11 o'clock to-day. Death had resulted
from suffocation. His left hand was
slightly burned. McDermott was 39
years of age, a stone cutter by trade,
and leaves a wife and three children.
He has been a member of the Fire De
partment for a number of years.
Dick Williamson, who was carried
down In the wreck with McDermott,
was secured about 4 o'clock this morn
ing. He had been pinned down oy a
heavy timber. He was thoroughly ex
hausted, but conscious when taken out.
Williamson is badly bruised, but not so
riously.
Jim Nagle was badly burned about
his arms and legs, and Ed Holtz hurt
about the head.
The Hotel Vendome was visited by
thousands to-day. The popular sum
mer resort presented a dreary appear
ance. The north and south wings and
main building are thoroughly soaked
with water and the carpets and ceilings
badly damaged. It is now estimated
the loss will reach $65,000. The wing
destroyed will be rebuilt at once.
The fruit packing warehouse of Por
ter Bros, on North First street, adjoin
ing the broad gauge freight yard, was
totally destroyed by lire shortly after
4 o'clock a. m. This lire coming right
upon the Hotel Vendome conflagration
was a severe strain upon the firemen,
who made a gallant fight and did ex
cellent service, although nearly ex
hausted. The flames broke out in the
drying room on the top floor and it is
thought ignited from flying embers.
The building was entirely of wood and
was soon destroyed. The loss Is $30,
000, covered by insurance. About 250
tons of dried primes in the place, val
ued at $15,000, were destroyed. The loss
on the building and machinery was
about the same. The packing house
will be rebuilt at once. Pending the
erection of the building Porter Bros,
have secured the old Garden City Pack
ing Company's buildings.
PRECAUTIONS AGAINST
FLOODS IN YOLO COUNTY
Army of Men Employed in Strength
ening the Levees Along the
River.
WOODLAND, Sept. 27.â The work of
river Improvement Is making satisfactory
progress. The concrete easement, above
Elkhorn, will be completed about the
first of October. Experts say this is the
best piece of public work of the kind in
the State.
The levee work is being pushed with
all possible expedition. The only thing
that now stands in the way of 'a thor
ough protection of the channel as well as
the adjacent lands, so far as Yolo Coun
ty is concerned, is the Woods break. No
flood that may result from the break at
that point can affect the easement; that
Is a permanent Improvement. If Yolo
County is damaged by floods this winter
the responsibility must rest with a few
land owners who are well able to sup
piement the work of the State.
In the sink of Cache Creek, in this
county, Sam Montgomery, who has the
contract lor putting In the brush mat
tresses and rock ballast of the jetty
work at Kewtown shoals, has 100 men at
work cutting brush and binding fascines.
He already has 3500 cords on the river
bank, but 4000 cords will be necessary to
complete the contract. Barges will begin
the work of transporting the fascines this
week.
The contractor is making very satis
factory progress in driving the piles at
the shoals. The indications aro therefore
excellent that the work at the shoals will
be completed in ample time to get the
good results of the first freshet. It will
be known before the Legislature meets
whether or not this work is going to
accomplish all the engineers claim for it.
PLENTY OF PRUNES LEFT.
Porter Bros.' Loss by Fire Will Not
Affect the Market.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 27.â Colonel Philo Her
sey, the presfdent of the Santa Clara
Fruit Exchange, stated this evening that
the destruction of Porter Brothers' pack-
Ing house with 250 tons of drieu prunes
would not affect the market any, but may
inconvenience the firm somewhat. They
have already sold a quantity, but there
are plenty of prunes left to till all orders.
The fire consumed about twenty-five cars
of twelve tons each, but this was a very
small portion of Santa Clara County's
crop.
Rain has affected the market more than
the fire, as many prunes are still on trays.
Some damage in this respect was done,
but Colonel Hersey could not say just how
much. The prune market now Is firm and
good, with prices stationary. There is a
prospect of an Increase In the prices of
some of the large sizes, but all depends
on the Christmas trade.

THE HALL OF JUSTICE.
AT Monday's meeting the Board of Supervisors
by resolution extended the time during which
the contractors may complete their work on
the Hall of Justice to January, i, 1899. The contract
called fora finished structure on Saturday next. Not
only is the building still fat from completion, but if
the contractors .were to prosecute their work dili
gently from now on they, could not finish it under
six or eight months. The extension of time to Jan
uary r, consequently, is nothing more than an effort
to suspend public criticism for a few days longer. It
does not mean that work on the Hall of Justice is
going to be prosecuted. .
Up to the present time all. indications point to the
conclusion that the contractors do not intend to
carry out their agreement. They have already con
sumed more time on the building than would have
been necessary to construct half a dozen equally as
imposing structures. It is proper, therefore, in view
of the fact that a municipal campaign is in progress,
to suggest that measures be taken either to force the
execution of this contract or to deprive the contract
ors of the further privilege of deluding the public.
The property-owners in the. vicinity of Washington
and Kearny streets, if not the people at large, have
rights which should be respected and which demand
attention. :
Why would it not be a good idea for the Repub
lican municipal convention no -a- in session to treat
of the subject in its platform? A plank could be
drawn denouncing the present Democratic Super
visors for trifling with the interests of the city in this
matter, pledging the Republican candidates about to
be nominated to grant Baterhan Brothers no more ex
tensions, and declaring in favor of the forfeiture of
their rights under the contract unless the Hall of
Justice is rushed to Completion. We have no doubt
that such a plank would draw. to the Republican Su
pervisorial candidates, the votes of a large portion of
the population in the vicinity of. Montgomery avenue
Bnd at North Beach.
There seems to be no other way in which to bring
these contractors to time. They obtained the award
for this work in 1895. It is now about three years
since the old City Hall was torn dow ; n and the
foundations of the new structure " elaborately laid.
Yet at the prevailing, rate, of progress from ten to
fifteen years more will be consumed in bringing the
building to completion.
There is no disposition to be unreasonable with
these contractors, and vve believe the Supervisors have
already been more than lenient with them. But the
public is interested in the completion of the. Hall of
Justice, and the work should be prosecuted with at
least ordinary diligence. A platform pledge would be
a rational way out of the difficulty! On January 1,
when the new Supervisors, take office, they, could en
force the law and take the contract -away from â  its
present holders, enforcing such penalties and for :
feitures as might then seem to be just. . . â  .
POLICE COURT DIGNITY.
APPARENTLY in the relations existing be
tween Police Judges Mogan and Low. there is
an absence of that brotherly love Â«so sweet to
behold and which we are told to let continue.
Is it not possible that m expressing opinions of each
other the Police Judges lose time? Any unprejudiced
observer will concede that the opinions are not of
great value. Nobody really cares whether Low.ad
mires Mogan. and the Mogan "soul yearns respon
sivel-y for b*nign comradeship. On the, other hand,
if one regards the other as a no such thing, and an in
terchange of this view be regarded as necessary,
there would be no pining were the jurists to meet in
some secluded corridor and come to- a settlement ac
cording to Quecnsberry rules, publishing only the
rerdict. .....
Police: Judges have enough to do without pausing
to express sentiments mutually detrimental.- They
have to punish the vagrant, reprove the man who has
acquired a jag, give sage advke. impose uncollect
ible fines, accept straw bonds, denounce the straw
bondsman, and. accept his offering at eacja recurring
opportunity. They have their political fences to
mend. It is their duty. while off the bench to get
around among the "push", and urge their right to
another term. All this is recogn.ized. It goes with
the position. â  . . â¢
But the gentlemen shouldnof openly quarrel. To
do so detracts from the dignity of the woolsack. It
gives the impression that, after all. Police .Court
Judges are only human.' After, a while people will
cease to regard them with awe. Mogan and Low
ought to bury their little hatchets. Only one' person
ever made a good record with a hatchet, and he did
jjot do it by whacking at a Police Judge.
Still, the public is left in the dark as to whether a
policeman who runs away- from danger is a coward.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1898.
SILVER LOST IN THE SHUFFLE.
JUDGE MAGUIRE is the candidate of a fusion
of three parties. The common ground on which
they meet, the cement which holds together
these incongruous and unadapted angles, is the free
coinage of silver at 16 to i. The Silver Republicans
are protectionists. The Populists are income taxers.
Maguire is a single taxer. These several principles
of the fusion trinity are at war. On them the par
ties to the pinto ticket cannot meet on common
ground. It is equally true that they cannot get to
gether on the anti-railroad issue. Some of the most
ardent Silver Republicans are railroad men. Some
of the Populists are at peace with the Southern Pa
cific. On this issue the trinity divides as it does on
taxation. The three-headed party is at peace with
itself on one issue alone, and that is free silver.
This being true, why does not the candidate of the
fusion support the terms of the treaty which made him
a candidate? Why does he not expound free silver
in his campaign?
A reference to the discussions which preceded fusion
shows that free silver was the reason for which fu
sion was urged. That was the cement that fastened
the piece oi political crackle ware together. It was
the shibboleth which every politician had to mumble.
But where is it now? It has faded and disappeared,
and Judge Maguire is out seeking office as an ariti
railroad candidate, pounding the same thrashed straw
and making the old stock promises which have been
on the market for thirty years.
Why is such an issue still alive? In 1882 Stoneman
was elected on that issue, and won by promising to
settle it. At the end of his term the same old promise
was put in issue, unredeemed. Four years ago it was
renewed. Every stump rang with it. Maguire's party
won on it, electing a Governor and a majority of the
Railroad Commission. Yet, if we are to believe the
fusion candidate, nothing has been done, and the
burning issue is still burning. Since 1882 the Demo
cratic party has had full power, repeatedly, in the
executive and legislative branches of the State govern
ment, and has always gone into power on the same
extreme promise which it makes now, and has done
nothing. If there be an issue which justifies such
prominence in every campaign, it should be settled.
If it is not settled and ended by those who so per
sistently raise it, two presumptions of fact are cre
ated â one, that the issue is not to be adjusted by
politics; the other that those who so continually
make it and get from the people the power to settle
it neglect that duty in order that the railroad issue
may remain to be the means of getting power again,
to betray the promises by which it is obtained. While
this policy of promise and betrayal on the railroad
issue goes on and on, in every Democratic conven
tion, platform and campaign; while the candidates of
that party charge that the railroad owns the Republi
cans before election, it must be true that the rail
road owns the Democrats after election, for they have
not hurt nor harmed it when in power. Meantime the
railroad issue, in whatever form it is presented, is
settling itself. The issue raised on the funding of the
debt of the Central Pacific was settled by Democratic
Senator Morgan, with the approval of every Populist
arid Democrat in the United States Senate.
The internal issue in this State, involving freights
and fares, has been settled for the whole route from
San Francisco to Bakersfield by the Valley Road, and
as an overland problem by the connection made by
that line with a rival and competing overland system
across the Tehachapi. We call the attention of the
business and producing community to this fact, and
to the further fact that politics, Democratic politics, in
California having failed miserably and perhaps cor
ruptly to settle the railroad issue, it has been taken
out of politics and subjected to a business settlement
by the enterprise and energy and faith of business
men.
The raising of the railroad issue made the Southern
Pacific a mighty political power. Of it might have
been said, "It saith to one man go, and he goeth,
and to another come, and he comcth," but that day
is past.
The Democrats who have got office on the railroad
issue, and the Southern Pacific, which took them into
its tepee after election, will see those fair, fat days no
more. They will not again execute the war dance
in public and the corn dance in private together.
These things will have for them in the future only the
pleasures of memory. The Valley Road blows a new
tune on a new whistle from the bay to Kern River,
and will soon wake the echoes across the mountains.
The Southern Pacific must hereafter reckon with a
competitor, and must quit politics and go to rail
roading.
These being the facts of the situation, Judge Ma
guire should keep his bargains with the three par
ties which he represents, and as they fused on silver,
he should line the cloud that hangs over him with
that metal at once.
c NEW FRENCH REVOLUTION
BY the cheers which greeted the announcement
that the Brisson Ministry had decided upon a re
vision of the Dreyfus trial, evidence was given
of the accomplishment in Paris of another revolution.
It has been a moral revolution this time, and was
achieved without insurrection and street fighting, but
is none the less as important as some of those which
in the past were accomplished only by bloodshed and
the overthrow of governments and dynasties.
It has been apparent for some years that the
stability ot the French republic is no longer seriously
menaced by imperialists or monarchists; by Bona
partes or Bourbons. The menace has come from the
army, and. the threatening danger has been that of
excessive militarism. Once it raised its head under
the lead of the popular hero, Boulanger, and for a
time a dictatorship was imminent. With the over
throw of that half-farcical would-be Napoleon, the
republic recovered her equipoise and settled herself
to some years of peace. The higher officers of the
army, however, collected their strength, extended
their power, and little by little assumed a dominant
position in the nation, founded partly upon the in
herent strength of the army itself, but mainly upon the
patriotic loyalty with which the French people re
gard the army and its commanders.
Not long ago it was a common saying, "France is
nothing but an army." It was believed that no
power existed in the country strong enough to con
front and. oppose the military, party on any important
proposition.. The test came when the military author
ities after a secret trial, conducted, as it appears, in
violation of the rights guaranteed by the law to all
accused persons, condemned Dreyfus to life impris
onment and exile. A few brave spirits took up the
cause of the condemned man and began the agita
tion which has since become worldwide in its effects.
The fight for Dreyfus was an appeal to public
opinion against excessive militarism. It was the sec
ond trial of strength on the part of the republic
against the army she sustains in peace, and which in
turn must sustain her in war. This second struggle
was much harder than that waged in opposition to
Boulanger. At the start the people were persuaded
that the honor of the army was at stake, and their
pride in it was aroused to a bitter antagonism toward
all who opposed what had been done by the War De
partment. There was prejudice and natural patriot
ism to be overcome before the victory could be
gained for justice and for liberty.
It now appears that the struggle is virtually over
and militarism has been defeated. The republic has
been vindicated by its citizens. France has achieved
a conquest of her prejudices, and may well rank it
among the most important of her revolutions.
COLIFORNIAN CONGRESSMEN.
IN the current number of the Merchants' Associa
tion Review, Mr. John E. Quinn, in commenting
upon a lack of attention to the interests of Cali
fornia on the part of the National Government, says:
"The writer has often been at a loss to know what
this State would lose if we had no representatives at
Washington. It is true that many things might be
accomplished if energetic men represented California
at the National Capitol â men who would be a unit
in demanding the rights of the State from the General
Government. Senators and Representatives of other
States gecure valuable legislation for needed public
improvements, and California, as a large contributor
to the national treasury, is justly entitled to equal con
sideration."
The complaint thus formulated against the services
of our Representatives in Congress is hardly just. It
is true the interests of the State have been neglected
and that much we have a right to expect from the
National Government has been denied us. The ap
propriations for the improvement of our largest rivers
and harbors have been slight in comparison with
those made for insignificant ports and streams in the
Eastern States. The neglect and comparative par
simony, however, have not been due wholly to our
Congressmen. Our Â«people are themselves largely to
blame in the matter.
The prestige in Congress of the representation of
any particular State is dependent mainly upon the
length of service in the House or the Senate of the
members who make up the representation. For the
attainment of influence in either branch of Congress
there is needed experience, as well as ability and fidel
ity. In the making up of the appropriation bills it is
the member who has the greater number of influen
tial friends who is the most likely to obtain a full re
cognition of the needs of his district. The new and
unknown member of Congress is heavily handicapped
in all contests of the kind against an older member
who, by reason of favors granted others in the past,
successfully chims their support for his measures in
turn.
The people of the Fifth District have had the wis
dom to repeatedly re-elect Mr. Loud, and as a result
they have the reward of being served now by one of
the most influential of the younger members of the
House. Mr. Loud, has attained one of the most im
portant chairmanships, and is in a position to ma
terially serve his constituents. That service has been
given faithfully, and the results have been highly ben
eficial, not only to his own district, but to the whole
State.
The moral of the situation is too plain to be mis
taken. If all the Congressional districts of California
would follow the example of the Fifth and return to
Congress term after term a steadfast upholder of pro
tection, sound money and the true interests of the
people and the nation, California woufd soon have no
cause to complain that her representation in Con
gress is useless and that the National Government
neglects her interests.
THE RIGHT WAY ABOUT IT.
1 \EPORTS from Washington are to the effect
kâ s that the commission appointed to investigate
* * the conduct of the war has decided to summon
persons professing to have information on the sub
ject to give evidence. It appears that quite a number
of letters of complaint from various quarters have
been received, all of them being vague in their state
ments. The writers are to be requested to formulate
their complaints into specific charges, if they can, and
those who do so will then be called upon to prove
what they have asserted.
This is a move in the right direction. The country
will be glad to have the charges made against the
War Department and the officers of the army inves
tigated fully. That the soldiers in the various camps
underwent more or less hardship is beyond question.
It was inevitable that it should be so. There are
ample reasons, however, for believing that all of the
more sensational reports, out of which the yellow
press and the fusion demagogues have been trying for
the last month to make political capital against the
administration and the army, have been either exag
gerations or downright lies. It is, therefore, gratify
ing to learn that at least some of the authors of these
lurid and harrowing stories may be called upon to
make good their words before the commission. We
shall see how many of them will appear and how
many of their reports will prove to have been well
founded.
This determination on the part of the commission
gives promise that the scope ofrthe investigation will
be as wide as the President recommended. All the
issues involved in the conduct of the army from the
outbreak of hostilities will be taken up, and full and
searching inquiries be made concerning them; We
shall learn from the evidence to be thus obtained
in what respects our war administration falls short of
what it should be, and thus be instructed as to. the
points in which our military system needs reform.
That will be the most important result of the inquiry,
but it will not overshadow in the public mind the
other result to be expected when the vociferous howl
ers against the army and the Secretary of War are
called upon to make their charges specific and then
prove them.
THE UNITED STATES "ARE."
WITH a sageness which beseems a thinker the
Post asks that The Call point out some para
graph in the constitution wherein occurs the
expression "The United States are." The Call is un
able now to do so, not having the constitution ty
heart. The point at issue is merely as to whether "The
United States" is a term to be regarded as singular
or as plural. In section % Article 111, of the constitu
tion may be found the following: "Treason against
the United States shall consist only in levying war
against them, or adhering to their enemies."
In the thirteenth amendment is this: "Neither
slavery nor involuntary servitude * * * shall ex
ist within the United States or any place subject to
their jurisdiction."
It appears to us that the little Post is sufficiently
answered. The United States, however single of pur
pose, are plural. The matter is a simple one of
arithmetic.
Spain's Commissioners have been instructed to con
tend strongly for the preservation of Spanish sov
ereignty in the Philippines. It is believed, however,
that the really influential instructions concerning this
matter will be those sent from Washington.
It is generally believed that Nat Goodwin broke his
leg for theatrical purposes only.
HE WILL SEEK FAME
WITH THE FRAWLEYS
AS a usual thing it Is the society girl who electrifies her circle by de
serting home, mother and cotillons for the stage. But this time it is
a society man, and a married man at that, who has succumbed to the
attraction of the calcium. 'v
Frank Mathleu, social light, club mart, dilettante actor, husband, book
keeper for the Sperry Flour Company, and twice a father, will forsake
the passive pleasures of commerce, society and domesticity to join the
Frawley Company. He will make his first professional appearance at the
Baldwin Theater week after next as the impetuous young fisherman in
"The Dancing Girl." Needless to say fashion, and clubdom will be on
hand to see how he does it. There seems to have been an Inevitable afflnr
lty between Mr. Mathieu and the stage. Ten years ago, when a student at
Trinity College, he was a leading spirit in the academic theatricals then in
vogue, and ever since his graduation he has been an important figure In
the various amateur performances given in San Franclpco. When Miss
Blanche Bates was an amateur Mr. Mathieu was usually her "opposite"
in the cast, and, like Miss Bates, he always felt an inclination for the
professional stage.
Although for years commercial life, marriage and offspring and : their
obligations kept him from his ambition, he was only waiting for the
right chance to come along. Now Mr. Frawley offers him the chance and
he takes it.
As an amateur Frank Mathieu has long, ranked the cleverest in San
Francisco. He has a fine, cultivated personality and the face and phy
sique of one of Gibson's men. His work as an amateur has always been
easy and convincing and free in action, and it is not unsafe to predict
success for him in the important parts that he will have this season with
the Frawley Company.

THE SLIP OF PAPER AT BLENHEIM
HO.t'SE.
Among the historical treasures of Blen
heim House is a slip of paper on which
are scribbled a dozen lines In pencil.
Those lines were written by the Duke of
Marlborough at th>Â» close of the fierce
death-wrestle at Blenheim. The tumult
of battle was rolling westward, where
Flinch and Bavarians were In disordered
retraftt, with Marlborough'B cavalry rid
ing fiercely on their rear. The smoke of
the great fight yet hung black in the
heavens. The slopes of the hills to the
right, where Prince Eugene had four
times over made his fiery onset, and the
marshy plain in the center where Marl
borough himself, by a cavalry charge
worthy of Murat-8000 cavalry joined in
one furious onset of galloping hoofsâ had
broken through the French center, were
strewn with nearly 30.000 killed and
wounded. But Marlborough, with the
rapture of the great fight still dancing
in his blood, pulled up his horse on one
of the little rustic bridges across the

A CARRIED WOMAN'S RIGHTSâ E.
G., Hornitos, Cal. Amarried woman who
came to the United States twenty-two
years ago from a foreign country and
Whose husband' was naturalized a citizen
of the United States prior to her arrival
became, by the act of her husband, a citi

act of her husband become a citizen she
need not go through the form of natural
ization to take up a mining location.
Lindley on Mines says: "Neither age
nor sex is. mentioned in the definition of
the word citizen, it therefore includes
men, women and children." It follows
that a married wanian who is a citizen
can take up a mining claim. Section 2319
of the Revised Statutes says: "All valu
able mineral deposits in lands belonging
to the United States, both surveyed and
unsurveyed, are hereby declared to be
free and open to exploration and pur
chase, and the lands in which they are
found to occupation and purchase by citi
zens of the Lnited States and those who
have declared their intention to become
such, under regulations proclaimed by
law and according to the local customs
or rules of miners in the several mining

I SUSTAINED BY
THE GRAND JURY
The Harbor Commissioners and
Arch itect Amenable for Ferry
Depot Frauds.
The State Was Systematically Swindled by
Changing Specifications so as to Favor
the Contractors.
The Grand Jury reports that it has thorough ly investigated the alleged (
frauds in connection with the construction of the Union Depot and Ferry House <
and finds that there was gross mismanagement on the part of the supervising (
architect and the Harbor Commissioners; that they favored the contractors at
the expense of the State in a most suspicious manner. The Jury pauses without (
finding any indictments to allow the newly appointed State Investigating Board to \
go over all the ground, with the assistance of experts and money â , to exhaustively <
investigate, which the Grand Jury lacks. Indictments may be returned later. (
Laic yesterday afternoon the Grand
Jury made an exhaustive report to
Presiding Judge Belcher concerning its
investigations into the alleged frauds
in connection with the construction of
the Union Depot and Ferry House. The
report covered, some sixty sheets anil
was closely type-written, giving at the
outset a synopsis of the work per
formed and the conclusions reached
and following with a detailed state r
ment of the testimony and. evidence
presented by various experts employed-
Th.- report was a most dahl.iging one
to the Harbor Commissioners and to
the supervising architect, stating that
i tany flagrant departures had been
made from the original ..specifications
for the structure and in almost every
case the changes were to the advantage
of the contractors, cheapening ma
terial and work. The jury scored a
decisive" point by having a section of
wall constructed according, to specifi
cations, which was far superior to the
vail of the building as erected by the
contractors with the consent of -the
commissioners and the architect.
When the jury filed into court about
3:45 p. in. there were few spectators
present, no word having gone abroad
that a report was to be made. The
foreman, M. H. Hecht, made a prelimi
nary statement to th^. Judge to the -ef
fect that the Grand Jury had reached a
point in its proceedings where it. felt
that it must pause. An Investigation
of the Union Depot and Ferry House
matter had been carried to considerable
length, but the present limit of.pro-
ct-dure had been reached. No indict
ments were returned.
Judge Belcher, after, listening to the
foreman's remarks,, called his attention'
to the court's charge delivered to the
jury on May 21, wherein he expressly
stated that if the public officials conr
cerned were guilty they ought to- be'
indicted at once. The Judge said that
he had no power to order the. Grand
Jury io indict; that the limit of his
power was to uirect attention to alleged
wrong-doing and leave the Jury ns a
body to deal with it as seemed best: I

Jury was praised by the Judge for- its
thoroughness and exhaustive character,

SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.. Sept. 27.
To His Honor E. A. Belcher, Presiding
Judge: The matter of the alleged frauds
In the construction of the Union Dep.ot
and Ferry House, situated in the City and
County of San Francisco, having been re
ferred to this Grand Jury In your Honor's
charge on May 21, IS9S, we beg to submit
the following report:
We have been <lilig*Â»nt'y engaged* in
this work since the organization of the
jury. "We have had the assistance of a
thoroughly competent and disinterested
'expert in work of this kind, to whose
complete and careful reports llttached
hereto we make reference.
The original plans and specifications
prepared by the late A. Page Brown and.
accepted as eminently proper and com
plete have in ma.ny Instances been de
viated from. In fact, the character of
the-work in somÂ« important features has
been entirely, changed. .
" Many of these changes are, iÂ» our
judgment, unnecessary and unwar
ranted, some of them involved the
use of cheaper materials and less la
bor than were necessary under orig

IKTENSE SUFFERING
From Dyspepsia and Stomach
Trouble.
Instantly Relieved and Perma-
nently Cured by Stuart's Dys-
pepsta Tablets.
A New Discovery, but Not a Patent
Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an interesting ac-
count <>f what he considers a remarkable
cure of acute stomach trouble and chronic
dyspepsia by the use of the new discov-
ery. Stuart' a Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: The patient was a man who
hud suffered to my knowledge for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate
seemed to sour a-nd create acid and gases
in the stomach; he had pains like rheu-
matism in the back, shoulder Wades and
limbs, fullness and distress after eating,
poor appetite and lr.ps of nesh: the heart
became affected, causing palpitation and
sleeplessness at night.
I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As an
experiment I finally bought a fifty-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
a drug store and pava them to him. Al-
most immediate relief wai< given and after
be had used f"ur lmxos he was to all ap-
pearances fully cured.
There was no more acidity or sour wat-
ery risings, no bloating after meals, the
appetite was vigorous and he has gained
between 10 and 12 pounds in weight of
solid, healthy fl<sh.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold in drug stoms, yet
I consider them a most valuable addition
to any physician's line of remedies, as
they are perfectly harmless and cun be
given to children or invalids or in any
condition of the stomach with perfect
safety; being harmless and containing
nothing but vegetable and fruit essences,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
Without any question they are the saf-
est, most effective cure for indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are made by
the Stuart Co. of Marshall, Mich., and
sold by druggists everywhere at fifty
cents per package.
Little book on stomach diseases mailed
free. Address Stuart Co., Marshall; Mich.
inal specifications, and it does Hot ap
pear, to us that the State received suffi
cient alloAvanee for such alterations.
A- careful examination made by our
expert of three contracts shows that

omitted and insufficient allowance
made to the. State therefor, a loss to
the State of about 351,500 in value,
withotit considering the quality of
the work done, viz., masonry con
tract, $30,000; galvanized iron con
tract, $6*500;. woodwork contract,
$15,000. Total, $51,500.
To say the leaÃt, the changes made
in the above contract and the allow
ances or payments made therefor do"
not Indicate careful business, judgment
on the part of the Harbor Commis
sioners and the supervising architect,
but on the contrary show in several in
stances a gross' neglect of the State's
interests.
We respectfully, submit that the Har
bor Commissioners having this work lri
charge, . while not exceeding the au
thority given them under the plans and
j specifications, did not prosecute the
work with the same energy, judgment
and economy that is usually displayed
by individual owners and which
should be displayed by public officials.
If the plans and specifications had
been so drawn that no authority had
been vested in the Harbor Commis
sioners or architect to make these, or
any changes, the State would, in our
judgment, have received a better
structure for the money spent.
Referring to the detailed reports of
our expert attached hereto, we are sat
isfied that his estimates are very con
servative. The prices at which he
has calculated the value of the work
omitted and added have been sub
mitted to several leading architects of
this city and authority has been given
by these professional gentlemen to
state in their Judgment these prices are
fair and reasunable.
Further, 5 per cent is allowed as con
tractor's profit on work omitted â 1. c.,
only 95 per cent deducted, and 10 per
cent contractor's profit allowed on work
added or extra.
We refer briefly to a few points
treated at length in the reports at
tached.
The original specifications for galva
nized iron work called for and exactly
described a method of attaching the
galvanized Iron sheets to the metal
framing, which would have resulted In
a first-class Job. There was no at
j tempt made to even partially adhere to
| the specifications. The supervising ,
I architect, on the ground that it would
: be impossible to do the work as spe
cified, directed the contractor, Wil- j
Ham Green, to do the work in a man
: ncr greatly inferior to the original
plan, and much less costly to the con
tractor. In fact, it would be hard to
find a cheaper way of attaching the
galvanized iron than that which has
been adopted, while it would be equal
ly hard to find a more expensive
method than that described In the spe
cifications and contracted for and paid
for no allowance in price as yet hav
ing been made for the change. The
contractor, Mr. Cronan, testified before
this Jury that when he bid on this work
he did not figure on doing this portion
of it according to specifications, and
that some one In the office of the late
architect, A. Page Brown, had told him
It would not be required of him.
Further, the State paid the sum of
$2230 for additional wood furring put
in" to enable the galvanized iron con- i
tractor to use the cheaper method. The
use of wood also reduces the fire-proof
quality of the work. On these points
the report of our expert Is confirmed
by two competent witnesses, whose
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1898.
testimony is attached. In addition, and
to test the question of the practica
bility of doing .his work as speci
fied, we have had a piece of wall con
structed exactly according to the spe
cifications, and exactly as the work
at the Union Depot and ferry house
should have. been done.
This piece is not a model only, but
is of sufficient size to show that there
are no difficulties in doing such work
that, cannot be overcome by ordinary
mechanical skill. This piece can be
exhibited to your Honor at any time.
The finishing of the mezzanine story
has been entirely omitted.
The change in floor construction was
a. very radical one, and was of doubt
ful expediency. . . â 
The soffits of steel girders are ex
posed, and are not covered with fire
proof material. as provided for in the
contract. .
The soffits of bridges are not yet en
closed wjth sheathing, and the floor tim
bers, remain exposed.
The first story ceiling under the gal
lery is not yet plastered. . â¢
â No attempt has been made at com
plying with the specifications in these,
particulars. 'â  â  â  â¢ .
We call attention to the fact that in
making changes various kinds of work
have been so mixed together that it
has been more difficult to locate value*
than if a careful segregation of changes
and values, had been made.
We understand that all contracts
amounting to $3000 require bids, and
in this connection we note extras as

In several cases, payments for
chnnpes have been made out of a fund
other than that provided for the Union
Depot arid ferry house.
The Harbor Commissioners and
I supervising architect had full power
; to enforce the contracts strictly; all
changes were apparently made under
their direction, and blame cannot be
transferred to the contractors if they
I carried out instructions.
From the nature of the case a proper
I investigation of such matters as this
j Union Depot and ferry house can only
be made with the assistance of compe-
I tent experts, and we are unable, to our
: . great regret, to investigate all the con
tracts in the building construction, be
i cause of the totally inadequate amount
|of money at our disposal. As a sug
| gestion of how much work should be
I done in this direction, we submit here
with a report made to this Grand Jury
by the Han t rancisco Chapter of the
: American Institute of Architects.
We are convinced from our investl
â¢ gatlon of three important contracts
; that the whole matter merits a most
â  searching scrutiny by somebody clothed
] with sufficient authority and provided
with sufficient means to make such
I inquiry effectively.
We. learn by the appended letter from
I his Excellency, the Governor of this
! State, written in reply to our inquiry.
i that at. the thirty-second session of the
i Legislature a committee was appointed
! to Investigate State institutions, con
sisting of Senator J. H. Dickinson. San.
FranriÃcp, chairman; Senator W. F.
Prisk, Grass Valley; Senator E, W.
! Chapman, El Dorado County; Senator
j J. J. Boyce, Santa Barbara County, and
Senator C. If. Simpson, Pasadena.
Inasmuch as this committee has
commenced an independent Investiga
tion of the construction of the Union
Depot and ferry house, and has at Its
disposal the means which the Grand
Jury lacks, we have deemed it wise
to let our investigation rest at this
point, and see If the above committee
does not cover all the ground.
In conclusion wo beg to say that
while we do not ilnd proofs of tangi
ble fraud that warrant us In making
formal charges, we cannot consider the
matters covered by this report with
out grave suspicions arising that those
in control of the Union Depot and
ferry house structure have not been
loyal to the interests of the State.
Respectfully submitted.
M. H. HECHT. Foreman.

Mr. Wright gave It as his opinion
that Colusa stone, which was sub
stituted for Oregon stone, Is about as
good as Oregon, but not as expensive.
The successful contractor bid $218,000
for furnishing "Nevada" stone and
$230,000 for "Oregon," the latter being
accepted. This contract was made on
January 23,. 1896, and on April 10 Colusa
was substituted. The question arises,
did the Harbor Commissioners have
any idea of using "Colusa." when they
accepted the contract and if so why
did they not accept the lower bid? The
substitution of "Colusa" could have
been made as well. The fact that a
bid was received, based on Colusa
amounting to some $53,000 more than
the accepted bid cannot be used to
prove anything in relation to any other
bid.

â¢ There a big political, sensation on the
tapis.: The knowing; ones state, that, the
Grand Jury, has undertaken to investi
gate the whole'sule registration frauds
perpetrated recently . and to fix a crimi
nal responsibility, upon certain precinct

alleged that the glaring registration ir
regularities in the Ninth Precinct of the
'. Forty-third District,- where two big col
onies of illegal voters were found located.'
alongside the registration booth,. are. re
ceived such a searching, inquiry ' .that
something is bound to come of it.
The' first rumor that the Grand jury
was snuffing at', the registration frauds
received added .Impetus' yesterday after
noon, when Foreman Hecht was observed
slipping out of Registrar Biggy's office
with several bulky envelopes in his -hand.
The Registrar- when questioned . refused
to give any. information,. merely stating
that Mr. Hecht'scall was on a little pri
vate business. The fact- that certain in
formation went to the Grand Jury is out,
however, ' and there . is no doubt that a
shaking, up of certain crooked politicians
is close at hand. One -prominent Demo
crat is known' to be on the ragged edgÂ«.
of an indictment. .. ' ... â¢ . "
. The cause for. the Grand Jury's action
is not hard to find. The' recent registra
tion of voters, while smaller than in pre-.
vious years, was, nevertheless, ' consider
ably stuffed, and since Registrar Blggy
has been at work purging nearly 1000. Il
legal registrations have been discovered.'
In most cases â¢ fictitious voters were
grouped in certain precincts. and It soon
became a matter of common report that
those precinct registers had been stuffed. â 
â One significant feature of the situation
was also quickly discerned, and that was.
that the Illegal registrations had. In al-.
most every case, been made at the. pre
cinct booths and. not at the central reg
istration office in the city building. This
fact developed' a well-grounded suspicion
that local registration boards had a
guilty knowledge of the frauds and the
Grand Jury, having its official eyes wide
open; was not- slow in ' considering the
.matter of a thorough Investigation.
Just how far this work has progressed
is not known at present on the -outside,
but it Is predicted that rapid progress â 
will be made now that the report on the

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 27.â Transactions In the
railway and miscellaneous markets showed a
better distribution to-day and the railway mar
kets assumed more prominence in the . trading
than for Borne time. â  Speculative sentiment be
came decidedly bearish over night and the
bears adopted what appeared to be a well
outlined plan during the day.. Tobacco' was
â utilized as a lever to initiate the : drive," but
after the price' was Jammed down 5% points
to 132% the stock' met support and recovered
materially.- The bulls endeavored to stem the'
downward rush, by working 'up .Sugar â¢ and
Metropolitan and succeeded in 'steadying- the
list. The bears, finding considerable opposition
in .Tobacco, turned their attention to Sugar,
and after creating -demoralization there took
the other prominent specialties into camp one
after the other and soon had- prices tumbling
all around: The tactics of the bear faction dis
concerted the bulls, who, after apparently ar
resting the .decline and forcing a rally in a
leader, -had to me.et' fresh assaults on- another
Block, with the result that th" momentary ad
vance was soon lost. Humors concerning in
dividual properties were, set afloat and con
siderable discussion " aroused over the move
ment in Tobacco. The generally accepted
theory was that some powerful interest was
letting go -an extensive line of. stock and the
absence of-. demand for the. enormous .blocks
offered during the. -past few:' days facilitated
the efforts of the shorts. Operations .In the in
dustrials were conducted with considerable
confidence .by the bear contingent and their
euccess .reaching stop-Joss orders encouraged
them to attack the railways.'. ' Northern Pa
' cific, in which dealings have, been oh a large
scale recently, was picked out and a two
point break followed. 'A liberal amount of
long Etocl: from tired holders came out in the'
grangers and the trading became quite ex
cited during an interval in the afternoon. The
list steadied occasionally, but any attempt to
boost prices was accompanied .by semi-stagna
â¢ tion. Late in the day prices hardened .on the
August statement of " the . Northern. Pacific,
â which showed an increase in the total net in-,
come of $217,543. .Atchlson's report for the
same period, w.hlch developed later, .indicated
a falling off in the net earnings of 1438,720.
and the bears renewed the attack with final
prices at about the lowest. Sugar, after im
proving to 121%, encountered heavy realizing
â  orders, and on the way. down- considerable
stock came out around the even figures, which
eventually put the -price tor 117%. .Subsequent
fluctuations were quite feverish and the stock,
eloped at US. There was "an -absence of news
bearing upon the property aside from the
usual opposition' features. â  ' â¢
The money market was less active to-day
and rates- ruled at 2(!H per cent, with the
minimum figures prevailing at the close. . Time
contracts were without essential, change and
there was a notable: shrinkage in the offerings
of prime mercantile paper.
Operations in bonds were centered among
the usually active issues and prices . fell 'oft
â substantial fractions In some cases. . Total

weakness and the old 4s reacted % per cent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 27.â An advance of %Â®%c
was made at the opening in Wheat, December
starting at 64%@64%c, compared with yester
day's closing price of 64% c. Some irregularity
was shown by the market for a time, trie price
fluctuating between 64%Â®64%c and 64% c as the
demand from shorts, the principal early buy
ers. Increased or diminished, but in the main
the market showed firmness and kept near to
the figures of the opening. The early strength
was due largely to the advance at Liverpool,
where futures were quoted at %#T^d higher.
The bullish feeling was Increased by sea
board reports of a good inquiry for Whe*t for
shipment to the United Kingdom and heavy
acceptances here for prompt shipment. Brad
street's reported the world's visible increase at
2,416,000 bushels. Of this amount 1,900,000 bush
els was' east of the Rockies on this side, and
as yesterday, a decrease of ESO.OOO bushels had
been officially reported, buyers were given a
shock and for a few minutes there was a rush I
of longs to get rid of their Wheat. The price I
was crushed down to 64% c from around 64% c
in this fliirry, but a reaction quickly followed
Instead of following Chicago's lead, New
York and the Northwestern markets became
Btronger than ever, and when thin became ap
parent here another rush followed, this time
to buy back the Wheat so hastily parted with
December climbed to 64%'q64Tic in the scramble
New York reported eighty-one boats worked
for export, which, coming near the end of the
session, was a factor in the strength with
which the market closed. Business was very
active after noon and the total business done
was larger than for some time.
Corn was ina-ctlve but steady up to noon
when the strength and activity of Wheat was
communicated to this market. There was a
good deal of aggressive buying by professional
bulls, forcing, shorts to cover.
Oats were firm but very slow. The market
trailed after Wheat and Corn and developed no
independent features.
Provisions averaged weak and lower. Yellow
fever reports and liberal hog receipts started
the market at a decline. Packers gave the
market fair support for a time and a recovery
ensued, but when this buying stopped prices
quickly declined and the market remained
weak to the close.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

!The Man With Whom the Victim
Quarreled Before Death Has
Not Yet Come
Forward.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
'.â¢â¢ 8 Broadway, Sept. 27.
What has become of the draff for $200
owned by Cleophas Gregoire a few hours
before he died, or was murdered, and
Which is nnw missing?
After BCiveVal days of searching the po
lice have discovered that Greguire. prior
to the tragedy on the lawn in front of
the Taber boarding house on Hobart
street rented a room at the St. Louis Ho
tel on Wetater street, near the water
front. It. had been supposed that when
his room was iciated the overcoat which
he was known to possess would contain
the draft worth $200, but no such docu
ment was found in his room.
V. M. Remillard, president of the brick
company which c-mployed Gregolre, says
that when Grtgoire called at their of
lice he declined to honor the urait, as
he saw plainly the man was not in .his
right senses. He induced him to leave
the office, after advising him to call
around the next day. when the money
w.uld be given to him. Mr. Remillard
r.uticed that when Gregoire left the office
he was carrying a iight overcoat on his
arm, in the pocket of which he placed
the dn
v>ire also carried a pocketbobk
containing several valuable, papers, arid
this pocketbook is also missing from his
overcoat. The police axe trying to dis
cover who abstracted the draft and
whether or not it has been taken across
the bay and casheu, in which event it
will soon return to Mr. Remillard. The
proprietor of the hotel says he knows
nothing of the missing papers, and does
not believe any one has been into Greg
oire's room and stolen them. The fact
the draft was stolen with several valua
ble papers gives more color to the the
ory that Grtgoire did not kill himself
and less to the idea of suicide.
This missing note or the wallet may
have some connection â  with the "con
tract" about which Gregoire was quarrel
ing with some unknown man just prior
to the shooting, as testified. to by Cap
tain Anderson.

ALAMEDA SCANDAL ENDS
A WEALTHY HUSBAND MUST

A Sari Francisco Girl Quickly
Succeeded in Alluring
Him From His
: . ' Home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Sept. 27.
Mrs. Etta Louise Eckley has not been
kept waiting long for her divorce. But a
few days ago she applied to the courts
tor separation from. her husband,, and al
ready her prayer has ibeen granted.
The Eckleys are aa well known as any
of the wealthy people in Alameda, hav
ing a beautiful home and one child. Less
than three years ago they were married,
and the event is yet remembered on ac
count of the social prominence of the par
ties and the special efforts made' to. give
the event significance. Until a year ago
no one knew that the Eckley home was
Hot the happiest on the Encinal. : Then I
little, stories began to be- told, which were I
succeeded by bigger ones, and finally i
Alarrieda society was shocked when it was j
known. th-at John Havemeyer Eckley iiad :
allowed some woman from San Francisco ]
to lure him away from. his wife, home and
child
In her complaint Mrs. Eckley charged
extreme cruelty, but when on the witness
stand this morning before Judge Hall Mrs.
.Eckley testifU-d that a more serious
charge might have been preferred, out
that it was her consideration for the child
that prevented her from putting more al
legations in her complaint. She accused
her husband of taking up with a young
woman in San Franrlsco who had for the
past year been enticing him to desert his
Alameda home. According to her testi
mony Eckley's cruelty began almost as
soon as they- were- married, and she says
that frequently she has been left alone for
ever a month at a time. On one occasion
while she and the child were sick in bed
Ei-kley left the house,- refusing to send a
doctor, and did not return for ten days.
Mrs. William Jones, wife of an Alameda
capitalist and the plaintiff's mother, testi
fied against Eckley. and with W. H. Burn
ham accused hirri of gross- misconduct.
There was no defense made, and Judge
Hall awarded Mrs. Eckley $160 a month
alimony and $500 counsel fees, besides
awarding the custody of the child to lta
mother.
THE WRIT OF HABEAS
CORPUS WAS DENIED
OAKLAND, Sept. %l.â The application
for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of
E. J. Grebs, the socialist arrested for
violating- the ordinance prohibiting street
speeches within the fire limits, was de
nied by Superior Judge Ogden to-day.
â¢ Job H.irriinun, Socialist L<ab6r nomine* i
for Governor, and Attorney C, H. King
of San Francisco appeared for the petU
tioner, while Deputy District Attorney
Harry Meivin appeared for the people. '
Petitioner's attorneys, contended that
the act committed is a natural right \
guaranteed by the â  constitution of the
United States, also by article I, section
10 of the constitution of California,
which guarantees to the people the right
to freely congregate and assemble . to
discuss matters of public interest.
Attorney King regarded the ordinance
as "an. attempt to pilfer away the nat
ural right of every citizen to free
speech." . He contended that the ordi
nance was also unconstitutional for the
reason that the power to adopt It was
not delegated to the City Council.
Judge Ogden. in denying the petition,
however, said that there 1b a modern
tendency to enlarge the scope of police
regulation. The caae of ex-parte Fla
herty, Cal. 105, cited by Attorney Melvln,
he regarded as a good guide in deter- ,
mining the case. In that case the ques-
Bon of delegating power waa decided to
the effect that municipalities may pass
a law requiring persons .to first obtain '.
a permit from the people's authority to
hold certain meetings. "This," said Judge
Ogden. "is not a denial of a right, but
a regulation."
A formal entry of the decision will be
made to-morrow morning, and the caso
will be appealed. . â 
In expression of anticipation Judge
Ogden remarked that the Supreme Court '
would probably hold that the ordinance
In question is a reasonable one, as being
a valid regulation of the use of streets,
passed by the City Council, and which
must therefore be obeyed.
No Hope for Hunt.
OAKLAND, Sept. 27.â Dr. Susan Fenton
has given up hope of restoring to reason
George C. Hunt, the Independent candi- i
date for Sheriff., who went insane last '
Saturday, and to-day Dr. J. M. Self ridge
took the case in hand. To-night it was â 
necessary to strap the patient down and
he will be removed to-morrow either to a ;
Â§rivate sanitarium . at Livermore or to

DIPHTHERIA RESULTS
FROM BAD SEWERAGE
BERKELEY, Sept. West Berkeley .has
now a record of twenty-seven eases of diph
theria which have developed within the last i
cix weeks. This alarming state of affairs- had :
been made the subject of special investigation
by Health Officer Rowell, who- made an extend
ed report upon It at the. regular meeting of the
Board of Trustees held last night. ' Dr. Rowell.
finds that ' the disease Is confined within " the j
limitÃ at the Sixth Ward of the town, and that ,
Its prevalence Is due;' almost .wholly to the j
wretched sanitary condition of the district. He j
urged upon the board the necessity of remedy- i
lhÂ£ the unhealthy state of the place Immediate- !
lv In Eubstance hln report was as follows:
"'The sanitary Inspector and myself have
made an Inspection of the district where diph- |
theria now prevails, and we have found the j
plumbing and sewerage In a aeglected and de
plorable : condition. < In many of the streets
there' are no sewera, and In many of the lew- I
erÂ»Â»d streets the various houses are .- not con- |
' nected One-half the houses within this dis- i
trict have not a sufficient quantity of water
: for sanitary purposes. As the superintendent |
' of the Alameda Water Company assures us
i that there is a sufficient supply of water for
flushing purposes !we would, recommend that
the boo>d order sewers constructed in -the west
Ind where they are necessary, without regard
t"obTect"ns or protests. Within thirty 2ays
: thereafter, according to the terms of the pres
ent ordinance, we will guarantee that all prop

PHELH TELLS
WHY HE WAS
INTERESTED
Appears as a Witness
Against Widber.
IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS
THE DEFENDANT'S MENTAL
CONDITION IN QUESTION.
A Claim to Be Made That He
Was Under the Influence
of Liquor and
Narcotics,
interest in the Widber case shifted yes
terday from the defendant to one of the
witnesses for the prosecution, Mayor
Phelan, who spent the greater part of
yesterday afternoon on the stand.
Mayor Phelan was called by the prose
cution to tell of certain conversations he
had had with the defendant in regard to
the treasury shdrtage, but h<J was not al
lowed to tell them, at least not until the
Sense has had a chance to get in evi
dence to show' that the conversations
were not obtained under circumstances
which make them unavailable as evidence.
The contention of the defense is that the
Mayor had a personal interest in the case
and that he- induced the defendant^ an
swer Questions so as to protect what in
terest the Mayor had and. guard him from
any of the blame that was so freely be
stowed. The defense also wished to show
that no one told Widber that he need not
answer any of .the questions put tohun,
and also that he was not allowed the
privilege of counsel whilo he was being
T\ urtheY contention was made which
might" throw Â«pme light 011 the probaWe
rmirÂ«!o of the defense. Mr. feixotto was>
particular in his cross-examination f tp ask
fhe Mayor what the appearance of the de
fendant was at the time he was .under in
quisition. and then as the Mayor declared |
he thought Widber cool and calm, but a
little" tired, .the defense had to bring it
Â°"'bon't you remember, Mr. Phelan,"
aKked . Peixotto,- "that this defendant
looked as if he was under the influence |
of liquor or some narcotics? **Â°j ,Bal-,, Bal -,
the Mayor, but counsel for the defense j
wÂ£i unwilling to let the question pass
Didn't his eyes look large and staring;
didn't he appear nervous and preoccu
pied- diun't he seem absÂ«nt-minded and
inattentive and the questions only
stopped when the Mayor said he was sure,
nothing was the matter with the prisoner
because of the ready and intelligent an
swers he gave to the questions put .to
Earlier in the day an attempt was made
by the defense to get in a similar bit of
testimony through Charles McUevertv , a
deputy under Widber, who was called to
tell how for the. day preceding his am&t
and for a week before Widber haci been
mentally incapacitated by reason of over
indulgence. Mr. Hosmer objected, how
ever because the evidence was not
proper Irom the defense at that time, and
so the witness had no chance to say what
he knew. It indicates, however, that ther*
may be a plea for insanity included in
the technicalities of the defense.
M de la Montanya was called the ilrst
thing in the morning to finish his testi
mony in regard to the condition of the
coin sacks, the way they had been opened
and the way they had been tied up ngain.
Following him came Mr. BrodencK, the
â¢Auditor, to tell that the report of th*
Treasurer for the month of March last
was made up in Wldber's own handwrit
ing, and that it showed that the funds
were all correct, and that the money was
all in the vaults. Then Louis Jacobs came
to say that he took none of the money
and that he did not know who did. Max
Warschauer swore to the sums set ot
facts, as did also John Broderlck. Henry
Strehl. another deputy, told of the depos- ;
iting of a check made by Widber for
$5000, which was the one referred to by
De la Montanya as being made by Wid
ber to Cover a shortage known at the time
only to De la Montanya.
Mayor Phelan then took the stand and
spent the afternoon there.
Nothing the Mayor had to offer in the
way of testimony seemed to suit the de
fense and so the record for yesterday. aft
ernoon is made up mostly of objections.
The Mayor nad had two con
versations With the prisoner, one
in the office of the Chief of
Police and the other in the County Jail.
To the subject matter of the first one Mr.
Hosmer directed his attention. - Mr.
Peixotto objected because he said it had
not been shown that the replies to ques
tions were voluntary. Then Mr. Hosmer
tried to show that they were voluntary
and Mr. Peixotto objected because he
said the questions and answers them
selvesâwhich he had just ruled out
were the best evidence of the fact of their
character- Nothing daunted, Mr. Hosmer
offered the transcript and again Mr.
Peixotto objected, because; he said, it was
not the proper time" and he wanted to
submit, evidence regarding the conversa
tion before it went. to the Jury. Finally
It was submitted in evidence for the bcne,
fit of the court only until such time as it
is thought proper to bring It before the
juryâ that Is. If. Mr. Peixotto cannot keep
it out altogether. â¢
The conversation held at the County Jail
Went through a similar course.
â  Mr. Peixotto- then cross-examined. He
showed that at the conversation held in
the office of the Chief of Police the Mayor
nor any ane else notified the defendant
that he was not compelled to answer and
further that it bad all the appearance of
an official investigation. As to the second
conversation â the one at the jail, Mr.
Peixott-o asked: . .
"Did you not tell the defendant that
you had a personal interest in the case?"
. "No; not that I am aware of."
"Did you not tell him that you had a
personal- responsibility in the case and
that the newspapers had been criticising
you?"
"A responsibility, yes; I may have done
so to induce him to t answer." '
"Do you remember the words; you. used
before you' questioned him. Do you rev
member saying you were personally In
terested in the matter: . that' the papers
had been charging you with neglect and
that you were up there to secure a state
ment from him which would show you
had not been guilty of neglect?"
1 "I â  may have . said ' something of the
kind. I told him the papers had taken up
the matter and that the commission. Mr.
Brqderjck, Judge Bahrs and myself, had
come under criticism. This, however,
was "only to pave the way fox an an
swer. Then I asked him as a matter of
curiosity and information how th~e silver
had been substituted for gold."
"Was it not i for your own private in
terest and not for information ' .
"No; I was curious to get the informa
tion and also wanted it to Â« help in the
prosecution." â¢
"Is It not a fact that â¢ you had been
warned by the Fidelity Company, that you
had not only a civil but a criminal respon
sibility?" ;â â¢â¢"â * â¢â  - -- â  : â 
"No, that was not .until four days
after,' said the Mayor, after he had asked
Sermission to answer despite the objec
ons of the prosecution to the question.
And then the Mayor went on to tell of the
suit i which -â  the -Supervisors had- ordered
brought against the surety company.
Mr. Hosmer objected to any more such
questions, but Mr. Peixotto maintained he
had a right to show that the witness had
a personal interest , in ; securing a state
ment from the defendant and that any
thing that the defendant had Bald to him
CASTORIA

â¢^WS^&Jftr/jsL
was therefore unadmissible as it was not
purely voluntary.
But the court thought enough had been
said so the caae wont over until this
morning. |
A CRIPPLED CREMATORY.
ALAMEDA. Sept. 27.â A garbage crematory
company has just completed Its plant In a
lonely spot on the Webster-street marsh, with
in the limits of this city, and It was all ready
to begin operations,' having secured permis
sion from the City . Trustees to make an ex
perimental run on Alameda garbage.^ To-day
whun the proprietors of the plant visited it
they found it a scene of wreck and confusion. .
Some one had been there and with sledgeham
mers has wrecked the machinery, breaking oil
all the brass castings that could be found, and
besides that out of pure wantonness had
smashed the apparatus generally until it was
â¢ rendered practically useless. â  ' , .
The police were at once notified and a search
for the miscreants was commenced. The braas j
castings were soon traced to a Junk shop
in Oakland, and after that it was a matter
of but a short time to run down the rascalÃ.
who proved to be five youths from 16 to 18 years
i of age and constituting as tough a looking gan*
as can be imagined. 'iUey were arrested and
broupht over to Alameda, where they are now
In the City Jail. They gave their names as
Frank Sheehan, John Sptcula. James Dolla
rocoa. Paul Kipper and William Martin
The total damage done will exceed $1000. while
they only received a very small amount for
the castings. â¢â¢â â .-. ; <

JOCKEY GLENN
EARNS A REST
His Ride on Hermanita
Too Listless.
FAVORITES IN DIFFICULTIES
ODDS-ON CHOICES BEATEN AT
SACRAMENTO.
Amass Outfoots Lady Ashley, Etta
H Wins From Valencienne and
Manzanillo Takes Lib
ertine's Measure.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 27.â The racing
at the park this afternoon was. decided
orer a lumpy track and but two favorites
â Rey del Tierra with Plggott up, and
Ollt Edge, ridden by .Thorpeâ were a.blÂ«J
to make It. Amas.a took the opening
event at comfortable odds; Etta II easily
outfooted Valencionne in the sprint which
followed, and In the fourth recital Man
zanllla led Libertine past the flushing
post.
Judge Prices and Wilson again demons
trated that suspicions looking riders would
not be tolerated by suspending Glenn, who
rode Hermanita in the mile and' a six
teenth run. He sat up straight on the.
mare until within a few yards of the
wire, where a mild bluff was made at
riding. If tlw boy really did try and the
â¢ effort was the best he is. capable of, his
dealings with the equine in future should
be confined to a sawhorse In some wood
ya.rd.
The overnight gamblers created some
thing of a flurry In the market by play-
Ing Kaiser Ludwtg. but even with Plg
gott on his. back lie was not a very
dangerous factor In the first race, a six- i
, furlong selling sprint. Amasa at odds of !
4 to 1 led from the start and won. easily, j
with Distinction second, about three j
lengths ahead of Ludwig. Lady Ashley, |
the 1 to 2 choice, early showed a disin
clination to run in the going. â¢ .
But three lined up in the five and a half
furlong scramble following, and Valen
cienne, the 1 to 2 favorite, carried the
target In. Frawley kept her In the deep
going next the rail, and as the stretch
was reached the fast. filly was beaten.
Etta H, well handled by Ous Wilson, was
then enabled to win- easily from the two
year-old Bonibel.
Before the mile and v sixteenth run
was called there was a dispute as to who
was entitled to the services of Thorpe,
the owners of both Zarro and Ko Ko
claiming to have engaged him. The flip
of a coin gave him to "Hanger"* Jones,
the owner of Ko Ko, and there was gloom
In the camp of the Zarro people, for the
black horse had been extensively backed
in the over-night betting. All doubts were
eet at rest by Rey del xierra, the 2 to 5
favorite, going out in front and winning
a? he pleased. In a drive Ko Ko took
the place from Hermanita.
Libertine once more suffered defeat In
the seven furlong purse event. The- big
bay horse went to the post a 9 toÂ« 20 choice
and was unable to overhaul so cheap a
plater as Manzanillo, carrying the coin
cj the smart set. The latter was ridden
by Thorpe, and beat tne barrier a length
or so. Ockiuruek a^ain shuffled into the
Bhow.
Thorpe was also successful In landing
Gilt Edgre winner of the final race on the
card, a flye furlong dash for maiden two
year-olds. The big chestnut youngster
came out full of steam, and, almost Imme
diately assuming the front position, led
his field past the Judges eased up. Six
lengths away Crossmoltna gained place
honors from Irlandaia. Following are

McINTYRE WAS
NOT MISQUOTED
So Declare Witnesses at
Denver.
OREGON'S CHAPLAIN'S WORDS
SCOFFED AT SAMPSON AND
"FIGHTING BOB."
Newspaper Reporters Swear That
His Statements Were Much
Stronger Than Those That
. Were Printed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Colo., Sept. 27.^-The court
martial of Rev. Joseph P. Mclntyre,
chaplain of the battleship Oregon, on a
charge of scandalizing the navy In a
I lecture delivered in Denver on August
I 8, was resumed at 10 o'clock to-day. As
on the opening day the courtroom was
crowded, many being turned away.
J. B. Burnett, business manager of
the Rocky Mountain News, was the
first witness called. He identified the
copy of the News containing a report of
| the offending lecture by Chaplain Mc
j Intyre.
Miss Minnie J. Reynolds, who report
ed the lecture for the News, was caJled
to verify the report published and from
which extracts contained in the charges
against Chaplain Mclntyre were taken.
She fully corroborated the report she
I had written, which was introduced as
i testimony. Miss Reynolds testified that
! Chaplain Mclntyre's reference to Cap-
J tain Robley D. Evans, as "Fighting
I Bob,", was contemptuous in manner.
Cross-examination failed to shake her
testimony that Chaplain Mclntyre as
serted that Admiral Sampson reported
himself within four mileÃ of the Span
; ish ship Cristobal Colon when she siir- J
rendered in order that he might secure i
his share of the prize money, and that
Sampson, though no more entitled to ,
i participate than were the members of \
I his audience, would receive $10,000, j
; while Captain Clark, "who fought the (
' Oregon as no man ever fought ship ;
! before," would receive but $500. She
had also testified that Chaplain Mc
lntyre declared that the contracts for j
all Eastern built battleships were se- !
cured through political pulls, and j
| hence the Oregon, which was built in j
' the West, was the only one honestly j
built. She maintained that the chap
â  lain said that while the Oregon was |
going into the fight the lowa was go
ing to -the rear and that she was kept
, there during the fight, and said that
I he offered no explanation of that al
; leged action.
Paul W. Beck, who reported the lec
ture of Chaplain Mclntyre for the Den
ver Times, was next called. He stated
that the chaplain said Admiral Samp
son reported himself within four miles
of the Cristobal Colon when she struck
her colors and in reality he was not i
! within that distance of the Colon. In !
I other respects Mr. Beck corroborated |
! the testimony of Miss Reynolds regard
ing the charges against the prisoner.
He identified a report of the lecture
! written by him and published in the j
; Denver Times. In this Chaplain Mc
lntyre was quoted as having said Ad
miral Sampson, with the uagship New
York, and eh. other vessels were ten !
miles away when the Cristobal Colon !
I hauled down her flag. This, Mr. Beck |
' said, was correct. He also corroborated i
the report published in the Rocky
Mountain News, though he declared
Chaplain Mclntyre's statements were
much stronger than those given therein.
Charles H. Sage, a prominent real j
estate broker, testified. Xso new facts |
were brought out by his testimony. He
was still on the stand when the court
adjourned for the day.

masted schooner was launched to-Uay at

REAGAN AS A STARTER.
Montanans Praise the Work of the
San Franciscan.
"Pat" Reagan Is the latest San Fran
ciscan to earn a reputation abroad as a :
race track official. Reagan has been of
ficiating as starter at the Great Falls
meeting, and evidently he is meeting more
success than did Mr. Ferguson at Butte
and Anaconda. A Great Falls dispatch
to the Anaconda Standard says:
. P. F. Reagan was the man with the red. flag
and he was assisted In the starting by William
Feno. It Is something . worthy of noting at
this time that the spectators were yen much
pleased -with the work done by Mr. Reagan,
and It was a common remark that his style
of . doing business- was a vast Improvement
over what they had seen .In Butte. R. J.
Curran was clerk of the scales. W. t>. Ran
dall held the watch, with Frank McMahon
as his partner.
The Great Falls Tribune thus praises
the San Franciscan's work:
. P. F. Reagan was starter, occupying prob
ably the most arduous arid unpleasant position
at the track, but. he performed his duties so
well that all were loud in praise of his suc
cess and predicted that If. he maintains, his
success throughout the meeting he will be
official starter for all Montana races next
year. He gave a beautiful start In every race,
handled the\ Jockeys tactfully at the- post and
prevented the delays which are so' apt to
occur and disgust the crowd. Iteagan U all
right. ' . ;
Sloan Lands a Long Shot.
LONPON, Sept. 27.â At the first day's
racing of the first October â¢ meeting at
Newmarket to-day the Visitors' Plate of
150 sovereigns was won by Lord Carnar
von's 3-year-old chestnut filly; Buckbread,
ridden by Tod Sloan. Thirteen horses ran.
The betting was 100 to 12 against Buck
bread.
Tod Sloan also, won the Granby plate of
300 sovereigns with the Lorilard-Beresford
stable's two-year-old colt Domino

IHE BURGLAR
"BURGLES" HIS
WAY SAFELY
Robs Plain Citizens
With Impunity.
SLEUTHS HAVE "NO TIME"
DEVOTE THEIR EFFORTS TO
"STAR CASES."
Thieves Successfully Raid a Build
ing in the Center of the City
Five Times in *
Month.
The monotonous activity of the unas
suming housi hTfiikor and the marked
epathy of the J'alice Department with
reference to crimes. i.= causing the ordin
ary citizen who pays taxes and obeys
thp law tn Wonder Ifor what particular
purpose he Is payirig to provide Chief
lyee? and his army of men with salaries.
The condition that makes the situation
more unsatisfactory is the fact that if
a prominent member of a wealthy cor
porationânn officer of . the Southern Pa
cific Company, for instanceâ is despoiled
of his- worldly goods' the detective force
goes out en masse, the property is re
coyered and the proud, record . of the
"force" duly swelled." In. other words, in
cases where there are no opportunities
to make "star . plays'.' for reputation the
powers that are located in the "upper
office" are too busy to pay attention to
the Just claims of the [ plain citizen.-
The enterprisin-g burglar, feeling ; as
sured that he has this practical immu
nity, loses "no time or opportunity, and
plies his predatory avocation right under
the noses of the police and in the heart
of the city. : . â  . â¢ â¢ - ....
The record of one notorious "case will
Illustrate the manner, in which the com
mon citizen is., protected under the ad
ministration of Grandpa Lees..
At the -northwest corner -of Jones and
Geary streets Is a row of new flats, which
has proved a rich fit-Id of operations for
burglars. They hegan' operations as soon
as the building was occupied and . well
equipped for .their work. They first broke
Into the storeroom at 607. Geary, cut open
two large tiunks packed full, of fine
clothing and 'bedding, which, they got
away with. A few days later another, raid
was made, in which an express, wagon
load of valuable property I was carried
away. This was done' on a bright night
In a central part . of the city and on a
beat which is supposed to" be properly
cover* il. However, the -burglars were in
no wise disturbed. :r: r . â - ;'â¢,â¢'â 
After this bald act an urgent request
was filed at police headquarters that -a
detective be detailed t â¢ j watch the place
and capture th-e culprits. "' ...">â . ' â¢
No attention whatever, was paid to thÂ«
case ancl the burglars were thereby af
forded full opportunity to dispose of their
spoils. It Is evident that they knew how
their depredations were regarded at head
quarters, for they took a chance at the
Scary-street side of the building and
also again on the Jones-street section. .
' After this exasperating impudence a
robust protest was tiled in Chief Lees'
Dfflce. A reference to the books showed
that the . complaint of the second rob
bery had been recorded and that noth
ing had been done regarding it. The ex
planation was that "they had been too
busy." . â¢ " .
Finally one the sleuths vho shines in
"big cases" called, but "had no time", to
take a description of the hundreda of dol
sars' worth of pror>erty that had been
Itolen. The consequence was that no in
formation was obtained -by which the
force might search for and recover the
foods. â â  â¢_ ;. .. â¢_.
This detective promised to return in a
jouple of days and see what could be done
with the case. For some reason he did
lot keep his appointment nor did he send
i substitute. The housebreakers may not
tave known the fact that the Police De
partment took no Interest in their opera
tions, but Just the same they carefully.
nade two more raids on the same prem
ees, while the policeman on the beat was
'too busy" to know anything about the af
!alr. -
When the second complaint was made
t was explained that the thieves could be
raupht by detailing a detective to watch
Jor them, and had this precaution been
taken they would have been easily cap
ered on their latest visit to the place
They are expert operators and if taken
R'ould doubtless prove to be old hands
*ho have been long wanted.
However, the sufferers were of no im
portance from the standpoint of the upper
Mtlce and are now of the : opinion that
iiey are fortunate that the favored appro
priators of .other people's property, did
aot secure sufficient truck facilities and
remove their entire household effects.
I hey feel confident that there would have
seen no police interference with such an
mterprise.

Isaac Herold- was yesterday fined $000,
with the alternative of ISO -.days in the

charge of misdemeanor, embezzlement.

. Herold wag employed in June last by
Lewis H. Scharer, pawn-br.oker, 22 Mason

his illness. A few days later Herold ad
vanced a loan of $25 on a pair o. bracelets,
and when Scharer recently returned, to
the store he objected to the .loan on the
bracelets, as' he considered they were not
worth more than $7. Herold- explained
that the loan was made for a'- friend and
the. bracelets would be redeemed^
They were not redeemed, and when
Herold left Scharer's employment ho -re
tained $25 from Herold's salary, which
was to be paid to him on the bracelets
being redeemed. Herold asked for the
use of the bracelets for a few days and he
got them. A few hours later a man
carted at the store and demanded the re
turn of the bracelets, and from subse
quent developments Scharer beneved that
it was a conspiracy to blackmail -him, as
the man wanted $75 unless the bracelets
were returned. Herold did not return
them and' Scharer hn-d him arrested. .

THE SA3* FKANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1893.
Night.
half hour later Henry Beacom, a fruit
peddler, living- at 158 Prospect avenue;
was brought in hy Detective John A.
Fitzgerald and both were booked on a
charge of arson.
With the arrest of these two persons
Fire Marshal Towe is satisfied that he
has the perpetrators of as stupid a piece
of incendiarism as has ever been attempt
ed in this city, and he is also confident
that he has a clear case of arson against
both.
All day yesterday Marshal Towe, assis
ed by Detectives Fitzgerald, E. J.
Thompson and Robert Graham, worked
on the case, and it was hot until late in
the afternoon that he satisfied himself
that he could make the charge of arson
hold against the woman, Towe had in
mind the decision of the Supreme Court
In the' case of William Wilkins de Win
ton, a draughtsman at the Union Iron
Works, who was arrested about three
years ago for arson in having destroyed
his own dwelling. De Winton set up the
defense that a man could do as he pleased
with his own property, and the Supreme
Court took that view of the matter. Dur
ing the afternoon, however, Marshal
Towe secured sworn statements from the
son and daughter of Mrs. Shields that the
Virginia avenue house had. been deeded
to. them and the property now stands in
tneir nam.e. They . made no attempt to
.shield their mother, but made a plain,
straightforward .statement- to the Fire
Marshal.
Towe, earlier in the day, obtained a
sworn statement from Llllie Mullin, who
was employed by Mrs. Shields as a serv
ant, and it was her statement that led to
the arrest of Beaeom and the finding of
a lot of incriminating evidence in his pos
session. The girl stated that last Satur
day night lieacom carried off a lotof'Mrs.
Shields' furniture and stored .it on his
premises,. 156 Prospect avenue. He bought
three cans. of. coal oil and Mrs. Shields
purchased two ' more - cans. Beaeom

BY CUSTOMS OFFICERS.
Twenty-Six Moon-Eyed Damsels,
Worth Fifty-Two Thousand

Chinatown Slums.
"May the gods? protect me from these
foreign sons of wicked women!" was the
pious prayer of Sung HI, the fat. house
keeper' of the family lodgings on the
second floor of 1012. Dupont street yester
day.: ...';â¢
Sung HI knew thai .when, a policeman,
or those more dreaded personages the
Custom-house officers, visited the .place
they always brought bad luck and jails
and fines with them. They were the birds
of evil omen,' the birds of bribery,
perjury and corruption. For it they did
not meddle with the sons and daughters
of Cathay there would be no bribery. and
corruption and no injustice- anywhere.
Here were the Chinese Bureau Inspect
or Flesh' and Interpreter Gardner,' one ol
the prophets .from the Jesus Mission, and
Revenue Agent Putnam from the land of
the one-lunged orange Buckers, iii her
house looking for Chinese- girls, who, they
said, had escaped from the Omaha Fair,
and had no chak jee .(certifi-cates) to show
why they should remain In the land of
the beef -eaters. . â 
She knew that Dr.' Gardner understood
her when she appealed to' the gods in
whose honor she had burned a carload
of punk- on her threshold these many
years agone, but when woman becomes
ne.rvous and excited she does- not care
what she says or who says it.
â  The unwelcome visitors whom the gods
of Sung Hi could not : stop walked
into a room where stood before a mirror
a pretty- Chinese â  girl of 18 summers,
E lacing filagree stick pins in her .hair,
he turned around with an expression
half of amusement, half of coquetry, for
.the reverend doctor is a good looking man
and scents his handkerchief with the per-,
fume of the white' water lily.
"Where is your chak jee?" asked the
doctor. â¢ â¢
'â¢â¢I have no papers," was the truthful
response of the slave girl.
This answer shocked the thrifty soul of
Sung Hi. It meant exile to China,- and
the loss . of $2000 to the owner of the
girl. Besides that she would lose a good
boardeF, arid money was getting scarce.
"Suey Wan. you're a fool to tell the
Fwang' Kwl such a story as that. Is it
true that you have no certificate?"
"It- is, good mother."
"Then It is too late to correct, it. But
tell him-that you are the wife of/ a mer
chant and all- will be well, for the wives
of merchants may come here."
This conversation was in Cantonese,
and ' the doctor smiled. The story sug
gested by the fat ' landlady would not
work, he knew, because the i-laok silken
blouse worn by the slave girl had a- tur
quoise zone extending across the breast
and back and shoulder, and on the tur
quoise field were embroidered flowers,
the infallible mark that distinguishes the
woman who is neither maid nor wife.
"Take her tj the Presbyterian Mls-
opened the cans and placed them in dif
ferent parts of the house, where they
were afterward foun(L ' Beacom then went
into the basement, telling Lillie to follow
him. She went downstairs and begged
him to return the furniture he had taken
away, but he refused. "This has gone
too far now," he. said, "and if you say
anything about this I will send you to San
Quentin." â¢
Beacom, she said, then struck a match
and gave it to the girl, telling her to ignite
the coal oil. She dropped the. match,
which went out, and ran into the street.
She looked back toward the house and
Baw a blaze in the basement and was
positive Beacom had ignited It.
Lillie said the original plan was to fire
the house last Saturday night, bttt it took
nearly all night to remove the furniture,
so it was postponed until the following
night.
The plan first agreed upon between Mrs.
Shields and Beacom, the girl stated, was
for the two women' to begin a game of
cards and get into a fight, during which
a lamp was to be upset, but this was not
. followed out. . ' .
Acting on Ltllie Mullin's information,
Towe and the detectives went out to Bea
com's home on Prospect avenue, a_nd in
the loft of his barn they found sixteen
chairs, a carpet, a number of pictures
and a marble and mahogany mantle. In
the lower part of the barn, covered by a
lot of sacks, they found a couch, a pair
of folding doors and numerous other arti
cles, all of which had been removed from
tin- Shields house.
Beaoom was off peddling fruit all day,
and when he reached home last night he
found the officer there ready to arrest
him. At the City Prison he said he had
given Mrs. Shields $15 within the past
two months to pay bills with and i.ad
taken the articles found in his home in
payment. He said that only six chairs
belonged to him, the others being given
to him to deliver to soriie relatives of the
Shields woman named Burke. At 5
o'clock Saturday afternoon Mrs. Shields
told him he must get the things out of
the house that night. He began the work
of moving them two hours later and did
not finish the task until nearly 4 o'clock
the next morning. Beacom disclaimed all
knowledge of the plot to. fire the Shields
premises and said he did not know why
she was in such a hurry to have the
things taken away.
Mrs. Shields was vfry drunk when she
landed at the police station. She said she
had no idea where she had been since
the fire, but had .intended to. give herself
up from the first, only she could not lind
a. Doilceman.
There is something in that part of her
story, at least, for the city's protectors
are so busy with their drumming, club
bing, filing and singing lessons nowa
days, under the direction of the venerable
Chief, that they find little time lor any
thing else. '
â¢ However, Mrs. Shields was sober
enough to divide the responsibility for the
fire between herself and Beacom. She
said they fixed the Job up together, and
'Beacom bought the oil and started the
fire. She was r>n the opposite side of tne
street when the fire started. She denied
emphatically that she ever received a
cent from Beacom. Later in the night
Mrs. Shields said her husband fired the
place, but this Is impossible, as Shields
Is not in the city. The authorities will
make a thorough investigation of the re
lations that have existed between Mrs.
Shields and Beaoom, and expect to prove
that the pair have been altogether too
friendly for some time.
..Fire Marshal Towe talked to Beacom
after the fire Sunday and Beacom then
denied all knowledge of it or the woman.
Last night when asked why he did hot
mention the fact that he had some of the
woman's furniture hidden away he- re-
Eliedthat he. did not "want to give any
ody away."
Bion," ordered Inspector Flesh, and a po
liceman from the California-street station
led the giggling girl away.
When the posse entered Sung Hi's house
they were delayed for fully three minutes
waiting for the door to open in response
to their summons, and whsn they were
ascending the stairs they heard the patter
of paper-soled slippers above. A ladder
led to a trap door In the .celling and- the
door was weighted so that Putnam, who
eeemed to be a wolf for exercise, gave up
the attempt to raise it. The third story
was gained by means of a stairway. Mo
one appeared but.ayoungChinese woman,
the mistress of the lodgings. Nobody was
home, she said. The' three locked rooms
were occupied at night by men who work
ed in factories. She had. no keys to lit.
Two of the doqFS were broken open and
â¢the rooms. were found to be empty. The
â¢third door was double locked, and when
Putnam pried It with a hatchet he found
that it was barred on the inside with a
stick of timber. Some one made a small
hole in the panel of the door arid Dr.
Gardner peeped In. â 
'.'We have them," he cried. "I saw a
Chinawoman's foot In there."
Then, some one cut open a panel and
poked h.is head through the opening. Ho
saw a Chinaman lying on a bed iretend
ing to be. asleep, and three women' sitting
on the edge of another bed.
"Open that door. Take down that bar
.or we'll fill you- full of holes." .
The man did as ordered, and when the
invaders entered the room they saw throe
of the prettiest girls from the Oriental
standpoint that, have ever come to Cali
fornia.
"We have no ehak jee," they said to the
Interpreter, "we were born here, and are
Americans."
Not one of them could speak or under
stand a word of English, and they wore
the tell-tale garments of the slave, while
th 1 kf'd Wa * dressed ln the fashion, of

lho raid, had been planned by Major
Moore, special agent of .the- Treasury, and
when the alleys of Chinatown had been
thoroughly combed there were twenty-six
Chinese slave girls without chak jee In
the Presebyterian Mission Home on Sac
ramento street as the result. But many
escaped before the officers reached thoir
rooms, and they had left their breakfasts
of rice and: pork and the long China string
bean half eaten. Their slippers, gold em-
broidered, lay. on the floor and their rouge
and powder, box-es were uncovered, so
great had been their haste to get away.
PARIS' CHILDREN SENT AWAY.
Two Dollars, Sardines, and His Bless
ing Given at Parting. .
A peculiar story of a parent's disregard
for his children was told yesterday by
Mrs. .Prescott, assistant secretary of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty, to
Children. Eugene Paris owns a large and
apparently profitable -vineyard in the Liv-.
ermore valley, but his conduct toward his
six children was such that the society nad
to step in and send them to their aunt
who lives in Minnesota. Their mother
died insane about a year ago. Mrs. Pres
cott said: 'â 
"For all of his wealth Paris- would hot
contribute a cent toward sending- the chil
dren to. their aunt. She sent out a part of
the money necessary, the society fur
nished the rest,' and friends assisted in
getting the sleeping apartments .for tne
little folks. Kind-hearted people in Oak
land packed the lunch baskets with food
enough to last during the trip.
"On Saturday we sent the' children. on
their way to the When it-was train
time the father went to the depot and all
he gave was $2 to the eldest daughter and
added two boxes of sardines to the lunch.
This was all he would give, besides his
blessing, of- which he was very lavish." â¢

HUD A PISTOL
CONCEALED IN
HER CORSAGE
Threatened to Kill
Judge Coffey.
ACTION OF A CRAZY WOMAN
MBS. FRANCES ST7CHORZYNSKA
HEARD FROM AGAIN. .
The Judge Retreated and Notified
the Police, and Detectives
Are Searching for
Her.
Judge Coffey's life was threatened by
a .woman yesterday afternoon, and the
police have received- instructions to ar
rest her ort sight. The woman . Is
Mrs. Frances Suehorzynska, and Judge
Coffey is not the only one she has threat
ened to. kill. â¢ .
About 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
I Judge was standing on the corner of Mc-
Allister and Lafkln streets waiting for a
car when Mrs. Suchorz.ynska' approached
him. She began to abuse him in a loud
voice, which attracted the attention of
passers-by. Finally- she placed her hand
in the. bosom of her dress, making the
remark that she would kill the Judge.
Fearing that she would draw a revolver
the Judge beat; a hasty retreat into the
City Hall, and hurried to police head
| quarters, where he made a complaint that
the woman was dangerous, asking that
she be placed under arrest. He was very
much excited, and evidently feared that
the woman would carry out her threat.
Police-man Wagner was detailed- by
Chief Lees. to find the woman' and place
her under arrest, but she' had disappear
ed, and detectives were detailed to search
the city and arrest her.
â¢ The woman is mentally unbalanced, and
thinks every one is against her. . Last
Saturday she went to the office of her
! attorney, George O'Byrne, and after
! abusing him drew a pistol out of the
[ front of her drt>ss and attempted-to shoot
I him. He fled and saved himself. This
was known to Judge Coffey, and ac
counted for his hasty flight- when she
put her hand in the bosom of her dress.
She had been around the : stores in the
neighborhood of the hall yesterday after
noon quoting poetry and recounting, her
imaginary wrongs. ' . â¢
About a year ago she was arrested 1n
the corridor of the hall by Policeman
< Wagner for disturbing the ' peace and
j was sent to the House of Correction for
ten' days. After h<"-r release she was
taken before the Insanity Commissioners,
and her friends having appeared and
agreed to look after her she' was given
into their custody. She is an intelligent
woman about GO years of age, but is not
accountable for her actions.' â  . ' .
Mrs. Buchorsynska and her husband,
Frank Suchorzynska, have been a source
! of "great- annoyance about the courts for
i years. They.nad a house on Eighteenth
street, and becoming involved in litiga
tion were ejected on' several occasions by
I the Sheriff. Finally, in IS9I, both were ad
judged insane, and at that time. their con-,
nection with tne Probate Court began.
A guardian was appointed to care for
their estates during their confinement, by
Judge Coffey, and here the troubles of
the juris-t bi-gan: When the couple were
released,' a year after their commitment,
they imagined that all of their difficulties
could be. readily adjusted by Judge Cof
fey and wlun they did not lind the relief
expected at his hands Mrs. Suchorzynska.,
especially, endeavored to hold the jurist
responsible. She assailed him in the cor
ridors of tire City Hall â  and generally
made herself obnoxious, and oh other oc
casions her- heart would soften and she
would endeavor to compensate- the court
for imaginary favors' done her: On one
occasion she . presented the bailiff of
Judge Coffey'.s court with a' four-pound
Fteak, which she "had -purchased- for his
Honor." The steak was refused., which
added to her anger. Her little escapade. of
yesterday, however, may be the last in
Its line,. as the matter has. as s.fated', been
reported tp the police and she will be ex
amined by tho Insanity- Commissioners.

This novel Is regarded by the author as her
most important and significant work since
"The Silence of Dean Maitland." The scene
is laid for the most part in England, and the
story opens In the '60s. "There Is a strong and
pervading charm in this new novel," says the
London Chronfcle in the course of a long and
enthusiastic review of the book, which is. char-
acterised as a picture of "a. woman's ideal"
. and free, from morbid thoughts â¢ and theories.
The London -Spectator .says-: " 'The Silence of
Dean Maitland' was a very popular novel, and
we cannot see why 'The ' House of Hidden
Treasure' should not rival the success of its
forerunner.".
