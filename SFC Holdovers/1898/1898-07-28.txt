NEW YORK. July
27. â The Washington cor
respondent of the Herald
sends the following: In
dependence of Cuba, under
the protection of the United
States; cession to the
United States of the island
of Porto Rico; retention
of the Ladrone Islands; per
manent cession to the
United States of a coaling
station in the Philippines,

ment which will bind Spain
to a form of government
which will be satisfactory to
the people of the islands in
case she be allowed to re
tain sovereignty.
The rough draft in which President
McKlnley will make a reply to the
Queen Regent of Spain, which Secre
tary Day is formulating to be read at
the Cabinet meeting on Friday, con
tains the above general features as the
extreme limit of the terras which the
administration will concede, and which
Spain must accept before there can be
any further peace negotiations.
I learned to-night that the President
has fully detei n ans

the T nited States will agree to end the

TERMS ON WHICH
SPANIARDS WOULD
WELCOME PEACE.
MADRID, July 27.â The news
that the Government Is suing
for peace has caused neither
Burprlse nor sensation here. The
attitude c.f a majority of the
newspapers shows that the coun
try will welcome p^ace if It can
avoid the payment of an indem
nity and the lokb of the Philip
pines, where, It is now taken for
granted, th*> TTnited States -will
ret:iin a coalinp .station only.
Only a fow C&rlists, Republican
and independent papers pretend
that America's demand will not
be acceptable.
The King's illness evoked a
universal display of sympathy
for the court, which, at the pres
ent critical moment, may not be
without effect on the nation's fu
ture. Senor Sagasta, the pre
l : -r. hays the King, when con-
Tiileacent, will probably accom
pany the court to Lagraiija.
The San Francisco Call
1 made. The answer to Fpain. however,
, will be so worded as to require either
Immediate acceptance of our terms or
put an end to the peace negotiations at
1 once. Any delay on the part of Spain
will mean more extreme terms when
! the subject of peace is again taken up.
i Snch is the decision of the President
I as far as the matter stands to-night.
Further discussion of the rough draft
of the answer to Spain prepared by
Secretary Day to-day when the Cabi
net meets on Friday may result In the
redrafting of the note on somewhat
different lines. The main point upon
which the Cabinet is not unanimous is
the Important question of the future
Government of the Philippines. Radl
'â¢â¢Uly different views are entertained by
different members of the Cabinet.
President McKinley and Secretary
Day, I have reason to believe, are not
bent on permanent control of the
Philippines by the United States. They
take the ground that the acquisition of
the Philippines was not thought of
when the war commenced; that the ob
ject was for an entirely different pur
pose and that the conditions which
now extet in the Philippines 1b simply
one of the exigencies of war.
They realize, however, that Spain is
utterly incapable of maintaining peace
and order in the Philippines and that
gome arrangement must be made in the
interest of humanity and civilization
to guarantee to the population of the
Philippines a peaceful and Ftable
form of government. If the Philip
pines are to be allowed to revert to
the control of Spain there must be
Borne cast-Iron form of agreement
binding Spain to a form of government
which will be satisfactory to the people
of the islands and nations of th*- world.
There are members of the Cabinet,
however, who are violently opposed to
relinquishing the control of the Philip-
â  pines to Spain or any other Govern-
ment. The Cabinet Is a unit, however.
In favor of peace, and when it comes
together on Friday for the purpose of
formulating a note to Spain there is j
itTTle doubt that a conclusion will be
reached which will have the unanimous
pupport of the President and his offi
cial advisers. That phase of the note In
regard to thÂ« Philippines will be 1 of the
utmost Importance, for whether it re
j suits in brlnertng an end to the war or
i not it will be of great significance in

. *> " It is generally* 'conceded â¢by Â»'' mem-,
I hers of the administration that the
' question of control of the Philippines is
i one serious stumbling block In the way
of early peace. If an agreement can
be reached on this point everything else
' will be comparatively easy. As to
i Cuba and Porto Rico, there is little
! doubt that the United States and Spain
I can come to an early agreement on the
i general proposition that Spain grant
I the independence of Cuba and cede
Porto Rico to the United States.
There will be many troublesome de
tails, of course, after an agreement has
been reached upon the general terms.
The question of who Is to pay tne so
called Cuban debt will be one of the
difficult problems with which the peace
negotiators will have to deal. This is
really a Spanish debt, contracted by
Spain to pay the expenses of subduing
the insurgents in Cuba, and the reve
nues of the island of Cuba were pledged
for its payment. There Is no doubt
that the Spanish Government will en
deavor to have the treaty of peace pro
vide that this debt Is to be assumed by
Cuba if the Island shall become inde
pendent, or by the United States in the
event of annexation. I was told by a
member of the Cabinet to-day that the
United States would not consent to any
such arrangement, but would insist
that the Cuban debt must be assumed
by Spain.
This question may eventually threat
en foreign complications of as much
gravity as the settlement of the Phil
ippine question, for a great part of the
(\iban debt Is held in France and other
Knropean countries which may feel
called upon to protect the investments
of their c!tizer>3.

CAUSES OF THE
REQUEST FOR A
SHORT ARMISTICE.
LONDON, July 28.â A special
dispatch from Madrid says it is
reported that the request of
Duke Almodovar de Rio, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, was for
an armistice, lasting until Sun
day. It cannot be ascertained
whether his action was spon
taneous, in order, if possible, to
forestall the invasion of Porto
Rico and the fall of Manila, or
whether it was due to the advice
from the Vatican and the
powers.
Spanish contention will doubtless be
that .although the debt was contracted
by Spain, the United States having ab
stracted the collateral by which the in
vestment was secured, must now as

WILL PROTEST AGAINST
ATTACK ON PORTO RICO
LONDON, July 28.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
Spain will probably protest against an
attack upon Porto Rico after the
Washington Cabinet has officially re
ceived Spanish overtures for peace.
Should a circular note on this subject
be sent to the powers, it will contain
the exact dates of the Spanish com
munications, making it clear that the
United States deferred its answer in
order to be able U date this after the
Americans had gained a footing in
Porto Rico.
Senor Sagasta said to-day: "We re
solved on peace many days ago and
made known our resolutions to the
United States Government. I regard
as null and void and as destitute of
good faith everything that the Ameri
cans have done since and I am ready
to protest against it formally."

The foreign residents and those of

the prospective commercial advance
ment that the new order of things for
the Islands promises.
Others of political aspirations hall
the Stars and Stripes and prospective
official positions at comfortable salar

crib.
The annexation of the islands is the
foreseen end of a long process of polit
ical evolution in the Pacific Ocean.
Annexation brings a certain stability
to the Government which is of. the first
and highest importance. No doubt
there will be local disorders as they
occur in other places. The local pol
icy of the Hawaiian nation now gives
way to the larger and almost imperial
policy of the United States. As yet it
is in the embryo.
Much concern is felt as to the form
of government that will be given the
islands. At present it seems to be the
consensus of opinion that Hawaii
should be ruled much after the colon
j ial policy of England.
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's steamer Coptic
brought the news of the adoption of
the Newlands resolution by the Amer
ican Senate, which declared the Ha
waiian Islands a portion of the terri
tory of the United States. The steam
er sailed from San Francisco only a

few hours after the vote was taken on
the resolution in Washington, and be
fore President McKinley had added hig
official signature to the document, so
that the news taken by the vessel was
not such that could be taken official
cognizance of. The news, however,
was such that the people of Hawaii
had been anxiously waiting for â some
hoping, even in the face of almost pos
itive assurance, that the American
Senate would refuse to extend Ameri
can territory beyond the shores of the
continent, and that the Hawaiiana
would be left to govern themselves.
Arrangements had been made with the

ing between Aneriran ports gjjc Hono
lulu to signal the news by lights at
night or by flags by day, when coming
Into the Hawaiian port and carrying
the news of annexation.
To the Coptic fell the lot of taking
the news of joy to many and of sorrow
to others. About noon on July 13 the
verdant shores of the island of Oahu
were sighted from the vessel and the
order was passed from the bridge to
prepare the signal flags and the ship's
bunting for dressing the vessel accord
ing- to the arranged signal. Diamond
Head was far in the distance when the
signals went to the mastheads; then
the glasses were turned in the direc
tion of the signal station far up on the
steep side of the volcanic mountain.
Presently there came the flutter of an
answering signal and a few minutes
more all Honolulu knew the news that
for months had been anxiously waited
for, though the steamer that carried it
was far out at sea.
Diamond Head was scarcely abreast
when the United States monitor Mo
nadnock and her consort, the collier
Nero, came steaming out of the harbor
of Honolulu, bound for Manila. They
headed for the incoming steamer and
signaled for news. A boat was low
ered from the monitor and some flies
of papers were given to the officer who
boarded the Coptic. That officer took
back to the fighting ship and the col
lier the news of Schley's victory, as
well as the news of the annexation of
the islands.
There were rounds of cheers from
each of Uncle Sam's vessels when the
Monadnock's boat pulled back and
carried the tidings to their crews.
The big steamer had hardly turned
into the narrow channel through the
coral reef that leads into the harbor of
Honolulu when the launch of the gun
boat Mohican steamed alongside and
asked for the news. It was freely

CONSUL GENERAL HAYWOOD.
learned of the vote, which results
in the annihilation of our beloved country and in the driving to the wall
of all Hawaiians. I can assure you that there is not one Hawaiian who in
his heart favors annexation. What would you think of any man or woman
who with indifference could see the flag of his or her country go down and
their very individuality absorbed by a foreign race which, whatever you
may say, does look down on us as their inferiors and despises our color and
our way of living?
I can tell you, and few men have the opportunity of knowing the
Hawaiians as I do, that many tears were shed when the news by the Coptic
reai hod the homes of those who know no other country than these islands,
which once were justly called the Paradise of the Pacific. \Â» c cannot be
happy under our new conditions. We will feel like strangers among the
people who wi'l rule us. and with whose ideas, mode of living and political
principles we cannot harmonize.
Our women fed it even. worse than we men do. The teachings of the
New England missionaries, the rum they brought with them, the diseases
following in their train, have enervated the Hawaiian men. We can talk,
don't you forget it. but we cannot fight. If we had yet the fighting qual
ities of our ancestors, the overturn of our monarchy would never have taken
places and during the past years we would have been entitled to interfer
ence in the name of humanity in our struggles against the usurpers.
< Â»ur WCjmen have shown more energy, more solid patriotism and more
strength than we have. The women of Hawaii to-day stand aa a unit in
their hatred toward America and everything American. And can you
blame them? They see before them a future where their children will be
forced into competition with your pushing, rushing, money-grabbing race.
The dolce far niente of Hawaii must disappear and the struggle for life will
begin in which the strongest will survive, and the gentle, indolent, easy
going Hawaiian will have no show in that battle for life, and who can
blame us for feeling sad over a future which necessarily means destruction
of our race?
I cannot deny that one great reason for our opposition to annexation
]s that we fear that we wih be called "niggers" and treated as you do that
class in your 4 'free" country. We have been assured that such will not be
the caso, but experience tells us differently. Our countrymen who have
traveled in the States have often been subjected to great humiliation and
insult on account of their skin, and we expect that the day will oome
when we will risk similar affronts right in our own streets, and remember
that we have neither the wealth nor the inclination to strike our tents
in other climes. We have no other home than Hawaii, and that home we
have I"St.
And what will our position be in the political and social life of these
islands after your flag floats over the palace of our chiefs?
Senator Morgan of Alabama told a large assembly of Hawaiians, when
he visited here, that he could promise them equal potittcal rights with any
American in any Syate of America. He told us that eaÂ«h of us wouhl have
as good a chance to become President of the United States as has Grover
Cleveland. (I believe him in that.) He said that Hawaii would be a
State, and that by the power of our majority we would control the affairs
of Hawaii and enjoy true self-government. He paid a glowing tribute to
our intelligence ami excellent qualities, and told us how he loved "colored"
people.
We didn't believe a word of what that ex-slave driver from Alabama
said, and there is no man more despised and loathed among the Hawaiians
than Senator Morgan, who now is to frame a government for Hawaii.
The Hawaiians have at present no intention of taking any active inter
est in the government of their country. They feel like the children
Israel did when they sat down in exile and bemoaned their fate. What
has happened cannot be undone, but none of us can see what your great
country has gained by adding to the Union such unwilling and hostile peo
ple. We are not savages, as your Indians of Alaska, or ignorant as
your "greasers." Fur nearly a century we have conducted a fairly good
government and lived in harmony with the white men who benefited from
our hospitality and whose descendants now rob us of our country.
Go and ask any man, woman or child what he thinks to-day of the
"haole" (the foreigner), and you will get an answer in a very emphatic and
plain language.
When < 'hinese and Japanese coolies are stopped from coming here as
contract laborers we will have the satisfaction of laughing at the men who
make their money out of slave labor and who brought on annexation to
gain the benefit of the sugar bounty. But that satisfaction is very plim
when we realize the fact that we will be trodden under foot by the invad
ers, and that when your ll a?, which we admire in its proper place, waves
over Hawaii, to pronounce the fact that we are homeless and that our
country has oeased to exist. MOHAILANI.
"NATURAL GROWTH,"
SAYS PRESIDENT DOLE
HONOLULU. July 20.â "The political progress of the Hawaiian Islands
id their annexation to the United States has been along- the line of natural
growth," said Sanford B. Dole, the
President of the Hawaiian Republic,
when the news of annexation was
brought to him by the Coptic.
"That progress haa been greatly
stimulated through the influence of the
foreign residents, of whom the great
majority are Americans. The first or
ganization of government r>y King
Kamehameha 111 In 1840 was a crude
affair, but it was the first step in the
sequence of events that led up to the
present transfer of the Government of
the islands to Washington. Then came
the constitutions of 1853, 1864 and 1887,
making each time a decided develop
ment of representative principles of
government and a decadence of royal
authority.
"The provisional Government admin
istered affairs under the constitution
of 1887, except as the same was modi

constitutional provisions, and greatly
contributed to the Improvement of the

conditions of the Hawaiian community.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAXL, THURSDAY, JTTLY 28, 1898.
MINISTER SEWALL'S
IDEAS ON ANNEXATION
HONOLULU, July 20.â "The annexation of Hawaii," said American Min
ister Sewall in discussing the action of the Senate in adopting the Newlands
resolution, "is, in the words of Presi-
dent McKlnley, 'a consummation ajid
not a change.' The whole policy of the
United States toward these islands
pointed plainly to the time when what
has been called the mere suzerainty of
the United States over Hawaii should
assume the shape of actual and per
manent sovereignty and the incorpora
tion of the islands as a part of the na
tional territory. There has been a
growing feeling In the United States
that the benefits given Hawaii under
the reciprocity treaty were not com
pensated for by any return the Islands
could make short of the cession of the
territory itself.
"Like all true unions, the union of
Hawaii with the United States is of
reciprocal benefit, and I do not think
it possible for any man to state on
which side there will be the greater
benefit. What the acquisition of
the sovereignty of these islands
itself, the right to use the ter
ritory and the harbors for naval and
military operations, means to the
United States, the future will demon
strate, and it may be believed that that
demonstration will accord with the
opinion of every authority on naval
and military matters who has studied
the question and who has not hesitated to state positively that It Is an
advantage absolutely necessary for the protection of our coast should we
seek that maritime supremacy in the northern waters of this ocean which now
seems assured.
"We are having almost weekly here the demonstration of the advan
tage of the facilities offered by these Islands, not only for coaling our
ships, but for resting our men and recuperating the sick on their way to
Manila. We shall have here, taking the commercial view, an American
trade to which no limits can be set. Many articles of merchandise im
ported in great quantities here were not provided for under the reciproc
ity treaty, and in these foreign countries have had an advantage which
they will relinquish with regret. The British and German merchants here
who have been engaged in this importation will realize this. With the
increased market for our goods there comes also an increased demand for
American ships for use in the trade to the west coast and around the
Horn, and trade also that has not been confined to them. Lands will be
opened up for settlement and cultivation by our people, and this has been
one of the most cherished hopes of the present Government. American cap
ital, always preferring investment in American territory, will now find
abundant field here in the development of these undeveloped groups of is
lands where profits in every line of trade and business have been very
great, justified by those who have made them by the contention that these
profits have only been commensurate with risks that have been taken in
Investing money under the uncertain political conditions that have here
tofore prevailed here.
"Many merchants and traders here have shown a high degree of pa
triotism in welcoming a change which Invites increased competition, and
with that competition inevitably diminished profits. This competition is in
vited in every field of trade and merchant enterprise in the Islands and
will be of undoubted benefit to the great masses of the population for the
expenses of living and of transportation have been notoriously high. In
this diminution of profits of the merchant, and especially of the retailer, will
be found one of the great benefits that Hawaii itself will receive, when the
greatest good of the greatest number is considered. What Hawaii will re
ceive in the way of security from threats and interference from other na
tions, as well as from disturbance of its interior peace, is apparent, and
constituted one of the chief reasons for the efforts to secure annexation
here. More directly, and to the advantage both of Hawaii and the United
States, it must not be overlooked that the annexation of Hawaii has forced
the early completion of the canal at Nicaragua, and the construction of
this canal will be of mutual and Inestimable benefit.
"The commission to frame the laws for Hawaii, to be appointed by the
President, will have a most Important duty and will be given, I Judge, dis
cretion and latitude commensurate with the importance of its duty, especial
ly as Congress will pass upon this work. It will have to cover the entire
field of the needs of these Islands, the industrial and political conditions of
which find no parallel in any territory r whicb has been annexed to tha
United States since 'the original union. It will be the wish of all people
interested in these islands to have their views represented before the com
mission, and it will be a privilege that I should think will be properly
granted. President Dole, who has devoted much time to the study of the
land tenures here, would place, I think, the land laws at the very front of
the matters to be considered by the commission.
"As to the form of local government, I do not believe anybody here
has a definite opinion or preference as yet. It has been announced by
different members of the Government that the present Government â will
probably be continued without much change upon the conclusion of the
commission's report, and this seems probable, of course assuming that it
be under the direction of the President of the United States, as is pro
vided in the resolutions themselves. As to the contract labor question, there
is some anxiety I understand among the planters lest the attention the
commission may give to this question may result in a diminished supply
of labor. Chinese, of course, will not be admitted, and it will be a serious
question as to what laws and regulations will have to be framed regarding
the Japanese. But I am happy to say that the planters, as a whole,
are confident that there will be no insurmountable difficulty â¢In securing
sufficient labor, though it Is recognized that the cost of labor will be In
creased, and it is cheerfully acknowledged that this cost can be fairly
borne by the plantations.
"With all the changes that will come I believe the future of the -native
Hawaiian is assured. The continued invasion of Asiatics here cannot be
for their benefit. They have displaced the Hawaiian not only from his
lands, but very largely from the few fields of enterprise in which the Ha
waiian could and wouid engage; while the Hawalians, muoh
more than we have found our people in cities where Chinese
have congregated, are susceptible to the influences of close association and
the vices which come in its train.
"Whether under our constitution it will be possible to safegard the Ha
waiian in any way against the ills which intercourse with the outside
world has brought upon him, or not, Ido not know. He deserves peculiar
and warm consideration. I have known the Polyneslon race since 1887,
when I first went to Samoa, and as all people who know them, I cherish
a warm regard for them and believe that our race may well emulate many
of their hospitable virtues. It has been this very hospitality and prodi
gality with which they welcome the stranger to their land that has
brought upon them most of the ills from which they suffer; and if aught
can be done to relieve any of them who are in misfortune, or to give them
political privileges which they can use consistently with the general wel
fare this should be done.
"I have no fear that the social condition of the Hawaiian will suffer
detriment. His position is too well established traditionally and actually
to fear this, and I think there is a general feeling of high regard and sym
pathy felt for the Hawaiian, not the least in the Government which sup
plants the monarchy, and among Its supporters.
"In the light of history the Hawalians realize that they have lost no
native government, for no native government in the true sense of the
word has ever existed here; and it is impossible to believe that such a
government as commends itself to the President and Congress of the
United States will not deal as justly and fairly with them as the different
monarchs under whom they have lived, directed as they have always been
by white advisers.
"I have not had an opportunity to learn just how the Hawaiians have
received the news. They have made no demonstration In any part of the
group that I can learn, either of approval or disapproval. I believe that
those who have been opposed to annexation will very shortly become re
conciled. I think that such a feeling on their part has increased with
each expedition that has passed through here to the Philippines, as they
have been brought into actual contact with representative American citi
zens. They surely have had long notice of the impending change, and all
of the intelligent ones have long since recognized it as inevitable.
"I recall now with peculiar force that Liliuokalani said to me shortly
after the revolution which deprived her of her throne, that they had so
recognized this change as inevitable, but had hoped that it would not
come in her time or in the time of her niece, Kaiulanl.
"But events have moved faster than we could anticipate then, and with
a feeling of the utmost friendliness toward the Hawaiians the change is al
ready here, and I feel confident they will be made to understand by actual
realization of the benefits offered that it Is for their lasting advantage."

HONOLULU, July 20.â T0 the Editor of The San Francisco Call: Annex
ation, for which the people of Hawaii have so earnestly worked, will not
in every respect meet the expectations
of its most earnest advocates, nor will
it, on the other hand, bring the dire
misfortunes predicted by its oppo
nents. It will, in the first place, pre
vent the swamping of the country by
Asiatic labor, thereby preserving the
land to its own people and to those
that come after them. There is room
here for a large population. The re
sources of the Islands are by no means
all developed. While the cultivation
of sugar can only be successfully con
ducted by the aggregation of capital,
there is a fine opportunity for the
American or European farmer of small
means. To-day Hawaii imports most
of the necessary foodstuffs consumed.
Experiment has demonstrated that
with a rich soil, variety of temperature
and salubrious climate all kinds of
vegetables, fruits, feed and grain can
be successfully and profitably grown,
and a market is always at hand. With
an increase of a small farmer class will
come an increase for the merchant, the
transportation company and the capi
talist. Politically, we shall have peace
and stability as compared with the un
certainty and anxiety of the past fif

HONOLULU, July 20.â T0 the Editor of The San Francisco Call: For
over five years the Hawaiian people placed, through their Queen, the
most implicit faith in the honesty and integrity of the American people to
restore to them what had been ruthlessly taken away from them, which
President Cleveland sought to do, but was frustrated. During this tim*
they have come to learn that what the Psalmist saidâ "Put not your trust
in princes"â was true. The Hawaiians, as a nation, have always looked
upon the United States as a friend. Its citizens visiting these shores have
always been unstintedly and most lavishly and hospitably entertained.
Now that the United States has finally taken the country over, it only
awaits the consummation of the act to complete the theft perpetrated on
a confiding, weak and helpless people.
Since the cry of "Annexation to the United States" was
inaugurated by those who overthrew the monarchy, the Hawaiian people
nearly as a whole have stood on the side of opposition to it, for those who
raised the hue and cry were mostly aliens intermingled with the descendants
of the American jnfssionaries, who In reality were the main movers in the
scheme, for the Hawaiians felt that under annexation they would not re
ceive the same treatment they had been accustomed to. It is admit
ted that the Hawaiians first received the privilege or the right of franchise
from the foreigners, and after enjoying it for a period of fifty years are
finally shorn of such a privilege by an objectionable and perfidious oath,
every feature of which was to burden them with the idea of infidelity and
of perjury. The reason of this is very plain, for the Hawaiians, from time
immemorial, have been taught to revere and hold an oath as being sacred,
â¢which the foreigners have finally geen fit to disregard and to treat it
lightly.
With the advent of the consummation of annexation the lot of the Ha
waiian will be "a hard one to hoe." It will benefit the boomers materially,
but not the aborigines of the country. Time only can substantiate this as
sertion.
Sorrow was plainly depicted on the face of nearly every Hawaiian pres
ent on the Pacific Mail docks the day the news arrived, and that night it was
felt in nearly every Hawaiian home of those who earnestly loved their coun
â¢ try, for it was "an abomination unto the Lord," and at the same time very
contemptible and despicable. The enthusiasm of those to whom the news
was most welcome was a mock enthusiasm. It was nothing compared to the
real sorrow among the Hawaiians, for they have gained nothing, but lost all;
that is, their individuality and their nationality, which is more than one can
bear. If the United States will be magnanimous with them and give them
the right of self-government, -which they have always enjoyed since the
coming of the foreigner, then the lot of the native will be as of yore, but
with the loss of their individuality. As the United States has gone to war
with Spain to give a lot of Cuban negroes independence and self-govern
ment, why not do the same to the Hawaiians instead of annexing them
against their wish?
They have always been a free and Independent people and amenable to
their chiefs and the laws placed over them, and now to be placed in subjec
tion without just cause except avarice and greed of territory is a matter
hard to comprehend. They (the Hawaiians) have striven to oppose annexa
tion and are very much in evidence and on record as opposing the nefarious
plans of certain unprincipled schemers to subjugate them. As regards
their future, none can at this time foretell -what is to be their lot.
The Hawaiian people, nearly as a unit, feel that with annexation
they will be worse off and be downtrodden as are the Irish people. In
consistency is now a new jewel to the American people, and the consumma
tion of annexation is the worst blot of dishonor on the American es
cutcheon, after they themselves had rebelled against constituted authority
for freedom and are now waging war for freedom as against "taxation with
out representation." Freedom hereafter will be a misnomer and will be mis
applied as far as the Hawaiians are concerned in connection with American
action and treatment. F. J. TESTA.
ernment Hawaii is in a political tur- .
moil. People are asking their neigh- I
bors who is to be the first Governor
under the new order of things. Pres- |
ldent Dole was spoken of quite freely j
as the man who was foremost in the >
race for the appointment. He has,
however, many opponents, not only
among annexationists, but the native
Hawaiians stand almost as a unit
against his appointment. It was be
lieved, however, up to the time of the
arrival of the Alameda that Dole had
been selected by McKinley for the place
and societies were being Quietly formed |
to bring organized opposition against i
his appointment. Sewall and Hatch j
were spoken of as being more popular ;
men and men more in touch with the
people. Sewall was chosen as the fa
vorite by several of the political clubs
and particularly by the American Un
ion party, and the next steamer from
the islands will carry many strong
recommendations to President McKin
ley from the residents of Hawaii to
name Sewall as the first Governor of j
America's new territory.
Then the Alameda brought news of
the appointment of Dole as a member
of the commission, and in the minds of I
many it was considered as understood ,
in Washington that Sewall would re- â 
celve the appointment of Governor.
On aJI sides none but warmest ex
pressions of kindness and sympathy
are heard for Princess Kaiulani, who
would have succeeded Queen Laliuoka
lani to the throne. It was the fondest
hope of the native Hawaiians to have
the gentle Princess as their ruler. She
was educated at the best colleges in
Europe, and given a deep insight into
the mysteries of constitutional govern
ment to fit her for the position destiny
seemed to will her to occupy. Few
young people had better prospects
than the Princess and heir apparent to
the throne to rule one of the most hos
pitable and loving nations on the earth,
ajid she lost it aJI through no fault of
her own. The Republican Government
of Hawaii felt the position in which
the Princess had been placed by the
overthrow of the monarchy and they
granted her an allowance from the
public fund to enable her to maintain
her station in life. It was a small
amount and many of the supporters of
the Government felt that it was far
too small. One of the hopes now en
tertained by the native Hawaiians is
that the American Government will
continue the allowance and possibly
increase it.
"I am sorry the American nation has
taken these islands as a part of its
territory," said the Princess. "I had
hoped it would never occur. I do not
know what will become of the Ha
waiian people. I fear it will mean their
extinction and social degradation. Now
that we are annexed we must make
the best of it, and I only hope the
American people will give these islands
such government ns will foster and
advance the Hawaiian race."
The business men of Honolulu began
to talk freely of a cable between the
Hawaiian Islands and the American
coast when the first enthusiasm of the
news of annexation brought by the
Coptic subsided. Such a cable has
been projected many times, but the
plans always came to naught for the
want of sufficient government support,
and the merchants were almost in de
spair of ever getting in closer commun
ication with the American coast than
by steamer and sailing vessel. Then
the Coptic arrived with the news that
brought cheer into the hearts of the
annexationists and wue to the Hawai
ians, who love their deposed Queen and
the gentle Princess whom they hoped
at some time to hail as their ruler. The
word cable was coupled with that of
annexation by the business men, and
many merchants freely mingled the
two subjects in their conversation and
cheered for the cable as well as the
new flag, that in a few days will float
over their lands, in their jubilation.
Their mixed celebration was not
without some foundation. About the
time the Coptic arrived in the harbor
the news spread among the business
men that an agreement had been
signed with the Hawaiian Government
that would assure the operation of tel

egraphic communication with the
American coast within a few months,
While the -American Senate was dis
cussing the Newlands resolution Pres
ident Dole and his Cabinet were affix
ing their signature to an agreement
with the Pacific Cable Company, ot
which J. Pierpont Morgan is at the
head, providing for the construction of
a cable that would bring the little is
lands far out in the Pacific close to the
American capital.
It was stipulated In that agreement
that the cable should be constructed
and in operation between Hawaii and
the American coast within two years
and a year later the cable must be ex
tended and in operation to the coast of
Japan. The island of Oahu. on which
Honolulu is situated, was designated
as the main landing place of the cable.
The Hawaiian Government agreed,
in consideration Of the Pacific Cable
Company constructing- and operating
the cable, to grant the cable company
the exclusive right and privilege of
landing and operating cables in the
Hawaiian Islands for the period of
twenty years. The Government re
serves* the right to take possession of
the cable lines in case of war, rebellion
or any other such emergency and at
such times to exercise supervision over
all matter transmitted over the wires.
It is agreed that the rate for trans
mitting messages between the Hawaii
an Islands and the Pacific Coast shall
not exceed thirty-five cents a word and
for official dispatches and press matter
the rate shall not exceed one-fourth
the amount charged for ordinary pri
vate messages. The rate between Ha
waii and Japan shall not exceed ninety
cents a word and all official messages
between Hawaii and Japan shall be
transmitted free during the time the
cable company shall have the exclu
sive right to maintain its lines in the
islands. : -;.
The agreement is signed by Attor
ney Alfred S. Hartwell, who represents
the cable company, and he says it is
the desire of his company to complete
the cable as quickly as possible. A
heavy bond is to be given to guarantee
the faithful performance of the con
tract, and the work of construction
will commence as soon as the officers
of the company in New York receive
the copy of the agreement that has
been made with the Hawaiian Gov
ernment.
The cable will be laid on the route of
the survey recently made by the Amer
ican Government and that will bring
the landing place of the wires at some
point in Monterey Bay.
Elaborate preparations are being
made for the formal hoisting of the
American flag over the executive build
ing of the Hawaiian Republic, and the
transfer of the islands to the Govern
ment of the United States. The An
nexation Club has taken the initiative
and a committee from it has had sev
eral conferences with President Dole
and his Cabinet. The programme as
it is now arranged will be subject to
change according to the ideas of Ad
miral Miller, who will represent the
American Government and take for
mal possession of the islands: The \
pomp and ceremony as arranged will
make a magnificent spectacle. There
will be a parade of Hawaiian civil and
militia bodies and American sailors
and marines, as well as troops, should
there be any transports in the harbor.
The procession will reach the executive
building at noon and then the formal
transfer vill be made. The Hawaiian
flag w-ill be saluted by twenty-one
guns. Then- it will be hauled down to
the air of the Hawaiian national an
them. The American flag will be then
run up to the: air of the American na
tional anthem and it will also receive
a salute of twenty-one guns. Speech
making will follow and in the evening
there will be a ball in the executive
building. ;-.v '-'."- ''â¢* '"â -'.:â 
Some of the more conservative people
of Honolulu believe that there will be
little ceremony at the formal transfer
of the islands, Admiral "Miller Â«*s^?,Â£Â«U r 
known in Hawaii and. he has always
been an admirer of the Hawaiians. It
is thought that he will, in deference to
the feeling of the Hawaiian people, in
sist that the ceremony be as simple and
as brief as possible.-
The flag that was hauled down from
the staff -of the executive building by
Commissioner Blount will be the one
that Admiral Miller will raise over the
islands. .
NAME FOR THE NAVAL
FIGHT OFF SANTIAGO
Styled by an Official of the Naviga
tion Bureau the "Battle of
July 3."
WASHINGTON, July 27.â The absence
of a name for the remarkable naval
battle between the American and Spanish
fleets that resulted in the destruction of
that of Cervera's. has been felt in the
clumsy attempts made in official reports
to refer to the engagement. Lieutenant
AVhittlesev of the navigation bureau has
evolved a name that is likely to be for
mally accepted for the engagement. It is
the "Battle of July 3."
He does this for the reason that some
of the most famous battles that the world
has known have been christened as of the
date upon which they were fought. Thus,
the "Battle of July 1" was attached to
the famous naval engagement fought in
mid-ocean between Lord Howe's fleet on
one side and the combined French and
Spanish fleets on the other, which result
ed in a memorable victory for the British
navy.SAMPSON HAD

WASHINGTON, July 27.â Among- the
papers included in Admiral Sampson's
report was the order of battle to be
followed in the event of an engage
ment and various regulations to be ob
served in maintaining the blockade, as
follows:
U. S. FLAGSHIP NEW YORK,
First Rate.
Off Santiago de Cuba, June 2.
The fleet off Santiago de Cuba will bÂ©
organized during the operations against
that port and the Spanish squadron aa
follows:
Fir?t squadron, under the personal com
mand of the eomraander-in-chief â New

Second squadron, under command of
Commodore S hlej -Brooklyn, V â¢â¢nn.chu
setts, T.'xas. irblehead, Vlx< i
Vessels subsequently joining will be as
signed by the commander-in-chief.
The vessels â will blockade Santiago de
Cuba closely, ping about six miles
from the Morro in the day time and clos
ing- in at night, the lighter vessels well m
shore. The first squadron will blockade
on the east side of the port, and the sec
ond squadron on the west side. If the en
emy tries to escape the ships must close
and engage as soon a? possible and en-
P-avorP -avor to sink the vessels or force them to
:i ashore In the channel. It Is not con- i
!ered that the shore batteries are of
sufficient power to do any material Injury
to battleships.
In smooth weather the vessels will coal
on station. If withdrawn to coal else
where. or for other duty, the blockading
vessels on either side will cover the angle
thus left vacant.
Memorandum No. 13â After careful con
sideration of the various schemes of
maintaining an effective blockade of San
tiago de Cuba at night which have been
advanced. I hav-e decided upon the fol
lowing, which will be maintained until
further orders:
The weather permitting:, three picket
launches, detailed from the ships of the
pquadron each evening, will occupy posi
tions one mile from the Morro, one to the
eastward, one to the westward and one
at the harbor entrance. On a circle drawn
T 1i5. 1 ?-* t rfftjf.~Â» of â  two miles from the

Vixen to the westward, from one-half â¢
mile to one mile from the shore; the Su
wanee south of the Morro and the Dol
phin tc the eastward, between one-half >
mile and one mile from the shore. The !
remaining vessels will retain the positions*
already occupied; but they will take es
pecial care to keep within a four-mile cir-
All vessels may turn their engines
Whenever desirable to keep them In readi
ness for immediate use. and while so do-
Ing may turn in a small circle, but with
out losing proper bearing or distance
The signal for the enemy will be two
red lights flrfd in succession. If the
enemy is a torpedo boat, these two red
lights will be followed by a green light
I would call attention to the absolute
necessity of a close blockade of this port
especially at night and in bad weather'
In the daytime. If ckar. the distance
Bhal not be greater than six miles. At
night, or in thick weather, not more than
four mile*. The end to be attained Justi
fies the risk of torpedo attack, and that
risk must be taken.
The escape of the Spanish vessels at
this Juncture would be a serious blow
to our prestige and a speedy end to the
war.
Attention is called to the provisional
signals established by general order No 9
Memorandum No. 14â During the dark
hours of the night searchlights will be
used as follows:
The lowa, Oregon and Massachusetts
will take turns of two hours eachâ from
dark to 8 p. m. and from 8 p. m. to 10
p. m.. etc.â ln keeping one searchlight di
rectly on the harbor entrance, maintain
ing carefully during that time their block
ading positions. Should a vessel's light
fall, the next in order will at once take up
the duty.
The picket launch and vidette sta
tioned south of the Morro will move to
one side or the other sufficiently to get
dear of the beam of light.
The vessels on each flankâ the Brooklyn
and the Texas on the western side, the
New York and the New Orleans on the
eastern Bideâ take two hours in turn
in using one searchlight from time to
time on the coast line, swinging It to
ward the Morro, but avoiding the Illumi
nation of the flanking videttes on the in
side line. The light should never be
turned off more than five minutes at a
time. From time to time the horizon will
be swept.
Attention is called to bad and careless
handling of searchlights. Last night
some of the lights were kept high in the
air and again wore swept rapidly from
Bide to side. Under such circumstances
a searchlight is worse than useless The
beams must be directed to the horizon
and must be moved very steadily and
slowly. Not less than three minutes
should be employed in sweeping through
an area of 90 degrees. The best way to
discover a torpedo boat la by its smoke
and even then this will not be seen unl
ess the light is very well handled.
Memorandum No. 17-The Commanding
Officer-Sir: When on the blockade ves
sels will, unless for some special tem
porary reason for the contrary, habitual
ly head toward the lead instead of away
from it. I
Memorandum No. 1&-Slr: While block- '
ading the Spanish fleet In Santiago de
Cuba vessels will hereafter maintain a"
blockading distance of four miles during
the day time. This distance will not be
exceeded except by permission or under
special circumstances.
Memorandum No. 20â Sir: The com- i
mander-in-chief desires again to call the
attention of commanding officers to the
positions occupied by the blockading I

It is now directed that all ships 'keep
within a distance of four miles of the

must not be exceeded.
If the vessel Is coaling or is otherwise
restricted in her movements, she must,
nevertheless, keep within this distance.'

disregard of the directions which have
already been given on this head has led
to endless confusion. Many times during
the day the fleet is so scatter.'. l that it
would be p.?rfectly possible for the enemy
to come out of the harbor and meet with
very little opposition.
The commander-in-chief hopes that
strict attention will be given this order.
OBSERVATIONS ON THE
FLAGSHIP NEW YORK
WASHINGTON, July 27.-The fol
lowing reports of Captain Chadwlck of
the New York, Captain Taylor of the
Indiana, Captain Philip of the Texas
and Lieutenant Wainwright of the
Gloucester on the destruction of Cer
vera's fleet, which are included in Ad
miral Sampson's report, were made
public to-day:
U. S. FLAGSHIP NEW YORK. First
rate, Playa del Este, July 4. 1898.â Sir: I
have the honor to make the following
report of the part taken by this ship In
the action of yesterday, during and fol
lowing the sortie of Admiral Cervera's
squadron.
The ship had started at 8:50 for the
army landing at Siboney, the Command
er-in-chief having an appointment with
the general commanding- the army. A
few minutes after the crew had been
called to quarters for Sunday inspection,
firing was heard and a ship was seen
leaving the harbor entrance. The helm
was at once put over, the crew called to
general quarters, signal "close in toward
the harbor entrance and attack vessels"
made; orders given to spread all fires, and
the ship hastened back for the enemy,
whose ships were seen successively com
ing out at a high speed. The flagship
Infanta Maria Teresa was first, then
another armored cruiser of the same class
(which turned out to be the Vizcaya).
followed by the Cristobal Colon, an ar
mored cruiser (Oquendo) and the torpedo
boat destroyers Furor and Pluton.
The nearer ships had Immediately en
gaged, and by the time we were off the
entrance the flagship was afire and soon
ashore. The Indiana, and Gloucester were
actively engaged with the torpedo boats.
This ship fired some four-inch shells at the
one nearer the port, toward which she
was already headed, seemingly attempt-
Ing to return, but she was already prac
tically out of the fight, while the boiler
of the more advanced one had blown up,
showing a vast column of condensed
steam. During this time the batteries,
whose line of fire wo had crossed close
to. repeatedly fired on us. but without
effect. No return was made to this fire
A shell from the west battery fell within
200 yards of the ships when we were over
four miles to the westward and we had
thought ourselves entirely out of range.
This ship stood on, leaving the Glouces
ter, which had shown herself so capable,
to look after the survivors in the torpedo
boats. By this time a second cruiser was
ashore and burning (the Almiranto
Oquendo) while the third, the Vizcaya,
and the Cristobal Colon were still steam
in? rapidly westward. The Indiana was
now signaled (11:26 a. m.) to return to her
blockading position, to look after any
thing which might be there. Shortly af
terward the Viscaya turned shoreward,
and smoke began to issue from her after
part, and by the time she was ashore on
the reef she was ablaze. The lowa gave
much assistance in the rescue of the Viz
caya's people.
This ship stood on in chase of the Cris

It was evident, however, that the Colon
would give us a lengthy chase, and at
noon the crew left quarters and went to
dinner.
About 12:50 o'clock the Oregon opened

to strike beyond the Colon. This made
her capture a foregone conclusion, and
shortly after 1 o'clock she turned in to

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 27.â
Balm has been applied to the injured
feelings of the Cubans, who resent the
fact that they were not permitted to
enter the city of Santiago. Songo, a
small town eighteen miles from here
on the railway line, has been sur
rendered to the American forces, and
the Cubans under General Castillo have
been permitted to occupy it. It was
held by a garrison of 350 Spanish
soldiers. CÂ«ptaln Carvahal, the com
mander, gave up the town as soon as
officially advised of the capitulation of
General Toral's army.
Dr. Joaquin Castillo, brother of the
general, will leave for Washington in
a few days with the petition from
Cuban residents in which President
McKinley is asked to permit the Cuban
forces to enter Santiago.

INDIANA'S CAPTAIN
PROUD OF HIS MEN
WASHINGTON, July V.â Captain Tay
lor of the Indiana reports as follows:
U. 8. S. INDIANA, FIRST RATE,
off Santiago de Cuba, July 4.â Sir:
T have the honor to submit the
following report of the operations of the
Indiana in the action of July 3 with the
Spanish squadron off Santiago de Cuba:
At t Â»:.77 a. m., while the crew were at
quarters preliminary to general muster,
Doted two puns fired from the lowa and
general order, "Enemy's ship 6 escap
ing." flying. At once cleared ship for ac
tion" and the crew were at the guns in a
remarkably short time, all officers and
men showing an alacrity that Indicated
clearly 'heir pleasure at the opportunity
offered them.
The Spanish squadron was feen
emerging from the harbor and in a fetv
moments a general action ensued. The
leading ship, which proved to be the In
fanta Maria Teresa, flying the flag of
Vice-Admiral Cervt-ra, was followed by
the other \essels of the squadron as fol
lows: Vizcaya, Cristobal Colon. Oquendo
and the torpedo boat destroyers Furor
and Pluton. The enemy's vessels head
ed to the westward ami our ships head
ed in the same direction, keeping as
nearly abreast of th m as possible.
This ship fired on all of them as they
came out, one by one, and continued the
action later by firing principally on the
Maria Teresa, Oquendo, Furor and Plu
ton. Several of our shells were seen to
take effect on these vessels. Our sec
ondary battery guns were directed par
ticularly on the destroyers, as also were
the six-inch guns. The destroyers were
sunk through the agency of our guns and
those of the Gloucester, which vespel had
come up and engaged them in close board.
The initial fire of the last two ships
was dtrectM at this vessel, and although
falling very close only struck the ship
twice, without any Injury to the Bhip or
j crew.
Our ranges were obtained by angles on
Morro as the ships emerged and then by
angles on the tops of the rear ships. The
I ranges wert from 4000 to 2000 yards, ob
! served from the top. From the bridge I
: could see that our shooting was excellent
| and showed its effect. One of our thir
tecm-inch shells was seen to enter the
Maria Teresa under the quarter-deck and
explode, and that ship was observed on
fire very shortly afterward.
About 10:15 a. m. we observed the Ma
ria Teresa and Oquendo on fire and head
ing for the beach, the fire from their guns
having ceased. We then devoted special
attention to prevent the escape ot the de-
I stroyers, which appeared more than a
; match for the Gloucester, she being tha
only small vessel near to engage them.
; They wore soon seen to blow up. appar
| ently struck by our six-inch and six
i pounders. We now fired our large guns
; at the Vizcaya, which was at long range.
; She made for the shore after being on
I fire, and her battery was silenced. These
ships hauled down their colors as they
i made for the beach. The Spanish flag
i ship hoisted the white flag as she
â - grounded.
We now ceased firing. The Colon was

signaled. "Go back and guard entrance
â or the harbor." Several explosions were
observed on board the burning ships. At
â¢ noon we turned and stood to the east
! ward for our station, In obedience *â > the
above signal. We observed the Harvard
and several transports standing to tho
westward.
At 12:30 o'clock the Resolute came
within hail and informed us by mega
phone that a battle-ship was sighted to
tho eastward, standing toward us. Later
the Harvard passed, confirming the infor
mation, and adding that the ship was
painted white. Wo made out the vessel
ahead and stood for her with our guns
bearing. She proved to be the Austrian
i armored cruiser Kaiserin Maria Theresa.
She sent an officer on board and request
ed permission to enter the harbor. I re
ferred him to the commander-in-ohie.f.
She then stood on to the westward and
we resumed our station.
During this action we used no ar
mor-piercing shell except tho smokeless
powder slx-pounders, and the good effect
of the common shell is shown by the
effect on the enemy's ships and the short
time taken to disable them without pierc
ing their armor and with almost no In
jury to our ships.
The guns and mounts â¢worked well:
only two failures of electric primers
a During the afternoon sent boats with
surgeon on shore to burning vessels to
nssi^t in caring for the wounded. The
boats returned, bringing one squad of of
i fleers and fifteen men afl prisoners.
The conduct of the officers and crew
was in every respect commendable. Cool
nÂ«M and good discipline prevailed,
coupled with a marked enthusiasm. This
desirable condition of affairs is largely
due to the efforts of the officers, and I
desire to commend to the commander-in
chief the executive officer. Lieutenant
Commander John A. Rodgers, and all the
officers of the ship for the part taken by
the Indiana in bringing about this great
victory and the complete destruction of
the enemy's squadron. Very rospect

THE TEXAS CLAIMS HER
SHARE OF THE GLORY
WASHINGTON July 27. âCaptain
Philip of the Texas reports as follows:
UNITED STATES SHIP TEXAS, off
Santiago, July 4.â Sir: In accordance with
the requirements of navy regulations, I
respectfully submit the following state
ment, la rurard to the vast the Texas took
has issued orders prohibiting the col- I
lection of municipal and Government |
taxes on merchants' goods for con- I
sumption here as well as small taxes
upon small packages for the transient |
population. The local board for harbor i
improvements has notified the Govern
or that it has received no taxes. It has
been seeking to have collected taxes
authorized by the proclamation of ,
General Shafter.
Orders have also been issued to every '
householder to report to the Mayor or i
Military Governor every death occur
ring in his household. The penalty for
non-compliance is thirty days' hard la
bor in the streets. Policemen have
been ordered to report all cases of
malignant disease in their district and
all unsanitary conditions which they
may observe. The surgeon in charge '
informs me that there are 2000 cases of !
fever among the troops, of which more
than 500 are yellow fever. A new field I
hospital will be established r.ear Gen- \

terday. At daylight on the morning of
the 3d the TexuÃ stood out from the en
trance to the harbor, taking day block
ading positions about three miles from
Morro (Morro bearing N.N.E.).
At 9:3sâ Morro bearing N. by E. H E.,
distant 5100 yardsâ the enemy's ships were
sighted standing out of the harbor. Im
mediately a general signal was made. !
This 6lgnal was followed by the lowa's
almost tit the Fame time.
The ship, as per orders, was heading In
toward trie entrance; went ahead at full I
speed, putting holm hard starboard, and
ordering forced draught on all boilers the
officer of the deck. lieutenant L. M. Bris- ;
tol, having given the general alarm and |
beat to quarters for action at the sanie
time.
As the leader, bearing the admiral's
flag, appeared in the entrance, sue opened
fire, which was nt 9:40 returned by the
Texas at a rang' of 4Kie yards while clos
ing in. The ship leading' was of the Viz
caya class and the flagship. Four ships
came outâ evidently the Vizcaya, the
Oquondo. the Maria Teresa and the Colon
âfollowed by two torpedo boat de<Â»trov- !
era. Upon seeing these we immediately
opened fire on them with our secondary
battery, the main battery at the time be
ing f-ngaged with the second and third i
in line. Owing to our secondary i
buttery, together wiui the lowa and |
Gloucester, the two destroyers were
forced to beach and sunk.
Whilst warmly engaged with the third
In li.ie, which was abreast and engaging
tne Texas, our fire was blanketed for a
s'..ort time by the Oregon forging ahead i
and engaging the second ship. This third
ship, after a spirited fire, sheered in '
shore, and at 10:35 ran up a white flag, i
We then ceased fire on the third and
opened fire with our forward guns at
long range (6600 yards) on the second ehlp
ewhlch waa thru engaged with the Ore
gon i until 11:05, when she (the second
ship} sheered on to the beach on fire.
At 11:10 she struck her colors, when we
ceased fire and gave chase with the
Brooklyn and Oregon for the leading ship
until 12:20, when the Colon sheered Into
the bearh and hauled down her colors,
leaving th^m on deck at the foot of her
flagstaff. We then shut oft forced draught
and proceeded at a reduced speed to close
up.
I would state that during this chase
the Texas was holding her own with the
Colon: she leading us about four miles at
tho start. The reports of the executive,
officer and the surgeon are transmitted.
I have the pleasure of stating that the
entire battery c,f the Texas Is in a most
excellent condition and ready for any
nen-loe required by the commander-ln

efficiency of the two turret guns, due
to the alterations recently made by Lieu

HEROIC WORK OF THE
LITTLE GLOUCESTER
WASHINGTON. July 27.âLieuten
ant Commander Wainwright of the
Gloucester submits the following:
U. S. S. GLOUCESTER, off Santiago
de Cuba, July 6. â Sir: I have
the honor to report that at the
battle of Santiago on July 3 the
officers and crew of the Gloucester were
uninjured and the vessel was not injured
In hull or machinery, the battery only re
quiring some slight overhauling.
I inclose herewith a copy of the re
port of the executive officer, made In
compliance with paragraph 525, page 110,
Naval Regulations, which report I believe
to be correct in all particulars. I also
inclose copies of the reports of the several
officers, which may prove valuable for fu
ture reference.
It was the plain duty of the Glouces
ter to look after the destroyers and she
was held back, gaining steam, until they
appeared at the entrance. The Indiana
poured in a hot fire from all her sec
ondary batteries upon the destroyers but
Captain Taylor's signal, "Gunboats cloae
in, " gave security that we would not be
fired upon by our own ships. The lead
ing destroyer was injured. Our course
was converging, necessarily, but as soon
as she slackened her speed we headed
directly for the vessels, firing both port
and starboard batteries, as the occasion
offered.
All the officers and nearly all of the
men deserve my highest praise for their
conduct during the action. The escape of
the Gloucester was due mainly to the ac
curacy and rapidity of her fire. The effi
ciency of this fire, as wel. as that of the
ship generally, was largely due to the in
telligent and unremitting efforts of the
executive officer. Lieutenant Harry P.
Huse. The result Is more to his credit
when it is remembered that a large pro
portion of the officers and men were un
trained when the Gloucester was commis
sioned. Throughout the action he was on
the bridge and carried out my orders with
great calmness. That we were able to
close in with the destroyersâ and until
we did so they were not seriously Injur
edâwas largely due to the skill of Passed
Assistant Engineer George W. McElroy.
The blower was put on and the speed in
creased to 17 knots without causing a tube
to leak or a brass to heat. Lieutenant
Wood, Lieutenant George H. Norman Jr.
and Ensign John T. Edson not only con
trolled the fire of the guns in their di
visions and prevented waste of ammuni
tion, but they also did some excellent
shooting themselves. Acting Assistant
Surgeon Burgess took charge of one of
the guns and fired it himself occasionally.
Acting Assistant Paymaster Alexander
Brown had charge of the two Colt guns,
firing one himself, and they did excellent
work. Assistant Engineer A. 11 Proctor
carried my orders from the bridge and
occasionally fired a gun when I found it
was not being served quite satisfactorily.
All were cool and active at a time when
they could have but little hope of escap
ing uninjured.
Lieutenants Wood and Norman, En
sign Edson and Assistant Engineer Proc
tor were in charge of the boats engaged

ADVERTISEMENTS.
GUANTANAMO TROOPS
HAVE SURRENDERED
Condition of the Town Described as
Awful, the Garrison Literally
Starving.
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. July 27.â
Lieutenant Colonel Angel Rosell, who,
after taking confirmation of the in
structions to surrender from General
Toral to General Paroja, Military Gov
ernor of Guant&namo, returned here
this afternoon, said to an Asso
ciated Press correspondent that the
first intimation that Guantanamo had
of the surrender of Santiago and the
terms thereof . was on July 23, when
Rear Admiral Sampson sent a letter to
General Paroja asking what number of
rations should be sent to his garrison,
as they had been surrendered on the
17th.
General Paroja, being ignorant of the
surrender, refused to credit the message
and accept rations, answering Admiral
Sampson to that effect. Admiral Samp
son then sent a copy of the terms of
surrender, whereupon General Paroja
decided to inquire of General Toral at
Santiago whether the news was true,
and Lieutenant Colonel Rosell was ap
pointed to come here. He returned with
this confirmation and the surrender of
Guantanamo took place yesterday.
Colonel Rosell says the conditions of
Guantanamo are awful and the troops
are literally starving. For the last
eight days they have had no food. On
mounting guard the soldiers wero
obliged to sit. being too weak to stand,
and it was impossible to make them
build trenches, as they fell from ex
haustion. There are 2000 sick in Guan
tanamo, suffering from diseases in
creased by hunger. The conditions of
Guantanamo, Colonel Rosell says, are
worse than those at Santiago.
Lieutenant Colonel Ewens of the
Ninth Infantry received the surrender
of Guantanamo yesterday. The Span
ish troops will remain In the town un
til transported.

"I have telegraphed Admiral Samp

"Port Guanica, Porto Rico. July 25,

Captain Hlgginson's brief cablegram
gave keen delight to the Navy Depart
ment, because of the unstinted praise
it accorded to popular and dashing '
"Dick" Wainwright. the commander of j
the little Gloucester. Wainwright, !
having been commanded by his supe
rior, Higginson, for his actions at Gu
anica, enjoys the solitary distinction of
being the only officer attached to
Sampson's fleet who has been twice
officially commended since the war be
gan.
The War Department has reconciled
Itself to the summary change in its
plans made by General Miles when he
landed at Guaniea, instead of "or the
east coast of Porto Rico," as previous
ly agreed upon. It is surmised that
he was led tv make this change by rea
son of the detention of his lighters, and
foresaw a week's delay in effecting a
landing unless he went in where he did
and ran his troops and artillery direct
ly ashore. He thus has avoided ex
posing his troops to the hardships suf
fered by Shafier's men, as they lay
for bo many days off Santiago. It is
suggested that the general has scored
an important diplomatic advantage in
setting foot on Porto Hican soil before
\he first "V^rture.s had been received
from Spain looking toward peace.
The departure of General Brooke and
General Haincs from Hampton Roads,
vhich is expected to-morrow, to re
inforce General Miles In Porto Rico, Is
a very substantial evidence of the pur
pose of the Government not to abate
th â¢ prosecution of military operations
at this stage of the negotiations. The
two generals are embarked on rapid
liners and should reach General Miles
by next Monday, putting him into pos
:. of a sufficient force to begin
th'- movement upon San Juan Â«t once.

certain that General Wilson, with that

Enemy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., July 27.â News
reached here to-day of the attempted
landing on Cuban shores of a large ex
pedition, men and arms, from the
steamer Wanderer, which left Key
West about a week ago. Banes, west
of Havana, was the point selected for
debarkation, but on arriving there the
expedition was confronted by a body
of cavalry numbering a thousand or
more and a sharp engagement ensued.
The Wanderer was to have been met
by a party of Cubans, who had evident
ly been driven off by the Spanish forces
before the arrival of the Wanderer.
The Wanderer, which was not under
convoy, drew up about 400 yards- from
the shore and began discharging her
cargo by means of small boats. At
first there were no signs of resistance,
and a portion of the supplies had al
ready been placed on the beach when
a vigorous rifle fire was opened on the
members of the expedition from a
wooded growth lining the beach, and a
force of Spanish cavalrymen burst into
Bight.
There were about two score of sharp
shooters who evidently expected the
expedition, and they attempted to
cover the retreat by lying fiat and re
turning the Spaniard's fire. They
picked off a number of the cavalry
men, and as the opposing force backed
to the woods the Wanderer's men got
their boats off, but not before William
Davis, mate; William Ross, seaman;
Gabriel Alvarez, Felix Lopez and
Rojolu Garcia had been slightly
wounded.
After the Wanderer's men had got
away the Spaniards pushed down to
the beach and resumed their fire, pep
pering the hull of the Wanderer with
Mauser bullets, but inflicting no fur
ther damage.
The gunboat Vicksburg returned
here this morning after having been
thirty-eight days in the blockade. She
reports that on Tuesday last, while
two miles off shore, west of Havana,
the Vedado battery and the battery re
cently erected fired three shots each at
her. The shells fell close to the ship,
and she quickly got out of range.

Charleston, has already formed a Junc
tion with General Miles and his army
at Guanica Bay, no Information to that
effect has been received. General Miles
informed the War Department that he
had sent a vessel to meet General Wil
son's expedition and guide it to Guan
ica. This was done because General
Wilson expected when he left Charles
ton to land at Point Fajarde.
It is expected that General Schwan
and his command will arrive at Guan
ica to-morrow, or, at the latest. Friday.
Following Schwan, General Brooke ia
scheduled to sail from Newport News
early to-n;orrow morning and will ar
rive at the rendezvous not later than
Sunday morning.
It is not expected by the War De
partment officials that General Miles
will attempt to bring on a general en
gagement before the latter part of next
week.

MADRID, July 27.â A very strong ef
! fort is being made by the press here to
have me sent out of the country. El
Imparchial, a very largely circulated
paper, published again to-day an arti
cle entitled "El Espoinage Yankee,"
and probably purposes publishing it
daily until it forces the Government to
expel me. According to the Heraldo
and Imparchial the Government yester
day discussed my presence and decided
on immediate action. El Imparcial's
article on Yankee spying is very cur
ious. It says: "The Council has been
occupied with work done in Spain by
correspondents of certain Yankee news
papers. The Herald has even received
and published a plan of the fortifica
tions at Tarifa, including both old and
new batteries at that place. The Her
ald also receives telegrams about the
defensive work of Cadiz. The Minis
ters were surprised to find this work of
spying brought to such a point and
have decided to take steps to prevent
its being carried out in future."
El Liberal publishes the same item
about the plan of Tarifa, with the com
ment that it confirms once more the
grounds there were for its solemn ab- I
jurations to the Government to take I
active measures against correspond- i
ents who are spies kept by the enemy
in Spain. Speakinr about the plan, It I
says: "While we patriotically and in {
obedience to the orders of the Govern- '
ment suppress all information that I
might be of utility to the enemy, Jour- i
nallsts and experts in the service of the I
Americian nation are allowed to work
unmolested in providing their army
and navy with all details that can
facilitate them in the task they have
undertaken. If it is true the Govern
ment has decided to take vigorous
measures to bring this spying to an
end, public opinion will entirely ap
plaud its determination. Such steps
ought to have been taken much ear
lier.
El Heraldo publishes a note that
active operations are going to be
undertaken against foreign corre
spondents in S-ain, particularly in
Madrid.

BENICIA, J-'- 27.-The sad news was
telegraphed this afternoon to *.ie relatives
ami friends of the Right Rev. J. H. D.
Wlngfleld that he was dead. Notwith
standing he had been ailing some time, it
was hoped that he was getting better,
! and his deal., was a surprise that has cast
a gloom over the community and the
church of winch he was a leading light.
j The immediate cause of death was a
stroke of paralysis.
Bishop Wingfield was born in Ports
mouth, Va., on September 24, 1833. He re
ceived his education at St. Timothy's,
Maryland, in which institution he was
; for two years one of the (acuity. He took
I a course of study in tne Theological Sem
1 lnary of Virginia, anu was made a Jea
! con In Christ church, Little Rock, on
1 January 17, IXSB. and in the following year
he was ordained a priest. Until 1871 lie "was
; connected with the Episcopal church in
Portsmouth ana Petersburg. Va. In the
â  latter place he founded the St. Paul
School for Girls.
| In 1874 he became identified with the
Pacific Coast, having been elected rector
lof Trinity Church, San * rancisco. His
talents as a scholar earned for him the
degree of doctor of alvln'ty in 1869, and
that of doctor of laws in 1874 from nls
| alma mater, Mary and William l'o..ege.
On December 2. 1874. he was consecrated
Bishop of the missionary district of
Northern California, and took up his resi
dence in Benicia, where he established
the missionary college of St. Augustine
and later St. Mary's Seminary of the Pa
cific Coast, both of which institutions
were so well and successfully conducted
that Benicia became known as the Athens
of the Pacific Coast.
Bishop Wlngrteld was an untiring
worker, and his remarkable energy and
perseverance enabled him to build up tne
interests of the church in the northern
district beyond all expectations. His abili
ties were so well appreciated that he *vas
offered the assistant Bishopric of Missis
sippi, the Bishopric of Louisiana ana the
see of Easton.
He wrote many articles in the Interest
of the church. Hi? published works are:
"The Sacrament of Warriors," "Answers
to the Charge of Uncharitableness" and
"The Churchman's Gratitude."
Bishop Wlngfleld in his home relations
was idolized by his family, and as a mem
ber of the community he was thoroughly
respected. He was courteous and affable
to all who had business with him, and his
charity to the unfortunate was unbound
ed. He was brave to denounce wrong and
strong to uphold right.
He nad the courage -f his convictions,
which was demonstrated during the civil
war when he refused to take the oath
of allegiance; and the same courage
brought him to express his gratitude in
the later years of his life that the United
States was one people and one nation.
I Hiring his life he had many troubles
and trials which resulted in his having
to close the schools unfler his charge but
In the greatness of hid charity the last
act of his life was to pray for 'those that
had injured him. He had been unable
to attend to the duties of his office since
May. 1896, owing to a stroke of paralysis
received at that time and which event
unlly was the cause of his dpath. A
widow and one daughter survive him
His remains will bo tak^n to Petersburg
Va., for burial, and hfs funeral will take
place on Friday at 6:30 p. m.
WATSON'S SQUADRON
MAY HASTEN PEACE
NEW YORK, July 27.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: With an interest almost as
keen as that felt by Spain the powers
of Europe are awaiting the announce
ment of the terms upon which Presi
dent McKinley will be willing to end
the war. This reply will make plain
the policy of the administration with
respect to the Philippines. It will
likely cause an exchange of notes be
tween the powers, and may prove to
be a rivet which may bind Continental
Europe together for the purpose of
bringing pressure to bear upon this
Government looking to the withdrawal
of its demands regarding the acquisi
tion of territory in the Philippines and
other Spanish islands in that section
of the globe.
So great has been the anxiety of the
several governments to learn the in
tention of the United States with re
gard to the Philippines that they in
structed their representatives in Wash
ington to make inquiries as to our
policy. These diplomats, besides seek
ing information through the ordinary
channels, have furnished their govern
ments with such unofficial statements
and gossip of an authoritative charac
ter as they have been able to obtain.
The inquiries when addressed to the
State Department have all been of a
character to disarm suspicion of any
intention on the part of the makers to
find fault with any policy that may be
adopted by the United States, it being
stated that if not an improper ques
tion the Government of Japan, for in
stance, would like to know what the
United States proposes to do with the
Philippines. Besides Japan, several
governments made these inquiries, but
it is stated positively at the German
and French embassies that the repre
sentatives of these governments made
no representation whatever to the
United States on the subject.
To the inquiries which have been
made, however, an evasive answer has
been returned, indicating that the Gov
ernment had formulated no definite pol
icy, but the positive assertion has been
made that foreign interests will be
thoroughly protected. These inquiries
have, of course, been the subject of
much discussion by the President and
his advisers and are the cause of some
apprehension that an effort may be
made by Continental Europe to exert a
pressure upon this Government to with
draw from the Philippines.
It was to counteract such pressure
and to show Europe the demands* of the
United States were unalterable that the
President recently so largely increased
the Eastern squadron, and it is reit
erated to-day with emphasis that that
squadron will sail for Spain between
the Ist and 10th of August. If Spain is
sincere in her desire for peace the ne-
KotiationÃ of the officials will be un
doubtedly hastened by the departure of
the squadron abroad, and if she is not,
that squadron will be in a position to
attack and destroy the remnant of the
Spanish navy and make demonstrations
along the Spanish coast.
Rear Admiral Samptfon hasassembled
the armorclads at Guantanamo and is
putting them in the best possible re
pair. He will report within a week,
the authorities pxpoct, the completion
of repairs to certain ships. These will
be attached to Commodore Watson's
squadron and sent abroad.

BERLIN, July 27.â A representative of
the Hamburgische Correspondent, tele
graphing from Friedrichsruhe at 4:40 p.
m., Bays: The reports of Prince Bis
marck's serious illness are unfortunately
verified, so far as can be ascertained. The
family feared the worst yesterday. The
Prince Is weaker to-day, but as he slept
well last night, it is hoped he may again

at Friedrichsruhe.

dition of Prince Bismarck as unfavorable.
Despite his good sleep, there Is still

The Hamburger correspondent of the
Berliner Tageblatt says that it has been

that there is now a turning for the bet-
A dispatch from Friedrichsruhe to the

has been seriously ill for some days with
acute venal inflammation, but is better
to-day. He has eaten ice and takon
nourishment. There is no immediate dan
ger. \\ hat is serious is his extreme weak
ness.
In the face of conflicting statements
and the secrecy maintained at Friedrichs
ruhf, accurate accounts of Prince Bis
marck's condition are impossible It is
the custom of Dr. Schweninger to deny
all alarmist reports, first, because his
patient is still in the habit of reading the
newspapers when he is well enough and
second, because he contends that Prince
Bismarck has the same right of privacy
in such matters as an ordinary private
citizen.
From the best available sources it may
be gathered that Bismarck's condition is
one of diminishing strength and power to
fight against chronic diseases rather than
of sudden collapse or change, and that he
may live for some time unless suoden
Wf-akness of the heart sets In. The in
flammation of the vein of the leg is caus
ing Increasing trouble. Some reports Bay
that an open, painful sore in one leg pre

general weakness.
Dr. Schweninger, in a published Inter
view, denies all these alarmist reports.
He complains of the great trouble caused
to himself and the whole TMsmarck house
hold by telegraphic and other Inquiries
from all parts of the world, saving that
he wants his time for his patient and
cannot be expected to answer Inquiries,

NEW YORK. July 27.â The steamship
Ardandhu of the Tweedle line, trading
between West Indian pojts and this city,
came up the bay to-day with a heavy
list to starboard, and the cargo stored in
her lower hold on fire. The fire first made
Its appearance at 9:30 on Monday night,
when the vessel was off Fenwlcks Island,
on the coast of Maryland. The wildest
excitement followed the outbreak of the
fire, and several of the eleven steerage
passengers, all Jamaicans, endeavored to
seize the lifeboats. ThÂ« third mate, Percy
Sanders, was forced to draw his revol
ver to prevent the men from the steer
age leaving the burning steamer In the
three lifeboats, which could easily have
accommodated the other forty-five pas
sengers and members of the crew. The
steerage passenger.B were, however, forced
out of the boats by Captain Walker and
his men, nad when discipline was re
stored preparations were first made for
the saving of the women and children of
the vessel. The lifeboats were lowered.
The sea was o.uite calm and the ship"3
officers stood by the rope ladders. Thus
a panic was averted and the safety of
the fifty-six persons on board the Ar
dandhu assured.
The heat was so intense and the smoke
was so heavy that It was for a time un
safe for the passengers to remain on the
upper deck. They were all ordered for
ward and the women and children were
first put into the lifeboats, each of which
had a full supply of food and water on
board, and were supplied with compasses
and signal roci ets. It was nearly mid
night when Captain Walker considered he
had the fire under control and decided to
continue on his way to New York. The
women and children were taken back to
the steamer and the lifeboats were hoist
ed to the davits, but were not taken on
board. The officers from that time on
kept watch over the lifeboats to prevent
the eleven Jamaicans, who appeared ter
ror-stricken, from deserting the burning
ship in -them. Most of the steeragp pas
sengers, however, stowed themselves In
the small boat astern and remained there
until the Ardandhu reached the Narrows.

ENCOUNTERED GALES
IN NORTHERN WATERS
SEATTLE, July 27.â Details have been
received here of the perilous trip of eighty
gold seekers from Illinois across Bering
Sea in the river steamer Alaska Union.
The party is headed by Dr. F. C. Hage
man of Chicago. They left here May 21
for Nunivak Island in the schooner Beu
lah. At Nunivak the Alaska Union was
constructed. On July 2 she started to
cross Bering Sea loaded to the guards
with freight and passengers and towing
a barge and steam launch.
The start was hardly made before a
storm came up. At its height one of
the boiler pipes burst and flooded the
lower deck with steam and scalding water
to a depth of six Inches.
Captain Charles E. Baxter of Chicago
with a crowbar broke open a door that
had been nailed up to keep out the sea
and released the water. Por seven hours
the Union lay helpless, and then â >t un
der way Just in time to escape another
storm, which she avoided by running un
der the lee of Nelson Island. On the 4th
another start was made, but another
storm caught her while in shoal water
The pilot cast anchor and threw her nose
up to the gale. The anchors held her
while for hours she lay rocking and toss

CARGO OF GOLD
ON THE TREASURE
SHIP HUMBOLDT
Fortunate KJondikers Arrive With
Two Million Dollars in Yel
low Dust.
SEATTLE. July 27. -The steamship
Humboldt reached Seattle this after
noon with a golden cargo of nearly
$2,000,000. She is the sixteenth treasure
ship to arrive from the North this
month. Bag after bag of dust and
nuggets was brought ashore, while the
fortunate Yukoners were cheered by
several thousand spectators who
crowded the wharf.
Three lucky miners who were among
the first to arrive in the newly dis
covered Klondike region had about
$800,000 between them. J. D. Mienach
sold his rich claim on Bonanza to a
rpresentative of Drexel, Morgan & Co
for $250,000. This amount, with a few
additional thousands, he has just
brought out.
John Erickson is another wealthy
passenger. He located No. 10 on Bon
anza and has nearly $300,000 to repre
sent his clean-up for the past two
years.
Gold and drafts in the possession of
Antone F. Stander represent over
$250,000. He is the man who won and
married the vaudeville queen Violet
Raymond, with whom he is now going
to Paris to see something of life.
Humboldt Gates and his father-in
law, William Hall, of Eureka, Cal. had
two grips filled with gold in the safe
keeping of Purser Twiggs, who esti
mates their value at over $150,000.
Mrs. Williams of San Francisco has
been in Dawson two years and returns
with $10,000.
Among the other wealthy passengers
was J, D. Thaggard of this city, who
brought out about $50,000. He realized
$27,000 of this amount from the sale of
a half interest in a saloon at Dawson.
The steamships Alice and W. K. Mer
vin brought the Humboldt's 105 passen
gers down the Yukon River in seven
days. The miners rep<frt having passed
the steamers Healy and J. C. Barr.
The former was in a short distance of
Dawson, and the Barr was making pro
gress up the lower Yukon.
The 10 per cent royalty imposed by
the Canadian Government is rapidly
driving out all of the old Klondikers,
who prefer to leave their claims un
worked until next year, believing that
by that time the royalty will be lifted
It is said that mine owners who former
ly employed from twenty to twenty
five men are now working from four to
five only. Many of those who remain
North will develop the American dis
tricts, which give promise of good
yields, and where no extortion Is prac
ticed.
Most of the passengers on the Hum
boldt will go direct to San Francisco.
Among these are John Erickson, F.
Stander and many of the other wealthy
prospectors. They evidently prefer to
turn their gold over to the Mint to hav
ing it cashed at the Seattle assay office.
Stander owns an interest in claims
Nos. 4, 5 and 6 on El Dorado and 40 on
Bonanza, for which he has refused
$1,000,000. He is accredited with having
given Clarence Berry his start by tak
ing him in as a partner during the fall
of 1896. Last year Stander purchased
Berry's interest in their holdings, and
he is now one of the bonanza kings.
Edward Dion of Quebec, Canada, al
leges that claims above 42 on Bonanza
Creek do not pay for their working.
Several of the big ocean steamers
are experiencing serious difficulty at St.
Michael. Some of thorn are unable to
unload their passengers because of the
absence of lighters and having no
light-draft steamers to go up the Yu
kon. In speaking on this point Cap
tain James Bonnified of the Humboldt
said this evening:
"There is a lively time on some of
the big boats at St. Michael. The
steamer Progresso Is in a bad way. The
company that sent her north is now
insolvent. Her 160 passengers cannot
get ashore because of the lack of liarht
ers. Besides, they do not know how
they are to get up the Yukon. Their
passage is paid to Dawson. The com
pany had expected to use some of the
Moran fleet of river steamers, but they
had not yet arrived when we left. But
if they should turn up there is no
money with which to make the neces
sary payment before they can be
used.
"The National City sailed from Port
land with over 100 passengers and has
been at St. Michael three weeks. Her
river steamers were lost p.t sea, and she
has no lighters on which to get her
passengers ashore. The Brixham Is
short of supplies and when she un
loads and starts southward her crew
and passengers will live on short ra
tions. The Dlrigo galled from San
Francisco with a big crowd. The cap
tain has no way of getting them
ashore and is short of provisions.
Food cannot be purchased at St. Mi
chael and the angry passengers are
gradually eating all that is left. The
passengers may have to be brought
back, in which event the cargo will be
broached to get supplies.
"Mrs. A. M. Baber and Miss Jeffer
son, both of Chicago, who went north
on the Progresso, returned on the
Humboldt. They say that the passen
gers fear they will be returned to
Seattle. A number of libel suits have
been prepared against the Progresso
by the passengers."
Captain Bonnifleld says that the
Moran fleet was supposed to have pass
ed through False Pass on July 1? and to
be making their way through Bering
Sea. The Western Star was wrepked
and one other was left behind for re
pairs, leaving but ten in the fleet, if
they arrive safely at St. Michael.
"SWIFTWATER BILL"
RIVALED BY "FRENCHY"
JUNEAU. Alaska, July 23 (by Steam
ship City of Topeka to Port Townsend,
July 27).â Sunrise City, on Turnapain
Arm, Cooks Inlet, the principal town
of that mining region, has another
such character as "Swiftwater Bill"
of Klondike fame, though the Cooks
Inlet plunger is known by only one
name. He is becoming as famous,
though not quite so rich, either in
name or gold dust. He is known as
"Frenchy." This incipient Croesus has
a placer mine in a gulch up Six Mile
Creek, into which all the paying creeks
in that section empty. Sunrise City
stands at the mouth of Six Mile. Its
present population is about 2000 per

sons, and It possesses all the attrac
tions of the frontier mining camps.
"Frenchy" plays faro like a fiend,
paints the town red periodically, and
is what is known in the States as a
"goou thing" for the gamblers and sa
loo-ns. He never stops blowing himself
as long as there is an ounce of dust
left in his sack, for the very good rea
son that he knows there is plenty more
where that came from.
"Frenchy" is something of a mys
tery. He parries all attempts to learn
his right name, saying that "Frenchy"
Is good enough for him. He has excel
lent manners, particularly when
drunk, and shows unmistakable marks
of having seen, if not better days fin
ancially, better days socially. Some of
the miners call him "The Count." One
pf the last party down from Cooks In
let says that "Frenchy" plays one
card at a time, the six being his favor
ite, with the queen next. This habit
gives the dealer a much better chance
with the cards, which accounts for the
fact that the mineowner almost invari
ably loses.
,, lAfter1 After being in town a few days
Frenchy" suddenly disappears, but
everybody has learned that he has
gone back to his "diggings" for more
gold. Invariably he reappears in about
a week with the buckskin receptacle
full to the neck with coarse gold. Ha
says he is going down to the States
by the last steamer next fall. He has
spent about $15,000 in dust up to date
this summer.
E. C. Sherman, who lives on Adeline
street, Oakland, is one of the latest ar
rivals from Cooks Inlet, whither he
went in the interest of hydraulic min
ing on a large scale.
"One serious drawback of the Cooks
Inlet country," he said, "is the disre
gard of mining laws. Men who have
been in the country several years have
located a great many claims. They do
no development work on them as re
quired by law, and at the end. of the
year simply refile on them. This keeps
out men who might put in money and
work the ground. There is much
ground in the district that can be
worked with profit by hydraulics. The
season has not been a successful one
for the miners. This is not on account
of there being no gold, but because of
the unusually high water which has
carried away dams and sluice boxes, so
that no work could be done. There
are a number of good claims, and as
there are not less than 2000 men out
prospecting, more good ground in all
probability will be found. But there
are already too many men there for
that immediate district, and it remains
to be seen whether the country in that
vicinity is gold bearing. The high water
has greatly interfered with prospect
ing and altogether the season so far
has not been a satisfactory one.
"Sunrise City THll be lively r c-jrj;. win
ter. Several fairly good stores and
quite a number of saloons are doing
business.
"Frank Wheeler is perhaps the lead
ing merchant of Sunrise. He had a
mortgage on a claim owned by a man
named Powers, who had not done much
work on it. Three days before the
little steamer Perry left Sunrise to
take passengers down to Homer to
catch the mail steamer. Wheeler fore
closed on the mortgage. He put sev
eral men at work at once, and When
we left they were taking out $70 a day
to the man.
"Powers was badly broken up over his
loss and Wheeler's good fortune. He
lost his head on the Perry and began
to shoot. I was standing just in front
of him and one bullet whistled by my
ear. They put him into the hold, and
he was still there when the mall
steamer left.

STRONG BOX
School Trustee Lets
Contracts to Himself
Under an Alias.
Expose of Shameless Pilfering
tiy Which "Jim" Rea's Un
derlings Profit.
SAN JOSE. July 27.â The affairs of
the City Board of Education should be
given 'a thorough Investigation. Pur-
Ing the past month irregularities have
been discovered In bills allowed by the
Trustees. The public should insist upon
an open investigation and the Grand
Jury's attention ought to be called to
these acts.
Two of thÂ» Trustees, M. J. Graham
from the Fourth Ward, and E. H.
Wemple from the Second ward, have
been drawing money from the school
department contrary to law. Trustee
Kenyon and ex-Trustee O'Brien knew
of it ;md consented. Trustees O'Nell
and Lang-ford had no hand in the pecu
lation, as they have been members of
.trd only about a month.
The principal culprit in this loot of
the city is Trustee Graham. Since Sep
tember 15, IS:<7, Graham has been re
ceiving $15 a month from the city for
the rent of a building for kindergarten
purposes in Cottage Grove. The bill is
made out in the name of J. N. White,
but each month Graham receives the
warrant and draws the money. No
man named J. N. White is known in
San Jose, and, further, no such indi
vidual has any interest in the buiid
in<? or the gTound on which the school
stands. The Assessor's roll shows that
the lot on which the Cottage Grove kin
dergarten is situated belongÃ to Mary
A. McDonald, a sister-in-law of Gra
ham. In the report given to the Asses
sor there is no record of any Improve
ments on the lot.
The story of the school shows the
crookedness of Trustee Graham and
certain members of the last Hoard of
Education. Previous to September 15
the Cottage Grove kindergarten was
hr.'j in the L'r.Jon Sunday school build
hieh the city paid a rental
of $12 50 a month. The people of Cot
taee Grove were satisfied with the lo
cation of the school. Graham and Miss
McDonald connived together and de
cided to erect a small cottage on the
latter's lot and rent it to the city for a
kindergarten. This action was not
taken, however, until Graham was sure
his associates would consent to the re
moval of the school. Then a cottage at
a cost of a little over $700 was erected.
The plans were such that It could eas
ily be turned into a dwelling 1 If Rome
future hoard should upset the project.
The Committee on School Houses.
Sites and Repairsâ Kenyon, O'Brien
and Graham â decided to move the
6chool to Graham's building-, notwith
standing residents of Cottage Grove
Strongly protested against it. Not sat
isfied with inconveniencing the major
ity of the people of Cottage Grove, the
board allowed $2 50 a month more rent
(sls a month) than was paid for the
old .building.- This sum Graham has
drawn, with knowledge of other mem
bers of the old board, under the name
of J. N. White for nine and one-half
months. The Finance Committee
which audited the bill each month was
composed of Graham, Kenyon and
O'Brien. Thus it will be seen Graham
has be^n voting to allow this illegal
claim to hims-'lf. Th* matter is one
that should be laid before the Grand
Jury, and Graham should be ousted
from office and punished.
The City Charter strictly prohibits
any official of the city being parties to
contracts with the city.
Under the head of "Miscellaneous
Provisions," article 13, section 10, the
Charter says:
No member of the Common Council or
of any bnard, and no officer or employe
of said city while In oftice shall be or
become, directly or Indirectly. Interested
In any contract, work or business or In
the sale of any article, the expense,
price nr < consideration of which Is payable
from the treasury, nor shall either or any
of th<--m receive any gratuity or advan
t.-:pp from any contractor or person fur
nishing labor or material for the same.
The Ptate school law Is even clearer.
Article 21, KPctiun 1576, says:
No School Trustee or Bonrd of Educa
tion must be Interested in riny contract
m.'t'W- by the board of which he is a mem
her. ii'il any contract made in violation
of this provision is void.
Kfrnion 1870 of the same article pre
ea that "any officer so acting or
â¢ inp must be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and on conviction be
punished by fine or Imprisonment and
be removed from office."

DECISION OF A FRESNO JUDGE
LARGE WEST SIDE HOLDINGS
INVOLVED.
Railroad Company Fails to Oust
Ranchers From Lands for Which
They Had Received
Patents.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, July 27.â Judge Rlsley ren
dered an important decision 10-day in a
number of railroad suits. The suits were
instituted by the Southern Pacillc Com
pany against Isaac T. Bell and a large
number of others who had settled on
land on the west side and who were is
sued patents by the Government. Just
before the live years during which they
would have had peaceable and undis
puted possession would have expired the
railroad company began actions to con
test their right to the land and to eject
them therefrom if possible.
The suits came up before Judge Rls
ley to-day on demurrers interposed by
the defendants and the court sustained
the demurrers. This practically is a vic
tory for the defendants, as the points
raised by the demurrers went squarely
to the merits of the suits.
The history of the cases is an Interest
ing one. In 1866 the Government deeded
to the railroad companies every odd
quarter-section of land alo&g the route of
the road, extending a distance of twenty
miles on either side. The condition to the
grant was that the railroad company
Should have every other section which
Wits not occupied at the thne.
Some of the land which would fall to
the railroad company had been settled,
and what was known as an indemnity
grunt whs afterward made, giving the
company an additional strip of land ten
miles wide, In which the company might
select land to make up for the occupied
sections in the previous grant.
Subsequently, however, the Indemnity
grant was rescinded. After the indem
nity grant in this particular case was
withdrawn by the Government the defen
dants In the present litigation settled
upon It, complied with all the provisions
of the law appertaining to lillng upon
land, and patents were Issued to them by
the United States Government. The rail
road company now sues under the lndem
i.ity, claiming that the cancellation of the
indemnity grant was unconstitutional.

generally favors the retention of the
islands by the United States. There
would be no objection to their transfer
to Great Britain. Japan's Interests, how
ever, forbids their passing into the hands
of Germany or of any othor Continental
power. In any event, the Japanese press
regards the scheme of an insurgent re

practicable.

AGNEWS INQUIRY
CAUSES HALE AND
GOULD TO SQUIRM
Unpleasant F^evelatior>s Made to
the State Commission in
LuQacy.
SAN JOSE, July 27.â Neither Czar
Gould nor Director Hale are happy
over what was developed before the
State Commission In Lunacy yesterday.
In some mysterious way the dictator
of the Agnews State Hospital learned
that Director White had told the com
mission some unpleasant truths about
how Gould managed, by broken prom
ises, unholy alliances with persons of
antagonistic political faith and treach
ery to his own party, to obtain more
than his proportion of the patronage
of the Institution.
Director Hale is uncomfortable over
the knowledge that Director Upham
stated before the oommission that the
asylum was run by a "ring" and that
Hale was a member of it. Hale does
not like the appellation "ringster."
Neither does he take kindly to the
Governor's well-intended and ' jocular
remarks made before an amused audi
ence at the asylum yesterday. Said the
Governor:
"Your turn will come soon, old
smoothy. We will have you in and we
will try to take some of that smooth
ness out of you. Say, I will wager that
if Hale were to run for Governor and
he were given nix months' time, ho
would have the vote of every man in
the State."
It was learned to-day that within the
past few weeks Gould obtained â or,
rather, ordered â the appointment of
two additional employes at the asylum,
thus bearing out the claim that he has
been persistently engaged in filling the
institution with his proteges. The ap
pointees are Harry Conner of San Jose
and Mr. Biggy of San Francisco, a son
of Senator Biggy.
It is likely that the investigation of
the charges against T. T. Tourtillot and
Mrs. Madisran will be concluded to
morrow without the examination of ad

Credulous.
Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 27.â The public exami
nation in the bankruptcy court f to-day
into the affairs of Ernest Terrah Hooley,
the company promoter, for whose prop
erty, on his own application, a receiver
was appointed on July 23, attracted a big
crowd. The debtor attributed his failure
chiefly to his partner, a man named
Rucker, he crippling the business by
drawing out Â£600,000 within two months.
In detailing the flotation of the Dunlop
Tire Company, Mr. Hooley said the names
on the directorate cost between Â£80,000
and Â£100,000, Including those of L*>rd Al
bemarle, Â£12,000, and Eari Delawarr,
Â£2C,000.
In connection with the flotation, Mr.
Hooley also said he lost Â£62,000 on "press
calls," these being shares Intended for
people connected with newspapers, whose
names have not been divulged, though it
is expected they will be made public
later.
In the course of his testimony Mr. Hoo
ley detailed the payments he made to tho
newspapers, including, as alleged, the
Pall Mall Gazette, the Financial Post and
a number of smaller papers, When Mr.
Hooley was questioned about Â£10,000
paid to Harry Marks, editor of the Fi
nancial News, he denied that it was con
nected with the insertion of "puffs" in
the paper named.
As a matter of fact, the supposed profit
of the flotation of the Dunlop Tire Com
pany, amounting to Â£1.700,000, had been
"sweated" away to under Â£200,000.
Mr. Hooley further asserted that he
paid many thousands of pounds for intro
ductions to Lords Ashburton, Warwick.
Norbury and others, and he testified that
the Earl of Winchelsea received $10,000
for acting as chairman of one of the bi
cycle tube manufacturing concerns.

that Williams would have to look afu.-r
the attendance of any witnesses he

What Gould cannot get by direct
means he manages to get by indirect
ones. One of the plums of the institu
tion is the position of matron. Gould
has had, according to general report
and by the admission of some of the
members of the board, Miss I^ouise
Bambauer, his Merced importation,
slated for this position. She stands
fourth on the list of those w-ho took the
civil service examination for the posi
tion of matron, but that is apparently
an insignificant fact with Gould. No
appointment has yet been made to fill
the vacancy created by the forced
resignation of Miss Royse, but Miss
Bambauer has been appointed to the
place temporarily under the Instruc
tions of Gould.
It was not generally known until to
day that this temporary appointment
carries with it not only the honors and
responsibilities of the position, but the
salary also. This is, however, a fact,
and Miss Bambauer has been draw
ing the salary of matron ever since her
appointment. Under these circum
stances it is not probable that any
haste will bdfmade to have the board
make a regflar appointment to the
position, and thus the issue of the civil
service examinaiton will be evaded.
To-morrow will probably see the cc-n
clusion of the examination of members
of the Agrnews board of managers be
fore the State Commission in Lunacy.
The testimony given by them before the
commission will then be made public,
according to the statement of Governor
Budd. It is believed that the records
will contain much of an interesting, if
not a sensational, nature.
The testimony is creating even more of
a flutter in the west end of London than
in the city proper. The revelations con
cerning such men as Earl Delawarr
and the Earl of Albemarln have
been received with astonishment. Nu
merous Instances were disclosed by Mr
Hooley in which a peer bearing a proud
title would charge the promoter a sum
ranging from Â£500 to Â£2000 for an intro
duction to another peer. Thus, Mr. Hoo
â¢l&w. said. Earl Delawarr received
*ÂÂ»oo for an introduction to Lord Gre

WASHINGTON. July 27.â The reports
of Colonel Suter, Major Heuer and Major
Lewis on improvements of rivers and
harbors in California have been received
by the War Department. Surveys of the
Sacramento and Feather rivers have been
completed, but owing to the fact that the
engineers and draftsmen engaged In the

only to consider matters submitted by the

lieved by the board that the unexpended
balance of $50,481, together with the $280,

estimate the amount for completing work
on Oakland harbor at $521,000, and the
amount to be used between now and 1900
$130,000. For the Napa and MoKelumno

"Several years ago I was troubled with an aggravated case of
dyspepsia and, of course, the first thing I did was to consult a physi-
cian. As I had always enjoyed the best of health I was worried a good
deal over this, my first illness, and my only desire was to get well as
speedily as I could. I took regularly all the medicines as my doctor
prescribed them. In a short time I felt all right, thought I was cured
and stopped taking the medicine. But it wasn't long before I was feel-
ing as badly as ever, and again I had recourse to the doctor. This
kept up for some time until at last I made up my mind I would quit
doctoring and try some of the remedies I saw advertised. 1 had read
so much of Ripans Tabules that I concluded I would give them
a good trial. It said ' one would give relief,' and I thought if one
could give relief a whole lot might cure me. I purchased a dollar's
worth, and when I had finished them I was feeling better than I had
for years. I continued to use them, and to-day I believe I am a per-
fectly well man. Once in a great while Ido have a slight touch of
the old malady, but a single Tabule fixes it all right i generally
keep a supply at home."

STORM CENTER OF MAGUIREiSM.
A CAREFUL analysis of Democratic events
and their causes thus far in the campaign in
dicate that the storm center of Maguireism in
this State is located somewhere in the vicinity of
Tulare. The Maguire idea originated in resolutions
passed by the County Committee of that county.
Thereupon Chairman Alton! of the State Committee,
who hails from Tulare, came north and appointed a
committee of nine to settle factional difficulties in this
city This committee surmounted all obstacles by ap
pointing a committee of one hundred and investing it
with full power to act.
Thus it will be perceived that Maguireism took its
root in Tulare, whence it has rapidly spread
throughout the State. Although Mr. Alford sought
to cover the tendrils with soil by passing through the
State Committee a declaration that the committees j
of nine and one hundred had been created only in the !
people's interest, they have since appeared upon the
tee. The latter committee has adopted a resolu- I
tion pledging its faith to Maguire, and a sub
committee has decided to appoint 154 delegates from
city in the interest of the Congressman's am-
The ITulare County tail may thus be said to be wag
.ging the Democratic California dog. Party inspira
tion having been obtained from that region, of course
it was eminently proper that political action should
start in the same quarter. But it may with consider
able propriety be asked, What interest has Tulare
County in the gubernatorial aspirations of Judge
Maguire? The county is agricultural in character.
Do the farmers of Tulare desire the adoption of the
single tax theory? It ought not to be necessary to
remind them that that theory contemplates placing all
the burdens of maintaining the Government on land.
Judge Maguire's idea is to destroy the fee-simple and
compel landowners to hold their estates subject to the
demands of the tax eaters.
â¢ I >r, perhaps the farmers of Tulare desire to pro
m< te the ancient feud of the Democracy with the
Southern Pacific Company. But if they do why are
they furthering Maguire's gubernatorial aspirations?
Huntington's funding scheme will not come before
the California Legislature. If their purpose is to
thwart the multifarious schemes of the railroad mag
nate, the farmers of Tulare. instead of putting up a
job to appoint a convention for the nomination of
Judge Magnire as Governor, should petition that gen
tleman to continue in Congress.
On the whole we see no reason why Tulare County
should be the storm center of Maguireism. Yet the
facts of the Democratic situation indicate that it is.
There are many saloons in this town at which a
copy of the Bulletin is given to each buyer of a drink.
Leaving aside the fact that this is a pretty mean trick
to play on a man who may be under the influence of
liquor, there is a natural curiosity to know whether
the twilight journalists count these gift enterprise
copies when they are making up a list of circulation
to which to swear.
Birdie Sanders of Idaho, a teacher, was attacked by
three men and, drawing a pistol, sent two to the
morgue and the other to the hospital. That young
woman ought to be able to teach the young idea how
. to shoot all right.
Since the man who shot Soapy Smith has followed
him. owing to wounds inflicted by the dying gambler,
it can only be hoped that Soapy has been so thor
oughly reformed that there will be no renewal of the
.trouble between them.
Confidence in General Sh.ilter is so well established
that when he calls the Governor of Santiago a pre
suming rascal there will be no doubt but that is ex
actly what the Governor is.
Possibly young Leiter had $5,000,000 worth of fun
out of his little wheat experiment, but his father had
the bill to pay. and it is not easy to see where the old
man's fun came in.
Cubans are pleading for self-government, but the
best way for them to get it is to prove that there is
something to them besides appetite.
According to Sagasta Spaniards "die but never
surrender." For the first word read "lie" and a flood
of light is thrown on the situation.
Rumors are heard that Cervera intends to go to
Boston to live. Perhaps he feels boun>- to do pen
ance for having lost his fleet.
Captain Sampson of the navy has met no Delilah
" with shears, but a number of people seem to be after
him with knives.
â  .â¢ Correspondents who are trying to stir up trouble in
Cuba ought to be given space in a cemetery at regular
rates.
With California boys at the front, this State regards
Manila as good as a fallen city right now.
GOULD (\S (\ KfILSOMINE ARTIST.
AS a whitewash expert there is probably none
rising superior to Frank H. Gould. He
realizes the necessity of a coating to hide the
real character of himself and his associates, and with
lavish hands he daubs it on. To knock off a few
flakes of the deceptive exterior becomes a duty, and
if some skin peel with it the fault is Gould's.
The Agnews investigation has gone far enough to
demonstrate the purpose dishonest, the method far
cical, and the result, all arranged in advance, to be
the inevitable glossing over of faults so grave that
they have made the asylum reek with scandal. At
taches are afraid to speak. Outsiders are not per
mitted to tell what they know. The fear of Gould has
closed the mouths of subordinates, and the creatures
of Gould aid him in keeping silent those who would
be glad to speak. The way in which the investiga
tion is being hampered is in itself a plea of guilty.
Were the institution run honestly and properly, the
personnel respectable, everybody concerned would be
eager to have the fullest light turned upon its internal
affairs. Instead of this, those against whom charges
have been brought assume the role of witnesses,
judge, jury and prosecutor. It could hardly be ex-
pected under these circumstances that the truth would
be encouraged. Gould sloshes into the whitewash
bucket, and, as far as his brush can reach, plasters
his environment with the bogus emblem of purity.
Doubtless Sponogle. a man of ill repute, and the
weakling associates of Gould will emerge from the
ordeal snowy as alabaster images, walking monu
ments of virtue.
Gould has a faculty for holding office. He is the
gentleman who recently made report to Governor
Budd on the condition of building and loan associa
tions, and afterward made a second report for publi
cation, conflicting with the first, explaining that the
first came from him as an official, and the second as
an individual. Here is a delicate distinction. Either
the official or the individual did something which
either the official or the individual had no right to do.
Just where the two entities merge is known only to
Gould, and while he is in the whitewash line he would
better give each of them a dab.
It was Gould who while Speaker of the Assembly
in 1893 presented a bill for services at $18 per day,
which an honest Controller did not let him get. A
member of the Assembly is allowed $8 a day and the
Speaker $10. According to Gould's figures he was
entitled to both salaries, and he had the nerve to
press the claim even after it had once been thrown
out. His course is now easy to understand. That
was only another instance of his dual existence. If he
can be an officer and an individual, neither entity
having anything in common with the other, surely
he could be an Assemblyman and a Speaker, two dis
tinct personalities, but with one pocket. However,
the record does not look well, and a coating of white
wash is needed there, too, if any be left when the
Agnews comedy is over. Imagine such other Speakers
as Frank L. Coombs or Morris M. Estee trying so
knavish a trick.
In the news columns the shameful tale of Agnews
has been told. The conditions prevailing there are
a reproach to the State. There is no disposition oji
the part of Gould to clean out the place; it would
be hara-kiri. A cleaning would oust his brother and
other friends, bounce Sponogle and Hale and leave
Gould himself standing pensively outside the walls
and marveling what had struck him. Governor
Budd has devoted much time to State institutions,
particularly those having to do with the care of the
poor and afflicted. He owes it to himself now to
devote special attention to Agnews. If he desires to
go from office with honor he will have to see that
Gould and the Gould gang go first.
SfIMPSON'S REPORT.
SAMPSON'S report of the destruction of the
Spanish fleet off Santiago was well worth all
the space it occupied in the news of the day,
and all the time given by the public in reading it.
While it added nothing to what was already known of
the conflict, it possessed the peculiar eloquence that
ever lies in the words of those who "speak with
authority." It was official, and in the sedate language
of a formal document confirmed every essential detail
given by more picturesque and glowing writers of
the great victory.
Some regret will be felt that the rear admiral did
not in his report give special mention and honor to
Commodore Schley, who was in actual command of
the squadron during the battle. This would have been
the more graceful on his part because in reporting to
the admiral the commodore had said: "I congratulate
you most sincerely upon this great victory of the
squadron under your command." The opportunity
thus afforded for an interchange of congratulations
was so good that a mistake was made when the ad
miral allowed it to pass without profiting by it.
Californians will note with proud satisfaction that
our home-built battleship, the Oregon, receives from
the admiral higher praise than that accorded to any
other ship in the fleet. In narrating the events of the
fight as they occurred, the report says: "The Brook
lyn and the Texas had at the start the advantage of
position, and the Brooklyn maintained this lead until
the Oregon, steaming with amazing speed from the
commencement of the action, took first place."
Later on, in summing up the performances of the
various vessels and awarding due praise to each, the
admiral says: "The fine speed of the Oregon enabled
her to take a front position in the chase, and the
Cristobal Colon did not give up until the Oregon had
thrown a thirteen-inch shell beyond her. This per
formance adds to the already brilliant record of this
fine battleship and speaks highly of the skill and care
with which her admirable efficiency has been main
tained during a service unprecedented in the history
of vessels of her class."
There was nothing invidious in this praise given to
the ship that so fitly represents the ship-building
work of the Pacific Coast. That it was merited and
deserved has been attested by all who watched the
fight intelligently. In fact every report that has been
made of the battle has given special honor to the
Oregon, and the official report of the admiral has
done no more than confirm the glorious records of
her performances in the action that have been al
ready published.
The admiral's report was' accompanied by the re
ports made to him by the various commanding offi
cers of the fleet. All of these are documents which
our people can read with a justly founded pride. It
is notable that the commanders without exception
speak in highest praise of their seamen and give to
these unnamed heroes full credit for their share of the
great victory. Captain E%'ans (Fighting Bob) sums
up their conduct in a characteristic phrase: "So long
as the enemy showed his flag they (the crew) fought
like American seamen, but when the flag came down
they were as gentle and as tender as American
women." Courage in action and generosity in vic
tory could go no further, nor the highest chivalry be
better exemplified.
Why did the Post announce that the ex-Queen h
a victim of cancer? There are so many truths to tell
that fiction seems superfluous.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, THURSDAY, JULY 28, 1898.
THE NEED OF FOREST PROTECTION.
THE Brooklyn Eagle refers in somewhat severe
terms to the destruction of Western forests, even
in the Federal reservations, as a result of with
drawing troops to serve in a foreign war. We are
glad that the interest of the whole country in the
forests of a part of it is receiving attention, even
though the treatment of it may be partial and incom
plete.
The forests of a country are perhaps its most im
portant and valuable physical feature. They bear a
relation to the precipitation and distribution of that
moisture upon which the fertility of the soil de
pends, for which, in the regions which they dominate,
there is no possible substitute. Their destruction is an
artificial interference with the ways of nature, which
is sure of punishment, in a dehydrated soil and a loss
of fertility.
This statement of the relation of forests to fertility
has been contradicted by some superficial observers,
who cite the prairie States of the Upper Mississippi
Valley as an example of the non-concurrence of for
ests with moisture and fertility.
The contradiction is only apparent and is not real.
Those prairie regions differ in their physical features
from the region of high plateaus, mountains and val
leys west of the hundredth meridian.
In the prairie country nature provided a substitute
for the forests as an agent in the collection and dis
tribution of moisture. The prairie States have but
few altitudes greater than 600 feet. In their primitive
\ condition they were threaded by sloughs, drainage
j channels with but little fall, where the shed waters
j moved but slowly, and evaporation during most of the
year was not rapid. Here accumulated a vegetable
mold many feet in depth from the roots and the de
cay of the hummock grasses, which held water like
a sponge. These sloughs were reinforced by swamps,
marshes, ponds and small lake?, all serving as catch
ment basins for the rainfall, and most of them de
i fended against evaporation by the overgrowing
; grasses.
The moisture for the whole region evaporates from
the surface of the great lakes, from Superior to Erie.
Falling upon the prairie watersheds, this moisture
found its way to the natural catchment basins and
! supplied local evaporation, in the hot summer, for the
I seasonable thunderstorms by which it was distributed
to moisten the crust of the earth, refresh growing
crops and find its way to storage in the clay subsoil
to be drawn up by capillary attraction, and to give life
to the deep roots of trees. Within a quarter of a cen
tury grew up a rage for draining these sloughs,
swamps, marshes, ponds and lakes. Congress un
wisely passed "swamp land" laws, which permitted
the cheap alienation to private ownership of these
; natural catchment basins. They are now plowed
', fields, underlaid with drain tile. The spongy character
â  of the soil, so well calculated for retaining water, has
i been destroyed by cultivation. The usual percentage
of moisture, derived directly from the great lakes,
! falls every year, but finch no resting-place. It is
drained quickly through the former catchment basins,
goes speedily into the watercourses which have be
] come torrential, and passes down them destructively,
: deepening their narrowing channels, and is lost to
i its former useful purpose of supplying the summer
j showers and being by them distributed for moistening
! the crust of the earth. The melancholy results are
| beginning to appear. Along the watercourses, and for
! a considerable distance on each side, there were for
merly fine bodies of timber. On the river benches, or
intervales, this timber consisted of willow, cotton
wood, linn, sycamore and soft maple. Next there
were fine growths of white and black walnut,
white and black ash, hackberry and hickory.
Then on the clay hills were found white, black, red,
burr and pin oak, shagbark hickory and hard maple,
among which lumbermen recognized the most valu
able hardwoods on the continent.
These riparian forests have been too indiscrim
inately cut away and wantonly destroyed. But what
fire and ax spared is being rapidly swept away by
drainage of the sloughs and natural storage reser
voirs. The failure in distribution of moisture from
them has dried the crust of the earth so that all trees
of the hickory family, the genus Carya, are dying.
They are tap root trees, and, the earth having dried
out below their roots, they get no moisture and dis
appear. So far the trees which spread their roots
near the surface manage to live on the small quantity
of moisture supplied by direct precipitation, but their
doom will come soon or late.
In that prairie region, then, we see that drainage
j of natural reservoirs is in all respects equivalent to
I the deforestation of a timbered region, and that it car
! ries with it a gradual destruction of the tree-producing
capacity of the soil, which naturally bore timber, just
as in the timbered region successive fires destroy that
capacity.
This whole subject of nature's way of lifting mois
ture by evaporation from the bosom of the lakes and
seas, carrying it inland on the winds in certain sea
sons when their direction was favorable and there
storing it, either in soil sheltered by forests or in
; sloughs, swamps and marshes, either to be distributed
! by percolation into streams from which it might be
artificially diverted for irrigation, or by the same
means lifted up for distribution by the varying winds
of summer when the great currents from their orig
inal source have ceased, is of fascinating interest to
] the student of physical economics. It requires to be
! studied and that the conclusions reached be practically
: applied, or our fertile regions will one day be as blear
as the sands that drift over the ruins of Persepolis,
where â
Commander Wainwright is not a handsome man.
This fact is a pleasing relief. There is a photographic
fad for making all naval officers almost too pretty to
do anything but sit before a camera in their best
clothes.
The gentlemen who sent from Washington mis
information that the various States were not re
sponding to the second call for soldiers should now
be sending a series of apologies to the various States.
Perhaps it will comfort little King Alphonse, now
wrestling with a dose of measles, to learn that several
gentlemen at our own Camp Merritt have had a sim
ilar experience.
There will be no surprise at additional evidence
that the Oregon is the best battle-ship in the navy.
It was built with the idea of being something of the
kind.
*
If people who are certain there will be a great
opening at Manila would only go there and fall into
it, one of the horrors of war would be mitigated.
California has, turned out the best battleship in the
navy, but believes that a better one is a possibility,
and that it ought to be named California.
It is strange that Sampson could be near any en
gagement and escape getting his bump of caution
struck.

VALMORE'S WONDERFUL VOICE.
THERE is In this city at present a
young man who is billed In large
letters "The Human Brass Band."
The gift he has is unique, its cul-
tivation wholly self-taught. There
are others able to Imitate one or two in
struments, but this young man imitates
them all. With equal facility he is the
bassoon, making the air tremulous with
the depth of notes which seems below any
possible range of the voice, and the next
instant he gives the quivering melody of
the violin, rising higher and higher, true
as if drawn by a bow in the hands of a
master.
Valmore is the most unassuming of
mortals. He is rather under the average
size, a decided blonde, with a suggestion
of strawberry tint. In conversation hl3
voice is light and delicate. There is noth
ing about its apparent quality to indi
cate its wondrous range and power. Val
more cannot explain the source of his
strange faculty. He simply knows that
he has it, and is making the most of it.
He is one of a family of sixteen, and
neither his brothers nor sister share with
him in any measure the tendency to be
a brass band. While yet a boy he real
ized that he could reproduce sounds, and
in his school days often did so for the
amusement of his playmates, who would
erect a tent, charging a pin for admission,
and under the tent Valmore would be the
entire show. As he grew older the de
sire to imitate various instruments as well
Sawing Wood Comes Easy.
as vocal peculiarities grew stronger, and
he practiced it, with no thought of going
on the stage until five years ago. At
that time he became a professional, and
his success has bees mark.-. 1. He is now
under engagement for a three years' tour
abroad.
As interesting as Valinore Is on the
stage he Is seen and heard to best ad
vantage among his friends. To them he
gives some exhibitions in which he does
not yet regard himself as sufficiently per
fected to try on the public. As In rapid
succession he accomplishes feats of vo
cal gymnastics which excite marvel, he
explains how' he has tried and. retried
certain acts or how the idea came to him.
He has that absolute lack of self-con
sciousness which is the truest modesty,
and achievements which cause astonish
ment to the witnesses appear to him to
be a matter of course. "Oh, I'll do better
than that," he says, "after a little more
practice."
On a recent overling after the regular
performance Valmore met a few ac
quaintances, and that he afforded them a
delightful hour any of them will attest.
He did not confine, himself to musical
subjects, for the first imitation was that
of the phonograph. There was the pre-

his country after having performed mili

try at any time after having acquired

PHILIPPINE ISLANDSâ F. H., San
Jose, Cal. "When the Americans take
charge of the Philippines some intelligent
man will make a survey of the islands
and tell Uncle Sam how many there
are In his new possession. At this time
it is impossible to state positively how
the real thing, so complete was the Illu

and reaching: the climax which may he
obtained by kicking a porker in the short
ribs. Several gentlemen who in earlier
days had been farmers were observed to
look under their chairs. They thought
somebody had smuggled a pig into the
apartment.
All this, however, was merely strange.
It did not rlae to the dignity of being ar
tistic. Hut when Valmore essayed the
reproduction of music his success was
none the less marked, and it was thor
oughly artistic. He gave the Intermezzo
from "Cavalleria Etaatlcana," a beautiful
melody, and he gave it with the utmost
ton.- faithfulness. He seemed to be play

again there would be the two, their notes
merging in harmony. Yet the whole ef

One of the most difficult fpats of the
evening was an imitation of a vocal quar
tet. There were the four separate parts
In their proper relation, and then the
four blent into one as the supposed sing
ers joined in a swelling chorus. In this
effort the power and volume of Yalmore's
voice was demonstrated notably. He
seemed- to sing with the force of four
strong singers, and at no point did he do
violence to the laws of harmony.
Nevertheless he does not claim to be a
singer, and asserts that his sole accom
plishment in this direction is in repro
ducing what somebody else has done.
They set a pattern; he does the rest. He
takes pride in doing it well. No subter
ranean basso can baffle him, and with
equal ease he can pursue a tenor beyond
the spires. Nothing in his natural voice
would indicate the least talent in the for
mer direction, a fact which renders the
truth all the more amazing.

FIGHTING 808 EVANSâ S. A. M.,
City. Robley D. Evans, now of the Iowa!
generally known as "Fighting Bob Bv

placed in command of the Torktown
and sent to Valparaiso. He anchored in
front of the water batteries defending
the city. The Chileans had a number of
torpeao boats with long arms, on which
torpedoes were placed. The boats were
being maneuvered in an unpleasant and
threatening manner for some time. Ev
ans watched those movements until they
became unbearable. He had the guns of
the lorktown loaded and the ship cleared
for action, after which he got into his
cutter and went to the commanding gen
eral, told him he wanted the torpedo boat
business stopped and gave him half an
hour to take them out of the harbor.
Whether right or wrong, his request was
complied with. It was there, from the
stand he took, that he gained the name
of "Fighting Bob." He it was who told
Secretary Herbert that it would please
him to make Spanish the prevailing lan

canvassed the military market and
brought to bear all the influence at hand

The Philadelphia got away for Hono
lulu at 3 p. m. yesterday. Early in the
morning Rear-Admiral Miller transferred
his flag from the Albatross to the war
ship and a salute of thirteen guns was
iired. From that on everything went â 
with a rush on the Philadelphia, and at
2:30 p. m. she was ready for a start. A
last launch was sent ashore to gather up
the last of the 4nail and any stragglers.
Half an hour later everything was ready
for a start. The anchor was up, a full
head of steam was on the boilers, and at
3:05 p. m. the cruiser was on her way to
the flag-raising which is to take place at
Honolulu. Passing the naval reserve I
steamer Marion the admiral was saluted \
with thirteen guns, and the gunners on
the Philadelphia replied. Alcatraz and
Black Point followed suit and then Fort
Point took it up, so the last thing the I
men on the cruiser heard as they passed
out through the Golden Gate was the
boom of cannon.
As soon as the American flag has been
hoisted over the Hawaiian Islands the
men on the Philadelphia are in hopes that
their vessel will be suit on to Manila. The
repairs to the gunboat Yorktown are now
almost completed, and it is thought that
as soon as she is ready she will be sent to
Honolulu to relieve the Philadelphia
and the latter will be sent to join L>ew

the Coast Seamen's Union, called upon I
Captain Robinson, U. S. A., in regard to 'â 
the matter. The captain conducted the j
negotiations for the purchase of the ves
eel on behalf of the United States, and \
Mr. Furuseth went to him because he had
control of the matter. A very heated ar- j
gument followed, and the Seamen's I
Union's secretary said, among other j
things, that it was un-Amerlean to em
ploy Chinese cheap labor when there
were plenty of good American sailors to i
be had for the asking. At this Captain j
Robinson got angry, and he is reported to
have said that he wasn't going to be bull- i
dozed by any labor union in the country, j
That he was as good an American as any 1
man in the United States and that he !
would run his own business to suit him- I
self and without outside interference.
"The Chinese crew of the Arizona was
shipped by me under orders from Wash
ington and they will remain on the ves
sei until I get orders from the same
source to discharge them," said he, as he
fro~.vm-d Mr. Furuseth out.
The seamen have not given the matter
up by any means, and a committee has
been appointed to interview Congressman
Maguire, and through him have a strong
representation of the case sent to Wash
ington. Mr. Furuseth says that no stone
will be left unturned to prevent a vessel
owned by the United States, and In use
as a transport, being manned by Chinese
labor.
Captain Walter S. Milnor, who brought '
the Arizona from Puget Sound to this i
port, left last night for Seattle and Cap- j
tain Robinson leaves to-day also for the !
same place. The latter will examine the
new transports Athenian and Tartar, and
Captain Milnor will bring one of them to
San Francisco.
The following notice to mariners has
been issued by the Lighthouse Inspector:
"The steam whistlo on Ban Francisco j
light vessel 70 wil not be in operation to- !
day: in case of fog the bell will be
sounded.
"The, steam whistle will again be In
operation, if possible, on the 20th."
The trouble lies with the engineer's de
partment. Yesterday Captain Lowell was
Informed that there was no more coal on
the lightship, so he had to secure a pass
age on one of the pilot boats and come
ashore in a hurry. A supply of black
diamonds will be put on boardto-day, and !
to-night the siren will be again in work- j
Ing order.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Mariposa arrived from Sydney, via Auck
land. Apia and Honolulu, yesterday. On
the 25th inst. the Rio de Janeiro was met.
Captain Ward reported all well
aboard the transport, and put aboard the
Mariposa a package of mail for San
Francisco. The Mariposa brought up
$1,250,000 in treasure and a large number
of passengers. One of the latter was E.
Klnath. frÂ«.m Apia. He was a member of
the Sophie Sutherland expedition, and
nearly died from malarial foyer in the
Solomon group. He says that Soronson
led them all a wild goose chase, and the
only trace of gold they found was in the
interior of an island, where it was im
possible to get at. The Sutherland is now
OUt sixteen days from Apia, and the only
ones left aboard of all who sailed from
this port on her are Captain Alec Mc-
Lean and a man named Higgins.
The Mariposa brings the nows that the
I British cruiser Mohawk had raised the
j English flag over the Santa Cruz and
Duff groups of islands. These were the
only unannexed Island? In the southern
seas, and thinking some one else might
claim them England seized the lot. They
lie between the Solomons and New
Hebrides, and are of more strategical
value than anything else. The Santa Cruz
group Is oompopr-d <>f seven large islands
and the Duff or Wilson group of eleven.
: The natives are cannibals, and will al
ways be remembered for the murder of
; Bishop Patteson and Commodore Good
enough.
The sister ships Alcinous and Alcidos
arrived in port yesterday. The Alcinous
took 159 days to come from Ardrossan,
Scotland, and the Alcidps 1,"4 days to
come from Antwerp. Both masters re
port an unusual number of calms and
i fight winds.
The Yukon Rlvor steamer Queen of the

CONDUCTING A BANKING GAME
The Cases of W. D. Valentine and
M. B. Burke Dismissed.
The case of W. D. Valentine and M.
R. Burke, charged with conducting a
banking game at 19 Ellis street, was
concluded before Judge Conlan yester
day, and the Judge dismissed both cases.
A similar case was brought against
Valentine recently, where he was
charged with conducting a percentage
game, and Judge Cook, on appeal, ac
quitted him. Judge Conlan, in view of
that decision and also In view of the fact
that in his opinion the evidence for the
prosecution did not show that a banking
game was carried on within the meaning
of the statute, dismissed the cases.
Frankie Payne, who operated the wires
in a room in the Parrott building, con
necting with 19 Ellis street, was subpe
naed to appear as a witness for the prose
cution, but did not make her appearance.
Mrs. Fershaw Permitted to Land.
Mrs. Vlctorina Fershaw, the Danish
â woman who arrived on the steamer Star
buck and was refused a landing because
ehe was a pauper and an Invalid, has at
last been allowed to go ashore. A bond
for $500 was given- that she will not be
come a public charge. Mrs. Willard B.
Harrington has taken her In charge and
had her removed to the Children's Hospi
tal for treatment.
HE DOES NOT
WANT A SUIT
J. J. Valentine Fears the
Stamp Act.
AN APPEAL TO MERCHANTS \
PRESIDENT OF WELLS-FARGO
TALKS QUITE FREELY.
A Strong Plea That No Action Be
Taken Here Until the Test
Cases in the East Are
Decided.
That J. J. Valentine, president of Wells,
Fargo & Co., Is very desirous of having
the local merchants drop the proposed
suit for violating the law in collecting
from Its patrons the 1-cent tax that the
corporation should pay fs apparent from
his actions during the past week. When
the local merchants appealed to the Mer
chants' Association for support in their
protest against the injustice and the lat
ter body decided to fight the corporation
in the Federal courts, Mr. Valentine made
haste to call upon the officers of the as
sociation and request that they postpone
taking such steps until similar cases
should be decided in the courts of the
East. Several interviews were held by
him with the officers of the body, and
yesterday he was given permission to ad
dress the board of directors at a special
meeting.
Mr. Valentine stated that at least a
dozen suits were now pending against the
express companies in different parts of
the United States, and, therefore, he be
lieved no benefit would possibly be gained
by having an additional suit brought in
this city. He had received dispatches j
from Chicago that the suit pending
against the express company there had i
already been submitted to the court, and
that a decision was daily expected. He
assured the board that his company
would promptly abide by the decision of
the courts and would place no obstacles i
in the way of a speedy decision.
The board decided to telegraph at once
to the Merchants' Association in New
York and Chicago to ascertain whether
the pending suits against the express
companies were being duly prosecuted,
and how soon a decision would be reached.
If the answers to these telegrams show
that the actions are being properly prose
cuted and that a decision will be reached
within thirty days, the board decided to
postpone the suit contemplated in this
city. If, however, no early decision will
be reached in the Eastern suits, the board
decided to proceed with the action here.
The necessary evidence has been secured
and will be held ready for any possible
future use.
In speaking of the position of Mr.
Valentine as president of the express
company, one of the directors said yes
terday that the corporation's officer's de
sire that no action be taken seemed to
be based more upon personal pride than
anything else. In the meeting he called
attention to the fact that the company
has always been on the best terms with
the merchants of this city, and he would
not like to have it go afcroad that there
Is any cause for complaint at this day.
If the present troubles can be bridged
over by the decisions that will be ren
dered in the test cases in the East it
will look better for the local branch of
I the company than it would to have an
other suit on its hands.
Prior to the meeting Mr. Valentine ad
dressed a long letter to Acting President
Baldwin, inclosing a clipping from a rail
road paperâ the Railway Ageâ which, of
course, takes the position that the tax
upon common carriers should be paid by
the people, and not by the corporations.
In Concluding the letter he says:
We reppect the riffht of private Judgment,
prize the good opinion of the public and de
sire the pood will of the community which,
despite the contention now perhaps disturbing
its ordinary even fl>w. we claim to deserve and
hope ever to enjoy. With utmost respect, I am,
very truly yours.
He Has No Redress.
VS. TI. Wright, a "stlllman" in the em
ploy of the Pacific Oil Company at Ala
meda, was Injured by the breaking of
the bottom of one of the vats in which
oil is refined, and he brought an action
against the company for damages, alleg
ing negligence on the part of his em
ployers In not having safe and suitable
vessels and appurtenances at their works.
In the Superior Court of Alameda County
he received judgment for damages. The
case v.as appealed to the Supreme Court,
which yesterday reversed the judgment
of the lower court, holding that a part of
ihc duties of the stlllman was to see that
things in his department were In order,
and that if he was hurt he was guilty of
contributory negilgence.
Precinct Registration Officers.
The Board of BtoCtlOS Commissioners
met yesterday and resumed the work of
selecting precinct registration officers.
When the board adjourned last evening
selections had been made in all but three
Assembly districts. The work will be re
sumed this morning, but It will not be
completed in time to have a. report ready
to present when the commission meets at
11 o'clock to transact the usual routine
business. Commissioners Broderick and
Creswfcll stated last evening that it was
likely that the names of the precinct
registration officers selected would not be
made known until Friday.

SEVENTH CALIFORNIA WILL NOT
MOVE TO THE PRESIDIO TO-DAY
ADVICES from Honolulu by the
steamer Maripoea represent
that the transport Indiana was
detained there but a few hours
to make the necessary boiler
repairs, and therefore news
may come any hour announcing the
arrival of the third expedition at Ma
nila. The monitor Monadnock sailed
from Honolulu for the Philippines
fourteen days ago, and if the speed
displayed on her run from this port to
Hawaii be maintained she may reach
Manila by August 8.
The secret ;ti:'l mysterious Influences
which have prevented the transfer of
troops from Camp Merritt to the Pre-
Bidio are again at work. Yesterday an
order was issued by Major General
Merrlam, commanding; the Department
of California., countermanding the In
structions for the Seventh California
to move to the reservation. Inquiries
Instituted by The Call disclose the fact
that the countermanding order was Is
sued at the r^qii'-'st of Colonel Berry of
the Seventh.
The Third BattaJion, First South Da
kota Volunteers, v.'iv embark on the
transport steamer St. Paul to-day. The
m^n will march from Camp Merritt at
8:20 a. m. The route of march will be
along PoFt Btreet, Van Xess and
Golden Gate avenues and Market
Btreet to the dock.
BARBER SAILS TO-MORROW
Goes to Honolulu in Advance
of the First New York Regi-
merit of Volunteers.
Colonel Thomas H. Barber of the First
New York Regiment will sail for Honolu
lu to-morruw on the Manila transport
steamer St. Paul, accompanied by Major
William C. Langfltt of the Second Regi
ment of Volunteer Engineers, First Lieu
tenant Bronson Winthrop, quartermaster
of the First New York, and First Lieu
tenant Lewis T. Griffith, assistant sur
geon of the First New York. These of
ficers have received certain Instructions
from Major General Merriam which they
will carry out Immediately upon their ar
rival at Honolulu. These instructions re
late principally to making arrangements
for the reception of the troops that are
to follow on next Monday on the trans
ports Lakme and North Fork, offered for
transport service by the Johnson-Locke
Mercantile Company. These two steam
ers wi'.l carry a battalion of the New
York rrgiment and the third battalion of
the Second Regiment of Volunteer En
gineers. They will also take 200,000 feet
of lumber for the c< -istruction of the
buildinjjs needed In the establishment of
the ni-w post at Honolulu. The number
of troops that the Lnkme and North Fork
will transport to Honolulu is estimated
at 750. The balance of the New York
regiment will be forwarded on the Charles
Nelson, about one week later.
Commissary Sergeant Andrew Wallen-
Bteln will accompany Captain P. M. Ly
d-ig, commissary of subsistence, to Hono
lulu on the St. Paul.
The Philippine expeditionary troops as
signed to the St. Paul for Manila will
embark to-day, under command of Lieu
tenant Lee Stover of the First South Da
kota. The recruits for the First Colorado
Volunteer Infantry will be in command of
Captain D. P. Howard, who has been sub
stituted for Captain Frank Carroll. The
St. Paul, however, will be in command
of Colonel Barber, the ranking officer, as
far as Honolulu.
The Scandia, after coming off the dry
dock. Will I*e sent to Angel Island for
fumigation, and will then be put in read

will carry they will take one full rai

HE WILL THRASH
THE CONDUCTOR
SO DECLARES ATTORNEY BUR
NETTE Q. HASKELL.
A Jury Acquits the Lavryer of a
Charge of Disturbing the Peace
of thÂ« People.
The case of Attorney Burnette G. Has
kell, charged by Conductor F. E. Hill of
tho Haight-street line with disturbing the
peace on his car on the Fourth of July,
was tried before a Jury in Judge I^ow's
â¢court yesterday afternoon. Attorney
Frank E. Kelly appeared for the prosecu
tion and Haskell conducted his own case.
F E. Hill, the conductor, testified that j
Haskell boarded his car with a lady. The j
car was crowded, but Haskell demand- d
a peat for the lady. She was given a !
Beat, and then Haskell demanded that she j
should get a seat on the dummy. Has- '
kfll became abusive and used very bad
language â so much so that witness ',
threatened to remove him from the car.
W. A. Bush, a passenger on the car, !
corroborated the conductor.
Mrs. R. B. Patterson, for the defense,
testified that Bhe boarded the car with
tho defendant to go home after viewing
the parade. The defendant roomed at her
house. Tho car was crowded inside, and
she was compelled to stand. The heat !
became unbearable, and the defendant I
asked the condu<aor to allow her to
stand on the reaf* platform, which was !
not crowded, but the conductor treated
her in a rudo manner.
ThÂ»- defendant also testified that the
conductor acted in a rude way to Mrs.
Patterson. After he had paid the fares
ho demanded a seat for her. and then he
and the conductor had an altercation,
during which the conductor threatened
to throw him oft tho car.
The jury retired, and, after an absence
of two minutes, returned, and the fore
man, Jeremiah Deasy, announced a ver
dict Of not guilty. The defendant warmly
â hook hands with the Jurors, and re
marked audibly. "I will lick that con
ductor the first chance I get."
MARKET STREET PAVEMENT.
The Merchants' Association Supports
the Mayor and Supervisors.
At a meeting of the Merchants' Asso
ciation yesterday a long resolution was
passed with reference to the paving of
Market street. In it the merchants recite
that one of the objects of the body is to
eecure to the city clean streets and noise
less pavements, especially on the large
â  business thoroughfares. The present con
dition of Market street is something of
fensive to the eyes and humiliating to the
citizens, parts being paved with basalt,
cobble-stones, wooden blocks, etc. The
association has worked hard to have a
bituminous pavement laid, and now that
the movement is on foot to effect this end
It deplores the fact that the street rail
road companies are determined not to
Bta.nd their share of the expense by re
moving the old one-horse car tracks" and
making the whole of the roadway uni
form in the matter of the pavement. In
concluwion, the resolution states that:
Whereas, The Board of Supervisors has
declared by resolution that_ the portion of
eald street now occupied by tracks upon
which horse cars occasionally run 4s il
legally held by said Market-street Rail
way Company and has ordered the Su
perintendent of Streets to remove such

AN UNEXPLODED SHELL.
A Souvenir From a Spanish
Cruiser Captured by Ad
miral Dewey.
G. W. Samuel, of 330% Fourth street,
has in his possession a relic of the pres
ent war, which, to use his own words,
"money can not buy." It is nothing more
or less than a two and a half-inch shell,
that was taken from tho Spanish auxil
iary cruiser, Callao, when that vessel waa
captured in Manila Bay by Admiral Dew
ey. The shell has boen weighed by Mr.
Samuel, and its weight is over eight
pounds. The base or cap of the shell
is of a brass and copper alloy, and It is
in this that the powder for its discharge
is loaded. The head of the shell Is fil!-d
with smaller iron balls that scatter when
the shell explodes. The explosion is by
concussion. This kind of missile, which is
one of the most deadly known, is very
effective at short range. This most In
teresting relic of the war was made a
present to Mr. Samuel by Mr. Bafandio,
the freight clerk of the steamer Aztec,
which has just returned from Hongkong.
The shell was brought over from Manila

hotelkeeper named Goodchitd, and he in
turn gave it to Mr. Bafandio, who made
a present of it to Mr. Samuels.
This shell is fired from a Maxim-Nor
denfeldt rifle. Mr. Samuel has taken
the care to have the cap of the very dan
gerous relic unloaded, but even when
showing 1 it to his friends he handles the
Spanish souvenir in a very gingerly man
ner, and declares that he had rather be
behind one of its kind than in front.

PASSING OF ARTHUR M. JELLISON.
Fop Years Librarian of the Mechanics' Institute,
Arthur M. Jelllson, for year? the librarian of the Mechanics' Institute,
is dead. Surrounded by friends and loved ones ho passed away yesterday
â  afternoon after a protracted Illness of months. The cause of death vas
â  dropsy of the heart, and although the end was known to be Inevitable, It
â¢ came suddenly and as a shock to his relatives.
Mr. Jellison's public career as librarian of the Mechanics' Institute,
â¢ which position he held for ovec-twenty-two years, has been a commend
â¢ able one. Entering the institution as a mere boy he worked his way ln
defatlgably to the position which he held up to a few weeks of his death.
One of the distinguishing traits of his character was a natural reserve
â¢ which all through his career, both public and private, he maintained.
The decedent was 44 years of age and a native of Hfline. He was a
> son of Benjamin Jellison, one of San Fr&ncisco's pioneer liquor mer

There are only about a dozen patients in
the hospital.
The big tent of the Army and Navy
Christian Commission is again within the
camp lines, to the great delight of the en
listed men. , After being deprived of its
use for a week, they can again go to It
to read and write while oft duty. The
quartermaster's depot has been moved
over to the east side of the camp, be
tween the band and the Red Cross So
ciety tents, and the vacant space utilized
for the big tent. It was thronged to
night with men, who listened to a good
strong and practical talk by D. Edwards
Collins, president of the California Bank
of Oakland.
The marked improvement of the men in
squad, company and battalion drills has
decided Colonel Henshaw to get the men
out for some extended regimental ma
neuvers. He has not as yet secured a
suitable tract of land in the vicinity of
the camp, but expects to soon, as he" has
several in view.
Adjutant D. A. Smith, who has held the
rank of captain in the Fifth Regiment,

bars removed from his shoulder straps,
much to the surprise of the enlisted mon
and others not acquainted with the rank

Contrary to the orders of Tuesday the Seventh Regiment of California

A CLASH IN HIGH RANK.
Co 1 .. Barber of New York and
Col Stover of South Dakota
Spar for Command.
Lieutenant Colonel Lee Stover, com
manding the troops for the transport St.
Paul, and Colonel Thomas H. Barber,
commanding the New York volunteers
and a great deal of Influence, had some
little difference yesterday over the juris
diction of matters on the transport. It
has since been amicably arranged.
Although Colonel Stover has been or
dered by the department to take com
mand of all the troops on shipboard, he
yesterday found upon his arrival at the
dock that Colonel Barber had in a great
measure relieved him of his duties, like
wise his stateroom. As Colonel Barber
is accompanying the expedition on de
tached service and had no orders *o
usurp the office delegated to Colonel Sto
ver his right to the stateroom and to the
command were vigorously disputed In
fact, the lieutenant colonel went so far
as to lock his stateroom against the fur
ther ingress of Colonel Barber, and for a
time things looked interesting.
The matter was finally disposed of by
referring it to the department. As a re
sult Colonel Barber will command the
St. Paul until the boat's arrival at Hono
lulu, and after that Colonel Stover will
have his chance.
WESTERN HOSPITALITY.

The Times-Union of Albany, N V of

from Private John B. Creighton of the
First New fork Regiment, now at the
Presidio, in the course of which he says:
"It was not, however, until we reached
Sacramento that we learned what West
ern hospitality is. The Red Cross ladies
were at the station In large numbers.
Every soldier received a substantial meal
of sandwiches, hard-bcile.d eggs, coffee
and fruit. Each man was presented with
a beautiful bouquet of cut flowers. But
best of all the people were there to greet
us as friends, not at all as curiosities
Their sympathy was of the tangible sort.

THE ANGLER AND THE PIKE.
How Two Noted Fishermen Were
Trapped and the Wrong Man
Accused.
F. M. Haight, a popular salesman of
Clabfough, Golcher & Co/ was agreeably
surprised on Tuesday afternoon when a
messenger from Wells, Fargo & Co. hand
ed him a package which contained a
large fish.
There were quite a few prominent ang
lers in the store at the time of the ar
rival of the supposed lordly representa
tive of Russian River and wagers were
qtiickly made as to what variety of the
fresh water denizen the package con
tained.
Some guessed black bass, others striped
bass, others steelhead, but Will Golcher
having caught a glimpse of the six-pound
monster through the sack, ventured to
say pike or "hard mouth," more com
monly called.
Golcher hit the nail on the head. When
the sack in which the llsh was neatly
bound was opened, Mr. Pike put in a
very strong appearance, much to the dis
gust of the consignee and the pleasure
of the witnesses who subsequently drank
to the health and success of Mr." Haight
and the friend who was so thoughtful as
to ship him a "prize beauty" from the
far distant fishing ground.
Haight was nonplused. He thought of
all manner of schemes regarding the
proper disposal of the pike, and finally
struck an idea.
"There is 'Honest' John Butler, who al
ways remembers me whenever he goes
bass fishing." thought Haight to himself
and here is an opportunity of returning
compliments," etc.
Quickly the name Haight was erased-
T ro u m t J5 e Wells-Fargo tag and the name
John Butler substituted. The fish was
again shipped through the express com
pajiy to Mr. Butler, who received it right
side up with care.
It is hardly necessary to state that But
ler was a target for many hard jokes
and expressions of fishy thoughts from
friends who witnessed the unpacking- of
the poor old pike.
t "* Now - Ti ha l d 0 you tnink of m >' frlend
John Gallagher, who wag kind enough
to ship me this beautiful fish free of
charge?" remarked Butler, as his eagle
eyes feasted on the unpalatable king of
the pike family. "I know what I shall
do with it. I will present it to some of
my cash customers who cannot tell the
difference between a pike and a king
salmon."
Butler then addressed a letter to Mr
Gallagher, who is angling for bass on
Russian River, thanking him for kind re
tn< mbrance and intimating that a bass
wruld be preferable to a pike. When
Gallagher received Butler'B letter he an
swered by telegraph:
"What's the matter with you, John?
Got 'em again? I haven't shipped you a
fish of any kind. GALLAGHER."

of it when v.'c had crossed its borders.
Four hours later we were at Oakland,
where we waited until 7 o'clock Thursday

"At the San Francisco pier we were met
by a fine band, the First Tennessee,
which escorted us to a large hall, beau
tifully decorated with flowers and flags.
Here the Red Cross Society gave us a
royal welcome and a much appreciated
lunch. It is no exaggeration to say that
no finer company of women were ever
seen in this or any other coutnry than
those who met us at the San Francisco
pier under the auspices of the Red Cros3
Society. The culture, refinement and
wealth of the city were there represent
ed. Besides the breakfast each man was
given a souvenir postal card and a pencil
to send a message home. Flowers were
given in such abundance that 1 ncle
Sam's soldiers looked more like high
school boys coming from their commence
ment exercises than men going to battle.
Tt was indeed, a memorable sight to see
bouquets of American Br-auy roses tucked
behind cartridge belts holding forty
rounds of ammunition and gun-barrelÂ«
blossoming with oleanders."

It was discovered yesterday by Colonel
Funston that since Young took up tho
duties of his office he has been conduct-
Ing a prosperous business on his own ac
count at the expense of the Government.
Scarcely a day has passed that he has
not sent a wagon load of stuff abstracted
from the Government stores under his
charge down town in the delivery wagon
of a prominent grocery house. It has
been his scheme to take smoking and
chewing tobacco in exchange for the
stolen goods and dispose of it to the men
of the regiment.
As far as Young's peculations have been
investigated he is discovered to be over
*10J short in his stores.

YOUNGSTERS DO BATTLE.
Lively Bouts at the San Francisco
Athletic Club Last Evening.
Two slashing six-round bouts and an
abundance of preliminary "goes" were
witnessed by a large number of fight fol
lowers at the San Francisco Athletic Club
last "night. Although little srore was
spilled there was enough stiff punching
to satisfy the most hardened ring-goers.
Jack Ennls and "Billy" Perry, two 125
pound youngsters of the popular club,
furnished the first interesting event.
Perry's height and reach favored him in
the first part of the bout, but Ennis'
hard punching evened matters. Perry
gained a lead in the first two rounds, but
after that Ennis showed to advantage.
The latter was a two-handed fighter, and
assuming the aggressive landed repeat
edly on his opponent. Perry was not at
all" backward and threw in some stiff
lefts which gained the approval of the
crowd. Both men showed willingness, and
blows rained hard and fast. At the con
clusion of the sixth round Referee Mc-
Laughiin declared the fight a draw.
In the bout between, Jack McMahon and
Fddie Toy, also 125-pound representatives
of the club the former was declared win
ner after six rounds of lively fighting.
McllÃhon showed superior science, while
Toy possessed grit and strength. This,
however did not avail Toy, as he was the
recipient of nearly all the blows. Judges
"Kid" Parker and Gus Koster favored
MoMahon. and he was given the decision.
The preliminary events were participat
ed in by Hogan and Dean, Whipple and
Dierks Ganfield and Wiley and Devine
and McDevitt.
It Was a Tie Vote.
The Supreme Court has approved thÂ«

' estate so that neither the assignee nor
Daly & Hawkins could act in the
matter.
P^ver since that time the matter has
been fought in the courts, and after
much contention Hawkins accepted
i from the late Annie Donahue a pay
! ment of $10 per week, he alleges, for
the remainder of his life, in satisfaction
of his claims against the Donahue
family as represented by her. But
after her death J. Downey Harvey, one
of her executors, refused to carry nut
the agreement and Hawkins thereupon
sued Eleanor Martin and Harvey, the
executors of the Donahue estate, for
the purpose of forcing them to carry
out the agreement.
The affidavit filed yesterday begins '
FOUGHT THE CASE FOR TWENTY YEARS.
Michael Hawkins, Cousin of Peter Donahue, Who Asks for a
New Trial of His Suit.
at this point. It was drawn by Mr. i
Hawkins himself, he acting as his own
attorney and is very circumstantial
and frank. It recites the agreement
and states that the ten dollars per
week were paid during the life-time of
Annie Donahue and that it ceased |
after Monday, December 7, 1856, Annie i
Donahue having died on December 12,
between two pay days.
Upon the refusal by the executors,
Hawkins filed suit for $9725 alleged to
be due him from the estate of Annie
Donahue. According to the affidavit,
when the suit came to trial, John T.
Doyle went on the stand and swore
that the payment of ten dollars a week
to Hawkins was a mere gratuity dur
ing the life-time of Annie Donahue, and
not Intended as a settlement. The
plaintiff was nonsuited.
Hawkins, in the affidavit, alleges
that Doyle, in his letters to him on the
subject, had never mentioned anything
to the effect that the payments were
intended as a gratuity, and he asserts
that he would have Indignantly spurn
ed and refused any gratuity, and that
he was defrauded of his rights in the
premises by "treachery and conspir
acy" and that Doyle well knew what
the arrangement was, for it originated
in the month of March, 1879, nineteen
years ajid three months before, in
Doyle's office, in a suit instigated and
suggested by Doyle himself, to set
aside on the ground of fraud a deed of
trust that the affiant had made to his
cousin Peter Donahue. The affidavit
goes on to say further:
That this affiant verily believes and
therefore deposes iir.d says that said suit
and other s-lmll:ir suits against this af
fiant were conceived in the mind of said
Doyle and urged by him upon hie clients
the bank of Donohoe, Kelly & Co., on ac
count of said Doyle's personal and malig
nant hatred of and hostility to said PÂ«ter
Donahue; that wald deep-seated rancor,
hate and hostility upon the part of said
Doyle was occasioned by the action of
said Peter Donahue in the year 1866. sum
marily dismissing said John T. Doyle,
who hail been employed as his, said Pe
ter's, attorney; that this affiant further
deposes and says that the said Peter
Donahue made known to this affiant and
others the reason for his abrupt and sum
mary dismissal of said Doyle, : -..-imply,
that during the absence of said Peter
Donahue from the State in said year 1805,
said Donahue being compelled to go to
New York In that year, I. ft. with said
Jojiii T. Doyle his full power of attorney
to manage and transact his business In
this State during his absence; that said
Donahue was absent six months ; upon
looking into his affairs after his return
he dismissed raid Doyle in the summary
manner aforesaid; that Peter was always
outspoken in giving his unsatisfactory
business experience with said 1 >oyle and
his management of his affairs; that until
the date of Peter's dÂ«au In Utffi. he
(Doyle) had never crossed the threshhoU
of Peter Donahue's home nor had he
ever entered his (said Peters) office,
hence the hostility Doyle manifested
In said suits, particularly the suit
to set aside the deed of trust of this af
fiant to said Peter in March, 1879, four
teen years later.
The affidavit proceeds to haul Doyle
over the coals for raising objections to
a codicil in the will of Mary Ann Dona
hue because of an informality, and re
cites that Doyle's insistence upon legal
forms harassed the beneficiaries under
the codicil. The affidavit goes on:
This affiant further deposes and says
THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 28, 1898.
that said Dnyle to gratify his malevolent
and evil nature intimidated said O'Kane.
assignee, and likewise influenced Howard
Havens, partner in the Donohoe, Kelly
& Co. bank, to so misrepresent, frighten
and intimidate said O'Kane not to act
as assignee for said estate of Daly &
Hawkins, notwithstanding Doyle, the law
yer, and Havens, the banker, well knew
that said O'Kane had in his name the
deed of assignment of all of their valu
able estate, and had ratified his accept
ance of said deed by a solemn oath that
he would protect their estate to the best
of his ability, yet they kept on persuad
ing and intimidating him until they fin
ally coerced said O'Kane to refuse to file
his bond as assignee; thus the valuable
estate of Daly & Hawkir.s was let go to
waste. O'Kane did not act, yet the deed
of the estate was on record in his name,
and nobody else could a<-r.
The affidavit goes on in this vein
unto the end. It treats of other mat
ters which in the main are not of pub
lic interest, and through it all there
sounds a note of grievance, of in
justice done and done under the forms
of law. The paper enters minutely Into
conversations and gives copies of let
ters written by Doyle and others. It
contains nearly 2G.000 words and is re
markably well written for a man who
had no education as a lawyer, its only
defect being Its historical character
and its references to subjects which
would not be deemed material to the
issue in a court of law. One of the
Doyle letters is characteristic and is
quoted here:

My Dear Sir: Mrs. Donahue don't care
whether Mr. Hawkins accepts the $10 per
week I offer or not. If he accepts she will
put at O'Farrell & Co.'s $10 per week for
him. which he can draw while he behaves
himself; but the condition is that he shall
quit talking or writing letters to any of
us, you or Mrs. .Donahue, or Mrs. Martin,
or Mr. Harvey or myself, about this
claim. He may commence as many law
suits as lie Bees lit. When he begins
a train writing letters and seeking inter
views we will stop payment of this sti
p.â ml. That is all there is about it. Tours
truly. JOHN T. DOYLE.
To Mr. Thomas Donahue,
The following Interesting bit of fam-
ily history appears in the affidavit and
is a fair Bample of Mr. Hawkins' abil
ity as a domestic historian:
Affiant had always from his early
childhood looked upon said Peter Dona
hue more as an elder brother that a cou
sin. He met his first wife, a good.amlable,
accomplished hospitable and beautiful
woman, at affiant's parents' home in
Paterson, NT. J., In 1852, upon his first trip
in June of that year, from California, to
purchase material for the erection of the
gaa works ever built in ban Fran
cisco, his brotht-rs, James and Michael,
with himself, having secured the contract
to light this city with gas. On leaving
ag.-iin. in September, ls. r .2. for California
he brought his bride with him, who be
came the mother of his children, and it
was this mother who wished this affiant
to be tin; godfather to her only son, the
late James M. Donahue, whose good
mother was? taken from this world .two
yfars later in giving birth to another
child. Her husband remained unmarried
for nearly four years, and never during
those years, wealthy and prominent
as he was. was there any entanpling al
liances or scandal attached to or connect
ed with his naive. He was a man of
high moral character and deep religious
convictions. Affiant further deposes and
says that there was no courtship attend
ing his Becond marriage. The lady lived
In Los Angeles, and one General Caz
neau. a friend of ex-Governor John G.
Downey, one day, when In Peter's com
pany, said to him: "Here, Peter; you are
unhappy without a wife; why don't you
go down to Los Angeles and marry the
Governor's Bister, Annie." Peter, always
Impulsive, replied, "I believe 1 will, Caz
neau." So the next day they took the
steamer and started for Los Angeles, and
news came back from Los Angeles by
mall to the family, within a week, that
he had taken a second wife. This af
fiani depos* . a that the said Gen
eral Thomas N. Cazneau related substan
tially to tiiis affiant the foregoing account
of the second marriage of affiant's cou
sin, the said Peter Donahue, shortly after
that occurrence.
Some years ago Hawkins entered the
carriage of Mrs. Annie Donahue and in
the course of the conversation which
ensued Hawkins' pistol was discharged.
H>> was arrested, but he disclaimed
any intention of injuring Mrs. Dona
hue. The affidavit gives the following
account of the affair:
Some days after affiant's interview with
said Doyle, in which he, Doyle, made
known to affiant that his client would
never pay affiant 1 cent of his claim,
affiant walking south along the east side
<>f Montgomery street, was saluted by the
coachman of the said Annie Donahue,,
seated upon the box of her carriage, In
full dress suit with cockade in hat. over
coal with great buttons, etc. The car
riage was In front of Mr. Doyle's office.
She then entered her carriage; it was
a one-seated coupe. The coachman start
ed the horses upon the turn across the
street, when this affiant opened the door
opposite the one by which his cousin's
widow bftd entered and quietly took the
vacant seat alongside of hlii cousin's
widow, politely raising his h;it nnd salut
ing the said Mrs. Donahue; that this affi
ant further deposes and Bays that what
ever sins of omission or commission he
may Vie called upon to ask God's pardon
for, for acts done by him In this life,
this carriage call upon his cousin's widow
on the 22d day of May, ISB9. will not be
one of them or among their number, for
the fear, terror, horror and despair that
came upon her usual stoic nature, upon
seeing me, I shall never forget or regret.
I was surprised and amazed at it. She
flod from ncr carriage. * â¢ â¢ As she
left the carriage there was a loud report.
heard of after all over the city, â¢ â¢ â¢
and it reverberated and echoed from this
city and penetrated through every city,
town, village and hamlet in every county
of this broad State, and resulted in con
vincing all good people that her husband
made no mistake in his "will," and it
still Keeps echoing and It will never die
out of h*r hearing. I was, thank God,
t:ie cause of the noise, but nobody was
hurt. It was not intended there should
be, yet it was through the special efforts
of yourself (Doyle) and your two part
ners, Messrs. Galpin & Zeigler, assisting
and prompting the prosecuting attorney
of the Police Court, that I was held by
the committing magistrate to appear be
fore the Superior Court.
Another interesting episode men
tioned in the document is the following,
describing a talk between Hawkins and
Peter Donahue when Peter was sick in
bed:
Affiant expressed his sympathy and re
gret to and for Peter, and the cause of it.
when Peter raised himself from the bed
and said, "Oh, Michael, this fight is not
at you. it is at me; this is the work of my
enemy, John T. Doyle, to get his revenga,
and he has so managed it through that
d d stupid shoemaker, John O'Kane, to
make it appear before the public as if
my brother James' children were lighting
at me. Oh, if my brother James were
alive, his children would not have done
this." Affiant replied, "Cousin, I know it
is Doyle's work, and it is his fight at you,
but 1 will make it mine. I will take your
fight upon my shoulders, and I can beat
Doyle." Peter said to affiant, "Ah.
Michael, you do not know Doyle as well
as I do." Affiant has, to the date of this
writing, 11:30 p. m., Monday, 25th July,
ISPB, been in that fight with Doyle for now
nineteen years and four months, and still
Doyle and affiant are in conflict over thy
home affiant deeded in trust to his cousin
Peter, he now having associated with

widow. J. Downey Harvey, the executor
defendant herein.
Mr. Hawkins personally served a
copy of the affidavit upon Garret Mc-
Enerney yesterday and Mr. McEner
ney admitted service of the document.
When asked last night for a statement
concerning the matter Mr. McEnerney
said:
"I have not yet had time to read the
affidavit filed by Mr. Hawkins on his
own motion for a new trial, but he is
insane and everybody knows it. He
was up before the Commissioners for
Insanity some years ago. This suit
has been running along for the last
twenty years, and it has been decided
four or five times. During the life
time of the late Mrs. Donahue he shot
at her and was sent to jail for a year
for it. He is laboring under a sup
posed grievance. There are no new
facts in the case that I know of. He
claims that he deeded his house worth
$2r>,000 to Peter Donahue and the Hi
bernla Bank foreclosed on it. Hawkins
brought suit against Donahue's execu
tors and the suit was decided in their
favor. He woe continually thereafter
writing letters to Mrs. Donahue, and
the executors pave him $10 per week
just to keep soul and body alive.
Hawkins, supposing that this gratuity
was fur life, brought suit for it, and It
was proved that there was no contract
whatever and that it was a gratuity."
WHERE STAMPS MUST GO.
Batch of Important Decisions From
the Treasury Department.
The following list of decisions relative
to the new stamp tax law was received by
Collector Lynch yesterday:
A 2-ccnt stamp is required on an order
for cash drawn on a merchant by one of
his customers.
Certificates of deposit drawing Interest,
if left a certain time, are taxable the
same as promissory notes.
If papers in the nature of receipts are
given In lieu of checks and are used as
commercial negotiable instruments they
are checks and not receipts, and are sub
ject tO tax.
Where certificates of stock are delivered
as collateral, the stock to be forfeited
only upon condition of failure to pay the
debt for which it is. pledged, a stamp is
required as a pledge and not as a sale.
Heal estate mortgage notes require to
be stamped In addition to the stamps
placed on the mortgage. ; -**Â.
Where there is a pledge of property ac
companying and promissory note, which
pledge Is subject to stamp tax under sched
ule A, this stamp tax must be paid, not
withstanding the fact luat-a stamp is also'
required on the note connected with it.
In cases of loans on real estate where
promissory notes are given, which are
not paid at maturity, but on which an
extension of time of payment is granted
without the taking of an ew note, it is
held that every such extension is a re
newal of the note within the meaning of
the statute, and that the. requisite stamp
must be affixed for every such renewal
or extension. This also applies to notes
discounted before July 1, falling due on
or after that date.
The person who signs and issues a bank
check without affixing the proper stamp
becomes involved in liability to penalties

SOUGHT TO
TAKE HIS
WIFE'S LIFE
Cowardly Crime of W.
H. Stallard.
SHOOTS HIS VICTIM TWICE
THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED IN A
FIRST-STREET CAPE,
To Justify His Act the Would-Be
Assassin Seeks to Slacken the
Woman's Reputation â Not
Dangerously Hurt.
Infuriated at her refusal to endure his
brutality any longer, William H. Stallard
deliberately shot his wife twice, shortly
alter noon yesterday. The shooting took
place in the Royal Restaurant, 14 First
street, when the place was tilled with
patrons, and that the woman was not
killed is due to her assailant's poor
marksmanship and his seizure before he
could lire again.
The tragedy was the culmination of
many years of marital infelicity, owing
to the husband's excessive indulgence in
intoxicants, which had developed all the
latent brutality and viciousness of his
nature.
The couple were married in Denver in
1874, where Stallard was employed as
switchman In the yards of the Union
Pacific Company. They have one son, 23
years of age, who is still in Denver. For
a time the Stallards lived happily to
gether, but gradually he fell into evil
ways and began to maltreat his wife in
a shameful manner, while his conduct
toward his son became so intolerable that
the youth was compelled to leave home.
Two years ago Stallard's intemperate
habits caused his dismissal from the rail
road company's employ, and then he gave
himself up entirely to drinking 1 whisky
and beating the poor woman who was
struggling to earn a living for them both.
Not only did he kick and strike her al
most daily, but he would forcibly take
her earnings and purchase liquor.
So unendurable became the life she was
leading that Mrs. Stallard fled from the
brute a year ago last March, coming to
San Francisco. She had a married sis
ter residing at 624 Fourth street, and there
Mrs. Stallard took up her residence. She
secured employment In the Emporium
and lived in comparative peace and con
tentment until one day Stallard found her
out.
'.the usual promises of reformation were
made, the usual reconciliation ensued, and
Stallard and his wife began life anew in
the Fourth-street house. He obtained a
position as switchman in the Southern
I'acific yards, but hardly had he started
to work before he renewed his former
habits. And now he found a new source
of torment for his wife. About the time
Mrs. StaUard started for San Francisco
an old Denver neighbor, named Budd,
also came West, and Stallard frequently
accused his wife of having eloped with
him. Nobody knew the charge was base
less better than Stallard himself, yet he
would work himself into a frenzy over
what he termed his wife's pernd"*' and
vent his rage upon her in the most brutal
manner. Frequently Mrs. Stallard's
brother-in-law and other occupants of the
house found it necessary to interfere to
save her from her husband's violenc<>
Stallard again lost his position because
of his habitual drunkenness, and last
April ho returned to Denver, his wife
having refused to have anything more
to do with him. Mrs. Stallard soon after
resigned her position in the Emporium to
accept the position of forf-woman in a
factory at an increased salary, but she
only held the new position a few weeks
when her predecessor returned to work
and she was thrown out of employment.
Two months ago Mrs. Stallard obtained
a place in the overall factory of Neubauer
Urns at lh First street, but her pay was
meager, and she was obliged to give up
her rooms in the Fourth-street house,
going to board with some friends named
ftann at 1063 Tennessee street. Here she
found peace and quiet, and though her
work was hard and her compensation
barely sufficient to meet her modest
needs she struggled bravely and con
tentedly on, rarely leaving her home ex
cept to go to her employment
Last Monday, while busy at her work
the door opened and Mrs. Stallard
confronted by her recreant husband
Fvarful of a scone. Mrs. Stallard asked
him to step outside and when the door
had closed upon them the distressed
woman asked what he wanted. Stallard
first demanded that she take him bark
once more, but this she refused sa-dr^he
would never live with him again. Stallard
pleaded, but she remained firm in her de
termination to have nothing- more to do
with him Finally she returm-d to her
work and Stallard went away only to
return again on Tuesday. He' waited on
First street until Mrs. Stallard had fin
ished her day's work, and when she
emerged from the factory he accosted
her. They walked along together, board-
Ing an electric car, for Mrs. Stallard's
boarding place is in the Potrero. Stallard
renewed his Importunities to be taken
back once more, and upon his wife again
refusing became so violent and abusive
that several times the conductor threat
ened to eject him from the car. Stallard
continued on to the house on Tennessee
street, abusing the woman all the "way !
and adding to his old charge the state
ment that she was then living with a man :
named Haason, who also boarded with
the Ranns.
Stallard finally returned to the city and
yesterday, when Mrs. Stallard eft the
factory fc-r her noonday meal, she again
encountered the man at the foot of the
stairs. Stallnrd asked her to go to lunch
with him, saying it would be their last
meal together. Not daring to refuse,
Mrs. Statlard accompanied him into the
restaurant at 14 r irst street, but finding
tne tables nearly all full they went out.
Stallard wanted to go to another restau
rant, but his wife demurred, saying she
had only a half hour for lunch, and she
';new of no other place In the immediate
neighborhood. They re-entered the place
and seated themselves at next to the last
of the tables In the center row. The
waiter took their order, and just then a
woman seated herself at their table. Stal
lard asked his wife to change seats with
him, which she did. She thought it
strange, but it is evident that he did it
for the purpose of having a better chance
to use his right arm.
Stallard once more asked his wife to
live with him again, promising tv take her
back to Denver and provide a grioii home
for her. She replied that it would be
better for him to go back and prepare
the home first, and if she found lie was
sincere in his promise to reform she
might give him one more cnance.
â¢â Then you refuse to go with me, do
you, Emma?" he demanded, straighten
ing up in his chair.
"Yes; you must give some proof of your
reformation." she replied.
Like a flash Stullard drew a heavy re
volver from hia breast pocket and fired.
The bullet struck his wife in tne right
shoulder, close to the neck. It ranged
upward and out through her coat, crash-
Ing through a window in the front of the
restaurant. Mrs. Stallard jumped to her
feet, half turning as she d.- so. Stallard
fired again, the bullet striking the right
shoulder blade and ranging across the
back under the skin lodged over the left
shoulder blade. ,
Before Stallard could fire a third time
William Fitts, a brawny teamster .sitting
just across the aisle, grappled with BtaJ
lard. forcing his right arm above his
head. The would-be murderer, who is a
powerful man, struggled desperately, but
a dozen others came to the brave JMtts
assistance, and while R. B. Chandler dis
armed Stallard several others helped to
throw him to the floor.
Somebody shouted to hanpr the fellow,
and there were calls for a rope, etc. Had
not Policeman Ross arrived just then it
is likely that Stallard would never have
reached the City Prison, for he was in
the hands of a class of men who would
think little of hanging a cowardly wife
murderer.
Stallard was handcuffed and immedi
ately pretended to be exceedingly drunk,
disclaiming all knowledge of what he had
done and declaring he was crazed l<y
liquor. It was quite palpable that the fel
low was shamming, for he had not shown
the least sign of being intoxicated before
the shooting, but he Kept up the stupid
sham for hours after he was locked up in
the City Prison.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Stallard had been re
moved to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
where the surgeons removed the second
bullet and found that neither wound was
of a dangerous nature. Her sister was
soon with her, and to-day she will be re
moved to her boarding place in the Po
trero.
Mrs. Stallard is about 40 years of age,
and is spoken of in the highest terms by
all who know her. The forewoman of the
factory where she is employed visited her
as soon as she could, and was loud in her
praise of the unfortunate woman, as were
also her former employers in the Empo
rium and the people with whom she
bfiards.
At first Stallard would not discuss the
shooting, pretending that he was too
drunk to know what had happened. He
rolled about In a most grotesque manner,
and it w; r all too apparent that he was
acting th' part with the object of evad
ing responsibility for his act Finally, to
a Call rpporter. Stallard said his wife had
eloped from Denver with J. J. Budd ovor
a year ago and that he had followed her
to this city. They had become reconciled,
but in April, last, he returned to Denver
to see his son. who was sick, and he got
back last Monday to find his wife living
with another man. Stallard could not be
induced to talk about the shooting, and
when pressed resumed his former atti
tude of helpless intoxication.
Those who know Mrs. tftal'ard best
scout the story of her elopement and the
other charge, and say that sj,;ch charges
by her husband are only more evidence
of his utter depravity.
In the presence of two detectives last
night Mrs. Stallard made the following
statement of the stabbing:
" I have been married to my husband
about twenty-four years. I have had
trouble with him ever since we were mar
ried. He has been so jealous and cruel
to me. I could not tell you the number
of times my life has been in danger of
him.
"About Christmas time my husband
assaulted me and T was confined to my
room in the Washington Hotel for some
time, the result of tho beating- he gave
me. I swore out a warrant for his arrest,
tut It was not served. I met my hus
band Tuesday about 3:30 p. m. on First
street. We walked along -First street to
Market, where we took a car. While on
the car he commenced to abuse me and
the conductor threatened to put him off.
He left me on the car about Bluxome
and Third streets and I continued until
I reached my home on Tennessee street.
A short time prior to the shooting my
husband came to where T worked and
sent one of the girl? to call me. I came
down and spoke to him.
"After a short conversation ho made me
promise to go to lunch with him. 1 then
left him, going upstairs to attend to my
work.
"As I emerped from the factory at
noon he was ptandinp outside, evidently
waiting for me. We went to the res
taurant in which the shooting took place.
He wanted me to go to Denver with him,
but I refused. Just then a woman, whose
name I do not know, came in and sat at
the same table.
"My husband at this juncture asked me
to change places with him. I did so, and
was surprised that he did not order any
thing but tea. I asked him why he had
not ordered something more substantial,
but he did not reply. A few minutes
later he again asked me If I would go to
Denver, and for the second time I replied
in the negative. He then drew his pistol
and shot me twice."
Took Rough on Bats.
Mrs. Delia Rourke, a woman 38 years of
age. committed suicide in a lodging house
at 131 Third street yesterday, by swallow
ins toukli on rats. She left a letter to the j
Coroner, in which she stated she had been |
des< rted by ht-r husband and had noth- i
ing to live' for. Her body was removed
to the Morgue.

DR. PIERCE & SONâ Gentlemen : Last Oc-
tober, while at Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas. I
sent for one of your famous "Dr. Plerce's Elec-
tric Belts," for Rheumatism, etc., and after
using !t only two months my complaints en-
tirely disappeared and I have not been troubled
with any pain or discomfort since. I consider
your Belt to be the finest body-battery in ex-
istence, as the electric current is both powerful
and lasting. I purchased your No. XXX Belt,
and now, after using it several months, it ia
a? good as new.
I heartily recommend Dr. Plerce's Electric
Belt to all sufferers. Youra gratefully,
JOHN P. ANDERSON,

A BANKER'S VIEW.
THE COMMERCIAL SITUATION AS SEEN
THROUGH NEW YORK EYES.
The New York circular of Henry Clews,
under date of July "" says: "The stock mar
ket Is Just new passing through the usual
period of midsiinniiT quiet and no marked
change la In immediate I 'â â -â  The outlook,
however, ii for a strong market. Weak spots
are few and difficult to find, and securities are
held with such confidence that the risks on
the "bear" side are altogether too great for
any ventures In that quarter in the absence of
unfavorable development*?* Only two possible
hlndranoea to a further "bull" movement are
worth considering: an outbreak of yellow fever
or complications with foreign powers arising
from the war. As a factor In the stork market
the war Is at much diminished importance be
cause of recent successes Nevertheless, delay la
not a favorable Influent and progress toward
peace is .julte likely tv be â  n xlgzag lines.
"Ultimately the war will prove a powerful
stimulus to the whole country. It has burled
old political Issues which were paralyzing
trade and Industry and developed In our people
a spirit of confidence and aggressiveness which
Wl 1 Inevitably l>Â« reflected In the business af
fairs of the nation The political situation is
more satis.'a-tory than for many years past.
New question* are tit'for? us, the solution of
â¢which will broaden and strengthen the whole
country from the Atlantic to the Pacific In
the financial situation there is also reason for
confidence. Money Is plentiful and promises
to continue so. Gold must come from Europe
In settlement of the â¢ â¢ Lord 1 nary trade bal
anco. and our supplies a:i' likely to br matr-
rlHlly Increased by shipment* from the Klon
dike. It is quite likely also that the banks
â will Increase their circulation to a considerable
extent when they have acquired .i suppply of
the new bonds; the placing of which as a
popular loan was h gratifying and significant
example ol the cnntlden<*<Â» of the people In the
Government. The moral effect of this method
was excellent and w>rtn its cost to the Gov
ernment, Which could readily have syndicated
the whole issue at a more profitable price.
"The agricultural situation is another and
very Important element of promise. Farmers
a:-- rai.uiily getting r.ut of debt, and with In
creased prosperity are buying more freely of
both the necessities and luxuries of life. The
better prices for whsat 'an the distribution
of many additional millions in the West and a
larger traffic for the railroads, both eastbound
and westbound, for some time to come.
Western merchants coming to this city are
enthusiastic In their reports of trade prospects
durincr the coming fall, and the outlook is
lhet the next six months -fill show a very de
cided business revival Even In the South
trade sh wa marked recuperative tendencies,
notwithstanding the dlscouraglngly low price
of cotton. Industrial activity Is growing end
i- likely to follow close upon business revival.
Many now enterprises are under consideration
bikl a larger demand for all sorts of raw ma
terials will soon be manifest."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 27.â Nearly all the
â trength and activity in to-day's stock markets
were confined to the first hour. At the open
.ng there was a rush to buy. as a result of
orders placed with commission houses this
tnorninK on the announcement that Spain had
iddresse.l the United States Govtrnment with
L request of peace. This early demand was fed
quite freely by realizing sales which held
prices back to within a small fraction above
last night and even dragged them below the
last night's level. Hut these offerings were
quite confidently and aggressively absorbed,
an 1 the demand was still unsatisfied. The
market was apparently embarked on a sus-
talned upward movement when sugar began to
pause after an advance of nearly 2 points,
which resulted In dislodging heavy covering
orders. Very large blocks of the stock, many
of them of 10,000 shares and upwards, were
taken on the advance. Hut after touching 141
support seemed to be withdrawn and a steady
stream was poured upon the market for the
rest of the day. Several times the price
steadied and rallied slightly, only to make a
renewed downward plunge, each successive de
cline dislodging heavy stop loss orders. The
price dropped over 4 points from the top Â»nd
rallied only feebly at the close. The slu.np was
coinpanled by rumors of unloading for inside
Interests with a view to retirement. The de
moralization in sugar unsettled the whole list
Â»nd put a stop to the upward movement for the
rebt of the day. The decline Jin the general
market was desultory and was not accom
panied by heavy offerings. It was very ob
vious, however, that professional traders
realized to a large extent at the opening on
peace news, and they probably viewed with
complacency the subsequent reaction, offering
opportunity to buy back stock at lower level,
declines from the best reached a point or over
In moat of the prominent stocks and net losses
In some cases are as much as a point. The an
nouncement during the day of the engagement
Df a small amount of gold In London for im
port had no effect. The transaction was ! re
tarded as of a special character, exchange not
let being considered at the gold import point.
Sterling exhange. In fact, rallied % cent in the
actual rate to-day. Conditions in the money
market remained unchanged.
Railroad bonds continue to be absorbed on a
large scale, recent issues of 4 per cent fÂ»>r re
organization purposes being the favorites.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 27.â 'With a slump at Liver
pool and favorable weather, Wheat started at a
decline. September, which closed yesterday at
65% c, opened at from Â«5@65%c, and settled to
64% c before all the early offerings could be
absorbed. July started at %c decline, the first
sale being at 70c, and before It did better It
sold another lc â  lower, selling at 69c. A de
mand for a small quantity of July soon dl
\ vulged how little was for Rale upon the appear -
I ance of any legitimate demand. From 63c there
was an Immediate Jump to 71% c. Trading
sentiment was bearish and every one seemed
to be on the selling side. About the only de
mand was from shorts, who had a satisfactory
profit and bought In on the decline to secure
It. The export Inquiry was aroused to greater
activity by the decline In price. New York
reported a considerable quantity of gold going
to the Continent. This caused a slight rally
near the close, but partly failed of effect on
account of a decline at , Antwerp r.t 2%@5
centimes reported on enormous yields through
out the Continent. â  September - closed %@%c
lower and December %<y%c down.
The heaviness of Wheat was felt In the Corn
pit and had a tendency to depress the latter.
Generous rains fell In various . sections, but the
weather was still very dry and hot -in some
regions of the corn-growing country. The gen
eral sentiment was bearish and Indication)! of
unloading by a prominent long started the
entire fraternity in a similar proceeding. Sep
tember left off %c lower.
Oats were firm early, but later sagged with
Corn. September lout %@%c on the day.
Outside buying started Provisions rather
steady. Then prices collapsed on the decline
In the other grain markets. Commission houses
sold freely. Pork declined 25c and lard and
ribs 15c each.

Job. A Call reporter asked him for an
opinion on the resolution ordering the
rails removed and also what his plans \
were.
"I will do my duty." said Superintend

emphasis, "and those tracks will be re

compliment to woman and to the noble
work in which the ladies of the Institute

to the war and declared that President

that Dewey in May, when he entered the

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES.
Business npd Announcements of the
Various Playhouses.
â¢â A Gallant Surrender" at the Co
lumbia Theater has been much Im
proved since the opening night, and is
now running in quite a satisfactory man
ner. The attendance i.-< good and the en
tertainment much better than was prom
ised by the first production. There will
be a matinee on Saturday and a Sunday
nlprht performance. Next Monday
night the Frawley Company will ap
pear in John Drew's greatest comedy
â¢ucresH, "The M.-.sked Ball," the play in
â *vri!oh lie made lf!s successful debut on a
star. Th t-omody will be well fitted to
the Frawley Company. Edward M. Bell
will be Been U\ Drf-w's part and May
Duekley win play the wife. The advance
pale of Beats la now going on.
.The Baldwin Theater will reopen in a
few weeks for the regular autumn Riid
winter Moason. ThÂ« first of the Inns list
of attractions booked by Frledlander,
â¢f;nlt!ob & Co. to appear will be Henry
Miller and his company, under the man
ng-ement of Charles Frohtn.in. The suc
cessful star is to present three plays
flurtng liia stay.
The Alcazar is holding its own this
v.tik with "East Lynne." The playerÃ
have recovered from thf>ir Monday
nipht's imperfections and have nettled
down to good work. '.'Richelieu" and
"Camllle" follow. Both plays will be
presented the name week.
Morocco's is enjoying a good patronage
by reason of the excellent manner in
which "The Two Orphans" is ivesented.
The production is an ambitious and nota
ble one for the house, not only in the
matter of acting but in the beautiful and
striking stage settings.
The big bill at the Orpheum, including
the Macarte sisters, high-wire perform
ers; the Angela sisters, descriptive vocal
ists; Wilton and Stack, horizontal bar
artists; Valmore, the wonderful ..vocal
mimic and many other star artists, is
ouyhfure. Such a condition of affairs
would not be tolerated twenty-four hours
In any Eastern city, and the Eastern peo
ple are supposed to be less Impulsive and
less liable to take matters in their own
hands than we are.
"It seems to me the Market-street Rail
wuy Companyâ for what purpose I can
not imagineâ is impelled by a strong de
sire to retard the progress of the city.
They declare they will not remove the
superfluous rails and that they will not
put down bituminous pavement between
and two feet each side of their tracks. If
the corporation had a particle of public
spirit in it there would be no delay In the
wurk of improving Market street and
making It one of the most beautiful thor
oughfares in the United States.
"n Its present state our main street is
a disgrace instead of a credit to us, and
there is no reason for It. except that the
city is in the grasp of an avaricious and
stubborn monopoly.
"Why, think of itâ the fifth city of
America and the metropolis of the Pa
cific Coast, with greater per capita wealth
than any city of the country, has the
worst streets. We boast of our progress
lveness and enterprise, and thousands of
travelers cross the continent and come all
the way from Europe to visit us every
year, but what a shock they must re
ceive when they go for a drive along Mar
ket street.
"1 am very glad, indeed, that the Board
of Supervisors has acted decisively, and
I sincerely hope that the resolution will
be sustained by the court. I presume the
railway company's attorneys wll dig up
an innumerable number of technicalities
and endeavor in every way possible to ob
struct the much needed reform, and op
pose the wishes of all our citizens."
"How long will It take you to tear up
the outer track from Second to Sixth
street?" asked tho reporter.
"In less than half a day." replied Mr.
Ambrose. "When the time comes for me
to act there wil be no delay. I will put
a large force of men on tho job, and when
they get at those rails thoy wll come up
in a hurry. I have consulted my attorney
and shall be governed by his opinion. He

ROOM FOR CONVENTIONS
Sacramento Citizens Mnke Pro
vision for the Dele
gates.
Arrangements have been perfected
making it possible to hold both the Demo
cratic and Republican State conventions
in the new pavilion building at Sacra
mento. This result was achieved yester
day by the committee of Sacramento citi
zens having the matter in charge, and
the fact was immediately communicated
to the State committees of both parties.
The news was received with much satis
faction, as it gave assurance that the
conventions will not be crowded for room.
and that the sessions can thus be held
with as t-mall amount of personal dis
comfort as the usual midsummer climate
of the capital city will permit.
It was given out some time ago that
the conventions would have to be held
!n the old pavilion building at Sixth and
M streets, for the reason that the new
pavilion would be in use by those who
are preparing exhibits for the State Fair,
which opens during the first week in Sep
tember. The floor space in the old build
ing Is somewhat limited, and the proposi
tion to hold the conventions there
brought forth a storm of protests that
threatened to injure the reputation of
Sacramento as a convention city. The
citizens' committee accordingly set to
work and succeeded in giving intending
exhibitors such assurances as resulted in
the surrender of the new pavilion to the
conventions until August 23.

The proceeding! opened with an objec
tion by Merton Allen to Mr. Payne's par
ticlpation, on the ground of the latter's
disqualification by the American Kennel
â  Chio. The objection being withdrawn, an
interesting dlscusnion followed. After an

CONVENTION
Third District Republi
cans Will Meet
ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 20
APPORTIONMENT OF DELEGATES
SAME AS STATE.
The County Committees to Determine
Whether There Will Be Sepa
rate Primaries and
Delegates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 27.
The convention of the Republican Third
Congressional District will be held In this
city Saturday morning, August 20, at 11
o'clock. This was decided upon by the
Congressional committee this forenoon
at their meeting held in the office of
Kobert Edgar, 963 Broadway. The com
mittee consists of the following named
gentlemen:
At largeâ W. H. Friend.
Forty-sixth Assembly Districtâ George
Oakes.
Forty-seventhâ T. W. Lydecker.
Forty-eighthâ C. L. Ingler.
Forty-ninthâ W. W. Morrison.
Fiftiethâ J. E. Furnum.
Fifty-firstâ Robert Edgar.
Glenn Countyâ J. K. Kendricks.
Solano County-^J. J. Luchsinger.
Contra Costa Countyâ W. A. Hall.
Colusa County â J. W. Browning.
Tolo Countyâ E. H. Archer.
Lake Countyâ W. B. Collier.
They were slow in getting together.
Mr. Edgar held the proxy of W. A. Hall
of Contra Costa County and Mr. Friend
that of J. W. Browning of Colusa, The
absentees were T. \V. Lydecker of the
Forty-seventh and C. L. Ingler of the
Forty-eighth Assembly Districts and W.
B. Collier of Lake County. The room con
tained many politicians, who dropped in
to eeo what action would be taken.
Among them were Messrs. A. E. Bolton,
William Nat Friend, Emil Nusbaumer,
W. H. Henshaw, F. C. Clift, W. W. Cam
ron, William Moller, W. H. H. Hussey,
G. D. Metcalf, R. J. Boyer, T. T. Dargie,
Charles Mautalen, G. A. Rudolph, C. H.
Miller, Paul Schaeffer and Frunk Arm-
strong.
Chairman Friend stated that the com
mittee had been called together in re
sponse to the action of the Republican
State Central Committee, and Secretary
Edgar read the proceedings of the State
Committee relative to the action of the
Congressional Committee and its powers.
Mr. Friend announced that the only
thing to be done was the ftcing of the
time and r>iace for the convention and
the apportionment of delegates.
Mr. Luchslr.ger of Solano su~<rested
that the committee should determine
â whether the delegates to the Congres
sional convention should be the same as
those to the State convention. This
caused considerable discussion, Dut it was
tacitly agreed that the matter was one
for the County Central Committee to act
upon.
The place of meeting called forth quite
a contest. W. W. Morrison named Oak
land, suggesting tna.t as Alameda County
had C 7 delegates she had the greatest
number to accommodate. Mr. Kendrioks
of Glenn expressed the idea that Oakland
wanted everything, including the candi
dates. He believed it would be wise to
hold the Congressional convention at
Sacramento at the time of the State con
vention. Tt would be a saving of ex
penpe, he said, as many would serve in
both bodies. Mr. Hull of Contra Costa.
tiy his proxy. Edgar, placed Martinez In
nomination, and Mr. Archer named Wood
land. Mr. Luchsinger presented the
claims of Valle.io.
On the first ballot Oakland received 4
votes; Sacramento, 2; Martinez. 1; Wood
land, 1; Vallejo, 2. Messrs. i takes. Mor
rison, Edgar and Farnum voted for Oa.K
land: Messrs. Luchslnger and Browning
for Vallejo: Messrs. Friend and Collier
for Sacramento; Mr. Archer for Wood
land and Mr. Hal] tor Martinez. On the
second ballot Messrs. Hall and Friend
changed to Oakland, giving this city six
votes, a majority. Vallejo received three
anil Sacramento two.
The date was made Saturday, August
20. at 11 a. m., on motion of Mr. Luch
singer, by a unanimous vote.
The question of apportionment of dele
gates caused another discussion. Mr.
Morrison moved that it be the same as
for the State convention, one delegate for
each 200 votes for Elector McKinfay. but
none at large. Mr. Kendricks moved to
base the apportionment on Htlborn'a vote,
and that delegates at large be allowed
from counties as under the call for the
State convention.
"I don't think Alameda County should
want it all!" exclaimed Mr. I.uehsinger
of Solano County, as he claimed a dele
gate-at-large from his county. As a sub
stitute to the prior motions he moved that
the apportionment be the same as adopted
for the State convention, and it was
unanimously carried. Glenn County hav
ing elected its delegates, the action was
ratified. '
The county chairmen will be required to
send In returns from the primaries or
caucuses for the election of delegates so
that they may be in before the ISth.
No formal recommendation was made
to the county committees regarding to
date of primaries, although it was sug
gested that they be held the same time
and place as those for delegates to the
State convention are.

MISS HAINES
NOT MURDERED
The Autopsy Disclosed
No Trace of Poison.
SUSPICION NOW AT REST
THE WOMAN'S DEATH DUE TO
NATUBAL CAUSES.
Chnrges of Underhand Work Made
During Excitement Are Retract
ed and the Trouble Is
Over.
BERKELEY, July 27.â Mrs. D. Allison,
whoso name was seriously Implicated by
rumors regarding the poisoning of Miss
Mabel Haines, is now entirely free from
the grave charge Indirectly preferred
against her by the mother of the unfortu
nate girl. Mr. Allison as soon as he
found that Mrs. Haines harbored suspi
cions concerning his wife's action
Insisted upon a post-mortem examina
tion. This Coroner Baldwin granted and
ordered the autopsy to be held this morn
ing. As a result the accusations made
last night are proved to be totally un
founded.
Drs. Payne, Rowell and Gladding, who
conducted the examination at 10:30 o'clock
this morning, were at first disposed to in
cline toward the theory that carbolic acid
had been taken, as the color and condi
tion of the dead girl's lips seemed to show
unmistakable evidence of the use of the
acid. But a thorough investigation failed
to disclose any traces whatever of car
bolic acid or any other poison. This con
clusion was reached by the physicians
shortly before noon, and was submitted
to the Coroner's Inquest, held this even
ing.
The apparent mystery surrounding Miss
Haines' sudden death, and the fact that
it was at first associated with the murder
of Edgar Halsey by Stacey Rodgers some
months ago, is accordingly all cleared up.
The Halsey affair did not occur at the
house in which Miss Haines died but at
her brother's residence, some blocks
away. The shooting in that case was
over the domestic employed at the house,
and did not concern any memoer of the
Haines family.
Dr. Allen's ground for signing the cer
tificate of the death of Miss Halnea was
confirmed by the doctors who conducted
the post mortem examination this morn
ing. They reported that death was due
to natural causes. Miss Haines is known
to have been subject to attacks of vio
lent vomiting, and it was during one of
these that a blood vessel in the brain
was ruptured, causing apoplexy, which
brought about the Quick and fatal re
sult.
It is understood that Mrs. Haines has
withdrawn the charges which first started
the suspicion that poison had been use 3.
Overcome with grief at arriving home to
find her daughter unconscious, and be
yond recovery, and noticing the smell
of carbolic acid In the room, the frantic
mother uttered remarks which brought
about the strained relations between her
and Mrs. Allison. Upon the decision of
the physicians conducting the autopsy,
that no" traces of the acid could be. found,
all ground for any accusation was taken
away, and the charges, made in the grief
and despair of the moment, were re
tracted.
The funeral of the deceased took place
this afternoon from the family residence
at the corner of Russell and Lorlna
streets. The Coroner's inquest held this
evening resulted in the verdict that death
was due to cerebral hemorrhage, caused
by an abscess on the brain.

Prince Henry's Version of That Un
pleasant Incident at Subig
Bay.
BERLIN, July 27.â A dispatch from
Shanghai to-day says an official state
ment from Prince Henry of Prussia in re
gard to the Irene incident at Subig Bay,
Philippine Islands, has been published in
the Ost Asiatische Lloyd. It says the
Irene went to Subig Bay to take oft some
Spanish women and children who were in
distress. At Isla Grande the German
warship happened to meet a steamer be
longing to the insurgents, which left
without difficulty arising. On returning
the Irene met outside Manila Bay two
United States ships which did not speak
her. In conclusion the statement sets
forth that the removal of women and
children was "effected from motives of
humanity and with strict observance of
the rules of neutrality."

Meeting of the Populist
County Committee.
FIGHT FOR CHAIRMANSHIP
GREGORY'S ELECTION WILL
CAUSE SEPARATION.
Ex-Assemblyman Bretz Gives a Brief
Prophecy on the Meeting to
Be Held To-Morrow
Night.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. July 27.
The new Populist County Central Com
mittee will meet In Judge Cliffs court
room to-morrow evening for the pur
poses of permanently organizing and
transacting auch other business as may
be brought up for consideration.
There promises to be a warm time over
the chairmanship. D. T. Fowler is tem
porary chairman and at the time he was
selected he was in favor of coalition; he
said that it would be suicidal to put up
an independent ticket, and made compli
mentary references to Judge Maguire. He
also participated in the famous caucus at
Sacramento. Since his nomination by the
bolters for Shanahan's running mate, he.
has taken a natural turn of mind, and
the out-and-out Maguire "Pops" are anx
ious to see F. J. Gregory elected per
manent chairman.
Gregory has no hesitancy in declaring
that he would be justified, under the cir
cumstances, in accepting the chairman
ship.
"My election would be a vindication of
my position," said Mr. Gregory to a Call
reporter to-day, "and a fitting rebuke to
such men as Bretz, who are not in har
mony with the best interests of the party.
Most assuredly, I look for a harmonious
meeting. The bolters cannot get control
of the committee, and, of course, thev_
cannot consistently remain in our camp.
The bolters will make every effort to
capture the chairmanship for J. C. Estey.
''If we have the majority Estey will be
our man," said ex-Assemblyman Bretz,
"but if the Buckley push and 'Mollie
Magulres" hold the majority, Gregory will
get it. We will leave and meet in my
office in the old Moffitt block, where we
will permanently organize as the only
Populist County Committee. The fusion
lsts stole our convention at Sacramento.
Two State Supreme Courts have decided
that a fusion ticket is not partisan and
must go on by petition and partake of a
new name.
"The meeting to-morrow night will
probably result In a separation," con
cluded Mr. Bretz. "All that the forces
can do will be to get divorced."
The county committee, by Assembly
districts, consisting of thirty-seven mem
bers, is as follows, and it will take nine
teen to elect officers:
Forty-sixth Assembly District âG.
Toyne, G. W. Krafts. N. P. Nelson, M.

MYSTERIOUS YOUNG
HURT IS LOCATED
HE SHOWS HIS FATHER TO BE
A FALSIFIER.
He Is a Soldier in a Nebraska Regi
ment and May Go to Porto
Rico.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. July 27.
Mrs. Alfonso Schaefer received a letter
from her long-absent son, Fred Hurt, to
day, that relieved her mind of a mother's
solicitude and at the same time gives
proof that J. J. Hurt, her divorced hus
band, did not tell the truth when he an
nounced in open court that he had re
ceived a telegram from the young man
stating that he was In the battles of Juno
23 and 24 before Santiago.
It was during the hearing of the peti
tion of Hurt for the removal of the three
minor children from their mother's cus
tody that Hurt exclaimed dramatically
in court: "Your son has enlisted in the
army, and I received a telegram Just be
fore I left home from him. in which he
eaid that he had taken part in the assault
before Santiago and escaped injury."
This Mr*. Schaefer declared was done
to annoy and worry her, and it accomr
plished its purpose until this morning,
when she received a letter from her ab
sent son. He is in Camp Thomas, Chick
amauga, Ga., and has not been to Cuba.
He enlisted in Company H, Second Regi
ment, Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, at
Chadron, Nebr., on May C, and on the 19th
left there for Camp Thomas, where they
have been ever since.
Young Hurt did not know where his
mother was located, so wrote a letter and
inclosed it in another to his aunt in Ore
gon, to have forwarded, and asked her to
write him. He declared his desire to
reach Cuba instead of coming home.
REASON FLED WHEN
HER HUSBAND LEFT
PITIABLE CONDITION OF A 20-
YEAR-OLD BRIDE.
Thrown Upon the Sands of Strangers
After Having Been Abandoned
by Her Legal Protector.
OAKLAND, July 27.â Mrs. Jessie
Bronko. a bride of four months and only
20 years of age, is confined in the Receiv
ing Hospital to-night, with her reason
dethroned. She and her husband came
here only three months ago from Fall
River, Mass., expecting to find work, but
fate seemed against them. Recently her
husband deserted her, leaving her penni
less. She threatens suicide and murder in
her insane fancies.
Mrs. Bronko has a pitiable history. Born
in Portugal, she came to this country
when a mere child, and was married at
14 Her first husband died, leaving her
with an infant to support. The child is
now with relatives in the East.
No doubt the mother's mourning over
the forced separation, added to her other
troubles, hastened her mental collapse.
Mr and Mrs. Bronko have been living at
716 Filbert street of late. He was re
ported to the police to-night as having
been seen on the street, threatening to
commit suicide, but nothing tangible can
be found to-night of his whereabouts.

THE TIME FOR
IMPROVEMENT
Last Sunday's Game
and Its Mistakes.
LACK OF TEAM WORK EVIDENT
THERE IS GREAT HARM IN
TAKING CHANCES.
Players Should Sacrifice When the
Situation Demands It, and Do
the Proper Thing at the
Right Time.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Tn reviewing last Sunday's contest be
tween the "Florists" of San Jose and the
Oaklands, I want to state that the game,
from a spectator's standpoint, was in
deffi a grand oik-, and from a strictly
basc-baJl view disclosed many Instances
of lack of tpa.m work In the field, but
principally at the bat; and also divulg.-d
the fact th-u some players are exceed
ingly careless In critical plays, through
no fault of theirs in one cuse, as I will
explain later, and also that they are
either Ignorant of the proper thing to do
at tn e proper time or care not, and, la-"t of
â¢Hi t! â  I them are detleient In the
Indispensably necessary art of sacrificing
or bunting.
Baseball being such an uncertain game,
1 dare not conjecture what might nave
occurred bad some of the plays I will
touch upon been attempted, especially
tbose where a batsman's cunning and
Judgment should be a, wirent. And I am
â  igly of the opinion that had that
game been properly played at the bat it
never would have passed the ninth in
ning.
I cannot deny exultation that it did,
however, for the reason that mistakes
and misplays were brought to light that
might have rested intact all season, and
an opportunity of correcting them done
likewise.
Tho most palpable mistake of the whole
game was the play of "Truck" Esan,
which gave the Oaklands their first run!
and. as it afterward turned out, the
game, as they did not tcore again until
the eleventh inning, while the Florists
did in the eighth. This error of Trurk
should never have occurred, md this
pravates the situation extreme
ly, as does the realisation that the play
In question should never nave come up.
V. Jth v man at second and third and I
think, one on first, Kent threw to third
avorlng to catch that runner nap
p;ng. His attempt proved unsuccessful
b rt Md larthy took the ball and threw It to
second, when there was not the slightest
possibility- of catching the runner at that
base.
He should never have thrown the ball.
't It Is i â  ' â  to to6B the sphere
around with ir.m on bases at any time
especially so when a chance to catch one
of them hardly offers Itself. The ball
however, came aJmost directly into this
eccentric Egan's hands, who, instead of
jetting both of them out to intercept it
only used one and missed it. Before it
was recovered the man on third had
crossed the plate with Oakland's first
run. McCarthy In the fin place 6hould
never have tossed the ball in that direc
tion, for, as I said before, there was no
-t unity to consummate a play.
Egan's mistake, however, was no fault
Of McCarthy's. It was horribly stupid
of him not to have put two hands to the
hall, and every player in the league
should profit by tne mistake. Don't for
gr'-odnesa' sake put one hand to a ball
when it Is possible to put two. I spoke
about this some time ago. and now that
it is obvious what serious results some
times attend this overindulgence in fancy
piaying. reform from being guilty of such
a gross mistake and do not be insensible
to its effects.
In this same inning on the Oakland side
three or four more mistakes occurred, all
of which wt-rc a direct deviation from the
elmp!i>st of baseball rules, and one in par
ticular, had it been attempted, end there
can be no excuee as to why It should not,
vr.ight have given a different aspect to
the entire game.
With a man on first and sf-cond and no
one out Bliss came to bat and. instead of
sacrificing, so as to enable those runners
to rf-ach third and second, respectively,
he trl<Hl to knock the cover off tho sphere,
end in consequence accomplished noth
ing except that he put himself out on a
fly to left field.
When it is palpably obvious that a team
is not hitting a pitcher often and safe
and that runs are very scarce there Is
no better game than the bunting and sac
rificing: game. And when there 1b a run
ner on first and one on second with no
one out It is always a good play to ad
rance the runners, no matter what tr.r>
pcore or situation.
In the case of Bliss there was but one
play for him to make on that occasion,
nr,<l it was to advance the runners. The
. the situation, everything called for
Kuch a play, yet he took that chance too
often Indulged In by the safest players,
and obtained the almost inevitable" re
sult
Had ho been fortunate enough to have
made a sinKic in such an exigency, while |
the play would be laudable, it would not j
be baseball, for under the circumstances
there was only one piny to mako, and it !
â was to bunt or sacrifice. Had he done
thie the chances of the game being won |
to that inning wore excellent. With men i
on second and third and but one out the i
Fltuatlon would necessitate the opposing
lnfleld playing in, and at Bucb a tlrre the j
chances for a base hit arc never better.
The next man up did not ninsrle. but
with that infield playing in he might have. ;
as hie chances for so doing were 50 per
cent better. Your rendition of the play
was not proper. Bliss, and as you were
told to bunt by nearly every player in
the team, you should have done so, and,
In fact, your own Judgment should have
prompted you as to what was the proper
thing.
Players si ould know when and when
not to sacrifice, and when they neglect
to do so in a situation that remands it, j
the welfare of the team, as a team, is '
not taken into consideration, and It I
Hhould be at all times.
The Baltimore team was successful be- I
cause every one of thorn, pitchers In- j
eluded, knew whnt to do in every emer- i
gency, ;ind worked only for the success I
of the club, collectively, Individual rec
ords going for naught. And to give an
Illustration <>f how devoted those boys
were to the Buccess of the team, as a
team. I saw Keeler deliberately sacrlllce
lust year when Clnrk of the. Louisvllles i
was but a few points behind him in the !
race for champion batter. He realized j
â¢what an honor it was to lead the league i
In batting, yet. with him. it would have I
been an empty honor had he not played
for the team's success, and sacrificed j
when the situation called for it.
Players should, therefore, think of the
team's success, and when an occasion de- i
manda a bunt or sacrifice, don't bo ufraid
to do so. Of source, to hit the bail feels
better, but the. proper play at the proper
time does more certain execution.
I cannot refrain from adverting to
another episode which occurred whiii '
Bliss was at the plate. Every one of the I
Oakland's team, particularly O'NeU waÂ« !
gesticulating in a manner -wild and ter- i
rlble, with the intention, no doubt of I
conveying to him the idea that he muot
bunt.
That is poor team work on thÂ« bench.
If you have anything, to say to a batter,
tell It to him before lie goes to the plate..'
If you want him to bunt, don't ten the
audience, the opposing team and the
Btatue on the City Hall about It. Kuch
open methods will defeat the effects of
any good play, as it enables the rival
team to offset the play, which can easily
be accomplished by a changing of posi
tion.
Be discreet at all times. Don't lot an i
opponent know what your intentions are. j
Keep him guessing as much as possible I <
the Fame as a pitcher does a batsman.'
Just imagine what a slaughtering pitch- :
ors would receive If they told batters the I
kind of a ball to expect. The same holds
good if batters make known their inten
tions. O'Netl told Bliss to bunt. I saw
him do bo, and so did the entire San I
Jose team. McCarthy, at third, came in
eloee and the whole infield was prepared
to take care of that bunt. Bliss fooled
them by hitting the ball, which would
have been a good move had not the situa
tion demanded a bunt or sacrifice. There
should be more team work on the bench.
It la not my intention to give the im
pression that Biles was playing for him
self and not the team. This would be do
ing him a great injustice. He, like a
great many players, thought the chances
for a hit excellent, and aico paid some
attention to the fact that if successful his
team would profit by the play. He made
a mistake, and even if he had made ft
safe hit I should criticise the play, for it
was not baseball.
I would rather see a team lose In en
deavoring to p.ay the (fame as it should
be played than see one win through tac
tics not baseball.
Another Instance which bespoke lack of
team work on the part of the Oaklands
was the manner Sullivan and Bliss went
after a foul fly in the vicinity of first
base. Either one of them could have
caught the ball, yet because there was a
lacking of team work it was permitted
to go safe.
When a ball is hit in the air the player
nearest it or who Intends taking it should
ejaculate in a loud and ringing manner.
"I have It," or In the parlance of the de
mand, "I got It." His cohorts should an
swer in an equally vociferous manner.
"Take It." In this way players will not
collide, and halls that should be caught
will not fall to the ground within a few
feet of players untouched, as occurred in
the case of Sullivan and Bliss.
Another instance of this sort occurred
between O'Neil and Donovan. They both
went after a fly ball and collided, but
fortunately Donovan had presence of
mind enough to hold the ball. There can
be no reason why these collisions should
creep into a game. And they are occa
sionally attended with very serious re
sults, as only a week ago a player back
East, in one of the minor leagues, col
lided with another aim shortly afterward
died from the injuries received. This
should be ai: awe-Inspiring lesson to all
players and convince them that team
work is necessary' If for n0 other reason
than the preservation of life.
I mentioned in the beginning of my ar
ticle that players are exceedingly careless
in critical plays, through. In some cases,
no fault of theirs. I spoke of Epan's in
excusable infringement, and I shall not
touch on another play, which. I am
nfraM, will not be recollected, for the
reason that it seemed and was a perfect
play.
However, I am speaking now of tho
carelessness of players who do not real
ize that they are so. The play In ques
tion occurred toward the latter part of
the gi'.nic. Hi ley singled to left field,
Mnsklman fielded the ball perfectly,
threw to second and there the play ter
minated. The way Mosklman stopped
the ball caused a chill to pass over ray
entire frame. Instead of getting in front
of it so as to be in position to block Its
course should it escape his hands, as
grounders generally do In the outfield, he
turned his head and body aside, rind cap
tured the ball without a semblance of a
doubt. It was an awful chance to take.
Had the sphere changed its course an
inch or mo?e it would, in all probability,
have evaded him and continued to the
fence, as it was a sharp hit.
In such a close game no kind of a
i chance Bhould be taken. Moskiman
! Bhould not have taken It. but should hava
j thought only of stoppi: ;the ballâ it made
! no difference whether he picked up cl*an
nr not â as there wus plenty of time to re
i cover and hold Hanley at first. I men
, tlon thi* incident only to impress upon
i players the necessity of being careful in
critical situ.itons.
Bran's negligence I have described, and
it should be a lesson to players who do
! not realize tho importance of being sure.
1 Mosklman completed his play, as he sup
i posed, in the usual proper manner, and
: is. therefore, nut :it fault. There is, how
ever, room for Improvement, and it is
never too late to take advantage of the
: fact.

A STUBBORN BUTCHER.
Fight Between the Police and a
Wealthy Butcher on McAllis
ter Street.
Fred Junker is a wealthy butcher and
has a store on McAllister street, near
Buchanan. He is determined to lay a
wooden sidewalk in front of his store,
but the police are just as determined that
he will obey the ordinance.
He commenced to lay the sidewalk on
Sunday, July 17. early In the morning,
but was arrested arid booked at the City
Prison. He gavo SlO cash ball and was
released. Four hours later he a.galn at
tempted to lay the sidewalk, and was
again arrested, this time putting up $20
bail.
The cases were called yesterday, and
â¢were continued till to-morrow. While
the defendant was in court his son, Fred
Junker Jr., attempted to lay the side
walk, and was promptly arrested by
Policeman Dunn. He was released on
giving $10 bail. Ills u>ze has also been
aspiirned to Judge Mogan'.s court.
Since Sunday, July 17, the police have
been compelled to keep an officer on
watch at Junker's shop to prevent him
from laying the sidewalk, so that his
fight against the ordinance is putting the
city to needless expense.
Ilobbed While He Slept.
William Rogers was arrested yesterday
aftt-rr.oon on a charge of grand larceny,
preferred against him by John Ross. Rog
ers is accused of abstracting $10 from the
pockets of Mr. Ross while the latter whs
taking his afternoon siestaon the benches
in the plaza.

CERTAIN IT WAS THE
WORK OF A MISCREANT.
I am fully convinced that the fearful catastrophe of this morning was due
to the act of a fiend who wanted to destroy our property. I have carefully
Inspected the piece of fuse that has been found, and I am confident that
It was attached to a percussion cap and that It was this cap that was first
heard. This was evidently placed under the blow cask, ami the effect of its
explosion, a few seconds later, was to explode the blow tank and cause the
first explosion that was heard outside tho works. P earing fire, such, as
follows nearly every explosion, we ordered out the men and started to
clear away the wreck. As they were working they discovered the fuse, and
then came the second explosion that resulted so fatally.
I cannot conceive why anybody should want to harm us, but I feel sure
that such was the case, I do not believe in any fool Etory about a Spanish
spy, but it Is likely that there may be a traitor In our mlast. It is very
clear that it was not his intention to kill anybody, for he took a time for
his misdeed when no one was near enough to have been Injured. He elm
ply wanted to destroy property.
The second explosion was caused by some of the material from tho first
settling on some of the filters. These filters are shallow, zinc-lined troughs,
and they contain bags of common salt, through which the nitrate percolates.
A little sediment remains, and this, in connection with the stuff blown
about by the first explosion, caused the second accident. The nitro-glycer
lne house was closed down yesterday, and we did not intend to open it for
work until we had put in some new machinery. It was nearly empty, and
certainly not more (nan thirty pounds of explosive was contained lii the
whole house. Tho explosion is the smallest we have ever had during the
eighteen years we have been, here, but, unfortunately, the damage to em
ployes is greater than usual. W. R. QUINAN, Superintendent.
I have mÃ'le a careful lnvrptipatlon, and so far everything points to
: the work of to-day is that of a murderer. I have gone

never any use f.ir fuse in the works, and the only reason I can think for its

Once again the little town of Pinole
Is wrapped in sorrow and its flags are
at half-mast. In four houses death
has again entered suddenly, and for
the first time in the history of its pow
der explosions there Is more than a
suspicion that the catastrophe of yes
terday morning was the work of a
murderous miscreant.
During the eighteen sears since the
powder works were first bttilt, Pinole
has become accustomed to periodical
explosions. The mothers aud children
live In an atmosphere of i.orrible an
ticipation, and as soon as the direful
boom â the sound of which is so well
known â comes over the hill, there Is
but one thought In every mind.
Yesterday morning, not quite a cou
ple of hours after midnight, the awful
H'.UTul was heard for the first time in
three years. Instantly the village was
awake and at the windows and in the
go to the scene, not knowing what they
might find, but believing that their ser
vices would be needed.
As none of them returned, and as
no deaths were reported, it was pre
sumed that the explosion was trivial
and that no one was hurt. With the
coming of daylight, the town was reas
sured and the anxious Wives and
mothers were congratulating them
selves that aJI was well, when a sec
ond and far more terrible concussion
was heard and, instantly Pinole knew
that its worst expectations were real
ized. A few minutes later the truth
was known and when the large flag
that always flies in the center of the
town was only raised half-way, the
universal query was â "Who?"
Shortly before two o'clock yesterday
morning a slight detonation aroused
the sleepers at the Hercules Powder
Works and the officials at once started
out to investigate. Before many seconds
passed there was a loud explosion, that
was heard all over the town a mile
away. The practiced ears of the em
ployes who stay at the works, familiar
with such sound, at once traced its
source to the nitro-glycerine house,
which stands by itself on the extreme
northern edge of the company's prop
erty.
Assistant Superintendent Bermlng
ham mustered a gang of men and at
once started to clear away the wreck
age. Although it was very dark it was
considered inadvisable to wait for day
light, as there is always danger of the
debris taking fire and largely Increas
ing the danger to the surrounding
buildings. The men on the ground were
re-enforced by many who came in from
the town, and probably not less than
seventy-five were working under Su
perintendent Bermingham removing
the wreck an hour after the explosion
occurred. An inspection showed that
the damage had been confined to the
corner of the building occupied by what
is known as the blow-tank. This tank
is a massive iron affair and was blown
to pieces by the force of the explosive
that was within it. The brick founda
tion was also blown out and the under
pinning of the building badly under
mined. Beyond the wrecking of the
blow-tank no groat amount of damage
was done and no one was injured, as
the building was not near any of the
bunk houses.
Just at daybreak a workman named
Dan Frayer discovered a piece of
burned fuse, about four feet long. It
had but recently been burned out and
was in such a position as to suggest
that it had been placed under the blow
tank. Frayer at once called Mr. Berm
ingham to inspect it. and by his re
sponding promptly to the call the as
sistant superintendent saved his life,
for a moment later there was a severe
explosion on the main floor of the nitro
house, and Bermingham and two or
three others who were insDectiiiff the

Both Explosions Took Place.
fire were knocked down by flying de
bris.
The explosion that proved fatal and
that completed the wrecking of the
nitro house occurred about 5 o'clock.
Its force can only be estimated by the
completeness with which it wrecked
everything- in the vicinity aud the fear
ful havoc and death it dealt out to the
workmen who were nearest to It.
Before thr> smoke and dust had clear
ed away cries of wounded men were
heard from the many places where they
were pinned under the wreck. As the
survivors were returning to the scene,
having naturally run off to a s:ife dis
tance, they found a mass of d<wd hu
manity that was afterward recognized
a.-= that of Patrick Murphy. A little fur
ther, another body, horribly mutilated,
waa found, and whtle they were being
lifted from the mass of timber, iron
and shÂ«et lead, two other victims were
uneurthed. The four bodies were car
ried up the side of the hill and later
were taken into town by the Coroner,
where an inquest will be held on their
remains next Saturday.
Although tho actual damage to prop
erty is remarkably small, the list of in
jured is larger than in former explo
sions when fifty times the damage done
yesterday was experienced. As such, a
large number of men were at work
when the second explosion occmred, it
The Blow Tank Under Which it Is Supposed the
Fiend Placed the Fuse That Caused the
First Explosion.
Is remarkable that more were not
killed.
The effects of the explosions were
remarkable in many ways and bore
most striking testimony to the erratic
nature of nitro-glycerine â when ex
ploded. Although a strong iron tank
was twisted in all directions, glass
tubes and globes a few feet away were
not even cracked or disturbed. Al
though doors and stairs were sent a
hundred feet, many panes of glass were
left Intact, Some men were nearer to
the seat of the explosion than others
who were killed.
Frank Battis, proprietor of the Pinole
Times, was a witness of the explosion.
"While I was looking that way there
whs a loud report und a cloud of smoke
shot straight up In the air a distance
of several hundred feet," ho said. "I
saw all sorts of things flying around,
and without waiting for anything fur
ther ran off up the track, as I knew
some of the boys must have been
killed. It came to me like a flnsh when
I heard that a piece of burned fuse had
been found that a strange-looking In
dividual I had seen the evening before
might have been the mun responsible
for the first explosion. I saw him
about 8 o'clock. Instead of taking the
road or the railroad track up toward
the works from Pinole, he sneaked off
across the hills and could easily have
gotten into the powder company's in
closed property without being seen."
The officials of the works, together
with Sheriff Vrale, held a consultation
regarding the origin of the fuse found
near the blow tank.
"It was this fuse," said Assistant
Superintendent Berminghum, "which
destroyed the works. It was found
J this morning just at the east end of
| the mixing house by one of our men
and was given to me. You see that
| the fuse has been burned. But who
used It I don't know. Why he used It I
don't know. You can see what injury
it has done.
"I heard the explosion a little after
half-past 1 o'clock this morning. It
woke me up, and when I was preparing
to come here one of the men told me
what had happened. I came here and
a number of men followed. We went to
work to straighten out the wreck and
were at the job when the second ex
plosion took place. It demolished the
washing house, overturned some of the
washing tubes and shattered the wood
en and leaden tanks. At the time I
was on the hill just ' Immediately east
of the mixing house.
"I was hit on the bark with some
thing. I don't know what it was. It
hurt me a great deal and I feel the
effects of It. If I had been nearer the
washing house I would certainly have
fared worse. I was working where I
I was at the time, otherwise I would
j have been among the men who were i
; injured. I did not have any idea that
the washing house was in danger be
cause there was nothing in it that
could cause -an explosion. Mr. Quin
an's theory as to the cause of the accl
; dent is that in the explosion of the
tank some of the add was pro
jected Into the salt in the tanks in the
washing house.
"Thin is very plausible. The effect of
the explosion was terrific. I saw sev
eral men hurled through the air at a
tremendous rate. And yet, of two
men who were working side by side,
one was killed, and the other, though
blown a distance, escaped injury."
The man nearest to the scene of the
la.st explosion and who escaped injury
in an almost miraculous manner was
Chemist Smith, who has been con
nected with the works for the past
three years. Detailing his experiences
he said:
"I was in my room in bed at the
time. The explosion woke me up. 1
sleep in the laboratory about 2000 feet
away. I rose hastily and dressed my
self, first taking the precaution to open
all the windows. That is a precaution
which we always take under those cir
cumstances. I looked at the clock and
found it was twenty-five minutes to 2
o'clock. I took my lamp and went to
the nitro glycerine works and found the
top part gone. We started to clear
away the timbera. The men continued

place, and then they set to work to find
the bodies and aid the wounded.
"I was In a part of the structure
about twenty-five feet from the mass
of twisted Umber. That is the effect
of this kind of explosions. It twiata
timbers and breaks them off Just as
if they were given a heavy blow with

"How I escaped I do not know, but
the force of the explosion RÂ«ms to
have gone in the direction opposite to
the place in which I was at the time.
The bodies of the poor men were
found on the hill side, all In nearly the
same relative position. They were hor
ribly mangled."
Patrick Murphy, one of the victims,
went to the scene of the explosion ear
ly this morning much against the
pleadings of his wife and family, who
had a misgiving that he would not re
turn alive.
The injured who were taken to St.
Mary's Hospital were all doing well
last night, except R. Bredhoff, who is
not considered out of danger.
The four injured men taken to
Fabiola Hospital on the special train
from the explosion were John B. Rice.
John Brunton, L. P. Evans and Edward
Healy. L. P. Evans, the foreman of the
acid department, sustained a bad frac
ture of his right arm and is badly
bruised and swollen. John Berming
ham Rice, who suffered a fractured leg,
graduated from Stanford with the
class of '79 and has quite a record as a
football player. These two are in the
most critical condition. All depends
upon the condition of their blood, and it
will be a week before the danger of
blood poisoning is entirely passed. They
are terribly sore to-night. John Brun
ton has four ribs badly shattered, but
is in a good way to recover. Edward
Healy has a badly crushed ankle, but
is the least injured of any. His
wounds were dressed, and time only
will tell whether he will ever be able to
use his foot again.
