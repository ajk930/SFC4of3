THE WORK OF SPANIARDS.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â A message from Captain Sigsbee
received by Secretary Long shortly after 9 a. m. to-day gives
it as his opinion that the magazine of the Maine was blown up
by a torpedo set by the Spanish, but urges the department not
to take action or give out this statement until he has had time
to make something like a definite investigation.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â A special to the World from Washington
says: A suppressed cable dispatch received by Secretary Long from
Captain Sigsbee announced the captain's conclusion, after a hasty ex
amination, that the disaster to thp Maine was not caused by accident.
He expressed the belief that whether the explosion originated from
within or without, it was made possible by an enemy.
He requested that this intimation of his suspicions be considered
confidential until he could conduct a more extended investigation.
This dispatch was laid before the President, at whose suggestion
Assistant Secretary Da-" cabled Consul General Lee to make what
ever examination was possible himself and render assistance to Cap
tain Sigsbee.
In the same dispatch Captain SigÃbee said that not more than
one hour prior to the explosion the magazines and boilers had been
carefully inspected, thus, in his judgment, precluding the possibility of
accident.

place in Havana harbor last night, and
which tore a stout battleship into
shreds.
There is, I regret to say, no reason
for hoping that this pitifully small list
of survivors will be swelled by the
names of any others saved. Wild ex
citement, and still wilder rumors, fol
lowed the conclusion of the terrific
blast. The explosion shattered windows
and electric lights and flung the city
into a tumult of excitement, such as it
has rarely witnessed before. Crowds
that had gathered in iÂ»ur>lic places dis
persed in quick order and other knots
gathered to follow a moment later at
the hotels some leader who knew no
more where he was going than they.
Fire engines came bounding down
the narrow streets from no one knows
where, and going no man knew where.
All the populace turned ont and throngs
gradually trended toward the water
front, but for half an hour or more no
one in the midst of that half-crazed
crowd knew aught of the awful tragedy
that lay just beyond.
The streets became congested and
one had a tooth and nail task to force
his way through. The report was first
that the arsenal had blown up, and then
it was said that the Spanish man-of-war
had torpedoed the Maine. And this was
while the men of the Alfonso XIII were
struggling to the work of rescue.
The Ward Line steamer City of
Washington and the cruiser were the
first to reach the scene, and their crews
did all that could be done to rescue the
drowning. Three boats from the Maine
were there, too. in f.-wtt, <here were
more boats to pick up swimmers than
there were swimmers to be picked up.
Some more survivors were brought
to the landing place and turned over to
the firemen, who carried the wounded
on stretchers to the hospitals. Others
were brought alongside the City of
Washington, and still others were car
ried to the Alfonso XIII. The wreck
took fire and lighted the harbor by the
lurid glare of flames, fed chiefly by the
inflammable cellulose contained in the
forward and after ends. The wreck
burned the long night through, and
when broke the solemn, pitying dawn
dark wreaths of smoke were still curl
ing upward from the shapeless mass.
At sunrise all the flags in the harbor
were at half-mast.
I spent the early morning hours on
board the City of Washington, and
could not help but admire the generous
spirit of all connected with that vessel
and the fortitude of the sufferers thick
ly strewn on mattresses about the deck
and in the staterooms. Once in a while
some poor sufferer would groan, but as
a rule they lay quiet as careless as the
dead whose bodies lay with the wreck.
A score of different causes have been
assigned to account for the explosion
and the cataclysm that followed, all of
them more or less reasonable, accord
ing to the light in which they were
viewed. Captain Sigsbee was up nearly
all night looking out for the comfort of
his men. He took a short rest before
Map of the Part of Havana Harbor in Which the Maine Was Lying When the Explosion
Occurred.
early daylight, and soon afterward he
stood on the deck of the City of Wash
ington peering into the falling mist
which was screening the wreck of his
gallant ship.
The City of Washington was under
way then, shifting her berth. She
passed close to where the curled and
twisted plates of the after superstructure
showed where the wreck had gone
down, and tears came to Captain Sigs
bee's eyes as he looked and thought of
the gallant men whose lives had so sud
denly gone out.
The Maine went down in water deep
enough to submerge all but the after
part of her superstructure deck. The
whole forward part of the hull was
turned completely inside out by the ex
plosion. Officers tell me that had the
explosion taken place when the vessel
was in deeper water, that first wild lurch
of hers would have sent her settling
sideways to the bottom. As it was, the
vessel sunk within three minutes, partly
righting as she touched bottom.
Reverting to the many explanations
that have been advanced to account for
the disaster, the officers of the stricken
ship are consistently silent. They will
say nothing beyond pointing out the
many precautions that are taken with
explosives and the care that is taken
with the magazines. It is inconceivable
how any internal explosion could have
occurred without the exertion of an
outside force.
The captain choked down his emo
tion when I asked him of the disaster.
"There is very little that I can tell
you," he replied. "I was in my cabin
at the time. I had just finished a letter
to my family when that awful crash
came. The ship lurched heavily to port
and I knew in an instant what it all
meant â that it meant my ship had
blown up.
"All the cabin lights were put out,
and I groped my way out of the apart
ment. I met my orderly running to
ward me. Reaching the deck, I gave
orders to post sentries, keep silence and
to flood the magazines. The magazines
were already flooding themselves. I
saw then that the disaster was complete;
in fact, I noticed a Tew of our men
struggling in the water.
"Only three boats were left of the
number we carried. These, gig, barge
and the second whaleboat, were lowered
as quickly as we could get them into
the water. There was a big hole
knocked in the side of the barge, and it
is a wonder it did not sink with the few
men who had climbed into it."
"What do you think caused the ex

WAR WITH SPAIN
MAY BE THE NEXT
THING TO FOLLOW
A Senator Talks Seriously of That
Contingency to Follow the
Horror of the Maine.
BOSTON, Feb. 16. â A Washington special
It has been known for some time
that the harbor of Havana was not
a safe place for American men-of
war. Members of the Foreign
Relations Committee of the Senate
hare received, in confidence, in
formation that within a week Cap
tain Sigsbee has telegraphed to the
Nary Department, begging them to
send no more ships to Ha r ana at
present, and adding, "We are liable
to be blown out of the water any
minute."
Senator Money of Mississippi, who served
in the last Congress as a member of the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the House,
and who visited Cuba last winter to make
a personal investigation of the conditions
there, says he learned then that the harbor
of Havana was mined throughout, and that
640 torpedoes were located at available
points. Senator Moneys statement is con
firmed in a genera' way by others. There
seems to be no question that there are tor
pedoes in the harbor, and when that is
admitted the burden of proof falls entirely
upon Spain.
Conditions could hardly be graver than
they appear to-night, and the promised
disclaimer for the De Lome letter has not
yet been received. Every naval officer of
any standing who has talked about the
disaster declares it is his opinion that
it was the result of design, and that no
mere accident could have brought about
such terrible consequences. Among the
members of Congress the opinion is al
most unanimous that the destruction of the
Maine is due to treachery, and that the
American sailors lying dead at the bottom

of Havana harbor were sent there by Span
ish hands.
As a rule, the opinion at Washington is
that the Maine was destroyed through
Spanish connivance, and this opinion will
be maintained until proof positive to the
contrary can be adduced. Should it be
shown that the explosion was not due to
accidental causes war must result This
is the feeling of men who are versed in
international affairs, and who are not
usually carried off their feet by the out
bursts of popular excitement.
One of the most eminent Republican lead'
ers, a man who is perhaps more intimately
acquainted with diplomatic usage than any
other in public life, one who has a reputa
tion for conservatism and carefulness of
speech, and who on more than one occasion
has spoken the sentiments of the adminis
tration in Congress, said last night that if
it should be proven that Spain was in any
way responsible for the destruction of tht
Maine, war would inevitably result.
He was asked if Spain could be considered
liable in a monetary sense for damages.
" There is no question of monetary dam
ages," he replied emphatically, "which
could be thought of for a moment. This is
a matter which passes far beyond anything
of that kind. Consider for a moment what
has happened! An American man-of-war
has been sunk in the harbor of the one
unfriendly nation in the world.
"It is not a question for us to discuss
from a scientific point of view. Had the
Maine foundered in the harbor of Glasgow,
then it might be a subject for considera
tion. The philosophers have no standing in
such a case."
It was suggested to him that divers
might be sent to the bottom of the harbor to
investigate the condition of the wreck and2
find out just how the explosion occurred.
"What good will that do?" he asked.
â¢â¢What can divers discover about a hulk of \
5000 tons of steel sunk in the mud and j
filth of the foulest harbor in the world ? I
No ! There is no investigation of that kind
which can be of the slightest value. If the
presumption is that the Maine was sunk by
outside means, then Spain must be held
strittly accountable, and there is only one
way known among the nations of the world
by which accountability can be enforced.
If the tragedy was due to a torpedo, then it
must be assumed that this torpedo was
directed by those who are in control of the
harbor and the city.
"No, disavowal can a rail nothing. Spain
might say that it was the work of an irre
sponsible and crazy subordinate. She
might offer the most abject apology and put
to death every man responsible directly or
indirectly. Even that would not avail.
There is only one way in which satisfaction
can be given. That is through an appeal to
arms."
The man who said this is not a jingo. If
his name were to be disclosed it would carry
weight on two continents, and he spoke with
a seriousness which was born of the gravity
of the situation.

plosion?" I asked Captain Sigsbee.
"You will have to excuse me from
answering that," he replied. "In such
cases it is best not to think; it is best to
know. That requires investigation and
time."
Lieutenant John T. Bfandin, who was
the officer of the watch at the time of
the explosion, gave me this version of
his own experiences and of tht whole
case under his immediate observation.
"I went on watch at 6 o'clock, relieving
Lieutenant Blow. At 9:40 o'clock,
while on the port side of the quarter
deck, an explosion occurred, seemingly
on the port side forward, followed im
mediately by a second one. I was struck
on the head by a flying piece of wreck
age, but not stunned. I climbed on the
poop deck, where I found the captain,
the executive officers and several others.
The barge and gig were lowered and
manned, they being the only boats left.
We picked up all the wounded that
could be found and put them into the
boats.
"The Spanish flagship Alfonso XIII
had sent four or five boats very prompt
ly to our aid, and more of our wounded
were sent to the Alfonso. One of our
boats pulled around the Maine and
picked up several men who had been
blown into the water. The executive
officer went forward to see if the fire
could be put out. and found that it was
useless to try to do anything to save
the ship, as she was a total wreck.
"The captain then gave the order to I
abandon the ship, and most of us went
in the boats of the City of Washington
of the Ward Line, where we were most i
cordially received and cordially treated.
The captain was the last to leave the
ship."
Paymaster Ray, who only a few day?
ago relieved Paymaster Littlefield on
the Maine, told me of his experience.
"I was in my room writing a letter,"'
Mr. Kay said, "when I felt the shock.
Long residence in earthquake countries
has given me the instinct to get under a
door when- I hear a noise of that sort,
and it is lucky for me that I am pos
sessed of that sort of instinct, for I
had hardly got under the door iamb be
fore debris was crashing all around me.
After the shower I made my way on
deck and got into the barge. I took
an oar, as did Lieutenant Blow and
Engineer Morris. We pulled a long
time, but found only one man, whom
we picked up."
<: I was sitting abaft the aft turret talk
ing to Boatswain Larkin," said Assist
ant Engineer j. R. Morris, "I am a
bit hazy as to how it all happened. AH
I can remember now is I was thrown to
the deck and that when I regained my
feet and tried to reach the superstruc
ture I was three times knocked down
by falling wreckage. I got on the
superstructure some how and then into
the barge. Fred Lanahan, landsman,
was sleeping in his hammock under the
topgallant forecastle. He was hoisted
high into the air by the explosion, anU
strangely enough was fished out of the
water with never a bruise or burn."
The steamship Olivette arrived early
in the morning. As soon as her passen
gers had been landed the wounded from
the hospitals ashore and from the Al
fonso XIII were transferred to her. To
her were also sent as passengers to Key
West, Lieutenant John Hood and
twelve officers of the Maine. Dr. Dud
ley of the United States marine hospital
service in Havana accompanied the ship
as medical officer in charge of the
wounded.
The lighthouse steamer Mangrove
reached Havana early in the afternoon,
followed shortly afterward by the sup
ply steamer Fern, tender to the North
Atlantic fleet.
The loss of Lieutenant Jenkins and \
Cadet Merritt is deeply felt. Poor Jen- j
kins â I had seen him a few hours be- i
fore in the Hotel Ingletarra. He was j
to have taken dinner with me, but at
the last moment decided to potspone
the engagement.
There were three magazines forward, !
but a!! of them contained powder, and i
my informants could not understand |
how this could be exploded by a tor- j
pedo bursting under water.
When the cable closed at I o'clock
last night only thirty-seven officers and |
men had been reported as surviving the :
explosion. Before daylight it was
known that more had been brought
ashore and taken to the hospitals or
were on board the ships in the harbor.
I made the rounds of the hospitals. |

the wounded had been brought in and
had received attention, but one by one
.ill night long stretchers bearing sea
men, burned and scarred, were carried
into the wards. The Spanish doctors in
charge did all that lay in human power.
The hospitals were already crowded
with sick soldiers, but room was im
mediately made for the wounded from
the Maine.
I have asked several officers of the
Maine what, in their opinion, caused
the explosion and what they believed it
to be.
"I do not believe it was a torpedo
and I do not believe it was a mine,"
three who were willing to express an
opinion at all said to me. Among their
reasons for thinking so is the fact that
neither a torpedo nor a mine would
have caused the destruction that the
explosion wrought. There is no doubt
that the explosion came from the for
ward and port side. It was argued
that a torpedo exploded against the
sides of the ship might by its detona
tion set off any high explosives located
near, but there were no high explosives
stowed forward in the Maine, the gun
cotton magazine being located aft.
I had an interview with General Lee.
who declined to express any opinion
regarding the cause of the accident.
He says no doubt an inquiry by experts
will be held and the American public
should remain tranquil until the result
of that investigation can be made
known. He cannot at present accept
the theory that the first explosion came
from underneath the ship.
The Municipal Council of the Colonial
Government to-day visited Lee and ex
pressed condolence.
A number of the men at San Am
brosia Hospital are destined to carry t(
the grave some, I fear, very soon, the
marks of to-night's disaster. Whenever
a man could speak he said: "The first
explosion occurred amidships."
"What was there a,midships to ex
plode?" 1 asked.
"Nothing on board," was the inva
riable reply, "but God knows what was
underneath the ship."
From seventeen swathed men lying
i between life and death I heard re
j pea ted those same words, "The first ex
j plosion took place amidships."
The officers of the City of Washing
ton will aJso make statements to this
effect when they arrive in New York.
It Js worthy of notice that fifteen min
utes after the explosion on the Maine
the Alfonso XIII was being towed out
of the reach of danger.
OFFICIALS AT SEA
ABOUT THE DISASTER.
But There Ib a Clear Idea That Spain
Is at Fault for the Catas
trophe.
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â Just what
caused the accident that sent the
! United States warship Maine to the
i bottom of Havana harbor last night is
i still unknown in "Washington, al
! though it is gradually coming to be be
! lieved that the explosion was the work
i of some person, either Cuban or Span
;lard.
Dispatches from Havana to this Gov
ernment to-day were not specific upon
the accident. General Lee, United
States Consul, was apparently as much
at sea as anybody, and it is likely to
be some time before the truth of the
matter comes out. The feeling in
Washington was intense, and it is the
general belief that the Spaniards are
responsible for the loss of the Maine,
although it is frequently suggested
that the work may have been done by
Cubans, who would like to get this
country embroiled in a war with
Spain. Still this is not generally ac
cepted.
It was noticed this morning that the
Spanish Government was remarkably
prompt in getting a message of sym
pathy to the United States Govern
ment. The unusual promptness ex
cited the suspicion that if the Maine
was sunk by Spaniards the Govern
ment at Madrid had previous knowl
edge of the plot.
Secretary Long was urged by pretty
nearly all of his associates to send
warships to Havana Immediately. The
Secretary, on the other hand, was urg
ed by General Lee at Havana not to
send warships there, whatever else he
did.
This signifies that the feeling at Ha
vana must be at a tremendous high
pitch, and General Lee feels that great
trouble would be sure to follow the ap
pearance of American warships in the
harbor.
His dispatches did not indicate that
ehlps were not needed, but that he
feared the consequences if they were
sent.
The department within recent years
has been greatly troubled with repoTts
of spontaneous combustion of coal in
the ships' bunkers, which have endan
gered the lives of the crews and the
safety of the ships. The Cincinnati,
twice at least, has been obliged to
flood her magazines to prevent their
blowing up during tires of this kind,
and the cruiser Boston has been 1n the
same condition. In some of these cases
shelving in the magazines which sepa
rated the powder have been charred by
the heat caused by the burning coal in
the adjacent bunkers. Although the
bunkers are inspected under the regu
lations at frequent intervals, so nu
merous have been thpse cases of spon
taneous combustion that the Navy De
partment only recently had the special
board Investigate the subjeot with the
view of applying preventive measures.
Unfortunately, this board was pre
vented from making the thorough In
vestigation necessary because no funds
werq applicable to the purpose. Even
empty bunkers have exploded. In the
Atlanta some years aeo. the bunker ex

ploded with great violence and the only
explanation that could be given was
that it probably was caused by the ig
niting of the vapors arising from the
new paint applied to the lining of the
bunkers.
The theory advanced by the Spanish
authorities that the disaster might
have been caused by the explosion of
the boiler is accepted at the Navy De
partment as within the bounds of
credibility. The Maine's boiler was
separated from the powder magazines
at the nearest point by a space of about
four feet, usually filled with coal. At
least one boiler undoubtedly was kept
under almost full steam in order to run
the dynamo and move the ship in case
of need. The explosion of such a boiler
might easily drive through the bulk
head and fire the magazine.
Inasmuch as suspicion exists in some
quarters that a torpedo was used
against the Maine, it may be said that
the majority of naval officers believe
that the character of the explosion was
hardly such as could be attributed to
a torpedo. The latter, charged with
about 100 pounds of powder err gun-cot
ton, it is believed, would have torn a
large hole in the bottom or side of the
Maine, but was scarcely likely' to fire
the magazine, which is not near the
bottom.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
HESITATE TO SPEAK.
And Yet It Is Apparent That There
Is Among Them More Than a
Suspicion of Spain.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â The great
est interest prevailed among Senators
and Representatives as to the extent
of the Maine disaster. The gravity of
the situation, in case later advices
should show the disaster was not pure
ly accidental, was admitted by all pub
lic men. Many public men, in the face
of the appalling catastrophe, the mea
ger information at hand and the possi
ble consequences, therefore declined to
express any opinion at this time.
Chairman Hltt of the Foreign Affairs
''ommittee, Chairman Dingley of the
Ways and Means, and members of the
Xaval Committee of the House all said
they preferred to await further infor
mation before expressing themselves.
Hitt said It would be well for the pub
lic to follow the cue given by Captain
Sigsbee and suspend judgment until
the cause was ascertained.
Senator JPlatt of Connecticut express
ed the belief that the explosion would
be found to be the result of an accident
from within.
Ex-Senator Butler of South Carolina,
a member of the Committee on Foreign
Relations in the Senate during his
service, was of the opinion that some
bold man had gone aboard the Maine
and placed a grenade with a slow
match where it would explode the mag
azine.
Senator Hale, chairman of the Com
mittee on Naval Affairs, said he had
just come from an interview with the
Secretary of the Navy and he felt con
fident the Navy Department would In
stitute a thorough investigation.
"There is no occasion," said the Sen
ator, "for Congress to take the matter
up. It is, of course, impossible from
the information received to say how
the accident occurred, but I feel confi
dent the facts when developed will
show that it was an accident. The
Maine was prepared for action in case
action should be necessary, and had
therefore many vulnerable points ex
posed. A battle-ship is little less than
a volcano under the most favorable
circumstances, and when legislating
for the increase of the navy I always
feel that a war vessel may prove as
dangerous to those on board as to
those to whom it may engage in con
tests."
The Senator expressed the opinion
that Congress would take steps to pre
vent the decrease of the navy, but
would not undertake to say there
would be immediate efforts to replace
the Maine. He said whatever could
have caused the catastrophe he was
sure no friend of Spain could have been
guilty of such conduct for the reason
that the act would have been a very
foolish and foolhardy one.
Senator Fairbanks said: "A thor
ough investigation doubtless will be
instituted by the proper authorities. It
is a most deplorable accident and one
which will awaken general sympathy."
Senator Warren of Wyoming: "If It
should develop that the Spanish had
anything to do with the occurrence
both the United States navy and army
ought to be summoned to take the mat
ter up in earnest. If it should prove an
accident it should be carefully investi-
gated, for it is high time such accidents
were prevented. It has apparently
come to be true that our naval vessels
cannot make any move, cannot go up a
stream or down a stream or out to sea,
without grounding or having some
other accident befall them. I hope,
therefore, that no time will be lost in
determining the cause and placing the
responsibility for the occurrence."
Senators Chandler, Mason and Carter
of the Senate Committee on Postoffices
AN AMERICAN TORPEDO BOAT.
and Postroads were talking about the
accident. Senator Chandler said no
one could tell how the accident had oc
curred as yet. It might have been a
torpedo under the bows of the ship or it
might have been an accident while
handling ammunition.
"But they are not likely to have been
handling ammunition at 10 o'clock at
liight." put in Senator Mason.
"Oh, they might have been," con
tinued Senator Chandler. "If the ex
plosion was from within it was no
doubt an accident; if from without,
then no doubt it was by design."
Senator Carter expressed the opinion
that no amount of investigation would
clear up the mystery. The explosion
would leave no trace of what took
place before, and the burning ship
would obliterate all possibility of
knowledge.
Senators Pascoe of Florida and Clay
of Georgia thought the matter should
be fully Investigated and a full report
made. If necessary Congress should then
act. Senator Clay said: "There is no
proof that the Spanish are in any way
responsible for this serious calamity,
and we should be slow to make charges
without proof to substantiate them."
Senator Morgan of Alabama, a mem
ber of the Committee on Foreign Af
fairs, said: "In the absence of definite
information as to the cause and results
of the Maine catastrophe, I would not
venture an opinion upon it. If it was
an accident, as the first dispatches
seem to indicate, it was most deplor
able; if it was due to treachery, as
some are inclined to believe, it was
most heinous, and no penalty would be
too severe for those responsible for it.
But whether the calamity was due to
accident or treachery, I should like to
see introduced in Congress a joint res
olution providing for the immediate
construction of two battle-ships equal

in size and equipment to the Maine and
costing not a dollar less than the ill
fated Maine cost. Action of that kind
by us would indicate to the world that
whenever or wherever one of our ten
tacles was cut off two would at once
grow in its place.
"It seeniÃ almost out of question that
it was the result, of an accident. It is
usual for a ship of the Maine's class to
carry her magazines in her bow, where
the explosion seems to have occurred.
But I can say nothing of that now. I
cannot guess and cannot speculate. It
is an awful calamity. Let us await the
particulars."
Senator Perkins of California, who
has been a navigator all his life and
knows thoroughly every detail in the
construction and handling of great
ships, said:
"I cannot conceive that such an ex
pjosion as that which is reported to
have wrecked the Maine could have re
sulted from an accident. The chances,
it seems to me, are 999 in 1000 that the
calamity did not result from accident.
It has been suggested that the explo
sion might have occurred while ammu
nition was being handled, but that is
scarcely credible, as ammunition on a
warship at anchor is not handled at 10
o'clock at night. Then, too, the ammu
nition on a warship is fixed ammuni
tion, which is not in contact with any
thing at all likely to produce an ex
plosion. Every electric wire and ev
ery spark of fire on board the ship is
far distant from the magazines, and
there is no possibility of danger by
those means being communicated to
thf> ammunition. The discipline of both
officers and men on the Maine, as well
as on every other vessel, is such that
the explosion could not have been
caused by any action of any one of
them. The magazines of the Maine and
other ships of her class, and the mech
anism which operates them, are con
structed with all the nicety of a watch.
"By the simple pressure of an electric
button any magazine on board the yes-
sel could be instantly submerged and
no flre could gain such headway as to
endanger any of the magazines with
out discovery. I am firmly of the be
lief that the horror in Havana harboi
last night was not due to accident. J
can scarcely conceive either that it wai
due to the treachery of Spanish official*
or was brought about through theii
cognizance. However, the situation ir
Havana is so critical and the Spanish
feel so keenly what appears to many o
them an affront that the Maine shouk 1
have been in the harbor, that It seems
not unlikely the catastrophe was duf
to the action of Spanish sympathizers
That it was not an accident I feel as
sured, and that It was due to treachery
I am convinced."
Senator Mills of the Committee or
Foreign Relations expressed the opln
ion that the occurrence was the wort
of a torpedo. "I would not say," hr
said, "that the Spanish were respon
sible for it. but some one it must havt
been who had free access to the waterr
of the bay. I don't think It could have
been due to accident and I think bup
picions, but no clew, seem to
offer evidence sufficient to warrant ar
rests. Efforts are being made to appre
hend the guilty parties."
Representative Newlands of Nevada
member of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, said it would be very hard to
convince the American people that the
explosion was an accident. He would
not wish to express an opinion until
further information was received.
Representative Mercer of Nebraskn
said this afternoon:
"If the death of 253 American Bailorr
can, upon investigation, be traced tr
Spanish origin, nothing will satisfy the
American people except war."
Representative Cousins of lowa,
member of the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, declared that If the Maine had
been wrecked by torpedoes by outside
agency. Investigation was bound to
develop that fact. "The fragment*
could not be destroyed." said he. "T

GENERAL ALGER
HAS ADVANCED
A NEW THEORY
Perhaps a Spanish Spy Can)e on
Board ir> Disguise and Put
Dynamite in the Ship's
Magazine.
NORFOLK, "VV, Feb. IB.â To-day a representative of The. Call
went to Old Point Comfort and was granted an interview by General
Russell A. Alger, Stcretary of War.
General Alger ha* been seriously troubled for about eight weeks
past with a severe caae of grip, but iB feeling somewhat improved.
He and Mrs. Alger are stopping at the Chamberlin.
General Alger earnestly asked for the latest news of the awful dis
aster to the United States battle-ship Maine, but the meager ac
count in the morning papers had not yet been supplemented by the
later bulletins, which, when they came, shed light on the catastrophe.
Asked as to his idea of how the explosion could have occurred,
General Alger said that it was perfectly inexplicable to him.
The statement that the shock of the explosion shattered windows
in buildings all over Havana h" regarded with undisguised incredul
ity, saying he did not see how an explosion of a battle-ship out in
Havana harbor could have caused such havoc.
To a question, if it were not possible that some one of the ultra-
Spanish element had been concealed on board the Maine and explod
ed a quantity of dynamite or other explosive, or caused an explosion
of the contents of the ship's magazine, he said that such a thing as
the coming aboard of one of the Spanish spies disguised as a United
States sailor was not impossible, and that once aboard he might have
remained concealed for some time.
General Alger also discussed the matter of the explosion, whether
from within or without the ship. He stated that probably no intelligent
opinion could be formed until the divers make an examination of the
ship. The position and fracture of the armor plates and curvatures,
whether flaring outward or depressed inward, will have to be noted.
If the magazine exploded the plates will be pressed outward; if the
destroying force came from without, the reverse would be expected.
except that intended for the Spanish
authorities, so that if it developed that
a torpedo was used, Spain will have to
account for it."
General Joseph Wheeler, the ex-Con
federate cavalry commander, now a
member of the House from Alabama,
sent the following message to the Pres
ident to-day:
"To the Honorable President: In
case of any trouble with Spain, remem
ber that my tender of services is on file
at the War Department.
JOSEPH WHEELER."
Representative Hilborn of California,
who is a member of the Naval Commit
tee, said: "It is improbable that the
explosion occurred from within. The
magazine may have exploded, but if so,
that was probably the result of a first
explosion from the outside. There was
nothing in the magazine to cause an ex
plosion. There was nothing but brow n
powder, of which there were 50,000
pounds, which burns, but will not ex
plode, except under peculiar conditions
which dtd not exist here. It is incap
able of belief that this nowder exploded.
The powder is in metallic cases. If a
man got in the magazine he would
have to tear open the cases and build
a fire to set the powder off."
FORMER DISASTERS
IN VARIOUS NAVIES.
Great Ships of War Are Peculiarly |
Liable to Accidents That Lead
to Their Destruction.
There have been several apparently |
narrow escapes of vessels of the new :
navy from destruction from causes ( ,
â such as have been surmised as leading ;
to the destruction of the Maine. Wet
coal and badly ventilated bunkers have |
*et fire to the coal in several chips with |
more or less serious results. Two years |
igo the Cincinnati's bunkers were dis
covered to be on fire, and in the ad- i
Joining ammunition room separated '
from the bunkers by a thin steel bulk- :
nead the boxes containing live shells !
were already scorched. The prompt i
.looding of the ammunition room saved
the ship. About six months ago the !
Jregon's crew had a fire practice from !
nmilar causesâ wet coal and neglected j
)bservation of temperature.
The economy necessary to be prac- :
ilced in allotment of spaces in a mod- :
;rn ship-of-war places elements of
langer which singly are bad enough,
3Ut when combined require but slight
;auses to send the whole fabric to
lestruction. The magazine and shell
ootsa for the main battery, the sec- ;
mdary battery and small arms ammu
lition are necessarily close together: the
itoreroom containing torpedo heads, :
jun cotton and other high explosives
ire in close proximity, and to make
aiatters still more uncomfortable the ,
iynamo room is located above but
juite close to the common center of i
destructive forces. With tempera- !
.ures in the hold as high as 120 degrees
md with coal bunkers red hot from
â¢oal undergoing spontaneous combus
ion it is a miracle that the adjoining
immunition rooms do not explode their
ontents.
Other navies have experienced serl-
Ml disasters from the cause of bad <
â¢entilatlon, and ignited coal in bunk
â¢rs, and fourteen years ago the British j
;!oop-of-war Doterel sank in the j
Uraits of Magellan, drowning most of \
her crew. The catastrophe was due '
9 generated gas in the store room con- j
aining paints, etc., which blew out j
he ship's bow.
A few months ago a lucky discovery j
was made of a bomb in the coal in- j
:ended for use of the monitor Terror. \
The explosion of this bomb in the fur- j
lace of the ship's boilers would have '.
lent the Terror sky high, and she
vould have added one more to the long ,
Ist of mysterious missing ships.
The loss of the Maine and the sacri- i
ice of lives is the most serious one in i
American naval history. The looses \
of ships and lives since the rebellion \
closed foots up to a large sum of money
and great loss of life. The aggregate j
â¢lumber of deaths from casualties in !
the navy during the rebellion of 1861-C5 ;
was 2272, including 373 'incidental cas- j
aalties and 95 deaths in rebel prisons. 1
Since the close of that war, wrecks,
tidal waves, collisions, etc., have taken
many lives, as follows:
Wateree and Fredonia, destroyed by
a tidal dave on the coast of Chile
August 13, 1868, and 28 lives were lost.
Oneida, sunk by collision January 24,
1870, in Yokohama Bay and 116 lives
were lost.
Saginaw run ashore on Midway Is
lands, in the Pacific, October 29, 1871,
and 4 lives were lost.
Huron, stranded November 24, 1877,
on the coast of North Carolina, and 98
were drowned.
Ashuelot, sunk on Chinese coast in
1883, sacrificing 11 lives.
Trenton and Vandalia, driven ashore
in the harbor of Apia March 16, 1889,
resulting in the death of 51 officers and
men.
Including 20 lives lost in minor acci
dents the total up to the Maine catas
trophe is 328 in all, likely to be now
increased to over 575. This record in
dicates that life on shipboard!- has its
perils in time of peace as well as dur
ing war, and it may further show that
the modern ship-of-war, whatever may
be her merits as a fighting machine, is
also to be dreaded by the people who
man her.
THE BATTLESHIP MAINE.
History of the Vessel Whose Bones
Now Lie at the Bottom or
Havana Harbor.
The ill-fated Maine was built In ac
cordance with an act of Congress of
August 3, 1886. She was an enlarged
copy of the design of the Brazilian
armored cruiser Riachuello, built in
England in 1883, and which has proved
a very superior ship of war. The Maine
was designed by the late Chief Con
structor Theodore D. Wilson, at that
time chief of the Bureau of Construc
tion.
The ship was begun October 17, 1888,
when her keel was laid, at the Brook
lyn Navy-yard. She was launched No
vember 18, 1890, and placed in commis
sion September 17, 1895. The appropri
ated limit of cost, $2,500,000, was only
for hull and machinery, and her total
cost without stores is given at $3,732,
155, including armor and guns. She was
credited with a trial speed of 17.45 knots
on 9293 horsepower, which exceeded the
calculations, but the actual maximum
sea speed was very much less. The
ship was well built and with strong
scantling, and was superior in its con
struction to the Texas, built simul
taneously with the Maine from modi
fled plans of British design.
When the Maine was fitted out for
her first commission the disagreeable
fact developed itself that with her
bunkers full the ship was drawing two
feet four inches more forward than aft,
a condition which is usually reversed
in other ships, and with such a trim
the vessel would be unmanageable.
She also showed a considerable list to
starboard, and this defect, as well as
that of proper trim, necessitated a
shifting of weights, removal of heavy
weights forward and ballast in the
shape of pig iron was put down aft.
These alterations took money and time,
and it was not until December 25, or
more than three months after the nom
inal completion of the ship, that she
was actually ready for service, and
made a trip to Fortress Monroe.
The Maine has been attached to the
North Atlantic station during her
brief existence; her cruising has been
very limited, and her total steaming
record for twenty-two month 3, up to
July last year, is only 9102 miles. Her
time since then has been chiefly spent
at the New York Navy-yard under
going alterations, on which objects
$241,279 were expended, besides $37,000
in repairs.
Uneventful as her career has been,
up to her first and final mishap, the
ship never developed any of the defects
such as other ships of the new navy
are charged with. The surgeons re
ported her as being comfortable for
officers and crew, the interior not being
entirely monopolized by machinery',
and as a consequence the ventilation
was all that could be desired and the
temperature in all parts of the ship
much below that in later ships.SHALL PAY
DEARLY FOR
TREACHERY
Spain's Position if the
Disaster Was Not Due
to Accident.
Call Office, Rlggs House.
Washington, Feb. 16.
I asked a member of the Cab
inet to-night to tell me what would
be the probable or the proper
course for the United States Gov
ernment to pursue If It should be
determined by a competent court of
inquiry that a Spanish subject or sym
pathizer was responsible for the
Maine's destruction. At first he was
disinclined to discuss this phase of the
matter, saying that the President and
his advisers were most sollcitouÃ for
the welfare and comfort of the wound
ed and suffering and were anxious that
the American people should suspend
judgment until the responsibility for
this terrible disaster was determined
after a thorough Investigation by a
naval court; but finally, after exacting
a promise that his words would be
taken down verbatim, he said:
"Please preface your dispatch with
the statement that President McKinley
1? reluctant to believe that the Spanish
Government had anything to do with
this deplorable affair. Indeed, you may
say that it is his belief that the explo
sion resulted from accident. At any
rate, his chief concern at this time is
for the comfort of the wounded sailors.
"In reply to your question as to the
course of the Government should it
appear that a Spanish subject or a
Spanish sympathizer perpetrated this
dastardly deed, I will say that the Gov
ernment would certainly prefer a claim
for indemnity against Spain. This
claim would be valid, although the deed
might have been committed by an
overzealous or irresponsible Spanish
eubject.
"The cost of the battle-ship Maine
was something over two and a half
millions. The indemnity for loss of a
human life I do not care to calculate.
If it should transpire that a Spaniard
â¢was the perpetrator of this terrible
outrage five million dollars might be
demanded as indemnity. Remember
now that all of this is based upon the
hypothesis that a Spanish subject or a
Spanish sympathizer was responsible
for the Maine's destruction. And
please emphasize my statement that
President McKinley is inclined to be
lieve that the terrible disaster was the
result of accident rather than design."
"But if it should be demonstrated by
a court of inquiry that a Spanish sub
ject was responsible for the disaster,
what steps might the United States
Government take to enforce its de
mand for indemnity?" asked The Call
correspondent.
"That is a question I decline to dis
cuss." said he.
I then saw a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee of the Senate,
who ppoke more freely, although un
willing to be quoted. He said:
"The tlaim .for indemnity against
Spain could be enforced by taking pos
pocsion of Cuban custom houses, in
case she refused to grant our de
mand."
"Suppose," continued the correspond
ent, "that the naval court should show
that a Spanish subject was responsible
for this deed. Would a mere claim
for indemnity in dollars and cents and
Its payment be considered as satisfac
tory adjustment?"
"You are rather anticipating things, "
said the Senator, "but I will give you
my opinion. I think that if it is shown
that a Spanish subject or a Spanish
sympathizer was the perpetrator of
the dastardly crime the Spanish Gov
ernment would be liable to a heavy
claim for indemnity. But she is a
poverty-stricken nation and five mil
lion dollars indemnity would mean a
good deal to the Spanish Government.
I do not think she could pay it. We
would have to whistle for our money."
"Or else take it out of her hide,"
suggested another Senator.
"But if it is impossible to trace the
responsibility for this occurrence, what
ought Spain to do?" was asked.
"Why, nothing," said the Senator,
"except to send a mere expression of
sympathy to the United States. This
she will undoubtedly do, as her naval
officers in Cuba have already assisted
In caring for the wounded seamen."

the survivors of the Maine with cloth
ing and necessaries.
Captain Sigsbee's message to Com
mandant Forsythe of the naval station
here, received to-day, reads:
HAVANA, Feb. 18.â Advise sending
American vessel at once. The Maine is
submergfd, except the debris. Mostly
work for divers. Jenkins and Merritt are
still missing and there Is but little hope
for their safety. Those known to have
been saved are the officers and twenty
four uninjured of the crew. Eighteen
wounded men are now on board the Ward
line steamer, in the City Hospital and at
the Mascotte Hotelâ fifty-nine, so far as
known. All the others went down on
board or near the Maine. The total loss
or missing is 258. With several exceptions
no officer or man has more than part of
a suit of clothes, and that is wet with
harbor water.
The Ward line steamer leaves for Mex
ico (Vera Cms) at 2 o'clock this after
noon. The officers saved are uninjured.
The damage was in the compartments of
the crew. Am preparing to telegraph list
of saved and wounded.
The authentic figures as given of the
casualties are 104 saved and 251 dead.
It was a sad scene at the dock to
night as the wounded sailors were car
ried to the waiting ambulances by ar
tillerymen and officers and tenderly
place on seats for conveyance to- the
Marine Hospital. The brave fellows
bore their sufferings admirably, and
some limped through the lane of eager
faces with their arms in slings, heads
bound and blood-stained bandages on
legs or trunks.
SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES
TO SAVE THE SHIP.
HAVANA. Feb. 16.â George Cowler,
an accountant of the Maine, Is among
the men seriously wounded. The crew
of the steamer Colon saved two wound
ed men.
The Maine, at the time of the explo
sion, was at anchor about five hundred
yards from the arsenal and some two
hundred yards from the floating dock.
The explosion put out the street lights
near the wharf and blew down tele
graph and telephone wires in the city.
Admiral Manterola and General Solana
put off to the Maine soon after the ex
plosion and offered their services to
Captain Sigsbee.
Vurnel, Burkhardt, William McGuin
ess, J. H. Bronner, Alfred Johnson,
George 80-lsemet and Charles Bagnan
were succored at the San Ambrosio
Military Hospital, and James Roure,
Francis Kehet, Daniel Cronin and
George Robert received attention at
sanitary headquarters.
The first explosion is said to have
been caused by over 600 pounds of gun
cotton, and the subsequent explosion
is alleged to have been caused by shells
and cartridges.
Among the saved on board the City
THE SPANISH CRUISER VISCAYA.
of Washington is a Mr. Dressier (Gus
tave G. Dressier) of the Maine, who
has lost both his eyes. The passen
gers of the City of Washington gave
up their staterooms to the injured
men. An iron truss from the Maine
fell on the pantry of the City of Wash
ington, breaking the tableware of the
steamer.
Lieutenant-Commander Wainwrlght
of the Maine was half dressed at 9:45
p. m. and was smoking in his cabin,
next to that of Captain Sigsbee, it is
said, when the explosion occurred and
put out the electric lights. Wainwright
then lighted a match and went to Cap
tain Sigsbee's cabin. The captain, it
appears, had been thrown from his bed
but was uninjured. They both went on
deck and gave orders to flood 2500
pounds of gun cotton which was on
board. The order was carried out, but
the men who fulfilled it never returned.
Havana, however, was saved from a
still more terrible explosion.
SEAMEN SUSPECT THE
SPANIARDS OF HAVANA.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.. Feb. 16.â A
special to the Times-Union and Citizen
from Key West, Fla., says: The
steamer Olivette arrived here to-night
with a large number of the wounded
and many other survivors of the Maine
disaster. The officers were, as a rule,
reticent and followed in line with their
chief, Sigsbee, in saying that the cause
of the explosion could only be ascer
tained by divers. But many of the
sailors were outspoken in their declara
tion of belief that the explosion was a
deep-laid plot of the Spaniards. They
are greatly incensed against the
Havana people, who have shown them
small courtesy, who look upon their
presence as a national affront and who
have published anonymous circulars
captioned "Down With Americans!"
They believe that the authors of such
expressed cowardly hatred would not
hesitate in terrible vengeance such as
the blowing up of the Maine.
These sailors, acquainted with the
drills, discipline and ensemble of a
man-of-war, pooh-pooh the idea of an
internal explosion as the last thing to
be thought of.
LIEUTENANT BLANDIN'S
STRANGE EVIL LUCK.
One of the unaccountable Incidents
of the disaster is the fact that Lieu
tenant John I. Blandin was the officer
of the deck when the Maine quivered
under the forces of the mighty power
that shattered her great steel frame to
pieces. He was standing well aft in the
superstructure, when the solid deck
under him sprang upward, throwing
him backward with considerable force
It was not the first time that Lieu
tenant Blandin had felt his ship go
down beneath him. When the great hur
ricane burst over Apia harbor, heâ an
ensign thenâ was deck officer on board
the United States ship Trenton. All
his watch he had walked the deck and
seen the barometer go down, down till
it seemed that the mercury in the
glass would disappear through the
deck. The British steamer Calliope wag
preparing to run for the open sea while
there was yet time, but Admiral Klm
berley, watching the afnchored German
ships, refused to leave the harbor till
the gale swept down and held him In
its grasp. So Blandin walked the deck
watched the glass, while the American
admiral waited.
The storm broke, the Calliope slowly
pulled out to sea. while the Vandalia,
Trenton and Nipsic. with the German
ships they were watching, went on the
reef.
Blandin, washed from the Trenton's
shattered deck, floundered through the
breakers and was heaved ashore, bat
tered and bruised. He recovered from
his injures, and thought of resigning,
believing he had passed through
enough horror for one man's life; but
he remained in the service to catch the
Maine.
SPANISH NEWSPAPERS
REGRET THE DISASTER.
MADRID, Feb. 16.â The United States
Minister, General Woodford, did not re
ceive news of the loss of the Maine
from Washington. His first intimation
of the news came from the Spanish
rear admiral, who called at the United
States legation to express, in behalf of
the Spanish Government, regret of the
disaster which had befallen the Amer
ican warship. The details then reached
General Woodford in the dispatches.
The Imparcial published an extra
edition, saying that the news had pro
duced a deep impression in Madrid
The Premier, Senor Sagasta, personally
informed the Queen Regent of the loss
of the Maine.
The Epoca says: "Whatever the re
lations between Spain and the United
States, Christian feeling and humanity
compels us to regret the catastrophe.
The spectacle of so many lives sudden
ly launched into eternity inspires com
passion."
The Heraldo remarks: "Although the
Americans represent us as a people de
void of virtues we must face this hor
rible misfortune sincerely and express
feelings of compassion."
The Heraldo adds: "In the face of
provocative Americans we shall always
remain proud people; but in the face
of men in misfortune of whatever na
tionality our hearts are always full of
pity." i

New York Preparing a

NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â Preparations
are being made for the reception of the
Spanish cruiser Vizcaya, which is daily
expected here. If the Spanish cruiser
Is hovering near these coasts s/ie would
have found it difficult to approach on
account of the off shore gale which was
blowing all day to-day and to-night.
It is thought that she will put into

SIGSBEE
FEARFUL OF
TREACHERY.
Did Not Want to Load Coal
in the Harbor of
Havana.
His Dread Was That Son)e Deroon
Would Put a SticK of
Dynan)ite in the Ship's
Bunkers.
WASHINGTON, Feb.
16. â "I don't want to be
obliged to take coal
aboard from Havana. It would
be a risky experiment. Not
that I suspect any one in au
thority, but there is such an ir
responsible rabble in Havana
and it would be an easy mat
ter to get a couple of sticks of
dynamite in the coal bunkers
without knowing it."
These were the words of Captain
Sigsbee as we stood on the bridge of
the Maine just a week ago to-day. He
was particularly careful to explain in his
conversation with me that an accident
of any kind, no matter how caused,
might be attributed to Spanish intrigue
and might serve to widen still more the
breach between the two countries.
The position of the commander of the
Maine at Havana was a particularly
delicate one. It was necessary to as
sume a free-handed politeness with the
Spanish authorities and officers, who, in
turn, were careful not to respond with
more warmth than official etiquette re
quired. On the other hand, leading
Cubans were anxious to show the
Maine's officers social attentions, but
were prevented by the frowns of the
Spanish official classes. On several oc
casions well known Cubans of conspicu
ous social and commercial positions de
clined invitations to dinner when they
learned that either Captain Sigsbee or
General Lee was to be among the
guests. Officers who made official calls
on the Maine were usually greatly at
tracted by some object on the other
side of the street when Captain Sigsbee
or his officers were met strolling about
the city. Several young Spanish girls
with American connections about a
fortnight ago asked if they might invite
some friends in the army and navy to
visit the Maine. Captain Sigsbee was
only too glad to have the ice broken,
and not only extended a general invi
tation, but made extensive preparations
for his guests. On the evening before
the day set for the visit the leading
military club in Havana was se
riously debating the propriety of the
visit, and it was decided that it would be
injudicious, to use a mild term. On the
next day the young ladies visited the
ship quite alone, excepting for their
chaperons.
While Captain Sigsbee constantly
maintained that under no circumstances
would he abridge shore liberty, he always
went in citizen's clothing except when
making official calls. He argued that as
the two countries were at peace he
should be allowed to go anywhere the
captain of any other naval vessel in the
harbor could go.
The silly incident the autonomists at
tempted to make out of his failure to
call upon them when he was in the
Palace on his first official visit to the
Captain-General was another illustra
tration of the unpleasant position in
which he found himself.
Aside from these trifling affairs noth
ing occurred during the entire stay of
the Maine that would in the slightest
indicate any lack of cordiality between
the Governments.
It has been a day of Intense excite
ment at the Navy Department and in
all departments of public life.
The appalling nature of the disaster
and the gravity of the situation that
would arise should investigation give a
basis for the undercurrent of suspicion

Why is "Pears' Soap â the

of treachery and foul play that ran
through all minds had a sobering effect
upon public men of all shades of politi
cal opinion. The fact stands forth, and
is little less than remarkable, that not a
single resolution was introduced or a
single speech made in either House of
Congress, save one of condolence with
the families of the killed, offered by
Mr. Boutelle and adopted by the
House. Public men expressed their
opinions with reserve when approached,
but everywhere there was a demand for
an investigation and full details in the
light of which the horror may be justly
viewed. Secretary Long undoubtedly
summarized the general opinion of the
majority of the naval experts in finding
it impossible just now to state the cause
of the destruction of the Maine. There
are a great number of theories, but
most of them are of a character that
makes it easy to prove or upset them
by a single investigation by a diver.
Secretary Long has taken immediate
steps to make an investigation. Late
this afternoon he telegraphed to Ad
miral Sicard at Key West to appoint a
board of naval officers to proceed at
once to Havana, employ divers and
generally to make such inquiries as the
regulations of the Navy Department de
mand shall be made in the case of a loss
of a ship. It is expected that this work
will take some time, and while there
are officers who say that in their
opinion it will not be possible, owing to
the probable disrupted condition of the
hull of the ship, to make out the cause
of the explosion, the opinion of the
majority is that the question will be
easily settled by a simple observation of
the condition of the ship's hull plates in
the neighborhood of the hole which sunk
her, whether or not they are bulged out,
as would be the case if the explosion
came from the inside, or whether they
are driven in, as would result from the
attack of a torpedo or the explosion of
a mine beneath the ship.
The majority of naval officers are
inclined to the belief that the explo
sion resulted from spontaneous com
bustion of a coal bunker, the over
heating of the iron partitions between
the boilers and the magazine or from
the explosion of a boiler, though the
last theory finds little support. The
list of the survivors that came to the
Navy Department this afternoon in
answer to a telegram was inaccurate
and made out the loss of life eight
more than the summary originally
given by Captain Sigsbee in the earlier
telegram, so Secretary Long telegraph
ed for a corrected list and also one
that should show who were and who
were not wounded of the survivors.
It was found necessary to do this
owing to the great number of pitiful
appeals for information as to the
safety of unfortunates on the Maine
that came from all parts of the coun-
try.
The naval constructors, in the light
of the dispatches thus far received,
say It is by no means certain that the
Maine cannot be raised and again
carry the flag. They say that while
she is a big ship, others as large have
been raised, and at Havana the new
floating drydock would receive her if
she could be at once got above water.
Captain Sigsbee evidently is taking
an interest in the future of the ship, for
he sent a telegram to Commander
Forsythe at Key West that was
promptly transmitted to Secretary
Long suggesting that a lighthouse ves
sel or some such small craft be sta
tioned In Havana harbor to watch over
the wreck. The latter, even if beyond
resurrection, contains valuable ord
nance and other property that doubt
less can be secured by divers.
It is said at the Navy Department
that this disaster is the greatest of the
kind in naval history since the sinking
of the big British warship Victoria,
by collision with the Camperdown, in
the Mediterranean, off Malta, in June,
1893. By that accident the British ad
miral commanding, twenty-two officers
and 336 men lost their lives.
The Spanish legation was early ad
vised of the horror by Captain-General
Blanco, who expressed his profound re
gret and added that the occurrence
was a chance accident, the undoubted
cause being an explosion of the boiler
of the dynamo. This was the only
specific cause assigned from an official
source during the day.
M. Dubosie, the Spanish Charge
d'Affaires, called at the State Depart
ment to express his profound regret,
and the entire Spanish staff left their
cards at the Navy Department as a
mark of personal condolence. At all
the foreign establishments there was
the deepest interest and solicitude over
the affair, and during the day Embas
sador Cambon of France. Sir Julian
Pauncefote of the British Embassy and
other foreign representatives called on
the President or at the State Depart
ment to express their regrets.
The disaster is remarkable in that
only two officers lost their lives, and
these were of the junior grades. They
were Lieutenant Friend W. Jenkins
and Assistant Engineer Darwin R.
MerritU The former was unmarried,

but leaves a mother and a sister. The
latter, it is thought, also was unmar
ried, but the department was not ad
vised concerning his family.
The President and several of his
Cabinet associates held an extended
conference about noon. It was not a
Cabinet meeting, as no notices had
been sent out, and only Secretary of
the Navy Long, Secretary Gage, Attor
ney-General Griggs, Postmaster-Gen
eral Gary and former Attorney-Gen
eral McKenna were present. The dis
aster to the Maine was the only topic
considered. It was determined to
abandon the reception at the White
House to-night and also the reception
to the general public to-morrow night.
At about 12 o'clock the Cabinet offi
cers came from the President's office.
One of them stated that the President
had given directions that all official
information relating to the disaster
should be given to the public. He added
that a private dispatch to Secretary
Long signed Rea stated that the loss
was over 270, but this was not official
and Mr. Long considered the estimate
too high. This was before Captain
Sigsbee's dispatch placing the lost and
missing at 237 was at hand. The Cab
inet officer said there were many evi
dences that the disaster was the result
of an accident. Up to the present
time, he said, no orders for sending an
other American ship to Havana had
been issued. Consul-General Lee had
cabled that the Spanish authorities had
expressed to him their profound regret
at the occurrence. Another Cabinet
official said one of the dispatches
stated that Captain Sigsbee was the
last to leave the ship.
The Maine horror formed the prinri
pal topic of consideration by the Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Affairs at its
meeting to-day. The opinions gener
ally expressed by members of the com
mittee in this informal conference were
to the effect that the occurrence may
result in grave complications unless
Spain can make it very plain that no
Spaniard was in any way responsible
for it.
A prominent member of the commit
tee said after the meeting that Spain
would be expected to make an expla
nation that would entirely clear up the
mystery, and that if she did not this
country would have a right to demand
such explanation. Most of the mem
bers of the committee refused after the
conference to express any opinion con
cerning the occurrence.
"It is too serious to talk about at
present," said Senator Lodge.
Senator Cullom said: "I cannot see
how the explosion could have been the
result of an accident, and I think the
time is rapidly approaching when this
country must do something."
Senator Clark only said. "It Is sin
gular that such an accident should
happen at such an inopportune time."

EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS
A SUBMARINE MINE.
Ingenious Theory Advanced by a
Naval Expert at Cramps' Ship
yard.
CHICAGO, Feb. 16.â A Philadelphia
special to the Tribune says: A naval
expert at Cramps' yards, whose knowl
edge of warships of all nations makes
him an authority, said:
"It's mighty hard to reconcile the
stories of an accidental explosion on the
Maine and its subsequent queer effects.
Now, first of all, if the explosion had
occurred entirely in the ship and its
whole cargo of ammunition had gone
off, I fail to see how the lights of Hav
ana would have been extinguished.
Water does not carry a shock just that
way, but the ground under the water
does, and it looks more and more to
me like a submarine mine.
"Really, I don't believe for an Instant
that the explosion originated on board
the Maine, and much less in the bow
section, devoted to the storage of tor
pedo ammunition. â  Let me tell you
something about-torpedoes: They are
filled with gun cotton. Gun cotton is
a very powerful explosive. The rules
of the United States navy compel all
gun cotton to be kept wet, or at least
moist enough to be in a non-sensitive
state, and as I know Captain Sigsbee
well â know his regard for order and
his high regard for dutyâ l know that
the Maine gun cotton was wet.
"Now, if we accept the theory that
spontaneous combustion occurred in
the coal bunkers adjoining the torpedo
magazine, we must consider that this
combustion had been going on long
enough unnoticed to produce heat in
the magazine sufficient to dry gun-cot
ton to the sensitive point. The explo
sive point is somewhat about the point
required to generate steam â 212 degrees
to 220 degrees. To produce this degree
of heat and transmit it through the
SPAIN.

bulkhead would require several hours
of smoldering fire due to spontaneous
combustion in the coal bunker.
"In any well-managed â and the
Maine was well-managed â the condi
tions of all coal bunkers is ascertained
as often as every other watch, or once
in eight hours. These conditions indi
cate that the margin of probability of
an explosion from the causes mentioned
would be reduced to the minimum.
"To sum up, it may be said that an
internal explosion is in the highest de
gree improbable. It may be barely pos
sible, but all the logic of conditions in
volved is against that theory. There
fore, whatever may be ascertained by
the examination by divers or by other
means of j investigation, there must al
ways remain solid ground for the sus
picion that the loss of the Maine and
the killing of a considerable part of her
crew was due to treachery."

WEYLER HAD PLANTED
TORPEDOES IN THE HARBOR
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.. Feb. 16.â
Some leading members of the Cuban
Junta here and at Tampa say privately
that in their opinion an investigation
will show treachery in the Maine dis
aster.
"You will recall that some time ago,"
said one influential member to-night
to me, "Just before Weyler's recall
there was talk of an American man-of
war being sent to Havana. "We had
reliable information that Weyler se
cretly had torpedoes planted in the
harbor, and it was known that if a
warship went in an accident might
occur. These same torpedoes are there
now and doubtless in good working or
der.
"We have started an Investigation of
our own and the entire truth will be
known in a short time. It is for the
interests of the Spaniards to at once
deny any hand in this accident, but I
know more than I can reveal at pres
ent. We who know of Spanish charac
ter gauge their denials accordingly."

IndignatioQ.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Residents of Washington, official and
otherwise, have accepted the sober
words of wisdom contained in
the message of Captain Sigsbee
announcing the terrible calamity
which befell the battle - ship
Maine in Havana Harbor last night.
Opinions differ as to the cause of the
disaster, but controlling minds of all
branches of the Federal Government
counsel prudence and patience while
waiting for a thorough investigation,
which will definitely determine the di
rect cause of the blowing up of the
battle-ship and the loss of 253 lives.
While the first impulse of the Federal
authorities has been to give proper and
tender care to the dead and wounded,
the cause of the disaster upon which
so much may depend as to the future
of Cuba and our relations with Spain,
is also uppermost in their minds, and
prompt measures have been taken to
make an investigation, which will leave
no room for doubt as to the primary
cause of the destruction of one of our
efficient battle-ships and the loss of so
many of our nation's defenders.
Whether by accident or design, the cal
amity in Havana Harbor will have an
important bearing on the Cuban ques
tion, the extent of which time alone will
show. It is felt that if the explosion
was accidental, the sooner it is known
the better it will be for the friendly re
lations between the United States and
Spain. If it was not accidental, the
sooner the responsibility is fixed the
better.
Among Federal officials and experts
in the navy, the weight of opinion,
based upon official advices and press
dispatches, is that an internal explo
sion, the exact cause of which it may
be difficult to ascertain, was respon
sible for the destruction of the Maine.
I can state authoritatively that the
President and all his advisers not only
prefer to think that the calamity was
due to some mysterious unavoidable
accident, but they actually believe
such to be the case.
Secretary Long, in discussing with
me the Maine disaster, said: "Captain
Sigsbee has made no report yet as to
the cause of the terrible catastrophe
which has befallen his ship, but it is
suggested that public opinion be sus
pended until his report is submitted,
which is very reasonable, as there are
indications that the occurrence may
have been the result of an accident. I
should say that as far as indications
go, the disaster was due to the explo
sion of the contents of the forward
magazines."
Secretary Long announced that there
was no present intention to send a
warship to Havana to replace the
Maine. This is matter of future deci
sion.
Another official of the department
with whom I talked suggested that
Spain would regard it in the light of an
unfriendly act if this Government were
to send a battle-ship to Havana to re
place the lost one.
"Besides," he suggested, "we have no
other vessel that we desire to lose."
Theories as to the explosion which
sent the Maine to the bottom were ban
died about to-day at the Navy Depart
ment as thick as snowflakes in a driv
ing winter storm. In no quarter did I
hear it suggested that the Spanish
Government was in any way respon
sible. It seemed to be the general con
sensus of opinion among naval officers
noted for their conservative views that
the calamity resulted from an explo
sion in the interior of the ship. All the
officers admit, however, that their
theories may be without foundation.
With a view to determining whether
the accident was the result of a torpedo
placed under the bows of the Maine or
the result of an interior explosion. Sec
retary Long telegraphed this after
noon to Rear-Admiral Sicard, com
mander-in-chief of the North Atlantic
squadron, who is at Dry Tortugas, di
rectlng him to perfect arrangements for
the appointment of a court of inquiry.
This court will proceed to Havana in
the Montgomery and investigate the
calamity. Rear-Admiral Sicard Is
expected to go to Key West, in com
pliance with orders of the department,
and commence to obey the depart
ment's orders in appointment of a court
probably to-morrow. When this in
formation has been received the de
partment will send instructions to tha
court as to the course to be pursued.
Divers will be sent down to examine
the hull of the Maine, to ascertain if
her bottom was driven in or out by the
force of the explosion. If the former,
then a torpedo placed under the "bow
of the Maine will probably be held re
sponsible for her fate; if the latter, aa
explosion inside of the ship will be re
garded as the cause. Until complete
reports of Captain Sigsbee and of the
court of inquiry have reached the de
partment there is no likelihood that
any representations will be made to
Spain.
During the court's investigation
the department will concern itself as to
measures to be taken to recover as
much as possible of the Maine's arma
ment. If the vessel can be repaired,
which is greatly doubted, then the
wrecking vessel which Captain Sigsbee
has asked will probably aid him to save
her.
What will be the result in case it is
demonstrated that the vessel was de
stroyed by a torpedo leading men in
Congress, members of committees
having to deal with foreign affairs of
the Government hesitate to discuss.
Although evidence seems to indicate
that the loss of the vessel was due to
an accident, even If she was torpedoed,
it does not follow that the Government
of Spain was in any way responsible
for the act, and conservative men who
make up the administration and those
who control the action of at least one
branch of Congress â the House of
Representativesâ will not act hastily
or without full knowledge of the facts.

Commander Dickins Chary of
Giving Out an Expression
of Opinion.
Divers Must Examine the Wreck and.

Held.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 16.â "We have
no definite Information as to the num
ber of war vessels in Havana harbor
last night." said Commander Dickins of
the navy to-day. "Of course, there
â¢were the usual number of merchant
men, but they were somewhat remote
from the man-of-war anchorage. "We
are under the impression that the Ger
man and French war vessels had left
the harbor as reported in the press dis
patches. If this was the case (and we
believe it to be correct), the only other
war vessel near the Maine was the
Spanish man-of-war Alfonso- XII.
"She probably lay near the Maine, a
little further inside the harbor, for re
ports we received some time ago said
that the Alfonso had saluted the Maine
as she passed Into the harbor. The ves
sels were, of course, some distance
apart, for the harbor regulations pre-
Foribe a certain distance, so that other
vessels may have easy ingress and
<*gTess, but as far as we know, in the
absence of fuller advices, the Alfonso
was the only war vessel near the Maine
at the time of the explosion. You must
n>->t infer from my statement, that we
suspect the Spanish vessel.
"It will be impossible to determine
the cause of the explosion until an ex
amination has been made by divers.
T hÂ° people are naturally excitable, and
because the Maine was in Spanish wa
ins, they suspect some Spanish devil
Â»ry. It goes without saying that Presi
dent McKinley and his Cabinet sincerely
hope that the court of Inquiry, soon to
bo held, will establish the fact that the
explosion was due to- an accident."
Where will the court be held?"
'That is not fully determined, but it
will probably be In Key "West or in
Havana. It may be considered advisa
h!p to hold it In Havana, so that the
members of the court will hare greater
facility in making a thorough investi
gation at the port where the Maine
nnw- lies. Our understanding: is that
the vessel Is entirely submerged. She
drew twenty-two feet and sank In
thirty-six feet of â¢water.**
"What is your own opinion of the
cause of the explosion?**
"You can guess as well as I can. and
one guess is as good as another. Noth
ing â¢will be known until a thorough In
vestigation is made,"
"Do you think that the explosion
could have resulted from spontaneous
combustion?"
"Possibly. "While the magazines con
tained brown powder chiefly, which is
incapable of combustion, there was
FomÂ« gun cotton aboard. This was
kept wet constantly, for the very pur
pose of preventing combustion."
' What do you think of the theory
that the powder was Ignited from com
bustion in the coal bunkers?"
"That is possible also, for the coal
bunkers surrounded the magazine. A
fire started on the New York from this
cause and a British man-of-war was
blown up at Punta Arena In the Straits
of Magellan from combustion in the
coal bunkers. A fire was started in the
United States ship Atlanta from the
combustion of fresh paint. It is idle
to speculate about the cause of the
Maine's explosion until a thorough ex
amination is made by divers and the
result of the court of Inquiry is made
known."
"Do you think It possible that any
part of the Maine's machinery or equip
ment can be saved?"
"I think it very probable At least
we are going to save all we can and
have already made arrangements- for a
wrecking vessel."
Chief Naval Constructor Hichborn
said: "It seems difficult to account for
the disaster except upon the theory of
outside contact. The Maine was lying
quietly at anchor, under perfect dis
cipline and double watch. She has
been in commission several years and
little or no trouble was ever experi
enced with any of her appliances. The
constant surveillance under which all
her compartments and quarters are
kept would seem to preclude the possi
bility of trouble from the inside.
Bear-Admiral Erben's View.
XEW YORK. Feb. 16.â Rear -Admiral
Erben. U. S. N., retired, said to-day
that he was inclined to believe that the
Maine was blown up by her own maga
zine. Such things had happened be
fore. Captain A. T. Mahan said that
in the absence of authentic information
he was unwilling to discuss the matter
in any light.
WE MUST KEEP COOL.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â General Daniel E. Sickles, former United
States Minister to Spain, in his residence gave his opinion
in regard to the disaster to the Maine: "Assuming that the ex
plosion occurred at the bow of the ship, I should say that the natural
inference is that it was due to outside contact. There is usually no
magazine in that part of a war ship, it being devoted to quarters for
ship's crew or for storage purposes. To my mind spontaneous com
bustion did not cause the explosion. That would not have been suffi
cient to have produced the damage.
"I can scarcely believe that it was due to a magazine explosion, for
all magazines are carefully watched and no person is allowed to enter
them without authority from an officer. Now almost every officer has
been saved and it can be ascertained very easily whether any person
had been in the magazines. This disaster, coming after the De Lome
incident, while feelings are aroused, and happening at about 10 o'clock
at night, when most of the men on the Maine were in bed, certainly
gives rise to a natural suspicion, but Judgment must be withheld until
the facts are all learned. We should keep cool."
CONJECTURES OF
NATAL OFFICERS
Various Theories to Ac
count for the Maine
Disaster.
Rear -Admiral Kirkland Not
Yet Ready to Hazard an
Opinion.
Say* the Cause of thÂ« Catastrophe
Will Be Known When Divers
Examine the Hull.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
VALLEJO. Feb. 16.â Admiral Kirk
land, Captain Glass, Captain Kempff
and all officers at the navy-yard have
expressed their utmost regret for the
terrible misfortune that has befallen
the officers and crew of the Maine.
They are at a loss to find a reasonable
solution for the accident that has be
fallen one of the finest warships in the
navy. No dispatch of any kind reach
ed the navy-yard to-day from head
quarters at Washington.
"I cannot express an opinion as to
the cause of the disaster until I know
something more definite," said Admiral
Beardslee. "The truth of the matter
will probably not be ascertained until
the divers get at work. Then it will be
easy to determine whether or not the
explosion occurred on board. If the
ship's plates in the main hull are
blown out it follows that the explosion
occurred on board; but should the
plates be bent inward, then it must
have come from the outside."
Captain Henry Glass said: "While of
course I can only conjecture the cause
of the disaster, it may have been
caused by spontaneous combustion in
the coal bunkers adjacent to the maga
zine. These warships use bituminous
coal, which is very dangerous. A leak
from the fireroom might have occasion
ed the explosion. Just such an accident
was narrowly averted on board the
cruiser Cincinnati in the harbor of Key
West two years ago. A fire broke out
in the coal bunkers from spontaneous
combustion, and the steel bulkhead be
tween the bunkers and the magazine
became red hot before it was discover
ed. Fortunately there was not enough
air to admit of a free blaze, and when
a thin stream of smoke was seen issu
ing from the magazine head the fire
was detected and both magazine and
bunkers were promptly flooded. When
the ammunition was removed from the
magazine the heads of many of the
shells were found to have been charred,
and it was a miracle that the ship was
not blown to pieces."
Naval Constructor William Baxter,
upon learning that nothing defi
nite was known as to the cause of
the disaster, declined to express a de
cided opinion. He said, however:
"The loss of the Maine leaves the At
lantic ooast only three battle-ships,
and in the event of war being declared
with Spain I suppose the Philadelphia.
Charleston and Yorktown, now lying
at the navy-yard here, would be order
ed to the Atlantic as there is no Span
ish cruiser on this coast, and all action
would be confined to the Eastern
When asked as to whether or not the
United States was in a condition to en
ter upon such a war, he said:
"That is a very serious question. In
the first place, there is a shortage of
powder, and the manufacture of such
powder as is used in the big guns of
our modern navy is a difficult under
taking, for after a quantity of powder
has been made it sometimes happens
that it will not stand the required tes-t
and has to be destroyed. Still as our
fleet is very small, comparatively
speaking, the "mills could supply enough
for our ships by doubling their ca
pacity for a few months."
Naval Constructor Baxter said it was
a very Berious blow to this country,
whether the loss of the ship was
through accident or otherwise. Such a
thing as sinking a ship with a torpedo
while in a friendly port was unheard of.
he said. It was not plausible that the
Maine was sunk by Spanish orders or
directions. If done at all by outsiders,
it must have been on their own respon
sibility, but the Spanish Government
would be responsible for it. The Ha
vana authorities were supposed to see
that such things were not possible.
All of the naval officials point to the
fact that on board a man-of-war the
powder magazine is one of the most
guarded parts, and that it would be
an almost utter impossibility for one
to obtain keys to the magazine hatches.
Gunner Cronin, attached to the re
ceiving ship Independence, n*o has had
much experience with high explosives,
expresses the opinion that only a fa
natic would have caused the explosion
by igniting the powder magazine, and
sacrificing his own life with those of
; his victims. In his opinion, it is pos
i sible the explosion may have been
caused by decomposed gun-cotton. All
ships carry a certain quantity for use
in boat torpedoes, and it has to be
! carefully watched for fear of its decom-
THE SAIS" FBANCISCO CALL, THTTKSPAY, FEBRUAKY 17, 1898.
REAR-ADMIRAL BELKNAP
FEARFUL OF TREACHERY.
BOSTON. Feb. 16.â "The tearing
away of the bow indicates torpedo
work. I had not seen that before,"
remarked Rear Admiral Belknap,
looking up from the last extra con
taining the latest information of
the terrible disaster in Havana
harbor, to The Call man. The
admiral was intensely Interested.
"You see that the explosion of the
magazine alone would open the
ship apart and sink her, but the
tearing away of the bow looks more
like a torpedo. I hardly think the
bay of Havana can be a sea of
â unken torpedoes though, for you
â cc their own ships are constantly
going in and out of the harbor, and
they would menace their safety.
When I read the first accounts of
this terrible affair I was Inclined to
think this was a matter which
would Involve the Spaniards and
oblige us to send our fleet over, but
after reading it through I do not
think so."
"There is the possibility of acci
dent, but hardly the probability on
a United States ship, is there, ad
miral?" he was asked.
"Oh, you never can tell," was his
reply. "I do not know the situation
upon the Maine. Ido not know
Just how her magazines were lo
cated, but I do know that on the
New York we were obliged to make
some changes in the magazines be
cause of the constant heat and
their getting too hot. It may have
been so on the Maine. In 1873 the
British sloop of war Dotterel was
blown up at Sandy Point, in the
Straits of Magellan. The explosion
in that case took place in the bow
and was quite as mysterous as
this, until it was found, upon In
vestigation, that the affair appear
ed to have started from the paint
room. The British navy was at
that time using a peculiar kind of
paint, which was found to give off
a gas that was highly inflammable.
A man had gone into that room
with a light and instantly there was
an explosion, followed by the blow
ing up of the ship.
"Are not the magazines directly
under the turrets as a rule? They
are in the Massachusetts and In
diana."
"Yes," said the admiral. "But
this was a different class of ship."
"You are not inclined to assume
treachery on the part of the Span
iards until you have exhausted the
possibilities of accident, are you,
admiral?"
"Why, no," he said. "The dispo
sition they manifested is against
that. You note how promptly they
lowered their boats and how in
tent they manifestly were upon res
cue. They came Instantly to the
relief of our men, indicating a gen
erosity and the best of feeling. I
should be Inclined to consider it
accidental were it not for that
statement as to the bow. which I
had not seen before. But I am
not ready to say now that it may
not be proved to have been of ac
cidental origin. We must know
more about it. It will be neces
sary to have a diver before we de
termine the probable cause. I pre
sume they will make such an ex
amination as a basis upon which
to start their investigation, and
the Spanish authorities will be
quite as much interested to have
that done as we are. The diverts
report will give the facts as they
are found to exist. I know of no
disaster to the American navy since
the war so awful as this in its de
struction of life. There have been
other ships lost with their entire
companies, and nobody ever knew
how. There was the sloop-of-war
which causes a chemical re
action, when it is liable to explode.
In the opinion of Captain Glass, Cap
tain Sigsbee displayed excellent judg
ment in the wording of his dispatch to
Washington to suspend opinion until
a full report was received. Captain
Glass says Sigsbee is a very careful
officer, and without doubt had used ev
ery precaution to- guard against dan
ger in the magazine.
STRANGE WORDS OF A
MAN FROM KEY WEST.
Claim 6to Have Been Told That the
Battle - Ship Maine Was
Doomed.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â After the ar
rival of the Mallory line steamship
Lampasas to-day tho passengers were
aroused by certain statements made by
a fellow-traveler, whose name is givon
as Mr. Pemblington, in connection with
the blowing up of the Maine. When
the news of the disaster was given
Pemblington is alleged to have thrown
up his arms and exclaimed:
"My God, why did I not telegraph to
Washington what I heard in Key
West'"
The man then said, according to re
ports current later, that he had been
informed by the Spanish Consul at
Key West that if the Elaine stayed a
week longer in Havana Harbor she
might be blown up.
One of the officers to-night said:
"Yes, it is true that there was a pas
senger .named Pemblington who mada
several statements upon our arrival
here which caused excitement among
the passengers. The story comes to me
through other persons. He is said to
have bewailed the fact that he had not
sent information to Washington In re
gard to what he heard in Havana and
Key West. I do not know whether he
said that he had been Informed by the
Spanish Consul at Key West that if
the Maine remained a week longer In
Havana Harbor she would be blown
up; but I was told that he did say that
there were torpedoes in the harbor and

for Washington in the afternoon, so I
was told."

Albany, which sailed from Grey
town, Nicaragua, for Pensacola,
and to this day nobody knows what
was her fate or that of any of her
officers or crew. I think that was
in IS6O. She was always consid
ered a dangerous vessel because
she was so cranky. Then there
was the Levant, a fine ship. She
sailed from Honolulu for San Fran
cisco and was never more heard
from. I always thought she might
have bef-n struck by lightning and
that the flash set fire to her maga
zine which, blowing up in conse
quence, destroyed the ship and all
on board.
"Our palntrooms are usually in the
bow, but in all ships upon which I
have had experience we always
carried the turpentine on deck.
Then there are the electric wires.
Your modern cruiser is full of them.
Still, I should hardly suppose there
would be any "Metric wire allowed
to pass through the magazine. If,
as you state, th^re were two explo
sions, then the first was undoubt

the rest. It would look as if the
first explosion was in the shellroom,
and that it started the forward

ing away of the bow.
"This dispatch says the entire
bo-w was blown off. If that is the
case, it certainly does give the mat
ter a peculiar look. If the explosion
had been around the boiler or in
the flreroom. then you might as
sume that somebody had introduced
some explosive into the coal, but it
did not. It was the magazine.
"The tearing away of the entire
bow would be caused by the explo
sion of a torpedo Immediately be

saw by one account that they were
handling high explosives on board

ships.
ATTRIBUTES IT
TO TREACHERY
Commander Montgomery
Believes War Will
Follow.
Ridicules the Theory That Ac
cident Caused the Dis
aster.
Confident That Divers Will Find the
Sunken Maine's Armor Bent
Inward.
Special Dlipatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 16. â Commander J.
E. Montgomery, once of the United
States navy, a commanding officer of a
Confederate fleet during the civil war
and the man who raised the frigate
(afterward the ram) Merrimac, was
very emphatic to-day in declaring the
sinking of the Maine to have been the
result of treachery and an act without
parallel in the world's history. In his
opinion war must inevitably follow.
"When the divers go down and ex
amine the hull of the vessel," said
Commander Montgomery, "it will be
found that it was stove in by a torpedo
exploded under the bow with diabolical
intent. To be sure an accident may
occur on shipboard; a magazine or a
battery may explode. But consider all
the circumstances and you will not en
tertain the theory of an accident. In
the history of our navy there never has
been such an accident. Why should
the first one occur in so perfectly
equipped a vessel aa the Maine, and
"We have never carried turpen
tine and oils of that nature below
since the burning of the old Mis
souri away back in 1843. She was
on her maiden trip and took fire
from an explosion in the paintroom.
The Missouri was a sister ship to
the old Mississippi â yes, the same
which rendered such service in the
Civil War. I think that the Gov
ernment got more work out of the
Mississippi than from any other
ship in the navy, unless it was the
Powhattan.
"The worst disaster that ever be
fell our navy prior to this since the
war was the loss of the Vandalla,
Trenton and Nipsic in the fearful
hurricane at Apia in March, 1889.
I never shall forget it. I had just
left Captain Schoonmaker to come
away, and <m the arrival of our
nt earner the first news I received was
<r)t the loss of the three ships and
the death of poor Schoonmaker.
That was a heavy loss to the Amer
ican navy. That was a hurricane
which actually stripped the clothes
off of men who were caught out in
it.
"Yes. I know Sigsbee. He was in
the hydrographic service after my
own connection with deep-sea
soundings. He is a bright officer.
I am very sorry, indeed, to hear
such news as this from Havana
and the loss of so fine a ship as the
Maine, but we must have all the
facts before we form an opinion. It
does not seem, however, to call for
the visit of the fleet on these first
statements. The Government will
undoubtedly send another ship at
once."
Speaking of the contents of the
Maine's magazines. Admiral Bel
knap said they were carrying high
explosives now on board the mod
ern ships, and there was nothing
yet to show what the ship might
have had. When told that one
story stated that the ship's cook
said there was gun-cotton in the
magazine, the Admiral said: "I
â¢wouldn't carry gun-cotton on any
ship with which I had anything to
do."
under so capable a commanding officer
as Sigsbee?
"Why should It occur in Havana har
bor, where the vessel was at the mercy
of an enemy capable of treachery, as
we know the Spaniard is and has been
as lon# as he has figured in history?
Why should it follow so closely the
recent exposure of the Spanish Minister
to the United States as a despicable
time-server, who wore an affable de
meanor in Washington while giving
vent to his hatred of our chief execu
tive and our people in private letters
to compatriots? The combination of
acts is too strong to leave a doubt. I
miss my guess if retribution will not
be felt."
Commander Montgomery is familiar
with Havana harbor. It would be com
paratively easy, he says, with small
boats or otherwise to set a torpedo to
destroy the American vessel. This is
his theory of how the Maine was
wrecked.
HAS LITTLE FAITH
IN SPANISH HONOR.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â An evening
paper quotes Horatio S. Rubens, coun
sel for the Cuban Junta in this city, as
saying:
"Taking everything into considera
tion, I am firmly convinced that the
tragedy in Havana Harbor was the
work of the Spaniards. I do. not be
lieve, as has been suggested, that it
was the result of an explosion of gun
cotton. Too many of our boats have
been in that climate and such an acci
dent never occurred to any of them.
"It is well known that there has been
a very bitter feeling among the Span
iards in Cuba against the Maine. Ca
nalejas' own paper, the Heraldo. has
repeatedly stated that the presence of
the Maine was a menace to peace, and
it was to the same editor of this paper,
it will be remembered, that De Lome
wrote his famous letter. If any Span
lards did it they certainly acted in con
nivance with the Spanish authorities,
for otherwise they could not have got
together sufficient explosives. I feel
certain it was not the work of Cubans,
because if they wanted to blow any
tnlng up they would have directed their
force toward Spanish vessels or that
beast, Weyler, long before this."
CUBANS SAY IT
WAS FOUL PLAY
Dr. Castillo Attributes th e
Catastrophe to
Treachery.
Members of the Junta Suspect
Rabid Spaniards at
Havana.
Belief That the Anti- American Spirit
Prompted Them to Destroy
the Maine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â Dr. Joaquln
D. Castillo, Cuban sub-delegate, who
was formerly a surgeon in the United
States navy, speaking of the disaster to
the United States ship Maine, said:
"This is such a serious affair It is
hard for me to believe it was not acci
dental, yet I am forced to suspect
treachery. On reading early reports of
this sad event I was inclined to think
the explanation was not the outcome
of a plot on the part of Spaniards to
destroy the American man-of-war, but
rather the result of spontaneous com
bustion of gun cotton on board the
Maine. As more detailed accounts of
the occurrence become known, how
ever, the opinion which I had formed
at the first moment was altered. I be
gin to suspect that there was some foul
play."
Horatio S. Rubens, counsel for the
Cuban Junta, expressed himself freely.
He said: "I do not believe the blowing
up of the Maine was an accident. I
am of the opinion that the explosion
was the result of outside work, and I
am led to this conclusion from the con
servative character of Captain Sigs
bee's telegram. If Captain Sigsbee be
lieved that the explosion was accident
al he would say so instead of wiring to
send no warship and asking Ameri
cans to reserve their decision."
Benjamin G. Guerra, treasurer of the
Cuban Junta, said: "I believe the blow
ing up of the Maine was the deliberate
work of some rabid Spaniards. While
the Spanish Government may not be
directly concerned in the plot, I think
an investigation of the affair will show
that some anti-American officials were
at the bottom of the scheme to destroy
the American battle-ship. I remember
during the ten years' war in Cuba the
case of the Virginius. When the sur
render of the vessel to the American
Government was ordered Dr. Gallardo,
a rabid Spaniard, a professor in the
Havana University, made an attempt
to blow up the vessel before she was
delivered to the American warship that
was sent to bring her to the United
States."

AN ADVANTAGE
Loss of the Maine a Se

Navy.

Secretary Long Holds a Consultation
With Experts of His De
partment.
Special Dispatch to X he Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 16.
Both Secretary Long and Assistant
Secretary Roosevelt called a consulta
tion in the forenoon of all of the chiefs
of the Navy Department and several of
the officers of high rank indirectly at
tached, like Commodore Schley, presi
dent of the Lighthouse Board, who has
a brilliant reputation as a gallant offi
cer and is possessed of great discre
tion. The purpose of this consultation
was to obtain the best expert testimony
as to the probable cause of the Maine
disaster, while at the same time ascer
taining to what extent the naval situ
ation had been affected by the loss of
the Maine.
A good deal of disquiet was exhibited
when it was shown that the loss of the
fine battleship had done a great deal
to destroy the balance of power theor
etically between the navies of Spain
and the United States, the American
navy being reduced to six serviceable
vessels against seven on the Spanish
fleet.
Every confidence was felt in the de
partment in the commander of the
Maine. Captain Sigsbee, and until it is
really established otherwise there is
every disposition to charge the acci
dent, if accident it was, that destroyed
the Maine, to some cause beyond the
usual range of human discretion.
The coast survey steamer Bache is
now lying at Key West. The superin
tendent of the survey lost no time this
morning in inviting Secretary Long to
make any use of the vessel in this
emergency that he might desire. The
invitation was gratefully accepted, and
the Bache has been ordered to proceed
at once to Havana with wrecking
paraphernalia.
De Lome Incident Closed.
MADRID, Feb. 16.âEl Cnrreo, the of
ficial organ, announces that United
States Minister Woodford to-night re
ceived Spain's reply concerning the De
Lome letter, and it adds that the inci
dent is regarded as terminated.

PUT UP OR SHUT UP.
AS independent as the proverbial hog on ice is
the yellow faker of Mission street: when it
cannot stand up it can fall down on itself and
slide in its own grease. It has taken the latter course
in the face of the demand of The Call that it should
either prove the truth of its denial that John R. Grif
fiths was at Agnews at the time Peter Camarinos died
or acknowledge the error. Finding itself in a slip
pery place it has fallen down, and loudly claims to
be sliding on its own slipperiness and not on that of
the location.
Since the Examiner has fallen down we have no
desire to pursue the subject further. When we
brought the issue before the public and offered to de
posit with Mayor Phelan $1000 to be divided among
the charitable institutions of the city if the Examiner
could show that the denial it made of the story pub
lished in The Call was well founded, we had no other
object than that of impressing upon the public mind
the accuracy of the reports in The Call and the false
ness to which the yellow journal resorts to discredit
news which it is too slow to get. That object has
been accomplished. The Examiner yesterday refused
to stand by its former words, but announced in
screaming type that if some other issue of its own
selection be taken up it would meet The Call half
*ay.
We challenged the Examiner to maintain the truth
of a statement made in its columns and stated the
challenge in the straight Saxon words, "Put up op
shut up." The Examiner has done neither. The hog
on ice, whether he stands or falls, can always squeal,
and this particular stuck pig squeals wildly. We have
no desire to inflict the squealing upon the public any
further, and therefore resist the temptation to kick
the sprawling nuisance and provoke it to further
noise. We simply profit by the opportunity to brand
the thing once more as a public liar, and so pass on
to other things until a new offense from the jealous
faker calls for new redress and new exposure.
In the meantime our original challenge stands.
OVERWORKING THE CHILDREN.
\A ANY parents are approaching the conclusion
/ \ that their children are forced to do an un
reasonable amount of work in the public
schools. A few years ago a child of 12 or 13 ad
vanced to about the stage of the seventh grade of to
day would be under no necessity of studying at home
in the evening, or at least but rarely. Now, to keep
up with the prescribed course the child must study
often as much as two hours in the evening. There
is something wrong with the system which exacts
this. A child has a right to leisure for recreation or
for the pursuit of some branch, French, German or
music, not in the curriculum. Many children com
plain of trouble with their eyes, and naturally
enough. If they pore over books during a large part
of the time they are at school, and must devote their
evenings to the active pursuit of the same industry,
not only their eyes, but their bodies are being sub
jected to undue strain. A little girl of 11 recently re
marked that she had twenty-seven examples to work
out one evening. She had complained to her
teacher, who had cheered her with the information
that if she would give two hours' faithful application
to them she ought to be able to work them all.
Possibly this was true. But there is no justice in
the demand that any girl of II after a day in school
shall give two hours of faithful application to any
form of knowledge concealed between the covers of
a text-book.
The public would like to know more about the
transaction by which a fender was adopted. There
has been a suspicion that no device would be ap
proved without being sustained commercially and its
good points emphasized by gold trimmings. It is
only fair to the Supervisors to say this suspicion is
still harbored, and to clear it away ought to be re
garded by them as a duty and a pleasure.
It is stated that Peary stands in the foremost rank
of Arctic explorers. He does more than this; he is
the foremost rank. No other brave pioneer has the
distinction of being the father of an all-white baby
born quite so far north, and no other has monkeyed
around tke exclusive Arctic circle so extensively
without having discovered something.
While the police announce with pleasing faith that
there are no confidence men left in the city, no citi
zen in whom the bump of credulity is not abnormally
developed will take his hand off his pocketbook while
in a crowd.
Supervisors will not be much concerned over any
thing the Grand Jury may say about them. They are
not noted for delicacy of feeling. Nothing short of
â¢o ; Â«uiictjaient will ever cause them uneasiness.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1898.
THE THREE SILVER MANIFESTOES.
THE Bryan Democracy, Populists and free silver
Republicans have sat upon and incubated a
triune manifesto to their followers, summoning
them to fusion on free coinage of silver at 16 to I.
This document, so abundantly fathered, impeaches
the administration for maintaining the gold standard
and making the lives of the people "bitter with a
hard bondage." This is also an impeachment of
Andrew Jackson, who said in 1836 that "gold is the
universal and only honest standard of value." But
Jackson is dead and cannot defend himself, even
against the attempt to identify him with fiatism.
The address, continuing, says: "The continued
rise in value of goldâ or, which is the same thing,
the continued fall in prices â must inevitably transfer
the property of all those engaged in active business,
the actual creators of wealth, whether b: hand, brain
or capital, to those who, avoiding the risk and effort
of active business, only draw interest."
The address fails to state what these wicked men
will do then, when they have destroyed their capacity
to draw interest by destroying the power to pay it.
The farmers of Mr. Bryan's State paid off $26,000,
000 of mortgages in 1897, and Kansas proposes to
exhibit at the Omaha fair a full carload of mortgages
paid off last year.
When Mr. Bryan was in Congress, in his speech on
the Wilson bill, in reply to the claim that protection
wisely distributed lowered instead of raising prices to
the consumer, he said that the general fall in prices was
due entirely to increase in production by labor-saving
inventions. Now he sees a new light and lays low
prices to the gold standard.
It needs no argument to prove that if the so-called
demonetizing of silver in 1873 made prices fall, inde
pendent of supply and demand, of production and
consumption, the fall would haye been immediate,
sudden and final. It would have affected not a few
but all values.
The fact is that silver has been more coined and
more used in effecting the world's commercial ex
changes since 1873 than before. Of the specie used in
moving the foreign trade of the United States. Great
Britain, France and British India for the four years
ending in 1864 the proportion of silver was 40 per
cent; for the four years ending 1800 it was 45 per
cent.
Mr. David A. Wells says: "It would seem that if
the scarcity of gold on prices had originated and
operated as the advocates of this theory claim, such
influence would have been all pervasive, synchronous,
irresistible and constant as the influence of gravita
tion, and that something of correspondence, as re
spects time and degree, in the resulting price move
ments of commodities would have been recognized."
Saurbeck's tables, dealing with forty-five articles,
show an average fall in price, but they do not show
a universal fall for all articles, nor a uniform fall for
such as have fallen. Pork fell 4 points and cotton 49;
beef 19 and petroleum 68; oats 28 and wheat 52; tin
i>) and iron 49; coffee rose 23 points. The investiga
tions made by a sub-committee of the Finance Com
mittee of the United States Senate in 1892 traced the
price fluctuations of 223 articles since iB6O and
allowed the same lack of uniformity. Fifteen articles
of house furnishings fell 30 points; thirty-five articles
of lumber and building materials rose 22 points;
metals and implements fell 26 points; food rose 3
points: wages rose 60 points. Between 1880 and IS9O
farm lands rose from $18 99 per acre to $21 31, Tve
stock per head -from $13 03 to $14 63, the average
wages of factory laborers from $346 to $484 per an
num, and of tearhers from $195 to $251.
In economics a tl'cory is not good unless it ac
counts for all cases to which it is applied. Those
who say that the gold standard has made low wheat
must explain why it has not made low beef, wages,
veal, butter, eggs and milk.
In fine, the theory of these three manifestoes is a
fallacy. Its statement of the motive of the advocates
of the gold standard is an appeal to prejudice and a
demagogic folly. The persons who own the money
in the loan fund of the country and get interest on it
arc very largely the working people and widows,
orphans and estate?, for whom the savings banks and
trust companies act as trustees.
PUSHING THE INVESTIGATION.
r^vEPRESENTATIVE IIILBORN has intro
|â/ duced into the Plouse a resolution directing the
Committee on Military Affairs to make an in
vestigation of the recent discovery that defective
shrapnel has been furnished to the army by private
contractors. The issue is thus brought fairly before
Congress and it is to be hoped no favor for the guilty
parties nor the pressure of the business of the session
will cause the committee to hesitate in taking up the
matter while all the circumstances are still fresh in
the public mind and popular interest in the subject is
keen and strong.
In the first reports of the affair it was stated that
the defective shrapnel discovered by the tests at the
Presidio was furnished by the American Ordnance
Company. To our special correspondent at Wash
ington, however, it was stated by an officer of that
company that the ammunition did not come from his
company, but from the Hotchkiss Company before
the consolidation.
It appears the American Ordnance Company is
something in the nature of a trust and represents a
consolidation of several of the largest corporations
engaged in that business in the country. It would of
course be unjust to hold the entire combination re
sponsible for defective ammunition furnished by one
of its members before the consolidation took place,
but nevertheless it will not be overlooked that the
combination was probably formed to make better
profits out of the Government, and doubtless re
ceived a share of the gains made out of the defective
ammunition in question.
Mr. Hilborn is quoted by our correspondent as
saying the Government should as far as practicable
manufacture its war material, as there would then be
no temptation to furnish unserviceable ammunition.
The cost to the Government would perhaps be more,
but it would be better to stand that than to run the
risk of having to face a war with our troops and navy
so poorly supplied that they would be sent to slaugh
ter rather than to battle.
Against this reasoning there is nothing to be
urged. If we cannot obtain good ammunition from
private contractors the Government should by all
means set up a manufacturing plant of its own. It
ir, by no means certain, however, that we cannot find
contractors who will furnish good ammunition. Our
manufacturers are quite capable of producing as good
war material as any in the world, and if the proper
inducements are held out by the Government they
will furnish us with military and naval supplies of un
questioned quality.
One of these inducements should be fair prices for
the goods, and another should be prompt punishment
for supplying the army or navy with defective goods.
We have for a long time held out the first of these,
and the frauds discovered in the shrapnel at the
Presidio afford a good opportunity for trying the
other. The Military Committee of the House should

ZOLA'S denant championship of Dreyfus, so far
from helping him, has acted upon the excita
ble Parisian populace like a red banner waved
in the face of an angry bull. It has aroused passion 3
that have carried old animosities to the verge of
reasonless rage, and at the present time the outcome
of the trial is as likely to be a riot as anything else.
It must not be supposed, however, that the stormy
mobs of Paris represent the public opinion of
France. Excitement in one form or another is the
normal condition of life among a large portion of
the population of Paris, and France is too much ac
customed to their extravagances to be seriously dis
turbed by them. Almost every political crisis causes
a violent uproar along the boulevards, but it is sel
dom that anything more than noise and a few duels
emanate from the confusion that seems about to
hurry the republic into chaos and old night.
The most serious feature of the present situation is
the fact that within a short time the Deputies are to
meet their constituents. The Government is thus
compelled to some extent to comply with the will of
the leaders of the excitement for fear of their in
fluence over the rabble on election day. The loss of
a comparatively few seats in the Chamber of Depu
ties would mean the overthrow of the present Minis
try, and the Government dares not take the risk of
too strongly opposing the sentiment of a class which,
however small it may be in comparison with the
whole voting population, is nevertheless active, vig
orous and aggressive enough to be a dangerous foe.
The men who are making the most violent de
monstrations against Zola and Dreyfus are known to
be opposed to the present constitution of France.
They are divided into two parties which on all other
issues are in violent antagonism to one another, one
faction being socialists and the other monarchists,
but for this fight they have combined, each being
willing to help the other tear down the Government
and take chances as to which will be able to seize the
spoils after the common victory.
The campaign cry by which the combined factions
have succeeded in exciting the Parisian populace is
"The honor of the army." The people are told that
Zola has insulted the arms of France for the purpose
of defending a traitor. It is for this he is howled a*
on the streets and threatened with violence as hie
goes and returns to and from the court. The same
cry will be sounded during the campaign throughont
France when the elections take place, and it will go
hard with the Ministry if the opposition can fasten
upon it the suspicion that it is lacking in loyalty to
the army of the nation.
The outlook is grave beyond a doubt, but the re
public has met and weathered many a fiercer storm
than this. The Boulanger movement was more dan
gerous because it had a leader who was a popular
favorite, and in whom large numbers of people be
lieved they saw a new Napoleon who would redeem
Alsace and Lorraine from the Germans and restori?
the prestige and glory of the arms of France.
The present movement has no leader. The pas
sionate regard for the army shown in the excitement
that attends the trial of Zola is ample proof that if
a military leader of commanding eminence werd
forthcoming the republic would be in extreme dan
ger, but there is no young Napoleon in sight. The
opportunity is present, but the man is absent. The
chances, therefore, are that the present excitemenJ
will never spread beyond the boulevards of Paris, and
that when the elections take place a sure and safe
majority of conservative republicans will be electe.*
to maintain the present constitution for another long
term of years.
A committee has been endeavoring to ascertain
whether the poor people of New York City buy the
proper sort of food. There is nothing surprising in
the conclusion reached that the poor people are
"guilty. They do not buy the proper material. They
sometimes invest their money when hungry in some
thing which lacks the nutritive properties of some
thing else. They have even been known to neglect
to purchase food of any kind, and the fact that they
have starved to death upon persistently manifesting
an obstinacy so reprehensible shows that nature will
not tolerate any foolishness.
Perhaps a statement made in the New York World
and copied in The Call had not dawned in all its
beauty upon the hurried editor who used it. The
World had written of some men whom it described as
mortally wounded, adding the information that part of
the number would be likely to die. Men with morrnl
wounds are viewed by students of warfare as having
their chances of longevity seriously impaired.
The burglars who keep right on about their regu
lar business must have overlooked Captain Bohen's
confident and cheering view of the matter. Accord
ing to the captain all such characters have been run
out of town. Would it not be wise to detail a good
man to call upon these burglars and inform them not
only that their conduct is annoying, but is taking all
the beauty out of Bohen's story?
"Notwithstanding the vigilance of the police the
games thrive." So reads a news account telling of
places in which pools are sold to women. It is an in
teresting account, but at one point the writer evi
dently felt an impulse to be facetious. To mention
as "vigilance" that attitude which permits the game
was clearly intended as a joke.
If General Clay shall get the divorce he seeks
perhaps the country may be cheered by noting his
absence from the public press. However, the issu.
ance of a burial permit to the general would be even
more pleasing, and carry with it a more perfect assur
ance of peace.
Another man while hunting has fatally shot a
friend. There needs to be a closed season for friends,
and until it shall be provided the man who does not
know one end of a gun from another should be
forced to do his hunting in solitude.
There will be a shade of doubt in relation to the
death of the Gilroy man who is said to have tried to
cut of? his own head with an ax. An ax is not looked
upon by the practical suicide as a weapon suitable to
the emergency.
Foreign papers say that Zola, even if acquitted,
could not live in France. They do not go to the
trouble to state any reason why he should desire to
live there. The world is wide and portions of it are
sane.
Ex-Governor St. John of Kansas is in trouble for

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
One of the stars of the Damrosch-Ellis
opera company at the Metropolitan
Opera-house this season is Mile. Toronta,
a youthful graduate of Mme. Marchesi's
school. It is almost needless to say that
Mile. Toronta is a Canadian and hails
from Toronto. When Lamperti suggested
to a gifted young American soprano that
she should name herself Albani, after her
native town of Albany, he set a fashion
whtch Is growing more and more popular.
Melba has given an added glory to Mel
bourne, Fanny Franqesca is carrying the
fame of San Francisco abroad, and Mile.
Toronta, in winning laurels for herself,
is incidentally earning fame for Toronto.
There is no knowing where the mania
may end. The twentieth century may see
every town and hamlet with its name
prima donna. To avoid injustice the as
piring singer ought first to warble to the
community, and be publicly Indorsed be- I
fore being allowed to wear a city's name;
otherwise we might see Mile. Oaklanda
or Mile. Los Angela making a complete
MLLE, TORONTA, the New Canadian Prima Donna.
fiasco, whereas Mile. Petaiuma and Mile. 'â¢
Milpeta might be winning world-wide ;
fame. Mile. Toronta is a very gifted â 
young woman, and, although only In the '
very beginning of her career, has already
taken her place In the front rank of
prima donnas.
There was a time when London was ac
cused of being an unmusical city, but,
judging from the Postal Annual, It has
now gone to the other extreme. The Pos
tal Annual gives the addresses of 5500
professors of piano, singing, guitar, etc.
The population of London is at present
about five millions, so that the city counts
a professor of music for each 1000 inhabi
tants. The proportion is in reality still
more startling, for one must deduct the
inhabitants who are too young or too old
to figure in the list of students, as well
as the poor who have no money to spend
on musical Instruction. In reality the
proportion is about one professor for each
200 inhabitants. It mu9t be remembered,
too, that the list of professors does not
count many women teachers who are too
modestly lodged for the Annual to take
cognizance of them. If with all these
teachers London does not become the
most musical city in the world it will not
be for want of technical Instruction.
Thlslsthe history In brief of Mile. Agnele
Herautâ La Petite Heraut â the newest
vaudeville star in Paris: She studied
singing with poor Taskin, who predicted
a brilliant operatic career for her: sud
denly a severe attack of laryngitis de
stroyed at one blow the hopes of the
master and the pupil. Most women
would have given up all hopes of the
theater In despair. "Little" Tleraut said
to herself: "What does it matter having
no voice if one's gestures are expressive,
and, above all, graceful 7" And without
waiting a day Angele Heraut began to
study pantomime. Three months later
she made her debut at the Casino de
Paris in a little act, where the public Im
mediately appreciated her ability as a
mime. New creations at the Nouveau-
Theatre and the Folies-Marigny followed,
and now "Little" Heraut has just signed
a splendid engagement with the Casino.
The courageous singer who lost her voice
has become one of the biggest vaudeville
stars in France.
Leoncavallo, the author of "I Pagliac
cl," like Bolto, the author of "Mefilsto
fele," not only writes librettos for his
own personal use. hut also furnishes his
confreres with books. Leoncavallo's lat
est libretto Is entitled "Mario Wetter,'"
It has been set to music by Augusto
Machndo and will shortly be produced at
the San Carlos Theater, Lisbon. Talk-
Ing of the San Carlos recalls the fact that
the Portuguese police still refuse to al
low that opera house to play "Andre
Chenier," because one of the acts ends
with the "Marseillaise." Every one seems
at a loss to understand this ridiculous
ostracism, for the hymn of the French
republic is publicly played even in Russia,
so one would suppose that the Portuguese
public might safely be exposed to its
seditious influence. As all song lovers
remember the "Marseillaise" also
comes in at the end of Schumann's set
ting of Heine's poem, "The Two Grena
diers," which has been sung with im
punity all over the civilized world.
A rather surprising piece of musical
news comes from the Transvaal, where
hitherto the worship of the golden calf
has been much more wide-spread than
the worship of art. A committee has
been formed at Pretoria, the capital of
the little reputfllc, with- the object of
building a concert hall and forming an
orchestra to play classical music. Dr.
Leyds, Assistant Secretary of State, is
the president of the organization. The
committee has demanded a site of the
Government in the midst of the public
park at Pretoria, and a number of music
lovers have subscribed a sum equivalent
to $51,000. Mr. Ten Brink has been com
missioned to go to Europe, especially to
England, in order to engage performers
and a good conductor. It is to be hoped
that this interesting effort of Boor ama
teurs will prove a complete success and
that in the twentieth century The Call
will be furnishing its readers with the
news of important musical happenings at
Pretoria.
German music publishers are making a
firm stand on the question of demanding
royalties for melodies reproduced me
chanically by hiuicl-cirsra-ns ajid all, Qthar
itiFtrur.ients of the kind that grind out
tunes, 4ke sausages, by the yard. The
publishers have entered a number of
test suits against the manufacturers of
these instruments, and so far the de
cisions ha>e been in their favor. The
hund-organ men fear that the "Reichs
gericht" (Ttfbunal of the Empire) is
about to maije a decision ordering them
to pay royalties. In the hope of pre
venting this they have formed an asso
ciation entitled "The League of German
Instrument Makers," and they propose
to petition the Government for a change
in existing laws, so that all mechani
cally produced â  music may be exempt
from paying royalties. It is to be hoped
that they will not carry the day, for there
seems absolutely no reason why they
should reap, without money and with
out price, the fruits of composers' labor
and genius.
At the town of Bergamo, in Italy, a
grand musical celebration was given on
the 10th inst. to commemorate the first
anniversary of the death of Bazzlni. the
famous violinist-composer. Most of the
programme was devoted to the deceased
master's works. The celebrated violon
cellist, Piatti, an intimate friend of Baz
zini, was the star performer on the oc
casion. Bazzini's chamber music has at
several concerts been received with con
siderable favor in San Francisco.
Pedro Saleza, a new Spanish tenor, has
just signed an engagement with Maurice
Grau for London and the United States.
He will sing in London during the sum
mer, and will make his debut in America
next winter. Much is expected from
Saleza, on account of his success at the
Paris Grand Opera. To some extent he
will step into Jean de Reszke's shoes, for
he is to sing with Calve, Mellja and
Prunes in "Faust," "Romeo and Juliet,"
"The Huguenots," "Aida," 'Carmen, '
etc.
Sir Arthur Sullivan has a new libret
tistâno tern a man than Arthur Pinero,
the well-known playwright of problem
play fame. It is to be hoped that the
Pinero libretto on which Sir Arthur is
now busily working contains more excit
ing material than "The Princess and the
Butterfly, the latest comedy offering
that Pinero has made this country, and
about as dull a contribution as New York
has seen in many a day.
E. J. Hopkins, the dean of English or
ganists, has just retired from the Temple
Church, London, at the age of 90. He has
been organist of the Temple Church for
fifty-four years, but his musical career
goes back to the accession of William IV
in A. D. 183(i. ..t that time Hopkins was
a choirboy in the royal chapel, and he
sang at the coronation ceremony.
Rouman!a wants to make a record in
the piano-manufacturing line. An enter
prising Bucharest manufacturer is pre
paring to send to the Paris Exposition
of 1900 a piano that can be heard ten kilo
meters away (six and two-third miles).
That will be am very well for the people
who live at the other end of town, but
what about the inhabitants of the next
flat?
News comes from Munich that the
famous tenor, Henry Yogi, is writing a
grand opera in three acts, which bears
the provisionary title of "Baldur." The
composer, who himself wrote the libret
to, went to Scandinavian mythology for
his theme. He also helped hlmsetf liber
ally to a poem by Felix Dahn on the sub
ject of the god Baldur.
Mile. Strakosch, a niece of Adelina
Patti, bids fair to repeat her aunt's suc
cesses. A dispaten from Milan announces
that in "Andrea Chenier," at the Lyric
Theater, Milan, she has had a triumphal
success, so much so that the recalls and
general enthusiasm quite surpassed any
thing that happened when the opera was
first performed at La Scala.
Newspaper writers abroad are some
times more frank than gallant, as the
following instance shows: An Italian
critic, who is known by the norn de plume
"Per l'lileale," makes tho announcement
that a popular Italian singer has innerit
ed a fortune large enough for Jier to reure
from the stage. He adds: "So much the
better for herâ and for art."

NATURALIZATION PAPERSâ F. F.,
San Mateo, Cal. While It is true that all
judicial and executive officers of the
United States Government are bound to
recognize the seal and signature of all
legally constituted courts, in the matter
of an alien or a natural-born citizen going
abroad he should provide himself with a
passport, to be obtained from the United
States Secretary of State. A naturalized
citizen should "have such in addition to
his certificate of naturalization. The cer
tificate does not require the signature of
a Federal officer if issued out of a State
court, but the applicant for a passport
must send it to the Secretary of State,
who will return it in due time with the
passport. To obtain a passport the rule
is that in addition to transmitting his
certificate, or a certified copy, for inspec
tion, he must state in his affidavit when
and from what port he emigrated to this
country, what ship he sailed in, where he
has lived since his arrival . ! n the United
States, when and before what court he
was naturalized, and that he is the iden

naturalization. The signature to "the ap
plication should conform in orthography

TO CONTEST
THE BLITHE
DECISION
Another Threatening
Suit Is Formally
Launched.
Boswell Blythe Claims
He Is Heir to the
Estate.
A Discussion of the Validity of
International Treaties
Involved.
IS FLORENCE AN ALIEN?
The Legitimacy of Her Birth Is
Brought Into Ques
tion.
A complaint was filed in the Superior
Court yesterday morning contesting
Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinckley's pos
session to the Blythe estate on the
grounds that she is of alien and ille
gitimate birth.
The latest claimant to the heirship
to the Blythe millions and the plaintiff
in the present complaint is Boswell
Blythe, son of the late James T. Blythe
and brother to Thomas H. Blythe.
The point that the attorneys of the
plaintiff will endeavor to prove is the
invalidity of the judgment granted to
Florence Blythe to the effect that she
was of alien birth and consequently
non-eligible to take possession or claim
any property in this State or country,
even though it be proven that she is the
legitimate daughter of Thomas Blythe.
She was born in England and this fact
is against her so the plaintiff in the
present complaint alleges as there is no
treaty existing between the United
States and Great Britain which pro
vides for the transfer of property of
native born or r aturalized citizens at
their death to alien heirs.
Although this agreement of nations
in favor of granting to the heirs of
relatives living in foreign countries
does not exist at present between this
country and England there is, however,
a trace of one dating as far back as
1700, but owing to the fact that since
this early period no attention has been
given toward a renewal of it the attor
neys for the present claimant aver that
Florence Blythe has no valid claim or
right to hold property in the United
States, she being at the time of the
death of Thomas Blythe a foreign-born
child, with whose country there is not
the least agreement or well-recognized
treaty.
This constitutes the main and prin
cipal Judicial technicality upon which
the present complaint is based, and is
an embodiment of sections 671 and 672
of the Civil Code. These sections of
the code are to the effect that any per
son, whether citizen or alien, may take
hold and dispose of property, real and
personal, within the State, provided
that the country within which they live
has a treaty with this country.
This, were Florence Blythe born in
any country but England, so the com
plaint states, would be sufficient guar
antee that she is entitled to the estate
as far as her birth is concerned, but be
ing an English-born subject, her claim
is necessarily null and void.
"When she knocked at the doors of
the civil courts of this State," eaid At
torney Holladay. "they had no right to
grant a Judgment in her favor, as they
knew, or should have known, that a
treaty between this country and Eng
land does not exist."
In the complaint filed yesterday, in j
addition to the fact of a non-existence
of an alien treaty between the two ;
countries â Its main and fundamental |
basis â a subordinate point of attnek
will be made in advancing an argument j
as to the illegitimacy of Florence
Blythe'fl birth.
Boswell Blythe stated yesterday that
as long nsa Kentucky Blythe is in ex- !
istence the present suit will be prose
cuted against Florence RlyfhÂ»-Tlinck
ley for the possession of the fortune j
granted to her by the judgment of Cali- |
fornia courts.
PROSECUTION
RESTS ITS CASE
Theodore Figel Will Now
Bring Forth His Wit
nesses.
Theodore Flgel, who is being tried for
the munler of Isaac Hoffman In Judge
Cook's court, admitted before Judge and
lury yesterday, through counsel, that he
had received over 118,000 which had not
been accounted for upon the books of the
firm. The statement was made voluntar
ily with the object in view of hurrying

up matter? in the murder trial. It was
not admitted, however, that the money
was embezzled, but on the contrary, the
deiVnse stated that no crime had been
committed and that at the proper time
it would be clearly shown that although
no accounts were made of the transac
tions no money had been embezzled.
Judge Murphy, for the prosecution, was
not willing to accept the admissions, but
\\e was instructed by Judge Cook to re
ceive tbe admission and place it before
the Jury, as considerable time would be
saved thereby and it would take at least
six weeks to secure and examine wit
nesses for the purpose of proving the al
leged embezzlements. Judge Murphy
stated that he would accept the offer of
the defense to accommodate court and
jury.
From a memorandum furnished by Gen
eral Barnes, of the defense. Judge Mur
phy announced to the jury that Figel had
received amounts which had not been
accounted for, aggregating $9646 46. The
amount of $9077 13, which was stated in
the preliminary examination to have been
embezzled by the dpfondant. was also in
cluded in the admission, which made a
total of J15.732 f>9. Although it was ad
mitted by the defense that the sums had
been received and not accounted for by
Figel; the charge of embezzlement was
strenuously 'li-nied. It was distinctly
stipulated by the defense that the admis
sion of the receipt of the money should
be only in the present case and not to be
referred to in the embezzlement charges,
should they ever be brought before the
attention of the court.
After the receipt of the moneys had
been placed in evidence. Bernard Joseph,
who is in the office of Hoffman, Rothchild
& Co., was called, and testified that Figel
had frequently borrowed money from him
during the years of 1896 and IVÂ«7. Isaac
Gellert was called and testified as to
the JftnOO receipt, but no new points were
brought out by the testimony of the wit
ness.
Charles F. Hunt of the Paris, London
and American Bank was called at the
o .;ing of the afternoon session to iden
tity the account of Hoffman, Rothchild
& Co. The defense admitted the account
from May IS, 1596, up to June 1, 1597. The
witness was followed by Edward S. Roth
child who stated, under examination,
that he had discovered that $9500 had been
drawn which had not been accounted for
He also said that the New York store and
the local branch store had jointly paid
the firm, above all expenses for the year
of IS%, a profit of $72,000. Under cross
examination the witness stated that Fijrel
had frequently drawn up and signed
drafts for the firm, but that the matter
was of no importance. Eleven deposit
tags of. the First National Bank were
then placed in evidence by the prose-
Then handwriting experts made their
appearance. George O. Mitchell. Peter D.
Horton and P. Eisenschimmel all testified

the $9*o receipt was not genuine. Daniel
T. Ames, another expert, was called, but
did not make his appearance. While he
was being called Judge Murphy for the
prosecution stated that after the testi
mony of Ames had been given he would
rest his case if he found nothing of im
portance had been omitted after he had
read the testimony given by the various
witnesses examined. various

DRUGGED AND
ROBBED BI
A STRINGER
Experience of Thomas
Cunningham of
San Mateo.
Drank a Glass of Whisky
and Became Un
conscious.
Met His Despoiler While He
Was Walking Along Market
Street.
SEEKS SHELTER IN PRISON
The Unfortunate Man Was Left
Penniless in a Strange
City.
Thomas D. Cunningham, a recent ar
rival from San Mateo. reported to the
police last night that he had been
drugged and robbed in some lodging
house on Mission street, near Fourth.
According to his story he arrived here
with a hundred and fifty dollars, and
while walking along Market street he
met a stranger who claimed he had
been introduced to him in San Mateo.
Cunningham invited the stranger to
have a drink and they visited a saloon
which, he claims, was in the vicinity
of Third and Mission streets. After a
short conversation his new-found
friend volunteered to accompany him
to his room. While there Cunningham
claims the stranger went outside, but
returned in a few minutes with a drink
of whisky, which he claimed he had
purchased in a neighboring saloon.
After drinking the whisky Cunning-
ham became unconscious and re
mained in that condition for some
time. When he awoke he found that
his money had been taken, as well as
a valise containing his clothing.
Penniless and without friends Cun
ningham last night visited the office of
the Chief of Police and begged the ser
geant in charge to give him a place to
sleep. He was taken to the City
Prison, where he was provided with a
night's lodging.
To a reporter Cunningham said that
after meeting the stranger he partook
of several drinks, and, becoming intox
icated, he started for his room. The al
leged robber volunteered to accompany
him on the way and he asked him if
he had any money. Cunningham re
plied that he had $150, and had just ar
rived from San Mateo, where he was
engaged in business. After reaching
the room the stranger suggested that
they have another drink, and before
Cunningham could reply he left the
room after announcing he would return
in a few minutes. When he again ap
peared he had a glasa of whisky
which looked rather dark.
Becoming suspicious, Cunningham
asked him where he had purchased the
liquor, when the stranger said he had
got it from a friend who ran a saloon
near the lodging-house. Immediately
after drinking it Cunningham fell
asleep. He awoke several hours later
and found his money and clothing
gone.
To-day It is expected he will have re
covered from the effects of the drug,
when two detectives, who have been
detailed on the case by Captain Bohen,
will endeavor to get from him the loca
tion of the house in which he was
robbed.
EVILS OF SLOT MACHINES.
Newsboys Who Spend Their Nickels
to Get Cigarettes.
Chief of Police Lees has reopened the
war on nlckel-ln-the-slot machines, and
has instructed the police to arrest all
persons who offer cash prizes as, an In
ducement to use their machines. War
rants have already been sworn out in
three rases.
Judge Campbell has drawn attention to
another form of vice In connection with
the machines, which he thinks should Re
stamped out at once. He had occasion
to go to the market about 6 o'clock yes
terday morning, and while passing a
cipar-store on the corner of Geary and
Market streets he saw four or five news
boys dropping their nickels in the ma
chine. One of the boys came up to him
and said he had got a straight flush, and
when the JudKÂ« asked him what he got
for It he replied that it meant seventeen
packages of cigarettes.
The Judge severely reprimanded the
cigar man, and told him if a policeman
had been in sight he would have given
him in charge. The Judge brought the
matter to the attention of Chief Lees,
who- will take steps to stop the evil.

THEY FEAR
FOUL PLAY
Strange Disappearance of
a New York Book
keeper.
A. L. Sykes, a Recent Arrival,
Drops Out of
Sight.
His Friends Fear That He Has Been
Murdered for His
Money.
A. L. Sykes, bookkeeper for the In
stantaneous Gas Heating Company of
New York, is among the missing, and
his friends fear that he has been mur
dered.
Sykes arrived here last Thursday
night from New York, intending to sail
on the Alice Blanchard for the Klon
dike, where he was to represent the
Instantaneous Gas Heating Company.
He took a room in the Baldwin Hotel
and made arrangements for his pas
sage on the vessel. He had a letter of
recommendation to General Malonal
sky of 1920 Pine street, and to him he
delivered the letter and told of his in
tended trip to Alaska,
Last Sunday afternoon he was to go
to the general's house to get the money
to buy the necessary provisions and
also to pay his fare to the gold regions.
He failed to show up, however, and
General Malonalsky suspecting some
thing wrong sent a friend to the Bald
win to see what had become of him. He
was not in his room, and the clerk
professed to know nothing as to hig
whereabouts. An examination of the
room showed that his effects were still
there, but there was no trace of the
missing man.
Last night S. Rosendorf, a friend of
General Manolasky, visited police head
quarters and invoked the aid of the
Chief of rolioe in finding the missing
bookkeeper. He described Sykes as be
ing about five feet ten inches in height
and weighing about 160 pounds. He has
a black mustache, and wore a blue
sack coat and dark trousers. Rosen
dorf is firmly convinced that Sykes has
been foully dealt with.
After listening to his story Chief Lees
at once detailed a detective to find the
missing man.
When last seen Sykes was walking
along the water front, evidently in
search of the vessel on which he in
tended to sail. Subsequently he met a
longshoreman, who volunteered to es
cort him to the steamer. After reach
ing the vessel he inquired of one of
the officers when it would sail. He told
him that the steamer was to leave
Monday afternoon. Sykes said he had
already procured his ticket and
would have his baggage ready be
fore sailing time. He informed the offi
cer that he was staying at the Baldwin
Hotel, and was anxious to see a friend
before leaving the city. He then board
ed a Market street car, since which
time he has not beon seen.

His Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Feb. 16.â The Palais of Jus
tice on the ninth day of the trial of M.
Emile Zola and Perrieux was crowded
as usual. The presiding judge re
jected M. Clemenceau's request of yes
terday that he appoint a magistrate to
question Mme. de Boulancey if among
the letters she has from Major Ester
hazy there is not one containing the
following expressions:
Firstly, "General Saussier (then the
commander-in-chlef of the French
army and military governor of Paris)
is a clown. In our country the Ger
mans would not show him in a circus."
Secondly, "If the Prussians got as far
as Lyons they might throw away their
guns and keep only their riding whips
to drive the French in front of them? v
M. Laborie, counsel for H. Zola, re
nounced the examination of the mem
bers of the Esterhazy court-martial,
but he energetically demanded that
General Billot, the Minister for War,
be called to testify. The presiding
judge, M. Delgarogue, invited M. Labo
rie to present a conclusion to that ef
fect.
General Pellieux, who conducted the
Investigation into the charges brought
against Major Esterhazy, created a j
sensation by protesting against the ac- i
ceptance of the "evidence of amateur
experts who have not seen the original
bordereau," adding that he also desired
to raise his voice in the most emphatic
manner against slanders which are cal- ;
culated to destroy confidence in the
hands of the army at a time when dan
ger is perhaps nearer than people be- |
lieve."
This statement of the general had a
marked effect in court. General Pel- i
lieux said the first facsimile which ap
peared in the Matin was the nearest
correct of all. He added that there
was writing on both sides of the pa- ;
per, which was flimsy, and he be
lieved that when the bordereau was pho
tographed, it was impossible to pre- i
vent the writing on the reverse side ;
from showing through. As the ink
used was somewhat faint, the wit- !
ness thought it necessary to touch up !
the writing in order to render it more i
distinct.
Continuing, General Pellieux said he |
considered the proceedings showed that i
the defense attached no weight to the '
evidence of the sworn experts who had !
seen the original bordereau, and had !
compared it with the acknowledged :
handwriting of the accused, while the 'â 
testimony of amateurs, one a dentist \
and another a foreigner, was received
with full confidence.
"Such tactics do not surprise me,"
added the general, "since they were
foreshadowed in my office by Matthieu |
Dreyfus, when bringing charges j
against Major Esterhazy. I asked him |
if he desired a second expert report
on th^ bordereau. As he did not re
ply, I concluded that If the expert ex
amination had not been favorable to
him, he would have demanded an
other.
"For some time there has been much
talk of handwriting, people discussing
who could have written the bordereau, i
Well. I will prove to you here, with the !
papers in my hand, that the officer '
who wrote the bordereau belonged to the i
ministry of war, was an artilleryman
and was seconded for service on ths !
Btaff."
The statement of General Pellieux
caused a sensation. M. Laborie here
interrupted the witness, saying:
"I ask that Colonel Picquart, who I
is at the present moment at the house \
of Magistrate Berliese, be summoned to i
hear this evidence."
"It is not your turn to speak," re
plied the presiding Judge.
M. Laborie, however, returned to the
charge, protesting and insisting that j
Colonel Picquart be called. When Gen- j
Pellieux was allowed to continue
his evidence he said:
"An analysis of the bordereau indi
cates that only an artillery officer at
tached to the war ministry could have
known the facts or have used the
technicalities employed in the border
eau. An Infantryman could never In !
his life have spoken of the things of
which the bordereau speaks. (Sensa
tion.;
"And now." exclaimed the general
raising his voice, "what remains of ali i
this fabric? Not much. Yet they ac- i
cuse officers of acquitting a guilty man j
in pursuance of orders." (Prolonged i
Bensation.)
The general also said: "I have the'
soul of a soldier, which revolts at hear- !
ing the infamous aspersions showered
upon us, and I can keep silence no
longer. I cannot stand still and see
men trying to detech the army from I
its chiefs, for, if the soldiers cease to I
have confidence in them, what will the |
chiefs do in the day of danger, which
18, perhaps, nearer than people think? <
Then, gentlemen of the jury, your sons |
would be led to simple butchery but at '
the same time M. Zola will have gained ;
a fresh victory and will have achieved !
a new debacle and will be able to la" :
his history before Europe, from which !
France has been wiped out.
The effect of this outburst was In- i
tense. In conclusion General Pellieux
said: I
"We should have been glad if the I
court-martial had acquitted Dreyfus !
as it would have shown there was no
traitor in the army for ali of us to ]
raournp."
Leaving the witness stand the gen
eral was long and loudly cheered.

HUNTINGTON'S HAND SEEN
Evidence That He Is Directing Traffic
Arrangements for Both
Lines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 16.â Signs more
[ convincing than words, written or
; spoken, convince the people of South
1 crn California that the two great rail
way corporations â the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe â have combined to make
the State pay the highest tribute that
i the population can bear. It is no
longer a secret that C. P. Huntington
and E. P. Ripley, presidents respective
ly of these two companies, have had
conferences on the subject. On more
i than one occasion J. C. Stubbs has
! spoken with authority from Hunting
ton with respect to traffic regulations
lin this particular field. Mr. Stubbs
is the advocate and apostle of that
gospel of railroading which teaches
that everything which the land pro
| duces and the sea yields should be
taxed in hauling all that the traffic
can bear. The devotion of Mr. Stubbs
to this principle of conducting railroad
business contributed much to make
the Southern Pacific, in the minds of
Californians, the most odious and de-
I spised of all corporations.
When laws and public protests failed
to give the people relief from the ex
actions of a strongly intrenched mo
: nopoly, the oppressed producers of Cal
ifornia turned their gaze to the East
to watch for the approach of a com
peting road.
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
seemed to have more of the spirit "f j
development in its management, to be j
animated by more intelligence in its '
policy of extension than any other j
Eastern road tending this way, and no j
itj approach was hailed with especial
delight.
Never did a railway enter a field wth
BO much popular favor as the Santa Fe |
: found in coming to California. Fig
uratlvely speaking, California went oat j
to the desert to meet the builders and j
i tender them franchises, l^nds, conces-
I Bions, rights of way, deep water ter
minals and assurances of public sup
port. Could the value of all that was
tendered and accepted be computed on
a cash basis it would make a sum of
money equal to the cost of construct- i
ing a parallel line on the whole system '
of the Santa Fe between the Colorado !
River and the Pacific Ocean.
The Santa Fe for years fulfilled the j
expectations of the people. New indus
tries were brought forth in the State, j
cities grew and thriving towns multi- j
plied. The traffic increased and the j
railway corporation under the effect- j
ive administration of the old Santa Fe j
management was gratified. Stories of \
the wonderful development of Southern
California spread throughout the world.
People living north of Tehachapi talked
of returning prosperity and reasoned
that it would not come until railway
competition brought it.
So much for a brief review of events
immediately following the extension of
the Santa Fe system to Los Angeles,
San Diego, Riverside and San Bernar
dino.
A change significant and ominous has
taken place. The public is no longer
in the confidence of the Santa Fe. The
corporation once regarded as liberal
and progressive has gone by degrees
down the grade until it has reached
Stubbs' class in the ethics of traffic.
It is not all surprising that the first
signs of the change were noted by the
agents of the Santa Fe. It had been
their pleasure to meet communities half
way and make concessions where the
points conceded would please the public
and not deprive the road of profit, j
When instructions from headquarters j
advised against doing this thing for one
town and that for another they began
to talk in whispers.
It was surmised that motives of econ
omy caused the withdrawal of all time
card advertisements from the newspa
pers along the line of the road. The
newspapers are not affected to speak of
by such curtailment of advertising ex
penses, but travelers in haste to ascer
tain the exact time of train arrival or
departure have to hustle around to find
a hotel clerk or railroad ticket agent to
get the desired Information.
The Southern Pacific nature of a
time-card advertisement was based on
a peculiar system of rewarding merit.
If the paper constantly praised Mills,
from whom all passes flow, and went
Into a rhapsody of delight when C. P.
Huntington paid his annual visit to
California, the editor was a good man
whose ideas of journalism should be en
couraged. The Santa Fe advertise
ments went to the press under different
conditions. The company, so far as the
press knew, had no Mills to praise and
no Huntington to exalt. The time-card
publication was a public convenience.
The idea of .public convenience has un
dergone a change. It Is now given out
that if the publication of a time-card
"ad" Is a public convenience the news
papers Rhould publish it for the conve
nience of the public.
Trains were formerly moved with
some regard to the convenience of the
traveling public. Now the schedules j
are arranged, so far as one chief point
in Southern California is concerned, so
as to impose the greatest annoyance
possible on the tourists who are num
bered by the thousands. To catch the
morning train out of Coronado the
traveler must rise at 5:30 o'clock in or
der to get his breakfast and cross on j
the ferry to the railway station In San !
Diego. If the passenger can get his i
baggage to the station in time to catch
the train his trunks go along, if not,
they await until another train goes.
The Santa Fe no longer considers that
it collected from San Diego in a short
time the sum of $12,000 for extra bag
gage.
When the promoters of the Los An
geles Fiesta and the San Diego Water
Carnival asked the Santa Fe to stand
in with a contribution to help along the
enterprises, a cold refusal to entertain
the proposition was eiven by the cor- j

CRAZY MOTHER
CUTS OUT HER
BABY'S TONGUE
Annoyed by the Little One's
Wailings, She Silences It
Forever.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 16.â A story of cruelty so inhuman that one is
appalled at the very thought of it came to the attention of District At
torney E. B. Martinelli to-day. It was nothing' more nor less than an
account of a mother cutting off the tongue of a child because the in
fant annoyed her by crying. In extenuation of this horrifying act on
the part of the woman, it is said that she is insane, and does not realize
the enormity of the crime that has made out of a live, healthy child a
creature without the power of articulation, a mute who must go
through life bearing the burden of a mother's fiendish deed.
Never before in the annals of Marin County has a case similar to
this been brought to the attention of the authorities, and just what ac
tion will be taken has not yet been decided upon. The story is best told
in the words of Assistant District Attorney Murray, who learned of the
circumstances through a Mrs. Cornwall of Nicasio, where all the par
ties to the affair reside.
"I was driving along the county road near Nicasio with Mrs. Corn
wall," paid Murray, "and we were talking about some case when Mrs.
Cornwall said that there was a case in Nicasio that would proobably be
brought to the attention of District Attorney Martinelli. I asked
her about it, and she told me that a woman living about one mile from
Nicasio, on the Lucas graded road, had cut the tongue out of her
youngest child. The infant had been crying too much, and she took this
method of stopping the noise.
"We drove along and she eaid she would point out the house and
the woman to me, but she said she did not know her name, as she had
been there only about a year. When we came to the shanty, which I
should say had about two rooms in it, judging from the size, she told
me to look. I saw a woman driving a cow. She looked wild, was
poorly clad and had heavy boots on. She walked along, yelling at
her cow. I saw one of the children, who was clad in scant clothing."
The family moved from Oregon to Nicasio, which is on the line of
the North Pacific Coast road, about ten miles from San Rafael, and
took up their home in a shanty about one mile from the town. When
they first came down they brought five children along, and left them
at the place while they went back to Oregon, presumably for the rest,
for there are eight children in the family.
When they left the five children at Nicasio and went north, the lit
tle ones were as wild as Indians, and scampered out of sight on the ap
proach of strangers. The people about Nicasio were mystified and at
tempted to feed the children that they might not starve. The little ones
were roughly clad, and the rags hung about them in ribbons. They
lived on acorns and what little wild fruit they could gather. At last
the neighbors, seeing their pitiful condition, would leave the food near
the shanty, and, after their benefactors were out of sight, the children
would steal up and eat it. This was repeated until the parents of the
children returned from Oregon with the rest of the family.
For a year the family has lived near Nicasio in poverty, filth and
distress, and now comes the story of the cutting out of the tongue of
the youngest child to add to the other disgusting details.
The mother is unquestionably crazy. Judge Miller, who lives in that
section, said that some time ago he saw the woman roaming about the
woods near Fairfax, about three miles from here, with only a pair of
boots on. She was nude and acted in a crazy manner. She is tall, being
about six feet in height. She is said to be a cousin of Frank Bernard,
a Portuguese who is frequently in trouble. His occupation is that of
selling wood and at this he makes a hand-to-mouth living.
poraticm. The figures are not at pres
ent available to show what Los An
geles has done for the Santa Fe, but
the fourth annual report of the Board
of Directors of the San Diego Land and
Town Company (the Santa Fe syndi
cate) which was made in 1890 and pub
lished in Boston in IS9I clearly shows
that the company then had derived $1,
882,841 from the sale of one-third of the i
lands which the public-spirited people i
of San Diego gave in their generosity j
to the Santa Fe corporation.
It is not wide of the mark of actual
fact to estimate that Southern Cali
fornia gave to secure the extension of
the Santa Fe into this territory lands
which have since been sold for a sum j
equaling the cost of the road's con
struction from Barstow to Ran Diego.
The cost of building from Barstow to
San Diego was $3,000,000.
Space is not available for a history j
of the events preceding the donation, j
Before the war a railroad was projected j
from Memphis to San Diego. After the |
war Tom Scott, with the Texas Pa
cific, entered the arena and San Diego's
hopes were shattered when Scott had to j
abandon his plans for a continental
road.
When President Nickerson of the |
Santa Fo system came forward with :
promises, made in good faith, it is be- j
lieved. to- establish and maintain great j
terminal facilities of his line on the bay I
of San Diego, the leading men of the
city â in fact, citizens of all classes
gave him everything he desired. In ef
fect the people of Southern California
built the road, and hence it came to
be regarded as an institution friendly
to the people. Sentiment figured In the
receipts of the road. Passengers went
rrut of their way to travel on the line,
and shippers gave it business because
the road stood In with the people.
When the friendly attitude of the i
Santa Fe was changed to one of indif- |
ference the people of San Diego fancied
that the new management under the
reorganization effected by the Union
Trust Company of New York had some
special grievance against their city,
but when they began to inquire into
the facts and receive information in
confidence they ascertained that the
policy of the company had changed.
They were informed that Mr. Ripley
did not favor the system of develop
ment which was inaugurated when the
road entered the State. It was ex
plained that he disliked excursions be
cause they bunched the travel. As for
train accommodations, he would not I
provide them unless the volume of pas
senger business justified the provision.
Men who are in position to know
what Is going on inside are pretty cer
tain that C. P. Huntington has more
to say in the management of the Santa
Fe system than President Ripley.
Things have come to such a condition
that shippers cannot select the route
of shipment. Recently a Riverside
shipper ordered several carloads of
freight sent to Chicago by the Santa
Fe. He was told that it could not be
done, as the Santa Fe had had its share
of business from that point for the pe
riod and the Southern Pacific was en
titled to the haul.
Again, the Santa Fe has been in
creasing rates on freight. When freight
rates are advanced it is a pretty sure
sign that Stubbs has infected the man
agement. Apart from any speculation
as to Stubbs' influence in making rates
for Southern California shippers, the
fact stands out clearly that the pro
gressive policy of dealing with the pub
lic which made the road popular and
prosperous under the Nickerson re
gime has been abandoned and Southern
Pacific methods of inciting ill will and
public discontent have been introduced.
There is talk to the effect that the
English stockholders who are supposed
to control the situation here sought
Huntington's friendly counsel and ad
vice, but this may be mere conjecture.
It is probably nearer the mark to as
sert that Mr. Ripley, whose genius as a
railroad man is not exceptionally brill
iant, is outclassed by C. P. Huntington.
From an authentic source it is
ascertained that the pool, so far as
it related to orange shipments, was
established to embrace the orchard
product of Southern California for the
season of 1897. A semblance of com
petition was put forward and to some
extent it was genuine, as the refrig
erator companies contending for the
employment of their respective cars
had not been admitted to the secrets
of the combine, and, therefore, so
licited traffic in 1897 with some vigor.
Subsequently the C. F. and X., con
trolled by Earl; the Fruit G rowers Ex
press, controlled by Armour, and the
Santa Fe Fruit and Refrigerator Line,
managed by the Santa Fe, were
brought into an agreement not to fight
each other. No attention now is paid
to a shipper's request that an Earl or
Armour refrigerator ear be used.
Everything is included in the pool and
the railroad combine takes the car that
happens to be on the sidetrack near
est the point of shipment.
The assertion was made to-night by
a leading man from New York that
there was an agreement in writing, but
that it may not be signed. The com
pact embraces too many points and
involves so many propositions that a
mere verbal understanding would not
be acceptable. The combine embraces
the passenger traffic, as well as rates
on oranges and lemons. This man,
who knows what he is talking about,
but will not permit the use of his name
in a published interview at the present
time, said:
â¢'The Interstate Commission could by
active effort ascertain that the South
ern Pacific recently gave to the Santa
Fe a check for $10,000 to adjust a
month's dealings in passenger busi
ness."
The further significant fact Is de
veloped that the Santa Fp, which for
merly handled from 60 to 80 per cent
of the oranges and lemons, is now 900
cars short of the Southern Pacific in
this season's business. The crop for
shipment this year requires 11,000 cars.
The damage by frost was overesti
mated. A survey of the field shows
that the number of cars will fall but
little short of the original estimate of
12,000. Of this, number 4400 have gone
forward and the number handled by
the Santa Fe is f>oo less than that of
the Southern Pacific.
The Santa Fe, while participating in
the profit without performing the serv
ice, may gain a temporary advantage,
but when the pool breaks, as It inev
itably must, the Southern Pacific will
have the business. Every move down
here shows that Ripley is outclassed
by Huntington. There is a talk that
the Santa Fe is top heavy with freight
talent. This story is told to account
for deficiencies in the passenger serv
ice, but when th<* truth comes out
along the whole line it will be found
that the Santa Fe has not one freight
man able to hold his own in Stubbs'
class. When the directors and leading
stockholders who now fancy that the
company is being conducted according
to safe and conservative methods
awaken to find that the Southern Pa
cific has got the bulk of the business
and the profitable end of the local pas
senger traffic, there will be a storm in
the East.
The preponderance of the Southern
Pacific's business in oranges Is In a
measure explained by the activity of
Eastern lines. On the $1 25 rate the
Southern Pacific gives the Union Pa
cific and the lowa lines and other
Western roads a slice. These Western
roads then meet secretly and offer
orange shippers a rebate on consign
ments east of the Missouri River. The
result is that the shippers crowi their
business upon the Southern Pacific.
The Santa Fe, having a direct line
from San Diego to Chicago, gives
nothing to the Eastern roads. It makes
no rebate. The Santa Fe is In a posi
tion to make a $1 rate, and that was
contemplated before the recent change
of management. On a $1 rate Hun
tington could not give the Eastern
roads much of a percentage without
tapping its own big share. He is op
posed to this on general business prin
ciples. The Santa Fe, in maintaining
the $1 25 rate, simply surrenders con
trol of the traffic. The rate is main
tained to protect the Southern Pacific
and its maintenance is contrary to law.
A Santa Fe agent in talking to a lead
ing shipper remarked:
"I don't care a for oranges, but if
you have any dried fruit I would like
the business."
There is no such thing as rafiway
competition in Southern California to
day. Huntington has the Santa Fe so
tied up and hedged about by pools and
agreements that the men on the road
do not know what company they are
working for. All of the great advan
tages which tho generous people of the
South gave to the Santa Fe have been
bartered away.

To-Morrow.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOPEKA, Kan., Feb. 16.â The Gov
i ernment lien on the Union Pacific Rail
| road in Kansas was wiped out to-day
' at the Union Pacific station in this city.
The Kansas Pacific road was bought in
I by Alvin W. Krech, representing the
i reorganization committee, for $6,303,
; 000. There was no competition at the
sale. Mr. Krech was the only bidder.
Mr. Krech Avaited until Judge W. D.
Cornish finished reading the long
drawn out decree of foreclosure and
then quietly stepped up to the special
master and said:
"On the part of the reorganization
committee, I bid $6,303,000 for the road."
Ten feet away the bid was not heard,
i but it was one of the final steps in the
| big railroad deal. Judge Cornish then
I repeated the amount.
"I am offered $6,303,000 for this prop
erty by Mr. Alvin W. Krech, represent
j ing the reorganization committee," said
he. "Are there any other bidders?
"There being no other bidders I de
clare this property described in the de
! cree sold to Mr. Alvin W. Krech, on the
part of the reorganization committee."
The party will leave Topeka after the
' sale to-morrow and go to Salina, where
I on Friday the third sale will take place.
! This will be that of the middle division
: of the road, a stretch of 254 miles, un
| der a special mortgage. Mr. Krech will
buy In the property, paying the upset
price of $5,300,000.
On Saturday the entire line of the
! Kansas Pacific from Kansas City to
Denver will be formally sold at the
i Union Pacific station in North Topeka.
This will be under the consolidation
| mortgage, and the upset price will be
i $8,000,000.
It was stated by one of the principal
| attorneys in the case to-day that no one
i except the United States Government
! and the reorganization committee was
! qualified to bid on any of the sales
i this week. The Government qualified
' only to force the company to bid, as
required by the arrangements made at
Washington and St. Louis.

The history of the Kansas Pacific is
a history of the methods by which Jay
Gould acquired his fortune. The road
was built from Kansas City to Chey
enne, Wyo., in connection with the
Union Pacific system under a system
(if Government subsidies. The original
! legislation gave the Kansas Pacific
Cmnpany equal rights for rates of
transportation over the Union Pacific
road, but the latter so disregarded that
law and placed such obstacles in the
way of the Kansas Pacific getting its
share of the through business that this
was one of the main causes of its bank
ruptcy in the fall of 1873. It was in the
latter part of 1874 that Mr. Gould ob
tained virtual control of the Union Pa
cific. Under his management the Kan
sas Pacific was still prevented from
I getting its just dues and so a reorganl
! zation was prevented until other finan
cial difficulties intervened, and he was
enabled to get control of the Kansas
Pacific Company's stock and bonds at
a mere trifle. In 18T6, a few days after
the election of President Hayes, a re
ceiver was appointed. This receivership
I proved Gould's greatest coup. He
i bought the stock at two or three cents
| on the dollar, compromised the Denver
| extension bonds and when the consoli
! dation was formed the stock of the two
i companies was valued alike, share for
! share. Union Pacific stock was worth
I about 80 cents and Gould came out of
I the deal ahead by several millions.
During the last few years the road
j has paid fairly well. Last year its gross
! earnings were $2,250,000, and the net
I earnings were $705,000.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 16.â There was no
mistake about Leiter's control of the
wheat market to-day. Those who a
week ago wondered what he was going
to do with all his wheat were trying to
find out to-day what he would do with
his money. There was very little
wheat to be had in the pit and prices
moved up higher than at any time on
the crop for May.
In August, when cash wheat touched
$1 for the first time since 1891, May
touched $1 01%. Since that time it has
been down to 97% c. To-day the price
was rushed up from 99% cto $1 03%, and
later on the curb to $1 06. At last it
was $1 05. An advance of over 7 cents
in two days shows the grip that Leiter
has on the market and the perilous po
sition in which shorts find themselves.
The advance looks sensational, but it
was without undue excitement in the
pit. Outside of Leiter's holdings of
about 18,000,000 bushels there is no
large speculative interest. Heavy
traders who in the past have been long
from 500,000 to 2,000,000 bushels or more,
when prices were very much lower, are
not following the advance with large
holdings, and, while they believe in
higher prices, are willing to let Leiter
have the benefit while they trade in a
modest way.
Calls for to-day on May wheat sold
on the curb to-night at $1 05Vi to Â§1 11V 2 .
There was hardly a trader to be found
who did not believe that unless Leiter
came to the rescue and sold enough to
prevent an advance calls might be
good. Buying came from New York,
the Northwest, California and from St.
Louis. Foreigners have been short on
July and May against cash purchases,
and while a good many have come in
and closed their losses, the larger num
ber are still out.
Leiter sold a little cash wheat at the '
best price he ever secured. He had i
about 100 cars loaded at Armour's ele- j
vator to-day, which is to go direct to (
Liverpool. Armour is also shipping
wheat on his own account, as he is i
a believer in higher prices, and thinks 'â 
Liverpool is the place to sell it. Mes- ;
sages from the Northwest said that j
Armour and Leiter were bidding 3 j
to 4 cents "over the market for cash j
wheat. Armour in an interview to
night said that he was not short a
bushel, as he believed wheat would
sell at $1 25. Referring tn the story |
that he hal given a $3,000,000 check to â¢
Peavy, the Minneapolis elevator man. i
to secure a return of wheat borrowed j
from him during December, he said I
that there was not a word of truth in j
it, as he never borrowed a bushol of
wheat: and he added: "We never bor
row wheat or money."
SILVER THE KEY
TO PROSPERITY
Ex-Congressman Towne Given
a Great Ovation at San
Bernardino.
Eloquently Pleads for Bimetallism
and Predicts Bryan's Ulti
mate Success.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO. Feb. 18.â Ex-
Congressman C. A. Towne of Duluth,
Minn., spoke on silver and prosperity
in the pavilion in this city to-night
and was given a great ovation by the
Democrats, the Republicans and the
Populists. Although it was slightly
raining the audience was composed of
2000 people, many of whom were from
the surrounding towns. Guns were
fired, bands of music were in evidence
and the usual dressing of pageant was
on hand.
The speaker said in part that the
cause of bimetallism was as old as
civilization itself and its principles
were as easily understood as the rule
of three, but they had been so largely
perverted that many intelligent people
had erroneous ideas of what they con
veyed. The good of the country is the
end prescribed by all parties, and to
forsake one's party is not such a dread
ful thing. He tried it and never felt
so good in his life. The campaign of
189G, he said, has not stopped. It will
go on and on to the end of all time.
There never was before a defeated
party that began so soon after being
vanquished to celebrate a victory. You
cannot have good money unless you
have enough money, but it may be
come so good that no one can get any
of it.
Money is not only a medium of ex
change, but it is a representation of
value and a medium of deferred pay
ments. The value of a piece of money
is what it win buy. There never was
such a crime committed in all the ages
as that which in twenty-five years cut
the value of commodities half in two
and raised the purchasing power of
gold 50 per cent. One per cent of thÂ«
people in the United States own more
property than the other 99 per cent.
The gold standard is a scheme to en
able you to get in debt easier, but will
not let you get out of debt. The pro
ducers of the world have never yet re
ceived their just dues.
Mr. Towne closed with an eloquent
peroration concerning the policy of
what he .terms the three great reform
parties uniting in the next election and
predicted the election of Bryan to the
presidency.

I Call Office, Riggs House,
i . > Washington, ] Feb. 16.
i Senator Morrill of Vermont occupied
[ the entire time of the executive session
of the Senate to-day in a speech oppos
ing the annexation of Hawaii. The
speech was intended to show that the
; acquisition of the Hawaiian Islands
would be against both good policy and
the traditions of this country. He had
always stood against the acquisition of
distant lands, and was still opposed to
that policy as one calculated to under
mine the integrity of the Republic.
Mr. Morrill said that, commercially,
Hawaii had been vastly exaggerated,
and contended that the j annexation
would result in the inevitable destruc
tion of the beet-sugar, industry of the
United States because of . the inability
of American labor to compete with the
coolie labor employed on the Hawaiian
plantations.
From a military point of view he
argued that the control of Hawaii
would be a source of weakness rather
than of strength, because a navywould
be required for its defense in time of
war, while in time of peace we should
not need the islands on this account.
Senator Morrill quoted with especial
emphasis a letter from Daniel Webster,
dated in 1843, advising the maintenance
of the independence of the islands, and
closed with an appeal to the people of
the United States to continue this
policy. _______________
WHILE SLEEPING
HE EXHORTED
Death of a Remarkable Som
nambulist Divine at Evans
ville, Ind.
During His Dreams for Forty Years
He Had Called Sinners to
Repentance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. 16.â Rev. J.
j C. McÃeynolds, pastor of the Christian
j Church of this city, has just received
news of the death of his father, Rev. S.
D. McÃeynolds of Evansville, Ind. The
elder McÃeynolds was subject to strange
experiences in his sleeping- hours. He was
known in the neighborhood as the "som
nambulist parson." If he heard a sermon
which deeply impressed him he would
almost certainly repeat It that night in
his dreams, and in a manner that his
neighbors across the way could distinctly
hear.
Traveling through Illinois once, he
stopped over Sunday and attended church.
That night the sermon was repeated from
the room of the strange guest. A news
paper man sleeping in the same hotel re
ported the sermon in the morning paper,
and this was the first knowledge the
sleeping preueher had of his dream and
midnight audience.
Rev. Mr. Mo Reynolds says his father
has repeated his sermons also, and al
ways revised and improved them in the
delivery. The body of his sermon as well
as his prayer was fervent, eloquent and
original.
Through the course of forty years he
has preached to thousands, who arose
from their beds to hear these midnight
discourses, and sometimes to weep under
his exhortations to sinners to turn and
live or to rejoice while, they listened to
the vivid descriptions of the New Jeru
salem and the inheritance of saints.
Try the "Koh-I-Noor" lead pencil, and
you will have no further use for others. â¢

Fitting Exhibition of Pacific Coast Resources.
Mayor Phelan, M. H. De Young and Leading Commercial Bodies at One===President McKinley
May Participateâ = A Christian Anniversary.
PROMPT, cordial and approving
come responses to the suggestion
of The Call that the semi-centen
nial of the admission of California to
Statehood in the Union, should be cele
brated by holding in San Francisco an
exposition of the first order of magni
tude.
Governor Budd advocates the enter
prise in a ringing note, the Governors
of Beveral of the surrounding States
express sympathy with the project, the
Mayor of the city takes strong grouncl
in its favor, and a host of citizens of
light and leading among the people
heartily indorse the plan and promise
It the aid of -their influence and their
energies.
Doubters may possibly find some
seeming: rause for hesitation In such a
movement, for there are people who
always see a lion in the path. Men
of sanguine temperament, strong; will
and resolute minds, who view the sub
ject from the standpoint of common
sense and who take counsel of their
hopes rather than of their fears, will
go forward, however, and carry the
great undertaking through. That much
seems well assured at the very outset.
The manner in which the suggestion
ha? been received shows that it ap
peals to a sentiment already formed,
and that The Call has done no moro
than give expression to a desire gen
erally shared throughout the Pacific
Coast.
All who are eager to have San Fran
olsco move forward in the front rank
of progressive cities, all who ar^
willing to work for the advancement of
California; all who have an interest in
promoting the prestige of the Pacific
Coast, and a patriotic desire' to aug
ment the welfare of the people, arp
rpady to stand in and help the under
taking.
The prevailing tone of public senti
ment Is well pounded in the Interviews
which we publish on the subject from
many persons of weight and influence.
Every one of them should be read. Not
a few of them contain suggestions of
great value on the subject, and set
forth arguments for the plan of origi
nal force and effectiveness.
So many men of official eminence and
personal influence in all parts of the
Pacific cv.ast have given approval of
the project that it may now be con
sidered as fairly launched. From this
time on it should move steadily for
ward. It is an enterprise in which the
whole Pacific Coast and all the rich
mineral States of the great West can
and ought to work together with har
mony and with resolution to succeed.
The success attained by the Midwin
ter Fair, so hastily prepared, shows
what can be accomplished in such en
terprises on this coast even under the
adverse circumstances of hard times
and little opportunity for preparation.
The recent brilliant parade in celebra
tion of Jubilee day is a proof of the
Interest Californians take in grand
MAYOR PHELAN IN HEARTY ACCORD.
A celebration should be held by all
means. lam always in favor of exhibit
ing San Francisco and California to the
people of other States, because I know we
gain by such contact. While we all rec
ognize the merits of our State and city,
we have not yet to any great extent
convinced others. If we attract by expositions we
may hold by merit, and certainly expositions are the
best means of manifesting the merits which we un
deniably possess.
The only practical objection I see to an exposi
tion is the overshadowing one to be held in that
year in Paris. California must be represented there,
and the United States will endeavor to eclipse the
world. I feel confident that we will succeed in the
endeavor, and our State must do her share to
achieve success in the exhibition.
The Native Sons have decided to hold a grand
celebration in this city in our jubilee year, and the
event will be well taken care of by the new genera
tion. However, I may be quoted as being in favor
of the project, and earnestly hope for it a complete
measure of. success. JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
ceremonial?. From what has been ac
complished at these two festivals we
can draw auguries of a genuine tri
umph if we begin at once to prepare
for the proposed exposition of 1900.
With two years of time to arrange
for the exposition, with all the States
of the great West interested in it. with
the trend of western travel augmented
by the Alaskan gold industry, which
by that time will be yielding a flood
tide of revenues to the cities of the
coast, and in fact to the nation gen
erally, there can be no doubt that the
San Francisco Exposition of 1900 will
hold a position inferior to none in this
country except the marvel at Chicago.
The inducements are many and the
promises are well founded. We invite
to the subject the attention of the
whole coast. The following letters from
Governors, Mayor Phelan and other
persons of position and power in the
community show with what force the
movement starts and clear before it is
the avenue to success and triumph.
A VALUABLE
SUGGESTION.
An Attractive Exposition Would
Bring Many Visitors to the
State.
W. 11. Mills â The suggestion made by
The Call relating to a proper observ
ance of the semi-centennial anniver
sary of the admission of this State
into the Union of States is timely and
valuable. In the fifty years of its his
tory California has not projected or
carried to successful completion a
great international exposition. The
nearest approach to this was the Mid
winter Fair, an occasion which con
ferred the highest benefit upon the
State. That fair would have been
wholly impracticable but for the fact
that it was held immediately after the
close of the great World's Fair in Chi
cago, and was in gome respects an
echo of that greatest of all world's ex
positions.
California expended on the World's
Fair at Chicago over $700,000 to make
an exhibit. This sum included
all that was expended by the
State, counties and by individual ex
hibitors. But California expended, ac
cording to some intelligent estimates,
nearly $10,000,000 in visiting the fair.
If this be exaggerated, let it be assumed
that the State spent $5,000,000, and the
net cost of the exhibit at Chicago was
from six to seven millions of dollars.
This expenditure abroad reduced the
cash capital of the State by six or
seven millions.
If an attractive exposition was pro
jected and proved a financial failure it
would not cost this commonwealth
anything like the sums which will be
expended in attending expositions else
where. The success of the undertaking
of course will depend largely upon the
attractiveness and value of the feat

ures to he presented. The President of
the United States can be secured to de
liver an address on the 9th of Septem
ber, 1900, on the fiftieth anniversary of
the admission of California as a State,
and that fact alone would call to the
fair a large concourse of people.
With no counter attraction, the peo
ple of California will spend two or
three millions of dollars m visiting the
World's Exposition at Paris, and while
I have been zealous in securing a
proper representation for California at
the Paris Exposition, in common with
other citizens of the State. I would be
willing to forego that undertaking in
the interest of a great exposition at
home.
The year 1900 is the centennial of the
Christian Era. It will be emphasized
by observances in all parts of Chris
tendom. The year has, therefore, a
double significance to the people of this
State, and the fiftieth anniversary of
the admission of the State has sympa
thetic significance at least to all the
THE EXPOSITION WOULD BE COMMEMORATIVE AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL.
By all means we should have a semi-centennial exposition. The
Call's idea is a fine one.
This exposition should be of all the Pacific and Western States ad
mitted during the fifty years.
The idea will strike with peculiar force those familiar with the efforts
to open up this territory, and the then apparent hopelessness of such efforts.
Within two years hundreds of thousands of persons from all parts of
the world, representing the bone and sinew of their respective countries, will go to the far
north in search of gold. These leave behind them families and friends, so that in reality
the "eyes of the world" will be gazing intently westward. Whether success or failure
come to the gold-seeker he will not make a home in the frozen north. He will seek some
more favored land Where will it be ? Where will he locate with his family and induce
his friends to come ? Where will he spend the money he takes away from Alaska?
These are questions that the great exposition would settle, and these are the prizes,
as it were, for which each State would strive with an effort that would make the exposi
tion second to none that has taken place in the United States.
The exposition- would not only be commemorative; it would be educational and
inducive as well
To the end that we receive the aid of others, we should aid them. This would
lead us to give support to the Omaha Exposition.
By all means let us celebrate our semi-centennial by an exposition.
sisterhood of States west of the Rocky
Mountains.
But little difficulty would be expe
rienced in exciting the largest interest
in such an event in the minds of the
people of the Orient, especially the
people of Japan. Chile, Guatemala,
Mexico, Australia, Tasmania and New
Zealand are countries which, like our
selves, have their future greatness In
terwoven with the development of the
Pacific Ocean commerce, and their
sympathy in a great exposition on this
Coast could be easily enlisted.
The practical methods necessary to
the accomplishment of such an under
taking should be left to the future con
sideration. But one general underlying
consideration must not be overlooked,
and that is that a really great occa
sion is more easy of accomplishment
than an inconsiderable undertaking. If
a proper celebration of the nineteenth
centennial of the Christian era and of
the semi-centennial of the statehood of
California is projected its success will
depend largely on the adequacy of its
original conception, the breadth of the
undertaking and the energy of its exe
cution. It should start upon the finan
cial basis of at least 52,000,000, and in
my opinion it would be easier to raise
that sum than to raise $100,000.
An exposition Is well worthy the con
sideration of our people.
IT WOULD DO
GREAT GOOD.
Secretary Filcher of the State
Board of Trade Approves
the Idea.
J. A. Filoher. secretary of the State
Board of Trade, had a meed of ap
proval for the Idea, as he naturally has
for every plan which has for its main
spring the weal of California. He said:
"While I have an Idea that the money
spent In such an enterprise might pro
duce better results if expended in main
taining Californian exhibits in the
Eastern and foreign cities, yet I have
no doubt that much good would come
from such an exposition as the one
proposed. It would be well worth to
California every cent It might cost
many times over. Indeed, it would be
hard to estimate the benefit likely to
accrue. I am satisfied that if the en
terprise should be properly started the
State Board of Trade would back it up
in good shape. It will be a very good
thing to agitate the matter, and if Cali
fornia undertakes the thing it should
be and could be made the biggest un
dertaking of the kind ever made by
this or any other State in the Unionâ
for we ought to be able to make a bet
ter exhibit than all the other States
put together, by reason of the fact that
there is hardly a natural product of
commercial value In America which
cannot be found in this State, and we
have several not found in any other
State. I sincerely hope that the plan
may thrive."
WILL HELP
OUR STATE.
Supervisor Britt Says It Will
Reflect Great Credit on
California.
Supervisor Brlttâ The Call's sugges
tion to have an exposition in 1900 is de
cidedly a happy one - !t is a commend
able and praiseworthy object, and ev
ery man who has the interests of the
city at heart should have no hesitancy
In supporting it. I have always been
in favor of anything that will adver
tise this State, and there is no doubt
in my mind that the projected exposi
tion could be made to eclipse all former
efforts in that regard. Of course it will
take time and money, but there is
plenty of the first article and the sec
ond should be forthcoming in large
quantities, for everyone in this city
will be benefited by the exposition.
In regard to an appropriation from
the city and county by the Supervisors,
I believe that could be easily arranged,
but of course it would be a matter for
the consideration of the next Board of
Supervisor.", for an appropriation of
that kind by tax levy must be spent
within the fiscal year, and the present
board could only appropriate for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1899. As the
money would not be needed until 1900,
the next board no doubt could be pre
vailed upon to include in the tax levy
of that year sufficient for the purpose.
I say by all means let us have the ex
position, and let it be. a magnificent
affair and one that will reflect credit
on our fair State and outshine as the
day does the night any former attempt
of a similar nature.
TO BE GRAND
IN ITS SCOPE.
NoOne-Man Fairâ Site for Build-
ings Should Be Secured
at Once.
J. W. Raphael, of Raphael Bros. â I
believe it is eminently fit and proper
that the semi-centennial of the admis
sion of California into the Union should
be celebrated in some striking way, and
I heartily Indorse the movement in
augurated by The Call.
Let us have an exposition that will,
by Its greatness, attract to our State
many who had anticipated going to
Paris in 1900. Make it broad and grand,
no one man's fair, but bring together
the whole business community, let each
individual enter Into the proposition
with his or her whole heart, and let us
for once throw aside all petty jealousies
that may exist and work for the com
mon good. San Francisco is a great
city, but her natural advantages as a
business center have not been fully de
veloped. It will require a unity of ac
tion on the part of our business men.
We are ready to go right ahead. No
time should be lost in securing a site
for the buildings, which, in my Judg
ment, should be the handsomest possi
ble; entirely new in architectural de
sign. Let us break away from the
stereotype style in vogue so many
years. Let It be the beginning of a new
era of ideas â the commencement of do
ing business on a broader and more en
ergetic basis.

A. S. Baldwin, acting president of the
Merchants' Association, expressed him-

The Call deserves great credit for so
good a suggestion. We have recently
had a gratifying spectacle in the in
terest taken in the semi-centennial of
the discovery of gold in California, and,
notwithstanding the very short notice
and the necessarily limited work of
preparation, our recent jubilee was a
marked success. That undertaking
was, by comparison with this new
proposition, a trivial matter, engi-
neored on the spur of the moment, and
carried out with a rush, and while it
reflected great honor upon the city and
State the net result would be as noth
ing to the influence for good which
might be secured through so great an
enterprise as the one in contemplation,
if efficiently managed. It is a broad,
comprehensive planâ one in which
there may be no end of permanent ben
efit to the material interests of Califor
nia. I sincerely hope that the idea may
be acted upon, and have no hesitancy
in expressing the opinion that the Mer
chants' Association would heartily sup
port such an enterprise. It is right in
our line of business, and I am sure that
if the plan can be set on its feet the
association will be found eager to help
it along." _

LET IT BE A
BIG AFFAIR.
Co-operation of the Native Sons
.Suggested by Supervisor
Haskins.
Supevlsor Hasklnsâ l am glad that
The Call has been the first to take hold
of the proposition to have a Midsum
mer Exposition in 1900, for that af itÂ»*lf
will Insure its complete success. The
Native Sons are already making prepa
rations for an elaborate celebration of
Admission day in that year, and I am
sure that they will heartily co-operate
and aid in every way possible to make
the exposition a grand affair and one
worthy of our glorious State. Paris
will have an exposition in 1900, and if
we were to make ours cf sufficient in
terest who knows but many people who
intend going to Paris might be induced
to remain right here with us and enjoy
our own exposition.
I am in favor of any proposition that
will bring people to this Coast, and an
exposition of the kind contemplated by
The Call will bring more people here
than ever before in our history. It will
be necessary for every man to work
and work hard in order to assure the
successful consummation of the pro
posed venture, but we should all make
it our duty to put our shoulder to the
wheel, and I am positive that in 1900
we will have an exposition that will
excite the admiration of the world.
WILL GIVE
HIS SUPPORT.
Supervisor Delany Wants the
Exposition to Excel the
Midwinter Fair.
Supervisor Delany â I voice my ap
proval of The Call's proposition to cele
brate the semi-centennial of Califor
nia!s admission to the Union as a State
by a midsummer exposition in 1900. I
am positively in favor of this celebra
tion and will do all in my power as an
individual and as an official of this city
to carry the idea to a successful issue.
It is in line with The Call's progressive
policy to suggest the idea, and it should
be the desire of every citizen of this
community to lend not only his moral
but hia financial support to the affair
and I, for one, am perfectly willing to
do both.
Let it be an exposition that will sur
pass in magnitude our late Midwinter
Fair, for it will attract thousands of
people, and as a result business will
improve, and I am in favor of any
thing that will bring about a better
ment of trade. It is none too early to
begin preparations, for It will require
a mountain of work to assure complete
success.
STAND READY
TO ASSIST.
They Believe the Idea to Be the
Best That Could Possibly
Be Presented.
Shrevc & Co. â We will do all in our
power to make the proposition a suc
cess and stand ready to assist in any
way possible. The idea is the best that
could possibly be presented and will
unquestionably meet with enthusiastic
Indorsement from every business man
in this city.
The benefit to our city from a busi
ness standpoint can best be judged by
the results of the Midwinter Fair,
which, though held during a period of
business depression, resulted in great
MARK THE MILESTONES.
I am heartily in favor of any celebration or any
thing that contributes to the amusement of our peo
ple. I believe in marking the milestones of our pros
perity as we reach them, especially the milestone murk
ing fifty years of our Statehood. I don't know of a
State in the Union that can show such a record as our own
Golden State. Statistics show that the percapita profit
last year of each individual in the State of California is
greater than that of any State in the entire Union.
When an unsettled wilderness like California is taken
possession of by the Americans and in fifty years made
:o produce an income of $250,000,000 in one year, it is a re
cord that we can be proud of, and one to which we might
Ie willing to emphasize and attract the attention of our entire country,
emphasize and attract the attention of the world can only
>c done by an unusual celebration. The ordinary way of processions,
treet ornamentation and arches is too commonplace. The suggestion
nade by The Call of the exposition, first by a reproduction of the first
nission in California, and then by installing in that building, and, I
lope, in many other buildings which ought to be erected, a good ex
tibit of our natural resources to illustrate that progress, would carry
ut my ideas of something unusual.
I would suggest, in addition to the erection of these buildings,
inusual fetes of a character that would suit our climate, but different
rom anything we have had. Ido not care at present to go into de
aila, but if these ever materialize into anything and I have more
ime, I would make the suggestions. To properly carry these out
â very county should be interested. Our mining counties ought to form
t group of their own, then the various agricultural counties, then the
;reat metropolises and seaports should prepare commercial exhibits,
hen our manufacturing interests should have meetings and combine
o advance the exhibits of the products of the machines and the skilled
abor.
Yes, I heartily approve of The Call's suggestion and "hope it will con
inue its efforts until they are crowned with success.

profit to our State. So let us hold an
exposition in 1900â one that will bring
us still greater results.
"A GOOD IDEA,"
SAYS H. D. KEIL.
Possibilities for Good Far Be-
yond Those of the Mid
winter Fair.
Hugo D. Keil, chairman of the Com
mittee of Publicity and Promotion of
the Merchants' Association, was asked
his opinion of the proposition. "I like
the idea," said he. "It is a particu-
larly good one, and it could not have
been sprung at a better time. Business
is reviving in all lines and all sides,
and now is the time to outline plans for
future successes â for an individual or
a State. The proposed exposition
would be of inestimable benefit to this
city and to the whole State, and I
hope that the plan will be Carried out
as suggested by The Call. The recent
Midwinter Fair was of enormous bene
fit to California, and that enterprise
was conducted in a "hard times" peri
od. Then, too, it was our initial effort
in matters of this kind, and our next
endeavor in this way should be some
thing to excite the admiration of the
world. "We now have a ten-fold greater
opportunity than the Midwinter Fair
gave us, and I hope it will be taken
advantage of as The Call suggests.
MANY WOULD
VISIT HERE.
The Resources of the State
Would Be Advertised by
an Exposition.
Harry T. Creswellâ The Midwinter
Fair was of great benefit to the
State. An exposition, such as sug
gested by The Call, would undoubtedly
attract many, thousands of people here.
It would be an advertisement of the re
sources and greatness of California.
The benefits derived to the entire Pa
cific Coast from it would far exceed the
expense to citizens attending a credit
able exposition. The exposition should
be had.
NATIVE SONS
INTERESTED.
It Will Advertise to the World
the Great Resources of
Our State.
H. M. Holbrnok of Holbrook, Merrill
& Stetsonâ The proposition is a good
one, and will undoubtedly receive the
indorsement of every one having the
interest of the city at heart.
The benefits to be derived from such
an exposition as The Call announces la,
to my mind, far greater than many
people realize. It will advertise to Â£he
world the great resources of our State
and show the remarkable advancement
made in our industries during the past
fifty years. The movement should in
terest our Native Sons, who can by
their usual indomitable push do much
toward making the exposition a suc
cess.

SUISUX, Feb. 16.â Murderer Frank
Belew appeared in the Superior Court
before Judge Buckles at 10 o'clock to-
day for arraignment. He was brought
into court by Sheriff Rush, and, being
without counsel, was informed of his

thereupon asked him If he warned one,
and he replied, "Yes, sir." George A.

that no arrangements had been made
as regards his appearing for defendant.
He understood, however, that Reese

on a charge of obtaining money under
false pretenses, will be able to resume his
trip. A few days before he was to start
L-ewenstein got into a dice game with
Sigmund Salz. a real estate dealer at
Centerville, Alameda county, and won
$1147. Salz had him arrested on a charge
of obtaining money under false pretenses
and also attached seven large dogs and
two sleds and sued him for the amount.
The charge of obtaining- money under
false pretenses was dismissed a few days
later on examination, but it was not until
to-day that the other case was settled.
Judge Hyland granted a non-suit and

Woman Accuses J. Harry
Baird of Taeoma of
Bigamy.
Alleges That They Were Mar
ried in San Francisco
Years Ago.
His Present Wife Saves Him From
Going to Prison by Giving a Bond
for His Appearance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 16.â J. Harry Baird,
formerly a prominent real-estate and
mining broker here, has been arrested
for bigamy, the warrant having been
sworn out by Mrs. Mattie L. Baird,
who arrived yesterday from Waterloo,
lowa. He has given bonds for his ap
pearance at the hearing set for to-mor
row. Mrs. May Baird, whom he mar
ried two years ago, and her mother are
two of the three sureties. Baird claims
he was never married to Mattie Baird,
though they were known here as hus
band and wife for two years or more.
Mrs. Mattie Baird claims they were
joined by a contract marriage on Octo
ber 20, 1891, before a Justice of the
Peace, having an office on Market
street, San Francisco, opposite the Pal
ace Hotel. She claims their marriage
contract was drawn up by a lawyer in
accordance with the California Stat
utes, and that their certificate, as he
i calls a paper given them by the Jus
1 tice, was witnessed by the Justice and
a Â«Â£* broker galled
, ater Ba , rd obtained the ccr tincate
< from her and llever granted requests to
I return it.
I About two years ago MrsT Baird re
| turned to relatives in lowa. Subse
quent to her departure, Baird was mar
ried here by Justice Smalley to Miss
May Leonard, who now stands by him.
in October Mrs. Mattie Baird sent to
her attorney here two affidavits, sworn
! to In lowa, charging 1 Baird with big
| amy. The prosecuting attorney would
| not issue a warrant until convinced
j that she would come here to prosecute.
j she arrived yesterday and the warrant
I was speedily sworn out. Mrs. Baird's
attorney says that in support of her
claim they will produce the record of
j property transferred, which Baird and
| she signed as husband and wife, as well !
j as the testimony of some of the most
i respectable people in Tacoma that they
' lived as husband and wife and that he
acknowledged her as his wife. Evi
dence of the alleged contract marriage
in San Francisco has not yet been ob
tained, though, if obtainable, it may
become a very essential part of the
prosecution's case.
Mrs. Baird was Mattie L. Smith, sis
ter of Colonel James Smith, a promi
nent real-estate dealer, who com
mitted suicide about the time of their
marriage. She had considerable prop
erty in her own right and came into
possession of more on the death of her
brother. Baird was well thought of
here until this trouble came up.
RIO VERDE CANAL
COMPANY ELECTION.
The Result Practically Transfers the
Great Enterprise to Construc
tion Contractors.
PHOEXIX, Feb. 16.â A reorganization
of the Rio Verde Canal Company has
been effected In the election of the fol
lowing named officers: President, Donald
Grant; vice-president, A. H. Linton; sec
retary, J. K. Doolittle; treasurer, Frank
L. Conkey. The directors comprise Messrs.
Grant Linton and Conkey, P. P. Parker
S. C. Symonds, D. W. Grant and S. R. H
Robinson.
The election marks the practical trans
fer of the great enterprise to the men
by whom the construction contracts are
held. Messrs. Grant and Linton are the
noted contractors of Faribault and Min
neapolis, Donald Grant having lately
come Into international prominence
through a dispute as to the nation having
jurisdiction over his Venezuelan asphalt
beds. The Rio Verde project entails the
construction of about 100 miles of an Im
mense - anal and of several Huge storage
reservoirs, the cost estimate aggregating
about $4,000,000.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 16.â There has boen
bitter complaint among intending
Klondikers over the fact that miners'
certificates cannot be procured on
Canadian territory after crossing the
passes. At San Francisco, Portland,
Tacoma and Seattle, from which ports
vessels carry many thousands of pros
pectors every week, much dissatisfac
tion exists over the present require
ments. By reason of this complaint
Congressman James Hamilton Lewis of
Seattle was induced a few days ago to
travel from Washington to Ottawa in
the hope of procuring some concession
in the way of convenience to the men
who go north from the United States.
He made a strong request that certifi
cates to miners be issued at Tagish,
but without success.
The protests of the boards of trade
of "Victoria and Vancouver, backed up
by the representations of British Co
lumbia members of Parliament, have
had their effect. Information comes
that to-day the Dominion Government
decided not to make any addition to
places at which free miners' certificates
may be obtained. At present certifi
cates can only be procured at Victoria,
Vancouver and Dawson.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1898.
EVERY SIGN OF
BOLD JOBBERY
Is San Jose's Treasury to
Be Looted by Con
tractors?
Judge Kittredge Takes the Case
Against Councilmen Under
Advisement.
Questionable Terms of the Resolu
tion Awarding the City Street
Sweeping.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 16.â Arguments In
the rase of S. E. Smith against the
members of the Common Council of
San Jose were concluded to-day and
the matter was taken under advise
ment by Judge Kittredge. This is an
application for a writ of injunction to
prevent the Council from entering into
a contract for street sweeping with
Xash & McÃeynolds. It is charged
that if this contract be forced upon the
city it will mean the looting of the
city treasury to the extent of $4000 each
year for the period of three years, the
life of the proposed contract.
Some further peculiar things were de
veioped to-day in connection with this
matter. The form and substance of the
resolution, which was in fact the con
tract, differs radically from all pre
vious resolutions passed by the Coun
cil in relation to similar matters. It is
so drawn as to avoid the necessity of
the Mayor signing a contract on be
half of the city and also makes It pos
sible for the Council to enter into the
contract without the aid or approval of
the Mayor. This feature alone would
indicate that there was a job In it,
even if the bid of Nash & McÃeynolds
were not out of all proportion to all
the other bids.
Generally resolutions of this charac
ter simply award the contract and then
authorize the Mayor to enter into a
contract with the successful bidder. In
this case after the bids were opened
the whole matter was referred to the
street committee, consisting of Coun
cilmen Fay and Nolting. and this com
mittee recommended the action that
was subsequently taken by the Coun
cil. This is the resolution which the
Councjl passed by a unanimous vote,
which the Mayor vetoed and which the
Council has threatened to pass over the
Mayor's veto:
Resolved, By the Common Council of
the city of San Jose, that the contract for
sweeping the bitumen streets of the city
of San Jose, Cal., be awarded to Nash &
McÃeynolds according to specifications
now on file, and that the city of San Jose,
CaL, enter into a contract with Nash &
McÃeynolds for the term of three years
on the terms and conditions in said
specifications and notice to bidders and
the bid of Nash & McÃeynolds on file,
and that the city does hereby enter into
said contract with Nash & McÃeynolds
according to said specifications, notice to
bidders and bid, and agrees to pay said
Nash & McÃeynolds the sum of % .005252
fur each and every square yard during
each and every month for the term of
three years for streets that are to be
designated to be swept six times a week
by the Common Council, and the sum of
$ .002641 for each and every yard during
each and every month, for a term of
three years, for streets that are to be
designated to be swept three times a
week by the Common Council, less a dis
count of 2 per centum.
Another piece of jobbery is embodied
in the following clause of the specifica
tions: "The sweepings from said streets
shall be deposited every sweeping night
on the lot known as the 'brick hole,'
corner of Seventh and Keyes streets."
It is common report that the "brick
hole" is owned by a syndicate of gang
sters, among them being Johnnie Mac
kenzie. The last transfer of the prop
erty is not on record, and the reason
for not making public the ownership
of the property is plain when atten
tion is called to the fact that the dump
ing of the sweepings into the "brick
hole" for the past few years has con
verted what was denounced as a nui
sance into a piece of valuable city
property, owned by members of the
gang. The job in this provision of
the specifications is made the more re
prehensible because the sweepings have
a value and would find a ready sale.
The price for sweeping the streets
could also be materially lessened if the
haul to Seventh and Keyes streets were
not made a part of the contract. It
is estimated by competent men that a
saving of from $75 to $100 per month
could be made for the city by the omis
sion of this provision from the speci
fications.
When the Council agreed upon these
specifications they well knew that they
were playing into the hands of John
nie Mackenzie and his fellow-gang
sters, because the matter was made the
subject of an expose in The Call some
weeks ago.
As the State law requires that an
ordinance must be passed over the
Mayor's vote within thirty days after
the date of the veto to make such or
dinance valid, it is expected that Judge
Kittredge â will render his decision some
time before the 3d of March.
The matter of the electric fire alarm
system contract. In which an injunc
tion is also asked against the Council,
went over until the morning of Febru
ary 25.

STOCK IS OUT
OF THE FIGHT
Not the Candidate of Any
Party for Mayor of
San Jose.
Activity of the New Charter
Club Brings Dismay to
the Ring.
Special Meeting of the Grand Jury to
Take Up the Scully-Krieg
Bribery Charges.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 16.--Ever since it
was first announced that the taxpayers
of San Jose intended to put an anti
gang ticket in the field for the coming
election gossip has been busy with the
name of Frank Stock as the probable
candidate for Mayor of the ring. No
word was ever uttered against the in
tegrity of Mr. Stock, for he stands
with the best, business men In the com-
munity, but it was known that he was
favored with considerable patronage
from the county and it was feared that
he might let his gratitude to the gang,
which controls the county administra
tion as thoroughly as it does that of
this city, influence him sufficiently to
permit his name to head the ticket put
up in opposition to that of the New
Charter Club, and he was looked upon
as a formidable adversary by the op-
ponents of the ring.
It can now be said on the authority
of Mr. Stock himself that he is out of
the fight, and is out of it for good. In
he course of an interview to-day he
stated his position as follows: "I am
not a candidate for Mayor on any
ticket and will not be a candidate un
der any circumstances. It is true that
I have been spoken of as a probable
candidate for Mayor, and at one time
was inclined to listen to the pleadings
of my friends. Proper and thorough
consideration, however, has convinced
me that I cannot afford to go into a
public office that would in all likelihood
absorb most of my time. My business
affairs are such that all my time must
be given to them. I have my two
brothers as partners, nnd their inter
ests as well as mine must be consulted
In a matter of this kind."
On being asked what he thought of
the four gentlemen who have been
mentioned as candidates for the May
oralty by the New Charter Club and its
friends he answered that any one of
them would make a first class Mayor.
He added that he believed there ought
to be a change in the municipal admin
istration which would bring about
cheaper and better government, and
that he believed the present movement
with this object in view would prove a
success.
It was learned tn-day that there if
to be a special meeting of the Grand
Jury on Friday to take up the matter
of the Scully-Kriecr bribery charges. It
was first thought best to wait until the
Council concluded its investigation, but
from the reputation that all the mem
bers of the Council have succeeded in
establishing for themselves â¢ not much,
it was felt, could be expected from
them in the way of throwing light on
the scandal. Their work will most
likely partake of the whitewashing or
der. It will not surprise many if all
the members of the Council are event
ually made the subjects of investiga
tion by the Grand Jury.

Not LikÂ»!y That Improvements Will
Be Made In San Francisco
Bay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. Feb. 16.
Congressman JTllborn says that he be
lieves the sundry civil appropriation bill
will carry a large appropriation for Oak
land harbor, and it is probable that
money will be appropriated to carry on
the work for two years instead of one
year. The limit of cost is $680,000. There
fore if money Is appropriated for two
years' work the amount should be $340,
000. and this will include the tidal canal
project.
Congressman Loud will endeavor to se
cure the appropriation for the removal
of obstructions In San Francisco harbor,
though a seems doubtful at this time
whether there will be any river and har
bor bill at this session. The appropria
tion cannot be included in the sundry Qivil
bill, which only provides for carrying out
contracts already made by the War De
partment; therefore, if there is no riveT
and harbor bill this appropriation will
not be made, and "yen though a river and
harbor bill is passed it is considered
doubtful whether provision will be made
for the removal of these rocks, as the
estimate of cost submitted by the engi
neers was greatly in excess of all expec
tations.

CLOVERDALE'S
CITRUS FAIR
Exhibits Will Eclipse Those of
Any Former Year in
Every Respect.
Balmy Spring Weather Prevails and
the Attendance Promises to
Be La rye.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLOVE RDALE. Cal., Feb. 16.â The
Citi ua Fair Pavilion is the magrnetic
center toward which at present all
things Cloverdaleian are irresistibly
drawn, and commencing with to-mor
row the influence will reach even unto
the great metropolis and farther points,
making this pretty town a second
Lourdes the next few days. The or
ange and lemon held their carnival
in the streets to-day. Almost every
vehicle within ten miles was used to
transport the golden fruit to its tem
porary home, where it will be admired
by thousands.
The pavilion is a scene of tremen
dous activity to-night. Every foot of
space is taken, every one of the exhib
itors is hard at work and some will
have to work all night. The decora
tions are beautiful, especially the
booths consisting of the tamale, orange,
candy and restaurant. The art booth
is elaborately and artistically decorated
under the supervision of Mrs. C. E.
Humbert.
An encouraging feature of this year's
fair is the many large exhibits. Much
expense is attached to them and they
are uniQue and attractive. The minia
ture Call building looms up fifteen feet
high above the table and is the ad
miration of all. An electric fountain
will be an interesting exhibit. Other
leading attractions will be an exact
size Roman chariot, a Japanese pa
goda, a mission church, a grotto built
solidly of oranges, large pyramids,
etc.
Preston, pretty village of the . hills,
is going to make a large collective ex
hibit. The Italian Swiss colony, Clov
erdale Wine Company, Moulton Hill
Vineyard Company and W. D. Sink will
exhibit wines. The olive, deciduous
and dried fruits will be well repre
sented. Olive oil of local manufac
ture will be in great prominence.
The Ukiah Glee Club will be the cen
ter of attraction Saturday afternoon
and evening. The programme for the
opening night will be a concert by the
Cloverdale band of sixteen pieces, in
troductory, remarks by G. W. Hoyle of
Cloverdale and an oration by Hon. C.
H. Pond of Healdsburg.
Regular citrus fair weather prevails,
balmy and clear. ' Almond trees are
in bloom and budding trees foretell the
arrival of beautiful spring. The bus
iness houses are bedecked with carni
val â orange, green and white.
The â  fair in general artistic excellence
number of exhibits and quality of
oranges and lemons will far exceed last
year's. _^

'HI i IlJ^. â^ a >^ 18 Market st *Â» san Francisco, Calk i
I am acquainted with the case of the wife of a house paSnter If
Brooklyn, who had the grip, and was confined to the house for three
months. She was in a listless state and suffered terribly with nausea,
It so happened that a friend had given some Ripans Tabules to thil
lady's sister who had suffered from indigestion, and as they did her so
much good she thought she would try them on Mrs. Hill, feeling sure
that if they did her no good they would at least do no harm. The
patient was then in the hands of her physician, but soon she was so
much better that her neighbors noticed the change and asked about
it. . She then said that she had changed her doctor, and laughingly
added, my new doctor is colored â chocolate color. It seems that as
soon as she began to take the Tabules, she began to mend. The
nausea disappeared and she began to feel that the future still had
days of sunshine m store for her.

Colnon's Strange Admission When Asked
Why Justice Was Refused a Con=
tractorâ Dundon's Erasures.
"I ani so tied up to these other
folks that I can't help you just
now, but I may help you later
on."
Harbor Commissioner Colnon's
explanation to Samuel C. Irving,
manager of the Paraffine Paint
Company, for giving all the work
of preparing piles to his favorites
and refusing to give any patron
age to the Paraffine people.
Pamuel C. Irving, manager of the
Paraffine Paint Company, whose ac
tion agatnet the Board of State Har
bor Commissioners has attracted so
much attention among the politicians
and taxpayers of late, was tha princi
pal witness yesterday before Judge
Belcher. He told of many things in
connection with the way the Commis
sioners are accustomed to doing busi
ness. P\ F. Dundon, of the firm of
Darby Laydon & Co., and A. H. Cole,
the bookkeeper for the S. E. Slade
Lumber Company, were also examined
as to the meanings of a number of en
tries in the books of the companies
mentioned. The amount of ignorance
displayed as to the reason for many
suspicious erasures in matters of im
portance left much for the court and
the spectators to guess at.
Mr. Irving began bj f stating his po
sition in the paint and preserving firm
and the responsibility of the stock
holders thereof, and then he got down
to the subject under consideration, the
peculiar manner of the Commissioners
in letting out contracts to their fa
vorites and shutting out competition of
those not in favor.
The witness had hardly made a start
before the attorney for the Harbor
Commissioners began making excep
tions, to preserve the interests of his
clients. Mr. Irving testified that the
Paraffine Paint Company was amply
in a financial way to carry out
â  ;>rms of the contract bid on. and
lie BO stated in the open session of
ard. He added:
On the 16th of December, while the
rd was considering: for the third time
rceptance or rejection of these bids.
: - â  .:â  and stated to the board that the
Paint Company was the lowest
.: we wanted the contract;
we were amply able to perform the
the contract was awarded
to us -are would accept it. provide ail ;
- r.-cessary and start in at once and I
c work to completion with due j
Had you made any arrangements to se
a creosote plant?
I had made arrangements and so in
formed the board.
Were you in a position to have per
formed the contract under any of the
methods or each of the methods described
in those specifications?
I looked very carefully into all the
W methods provided for in that speciflca-
T tion and found there was nothing to pre
vent my bidding on each and every
method; that is. there were not, so far
as my knowledge went, any legal or
patent arrangement that prevented me
bidding on those methods as set forth in
those specifications.
The witness said that he had de
manded that the contract be awarded
to his company, but the bids were all
rejected He talked with several of
the member? <>f the board about the
using of creosote for preserving piles
and added:
I called at the office of the board. Mr.
in was thf-re. and I had a number
- giving the result of
the- us â â¢ elsewhere. I told Mr.
m my business, nm 1 . Mr. Colnon told
me ho didn't want to hear anything about
it: that his mind was made up, and that
â  It. That conversation was
oslve; it only lasted prob
ably four or five minutes.
Mr... Irving also testified that he was
nt when bids for furnishing piles
opened, and that the board at
tempted to overlook a bid put in by
. Tibbitts & Co., the latter firm
not standing in favor with the Com
missioners.
Coming back to the pile-preserving
i tract Mr. Irving said that in the
bids rejected a nice little game was
"xiÂ»'Â«ed to keep the Paraffine Paint
Company out of the field. A man named
Watson of the Pacific Roofing Com
pany had an imitation of the Paraffine
Company's process, and Dundon had
another similar imitation, and Watson
and Dundon combined to cut off the
Paraffine Company at both ends.
'"orning hack to the virtues of creo
for the purpose named the wit
said that he had called the atten
tion of the board to ir>o creosoted piles
under' one arm of the ferry slips. He
said in this connection:
They were creosoted by the Pacific Im
provement Company I think during the
Buperintendency of Mr. Isaacs. These
were driven in IS9I or 18y2 and they
were badly eaten out by the limnoria. I
called that fact to the attention of the
board, and asked them to go with me to
investigate. These piles wore BUpposed
to have been extra well creosoted. But I
never could pf-t any member of the board
to go with niÂ»- to look at them. These
piles were creosoted about fourteen
pounds to the cubic foot.
Mr. Copt â Fourteen pounds of creosote
to a cubic foot of timber?
Yes, sir.
Did you go yourself?
I went myself on several occasions; and
one time I invitedâ l met down there one
of the employes of the board and invited
him to go with me. He was Mr. Uhlig.
This matter, too, was brought to the
attention of the board, and Mr. Colnon
-Simplay said: "We will investigate,"
and there it ended. At this point At
torney Cope changed the subje:t and
asked:
Did you know that the San Francisco
Timber Preserving Company had threat
ened to enjoin the Paraffine Company if
it were awarded a contract to creosote
piles?
I so understood, yes.
At this Attorney Stratton put Jn a
strong objection to this line of testi
mony. Mr. Cope defended hia courso
by saying:
This is one of the matters that goes to
the general benefit of the public We
have alleged that these specifications
were in such form that persons other
than the San Francisco Timber Preserv
ing Company would not venture to bid
upon them. That is the last set of speci
fications. And one of the reasons was
that the San Francisco Timber Preserv
ing Company threatened to enjoin any
body else from creosoting, and the par
t far provision was put in the speci
â¢ions which would make it very dan
gerous for any person to undertake ihn
work and have to stand an injunction
suit. Under the first set of specifications
referred to in our complaint Mr. Irving,
for the Paraffine Paint Company, was
perfectly willing to have undertaken the
work and to have taken the chances of
an injunction, being confident that he
could have beaten it:
The court overruled the objection
and the witness resumed, saying: "I
was informed that Mr. Dundon and Mr.
Rood had been up to see Mr. Stratton,
and told him that they would enjoin
the Paraffine Paint CoTrrpany if they
were awarded the contract from going
ahead with the work. I was informed
by aji official connected with the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners.
The witness stated that there were
others desirous of bidding on the pile
preserving work, but they were shut
out for the same reasons â fear of be
ing enjoined. Several of these had good
methods.
The matter of the specification was
taken up to show how the board had
fenced off the outsiders, and on this
Mr. Irving said:
The specifications were to my mind
very unfair, and I so informed Major
Harney and Mr. Oolnon. I told them that
there were provisions put in those speci
fications that had never occurred before,
and that were all together unjust. In
stead of covering a year's work plus
Green-street wharf, they were simply
made for Green-street wharf: and while,
for a year's work and Green-street wharf,
it would have been a paying proposition
for us to have set up a oreosoting plant,
for a small job like that it would not
have been.
I, moreover, in that conversation, called
their attention to the fact that the patent
PRETTY WOMEN PLAY AT GOLF ON THE PRESIDIO LINKS.
Miss Alice Hoffman Winning the First Series of the Ladies' Tour
naments of the San Francisco Club.
AN ideal day blessed the lady srolf
ers of the San Francisco Club on
yesterday. After the past few
disagreeable days a bright sun,
with a bracing breeze sweeping across
the Presidio Links, made perfect
weather for the devotees of the game
that the modern Anglomaniac has bor
rowed from his English cousins. Yes
terday's match was the first one of the
ladies' tournament, to be played for the
Silver Scratch medal, and of the six
ladies who entered, Miss Alice Hoff
man was an easy winner, making the
eighteen holes over a three-mile course,
a distance of 4274 yards, in 119 strokes,
not including her handicap of ten,
whir-h is a remarkably few number of
strokes for that distance for a lady.
numbers had been attached to our pro
cess and to the Rood process, but had
been omitted from the creosote process,
although I had seen those numbers in the
rough draft. When Mr. Uhlig, I think it
was, telephoned up to our office for us
to get the numbers of our patent, 1 went
down and saw him and told him that I
would not have our patent numbers in
serted in the specifications because 1 un
derstood the law did not allow the pur
chase of a patented article. Mr. Uhlig
informed me that if those numbers were
not inserted our method would not be in
cluded in the specifications; and to show
roe that everybody was l>eing treated
alike, he showed me the rough draft with
the patent numbers attached to the creo
suting.
Attorney Cope asked if there wore
any other reasons why the Paralhne
Paint Company was deterred from bid
ding under the last set of specifications
and the witness replied:
It would be absolutely impossible to do
the work called for in those specifications
under the creosoting method in the time
called for, and do the work properly.
The witness gave considerable testi
mony relative to the merits of treating
piles by the creosoting process, and he
repeated much information that h-? had
imparted to the Harbor Commissioners
from such authorities as Marsdcn
Manson, former engineer of the board;
Professor L. J. Le Conte of the State
University, Lum Sears, U. S. A.; Colo
nel Mendal, U. S. A., and others, all of
whom pronounced this process a fail
ure. The result of their observations
and experience were read to the court,
as they had been to the members of
the board, together with ex-president's
report on work cm the Nicaragua canal.
The president's report was indeed
strong, for he said:
The pier constructed by the canal com
pany for the purpose of securing an en
trance, as built December, 1892, May,
1893. The pier timber and piling: were
creosoted with sixteen pounds of wood
oil to the cubic foot, but this proved un
availing as a protection from the teredo,
and when examined in May, 1895. the
piles ir-ear the outer end were found to
have been badly eaten, and many of the
channel side had disappeared.
The reports of the other experts were
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1898.
read. The purpose of their introduc
tion was to show that the Board of
Harbor Commissioners had decided to
adopt the creosoting treatment for the
piles of the State in the face of the
knowledge imparted to them that the
treatment was a flat failure; and fur
ther to show that had the State Har
bor Commlsioners not adopted this pro
cess and worded their speciflcatt. ns
with cinch clauses to keep as many as
possible from bidding on the creosote
proposition, they would not have been
able to hand over the job to the water
front combine, which had no other pro
cess upon which it could rely with
safety; and, further, that the favor
ing of the combine in this way has
cost the taxpayers of the State thou
sands of dollars in the replacing of
piles that should have lasted for years.
After some testimony concerning the
extent of the Parafflne company's" busi
ness and the promise by Mr. Irving to
show Attorney Stratton the firm's
books the witness, in reply to a ques
tion stated that the paraffine method of
treating piles is from 25 to 50 per cent
cheaper than creosoting.
Once more the matter of conversa
tions with Commissioner Colnon was
brought up and Mr. Irving said he had
at least a hundred with that official,
and added:
I told Mr. Colnon, not in one, but in
many of these conversations, that I could
not understand why we could not get any
work. There was no objection to our
process and our price was certainly
lower than thnt of any of the others. I
called his attention to the fact that the
Rood process wns an old worn-out pro
cess that had been abandoned here years
ago when used as the Vulcan pile armor
process. The State had spent about $80.
000 in probably eighteen months and the
piles were gone in probably two years fol
lowing. Also the fact that it was the
old Culver process which had been tried
and was a failure, and yet in spite of
aH that Rood could get work and I could
not. I told him if he could find me any
report from any of his engineers or could
get a report to the effect that our cover
ing was a failure I would not ask him
for any more work.
Some time last year, while the other
firms were getting considerable work and
I was not getting any, I said to Mr.
Colnon, "Why is it we don't get any
thing?" His reply to me was this; he
said: "Irving. I am so tied up to these
other folks that I can't give you work
now, but it may be that I can* give you
some later."
When Dundon resumed his testimony
relative to the condition of the books
of the San Francisco Timber Preserv
ing Company, he took up the thread
of his evidence in a decidedly weary
fashion. His attention was called to
nearly a dozen entries In the journal
of checks drawn in favor of "cash" and
Miss F. A. Sprague was second with
138 strokes, and a handicap of six,
which is also a most excellent record.
Even allowing for Miss Sprague's large
handicap, Miss Hoffman was easily
entitled to first honors. Two prizes
were awarded â a silver jewel case and
a handsomely lacquered cologne bot
tle.
There will be another tournament
next month and the concluding one
will be held next November. In or
der to obtain the silver medal it will
be necessary for Miss Hoffman to win
three successive tournaments.
The play of yesterday was fast and
excellent, and the links were dotted
from start to finish during the three
hours of the contest. The play began
delivered to him. These ranged from
$250 to $500. To the best of his recol
lection these amounts were for his
salary. But there were erasures in
these same entries, the sharp edge of
a knife having removed from the paper
the cold records of transactions that
some one wished to hide from the eyes
of the world. The witness could, not
or would not explain why these era
sures had been made, nor what record
had been thus removed. Neither did
he know when they had been made and
he even went so far as to say that he
was sorry for it; and then Attorney
Cope induced him to acknowledge that
the erasures must have been recently
made. He stated that while he has
full access to the books of his firm and
occasionally makes settlements with
his partner, he is sadly ignorant of the
meaning of a great many entries.
A. H. Cole, bookkeeper for the S. E.
Slade Lumber Company, was called and
his attention directed to the erasures in
the books of the other concern, in
which he had made a few entries, but
he knew nothing, he said, of the ob
literations.
The next witness was J. J. Keegan,
clerk of the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners. He told of a conversation
in the board rooms between Attorney
Stratton and the Commissioners rela
tive to a proposition to compromise the
case of the Pacific Pine Lumber Com
pany against the board. The former
sought to restrain the board from pay
ing to the Slade Lumber Company the
sum of $12,000. Keegan stated that on
that occasion Attorney Stratton told
the board that Jordan and Herrick of
the Pacific Pine Lumber Company had
to-ld him that they would like to com
promise the suit, and proposed that if
the board give them 75 per cent of the
lumber trade, all of the shingle and all
of the pile trade for two years they
would abandon the suit. Mr. Rtratton
at once informed the board of the prop
osition and advised against the com
promise.
Mr. Keegan was questioned as to thÂ«
monthly income of the Harbor Com
mission, which he said was about $55,
000 a month, or $600,000 a year. This
comes from dockage, etc. The ex
penses consume much of this amount,
so that he does not send more than
$14,000 to $30,000 per month to the State
harbor sinking fund at Sacramento. A
long time ago he occasionally sent as
high as $40,000 to Sacramento. The ex
penses of late have been very heavy.
Mr. Irving will be cross-examined to
day by Attorney Stratton.

DAIRYMEN
PROTESTING
Want to Be Treated as
Those of Outside
Counties.
Health Board Will Hold a
Special Meeting on the
Subject.
New Positions Created â Samples
of Water Were Found
Impure.
The Board of Health has called a
special meeting for Tuesday morning,
March 1, to decide whether or not to
quarantine milk from out-lying coun
ties where it is shown that the cows
have not been subjected to the tubercu
lin test. The matter was brought up
at the regular meeting of the board
yesterday through a petition from the
San Francisco dairymen, who asked
that no further test of their cows be
made unless those of adjoining counties
were put through a like ordeal. It
was decided to ask representatives
from San Mateo County and Marin
County as well as General Dickinson,
the representative of the local dairy
men, to be present at a special meeting
to be held on the date mentioned.
Th board proceeded to create quite
a number of additions to the employes
now on the payroll. It was decided to
appoint two matrons for the Park Re
ceiving Hospital at salaries of $60 per
month each. The night job was given
to Mrs. Swett and the day job to Mrs.
Brown. Health Officer A. P. O'Brien
rendered a report stating that in view
of the increased clerical work of the
pure food department now under his
control it would be necessary to have
a new clerk and he named John F. Der
ham for the place at a salary of $100
per month. The appointment was
made. B. Posner was elected janitor
of the department, to take the place of
the present janitor, who has been pro
moted to a clerkship.
Dr. E. S. Howard sent in a communi
cation to the board, stating that he had
rented the offices recently occupied by
the late Dr. James 1. Stanton, and that
he would therefore be compelled to re
sign his position as Assistant Police
Surgeon.
It was decided to recommend to the
Board of Supervisors that the right of
way through a strip of land at Eigh
teenth and Urana streets be purchased
for the purpose of making more per
fect sewer connections.
The drafting of the gas order, based
on the measure proposed by Supervisor
Lackmann, was completed. The lines
of the original order was followed and
the presence of more than five per cent
of carbon monoxide in illuminating gas
is prohibited.
Secretary Godchaux reported that the
receipts from plumbers' licenses, per
mits and journeymen cards had
amounted to $1278 and that the attor
ney of the board was preparing an
opinion whether or not the money
should be returned to the plumbers.
Chemist Wenzel reported that the
samples of water brought from the
house of J. H. Crocker at Washington
and Laguna streets for chemical analy
sis were decidedly dangerous to health,
and that measures should be taken to
remedy the matter. It was found that
the samples came from the Lafayette
square reservoir.
John L. Sullivan was appointed an
assistant food inspector at a salary of
$75. John Wagner was appointed a
night watchman at the City and Coun
ty Hospital at a salary of $35 per
month.
Dr. Morse called attention to the im
portance of urging the Board of Free
holders to make provision in the new
charter for increased powers for the
Board of Health in the matter of sani
tary legislation.
LAW TOOK ITS COURSE.
August Ãbhobt Sorry He Ignored a
Summons.
August Ãbhobt wanted to go to the
Klondike and was anxious to raise the
money on his property. He had nearly
made a sale of it, but a search at the
court house showed that there was a big
cloud on his title to the extent of a judg
ment amounting to about $700. The un
happy state of affairs was caused by a
little contempt for the law that may yet
prove expensive.
Some time ago Ãbhobt borrowed heavily
from J. D. Carroll and gave his note for
the amount. Time went by and Carroll
died without making any effort to col
lect his money. His executors, however,
were more practical, and Rose M. Car
roll brought suit against Ãbhobt. The
summons was served duly, but Mr. Ãb
hobt declined to pay any attention. He
wastnot at all pleased that suit was
brought and concluded that as he heard
no more about it his Indignation had been
defense enough.
Nothing more was thought about the
matter till Ãbhobt wanted to raise
money to co north. At the County
Clerk's office the record of the judgment
was found to the gold-seeker's surprise
and annoyance. The case had been reg
ularly tried, service of summons proved
and judgment given by default.
NOT A NEW POINT.
Decision of the Collector -Denying
Admission to an Alien Cannot
Be Reviewed by the Courts.
The decision of United States Judge
Hanford at Tacoma, published in The
Call of yesterday, to the effect that the
courts have no lawful authority to review
the decision of the Collector of the Port
or other Federal official denying admis
sion to an alien, is not a new point, as.
many unfamiliar with the subject might
believe. The decision of a Collector ad
mitting an alien can be overturned by a
court but his decision denying admission
cannot be reviewed except by the Sec
retary of the Treasury, whose decision
is fina'.
A similar opinion was rendered in the
Circuit Court for the Southern District of
New York in re Moses on habeas corpus.
The act of August IS. 1594, provided that:
"In every case where an alien is excluded
from admission into the United States
under any law or treaty now existing or
hereafter' made, the decision of the ap
propriate immigration or customs officers,
if adverse to the admission of such alien,
shall be final unless reversed on appeal
to the Secretary of the Treasury."
For Sailors' Wages.
Robert Vogel, V. B. Evarts, Hermann
Frenz and John Svenson filed a libel in
the United States District Court yester
day against R- A. Gilbriile and others of
the schooner Christina Steffens to recover
$69 alleged to be due them as wages.
The Government's Domain.
The Commissioner of the General Land Office
has submitted his report to the Secretary of
the Interior. Compared with last year, it
shows a decrease of 329S homestead entries,
aggregating; 378, 625 acres. Quite proportionate
to this is the falling oft in general health
when no effort is made to reform irregularit>
of the bowels. This can easily be accom
plished with the aid of Hostetter's Stomacti
Bitters, also a remedy for malaria, dyspepsia,
rheumatism and liver trouble.

Troubles of J. M. Van Hill,
a Would-Be Klon
diker.
Locked in a Cellar Three Hours
and Robbed of His
Coin.
Police Gave Him No Assistanceâ He
Threatens to Commit Sui
cide.
J. M. Van Hill, a Chicagoan who is
now in this city, after an ineffectual
attempt to reach the Klondike, tells a
strange story of how strangers are
treated in Seattle. He landed in the
northern town with $600 in his pockets,
and now threatens to commit suicide
because he has not enough money to
return to his native place. Van Hill is
an educated German, who speaks sev
eral languages, but is apparently not
over-well versed in the ways of the
world.
"I have been on a tour of the world,"
said Van Hill yesterday, "and, hearing
of the Klondike excitement while in
Australia, started for Seattle for the
purpose of fitting out and going into
the gold fields.
"When I landed there it seemed to
me that every establishment in the
town was labeled 'Klondike outfits.' I
selected one place where fur coats were
advertised for sale cheap, and inquired
the price of the garments. I was told
that the proprietor would be back in a
few moments, and while I waited sev
eral men came in and proposed a game
of cards.
"I was not In a mood for gambling,
and started to leave, but the men in
sisted that I should stay and wait for
the proprietor. While my back was
turned to them for the purpose of ex
amining some fur garments I was
seized, gagged and carried into the
basement of the place. Here I was kept
for three hours, and every dollar I
possessed, amounting to over $600, was
taken from me, and I was kicked into
the street.
"I applied to the Seattle police, and
a couple of officers accompanied me to
the place where I had been robbed. I
afterward learned that it was a no
torious gambling-house. I could see no
one who resembled the men who robbed
me, and I was told by the police that I
was dreaming and that my story was
false.
"After trying several days to get re
dress, a number of charitably inclined
people assisted me with money to reach
San Francisco, where I hoped to find
friends who -will help me back to Chi
cago. I am stranded here, and unless
I find employment soon I will take my
own life rather than face the poverty
to which I have never been accus
tomed."
J. C. Nobmann Attached.
John C. Nobmann. doing business at
2029 and 2031 Fillmore street, called a
meeting of his creditors at the Board of
Trade yesterday, morning for the purpose
of adjusting the attachment against him.
He made a statement showing that his
assets, including stock and fixtures and
outstanding 'accounts, amounted to $11,
000, and in addition there may be some
equity in real estate. His liabilities are
$16,320. The attachment was brought by
the estate of H. D. Barr for borrowed
money. The amount is $1500. The mat
ter was placed in the hands of a commit
tee of the creditors, and subsequently a
bill of sale of all the assets was made to
J. Lev! Jr. of H. Levi & Co., for the
benefit of all the creditors pro rata,
provided that Nobmann is released from
all attachments.

Nature Play for Children.
Miss Amalie Hofer delivered a lecture
yesterday at 921 Ninth street on "Nature
Play."
The audience was composed mostly of
kindergarten workers, as Miss Hofer's
address was directed chiefly to them. She
spoke of the way that people should edu
cate their children that they might know
nature and that they might love it.
She pointed out the beautji in the dif
ferent lessons that the children learrtt
in the kindergarten, and compared the
little children growing up to flowers in
the garden.
She said that more trust should he
placed with the children that they might
be alone and commune with nature,
"for as we grow older," she said, "we
would not have the time to pass with it
and we would not know all the beauties
it holds."

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate maximum temperature
for the days: those underneath it. If any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in inches
and imndredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" mÂ°ans high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is hieh in the interior and low
alone the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south al^ng the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im-
Fr â 'able. With a "hiph" in the vicinity of
daho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce, an
â¢-â¢â¢ result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16.â Trading was remarka
bly feverish on the Stock Exchange to-day and
all interest centered In the disaster to the
Maine in Havana harbor and in possible inter
national consequences. It cannot be said that
â  the varying phases of the speculation during
the day represented any change of opinion as
to the very grave posslbilties with which the
disaster Is pregnant. The occasional checks
to the downward course of prices were rather
the results of questions in the minds of large
operators as to their ability to hold the market
or the best way to effect the liquidation of
â  their holdings. Twice during the day very
powerful support was forthcoming in the mar
ket to rheck the decline and to combat the
successive raids of the hears. That there was
very large short selling during the day was
â¢vident from the strength of the rallies caused
by the covering of shorts when the turning
point at the low level was reached. This wan
particularly noticeable in some of the greatest
favorites of recent speculation, which have
been pushed up to prices hardly warranted by
their intrinsic value. The knowledge possessed
by the bears of very heavy speculative hold
ings in those stocks covered by light margins
gave them confidence In fiercely selling them
down. The rapport of the hulls no sooner
effected a check to the decline than realizing
offers began to come out again. There was an
abundant suDply of long stock fed : into the
market all day long, and it was evident that
the bulls had abandoned an immediate cam
paign for a rise as hopeless. How far the
speculative holdings for a rise were liquidated
to-day remains to be Been. It is sufficiently
evident, however, that as soon an this liqui
dation can be concluded prices of securities
will be left for the time being to their natural
level. Stocks which have been free from the
recent manipulation for a rise were compara
tively firm to-day and the so-called Klondike
group, notably Oregon Short Line, was even
aggressively strong, rising at one time 6 points
This was on reports of the large traffic open
Ing up for Alaska. Great Northern preferred
gained 2 points and Denver preferred also ral
lied to last night's level before the close
Otherwise the weakness of stocks was only a
question of degree. Net declines of 2 points
and upward are very numerous all through the
list.
Bonds were heavy In sympathy with stocks,
but declines were not bo severe and. the mar
ket was not so active as that for stocks

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stork
markets here were dull. Americans were flat
on the disaster to the battleship Maine. The
disposition here Is to regard the matter as a
lamentable accident, but it Is feared the United
States may think otherwise. Anyhow, it Is
recognized that the disaster may serve tempo
rarily as a fresh incentive td the Jingo party,
and for this reason the marnet, after a small
rally, closed at the worst. The incident has re
vealed one fact, at least, namely, that the bull
account here is much largi-r than had been
suppled. Amsterdam has Joined In selling.
At the same time there has also been buying
of a distinctly good kind.
Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific were
sympathetically flat. Copper was strong, sta
tistics again showing small supplies. Rio
Tintos was brought from Berlin.
NEW YORK WHEAT MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16.â Developments in
wheat late this afternoon were of a somewhat
sensational character. After fighting the hard
ening tendency all day the local crowd was
finally cornered and forced to pay a sharp ad
vance in the last ten minutes of the session,
jumping prices to 99% c Tor May, with a
subsequent rise to II OO^i on the curb. Attend
j ing this bulge was the news to-day that wheat
; in Chicago had been elevated to $1 M'j. Neither
â  cables nor home crop news had any material
influence upon to-day's market. The Havana
disaster was equally without effect, although
naturally creating a profound impresHion on
'''hange. Coarse grains were much stronger,
particularly corn, which advanced about a cent
a bushel. Export interest was retarded by the
sensational advances. July wheat showed par
ticular strength on covering and closed 2<Â£Hc
higher than last night, while February and
March closed \%G2c higher, May closing offi
cially at 1 cent advance.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Feb. 16.â Trouble for shorts in
Wheat was Indicated on the curb before the
regular opening. May was bid up to $1 00 on
rumors of large engagements of Wheat for
shipment to Lisbon and talk of a reduction
of the Portugal grain duty. The bullish feel-
Ing was greatly Increased by interviews re
garding the European situation by a prominent
Chicago trader who has been traveling in Eu
rope, in which he confirmed the reports of al
most unprecedentedly small stocks and said
that Europe was dependent on the United
States for her supplies. â¢ Opening â  prices foÂ»
May Wheat ranged from 99% c to $1 00, ; com
pared with yesterday's closing price : of 99%@
99% c. There was a perfect rush of shorts for
cove* at once, but as was the case yesterday
almost no Wheat was offered for sale. . Inside
of fifteen minutes bids had been raised to
$1 01V4. This was above call price and for the
.first time Wheat came on the market in con
siderable quantities, mostly offerings against
these privileges. Though everything offered
was taken, prices sagged off to $1 00*4 and the
excitement which had been intense died down
to a certain extent. It was evident the trade
was thoroughly alarmed over the apparently
unshakable hold Joseph Letter has on May-
Wheat and an official announcement that he
has ' contracted for the moving =â  of 1 600 000
bushels of his Wheat to the seaboard with the
promised movement of 8,000,000 bushels more,
served to increase the anxiety of shorts to get
cut. Tula in fact atemed to be the only factor

in trading. Apparently no attention was given
to the news of the blowing up of the battlesh!|.
Maine and the usual news was colorless. Liver
pool was %@%d higher at the close. The day's
clearances from Atlantic ports amounted to
300.000 bushels. For some time the market
fluctuated nervously on a narrow amount of
trading, but about noon it commenced to ad
vance again and on this advance outsiders
made their influence felt. Traders who have
been heavy sellers here against purchases in
New York were forced to unstraddle ; North
west shorts also came into the market and
helped make things Interesting. About half an
hour from the close July, which for some time
past has been comparatively neglected, jumped
Into sudden activity. It had previously been
lagging at around S6%e, but heavy buying sent
prices flying. At the close July had advanced
to B;<4c. May in the meantime had been bid
up to*sl 03%, and was bringing $1 03% as the
closing bell sounded. On the curb, after thÂ«
regular session, it sold as high as $1 054-
There was another big day in Corn and the
market was strong. Sympathy with Wheat
and a heavy demand from shorts sent prices
up sharply.
Oats were fairly active and irregular though
averaging strong.
Provisions were active. Heavy receipts of
Hogs gave the market a weak start, but the
heavy advance in grain, the demand especially
from shorts increased and prices gradually
rallied.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. Feb. IB.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the wool
market: The dullness has Become greatly in
tensified. The mills, which consume 10,000,000
pounds or more of wool a year, are all out of
the market, and the small concerns In the
very nature of things could not make a demand
sufficient to keep the volume of transactions at
the figures which were reported a few weeks
ago.
The mills are now busy working up fente
tariff wool In order, aa one manufacturer Bays,
to save the interest on it. In otner words, the
mills are showing a fair profit on their goods
to-day because they are making them from
free wool. Some of them have already obtain
ed three months orders and some have
enough to keep them running until the end of
August.
On a market as dull aa the present It Is, of
course, impossible to maintain prices all along
the line. The sales of the week amount to
1,086,200 pounds domestic and 868,280 pounds of
foreign, making a total of 2,674,460, against a
total of 3,115,000 pounds for the previous week.

ON RECORD
Declare Their Reasons for
Desiring One Gov
ernment.
Bay Cities Are Now Paying
Big Tribute to San
Francisco.
It Is Hoped to Score a Success With
â¢ the Next State Legis
lature.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
Broadway, Feb. 16.
The Merchants' Exchange has unani
mous . record as favoring con
solidation. It has issued its report on
the matter, and will do all that is pos
sible to try ami bring about a city and
county government. The report was
written by Director J. F. W. Sohst and
adopted by the entire board. Mr. Sohst
was appointed a committee of one to
draw up a pamphlet that could be is
sued officially.
The salient points in the report are
as follows:
If the question is asked of San
Francisco bankers. "Why do you
charge us so much more?" we re
ceive the prompt reply, "Your taxes
are too high. You support two gov
ernments." I stated further that the
tax rate in San Francisco was i>o
cents lower on the $100 valuation
than ours is; so. in all fairness, the
banks should not charge more than
that difference between the two
cities; but, as every one knows, a
mortgage runs from one year to four
years. and the banks do not know
from year to year what jump the tax
levy may make. So, in order to be
on the safe side, they charge $1 in
stead of 60 cents, a difference of 40
cents In their favor.
But, after all, "this 1 per cent
looks so insignificant and picayun
ish that it is not worth noticing.'
So say the non-thinking people of
Alameda, Berkeley and the major
ity of our own city officials. "'We
will not make anything by consoli
dation," they assert. They need a
lesson in multiplication. For in
stance, a $4,000,000 mortgage on
Berkeley property means $40,000 a
year extra Interestâ s33oo a month.
Next comes Alameda with a $8.'â¢) .000
mortgage, and Bhe is perfectly happy
and contented with her situation. We
are told that these cities will never
unite with Oakland, but figures do
not lie. Alameda and Berkeley pay
|60 000 a yar for their privileges. Let
us hone that, before the next Legisla
ture meets they will have changed
their opinion and left prejudice aside,
and will have come down to business
principles.
Has their attention ever been drawn
to the fact that they are throwing
away $5000 a month by supporting two
governments? That is for extra In
terest on their $6,000,000 mortgage
The' Alamedans claim that they
have a city of homes, but they seem
to forget or do not know that one
half of Oakland harbor lies within
their borders; that shipbuilding is
going: on on their side of the har
bnr. and that the Oakland Iron
"Works employ a hundred men day ana
night to put machinery into those
ers. Similar steamers are built
Jn San Francisco and Stockton. Re
move tiie double tax, and a great
.many steamers will be built along our
harbor.
We speak to you as business men,
and not as politicians. Our organiza
tion is composed entirely of merchants
and manufacturers. In politics we be
long to all parties, Republicans and
dyed-in-the-wool Democrats. There
fore, we are far apart in opinions,
but we are of but one opinion in com
ing to the conclusion that we are a
tax-ridden people, and we want to
close up our City Hall and ask you
to do the same with yours respec
tively, and use our county buildings
for city and county purposes.
Another thing- must be considered.
Supposing a man with money wants
to buy a home or start a factory.
Where will he locate? He will locate
where the taxes are lowest. If a man
wants to start a factory and has not
quite enough money, he goes to a bank
in San Francisco to negotiate a loan,
and is told that if he locates in San
Francisco he can get money at 7 per
cent, but that on our side of the bay
they will charge him 8 per cent.
Where will he locate? He will locate
where money is the cheapest.
Our electric roads get a benefit by
carrying people to and fro, which
helps th'-m to pay their many em
ployes the $40,000 a month which they
earn, and the people who live near
the power-houses get a share of this
money. The croakers should give us
credit for keeping the trade on this
Bide of the bay.
It becomes The duty of this exchange
to keep up this agitation and educate
those who have not given the matter
thought as to its importance, and
when the conventions meet this sum
mer to nominate candidates for the
State election all parties will put it in
their platforms, and the people will
pop to it that no one goes to Sacra
mento who is not strongly in favor of
consolidation.

Was Not a Street Then.
OAKLAND, Feb. 16.â City Attorney
Dow has prepared a written opinion to
the City Council relating to the railroad
tracks on Seventh street, east of Fallon.
He shows that the track was laid under
an ordinance passed November 20, 1861,
which gave the company permission to
lay them from the easterly to the wester
ly end of the street, provided they did
not come within fifteen feet of the side
walk line. He then finds that the place
complained of was not a Btreet at that
time, hence the city cannot compel them
to move the tracks, even though they be
only a foot or two from the sidewalk.

OAKLAND, Feb. 16.â Josiah P. Ames

908 Broadway, Feb. 16.
Delicate points are always arising in
divorce cases tried In this county, and
the Cornberger case is not go-ing to be
an exception. The last cause celebre
that perplexed the court and interested
the lobby was one in which the ques
tion was brought up of the amount of
pressure an elder of a church should
exercise when he shakes hands with
another man's wife. This matter was
satisfactorily adjusted and now another
problem has to be solved in the propri
eties of married life.
The new question has been raised by
Mrs. Cornberger, and it is this â has a
married woman a right to attend a ball
in the Watts tract, accompanied by a
man not her husband? Mr. Oornberger
declares that no self-respecting wife
would do it, and Mrs. Cornberger does
not see that there is much harm in it.
For two weeks this case has been en
gaging the serious attention of. the
court, and it is far from being settled.
Mr. Cornberger is the defendant in
the rase, and he has told and retold
the stories of his unhappiness. When
ever there is an opportunity to- bring it
up that ball at the Watts tract stalks
forth and the defendant looks at the
plaintiff expecting her to blush, but she
blushes not. When he became aware of
the ball episode, Mr. Cornberger made
some inquiry, and he says he was
greatly shocked to discover that it was
nnt a "married people's" ball, but single
fo-lks were there. In answer to ques
tions, he could not tell exactly why it
should be more culpable to attend a
single folks' ball in the Watts tract
than a dance of married people. He did
not think it was right that his wife
should Ko, although he admitted that he
would not have gone with her, even if
she had asked him.
The Watts tract has figured in social
events before. Net long since one of
its residents loaned another a hand
some masquerade ball dress. The cos
tume was awarded first prize, and there
was a legal contest between the two
ladles as to whether the prize were the
property of the owner or the wearer of
the dress. The tract has been com
pared to the district known as "south
of Market street" across the bay, but
it is more aristocratic.
There are other details in the case,
notably one told of by Mr. Cornberger,
who returned home one night and in
stead of being received with open arms
his wife received him with an open pair
of shears, which he declares were
about twelve inches long.
More Trouble With Electrolysis.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 16.â This morning
the water pipes at Webster and Haight
streets burst and the street was flood
ed for a considerable distance. This is
the same locality where both the water
and the gas company have had trouble
with damage to their pipes from elec
trolysis, caused by electricity escaping
from the streetcar tracks. The pipes
have been completely eaten out several
times and great trouble has resulted.
The water company some time since
announced its determination to bring
suit to settle the responsibility for the
damage done, and it is likely that such
action will be taken before long.
Electric Road Changes.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 16.â Beginning to
morrow some Important changes will
be made in the running of the electric
cars between this city and Oakland.
Heretofore these cars have run around
by the loop system, going to Oakland
by way of Santa Clara avenue and
Webster street and returning by way
of Twenty-third avenue and Park
street. After this, however, the Oak
land terminus will be at Seventh and
Broadway for cars going In one direc
tion and at Eleventh and Broadway for
those going the other way. The initial
point in Alameda for both lines will be
at Park street and Santa Clara avenue.
Cars will leave there on five minutes'
headway, going in both directions, and
transfers will be issued there for those
on either line who desire to go further.
It is expected that this arrangement
will result in making better time and in
using a smaller number of cars.
The Overcrowded Schools.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 16.â The committee
of citizens which has undertaken the
task of formulating some plan whereby
the overcrowded condition of the public
schools can be obviated met last even
ing and discussed the situation. It
transpired that the Trustees were not
willing to increase the tax rate suffi
ciently to enable the proposed repairs
and additions to the Haight School to
be made, and this of course rendered
that proposition nugatory. This left
the committee at sea, and after con
siderable discussion another subcom
mittee was appointed to investigate
and if possible devise some means for
meeting the contingency.
NO CONVICT PRINTING.
Senator Prisk Puts Himself on Rec-
ord as Opposed to the Proposition.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 16.â A short time
ago it was stated in a San Francisco
paper that the Senate Committee on
Public Institutions had visited San
Quentin, and while there the sugges
tion had been made to them and had
met their approval, that the public
printing be hereafter done by convicts.
Senator Prisk of the Grass Valley
Union is a member of that committee,
and he was written to about the mat
ter, as it was not believed that he
would approve the idea. In a letter to I
a local paper he emphatically condemns
the proposition and says:
"I am of the opinion that my fellow-
Senators have been misquoted relative
to employment of convicts to do State
printing.
"While the employment of prisoners j
is a serious problem, I am decidedly op
posed to. the proposition advanced of
teaching them the art of printing, and
I indorse every word contained in your !
article. lam also against the proposi- '
tion of engaging convicts in any kind
of labor which will come in conflict
with free labor. If necessary, let them
be employed in manufacturing furni
ture, for instance. Carload after car
load is being imported into California
every day almost, which is being made
in Eastern prisons. There are perhaps
other kinds of wares which come to us
from Eastern prisons, in the manufac
ture of which we can employ our con
victs."
ADOPTED WATER RATES.
Emeryville Trustees Refuse to In
crease the Cost of Water.
OAKLAND, Feb. 16.â The existing
rates to consumers is the price the
Emeryville Trustees have decided to
allow the water companies to charge
during the ensuing year in their town.
The hydrant rate will be increased to
$2 from $1 75, and water for street
sprinkling Avill be Increased from 15
cents per 1000 gallons to 20 cents. The
company will put !n all necessary pip
ing to enable the town to load sprink
lers without traversing unnecessary
ground. ,
Alameda News Notes.
ALAMEDA, Feb. IS.â The Thalians
will Rive the comedy, "A Scrap of Pa
per," this evening at Armory Hall for
the benefit of the new organ fund of
Christ Church.
Samuel Kimble, a trainer at the
race track, pleaded guilty to-day in
Justice Morris' court to a charge of
stealing various articles In use in such
places. He had taken about $50 worth.
He asked for the mercy of the court
and was ordered to appear for sentence
to-morrow morning.
The school fund is in rather a de
pleted condition and the utmost econ
omy will be necessary in order to
make it hold out until the end of the
fiscal year.

Broken by the Concussion.
BERKELEY. Feb. lfiâ As a result of
artillery practice on the campus this
morning, more than a dozen windows in
South Hall were shattered, and the occu
pants of the building: were given a thor
ough scare. The artillery corps, under
Captain F. S. Knight, had placed the two
big guns belonging to the cadet battalion
on the roadway between North and South
halls. Heavy charges were placed in the
guns and both were discharged simul
taneously. The violence of the concussion
broke fifteen large panes of glass in
South Hall. Fortunately the room in
which the broken glass fell was not oc
cupied, it being the room recently aban
doned by the botany department when It
moved into the new botany building, so
nobody was injured.
Foreign Internal Revenue.
The Treasury Department has ruled
that foreign internal revenue tax re
mitted on exportation of goods to the
United States is an element of dutiable
value of the goods under decision of the
United States Supreme Court In re United
States vs. Passavant et al.

A PRETTY NAME
FOR PRIZE FIGHTS.
SuDervisors Issue Permits for Contests in Physical
Cultureâ Told bu J. Lackmann,
The action of the Grand Jury in reference to the discontinuance of
prize fights in this city has caused considerable flutter in the local pugi
listic world. The Supervisors have also taken alarm at the proposed
cleansing of the city's athletic stables, and for the most part refuse to
discuss the matter at all. The blow has been delivered by the jurors in
so swift and sudden a manner that it has proved all but a knockout to the
City Fathers, who have hitherto ecouraged exhibitions of the so-called
manly art, and only one of them could be found yesterday who was at all
willing to discuss the resolution which was unanimously adopted by the
Grand Jury.
The managers of the different athletic clubs, as well as the managers
of the various pugs who are at present training for contests billed to take
place, are in a white heat of indignation at what they term the unwarrant
able action of the jurors; they assert positively that the contestÃ of "physi
cal culture" of which they are the promoters will assuredly be "brought
off."
In an interview yesterday J. J. Groom of the National Athletic Club
said: "I was simply astounded to read this morning of District Attorney
Barnes* application of the State law against prize fighting to the boxing
contests which are brought off in this city. I think it very ill advised of
the Grand Jury to promulgate any such order at the present time. We
fully understand that there is a law against prize fighting, but we do not
propose to promote or bring off any prize fights. For the last three years
we have been promoting boxing contests with tho sanction of the Board
of Supervisors under the special superintendence of the Police Department.
A prize fight is recognized the world over to be a "finish" fight with bare
knuckles, and has always been understood to be fought under London
prize ring rules. The contests brought oft* here of recent years have been
strictly under Marquis of Queensberry rules with five-ounce gloves, limited
rounds, and have always been examples of science of skill in tne manly art
of self-defense, and not trials of strength, endurance and brutality. The
National Athletic Club intends to bring off the exhibitions already pro
grammed and for which permits have been granted. We do not in the
least anticipate any adverse action against us by the Supervisors on a
recommendation by the present Grand Jury."
William Greer Harrison, who was president of the Olympic Club for
eeven years, said: "The contentions of the various athletic clubs are legally
correct from an athletic point of view. A prize fight differs entirely from
a contest under Marquis of Queensberry rules. If the contests were promot
ed and conducted by reputable people they should be patronized and encour
aged; but if they are only a means to an end, and that end is betting,
they should be forced to be discontinued by the city authorities. Under
the present system of promotion lovers of the sport are never certain that
the fights are not faked from first to last."
Supervisor Lackmann was the one bright exception among the City
Fathers who refused to talk about the matter. He said: "I have hither
to assented to permits being given for boxing- contests, but if I find that
they are contrary to law I shall support the State law every time. As I
understand it the law does not cover the case of the Supervisors issuing
permits for exhibitions of physical culture. We issue permits for contests
of that kind and not for trials of strength and brutality. So far as I know
the Board of Supervisors has never consulted the District Attorney on the
subject, so I am unprepared to say exactly what legal right we have to
issue permits of this sort."

PAUL GRIGGS
IS A FLIER
Defeated Libertine Over a
Mile in the Fast Time
of 1:39 1-2.
Spencer Landed the Oakland
Handicap With Ar
gentina.
Three First Choices Crossed the Wire
Firstâ Gotobed Won Unbacked
at Odds of 2O to 1.
Paul Griggs and Libertine reeled off
a very fast mile in the Boston special,
decided at Emeryville yesterday, but
the record over a circular course, held
by the latter horse, remains unbroken.
The other starters in the event were
Howard Mann and Robair. Griggs was
a warm 11 to 10 favorite in the betting,
â while Libertine had a large following,
â which took the 8 to 5 offered about him.
The other two entries commanded very
little backing. The half was reached
in 48 seconds, with Griggs a neck be-
fore Brown's big bay. The six furlongs
â were covered in 1:13 fiat, and Griggs
had increased his lead slightly. From
that point on to the wire Libertine was
plainly outfooted, and was beaten out
Jialf a length in l:39Vz. Howard Mann,
not up to a bruising race, easily took
third place from the Ryan entry.
The car/1 was an uneven one and the
betting very feverish. Favorites man
aged to hold their own by taking three
of the events decided. The surprise of
the day was furnished by Gotobed,
vhich won the mile selling dash prac
tically unbacked at odds of 20 to 1.
The Oakland handicap, over one mile
and a quarter, worth $700 to the victor,
though attracting but a field of four to
the post, resulted in one of the prettiest
contests of the season. "Longshot"
Conley's mount, the black horse Ostler
Joe, even though delegated to carry 123
pounds, was made favorite in the bet
ting, a raft of coin going into the books
on him at odds of 8 to 5. Argentina
looked nicely located with but 105 to
pack, still her odds floated back from
13 to o to 7 to 2. Palomacita. with 90
pounds up, was accorded considerable
support at 11 to 5, and Los Prietos was
not neglected. According to orders,
Conley started out to make the run
ning with the favorite, but found the
pace too warm, and, after passing the
stand, gave the lead up to Argentina.
The Baldwin mare was never again
headed, and, despite the furious ride
put up by Conley the last part of the
journey, won comfortably by over* a
length in the fast time of 2:07^. Los
Prietos looked to have finished third,
but show honors were conceded to the
Burns & Waterhouse mare, Paloma
cita.
A cheap band of "skates" started in
the opening six-furlong dash. Sing
"Wing had a shade the best of the
others and after racing Rosa to a
Standstill, won. ridden out by a couple
of lengths. In a drive, W. Taylor i
landed Scintillate in the place, a short
head in front of Rosa. There was no
pronounced favorite in the betting, the
winner going to the post at odds of 5 i
to 1.
. The Inverness colt, E. Come. carry-
Ing the colors of H. L. Frank, was a ;
strong favorite in the betting on the |
â two-year-old scramble at four furlongs, j
. end won in commanding fashion. Semi- I
colon, a well-played outsider, made the |
running to the paddock, where the j
flEst choice collared and led him over j
the mark a head in 49*4 seconds. Odd
Eyes, badly missed about the last six-
â teenth. was nosed out for the show by
JtanieF.
Barney Schreiber's Imperious had

ed at a trifle higher price. Turning

CANADIAN POACHERS.
Collector Jackson Orders the Seizure
of Two Suspicious Looking Can
adian Vessels.
Collector Jackson yesterday morning re
ceived information to the effect that two
Canadian sealing vessels had put into
Drakes Bay for repairs, and that they
had probably been fishing in the waters
of the United States. The Collector at
once notified the United States revenue
cutter Rush to proceed to Drakes Bay
and vicinity for the purpose of overhaul
ing the vessels, and of capturing and
confiscating them should any skins taken
in United States waters be found on
board.
It was afterward learned that one of
the vessels was the Mary Taylor, whose
captain was in port recently getting some
men for his crew, and that both vessels
had left Drakes Bay a few days ago.
Disturbed the Performance.
Emil Flubaeher was fined $80, with the
alternative of sixty days in the County
Jail, by Judge Campbell yesterday for
disturbing the peace. He attended the
Orpheum, and raised a row as a singer
appeared on the stage. He offered drun
kenness as an excuse, but the Judge re
marked that it was a serious rase, for a
large number of people paid to see the
show, and they must be protected.

"Seeing the ac
counts of the
whaler relief ex
pedition in The
Call brings to my
mind an occur
rence of several
years ago, when
SOME ONE
CUT
THE ROPES.
I was a mate on one of the vessels of the
whaling fleet." said Z. T. Jennings, a re
tired seafaring man, at present at the
Grand.
"We were lying off Cape Thompson, and
the captain had aboard four large bar
rels of bad whisky, which he intended to
trade for bone on the Siberian side. We
had put into Cape Thompson for fresh
water, and were to leave in a few hours
for the other side, when, just as our bad
luck would have it, we saw a steamer's
smoke to the southard, and in a few
moments we made her out to be the
revenue cutter Bear. As our vessel had
only sails, ther* was no way to escape
her, and to be caught with whisky aboard
meant a confiscation of the ship, the
breaking up of the cruise and the possible
imprisonment of the captain. The 'old
man' was in a quandary. He did not
wish to lose the whisky, out of which he
expected to make big profits; neither did
he want to get into trouble. Finally he
hit upon the scheme of weighting the
barrels and sinking them over the side
attached to ropes, by which they could
be again hauled up when the search was
over.
"The cutter arrived, and, after a
thorough search, departed on her way
north, having found nothing contraband
on board. Then the 'old man.'chuckling
at his own cleverness, went to fish up
his bugjuice. But it was not there. Some
one of the crew who had a grudge to pay
off had cut the ropes and allowed the
barrels to go to the bottom. The guilty
party was never discovered, though the
captain offered his share of the first
whale to the man who would put him in
the way of a five minutes' private inter
view with the offender."

following anec-
AN
ANECDOTE
OF BOOTH.
dote of Booth and Salvlnl. the elder.
"It was just ten years ago when Sal
vlnl, Booth and myself were playing to
gether in 'Othello' at the Academy of
Music in Philadelphia. Salvinl played
the title role. Mr. Booth appeared as
lago and I was Desdemona. In the first
act lago leads Desdemona Into the coun
cil chamber. It is a most effective en
trance, because in this country It is al
ways made through the central arch up
stage.
"But this was not Salvlni's way of play-
Ing It. He was disposed to reserve all the
good points for himself and said he would
not allow us to come on In that manner,
but that we mi;Bt make our entrance
from the left Bide.
"It was quite absurd to spoil the scene
in that way a.nd naturally I protested.
But you remember what a quiet, lovable
man Mr. Booth was. Without speaking
further to the prompter about it he
told me we would make the entrance from
the side during rehearsals, but in the
evening we would come in from the cen
ter. And so we did. Salvini was at his
grandest and rolling off the Italian for
'Here comes the lady, let her witness
it,' looked to the left for us. we
were standing almost at his side/
"Of course he was furious and ex
pressed himself more than forcibly when
the performance was over. Mr. Booth
listened for a while and then quietly said
to him: 'Mr. Salvlnl may do these things
as he pleases in Italy, but he is now in
America where courtesy and fair treat
ment is accorded to all women, whether
on or off the stage.' Salvlnl quieted
down at once and never again objected
to the entrance being made that way."
Can't Get a Conviction.
The police have about given up hope
of obtaining a conviction against pool-
sellers. Yesterday J. TV. Hammond was
tried before a jury in Judge Joachim
sen's court for violating the pool ordin
ance on January 31 at 27 Leidesdorff
street. The jury, after hearing the evi
dence, rendered a veruict of acquittal on
the lirst ballot. Â± our cases were recently
tried before juries in Judge Low's court
with a similar result.
A CHILD KILLED.
The Six- Year-Old Son of Dr. Bu-
chanan Bun Over by a Truck.
James C. Buchanan, the 6-year-old son
of Dr. Buchanan of 441 Hayes street, was
killed last Tuesday by being run over
by a truck.* He had been playing on the
wagon, which had been driven into a va
cant lot on the corner of Fell and Octavia
streets. The driver had gone away and
left the horses attached to the vehicle.
Young Buchanan and three other little
boys got on the hind part of the truck,
and Buchanan fell off just as the horses
backed up, the hind wheel passing over
his body. The accident happened at 5
o'clock, and the little sufferer died at
ten minutes before midnight.
The Coroner will hold an inquest.
The Tea Cases.
The matter of the appeal to the United
States Circuit Court of certain Chinese
importers of Canton teas from the deci
sion of Collector Jackson, backed by that
of the Board of General Appraisers of
New York, was argued yesterday in the
Circuit Court, Judge de Haven sitting on
the bench. Edward Lande represented
the Chinese and Assistant United States
Attorney Knight the Government. The
case was taken under advisement. The
tea was refused admission because the
Government at that time had not fixed
a standard for Canton teas.

HE THREATENS SUICIDE.
'Corn Woods the Name of the Lady
Who Would Be Willing to
Fly With Him.
The delights of the tenderloin have
proven a pitfall for an official, who,
from the dignity of his office, should
have been proof against the â¢wiles of
the sirens of the demi-monde. Samuel
1,. Waller, druggist and School Direc
tor, is the latest example of the fall
ing from grace of a public official, and
his downfall is in some measure to be
â attributed to his liaison with a fair
haired Hebe whose present name is
Cora Woods.
Waller is not at all comfortable in
his present predicament and has no
ambition to face an investigation of his
alleged felony in a court of justice.
Fince he was indicted by the Grand
Jury he asserts that he has lost thirty
pounds in weight, and that the anxiety
and worry of his case is "killing him
by inches." To end all this trouble he
has come to the conclusion that he
would be better off in a distant State
and in company with the fair Cora he
at one time about decided to try his
luck elsewhere.
It Is rumored by people who are in
timate acquaintances of the indicted
School Director that if he succeeds in
eluding his bondsmen and the police he
will leave this State to-day, and as he
has made over his interest in the drug
store on the corner of Grant avenue
and Geary street to his brother there
would appear to be some truth in *he
Btory. gome of his friends assert thai
his bondsmen are to be left lamenting
while others say that the amounts his
bondsmen will be called upon to pay m
the event ot Waller not putting in an
appearance will be delivered to them
before he leaves.
It is said that Waller and the fair
Cora have been preparing for departure
during thÂ£ past week, and the young
lady, who for some time had been liv
ing at the Golden Eagle Hotel on Pow
ell street, but owing to a slight disa
greement with the landlady of the ho
tel over property and rent was re
quested to leave about a month ago,
â turned up at the hotel yesterday and
Tedeemed her belongings, which the
landlady had seized for the rent that
was due. It is alleged that Waller was
In company with her on her visit to the
hotel, and afterward escorted her to
her present lodgings at 416 Eddy street.
The young lady told the proprietress of
the hotel that she intended to leave the
city this week. Early this week "Miss
Woods" ordered two tickets to be set
apart for the Saturday matinee of the
Bostonians. Last night she counter
manded her order on the plea that she
â was leaving town and her deposit for
the tickets was returned to her.
A few days ago Waller remarked to
an intimate friend that if he did not
succeed in getting away he would end
his life in the bay. He discussed the
matter pro and con with his friend,
and the advice of the latter was char
acteristic. He said: "If you fight the
matter through the courts. Waller,
don't you have anything tn do with a
'shyster lawyer.' " The friend has had
considerable experience with lawyers of
late, so that he should know whereof
he speaks.
Waller obtained his release last Sat
urday on bonds furnished by Joseph
Xaphtaly and Thomas A. Bums, who
Tjoth qualified in the sum of $5000, and
the School Director was not detained in
custody a moment later than was nec
essary for the filing of the bonds. Since
then, however, he has by some un
known means obtained information
that the Grand Jury intends to present
other indictments apainst him, and it
is alleged that he then determined to
take time by the forelock and escape
â while hÂ«' may.
The lady in the case was peen last
night, but would give no Information
on the subject of flirting. She said:
"I am not a walking information bu
reau, nor am I a directory of people's
â¢movements. I never stopped at the
/solden EaglÂ» Hotel, nor do I know Mr.
Clayton of the Columbia Theater. I
do not know anybody, and I absolutely
refuse to talk upon the matter at all."
To Mr. Clayton she said that she had
an old fogy, who, in the language of
the demi-monde, was "putting up for
Jier." Cora is a stylish blonde and very
clever in the ways of the world. She
told the landlady of the Golden Eagle
Hotel that she was living at a certain
number on Mason street, but on in
quiry it was ascertained that she went
direct from the hotel to her present
residence.
The landlady of the hotel, when seen
last night, said: "Cora lived here for
gome time, and Sam Waller often visit
ed her here. I know him well and am

could not allow Cora to stay here any
longer, as she became too well known.
Besides that, there were other unpleas

protect myself by turning her out and
seizing her wardrobe. I believe Waller
was with her when she came to settle
her account last Tuesday."
Waller dined with Thomas A. Burns
last night, and was afterward seen in

McPHERSON SUSPECTED.
Federal Officers Are Looking for a
New Opium Ring Now at Work.
There were rumors on the water front
and in Federal circles yesterday to the
effect that A. W. McPherson is suspected
of being the leader of a new opium ring.
An old Federal inspector, who has had
his eye on the movements of McPherson
and his followers for some weeks, said
yesterday:
"It is hard to say Just how the new
gang is operating, but it may bÂ£_ safely
said that Government officers are on thefr
trail and that it will be impossible for the
ring to make any great progress without
detection. McPherson's conduct relative
to Ouban matters has also excited con
siderable suspicion, and it is thought he
has something under way in aid of the
insurgents, possibly in connection with
Captain Mahoney."
A PECULIAR ARREST.
Two Men Booked on a Grand Lar

Officer John McLean arrested Olaf Olaf

and after taking them to prison placed
a charge of grand larceny against them.
Captain Wittman. after closely ques
tioning: the two prisoners, discharged
them from custody. The trouble origin
ated in a scuffle the two men had over a
five-dollar piece, which hail fallen to the
ground and each accused the other of an
attempt to purloin it. The consequence
was they were both taken to jail.

a Cash Register.
The Bartender Was in Front of the
Place When the Robbery
Took Place.
Sneak thieves succeeded in robbing the
cash register in the store of George Buz
z!ni, a liquor merchant at Eighth and
Minna streets, a few days ago.
While Bartender J. G. Marks was en
gaged in conversation with a customer in
front of the store, the thieves quietly
entered at the side door, and while one
kept a lookout, the other ransacked the
cash register. Marks did not discover that
the place was robbed until he went to
the register to make change. Not a cent
greeted his ryes and he could not ac
count for its disappearance. Further
search showed that two revolvers and a
pocket knife that usually reposed in the
drawer were missing.
Marks said that the reason why he did
not hear the bell of the register when
it was opened was due to the noise of
heavy traffic passing the store.

THE CATTLE
KING WEDS
ONCE MORE
G. E. White Takes a
Bride for the Third
Time.
A Gay Old Lothario and
Pretty Young Girl
for a "Wife.
He Is Seventy-Two Years of
Age and She Is Fifty
Years Younger.
MATCH MADE BY WRAITHS
Married According to the Advice of
the Spirits Conjured by a
Trusted Medium.
George E. White, the wealthy cattle
king of Round Valley, is married again.
This time his bride is a pretty young
lady not much more than one-third his
age. Twice before the cattle king ven
tured on the sea of matrimony. His
first wife died not long after the wed-
I ding ceremony. Then he married one
â of his nieces. That marriage was not
: a happy one for the uncle and husband.
After a few years of life with his sec
ond wife domestic trouble commenced
and a divorce was secured by Mrs.
White. The cattle king was ordered to
pay alimony by the court, but he re
fused to pay it and a suit was the re
sult. Judgment was secured against
; him, but he would not recognize it and
! he was thrown into jail for contempt
lof court. That was nearly three years
I ago. He, however, settled the griev
ance against him, and ever since he
has been looking for another wife. He
; made love to many, but he could find
none to suit him. He consulted the
spirits on his matrimonial aspirations,
and they told him to watch the col
i limns of a marriage paper published in
â  this city, and in that way he was made
acquainted with the young lady he
made his third wife.
White is a believer in spiritualism.
He consults mediums for advice on
every venture he undertakes. All his
business affairs are carried on under
the counsel of the spirits. The medium
who conjures up for him the wraiths
of the vasty spaces apparently under
stands his business affairs, for the
ghosts have no difficulty in giving rea
sonable advice. As White has the
means to pay if anything goes wrong
he stands his losses with reasonable
grace and praises the ghosts when
things come his way.
The spirits advised him to make his
third matrimonial venture, and the
wedding of yesterday was the result.
The bride was Miss Louise Bogan, a
pretty young lady living at 310 Tehama
street. She had known her aged suitor
but a short time when the wedding was
i arranged. He was an ardent lover and
lan energetic man for his years. His
; beard was kept a shining black with a
liberal use of dye, and in the fire of his
love he strutted about with all the
vigor of a youth. His blazing diamonds
j and frequent and costly presents cap
! tivated the young lady. When a wed
â  ding trousseau was suggested the
aged lover looked to it, and the bride
stood beside him before the minister in
â¢ a rustling white silk gown which
showed off her pretty figure to an ad
j vantage the happy groom admiringly
| appreciated. Rev. Dr. Cryor, the pas
j tor of the Westminster Presbyterian
' Church, performed the ceremony. Miss
Anna Hannon was the bridesmaid and
the maid of honor was Miss Kate El
phinston. John P. Bogan, a brother of
i the bride, supported the groom. Only
a few of the friends of the bride were
present at the ceremony. There was a
breakfast after the marriage had been
performed, and then the newly married
couple took the train for Los Angeles.
I They will remain there for a short
I time, then take a trip through the
southern part of the State and prob
ably go to Mexico.
The necessary marriage license was
secured for the couple by the groom, In
which the ago of thÂ» .cattle king was.
given as 55 and the bride as 22. The
bride's age Is correct, but the friends
of White say the groom's age is 72.
DEATH OF N. C. PARB.ISH.
The Ex-Supervisor and Pioneer In
surance Agent Succumbs to a
Stroke of Paralysis.
Ex-Supervisor Nathan C. Parrish died at
an early hour yesterday morning after
an illness that has confined him to his
bed for several months. About six years
ago Mr. Parrish gradually lost control
of his legs, and notwithstanding the most
skillful medical treatment his malady de
veloped into locomotor ataxia, and two
years ago he was compelled to give up all
business. Sunday night Mr. Parrish was
stricken with partial paralysis, and from
that time until his death he lay in a
comatose state.
Mr. Parrish was born in the State of
New York on July 4, 1828. Soon after
reaching his majority, he removed to
Harvard, 111., where, in 1852. he married
Miss Julia Diggins, sister of J. C. and
Byron Diggins of this city. Mr. and
Mrs. Parrish, accompanied by the for
mer's family, made a honeymoon trip
across the plains to California, arriving in
San Francisco late in that year. Mr. Par
rish spent several years In mining, but
for the past quarter of a century he has
been connected with the Fireman's Fund
Insurance Company. In 1882 he was
elected a member of the Board of Super
visors from the Eleventh Ward, which
position he filled with honor to himself
and his constituents. Since his retirement
from public office Mr. Parrish has de
voted his attention to his private inter
ests.
Besides his widow Mr. Parrish leaves
two sons. H. A. and E. H. Parrish. The
funeral will take place from his late resi
dence. 738 Capp street, at 2 o'clock this
afternoon. The interment will be in the
family plot in laurel Hill Cemetery.
PRISON DIRECTORS MEET.
Warden Hale Authorized to Sell One
Million Convict-Made Grain
Sacks.
A special meeting of the Board of Pris
on Directors was held yesterday, and, af
ter a lengthy discussion, it was decided
to authorize Warden Hale of San Quentin
Prison to advertise the sale of 1,000,000
grain sacks.
Warden Hale appeared before the com
mission and stated that he had about two
million and a half sacks on hand and that
he believed it advisable to dispose of a
part of them.
Under the law regulating the sale of
grain hags manufactured at the peni
tentiary, no purchaser can obtain more
that 6000 sacks unless by consent of the
Prison Directors. In view of the fact that
the output has far exeoded the demand,
the commission decided to place one mil
lion sacks in the field, the limitation as
to number bought being for the present
withdrawn. The price of the sacks was
set at a previous meeting at $5 30 per
hundred.
The directors also authorized an ex
penditure of $175 t" build a corrugated
iron building at San Quentin, where the
"waste oorder" will be placed. The "cor
der" is at present in the jute mills, and
catches fire on an average of three times
a week. Fortunately for the State, the
fires have always been discovered In time
and quickly distinguished. Should a tire
occur in the jute mill much valuable ma
chinery would be ruined, so the directors
thought it better to have the "waste cor
der" isolated.
QUARANTINE LAWS.
nState Officer Chalmers Gains a Ter-
porary Victory.
Judge Conlan yesterday rendered his
decision In the case of Captain Finch of
the steamer Gaelic and Pilot Johnson,
charged with violating the quarantine
laws by refusing to permit State Quaran
tine Officer Chalmers to board the vessel
on her arrival last September. It has
been brought up as a tt>st case in regard
to the much-vexed question as to whether
the Federal or State quarantine Officer
has the power to quarantine vessels.
Judge Conlan, in giving his decision,
said he could not overlook the fact that
there was a Rtfite Jaw authorizing the
appointment of a quarantine officer, and
he would therefor^ find the defendants
guilty, but would impose a nominal fine
of $10 on each, with no alternative. Notice
of appeal was promptly given to the Su
perior Court.
BABIES TO BE
AGAIN EXHIBITED
The Mining Fair Management

Chance.
A Unique Communication on the
Subjectâ Miss Davies' Klon
dike Kitchen.
There Is going- to be another baby show
at the Mining Fair, and all the mothers
with young hopefuls between the ages of
2 to 4 will have a chance of showing them

large number of babies whose mothers did
not get a chance to exhibit them at the
last competition, and in order to give all
a chance the management has decided to
reopen the list. This determination was
brought about by the following letter re
ceived yesterday:

so. We did not see your offer to triplets until
Thursday noon, and then It was too late to
take them, or we should certainly have gone.
We are people that are renting land and
struggling to get along, having to depend on
a day's work to support a large family. I
thought If there would be any money in It for
the little girls by taking them to the fair for
a day I would like to know, as I am anxious
to get a little home for the girls. I do not
want to appeal to the charitable at all, but
would like to know If there would be any
money In It by taking them to your fair. Hop-
Ing there Is no harm done by writing this.
Yours respectfully,
MRS. HARVEY SMITH.
Mountain View. Santa Clara, Cal.
Varenne, the one-legged dancer, amused
those present at the fair yesterday after-
noon.
Miss Edna Davies, the official lecturer
on Klondike foods, spent a busy after
noon yesterday cooking banana fritters,
broiling: lamb chops and beauguard eggs.
She has published a book called the
"Klondike Cook Book," and many of the
receipts have pleased the housewives that
have read it. To-day she will cook French
rolls, deviled crab and banana snow.
There will be a soap-wrapping contest
to-night, and an endeavor will be made
to beat the world's record again. There
will be eleven contestants.
WILL LEAVE THE CITY.
George Upson, the Counterfeit Lot-
tery Ticket Man, Heavily Fined
by Judge Joachimsen.
George Upson, the notorious counter
feiter of lottery tickets, appeared in
Judge Joachlmsen's court yesterday morn-
Ing to answer to the charge of keeping a
lottery place. Upson was arrested about
a week ago by Sergeant Donovan and
posse at his house on Clementina street,
and the plateÃ, dies, punches and other
articles used in the manufacture of tick
ets, besides a large number of tickets,
were seized.
Upson pleaded guilty to the charge, and
promised that if the Judge would be len
ient with him he would leave the city.
The Judge lined him $200, with the alter
native of six months in the County Jail.
He has on former occasions been fined
$300 and $250.
A. C. Campbell, who was arrested at
the same time for aiding and a"betting a
lottery, will be tried by Judge Campbell
on Friday. Campbell is one of the men

from Upson and sold them. He will

A HOT TIME
IN BASEBALL
The Pacific States League
Has Been Quietly
Organized.
It Is Said to Be the Dark
Scheme of a Private
Corporation.
The Pacific States Baseball League
wan organized last night In the office
of Eugene F. Bert, in the Parrott build
ing. Eight clubs were represented and
Bert was elected president. It was de
cided to play at Central Park and use
the regular association ball. A schedule
committee was appointed and the sea
son will open on March 3. -The clubs
represented at the meeting were: Gilt
Edge of Sacramento, E. L. Kripp, W.
J. Henesey; San Francisco, D. Crow
ley; Oakland, F. H. Bushnell; Santa
Cruz, O. L. Tuttle and F. W. Swanton;
Olympics of this city, E. J. Kaplen;
San Jose, J. McGuckkin and W. West
in; Stockton, G. H. Campbell, and Re
liance of Oakland, Cal Ewing.
THE DOUBLE OF LILLIAN RUSSELL
Miss Barney of Oakland, Who Is Said to Resemble the
"Airy Fairy" One to a Remarkable Degree.
Lillian Russell has a "double" and she Is Miss Marian Barney now with
Harry Corson Clarke at the Columbia Theater.
Miss Barney is a tall blonde of great beauty. She made her debut Mon
day evening, and immediately scored a hit.
Mlsb Barney is an Oakland girl and first won recognition as a dramatic
reader. She played for a short time at Santa Rosa, but her formal bow to
the public was made in this city.
Mr. Clarke considers that he has found a treasure in Miss Barney, as she
has both talent fend beauty. The former gift she has proved she possesses
since last Friday night in the part she sustains in "What Happened to
Jones," and as for the latter the men say a single glance at her will settle
the Question In her favor,
It was derided to have a 2 per cent
reserve fund, to be collected from all
the games to be played, and this is to
form a consolation purse to be played
for at the end of the season between
the three leading clubs, and is to be
divided in the ratio of 50, 30 and 20 per
cent. Governor Budd has promised that
when the season is over that he will
give to the winning club a handsome
banner, to be known as the champion
ship flag. When the regular season Is
ended there will be a series of games
played here between the champion club
of this league and the champion club of
some other Coast league to be selected
later.
It was currently reported that the or
ganization of the Pacific States League
was nothing more or less than a re
vival of the malodorous carnival that
was held here last year. Upon this sub
ject T. P. Robinson, the manager of the
Recreation Park, at the corner of
Eighth and Harrison streets, expressed
himself in no uncertain terms.
He said: "The California League will
run again this season and it will show
the Examiner that baseball can be
successfully operated here without its
support This new league is being
fathered by the Examiner, and it
wants to get in and glorify itself some
where you can rest assured on that. I
understand that it is offering the clubs
less money to go with this league, with
the understanding that if they do they
will receive the support of the paper.
The league cannot hold all of the clubs
that it claims are going with it. As
for the Reliance Club, for Instance, the
California League controls the park
there and the club will play with our
league. Some of the other clubs that
are claimed will not be with the new
league.
"I have cleared my park of all legal
hindrances and the opposition, sup
posing that I had not, took snap Judg
ment and organized this new league.
I consider the new league to be backed
and operated by the Examiner and
that it intends to run baseball to suit
itself."
It is hardly necessary to say that the
meeting of the Pacific States League
was secret and that only such data
were given out for publication as it
was desjj-ed that the press should have.
It is apparent that there is to be com
petition and opposition in baseball cir
cles this season.
