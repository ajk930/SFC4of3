TELLS OF
HORRORS
IN CUBA
Congressman King BaGk
From the Stricken
Island.
Reconcentrados in a Most Piti=
able Condition, and Many Are
Dying Like Sheep in the
Streets of Towns.
TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 8. â After spending several weeks making per
sonal Investigation of the situation in Cuba, Congressman King of Utah
arrived here, this evening. His tour covered four provinces and was
thorough. Speaking of his trip, he said:
"I made It a point to learn Just what the conditions were, and I found
that no one has ever half depicted the awful horrors of the reconcen
trados. Those people, naked and starving, are still dying like sheep in
the streets of the towns where they are still huddled. To realize just
what this means, one must see for himself. I found that the Spanish
people have evidently very little faith In the new autonomical govern
ment, for they are strongly in favor of annexation and want it at
once.
"General Blanco has not succeeded In his efforts tr> alleviate the suf
fering, for he has not had financial means to carry it out. I have in
terviewed insurgent leaders, Spanish officers and Americans, and have
6ome definite idea of what is going on in that terribly devastated is
land. I know positively that General Lee is now going out with Gen
eraJ Blanco to see General Gomez."
As Mr. King saw General Lee yesterday, he evidently speaks with
authority.
Professor Hermann Schoenfeld of Columbian University came on the
same boat. He has been making Investigations for the purpose of writ
ing magazine articles for Germany and Austria. He corroborated in
the main Mr. King's views, but thinks the war will continue a long
time.
HAVANA, Jan. 9.â To-day at the residence of Dr. Villiosola of the
special committee appointed by Senor Bruzon, Governor of Havana,
and Consul General Fitzhugh Lee to superintend the work, took place
the first distribution of supplies received from the United States Con
sulate for the reconcentrados.
La Discusion refers in phrases of profuse gratitude to the Ameri
can charity. It published to-day a special supplement, the proceeds of
the sale of which will be turned over to the relief fund. In a leading
editorial. La Discusion asks the insurgents, in the name of humanity
and tor the sake of their mothers, wives, sisters and children dying of
starvation, to lay down their arms and make peace with the Govern
ment.
LOSE A TRAIL AND

Terrible Suffering.

COULEE CITY, "Wash., Jan. 9.â Will
.lam Putnam and Parrish Johnson, one
. t>f the oldest settlers of Douglas coun
ty, perished in the snow in the Grand
. Coulee country in the latter part of De
cember, and a searching party has just
come in with their frozen bodies. Al
though they had but twenty miles to
go over a trail, the men had wandered
over 100 mixes in a circle, as the search
ing party traced, and had gone four
days without food. Johnson, in his des
peration, had cut or gnawed his hand
and had sucked the blood in a vain
hope of retaining vitality. Johnson,
like Putnam, lay stiff In the snow, but
seven miles further on.
Putnam arrived here December 20,
having been released the day before
from the Medical Lake Insane Asylum.
He was met by his father-in-law, Jo-hn
son. The two set out for their homes
In Cold Spring Basin, thirty miles
northeast of Waterville. They were
advised to go by stage around a longer
road, but from motives of economy
they preferred to go across country.
The first night they stopped at the
home of G. W. Holt, about twelve miles
from Coulee City. The next morning
they left on snow shoes.
Word was received here last week
that they had failed to reach their
homes, and alarm was felt for their
safety. A searching party started out
last Tuesday to follow the trail. The
searchers struck the trail, and found
that evidently in the dense fog that
â had prevailed for weeks the men had
l>f(-ome bewildered. Tuesday evening
â the searchers returned, rigged them
â  iÃelvea out with toboggans, blankets
and food, and then followed the trail
â 'â for four days. Saturday morning they
â¢came upon the body of Johnson, the
: feet in a badger hole and the bloody
.'.h-and Hasped close to his mouth. The
.two had separated a short distance

McKENNA'S NOMINATION
WILL NOW BE CONSIDERED.
Protests From the Pacific Coast to Be Con
sidered, but They Will Not Prerent
the Confirmation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 9.â The
Senate Committee on Judiciary will
meet to-morrow and formally consider
the nomination of Attorney-General
McKenna to be Associate Justice of
the United States Supreme Court. The
committee will examine the protests
filed against Judge AicKenna, and it
is known that some of its members
are opposed to the nomination. It is
probable, however, that there will be
no strong fight on Mr. McKenna in the
Senate. The opposition to him will be
mainly in the form of remonstrances
from the judiciary of the Pacific
Coast. These will be given considera
tion by the committee, but the belief
is that the nomination will be con
firmed.

COLUMBUS, Ohio. Jan. 9.â The Sen
atorial situation has not changed to
day. The conferences continue day
and night and the doubtful members
are given no rest. But no such Hops
were announced to-day as those of the
previous days In favor of Hanna. The
workers for the Senator say they now
have enough votes. The Kurtz work
ers say they can spare another vote or
two and still defeat Hanna. But they
insist that they have lost all of their
doubtful men now, and will stand to
the last with at least eight Republi
can and sixty-five Democratic mem
bers against Hanna. They even say
that they expect to get Manuel of
Montgomery and Griffith of Union
back on their Bide again before Tues
day. It Is also claimed by the oppo
sition that while Senator Hanna's
forces have been charging on their
lines that they have been successfully
attacking his lines and have promises
from members on whom the Senator
has been depending. The Hanna men
claim two accessions to-day, but they
will not give any names, as they did
those of Representative Manuel Fri
day night and of Representative Grif
fith last night.
The opposition to Hanna has no bet
ting yet in its favor. The bets, rang
ing, from $500 to $5000 for even money
on Hanna's election, have remained
posted at the Neil House for two days
without takers. None of the bets are
on the result of the first or any other
ballot, but all are offered on the final
result.
While the workers on both sides
have been chasing doubtful members
and holding; secret conferences to-day,
the general public has been agitated
over the result to-morrow of the inau
guration at noon and the Hanna mass
meetin* In the afternoon. Both sides
are to-day arranging to avoid street
collisions or any kind of trouble, if.pos
sible, at that time. The mass-meeting
will not be called to onler by Chair
man Geo'ge V. Nasn of the State Re
publican Committee till 3 p. m., and
those In charge of the inauguration of
Governor Bushnell will seek to have
the inauguration exercises over be
fore the clubs begin the march to the
Auditorium for the mass-meeting.
The railroads arranged to run
the excursion trains for those attending
the Inauguration early In the morning,
and for those coming to the mass-meet
ing later in the day. The Hanna men
are seeking to have as many here as
! possible in the afternoon, and the oppo
i sltion Is equally energetic in rallying
j all they can In the different counties
! for the morning demonstration. The
'â¢ militia and other organizations are ar
riving to-night to take part in the In
auguration. In the morning parade
there will be a marked absence of Re
publican clubs. All the police of the
i city and many detectives will be on
hand for both occasions. There have.
In addition to the regular number, been
over 100 sergeants-at-arms appointed
for the mass-convention In the after
noon, with ex-Chief of Police Alexis
Keeler as chief sergeant- at-arms.
Chairman Nash will state the object
of the mass-convention â that it was
called on the requests of county Re
publican committees, etc. â and then he
will introduce as chairman of the con
vention Congressman Walter Weaver
|of Springfield, who was spokesman
i last week of the Republican delegation
that came from Bushnell's home to call
j on the Governor and protest against
| the course of his Excellency in this
! Senatorial contest. A. C. Came and
John R. Malloy, the Republican caucus
candidates respectively for clerks of
the Senate and the House, will be Â£he
secretaries. All the Republican caucus
nominees, who were defeated by the
ten Republican members voting with
the Democrats on the organlzatfon of
the Legislature, are included in the list
! of sergeants-at-arms.
While the resolutions that will be
presented at the mass-convention to
morrow will not differ materially from
those heretofore adopted in the coun
ties, it is Intimated that there will be
one appealing to Senator Forake*, as
the senior Senator from Ohio, to de
clare himself. There is no doubt about
the tone of the resolutions on Governor
Bushnell and the bolting Republican
members, and in them demanding the
resignation of Charles L. Kurtz as the
Ohio member of the Republican Na
tional Committee, but there are differ
ences of opinion among the Republican
Since the epidemic of local Indignation
meetings and the crusade for a gener
al gathering here to-morrow, some of
the managers of the opposition say two
mistakes have been made on their side.
The first alleged mistake was in ex
posing their strength in organizing the
Legislature, and the second in allow
ing It to adjourn from Wednesday un
til Monday, so that such members as
Manuel of Montgomery and Griffith of
Union could go home and meet their
constituents. It was thought the or
ganization of the Legislature was a set
tled thing, but it is cited that since
Mason has been made Speaker, he is
calling on Senator Hanna, and since
Griffith has been sworn In as Speaker
pro tern, he has come out publicly for
Hanna. Representative Joyce of
Guernsey, who voted with "the com
bine" in organization, his announced
positively that he will support Hanna.
His opposition was solely against Box

NEW YORK, Jan. 9.â A Herald spe
cial from Key West, Fla.. says: Par
ticulars have been received here of the
confiscation of the American schooner
Alice Vane and the imprisonment of
her crew for an alleged attempt to de
fraud the customs revenue at the Port
of Omoa, Honduras. The Alice Vane
Is owned by George H. Curry, a prom
inent merchant of this city. She is
about sixty tons' burden. In June
last she cleared for Havana, Cuba, In
ballast, with Felepe Gomez, a natural
ized American citizen, as master and a
crew of six. After remaining in Ha
vana a few days the schooner sailed
for Livingston, Guatemala, on a trad-
Ing voyage.
According to the Information Just re
ceived, it appears that the Alice Vane
subsequently cleared in due form some
time in July last from Livingston for
Ceiba, Honduras, and when on her voy
age became becalmed off the Honduras
coast, a few miles from Omoa, a small
town on the Bay of Honduras near the
mouth of the River Matagua. There
she was boarded by an armed force,
which forcibly took possession of the
vessel and carried her to Omoa, where
the crew was imprisoned.
The Honduras authorities assert the
crew waa caught red-handed selling
liquors on board the schooner to na
tives who had come off in small boats,
and also that the schooner had previ
ously been engaged in extensive smug
gling along the coast. They declared
the vessel forfeited under law, and in
stituted proceedings against the crew
for smuggling. The men were thrown
into prison in Omoa, where they were
kept in close confinement in a small,
filthy cell and ill-fed until they became
so weak and emaciated that life wai
despaired of, and it was deemed advli

WILL WEAR
THE ROBES
OF ROYALTY
Miss Minnie Klevesahl
Chosen 'Queen of the
Golden Jubilee.
The Ancient Order of Hibernians
Will Add Over Two Thou=
sand Men to Swell the
Mighty Parade.
Queen California has at last been
chosen and It now behooves all the sub
jects of the golden realm, over which
her gentle scepter will hold sway dur
ing the Jubilee week, not only to do all
they can individually to make her reign
a success, but to see to it that of all
the knights whose homage is her birth
right not one shall prove recalcitrant.
When, at the beginning of the prepa
rations for the Golden Jubilee It was
decided to have a queen the committee
having the affair in charge, realizing
the fact that none could play the role
half so well as a maiden of the royal
State, put the entire matter Into the
hands of the Daughters of the Golden
West, who yesterday held a meeting in
the rooms of their organization, on Ma-
son street, and unanimously decided
that none of their number would wear
a crown with greater dignity than Miss
Minnie Klevesahl. whom they accord
ingly elected queen of the Jubilee.
Miss Klevesahl is a typical daughter
of California. She was born in San
Francisco a little more than twenty
years ago and has grown up to woman
hood in this city, receiving her edu
cation, character and impressions en
tirely from the beautiful State she is
to represent.
She has been a member of the Native
Daughters of the Golden West for the
last five or six years and is one of the
trustees of La Estrella Parlor No. 89,
which she herself helped to found a lit
tle over a year ago. In appearance
Miss Klevesahl is a demi-blonde, with
dark blue eyes and a wealth of soft
brown hair. Her figure is of the
Junoesque type, splendidly propor
tioned.
The construction of the royal float
has not been finally decided upon, but,
If the plans now under consideration
are carried Into effect, it will be a most
elaborate affair. It Is proposed to have
it built In circular form. In the center
will be a six pointed star resting on a
low pedestal. This star will be compos
of yellow California poppies; raising
from the center of the star will be a
floral crescent held in place by floral
uprights, forming a sylvian bower. In
the center of the crescent the Queen
will be seated in a reclining position.
From the six points of the star ropes
of flowers and golden stars will stretch
and the end of each rope will be held
by a richly attired maid-of-honor who
will walk beside the float.
The names of the malds-of-honor,
who will be chosen from native daugh
ters of Oakland and San Francisco, will
not be known until after the meeting,
which is to be held in the Palace Hotel
to-morrow for that purpose.
Yesterday the Ancient Order of
Hibernians held a meeting at Teutonla
Hall, 1320 Howard street, and decided
to turn out in a body â two thousand
strong â in the parade on the 24th. The
society wishes It understood that it is
not parading as a Celtic organization,
but as citizens of California.
In preparing for putting in motion
the vast assemblage which will com
pose the Jubilee parade, the committee
has decided to station troops along
East street and up Market street to
ward the City Hall. Those companies
who will be unable to be in this line
will be stationed on the various streets
running off Market street to the south
and will fall Into line in turn as the
procession moves on.
It has been decided to make a com
petition between the regular troops
and the militia a feature of the parade,
with a view of determining the rela
tive efficiency of both. Owing to the
number of organizations signifying
their intention of taking part In the
parade, the committee having charge
of that matter has decided that all or
ganizations intending to participate
shall send in their notification before
January 15, and not as previously an
nounced before January 17.
Besides the regular military and so- i
cial organizations there will be a body j
of over five hundred school children in !
the parade, under the direction of Pro
fessor George Miehling of the Olympic j
Club, who has been drilling them spe- >
cially for the occasion. Because of ;
this and so that the children may have
plenty of time to enjoy the Jubilee to
the utmost, the Board of Education j
may decide to give the schools a week's j
vacation during Jubilee week, instead \
of the regular vacation, which occurs j
in March.
Arrangements are also being made
for a children's day In Golden Gate
Park. The Park Commissioners and
George M. Murphy, who has charge of
the children's playground, are anxious
to give the little ones a royal good
time. So they are going to ask the
society ladies of the city to raise
among their friends $1006 to provide
candy and other good things for the
Jess fortunate youngsters of the city.
There will be plenty of sport for
those of an athletio turn of mind. On
January 25 there will ba a football

game between members of the Na
tional Guard and the regular army,
and on the 27th the combined turners*
societies will give a monster entertain
ment in Woodward's Pavilion.
Native Californians are not the only
ones to whom the Jubilee is a matter
of moment. The Chinese are more
stirred up over this than over anything
that has ever occurred in this city.
They intend taking part in the parade
and will have their own marshals and
a division all tp themselves.
An Interesting and unique feature of
the night illumination will be fur
nished by the management of the Mt
Tamalpais Scenic Railway Company,
who intend to convert the top of the
mountain into a flaming volcano by
means of an unlimited quantity of red
fire.
Yesterday the general committee of
arrangements in charge of Nevada
County's proposed exhibition of mining
products met. Members attended from
all parts of the country and so much
enthusiasm was shown that not less
than 150 tons of gold-bearing ores and
gravel will be sent down.
The following executive committee
was appointed: W. F. Englebright,
John F. Kidder, E. M. Preston, A. S.

The mine is badly damaged. Although
the cause of the explosion has not been
determined, it is believed to have re

shots fired. No. 5 is the largest shaft of
the Mount Carmel Company and this
winter It has been worked by three
shifts, aggregating 300 miners.

a story that would
seldom be told if women would but properly
prepare themselves for the duties of moth-
erhood. If a woman will take the right cara
of the organs that make motherhood possi-

that thia duty should be a cruel torture.

made it so.

Cruel and Persistent Attacks on

REV. BURT HOWARDTALKS
Admits That He May Have Besn Made
wn Unconscious Instrument In
the Conspiracy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9.â Rev. Burt
Estes Howard, the pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, is
one of the leading spirits in the prose
cution undertaken by the League for
Better City Government against Wal
ter L. Webb. He is one of the three
who constitute the municipal reform
committee of the league. The other two
are George Parsons and Charles For
man. This committee is in charge of
all matters pertaining to the exposure
and punishment of wrong-doing in the
public affairs of the city.
Mr. Howard declares that there Is no
conspiracy to undo Mr. Webb so far as
he knows, but in the course of an inter
view he was forced to admit that
there were a number of things in con
nection with the school board scandal
that he did not know, and before the
interview was ended he confessed that
he might have been made an uncon
scious instrument in such a conspiracy.
If he had been, he said, he would place
himself right as soon as he was con
vinced of that fact.
This admission was made after his |
consideration was asked of the pecu
liar relationship that exists between T.
E. Gibbon, W. A. Cheney, W. B. Cline, j
and F. K. Rule, and the further fact !
stated that Messrs. Gibbon, Cheney |
and Cline had made personal appeals
for the reinstatement of Miss Mac \
Owen as a teacher and that Webb had i
made such appeals futile.
What came to Mr. Howard as the
greatest surprise was the information
that T. E. Gibbon was part owner of
the Herald newspaper, and that the
Times was most bitterly opposed to
that wing of the Republican party
with which Webb is identified. Had
he been informed of the further fact
that F. K. Rule was part owner of the
Express he would probably have been I
even more surprised. He would then i
also have understood, as many people j
already understand, why these three
newspapers have acted as if controlled
by one mind in their malicious, unfair ,
and persistent attacks on Webb and i
why they have been almost hysterical :
in their defense of J. H. Braly, whose ;
offense as a public official is more ap- \
parent and more heinous than that
charged against Webb. It will not be
amiss to again show how Gibbon, Che
ney, Cline and Rule have joint and
several reasons for the persecution of
"Webb.
Gibbon, Cheney and Cllne sought to
have Miss Mac Owen reinstated In the
School Department without success,
owing to the obduracy of Webb. Gib
bon and Cheney are respectively at
torneys for the Los Angeles Electric
and Los Angeles Lighting Companies,
of both of which Cline is president.
Gibbon is vice-president of the Los An
geles Terminal Railway Company, and
Rule is auditor, secretary and treas
urer of that corporation. Rule is pres
ident of the League for Better City
Government. Gibbon is a director of
that organization and Cheney is a
member of it.
It is well known that the league,
through Charles Cassat Davis, made a
bold but unsuccessful attempt to or
ganize the Board of Education a year
ago. Their efforts, it is also well
known, were defeated by Webb. Hence
Webb is doubly persona, non grata
â with all these gentlemen.
Not the least significant of the inci
dents connected with "the prosecution
of Webb was the failure of the league
to secure the services of two of the
most prominent attorneys of the city-
Henry T. Gage and ex-Judge Variel
It is common report that these gentle
men refused to take the case because
they did not consider the evidence of
a character to bring about a convic
tion.
In justice to the gentlemen named
however, <t must be stated that they
assign other reasons for declining to go
Into the case. Judge Variel's reason is
said to be that he has vowed not to
take any more criminal business Mr
Gage stated that his reasons were sick
ness and a failure to come to a satis
factory financial arrangement with the
league. Both gentlemen aver that Mr
Cline cut no figure in the matter at
all, so far as they knew, in the nego
tiations for their services.
Being the pastor of one of the most
fashionable arid influential churches of
Los Angeles, what the Rev. Burt Estes
Howard has to say of this affair will
no doubt be read with interest.
"The League for Better City Govern
ment," said Mr. Howard, "was organ
ized merely for the purpose of securing
the best type of city government possi
ble, as against the ring or rin^s and
machine and boss politics in both par
ties. The municipal reform committee
was constituted last spring to keep an
eye on persons in the city departments
and in case there seemed to be any cor
rection or improvement to be made they
were to prosecute the work of the
league.
"This Schrpol Board matter was called
to our attention several weeks ago. The
committee was called together, and in
a hasty way organized a plan of cam
paign. Then we secured an attorney.
A number of gentlemen were discussed,
but for one reason or another they did
not seem available. Mr. Gibbon is one
of the board of directors of the league,
and as a logical sequence he was asked
to take hold of the matter."
Speaking of the negotiations with
Mr. Gage, after Gibbon had decided to
go East, Rev. Mr. Howard said: "I
saw Mr. Gage myself, and took to him
a proposition signed by the three mem
bers of the committee. It was a prop
osition to take hold of the matter bo
far as it concerned Mr. Webb, and
such cases as might grow out of it.
Mr. Gage was sick in bed at the time,
and his physician stated he would not
be out of bed until Christmas. Mr. Gib
bon had been called East, and we had
to secure some one immediately. Mr.
Gage said he was interested in our
work, but he could not see his way to
taking the case, as there was no telling:
how much time it would take. He add
ed that he would be very glad to give
us his services as a citizen and to give
advice as an attorney without charge.
"Why wns Mr. Webb In particular
singled out, and why were not Adams
and Axtell prosecuted also?" was ask
ed.
"Mr. Axtell was the first man we
investigated. He confessed. That was
all that was necessary as far as the
Board of Education was concerned.
Then Mr. Adams was Involved through
Mr. Axtell's confession. Mr. Adams
started to defend himself. Then he
made his first confession before the
board, and that ended the case as far
as the investigation went.
"Both Axtell and Adams in making
their statements involved Mr. Webb,
and they involved no one else. As a
logical consequence Mr. Webb was
drawn into it. When we went into
tlir matter there was no more idea
that Mr. Webb was involved than that
you were, and it came to our conimit
t c u^ a surprise. I don't know Mr.
Webb personally."
On being asked why Adams and Ax
tell had not been prosecuted crim
inally Mr. Howard said that a mem
ber of the Grand Jury had informed
him that the Grand Jury had been ad
vised that a charge of perjury could
not be made to stand against either
of these men.
The District Attorney is the legally
constituted adviser of the Grand
Jury, and he is of the opinion that Ax
tell. at least, has been clearly guilty
of perjury.
Continuing Mr. Howard said: "I
think both men should be prosecuted.
If a charge of perjury cannot be made
to stick, they should be prosecuted for
taking bribes from teachers."
"Has the league taken any action to
have the various employes removed
who paid money for their positions?"
"That matter has not come up yet.
We are hard at work on the Webb
matter. The other matters will be
taken up when we get through with
this."
"Has the attention of the league been
called to Mr. Braly's bank discounting
warrants?"
"I don't know that it has."
"Has it ever been called to your at
tention, directly or indirectly?"
"Mr. Poor, one night after the board
had been in session, said he had heard
that Mr. Braly had cashed or discount
ed a couple of teachers' warrants, that
is that Braly's bank had."
"Did the league look into the mat
ter?"
"Not yet. The bank may have dis
counted them, yet Mr. Braly might not
be personally involved. He is not re
sponsible for the transactions of the
bank."
After it had been explained to Mr.
Howard that Braly, as a school >li
rcctor and as president of the bank,
had been a party to a felonious viola
tion of the law he said that so far as
he was concerned the league would
prosecute every guilty man even if it
had to follow corruption into the heart
of the league.
As a concluding question he was
asked if he did not think that Webb
had been unjustly treated by the local
press. To this he returned the follow
ing ron-committal reply: "I am not
prepared to express an opinion on
that.'
BRIBES ARE
OFFERED TO
BEAT HANNA
Continued from First PaÂ«e.
Stark, Redkey of Highland, Rutan of
Carroll and ' other Republicans who
voted with the Democrats last Monday,
have since undergone such fire from
their constituents that they are expect
ed yet to square themselves by voting
for Hanna. While there were ten dis
senting Republican members last week,
the Hanna men say there will be only
two or three this week. And the
changes are attributed more to the
work that has been done in the coun
ties than here.
While there have been charges and
counter charges of bribery, there was
considerable stir to-day over the pub
lication of the following In the Cincin
nati Commercial Tribune and in differ
ent forms In other Republican papers.
"While Senator Hanna and his man
agers-have been careful to make no im
proper use of money in the Senatorial
contest they have ail along known that
the ethics of the case were not so
strictly observed by the opposition.
Therefore, when an opportunity was
offered to get incriminating evidence
against the combine Mr. Hanna's man
agers were quick to improve it. A
trap was set for the opposition,
working through one of the members
of the combine who has been trying to
get away from Senator Hanna. Some
of the opposition kept trying to get an
audience with this member until it was
decided to accommodate them.
"Accordingly, an interview was ar
ranged for in a certain room of a cer
tain hotel, but In advance the precau
tion had been taken by the member to
conceal a stenographer in the room
who took down every word of the in
terview, an important part of which
was An offer of $5000 cash made to the
member if he would vote against Sena
tor Hanna. Just what use will be
made of the stenographer's notes will
be governed by the course of the anti-
Hanna people."
It is stated on good authority that
the foregoing case became known to
the opposition soon after their organ j
made a sensational publication about i
the Grand Jury being called on to in- j
vestigate the action of several workers
for Hanna. At any rate, there has
been nothing said about the Grand
Jury's work since last Wednesday. The
notes of the secreted stenographer
have been written out and they com
prise several pages of matter which is
in the possession of a very prominent
Republican. The two men who are ac
cused of offering $5000 are as well
known in Ohio politics as are either
the senior or junior Senator pr the
Governor. One of them holds an im
portant State office and the other has
been an Important official and leader
in this city.
These two prominent workers against
Hanna were not the ones in the room
with the member of the Legislature
and his concealed stenographer, but
they sent their man to the legislator's
room, and when the member insisted
on knowing who authorized the offer
the names of these two prominent par
ties were named authorizing the offer
of- SSOOO.
Ex-Governor CharJes Foster, who
was Secretary of the Treasury under
Harrison, arrived in the city to-night.
He has been considered as a compro
mise candidate for Senator, and by
some considered as unfriendly to Han
na, but he soon declared himself for
the Senator under the existing cir
sumstances and was in conference with
the Senator soon after his arrival.

LITTLE ROCK. Ark.. Jan. 9.â
Charred and burned beyond all sem
blance of human beings, the remains of
Marcus McGeisey and Palmer Simpson,
two Seminole Indians who a few days
ago murdered Mrs. James Simmons,
are still resting in chains against the
blackened trunk of an oak tree in the
Seminole station, where, on Friday
night, they met their death In the most
awful manner conceivable at the hands
of an Oklahoma mob. The flesh is burn
ed fram the bones and lies in greasy
and ill-smelling particles in the ashes
on the ground. The fingers and hunds
are burned from the frames and the
ghastly skeletons, bereft of feet and
ankles, stand on blackened bones in the
ashes on the ground. Every vestige of
hair and flesh are burned from the
heads and the clinched teeth of the
dead men shoAv the great determination
to endure their awful punishment in
silence, with which the red men died.
The scene is a fascinating one for the
curious and has been visited by many
people since yesterday morning.
Additional details of the horrible
work of the mob near Maud postoffice,
in the Seminole Nation, last Friday
night, were received here to-day. Ac
cording to this information, the mob's
work is not yet finished and will only
be completed when four more Indians
have been dealt with in the same man
ner as McGeisey and Simpson. The
citizens' posse was scouring the coun
try for the four men when the messen
ger left Maud, and it is probable that at
least part of the quartet have, by
this time, paid the penalty decreed by
the maddened populace.
The crime which led to the burning of
the two men was committed on last
Thursday. Marcus IfcGetoey was the
owner of some property, on his land
lived a white family named Simmons.
During the absence of the husband on
Thursday, IfcGetoey went to the Sim
mons cabin and asked for a drink of
water. Mrs. Simmons was at home
with her four small children. The In
dian was given the water and he then
asked for a saddle.
On being refused the saddle Mr-
Geisey grabbed the woman, who had
her 6aby In her arms, and dragged her
out of the house. When the woman at
tempted to run away the Indian B<i^--il
a Winchester and dealt her a deadly
blow on the head, crushing the skull.
The woman died instantly.
The murdered woman's husband did
i not return Thursday evening and the
; children were unable to remove the
' body into the house, from which It had
fallen into the yard. The little ones
stayed up and watched their dead
mother's body untfl the bitter cold
compelled them to relax their vigilance
and seek shelter from the weather in
the cabin. During the night the body
was almost devoured by hogs.
The news spread rapidly Friday
morning and the whole populace for
twenty miles around was aroused.
About twenty Indians were arrested.
The oldest child told the crowd that
M'-Geisey was the guilty man, and a
posse of twenty determined men went
:to arrest him. Simpson was at Mc-
Geisey's home when the posse arrived,
and both were taken into custody. A
rope was secured and the prisoners
were strung up by the neck. On be
ing let down and given an opportunity
to talk, both confessed to the crime and
named four others \vh.Â», they declared,
i were equally guilty. It developed that
the Indians decided tfÂ» pet rid of cer
tain white settlers and that McGeisey
had been hired to do the murder.
Posses were at once sent in search of
the other four Indians, and it was de
cided to have a wholesale lynching as
as they could ba captured. As
night came on. however, and the other
four were not enptured, the ritixem
changed their plan and determined to
dispose of McGeisey and Sjmpson with
out further delay. The feeling was so
bitter against them that the crowd
would not be satisfied with the ordi
nary method of lynching, and it was
voted to burn them at the stake. The
victims were accordingly chained to a
post oak tree. Fence rails and dry wood
were then piled high about them and in
a few minutes the Indians were wrap
ped in roaring flames, while the tim
bers crackled beneath their feet.
Never a word did the Indians utter
while being roasted alive. They ap
parently saw that they wore powerless
to resist and endured their lot like
stoics. The crowd was composed of
about thirty men and the work was
done in a quiet but thorough and de
termined manner. Posses continued
the search for the other Indians, and it
is very probable that if captured they
will be dealt with In a like manner.
The man bringing this information
states that there are grave fears of an
outbreak among the Indians, and ho
believes bloodshed Is certain to follow.

WILL DEFEAT

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
Call office. Rlggs House,
Washington, Jan. 9.
Interest In the Senate proceedings for
the .week centers In the promised de
bate of the treaty for the annexation
of Hawaii, which will be taken up nn
Monday. Senator Davis has given
notice that he will move an executive
session or the Senate for consideration
each day until the treaty shall be.
finally disposed of. The first effort on
Monday will be to secure open doors
for the debate. This motion will be
made by Senator Pettigrew of the op
position, but there is no likelihood that
it will carry.
The' prevailing opinion is that the
debate will not be prolonged on the
treaty, but theories as to the length of
time will vary all the way from a week
to a month. The opposition to â¢ the
treaty assert that they have no dis
position to prolong the discussion, ow
ing to their confidence in their ability
to defeat the treaty. They claim thir
ty-five votes in opposition, and state
that among these there will be more
than one Republican. Senator Morrlll
adheres to his original determination
to oppose the ratification resolution,
and he is preparing a speech on that
side of the question. The name of Sen
ator Money on the Democratic side is
added to the list of supporters of the
treaty, making five Democrats who will
certainly favor annexation. Senator
Butler (Pop.), whose position has not
heretofore been generally known, to
day announced himself as opposed to
ratification.
It may be accepted as true that if the
opponents of ratification become lor
oughly convinced that they can secure
the one-third vote necessary to accom
plish that end they will allow the vote
to come without delay, reserving any
dilatory tactics to which they may be
disposed to resort for use in connection
vlth the consideration of the Joint res
olution for annexation which would fol
low the defeat of the treaty. This reso
lution would require only a majority
vote, and it is conceded on all hands
that the annexationists have the MOM
sary majority.
In open session the calendar presents
many subjects that may recjivo atten
tion, Including specially t l .c Immigra
tion bill and the census bill, the latter
attorning a basis for speeches upon the
civil vice. Senator Pall-bank* has
given notice of a speech on the .immi
gration bill on Tuesday, and Senator
Butler will speak on his resolution
providing for the election of Federal
Judges by the people some day during
the week.
Discussion of the financial question
is also among the probabilities.
Senator Davis is expected to open the
Hawaiian debate with a set speech on
Monday, but there Is a possibility that
he will defer his main argument until
later in the discussion.
The civil service debate, which has
been in progress in the House during
the past week, will be concluded, prob
ably, on Tuesday, when the vote will
be taken on the motion to strike out
the appropriation for the mainten
ance of the commission. The motion
is foredoomed to defeat, so that the
present contributions to the literature
of this vexed question will eventuate
In nothing. The debate, however, has
served to define the position of the
members. The debate has proved that
comparatively few of the enemies of
the system are willing to go to the
length of voting for the repeal of the
law. It is claimed that a preliminary
canvass â¢of the Republicans of the
House has developed over 100 on the
side who are willing to vote for a modi
fication of the law. If with, these
could be combined the Democratic op
ponents of the law, many of whom
are against the entire law and desire to
see it wiped off the statute books, they
could probably command a majority.
But quite a number of Democrats
whose hostility to the law is outspoken"
say they will not vote for the modifi
i cations of the law, which will simply
j result in the removal of Democrats
from office and the substitution of Re
publicans. They prefer, if it is not to
; be repealed, to see the law stand as it
i is. The entire Popullstic strength will
oppose every motion to repeal or modi
fy the law.
After the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill is out of the
way, f ither the agricultural or the dip
lomatic and consular bill will be
taken up, and an urgency deficiency
will be ready, so that the remainder of
th% week, except Saturday, set apart
for paying tribute to the memory of
the late Representative Milliken of
Maine, will be occupied with appropri
ation bills. The diplomatic and con
sular bill is very likely to cause ex
tended debate on the pending foreign
questionsâ Cuba, Hawaii, the situa
tion in the Orient, etc., any one of
which could be made a fruitful theme
of discussion. It is to be the intention
of the Democrats to force the Republi
cans to define the administration's po
sition toward Cuba's Independence
during the debate.
FEARS FOR THE SAFETY

SEATTLE. Jan. 9.â Some apprehen
sion Is felt at the non-arrival of Cap
tain Phil Ray. U. Â£. A., who was sent
by the War Department last summer
to inquire into the necessity of mili
tary occupation of the Yukon territory
in Alaska. Captain Ray expected to
leave for the Yukon as soon as winter
traveling became good, and to reach
Washington by the first of February.
None of the recent arrivals from Daw

This Kb Regarded as a Good Omen and
the Breakup of the Long
Drought.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Jan. 9.-The rainfall of
the past wook has had a very bene
ficial effect upon the crops of this val
ley. The long dry season had dried
and hardened the ground and the grain
sown In December had not obtain^!
a start. Now It will sprout and grow,
and if the spring conditions should be
favorable, everything will turn out
well for the farmers. There is con
siderable plowing yet to be done in the
valley and it will now be pushed rap
idly forward. A few more showers
will be sufficient for the early setting
of the grain, but what is of the great
est importance is the spring raina.
Should these be plentiful, there will be
no crop failure Jn the Santa Clara Val
ley. The fvuit trees are looking well,
as not mu/h rain Is needed for them
until February or March. The sum
mits of the mountains on either side
of the valley are now coveied with
enow, an indication that more rain will
follow soon.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 9.â There was
a couple of hours' rain here last even-
Ing, followed by a nortnwest wind
which rapidly evaporated that which
had not soaked into the ground as it
fell. While there was no serious com
plaint in this vicinity of a lack of
moisture, still the rain of last night
must have been very welcome to the
farmers of high ground, of which there
is much in this county. The bottom
lands did not need it. The protracted
cold weather, with severe frosts, has
done more than anything else toward
retarding growing crops, Â»but there
have been no reports or Injury thereby.
Some grain is a couple of inches above
ground already and with warmer
weather and warm rains rapid growth
will be made.
PACIFIC GROVE. Jan. 9.â An un
expected drenching rain began falling
here at noon to-day and has continued
with slight intermission ever since. Re
ports from the surrounding country
state that the downpour is general
throughout this section. This is the
first rain of any consequence since
early in December and will be a great
boon to farmers hereabouts. At 6p.
m. the precipitation was 5 of an inch
and present indications point to an all
night rainstorm.
POMONA, Jan. 9.â Tne most satis
factory rain in Pomona Valley and all
this section this season has been falling
since sundown last evening. The ranch
men, fruit-growers and all who live by
agriculture directly or Indirectly are
rejoicing. For several weeks the roads
in Pomona Valley have been almost as
dusty as in the summer months and
orange and lemon growers have been
irrigating their properties the same as
in the rainless period of the year. Near
ly two Inches has fallen during the
present rain.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 9.â The back
bone of the drought, which has been
causing the farmers and stockraisers
much uneasiness, has been broken.
Rain started to fall about 4 o'clock this
morning. By the middle of the fore
noon half an Inch had fallen, and the
indications are that about three times
this amount will fall to-night. The
mountains are covered with snow
which extends low down on the foot
hills.
SANTA CRUZ. Jan. 9â Rain and hail
have been alternately falling all the
afternoon. The Alerts came from Ala
meda to play the Beachcombers, but
owing to the rain the game could not
be played.
MODESTO, Jan. 9.â Farmers living
west of this place report a fall of snow
along the San Joaquin River this after
noon. The storm was from northwest
to southwest, passing within three
miles of Modesto. At Paradisa Oar
dens the proprietor, N. E. De Yoe, re
ports the fall heavy enougli to make
hte g; '">uncl white.
STOCKTON, Jan. 9.â A little rain fell
this afternoon, but ceased inside of half
an hour. There was no rainfall of any
consequence last night, which ended dry
and cold. The crops have only been
temporarily benefited by what rain has
fallen. The sky remains cloudy and the
farmers are anxious for a further pre
cipitation.
MONTEREY, Jan. 9.â Except a slight
downpour on Thursday night and a
sprinkle last night, no rain has fallen
here for over a month. The drought,
coupled with the heavy frosts of the
last three weeks. Is likely to seriously
damage cereals as well as fruit and
garden truck.
L<Â»S ANGELES, Jna. !>.â Nearly two
Inches of rain has fallen since Friday
last, the storm extending over the
greater part of Southern California, and
doing great good to the agricultural
and horticultural Interests. The pre
diction of a dry season for Southern
California seems to be a false one and
the farmers and fruit growers are Jubi
lant. The present downpour is suffi
cient to moisten the soil for winter
plowing, thus insuring a crop of grain
next season, the conditions being favor
able. The rain has also augmented to
a sufficient degree the supplies of water
for irrigation purposes and has made
winter Irrigation of orange and decidu
ous fruit trees unnecessary. The rain
fall for the present season Is but a
little short of the average up to this
time. Trees are looking well and have
suffered nothing this season from lack
of rain. The rain continued during the
greater part of to-day, but it is clear
to-night.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 9.â Rain has fallen
at Intervals during the day, and it is
cloudy, with frequent showers to-night.
The precipitation up to 5 p. m . was
0.39, making 1.R9 for the season. Ad
vices from t^> Interior indicate that the
country has fared much better than
the city. While the rain has been
rather light, both north and south
there is a broad belt to the eastward
taking in El Cajon Valley, that has re
ceived a good soaking. One inch and
forty-five-hundredtha at Morena is the
largest rainfall reported at any point
but from half an inch to an inch has
fallen at other places. Some of the
most productive parts of the county
are included in the area covered by' the
storm, and from such reports as have
come In there seems no question that
the downpour has been heavy enough
to prove a blessing to the farmers.

NEW YORK, Jan. 9.â Rev. Dr. John

gation his resignation as pastor of the

Little Delight, who ran like a little

The decisions of Judge Cummings are

THWARTS ENGLAND
IN CHERISHED PLANS
FOR SOUDAN CONTROL.
Quietly Advancing From Both East and West,
France Has Established Continuous Con
nection Across the Dark Continent
The situation in the Eastern Soudan
as developed within the last few days
rightly causes great concern through
out the courts of Europe. The posi
tion is so delicate and the attitude of
the representatives of both nations so |
determined that a chance contact
even may cause the spark that will
flare up the red flames of war between
the two leading nations of Europe.
In the struggle for territory In
Africa, begun years ago, England has
distanced all her rivals, though France
has followed close on her heels as to
the number of square miles.
By the treaty of Berlin in 1884 all the
coast line from Cape Blanco south and
around to Cape Guardafui was al
lotted in nearly equal proportions to
the. participating nations â England,
France, Germany, Italy and Portugal
â leaving the questions of â "hinterland"
and- "spheres of Influence. to be set- 'â 
tied between the nations having con
r tiguous interests. Italy's African col- I
onization career was short and disas
trous. Portugal had by previous oc
cupation more litoral than any of the
others, but has made no extension of
consequence. Germany has been so cir
cumstanced in the four quarters where
she obtained sea frontage that great
Widening of influence was out of the
question. "With the English for neigh
bors she has been badly beaten in the
great grab game. The "schurtz
briefs" of the young German
Kcnperor, so effectual when directed
against weak and Ignorant black
princes who attempted to stay his
progress, availed nothing against the
. greedy land-grabbers of Great Brit
, am. By the use of the red paint-brush
. in London and questionable claims of
ancient treaties with interior chief
.__â â  tains and the aggressive advance of
r.her explorers and traders, supported !
.: â always by the ready presence of her \
V:.coionial troops, England has managed <
. : hold the hinterland spread of her I
. .jT'i^hbor within very meager bounds,
j 'While she forcibly gerrymandered the
â /map of South Africa until she claimed
' ; the greater part and the choicest of
â¢..'â .the whole country.
:: The conditions were different, how
..,.ey< r, to the north. Instead of the in- I
'/'"ert Portuguese and slow non-coloniz- â 
V lng Germans she has had to meet and I
".settle hinterland questions with the :
... French, with no mean experience in i
colonial enterprises. These, with no i
â {. grand blast of trumpets and parade of ;
.-'troops and ships, but quietly and j
:â¢'. surely, from Algiers and Senegal on |
th--- north and west and the Kong
; country and Dahomey on the Guinea ;
: coast, have completely shut within
' Email compass the British at Sierra ;
Leone, Ashantee and the Lagos coun
try, and effectuated their title by oc- j
cupation and administration of gov- i
i ernment over nearly the whole of i
. "West Africa, including the large and
r fertile and populous Upper Niger re
gion and the Central Soudan north of
Sokoto.
These acquisition? with French ronpo
have given France some two airl a half
million square miles of the whole eleven
millions in Africa, against three mil
lions of Great Britain, counting Egypt
and Nubta.
Two years ago there remained un
claimed by any European nation some
thing less than one and a half million
pquare miles, which included a number
cf Rmall, Jnrif-pendfnt states about Lake
Tchad and between it and the Congo
basin on the southeast, Abyssinia on
the east and the Nile and Libyan
Desert on the northeast, generally
known as Central and Eastern Soudan.
Over the latter division, formerly
ruled by Egypt, the Mahdi and his suc
cessor, Abdullah Khalifa, have exer
cised rule from Korawko to Lake Vic
toria. From the defeat and death of
Gordon at Khartoum in 1885, nn
European has set foot in the
country except as a captive un
til within the last few wefks, when the
French have carried thHr colors to
Fashoda, on the White Xile. and most
likely ere this, by an understanding
with the Mahdi, have advanced them
nn toward Khartoum, their ulti
mate goal.
A great coup d'etat has indeed been
achieved,
. From French Congo on the Atlantic
as a base the active Gaul has developed
â¢ the "hinterland" proposition on the
Congo and Central Soudan even more

DARK CONTINENT.
posts all over Central Soudan to . the
verge of the Nile basin.
Now comes the final move, the de
nouement of the quiet play that has
been made from both sides of the con
tinent at the same time. Captains
Marchand and Baratin, with a number
of other officers and a well-equipped es
cort of white and native troops, setting
out last spring, secretly, as It were, have
pushed their way up through the Congo
country via Bangui, Ahiras and Semio,
over the divide to the head waters of
the Bahr-el-Ghazil, floating down
which in a vessel which they have car
ried with them in parts, and set up on
its banks, have, it is said, reached
Fashoda, on the White Nile. A little
later In the spring M. Bouchamps, who
went with Embassador Legarde to
Abyssinia, with the favor and assist
ance of Negus Menelik, set out from
Djibouti, the French port on the Gulf
of Aden, and made his way via Harar
and Groa westward to the Nile, and
meeting the Marchand party a.t Fa
shoda raised the French standard and
proclaimed the sovereignty of France
over the whole region traversed from
sea to sea.
All this has been done so quietly that
not even the subordinate officials of the
French Government were aware of the
plans, and while Sir Hubert Kitchener,
with his Anglo-Egyptian army has
been lying practically idle at Berber,
300 miles from Khartoum, where the
Mahdi holds his seat of government.
The control of the Egyptian Soudan
down to the lakes and the establish
ment of connections from Cairo via
Khartoum and Victoria Nyanza to
Mombasa on the Indian Ocean, has
long been the aim of England. To
achieve it she has from first to last
spent much blood and nearly Â£200,000,
000. The French, by winning Emperor
Menelik on the one side and a well
timed, a well conducted dash from the
other, have planted themselves on the
ground, and everything indicates that
they mean to hold their position.
Large stores and war supplies have
been accumulated at Djibouti and a
railroad put under construction via
Harar toward Fashoda. A Frenchman,
M. Lioutiff, has been placed by Mene
lik In the governorship of Southwest
Abyssinia, fronting the British on the
south.
Menelik has before measured pwords
with England and come off with honor.
In securing his alliance Prance not
only gets short access from the sea to
the Nile, but a ready and strong arm
aa well. She has completely outgener
aled and outwitted England. Will the
latter withdraw from the field? The
question will soon be answered. Al
ready the word has gone forth and
Sirdor Kitchener's columns are run
ning their advance southward toward
Khartoum. Should they find the French
there before them the clash will surely
come.

GOLDEN ORES
Fabulously Rich Islands
on the Alaskan
Coast.
Inexhaustible Supply of Aurif
erous Rock Awaiting

Ledges Easy of Access, Ideal Mill
Sites and an Abundance of
Water and Fuel.
Special Dlnpatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. 9. â Southeastern
Alaska towns. Including Wrangel and
Juneau, are greatly Interested In what
are described as mountains of gold
ores found on the Gravina, Annette
and Revlllagigedeo islands of the
Alaskan coast. Immense ledges of
copper and gold ore have been uncov
ered on these islands. Some locations
have been made, but enough territory
remains where the foot of a white man
has never trodden, to Keep hundreds of
prospectors busy for many years. Solis
Cohen, who has returned to Wrangel
from a cruise among these islands, de
clares that fortunes beyond the wild
est dreams of avarice await their prac
tical and intelligent development. Co
hen says:
"It seems extravagant to speak of
mountains of ore, but that is exactly
what describes these as well as the
Prince of Wales and Mary's Islands.
Hundreds of thousands of tons of ore
are practically ready for smelters or
stamp mills and may be shipped with-
OUt putting a pick beneath ground.
Ledges ten to fifty feet wide, extend
from the beach to the base of the
mountains several miles inland, rising
in places in fantastic shapes like ruins
of ancient castles. Other ledges ex
tend beneath the salt water and may
be stripped at low tide."
Cohen's party blastrd open several
iedges. finding gold mixed with White
quartz in each instance. They believe
values will increase with depth, which
is proven by development work done
on a number of Gravina Island claims,
all of which show up well in free gold.
Cohen says these ledges are compara
tively easy of access, being near land
lor-ked harbor* having seven fathoms
of water, with ideal mill sites and
numerous waterfalls which will fur
nish power for stamp mills. Yellow
cedar is abundant for fuel. On Ttevil
lagig^dpo, about Georges Inlet and
Helen Bay, very rich free milling
ledges have lately been located. Ora
vina, thr richest island, is thirty milee
long and sixteen wide, lying along
Nicholas Passage and Tongas Nar
rows, from four miles opposite New
Metlakahtla to sixteen miles above
Ketchikan.

IONE`S SCHOOL
Business of Importance
Transacted by the
Trustees.
New Superintendent Files His
Official Bond and Makes
Suggestions.
Alleged Shortage In the Contingent
Fund Vigorously Denied by Ex-
Secretary Bernard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
IONE, Jan. B.â The trustees of the
1 Preston School of Industry held their
regular monthly meeting late last night
and much business of importance was
transacted. D. S. Hirshberg, the new
! superintendent, filed his official bond
and made a brief report of contemplat
ed Improvements, such as the starting
i,of a blacksmith shop, in which all the
j repair work and horseshoeing can be
done, and the building of a hortlcul
! tural building, in which plants and
i trees can be propagated, and instruc
tion given to the cadets in both these
lines of industry. The new superin
i tendent reported also that he had ap
pointed Harry H. Budd as supervisor,
! a new office, at a salary of $75 a
i month, and this appointment was unan
imously confirmed by the trustees.
Ex-Superintendent O'Brien, In a
written communication, recommended
the discharge of abo-ut fifteen cadets,
but the trustees did not act on the mat
ter, choosing rather to postpone action
on discharging or paroling inmates un
til sufficient time had elapsed to give
the new superintendent a knowledge
of each case and then act upon his
recommendation.
In the matter of a reported shortage
'of ex-Secretary H. R. Bernard, the
board granted Mr. Bernard a hearing.
i The former secretary claimed that Ex
; pert Wadham broke faith with him in
: submitting an incomplete inspection of
the contingent fund as complete, and
he openly and boldly declared that
there was no shortage and showed sev
eral receipts, among which was one
from the former superintendent, Dr. E.
S. O'Brien, for $200. Mr. Bernard also
declared that the report of ' Expert
Wadham upon the condition of the con
tingent fund was a job to ruin his
(Bernard's) reputation as a bookkeep-
I er.
Trustees Maddox and Tyrrell voted
to postpone action upon accepting
Wadham's report upon the contingent
fund until the next regular meeting of
the board and to permit Mr. Bernard
to go over the tags and the approved
claims on this fund and submit hlB
statement for final action on February
6th.
Mr. Bernard completed the work to
day, and in an interview stated that he
can show that instead of the contin
gent fund showing a shortage, it ac
tually shows a balance of 121 in his fa
vor. Bernard claims that the ex-su
perintendent. Dr. O'Brien, caused all
the trouble by making a demand upon
him for a lump sum. Instead of approv
ing claims and turning them over to
him for settlement, and the ex-secre
tary declares that he will prove that
he has not misappropriated one cent
of the funds even if he has to resort to
prosecutions to have himself set right
in the eyes of the public.
Superintendent Hirshber* started

trip to inspect the reform schools of

QUESADA'S
VERY PETTY
SPITEWORK
Animus of His Award
Against the United
States.
Decision Adverse to the
Claims of Americans
Not Accepted.
Why Argentina's Representa
tive Favored Mexico While
an Arbitrator.
HATRED FOR UNCLE SAM.
It Dates Back to the Time When He
Was Beaten in Diplomacy by
Blalne.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Nrw YORK, Jan. 9.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Behind the exclusive announcement
recently made in the Herald that the
claims of Oberlander of San Diego and
Messenger, citizens of the United
States, against the Government of
Mexico, for damages to their persons
and property by Mexican officers for
$50,000 and $25,000, respectively, had
been decided adversely to the Ameri
can claimants by the arbiter, Senor
Don Vicente G. Quesada, Argentine
Minister at Madrid, there lies an inter
esting history of diplomatic intrigue.
The award of Senor Quesada is not
accepted by the Department of State,
as it is not based upon sound pub
lic or international law. It ignores en
tirely all precedent, the consideration
being that, as the United States had
declined to recognize the rights of the
Government of China to recover in
demnity for the murder of certain
Chinese subjects in Wyoming, It was
precluded from claiming" damages in
the case of Oberlander and Messenger.
Although there is nothing in common
between these cases and the Chinese
murders, the outrage in one case being
perpetrated by officers of Mexico and
in the other by private persons, Senor
Quesada held them to be parallel.
When the matter of arbitration was
first discussed several persons were
considered, but none was found compe
tent until Senor Quesada was sug
gested by Mr. Romero, the Mexican
Minister, who alluded to the fact that
he had been formerly accredited to
Washington, where he had seen ser
vice for several years, and was fami
liar with Knglish and American law,
in addition to civil law. The depart
ment acquiesced in the selection, and
the papers were duly placed in the
hands of Senor Quesada.
When President Harrison determin
ed upon an agpressive attitude toward
Chile during the winter of 1891-92, for
the purpose of recovering the Indem
nity of $75,000 for injuries inflicted
upon American seamen in Valparaiso,
and, in expectation of resistance on
the part of Chile, inaugurated a
movement looking to actual hostilities,
the situation became very grave. Dip
lomatic negotiations were carried on
by Mr. Blame, as Secretary of State.
Mr. Blame received a call from Senor
Quesada, who was then Argentine Min
ister, and who in great confidence
stated that in the event of war with
Chile the United States might desire to
transport troops across the Andes,
through the passes, and the Argentina
Government was prepared to offer cer
tain privileges to the United States.
It was rumored in Buenos Ayres that
a secret treaty of alliance between the
two existed which could only be check
mated by a similar alliance with the
United States. Some further meetings
and correspondence followed.
Mr. Blame in the meantime was ver
bally urging Mr. Montt, the Chilian
plenipotentiary, to ask arbitration,
while the President had let it be known
that he would not submit a question
of honor to the Judgment of others.
These negotiations were taking place
when the President abruptly ordered
that Mr. Egan present at once an ulti
matum demanding indemnity and im
mediate apology.
Senor Quesada meanwhile was busily
1 engaged in drafting a treaty of alliance
' and congratulating himself on the
clever manner in which his instructions
had been accomplished. Mr. Blame, at
the same time, was entertaining and
encouraging proposals for the purpose
of peace from Brazil, against whom
; Senor Quesada was principally direct
ing his shrewdness and diplomatic skill.
Next followed an apology and offer of
reparation on the part of Chile. It
served together with dlplomatlo corre
spondence, then made public, to thor
oughly convince Senor Quesada that he
had been made the victim of his own
Indiscretion. He remained in Washing
ton for a brief period, though sufficient
ly long to openly declare his undying
disgust for everything American, his
pronounced hatred for the United
States in general and its department of
state In particular. Upon his own re
quest he was transferred to Madrid and
departed in silence, without exchang
ing the usual compliments and regrets.
SECRETARY ALGER
IS SERIOUSLY ILL.
Physicians Fear That He Has Typhoid Fever,
and the Outcome Worries Rela
tives and Friends.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 9.â Members of
the family and immediate friends of
Secretary Alger are seriously disturbed
about his illness. His physicians now
fear that he has typhoid fever, and if
this diagnosis should prove correct the
outcome will be In doubt from the
start, as the Secretary is in no condi
tion to contend with the disease.
General Alger has been confined to
his bed for more than three weeks.
To-day the symptoms of typhoid ap
peared, and while the doctors will not
say It is a pronounced case of that
disease, they are apprehensive that
it will turn out that way. They said
to-night that the case would be fully
developed to-morrow If It is typhoid

First Party of Foreigners to Make the
Perilous Journey to the
Sea Coast.
Copyright, ISJB, by James Gordon Bennett.
ALEXANDRETTA, Jan. 9.â We have
reached the seaccrast at last, nearly 900
miles from Treblzond, the traveling be
ing mostly accomplished on horseback.
We are the only foreigners who have
done the whole journey. "We laid out
the route ourselves, and visited what
places we pleased without hindrance.
We found the country settled down and
in fair order. The last city we visited
was Aintab, an important center of
American missionary and educational
work. We sail to-night for Constanti
nople. GEORGE H. HEPWORTH.
PARIS. Jan. 9.â The following is the
summary of a letter written by George
H. Hepworth on the road to Bitlis, dat
ed December 12, 1597: "We have pass
ed through many dangers. Twenty
soldiers of cavalry went ahead to clear
away the snow drifts. Every man has
been ill except the Herald correspond
ent. We know how to take care of our
selves, and the Turk does not. We
avoided the food of the country and
the water, which is deadly. It was a
nine days' trip from Erzeroum to Bit
lis. There are practically no roads, but
I am glad to have come. I
would not have missed the jour
ney for worlds, but I would not take
it again for a mortgage on a thousand
planets. Not far out of Erzeroum we
reached a village of a score of huts,
where a European has never been seen.
The women and children are in rags
and barefooted in some of these vil
lages. Up to a few years ago Armeni
an and Kurdish fathers sold their
daughters for about Â£30 each. I have
never seen so filthy or so contented peo
ple.
"We had a carious experience near
the Persian-Russian frontier in a vil
lage with an unpronounceable name
near here. The Turk who received us
was the landlord, which was a rever
sal of the order of things. He allowed
me to talk freely with a dozen or so of
Armenian villagers. The farm land is
worked on shares, half the profits go
ing to the landlord. We caught sight
of Mount Ararat in the distance and
saw a good deal of Hamidieh cavalry,
who were an important factor in the
last massacres. They are the fiercest
men we ever met. They swear by the
Sultan, and do as they please with
Turk or Christian, fearing no conse
quences."

THE FIRST BUSINESS WEEK
THE new year opens most auspiciously. In
fact, prospects are the brightest of any new
year for a long time. Nowhere on the com
mercial horizon appears a cloud. The reaction in
trade mentioned along in December as being al
most unprecedented for that time of the year is
slowly gaining force, and from all lines of goods
come reports of an increasing demand for supplies.
H indications for the past month are realized, 1898
will be the liveliest business year the United States
has ever seen.
The statistical showing of the country at large
in 1597 is now at hand and the exhibit is gratify
ing. In failures, the year was the best ever known.
The total number of failures of national, State, sav
ings and private banks and loan and trust com
panies in 1897 was 105, a little more than half those
of 1896, and less than one-fifth those of the panic
year, 1893. Liabilities also showed a heavy falling
off, being 60 per cent smaller than in 1896 and 90
per cent smaller than 1893. The number and lia
bilities, however, were slightly larger than 1894.
The percentage of assets to liabilities in 1897 was
only .76, the smallest reported since Bradstreet's
record of bank suspensions was begun.
The bank clearings of the country last week kept
up their favorable showing, there being an increase
of 23.6 per cent over the same week In 1897, only
three cities of any importance showing a decrease.
The great commercial cities exhibited gains rang
ing from .8 per cent (Boston) to 41.8 (Minneapolis).
The gain in New York was 29.9 per cent, in Chi
cago 39.4 per cent, and in San Francisco 31.7 per
cent.
The prospects for the manufacturing staples is
brilliant. The feeling in cotton manufacture is re
ported better, while in woolens the mills are buy
ing heavily to keep abreast of their orders. The
consumption of wool during the past five months
has been the heaviest ever known, which is .veil
illustrated by sales of over 7,000,000 pounds at Bos
ton alone during the closing week of the year,
something unprecedented. The iron trade is en
joying an unusually fine business for the season,
with excellent prospects for a still better movement
as the year advances. Railroad earnings continue
to show a marked increase.
On this coast prospects are as brilliant as in the
East, it not more so. Dealers in almost all lines
are reporting increased demand- for goods, though
there is no marked activity as yet. The possibili
ties contained in the Alaskan demand are but feebly
shown at the moment, but there will be lively times
in this trade in a few weeks. The great produce
staples are showing renewed life and stocks of the
majority are well reduced. It only needs a little
quickening in the demand for wool to start another
boom in this staple. Dried fruits and raisins are
meeting with more call, and at the present rate of
consumption stocks of both will Le found practi
cally nil when the new crop comes forward. Hides
have advanced since last review and are active anft
firm at the improved quotations. The provision
trade rules dull, but this is the normal condition
of this market in January. Beef and mutton are
strong, and hogs are slowly advancing under a
growing scarcity. Hay has again crept up slightly
and bids fair to do some more creeping in this di
rection. The humble potato, too, that common
place esculent which generally is the reverse of sen
sational, is slowly advancing in price under a grow
ing scarcity all over the United States. When the
potato starts in to rise what possibilities are not
contained in the more pretentious staples?
The light rain of last week did not produce much
effect on the local markets. Wheat was undis
turbed. Barley weakened, curiously enough, for
the fall was insignificant in the most important dis
tricts. Hay advanced in the face of it, and oats, too,
rose with light stocks and smaller offerings from
the north. The butter market dropped sharply.
The local financial market remains without fea
ture.
For many days the Examiner had been writing
funny stories about proceedings in Judge Camp
bell's court, stories designed to make the jurist
smile, to woo him to mellow moods. Perhaps the
jurist smiled, but he did not get mellow. It will be
long before the Examiner will be able to find any
thing funny in the department over which he pre
sides. The Judge is no joke.
Perhaps there is something in the rumor that the
Kaiser has secured a gold brick in getting the bay
of Kiaochau from the Chinese, and confirmation of
this will be cheerfully received. The world is just
mean enough to enjoy a laugh at the burglar who
laboriously drills into an empty safe.
While the president of the gas company states
freely that the gas he sells at a high rate is not un
duly poisonous he has not been observed in any ef
fort to promote his health by breathing it.
PLANS FOR CURRENCY REFORM.
THE revival of trade and the gradual substitu
tion of more prosperous conditions for the
stress and pinch that began with the panic of
1893 have somewhat diverted public attention from
the statutory errors in our financial system, which
all observers believed had much to do with that
calamity. Panics come under all systems, but if
it be possible to limit and lessen the known causes
which produce them, leaving them to an entirely
natural origin in the common impulses which af
fect men in the mass to a loss of confidence and
courage in the future, they will be less frequent,
less distressing while they last and of less duration.
The sound-money men and the fiatists alike trace
either the panic itself or its destructive duration to
errors in our financial legislation. These may not
have been errors in the beginning, but have become
so by lapse of time and the growth of the country.
The tailor who cuts a suit for a boy should not be
held guilty of blundering because it does not fit
the owner when he is grown to be a man. It is
quite the fashion of the fiatists to rail at the Re
publican party or at the old Democracy which dis
appeared in Bryan's shadow, because a banking and
currency system quite adequate for thirty millions
of people is not ample enough for seventy millions.
The sound-money men waste no time m accusation,
in "pointing with pride," or "viewing with alarm,"
but have set about finding a remedy, and have pro
posed their plan. Between this plan, or some one
like it, and the plan of the fiatists the people will
be called upon to choose next November in the elec
tion of a new House of Representatives.
The plan of the sound-money men should be wide
ly known, for the plan of the fiatists is kept continu
ally before the public and gains a percentage of con
\erts because no other plan is kept In sight. Cali
fornia must help in the choice and decision of next
November. She has in Mr. John P. Irish a rep
resentative on the Executive Committee of the
Monetary Conference of the sound-money men, and
in Mr. Louis A. Garnett a representative on the
Commission appointed by that Executive Commit
tee, which has just reported.
The Commission consists of ex-Senator George F.
Edmunds of Vermont, General George E. Leigh
ton of Missouri, T. G. Bush of Alabama, W. B.
Dean of Minnesota, Charles S. Fairchild and Stuy
vesant Fish of New York, J. W. Fries of North
Carolina, Louis A. Garnett of California, Professor
J. Laurence Laughlin of the Chicago University, C.
Stuart Patterson, dean of the Faculty University
of Pennsylvania, and Robert S. Taylor of Indiana.
Every division of the country being represented, it
is fair to assume that the needs of each are met and
merged in the report.
The plan reported by this Commission is em
bodied in a bill offered in the House by Mr. Over
street of Indiana. It deals with:
First â The standard of value.
Second â The silver currency.
Third â The demand obligations of the Govern
ment.
' Fourth â The banking system.
To-day The Call undertakes to state the plan
under the first head and will follow it until it is com
pletely before our readers.
The Commission proposes to make silver certi
ficates redeemable in silver dollars. The people, by
their Government, own a large stock of silver bul
lion, silver dollars and silver in the smaller coins,
and are therefore interested in the continued use
of silver as currency, and in the maintenance of the
currency at par with gold.
The dollar, by reason of its bulk, has proved un
suitable and unpopular for circulation. Though
transported free by the Government in order to
force it into circulation, the highest sum ever in
circulation was $67,000,000, and at present it amounts
to $60,196,778.
There are now in circulation $354,355,031 in paper
notes as currency in $1, $2 and $5 bills, of which
$154,965,473 are silver certificates and $199,389,558
are greenbacks, treasury notes of 1890 and national
bank notes.
Retiring all of these small notes except silver cer
tificates and supplying their place with such cer
] tificates in the same denominations will make room
for $199,389,558 of such certificates. As there are
; outstanding in larger denominations silver certifi
; cates amounting to $229,205,031, their conversion
into the smaller bills will leave in circulation of the.
j large bills only $29,815,473, to be redeemed in silver
dollars when presented. The small notes in green
backs, national bank currency and treasury notes
I of 1890, when retired would be replaced by larger
notes. When these steps are taken the currency
of the country of all denominations below $10 will
be silver coin and silver certificates redeemable in
coined dollars of that metal and the $2 50 and $5
gold pieces. If it be found that parity is not en
dangered, the whole stock of 452,713,793 silver dol
lars owned by the Government may be issued in
these small notes. If, however, this stock be so
large as to imperil parity and put the standard of
value in danger, the stock may be reduced by with
drawal and sale of the coins as buHion.
This part of the plan, like all its part 9, is de
clared by the Commission to depend upon inflexi
ble maintenance of the gold standard of value, as
the only means of securing an ample and flexible
medium of exchange.
The other features of the report will be consid
ered in their order.
The enterprising officer who arrested a Stanford
professor as a counterfeiter offered to bet $20 that
he had the right man. Of course he would have
lost the money, which would have made him un
happy. Now he has only to worry him recollec
tion of the fact that he put an honest gentleman
in jail; which, judged by common knowledge con
cerning officers in general, will not be reckoned a
burden grievous to be borne.
Uruguay's President, the telegraph states, is pre
paring for an emergency. He must be a peculiar
sort of official to be in need of this. Part of the
duty of a President down that way is to be pre
pared all the time. The Government in Uruguay
consists of a series of emergencies, with here and
there a ciimax.
The man in Paris who killed a woman just after
she had thrown vitriol upon him deserves well.
There is no adequate punishment provided for the
class of offenders to which she belonged, but in lieu
of a suitable treatment for them even mere killing
is better than nothing.
Accounts of lynching in communities ordinarily
law-abiding do not form pleasant reading. In fact,
there is nothing less desirable, except accounts of
the manner in which criminals are permitted to
escape. Thoughtful people have figured out that
there is some connection between the two.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 1898.
RECIPROCITY AND CALIFORNIA.
AMONG the political affairs California will
have to watch with close attention this win
ter are the commercial treaties now being ar
ranged with foreign countries under the terms of
the Dingley tariff. While it is fair to assume the
administration will guard the interests of this State
as well as of the rest of the Union, there is never
theless a possibility of injury to some of our largest
industries unless we ourselves keep guard over them.
Under section 3 of the tariff the President, in ar
ranging commercial treaties, is authorized to sus
pend duties upon argols, wine lees, brandies or other
spirits, champagne and all other sparkling wines,
still wines, vermouth, painting and statuary. Under
section 4 he is permitted, with the consent of the
Senate, to reduce any or all duties levied by the
tariff 20 per cent in making such treaties. It will be
seen that if treaties are negotiated under section 3
the concessions granted to foreign countries will fall
almost wholly upon the wine and spirit industry,
and this is one in which California has a most im
portant stake.
The countries that have shown most willingness to
arrange treaties of a commercial kind with us are
France, Germany and Italy. All of these desire con
cessions in the way of lower or no duties on wines
and fruits, and Germany and France desire also a
reduction of the duly on sugar. Negotiations for
these treaties are now under way and of course
some of the demands of the foreign countries will
have to be granted.
It so happens that articles of export from the
three countries named come into conflict with the
products of California more than with those of any
other State. Many sections of the Union would
willingly admit wines free of duty and sugar and
fruit at reduced duties from Germany and France
tor the sake of obtaining markets in those coun
tries for pork, wheat or corn. The East would gain
by such treaties and California would be a heavy
loser.
The dissimilarity between California and the East
is the source of danger in this regard. Our rural
products are more like those of Europe than like
those of the States beyond the Rockies. The products
on which they would most willingly grant conces
sions are those on which we have the most need of
protection. It is for this reason that watchfulness
on our part is necessary.
It is clear that if we grant a free admission to the
wines of Italy. France and Germany California
would suffer. If we grant a2O per cent reduction
en sugar and fruits to those countries California
would suffer. Against any propositions of the kind,
therefore, the State should be prepared to act
piomptly and vigorously. Reciprocity is an excel
lent thing when wisely carried out, as was done by
Secretary Blame during the Harrison administra
tion, but it will be far from excellent if negotiated on
terms that will give all the benefits to one section of
the Union and throw all the cost upon another.
BRYAN'S speech at the Jackson day banquet
of the Democrats of Chicago will neither in
crease nor diminish his reputation. It was
essentially the same as all his utterances from the
stump â a distortion of fact, a misrepresentation of
political opponents, an appeal to class antagonisms
and an effort to prove that the property interests
of the country are hostile to the rights of the people.
Bryan declared the legislation accomplished by
the McKinley administration has in no wise ad
vanced the welfare of the industries of the country.
In the face of the general revival of trade and the
advancing prices of the products of all forms of ru
ral industry this was a bold assertion for a man to
make even at a banquet where the spirit of truth is
sacrificed to the spirit of the bottle.
Mr. Bryan, who dors not drink and was intoxi
cated only by the exuberance of his own rhetoric,
felt that he had got himself upon a dizzy height and
sought for some fact to stand on. He found it in
the recent reduction of wages by the New England
cotton mills. Here he said is the proof that wages
are going down all over the land and the manhood
of the nation is being crushed by protection and
gold money.
It is true there has been a reduction of wages in
New England cotton mills. It is equally true the
reduction was forced by the competition of the
cheap labor of the Southern States. Bryan has
two remedies to offer â free trade and free silver.
The first would expose the wage earners of every
American industry to the competition of the cheap
labor of the whole world. The second would re
duce the value of wages from the gold standard to
the silver standard, a reduction in purchasing power
equal to about 50 per cent. For a wage earner to
accept cither of these remedies would be like cut
ting off a leg to cure a corn.
In a tirade directed at Secretary Gage, Bryan
said: "He possesses a sublime faith in the super
iority of money over man, and a supreme contempt
for the rights, the interests and the opinions of the
people at large." With all due respect to the dig
nity of a man who has been a candidate for the
Presidency and is still traveling on it by the aid of
free passes from railroad corporations, that asser
tion was positively silly. Mr. Gage no more than
any other Republican believes in the superiority of
money over man. but he does believe a man with
out money ought to have a chance to earn it and
ought also to get good money for his work.
Mr. Bryan would do well to ponder the wisdom
of the aphorism of Speaker Reed: "It would be
better for some men not to know so much than to
know so many things that are not so."
Without presuming to offer much advice to the
people in the Klondike, it surely will not be amiss
to suggest that some of the confidence men now
bound in that direction offer fine material for the
old vigilantes to use in getting into practice again.
It seems almost like a WMtc of time for the
powers to open a field wherein missionaries may
teach a creed in which "Thou shalt not steal" ap
pears. The powers are not leaving anything worth
stealing.
Dr. Wilson's scheme to provide a home for work
ing women is so reasonable and humane as to ap
peal to everybody who desires to see the world made
better and happier.
Turkey is in some respects a polite nation. Once
more it has been told that it must settle the claims
of America. Yet nobody has heard Turkey ex
claim "Chestnuts!"
Gas Inspector Taylor might profitably employ
some of his time in ascertaining the nature of gas.
Knowledge of this kind is useful to one in his line
oi business.
BRYAN'S LATEST.
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS
BY A MODEST CRITIC
The annexationists must purely be
In the last ditch. Truly enaugh, they
never have had a fighting chance
since the truth began to be told about
the neat little schemes to abandon the
Monroe doctrine, saddle on this coun
try a few million dollars of debts, and
admit to American citizenship a horde
of coolies. There has never been a
sound argument made on the side of
annexation, for the very good reason
that tione can be made. We have,
nevertheless, heard some erratic views
on the quesMon. For instance, Senator
Morgan was recently reported as say
ing that he saw a revolution approach
ing in Hawaii If annexation were not
accomplished, and therefore it was sup
pusable that in his mind it was neces
sary to hurry up with the diabolical job.
What occult power the Senator has I
know not, but he saw anything but
revolution some months ago when he
was there. The situation may have
changed materially since then, but if
so we have heard nothing of it on the
Pacific slope. What we shall lose by
letting the Hawaiian people aljrend to
their own affairs is not apparent.
Again, this prominent Democrat an
nounced on the occasion when he
honored us with his presence and opin
ions as one reason for annexing the
Sandwich group that when he was in
Honolulu he saw no great opposition
to annexation shown by the natives.
That is a very strong argument on
his chosen side of the case clearly
enough! I have no desire to lampoon
this distinguished gentleman, but if he
will hie him to Patagonia he will find
no great opposition on the part of the
Patagonians to become free and en
lightened American citizens. Let us
proceed, then, with all due celerity to
annex Patagonia, and in heaven's
name let us fortify it too. We shall
surely have to fortify the Hawaiian
Islands if we are to make them part
of American territory.
Driven by ridicule and fair argument
from the position which it has main
tained as to the commercial and stra-
tegic value of these islands to us, the
Chronicle has fallen back on the salu
brity of the climate as a reason for an
nexation. At great expense, doubtless,
it has added to Its staff an astronomer
and a meteorologist for the purpose of
teaching the public that heat is felt
in direct proportion, the world over, to
the height of the mercury in the tube
of a thermometer; that trade winds
are unvarying, and that the sun's
erliptic has recently been changed for
the benefit of annexat.ionists only. The
meteorologist has probably never been
outside of San Francisco or he would
know that radiation and humidity
have as much to do with oppressive
heat as has the amount of heat emit
ted by the sun's rays. To illustrate:
I have found the heat much harder to
bear in New York with the thermome
ter at 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the
shade than I have in Calcutta when
the temperature was 100 or over. This
scientist would find also, had he the
necessary experience, that trade winds
do fail, and those of the North Pacific
Ocean are least of all to be relied on.
But the statement by the astronomer
that the sun is never vertical in Ha
waii, already referred to I believe edi
torially, is most comical of all. Burn
ham and Barnard have vowed that
places between a line drawn 23 degrees
and 28 minutes parallel to and north of
the equatorial line and a line drawn in
like manner at a similar distance south
of it have the sun in the zenith twice
in his yearly course. But, then, Pro
fessors Burnham and Barnard may
have been wrong, and they were not
interested in annexation anyway!
So how could they know? Sensible ar
guments on the annexation side truly
grow apace.
The "tempest in a teapot" in the Ori
ent seems to be over. It has. as usual,
produced some remarkable cablegrams
from foreign correspondents of tlie
CreelmM type. (By the by, what has
become of this interviewer of Kings,
Princes, Sultans and Popes?) A few
days ago we were seriously told that
England had "ordered out the naval
reserve on the China station." That
would bt a fighting force of about ten
men â at most twenty. The English
naval reserve is Tiot fashioned after
our plan. It is composed of sailors
serving at sea regularly, who are
drilled on board a Government vessel
or at a shore battery a specific num
ber of days in each year. It is seldom
that any ship has among her crew
more than two men of this reserve,
and I doubt much if there are forty to
be found in all the British shipping in
this port.
Now that the trouble over the Chi
nese territory Is apparently at an end
lot us see what probably caused all the
fuss. It was something like this: Ger
many applied to China for the privilege
of a coaling station on the Chinese sea
board. The request was refused. It
was again urged and again refused,
and then pressure was brought to bear.
Most of the other great powers have
facilities in the Orient that Germany
did not possess, and she had a perfect
right to ask the courtesy. It is more
than probable, too, that she offered to
lease the land she wanted at the begin
ning of the negotiations. That the Chi
nese were alarmed, at the landing of
German marines is easily credible, their
late experience with Japan being still
fresh in memory. Fearing further dis
aster she gave way. The idea of John
Bull negotiating an 580.000.000 loan for
China was proof enough that there was
to be no dividing up of Chinese terri
tory, and that peace was well assured.
Mr. Bull is a pretty astute and a very
careful financier.

DESERVES CREDIT FOR THE DEPARTURE.

"It is by dosipn, and after mature deliberation, that The Call

The Call of thia morning, and it deserves credit for its departure from

fame, has, it is stated, got his flying
machine â on which he has been at
work for years â so nearly perfected
that he proposes to place stock in his
aerial navigation company on the mar
ket at once. His latest olaim is that he
has overcome gravitation by what he
calls "sympathetic outreach." The term
is not explicit to the ordinary mind, but
Don John W. Keely is no ordinary
man: he is a genius, as the New York
Tribune pointed out in a very humor
ous editorial many years ago. At that
time it was the wiggle motion of the
gilder fluke for his motor that this in
ventor depended on for success, which
is not much more understandable than
is the sympathetic outreach. Some of
the Tribunes editorial is well worth
quoting, for it may guide investors
when Dr. Keely's prospectus reaches
this coast. Among other things it said:
"When Dr. Keely is called upon by
some doubting stockholder to explain
the workings of the motor he is all
smiles, and conducting the victim into
the presence of the machine he says:
'You see, my friend, the way we op
erate the motor is this: Taking hold of
the lever we pull it toward us. ' This
causes the small flip-flap to be with
drawn, allowing the flibber-snatcher to
fall into its place on the rai rod. As
soon as this happens it acts directly on
the slam-bang, causing it to make a
half revolution and start the get-up
and-get motion of the fiunker-flopper
which in turn communicates its energy
to the wapper-chock. After these things
have run for about five minutes they
cause the jig- jag valve to turn and the
asthmatic gas to flow through the pipe
to the cylinder and gives the wiggle
motion to the gilder-fluke. That's the
point we are striving afterâ the wiggle
motion of the gilder-fluke. "Why, my
dear sir, without the wiggle-motion of
the gilder-fluke you wouldn't think of
putting your money into the motor.
But with it, sir, we are â eh? another
share? All right, come into the office
and I'll have it made out for you inside
of a minute."
Mr. Keely's mental endowments seem
to run in particular lines. He appears
to have no mechanical ingenuity, his
strong point being his ability as a col
lector. He has one of the largest and
best arranged collections of other peo
ple's money to be found in the United
States. Having during a fit of tempo
rary insanity constructed a machinrr
that no power on earth can start he
now sits down calmly and allows this
same mechanical nightmare to make
his living for him. This is genius. The
man who can create a company stocK
in which Is placed among the holder's
liabilities when he fails, and then con
tinues to sell this stock every day, is
doing something that ordinary men of
talent cannot do. He has riÃen above
them. This is John W. Keely. He toils
not, neither does he spin; but he has
got a hysterical collection of crooked
pipes and lop-sided wheels tied up in
his back room that extract the reluc
tant dollar from the pocket of avarice
without fail.
And there is little doubt but that his
flying machine with its '"sympathetic
outreach" will continue the good work
of keeping Professor Keely in royal
style â the work so ably begun by the
wiggle-motion of the gilder-fluke.

remarkable thing to my mind about the
natives of those islands tying along the

vers and the length of time they can
stay under water.
"In the lagoona of these coral atolls,
where the pearl fisheries are carried on,
it is no uncommon sight to see the whole
villageâ men, women and childrenâ in the
water at one time, diving for the prec
ious shell.
"The average depth to which the full
grown diver descends is from fifteen to
twenty fathoms, though a plunge of
twenty-seven or twonty-nine fathoms is
an occurrence so common as to excite no
comment. The time spent under the
water is from three to five minutes.
"The greatest dive I ever heard of was
made by a prisoner from the Marquesas,
who went down thirty-six fathoms t to res
cue a native who had become exhausted
and unable to get up to the surface. He
succeeded in the attempt and was re

.'"There'll be nothing sensational.
E>orrt expect it. There'll be no sighs
â -a-nd tears and groans.- It'll not be a
ii of noise, but of hearts; of faith
ye," said Major Hilton who
.'conducted his first revival meeting at
the Howard Presbyterian Church, cor
i.er Oak and Baker, last night.
The evangelist, the lirst forty-three
years of whose life were spent in a pro
fession distinctly unclerieal, is a man
01' middle height, with square shoulders
and a well-set head from which the
brown-gray, thick, curly hair isfastdis
ring. His chin is square and his
mouth is firm, but the expression of his
eyes is kindly. The style of Major ilii
exhortation is dramatic and ef
fective, lie uses homely expressions
and doesn't hold fast to rules of syn
tax, but his voice is excellent, strong
and sympathetic and capable of modu
lations that sway his listeners.
â -Mebbe some of our friends who are
here to-night." he said in the informal,
easy way that is the perfection of plat
form manners, "mebbe they can't Bing,
..or they would. Now, I can't sing, but
'.I'll try to sing a little, and those of us
who can't sing that much might just
'â¢.â¢try to make their mouth go as if they

â¢-jsire to praise Him in your hearts. He'li

"There are n< - of sin in divine

Though his "conception of hell is vague,

Then came the officers after them. Oh,
how easy: Saw their tracks in the
sik.w, of course**â the major bent over
and thrust his hands behind him.
'â¢They were taken. Oh, how simple!
F.e sure your sin will find you out. Be
sure of it!" he exclaimed.
It was as a minister of vengeance
that Major Hilton appeared then, as
he brought his fist down wijh a re
sounding clap upon the desk before
him. Then he went on to tell how the
criminals suffered; first physically
when they endured amputation of their
frozen limbs, and Inter when they wert
hanged for their crimes."
"The wages of sin is death." he re
peated. "Death all along the line. You
can't wipe out sin. Good resolutions
will not do it. Prayer will not do it.
The punishment for sin is death,
death!" the evangelist cried, "and yet"
â his strong, clear voice softened and
fellâ "one thing will do it. Belief in
God will do it. Though the penalty for
em be death, the rift of God is eternal
life!"
There is something in Major Hilton's
voice which lends freshness to phi
grown meaningless, almost. There is
a vitality in his manner and a sin
cerity in his way of putting things that
had its effect with the few hundred ;
people Bitting before him. Hia gestures i
are free and frequent. He moves about ,
the little platform easily and naturally,
and when occasion requires it. he acts
the various roles he describes to his
listeners. To offset the Beverity of the)
first part of his talk, he told of a pris
oner con* mned by a judge who had
been his old college friend. Dramatic
ally, he described the scene of convic
tion and sentence.
'â¢The full extent of the lav, he mur
mured in a trembling voice. "Think
:of if The full extent of the law!"
But he. whose duty it was as a judge
to sentence the criminal, as a friend
paid the debi which represented the ,
prisoners' theft, and
'And just so did God give his only
begotten Son."
The conclusion was spoken so sim
ply that the familiar words acquired ;
a new meaning. And then the evange- ;
list dropping Into the colloquial tone ]
with whi< h he varies his discourse, con
tinued: .. . ,
"Though He may sentence to the full
extent of the law. He knows you, lie
remembere you. He's never had his
eves off you."
'The evening was nearly spent before
Major Hilton made any appeal to his ;
audience.
"I want." he said, "to ask a favor.
I plead for it. I beg for it. in a loving
way In the very spirit of love. o. I
want the privilege of prayine for youâ
you Individually, who do not believe as
I do. Will you give it? Will you? It
will cost you an .(Tort, but if you will,
will you Just rise to your feet and then
sit down again?
"Will you?
â¢oh. be strong, be courageous."
Til wait a moment"
There was a pause. The place was
absolutely BtUl. Then the evangelist
spoke again.
"If youTI just raise a hand. Just
lift your hand. Tfs not curiosity on
my part. I want God to see the mo
tive behind the raised hand. If you
have the desire to for faith let God see
it. o. be strong:'."
"Not one?" he said, after another
pause. "Not one?"
A timid hand went up. It was the
hrind of a woman. The evangelist's
face beamed.
He interrupted the choir later, after
thr> soft contralto and soprano had fin
ished the first verse. Baying "Softer,
softer," and then at the end he made
his second appeal
"Mebbe som.p are perplexed here to
night." he said. "Mebbe some are wav
ering, some are disappointed, pome are
suffering. Now. while all heads are
bent in prayer, will those who wish to
etter, who desire stronger faith In
God. rise. Just risÂ» and sit again."
And this time, while the congregation
remained with lowered eyes, a woman
rose, sierhed and fell back into a sent.
nAnd then a man rose and then a wor-
an and another and another. And
presently there were many who gave
this mute tet=tim</nial to the preacher's
eloquence. To each he made a motion
that was quiet, graceful and intensely
sympathetic.
"Come home, ye who are weary-
Jesus is calling." Bang the choir, and
during thoir singing there was the si
lent raising and lowering of a hand;
the momentary rise and reseating of
â one who had been moved to make a
declaration of awakened desire for re
ligion.
And that was all there was to this
strange revival meeting: nothing sen
sational, as Major Hilton had 6aid.

The "hoodoo" is gone from the Bush
street Theater judging from the at
tendance at the German Hebrew opera
there last night. "S. EL O." sign was
out early in the evening and even the
boxes were filled.
The opera is the story of Alexandre,
the Crown Prince of Jerusalem, who

maiden with whom he fell desperate
ly In love. The young woman is a
Princess, being under the care of an
old citizen by the name of Menachem,
but the story of her parentage is kept
from her.
The old peasant refuses to give his
consent to their marriage unless he
goes away for three months and at the
end of that time if he still loves the
girl he may claim her for his brid>-.
The Prince goea away, but the obsta
cle now comes in the way of his
mother who refuses to sanction th"
marriage, because Naomi, the girl, is of
plebeian birth. When the true story
of Naomi's birth is known the ob

reigns.
The characters are all well sustained,

FAILED TO
END HIS LIFE
J. H. Glassman, "While De
spondent, Turned on
the Gas.
He Was Soon Discovered and
Locked Up at the City
Prison.
Friends Asked for His Release, but
Ball Was Not Ac
cepted.
J. A. Glassman. son of Jamb Glass
man, a well-known wholesale and re
tail cigar merchant, is booked at the
City Prison on a charge of drunken
and opposite his name Is marked
"no bail." Twice last evening he at
tempted to take his own life, being
despondent from excessive use of alco
holic stimulants.
According to the story told by the ar
resting officers. Snowball and Wilson,
as well as the proprietors of the places
In whirh Glassman attempted to end
his life, the unfortunate man has been
on a "spree" for five or six weeks past.
He had formerly been employed as a
solicitor by the Emporium renovatory.
109 Eddy street, but is at the present
time unable to procure employment.
I ming despondent he started
drinking heavily, and was soon on the
verge of delirium tremens. Last even-
Ing he walked into a lodging-house,
under the management of John M.
Evans, 116 Eddy street, and. opening a
door of a room on the top floor, he
turned on the gas jet and laid down on
the bed to die.
The odor of the escaping poison was
soon detected, and when the door of
the room was again opened Glassman
was on the bed, apparently in a deep
slumber. He was quickly carried out
of the room and in a few minutes or
dered from the house. He left and
walked up Eddy street and entered
room 10 of 120 A Eddy street in a lodg
ing-house run by Miss Crawford.
Evans notified th^ officers In the
neighborhood of the attempted sui
cide, and they followed the man into
the building, where it was discovered
that he had again turned on the gas as
before. He was carried into the street
and the patrol-wagon was called. Hav
inir recovered sufficiently from the ef
fects of the gas he had breathed he was
not taken to the hospital, but charged
at the City Prison.
On Friday last he applied for a room
In the Crawford lodging-house, and has
since been stopping there. It was no
ticed that he was drinking heavily, but
his friends were not of the Impression
that he was so despondent as to at
tempt to kill himself. Accordingly no
watch was kept on him, and the smell
of the escaping gan alone saved him
from certain death.
His case is a pitiful example of des
pondency and loss of hope induced by
ii'iuor upon a young man Who vrai
giftad with early opportunities not of
ten tnei with. He, in partnership with
J. Browsweiger. opened the business of
dyeing and cleaning, whioh Is now
known as the Emporium renovatory.
For a while the business prospered,
but Classman's partner tired of the un
dertaking and, after getting married,
left the State. Tho business was iol'l
to the pit-.-. -nt owners, and c;iassmt>n
prarted as a solicitor for lh>i linn. Con*
Btderable trust was placed in him by
his employers, but soon drink had the

After losing his posttion h.? went from
bad to v.nr!<c, and nearly ended in â 
disgraceful death last evening. H;s

GOT EXPERIENCE
BUT NO GOLD
Return of Ex-Police Ser
geant Johns From
Peru.
He Says That Some Tales Tpld
About the Mines Are
Untrue.
Many People Have Been Lvired There
In the False Hope of Find
ing Gold.
Ex-Police Sergeant Josiah Johns, who
went to Peru at the head of a prospect
ing party and who was reported to
have died there, arrived here Friday
on the steamer City of Sydney. HiÃ
expectation of acquiring a fortune in
the mines was not realized. He says
that some stories told of the richness of
the gold fields of Peru ai untrue and
he advises all those contemplating a
trip to that country to remain at
home.
"When I read the Eastern accounts
of the rich finds being made in Peru,"
said Johns yesterday, "I determined
to try my fortune. In company with E.
B. Hagans, J. H. Livermore, F. A. Bo
linger, John P. Stalford. R. Boone, Geo.
Glennie and J. C. Dawson I left here
on March 20th last. We went to Pan
ama on the City of Sydney and from
there on a sailing vessel to Mollendo.
From Mollendo we truveled by rail to
Arequipa and there our troubles com
menced. The railroad system of Peru
is entirely different from what we have
IB America. The trains only run In
the day time, and then at a snail-like
rate of speed. Our first stopping j
place was at Juliaco and there we had j
the good fortune of becoming ac
quainted with Patrick Hawley, an
American, who is a division superin- |
tendent of the line, lie offered us j
every assistance in reaching Tirapata, j
where the [nca Mining Company has
a large warehouse, we were com
pelled to remain at Tirapata sixteen
dayi before we could get mules and
Hamas to carry us and our provisions
over the mountains. During the time
Â«re were In Tirapata we occupied a
box car kindly furnished us by Haw
ley. The pack animals we secured aft
er considerable negotiating from J.
Zamora, a rich Peruvian, who lives
about seventeen miles from Tirapata.
When we reached the summit of the
mountain it was mowing heavily and
you can imagine how comfortable we
felt in a tent, at an altitude of 16,
600 feet. The following day we started
down the Atlantic side of the Cordil
lera mountains and after a rough
j tramp <>f over twenty miles we reached
! Limbani, where the Inca Mining Corn
has another storehouse. The In
: dians who accompanied us from Tira
pata refused to go any further with
our party and we were compelled to
look about for guides and pack
animals. We spent over two weeks in
j getting them and there our party sep
; arated. Stalford, Boone, Glennie and
| Dawson set out for the Sandia dis
! trict, while myself and the other three
: started for the mines. The other party
; met with poor luck in the Sandia dis
j tri<t and after prospecting for over a
' month without result started back for
j San Francisco. They arrived here sev
i eral months ago. bur party reached
the Inca Mining Company's property
about the middle of June and soon
found that we had toiled and labored
over almost impassuble mountains in
vain. I would not attempt to describe
the perils or hardships of the trip. We
were nicely treated by the people at
the mine and they assisted us in every
way. A small creek runs past the mine
! and we negotiated with the mine-own
! ers for the privilege of prospecting
i along the banks. Hagans and myself
formed a partnership and worked to
i gether. I secured a place in the quartz
: mill of the mine and in addition to
boarding myself was able to engage
four Indians to assiat Hagans with his
work on the creek banks. Hagans
found 'color,' but that was all. After
a month spent in prospecting he ar
rived at the conclusion that there was
nothing along the creek. We then fell
in with a Peruvian who said that he
know of a small river about forty miles
from the mine which was rich in gold.
Hagans went with him, while I re
mained at the quartz mill. Three
weeks later Hagans and the Peruvian
came back. They had failed to find
the river or the gold. Livermore be
came tired of life in Peru about that
time and started home. Hagans and
myself remained at the mine until No
vember and then concluded Aat we

had all the experience we wanted. The
whole country has been prospected and
gone over hundreds of years ago and
I do not believe that there are undis
covered mines or claims there. On
every side you find places where some
one has been prospecting or mining."
Johns says that there is nothing in
either Peru or Bolivia for a poor man
who goes to either country expecting
to locate a mine and become a Monte
Cristo in a few years.
"The articles published In the East
as to the gold fields," said he, in
conclusion, '"have been the cause of
misleading many people. Hundreds of
others like myself have gone there full
of expectations only to return badly
disappointed. Provisions of all kinds
are high and then what you get is not
of the beet quality. It is no place for
a poor man. My advice to all who
contemplate going there in search of
gold is to keep away from the coun
try. I am talking from a rough expe
rience and I would not want to see my
worst enemy lured there in the hope
of finding a Klondike. The climate is
severe and It takes a particularly
strong man to stand it. All the mining
that Is going on is at points of high
altitude and a man whose lungs are
not ns strong as leather has no busi
ness there."

FAILED TO
RETURN TO
HER HOME
Middle-Aged Woman
Mysteriously Dis
appears.
Went to Visit Her Sister's
Grave m Calvary
Cemetery.
Mrs. Prunty, 19 Sumner Street
Requests the Police to Find
Her Daughter.
SHE MAY BE DERANGED.
Her Pooket Handkerchief Found
on Her Relative's Tomb
stone.
"With tears streaming down her
cheeks an old woman named Mrs.
Prunty, Jiving at 19 Sumner street, vis
ited police headquarters last night and
invoked the aid of Chief Lees in finding
her daughter Katie.
The latter is 34 years of age. She
left her home yesterday morning to
visit the grave of her sister in Calvary
cemetery, after promising to return at
noon. As she had not returned up to 8
o'clock last night her mother became
alarmed and notified the police. She
fears that some accident had befallen
her daughter.
Several months ago a younger sister
of the missing woman was knocked
down by a Mission street car and al
most instantly killed. Her tragic death
preyed upon her sister to such an ex
tent that it was feared that she would
lose her mind.
After the unfortunate woman's re
mains were buried Katie almost daily
visited her grave, and remained for
several hours at a time. On returning
home it was noticed that her eyes were
red and swollen from weeping. She be
came sullen and morose and scarcely
spoke to her mother. Before going to
the cemetery yesterday the unfortunate
woman remarked to a friend that life
had no charms for her and that she in
tended to do away with herself.
. Mrs. Prunty is inclined to believe
that her daughter has either met with
.an accident or has committed suicide.
"Since her sister was killed," she
tearfully remarked, "she has not been
the same woman. Every morning she
would visit her grave and remain for
Beveral hours. I feared that her mind
was becoming unbalanced, and for
bade her to continue her visits to the
cemetery. Despite my opposition she
daily went to. her sister's grave and
placed a bunch of flowers on it. She
would kneel at the foot of the grave
and pray until she became exhausted.
Before leaving home yesterday morn
ing she bought a bouquet of flowers
and started for the cemetery. I en
deavored to dissuade her from going,
but she would not listen to me. I am
convinced that something has hap
pened hpr."
Last night a police officer was sent
to the cemetery in the hope that he
might find the woman. He visited the
grave of her sister, but with the ex
ception of a pocket handkerchief,
which she had dropped, he failed to
get a trace of her.
BEATING THE
SLOT MACHINES
Clever Work of a Gang of
Eastern Crooks Now in
This City.
Cigar and Saloon Men Are Heavy-
Losersâ A Wire Does the
Business.
A new scheme to beat the nlckel-in
the-lot machines, that has brought woe
and financial loss to a large number of
saloon men and cigar-dealers, has been
called to the attention of the police.
The bunko men who have worked it
successfully are three in number, and
their method is systematic.
One of them visits a cigar-store and
plays the machine.
Willie he is dropping the nickels the
others come along and begin shaking
dice at the other end of the counter
from the machine, keeping the pro
prietor or attendant's attention there
as much as possible. The man at the
machine has a wire, with one end
twisted into a hook, up his sleeve, and
when a portion of a royal flush shows
up quickly and deftly works the wire
Into the slot, turns the reel on which
the cards are fastened and suddenly
calls a royal flush.
It is there sure enough, and the card
over the machine indicates that the
proprietor is out 100 cigars. Some pay
even 150 cigars, and "bit" cigars at
thaft.
It is customary when a customer gets
a "royal" to offer him $5 to $7 50 for his
winning, and the schemers who work
the wire. trick generally manage to
negotiate their cigars for at least $5.
In saloons they do not get so much,
but it has been ascertained that the
three men average from $30 to $40 per
day. Oakland and Alameda have been
worked by the trio, and a large number
of cigar and saloon men were losers.
A well-known cigar man on Market
street caught the wire-worker at his
tricks a few days ago and sent for a
policeman, but the trio decamped be
fore the officer arrived. Two of the
bunko men are smooth shaven and
about 5 feet 8 inches in height, while
the third, the man who manipulates the
wire, is shorter, and wears a dark,
closely cropped beard.- All are well
dressed and are evidently adepts at
crooked work.
The police believe them to be a gang
of Eastern crooks who are making a
tour of the coast.

CHIQUITO A DRAWING-CARD.
Thousands Visit the Huroan Atom.
Small Crowds Gather at the
Park, and Cliff:
Chiquita, said to be the smallest liv
ing adult, was visited by several thou
sand people at the Chutes yesterday.
The park and Cliff House were prac
tically deserted, perhaps owing to the
lowering clouds and the breath of win
ter that chilled to the very marrow. In
consequence wherever a roof and shel
tering walls could be found to protect
those in search of diversion after a
week of toll the crowds congregated.
Over seven thousand people visited the
Chutes during the day. and as two
performances were given by "The little
one" in the pavilion a majority of the
visitors witnessed her performance.
Chiquita is a very atom of human
flesh. She has a chubby face and fig
ure, which, accompanied by a person
ality as cute as her stature, made her
many friends. During the performance
she rendered several songs, some in
Spanish and others in English. Her
voice is in perfect keeping with her
size, and called forth time and again
the applause of the audience.
The programme at the park was an
unusually good one, but the chill In
the air marred the enjoyment of the
lovers of harmony who gathered to
gether near the music-stand. No acci
dents occurred to worry the police and
hospital surgeons and they were con
tented.
A majority of the people who went
to the Cliff House enjoyed the dance in
the Ocean Beach Pavilion. Walking
on the beach was rendered very un
comfortable by the wind and spray
that leaped from the crests of the
breakers, and owing to this the pleas
ure-seekers returned to their homes
much earlier than usual.
fHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 1898.
THE SHOT THAT
HIT GARDINER
Speculation as to "Which
of the Two Men
Fired It
Circumstances Show That Stroh
Could Hardly Have
Done It.
Questions Raiser! by the Finding of
the Bullet in Gardiner's
Spine.
The finding of the bullet fired Into
the body of Gardiner on the night of
December 24 has led to the conclusion
that perhaps the leaden pellet came
from a friendly revolver instead of
from that of the midnight marauder.
Dr. Jones, by whose efforts the bul
let was located, declares that it enter
ed Gardiner's right shoulder from an
angle of 30 degrees. This is the start
ing point in the search for where It
came frona.
When he was shot Gardiner was
standing in the doorway of the rear
room erf his residence, at 1135 Geary
street, on the south side. The door in
which he was standing faces to the
cast and opens out on a little porch
scarcely five feet square, which is at
the top of the back stairway leading
from the back yard, three stories be
low. Directly across the little porch
from the dour spring two posts to the
roof, one on each side of the center
line of the doorway, and climbing up
the one which was at Gardiner's l^ft
hand as he looked out. was Stroh, the
pursued burglar. Four feet beyond
the posts is the side of the adjoining
house east of the Gardiner residence,
and perhaps ten feet farther to the
rear of the building is a brick chim
ney about three feet high.
When Gardiner looked out he had
the screen door opening on the porch
not quite half way open. The burglar
was almost directly In front of him and
on the roof of the adjoining house, and
nearly as far to the rear as th<: brick
chimney was Murphy, the patrol driv
er, booking for Stroh. There was a
flash and a report, and Gardiner fell
backwards into the room with a bullet
in his right shoulder. Almost in the
center of the door and at a height of
five feet four inches from the floor, a
hole in the screen marks where the bul
let went through. The wires are cut
clean at the top of the hole and are
crushed at the bottom, leading tÂ» the
certainty that the bullet came from
above. They are also turned to
the left on the left side of
the hole looking outward, showing that
tfte bullet came from a point at Gardi
ner's right. As he held the latch Gard
iner"s shoulder was below and to the
left of the hole.
Stroh, as he came down the post,
was facing toward Geary street, or to
the north, and to use his right hand to
fire a shot he would have had to reach
around the pole. Had he done so he
could not have fired in such a manner
as to bend the wires of the door to the
right.
Both the burglar and the patrol driv
er were at about the same angle from
the bullet hole, for while at different
distances they were at different heights
and so were about in the same plane.
Detective Dillon and Murphy were on
the roof of the house adjoining Gardi
ner's when Dillon heard some one cry
ing, "Here he Is." Dillon immediate
ly started down the ladder at the rear
of the house he was on, and Murphy
sprang to the sid* of the house and
looked over on to the little porch out
side of Gardiner's back door. He flash
ed the light from his wagon Lamp dawn
Into the space between the buildings
and spied the man he was after trying
to climb the post to get on the roof.
He Bays he fired over his head to scare
him, and the man- dropped to the little
porek
Mv phy heard no shot but his own;
Dillon heard but one shot; Gardiner
heard but one shot, and his wife, who
stood right behind him as he fell, heard
only one shot. Murphy says he fired
over Stroll's head, but he does not
know in which direction his pistol was
pointed, and a careful examination of
the houses in any of the directions in
which he could have shot failed to
find any other bullet rrtark besides the
one in the screen door. Then, too,
there are no powder marks on the ten
nis-flannel night gown which Gardi
ner wqje, a circumstance to be expect
ed when a revolver is as close as six
feet. Murphy was fourteen feet away.
Stroh had no pistol on him when he
was caught. It was said he could have
thrown it down into the sand in the
yard in the rear of Gardiner's house
and one of his partners could have tak
en it away, but no one was seen in the
yard, and It would have been hard to
find the pistol without the aid of a
light.
The bullet extracted from Gardiner's
body was fired from a .38 caliber re
volver and from a "short" cartridge.
The revolver carried by Murphy was
loaned to him by Detective Dillon just
before he went on the roof. It was a
.38 caliber Smith & Wesson, and uses
a "short" cartridge.
Gardiner himself sent for Captain
Lees a few days ago, and told him he
thought the bullet had not been fired
by Stroh. He said he did not have any
sympathy for Stroh. but he dfd not
want to be the means of making his
punishment unjustly hard; In conse
quence he altered that part of his
statement which accused Stroh of
shooting him, but he blamed no one
else.

WARDEN MOGAN`S REPORT.
Vigilance Y\as Made Deer and Pro-
hibited pi S h Scarce in
This Market.
Fish and Game Warden Joseph Mo
gan is preparing an exhaustive report
to the Board of Supervisors regarding
his work during the last three months.
Within that period he has visited the
fish and poultry markets during the
daylight as well as the night hours and
has at all times found the stalls free
from contraband fish and meats.
"Warden Mogan's efforts were direct
ed particularly toward venison, reports
having reached him that deer were be
rng killed in northern cities out of sea*
son and shipped to San Francisco.
During the past few we-'ks he has vis
ited a number of Chinese fish camps
to ascertain whether the laws regard
ing nets were being disregarded.
Mr. Mogan does not expect to be able
to make any arrests for violations of
the gar%e laws until after March 1,
when the close season for the majority
of game birds begins.

FINDING OF THE MESSIAH
Rev. Father M- Wyman Talks 015
the Subject at St. Mary's
Church.
The Reverend H. Wyman, pastor of
St. Mary's Church, delivered an elo
quent sermon last evening on the sub
ject of "The Finding of the Messiah."
"It Is a significant fact," said the
preacher, "that the first and rep
resentative men among the Gentiles,
who were called by the visible sign of
a miraculous star, ana an inspiration
of the holy ghost to the worship of the
true God. are called 'wise men.' "
With this as his initial chapter in the
unraveling of the subject of the ad
vent of the Messiah, Father Wyman
proceeded to explain the miracle of the
star of Bethlehem and the consequent
inspiration to the Wise men of the
East, their stubborn faith in the new
born Christ and their abhorrence of
the wicked ruler and chtef men of Je
rusalem.
He concluded with the remark that
those who find the Messiah to-day In
stead of being scandalized by His pov
erty and self-denial, are led by His ex
ample more fervently to follow him.

INDIFFERENT
Denies That He Is at War
With the Police
Judges.
They Can Take From the De
partment the Assignment
of Cases.
Tha Proposal to Equally Divide the
Cases Is Entirely Wrong and
Will Not Work.
Chief Lees is not at all disturbed at
tho proposed action of the Police
Judcos to take the assignment
of cases out of the control of the de
partment. He was not aware of the
sed change till he read of it In
The Call yesterday afternoon, and the
Statement attributed to him in the
Examiner that he would insist upon
the existing order of things being con
tinued was a surprise to him, as he
r.-.-v er made it.
"It Is a matter of indifference to me,"
said the Chief yesterday afternoon,
whether the assignments are made by
the Police Court clerks or by Sergeant
McDonald. The sergeant has been for
years the properly constituted officer
:'â â¢: performing that duty, and he has
done it by rotation. I understand
Judge Low has been complaining be
cause the Hoff case was not assigned
to his court. As I understand the mat
ter, the case was assigned to his court
.)i the regular rotation, but before the
papers were ready. The complaining
â¢it ness, the murdered woman's
brother-in-law, swore to the complaint
in Judge Joachimsen's court, and, of
course, the case came before him.
"The proposition to equally divide
the cases anmng the four courts,
whether the arrests are made by war
rant or otherwise, is in my opinion,
wrong 1 . When a complaint is sworn to
in a court, that gives the court juris
diction in the case. As a mater of fact,
it is part of the procedings in the case,
and the case cannot be assigned to
another court unless with the consent
of the defendant, and then only for
probable cause. It is often the case
that a man will swear to a complaint
in a certain court because he prefers
that the Judge of that court shall try
his case; but the action of the Judges
would lake from him that right. In
my humble opinion, the Police Judges
cannot give effect to that part of their
suggestions."
The suggestion not to accept any
3 between midnight and 9 o'clock
in the morning is open to objection. It
i= pointed out that a reputable citizen
. be arrested after midnight on
some trumped-up charge, and it would
entail hardship and indignity upon him
to compel him to remain in the City
Prison for several hours when he could
be released on giving satisfactory
bonds.
The suggestions will be finally con
sidered at a meeting of the Judges this
afternoon, and at the same time they
may consider a suggestion to <lo away
with th â¢ slipshod practice of discharg
ing prisoners. When a case is dis
missed in court the defendant walks
out of court, and the prison-keeper has
t > depend upon the list handed to him
by the bailiff of the court after the
court has adjourned as to whether a
prisoner has been discharged. In East
ern, cities all the prisoners are taken
back to the prison from the court, and
In the event of any of them having
been discharged they are not released
from prison until a written order of
discharge is received by the prison
keeper from the Judge. It is an evil
that can easily be remedied.
A BIG AUSTRIAN
STEAM COLLIER
One More Vessel Will Ply
Between This Port and
Nanaimo.
The CRmnnehe Goes to More Islnnd
Accident to the Sloop-Yacht
Annie.
John Rosenfeld.s Sons have secured
another big collier to run between this
port and Nanaimo. It is the Austrian
steel screw steamer Burma, which ar
rived here shortly after midnight yes
terday -with a cargo of coal. She is
now discharging at Long Wharf, Oak
land.
According to Lloyd the steamer is
Classed as 100 Al. Sho was built by
W. Gray & Co. (limited), at West

The training-ship Camanehe was
towed up to Mare Island at 7:30 a. m.
yesterday by the tug Governor Mark
hani. The old monitor also used her
swn steam. On board were a few
r (embers of the First Division of the
Naval Battalion and almost all of the
Second, Captain Turner was in charge.
The tug returned with the party later
in the day, but the monitor will trans
fer her coal to the Marlon, which will
steam down and moor in the stream as
slop, as Governor Budd is able to at
tend.
Next Tuesday the United States
steamer Alert will leave for Central
America on a surveying expedition.
She has on a deck load of lumber to

15 degrees to 5 degrees south, when a
â¢ succession of easterly and northwest
erly gales were met.
The sloop-yacht Annie, Commander
Philip Caduc, while sailing up the bay
â yesterday afternoon, with a westerly
wind, was suddenly struck aback off
Powell-street wharf and drifted across
the bow of the schooner Neptune. The
only damage sustained was to the
mainsail of the yacht, which was pplit
in two.
Through no fault of her builders, the
gasoline launch constructed for Kit

merchant, has again been in trouble.
Christmas night the pile to which she

CHARLES FAIR FIGURES
IN A BARROOM BRAWL
Picks a Quarrel With Fred Hallen. the Actor
and Is Sent Sprawling by a
Stinging Blow.
NEW York, Jan. 9.â A morning pa
per prints the story of ;t brmiwl in the
barroom of the Imperial Hotel ypster
day afternoon, in which Charles L.
Fair of San Francisco and Fred Hal
lea ;md Charlie Ross, vaudeville actors,
were involved. The latter were en
gaged in conversation with Peter Dai
ley and John T. Kelly when Fair en
tered the place and broke into the con
versation, saying to Ross: "Well, who
are you? You are no Booth." Ross
did not explain who he was, but he
did give his opinion .if Fair and his
discourtesy. Fair wandered away,
but soon returned and s.Tid to Hallen:
'What's the matter with him?" nod
ding toward Ross.
"You intruded, and I suppose he is
offended," answered Hallen, pacifically.
"Suppose I apologise." returned Fair.
"Go get me some paper and I'll write
an apology."
"Get messenger boy, quick, ' said
Hallen, shortly.
"Ain't you big enough for a messen
ger?" was Fair's reply.
Already nettled at Fair's intrusion
upon the party and upon the silent re
ception of the oral scourging cf Ross,
Hallen answered the Insulting speech
with a Mow. A table, a chair, a silk
hat and a millionaire all went down
together. The attendants hastily re
moved Fair from the room.
MARKETS AGAIN
MEET DEFEAT
"Napoleon" Fagin's Collection
Succumbs to the Will
& Fincks.
The Game Repleta With Errors and
Heavy Stick Workâ Other
Games.
"Napoleon" Fagin's colts seemed to
have lost their grip. Yesterday they
allowed the Will & Fincks to take their
scalps, and if this continues Fagin will
have to instill more ginger into his ag
gregation. Iberg was given a vacation
in another portion of the lot and Bodie
tried his hand at twirling. He only
tried, however, as the Will & Fincks
batted him in all directions, and he had
to give way to Henry Krug. Krug has
always possessed a wing and he show
ed up to good advantage. Six strike
outs in four innings is not a bad repu
tation for any pitcher to establish.
Fitzpatrick pitched a steady game up
to the eighth, when Knell, wishing to
have more than a. speaking part in the
game, finished for his side. Both men
did good work. The game was full of
batting. and errors, and the small-sized
crowd got enough excitement out of the
game to keep them w.arm. H. Krug
lost five balls over the fence in succes
sion, making the heart of Manager Mc-
Noill sad.

day by a score of 9 to 1. As the game
was to decide the department cham
pionship a great deal of Interest was
taken in the match, many wagers be
ing laid upon its outcome.
Troop I had its best men in the field
and felt confident of winning. Com
pany D was not far behind In material,
and they made every effort to uphold
the honor of the walking contingent.
Both teams put up excellent ball, the
sharp fielding and clever stick work
winning the applause of a large crowd
of onlookers. In winning yesterday
Company D added more laurels to their
branch of the service. Having won the
trophy in the annual department ath

Be Sure Your Sir) Will Find You Out.
Dr. Charles Edward Locke, at the Cen
tral Methodist Church last evening,
preached a sermon on the subject, "Be
Sure Your Sin Will Find You Out." A
large audience fillled the church and
, those present listened with closest at
tention. Dr. Locke is conducting revival
services, meetings being held afternoons
and evenings. Deep interest is being
manifested in these special meetings. In
his sermon Dr. Locke said there were
two reasons why Bin cannot be concealed.
First, because sin is incompatible with
man's moral and physical nature, and
when sin is habitually committed and
laws are broken- the penalties of diso
bedience are imposed, and thus sin testi
fies against the sinner. The second rea
son is that man's conscience exposes
him. Conscience demands proper restitu
tion; it fastens guilt. Conscience does
not grow inactive with years, but sooner
or later j affiliates with unrelenting and
inevitable eludings.
THE BA!N FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 1898.
SERMON ON THE
DURRANT CRIME
Rev. J. A. Cruzan Draws
a Moral From the
Execution.
Declares That the Gallows Is
One of God's Awful
Teachers.
Emphasizes the Eternal Law Tha
"The Wapies of Sin Is
Daath."
BERKELEY, Jan. 9.â Rev. J. A. Cru
zan of the North Berkeley Congrega
tional Church preached this evening on
"The Shadow of the Gallows." He
pictured dramatically the various
scenes of the Durrant case, the mur
ders, the trial, the imprisonment and
the execution.
The preacher chose for his text Job
iv:8: "Even as I have seen, they that
plow iniquity and bow wickedness shall
reap the same." He spoke in part as
follows:
The black shadow of the gallows rests
upon oUr fair commonwealth. The awful
"horrors which desecrated Emmanuel
Church; the terrible trials; the battle in
the courts to evade the death penalty;
the final act last Friday, when the stern
hand of the law sent a young man, just
on the threshold of life. Into eternityâ
these terrible tacts are burned into our
memories. We cannot forget them If
ire would.
Horrible as it all was and is, the gal
lows is one of God's teachers. 1 judge
no man. '"With malice toward none, and
with charity for all." 1 would have you
sit for a little time to-night under the
"shadow of the gallows," and with
hushed hearts listen while this grim mes
; senger speaks.
The lirst lesson this horrible teacher
: utters is old and threadbareâ that sin,
I all sin. is fraught with peril. Had the
crowds which packed the courtroom dur
â  ing the trial* and that crowd in the San
i Wuentln death chamber been keen-eyed,
; they could have seen written on the
walls over the jury box and on the cross
beam of the gallows the words. "The
i wages of sin is death." written by the
same hand which penned the phrase on
Belahaisar'c banquet hall. Young people
arc in danger of forgetting this old,
i awful- truth. They see men plunging
into sin, but no evil consequences fol
low. On the other hand, these men seem
to enjoy life In an animal sort of way.
.Hut suddenly sin, which seemed so harm
less, shocks the world with an awful
crime and turns upon the wrong-doÂ«r.
Th< re, In the dead face <>r the victim, In
the suspense of the terrible trial. In the
â  long, dreary Imprisonment, on the cross
beam of the gallows, the dullest eyed
can read the old truth, "The wages of
sin is death."
The gallows teaches also the . lesson
that sin is a traitor. "Be sure your sin
will rind you out," says the Bible. The
keenest detective is sin itself. No trans
gression can be so securely hidden that
the guilty man can be absolutely safe
from discovery. No eye, save the mur
derer's, saw those terrible tragedies: the
secret was hidden In the vast silence of
the church. And yet how swiftly, surely,
unerringly the net was drawn around
the murderer and twelve men without
hesitancy said "Thou art the man!"
The gallows teaches also the truth that
the only safety is to resist sin in Its
beginning. The world is startled from
time to time by some terrible crime like
the Emmanuel Church horror. That full
sized crime did not spring up like Jonah's
gourd in a night. The seed which bears
horrible final fruit on the gallows takes
years for its growth and maturity. In
its seedling days the sin might have been
uprooted, but grown to maturity, in its
fall it crushes two lives and builds the
gallows from which a soul is hurled Into
eternity.
"The way of the transgressor is hard"
is another truth taught by the gallows.
This old truth had become blunted. Our
young people had seen the transgressor,
whose name in California is legion,
clothed in broadcloth and faring sumptu
ously. They had heard the rustle of her
silks along the streets. They had over
heard the transgressor's bacchanalian
orgies, hud seen him snap his fingers at
courts and go unwhipped of Justice. No
wonder that our young people began to
doubt God's word, and to think that
times had changed since Solomon's day,
and that now the way of the transgressor
had become easy. Then God rewrote
that old truth between the lines in the
countless columns of the dally press, in
the testimony of the witnesses, in the
verdict of the jury, in the wearing, agon
izing suspense, and at last on the walls
of the death chamber. The way of the
transgressor is hard. Truth is eternal.
It does not change.
There was not a step of all that hor
rible way from the belfry of Emmanuel
Church to the trap of the San Quentin
gallows that was easy. The- way of all
sin is hard. The goal is retribution. Let
us all beware of the sin of self-righteous
ness. The sin that puts a rope around a
man's neck is not the only sin to be
feared. God's thoughts are not as man's
thoughts.
A man may never violate a law of the
land and yet be held by sin. Dives was
such a man. He was not a sinner as
men count. There are no crimes laid at
his door. For aught wo know he was
one of Jerusalem's Four Hundred. Hut
he lived a selfish, unloving life. The
spirit of sin transfused him and became
his life. Though he broke no law the
loving Christ lifts the curtain of rternity
and we soe him among the lost. Sin, not
necessarily murder, but Bin. all sin. Is the
great enemy and soul-destroyer.
"Christ's Testimony of Himself."
BERKELEY. Jan. I.â Roy. H. c.
Minton this morning at the First Pres
byterian Church defended the divinity
of Jesus in a sermon on "Christ's
Testimony Concerning Himself ." The
sermon was in the nature of a reply to
the remarks made by K-w William
Geohegan of the I'nitarian Church in
his Christmas stvrmon. Dr. Minton de
clared it to be inconceivable how
Christ's statement that ho was the
son of God could be doubted or disbe
lieved, He also declared that none of
Christ's miracles were performed to
convince men of the truth of his decla
rations, but were performed only that
good might be done to others.

EXPLAINS TO
HIS CHURCH
Rev. Edwards Davis' Action Is
Indorsed by His
Church.
After Giving the Explanation, as Pub
lished in The Call, They Are
Satisfied.
Oakland Offiro San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 9.
The attendance of members at the
Central Christian Church was above
the average, but the outsiders were
scarce. Rev. Edwards Davis occupied
the pulpit, much to the surprise of
many of his congregation. He made
the statement to them that was pub
lished in to-day's Call, in denial of the
rumors In circulation affecting his
standing.
Elder Wishard, chairman of the
church officers, and the highest tribunal
of the church, stated that the church
accepted the defense and would not
even hold an investigation of the
charges made by the newspapers. The
morning services then proceeded with
out any more reference to the affair.
Mr. Davis announced to-night that
on next Sunday he would speak upon
"Capital Punishment," and at that
time he proposes to give a detailed ac
count of his visit to Durrant, his opin
ions formed from the visit and its re
sults. He is entirely satisfied with the
treatment accorded him by the church.
PRAISE GIVEN
TO THE CALL
The Lincoln Monument League
Thanks It for Its
Efforts.
President W. W. Stona Compliments
the Paper During h Speech at
Metropolitan Temple.
The Call's efforts In behalf of the
erection of the Lincoln Monument at
Golden Gate Park called forth the
praise of the Lincoln Monument Leagu*
at the Metropolitan Temple yesterday.
The remarks were made during the
speech of W. W. Stone, the president
of the organization, when he was in
troducing PlufWOf Rcrhner, the musi
cian, to whom a reception was being
given.
The gentleman was speaking of the
work done by the league, and the en
couragement they had received when
he said:
"The Lincoln Monument is not yet a
yoar old, hut it has issued 12.000 certifi
cates of membershrp and inaugurated
a Lincoln Day that will be celebrated
all over the United States. We find a
great deal of apparent apathy on the
part of the people, but this is only ap
parent, the love of Lincoln, his charac
ter and true devotion is universal, and
we need only to crystallize the senti
ment. We have taken means to do this,
and on the 14th of Pehruary next we
shall endeavor to see the fruits of our
labors.
"I cannot leave this subject without
expressing tho thanks of the league to
Th*Â» San Francisco Call for its noble ef
forts in seconding our labors. It has
responded to our call in a true spirit
of patriotism, and we feel that with
out its aid we should not have succeed
ed as we have done."
â The gcntlemtm then spoke a few
words, presenting Professor Rohner, the
guest of the day. After introducing
him the musician played several selec
tions on the organ, which were large
ly applauded. The soprano solo ren
dered by Miss abort and the vocal
selections given by the Knickerbocker
Quartet were also much appreciated.
Th? San Francisco Military Hand
rendered "The Jubilee March." which
was composed by Professor. Rohner In
remembrance of his visit to California,
Chicago being his home.

MOSS IS STILL
IN THE CELLS
The Real Estate Dealer Is Not
at All Desirous of
Liberty.
For Over a Month He Has Been
Hidden and No Action
Taken.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 9.
J. W. Moss, the once wealthy real
estate dealer, is still in the City Prison
and his sole object and that of those
who are responsible for his being there
seem to be to keep out of sight. His
case is a remarkable one and without
precedent at the City Hall.
Several weeks ago Moss was missing,
and as there was an explanation need
ed regarding his handling of the Paine
estate Judge Ogden removed him as
executor. About a month ago Mobs
suddenly returned from Honolulu and
gave himself up. It is said that a
warrant was out for his arrest, but
there is no record of any on the prison
docket. Moss has' wealthy friends, and
it was supposed at the time that every
thing had been squared and that Moss
had been released.
Much surprise was expressed to-day
when it became known that he was
still in the seclusion of the cells be
neath the City Hall. One of the offi
cers said that the prisoner is not anx
ious to be released and is staying in
jail till he recovers.
GAMBLERS HELD UP IN
A SALOON AT PRESCOTT.
Masked Robber With a Pistol Rakes In the
Coin of Roulette and Crap Games
and Escapes.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Jan. 9.â A daring
robbery occurred in the Palace saloon
at 4 o'clock this morning. All the games
in the saloon, except the crap game,
had been closed, and Bob Brown, the
proprietor, had just gone home. Bar
ney P>arnes, the barkeeper, was sitting
in the office at the end of the bar when
a masked man Jumped over the bar,
presented a pistol to his face and ord
ered him to hold up his hands and go
over to the crap game. As they reached
the crap game he ordered the roulette
dealer, who had just closed his game
and was standing near, to throw up his
hands alao, and taking the coin sack
from his left coatpocket he threw it
on the crap table and ordered the
dealer to put all- the money in the sack,
at the same time covering him with
a gun.
When the coin, $447, all in silver, had
been placed in the bag, he ordered the
dealer to tie the bag, and then throw
ing it over his left shoulder backed out
of the door, warning all not to make
a move or he would kill them.
About twenty men were in the saloon
at the time, but none were armed, and
the robber covered all likely to get
arms as soon as he entered. It is
though he had an accomplice on guard
outside, but only one man entered the
saloon. Two men, supposed to be the
robbers, boarded the northbound train
which passed less than half an hour
after the robbery.
NIGHT-WATCHMAN MURDERED.
Shot Down by a Prowler in Railroad Yards
at Middleiown. N. Y.
MIDDLETOWN, X.Y., Jan. 9.â Frank
Beckwith, a watchman in the employ
of the Ontario and Western railroad,
while in the performance of his duties
last night, noticed a man acting sus
piciously in the freight yard. He grasp
ed the man about the arms from be
hind, but he broke loose, and. imme
diately drawing a revolver, shot Beck
with twice through the lungs. Beck
with die<l tr.-day.
The murderer was Edward Simpson,
a former inmate of the Elmira Reform
atory, out on parole. He had no sooner
committed the act than he became pen
itent and told the whole story to the
persons who came up to him at the
sound of the revolver. Simpson helped
to carry the wounded man to his home.
Laid hjands Upon Then).
The Bishop of California ' visited the
Mission of the Good Samaritan on Second
street last evening for the purpose of ad
ministering the holy rite of confirmation
upon a large class of boys and girls,
which had been gathered into the church
and carefully instructed in the faith by
the Rev. Mr. Morgan, assistant minister
of the mission, which was crowded by the
parents and friends of the candidates. In
honor of the occasion the pretty chapel
had been carefully decorated with blaz
ing lights and beautiful flowers and never
presented so fine an appearance. The
bishop preached from Matthew vl:10,
"Thy will be done on earth." and his
discourse was particularly calculated to
impress the youths with the solemnity
and significance of the ceremony In which
they were participating, instituted by
Christ himself and his holy apostles and
continued to this day as one of the most
precious of all the gifts left to His
church. The bishop's address to the
class after they had been confirmed was
most impressive. Several of the candi
dates were members of the boy choir.

NATIONAL
GUARD NOTES
Two Important Changes
That Have Attracted
Attention.
Separation of the Naval From
the Land Foree â A Re
tirement.
What May Be Done at Fresno if There
Is an Election for Colonel
of the Sixth.
The two events that have excited the |
attention of the members of the Na
tional Guard in this city during the i
past week have been the request of
Colonel 11. P. Bush, assistant adjutant- j
general of the division, and the order â 
from headquarters at Sacramento, dl- i
recting that hereafter the naval militia i
shall report direct to headquarters in- j
stead of through division headquarters, j
as in the pas;.
As to the first there has been since ]
the announcement of the fact that
Colonel Bush had requested to be re
lieved from the duties of the position,
considerable speculation as to what
prompted him to take such a step. The
colonel, when he was captain of Com
pany H of the old First Regiment In
fantry, proved an excellent officer and
brought his company to a standard of
excellence that excited the admiration I
of those who were interested in the |
guard, and it also excited the envy of â 
many whose companies were not up I
with H. As captain of the company he i
was a strict disciplinarian, and, as was j
remarked by one of the men of his !
command, when there was anything to
be done, the captain insisted that it ,
should be done according to law and :
regulations and it had to be done.
When he became lieutenant colonel of
the First it was not long before there
arose a spirit of antagonism against
him, not as a man, but as a soldier of
the guard, and there was a certain fac
tion of officers who would have pre
ferred to have seen some one else there, j
and that feeling became more mani- '
fest when he was chosen colonel of the j
regiment. As the chief officer of the
regiment he demanded the same com
pliance with rules and regulations and j
law that he demanded of his men in
Company 11. A neglect in the per
formance of duties called forth a rep- j
rimand which was not relished by j
those who were negligent, and while !
he was respected by reason of his po- j
tuition, he was not liked on account of ;
his insistence for a compliance with '
National Guard laws and usage. Then
when he was taken from the list and
detailed on the division staff as assist
ant adjutant-general many of those
who were inimical to Mm set up a cry
that if he was retained in that position
the majority of officers on the staff
would resign. He did remain and since
then there has been a number of
resignations. After he took office he I
carried out his methods of exactitude I
in the presentation of reports and !
everything that had to pass through
headquarters. In many instances re
ports that were not made out as re
quired by law and which might have
been overlooked by some, were sent
back two and three times until they
were in conformity with law, a matter !
which with a very little extra care I
could have been done in the first in
stance as in the last. This aroused the
indignation of those companies that by j
reason of delay were kept out of
money they were entitled to draw from
the State, and instead of trying to con
form with the plain rules laid down the
officers of these companies spent twice
as much time in "kicking" as it would
have taken to do what was required of
them in a proper manner, with the re
sult that they made it very uncomfort
able for the assistant adjutant-general.
In an interview Colonel Bush said that
his private business did not allow him
the time to attend to the duties of the
office as they should be attended to,
and that was why he decided to ask
to be relieved. It is true that the man
ner in which he conducted the affairs
at headquarters took up a great deal of
his time, for he personally attended to
all the details and did all the clerical
work, but it is generally believed that
he was prompted to act as he did be
cause there were more kicks than
honor in the place. Whatever may have
been the true inwardness of the matter
the fact remains that Major-General
Nathan T. James, division commander,
has been unfortunate with his staff,
being unable to keep it together.
Now as to the act of the command
er-in-chief in taking the naval militia
out of division headquarters that is the
outcome of a plan that has been a long
time maturing. When the organization
â¢was first started it was known as the
Naval Reserve, then it branched out
into the Naval Battalion, and as it
grew in strength there was a manifest
desire that while the organization
should be a part of the National Guard,
that it should be an independent branch
of the service, and the first open evi
dence of this was the change in the
law of March 11, 1597, when it was
designated as "the naval militia of the
National Guard of California." At first
it was supposed that in the haste of
legislation the word militia had been
unintentionally used for battalion, be
cause in another part of the same law
describing what the National Guard of
the State shall consist of are the words
" and live divisions of the naval
battalion," but there were some who
said "wait and you will see that the
'militia' will break loose from the bal
ance of the guard." That those parties
were correct is shown by the order
â¢which takes the naval militia out of
the jurisdiction of the division com
mander and creates two divisions of the
National Guard, namely the land force
and the naval force.
L. A. Dt-yoe elected first lieutenant
and F. S. Munn second lieutenant of
company B, Fifth Infantry, have been
ordered before the examining board.
The resignation of Captain W. S.
Winters of company D of the Seventh
Infantry has been accepted.
THE SECOND BRIGADE.
The companies of the First Regiment
and no doubt the signal corps and the
trop of cavalry will make a fine show
ing 1 in the parade on Golden Jubilee
day. At the meeting of the board of
officers of the First the matter was
discussed and the details for the par
ade were left to Lieutenant Colonel
Duboce. The men will parade in full
dress and the majors of the several
battalions are engaged in inspecting
the uniforms in order that they shall
be in proper condition for the big show.
As the day will be a legal holiday, and
the great majority of the members of
the regiment who are employed in
will not have to work that day,
it is expected that there will be a large
turn out of the membership of the regi
ment, and every effort will be made to
have that portion of the procession
7tiarte as imposing as possible.
There has been considerable activity
In the armories, the several companies]
holding business meetings and having
the first drill of the year.
There has been some talk of bringing
the companies of the Fifth Regiment
Infantry on Jubilee day to take part in
the military division of the parade, but
up to last Saturday Colonel Fairbanks,
commanding the regiment, had not re
ceived any advices as to that matter.
In order to take part in the parade the
companies of the regiment would have
to come from San Jose, Petaluma, San
Rafael, Santa Rosa, Oakland, Alameda
and Napa.
THE THIRD BRIGADE.
The signal corps of the Third Brigade
held its annual meeting on the evening
of the 4th inst. Various new commit
tees were appointed for the year, and
J. W. Gee was unanimously re-elected !
clerk of the corps.
The report of Lieutenant Fred L.
Martin, commanding the corps, shows
that it stands within one of its full
quota of one officer and twenty enlist
ed men; the report presents the corps'
work during the past year, an account
of its camp in Summit Valley, the oc
cupation of Diablo, Marysville Buttes.
Vacaville, Auburn, Elk Grove, Antelope
and other points as signal stations dur
ing the year, also other matters of in
terest to the corps. It is a very com
plete document and comprehensive as
well.
A suggestion by Second Sergeant
Watkins that the corps inaugurate a
series of bicycle field days met the
hearty indorsement of Major W. \V.
Douglass, signal officer of the brigade.
After the matter had been fully ex
plained it was decided that the corps
should hold its first field day on Sun
day next, when the members will go
out on bikes carrying flags, heliographs
and other signaling apparatus. As
Corporal Cosby is the only one of the
corps who has never ventured on the
silent steed he has been detailed, much
to his satisfaction, to attend to the
commissary wagon for that day. A
committee was named to select signal
stations and a "run" for the outing.
At the close of the meeting there
was an informal smoker, a short pro
gramme of song and music and a sol
diers' banquet. There were present at
the meeting Colonel John W. Guthrie
of the Second Infantry. Major Doug
lass and Scott F. Ennis, As
semblyman from Sacramento and
at one time a member of
the corps, and each of these spoke en
couragingly of the^orps, its work and
its prospects.
As predicted in this department the
contest for the lieutenant-colonelcy of
the Sixth Regiment of Infantry on
last Wednesday was an exciting one,
and it was long after midi:ight before
the decisive ballot was cust. As al
ready stated, the contest was a sec
tional one, for the reason that the
election of a lieutenant-colonel carried
with it the possibility of a chan
regimental headquarters if Colonel
S. S. Wright intends to carry out his
purpose of resigning In spring. If he
does then Lieutenant-Colonel Cook of
Stockton, who was elected after many
ballots by a majority of one, may be
chosen colonel, and he will remove thÂ»>
headquarters from Fresno, at which
point they are now located, back to
Stockton, where they were for many
years prior to the election of Colon<*l
Wright about a year ago. But this
may be all upset, for Fresno wants to
retain the headquarters, and there is
a possibility that those who favor
Fresno will put in the field, in case
there is an election for colonel, a
member of the guard in opposition to
the lieutenant-colonel, who will be
favorable to maintaining headquarters
at Fresno.
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
It had been intended to tow the
Marion from Mare Isla*nd to this port
and after mooring her alongside of the
Oamanohe remove the stores and coal
from the monitor to the Marion, then
moor the last-named vessel to a b*Tth
at Folsom-street wharf. This idea
was, however, abandoned, and the Ca
manchH was towed up to the island and
there the transfer will b^> made, after
which the Muri<.n will steam down to
this harbor. Owing to the illness of the
Governor, who is commander-in-chief
of the land and the naval fortes, it has
been decided nÂ«>t to bring the Marion
down until Jubilee week, as it is de
sired that the Governor should be on
board. After the vessel shall have been
docked all the material n<>w in the ar
mory on East street will be transferred
to the vessel.
Captain Turner, commanding the
Naval Militia, expresses himp-lf as
well pleased with the order that takes
the militia out of the Jurisdiction of
the division commander of the Na
tional Guard of this State. He ex
pressed the opinion that a commander
of land forces is not the proper person
to command a naval force, for the rea
son that a landsman is not up to the
requirements of a naval force. He is
of the opinion that in the National
Guard the land and the sea forces
should be as distinct as are the army
and the navy of the United States.
TRAFFIC MANAGER BURIED.

Southern Pacific Railroad Company,

All the Leading Clubs Engaged

Skill.
Despite Handicap of Numb Fingers
Some Good Shooting
Done.
The rifle and pistol ranges at Shell
Mound presented yesterday the usual
scenes of animation which result from
a conclave of leading shooting clubs
for a contest in marksmanship. The
weather was favorable to the pur
poses in hand, so far as concerned
clearness of atmosphere and lack of
wind, but the low temperature which
prevailed as the day waned gave many
a marksman an excuse on the score of
numb digits for not doing better work.
The Independent Rifles shot their
monthly medal shoot, 200 yards range,
best out of fifty, with this score:
F. Hau, 41; J. H. Kuhlke, 40; Sergeant
C. Comback. 37; Corporal J. Mindermann,

THE CHINESE NEW YEAR.
Preparations Beir>g Made for Its
Celebration, but There is Doubt
as to Its Date.
There is considerable doubt in China
town as to when the Chinese New Year
begins, and on this account it is prob
able that the celebration will not be so
general as has been the usual custom
in years past. The merchants differ in
their ideas of the day, some claiming
that January 20andothers that the 21st
is the one to be celebrated, and from
information given out at the Consul's
house they are all wrong, and January
22 is the Chinese New Year's day.
The Consul has recently had some
correspondence with the Minister at
Washington in regard to the matter,
and the discovery has been made that
heretofore the wrong day has been cel
ebrated by the Mongolians, and the
correction will be made this year. In
China New Year's Day falls on the
22d for this year, and the effort is to
be made to have that day celebrated
by the Chinese all over the world.
Efow the mistake in the day came
about originally is hard to say, but
one explanation given is that the first
Chinese who came here became mixed
in their dates, perhaps on account of
the change in time between here and
China, and by oversight or neglect the
error was never remedied. In spite of
the fact that they are not quite sure
which day is New Year's the people
are making preparations for the holi
day, and the outcome of the muddle
will probably be that each individual
will celebrate on the day which he
thinks the proper one..
As yet no order has been issued from
the Chief of Police in regard to the
shooting of firecrackers, but it is
thought that form of celebration will
be permitted this year, although it was
prohibited last year. Everything seems
to be quiet among the highbinder so
cieties, and no rumor of trouble has
reached the ears of the police, so it is
expected that the holiday will pass
without any sensations.

REST HAS
NOT COME
WITH DEATH
Remains of Durrant
Not Suffered to Lie
â¢in Peace.
Even Up. to the Unholy
Hour of Midnight Vis
itors Called.
Rumors of a Hack Hired
as the Murderer's
Hearse.
DEEP SECRECY PREVAILED
All Kinds of Strange Stories Current
as to the Disposal of the
Body.
Death has not brought that rest
Theodore Durrant so uiien asserted
was to be his â at least so far as the
casket of clay delivered to his parents
when the hangman had finished his
v.ork is concerned.
Up to midnight out in the little
dwelling on Fair Oaks street father
and mother kept watch over their
dead. Toward the "witching hour"
rumors of a secret funeral at dead of
night began to fly through the town.
Well-defined stories of a cortege of
private hacks destined for "Fair Oaks
street, en route for an out-of-town
cemetery, were commonly current.
Names, hours and other particulars
were mentioned and the idea was read
ily caught up, so well did a midnight,
eecret interment chime In with the
popular theory of a befitting end for
the murderer. At the house, how
ever, the stories were liatly denied.
One of the attendants stated positive
ly that the corpse had not been re
moved, but at 2 o'clock this morning
was still in its casket at the home of
the bereaved parents.
In addition it was claimed that a
permit to remove the body from the
country was essential, and Secretary
Godchaux of the Board of Health posi
tively denied that any such permit had
been issued.
Some disposition of the body must' be
made within the next thirty-six hours,
or the Durrants will find themselves in
conflict with the law. That part of the
Code providing for the Board of Health
reads In' effect that all deaths must be
reported to that body within five days
and some disposition made of the re
mains, either by burial, cremation or
removal to another place.
Secretary Godchaux of the Board of
Health was in his office the greater
part of the day yesterday, but no
word was received from the Durrant
family: not even was the death certi
ficate filed. As nothing can be done
with the remains until this has been
done and the necessary permit has
been granted, a decision will have to be
reached by the parents of the youthful
assassin within the next few hours.
It was stated by a friend of the fam
ily that they were waiting to hear from
the Los Angeles Crematory people be
fore making their decision. Up to last
night no reply had been received to
Mr. Durrants telegram asking if the
body could be cremated there, and it
was still hoped that permission would
be granted. If it is refused, the burial
will probably take place in Holy Cross
Cemetery.
There were few callers at the Dur
rant house yesterday, and none but
close friends were admitted to the
house of death. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Durrant kept close within doors, and
as the drawn blinds were no attraction
to the curious, there was no loitering
about the vicinity.
The question was raised yesterday
whether the authorities had a right to
deliver Durrani's body to his parents
without an autopsy being held, and the
opinion was expressed that the State
Board of Health had the right to hold
an autopsy if its members thought fit
to do so. There is no law relating to
the holding of autopsies by the Board
of Health, that function being left to
the Coroner of the county, who in
cases of violent death may waive the
holding of an autopsy- if he chooses to
do so.
FEAST OR THE EPIPHANY.
At St. Igoatius Church Last Even
ing father Rickey Delivered
an Interesting Address.
At St. Ignatius Church last evening
Father Hickey spoke of the feast of
the Epiphany. "Where is he that was
born King of the Jews?" were his first
words, and he followed on the birth of
Christ and the guiding star which had
been seen, and satisfied those who were
in search of the Savior.
The story was again told of the son
of Mary, who had died to save sinners,
and the teachings which have followed
his ascent into heaven. Then death
was spoken of and the hope of life
where his teachings were heeded. Be
ing the first Sunday following the Epi
phany, as well as the closing of the
holidays, special music had been pre
pared.
STOLE A KEG OF BEER.
James Brady and Joseph Souza
Charged With Burglary.
James Brady and John Joseph Souza,
ex-convicts, wore booked at the City
Prison yesterday by Policeman Hutch -
ings on a charge of burglary. They are
â  accused of breaking into the store of
Henry Misel, Montgomery and Union
streets, last Wednesday night and
stealing a keg of beer, a ladder and
other articles.
Brady has another charge of burg
lary booked against him. He is accus
ed of breaking into 103 Greenwich
street and stealing a rubber coat and
other articles on the morning of Janu
ary 6.
"Why Should We Pray? 1
The fourth of the series of sermon:
which are being given on Sunday ever,
ings at the First Baptist Church by E
A. Woods. D.D., was entitled "Why D<
We Pniy?" The reverend gentleman sai<
in part:
"What is the Almighty that we should
serve him? What profit should we h*V<
if we pray unto Him?"â Job xxi:ls.
They were wicked men who said uni<
God, "Depart from us," but they suegrs
to' us the question, "Why should \\.
pray?"
If there is no God, prayer is an ab
surdity. and to teach suffering men
weeplngr women and helpless children to
pray is to deceive them and is a crime.
If God is simply law. or the nature of
things, prayer Is foolishness. No sane
man would pray to gravitation to let him
fall without harm from a housetop.
If God has created this world and then
left it to itself, then prayer is useless*
If God is angry with us and does not
care for us because we have disobeyed
Him. then prayer is a vain thing.
If God has decided absolutely that some
shall be Bared and all others lost, then
why should men pray whose salvation ts
impossible?
But. on the other hand, prayer 1b nat
ural to man. Our moral instincts de
mand respect.
The noblest and best men of our race
have been men of prayer. The Bible
makes prayer a duty and a privilege.
Honest prayer will affect character.
Paid Thomas Fuller. "Either praying
will make thee leave off sinning or sin
ning will make thoe leave off praying."
Let us remember the command to
"Pray without ceasing." We have dori>
much that we ought not to have done;
let us pray for forgiveness. We need so
much which God alone can give. Let us
;isk Him. God has given us many bless
ings. Let us thank Him, and such
thanksgiving is prayer.
BIDDING GOOD-BY TO COLONEL CORNWALL FROM THE TUG.
When Colonel W. EL Cornwall reaches his island home in Honolulu he will undoubtedly receive the warm welcome to
which he is entitled from his numerous friends there, but it is safe to predict that the welcome at his homecoming will
not give him as much of a thrill of pleasure as did the evidences of friendship bestowed upon him by those who bade him
bon voyage as the big steamer Moana left this port yesterday at noon.
â¢ Colonel Cornwall, who is well known In club and social circles of this city, is an extensive planter of the Hawaiian
Islands and was a member of .the staff of King Kalakaua at the time of that monarch's death. Hle position on the
islands has been of such nature as to bring him closely in touch with all the commercial and industrial Interests of the
country, and his close attention to his business affairs there worked such inroads in his health that a rest was neces
sary, which he took in this city.
When it became" known that he intended to depart for his home his many friends showed by every means in their
power that they appreciated his friendship and would regret his departure. The last week of his stay in the city
was marked with dinners and social functions of various character, and as a final testimonial of their esteem it was de
cided to give him a farewell that would in a measure show the regard in which he was held.
As the big ocean liner backed slowly out of her berth at the foot of Pacific street the State tug Governor Irwln,
with a party of Bohemian Club members aboard, steamed from the adjoining slip and kept pace with the big boat down
to the heads, where, amfd blowing whistles and oft-repeated "good-bys," the last salutes were given and the tinal "god
speeds" were shouted across the intervening space.
In addition to the few who were accommodated on the tug the wharf was crowded with gentlemen and ladles who
had gone there to bid their friends farewell, and as the vessel went down the stream the pier was white with the waving
of many handkerchiefs, while from adjacent vessels salutes were sounded and the good wishes of hundreds followed the
steamer out to sea.
The Moana carried out a good list of passengers, who crowded the fides of the vessel, watching the unusual spec
tacle of the escorting friends, and the genial Captain Carey ordered the engines slowed down just at the parting, in or
der that the final words might be lingered over.

enjoyment is doubled. Yesterday :
President Shannon was in the field j
during most of the day, but he re- (
ceived a great disappointment when |
his fleet hound Swinnerton lost the
ooarae to Joy Bells in the third ties.
Lawyers and business men helped
swell the crowd, which stayed on the
grounds until after the final had been
won and lost. T. Lennon was in evi
dence, and the way he placed his
money on the dogs proved him to be
one of the talent. George Malcolm
was surrounded by a throng of ad
mirers as he won bet after bet, but it
is thought he "went against it" when
Sylvia beat Valley \lald in the fourth
ties.
Pat Malloye, who won his course up
to the third, is thought to be one of the
best that started yesterday. It is said
that no dog that ever ran a hare can
show the way for the first turn. The
stake yesterday was for beaten dogs
who have not won first, second or third
money for the past six months. The
best courses of the day were in the
second ties between Pat Malloye and
Cliffette, Sylvia and Magic and Swin
nerton and Lightning. A barrel of
money changed hands when Sylvia
beat Pat Malloye, as it was the general
opinion that the result would be just
the reverse.
The course between Tessie Fair and
Mountain Lassie was easily won by
the former, but the winner was slight
ly favored by the hare, which seemed
to turn under the hound's feet. Most
of the owners who started their
hounds yesterday were present, and
the talk of the great improvement of
the methods of coursing, as well as
changes for the better in the way of
conveniences for the public and the
general management, could be heard
on all sides. In fact, it is acknowl
edged that coursing Is the favorite
sport of the day. A good percentage
of the hares managed to find the es
cape, and the result as to points was
closely tallied by the onlookers. It is
thought some of the best hares on the
coast will start at the next meeting.
It was noticed that none of Curtis &
Son's dogs started amung the non
winners yesterday, which goes to show
what an excellent string they are in
possession of.

DERHAM TO
RESIGN HIS
POSITION
There May Be a Va
cancy in the Board
of Education.
A Kick Over Committee
Chairmanship Is
the Cause.
President Barrington's Recent
Apportionment Ends
in Trouble.
HARMONY NOT POSSIBLE.
Superintendent Webster Has tha
Naming of the Successor of
th.c Director.
Trouble has begun in the BoaÂ»-d of
Education over the apportionment of
committees that was made by Presi
dent Barrington on Monday evening
last.
Director Derham is the principal ob
jector, and his kick is occasioned by the
fact that he lost the chairmanship of
the Elementary committee, one of the
most important in the gift of the presi
dent.
The change was made, according to
President Barrington, who is admitted
by all to be the fairest presiding officer
that the board has had for several
years, because many complaints had
been received that the communications
that are addressed to the committee
were not given proper consideration
and were allowed to remain in the pos
sossion of the chairman when they
should have been submitted to his con
freres.
Shortly after the meeting on Monday
night last, when Director Derham was
given the Health and Hygiene commit
tee and relieved from the chairmanship
of the Elementary committee, he tele
phoned to Secretary tV'elch and
stated that he desired to resign from all
committees, not only as chairman, but
as even a member.
At the same time he intimated that
he did not intend to stay long on the
board and that he desired to be re
lieved of all responsibility. Such threats
have been made by School Directors
before, and very little attention was
paid to the matter. Since that com
munication was received it has de
veloped that Director Derham is sin
cere in his intentions of getting out.
He believes that he has not been fair
ly treated, in spite of the fight he has
made against the majority and control-
Hng element in the board, and that he
should have been retained as chairman
of the Elementary committee in spite of
all that has happened. Should his
resignation be accepted by the board
Superintendent Webster will have the
naming of his successor, subject to the
confirmation of the board.
"Director Derham telephoned to As
sistant Secretary O'Donnell a few days
ago," said Secretary Welch last even
ing, "and requested him to see that his
name was kept out of the printed list
of committees. He gave no particular
reason, but it is pretty well understood
that the change in the chairmanship of
the elementary committee is responsible
for his desire to resign. "
Dr. Kagan had heard that Director
Derham was anxious to get out of all
committee work because he thought he
had been unfairly treated in the dis
tribution of committee chairmanships.
Secretary Welch has ignored Mr.
Derham's request to be left o.ff all
committees, believing that he has no
more right to leave his name off than
to put it on. If the Director wishes to
resign he must do so at a regular meet
ing of the board and by offering his
resignation to the board.
HIS MEMORY HONORED.
The Remains of plorio Antonovicl)
Borne to Their Last Rest
ing Place.
One of the largest funerals that has
passed through the streets of San
Francisco for some time was that of
Florio Antonovich, the well-known and
popular founder of the Austrian Mili
tary and Benevolent Association and
Slavonic Illyric Benevolent Society.
"Honest Antone," as he was familiar
ly termed by the thousands who knew
him for the past forty years on the
city front, was followed to Calvary
Cemetery by hundreds of mourners
who turned out to pay their last re
spects to his memory. The Austrian
military band, with the members of
the company, in their gray uniforms,
was there, as was also the members of
the Illyric civic society, besides hun
dreds of other citizens.
Antonovich arrived in San Francisco
in 1851, being one of the crew of the
ship Flying Cloud that made that re
markable voyage from New York to
San Francisco in eighty-eight days.
Arriving in this city he opened a res
taurant on the city front, which he
conducted for forty yearf while at the
same time he invested iiÂ» mining stock
and accumulated considerable property.
During all of his many years in this
city his greatest pride was in being
an American citizen.
His remains were taken to St. Fran
cis' Church where religious services
were held by Father Giles prior to those
afterward held by the Illyric Society at
the grave, where A. Maluvich, the sec
retary, spoke of thÂ» life of the de
ceased.
The following were the pallbearers:
A. Smythe, M. Comaich, G. Vitvich,
M. Cresalia. Captain V. Zuper. J. Tod
ish, R. Maroevich, L*uke Marich, G.
Franciscovieh and V. Bakulioh.

A Hot Time Promised in Native Sons
Hall for Those Who Like
to Frolic.
Should any preoccupation be noticed
today in the manner of any of our
leading grocers it may be attributed to
visions of wine, woman and revelry.
For to-night the California Travelers'
Association is to hold high carnival in
Native Sons' Hall.
Not only the grocers but all the
friends of the members of the associa
tion, be their business what it may,
are cordially invited. The wise men of
the road are well versed in the con
duct of such matters, and a good time
is promised to everybody. There will
be edibles for the hungry, long, cooling
drinks for those who thirst and for
those of the older generation who pre
fer the more quiet delight of conversa
tion phonographs will be provided.
No distinction will be made in age or
importance. There will be partners for
everybody, ranging from four hundred
pound girls for the heavy merchant of
California street to diminutive dolJs
for the small though ambitious cash
boy.
The California Commercial .Travelers'
Association, of whom James R. T. Mer
shon.is president, is composed of about
one hundred and twenty-five members
taken from the Pacific Coast Travel
ers and the San Francisco Travelers'
Association. All the members are local
men running out of San Francisco. The
organization is a young one and this is
its first entertainment, so the travelers
expect to have it well attended, espe
cially as the price of admission is only
50 cents.
Besides dancing and a general good
time there will be a great deal of pro
fessional talent which will give an en
tertainment composed of amusing spe
cialties, good singing and living pic
tures from the Klondike.
