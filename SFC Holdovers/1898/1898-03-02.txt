â¢ HAVANA, Cuba, March i, via the Herald-Call dispatch
boat Albert F. Dewey. â The Maine's back was broken.
The latest discoveries made by the divers not only support
the information printed by the Herald and The Call con
cerning the disclosures of paramount importance made by
Ensign Powelson, but convince those in charge of the sub
marine investigation beyond a doubt that a mine rent the
United States battleship asunder.
lam able to write positively. The keel of the ship has
been found in two pieces, the nearest ends of which are
now separated by a distance of from two and a half to
three feet.
The sections are no longer lying in one straight line,
but show the effect of the force exerted from port to star
board.
It is evident from the discovery of the present condi
tion of the keel that the section of the ship's bottom found
twenty-nine feet from its natural position was wrenched
from the keel by the first explosion and driven upward.
The keel itself was forced in the middle until it was broken
in two, and then collapsed in two sections, which fell in
the position in which the divers found them yesterday.
1 am assured by reliable persons, familiar with the re
sults of high explosives and with wrecks above and under
water, that the breaking of the keel as now disclosed could
not possibly have been done by an inside explosion.
In fact, this last discovery of the manner in which the
Maine's back was broken, taken together with the earlier
disclosures made public by the Herald, has convinced the
men working about the wreck that further investigation as
to the manner in which the ship was blown up is perfectly
useless and they consider the question solved beyond
doubt
The court of inquiry will, of course, hear evidence of
the wrenching apart of the keel. The divers and the offi
cers in charge will testify, but the feeling among the
American naval officers in Havana is that beyond the re
covery of the dead remaining in the wreck all useful work
in connection with the Maine wreck has been done. 1
know that letters have been sent from here to several Rep
resentatives and Senators in Washington warning them
against voting for an appropriation for raising the Maine,
saying that the work would not only cost millions, but
would not add anything to the information regarding the
nature of the explosion.
A photograph, which is in itself evidence of the nature
of the explosion, was taken yesterday. It shows the Maine's
dog standing on that part of the wreckage still above water.
The fact is that the plate on which the dog stands came
from the keel of the ship and was the lowest part of the
tremendous mass of material thrown upward and to star

ALL HAVANA WELCOMES
THE CRUISER VIZCAYA
vopyfighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, March i.â The arrival of the Vizcaya created enthu- (
siasiTi in a{l parts of the city, and there was a great demonstration at 4
La Punta, the Caballeria San Francisco and Machina wharf. The <
battle-ship was sighted at 5 o'clock and the fact wns announced by <
rockets and guns fired in all parts of the city. Immediately the streets <
were filled with prople, who began to race for La Punta. Morro Castle <
hid the Vizcaya from view for half an hour. Then, as she came into ..t
sight, thousands went wild, throwing their hats in the air and shout- (
ing, "Viva Espana, viva El Vizcaya." <
Slowly the Vizcaya turned into the channel and under full steam <
came to Morro. Opposite the castle eleven guns were fired by the <
cruiser and at each one renewed cheers were given for the ship, and <
the Vizcaya's crew at quarters answered with cheers for Cuba. Pro- J
ceeding down the harbor the Vizcaya gave the usual salutes to the
commanding general and others, and then came to anchor in the berth â 
made vacant for her by the Alfonso XIII. - .
AH this time cheers followed the Vizcaya down the harbor; the ,
people racing from La Punta to Machina wharf to re-engage in the ,
demonstration. <
It had been expected that cries for Weyler would have been given, ,
tut they were not, as the great demonstration was without political 1
signification. . v - : ;. '
The Vizcaya reports all well, with the weather fine after leaving 1
New York. Captain Eulate told me the engines had not been run more Â«
than at two-thirds their capacity. ; â¢
The Equendo is expected daily. Â»
are discussing the position in
which Spain will stand if the
.report of the court of inquiry
is that a submarine mine de
stroyed the Maine, but does
not say whether the Spanish
authorities are responsible. It has been
said by many who have suspended judg
ment that no government can be held
responsible for the act of a fanatic,
which all admit. In speaking of this
yesterday a naval officer said to me
that when a friendly harbor is mined,
and the battleship of a friendly nation
is anchored over the mine and so great
a loss of life results as to make the dis
aster a national calamity, the question
then arises how is it that secrets re
garding mines and the means of explod
ing them are known to a. fanatic or to
evil disposed persons. Such informa
tion, he added, is in possession of only
the engineer corps, whose business it is
to place mines, keep them in order and
fire them in time of war. Obviously it
could not be public property.
He referred again to the bearing of
the fact, now daily discussed by Ameri
cans here, that the Maine had not swung
to port until the night of the explosion,
and, so, presumably, had not until that
time been brought exactly over a mine
by the conditions of wind and tide. In
Havana one cannot buy powder, gun
cotton, dynamite, or even arms, there
fore this officer could not see how a
fanatic could have done the awful work
unless he were one of a body that knew
the location of the explosives in the
harbor and the means of firing them.
There has been much talk along this
line by Americans in Havana. I think
they do not regard as trustworthy the
reports that certain men were heard to
say the Maine would be blown up, for
the reason that any one who might have
had an intimation to that effect would
not be the sort of person to talk about it
in advance of the event. Such reports
are rather an evidence of the strong
feeling against Americans on the part
of the population generally.
The position of Americans in Havana
to-day is difficult to estimate accurately
An attempt was made to hold a meeting
of foreign residents last night, at which
it was intended to adopt resolutions de
precating the sensational reports regard
ing the outlook and to thank the au
thorities for their considerate treatment
so far, but the meeting was not held.
Some Americans, while realizing that
much alarmist matter has been printed
without cause by unreliable newspapers,
felt that the proposed meeting was an
attempt to entrap them into an expres
sion of opinion against having the
United States Government provide
proper protection, and the meeting fell
through.
Havana to-day is quiet and all resi
dents are allowed to go their way in
peace. But Americans feel that any
cause of excitement, such as the arrival
of another United States ship, or even
of the Spanish fleet, might cause a
demonstration,, and once excited no man

knows what hot-blooded people might
do. y - : 'r'.r- " â  :â â â . â â 
Experience has shown that the mili
tary police are slow to interfere with
rioters. A disturbance which, in an
American city, would be nipped in the
bud, is in Havana likely to assume pro
portions making it impossible of con
trol before the authorities show an iron
hand and charging cavalry and loaded
cannon are in the streets. The sym
pathy of the volunteers is with the mob
and their disaffection with General
Blanco must be reckoned in consider
ing a possible disturbance.
When I left Havana on board the
Herald-Call steamer Albert F. Dewey
to-day, the city had seldom been quieter,
and there was absolutely no visible sign
of demonstration. The bull fight on
Sunday was a most brutalizing spectacle,
arousing the mad enthusiasm of thous
ands. Senator Proctor was among the
Americans who visited the ring for the
first time, and was disgusted.
Americans who have asked recently of
Consular attaches for an opinion regard
ing the danger of remaining in Havana
have been told there is always more or
less danger in a country under military
law. but that Spain must protect foreign
residents if she hopes to keep her place
in the concert of civilized nations, and
will, no doubt, attempt to do so.
The Bache left Havana at noon to-day
to carry the four wounded Maine sur
vivors to Dry Tortugas. These are the
last of the injured. I saw them taken
alongside in the doctors' cutter. The
harbor was rough to-day and the little
boat tossed a great deal, but there was
never a moan from the sufferers. Two
were assisted and two were carried up
the side of the Bache. and tenderly as
the men tried to handle them they must
have suffered agony, but the wounded
made no sign, displaying the same forti
tude as did the wounded on the night
of the disaster and the morning follow
ing.
A new move on the part of the Ha
vana authorities was made known to me
to-day, the meaning of which is not yet
quite clear. In future they will demand
two hours' notice of the departure of the
Herald-Call dispatch steamer Albert F.
Dewey. The pretense is that this action
is taken because of a suspicion that the
boat carries passengers, which, of
course, is absurd, as she clears regularly
with the regular number of the crew
only.
It may be that the new precaution is
due to the opinion at the palace that the
situation is becoming grave because of
the presence of American ships at Key
West. It is well-known, of course, both
at Havana and at Key West that the
Dewey's mission is simply to carry
news. Passengers would find her wet
and wild in weather like to-day.

FUTURE POLICY OF
THE ADMINISTRATION
UNDER CONSIDERATION
Not Yet Ready to Admit It Officially, but Nobody
Expects the Finding That the Explosion
Came From Within.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
NEW YORK, March I.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: When the
report of the Court of Inquiry in
vestigating the Maine disaster is re
ceived in Washington there will be
no delay on the part of the President
in formulating his demand upon
Spain for whatever degree of repara
tion that report may make necessary.
Whether the administration as
sumes that Spain was responsible or
not, it is a fact that the authorities
are now engaged in considering the
law and precedents which will be ap
plicable in case Spain's responsibility
is established.
It will not be officially admitted,
but there is ample evidence to jus
tify the statement that the authori
ties are not expecting tnat the find
ings of the Court of Inquiry will af
ford any basis for the theory of an
explosion from within. The careful
consideration which has been given
to international law in the ques
tion would, of itself, justify this con
clusion.
The starting point of the present
deliberations of the President is the
likelihood that the report of the Court
of Inquiry will show that an exter
nal explosion destroyed the Maine,
'me President has held from the be
ginning the view that war is not to
be thought of, except as a cure for or
an alternative of some greater evil.
This was also the view, it maybe said,
of Washington, Jefferson, of Monroe,
of Jackson. It is admitted that the
President has no power to do any
thing else in the direction of repara
tion for the injury but to demand in
demnity. Other expedients are for
Congress. It is an undeniable his
torical fact that in James Monroe's
day, and since, the aim of our Gov
ernment has invariably been to ob
tain redress by measures that stop
short of war.
Precedents show a broad range
of injuries for which indemnity,
whether voluntarily paid by the of
fending nation or extracted from it
by measures of reprisal, has been re
garded as proper reparation. The
methods have been almost as various
as the occasions. In demanding in
demnity two purposes have always
been consulted, to compensate the suf
ferer and prevent a repetition of the
offense. Naturally, the forms in
which indemnity has been rendered
have been determined by the relative
importance of these objects in the
particular cases, and, of course, by
conditions which have made one pro- I
cedure practicable and another im
practicable.
Congress, if it chooses, may exact ]
THE SECRET PASSAGE
UNDER HAVANA HARBOR.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., March I.â The late Dr. G. L.
Hunter of this city, a noted medical man and scientist, ex
plored the secret underground passages which wind around
under Havana harbor while in Cuba thirty-two years ago.
His widow, Mrs. Lucy Y. Hunter, has in her possession a
photograph of a section of the secret passage which her
husband took at the time of his explorations. Mie also re
ceived a number of letters at the time describing the
passage.
He stated in a letter that the main passage led under
the waters of the harbor troin Morro Castle and that soon
after the harbor was reached it branched out into a num
ber of lateral passages which formed a network under
the entire harbor and aggregated many miles In length.
Tney were very close to the bed of the bay. The pas
sages were a part of the fortifications, but he did not
state in his letters the exact object for which they were
intended.
compensation for injury to American
citizens or insults to the American
nation by a method not so friendly;
that is, by reprisals on the offending
nation and its citizens or subjects. â '}[.
Reprisals are not war, but they
lead so naturally to war that our ,
constitution has confided to Congress
the granting of letters of marque and .
reprisal. .
If Congress, therefore, is content \
to have the Maine disaster expiated
in any other way than by war; if, in
other words, it cares to support the
President in obtaining full redress
without an actual infraction of the
peace of nations, it will arm him with ;
authority to act. This, of course, on ;
the assumption that the result of the '
pending investigation will fix on |
Spain the responsibility for the dis- j

THE COURT WANTS
EXPERT OPINIONS.
Bear Out Evidence Already Given
As to the Cause of the Destruc
tion of the Maine.
Copyrighted. IW, by James Gordon Bonnott.
KEY WEST, Fla., March I. â It was
not expected that to-day's testimony be
fore the Naval Court of Inquiry would
add any important facts to the knowl
edge already in hand, and it did not.
To judge alone by the number of wit
nesses examined this has been the
board's most busy day. but the testi
mony consisted exclusively of the per
sonal experiences of a large number of
the Maine's officers and men on the
night of the explosion who, in the very
nature of the case, could be expected to
throw much light on what is now
the only vital question, What is the dis
aster's primary cause?
The court was a little late in assem
bling. Marine Orderly McKay, who
stood guard yesterday outside the door
of the Judge's room, in which the ses
sion was held, had given place to-day to
another man, McKay being one of the
witnesses summoned for the morning
session. At a few minutes before 10
o'clock quite a procession of marines
and bluejackets, all of them men of the
Maine who had passed through the ex
plosion unscathed or only slightly
injured, came marching down to the
Federal building from the Marine Bar
racks in the well-known swinging steps
of United States men-of-war's men.
The whites and blacks in Key West's
streets looked on them almost affec
tionately as they passed. They filed into
the large courtroom and there awaited
their summons individually from the in
ner room.
The witnesses heard during the day
were: Passed Assistant Engineer Fred
erick C. Bowers, Assistant Engineer
John R. Morris, Navel Cadets Pope,
Washington and Arthur Crenshaw.
Lieutenant Blandin, one of the watch
officers, was recalled for a few moments
to amend certain portions of his testi
mony of yesterday, and then followed
other witnesses in this order: Private
Edward McKay of the Maine's marine
guard; Apprentices Ambrose, Horn
and C. J. Dressier; Sergeant Michael
Meehan of the marine corps, -and Cor
poral Frank G. Thompson, also of the
marine corps.
After Lieutenant Jungen had also
been recalled for a few minutes testi
mony was given by Master-at-Arms
John G. Load; Seaman Peter Larson
and Louis Moriniere, boatswain; Mate
Charles Bergman, Landsmen George
Fox and Michael Lanahan, Coal-passer
Thomas Melville, Coxswain Benjamin
K. Wilbur, Fireman John H. Pank,
Seaman Otto Rare, Fireman William
Gastrell, Seaman Edward Martin, Sea
man Martin Larsen and Mess Attend
ant John H. Turpin, colored.
The most important arrival here to
day was that of Naval Constructor
Hoover, who came in on the steamer
City of Key West, having journeyed
directly from his post at League Island
Navy Yard, Philadelphia. On the re
turn of the Naval Court to Havana,
which, as already announced, will prob
-Ki v be on Thursday, Constructor
Hoover is expected to make a careful
inspection of the Maine wreck, and he
' is likely to be one of the most important
I witnesses yet to be heard, especially if,
! as expected, his examination tends to
'â  confirm Ensign Powelson's important
â¢: evidence, given exclusively in the Fler
aid. To-morrow's witnesses will prob
ably be few and unimportant.
There is probably no truth in the
Brunswick (Ga.) story that ex-Con
gressman Springer received warnings
on the day of the Maine disaster. If he
had done so Deputy Consul Springer
would doubtless have been one of the
first witnesses to appear at Havana be
fore the Naval Court of Inquiry, and
he would have been anxious to do so.
Springer was never called as a witness
and at no time boarded the Mangrove.

HAVANA, March I.â Senator Proc
tor, with his friend. Colonel Parker,
and Consul-General Lee, made a call of
courtesy by appointment to-day on
Captain-General Blanco. Secretary
Jose Congosto accompanied the party
and acted also as interpreter. General
Blanco received his visitors with great
cordiality, and a pleasant talk on gen
eral matters ensued. Senator Proctor
said he was glad to visit the beautiful
island and hoped to see some of the in
terior.
General Blanco referred to a visit he
paid to the United States when he was
a young man and could speak more
English than he can now, though, as he
said, his great fluency then was prob
ably due to the opportunity he had of
conversing with the handsome Ameri
can women.
To a suggestion by Senator Proctor
that he ought to repeat his visit. Gen
eral Blanco smilingly replied that he
feared he was too old now. The Cap
tain-General thanked the Americans
for calling and said he would return
Senator Proctor's visit upon the return
of the latter from the interior. Thus
ended a pleasant interview.
BIG GUNS FOR THE
AUXILIARY FLEET.
They Are Soon Expected to Arrive
From Washington at the Brook
lyn Navy- Yard.
NEW YORK, March I.â Thirty-two
guns for the auxiliary naval Meet are
expected to arrive from Washington at
the Brooklyn navy-yard before the end
of the week. The commandant's of
fice received official notification of this
fact to-day. The order stated that the
consignment would consist of twenty
two 5-inch and ten 6-inch guns. Men
are at work on the gun carriages upon
which the pieces will be mounted. It
was said at the navy-yard that the
shipment of guns had no connection
with the Maine disaster. It was in
tended to put the torpedo-boat Stiletto
in the stone dry dock to-day to meas
ure her for plans to be used in build
ing a new torpedo-boat. This order
from Washington was rescinded, how
ever, and it is said the Stiletto will be
ordered to Key West in a few days.

BRTSTOL, R. 1., March I.â The new
torpedo boat Talbot was put over the
regulation 12- knot course in Narragan
sÂ«'tt Ray to-day for her first trial, and
developed an average speed of 17.5
knots. The trial was made against a
strong head tide and 160 pounds of
steam pressure was kept up during the
trip. The boat will be given another
trial to-morrow, when It is hoped she
will reach her contract speed of 20
knots. If she succeeds the second boat,
the Gwynn, will be sent over the course
Thursday for her first trial trip. While
the trials this week are unofficial, a
number of naval officials were present
to-day and will be here to-morrow and
Thursday.
The third Herreshoff boat Is well
along, and the firm states that if neces
sary she can be made ready for launch

there is no abatement in the prepar
ations to resist the approach of an
enemy from the ocean. The usual vig
ilance is maintained at the forts to
prevent unfriendly or suspicious intru
sion.
The story telegraphed from Wash
ington that Major-General Nelson A.
Miles, commanding the army of the
I'nited States, is on his way to San
Francisco is hardly credited in army
circles of this department. It is thought
that General Miles would not place the
distance of a continent between him
self and the probable scene of active
operations on the Atlantic or the Gulf
at this particular time.
Later dispatches may bring the in
telligence that the commanding gen
eral has gone to New Orleans, Mobile
or Galveston. It is quite natural to
suppose that he would personally sur
vey the exposed coast in that region
of the country.
It is possible that General Miles may
decide to meet some of the department
commanders at St. Louis, Leavenworth
or Chicago, and this may account for
his westward journey. There does not
seem to be anything in the known con
dition of military affairs on the Pa
cific Coast to call the general to San
Francisco. He was here not long
since and carefully inspected the de
fensive works of this harbor. He paid
particular attention to the Lime Point
position on his trip around the bay
and indicated that the work there
should be advanced without delay.
General Shafter, commanding the De
partment of California, was at Bakers
field yesterday. There were no dis
patches at army headquarters to indi
cate that he had journeyed East to
meet General Miles.
Colonel John B. Babcock, adjutant
general of the Department of Califor
nia, remarked yesterday that no offi
cial advices had been received that
General Miles was on his way to this
city.
Among the veterans of the Grand
Army there is a strong sentiment
against, the rfpulcised acceptance of in
demnity for Vh-Tlo^ of the battleship
Maine. There was a regular meeting of
George H. Thomas Post, G. A. R., last
evening. Before the commander called
the comrades to attention there was a
good deal of talk abo-ut the situation in
Cuba.
One veteran remarked: "It makes me
tired to hear this taJk about indemni
ty. I believe the ship was blown up by
the Spanish, and no indemnity in mon
ey can avenge the wrong. It is time
the Spanish were taught a lesson. They
have very little respect for Americans
now, and they will have less when they
hear of our talking indemnity for the
lives of the sailors who were lost on the
Maine. I hay.' been in the navy, served
there, and visited in my time many
Spanish ports. Wherever the Spanish
language is spoken â In Spain, Cuba or
in South American countries â insults
are constantly offered to the American
marine and the American flag. Eng
lishmen and the English flag are not
insulted, but the feeling of hatred to
the Americans is openly expressed."
Another veteran of the Civil War
said: "I believe also that the Spanish
blew up the Maine, and if this is
smoothed over some other dastardly
crime will be perpetrated. I believe
that Congress now understands the
subject and knows the temper of the
Spanish people. The next act of hos
tility upon the part of the Spanish will
be the signal for war. Congress is
getting ready for war. The sentiment
of the country is ready for it. and if
war does come it will be a sorry reck
oning for old Spain. 1 am convinced
that the administration is not e%'ading
the responsibility of the situation. It
is refreshing to know that our Govern
ment is making preparations. Yes, the
President should call for three hundred
thousand men. We have any number
of men fit to command companies, bat
talions, regiments, brigades, divisions
and army corps. This Grand Army
post could supply a splendid lot of of
ficersâmen who have been tested under
fire, and who are capable of command
ing troops in battle. The young men of
the country are ready to march and
fight. It is all right for Congress to go
slow and get everything in good shape
before opening the ball."
The Confederate veterans of the late
war are as patriotic as the Grand
Army men. They do not like the talk
of settling the Maine affair by indem
nity. An officer who served with dis
tinction in the Southern army said in
commenting on the Maine disaster:
"The ex-Confederates are ready to fight
under the old flag. I know of several
who would offer their services should
war be declared. I believed from the
start that the destruction of the ship
was an act of Spanish treachery, and
this outrage may be followed by others
until war will be forced."
The boys of the cadet contingency of
the National Guard are full of the
spirit of American patriotism. Activ
ity in enrollment and drill has been the
order recently. The Hifch School cadets
are getting all the large boys interested
in warlike exercises.

VICTORY FOB FRESHMEN.
Stanford Sophomores Defeated in the
Final Baseball Game.
PALO ALTO, March I.â The final game
of the lnterclass baseball series was
played on the campus to-day by the so
phomore and freshman class nines and
resulted in a victory for the latter team
by a score of 9 to 7. This contest settles
the interclass baseball championship for
the season. The freshmen had an uphill
flght, for the class of '00 was recognized
before this trial as the strongest of all
the- classes In this respect, having among
Its numbers three varsity playersâLoug
heed. Strohn and Beckettâ and several
promising ' candidates for " sweaters.
Costly errors lost the headship in baseball
for the sophomore cli -
The game was interesting, particularly
on account of the intense class feeling
manifested. The adherents of each side
were out in full force and it looked as if
a rush would be started despite the fact
that the university authorities would ex
pel the participants. The freshmen were
most warlike, being supplied with rope
and a full score of tantalizing jibes. One
freshie was even bold enough to wear a
cane, and, strange as it may seem, es
caped unmolested.
The sophomores are glum and irritable
and it is not improbable that there will
be "something doing" yet between the
classes.

CONSIDERED
AS MEASURES
OF EMERGENCY
Significaot Contracts for War
Material in Advance of
the Usual Authority
by Congress.
NEW YORK. March I.â A "Washington special to the Herald says:
The most significant development which has yet transpired in connec
tion with recent war preparations was the award by the War Depart
ment to-day of contracts for a million dollars' worth of projectiles for
the new high-powered guns mounted in onst fortifications.
An lr.usual Nature of the award is *he fact that it has been made
in advance of Congressional authority, and it can therefore be consid
ered in no other light than an emergency step. The contracts, how
ever, have been made contingent upon future appropriations by Con
gress. The War Department felt entirely safe in doing this in view of
the fact that the appropriations committees of both houses have
promised in advance to increase the item in the pending appropriation
bill for ammunition to cover the amounts. Agreements wire entered
into between General Flaglor, chief of ordnance, and C. J. Harraw,
representing the Midvale Steel Works of Philadelphia: C. Y. Wei-lock,
representing the First Sterling Company of Pittsburg. and Judge
Mayer, counsel for the Carpenter Steel Company of Reading, Pa.
The gentlemen came to Washington to-day in response to tele
grams sent them by General Flagler last night. There was little diffi
culty in reaching an agreement. All the firms represented were quite
willing to enter upon the work immediately and to deliver all the shells
called for within the next four or six months. The representatives of
the several firms sent telegraphic instructions to have the work begun
without delay. The million dollars' worth of shells, aggregating about
5000 in all, was divided up among three firms in proportion to trip capa
city for turning out the work within the time required. The Carpen
ter Company, I understand, was given the largest proportion. The
shells are to be of eight, ten and twelve inch calibersâ most of them of
the larger sizes. They are needed for the high-power guns already
mounted in our coast defense batteries. At the present time, it is un
derstood, there are no more than five rounds of ammunition lor each
of the guns already mounted.
The authorities all insist that they are not expecting war. but that
they regard it the part of wise precaution to be fully prepared for it in
case it should come. They feel that the responsibility will be upon
them in case there should be a sudden emergency and no ammunition
on hand for use in guns which have been mounted for the protection of
sea coast cities.
They do not deem it safe to wait for the appropriation bill to bo
come law, and although it is unusual to make contracts without ex
press authority they felt that the responsibility upon them was such as
to justify it, besides the projectiles cannot all be delivered before the
President attaches his signature to the pending appropriation bill, so
that they could cancel the remainder of the contract and still keep
within the appropriation which is already in the pending bill. It is un
derstood that the Ordnance Bureau of the army has also made con
tracts for powder in anticipation of a liberal appropriation for this
purpose by Congress.

BRAUNHART WAS OUT OF ORDER
The Freeholders Wrangled Over the
Civil Service Rules.
Civil service in the new charter was the
subject before the Freeholders last night.
The report of the committee as presented
on civil service was being pushed through
with all possible speed until that portion
which applied to the Fire Department
was reached, when Freeholder Gutte
moved to have it stricken out. This
brought Mr. Clement to his feet in favor
of having it retained, alleging that it
would prevent the bosses from tilling that
branch of the city government with poli
ticians. Mr. Cridgo urged that tho Coun
ty Clerk should also have che appointment
of more than one man of his own selec
tion. At this Senator Braunhart, who had
occupied a seat on the side of the room,
remarked in a loud voice: "Why, you
must be crazy!"
Ex-Mayor Ellert jumped to his feet and
requested the president to call Braunhart
to order for his interference. This Presi
dent Britton did in a sharp manner, say
ing, "It was very improper for a person
not a member to make such a remark."
Braunhart blushed t# the roots of his hair
and said not a word during the entire
evening.
Another flow of oratory' followed when
the Sheriff's office was reached, as the
bookkeeper (meaning Simon) was re
tained, but on a vote tho civil service sec
tions went through as they were drafted.

MAY SOON
INTERVENE
Probable Action to Be
Taken in Reference
to Cuba.
Stand of the President Will Now
Depend Upon the Report of
the Naval Court on the
Maine Disaster.
NEW YORK, March I.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent teleKraphs:
It is not the present intention of the
administration to make any move in
regard to the general Cuban question
until all the facts in regard to the
Maine disaster have been received and
acted upon. This statement was made
to me by a high official of the State
Department in reply to a question as
to numerous reports in circulation
about intervention polities, time limits
given for success of autonomy, etc.
Since the Maine disaster occurred it
has been the purpose of the President
to regard it as an entirely distinct mat
ter from the question as to the atti
tude of the United States toward the
Cuban Insurrection. What the Pres
ident's next step will be depends large
ly on the conditions existing when the
Maine matter is settled. It Is not
true, as reported, that he has served
notice upon Spain that war in Cuba
â¢ end by a specified date. In his
ar.nual message to Congress he care
fully avoiding mentioning any time,
and in notes which have since gone to
the Madrid authorities no specific date
has been named.
In his communication to Congress he
stated that "the near future" would
demonstrate the success or failure of
autonomy.
There is little doubt that the admin
istration now considers it a failure, but
it has not said so officially, either to
Spain or to Congress. Cuban corre
spondence giving reports of consular
officers in Cuba, which will indicate the
failure of autonomy, is to be with
held from Congress until an official re
port has been received regarding the
cause of the Maine disaster.
In editing this correspondence the
State Department authorities have
been careful to strike out any expres
sions of opinion from consular officers
regarding the failure of autonomy, and
H would appear that the adminis
tration is not at the present time pre
pared to officially declare itself in re
gard to the progress of autonomy in
Cuba or its future plans toward
restoring peace in that island.
In his message to Congress ihe Pres
ident said: "Of the untried nn â 'â¢'ires
there remain only: The recognition of
Insurgents as belligerents; the recogni
tion of the independence of Cuba; neu-
tral intervention to end the war by im
posing a rational compromise between
the contestants; and intervention in
favor of one or the other party."
Having stated that he regarded the
recognition of the insurgents as bel
ligerents unde* existing conditions as
Impossible, It is therefore assumed
that the President's next move will be
in the line of one of the three follow
ing propositions. In this connection a
high official of the Government gave
me his views to-day in regard to the
question of neutral intervention and
the way in which he believed it should
be done. His views have the approval
of at least one member of the Cabinet
and have beeu called to the attention
of the President. He said: "It is as-
sumed that the existing conditions will
not be permitted to continue indefinite-
ly in Cuba and that they can be ter
minated only by the active intervention
of the United States. This has been
proposed in but one way â requiring
Spain to desist from further attempt to
subdue the insurrection. I should ap
proach the problem from the other end
and require the insurgents to accept
autonomy; at least to try the experi
ment.
"I should seek the concurrence of
Fpain in this method and insist
upon any modifications of her plan of
autonomy which seem essential to
give Cubans genuine free government.
I should then send a commissioner to
the Cuban camp and say to them in
effect: "This struggle must stop here
and now. We recognize that you have
the right to revolt, but in all this time
you have not established a government,
and considerations of humanity and in-
terests of the United States demand
tl r the struggle should cease. Spain
has admitted the right of sovereignty
and ownership of th- soil, and what she
offers you is a great gain â more than
many revolutions have accomplished;
accfpt it at once and try the experi
ment; we insist on its being fairly
made, and at the worst, after a period
or rest and recuperation, you can, if
driven to it, revolt again; but the
Unitf-d States will not permit you to
continue this attempt longer. '
"The advantages of this method
seem to me to be: First, that it avoids
a war which intervention from the
other end would necessitate, and not
only the frightful losses it would in
volve, unprepared as we are,
but the rankling and permanent
hostility of Spain which a
successful war would bring. Second, it
would give the desired results much
more promptly than the other. Third,
it would raise no question of our being
compelled to take possession of the
Island, which an unqualified success of
the insurrection would undoubtedly do
and which we ought to avoid.
"Finally, to use a homely Illustra
tion, if a man wants to stop a dog
fiarht and can do it much more easily
I and with less risk to himself and equal
benefit to both dogs by making the
' lower one let go and dragging him out,
he will do it. and ought to. It may be
â  said that Spanish pride would not
! brook such interference, but it might
I be well represented to Spain that she
must either accept this and retain
nominal sovereignty, or intervention,
much more humiliating, would involve
; the loss of the island.

WAR MESSAGES SENT
UP INTO THE SKY.
Rockets, Parachutes of Fire and
Colored Lights Used in Suc
cessful Signaling.
NEW YORK. March I.â War signals
flashed over this city last night. Rock
ets, parachutes of fire and colored
lights wrote war messages on the dark
background of the sky. Only to those
initiated were the messages known. A
vast majority who saw the rockets go
up and colored lights float over East
River thought they were merely wit
nessing an interesting exhibition of
fireworks.
The signals were sent up from the
Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the mes
sages they conveyed were read with
ease three miles away. It was the first
experiment with a new code of signals
between ships of war. The present
system consisted of the use of three
arc lamps on the mast of a warship,
and a mile off these lights blend to
gether and render the signals useless.
Therefore a new system was devised.
An order was recently received at the
navy yard to have experiments made
at once in view of the present compli-
cations.
Henry J. Paine, a fireworks maunfao
turer, seven assistants and a party of
naval officers consisting of Commander
W. S. Sherry, Commander W. Swift of
the Bureau of Ordnance, and Lieuten
ant Dougherty began them last night.
Bombs were sent up near the stone
drydock. Each bomb, on going to a
certain height, burst into a parachute
with a string of colored lights hanging
in the air beneath it. These lights
conveyed a message. Commander
Swift, on Blackwells Island, three miles
off, and Lieutenant Dougherty, in Wil
liamsburg, read the message without
difficulty. Message after message was
sent up, the lights and their positions
varying with each one.

We remain firm in the belief that the

CAPTAIN SIGSBEE
WRITES TO HIS WIFE.
Says He Is on Deck in Command and
His Pennant Is Flying From
the Maine.
WASHINGTON, March I.â Mrs. Sigs
bee received a letter to-day from Cap
tain Sigsbce. He writes that he has
recovered from all fatigue and is on
deck in command, and his pennant is
flying from the Maine. He makes no
comments on the disaster, but reiter
ates his great sorrow at the loss of so
many brave men and of his line ship.
He is impatiently awaiting the arrival
of additional clothing sent and news of
his home and family, including his tiny
first grandchild, Anna Louise Kittelle,
who was born one month ago to-day.
Removal of the Wounded.
WASHINGTON, March I.â The only
word received by the Navy Department
from Havana came to-night in the fol
lowing telegram from Captain Sigsbee:
"Bache leaves to-day for Tortugas
with all wounded men now here, five in
all, as follows: Mattison, Cahill, Allen,
Webber and Mack. All able to walk
except Mattison, whose jaw was
broken. Bache- takes one unrecog
nized body. Will probably take four
wounded men from Tortugas to Key
West. Cannot tell when more bodies
may be expected at Key West, but
Bache should promptly return."

TRIBUTE TO
THE HEROES
Memory of the Men Who
Perished on the Maine
to Be Perpetuated.
The Senate Adopts a Resolu
tion Providing for a
Bronze Tablet.
In Touching Language Perkins Spoke
oftho Glory Achieved by Gallant
American TÂ«rs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington/March 1.
Shortly after the Senate convened to
day Perkins of California, of the Com
mittee on NavoJ Affairs, presented a
favorable report on Mr. Bacon's reso
lution providing for the erection in
Statuary Hall of the Capitol of a
bronze memorial tablet commemorative
of the officers and sailors who lost their
lives in the Maine disaster in Havana
harbor. In the course of his report
upon the resolution, Perkins said:
"It is fitting at all times for a na
tion to recognize the heroism of those
who have yielded up their lives in us
service. In this respect no nation is
more generous than ours. It has stood
and still stands ready to show its ap
preciation of bravery and devotion to
duty. It cares for its helpless veter
ans who battled on land and sea; it
strives to mitigate the hardships im
posed on those who were grievously
wounded while fighting for the iiag,
and as far as possible it seeks to aid
the widows and orphans of our dead
soldiers and sailors. But it is not in
battle alone that heroic qualities are
shown; neither is it only in time of
war. Death may come in the perform
ance of duty while peace reigns, as
well as while the conflict rages. But
whether in war or in peace, the soldier
and the sailors stand ever ready to give
thoir lives in the performance of duty,
and when they so die they die like he
roes and deserve well of their coun
try.
"Every man who stood beneath tho
flag of the battle-ship Maine had, by
his very presence on its decks, signified
his willingness ta die for the defense
of the nation and maintenance of the
national honor; He was ever ready to
go where duty called, whether to brave
the tempestuous seas, or to return shot
for shot with his country's enemies.
When death came in the awful shape
it took in the harbor of Havana, the
dead are no less heroes than if they
had fallen before hostile guns. The liv
ing have shown the heroic mold in
which all were cast. If it were ever
fitting to recognize the devotion to the
country of brave men it is now fitting
to erect a tablet in memory of those
who Jost their lives in the destruction
of the Maine. The sailors of the navy
have ever been the pride of the Union;
their heroism has been recognized
throughout the world, and their deeds
have brought forth praises from all
chivalrous people. What the sailors
of the old and glorious fleets of tho
United States have been, that are the
sailors of the new navy of our coun
try. The great disaster at Havana has
shown that there exists the indomita
ble courage, which heretofore has made
our fleets victorious and which is an as
surance that victory will still follow
our flag upon the seas. As our fleets
are strong and our men are brave, so
shall we compel and maintain that re
spect among the nations which is as
necessary to national prosperity as the
respect of his fellows is to the prosper
ity of the individual."
Morrill of Vermont suggested that
Stautuary Hall was scarcely a proper
place to erect the tablet, and Hoar of
Massachusetts thought some other
place for it might better be desig
nated.
The resolution was so amended as to
provide for the erection of the tablet
at some suitable place in the Capitol.
As amended the resolution was
adopted.
FEWER THEORIES
AND MORE FACTS.
Late Caution Sent Out by the Navy
Department as to Talking
About the Disaster.
WASHINGTON', March I.â Fewer
theories and more facts will be the
policy of the Navy Department here
after. This morning Secretary Long
and Assistant Secretary Roosevelt is
sued an order to all Subordinates to re
frain from giving opinions as to the
cause of the Maine explosion. The or
der comes a little late, as nearly every
official from the Secretary to the most
humble member of the construction
corps has bet-n interviewed, but re
cently the opinions of navy officers,
some of whom have no technical knowl
edge, have been given and exploited
in the newspapers, rind have embar
rassed the Secretary. It has not been dif
ficult to get an "official opinion" to suit
any theory, so many and varied were
the private Views entertained. The
same caution h;is been sent to Havana,
warning all who have an official con
nection with the i'.nard of Inquiry to
refrain from advancing views or theo
ries.
VARIED TESTIMONY
IS FRFELY OFFERED.
Cubans at Havana Anxious to Show
That Spaniards Blew Up
the Maine.
KEY WEST, Flu.. March I.â A cor
respondent placed before the court of
inquiry to-day a letter signed "Mau
quinista" (machinist), Riving alleged
details of the filing of the Maine's tor
pedq holes with dynamite cartridges
and their subsequ. ;ii explosion by elec
tric wires. The member of the court in
question paid neither the letter nor its
developments had been officially be
fore the court. The Cubans here are
constantly receiving mysterious mis
sives from Havana, purporting to re
veal the methods by which the Maine
was sent to destruction, but as there
are as many suggestions or theories as
there are letters little reliance can be
placed upon any.
The general situation here remains
the same. The fleet has not moved,
though there are signs of activity
which give rise to a rumor that an im
portant naval step is contemplated.
Admiral Sicard, when questioned on
this point this afternoon, merely r.e
iterated his remark of yesterday:
"There is r.o movement to-day. The
ships have steam up always, and they
can go anywhere."
The tugboat Merrltt passed here at
sunset with a large scow in tow and
other wrecking apparatus. She is
bound for Havana.
The report that the remains of a sub
marine mine, alleged to have been
raised by the Unito.l States naval cliv
ers at Havana with the electrical wires
in which they had been entangled, were
brought here on Sunday by the
Mangrove, and are now in the ware
house of the lighthouse department, is
denied in high official quarters.
Captain Merritt, who is in charge of
the artillery here, expected General
Merritt to-day by the Mascot, but
General Merritt did not. arrive.
APPROPRIATIONS FOR
WAR PREPARATIONS
The House Naval Affairs Committee
Agrees Upon a Million for
Smokeless Powder.
WASHINGTON, March 1. â The
House Committtee on Naval Affairs
this afternoon agreed on items of
$1,000,000 for the purchase of smokeless
powder; $92,000 for erection of build
ings on Government ground for the
manufacture of smokeless powder, with
the necessary machinery and equip
ment, and $60,000 for arming and equip
ping the naval militia. The latter item
is an increase of $10,000 over the esti
mates of Secretary Long, and provides
for the arms, accouterments, signal
outfits, boats and their equipments and
the printing of the necesssary books of
instruction for the naval, militia of the
several States, under the Naval De
partment regulations. The item for
the purchase of smokeless powder is
identical with the estimate. Several
other items of less importance also
were passed on.
GREAT FUNERAL
DEMONSTRATION
Appropriate Obsequies to
Be Held on Ameri-
can Soil.
Due Naval and Military Hon
ors to Be Accorded the
Victims of the Maine.
Survivors of the Horror in Havana
Harbor to Act as a Special
Guard of Honor.
Copyrighted, 189S, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, March I.â There will be
another great funeral demonstration in
honor of the Maine's dead. This time
it will be on American soil at Key West
and will probably occur on Thursday.
The uncertainty as to the date Is due
to the fact that it is not known just
When the coast survey vessel Bachewill
arrive here with the bodies of the
Maine's victims which have been re
ceived. The order went into effect yes
terday to transport to this country all
j the dead received hereafter. The Bache
will probably be at Dry Tortugas with
the rest of the wounded men from the
i Havana hospital, and Captain For
| syth, commanding the station at Key
West, does not expect her to reach here
before Thursday morning. The details
of the funeral arrangements have been
placed in the hands of Captain Bow
man H. McCalla of the cruiser Marble
! head.
As it is not yet known how many
bodies will be brought on the Bache
I Commander McCalla has engaged all
! the hearses available in this island and
i in addition provision has been made for
I a number of wagons, which are being
appropriately draped as improvised
hearses.
The Maine's heroes are to be buried
here with full military and naval hon
ors. I learned from Captain Forsyth
that six or eight companies of blue
jackets and probably two companies of
marines will be disembarked from the
fleet to act as a guard of honor, and
: two companies of artillery from the
! Key West garrison will represent the
army. The survivors of the Maine,
! officers and men, will walk on either
! side of the hearses as special guards
â  of honor, and a representation from an
unusually large number of naval offi
cers.
This party will accompany the cor
tege either in carriages or on foot. The
usual funeral volley will be fired after
! the interment on plats selected for the
purpose in Key West Cemetery.
It is not believed here that there is
\ any truth whatever in a sensational re
' port published in New York this morn
ing that the Spanish authorities have
forbidden further work on the Maine
wreck until the report of the Naval
! Court of Inquiry has been made known
jto the Spanish Government. I can
say of my own knowledge that up to
3 o'clock yesterday afternoon work on
the Maine was progressing as usual
without the slightest sign of Spanish
interference.
Both Admiral Sicard and Captain
Forsyth laughed at the report when
called to their attention to-day, and
I Captain Forsyth added that if it had
| any truth whatever he would certain
: ly have been notified by Captain Sigs
bee or Consul-Genera! Lee.
The convalescents of the Maine now
in the Marine Hospital are doing well.
i Two of them were doing so well last
i night, in fact, that they escaped the
vigilance of the doctors and nurses
â  and started out for a look through Key
i West streets. They were discovered
\ and taken under arrest to the marine
barracks, where, after being roundly
i lectured and threatened a court-martial
! if the offense is repeated, they were re
turned to the hospital to sleep it off.

"THINGS
GROWING
QUIETER."
Individual Opinion of SeG a
retary Long as to
the Disaster.
However, It Is Evident That
No Interference on the Part
of Spain Concerning the
Maine Will Be Tolerated.
NEW YORK, March I.â The
Herald's Washington correspond
ent telegraphs: "It seems to me
that things are growing quieter.
At any rate, the element of offi
cial participation of the Spanish
Government in the blowing up
of the Maine is practically elim
inated."
This statement was made by Secre
tary Long after the Cabinet meeting
to-day, but with the distinct under
standing that it was simply an Individ
ual expressic-n of opinion and had no
reference to the views of the President.
The Secretary told me he based his
opinion upon the disclaimers made by
the Spanish Government that there
were no mines or torpedoes located in
the harbor of Havana, and that the
Maine could not therefore have been
destroyed through any such agency.
The opinion held by Secretary Long
is shared by other members of Presi
dent McKinley's Cabinet with whom I
talked. The Maine disaster was a pro
lific topic of discussion at the Cabinet
meeting to-day. The authorities con
fess that they have no information oth
er than that which is in the possession
of the public, and that they are await
ing the report of the Court of Inquiry
which is investigating the matter be
fore taking any steps.
There has been some discussion
among the members as to the course
which this Government shall pursue in
case the report of the court should de
clare that the Maine was destroyed by
an external force. The President is
naturally anxious that any motion that
may be taken shall follow close upon
the submission of the court's report,
and he desires in so acting to occupy
an impregnable position from the point
of Justice and international law which
will place the United States in the right
in the eyes of the civilized world.
From an administration point of view
it is asserted that while- the President's
course in case the Maine disaster
should prove to have been due to de
sign has not yet been definitely deter
mined upon, and if it were that it could
not be divulged, it will be such as to
win the warm approval of the entire
country. Although the Maine is at the
bottom of the sea, the American flag
and the pennant of her commanding
officer are still flying and she is there
fore American territory just as much
as the battleship lowa is American ter
ritory. This statement was made to
me by the official in answer as to my
question as to the reports that Spain
would decline to allow the removal of
the wreck. The reason why the de
partment has not ordered Captain S. D.
Sigsbee to return to the United States
is that his detachment from the Maine
would show that this Government
merely regarded the Maine as a wreck
and not as a ship of the United States
navy, which would injure any claim for
reparation that this Government may
make in the future.
The administration does not believe
that the Spanish will interfere in any
way with the removal of the equip
ments of the hull of the Maine, and if
it should, such action will call for a
sharp protest.
As far as the intelligence officers of I
the War and Navy departments are j
concerned the disclaimer made by Se
nor DuÃosc that no mines are in the !
harbor of Havana is correct. It is !
known, however, that Spain some time
ago made preparations for placing
mines in the harbor of Havana, and j
went so far as to contract for and re- j
ceive ninety tons of high explosives for !
torpedoes and mines. In the absence I
of official information from sources in |
Spain and Cuba the administration ac
cepts the statement made by Spain that
the harbor of Havana is free from
mines and torpedoes, and to this state- '
ment may be credited the belief of the j
officials that the condition of affairs is !
likely to improve as time goes on. The |
Court of Inquiry will return to Havana
on the lighthouse tender Mangrove. |
Secretary Long said that the fact that
the Mangrove would be used for thia
purpose indicated that no man-of-war
would be sent to Havana for the pres
ent.
As showing the friendly feeling of i
Spanish Officers for the United States j
and the sympathy they felt for this j
Government in the loss of the Maine,
this letter received by Lieutenant Al- j
exander Sharp Jr., naval aide to As- !
sistant Secretary Roosevelt, from Lieu- :
tenant Albert Cleaves, commanding
the Cushing, is of interest.
Captain of the torpedo boat Cushingâ
Sir: In the name of my officers and men.
deeply affected by the catastrophe to your
armored cruiser Maine, I have the honor
to send you and your officers and men the
expression of our true condolence. Yours
sincerely, JUAN DE.CARRAUSA,
Lieutenant First Class in Command H. C. i
M. Gunboat Diego Velasquez.
It was settled to-day that there is to :
be no action by Congres on the emer
gency bill transmitted to Chairman !
Boutelle of the House Naval Commit
tee unless it shouJd appear that war is i
much more probable than it now ap
pears.
The first meeting of the Naval Com
mittee since that letter was received j
was held to-day. Boutelle gave the
other members of the committee his
views on the subject and no one pres- ]
ent opposed them. The committee the^t
took up the regular annual naval ap
propriation bill and began its first con
sideration in the full committee. When
this bill is reported to the House it will
carry the provision for additional en
listments asked for by the department.
Should the Secretary of the Navy in
the meantime consider that extraor
dinary precautions for an emergency
are required he will be supported by
the naval committees and by both
houses of Congress, if he quietly antici
pates action on the annual appropria
tion bill and enlists the men he re
quires for immediate service. As a
matter of fact the legal limit has al
ready been exceeded to a slight extent,
so as to have enough men to put the
Miantonomoh and Katahdin in com
mission without making it necessary to
place any other vessels out of service.
HEARD THE CRUEL
TALK OF SPANIARDS.
Just Before the Maine Disaster One
Fiend Said the Sailors Would
Soon Be in Hell.
NEW YORK. March I.â A Ports
mouth (Va.) special to the Herald says:
Walter J. Holland, representing a firm
of commission merchants at Chicago,
was in Portsmouth to-day. Knowing
that for several years past he traveled
in Spanish-speaking countries a corre
spondent sought him out. and was in
formed that he was in Havana on the
night of February 15, -and from the
dock witnessed the explosion of the
Maine. Holland said:
"Just before the awful dull roar fol
lowed by two sharp detonations I heard
one Spaniard remark to another, 'In
two minutes all of the Maine's crew
will be in hell.' The scoffing and laugh
ing among the rabble while our poor
sailors were struggling in the water
was horrible to my ears. The next
morning I heard a burly Spaniard
curse at an American lady, but to
have interfered would have precipi
tated trouble of perhaps a serious na
ture. The Maine disaster ended my
trade in Havana, my old patrons re
fusing to patronize an American
house."
Mr. Holland is satisfied from the re
mark he had heard and the air of ex
pectancy that seemed to surround
many Spaniards that they were not
surprised by the destruction of the
Maine and really expected it. He took
the Washington steamer last night. He
positively refused to state the nature
of his business at the nation's capital,
or to say whether he would see the
President or Secretary of the Navy. He
speaks Spanish fluently.
To Open Subscription List.
NEW YORK, March I.â Admiral
Bunce, commandant at *he navy-yard,
received permission from Washington
to-day to open a subscription list at
the navy-yard for the benefit of the
families of the men killed by_the ex
plosion on the Maine. The list was
posted at once.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. March Lâ No more thor
ough and graphic expose of the meth
ods of the local political gang was ever
made than that embodied in an address
delivered before the Pastors' Union of
this city by Dr. H. J. B. Wright. His
object was to enlighten the clergymen
of this city concerning the political deg
radation that the -gang" has brought
upon fair San J^v and to suggest a (
method for its eradication. The mm- i
isters present when this address was
delivered represented nearly every
Protestant church In the city, and the ;
effect of this talk will undoubtedly be
felt in the election of April 11. Dr.
Wright began as follows:
Perhaps no city in the United States
the size of San Jose has fewer elective
offices. Under tne former charter there
were twenty-four elective officers, under
the present charter the number is re
duced to eight. From this it will be seen
that great responsibility is to be placed
upon a few men. and with this responsi
bility greater power.
Referring to the framers of the char
ter and present political conditions, he
said:
They knew ''the sections in San Jose
have "resulted in the selection of ouieers
who at the time of their election tjtlievvd.
or soon after learned that their duty was
to promote the welfare of a few political
bosses rather than promote the welfare
of the city of San Jose: ,
I hope to be able to show you that the
city of San Josh is in the grasp Of one of
the most complete, powerful and danger
ous gangs of political tricksters that ever
seized the throat Of any municipality, in
saving this I do not wish to be under
stood as saying that, every otflcer in the
cltv of San Juse is under the Influence
of 'the bosses. But gang rule has been
for years past and is now the only rule
by which the affairs of the city are man
aged, by Which the citizens of San Jose
are disgraced, abused. insulted and
robbed by a gang of political bosses.
â  Much if not all of this unfortunate con
dition may be corrected by the citizens
of thin city at the next election by
ing themselves of the opportunity offered
by the new charter, and when this is
accomplished, and not until taen, â will
they be permitted to enjoy the benefits
flowing from an economical, self-respect
ing business-like and patriotic adminis
tration of the affairs of this mnuicipality.
Let me call your attention to a few
facts which show beyond cavil the truth
fulness of my statement. A gentleman
who was building a house in a street
where there was no sewer wishing to
have sewer connection requested the
Mayor to have a sewer built from a
cross street, about 100 feet away, to the
point where he was building his house.
The Mayor, very properly, referred him
to the Councilman who is chairman of
the sewer committee.
J P. Fay is the chairman of this com
mittee, and is well known to be com
pletely under the domination of the
gang. Continuing, Dr. Wright said:
This Councilman at once referred him to
a certain private citizen whose office is
not on South First street and who is not
a member of the Common Council, saying,
"Whatever ha Bays about it will be satis
factory to me."
"Jim" Rea's office is "not on South
First street;" It is on North First
street.
This gentleman went to this- boss, and
told him what he -wanted, and this boss
said; "My friend, ilr..M. is in the ad- |
joining room; go in and see him. He |
knows more about these things than I do.
Whatever will be satisfactory' to him will
be satisfactory to me."
This subordinate boss asked my friend
many questions, and then said: "That will
be all right. We'll have your sewer made
for you, but we can't do it for two or
three weeks yet. Of course, if we should
need your help at any time, wÂ© should ex
pect you to stand in with us."
In due time the sewer was made, agree
able to the promise of this man who is
not a member of the Common Council, but
who controls the Common Council.
Think of the confidence a citizen has in
his power to make the Council do what he
bids it do when he says: "We will make
the sewer for you, according to your re
quest, but we can't do it for two or three
weeks yet." And think of the weakness
and audacity of a Councilman who will
refer a citizen of this city to a political
boss when that citizen comes to a Coun
cilman asking him to build a few feet of
sewer, at the same time saying: "What
ever is satisfactory to the boss will be
satisfactory to me."
Our schools are nominally under the
control of the Board of Education, and I
am willing to concede that this board
would like to have our schools good and
efficient. But there is a pall of mysteri
ous power which covers thÂ»-m, and, I
fear, sometimes makes cowards of them
all. So completely is the Board of Edu
cation under the influence of a certain
man, known as our political boss, that
I assert, without fear of successful con
tradiction, that the Board of Education
will not. under any circumstances, ap
point to, or remove from, our schools any
teacher, without the consent of the boss.
To show how shamefully true this
Is, I will relate what a gentleman told
meâ a gentleman whose veracity is be
yond question. He said: "A friend of
mine, living East, who had long taught
in a normal school, wished to remove to
San Jose and become a teacher in ou,r
schools. I interviewed one of the mem
bers of the Board of Education and told
him of my friend's qualification. There
upon this member said: "You are wast
ing time talking to me. Go and see the
boss. Whatever he says, goes with me."
I went to see a second member, who said:
"Go and see the boss. Whatever he says
â will fie agrer-ablo to me." I went to see
a third member, who said: "I can make
no promise until I have a talk with the
boys. Why don't you go and see the
bosB?" I went to see the boss, but noth
ing ever came of it.
A certain minister, who was once pastor
Of a flourishing church in this city, went
to each of the eight members of the
Board of Education interceding for a
young woman who wished to secure the
position of teacher in our public schools.
Not securing satisfactory promises from
any of these gentlemen, and having told
some of his friends what poor results he
had had, they said: "Why don't you go
and see the boss?" . And he went to see
the boss, and the boss said: "That will
be all right. Your young lady shall have.
a place." And in due time the young lady
was appointed, and is now a teacher in
our schools.
It does not mitigate the wrong to say
that the young lady was competent and
the request . aa an honorable one, for the
whole transaction shows how shamefully
subservient the Board of Education is to
one man who is not on the Board of fc,a-
ucation. , ...
The Superintendent of our schools is lit
tle more than a figurehead. I say this I
without intending to discredit him, for he j
cannot remove or change a teacher or in |
any way control a teacher.
An ex-Councilman told me that when
on the Council he learned that the man
holes for our sewers could be bought for
$6 60, and that they were being bought for
such a price by other cities, while the city
of San Jose was paying $15 apiece for
them. H<- called the attention of the
Council to that fact, and made a motion
that bids be advertised for to furnish
these devices, and his motion prevailed,
all the Councilmen voting for it. In due
time bids were received from several par- .
ties, and he knew that some of the bids
were very low.
When the bids were about to be opened
a certain Councilman arose and said: "if i
it please your Honor, when I voted for the !
motion calling /or bids to furnish these
manholes It escaped my memory that 1,
as one of the Sewer Committee, had let
the contract to a certain foundry in this
city for $15 apiece, the manholes to be fur- I
nished at such times and in such quanti
ties as may be needed. I therefore move
that these bids be not opened." Every
Councilman but one voted for the motion,
and the Council continues. to pay $15 for a
device which can be bought for $6 50. And
bear in rriind that the foundry receiving
this contract is owned largely, if not en- '
tirely, by one of our city bosses.
The Councilman who arrogated to
himself the letting of this extortionate
contract is William T. Nolting. The
firm to which It was let is the San
Jose Foundry, of which Andrew S.
Mackenzie is manager. Andrew is a
brother of Johnnie Mackenzie, and the
latter is the chief lieutenant of "Jim"
Rea.
Under the old charter the policemen
were annually in danger of being dropped
from the police force. This danger oper
ated against efficient service, because the
criminals use their influence tri have them
dropped from. the. police force.
A policeman! told me that there is a
saloon in this city, in connection with
which then: is a room the walls of which
are filled with sawdust, so that sounds
cannot be transmitted through them. Tn
this room nightly * gather . disreputable
characters of both sexes, who sing and
drink and dance until late hours of the
night. A telephone with a large receiver
transmits their ribald songs and vulgar
Conversation tofriends in remote parts of
the city. He further informed that he
dare not enforce the ordinance against
this place, for if he did he would lose
his position on the police force. .
Under the new charter policemen will
hold their positions during efficiency and
good behavior, and policemen cannot be
discharged for having done their duty.
Do you ask how all the imposition and
interference and subserviency and thiev
ery can be enforced by a few political
ringstc-rs? I answer, the leaders in this
disgraceful movement make a study of
the situation; they make a study of
municipal politics. "While you and I are
attending to the business of our live.-,,
these men are intriguing and devising
means by which to spread a net In which
to catch the politically unwary..
After 'relating in detail how primar
ies are controlled, conventions are
packed and a boss ticket forced upon
the voters, he called attention to how
all this is prevented by the provisions
of the new charter, which provides for
all nominations for the coming election
being made by petition.. He also laid
stress on the importance of electing the
right kind of men as members of the
Appointing Board, and the necessity of
electing a strong and honest man to
fill the Mayor's chair. Commenting
on the result of electing gang men to
these offices he said: .
In that event our city will be plunged
into a gulf of political scheming and cor
ruption from which it can never escape
until the citizens adopt another charter.
Suppose on the other hand that at the
next election^ we elect a man to the
mayoralty who believes that . the city s
interests are paramount to any individ
ual's, and that they elect an appointing
board which will appoint honest, indus
trious, pelf-respecting:, intelligent and
conscientious men to the various official
boards, then the city will be assured of
an intelligent, economical, wise, humane
and respectable administration. Then.
l and not until then, will our fair city re-
I ceive what it pays for and pay for what
! it receives. Then, and not until then, will
our citizens be able to speak with pride
i of our municipal affairs.
j If the political ringsters succeed in dl-
I viding our efforts and scattering our j
I votes the ring will succeed and we will j
The new Charter Club is composed of I
S Democrats, Republicans and Populists, of j
Protestants and Catholics. It is com
j posed of men living in all parts of the
I city, who are engaged in all kinds or
' reputable businessâ lawyers, physicians.
I schoolteachers, bankers, carpenters, sur
! veyors, salesmen, shoemakers, merchants,
farmers, orchardists, all of whom have
pledged themselves to do all they can to
elect men to office who are opposed to
bosses and bossiflm, and Who believe that
the only kind of men who ought to hold i
office in the city of San Jose are those !
who believe the city's interests are al- j
ways paramount to any individual's, and
that the city's affairs should be conducted
on business principles and not on political
principles.
He referred to the ticket of the New
Charter Club being beyond reproach,
and added:
All of them are anti-gang; all of them
are sworn enemies of bossism.
In uttering a caution against the
methods of the gang he said:
All sorts of falsehoods and misrepre
sentations will be hurled against this
ticket by the enemies of municipal re
form" schemes will be put on foot which
will be so plausible that they will de
ceive the very elect: religious, and politi
cal prejudices will be marshaled against
the ticket with all the cunning of Satan
himself. Other tickets will be put in the
Held with the sanguine expectation of
dividing the votes of the unsophisticated
but order-loving people.
Let us remember that the New Char
ter Club represents the wisdom of a large
number of San Jose's best citizens, and
that In working for that ticket, talking
for that ticket, voting for that ticket and
forsaking all others, we will be doing
good service for our fair city, and that
casting our votes for other tickets will
certainly result in continuing in office
political rlngsters and municipal cormor
ants. â

Scandal Attending the Sale of

Disgraceful Manner of Removing the

Graveyard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March I.â Truth to-day, as a
sequel to thÂ© request made that its editor
take steps to expose an alleged scandal
in regard to the sale of the American
Cemetery at Jerusalem by the American
Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions,
"The American missionaries and the
American Consul were represented. The
bodies were reverently exhumed and were
removed. But the action of Lord Salisbury
in having the pit in the English Cemetery
In which they were reburied opened in or
der to recover the remains of an English
officer led to the ghastly discovery that
all the bodies had boon broken up and
packed in small wooden boxes, so that
neither the body of the officer nor any
other body could be identified. Both the
sale of the cemetery and the removal of
the corpses appear to have, been carried
out in an extremely disgraceful manner."
The sale of the American: Cemetery at
Jerusalem is alteged to have been made in
order to replenish the funds of the Ameri
can Presbyterian Board of Foreign Mis
sions and secrecy, it is added, was ob
served because the same was contrary to
Turkish law.. Friends of Englishmen
whose bodies had been buried there are
said to have protested to the State De
partment at Washington, to the United
States Minister at Constantinople and to
the British Foreign Office. Eventually,
it is added, they asked Truth to investi
gate the matter as they had been unable
to obtain redress.

nace that will produce a temperature of
5000 degrees, or volcanic heat, can stay
at home and make his own gold with
out subjecting himself to the rigors of
Klondike weather. E. C. Bryce, presi
dent and general manager of the Na
tional Metallurgical Company, which
has a plant at Lowe avenue and Thir
ty-ninth street for the purpose of man
ufacturing gold and silver, said to-day ,
that in consequence of having procured |
all rights to their process by patents
applied for all over the world the oper
ations of the company would no longer

Resumed last night, will hereafter be

no reason now why his formula should

That the stockholders in the enter

fact that at a secret meeting Monday
night at which Mr. Bryce submitted
the results of experiments, they unani
mously voted to continue work and
subscribed $20,000 to be used for build

Mr Bryce placed before a representa

resented," said Mr. Bryce. "by report

our affairs, which it would have been
injurious to have given out. For in
stance, the closing down of our plant
in January was published as the col
lapse of the enterprise. The fact is
that in winter time, from lack of roads
and other facilities, we could not ob
tain our supply of antimony from the
mines in Utah. They are situated, in a
wilderness, and the nearest town Is
Manti sixty miles away. We made a
contract with the Higbee-Russell Com

the time for delivery came they failed

Not a Candidate for
the Mayoralty of
San Jose.
Withdraws His Name
Despite His Friends'
Importunities.
No Danger Now of a Split in
the New Charter Club
Forces.
INSURES THEIR SUCCESS.
Entire Ticket Strengthened oy the
Unselfish Action of the
Colonel.
Special DlÃpatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March I.â ln the with
drawal of Colonel A. K. Whitton from,
the field as a candidate for Mayor in j
the coming election, another powerful |
Impetus is given to the cause of good
government as represented by the New
Charter Club ticket.
Long before the ticket of the New
Charter Club was made public the
friends of Colomel Whitt<>n had been
urging him to become a candidate, de
spite his expressed desire to the con
trary. He had consistently, refused to
allow his name to be used in this con- I
nectlon, but his friends were importu
nate to an unusual degree. Since the ;
naming of the New Charter Club ticket j
he has even been appealed to to run as
an independent candidate, but all the
allurements held out to him failed to i
tempt him to do that which would have
worked to the undoubted injury of the
movement for good government. He
realized that in order to give the good
government movement the right kind of
prestige the ticket of the New Charter
Club must be elected as nearly in its
entirety as possible. It was not until |
to-day, however, that he could prevail !
upon his friends to allow him to make
a formal announcement of his with
drawal.
This unselfish and disinterested acr
tion on the part of Colonel Whitton not
only insures the election of the Charter
Club candidate for Mayor, but it will
strengthen the entire ticket of this or
ganization. Had Colonel Whitton run
he would have drawn largely from the
vote that will new go to S. E. Smith.
The fact that Colonel -Whltton's
friends were urging him to become a
candidate for Mayor has been used by
one of the "gang" organs as a pretext
fox stating that there was dissension
in the ranks of the New Charter Club.
The open letter I of Colonel Whitton
gives the best d^nfal to such assertions,
and is another severe blow to the
"gang." His letter is as follows:
San Jose, March 1.
To George M. Bowman, Ralph Lowe and
others: I deem it <lue to the electors of
this city, who have urged me to become
a candidate for Mayer at the coming elec
tion, and more especially to those who
have compliment. -il me by sipninK a pe
tition for such purjM se. to state that I am
not a candidate and withdraw my name
from further consideration. This I do
after a careful review of existing eondi
! tions. I am fully satisfied that the elec
! tors of this city will find among the
I worthy and prominent citizens aspiring
to said office one who will make a faithful
and efficient executive and who will ad
minister municipal affairÃ to the satisfac
tion of the taxpayers and citiiens gener
ally.
I desire to thank my friends for their
manifestations of esteem and confidence,
and may add that I shall always be found
in the ranks with those who are in favor
of clean politics and correct business
methods in the conduct of public affairs.
Respectfully, A. K. WHITTON.
DEATH OF DR. ROGERS,
THE NOTED SCIENTIST.
Occupied the Chair of Astronomy
and Physics at Colby Uni
versity.
WATERVILI.E, M.\, March I.âProfes
sor William A. Rogers of Colby Univer
sity, a scientist of national reputation,
died at 10:30 o'clock this morning. He
had been sick for several, weeks and his
deatn was not unexpected.
Dr. Rogers was born in New London,
Conn., November 13, ]R32. He obtained
his early education at De Ruyter Academy
in De Ruyter, N. Y. He entered Brown
University, graduating there In 1857. In
1870 he was appointed assistant in the ob
servatory of Harvard University and
seven years later was elected assistant
professor of astronomy. In 1886 he was
called to the chair of astronomy and
physics of Colby University.
While at Harvard University Professor
Rogers' special work consisted in locat
ing and mapping all stars down to the
ninth magnitude in the narrow belt a
little north of our zenith. This work he
did under the auspices of the German As
tronomical Society, of which he was a
member. His observations on this work
extended over a period of eleven years
and required fifteen years for their de
duction. He retained" supervision of his
unfinished work at the observatory.

NEW YORK, March I.â The special
train over the Pennsylvania carrying the
reindeer and attendants which were In
tended for the proposed Government re

INTERESTS THE PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST.
Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Forest
Eeserve to Be Created in
California.
WASHINGTON, March I.â The Com
missioner of the General Land Office
has written a letter to the Secretary of
the Interior, urging that a forest re
serve be created embracing the Pine
Mountain region in California. He also
transmits a letter of the California del
egation, requesting that the area about
Zaca Lake be included in the proposed
reservation. Represenative Barlow
suggests that the areas be combined
and made Into one reservation^ to be
known as the "Pine Mountain and Zaca
Lake Forest Reserve." The Commis
sioner says:
"Briefly stated, the principal object
of the reservation is the preservation of
the water supply of that region, which
is of paramount importance over all
other considerations, involving, as it
does, the fruit and agricultural indus
tries estimated at millions of dollars,
actual and prospective. The region to
be reserved is mountainous, and is rep
resented as unsuited for agriculture and
of littie value for pasturage. The im
portance of taking some action to ef
fectually protect the forest and under
growth from fire and the destructive
tendency of sheep grazing in that arid
region are especially emphasized.
"The creation of this forest reserve
meets with my cordial approval, and
in accordance with the petitions pre
sented and the personal representa
tions of Congressman Barlow I
have prepared a proclamation
for the President's signature embrac
ing the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake
region, to be known as the 'Pine Moun
tain and Zaca Lake Forest Reserve.'
The area within the boundaries de
scribed in the proclamation is esti
mated at 1,144,594 acres."-

SAN FRANCISCO'S
LIGHTSHIP A SUCCESS.
Commander Beiter Well Satisfied
With Her Performance on the
Trial Trip.
PORTLAND, Or., March I.â The trial
trip of the United States lightship No. 70
took place to-day and was an unquali
fied success. The ship was taken to
Kalama and back, about ninety miles.
Commander George C. Reiter, U. S. N.,
inspector of the thirteenth lighthouse dis
trict, was on board and was well satisfied
with the performance of the ship. She
will be accepted and sent to her new
station in San Francisco in about a week.
The lightship was built by the Wolff &
Zwicker Iron Works, of this city, at a
contract price of $73,000. She is a com
posite ship, built of heavy steel frame
work covered with a double thickness of
planking, fir and oak. She is 113 feet over
all. thirty feet beam, and draws, when
fully laden, between thirteen and fifteen
feet. She weighs 540 tons.
The lightship will carry four officers
and eight or nine men. The quarters of
the officers and crew are situated between
decks, and are as convenient and cozy as
possible, being provided with everything
required for the comforts of the band of
exiles who moor their bark on the bar.
TEHACHAPI VISITED BY
A SERIOUS BLAZE.
Progress of the Flames Stayed by
Blowing Up Houses With
Dynamite.
TEHACHAPI, March I.â The Little
Pinte Hotel and three adjoining dwellings
were to-night destroyed by fire, which
was caused by the explosion of a lamp in
the office of Dr. Lindsay, located in the
front part of the hotel. When the fire
started the entire town was threatened
with destruction, and several houses were
blown up with giant powder to prevent
the spread of the flames. The wind was
favorable, but the conflagration had to be
fought by the entire male population of
the town, and at one time it was thought
it would be necessary to call upon Mojave
for assistance. Several families have been
rendered destitute by the fire and are
dependent upon their friends for clothing
and shelter. The exact loss is not at
present known, but it will probably ag
gregate $10,000.

Man.
PASADENA. March I.â Elliott Morris,
a young man employed by O. B. Scoville,
was riding his wheel on East Colorado
street to-night. Suddenly a man stepped
from the roadside and made a run for
the wheelman. Before Morris could es
cape he was felled by a series of blows
on the heud. He fell from his wheel and
lay unconscious. When he recovered there
was an ugly gash on the left side of his
forehead and smaller gashes elsewhere
about the scalp. In every case the blows
inflicted were serious ones, from a strong
arm. This is the third case of kind in
two weeks. In no case was robbery com
mitted. The police are mystified.

Result of Official In

Government Commission
Ready to Submit a
Report.
Will Declare the Project for a
Connecting Waterway
Feasible.
WOULD COST $100,000,000
Full Details for the Construction Not |
"Yet Decided Upon by the
Experts.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
NEW YORK, March I.â A corre
spondent of the Herald, writing under
date of February 12, from Rivas, Nicar
agua, says: The Canal Commission
has finished its work on the division
of the canal project between Lake
Nicaragua and the Pacific, and will
cross the lake on the Victoria on a spe
cial trip to-day or to-morrow. The rev
olutionary outbreak delayed the com
mission five days, the Victoria not be
ing available, as the Government was
using the steamer for the transporting
of troops.
The preliminary report on the canal
project could be made, should it ba re
quested, before the end of this session
of Congress. It would state that the
canal is wholly possible, although spe
cific reports as to more important fea
tures could not be made. The cost of
the canal, based on study and observa
tion made up to the present time, Is
reckoned at about $100,000,000.
Arriving at San Carlos, the party
will go down San Juan River as far
as Ochoa, proceeding from this point
into Greytown, over the line of the
canal. The line has been cleared and
well provisioned camps established for
the use of Admiral Walker and his
party. The commission will moke
thorough observations of the topogra
phy of the country generally, as well
as of that immediately concerned in the
canal line.
The committee will leave Rivas thor
oughly familiar with the canal line
from the spot where it leaves Lake
Allajos River to its western terminus
at Brito. Up to the present date the
commission has spent twenty days ">n j
the western division, not including five i
days' delay. The greater part of this '
time, to be sure, has been passed at I
headquarters in Rivas, but many dft,ys i
have been passed at various points
along the line.
Four days were spent at the site of
the proposed dam at La Flor, in a camp â¢
about three miles from Brito. While
camped at La Flor the commission
studied the coast line at Brito. There
is no harbor at Brito. There is merely .
an indentation of the coast line, but the !
construction and maintenance of a I
harbor are not regarded as difficult. On !
this point nearly all experts who have
studied the situation are agreed. The '
details alone remain to be worked out '
and the individual opinions of the com
mission are to be welded into one.
It will not require nearly the time for
the commission to come to a conclusion
in regard to the harbor at Brito that
it will to reach a conclusion as to the
La Flor dam feature of the canal com
pany's project. The Ludlow Commis
sion of 1895 refused to consider a dam
at this point at all, in consequence of
unsatisfactory results of the canal
company's borings, and suggested an
other route for a canal in this vicinity.
It will probably be months before the
commission finishes its discussion of
this feature. The views of the mem
bers vary considerably.
An interesting compromise of the
situation has. been suggested. It would
be to construct two dams, one at La
Flor and one at a point just west of the
Divide, some miles east of La Flor. The
eastern dam would be on higher ground
and about forty feet high. By this com
promise two basins would be created
instead of one, and La Flor dam would
become a much less formidable under
taking. The tax upon its strength and
permeability would be much de
creased.
This suggested compromise, when
fully worked out, may possibly become
the commission's solution of the prob
lem of the western division, should it
develop that it is feasible in all its as
pects, and should no better solution be
found. Final conclusions on this point,
however, as well as on other important
features of the line, will not be reached
until the reports of various parties
which bear so materially upon the
whole canal project have been made.
J. W. G. Walker and his party have
moved their camp from San Pablo on
Lajas, and are now several mile* fur
ther westward, with the canal line be
ing cleared inland from the lake for
about six miles. The party is work
ing under instructions to determine
that the canal line as laid at present
is only a line, and cross sections are be
ing ran 1000 feet on either side of the
line. The canal company's cross sec
tions were run 400 feet. The present
survey will consequently result In a
topographical map showing a 2000-feet
width across the western division, save
in localities were higher land prevail?.
Surveys of the coast line have de
veloped the fact that the shore line of
lower end runs into the lake five miles
farther than the existing map shows it.
In other words the lake at this point
is five miles shorter than it has pre
viously been held to be. Lieutenant
Hanus has also found a thirty-foot
channel running three miles nearer to
the San Juan River entrance at San
Carlos than the present plans or charts
show. This would mean a reduction
of three miles in the amount of drodc:
ing to be done from the river to deep
water In the lake.

SHOT TO SATE
HIS OWN LIFE
Story Which Murderer
Flannelly Will Tell
in Court.
Will Seek to Prove That His
Aged Father Intended to
Kill Him.
Second Day Spent in Selecting Juror*
to Decide the Parricide's
Fate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March I.â Some pro-,
gress was made in the Flannelly mur
der trial to-day. The regular venire
of talesmen was exhausted this after
noon, and Sheriff Lyndon was instruct
ed to summon a special venire. Those
called to the box are closely questioned
by both sides.
Self-defense, with temporary Insan
ity as a secondary consideration, will
be Flannelly's plea for life. It is said
the prisoner will go on the stand and
give his version of the crime. He will
claim that he went to see hfs father to
talk over their difficulties. The father
disliked the defendant's partner in the
dairy business, and had ordered Flan
nelly to vacate the premises. Thi3
was what took the prisoner to his
father's house that night. The elder
Flannelly refused to listen to his son
and ordered him from his house. The
defendant stopped to argue the matter
with his father, and the latter made
a motion as if to get a revolver from
under his pillow. Flannelly thought
his father, who was in a rage, would
shoot him, and to protect his own life
he shot. This he repeated twice more,
all the bullets entering the victim's
head. Flannelly then walked down
stairs and mounted his horse and rode
to the ranch. There Sheriff McEvoy
found him in bed, and in an attempt
to arrest him that officer was killed.
In the afternoon the monotony of the
questioning was broken by an objection
made by Sheriff Lyndon securing the
special venire of talesmen. The Coro
ner was also objected id. Constable Ed
Haley was suggested, but Flannelly's
attorneys made a vigorous protest. The
attorneys for the defense were then
informed that they would have to file
an affidavit in support of their objec
tion to Constable Haley. This they
proceeded to do. It was alleged that
the Constable was greatly prejudiced
against the defendant, and about a
month ago called him a vile name and
paid he ought to hang. Finally Police
Officer John Haley was agreed upon
as an elisor to select the venire.
Six jurors were sworn to-day, mak
ing nine in all. Those thus far selected
to try the case are: W. P. Eitel. Frank
Armstrong, Fred Krumb, A. Barker,
John F. Barry, C. C. Smith, Levi May
ock, S. F. Patton and William Buckley.

the case of. a man who gained forty
pounds in a month, and then in a week

he was back to within ten pounds of hia
original weight. Then he began to
build up again, and has since then
added another fifteen pounds to his*
avoirdupois. The question is, How much
is he now ahead ? All this occurred in
a trifle over two months. It is an in*
stance of a man who was a weak mortal,
and who was getting more and more
discontented every day, and he had
wasted away in various ways till he was
almost a skeleton. Nothing that he took
in the way of eating seemed to do hint
any good. However, one day he was
reading in a local magazine an article
on the Hudson Medical Institute, and he
went there for a consultation. He was
very debililated and unable to perform
certain of life's functions in a satisfactory
way. He , was given the "Hudyan"
treatment, and so rapidly did his system
respond to its grand influence that he
actually gained at the rate of ten or
more pounds a week. This was too
sudden a change, though, and he was
permitted to lose some of his weight
again. He is now strong and robust

3^ed -Edwards- put. a bullet through thâ¬
; bfain.-pf' Charles Hendricks this, rnorn
[ ing and ilfieii" kill-ed himself. The two
-mci *yere' neighbors.. Hendrifcks was. a
'milkman. and Edwards raised vegeta
bles and chickens for. a living;. They
â¢vjiyed on the eastern border of the city.
Kit the month of Enis Creek, the orig
| inal'site c-f the Puget. Sound Co-opera
! tive Colony.- Their houses were only
i about 200. feet apart, between -which
rippled the â â  sparkling, little creek,
: spanned by a foot bridge.
â  'â â  Edwards was a bachelor, living
! alone. : 'Hendricks and his wife lived
east of- the bridge. They employed a
boy to assist around the house. At the
.time of the tragedy a Mr. Burns was
temporarily stopping- with them. A
â friend/ Mrs. Berts, also happened to
be in the house at the time.
For over, a year there had existed an
ugly feeling- between Edwards, and
Hendricks. Both were extremely irri
table. Hendricks was regarded as a
â  hard man to get along with. Dp to
this occurrence Edwards was looked
upon as a good-natured sort of a
crank. Lately they had had some hot
words about a chicken coop. A wide
.area of- open common lies around the
two houses. Hendricks insisted on
building a coop on ground that Ed
wards-considered he had first call on.
.ricks claimed an equal right tc
use it. Edwards was downtown yester
day, and tried to have the owners of
the open ground stop Hendricks from
erecting the coop on it. He made a re
mark to Tom Meagher that he "sup
posed nothing but cold lead would set
tle the business between Hendricks and
me." â "%Â£Â§
He got no satisfaction and evidently
became crazed by his supposed wrongs.
Early this morning Hendricks, Mrs.
Roberts and Burns were all in the
house talking, Mrs. Hendricks being at
the cow stable. Hendricks went out tc
prepare for his morning delivery oi
milk. He had hardly got outside when
those in the house heard the report oi
a rifle. Burns looked out of the win
dow and saw a body lying on the foot
of the bridge.
He crossed over the bridge past the
body to where the hired boy was hitch
ing the- horses and told him to go for
Dr. McGeorge, the Coroner, and then
returned to the house and waited, leav
ing the body remain on the bridge as it
fell. Dr. McGeorge arrived in about
forty-five minutes. As he passed Ed
wards' house Edwards put his -head
out of an upper window and said:
"Good -by, Doc; I'm going by the
same road."
Dr. McGeorge told him to behave
himself and let him in. but Edwards
disappeared. Dr. McGeorge passed on
and had about reached the body of
Hendricks when he heard the report of
a gun. Later Edwards' body was found
on the third floor of his building. He
had placed the muzzle of the gun in
his mouth and pulled the trigger. Three
notes were found near his body as fol
lows :
â¢'The dirt he broke the window with
at i> o'clock la
;. "Sonr I leave her alive. The shell I
leave to her as a keepsake."
i "I take' my dose mixed â two kinds."
j The first referred to a lump of dry
i mud which had clearly been thrown
. lately through hi? window. The .
â¢shows that he intended to shoot M-. I
â Hendricks also and had waited until the
arrival of McG^nrge in ihe hope of
setting, a shot at her before killing
himself. The third is explained by tht
presence at a paper which had con
tained strychnine, and stating that he
! had taken a dose of it before shooting
: himself .
â .Edwards was an Englishman by
birth, coming here b 7 from Toronto.
". Hendricks i.= -thought to have been a
â  native of Ca n He lived at
Baker City. : Or., several years before
moving here.
â The bullet', entered Hendricks' head
just above the left eye. He was in
stantly killed. The riflÂ° used by Ed
wards was an old-fashioned Spencer
carbine.

Los Angeles Syndicated

Attacks the Committee Report
on Sources of Water
Supply.
Frantic Attempt to Deceive the Peo

Corporation.
Special Dispatch to The Can.
LOS ANGELES, March I.â As was
expected, the Two papers In the local
daily press syndicate which are actu
ally owned in the interest of the Los
: Angeles City Water Company, came
; forth to-day in bitter denunciation of j
the report of the Council committee on ]
I mountain water supply. The papers |
i referred to were the Herald and Ex
! press. Each fell over itself in an en
deavor to show its complete subserv
iency to the water company. The mem
bers of the committee were denounced
I and the plans to procure a source of
pure mountain water supply which it
suggested as possible were ridiculed.
The Herald editorial was denounced on
all sides, while the committee's report
was generally approved by the people j
' who have read it. The Express did not
even present the report to its readers
j in full, but printed only a brief and
! garbled summary-.
The truth is that for some years past
it has been generally admitted that
for domestic use Los Angeles must
I have a source of mountain water. The i
! water from the river is neither desir
| able nor healthful, and there is no way
I by which sufficient pressure can be ob
| tamed for fire purposes. "With this
! pressure enough money would be saved
I to the people to pay the interest on
51,000,000 annually. The report of the
committee demonstrates the uttÂ«r and
j complete independence of the city from t
j the water company to establish munici- i
| pal operation of the plant.
It can get pure mountain water j
I cheaper than it can stand by and be j
! robbed for the benefit of the stock- |
I holders of the City Water Company. In |
i the Crystal Springs litigation now pend- j
t ing the city can lose the case and still ;
j furnish the rate-payers pure mountain j
i water for a less sum than that at which â 
1 the company values its alleged Crystal :
j Springs water rights.
The city can proceed now with its i
! plans for municipal operation and leave ;
| the buncombe litigation the water com- !
' pany has caused to be instituted to be j
! settled in J.he courts at the leisure of j
! the Judges. If a decision does not j
I come for ten years it will not make any j
; difference to municipal operation. The t
i committee reported and based all of j
1 its calculations on paying the water j
I company the full value of its improve- j
i ments to the city's plant. The amount |
! was fixed by the City Engineer at f
; 51.192.000. The water company organs
talk about a price higher than this fig
! ure being paid by the city. They talk
as though the entire water of the Los
Angeles River, which belongs to the
; city, will go to waste if the municipal- |
| ity were to procure a source of maun- j
! tain supply for domestic purposes. This
â¢ will not be the case. The city can sell
; every inch of water in the river for ir-
r igation to holders of property east and
I south of the city.
From the sale of this water a very
I considerable revenue would be derived j
I and the people of Los Angeles would !
j have what they badly need, pure and j
j healthy water to drink. The business
! of selling pure drinking water in wag
j ons would be at an end and a big sav
i ing would be made to taxpayers in that j
way. -
The adoption of the committee's re
! port in the Council by a vote of four
! Democrats and four Republicans, and
! with but one dissenting vote, shows
I that the report was one which Coun
| cilmen clearly recognized they could not ,
! vote against.
Of course it is a severe and well de- :
1 livered blow to the water monopoly,
and the Herald and Express of the
syndicated press come to the defense j
of the monopoly's interest by assailing t
j the report. It is in line with the es- I
tablished policy of both. But by The
Call the people of Los Angeles have
j been supplied with necessary informa
! tion, and they are aware of the mo- !
i tives that impel the editorial policy of (
! these journals.

other Southern Republican is alleged to
have paid the penalty for accepting a
postoffice, and this time, contrary to
precedent, the victim is a -white man.
Postmaster-General Gary at to-day's
meeting of the Cabinet discloses the
story.
J. R. Freeman was appointed Post
master at Ada. in I kHAetj County.
Georgia, near the Florida line, on Feb
ruary 12. upon the recommendation of
postal referees of Georgia upder this
administration. He sras reported to be
a competent man for the place in every
respect. No efwnplaint was made
against him to the department.
News of the assassination of Free
' man came to Postmas;- r-General Gary
through a letter from his widow. This
was brought to the attention of the
Cabinet to-day. She charged that
those who did not want Freeman to
have the office killed him. Upon re
ceiving the appointment, the letter
says. Mr. Freeman obtained the signa
tures of several neighbors to his b". -r.d.
Not the slightest difficulty was experi
enced In getting severai citizens to be
came his sureties, but a day or two
later th^se citizens asked' him to re
â¢ lease them. According to Mrs. Free
man, er.emies of her husband had in
duced them to withdraw, hoping in this
v.;..y to prevent Mr. Freeman from
qualifying for office.
"Without much difficulty, however,
the appointee obtained signatures to i
another bond. He was killed the night
after he had done so, the letter says.
He had just entered the yard in front
â¢if his house at dusk, when he was shot
by persons in ambush. His body was
riddled by bullets. Mrs. Freeman said
that those v.'ho had a hand in the as
sassination had been abie to keep the
fact from reaching publication. She
asked that the murder be avenged. In
spectors of the department were sent
to Ada immediately after the receipt of
the letter and the officials of the United
States court for the southern district
of Georgia were instructed to aid in the
investigation.
This case and the killing of Postmas
fcer Baker and his family tn Lake City,

TO INCREASE
THE REVENUES
House Takes Up Loud's
Bill Regulating the
Mails.
Reduces Second-Class Matter
to Newspapers and
Periodicals.
Contains an Amendment Permitting
the Sending of Sample
Copies.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. March 1.
' The House to-day entered upon the
consideration of the Loud bin: relating
to second-class mail matter. The bill is
dentical to the one passed by the last
Congr'ss. but Mr. Loud, its author.
gavfnotice of an amendment permit
t'ne the transmission at pound rates
of sample copies up to 10 per cent of the
bona-fide circulation of the newspaper
periodicals. This amendment removes
much- opposition to the bill.
Only three speeches were delivered to
day Mr. Loud made an exhaustive
_ D ;; ch to its favor, claiming that the
Government practically paid a subsidy
of $40 000,000 to the proprietors of pub
lications -which now gat access to the
malls at pound rates, as the cost of
transporting mall and its handling av
eraged I cents a pound. Mr. Moon (D.)
of Tennessee spoke in opposition to the
bill and Mr. Perkins (R.) of lowa In fa
vor c-f it. The debate will continue un
t.l Thursday, when the vote will be ta
ken at 4 o'clock.
Second-class mail matter, by the bill,
is restricted to newspapers and periodi
cals issued at least four times a year |
from a known office of publication, and I
publications issued under the auspices
of benevolent or fraternal organiza
tions trades unions or others having a
membership of not less than 1000. All
publishers whose publications are ad
mitted as second-class mail matter are
required by the bill before depositing I
such mail "matter in the postoffices |to j
separate it â¢ into United States mall
sacks or bundles for States, cities,
towns and counties as the Postmaster â¢
General may direct.
Â»i Mr. Loud, chairman of the Postomce
Committee, who had charge of the bill,
explained before : the ; â  debate â¢ T opened ]
that the committee" would offer an
amendment at the proper time to allow i
the transmission of sample copies of
newspapers and .periodicals not in ex
cess of. 10; per cent of their bona-fide
circulation. He yielded, before taking
the floor, to Mr: Hinriehsen. <D.) of Il
linois, who. presented some resolutions
adopted by the Illinois PreÃS Associa
tion indorsing the bill, with the amend
ment, of which Mr. Loud had given no
tic^. He read a letter from Mr. Day of
the National Editorial Association.
â which declared with this amen;'.
the bill vtmld work no hardship to the
newspapers, and met with the approval ;
of the press associations of Illinois, In- j
diana and Michigan.
Loud then took the floor and sub- ;
mitted a general argument in favor of i
the bill, dwelling particularly upon the :
vast saving the hill would effect an
nually. The deficiency in the postal
revenues was steadily increasing. In
1596 it was JS. 000.000: last year it was
$12,000,000: this year it would be a mil- !
lion and a half more â all because it
cost the Government $42,000,000 to
transport the second class mail matter
of the country, which yielded to the i
Government a revenue of but $3,000,000.
He charged that much of the opposi
tion to this measure in the country
press had been aroused by the publish
ing houses of New Tork and we.
founded in fact. It had been charged.
Loud said, that 'this, bill v.as in the in
terest of the express companies.
"If we don't get this business." said '
he, "I don't care who gets it."
Loud displayed to the House a great
amount of the literature with which
Congress had been flooded by the oppo
sition to the bill, and he produced evi
dence that most of it had been in
spired directly by publishers who were
the beneficiaries af what be termed the
"Gox-ernment's bounty."
Loud was besieged with questions to
ward the close of his ,â¢ remarks. He
spoke for about two hours. â¢
Moon followed in opposition to the
ML He declared that Congress should
discharge its duty, riot to the presp of
the country, but! to the people. He con
ceded that there had been an abuse of
second class mail, matter privileges.
Advertising papers should be excluded
from this privilege. But he contended
that in striking down the evil this bill
destroyed rr.u< n of the good. If the
existing law and its construction cost
the Government J_ I 606 annually the
people were -the largest beneficia:
Perkins (R. ) of Tennessee supported
the bill. ' He had been inciined, as a
publisher, to support the bill before
the amendment proposed by Loud had
been offered. .Xnv, h- fieH that this
amendment would remove any â¢â â â 
tion any legitimate newspaper eouid
have to it-
Kitchen (D.) of North Carolina at
tempted to make a general political
speech. He was called to order by the
Speaker, who announced that hereafter
he proposed to hold members strictly
to the subject under consideration by ;
the House. The rule, he said, should :
be enforced impartially agrainst both
sides.
McMillm'(D.) of Tennessee suggested
that the enforcement of this -rule.which
he considered a departure from the
practice of the House, might lead to de
nial of the right of speech-
The Speaker said that during his
twenty years' services in the House he
had never seen any danger of such a
contingency.
At 5 p. Nx the House adjourned.

BOSTON. March 1.-The Cor.p-ejratlonal
Club met at Lorimer Hall this evening
and listened to a discussion of the topic
"The Hawaiian Republic and Its Future
Relations to the United States." Ray

"As a missionary enterprise, annexa
tion has no standing. To annex on mili

exposes us to positive and uncompensated
To annex on commercial grounds
is useless, because we have all the ad

of incapacity and constant danger: for

"In time to come, when the nations

shall be beaten into plowshares and

"NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE."
ONE of the strangest features of the present at
titude of this country toward Spain is that no
matter what is done '"no special significance"
attaches to it. This information may be obtained
from any official who may consider himself at liberty
to speak, but the fact that so many feel constrained
to curb the agility of their tongues by firmly gripping
them between their teeth is merely another of the cir-
cumstances so strikingly devoid of significance. If
rumor set afloat by diplomacy is to be credited, there
is nothing left to mortal ken to which may be at
tributed the quality of significance. Indeed how there
should have happened to be a human environment
made up entirely of the insignificant is enough to
puzzle people who happen to think about it.
Work is rushed at navy yard and army post, muni
tions of war hurried from point to point, a Senator
sent to Havana, secret conferences held among
statesmen, efforts made to increase the number of
ships and man them, to hide the real opinion of the
board of inquiry. All these things might unite in
creating a feeling of uneasiness, a theory that the un
usual was about to happen. But no. Tacked to each
of them as a rider is the statement that it "has no
significance." Thus the country is reassured, and
aside from wondering why energy is being bent to
the accomplishment of that which indicates naught
but the unbridled sway of the insignificant, the ir
relevant and the immaterial, finds no excuse for
being aroused to emotion.

*â¢ propriation bill disclose the fact that Hunting
ton has not yet given up his fight against the im
provement of San Pedro harbor, but fortunately
also show that he has lost his power in the House
and that his last struggle will be unavailing and fu
tile.
To pave the way for the assault on the proposed
appropriation for San Pedro the attack was begun
on the clause of the bill appropriating $133,000 for the
improvement of Oakland harbor. The opponents of
the measure took a stand ostensibly in the interests
of economy and urged that as no contract had yet
been made for the work at Oakland it should not be
undertaken at this time. It was generally recognized
that this "was but a preliminary move in the fight
against San Pedro, since an adverse vote on that
ground against the Oakland appropriation would
have established a precedent for defeating the im
provement of the southern harbor.
The attempt to strike the Oakland appropriation
from the bill failed, and then the fight against San
Pedro began in earnest. The most significant feature
of it was the speech made by General Grosvenor of
Ohio, who, after attacking the appropriation on the
ground that the contemplated improvement would be
unwise, that it would cost more than the amount
fixed by law, and that no contract had yet been made
for the work, went on to say that an excellent har
bor in that vicinity would be constructed by private
enterprise and turned over to the Government with
out cost provided the Government should not pro
ceed with the improvement at San Pedro. He is re
ported to have stated also that an offer in writing to
that effect has been filed with the Secretary of War
by persons of unquestionable responsibility.
The statement of General Grosvenor was under
stood to refer to Mr. Huntington, but it appears that
an investigation failed to discover any evidence that
such a proposition had been made to the Secretary
of War. Possibly General Grosvenor may have been
assured that "the responsible parties" were willing to
make the offer and assumed they had done so. How
ever the mistake may have occurred, the statement
made openly on the floor of Congress shows how
desperate are the tactics of the Southern Pacific
managers and to what extent they are willing to go
in their efforts to maintain their old-time monopoly
of transcontinental communication with the ports and
harbors of California.
Despite the efforts of the opposition the appropri
ation was agreed to and a victory for the people ac
complished in the House. Thus another step has
been taken toward the emancipation of the indus
tries and commerce of California from the thralldom
of the Southern Pacific Company. Mr. Huntington
may, if he chooses, improve Santa Monica harbor at
his own expense, but if he does so he will not be in
a position to monopolize the traffic of the counties
back of Los Angeles and compel it to defray the cost
of the improvement. He will have competition there
as in the San Joaquin. and can no longer fix freights
and fares at all the traffic will bear.
Whatever may be said derogatory to Fitzhugh
Lee the charge cannot be made that the Spanish like
him.
FIRING BOTH BARRELS AT OAKLAND.
big six in the Oakland City Council, which
passed the water rate ordinance, is still in busi
* ness at the old stand and seems to have been
re-enforced since its first skirmish and victory.
After passing the water ordinance it prepared to
take another fall out of the people by putting through
a real estate job under the guise of a park proposi
tion. It is noteworthy that the park job ordinance
describes the ground to be bought by metes and
bounds, but does not give the number of acres nor
the price. It is known outside the text of the ordi
nance that the price is about $5000 per acre and the
area about sixty acres. Land bought at that price
for park purposes is a most luxurious investment. It
may fit into the financial views of the rank Council
men who have just watered their official stock, but
only cities of three-quarters of a million people can
afford to pay that price for park sites.
The vote for the new water ordinance was Bros
nahan, Earl, Heitmann, Henneberry, Watkinson and
Woodward. President Pringle denounced these six
men to their faces in the Council and took some pains
to rifle the vocabulary of anger and contempt to ex
press his opinion of their treachery and probable cor
ruption. Then the roll was called on the park job,
and Pringle complacently voted with the same six
for that job!
These are hard lines for the people of Oakland. It
is noticed that the local papers, which have been very
indignant over the water ordinance, are indulging in
a pleased and smiling silence over the real estate job
put through by the same combination.
MR. TOWNE'S TURKEY TALK-
argument for free silver as made by Mr.
Towne has features that are somewhat novel.
He declares that while he was a member of
Congress the United States would have made an
armed interference in Turkey in behalf of the Ar
menians but for the control of this country by the
bondholders who own the Turkish bonds and did
not want the credit of the Sultan impaired. This is
news indeed. Dr. Hepworth, an American citizen,
reports that the Armenian diffi-ulties were incited by
revolutionists who urged the Armenians to revolt
and then left them to take the consequences. But, no
matter what the origin of the troubles, the right of
the United States to interfere cannot be demon
strated. We have stood by th? Monroe doctrine
since 1824. Our interpretation of that doctrine is that
there shall be no further aggrandizement of terri
tory in this hemisphere by any European power, and
that Europe shall not interfere in any way therein.
This doctrine has, for its necessary counterbalance,
our absolute abstention from interference in the af
fairs of the European hemisphere. Without this ab
stention the Monroe doctrine has no standing. We
have no right to maintain it at all under any other
conditions. The Washington administration and
Congress understood this perfectly. We were at the
time spoken of by Mr. Towne seeking from Eng
land, peaceably if possible, acknowledgment of this
doctrine in the Venezuela affair. To have interfered
in Turkey would have combined Europe in alliance
with England against us, and what we finally won
with peace and honor would have been ours only at
the close of a successful war against all Europe.
England gracefully yielded the point, assented to ar
bitration, and the Venezuela incident closed with the
Monroe doctrine fairly written into international
law and with the Continental nations snarling at Eng
land for her surrender. American diplomacy had
won a distinguished victory.
Now Mr. Towne, in appealing to prejudice, throws
mud at this honorable chapter in our history and at-
tributes our policy of non-intervention in Turkey, to
which alone we owe our success, to a corrupt intrigue
between this country and the Turkish bondholders,
and declares the whole result to be due to the ma
chinations of certain goldbugs.
It will go ill with the country if its policies are to
be subjected to such ideas and put into the hands of
men who advocate them.
If we should interfere in a contest between Turkey
and her Armenian subjects our interference must be
backed by an armed force, and that would mean a
declaration of war, and the theater of the contest
would be in European Turkey and Asia Minor. A
more Quixotic project cannot be imagined. It would
involve us in all the foreign complications against
which this country has been warned by all of its pa
triot statesmen since Washington. It would instantly
authorize and empower any and every Government
in Europe to intrude in the affairs of this hemisphere.
The chronic slaughter in the revolutions that are
continually in progress in Central and South America
affords precisely the same pretext for European in
terference that we have in the affairs of Turkey.
Only the presence and position of the United States
prevent such interference. Now when we hold to
that preventive attitude Mr. Towne tells his country
men that it is not due to statesmanship and high con
siderations of national policy, but to the bribery of
goldbugs and bondholders. His statement should
justly alarm every American who has a high regard
for the honor of his country. It means that if Mr.
Towne make "one of that great host which in 1900 is
to meet in Washington to inaugurate William J.
Bryan as President," this Government is to imme
diately assume dictatorship in European affairs and
assert suzerainty over the Turkish empire. It is well
that such apprentices in statecraft are kept in private
life.
Sagasta declares that Spain will never arbitrate.
What he means is that such a course would fail to
have his distinguished approval. Sagasta is not to
be blamed for any of his utterances just now. A man
with the responsibility of guiding the remnants of a
nation, the remnants showing a constant tendency
to slough off, may be excused if he say things show
ing him to be laboring under temporary mental
aberration.
Boutelle's exclamatory admonition to the public to
go to the devil is not a notable improvement on the
immortal words of Vanderbilt. Indeed, if one were
inclined to be critical the statesman might be ac
cused of plagiarism as well as bad temper and worse
taste.
Mr. Ebanks of San Diego must be getting tired
of having the court set days for him to mount the
gallows. He can never be convinced that the law
is not bluffing until it has put him out of one state of
suspense into another.
The charge that Roosevelt has a spine is now
openly made against him. If no worse can be
brought the young man is in danger of being con
victed of popularity.
Possibly the gentleman who declares that Havana
has no submarine mines means that it has fewer than
it had before the Maine met with disaster.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 2, 1898.
PROMOTION IN THE NfJVY.
READERS of The Call will remember that a
few days ago we published a roll of the names
and places of birth of the seamen who had per
ished with the destruction of the Maine at Havana.
Those who read the roll with attention must have
been impressed with the number of names on it re
corded as of foreign birth. It was an American
battle-ship charged with the high duty of maintain
ing the honor of the American flag, but a very large
proportion of the men who served its engines and
its guns were foreigners.
There was nothing new to the public in the facts
disclosed. It has long been known that our navy and
to a great extent our merchant marine is manned by
men who at best are Americans by adoption only.
Several Secretaries of the Navy have directed the at
tention of Congress to the evil, for an evil it is, but
nothing has been done to provide a remedy. It now
appears likely, however, that the new stimulus to
patriotism given by the disaster at Havana will move
Congress to act in this as well as in other matters
of naval improvement, and that we shall have within a
comparatively short time some well devised legisla
tion tending to make the naval service more attrac
tive to Americans than it has been in times past.
The objection of Americans to service at sea does
not spring from any lack of ocean daring or any
want of popular pride in our navy and its history.
The cause is due mainly to the laws which govern
the sailor while at sea. The young American, born
and raised in the freedom of American institutions
and having an ambition to rise in life, is not attracted
by the conditions which still prevail in the ocean ser
vice of the country. With the exception, therefore, of
those who have a dominating inclination for a sea
man's life, the American leaves sea service for
Europeans and stays ashore until the outbreak of war
calls him to respond as a patriotic duty.
As one of the means of encouraging the enlistment
of young Americans it has been proposed to open in
the naval service avenues for advancement and pro
motion to all who enlist. At the present time our
method of providing officers for the navy bars the
man who enters it as a seaman from any chance of
rising, no matter how competent and faithful he may
be. If this exclusive system were done away with
and the young sailor as well as the cadet from An
napolis could see before him in the naval service an
opportunity for advancement that would appeal to his
ambition, there can be no question that the number
of enlistments would increase and the class of those
seeking the service would improve.
The change suggested will not be a wholly untried
experiment. The exclusive system once prevailed in
the army as in the navy, but some years since a
means was provided by which a private soldier who
is able to pass the required tests may become a com
missioned officer, and the results have been beneficial
in every respect. It is fair to assume that what
worked well in the army will be as beneficial in the
navy, and if the proposed reform takes place we may
reasonably expect a navy which shall be manned by
Americans â one which, at any rate, will afford to
any American youth the same opportunities for ad
vancement and honor that are open to him in every
other service of his country.
EXPOSITION APPROPRIATIONS.
A BILL has been introduced into the House of
Representatives by General Bingham of
Pennsylvania to authorise the holding of a
national exposition of American products and manu
factures especially suitable for export in Philadelphia
in 1899. The bill carries with it an appropriation of
$350,000, and in addition thereto Congress will be ex
pected to provide for a governmental exhibit.
Philadelphia will obtain the appropriation she asks.
A committee of distinguished citizens have been to
Washington to back up the Congressional delegation
of the State in making the contest for it. It is un
derstood that the appropriation is to be available only
when the exposition association furnishes to the Sec
retary of the Treasury satisfactory proof that it has
secured subscriptions for the purposes of the expo
sition to an amount equal to that of the sum appro
priated. This, of course, will be readily accomplished.
The prospects of the Philadelphia enterprise are
therefore bright and promising.
This matter is of interest to us because we also have
an exposition enterprise on hand. Our delegation in
Congress will give help to the Philadelphia project
and the Pennsylvanians should be notified that they
will be expected to return the compliment when the
Californian bill is before the House. Reciprocity is
as excellent in home business as in foreign affairs,
and this is a good opportunity to put it into practice
for the mutual benefit of the East and West.
The expediency of national appropriations for ex
positions of interstate importance is no longer ques
tioned. Such appropriations have been so repeatedly
made since the Centennial at Philadelphia that they
are now looked upon as matters of course, and
whenever the people of any particular locality have
undertaken an exposition of genuine magnitude Con
gress has willingly voted aid and assistance.
The proposed exposition to be held in California
in commemoration of the admission of the State is
to be one of exceptional greatness and importance.
It is to represent not one State, but the whole of that
imperial region familiarly known as the Golden West,
and will be in comprehensiveness and value superior
to any exposition ever held in the Union with the
single exception of the marvel at Chicago during the
Columbian year.
The appropriation asked, for by the Pennsylvanians
includes $300,000 to be employed in the erection of
buildings and $50,000 to be used in collecting in
foreign markets various exhibits showing how mer
chandise should be packed for sale abroad. Similar
sums for similar purposes would be of material aid
in promoting the proposed exposition here, and since
the Philadelphia bill will afford a recent precedent for
granting aid for such purposes, it would seem clear
that it will be our own fault if we do not obtain it.
Dr. Hill of the State Quarantine Department feels
indignant that he should have been made a prisoner
on board the Doric. Nothing could be more natural,
and yet the Doric may confine the entire State
quarantine outfit in the hold and never excite the
sign of a murmur from the public.
The gentlemen about to opon a private zoo in this
city could add much to its impressiveness by secur
ing a pair of Oakland Councilmen and placing them
on exhibition, securely caged.
Bateman Brothers owe the Supervisors at least a
vote of thanks. If ~-*y more material obligation ex
isted the matter is one among gentlemen who do not
take the public into confidence.
Those Apache Indians bound for Cuba to fight for
the island's freedom must not get the idea that they
can teach the Spanish any new tricks
REBELLIOUS SUSIE ILLINOIS.
She Believes That Taxation Without Representation
Is Turannu.
The women of Chicago, who represent $10,000,000 worth of property, are
praying the Legislature of Illinois for the exemption of their property from
taxation.
"If we women are not to be permitted to say who shall administer the Gov
ernment, -who shall apportion the taxes; if our voice may not be heard in the
selection of the stewards who shall expend the public moneys, part of which
is provided by us, we shall refuse to contribute toward such a rundâ at least
we protest that to compel us to make such contribution is arbitrary and un
just and should be illegal."
In other words, if the game is not played according to rules in which we
shall have our fair say we'll "take our doll things and go home."
This is the position of the women of Illinois.
And if the game shall be broken up by your withdrawal, Susie Illinois?
"I don't care," says pouting Susie, preparing to bundle up her belongings
and sulkily go her own way.
Of course, there isn't the slightest possibility of the game's going to rack
and ruin for lack of Susie Illinois, though her ten millions' (in Chicago alone)
worth of doll babies and playhouse furniture is no small item of the commu
nity property. And for a very simple reason. Susie will not take her doll
things. She can't. The back yard where she and Johnnie Illinois are playing
and quarreling is the only back yard in the world for her. There can be no
question of another place, of other playmates, of other times and other man
ners.
But suppose there were? Suppose Susie, with her chubby arms full of
valuables, shall march off the reservation? What then? Merely that she'll
not stay off. That's all. My poor Susie, if your property is to tie exempt from
taxation, you yourself are exempt from the protection of which that taxation
has hitherto assured you. In leaving the safe precincts of Johnnies back yard
you expose yourself to all the unknown terrors of the dog-infested, bully-full,
un-shed-covered neighborhood. You are exempt from taxation, but you are
also exempt from police protection, from the use of good streets, from the
benefit of street lighting and all the other civilized contrivances, from which
woman, being the weaker partner in the great game, benefits most.
Such a division of property and of interests is absurd, of course. Should
Susie, from the wildness of equal rights to which she has, supposedly, fled, be
attacked by or anticipate that she will be attacked by some dog outlaw a few
inches high; should a robber kitten of her own sex attempt to dispossess her
of a part of that $10,000,000 worth of dolls; should her cherubic foot slip in the
mud of the outer yard, who in the world can doubt that she would promptly
scream? And who, knowing the world of Susies and Johnnies, can for a mo
ment doubt the effect of that scream? It will be Johnnie to the rescue, and
Susie, speedily, still alarmed but sobbing comfortably, back In the fold, her
ten millions in the common fund and the old game begun over again, all the
more interesting for the novel interlude, which gave Susie an opportunity to
play her old role of lovely woman in distress and Johnnie his great chance of
appearing as the brave champion of her helplessness.
No, there can be no divsion of people into mankind and woman
kind. Every Susie has a Johnnie, a brother Johnnie, Â©r a father JohnrJo, or a
husband Johnnie. Happily Susie Illinois and the Susies of other States are
bound by ties strorper than their longing for equality or their love of justice
to Johnnies in various degrees of relationship. And it is only for a theoretical
moment that ?he can think of her interests apart from his. The abstract John
nie is a tyrant, no <!oubt; but the particular, the individual Johnnie, i? a male
creature, limited perhaps, faulty no doubt, but endeared to Susie by a lifetime
and world-time of common joys.
Therefore Susie Illinois, outraged, indignant Susie, smarting from a sense
of injustice and a humiliating feeling of helplessness, remain, I beg you, in the
dear old familiar back yard. Let your feminine thrift still be added to John
nies accumulations. No bullying, Susie; no threat?. We shall vote, you and
I, when each and every one of us shall convince her individual Johnnie â not
that it is unjust that we do not vote, but that it is wise and expedient that
we do. MIRIAM MICHELSON.

SENATOR GEAR AND HAWAII.
Philadelphia Times.
Senator Gear of lowa has joined Sen
ator Morrill of Vermont In his opposition
to the annexation of Hawaii on the
ground that a population of 7000 of whites
sandwiched with 33,000 more or less Ig
norant and diseased natives and 71.000
Chinese and Japanese hardly constitute a
suitable constituency for a self-governing
State. It will be noted that Senator trear
has ignored all questions of sugar grow
ing and manifest destiny, and considered
only the fitness of the country, with its
mixed and ignorant population, to be
come one of the American States. Most
intelligent people will regard Senator
Gear's reason for opposing the treaty as
a very sensible one and will wonder why
he should have so few Republican col
leagues in the Senate of a like way o*
thinking. They will be gratified, how
ever, with the assurance that the odds
and ends of opposition, made up of Dem
ocrats. Populists anad a few Republicans
like Morrill and Gear, are likely to pre
vent the confirmation of the treaty.
BISMARCK THE SOLDIER.
Prince Bismarck on March 25 next will
celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of his
entering the Prussian army, to which he
now belongs as Colonel General of Cav
alry and chief of the regiment of Seyd
lltz Cuirassiers, which is named after a
famous general of Frederick the Great.
On that date in 1838 young Bismarck was
mustered into the battalion of Jaegers of
the Royal Guards at Potsdam as a one
year volunteer. A year later he received
his discharge as a non-commissioned of
ficer and was transferred to the reserve.
In 1854 he was promoted to first lieuten
ant in the cavalry of the Landwehr (na
tional militia); in 1859 he became captain,
and in IS6I major. During the Austro-
Prussian war in 18G6 he was made a ma
jor-general; at the proclamation of the
German Empire in Versailles in 1871, he
advanced to lieutenant general, and in
1876 he was made general of cavalry. Wil
liam II in March of 1890 appointed him
colonel general.
PREPARE FOR A GALE.

The Hon. William Jennings Bryan, the
Hon. George Fred Williams, and the Hon.
Jim Jones have promised to go to the
spring meeting of the Bimetallic League
at Indianapolis. Joy sparkles in the eyes
of the silver Hoosiers. "The size of the
crowd on that occasion," says the Delphi
Times triumphantly, "will make the late
monetary convention look like a knot on
a street corner." The poor old monetary
convention was not a wild uprising of the
people, but this Indianapolis spring meet
ing causes alarm already. Mr. Bryan is
a large crowd. The Hon. Jim Jones is a
multitude. The Hon. George Fred Wil
liams is an army with banners. How can
three such vast badles come together
without danger to themselves and others,
if there are any others?

SALARIES IN FRANCE.
â¢It Is always pleasant to read of the in

800 make from $1500 to $3000. while 1200 earn

alone, we find that there are not 400 of
them who make as much as $2000 a year.
A couple of score make incomes of $10,000

is only from $600 to $SOO a year, while for
the Justices of the Peaceâ fully qualified

IN LENT.
No smiles allure.
She looks demure
And like a nun all gowned in gray,
With modest mem,
And face serene
As down the aisle she takes her way,.
I upward look
From my hymn book.
And wonder, as my pew she passes,
"Can this be May,
This saint In gray.
Devout in penitential ashes?"
She looks Intent
On prayer full bent
Her thoughts are far from summer beacne*
Her heart inclines
To Lenten shrines, -
And rather psalms than tender speeches.
In other guise
I saw her eyes,
(Ah. summers gone and seasons spent),
O Time, how strange
You wrought the change
In May, my summer girl, In Lent.

BUILDING IN CASINOâ C, Jackson,
Cal. The law of casino says: "Should a
player build up a card to a certain de
nomination and his opponent decline to
build it higher, he, the first player, must
not alter his build, but must take it with
a card of the same denomination." In
other words a player cannot, after laying
an ace on a seven spot and making- it
eight, on the next deal, if the opponent
does not raise the build or take It. make
it ten by adding a two-spot to it, but he
may, if he has the cards, add another
eight and call out, not "eight," but
"eights." He must take that with a card
of the same denomination.
SILVER PLATINGâ A. S., City. The

it is all dissolved. In dissolving 100 oun
ces of silver the following proportions are
those which have been found to be the
best. Seven pounds of the best nitric acid
and 61 ounces of cyanide of potassium
of the average quality; this quantity will
precipitate the 100 ounces of silver in tho
solution. After this is washed add 62
ounces more of the cyanide of potassium
and this will dissolve the precipitate.
This being done the plating solution is

HIS STORY
Evidence by the Defend
ant on the Murder
Charge.
Business Connections With the
Firm of Hoffman, Roth
child & Co.
Other Evidence Which Has Been
Given on Previous Occa
sions.
Juage Cook, jury and a small but in
terested audience listened yesterday to
the testimony of Theodore A. Figel,
Tvho is on trial for the murder of Isaac
Hoffman. He told of his connections
with the firm of Hoffman, Rothchild &
Co., the work he had been accustomed
to doing while in their employ, and
then went over the ground he had trav
eled after leaving the store at 6:15
o'clock on the evening of Juno 1 on. his
way to his ..orae in San Rafael. He
told of his family and home prior to |
the evening of the arrest caused by the
suspicion that he had murdered his em
ir, and then in detail related a
Btory concerning the ownership of the
revolver which caused the death of I
Isaac Hoffman, the sale of the pistol j
and the purchase of a new and larger |
one on the evening of June 1.
J. W. Raphael was the first witness
ralied during the morning session. He
testified, as he had previously done at
the preliminary examination, that he
had conversed with Isaac Hoffman
concerning his family relations, and
that he had been told the family would
be a happy one If his mother-in-law
were not allowed to live in his home.
He stated that he had been acquainted
with the deceased merchant for some
time and- that he had been with Mr.
Hoffman on the evening of the Bush
street fire. General Barnes asked the
witness why he was there or If he knew
the amount of insurance on the build
ing:. A strenuous objection was inter
posed by Judge Murphy, which was
sustained by the court.
A. B. Paulsen testified that he had
overheard a conversation pf Alexander
of the firm in which it had been stated
that Mrs. Hoftman was determined t0..
obtain her husband's business Inter
ests! The witness was excused and
Â« "hief Lees was called regarding a con
versation he had with Raphael shortly
after the shooting, but no testimony'
was given by the witness.
Then Figel was called to the stand
by General Barnes for the defense. In
answer to questions he stated that he
had left the store at 6:15 o'clock on the
evening of June 1. He carried a pack
age of books of the firm and went from
the store on his way to the Safe De
posit building.. Then in' detail the de
fendant told of his trip to the Cabin
saloon; E. T. Allen's gun store, where
h^ purchased the revolver and a box
of cartridges; Charles Bliss, the tailor,
Where he went with the intention 6t
trying- on a suit which had been, pre
viously ordered, and his trip to his
home in San Rafael. The witness told of :
meeting acquaintances, and among
them Mr. Jacobs, a watchman, and his
return trip to the store, for a bottle of
ink, which he failed to procure. The
testimony was a repetition of the state- :
' ments made by the defendant both at
the Coroner's inquest and at the pre
liminary examination before Judge
.Campbell. ,V' â : .â¢â¢', â â 'â 'â â  . .â :..-..- .â â  . .--. /.\-.v '.:â â¢:'!
A f-w questions were asked the -wit
ness by the defense at the opening of â 
the afternoon session, and the defend
ant was thon turned over for a thor- .
. ough cross-examination by Judge Mur
phy, special counsel for the prosecu
tion. The witness was gradually led\
up to his meeting with Issac Hoffman
in the store after his return. He stated
that he had gone into the store and
turned on an electric light in Mr. Alex
ander's 'office, and saw Issac Hoffman
standing, in his own office reading a.
letter or newspaper. It was then 6:20
I >. ml, and a .slight conversation was
h'l'l regarding the profits of the New
Y'lik. and local house, and the witness
then stated that Mr. Hoffman walked j
with him to the front door and he ap
peared to be in as good spirits and
health as oh former occasions.
When the witness was excused
Abraham Hafimari testified that he
and Isaac Hoffman had visited a de^
tective agency for the purpose. of pro
curing an officer to assist them in va- j
rio.us- work and; to protect Isaac. Hoff
man from parties : : who it had been j
claimed -Were following him far evil j
purposes, although the witness again i
denied that Isaac Hoffman had told ;
him that his brother was being watched !
and followed for evil purposes.
The witness stated that his brother
had told him that he was afraid he
would be assaulted by Rothchild, as he
had been told he would be assassinated.
Many questions were asked the wit
ness, but : . objections: were frequent and
the majority of them were sustained.
The witness admitted that he had type
written two copies of the letters from
the East which had been intercepted
by the deceased merchant.
It was elicited from the witness that
Mrs. Alexander had vilified Isaac Hoff
man on at least one occasion. The wit
ness was called for the purpose of
showing the state of the deceased mer
chant's mind and to tend to show that
Isaac Hoffman had many bitter ene^

A WORD OF ADVICE.
! To Those Coming to Alaska or the
Klondike Gold Fields.
One thing should be impressed upon
every miner, prospector or trader coming
to Alaska, to the Klondike, or the Yukon
country, and that is the necessity for pro
viding'an adequate and proper food sup
p'y. Whether procured in the States, in
the Dominion or at the supply stores here
or further on, this must be his primary
concern. Upon the manner in which the
miner has observed or neglected this pre
caution more than upon any other one
thing will his success or failure depend
Those supplies must be healthful ana
shoiAd bo concentrated, but the most
careful attention in the selection of foods
that will keep unimpaired indefinitely
under all the conditions which they will
have to encounter is imperative. For in
stance, as bread raised with baking pow
der must be re-lied upon for the chief part
of every meal, imagine the helplessness
of a miner with a can of spoiled baking
powder. Buy only the very best Hour;
it is the cheapest in the end. Experience
has shown the Royal Baking Powder t<>
be the most reliable, and the trading com
panies now uniformly supply this brand,
as others will not keep in this climate.
Be sure that the bacon is sweet,
sound and thoroughly cured. These are
the absolute necessities upon which all
must place a chief reliance, and ran under
no circumstances be neglected. They may,
of course, be supplemented by as many
comforts or delicacies as the prospector
may be able to pack or desire to pay for.

DIED FAR FROM HOME.
Herman Liebes Passes Away After a Long
Illness.
Wcrrd was received In this city yesterday of the death of Herman
Liebes, head of the fur house of H. Liebes & Co., at the residence of his
cousin, Solomon Liebes, in London. Mr. Liebes has been sick for some
years, and his death was not altogether unexpected.
The deceased was born in Germany 55 years and 11 months ago. He
came to this country in 1864, coming direct to San Francisco, where he found
ed the house of which he is the head, and which is said to be the largest of
its kind in the United States. The business was originally conducted on
Montgomery street in the building next adjoining the old Wells-Fargo Com
pany building.
Being of progressive spirit and wishing to branch out into other lines, he
formed the North American Commercial Company in 1890, which succeeded
the Alaska Commercial Company, and this company practically controlled
the. trade of Alaska, they having purchased whaling and fishing vessels, es
tablished canneries and founded upward of twenty posts in that country.
He founded the Alaska Exploration Company, and became thoroughly iden
tified with Alaska and its products. About eleven years ago a dropsical
complaint developed itself, and for eight years he was treated by local phy
sicians with varying success. Three years ago he went to London, where
he could have the benefit of the Matlack Sanitarium, and took up his resi
dence with his cousin, Solomon Liebes. His death was brought about by a
complication of diseases, but primarily bronchitis and dropsy.
Arrangements will be made at once to have the remains brought to this
city for interment, and a member of the family will go to London to super
intend their removal. It is not probable that any important changes will -be
made in the conduct of the business house, as all the affairs of the deceased
were in first-class order.
Four sons and a daughter survive Mr. Liebes, and they have been over
whelmed with letters and dispatches of condolence from home and abroad.

Four Hundred Miners
Left Yesterday on the

the Tug Vigilant.
All That Is Left of the Whaling Fleet
Being Got Ready for Another
Cruise.
Over four hundred miners left for the
Copper River gold fields on the steam
er Valencia yesterday. The vessel will
stop at Seattle on her way up, where
Captain Lord will join her. Captain
Humphrey took the vessel out from this
port, but will remain at Seattle to look
out for the interests of the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company. The passen
gers by the Valencia came principally
from the Eastern States, and they are
all brimful of confidence in their abiV
ity to make the earth yield up her
treasures. The Valencia has been
splendidly fitted out as a passenger
boat. In the short time at his com
mand Captain Bennett of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company did won
ders. He made almost a new vessel put
of the steamer, and the company got
her away on her voyage almost on
time.
The Wilson Mining Company of Oak
land went up on the Valencia. It con
sists of a party of eight, whose first
business will be to establish a pack
train between Copper City and the
headwaters of the Copper River.
The steamer President from Coquille
River reached port in tow of the tug
Vigilant last night. The steamer was
not far from Greenwood when she
broke down, and a boat was cent ashore
to ask for assistance. Once the tug
got her lines aboard it did not take
Captain John Silovich long to get his
tow into port. The work of repairing
the President will begin to-day and
she will soon be back on her old run
again.
The captain of the British ship Lou
don Hill made a lucky find the other
day. When heaving up the anchor
preparatory to docking it was found
that another anchor and about fifty
fathoms of chain was attached to it.
It was probably lost by some trader
during one of the recent storms and
tugs with grappling irons failed to
find it. The recovered anchor and chain
is worth considerable money.
The old island trader, the bark Helen
W. Almy, has been purchased by a
syndicate and will be put in the Alaska
trade. Captain Hogan, formerly of the
ship Wachusett, will go in command of
her.
The whaling bark Andrew Hicks and
the steam whaler Karluk have been
hauled out of retirement in Oakland
Creek and will be fitted out for a cruise
In the Arctic.
Captain C. N. Wilson succeeds Cap
tain Thomas as master of the schooner
Lettitia.
The tug Alert has had a new boiler
put in and will be ready to go into
commission again in about two weeks.
The American ship Indiana arrived
from Philadelphia yesterday after a
smart passage of 140 days. She had an
uneventful passage until a week ago,
when a southeaster was encountered.
She has been beating about in It off the
Golden Gate until captain and crew
were sick and tired and hailed with de
light the appearance of the tug Reli
ance. It did not take the towboat long
to bring the ship into port.
The steamer Acapulco arrived from
Panama and way ports yesterday. She
was at San Jose de Guatemala on Feb
ruary 15, several days after President
Barrios had been assassinated, and the
officers of the steamer say that every
thing had quieted down before they
got there.
TO MAKE FORMAL
TRANSFER TO-DAY
The State Board Will Absorb
the Alaska Trade Com
mittee.
They Are to Be Relinquished From
All Past Liabili

The Alaska trade committee Is no more.
The State Board of Trade as a body has
consented to endeavor to carry on Its
work. This conclusion was reached yes
terday at an adjourned meeting of the
board, at which the sub-committee, con
sisting of Messrs. W. H. Mills, B. N.
Kowley and Cragle Sharp, offered the fol
lowing resolution, which was adapted:
"Resolved, That the State Board of
Trade will accept from the Alaska trade
committee Its literature for distribution
and its function as a bureau of informa
tion as to the merits of San Francisco as
an outfitting point for Alaska and what
ever assets said committee may have on
hand, free of all debts and obligations
outstanding against said Alaska commit
tee, and will conduct a bureau of inior
mation, relying on the business commu
nity of San Francisco and other Califor
nia cities for support of the same."
Secretary J. A. Filcher of the State
board will meet H. H. Sherwood, presi
dent of the Alaska committee, to-day
and arrange for formal transfer. In the
report of the sub-committee it was shown
that the Alaska committee .had received
from all sources $12,ay<J 36: that they had
disbursed $10,887 78, and that of the bal
ance of $1,41158 the committee owed
$802 70. Of this amount the ;..;tska com
mittee will retain $75 for an expense that
they may have out, of which at this
time they are not aware. Eventually
they will turn over all the money to the
board. â¢ .
They also turn over as assets unpaid
subscripions to the amount of about â¦iOO,
and they agree to relinquish me State
board from any responsibilities that uiey
may have incurred in the past. They
also turn over, besides literature includ
ing 500 sailing dates, 100,000 folders, 100
hanging maps and a lot of office sta

Talent.
Recreation Grounds Incorporated and
Extensive Improvements to
Be Made.
There will be an abundance of base
ball in this city this season from the
present outlook of things.
Recently the Pacific States' League
was formed for the purpose of holding
a tournament at Central Park. Eugene
F. Bert was elected president, and in an
interview stated that the league would
be composed of the strongest teams in
the State, and that the public would be
treated to the finest kind of baseball.
Now comes the California State
League, composed of some leading citi
zens, which promises the Pacific League
a hard fight for existence.
As a step toward strengthening their
hold on the baseball patronage the Rec
reation Grounds were incorporated yes
terday for $50,000. It is the intention of
the new owners to raise the fences sur
rounding it ten feet, grade the surface
of the ground and make other improve
ments, which will give this city the fin
est athletic park in the State.
On Tuesday next the members of the
California State League, which was or
ganized last year, will hold a meeting in
the Baldwin Hotel for the purpose of
formulating plans for the season of '98.
Representatives from Oakland, Sacra
mento, Fresno, Stockton, San Jose and
of this city will attend, and it is ex
pected that the schedule of games and
other important matters will be ar
ranged.
President H. H. McPike of the league
telegraphed East a few days ago, and
gained admittance to the National
League, and all games will be played
under its protection and according to
its rules.
In each of the cities named the teams
will be made up of the strongest ma

MISTREATED HIS WIFE.
Mrs. M. V. Kirketerp Granted a Di
vorce From Her Husband.
Mrs. M. V. Kirketerp was granted a di
vorce from her husband, W. C. Kirketerp.
yesterday by Judge Troutt on the
grounds of habitual intemperance and in
fidelity. The married life of Mrs. Kirke
terp was an unhappy one. Shortly after
her marriage her husband's actions
caused her much suffering and discontent,
but she submitted to his treatment as
long as endurance would bear. A short
time ago, however, she concluded to sue
for a divorce and the action was insti
gated. The case went before Judge Troutt
for trial and several days were occupied
in the hearing. A decision .was not given
on the day the case was submitted, but
the court took it under advisement and
yesterday granted Mrs. Kirketerp a de
cree as prayed for. In addition to the de
cree of divorce Judge Troutt made an or
der compelling the defendant to pay Mrs.
Kirketerp $4000 out of his separate prop
erty as alimony. This order results as a
complete settlement of all property rights
] involved in the litigation and la inclusive
iof the husband's counsel fees. All in all,
the decision of the court is looked upon
as a just one considering the motive that
prompted Mrs. Kirketerp to bring the ac
tion against her husband for an absolute
I annulment of her marriage.

was continued till Thursday.
Reardon followed the bailiff while he
was taking Banning from the court to
the prison and he was observed by Detec
tive Silvey. Silvey. knowing Reardon'a
reputation as an all-round crook, placed
him under arrest on general principles,
and later Irving Marshall, Janitor of the
Baldwin Theater, was sent for and iden
tified Banning and Reardon as the two
men who held him up on Stockton and
Bush streets early Saturday morning and
robbed him of his watch and purse. Ban
ning put a revolver to his head while
Reardon stood over him with a ciub till
he was searched. A charge of robbery
was at once booked against Banning and
Reardon.
Banning Is also an ex-convict and there
is at present a case pending against him
in the Superior Court for having burg

Warrants were sworn out yesterday for
the arrest of the two members of the firm
of Murray & Ready, employment agents,
for larceny by trick and device. The com
plainants were O. Jacobson and C. Clau

several others paid the agents for getting
them work chopping wood in Santa Cruz
County, the agents guaranteeing that the
men would be paid every week. Upon
reaching the place the men found that
they would not be paid before the middle
of May and they could not wait that long
for their pay. IÂ»ie trip to Santa Cruz and
return cost" the choppers from $8 to $10
apiece and on their return Murray &

DRTWURTirSOPINION
OF THE NEW DISCOVERY IN MEDI-
CI NE_
A Remarkably Successful Remedy for
Dyspepsia, Indigestion and Stomach
Troubles. . -
Dr. Wurth, in commenting on- recent
discoceries in medicine, said: There
is none which is certain to be so valua-
ble and far reaching in benefit as
Stuart's Dyspepsia ; Tablets, the new
stomach remedy; I say far reaching,
because people little realize how im-
portant a sound stomach and vigorous
digestion is to every man, woman and
child. .
Indigestion is the starting point of
consumption, heart disease, Bright' 3
disease, diabetes, nervous prostration,
liver troubles; why is this so? Simply
because every nerve, muscle and tis- ;
sue in our bodies is created and nour-
ished from the food we eat. If that
food is, by reason of a weak stomach,
compelled to lie for hours, a sour,
fermenting mass of half-digested food,
it poisons the blood and nervous sys-
tem, creates gas which distends the
stomach and bowels, causing pressure
on the heart, lungs and other organs
and seriously impeding their action.
He says further, the point to direct
attention is not the nerves, nor the
heart, nor lungs nor kidneys, but the
stomach, the first cause of. all the mis-
chief. '
The remedy to use for indigestion
and weak stomachs is not some cathar-
tic, but a remedy which will digest the
food, increase the flow of gastric juice,
absorb the gases, and Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets will accomplish exactly this
result in any case of Stomach trouble,
because these tablets are composed of
the digestive acids, aseptic pepsin, Gol-
den â  Seal L and Bismuth, : pleasant to
taste, and not being a patent medicine,
can be used by any. one with perfect
safety. I believe Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will cure any form of indiges-
tion and stomach trouble, except . can-
cer of stomach.
Full size packages of Stuart's Dy-
spepsia Tablets are sold by druggists
at 50 cents. A book on stomach dis-
eases together with thousands of tes-
timonials will be sent by addressing
Stuart Company, Marshall, Mich.

iiowTo find out.
Fill a bottle or commc-n glass with
I your water and let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment or settling indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys;
if it stains your linen it is evidence of
kidney trouble: too frequent desire to
pass it or pain in the back is also con-
vincing proof that the kidneys and
bladder are out of order.
WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy,
fulfills every wish in relieving pain in
the back, kidneys, liver, bladder and
every part of the urinary passages. It
corrects inability to hold water and
scalding pains in passing it, or bad
effects following use of liquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to get up
many times during the night. The mild
and the extraordinary effect of Swamp-
Root is soon realized. It stands the
highest for its wonderful cures of the
most distressing cases: If you need a
medicine you should have the best. Sold
by druggists; price fifty cents and one
dollar. You may have a sample bottla
and pamphlet both sent free by mall
upon receipt of three two-cent stamps
to cover cost of postage on the bottle.

HOT WORDS
EXCHANGED
IN COURT
Attorney James H.
Long Starts Out on
the Warpath.
He Causes an Exciting
Scene in Judge Low's
Courtroom.
Refers to Prosecutor Charles
A. Reynolds as a Con-
temptible Cur.
LONGiCALLED A LOW LIAR.
TJie Defense of Poolroom Men the
Cause pf the Charge and the
Counter Charge.
Attorney James H. Long was on the
â warpath yesterday morning. About 11
o'clock he entered Judge Low's court j
room and after -waiting in a state of
suppressed excitement till a case was j
disposed of he rose and said he had a j
question of privilege to bring to the:
notice of the Judge.
"I have It on reliable authority," said i
Long, "that that contemptible cur there j
(pointing: with his finger at Prosecuting j
Attorney Reynolds) has been clrculat- j
ing reports among my clients that you
are antagonistic to me and that It is j
impossible for me to get an acquittal j
in your court. I want to ask your
Honor if there is any truth in the state
ment;" .
Before the Judge could reply Rey
nolds said hotly: "You are a low, dirty
liar!"
The two stood glaring at each other
. and hostilities were momentarily ex
pected when the Judge rapped for or
der, and, addressing Long, said that he
had no ill feeling against him and
had never expressed any. He had al
ways found hini courteous and atten
tive to his cases and never had any
/reason to complain of his conduct.
Long expressed himself as satisfied]
and that ended the scene in court. Long j
afterward said that Reynolds had j
gone to a number of poolroom men and j
told them not to employ him, as Judge j
Low had it in for him and there was |
no chance of getting an acquittal. He j
instanced the case of ex-Senator Dunn j
of Stevenson street. .
"I defended Dunn several days ago,"
said Long, "and the jury disagreed.
Reynolds went to Dunn and told him
that there was no use in employing me j
and suggested that his friend Hawkins
of! Lennon & Hawkins should get the i
case and an acquittal would follow. 1
The result was that Hawkins was em
ployed and when the case was again
tried last Friday the jury acquitted the '
defendant Hawkins was permitted to
ask the witnesses questions which j
Reynolds objected to when asked by j
me, and I have the stenographic re
port to prove it.
"I am not going to say wherein his
animus toward me lies,. but some people
would like to get three-thirds of your j
fee. That is all I care to say, but any I
one can draw his own inference. Why, j
Reynolds is a constant frequenter of
the poolrooms and is one of their best
customers." . â¢;â  .
Reynolds had a different story to tell.
He said that he learned that Long had j
gone to several pool-sellers : and told
them that if they would engage him
at a salary of $20 a week each he could
protect them from conviction in Judge
Low's court, as he had Reynolds with
him and would share the fees with him.
"As soon as I heard this/ said Rey
nolds, "I went to Harry Corbett and
other pool men and told them that
Long was a liar and advised them to
have nothing to do with him. I did
this to protect myself. I suppose Long
imagined that his proposition would
not reach my ears and he would have
a comfortable drawdown from the
pool -sellers.
"I deny his assertion that I went to
ex-Senator Dunn and made the sugges
tion that he Bhouid employ Hawkins.
Hawkins is a personal friend of Dunn
and that is the reason that he was em
ployed after Long had failed to get
an acquittal. His statement that I al
lowed Hawkins to ask questions of the
witnesses that I objected to in his case
is equally untrue. His assertion that I
am a regular frequenter of the pool
rooms is also untrue. I have not vis
ited a poolroom this year for the pur
pose of betting on the races. The pub
lic can judge between Long and my
self. My charges against him can he
substantiated by any of the poolroom
men."

A Lively Row on Folsom Street
Which Caused Considerable
Excitement.
"Say, y'er not so warm, even If you
do travel with Black Patti. She's not
the only pebble on the beach; there are
others. See!" â 
Just then two colored women, who
are members of the Black Patti Com
pany, suddenly turned around and with
flashing eyes encountered the two
white women who had addressed the
slurring remarks. In answer to a
question if they were "looking for trou
ble?" one of the white women remarked
that she had "been there before," and
did not object to a "mixup."
The next instant hats and hair were
flying in all direction. One of the
white women had on a blonde wig,
which was torn from her head and
hurled in the gutter.. Realizing they
were "up against it," as one of them
afterward remarked, the white women,
without waiting to pick up their hats,
took to their heels, leaving their col
ored sisters masters of the situation.
"You missed de chance of yer life,"
remarked one of the dark Amazons to
her companion. "Why didn't yer put
it on her solar plexus?"
"I had de one wid de wig goin', and
would have put her out de next punch
If dey didn't get next and skip out."
While the colored heroines of the
brief skirmish were congratulating
themselves on how they "put it on
them white gals" Officer Cooney ap
peared and demanded an explanation.
The colored women claimed that they
had been "grossly insulted," and "Jest
to even up matters" they had trounced
their traducers. The white women had
disappeared, and as the officer had not
seen any breach of the peace he al
lowed the colored women to go.
Yesterday Cooney made the follow
ing Feport to Captain Spillane:
"Abc-ut 11:50 p. m. I saw a crowd at
the corner of Sixth and Folsom streets,
and, running to the scene, I saw rwe
j colored ladies and a colored gentleman
walking away. I also saw the Misses
Bowenâ Mollie and Annie â of 928 Fol
som street. They were hatless, and
one of them claimed she had lest her
wig. They both looked as though they
had been struck by a Kansas cyclone.
Mollies hair was hanging down her
back, and she presented a sorry specta
cle.
"Annie was searching around for her |
swell hat, which she had lost in the j
fracas. When she found it the feathers [
were missing and she accused the col
ored women of having purloined them.
Close to the scene of the hurricane bat
tle I found a gold watch, which be
longed to one of the colored victors. I j
have turned it over to the Property
Clerk until the owner can be n<^*'fled.

AT THE STROKE OF TWELVE
Colonel Jefferson Doolittle and Miss Jennings to
Be Wedded To-Day.
To-day, as the city clocks chime the noon hour, Colonel Jefferson E. Doo
little will claim Miss Rebecca Jennings for his wife.
The bride to be Is one of the most popular belles in the select circles in
which she moves. She is dainty, petite and highly accomplished. She excels in
music and is the fortunate possessor of an exquisite voice, besides being a
magnificent performer
Colonel J. E. Doolittle is a prominent mining: operator and one of the
best known club men of San Francisco. His business interests extend all
over the coast States and Territories. Mr. Doolittle has always taken a
keen interest in the National Guard, and when ex-Governor Markham or
ganized his military staif he was cornniissiom-d lieutenant-colonel and aid
de camp, and was retained in that position by Governor Budd.
Dr. Mackenzie is to speak the words that will make the happy couple
one, and only the relatives and imme-liate friends will be present at the
cei'.-monj . The bride will bo attended by Miss Marion Foster, who will act
as maid of honor, and Adolph Spreckels is to be best man.
The bride will wear a dainty gown of white silk, with overdress of white
gauze, sprinkled with tiny forget-me-nots.
Miss FosterÂ»will be attired in white organdie over pink silk. The dec
orations of the home are to be all in pink, and the arbor in which the
binding words will be spoken will be composed of pink fruit blossoms. Af
ter the ceremony there is to be an elaborate bridal breakfast, after which
the bride and groom are to leave for an extended northern tour.

the colored victors. He says they
were accompanied by a Mr. Brown, who
is employed in a clothing store on

COURSING IS BOOMING.
Tempting Purses for Meetings That
Will Be Held on Sunday.
The Interstate Coursing Club. D.
Shannon, president, will hold one of the
largest open meetings of the year next
Saturday and Sunday at Ingleside
Coursiner Park.
At the regular monthly meeting of
the club, held last evening at Pythian
Hall, it was decided to give $600, which
will be divided respectively between the
old and young dogs, as follows: Five
hundred dollars for the old dog Btake
and $100 for the young dog or puppy
stake.
The club investigated charges that
were pending against certain leashmen,
who were accused of unsportsmanlike
conduct, and decided to disqualify the
doe "Bogus," the property of A. Van
derberg, from running at Ingleside
Park in future. Dr. Delhaney and his
dogs were also disqualified, and Welsh,
of Port Costa, will be notified that he
cannot, in future, enter a dog or dogs
for meetings held at Ingleside Park.
Mr. Donnovan, the proprietor of the
park, emphatically states that under
no consideration will he show any
mercy or favor to the owners of dogs
that are "doctored" for the purpose of
winning money by fraudulent means.
The interstate Club, with I. F. Hal
ton, president, will hold its drawing
this evening, and a purse of $500 will
be hung up for the big meetings, which
will be held at the Union Coursing
Park on Saturday and Sunday. E. J.

The Social Democracy.
The regular meeting of Branch 1. Social
Democracy, held in Scottish Hall lost
evening, was addressed by A. H. Sanborn,
who confined his remarks mainly to thÂ«
various phases of patriotism. The speaker
designated the patriotism of to-day as a
worn-out article which may have been
good some years ago, when conditions
were different, but out of place under a
Governrac-nt which Is rapidly being given
over into the hands of tykrannous and
despotic capitalists, who are driving the
people into a condition of slavery. At the
next meeting, to be held on Tuesday,
March 15, James Taylor Rogers will
speak on 'â¢Three Rssentials of Liberty
and Their Preservation."
COLNON SAYS HE
WAS DECEIVED
Bibb Told Him Tales Con
cerning Democratic
Loyalty.
When He Discovered Them
Untrue He Cut Bibb's
Acquaintance.
Other Commissioners Claim That
They Only Worked for the
Public Good.
Harbor Commissioner C.olnon says
that he cut the acquaintance of D. H.
Bibb over two years afro, because he
ascertained that Bibb had deceived him
in matters entirely political..
The statement was made before
Judge Belcher yesterday in the suit
of the Parafflne Paint Company against
the Board of State Harbor Commission
ers, and was intended to offset the tes
timony given by Bibb relative to the
alleged peculiar manner in which Com
missioner Colnon transacted certain
business matters on the water front.
It is not improbable that the work
of â¢ taking testimony will be finished
to-day, to the great relief of the attor
neys and litigants. The suit has been
dragging along heavily during the past
few days, and every one is growing
weary of the hours spent in the court
room.
When the trial was resumed yester
day morning Attorney Tirey L,. Ford
asked permission to make an ex parte
motion. He said that a report had
been received from Chief Engineer
Holmes calling attention to the dan
gerous condition of Speur street wharf,
and that acting under his advice the
Harbor Commissioners had refrained
from authorizing the advertising of
bids for the materials necessary to
put the wharf in proper condition. "We
have no desire to evade the law," said
Ford, "and we feared that unless we
received the permission of the court to
go ahead with the work absolutely re
quired at the foot of Spear street, we
might be adjudged to be guilty of con
tempt. While the injunction suit now
being heard remains undetermined, the
Commissioners will not proceed with
any new work unless authorized by or
der of court."
Judge Belcher replied that he did not
see where any harm could result from
advertising for bids for material re
quired for Spear street wharf, inas
much as the injunction proceedings
were directed against the repairs to be
made at Green, street wharf.
"Then I understand that the com
mission may proceed to advertise for
the piles and lumber necessary for the
work," suggested Ford.
"An order drawn in accordance with
the suggestion of the court wili be en
tertained," replied thf Judge.
"We reserve the right to interpose
in the event of the specifications con
taining any objectionable clauses," in
terrupted Attorney Cope, who with
Matt I. Sullivan represents the Par
afflne Paint Company.
"Such a couree is entirely satisfac
tory to the cwnruiarion," answered
Ford.
An order authorizing the Harbor
Commissioners to advertise for bids for
the necessary work at Spear street
wharf was drawn up by Attorney Ford
and received the approving signature
of Judge Belcher.
Commissioner Harney was then re
called to the witness stand for further
cross-examination. He testified that
he had paid considerable attention to
the matter of creosotlng piles and had
from his study arrived at the conclu
sion that it was the best process to be
used for the preservation of timber.
He said that lie had no knowledge of
a letter having been written to the
commission by the Paraffine Paint
Company guaranteeing that piles pre
pared by it would last for at least five
years and be kept in proper condition.
The letter had been written prior to
his taking office as a Commissioner.
Commissioner Chadbourne, whose
term of office will expire on the 13th
Inst., was questioned at length concern
ing the contracts aworded the S. -E.
Slade Lumber Company. He said that
he voted for the awarding of the con
tract to the company because he
thought the offer made was the best
received by the commission. He ad
mitted knowing William Inglis. hav
ing been introduced to him by Com
misloner Colnon. He also knew D. H.
Bibb, but was not allowed to go into
the details of conversations had with
either Inglis or Bibb, on the ground
that such matters had no bearing on
the case at issue.
"What motives have governed you in
all your acts as a Harbor Commission
er?" asked Attorney Stratton.
"The best of motives," replied the
witness. "I have always exercised the
same care in the matter of awarding
of contracts and the employing of
clerks and other help as any careful
business man would do in looking after
his own business."
E. L. Colnon. president of the board,
was then recalled to the stand by At
torney Stratton.
"Did you have any conversation with
D. H. Bibb after your appointment as
Harbor Commissioner?" was asked.
"I did," replied the witness. "He
came to me and said that he wanted a
share of the lumber contracts to be
awarded by the board, as he was a good
Democrat and had assisted in the elec
tion of Governor Budd. I told him that
I was a minority on the board and that
moreover William Inglis. whose father
was an old friend of mine, had solicit
ed assistance in the same line. I after
ward learned that Bibb had been a
member of the preceding State Repub
lican Convention, and having deceived
me on his political faith I out his ac
quaintance. I have not spoken to him
for over two years. I never sent Inglis
to him. The records of the commission
will show that I have never had control
of the lumber patronage. When Inglis
testified that I told him that I was 'so
tied up' I could not give him part of
the lumber patronage he was mistaken,
for I never had any conversation of
that character with him."
J. J. Keegan. secretary of the com
mission, and Chief Engineer Holmes
were re-called to testify that Attorney
Stratton had always advised that when
bids were not opened cm the day named
in the proposal for bids there was great
danger of legal complications if the
contract was awarded.
Attorney Stratton then announced
that he had several more witnesses to
examine to-day, and that he would be
able to close the case for the defense
unless the cross-examinations were
too long drawn out. â¢

BUSY DAY FOR
GENERAL BOOTH
Talked to a Great Crowd
of the Work of the
Array.
Told of Glorious Accomplish
ments of the Wonderful
Work.
A Helping Hand Given to a Quarter
of Million Persons a
Year.
General Booth spent a busy day yes
terday. The moment he got out of his
bed at the Occidental Hotel he called
his secretary and tackled a large bun
dle of correspondence that had accu
mulated during the time he was con
ducting meetings in Oakland and here.
On his journey west from Chicago he
had his mail addressed to San Fran
cisco, and there was a pile of It. He
hardly stopped to eat. The stenogra
pher who accompanies him was kept
on the jump all 'day long, and when
night came he was not through with it
all. "It was all departmental busi
ness," the officers of his staff said.
"The general is a busy man. He never
has time to rest from the time he gets
out of bed until late in the night. He
is the head of a large army and the
business of it is immense."
The general was hardly through dic
tating to his stenographer when he
| was informed that it was time to pre
! pare for the last public meeting he was
I to conduct in San Francisco while on
this campaign. "You are to meet a
number of citizens who are aiding in
the work of the army before the meet
ing commences," he was told, and he
rattled off the finishing letter to the
stenographer. Then after a light supper
j he was on his way to the California
i Theater to the reception and to the
meeting.
In the ante-room of the theater wait
ing for him were: P. N. Lilienthal, D.
L. Wostover, Orville D. Baldwin. Rabbi
Voorsanger, Daniel Meyer, I. J. Tru
man, B. A. Becker, H. F. Emeric, Al
! Bert Miller and H. H. Sherwood The
| general greeted them cordially and con
versed with thrm for nearly half an
hour on the social work that was con
| template*) by the army in California.
I The Soledad colonization plan was par
i ticularly the subject of the cpnversa-
I tion.
Then the public mooting commenced.
| The great theater was crowded, and
j when, the leader of the army stepped
jon the platform a volley of cheers
! greeted him. The proceedings were
opened by Commander Booth-Tucker,
who after singing and prayers" pre
sented Horace Davis to the audience as
th^ president of the meeting.
Mr. Davis in accepting the honor
spoke of the work of the army and the
success it was meeting with. "All the
world," he said, "recognizes the . good
work carried on by the army. It has
come in a time in the world's history
when humanity never more needed a
helping hand to assist the. myriads of
the fallen to lift them up and assist
them to recover their manhood."
"The Social and Spiritual Work of
the Salvation Army" was the Subject
of the general's address. He told of the
great strides made by the army since
its formation and of the assistance it
was receiving, showing the place it had
gained in the estimation of the people
who were interested in the betterment
of the world. He asked his hearers to
Judge the army by its work. "Do not
judge us by ourselves." he asked. "We
arc not perfect, but we think we are as
perfect as imperfect man can make our
organization. We have met defeat in
places, but our motto is forever go for

the line. We will grow better as we ad

"Life in California Under Spanish
and Mexican Rule" was the subject the
Rfcv. Joseph Gleason of St. Rome's
Church lectured oh last evening at
Metropolitan Temple before the mem
bers of the Young Men's Institute.
The lecturer, commencing from the
earliest history of the Sta,te, told of the
neglect it received while under the ex
clusive control of the Spanish Govern
ment . and the progress which imme
diately took place after th? Jesuit
piitsts, under the direction of Father
Keno. assumed the task of subduing
the natives and establishing^ colonies-
"At this time," said the lecturer, "the
State was populated with tribes of sav
ages of the worst kind, and there was
little or none of it known, except that
portion now called Lower California.
''In Lower California at the time
Father Kc-no was granted permission
Ly the Crown Prince of Spain to take
Up the task which he had totally aban
doned,, civilization was unknown, and
when he signified his intention of con
verting the savages and instituting
missions, the Government laughed at
him and refused to aid him in a use
less project." ;
With this as an introduction the
speaker gradually and logically unrav
eled the whole. fabric of the earlier his
tory of the State, speaking of the cx
puision. of Jesuits from all Spanish
and Mexican lands after they had
striven and accomplished their efforts
of civilizing the natives and infusing

IN THE POWER
OF HER ENEMY
Mrs. Maria Parenti and
Her Children Disap
pear From View.
Taken From the City Prison
by the Accused Slayer of
Her Husband.
Louis Palo Presents an Order From;
the Sheriff and Secures the.
Woman's Release.
Mrs. Maria Parenti, who with her
Six little children was driven from
her home Monday, and forced to seek
shelter in the City Prison, is in the
hands of Louis Palo, the man who was
charged by a Coroner's jury with hav
ing poisoned the woman's husband.
Palo is believed to have safely hidden
his charges away, for up to last night
their whereabo-uts could not be ascer
tained, and none of the woman's neigh
bors on Vincent place, where she for
merly lived, had heard anything of hel
since she and her children were driven
away in a patrol wagon.
After being taken to the City Prison
the homeless family were provided with
food, of which the little ones partook
ravenously, but the mother was too
overcome with the hopelessness of her
position to more than nibble at the
homely provender placed before her.
She could not understand that shÂ«
was taken to jail merely that she and
her little ones might be given shelter,
and her protestations of innocence ot
any crime were mingled with demanda
for her release. Poor woman. She ev
idently believed that everybody was,;
leagued against her, and so, when dur-
I ing the evening, Palo presented him
self at the prison gate with an order
from the Sheriff for her release, she
forgot that but a few hours before she
had denounced him as the slayer of her
husband, and only saw in him her de
liverer from prison. ;
Hastily collecting her children togeth
er, uhe followed Pajb out thn.-ugh the
McAllisters-street entrance, and the lit-"
I tie group was lost in the blackness of
the night. "Where they went tb none
of the woman's friends can tell, but
they shake their heads ominously when
told that she has gone with Palo.
Michele Td.no,. the man who has been
placed in possession ot the house at 7
Vincent place that Mrs. Parenti still
believes to be her own, and which she
defended so valiantly against the Sher
iff's deputies, who were sent to dispos
sess her, has little to say regarding the
proceedings, beyond the statement that
he had bought the house and was glad
the woman had been put out of it.
Asked if he knew where, she had gone,
he replied that he neither knew nor
cared, and he also, professed to be ig
norant of Palo's whereabouts. When
an attempt was made to question him
as to when and how he had come to
purchase the property, the price he had
paid and to whom he paid the money
he evaded answering by claiming that
he could not understand, although it
was not difficult to make him under
stand the other questions. He wouM
not say whether he intended to sell the
place, but referred his questioner to
his lawyer, Thomas S. Molloy. Mr.
Molloy was out of town yesterday and
consequently nothing could be learned
from him. ..".â .â â¢..'â " : : V ; -
Palo up to a short time before Par
enti's death occupied the upper portion
of 'the Vincent place house, but for
some reason he was ordered to vacated.
It was given out by the Parentis that
he could not pay his rent, but it was
rumored that his ceaseless attentions to
Mrs. Parenti caused her finally to tell
her husband, and for that reason Palo
was expelled from the hoiase.MORE APPROVAL.

I\ S. APPRAISER JOHN T. DAREâ No person appreciates Cali- â

observer of our extraordinary resources, both natural and acquired. â¢
Put in the ordinary course of affairs a comparative few come of their
own volition to .rur hospitable State to witness and realize those abun
dant resources. Therefore it becomes our bounden duty to attract the
vast majority by extraordinary measures, and, to my mind, no better
â  way could be evolved to bring people here than by giving a grand ex
â  posUton, as meritoriously suggested by The Call, and, as a matterof fact,
- it is the only proper way to bring about the desired result.
It is a matter of history that, after anyone has visited California
- and wen what she has to exhibit in the way of cli
- mate ami the varied products erf her prolific soul, the for
â  tunate beholder immediately becomes either a Oalifornian or a pro

its career. Its birth was attended by j
no phenomena, its death did not stir
the nation, its burial belongs to the fu
ture.
Perhaps it is well to explain that the
Lance was a daily paper for three sue- \
! cessive days. Then it became a remin
! iscence. Few people ever heard of it, i
fewer had the elevating pleasure of j
'seeing it, yet the Lance had been
I hurled, and now, like the relic of a
tilting joust, it lies in the dust.
The first symptom of the prospective
paper was a circular announcing that
a metropolitan paper pas to be issued I
I at the cost of 1 cent. It is a plain prop- :
osition that a paper not worth a cent
can never hope to win its way to fame.
[ The head, front and nerve of the ven
ture was Cornelius F. Davis, whose j
long association with the Youths' Com- j
panion had fitted him for the task. As
to the brawn, Mr. Davis could of
course purchase this. There is a rumor
that the brawn in question still yearns
vainly for the pay that never came, j
One employe, however, was thoughtful :
and secured the shears when the crash
arrived: These instruments constituted j
the only piece of office furniture ac- j
tively available as assets.
Mr. Davis is evidently an optimist. ;
Under his direction thie sheet made its j
initial appearance Thursday. It was |
out agaiiv Friday. Saturday it showed
as bold a face as possible. Saturday ;
I evening while preparations were under j
!' way for a Sunday edition designed to j
paralyze and blight the dailies already j
in the field. Davis entered the sanctum, |
and said there would be no edition on j
that date. It was. at this juncture a!
. youth ' erf bulging brow seized the j
! shears.. ' The rest of the force did not j
I even get an installment of pay. They ;
. got promises, non-negotiable.
However, Davis is not as one who j
mourns without hope. It is true that
the printer demanded money in ad
vance; it is true the purveyor of white
paper manifested a spirit equally sor- j
did, and that Davis rebuked them both
by refusing to comply, and yet he
threatens to revive the Lance and try i
another assault upon the ache which
marks the familiar void. All he needs i
is a millionaire, and he thinks he has !
one in tow. Meanwhile, there is a no- !
tice on the door of the deserted sane- i
turn setting forth in effect that the ;
| Lance is not dead, but in a trance. "At
| any rate," says the notice, "there will
I be no paper to-day." â  But as to other
days the statement avers naught. <

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 2, 1898.
F. F. RYER IS
BADLY WANTED
The Young Millionaire Is
Again in the Meshes
of the Law.
The Sequel to the Failure of
the West Coast Plumbing
Company.
Claims Against â¢ the Defunct Corpo
ration Are to Be
Pushed.
When Judge Daingerfleld calls the
case of the Riverside Iran Works
against F. F. Ryer et al. Friday morn
ing, an old scandal with new interpo
lations will arise to set the tongues of
the commercial and financial people of
San Francisco wagging once again.
Shortly after the failure of the West
Supply and Plumbing Company to meet
its debts and the declaration of insolv
ency, F. F. Ryer, one of the chief stock
holders in the company, came into an
immense fortune, an inheritance from
his father. The contesting attorneys to
the petition of Insolvency then thought
that Ryer was eitheradirector or pres
ident o-f the company, but Ryer swore
on the stand that he was neither one
nor the other, and that he was in no
way responsible for the debts of the
corporation.
Ever since the original trial Critten
den Thornton has been on the hunt for
evidence which would tend to prove
that Ryer was really president of the
defaulting concern. In that capac
ity Ryer would be liable for the debts
of the corporation. Thornton alleges
that he has conclusive and absolute
proof to show that Ryer not only acted
as president, but was president in no
mine.
Ryer is now in New York. For some
time previous to his departure he was
' pursued by a number of angry claim
! ants, all laden with summons for depo
: sitions and appearances in court. Al
j lied with Ryer at the time of the orig
inal action were Louis E. Arnold and
; Charles S. Arnold. Louis E. Arnold is
| now in South Africa, a prosperous con
! ductor of a very profitable business. It
was he that was indicted by the Grand
Jury at the time of the exposure in
1 1893. Thornton is reaching out for the
I partner, sojourning in foreign climes, as
well as Ryer. On Monday night Mrs.
Arnold was served with a subpoena to
appear in court on Friday. It is
claimed that she knows a great deal
about the matter that the plaintiffs
need for their case.
To prevent the issue, Thornton,
Merzbach were served yesterday with
I a notice that the Ryer and Arnold ag
gregation will ask for a commission to
take a deposition of Louis E. Arnold in
South Africa. If allowed, this will
postpone the trial.
STAND IN WITH MERCHANTS.
Supervisors Will Not Tax the En
trances to Under-the-Street
Stores.
The special committee appointed by the
Board of Supervisors to consider the mat
ter of street signs, sidewalk entrances to
underground establishments and other
matters, decided yesterday to report in
favor of the ' indefinite postponement of
the measure.
Members of the Merchants' Association
represented to the committee thai to im
pose a special tax would work a hardship
on many merchants who had spent con
lerable money in altering their prem
â Â«. It was shown that in Eastern cities
such tax is imposed on the entrances
under-the-street establishments and on
3 representation the committee decided
recommend the indelinite postponement
the ordinance.

An Incorrigible Sentenced.
Judge Wallace yesterday morning sen- j
tenced James Hall, a colored boy 19 years j
of age, to ten years in Folsom for an of- i
fense Of grand larceny. The crime for j
which the youth will go to State's prison
was committed in 1594. At the time the
crime was committed the prisoner was
sentenced to Whittier Reform School, but
after being released from that institution
he failed to obey the law, and, in conse- i
quehce, must go to prison.

Mrs. Pinkham Says Standing Still is One of jBffrÂ«'?ijf
Woman's Most Trying Tasks. >r /
Have you ever thought why it is that so v^feg^Â«|igJLiLiNrlB S^
many women or girls rather walk for an hour JJ l jjffiffgPjfflp|fsWisl
than stand still for ten minutes ? MBÂ»^fflHNp jÂ« H
It is because most women suffer from some MSfitlSi^^^tf
derangement of their delicate organism, the 'dSUHI^^HP^^
discomfort from which, is less trying when *| BP
they are in motion than when standing-. JB|l||b|V
So serious are these troubles and so dangerous to jS&S&S&S^
health that the laws in some states com- . jfflffigf?|jÂ§H?i||jik
pel employers to provide resting places for yS^^^SÃrQ-JESjQ'f'TiSk
But no amount of law can regulate v^tlP^^^^fiiiP^/Pi^s^^fi^J* *
the hard tasks of these women. Cus-
tomers are exacting, and expect the .Â£gS WÂ§j&z^/j^^^[^{\u^//f
saleslady to be always cheerful : â â 'â¢ -

be cheerful when her back is â  "''<c=sr aching, when she is as-
sailed by lassitude and bearing- v I-L Tl a â down pains? No mat-
ter how sweet tempered she is s^~ ' naturally, her nerves give
way under the pain after a while, ; r^^^^ggglf Employers, however, don't

important capital, and no one can be | Â» amiable when racked with pain.
If you are ill or suffering, write without delay to Mrs. Pinkham, at
Lynn, Mass., and tell her all about yourself. Your story will not be new to
her; she has heard it thousand times and will know just what you need.
Without doubt, Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will help you, it has
done such wonderful things for suffering women. Do not hesitate to write her
all the little things that make you feel miserable. Your letter will not be seen

PHELAN ANXIOUS
ABOUT FUNDS
Calls the Auditor's At
tention to School
Moneys.
Thinks That the One-Twelfth
Act Should Be Ob
served.
Laws Quoted to Show That School
Directors Have Been
Derelict.
Mayor Phelan has stated in a letter
to Auditor Broderick that a large de
ficit was imminent in the funds of the
School Departments-and has asked that
some means be taken to prevent use
of public funds except aa provided by
law. He quotes statutes which he
claims cover the subject and says that
it is absolutely imperative that the
School Directors be required to observe
the plain letter of the law. The com
munication is as follows:
February 28, 1898.
Hon William Brorterick, Auditor, City
Hall, San Franciscoâ l ear Sir: It appears
from a recent report as to the condition
of the finances of the City and County
that there will be a probable shortage of
$100,000 in the School Department fund at
the end of the current fiscal year. This
condition is due to a failure of the Board
of Education to observe the provisions of
the act of February 2a, 1878, commonly
called the "one-twelfth act. and of sec
tion 4 of the act of March 30, IS6S. (Stat
utes of 1867-68. p. 558), which is as follows:
geeg ec 4 it shall be the duty of the Committee
on" Finance and Auditing of the Board of Edu-
IdurlnK the ui'-nth of July every year,
lie on annual estimate of all revenue
Isbursi-ments of the School Department
c current fiscal year, specifying sepa
the amount of funds necessary to defray
Terent items of expenditure for the first
st half year; and in no case shall it be
for the 'said board to exceed, during the
alf year the estimated Item of expendl
or that period, or in the entire year the
es collected for school purposes. All
Â» or unexpended funds of any half year
>c available for expenditures of the fol
half year The Auditor and Treasurer
onform strictly to the provisions of this
The segregation contemplated by this
section was made by the Finance Com
mittee of the present board in October
last and I presume you are fully in
formed, as head of the finance department
of the city as to the condition of the sev
eral subdivisions of the fund.
Itisabsolutclv imperative that the board
be required to observe the plain letter of
the law. as contained in the acts above re
ferred to, in order that the teachers may
not be compelled to wait for their salaries
at the end of the fiscal year.
In this connection I beg leave to call
your attention to the fact that Auditor
Strother, during his incumbency of your
office, returned to the Board of Education
without his approval demands allowed by
them in excess of the limitation, prescribed
by the above quoted act The reasons for
his action are fully stated in a letter bear
ing date January 14, 1885, on file with the
clerk of the Board of 1-Mucatlon. Respect
fully. JAMES D. I'HELAN, Mayor.

WAGNER AS A MYSTIC.
Lecture by Mrs. Alice Cleatlier and
Basil Crump.
The works of Wagner and their hid
den meaning was the subject of an inter
esting lecture last evening by Mrs. Alice
Leighton Cleather and Basil Crump. ,
During the lecture the hall was in dark
ness except for the light from a stereop
ticon with which the speaker's words
were illustrated.
Mrs. Cleather spoke first, her remarks
referring to Wagner as a poet, a musi
cian and a dramatist, and his effect upon
the musical schools of the world. She
analyzed his character as shown in his
music and in his prose works, and showed
where his wonderful dramas had a- sig
nificance beyond the mere dramatic situ
ation and the absorbing story. She
showed how" his works were really
dramas of the soul and his knightly he
roes, his heroines and his unconquerable
warriors were personifications of the hu
man will, of passion, of love and the
higher characteristics of man as well as
the lower. Basil Crump referred more
particularly to the master's life, the evo
lution of his genius, his struggles for
fame and success and his progress toward
them. , ,
Mrs. Cleather appeared a second time
to speak of Wagner as a philosopher and
a mystic teacher, and in doing so she
quoted freely from his prose and fre
quently referred to his music to lend
force to what she was saying. â¢ â Mr.
Crump "closed with a summary- of the
great scene's in Wagner's dramatic works,
and as he proceeded- the pictures on the
screen changed, to portray the situations
he called to mind. '. ' '
During the intermission Mrs. Cleather
and Mr. Crump gave on the piano and
the organ several selections ' from Wag
ner's most famous works. ,

OUR CANNED FRUITS IN ENGLAND.
Mail advices from London to February 12 re
port: Samples of the new season's California
fruits which recently arrived by the Rajore
have been obtainable during the week, and
satisfaction is generally expressed as to the
quality of the out-turn. Demand is brisk at
the advanced price?, and with a decidedly firm
tendency another advance is spoken of. fur
ther arrivals are anxiously awaited, an<l anx
iety is expressed at the non-arrival of the
Ho'wth which has been over five months out.
This vessel has only *fi23 cases of fruits on
board, but many of these are "extras. which
it would be difficult or impossible to replace.
Other vessels which should shortly be heard
of are the Combermere, with nearly 20,000
cases and the Pericles with about 26.000, all
from this port. The Pericles has arrived since
above was published.
CALIFORNIA FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
: Referring to dried fruits Commercial Ameri
ca of February 21 reports the New York mar
ket as : follows: Probably the most active ar
ticle on the. list are California prunes, j es
pecially the extremes, large and small sizes,
both of which; are rather scarce. â  A fair-
Blze lot of ) 90s- to 100s was sold on Saturday
at 3%c in bags. .- This size in 50-pound boxes
Is generally held at 3%c, but some are still
obtainable at 3%c. Holders regard it as a
good sign, that the market is clearing up from
the bottoms. There seems to be little doubt
that 90s to 100s are extremely scarce, and an
â early "advance In the quotation may reason-,
ably be expected. There is an upward ten
dency in â  the price of 40s also, some dealers
holding their stocks slightly above .current
quotations.. California loose muscatel raisins
are dull and prices vary greatly, according to
quality, there being a majority of. rain-dam
aged goods â  among the supplies. Quotations
for- choice loose raisins In .50- pound boxes are
as follows: Two-crown, 3@3Uc; 3-crown, 4&@
4%c; 4-crpwn, 4%<Â§5%c. On Saturday a good
demand was reported for. seedless muscatels
at 3ViÂ«?4%c. and supplies are being reduced
to comparatively small proportions. One large
handler of sultana raisins advanced his prices
for cleaned on Saturday. Seeded raisins are
father quiet and easy in consequence of the
competition of seedless.. In: this connection it
' might be -stated- that one cause of the- dull
ness of currants Is the fact; that seedless rais
ins are being used considerably in their stead.
California dried pears are selling well, chiefly
for- export. Some fancy quarters, were sold
for shipment abroad Saturday at Be. Prices
range froth- 6%c. to 8c for choice to fancy
quarters, and â¢; from B%c to 9%c for halves.
Cheap California- peaches are still in good de
mand, and it is â  said that quite a block was
â  Bold to Philadelphia on Saturday at s%.i{i's%c.
Few-are to be found here now ..below 6c.

Isobar?, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres- ;
lure -and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains;. "Lows" usually i
first appear on the Washington coast. When .
the pressure is high in the Interior and low L
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north '
aiid south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im- I
frobable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
daho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March I.â The stock market
took on no. well-defined character to-Jay unti!
after the publication of the statement at
tributed to the Secretary of the Navy that
the element of Spanish official responsibility
for the Maine explosion might be considered
to be eJtmlnated from the situation. This was
In the last hour of the session and the whole
short interest apparently rushed to cover the
short lines that have been put out In the last
few days on the developments of the Maine
disaster. There had been covering of shorts
early in the day on account of the continuance
of yesterday's movement, but a little teter
short selling; developed on the theory that the
market would certainly, sag again after the
large short interest had been covered. The
market had apparently swung to a standstill
and was drittinK rather uimlessly, without
yielding, when a buying' movement set in on
the Long statement and the trading took on
all the appearance of a runaway bull market,

a net rise of 13 points. Tills stock closed at
161. Manhattan, Sugar and New York Central
were also conspicuous In the movement, the
former showing an extreme advuni-e of five
points and the latter two rising three points
each. The whole list felt the upward move
ment to a very noticeable extent. Buying tor
London account helped the strength in the
early dealings. There was some recovery In
Spanish securities in London and this seemed
to restore confidence to some extent over the
relations between Spain andÂ«the United States.
Buying was resumed for London account
and in the face of a continued hardening of
the money market in London. The inquiry for
gold for American account in London and in
Paris is reported to be still very keen, but
no further engagements of gold were an
nounced.
The bond market was somewhat more active
to-day and prices were higher all round.
Total sales, $3,600,000. . United States new 4s

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Marclv I.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were. generally quiet to-day, but
there was a revival of speculative activity in
Americans and Grand Trunk. Americans were
largely bought and the close was near the best.
A rumored, arrangement of the Canadian Pa
cific rate war was not confirmed. Grand
Trunk was good on the monthly statement.
The other markets were featureless. Gold Is
quoted at 77s luVid and in strong demand, but
the best Informed incline to the belief that
the New York drain of gold from here will
not be large. . . â 
A few eagles will leave the Bank of England
to-day. The hank has raised the buying price
in German and Japanese coin to 76s 4Vjd. There
18 a large amount of Japanese yen in the mar
ket, but it is not likely that the bank will
secure it, as outsiders bid at 5d for export to
the United States. Money rates are rising.
There are revived rumors from good sources
In India of a possible increased importation
of silver. : â¢
The Bank of England again lent largely to
the market to-day. I learn In â  good quarters
that most of the money : raised by the Chinese
loan In Berlin will be remitted rapidly to Lon
don. Anticipations of this caused to-day's rise
in Berlin exchange.
The Paris Bourse wns dull, except for Rio

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March I.â Although news from
Liverpool was distinctly disappointing, the
opening in Wheat was strong, July starting <4
Sj\c higher and May unchanged to Vie higher.
There was quite a good demand from shorts
who bad not covered yesterday, and the de
mand from this source was sufficient to over
come any natural weakness of the market.
The fact that Liverpool had lost Its slight
opening advance before trading commenced
here and that receipts of Wheat at the Eng
lish markets during the last six days were up
to the normal weekly requirements had the
effect of bringing out liberal offerings, wiping
out the opening advance. Some support was
given by Leiter and other prominent bull in
terests, and this brought the more timid
shorts into the pit. In addition there was cov
ering of a line for St. Louis houses. Prospects
of a cold wave following rain throughout the
winter Wheat belt had some influence, May
getting up to $1 05 and July to 90Â»sC. Then the
market reacted and prices tended downward
for some time. Bradstreet's reported the
world's visible decrease . at 3,r.16,CÂ«i0 bushels.
This amount was fairly twice as much as the
irade expected and brought in a fresh lot of
buying orders and resulted in an advance In
July to M%c and In May to $1 05. In the last
twenty minutes' trading the Leiter forces
started things going with some lively bidding,
and prices climbed in a hurry. By closing
time May had advanced to $1 Ob I ,*. July rose
to SaVÂ»c, but reacted Just at the close to Sl^c.
Corn developed a good deal of strength. The
close was %c higher for May.
The market for Oats was dull. May closed
%c higher.
Provisions became strong near the close. May
pork closed 24c higher, May lard 2^c higher
and May ribs 7Vfcc higher.

FEBRUARY BANK CLEARINGS.
NEW YORK. March I.â Bradstreefs says:
February bank clearings, as reported to Brad
streefs. point to an immense volume of busi
ness done In the country during the past
month. The total clearings, though naturally
enough smaller than January's record break-
Ing totals, were evidently so, only because of
February being a short month, and because
of a holiday Etill further curtailing the time
available for business transactions, for the
reason that tho average daily clearings were
larger than those of January and the month
ly total was heavier not only than for any
previous February on record, but larger than
most months of normal years.
Tho total dearlnss of 77 cities of the 1 nited
States for the month aggregated fefiSS.o
smaller by 7 per cent than those of January,
but larger by 51 per cent than February last
year; 75 per cent in excess of the low. water
mark of IM4 and 6 4 per cent larger than in
18*2. the heaviest February on record.
For the two months of 1898 the total clear
ings aggregated $11,527,000,000. a total larger
by 42 per cent than the corresponding period
of last year; 59 per cent larger than 1594 and
nearly â¢; per cent larger than the first two
months of lsr-3, a period of very heavy totals.
Only two cities of the country show Increases
as compared with February of last year.
Canadian bank clearings were also very
heavy. aÃgrrp K ating $110,396,665, a decrease of 2.6
per cent from January, but a gain of 49 per
cent over February last year.

Oakland Office Sari Francisco Call,.
90S Broadway, March J.
Louise Clj.oloco is dead, and although
her death is almost as much of a mur
der as that of : her lover, the slayer will
probably go free. Louise was the only
; witness to the frightful tragedy that
ended in the death of Antone Silva, and
the Indian maiden died yesterday of a
broken heart.
The girl only lived seventeen years,
but into the last few months, has been
crowded more bitterness than is. seen
In many lives with the figures reversed.
For two months the girl has refused
to be comforted. When her lover was
being buried she fell across the casket
at the graveside and wept bitterly and
refused to be consoled. She had to be
carried to a carriage, and from that
time the little maiden has longed for
the happy hunting grounds, where her
Indian lover had gone before her. Last
evening her wish was gratified,
The crime that robbed Louise of her
lover was particularly atrocious. She
was the belle of the Indian settlement
near Pleasanton and had many beaux,
but Antone Silva was her choice and
she was to marry him. There lived
near the camp a half-breed named Eu
lalia Gonsalves, a revengeful fellow
who had a bad record. Gonsalves was
jealous of Silva, and declared that if
he could not win the Indian maiden he
would prevent Silva from marrying
her. One evening, as Silva and Louise
were out for a walk, Gonsalves hid in j
a hedge, armed with a club. As the
lovers passed the half-breed rushed out |
and used his club on Silva : s head. He j
<1M not cease till Louise's lover was a
corpse.
The frightened girl ran home and
her friends captured the murderer in
the hills. He was examined and is
now awaiting trial in the County Jail.
He will probably never have to answer
for his brutal crime, as there was no
other witness than the girl.

STILL AT THE CROSS-ROADS.
Oakland Office San* Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 1.
The citizens of Oakland have a week
before them in which to try to se
cure some recognition from one of the
two Councilmen, each of whom holds a
key to the situation. Much has been
said about the fact that Messrs. Bros
nahan and Woodward do not consti
tute the whole body; and while this
is true it is also true that the remain
ing four of the six have done just what
was expected of them. They did not,
as did Brosnahan and "Woodward, mis
lead the public into believing that they
would do other than they have done,
and consequently their consistency, ex
ecrable though it be, is acting some
what as a shield for them from public
indignation.
Next Monday night a large portion
of Oakland will be present to see
whether honor and decency are more
valued by either Woodward or Bros
nahan than other things. At that
meeting it will not be too late for either
man to undo the mischief he has al
ready begun. Messrs. Earl, Heitmann.
"W'atkinson and Henneberry can be
fully depended upon to carry out the
part of the programme for which they
were elected, and to do which they
have been encouraged since election.
Woodward and Brosnahan, according
to their own stories, by which they
at present stand condemned, were not
elected for any such purpose, and have
caused it to be made known that they
intended to be honest when the water
question came up. It is a secondary
matter as to what caused them to
change their intention, but when the
infamous ordinance comes back for
final passage, they can show which of
the two roads thai are now open to
them they will take.
The police department is being se
i from house to house must pay $15. The
general business license will be $2 50, with
$2 50 for each wagon used. Wagons with
3-inch tires or under will be $10 per an
num and over that J>s per annum. Banks
I must pay $50 instead of $10 as now. Street
cars $5, instead of $2 50. for each car, and
: the gas company $250, instead of $50 as at
! present.
Water Bates.
ALAMEDA, March I.â The City Trus
tees at their meeting last evening adopted
water rates for the ensuing year. There
: was no protest by any one and consum
i ers have little complaint to make. The
j rate for domestic use is 30 cents per 1000
I gallons, with a minimum charge of ?1 a
i month per meter. The only change made
' was in the supply for city use in sprink
i ling streets and parks, flushing sewers
and for school use. This was cut from
!30 cents to 15 cents per 1000 gallons.
j Otherwise the rates were unchanged.
An Old Man Robbed.
ALAMEDA, March I.â The house of
Charles Stehn, at the corner of Jefferson
and Market streets, in a remote portion
i of the city, was entered some time yester
j day during the absence of the proprietor
' and robbed of some articles of trifling
value. It is only a few weeks since the
I same house was entered by a man who
â  pretended he wanted a drink of water,
! and who stole $56 in coin that was hidden
I under a pillow. Stehn is reputed to be
well off, and to this fact is doubtless due
; the visits of the thieves.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 2, 1898.
verely censured to-day for the disgrace
ful showing it made last night. Chief
Lloyd will probably have to answer to
the Commissioners for his plain neglect
erf duty. In the Council chamber when
Brosnahan showed that he was irre
sponsible and used language that would
not be tolerated without provoking a
fight in a water-front saloon, It waa
clearly Chief Lloyd's duty to place him
under arrest. Especially was it his
duty to do so when told by President
Pringle to put Brosnahan out of the
Council chamber. It was certainly a
very humiliating spectacle to see an en
raged Councilman push the Chief of
Police away, tell him to mind his own
business and leave him alone, and for
such Chief to obey. This evening one
of the local papers which has hitherto
always rushed to the defense of Chief
Lloyd, says: "There was abundant rea
son for arresting Brosnahan in the
Council chamber; he was guilty of in
toxication and of disturbing the peace.
But even though no arrest had been
made then, there should have been aft
erward, when it appeared that he was
carrying concealed weapons on the
street and causing fresh disturbances
of the peace. But instead- of that he
was allowed to defy the president of
the Council and the police, as well as
to insult d y by his foul-mouthed
obscenity r:d blasphemy. After the
adjournment, when he left the City
Hall and started down the street, the
police who were present (including the
Chief) acted practically as a body
guard to escort him safely from saloon
to saloon on his devious way home
ward."
In his own defense, Chief Lloyd says
that he considers that he acted for the
best interests of all concerned, al
though he admits that he did not an

Estate.
Peter Christensen's Will Is
Now in the Dead- Letter
Office.
A Stockton Mystery That Has si
Solution In This
County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 1.
A story from Stockton, published In
to-day's Call, throws some light on a
claim recently made by Andrew Crow
of Hay wards. It concerns the disposi
tion of an estate valued at over $100,000
left by an old bachelor named Peter
Christensen.
For many years "Old Pete," as he
was known, lived a lonely life on his
ranch near Waterloo, In San Joaquln
County. He died a few weeks ago and
so far as is known no heirs are living
in this country. The Public Adminis
trator is now in charg-e of the estate,
no will having been found. It is known
that the old man had a will prepared
some time ago, but no one in San Joa
quin knows what it contains.
It is now stated that "Old Pete" made
a WIU several years ago and left all his
property to the late Judge Baldwin of
Stockton. Since the death of the Judgt?
the document was mailed to Christen
sen, and after lying is the postofflce at
Stockton for thirty days it was sent to
the Dead Letter Office at Washington,
where it is now.
Kffoits are being made to get the im
portant document and it is said that it
will give large bequests to old friends
of the eccentric miser.
The oldest friend of the eccentric
rancher is Andrew Crow of Haywards,
who is a poor man. He tells a romantic
story and says he is undoubtedly the
beneficiary under the will of Peter
Christtmsen. Crow says that a long
time ago his father was good to twp
little orphans â Peter Christensen and
his sister. Peter went into the world
but never married. He was successful
and soon accumulated valuable prop
erty. He lived with his sister till she
died and after her death he notified
Andrew Crow, the son of his benefac
tlclpate such a riot, and says he did not
know until after Brosnahan left the
City Hall that he was armed.
The water companies are not showing
their usual diplomacy at this time, and
their partial success seems to have in
toxicated them with an ambition to en
rage the public even before the new
rates go into effect. They are now
charging full legal rates, but it is not
at the payment of this that the public
is enraged; it is that the present legal
rates would produce such a generous
income that any additional rate is ab
solute robbery. This fact is best es
tablished by the figures given out by
the company to individual rate-payers
on this, the first day of the month.
They show that in a majority of in
stances the companies have been
charging just one-quarter of what they
could have charged legally. Many peo
ple who have hitherto paid 50 cents a
month to-day find their bill is from $2
to $2 10. When before the Council com
mittee Messrs. "Watkinson and Dingee
stated that they had collected during
the past year about two-thirds of what
the law allowed tht-m, and on this
showing the ordinance which was in
troduced by th# committee was
based.
It now appears from the complaints of
numerous customers that they were
charging a little more than 25 per cent
of the legal rate, and that had they
charged full rates even under the pres
ent ordinance their income would have
been princely. These facts are increas
ing the popular indignation, and great
pressure will be brought to bear this
week upon either of the two likely
Councilmen to have the ordinance
amended back next Monday night so
that it will be the original ordinance
introduced by the committee.
tor, that at his death ho would leave
his property to the Crow family. Crow
has the letters from Christensen and is
confident that when thf will is found
he will get what the old rancher prom
ised him.
Endeavorers at Work.
OAKLAND, March I.â The coming State

OAKLAND. March 1.-The Builders-
Exchange has given up its commodious

reason for this move. An office wfll be
opened in the rear of Pierce'B hardware
store, where the secretary -will have his
desk.

A SUCCESS
The Management Deny
That They Will Lose
Any Money.
The Report of Wrangling
Among the Directors Is
Also Untrue.
The Ancient Order of United Work
men Wftl Take Possession

With the exception of the opening
night and the Maine benefit, the largest
crowd that has yet attended the Min
ing Fair was present yesterday. The
attendance of school children and ladies
In the afternoon was by far the largest
of any, and the features were the most
pleasing. At night the League of the
Cross Cadets under the command of
Colonel W. P. Sullivan attended four
teen companies strong with their band.
After they had paraded around the Pa
vilion, Company A, under the command
of Captain F. S. Brady, gave an exhi
bition drill. Lawrence, the trick bicy
cle rider, and the Lazello Brothers were
the features last night.
The management of the fair is very
indignant over a report published in
one of the afternoon papers, in which
it is stated that the fair has been a
financial failure. Assistant Superin
tendent Buckley said last night:
"There is absolutely no truth in the
statement as published in the Bulle
tin. We do not expect to lose a cent,
and if there is any loss it will be insig
nificantly small. There has been no
wrangling among the directors of the
fair."
This evening the Ancient Order of
United Workmen will be in attendance
at the fair. The exercises will consist
of a parade, short speeches and a com
petitive drill. The following is the pro
gramme:

Welcome Rains Benefit
the Market to a Great
Extent.
A Renewed Demand for Coun
try Lands Augured by
Recent Sales.

Sale 3 and Notes.
The welcome rains of the last few
days have done much to wash away
the cobwebs from the real. estate coun^
ter. When the farmer prospers, the
prospects of this city brighten propor
tionately, and the real estate line is
never in the rear. As yet values show
no material improvement, nor is any
expected for some time, but the sales
are increasing. Dealers are greatly
encouraged at the outlook. ;

NAPAMAX WON
BY A HEAD
Took the Handicap From
Ostler Joe in a Very
': ' Exciting Drive.
Of Six Favorites Sent Out
Fashion Plate Alone. Was
Beaten.
Geyser Easily Defeated Ton Rose in
a Sprintâ Slo'aii. Was in Good
form.
The finish to the mile handicap be
tween Napamax and Ostler Joe was the
only stirring feature of the racing at
Ingleside yesterday. In the betting
the former, with Clawson up, was a
pronounced favorite, while 14 to 5 was
laid against the black horse, which had
Tod Sloan in the saddle. Refugee away
from the post badly was allowed to go
out and make the running to the
stretch, with the favorite and second
choice under wraps back in the bunch.
Straightened for the wire Clawson cut
: loose with Napamax, and Sloan on
Ostler followed suit. In a terrific drive
Clawson got his mount over the mark
first by a head in the remarkably fast
time, considering the slow condition of
: the track, of 1:42 V Better rated the
winner should have won handily.
It was a great day for favorites,
every first choice, with the exception of
Fashion Plate, scoring a pair of brack
ets. . The track was still heavy, which
. accounts for the slow time made in the
different events.
Charley Thorpe began the day by
piloting the 8 to 5 favorite, Prince Ty
. rant, to victory in the opening seven
furlong run for three-year-olds. In
front from the start, the first choice
: won. easily from Bow and Arrow, a
12 .to 1 chance. Flanders, the second
choice, could not untrack himself, fin
.. ishing back among the also rans.
The five and a half furlong scramble,
with King William scratched, proved
a gift for Torsion, which went to the
post at odds of 1 t0. 4. Holly's gelding
quickly showed in front after the start
; and won handily from the 30 to 1
: chance Viking, ridden by Spencer.
Durward was a good third.
.The. Burns . & Waterhouse entry,
Gold Scratch, opened a favorite for the
two-year-ofd scramble over three and
:; a haif furlongs, but on the report gain
â¢V Ing credence that Ezell's filly, Buena
Ventura, was the goods, the latter was
played down to favoritism. Gold
, Scratch receded from 6 to 5 to twos.
Hennessy, on the first choice, breaking
from the post second, skimmed away in
the lead and hard ridden at the end
downed Canace two lengths. Cut off
soon after the start. Gold Scratch fin
ished in the show. .
Fashion Plate was a lukewarm fa
vorite for the mile selling run, but did
not seem to have her usual supply of
speed, and Hennessy, who had the
mount, was fortunate to finish in the
show. Satyr, the second choice, ridden
by Sloan, won handily from O'Fleta, a
12 to 1 shot, with Thorpe up.
But three started in the final, five and
a half furlong sprint, and one (Roy
Carruthers) might as well have stayed
at home. Geyser, a lieht favorite over
:'â¢ Tea Rose, won in a common gallop, af
ter the latter had led Into the stretch.

LEAGUE OF THE CROSS.
Members of the St. Joseph Branch
Give a Successful Enter
tainment.
Another successful entertainment was
added to the many that have been held
this year, under the auspices of individ
ual branches of the League of the Cross,
last evening at St. Joseph's Hall, by the
members of the St. Joseph branch. The
little hall on Tenth and Howard streets
was crowded with a large and apprecia
tive audience and there were few empty
chairs to show the lack of enthusiasm on
the part of residents in this part of the
city in manifesting a desire to foster the
great principles upon which the organiza
tion Is based.
A programme of unusual excellence was
rendered and many prominent local fun
makers were named upon it who con
tributed their services toward making the
evening a pleasant one for those who at
toinded the entertainment for no other re
muneration than to help the boys of this
branch of the league along in their ef
forts to have their parish well repre
sented In the cadet regiment.
C. L. Asmussen, the speaker of the
evening, delivered an eloquent and In
structive address upon the subject of
temperance, outlining In the expansion of
the subject the happiness derived from
total abstinence and the misery and de
gradation consequent upon the habitual
use of liquor.
Immediately after and at the conclusion
of the address the following programme
was announced:
Remarks. C. L. Asmussen: piano solo, H. H.
Hay; vocal solo. Miss C. Stanley: grand chorus.
boys under the direction of Brother Aloyslus;
recitations. Dr. J. P. McCarthy; Irish J:g.

STORM BREWING IN TURF CIRCLES
Edward Corrigan and President Androus
at Outs,
W. B. Sink, a Heavy Stockholder in the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club, Criticises the
Management,
The few snatches of tart repartee In
dulged in by President S. N. Androus
and Ed-ward Corrigan. Master of Haw
thorne and of Ingleside. at the latter
track on Monday are apt to cause some
serious complications in the director
ate of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club
ere the spring flowers bloom. For
gome time it has been whispered that
the officers and directors of the local
track were not the happy family peo
ple of the outer world supposed. Rac
ing folks from the East say Ed Cor
rtean hung his old motto of "Rule or
ruin" on the walls of the club office in
the Palace Hotel, and that now the
foreshadowed storm is brewing.
When S. N. Androus. president of
the club, offered the suggestion to the
Master of Hawthorne on Monday, ac
cording to current rumor, that a harrow
might prove beneficial to the surface
of the track and the latter in an angry
mood told him to attend to his own
business, it is just possible the big
Chicago horseman overplayed his hand.
At any rate, the incident is the theme
most discussed in turfdom at present.
Neither of the principals in the little
afflair could be seen last evening, but
W. B. Sink, a prominent horse owner
and one of the largest stockholders in
the Ingleside Association, very reluct
antly consented to be interviewed on
the internal dissensions existing in the
club management.
Said Mr. Sink: "In the first place you
may say that I wffl sell all of my
horses. Two are already as good as
sold, and the others will go as soon as
purchasers can be found. I have al
ways paid my trainers' salaries and
jockey fees, but when it comes to a
stage when I cannot start my horses
in the races in which they are entered
it is time a man got out of the busi
ness. As the sport is how conducted at
Ingleslde it is nothing more than a
'skin game' "'â â â â ..
When questioned as to what treat
ment brought him to this determina
tion when he was apparently infatu
ated with the game Mr. Sink con
tinued:
"My hnrse Alvarado is a hard animal
to get away from the post, and I in
formed Secretary Green that it was
paid that starting a horse over the
hurdles improved the animal's disposi
tion and asked him whether if Alva
rado were entered in a jumping race
he would be allowed to start, and he
answered in the affirmative. On Sat
urday last Alvarado was entered in the
hurdle event. In the morning of that
day. he worked through the stretch in
25 seconds, which fast work was ob
served by Ed Corrigan. A little later
the secretary received word by tele
phone from Corrigan to scratch Alva
rado. On going to the track my train
er asked me if I had; scratched the
horse, and I told him no. On inquiring
of Mr. Green the reason, he said,
'Well, Mr. Cqrrigan ordered him
scratched.' "
"Are there other reasons for your
withdrawal from the turf?" was asked.
"Yes, there are," replied Mr. Sink. "I
consider that many races are made up
for Corrigan's horses or his friends, and
on other occasions horses are scratched
to make safe betting propositions.
Take the last race yesterday, for in
stance. Do you suppose that race
would have gone through had it not
looked a certainty for Geyser, with
three horses going to the post, one of
them a 250 to 1 shot?"
Mr. Sink then said that he thought
he had been wronged all through the
meeting, and intimated that he had
heard that Mr. Corrigan had been heard
to say that "none of Sink's horses
would ever win a race if he could pre
vent it by scratching out." He dated
the antipathy cf the Hawthorne turf
man toward himself from a time some
two years back when he gave a note
given by Corrigan to a bank for collec
tion. "It was paid." said Mr. Sink,
"but I lost his friendship."
The injured stockholder then went on
to relate what he considers the fallacies
of the Western Turf Congress. "Now,"
said Mr. Sink, "what becomes of this
$25 that is required of trainers for a
license before they can start a horse
at Ingleside? What becomes of the
hundreds of dollars collected from
Jockeys for fines? It is sent on to
Latonia and that is the last heard of
it. There was no reason why Ingleside
should have been placed under the
Jurisdiction of the Turf Congress. The
California Jockey Club races under Its
own rules, and the sport at Emery
ville is good enough to suit the most
fastidious."
Mr. Sink then s.ald: "I guess I have
said too much already, but as long as
I have consented to be interviewed you
can say that if President Androus,
Vice-President Crocker and the other
officers of the club allow Corrigan to
act In the role of dictator, running
things to suit himself, after the first
of May my stock will be for sale in
blocks from five shares to six hundred
shares at par valuation.
"If Corrigan is deposed, I will retain
It and consider it money well invested.
There is no need of talk about adverse
legislation; the present management
will kill off the sport soon enough.
Friends in the East tell me racing will
never be allowed in Cook County, Illi
nois, as long as Corrigan is financially
interested In the tracks. He is said to
owe money on unpaid markers in the
betting rings here," continued Mr.
Sink, "but of this I know nothing."
Sanborn, Vail & Co. have the only
large stock here of Screens, parlor
lamps, onyx tables, framed pictures and
easels at moderate prices. â¢
Bohemian Club Election.
At a special meeting of the Bohemian
Club yesterday afternoon Thomas Pen
nell, A. Gerberding, E. R. Dlmond, John
Landers and G. W. Fletcher were elected
a committee to nominate a regular ticket
to be voted for at the next annual elec
tion of the club. Two tickets for com
mitteemen were in the field. Mr. Pen
nell. whose name was on both tickets, re
ceived 128 votes.
ANOTHER BIG
DROP IN RATES
Canadian Pacific Contemplat
ing a Further Cut of $1O
on Through Travel.
Self- Preservation Will Soon Force
the Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe to Cut In.
CHICAGO. March I.â The Canadian
Pacific road is contemplating another
sensational cut in North Pacific Coast
rates. When next it applies the knife
it will, If reports are true, take an ad
ditional cut of $10 off the rate. It was
understood that this cut was to be
made as soon as the American roads
actually put in effect over the lines the
reduced rates it made in the first place
ten days ago. So far, however, there
has been no official announcement of
the new cut. Whenever the Canadian
Pacific makes the announcement the
American lines, it is expected, will
meet the new rates. The American
lines seem to be prepared to follow the
cut down to a dollar if necessary to
protect business. They are apparently
in for a fight to a finish and the offi
cials hint that should the contest be a
prolonged one the Canadian road may
find itself shut out from doing business
in American territory. An agitation in
that direction has begun and Congress
is in session.
When M. M. Stern, local agent of the
Canadian Pacific, was questioned re
gardingtheabive dispatch, he said that
as yet he had received no advices look
ing toward such a move, though noth
ing that might happen particularly in
the territory of the northern lines
would greatly surprise him. The .inten
tion of the Canadian Pacific is to^llow
matters in San Francisco to remain as
they are now unless some new move of
its competitors should necessitate a
corresponding one on its part.
Said Mr. Stern: "As long as the pres
ent rate of busin-ess continues we are
perfectly willing to stand by our pres
ent rates. The increase has been so
material that we are perfectly content
ed with the existing conditions, and,
providing the run keeps up, we can
stand this thing for the rest of our nat
ural lives."
The steamer Walla Walla, first of the
vessels that will run on the new five
day schedule from here to Vancouver,
leaves to-day with a nearly full pas
senge~ list.
The O. R. and N. are selling through
tickets from San Francisco to New
York via steamer to Portland for $52
first class and $36 second class. This
rate is made up of the $12 and $6 steam
er rate from here to Portland and the
$40 and $30 rate from there to the east
ern terminal over the Northern Pacific,
Great Northern and trunk lines.
Though Vice-President J. C. Stubbs
of the Southern Pacific says that noth
ing new has developed In the situa
tion and that the loss that his com
pany will sustain on their through
travel by the action of the Canadian
Pacific Railroad is so trifling that it
will not be necessary for them to en
ter actively in the war as far as San
Francisco is concerned; yet the opinion
of other competent railroad authori
ties is very different. They claim that
neither the Southern Pacific nor the
Santa Fe can stand quietly by and see
all of the cream of the travel turn
from them and go over the northern
roads* and that it is but a question of
time when both those roads will be
forced into the fight for their own self
protection and, when they do, things
will come down with a drop that will
make somebody either weaken or
break.
The whole street is at present on
tenterhooks waiting for something to
happen, though where it will come from
or what it will be, when It doeÃ come,
are at present only matters of conjec
ture.
TO HELP THE JEWS.
Inception of a Movement to Find a
Home for the Persecuted.
A representative audience of the Jews of
this city assembled in B'nal B'rith hall
last evening to organize a Zionistic socie
ty and to learn its objects.
The movement is one at present active
among the Jewish centers of the world.
It has for its object the transportation
to Palestine and the maintenance of all
persecuted Jews wherever found. In cer
tain countries of Europe where the Jew
is denied the privileges of citizenship and
even the rights of Justice, they are emi
grating: in targe numbers to colonies in
the Holy Land where, at the expense of
the Jewish race, they are assisted until
their lands are fruitful and they establish
a home. The result of last night's meet
ing- was the formation of one of these
Zionistic societies in this city.
The programme prepared included sev
eral musical selections, but among them
were addresses by various rabbis of the
city, explaining the motives of the society
and calling for their assistance. Rabbi
M. S. Levy spoke first. He said that the
Jfw who had found in this county so fair
a home could well afford to lend his aid
to him who was persecuted and reviled.
What the Salvationists had done In Sal
inas for their Christian brothers he was
sure the Jews could do for their brethren
in Palestine.
Rabbi Isidore Myers, the founder of the
movement in this city, told of his per
sonal observations of these Jewish colon
ies in Palestine, and of the persecutions
from which they had fled. There are 100,
000 acres, he said, which form a home for
5000 Jews. They are contented and happy,
and he believed that the nucleus of a
haven of refuge for the Jewish race had
been formed by them. They are not try
ing to establish a government, he said,
but are only seeking a place where they
will be let alone.
Rev. Dr. Mosessohn followed in a sim
ilar strain, and then cards of member
ship in the society were sent around
among the audience. Within a few min
utes over 200 of these had been returned
bearing name and address, and promises
of liberal subscription. A meeting of
those whose addresses were sent in will
be called within a few days and the so
ciety will then fully organize.

The Spirit of '98 to Control

California Is Bound to Aid Ma

WUI Assist in Building a Monument
in Dublin to "WolfÂ© Ton* and
Other Patriots.
Jeremiah Mahoney, president of the
'98 Centennial and Monument Associa
tion, has cabled to Dublin: "Califor-
nia will contribute at least $2000 for the
monument fund to Wolfe Tone and the
heroes of '98." The reason for his
cabling was that on March 4. next Fri
day evening, there will be a great cel
ebration there to start subscriptions to-

ward the movement, and the Dublin
executive desired to know what might
be expected from California.
At the last meeting of the associa
tion in this city a letter was read from
Dublin, stating that the monument
would cost about $50,000, and Mr. Ma
honey was instructed to answer as to
California's contribution of the above
sum. The association in this city has
been organized for some months, and
in that time subcommittees have been
formed in different centers.
At Juneau, Alaska, a committee Is
working under the presidency of Mar
tin Conway. The Los Angeles com
mittee is doing good work with Judge
Ryan as president. There are com
mittees also at San Jose, Oakland, Val
lejo and other places, so that it is ex
pected that a considerable sum will be
realized. The St. Patrick day conven
tion recently decided to add the sum
realized by the celebration here to the
amount raised, and this will be hand
ed over to the '98 association. Con
sidering all these sources it is expected
that the sum of $2000 will be easily
realized.
The sentiment among Irishmen to
ward the men of '98 is a deep and abid
ing one. There are few Irishmen but
who have traditions of that period In
which their forbears figured with pike
and staff against the British soldiery.
It was a time of frightful persecution
and no part of the island was exempt.
A few years before Grattan's volun
teers had everything their own way
and the crown promised legislative re
forms of all kinds and freedom of wor
ship. Then England had her hands
full, however. Cornwallis was penned
up in this country and the French
were carrying everything before them.
The promises were never kept after
the volunteers disbanded. But in place
bigotry was sown among the people.
Men who had been as brothers in the
volunteers became deadly enemies.
To remedy this was the mission of
Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen.
They worked against British gold, and
were working successfully, to the dis
may of the Government. The only
plan that Pitt and Castlereagh could
desire, therefore, in order to hold the
country, was to precipitate the rebel
lion, and this was done. The leaders
were arrestedâ Lord Edward Fitzgerald
and other gallant souls â and the poor
people were crushed, not before they
made a splendid campaign, however.
There were many patriots in the differ
ent courts, and the rebels were treated
!in the most Inhuman manner. It was
a reign of terror for the people, and
they were treated with the greatest
savagery. In Wexford the main fight
ing occurred, and, notwithstanding that
the people were without leaders, with
out arms or supplies of any kind, still
for over two months they held their
own against the British regulars. It is
related by impartial witnesses that on
several occasions they fought with such
desperate courage that, although far
outnumbered, thsfy yet drove before
them the well drilled and equipped reg
iments of Cornwallis â veterans of the
Revolutionary War in America.
The latter part of August the French
landed under General Humbert. Mat
thew Tone Wolfe, Tone's father, was
with this auxiliary force, and he suf
fered death in consequence, and is in
terred alongside his brother at Bodens
town. The French were very success
ful, and at Castlebar defeated four
times their number, and in such man
ner that that battle has since been
called the "Castlebar races." Not be
ing reinforced, however, and being in
constant action, the French force was
finally captured. Afterward came an
other French expedition, and on this
expedition Wolfe Tone was captured
and died in prison.
All over the world the Irish are cele
brating the centennial of '98. In Ire
land the celebration will begin in May,
and each place where a battle was
fought will have a local celebration.
August 21 next the corner stone of the
monument will be laid on Grafton
street, facing Stevens Green, Dublin,
and there will be a monster procession
and banquet, etc. On the 28th of Aug
ust at Castlebar there will also be a
great demonstration. This will be na
tional, and the descendants of the
French officers and men who took part
have been invited. There will be il
luminations all over Ireland, and cele
brations on a grand scale all over the
world, in fact.
From the enthusiasm shown by the
Irishmen of California, it is certain they
also will take proper part in these ob
servances, and the celebration here on
St. Patrick's day will be the central
one on this coast. The literary commit
tee Is now preparing a programme, and
it promises to be a very fine one in
deed. The exercises will be held at
Woodward's Garden day and evening.
FORCED TO
SURRENDER
HIS MONEY
Bucolic Stranger Held
Up by Three Men on
Grant Avenue.
Joseph King, an Ex-Con
vict, Was a Party to
the Crime.
Arrested on Suspicion of Bur
glary Confesses His Share
in the Robbery.
KNOWN AS A BAD MAN.
Two Policemen Overlook His Mask
Which He Had Secreted in
His Sweater.
Joseph King, the ex-convlct, who was
arrested Monday night on suspicion of
being one of the burgars who have been
operating in Oakland, will have to an
swer to a charge of burglary commit
ted In thiÃ city. Last Friday night
King and two other men, who have not
yet been arrrested. held up a bucolic
stranger on Grant avenue and robbed
him of a few dollars and a gold watch
and chain.
The robbers were masked, and as
their victim appeared King, at the
point of a revolver, ordered him to
throw up his hands under penalty of
being made a subject for the Coroner.
He was then forced into a doorway,
and while King held the revolver to his
head his companions in crime relieved
him of his money and watch. After
taking his valuables the desperate rob
bers ordered him to "skip out" or suf
fer being riddled with bullets. The un
fortunate man, realizing that they
meant business, took to his heels and
disappeared down Sutter street.
Immediately after the robbery King
and his confederates entered a saloon
on Grant avenue, near Bush, and se
creted the evidence of their crime. A
few minutes later Police Officers Fen
nell and Colen, who had been apprised
of the robbery, visited the saloon, and,
recognizing King, they proceeded to
question him. He denied that he had a
hand in the robbery, and offered to
prove by several men, who were pres
ent, 'that he was in the saloon at the
time of the holdup. The officers
searched him for a weapon, but jover
looked a black mask, which he thrust
down the neck of his sweater immedi
ately after entering the saloon. .
Last night Detectives Bee, Harper
and Sullivan were scouring the city for
the victim erf the daring holdup. They
think that he has left the city. The
two other men who participated in the
robbery are well known, and the de
tectives are hopeful of arresting them.
King is regarded by the police as a
desperate character. To use his pet ex
pression, he is always ready to "take a
chance," even if it leads to murder.
DISCUSSED THE
TUBERCULIN TEST
Dairymen in Conference With
the Board of
Health.
Marin County Millc Ranchers Are
Preparing to Make a
Fight.
A preliminary meeting looking toward
the adjusting of the local milk question
was held in the rooms of the Board of
Health yesterday. Legal representatives
of the dairymen of Marin. San Mateo,
Alameda and Contra Costa counties were
present, as well as a number of San Fran
cisco milk dealers. The main matter under
discussion was the proposed quarantine of
milk from adjoining counties where the
cattle have not been subjected to the
tuberculin test.
\V. W. Foote, representing the dairy
men of San Francisco, stated that it
would be a hardship to his clients, whose
cows had all been tested,- unless the cat
tle in adjoining counties were subjected
to a like ordeal.
Inspector Doekory stated that during
the past year several thousand cows in
this county had been tested, and that
while he had sought to introduce the test
in Marin, Sonoma and other counties, the
lack of funds had prevented the matter
from being a success.
General John H. Dickinson, representing
the dairymen of Marin County, stated
that some time ago a concerted effort was
made in Marin County to weed out dis
eased cows, and that since that time
21,703 cows had been inspected and 204
condemned and killed. General Dickin
son stated that the tuberculin test would
cost the county from 80 cents to $1 for
each cow, and that the county could not
stand such attacks on its resources.
"Rather than submit to such a law,"
said General Dickinson, "we will fight.
I believe that the next Legislature will
deal with this subject, and that laws can
be passed that will not be a hardship on
the dairymen.
It was suggested that a meeting be held
on Tuesday next for the purpose of fur
ther discussing the matter.

with constipation in its severest form. So acute, in fact, at times, as
v to produce dreadful headaches that, notwithstanding all the outdoor
work afforded me by my vocation, and the : latitude it allowed me to '
test my . pedestrian < abilities â which is supposed .to be a successful
manner of displacing constipationâ I was very often compelled to"
forego my pursuit of business. Constipation with me seemed to â¢

measures, but found' no cure to be permanent. In 1892 while con- *
