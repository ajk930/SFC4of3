Li Hung Chang Severely Scores
the Kaiser for Grabbing
Kiaochau.
Says China Has Not Recovered From the
Effects of the Late War, and Protests
Against the Tactics of
Europe.
LiONDON, Jan. 2.â A sensation has been caused by a rumor from
Plymouth that the English Admiral has fired on a Russian man-of
war in Chinese waters. Nothing is known as to the rumor at the
Foreign Office or the Admiralty.
The morning papers publish also the statement that England is
pressing China to declare Port Arthur a free port.. It is supposed the
presence of British war-ships there is intended to insure freedom of
access for trading vessels.

â _
;: PEKING, Jan. 2.â According to in
structions received from the Herald I
-.. obtained an interview with Li Hung
Chang and told him that the New-
York Herald offered him the publicity
of its columns for any statement that
â¢China might care to make to the
western world in respect to the actual
crisis in the East.
The great statesman received the
Herald's correspondent very cour
teously, and replied that China was
willing and even anxious that western
c should understand thoroughly
.matters as they were, and that he
" could not wish for a better medium for
-nting China's case, both to
America and Europe, than that of-
I him. His Excellency then spoke
Follows:
"The forcible occupation of Kiao
ehau by Germany is a direct violation
*'t>Â£ existing treaties and of interna
. tifinal law. The pretext made for this
: war was the murder of two mis
9Ties by robbers in the interior
province of Shantung:. The Chinese
rnrrient offered immediate and
.'full redress for this outrage â the pun
â¢.â¢ ishment of the criminals, dismissal of
â  local officials and large compensation
â¢ for ail lo^seÂ«.
Anxious to avoid hostile acts, the
Chim-se troops were withdrawn from
Kiaochau when the Germans landed,
â and in spite of the strong public feeling
prevailing throughout the country for
the defense of Chinese territory against
aggression, my Government has not
' sent reinforcements to Kiaochau.
"Outlaws exist in China, as in all
countries. Neither treaties, law or re
ligion can entirely suppress the crime
anywhere in the world, though they
condemn and punish the criminals.
There are places in every country
Where lawlessness abounds, and to
such a place in Shantung German mis
sionaries determined to go, knowing
that the inhabitants themselves were
often victims of these bandits.
"UniortUnately, China has not yet re
covered from the effects of the late
war, and our country requires a period
of peace to carry out the work of re
form lately be^un.
"Of late year?, from instruction and
riVis^-rvation, the Chinese have come to
r-ogard the countries of the Western
world as models, and even greater in
"justice than in arms. Is it just to op
presa us while we are struggling to
emerge from the restraints of our an-
.:â  < -ient civilization, while improvement
. nd progress steadily continue? Should
China be distressed by having her
; iehores invaded and her territory occu
because of an occurrence which
Western countries would deal with by
law and not by warâ an unexpected in
cident, deplored by my Government
And followed by full redress?
< >ur desire is to preserve- our ter
ritory intact and to steadily improve it

MUCH INTEREST IN
THE DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE FAR EAST.
General Miles Says the Policies Being In
augurated Are More Significant Than
Any Military Movement in the
World's History.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Naval and military officers
stationed in Washington are displaying
as much interest in developments in
the far east as are the diplomatists
whose countries are directly concerned
in the matter.
Major-General Miles, commanding the
army, sees the ultimate extension of
the influence of European powers in
South America General Miles only
recently returned from an inspection
of the various armies of Europe, and
his statements are well worthy of con
sideration. In discussing the situation
with me to-day he said:
'â¢The measures and policies being in
augurated by at least three of the
great powers of the world at the pres
ent time are more far-reaching, more
significant than any movement of mili
tary character in the whole history of
the world. They affect the commerce
of the world and the future jf millions
of the human race more than any event
which has yet occurred.
"If a few of the great powers can
dismember a country occupied by vast
ly superior numbers, to their own ag
grandizement and in their own com
mercial and political interest, will such
action not, in the near future, serious
ly affect the welfare, and especially the
foreign commerce of the United States?
The influence will likely be felt first
by our neighbors in South America.
Hence the words of Washington seem
to be doubly wise when he warned us
against foreign entanglements, and. at
the same time, admonished that in time
of peace prepare for war."
Military m^n who understand the
European situation say there is a
grave liability of European war result
ing from the dismemberment of China.
I In such an event, they say that Tur
key must be considered as an import
ant factor. Official information has
reached Washington which shows that
Germany has entered into a warm
friendship with Turkey, and that the
j Sultan's government may be depended
upon to join Germany, Austria and
Italy, which form a triple alliance, in
any war which may occur in the near
future.
CHINA IS FURTHER
HUMILIATED BY THE
GERMAN EMBASSADOR.
Demand for the Dismissal of the Command-
ant of the Chinese Garrison at Tsao
chau Is Complied With.
BERLIN, Jan. 2.â Tt has been an
nounced that China has yielded to the
demands of Baron Heyking, German
Kmbassador at Peking, for the dismis
sal of the commandant of the Chinese
garrison at Tsaochau, province of
Shantung, because of the use of the
insulting language to the German mis
sionaries there. The Chinese Govern
ment has telegraphed a dismissal of
the commandant.
According U) a dispatch on Satur
day, Baron Heyking in making his de
mand for the dismissal Of the com
mandant, insisted that a copy of the
telegram of dismissal should be laid
before him by 6 o'clock the next even
ing. The Tsung Li Ynmen requested
j the Embasador to grant them until 8
o'clock that evening (Saturday) before
making a reply to tho demand, where
upon he threatened to leave Peking.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 2.-It is an
nounced that Kuril Alexieff has
been intrusted with full power to pro
mote the development of the commer
cial relations between Russia and Ko
rea in competition with British and
Japanese influence*, and to aid in fur
thering the prompt construction of the
projected orthodox church at EfeotlL
The Novoe Vremya, commenting upon
the respective positions of McLeavy
Brown and M. Alexieft under the com
promise effected by an arrangement
according to which the two will work
the Korean customs together, says:
"Nobody will regard Mr. Brown as the
representative of the British flag. He
is a mere official in the service of the
Korean Government, directing the cus
toms. M. Alexieff will attend in a
'higher sphere as adviser to the Ko
rean ministry of finance."

PANAMA, Jan. 2.â The trouble be
twÂ© n Costa Rica and Nicaragua has
taken a new phase, according to ad
vices from the Herald's correspondent
in Managua. The Costa Rican Consul
to Managua has been sentenced to
five years' Imprisonment, and has fled.
The Costa Rican Consul to Man
agua, Senor Eduardo Beeche, was ar
rested in that city on September 17
of last year and imprisoned. The
charge against him was complicity in
a revolutionary movement against
President Zelaya. Senor Beeches ex
equatur was canceled at the time of
his arrest. Senor Beeche was in prison
for several weeks, despite representa
tions made by the Costa Rican Gov
ernment to Nicaragua to secure his
release. Costa Rica demanded that
proofs against her Consul be pro
duced, but the demand went unheed
ed, though finally he was released on
bail.
Considerable friction between the
two Governments was caused, and
this was followed by an interchange
of several sharp notes. There were
reports that both Nicaragua and
Costa Rica were quietly preparing for
war, and these reports, 1 am able to
state, were not altomther unfounded.
Finally, despite the protests from
Costa Rica, the trial of Consul Be"eche
by court-martial began. President
Zelaya swept aside Costa Rica's de
mands, and a few days ago the court
martial sentenced the Consul to five
years" imprisonment This sentence
was kept secret until yesterday.
Senor Beeche in some way learned
of this sentence about a week ago,
and immediately left Nicaragua,
though there was a report that he
would be pardoned. It is supposed

LEFT DAWSON IN
MIDWINTER FOR
MORE SUPPLIES
Forty-Five Klondikers Arrive at
Seattle in Quest of Needed
Provisions.
Sold What Food They Had at Exorbitant Prices
and Will Return Well Stockedâ New
Strike Made^ on Quartz
Creek,
SEATTLE, Jan. 2.â The steamer Co
rona came into port to-night from
Dyea with about forty returning Klon
dikers. These miners bear 8-dditional
testimony to the shortage of provisions
in and about Dawson, which district
they left to avoid the pang>.*)f hunger,
which must inevitably come to a large
proportion of those who remain
through the winter. Few of these
miners are old-timers, who have been
in the Yukon country for from two to
four years. Most of them, however,
went in during the past spring and
summer, and, rather than run the
chances of not getting enough to eat,
sold their provisions at a big price,
with the intention of purchasing and
again taking in large quantities of
provisions.
There are various estimates as to
the amount of money that these re
turning men bring from the Klondike.
It is safe to say, however, that $75,000
will cover the full value of gold dust
and drafts brought out.
"Happy Jack" Felix, who originally
came from New Bedford, Mass., but
who spent a number of years in Seattle
and on the coast, was one of the Co
rona's passengers. He went into the
Yukon country nearly four years ago,
and for the past year has been mining
in the Klondike district. To The Call
correspondent he expressed himself to
night in positive terms on the neces
sity for more provisions reaching the
Yukon miners, if starvation is to be
avoided. He said:
"Next spring will witness the great
est scarcity of provisions ever known
in any mining camp in the world's ex
perience. During the winter many men
will barely exist on such common nec
essities as flour, beans and bacon.
Why, miners are already living on one
meal a day. It is not sufficient to
give them strength to work, and as a
consequence the output of gold will be
largely decreased. However, I think
many millions of gold will be brought
out next spring.
"When you ask me whether there will
be starvation, I can say that men in
that country don't believe in starving,
especially as they have the money to
pay for food. There may not be many
deaths from starvation, but if not life
will be lost in the effort of many to
get food from their more fortunate
brothers. Hope still prevails that some
of the dog trains that went down the
river to Circle City and Fort Yukon
will return with provisions, but so
many men have gone to those places
that I am perfectly satisfied there will
be no supplies to transport to Daw
son.
"You tell me that many returnnig
Klondikers report that there is ample
food. I don't know why they should
say this, for it certainly is untrue.
Why. the day before I left Dawson,
which was on November 23, I was in
Alex McDonald's cabin and he bought
less than 200 pounds of flour, for which
he weighed out $400 in gold dust.
"The seller was leaving the country
because he did not have enough food
to last him until next summer. Would
such high prices prevail and would so
many hundreds of men come out unless
the shortage was being felt? I think
not, for there is plenty of gold there,
and that is what miners went in for. I
own three quartz claims on Adams
freek and several placer claims. On
January 15, 1897, I bought a half inter
est for $8500 of claim 2 below Dis
covery, on Bonanza Creek. We now
have the whole claim bonded to Berry
Bros. & Knowl of Oakland, Cal., for
$150,000, payable in cash on June 1, but
that is almost giving it away.
"We have twenty-two men working
the claim at $1 50 an hour, and the
amount in sight almost equals what
we offered to sell the claim for. There
is not a tributary of Bonanza or El
Dorado, but is a paying proposition.
Bunker Creek is showing up fabulous
wealth. There is a pay streak ICS feet
wide on the flats that at six feet shows
from $3 to $7 to the pan. Other rich
creeks are Too Much Gold, All Gold,
Dominion and Sulphur. A great lot
of men are on the trails trying to get
In, but during the cold weather their
packs are proving such a burden that
but few will succeed in accomplishing
their purpose. I won't start back be
fore March 25. and that will be plenty
early enough."
John Williams of Skagit City, Wash.,
was one of the last to leave Dawson.
Before Mr. Williams left four build
ings had been destroyed by fire. The
! first blaze broke out about 2 o'clock in
J the morning of November 25, and de
i stroyed the opera-house, dance halls
I and meat market. Other than a small
i quantity of meat no provisions to
| speak of were lost. But very little im
: portance was attached to the fire. At
j Klondike prices the loss might have
been $30,000 or $40,000, but the owners
of the buildings are well able to stand
it.
Williams said to The Call cor
respondent that the men who arrived
to-day expected to return as soon as
possible with big packs of provisions.
Not only was food scarce, but it was
almost impossible to get candles with
which to work.
"The different streams are rich with
gold, and there ..will" be some big r^J
price rrvE cexts.
turns in the spring," he continued.
"Among the late discoveries is Qulgley
Creek, which is between Bonanza and
Bear.
"Men are leaving the Klondike dis
trict because of the fear of starvation.
None are now going to Fort Yukon,
but hundreds are coming out over the
trails. We passed a number at Five
Fingers, Big Salmon and the different
lakes, although most all were on the
other side of White Horse Rapids."
"If the Government can succeed in
sending in food to the miners ut the
Klondike it will prove a godsend to
them," said W. Casey of Seattle to
night to The Call correspondent.
"While I have doubts as to the suc
cess of the expedition, it certainly
ought to be attempted. There is al
ready great need of food, although
nothing like starvation. Hunker and
Dominion creeks are panning out well,
and will make many fortunes. All
gold creek, a branch of the Klondike,
shows 40 to 60 cents in gravel and at
bedrock from $3 to $4 a pan."
In June last George Hummell of Au
burn, Wash., went to Dawson with
others. He located a claim on Sul
phur creek. He recently sold his inter
est for $8000 and, on November 25, left
for Seattle. He witnessed the burning
of the buildings.
Hummell advises prospectors not to
think of going north for three months
yet.
A returning Klondiker, Zach Hick
man of Seattle, has good claims on
Dian Creek, but comes out for provi
sions, expecting to return with a good
supply in the spring. He states that
the discovery shaft of Dian Creek was
sunk on November 2, four and a half
miles from Dawson.
RUSH TO QUARTZ CREEK.
Miners Desert Paying Claims to Locate in
the New Diggings.
PORT TOWNSEND, Jan. 2.â Among
the returning Klondikers was F, Har
mon McConnell, stepson of State Sena
tor Boyce of California. Mr. McConnell
is a young man of good address. He
is on his way to San Francisco, his
home. He went to Dawson on the
first trip of the Portland. Arriving at
St. Michael he shipped as purser on
the steamer Weare, disembarking at
Dawson, in which vicinity he remained
until November 24, when he, with
Henry Kern, the brewery man of
Dawson City, and three mining men
left for Dyea. The other three are
Jensen, a Monte Cristo mining man;
Henry Cook of San Francisco and a
man named Sanders of Seattle. The
trip out was uneventful and the party
arrived at Dyea on December 24, or
twenty-seven days' actual traveling
time. They are all out on business and
will return in a few weeks. Said Mr.
McConnell:
"About ten days before I left news
was received at Hunker Creek that a
big strike had been made at Quartz
Creek, a tributary of Indian Creek. It
was reported that $5000 had been taken
out by two men in twenty-four hounk

jftaja^ seems almost in-
credible but it is
ss^~ true. Men feel
and realize that the most relentless enemy
of - mankind, consumption, is slowly but
swiftly creeping upon them. But in the mad
race for money they refuse to stop and drive
off the dread disease. It would require a
sacrifice of both time and money and so
vhey neglect it, until it is too late.
There is no excuse for this. A sure and
quick remedy is at hand. Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery cures 98 per cent,
of all cases of consumption. It remedies
all disorders of the digestion. It invigor-
ates the liver. It makes new rich blood
and builds up firm healthy flesh. It enters
the blood and drives out all impurities, and
acts directly upon the lungs driving out all
disease germs. It builds sound vital tissue
in the lungs. Thousands have testified to
their cure by this wonderful remedy after
they were given up by the doctors and all
hope was gone. Druggists sell it.
"I have taken Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery, and can and do recommend it every
place 1 go," writes Mrs. J. D. Graves, of Sala-
manca, Cattaraugus Co., N. Y. (Academy Street).
"I am a traveling saleslady and have been for
eighteen years. When I find people who are
afflicted I "tell them what Dr. Pierces medicines
have done for me. Twelve years ago I was given
up to die. I had what all my physicians called
consumption. I had hemorrhage of the lungs,
night-sweats, and in fact I fully realized my con-
dition. I begged of them to let me try the
4 Golden Medical Discovery,' and the result is, I
still live and do lots of hard work."

NEW GOLD DISCOVERIES.
Number of Locations Filed on a Creek Two
Miles From Dawson.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Dec. 20, via Seat
, tie, Jan. 2.â The steamer Corona
brought down about forty more Yu- i
Iconers 1 on City, but as none
of them left there since November 24,
the day before the Bre, they were able
to add very little to what has all
been told. They had heard of the fire j
on th'ir way down and understood j
that Dawson was burning. They say
that the starvation reports are con
flicting, and as tv th^ prices now
charged their statements vary. C. P.
Banders of Seattle said that before he
left he sj> in provisions for his
partners, paying $1 10 a pound. There ,
had been a number of men going in j
who were quite willing to sell for this '
price, and, after their hard work in
gett:: er the trail, they
â¢would be foolish to sell for less. There
some who. of course, would stint
themselves rather than pay such
prices', and there were others who had :
not yet struck pay dirt. These would
have .i hard time. There were, how
ev< r. n his opinion, enough supplies in
Dawson to prevent any real suffering
before Bpring.
The Dawsonites said that not more
than 300 were coming out, and that
most of the old-timers were out al
: ready. "Happy Jack" (J. C. Felix of
Everett. Wash.) brought out specimens
â¢of fine quartz from two claims that he
: had located near Bear Creek, and re
ported that the creeks around Dawson
wi : being actively prospected. An
other party said a recent <iis
y had been made on Dian Creek,
which is only two miles above Dawson
and empties Into the Yukon. It is a
small creek, but fifty or sixty locations
â were made on it with a rush. On Quig
ley, between Hunker and Bonanza,
â¢us had been made that
; very promising.
â¢ â  It was reported that the American
Tradinsr Company had bought three
claims on Bonanza from Alec McDon
ald and "Nigger Jim" for $322,000. It
was said that claims were not for
sale now. There was a disposition to
hold them until the spring rush.

â his name as Vangualgi arrived in this
â¢ city hot on the trail of his erring
. spouse, "who left San Leandro yester
â day morning under circumstances that
â¢pointed to an elopement.
.'â¢.' When Valgualgi returned to his
â  borne yesterday after his hard day's
work he found no wife to greet him, ;
a.nd everything pointed to the fact
that she had fled from his roof. His
"16-month-old baby was alone in the
house, crying for mamma. Upon in
quiry the unhappy husband ascertain
. c.d that his brother also was missing.
.He discovered, after a hasty investi
gation, that his wife and his brother
had, in fact, eloped. He lost no time
in starting in pursuit of the guilty
pair. He heard that they had gone to
Stockton, and the first train thither
he boarded.
Upon his arrival here he went at
once to the p ilice station, where he
told Chief Gall of his mission and
gave a description of his spouse and
his brother. A couple of officers were
detailed to look up the elopers, and !
after a brief search they were found in 1
. a lodging-house on Weber avenue, op- I
.posite the court house and within a
â tone's throw of the police headquar
ters. There the woman had given the
name of Claudina Garcia.
The angry husband confronted his
better half in the presence of his own
brother, and also before a couple of po
lice officers. She wept at sight of him,
and before many words were exchang
ed she was crying hysterically. The
, brother had no explanation to make,
and during the scene he quietly sneak
ed away. The erring wife sobbed for
fdrgiveness, promising to go home to
.San Leandro and to her child. Her
"husband's wrath had been appeased,
â â¢and he agreed to take her back. The
â¢policemen withdrew, not desiring to
witness any more of the scene of re
.cohciliation.

JANESVILLE, Wis., Jan. 2.â Frances
E. Willard, president of the National
Women's Christian Temperance Union,
fainted to-night at the close of her lec
ture on "A White Life for Two," which
she delivered in the Congregational
Church. A physician was summoned,
but it was some time before she recov
ered sufficiently to be removed.
The church was packed and hundreds
were turned away. The church was
exceedingly close, and it was noticeable
that Miss Willard was making a pain
ful effort to speak. She suddenly
brought her talk to an abrupt close and
left the platform, fainting as she
reached the ante-room. Her secre
tary, Miss Gordon, said that Miss Wil
lard had been ill for several days, but
had kept up for this talk to the people
of Janesville, among whom her girl
hood was spent. She is resting easily
to-night.

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 2.â A theatrical
company playing "In Old Kentucky"
left Kansas City at midnight last
night on a special train of three coach
es over the Wabash en route to St.
Louis. An hour after leaving the
front end of the baggage-car was dis
covered to be on fire. The engineer
crowded on all steam to make a siding
at Fleming station, ten miles ahead.
The wind fanned the flames until they
could be heard above the roar of the
flying train. When the siding was
reached the baggage-car was a loss,
and was left to burn. The company lost
its scenery and three valuable horses.
Nobody was injured, and the train of
two cars arrived at the Union station

Special Dispatch to the Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.â Right Hon.
Horace Plunkett, M. P., chairman of
the liish Agricultural Organization So
ciety, who is now visiting the United
States, has contributed to the January
number of the North American Review,
which will be issued on January 13, an
&i count of the efforts which have been
made, since the death of Mr. Parnell.
m further the cause of Ireland through
the development of her commercial and
Industrial resources. This new move
ment, Mr. Plunkett points out, depends
for its success upon the co-operanon
of Irishmen who are politically op
posed to each other, and it has been
the means of bringing together in a
common endeavor prominent men of
the most diverse political factions,
unionists and nationalists uniting.
The conviction out of which the new
movement arose was that the Irish
difficulty has long been rather econom
ic than political, and that it is so more
than ever to-day.
"Solve the economic problem," pays
Mr. Plunkett, "and in the process the
Irish people will be so elevated and
strengthened that they will be able to
solve the present problem for them
selves."
Being entirely practical in their aims
and processes, the patriots who insti
tuted this movement *ought sugges
tion and inspiration in countries where
similar efforts had already been made.
Commissioners were sent to Denmark,
to Germany, to France and other coun
tries on the continent to observe the
results of the attempts to organize in
dustries of various kinds and the work
of the Irish agricultural society was
pursued along the line* suggested by
the representatives of the commis
sioner.
The programme of the reformen is
based on voluntary association for in
dustrial purposes, and the attempt
made is to give practical effect to this
principle by the establishment of so
cieties of farmers for common advan
tage. The success which lias attended
this work has been most encouraging.
The Irish agricultural organization so
ciety, representing almost all classes of
Irishmen, was funned to provide funds
for carrying on the movement, and it
has been instrumental in establishing
170 of the farm ties in Ireland,
sc tttered throughout thirty-one of the
thirty-two counties, with an aggregate
membership of some 17,000.
"These societies," says Mr. Punkett,
"variously embrace every branch of
the farming industry. They cheapen
production by the joint purchase of
seeds. manufacturers' Implements,
machinery and other requirements of
their industry. In dairying districts
they erect creameries, which they show
a capacity to operate for their own pro
fit. Theyjointlysell what they produce
with a view to saving middle profits.
They are in many districts applying
the principle of co-operation to agri
cultural finance, and are thus securing
a great reduction of interest on farm
loans. The advantages derived from
combination of individuals is enhanced
by joint action between societies."
Mr. Plunkett says that it is only the
lack of funds sufficient to send organ
izers qualified to educate bodies of
farmers, who are ready to listen to
them in almost every parish in Ire
land, which delays the universal adop
tion of the new scheme, and he <-alls
attention to the fact that in providing
the means to accomplish this purpose,
a splendid opportunity is open for some
wealthy lover of Ireland to confer upon
her people an incalculable boon.
FIRE IN FRUITVALE
An Old LandmarK. Built by Isaac
Requa.ls Destroyed by
Fire.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 2.
Shortly after 9 o'clock to-night fire
â was discovered on the roof of the <>iÂ«l
Isaac Requa house, on Park street,
near East Twelfth, Fruitvale. Tin
house, which cost $9000, was entirely
destroyed. It was last occupied by
John Church. It had been unoccupied
for a year, and it is pretty plain that
something has been going on within its
walls of which the outside world has
known nothing. Church was a pecu
liar man, with a still more peculiar'
record, but there is no means of trac
ing to him the discoveries ><( to-day.
Since the Fruitvale bond election the
residents of that locality have been
looking for a place to establish a new
Bchool, not desiring to build at pres
ent. The Church house was suggested
and last October a committee from
the Fruitvale School Board, headed
by Chairman Bane, visited the place.
They w< j re shocked to find a number
of bloodstains, seemingly made by a
gory hand, upon a door casing, and
several dark splotches upon the floor,
which could not be mistaken. Here
and there in the larger rooms upon the
first floor were bits of torn garments
and shreds of clothing, and a fierce
struggle can well be imagined to have
taken place there from the stains and
daubs found all about. It Is believed
now that a local boxing club has had
some lively set-tos here, and it may
be that something of the kind was in
progress there to-night.
John Church was the much married
man who once upon a time asked his
wife to stand up in court. Three
women arose, and each blandly re
marked "I am Mrs. Church." Church
was finally convicted of bigamy after
a sensational trial.
The place now belongs to* E. M.
Derby, who lives next to it. His resi
dence had a narrow escape from the
flames, as did numerous buildings.
Sparks ftew two blocks or more to the
Valentine Hush residence and Ignited
the roof, but a prompt use of the gar
den ho3e prevented any damage. The
district being outside of the city limits,
no fire apparatus started for thu fne
until Chief Fair ordered Engine 6 and
the Ea3t Fourteenth chemical out.
They could only protect the surround
ing houses. The fire burned itself out
by half past 10.
No clow has been found for the
cause ' of the fire, unless some one was
using â¢an upper room and had a lire
la the fireplace, â¢ " '
WORK AHEAD
FOR CONGRESS
Will Soon Consider the
Hawaiian Annexation
Treaty.
Corbett's Claim to a Seat in
the Senate Will Be Con
tested.
In the House the Battle on Civil Ser
vice Appropriation Is to Be
Renewed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 2.
The prevaling opinion among Sen
ators is that very little legislation will
be attempted during the present week.
The fact- that Congress will not recon
vene until Wednesday will probably be
taken by the absentees to mean that
nothing will be attempted until the
following week, and, as a consequence,
it is doubtful whether there will be a
quorum present in the Senate on Wed
y, in which event there will prob
ably be an early adjournment and then
an adjournment until Monday. In any
event it is not probable that any impor
tant questions will be raised during the
:*i week.
The general understanding is, how
ever, that the work of the session will
begin in real earnest after this week,
and that henceforth there will be no
justification of the complaint of dull
ness in the proceedings. Among the
questions which will engage early at
tention are: The Hawaiian annexation
question, the ckiim of Mr. Corbett to a
seat in the Senate from Oregon, the
immigration and the financial ques
tions.
In all probability the Committee on
Privileges and Elections will meet dur
â¢ present week, and the chances
are that an early report on the Corbett
will be ordered, even though it
may not be favorable. The Republican
side of the chamber will 'not be a unit
In Mr. Corbett'a interest. Senator Bur
rows of the committee that has charge
of the case is preparing an exhaustive
speech antagonistic to Mr. Corbett, and
th- opposition is counting upon tho as
sistui.ee of still others from that side of
the chamber. It is not believed that
there will be any serious antagonism to
the immigration bill, but there may be
considerable time consumed in speeches
on the subject.
It is probable that Senator Davis.
man of the Committee on For
eign Relations, will make an effort
during the present week to get a day
fixed fur taking up the annexation
treaty, and there is no apprehension
of any objection to naming a day in the
near future. The plan of the sup
porters of the treaty is to take the
question up in executive session on a
resolution of ratification, and to de
bate the treaty for a few days in ex
ecutive Marion, pursuing this coutm
long enough to determine their
strength and commit th.'se who pro
fess to be with them.
If they find that they have the ne
cessary twi. -thirds to secure ratifica
tion, they will presÂ«s on to the end, but
if they discover themselves to be de-
Qcient in voting strength thoy will
change their policy and take up the
Question of annexation on Beuator
Morgan's resolution to that end. Tic â :â¢<
is no doubt that a majority of affirma
tive votes can be secured and that a
resolution of this character can be
passed if a vote can be reached. Th^
present indications are that the treaty
as such will fall of ratification by from
two to six votes, but friends of the
agreement have by no means lost hope
that th^y will succeed in securing the
entire sixty votes necessary to ratify.
They claim that they have been mak
ing headway in securing votes during
the recess, and are hopeful of still add
ing to the number. They now asserr
that a solid vote may be expected from
the Republican side of the chamber,
and that several Democrats who hav<>
been claimed by the opposition are on
the fence and liable to come to them
The circumstance which has done
most to Improve the chances of the
treaty is the conduct of the Europep.a
powers in apparently preparing for
the partition of China. Many Senators
feel that this is an event which -alls
for prompt action on the part of this
country in the Hawaiian matter, and
there is no denying that this view has
made some impression upon Senators
who have heretofore been classed aa
doubtful.
The promised explanation by Senator
Wolcott of the result of his bimetallic
mission to Europe is expected when
made to open up the discussion of the
attitude of the administration on the
silver question and the debate may
even be sprung in advance of his
speech. The pronounced free silver ad
vocatea are determined to secure a test
vote during the session on the silver
question, and Senator Teller has decid
ed to introduce the Stanley Matthews
resolution of the Forty-fifth Congress
declaring for the payment of bonds in
silver, with this end in view. Senator
Wolcott will, in all probability, make a
simple, straightforward statement,
avoiding all controverted points as far
as possible, but there are other Sena
tors who will not be contented to allow
the matter to drop there and they will
seek to open the entire question of the
position of the administration toward
int .-i national bimetallism. Mr. Wolcott
does not expect to be able to present
his statement before the 15th of the
month.
The time of the House this week,
after it meets on Wednesday, will
probably be entirely devoted to the de
bate on the civil service question. By
general consent the appropriation in
the executive, legislative and judicial
bill for the maintenance of the com
mission, upon which the debate will bt
based, went over until after the holi
days. II is intended by the opponents
of the civil service law that the de
bate shall cover the whole question
and they expect to develop and exploit
some very interesting facts. The de
fenders of the law have made elaborate
preparations to meet these assaults,
and some highly interesting, if not sen
sational, incidents are anticipated. The
records of individuals are likely to be
very much in evidence. It is not ex
pected that the debate will be conclud
ed this week as Saturday has been set
aside for paying tribute to the memory
of the late Representative Wright of
Massachusetts.
Now It ls*Bryan for Congress.
LINCOLN. Neb., Jan. 2.â The politi
cal friends of Mr. Bryan have arranged
a little surprise for him when he re
turns to-morrow, in the shape of an
offer of the fusion nomination for Con
gress in the First district, now
represented by Judge E. Strode, Re
publican. Many believe he will flatly
refuse. Others say he cannot hope, by
his lecturing, to keep himself promi
nently before the public. They argue
that Congress will give him the power
he needs, and his presence there will
effectually dim the star of his only vis
ible competitor, Representative Bailey.
FOR REFORM
OF CURRENCY
Report of the Monetary
Commission Has Been
Submitted.
Present Evils Pointed Out and
Important Recommenda
tions Are Made.
Legislation Required to Prevent the
Threatened Degradation of the
Gold Standard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 2.
In the report of the Monetary Com
mission to the executive committee of
the Indianapolis Monetary Convention
a plan of currency reform is submitted
in the hope that it will, if enacted Into
law, accomplish, so far as possible,
these results:
1. To remove, at once and forever, all
doubt as to what the standard of value
In the United States is and is to be.
-. To establish the credit of the l/nitec"
States at the highest point among the
nations of the world.
3. To eliminate from "our currency sys
tem those features which reason and ex
perience show to be elements of weak
ness and danger.
4. To provide a paper currency convert
ible into gold and equal to it in value at
all times and places, in which, with a
volume adequate to the general and usual
needs of business, there shall be com
bined a quality of growth and elasticity,
through which it will adjust itself auto
matically and promptly to all variations
of demand, whether sudden or gradual,
and which shall distribute itself through
oat the country as the wants of the dif
ferent sections may require.
5. To so utilize the existing silver dol
lars as to maintain their parity with gold
without imposing undue burdens on the
treasury.
6. To avoid any injurious contraction of
the currency.
7. To avoid the issue of interest-boarinj:
bonds, except in case of unlooked-for
emergency; but to confer the power to
Issue bonds when necessary for the pres
ervation of the credit of the Government.
8. To accomplish these ends l.y â¢ plan
which would lead from our present con
fused and uncertain situation by gradual
and progressive steps, without shock or
violent change, to a monetary system
which will be thoroughly safe and good
and capable of growth to any extent that
the country may require. â¢
We cannot, within the limits of this
preliminary report, go at length into tho.
reasons which have led us to all the con
clusions here expressed. A statement of
those which relate to the more important
points must suffice. Later a fuller and
Jlnal report will be presented.
After alluding to the ten different
forms of currency in the United States
the report gives the following as the
defects of the existing system:
Firstâ vast amount of government
credit currency without a certain and
adequate provision for its redemption,
and the consequent diminution of public
confidence in the continued maintenance
of the gold standard.
Secondâ The continuance in circulation
of government promises to pay, which,
when made a legal tender, constitute a
forced loan, which are secured only by
such resources as the exercise of the
taxing power can render available, and
which are payablo only at the will of the
debtor.
Thirdâ The failure to provide the means
foi a gradual and sufiicient increase of
the volume of the currency to meet the
needs of an increasing: population and an
enlarging commerce.
Fourthâ The want of a natural outflow
and inflow of the currency when and as,
and only when and as, the agricultural,
manufacturing and commercial interests
of the country require, at a given time,
either a greater or a less quantity of cur
rency in circulation.
Filthâ The failure to secure such a dis
tribution of the loanable capital of the
country as will tend to equalize the rates
of interest in all Its parts.
â The confusion of the fiscal func
tions of the treasury as the receiver of
the public revenue and the disburser
thereof under congressional appropria
tions with its issue and redemption tunc
tions in exchanging and redeeming the
currency.
Seventhâ The circulation of different
forms of government currency having
different qualities as to legal tender and
receivable for government dues.
Eighthâ The circulation of silver dol
lars of full legal tender quality whose
nominal value as coins so largely ex
ceeds their value as bullion, that they
offer tempting inducements to successful
counterfeiting.
Ninthâ circulation of a national
bank currency based upon government
bonds, presupposing a continuing issue
of those bonds, diminishing the loanable
funds of the banks, and, by reason of
their bond basis, incapable of increasing
in volume with a temporary demand for
more currency and of decreasing with
ihe cessation of. that demand.
The committee states that the most
serious evil affecting our present sys
tem is the threatened degradation of
is standard. The means necessary to
â¢stablish and preserve popular conti
lence in the continued maintenance of
ihe gold standard is given as follows:
L An explicit legislative definition of
.)><â¢ >;<il(l standard and a pledge that it
win in- maintained.
L. A requirement that all obligations.
public and private, unless otherwise stip
ilated in the contract, shall be payable
in conformity with thai standard.
3. The adoption of a plan for the grad
ual retirement <>f the outstanding note
issues of the government.
As the gold deposited for certificates
i-annot be used by the Government, and
as the issue of goM certificates is of no
tdvantage t<> the Government or to the
people, these dots not seem t<> bu any
reason for their continued issue.
The banking system is thoroughly
reviewed, and recommendations made
for necessary reforms. The report is
signed by: George F. Edmunds, chair
man; George E. Leighton, vice-chair
man; T. <*.. Hush, YV. R Dean, Charles
S. Fairchild, Stuyvesant Fish. J. W.
Fries, C. Stuart Patterson, Robert S.
Taylor.
Louis A. Garnett approves the re
port, except as to the provisions relat
ing to metallic currency; and J. Lau
rence Laughlin dissents from that por-
Treasury to reissue United States
tion empowering the Secretary of the
notes in purchase of bonds.

COURSING AT THE CAPITAL.
Little Delight Wins the Final Dash From
Tipperary Lass.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.â Little De
light bore her name well to-day, lor,
when Judge Cummings' fla^ went up
for the last time, it showed the color
she wore, and Tom Ken nod v. her
owner, pocketed first money. Tipper
ary Lass was the hound that stayed
with Little Delight to the last and
came in for a share of \.h<3 purse. In
order to do this Tipperary Lass had
to dispose of Glenbrook, Little "Wonder,
Skylight and Lady Glendyne in the or
der named.
Little Delight started in on her
achievements of the day by retiring
Kitty Lonsdale. In the first tie she

but, in spite uf the hitter's speed, she
won handily. Next she met Governor
Markham after a bye, which was hers
also. Taking it all in all, from Kitty

Governor Markham, in order to re

share, had to do the same to Little T.
Klko and The Flying Dutchman. Lanky
Bob stayed until the first tie, and then
was forced out by Skylight. Elko did
well, but was defeated before she
reached the second tie by Lady Glen

and so did Skylight and Little Wonder.

SIX MEMBERS OF A
FAMILY ARE BURNED
Continued from First Page.
City Fire Department, was very badly
burned. He fell through a burning
floor and was rescued with difficulty.
Henry A. Reich, 17 years old. man
aged to make his way from the house
with bad burns on the neck, face and
hands, but he is not seriously injured.
Adolph Reich's home was at 317 Ger
mania avenue, near the Hudson County
boulevard in the. Hudson City district.
He was a real estate agent and well
to-do, living in a pleasant house of
three stories. It is believed the fire
broke out from a heater in the base
ment and it worked its way up to the
third floor, where the sleeping apart
ments of the family were located.
Henry Reich said it was late when
the family retired, the evening having
been spent in entertaining New Tear's
callers. Early in the morning he was
awakened by shouts. Running into
the hall he saw the smoke and flames
in the lower hall. His father was
there and they managed to get out of
the house in their night clothes. Young
Reich ran down the street and gave the
alarm. When he returned his father
was nowhere to be seen, but one of his
brothers. Sigmund, was there, badly
burned. He was taken to a neighbor
ing house, where he said that some one
had awakened him and that he had
jumped through the blinding smoke and
flames down the staircase and out into
the open air.
Several enpine companies responded
promptly to the alarm, and in a few
minutes the fire was out. Then began
the search of the house. The rays of
the lanterns disclosed three charred
bodies against the wall at the foot of
the stairs. They were those of Adolpb
Reich, his daughter Tillie, and little
Gustav. The father had fallen upon
the daughter and his son was in his
arms. They were burned almost be
yond recognition.
In the basement cf the house the
searching party stumbled over the re
mains of Ida and Albert, two blackened
corpses with arms intertwined. Por
tions of the limbs had been entirely
burned away and the faces were horri
bly distorted.
The mother was found in the dining
room. She was but slightly burned.
Her face shewed no look of pain. She
undoubtedly died from suffocation.
The bodies were sent to the morgue.

'â /â â  POMONA, Jan. 2.â California olives

yfho aTe engaged in pickling olives,
have; received orders for delivering
thousands of gallons of the pickled
fruit in the Eastern cities in the next

East who had to be coaxed to handle
Southern California olives a year ago
have- lately sent orders for barrels and
hogsheads of the olives, and they say
that at last the California product is
winning its way into popular favor.
Conservative estimates put the value
of. the season's olive yield in California
at about $100,000 greater than in any
previous year. ,-.'. ' 'â â â

Miserable Condition of the

To Add to the Terrors the

?I ec'.al Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Jan. 2.â The insurgent
General Francisco Carillo, with LOOO
men from Santa Clara province, has
entered Matanzas province near Ha
bana and is supposed to be on the way
to re-unite with the concentrated in
surgent forces under Brigadier-Gener
als Suarez and Cepero, in Havana prov
ince.
Before the disarming of the laborers
on the tobacco plantation of Boch &
Co., in Pinar del Rio, recently reported,
fifty armed laborers are said to have
joined the insurgents at Ceiba del
Aqua, Havana.
Three thousand concentrados have
been returned to their homes in Ma
tanza's province, railroad transporta
tion being provided by the Government.
The Diario de la Marina calls the at
tention of the authorities to the pitiable
condition of the people of the town of
Alonzo Kogas, in Pinar del Rio prov
ince. During the lirst ten days of De
cember 100 persons died. Whole fam
ilies of eight and ten persons have per
ished, of ninety-two volunteers only
nineteen are fit for duiv, the remainder
being sick with smalipox.
At Santo Domingo, Santa Clara prov- !
ince, the smallpox epidemic has in
creased terribly, in spite of the splendid
weather, but the fevers have slowly de- j
creased. In the districts of Jicotea, I
Menacas and the central plantation Es- i
peranza smallpox is raging among the â 
concentrados, many of whom have !
died. Many of the concentrados are
without medicine, food and other nee- !
essaries of life. Families resident in
the stricken districts are unable to ;
emigrate thence because they have no j
resources.
The Government has for a second
time sent $10,000 for the relief of the
concentradoa in Matanzas province.
It is reported from Santiago de Cuba
that General Pando is greatly disheart
ened on account of the obstacles which
prevented a successful campaign
against the insurgents in that province.
He declares that he has no base of op
erations,the Insurgents' control being so
complete that it is impossible to con
vey supplies to Spainsh columns oper
ating in the interior of the province.
General Pando is said to be convinced
that the insurgents of Santiago de Cuba
province will not accept autonomy.
When he was in Spain he did not real
ize that the insurgents in the province
had such strength.
It is said that General Sagua, oper
ating in Santiago de Cuba, has been
unable to agree with his superior offi
cers, and on th.' pretext that he was
si. k. he has arrived in Havana and will
return to Spain by the first mail
steamer.
Ex-Minister Canelejas, the Madrid
editor, who has been investigating the
situation in Cuba, is said to be thor
oughly discouraged with the outlook.
He will return to Spain shortly, the
sudden death of his sister being given
as the cause for hastening his depart
ure.
Senor Amblard, who has just returned
from the United States, is said to take
the same hopeless view of the situation
as Senor Canelejas, and it is stated
that he will deiline the proffered ap
pointment of secretary to the Cuban
autonomist cabinet.
Senor Capules, Governor of Santiago
de Cuba, has resigned, being unwilling
to make appointments dictated to him
by the Government through General
Pando. Military Commander Oliver
is acting in Capules' place.
DISGUSTED WITH BUSHNELL.
Judge Nash Scores the Coyer nor for His
Opposition to Hanna.
COLUMBUS, 0., Jan. 2.â Judge
George K. Nash, chairman of the Re
publican executive committee, to-day
sent a letter to Governor Bushnell re
signing his position as a trustee of the
Ohio Asylum at Gallipolis, to which
position Judge Nash had been appoint
ed by Governor Bushnell. The letter
is said to be very caustic, but Judge
Xash will not give it out for publica
tion until after it has been received by
the Governor in his mail to-morrow.
( >n being asked for the reasons for his
action. Judge Nash, to-night, said:
"On Friday, I am informed by a most
reliable gentleman, Governor Bushhell
said that the Republican executive
committee, in the recent campaign, did
not do a thing to assist him as a
candidate. In justice to my associates
Hi that committee, than who a more
loyal set of men, to the party ticket
and to a great cause, were never band
ed together, as well as to myself, as
tl chairman. 1 could not do otherwise
than resent the insult. Again, if Gov
ernor Bushneil really believes that I
was disloyal to him as chairman, he
must be very uneasy as to whether I
will properly perform my duties as an
officer. I desire to relieve his mind of
this worry.
"I am also disgusted with the con
duct of Governor Bushneil. Before the
election, in public speeches, he pre
tended that he desired Mr. Hanna's re
turn to the United Staffs Senate.
Since that time he has consorted with
the enemies of the Republican party
to defeat the will of the people. I
look upon this as a square case of ob
taining votes by false pretenses,"
Judge Nash, as chairman ut the
State Committee, is taking an active
interest in the election of Senator
Hanna. and claims that the last State
convention at Toledo named Mr.
lianna for Senator, as well as nomi
nated Mr. Bushneil for Governor. At
the last State convention in Toledo
Uovernor Bushneil wanted Charles L.
Kurtz selected as chairman of the
State Executive Committee, a posi

tion which Mr. Kurtz had held for the
two previous campaigns, in 1895, when
Bushnell was first elected Governor,
and in 1896, when the presidential
ticket was in the field. It is claimed
that the head of the State ticket, by
precedent, has always named the
State campaign chairman. In 1896
Secretary of Stato Charles Kinne
headed the State ticket and opposed
Kurtz for chairman, but Governor
Rushnell secured the roapptiintnient
then of Kurtz as chairman over the
protest of Kinne.
When the last State convention
nominated Uushnell for Governor and
Hanna f"r Senator, tho latter defeated
Kurtz fur chairman and secured the
election of Nash for chairman. That
is the cause of the present figrht
against Hanna. It has involved all the
old fijrhts df former years that existed
between what were called the Sherman
and the Foster factions, and later the
so-called McKinley anJ the Foraker
factions, until now the lines are drawn
between what are termed the Hanna
and the Bushnell factions, but these
factional fights never included a com
bine with tho Democrats until in the
present contest. During the last State
campaign it was stated that Governor
Bushnell visited the State head
quarters only once and then on invita
tion. It is also stated that Mr. Kurtz.
who was State Oil Inspector under
Governor Bushnell and leader of the
opposition against Hanna, conducted
the State headquarters in the interest
of Bushnell and of anti-Hanna candi
dates for the legislature. There were
charges during the campaign that
Judge Nash was conducting the cam
paign for the legislative tickets and
Kurtz for the State tickets.

Senate.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
COLI'MBI'S, Ohio, J an . 2.â There
are indications to-night here of serious
trouble, at least of disorder, at the
State Hous? to-morrow.
Since the caucuses of last night both
the Hanna men and the opposition are
claiming enough votes for the organi
zation of the House. No trouble is
feared in the Senate chamber, as it is
believed Senator Burke, one of the
Republicans, will remain away, and
thus permit the Democrats to elect the
officers in that body.
At the Republican House caucus last
night there were ten absentees and
Alexander Boxwell received only fifty
two votes for the nomination, while it
requires lifty-five votes for election, if
all are present. Under the law, after
ten ballots are. taken the candidate re
ceiving the highest number of votes is
declared elected, even if it is then not
a majority over all. Griffith of Clin
ton, who was unable to be at the cau
cus last night on account of sickness,
has announced that he will be here to
morrow to vol.? fur Boxwell, who is
the Hanna candidate for Speukei, and
Mr. Boxwell, who, without giving any
names, claims to have the other two
votes necessary for election.
In addition to the absent members,
many other Republicans have been
sent for to-day by both sides and
many are arriving to-night. It is
charged that some of the arrivals are
known as "knockers" on such an occa
sion as will be witnessed in the House
to-morrow. Secretary of State Charles
Kinney, a strong Hanna man, will pre
side in the House until that body se
lects a Speaker.
In anticipation of rulings, there have
been threats made during the day.
Mr. Kinney is said to have selected a
strong force of tempwrary serjeants
at-arms and to be ready for any emer
gency. The combine of Democrats
and anti-Hanna Republicans claim to
night that they will elect Harry C. Ma
son of Cleveland, an anti-Hanna Re
publican, as Speaker, and seat him.
If Representative Mason should re
ceive the requisite votes there will be
no trouble about his qualifying and
taking his seat, but there is apprehen
sion of disorder previous to the ballot
being taken, and possibly during the
balloting and counting of th< vote. The
opposition claim they will have the
forty-fceven Democratic votes in the
House solid and nine Republicans, or
one more than enough to elect the- Ma
son ticket. They ;i re staying with the
anti-Hanna and anti-Boxweli Repub
licans very closely, and claim that
those Republicans who did not attend
the caucus last night are staying *vith
them.
There are three Democratic members
who are opposed to fusion, or, rather,
to voting for Republicans for Speaker
and other officers. Three of the Demo
crats would not enter the Democratic
caucus last night until they were as
sured they would not thus be pledged
to vote for Republican nominees. Hut
they do not say to-day that they will
not vote for Mason or oth>>r Repub
lican candidates. They simply an
nounce that as things stand since the
action of the opposition conference
they are unpledged. With the result
depending on the change of one
vote either way, these three Democrats
and the Republicans who did not enter
the caucus are undergoing the strong
est pressure to-night of all inlluences
that can be brought to bear upon
them.
There have been irresponsible
charges during the day of bribery, but
no evidences of it an- discernible. The
opposition to BoxweU to-night has de
clared that any excess of fifty-three
votes for him for Speaker will be fol
low -d by investigation, but there are
charges and counter-charges or undue
influence on both sid^s.
The Hanna men claim that Mason
will be short three Democratic votes
and four Republican, that are listed
against Boxwell, and that Mason will
not have fifty votes. While both sides
concede less than a majority to their
opponents, neither side claims more
than one vote to spare, and the situa
tion seems to require such close watch
ing as to cause the most bitter feeling.
RELIEF FOR THE DESTITUTE.
Articles That Are Needed by the Starving
People of Cuba.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2â The follow
ing announcement regarding the work
of Cuban reiief inaugurated by this--
Government has been made from the
State Department:
In view of the steps now boing taken
by th<- Secretary of State for the or
ganisation, in New York, of a central
headquarters, with the co-operation of
the American National Red Cross, for
the reception and forwarding of relief
fur th<- suffering people nf Cuba, and the
probability that it will he in effective op
eration early in tbe present week, the
S-c r. tary <>f State has directed that the
benevolently disposed public of the
United States be informed through the
medium of the press thai th.' Consul-
General of the I nlted States at Havana
mentions the following articles as appro
priate to these contributed, all of them,
as he reports, being greatly needed:
Summer clothing for women and chil
dren: medicines for fevers, principally
quinine; hard bread, tlour. oorn meaf.
bacon, rice, lard, potatoes. Uans, peas,
salt fish, any canned goods, particularly
nourishing soup, meat extracts, blankets
and especially large quantities of con
densed milk, as many persons are at
first too feeble for any other nourish
ment. Contributions of money are also
urgently needed to enable the purchase
of immediate supplies of medicines and
articles of prime necessity, and to meet
the expenses of local transa nation in
Cuba. The Consul-General, to whom all
supplies and money will be sent, will at
once organize arrangements for the re
ceipt, storage and most effective distri
bution of whatever he may receive from
the humane people of the United States.

BUREAU CLERKS
WITH PENSIONS
Gross Frauds Which Might Be
Unearthed Through an
Investigation.
Government Employes Said to Have
Assisted Each Other to Obtain
Large Sums.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NBW rORK, Jart. 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: It is a fact
not without significance that the op
position to the project of publishing a
iist of all pensioners, together with the
disabilities f.>r which they are being
paid, is particularly noticeable among
resident pensioners of this city. There
has been no such general opposition to
the plan from other sections of the
country.
There is good reason for this local
opposition. During the pension de
bauch in which the country has in
dulged for the last few years, some of
the clerks in the pension bureau have
taken advantage of their positions to
help each other to secure pensions.
They have been able to obtain pensions
Hinging from $10 to $50 a month, while
at the same time they were receiving
salaries as able-bodied Government
employes, ranging from SIOOO to $3000 a
year.
In order to obtain these pensions the
clerks in many cases had to make oath
to the effect that they were so disabled
that they could not support themselves.
If these men had not been in a position
to aid each other in obtaining pensions
they would in most instances, not have
obtained them.
Even among themselves the clerks of
the pension bureau have tried to keep
secret the fact that they are drawing
pensions in addition to their salaries.
The proposition now to publish their
names, together with fliose of other
pensioners, has alarmed them, and
they are doing all they can to prevent
a consummation of the plan.
GALA WEEK FOR INMATES
OF THE ELDRIDGE HOME.
Entertainment Provided for Feeble-Minded
Children During the Holiday
Season.
ELDRIDGE. Jan. 2.â This holiday
season has been a gala week for the
inmates of the Home for the Feeble-
Minded Children, as Dr. A. E. Osborne,
the superintendent, had provided en
tertainment for every afternoon and
evening following the Christmas fes
tivities. The spacious assembly hall,
with its pretty, well-fitted little stage,
was the scene of the entertainments.
On Monday evening a stereopticon
exhibition was given. On Tuesday
there was a concert, in which the in
stitution band, composed of inmates,
took chief place, and acquitted itself
creditably, while it In turn enjoyed
the apparently mysterious playing of
an electric piano. Talented Miss Helen
Kelleher on Wednesday claimed the at
tention of all with her lecture on
"Semi-Tropic California." illustrated
with stereoptic mi views. Thursday
evening was taken up by a jolly play
written by Dr. Osborne. called "The
<"ru;se >>{ the Tommy Dodd," which
v. as presented by the Home Dramatic
Club, consisting of the teachers and
other officers. On Friday evening there
was presented another clever farce
from the superintendent's pen, "Cran
berry Farm" by name, and on New
Year's night the Sonoma Valley or
chestra, under the leadership of H. G.
Maxwell, gave a grand concert, which
nope enjoyed more than did the in
mates.
Many visitors were present every
evening, and the sum thus realized is
reserved for the children's Christmas
fund.

criminal cases can be and are
"squared" by certain deputies in the
office. Recently Frank Phillips, who
was charged with murder, was dis
missed on motion of Deputy District
Attorney F. R. Willis, who alleged
that one Kitty Carlin. a material wit
ness for the prosecution, could not be
found. It is now stated that Kitty
was not only in the city, but Jn the
courtroom when the motion was made.
A newspaper here calls attention to the
fact that Deputy Willis occupies the
same office as Davis & Ruth, attorneys
for the defense in the Pnlliips case, and
makes such strong intimation that the
case was "squared" that the court has
taken judicial notice of it.
Superior Judge B. N. Smith, in whose
department Phillips was tried, has or
dered Deputy Willis to appear before
him to-morrow and be examined upon
the allegations of the newspapers.
There is a strong current of opposition
to District Attorney Donnell, both in
one faction of the Republican party
and among the Good Government
Leaguers, and a determined effort will
bo made to kill him off politically.
Intimations are freely made that the
Sheriff's office is mixed up in the
"squaring" business, and an investiga
tion of one or more deputies in that of
fice will be made.

THE CLOSE OF THE BUSINESS YEAR
THE YEAR just closed is an admirable illustra
tion of the benefits resulting from a wisely
framed protective tariff. The first half was
dull and profitless, and there was a growing cry that
the Republican party had failed to keep its promises
of good times; but during the latter half business
was larger than ever before in the nation's history.
The exports greatly exceeded the imports, showing
that the country sold more than it bought. Mills
started up on all sides, the wages of operators were
increased in many localities, railroad earnings showed
a pronounced increase over the preceding year, and
the leading industries, such as woolen goods, iron
and steel, boots and shoes, etc., enjoyed a demand
never equaled in previous years. As for the wheat
trade, it was phenomenal, the exports being enor
mous and the price very profitable. The shipments
of merchandise to foreign ports during the first eleven
months of the year exceeded those for the same
period in 1896 by $86,000,000, and for 1895 by $242,
000.000. This showing ought to satisfy any reasona
ble man of the benefits of a wise tariff.
But apparently the zenith has not yet been reached.
Shrewd observers predict a still larger trade in 1898.
All indications point in that direction. Dealers in
many lines say that stocks in jobbing and retail hands
are small and buyers are even now nibbling at the
markets in a way that presages activity after the new
year gets well going. There has been no pro
nounced decline in prices, and most commodities are
more than holding their own in this respect. Wheat
keeps up, which means a good deal, not only to the
farmer, but to the whole country; and, in fact, al
most the entire line of farm products are selling at
remunerative figures.
While it is thus seen that trade throughout the
country is on a satisfactory basis a glance at the
state of business on this coast will show that it is
not behind the re?t of the nation. The wheat crop
. was large in this State, but in Oregon and Washing
ton it was phenomenal; and in all three States the
prices were so good that the wheat growers found
themselves in clover again. Many of them not only
paid up old liabilities, but carried over a surplus,
something they have not done for some years back.
Hay, which is so closely allied to wheat that it fol
lows that cereal up and down, has been selling better
than for a number of seasons and bids fair to sell
well this year. The demand for farming and min
ing implements "has been exceptionally good, and
from, present indications will continue so. The lum
ber trade, too, which was in the dumps a long time,
has recently become more active at an advance in
prices, which, while not sharp enough to inconveni
ence the consumer, meant a good deal to the pro
ducer, and owner of timber land. Ship-building,
particularly the construction of small craft, has re
ceived a remarkable stimulus, in which the demand
for tonnage for the Alaskan trade" has been no incon
siderable factor. The tremendous business in wool
last spring and summer is still so fresh in the minds
of all that it needs no comment beyond that, that
when buyers are so eager for wool that they buy it
on the sheep's back they want it pretty badly. Yet
millions of pounds were purchased in this manner.
The cattle raiser, too, came in for his share of the
profit in the rise in beef and the aGvance in hides
and leather. During the latter part of the summer
the provision trade was so active that the packers
were put to their trumps to fill their orders, and the
wholesalers reported that they never had seen such
a business before, not even in the palmy old days
which the forty-niners talk about.
And so it has gone, all down the list. Everybody
has done well. The farmer has emerged from his
long eclipse and has money to spend once more.
The merchant again feels the satisfaction of the
tradesman when goods go out of his store about as
fast as they come in. The capitalist has no fear
that with the exercise of ordinary caution in putting
out his funds his interest will not be forthcoming in
due season. The wage-worker has less difficulty in find
ing employment, and when he gets it it is more per
manent. When times are brisk more men are needed,
and here is where the workingman is benefited by a
healthy state of trade, to say nothing of the better
wages he is likely to receive.
One of the best signs of prosperity at the moment
is the fine condition of the savings banks of the State.
There are fifty-six of these banks and their resources
on November 30 were in round numbers $148,100,000,
against $142,400,000 on the same datb In 1896. This
shows a gain for last year of $5,700,000.
Taken all in ail 1897 was not a bad year, but 1898
bids fair to make an even better record.
John Wanamaker says his daughter is not to marry
the brother of the Khedive. As the Wanamaker
family is not only civilized, but decent, his word will
be accepted without question.
If Durrant refuses to receive clergymen who de
cline to express belief in his innocence, there is a
probability that little of his remaining time will be
dftyotcd to receiving spiritual advice.
FLOURISHING CALIFORNIA.
GOLDEN, bountiful and splendid was the show
ing made for California in the annual review of
the State published by the Chronicle yesterday.
The statistics of the net results of our productive and
commercial industries are of a nature to confirm the
optimist in his hopes and confound the pessimist in
his despondency. They effectually attest the vigor
of the business energies of the commonwealth and
prove that even under existing conditions Califor
rian-. are rapidly carrying their State to the foremost
place in the Union.
Tiie fact that so much has been accomplished when
each man works for himself alone and when discords
pi avail in the ranks of almost every trade and pro
fession is the surest proof of what can be achieved
when the people work together, and the energies of
the city and the interior are combined for the general
good. The success attained in the construction of
the Valley Road and the benefits flowing from it are
object lessons in the value of co-operation. That
le<-?on has been learned. The intelligent people of
the city are now ready to unite for the upbuilding of
flit State, and when our contemporary publishes its
annual next year, it will have an even better array
ot statistics to show the progress of the State.
The review of the year made by the Chronicle
serves to emphasize the importance of a fuller and
mote elaborate treatment of our mining and allied
industries. This will be done in the grand Golden
Jubilee edition The Call is now preparing. In that
edition will be given the most complete and thorough
account of the mines and mining industry of this
section of the Union that has ever been published,
it is to appear January 23, and will be an attractive
and interesting feature of the Jubilee and the mining
exposition. It will thus complete what may be called
the holiday journalism of the year, and in the wide
f.cld it is designed to occupy will be by far the most
notable production of the season.
INCREASING REVENUES.
CONGRESSMAN DINGLEY makes a perti
nent and gratifying contribution to the sub
jects of New Year congratulations by pointing
cut in a clear and impressive manner the gratifying
it suits obtained from the revenue features of the new
tariff. The monthly treasury reports have made
known in a general way the increasing returns from
oustom duties, but we arc indebted to Mr. Dingley
for the most authoritative and definite statement of
the conclusions to be drawn from them.
In the first place it is noted that the revenues de
rived from the tariff have increased with each month
of its operation.
The revenue was only $19,000,000 In August ($7,
coo.ooo from customs, in consequence of the large
importations between March 1 and July 24 in antici
pation of the new tariff). It rose to $20,000,000 in
September ($8,000,000 from customs), to $24,000,000
in October ($9,750,000 from customs), to $25.
000,000 ($9,750,000 from customs) in the short
month of November, and now rises to nearly $28,
000,000 in December ($11,500,000 from customs).
Another important feature of the statement is the
lecord showing the increase of revenues for Decem
ber over those of the corresponding period of the
years of the Democratic tariff. The receipts this
year, excluding the amount received from the rail
road sale, were $26,i95-.000, leaving a surplus to the
Government of over $1,736,000. The receipts for
December, 1894, were $22,000,000. Those for De
cember, 1895, were only about $20,000,000, while in
December, 1896, they were even less.
Good as have been the results of the operation of
the tariff in the past there is every assurance that
those of the future will be better. The large impor
tation of foreign goods under the Democratic low
tariff early in the spring forestalled the coming of the
protective tariff, and as a consequence it has not yet
been fairly tested. As these goods are consumed
new importations will be required and there will he
a corresponding increase of revenues.
Taking all things into consideration, Mr. Dingley
estimates that the revenue derived under the new
tariff from this time until the close of the fiscal year
will exceed the expenditures. In other words, we
have reached the end of the period of deficit. From
this time on the income of the Government will be
equal to its aeeds. There is even an assurance of a
surp!us sufficient to pay off the Democratic deficit
and wipe that blot from the books of the national
treasury.
THE POSTAL REFORM BILL.
THE persons and corporations profiting by the
abuses of the existing postal regulations are
showing no little activity in mustering an op
position to the proposed reform urged by Congress
man Loud. Their organs in various parts of the
Union are incessantly misrepresenting the reform bill,
and where they do not openly denounce it they
endeavor to excite objection to it by innuendo.
Among the strongest opponents of reform are the
publishers of trashy novels and books more worth
less or more vicious still, and the publishers of so
called newspapers who circulate thousands of copies
of advertising circulars under the? pretense that
they are sample copies of legitimate newspapers.
Both of these classes of publishers arc injurious to
legitimate trade. There is no reason why the pub
lisher of a book on "The Fistic Prowess of Pompa
dour Tom," or a treatise on "How to Be a Pirate or
a Yellow Journalist in Three Easy Lessons," should
have the privilege 'of circulating them at the expense
of the Government while the publisher of a standard
work by a reputable author has to pay heavy postage.
Nor is there any reason why any person or corpora
tion should be permitted to circulate advertisements
at less than cost.
It is true, The Call will lose something by the adop
tion of the proposed amendment prohibiting the
sending of sample copies as second-class mail mat
ter. The Call has recently issued a grand edition
of 350,000 copies and is soon to issue another large
special edition. It is an advantage to have these
papers admitted to the mails at second-class rates.
Nevertheless The Call recognizes the justice of the
objection to such practices and heartily advocates the
reform.
The Call does not seel: its profit at the expense of
the taxpayers, nor does it admit the right of any

THE SA^T FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JAXUARY 3, 1898.
NOW FOR WORK
THE HOLIDAYS are over. The compliments
of the season have been passed to and fro, and
all the frolics duly enjoyed. Now we return
to business. To-day we begin in earnest the work
of the new year. The opportunities for improving
our conditions are many. It depends upon ourselves
how we will profit by them.
First and foremost we must make preparations for
the Golden Jubilee and the mining exposition. What
is to be done for these enterprises must be done at
once. The shortness of the time allowed for the
work does not admit of delay. Contributions for
the Jubilee parade should be made liberally and made
this week. As the parade is to serve as an intro
duction to the exposition all citizens should take a
pride in contributing what they can to make it a
pageant truly representative of the triumph accom
plished by California in the first fifty years following
the discovery of her golden treasures.
Along with the work performed for the Jubilee and
the exposition must be that carried on for the pur
pose of bringing to San Francisco the Alaskan out
fitting trade. This work has been well begun, and
is well advanced, but should be pushed forward. The
trade resulting from the rush for the Yukon gold
fields is to be the most important commercial boom
known to the Pacific Coast for many years, and it will
bt our own fault if we do not reap a rich and perma
nent profit from it.
The conditions of the State are of a nature to
encourage enterprise and business activity among its
people. The record of the fifty years since the dis
covery of gold has been one of the industrial won
ders of the age. Though one of the youngest of the
sisterhood of States, California is already first in the
production of gold, raisins, prunes, borax, beans,
oranges, wine and fruits. It is second in the pro
duction of nuts, wheat, lumber, barley, hops and
honey. Its soil is the most prolific and its climate
the most agreeable in the Union.
All the achievements of the past, however, have
hardly more than prospected the resources of the
State. Despite the number of articles of necessity
or luxury in the production of which we lead the
Union, California is virtually an undeveloped coun
try. There remain in every section of the com
monwealth as good opportunities for capital and
labor as any that have yielded fortunes to energy and
thrift in the years gone by. To exploit these as far
as possible is the duty of the time. Let us begin the
work with self-confidence and mutual harmony. The
year begins as a season of promise and will end as
cne of glorious realization if we make the right use
of our advantages and opportunities.
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA.
RUSSIA'S steadfast advance to a position
of dominant power on the Asiatic coast of the
Pacific is rapidly bringing her face to face with
the United States. The two nations whose develop
ment has been the most formidable factor of inter
national politics for the past century and whose
friendship has been one of the remarkable features
of the age, are at last to confront one another on a
scene where there is likely to be a conflict of interest,
for both desire trade with China, and the probable
outcome of the situation is one that will be sure to
engage the thoughts of statesmen in every part of
the world.
The old prophecy attributed to Napoleon that in
the coming century the world would be either Repub
lican or Cossack has been often recalled. All the cir
cumstances attending the history and progress of the
two nations tend to increase the impressiveness of
the prediction, and to encourage belief in a fulfillment
almost literal.
The reorganization of Russia by Peter the Great
in the early part of the eighteenth century was in the
latter part followed by the erection of the American
colonies of England as an independent nation. Thus
the two powers began their political career almost
ar the same time. Their remoteness did not long
keep them from exerting great influence on European
affairs. Both took an important part in the deter
mination of events during the Napoleonic wars, and
since that period both have grown so great they
have almost passed beyond rivalry on the part of any
other nation.
In the course of progressive development the re
public outstripped the empire. We reached the Pa
cific coast while Russia was still confined to the wild
steppes of Central Asia. We constructed our trans
continental railway before she even dreamed of one.
Slowly but surely, however, the giant despotism toiled
after the swift democracy, and now Russia has not
only a strong position on the Pacific, but is con
structing a railway which will connect it so closely
with other portions of the country as to make it one
of the most important features of the empire.
The present crisis may not produce a war, and
probably will not. When this is settled, however,
another crisis will come. The national life of China
seems exhausted, but the commercial and industrial
life of the Chinese people has such wonderful possi
bilities that all the progressive nations of the earth
are eager to gain advantages there for their trade.
In such a condition of affairs one crisis will be set
tled only to make way for another. Sooner or later
the law of the survival of the fittest will do its work
and the strongest will win. Who can doubt that the
strongest will be Russia?
When the period of Russian supremacy in China
comes we will have to negotiate our interests in the
Orient with the Russians. Then will come the test of
our friendship with that country. Then will it be de
cided whether the republic and despotism can agree
to divide the world between them on amicable terms,
01 whether they will grapple in an irrepressible con
flict and fulfill the Napoleonic prediction that the
world of the future shall belong to one of them alone.
So many curious things happen at San Quentin that
the mere circumstance of a convict's sending out a
prescription calling for a quart of alcohol might not
attract much attention. Doubtless, however, there
are penal institutions in which a prisoner is not ex
pected to diagnose his own ailments, nor write the
prescription therefor. The odd feature of this case
is that the paper should have been written in Greek
characters. Naturally the prison officials could not
read it, and their child-like trustfulness in letting it
pass adds an interest to the incident.
Many a habitue of Barbary Coast will learn with
pain that 200 kegs of American beer were recently
dumped into the harbor at Honolulu. There is a
degree of wastefulness shocking even to the Weary
Willies.
A policeman who staggers along his beat under a
burden of whisky is more in need of retirement than
is the sober policeman who walks straight despite a
burden of years.
Blanco could save much trouble by packing his
autonomy scheme in a handsatchel and taking him

IT WOULD MEAN THE ADMISSION OF A SLAVE STATE
New York Post.
It is very significant that the labor organizations of the country
are throwing their influence against the annexation of Hawaii. An
earnest protest against the scheme was recently mads by this element
in California, and since then the American Federation of Labor has
shown that workingmen throughout the land sympathize in this respect
with those on the Pacific Coast. The federation adopted a resolution
disapproving of annexation, on the ground that it "would be tanta
mount to the admission of a slave State, the representatives of which
would necessarily work and vote for the enslavement of labor in gen
eral"; urging the Senate to reject the treaty, and take such other steps
as may be necessary to maintain amicable relations with Hawai, and
providing that the executive council shall present these views to Con
gress, and, if necessary, to the President. Such a pronunciamento
from such a source will have much weight with politicians who have
no pronounced Convictions on the subject, especially with the members
of the House, if the treaty shall fail and the scheme shall be pushed
by joint resolution. A representative who sees no particular reason for
annexing Hawaii, anyway, will easily be persuaded to oppose the project
if "organized labor" in his district is ready to fight a Congressman
who favors the creation of what it considers likely to be "a slave State."
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS.
BY A MODEST CRITIC.
This being the season of the year when
men are prone to open their hearts for a
moment or two I will open mine. The
Examiner is the direct beneficiaryâ the
public the incidental. The paper referred
to has been good enough to offer unasked
time and again advice as to how a news
paper, In order to succeed, should be con
ducted. The advice has usually been di
rected to the editorial management, and
most of it has been but a cover for per
sonal spleen. If the Examiner will watch
this paper for a year or two I promise It
that it will be taught all it has attempted
to teach, but this being Yuletlde I will
save it at least for a few months of the
pain caused by inattention to the neces
sity of correct behavior. Having seen
the evolution of a successful newspaper
or two I have had one lesson clearly
taught me. This: In order to win and
keep the respect of its readers every
journal must be sincere in comment. The
Examiner is rarely that. To aver black
to be white one day and to Insist that it.
is of sable hue the next is inconsistent
as well as_ being insincere. "What follows
is from trie editorial columns of that pa
per on Wednesday last:
"The integrity of the Monroe doctrine,
with tha maintenance of our vantage
point of consistency on that issue, is
worth a good deal more to this country
than its Interest In China's trade. The
Monroe doctrine is something that by
Implication works both ways, and the
I'nited States cannot afford to surrender
any part of It by dipping into Europe's
embroilment over the affairs of the far
East."
The Examiner has advocated day In
and day out Interference with the Gov
ernment of the Hawaiian people by the
Hawaiian people, seeing in that polio
no deletion of the Monroe doctrine, but
in intervention in a squabble over China
and her affairs it discerns the complete
obliteration of this, our national policy.
A doctrine that is held by the nation
must be firmly held, no matter whether
it applies to affairs 3000 miles away or
10,000. When it is asserted that it will
destroy the Monroe doctrine to engage in
the Chinese embroilment, and that this
Stygian project â will not be accomplished
if we assume the right to control Ha
waiian affairs, either insincerity or alack
of reasoning power is shown. In the
Examiner's case it smacks of both.
It has been asserted by a prominent
controversialist that education for the
masses is a breeder of discontent. I dif
fer. This time is chosen for the expres
sion of the difference of opinion because
educators have, during the week past,
occupied a deal of public attention. Ed
ucation is almost entirely the training
of mmd â cultivation of brain power. It
imparts knowledge, too, doubtless. but the
increasing of the power to reason is
actually its chief value. The educated
man (all other faculties being equal) will
accomplish more in any given time than
can the uneducated. This applies to bak
ers and to fakers, as well as to tailors and
to sailors; In truth to the world. No
schemes yet devised, except actual war
fare with another nation, have proved
more prejudicial to the interests of na
tions than have strikes and labor riots,
and strikes and kindred follies are
caused principally by lack of education.
The average laborer is easily led astray
by the "walking delegate" (whose only
mission is to produce discontent), by an
assurance that "the rich are getting
richer and the poor are getting poorer
every day." The inaccuracy of this
statement he would readily see were his
mind well trained. But he sees it not,
so he is induced to strike, and not only
does he suffer for his folly but the whole
community Is compelled to. Is it not
wiÃe then to do what we can to prevent
suffering and waate of natural resources?
These are the two fruits of strikes and
labor riots Invariably.
An able collaborator suggests the
hanging of attorneys who attempt to
prevent the prompt execution of Justice.
If he will include inciters to "labor
troubles," when he next stints some peo
ple "like a white hot brand," he will
find one more mark on the credit side
of his account when he faces the record-
Ing angel. But I happen to think hang
ing far too good for attorneys who act
in this way. If the Bar Association
would see that they are denied the right
to practice they would probably starve,
and might perhaps find a living death.
Then the punishment would lit the crime.
It is scarcely to be expected that W.
W. Foote would so promptly verify the
statement that it was good for California
that he was not permitted by the Legis
lature to go to the Senate. Some, ttoe
ago it was stated that he had retired
permanently from his cheerful habit of
defending criminals, but now I am
pained to note that he makes his appear
ance in the most disgusting case ever
presented to any court. That Durrant
could permit his mother's and his Bisters
decency to be Impugned in an attempt
to save his precious neck is evidence
enough that he is unfit to live, and that
Mr. Foote could appear for him in such
an actionâ for that is what he virtually
didâ must be shocking to each acquaint
ance of his who knows what honor is. '
General Ballaine of "Washington has,
we are told by London dispatches, writ
ten to a prominent Journal of that city
voicing his annoyance at WÂ« T. Stead's
book, "Satan's Invisible World." This
warrior's letter is described as extraor
dinary, and It must be, for he avers that
the "real American of the West hates
New York as much as he hates London."
The "real American of the West" hates
no one without cause, and we have no
reason to hate the people of New York.
We joy occasionally because the part of
the Union in which we happen to live
has advantages which other States have
not, but that breeds not hate 'mongst
sensible men. Does this "general" wish
to divide the country longitudinally? An
attempt was once made to divide it
laterally and a repetition of that horror
no sane man desires.
Why any one on this continent should
care an atom as to what Mr. W. T. Stead
chooses to say of It passeth- comprehen
sion. He ia not a litterateur, nor is he a
competent critic. Failing, when editing
the Pall Mall Gazette, to command and
hold general attention by the excellence
of hiÂ» legitimate work, he descended to
sensation, and be has never cot out of
that glitter since. It was pointed out to
him when he first began his downward
course that if he had information fit for
police ears he should take it to the po
lice. What he alleged he had discovered
was no news. And he knew it too.
Mr. W. T. Stead is neither a keen ob
server, a clear thinker nor an able
writer, and each of these a competent
critic must be. His opinions when talk
ing of America and her institutions are
worth as much consideration as would
be a volume by his satanic Majesty on
heaven. It Is of record that the Prince
of Darkness was cast out of Paradise
and it is a fact that this Stead per
son has been shown that he has not
got brains enough to make his living in
America. That is true, and it is becauso
he is "neither fish, nor flesh nor good red
herring" that he is despised.
THE COAST PRESS.
John H. Delahanty, one of the old-tfme
Journalists of Oakland, has put on the
hirness once again, and is scintillating
through the columns of the Saturday

The Randsburg Miner affords striking
evidence of the increasing prosperity of
that camp by enlarging from four to six
pages, in order to accommodate a rapidly
growing patronage and at the same
time do justice to passing events in the
rich Mojave gold fields. "The develop
ment of our mineral resources," says the
Miner, "is being pushed forward, and it
is our intention to keep pace with the
onward march in this district."
Myron Angell, pioneer newspaper man
and historian of San Luis Obispo County,
is the author of a twelve-page pamphlet
entitled "The Climate and Wealth of San
Luis Obispo County, California." It con
tains statistical and descriptive matter
showing forth the. advantages of that sec
tion, and is illustrated with views of
Port Harford, the old San L'uis mission
and the most prominent county schools.
It is designed for Eastern renders, nml
should prove of much benefit to the fa

With the first of the year the Calaveras
Citizen changed hands, L. F. Jones, form
erly of Paso Robles, succeeding H. WÂ« 11.
Penniman as editor and publisher. The
retiring editor remarks, in his farewell
address, that the conviction had been
forced upon him that "one man cannot
act as real estate agent, photographer,
assayer and surveyor and run a news
paper at one and the same time," hence
his relinquishment of the Citizen, which
has certainly improved under his man
agement.
The special edition of the Redlands
Facts is an admirable number In every
way. It is called "Illustrated Redlands."
and contains a hundred pages, book pa
per, illustrated profusely with photo
gravures. An Idea of the scope of the
work may be obtained from the fact that
the illustrations embrace the portraits of
nearly 200 prominent citizens of the city
and vicinity, over 150 views of residences
and business blocks and some forty mis
cellaneous pictures. It is unquestionably
one of the tinest editions of the kind -ever
produced in California, and is a superb
advertisement for Redlands.
The thirty-six page edition of the
Seattle Press-Times, issued December IS,
is a number highly creditable to that en
terprising publication. It gives a large
amount of valuable Information concern-
Ing the State of Washington, and will be
of service to Seattle in making known
abroad her advantages as a commercial
city. 'A special object of the paper is to
attract thither as much as possible of
the Klondike trade. It is interesting and
pleasing to note the Press-Times' decla
ration to the effect that its circulation has
increased 100 per cent under its present
management and that the paper is to-day
paying satisfactory dividends and enjoy
ing a degree of prosperity unexampled
in its career hitherto.

LIVELY TIMES
AT A BALL GAME
Santa Cruz and California
Markets Nearly Had
a Mix-Up.
Murphy Hit McGrath With the
Ball and Was Put Out of
the Game.
The Alleged Champions Were "White
washed by the "Beach
combers."
Although the California Markets re
ceived a banner, a shield and a bag of
coin this does not give them license to
think they are the only players in the
field. That they are not was forcibly
brought to their knowledge yesterday
afternoon when the Kanta Cruz aggre
gation shut them out without a tally
and made it worse by scoring three
runs, giving them a victory.
Defeat was not the only thing they
suffered. Bad temper and the ruling
off of Murphy by Umpire McDonald
were added and can only be soothed
by ".Napoleon" Fagin" pouring dollars
on their head as a balm.
In running to first Fitzgerald collid
ed with Murphy intentionally or other
wise, spoiling what would have been a
double play. Murphy felt sore and this
feeling seemed to permeate the whole
team and every time a man ran to
first he would make a wild attempt to
injure Fitzgerald, who was playing the
initial position for Santa Cruz. The
latter team were not behind in return
ing the compliment and things began
to take on fighting color.
In the middle of the game McGrath
made a short bunt and reached the ba.g
before Murphy could remove his foot.
McGrath must have hurt Murphy's
foot, for the latter became angry and
threw the ball at the Santa Cruz
player, hitting him squarely between
the shoulders. McGrath returned with
the intention of doing Murphy an in-
Jury, but Umpire McDonald got be
tween them and prevented hostilities.
As a reward for his anger Murphy was
benched, Williams taking his place.
Outside of the trouble the spectators
were treated to some excellent ball
playing. It seemed Impossible for either
team to bring a man to third until
the seventh, when Santa Cruz broke
the spell. Devereaux surprised the
crowd by not being hit with the ball,
but his scientific way of standing at
the plate earned him a base on balls.
He cleverly stole second and reached
third on a single over short. Iberg
threw hard to Hearty at first to nail
Strieb, but Hearty dropped the ball
and LÂ»evereaux stole home, scoring the
first run. In the eighth McGrath sent
a hot drive to Bodie, who dropped the
ball. Fitzgerald singled past third
and Arellanes illled the bases with a
eingle to right. Iberg became nervous
and hit Williams, forcing McGrath in.
Stulz sent a grounder to EL Krug, who
returned the ball to the plate cutting
off Fitzgerald. Devereaux sent a pretty
one to center and Arellanes scored the
iast run for Santa Cruz.
Iberg pitched an excellent game, but
seemed to show signs of being tired
from his efforts the day before. Hughes
stamped himself as being the leading
tv trier in the State. He did not exert
himself owing to Daubenbis being un
able to hold him, but as it was he
pitched great ball.
Lievereaux led his team In fielding,
which was brilliant and received de
served applause. Henry Krug's work

Corbctt Was the Star.
Quite a large crowd attended the
: baseball game between the J. E. Pep
pers and the White House nines
at Recreation Park yesterday,
thereby swelling the Cuban fund. Both
teams put up a spirited game, giving
the crowd every opportunity to use its
lungs.
Joe Corbett proved the star feature,
as was expected. His all round play
ing, which bespoke Eastern coaching,
opened up the eyes of players who
thought they understood the finer
points in the game. Russell's pitching
was also of a high order.
Score: White House 9, J. E. Pep
pers 3.

The Second Coming of Christ.
At the Third Congregational Church
Rev. William Rader preached on "The
Second Coming of Christ." He said
in part:
The New Testament teaches a second
coming on the day of Pentecost, in the
destruction of Jerusalem and the end of
the Jewish state, In the crises of the
world, the development of the kingdom
and In person In that generation. The
New Testament writers were mistaken
In their belief of an Immediate coming,
the fact that he did not appear being
sufficient ground for such a statement.
In the twenty-fourth chapter of
Matthew our Lord referred to two
eventsâ the destruction of Jerusalem and
the second advent. He says In apparent
contradiction: "All will hapen in this
generation, and no one knows the time."
These are reconciled not by the doctrine
of "accommodation" or In the belief that
Jesus Bhared the false views of his
brethren, but that the two references
one to Jerusalem, the other to the ad
vent â were supposed to mean one and the
same thing. The interpretation has been
colored by the prevailing Jewish idea.
Henry Varley of England is a grand
man, but I believe his views on the sec
ond coming, teaching the return of Christ
as the king and ruler of the nations
are well founded neither in Scrip
ture nor reason. I believe his erroneous
instruction on the second coming is
doing incalculable harm among people
who are susceptible to that kind of doc
trine. The New Testament teachea the
return of Christ in character in the
church In crises and in person, the mean
ing and condition of which I cannot
venture to express an opinion. Our duty
is not to prophesy, to be anxious, or to
firedlct without reason, but to live sober
y, doing our duties, leaving the times
and seasons in the nanda of God.
BURGLARS AT
HER DOOR
Bold Midnight Visitors
Ransack Mrs. Pettee's
House.
Tried Windows, Then Climbed
the Porch and Searched
Many Rooms.
Pistol in Hand Within Her Room
She Awaited an
Attack.
Late New Year's night bold burglars
entered and deliberately ransacked
many rooms in the residence of John
Pettee at 2505 Leavenworth street,
while Mis. Pettee, in fear and tremb
ling, remained locked in her bed cham
ber, not daring to venture out, but all
the while conscious of the presence of
the dangerous midnight visitors In the
house.
Twice the unwanted New Year's
callers cautiously approached her
door, and twice she saw the knob turn
and return as the unseen hand with
out tested the lock that fortunately
did not yield.
Just before midnight Mrs. Pettee
heard the first suspicious noise that
alarmed her. It came from the room
in which the younger children's
Christmas tree was standing.
Then, as she became nervously alert,
she heard soft sounds of persons mov-
ing about downstairs. The sounds
continued, and her little daughter re
marked that there was some one in
the house. But, excited as she had
now become, the mother attempted to
pass the remark by as a product of un
warranted childish fear.
During a half-hour that seemed an
eternity to the trembling expectant lis
tener Mrs. Pettee caught occasional
suspicious sounds that indicated in a
general way the movements of the
burglars.
Next she heard a peculiar, low,
rumbling noise In the parlor. What it
meant she could not guess.
Then there was an awful silence for
fully half an hour until she again dis
tinguished the stealthy movements of
the men, now in the upper part of the
house, and presently just outside her
own door.
With pistol in hand Mrs. Pettee
tremblingly stood guard on her side
of the door, watched the knob slowly
turning and feverishly debated with
herself whether or not she had better
take chances and fire at random
through the door.
After a time no other Bounds were
heard. All remained quiet within the
house.
Early yesterday morning the full
significance of the noises of the night
was plainly evident in the wild disor
der of the rooms.
Everything that might have hidden
some valuable had been thoroughly
searched. From the parlor teatable
had been taken a dozen small gold
spoons and ten small 6ilver spoons
From the library the burglars had car
ried away all the specimens of gold
quartz, and from tho very room in
which young Pettee had retired at half
past 12 o'clock they had taken a new
razor that had lain conspicuously upon
a table.
Apparently nothing else of particu
lar value had been found, though a
large amount of plated ware in the
dining-room had been tested and ig
nored. The family plate, together with
personal jewelry, had. h-wever, been
safely deposited for the night in a se
cret vault in the room in which Mrs.
Pettee had remained an unintentional
guardian of valuables, fearing for her
life.
A further search show, d that the
burglars had tried with some instru
ment the locks of all the downstairs
windows on that side of the house
away from the stable in which the
three dogs are regularly shut up at
night. They had finally pained an en
trance by climbing the porch and rais
ing an upstairs window. Descending
from the upper hallway they, or nin
of them, had unbolted the front door
and unlocked the various doors open-
Ing on the lower hall.
The position of the upright piano in
the parlor indicated the cause of the
peculiar rumbling noise heard after
midnight.
The burglars had heard young Pet
tee approaching the front door and
they had probably moved the piano
out from the wall in order to obtain a
hiding: i-lace. As he entered he, too,
distinctly heard the rumbling noise,
but quietly went upstairs and retired:
so quietly, in fact, that Mrs. Pettee did
not hear him enter his room.
The police, notified at 7 o'clock yes
terday morning, are now working on
the case, with some sm.'ill clews and
the knowledge that several auspicious
characters have recently been seen
lurking in the vicinity.
SANTA CLARA HAS
ANOTHER FAST DOG
Curtis Lands a Good Coursing
Stake With Lady Camp
bell.
Gladiator Pulls Down the New Year
Stake for Puppies â Some Good
Sport.
Yesterday's coursing: at Ingleside
was productive of the keenest sport
put up on a coursing sward for many
years. The hares were strong. The
dogs were of the highest class. The
field was like velvet. The attendance
was the largest ever known In the his
tory of coursing in America, and the
best hounds won.
But thereby hangs a tale. At the
outset the talent plunged on Fleetwood
against Flashlight and won. Then the
talent whispered, "If Fleetwood can
only put out Blackette he is a stake
winner." Fleetwood did put out
Blackette, and did it cleverly. But he
didn't win the stake. Nor was he sec
ond; nor was he even third at the
close. There were other dogs in the
running. One of them was a kennel
mate of Blackette's, known as Lady
Campbell. She was not considered
dangerous. But she is a Curtis dog" of
Santa Clara, and "you can't beat 'em."
She downed the 3 to 1 favorite, Rusty
Gold; she ran away from Systematic;
and against Susie, Terry Butler's
crack, she won the stake.
Susie, too, was running viciously.
Most Complexion Powders
have a vulgar glare, but Pozjoni's is a true
beaatifier, whose effects are Listing. I
She was herself on the short end occa
sionally, but until she met Lady
Campbell there was nothing could
touch her.
In the puppy stake Gallagher was
deemed a "cinch." He demonstrated
his claims to the distinction by going
out In his first course against D. Chil
la's St. Nicholas, a puppy never before
running. The real battle of the young
sters was fought by J. Dean's Gladia
tor and J. Keenan's Royal Oak. The
latter was withdrawn after winning a
place in the final, which gave first
money to Gladiator.
It was the favorites' day. St. Nich
olas Jarred the knowing ones by de
feating Gallagher; Fleetwood's win
over Blackette was a solar plexus
blow; Lady Campbell laid low the
Colorado crack, Rusty Gold, with a
dull thud that moistened the eyelids
of form players; and in the byes there
were one or two "throw-downs." But
the talent had it in the end.
The best form work of the day was
done by Fleetwood, Old Glory. Duke of
Oak Grove, Susie and the winner, Lady
Campbell.
The running, summarized, was as
folows:
All-age stakeâ C. W. Dewianey's Fleet
wood beat J. Murnane's Flashlight: Cur
tis & Son's Blackette beat J. M. Hal ton's
Roving Arab; Deekelman & Panario's Old
Glory beat J. Seggerson's White Chief;
Ray & Trant's Sylvia beat J. McCor
mick's White Lily; Curtis & Son's Lady
Campbell beat P. McLaughlin's Lady
Perm; Simmons & Donahue's Rusty Gold
beat J. Murnane's Valley Maid; D. Shan
non's Senorita beat Ray & Trant'a
Eclipse; T. Butler's Susie beat Simmons
& Donahue's Mountain Beauty: A- Hig
gins' Duke of Oakgrove beat Gilt Edge
kennel's Gilt Edge; D. Shannon's Sys
tematic beat Highborn Lady in a bye.
Second tiesâ Fleetwood beat Blackette;
Old Glory beat Sylvia; Lady Campbell
beat Rusty Gold; Susie beat Senorita;
Systematic beat Duke of Oakgrove.
Third tiesâ Old Glory beat Fleetwood;
Lady Campbell beat Systematic; Susie
won a bye from Magnet.
Fourth tiesâ Susie beat Old Glory; Lady
Campbell won a bye from Lass o' Gowrie.
Finalâ Curtis & Son's Lady Campbell
beat T. Butler's Susie and won the
stake. Lady Campbell is by Skyrocket,
out of Lady H. Glenrtyne.
Puppy stake â J. Keenan's Royal Oak
beat Dillon & Reilly's Dauntless; J. Con
nell's Log Boy beat D. Shannon's Sprig
o' the Hill; D. Chilla's St. Nicholas beat
8. E. Portal's Gallagher: R. Pringle's
Gladys Pasha beat D. Shannon's So
prano; B. Dougherty's Farmer Hill bent
D. Ford's Handy Andy; J. Dean's Gladi
ator beat B. Dougherty's Lady Thorn
dyke.
Second tiesâ Royal Oak beat Lo? Boy;
Gladys Pasha beat St. Nicholas; Gladi
ator beat Farmer Hill.
Third tiesâ Royal Oak beat Gladys
Pasha after two "undecideds"; Gladiator
won a bye from Handy Andy.
Finalâ Royal Oak was withdrawn, tak
ing second money and allowing first to J.
Dean's Gladiator. Gladiator is by Said
Pasha, out of Mollie H, and whelped in
August of 1896. He Is one of the most
promising youngsters seen for many
months. He seldom "plays to the gal

every performance is consistent, speedy
and clever.
NEW YEAR'S SERMON.
This Theri)e Preached On by Dr.
Charles Edward Locke at Both
Services Yesterday.
Dr. Charles Edward Locke, at the
Central Methodist Church, preached to
a very large congregation yesterday;
the audience last evening crowded the
church to the doors. The theme in the :
morning was "Between Two Eterni
ties." Dr. Locke said that as he pass
ed over on the threshold of a new year
he seemed "to be standing on an isth
mus between two great continents; be
hind lies the past with its distant
mountains and valleys lost in the mist
of oblivion; before us stretches the fut
ure. Its paths are untrod, its exper
iences are untried." From the uplands
of the past he called up opportunity,
success, failure, disappointment, joy
and sorrow, and endeavored to impress
the lessons which each of these things
could teach; he then turned toward the
future, and asked how the new year
could be made fruitful and happy for
each person. Dr. Locke emphasized
the service which each person owes to
himself. He said that self culture
made men better members of society
and more useful to God. He also re
ferred to the duty to serve our fel
lows, and, finally, to the service which
each should render his God. There were
many beautiful poetical selections In
the sermon. The large audience listen
ed with unbroken attention. At the
close of the sermon twelve persons
united with the church.
Last evening Dr. Locke's subject was
"A New Year's Sermon on Life." Dr.
Locke said that salvation from sin did
not come by evolution, but by a new
creation, and, hence, the beautiful doc
trine of the new birth. The wicked
die not by an arbitrary, but by a nat
ural law, for sin is disobedience and
disobedience is penalty, and penalty is
death.
Dr. Locke will hold special revival
services every evening this week ex
cept Saturday, and each afternoon ex
cept Monday and Saturday. He will
preach short sermons each evening.

"The Greatest Sin a Christian Can

Father Calzla last evening denounced

which was based on divine revelation
from the Scriptures, was delivered be

"Mediums and fortune tellers are all

tend to read the future, and it is a sin
to consult one who pretends to read
and unveil the mysteries of time yet to
come. One by so doing joins in an
express compact with the devil, as he
agrees with the devil to carry out the
dictates of his will.
"By consulting and believing in me
diums and fortune-tellers, he who does
so accepts that medium or fortune
teller as his god. This may seem a
startling conclusion to reach, but in
accepting their statements of things
they claim will happen in the future as
true, it is a tacit acknowledgment that
i they are the possessors of knowledge
j that belongs alone to God, and is cred
â  iting them with divine perfection. In
1 consequence, in consulting one who
| pretends to read the future, one com
i mits the greatest of all sins as he does
: away, in his own mind, with God.
Many people say they go, but do not
i believe in the words of the mediums.
This is also a sin, as mediums, as the
co-operators of the devil, should re
! ceive no encouragement and should not
i be played with by those who profess to
: lead Christian lives."
In conclusion Father Calzta warned
the congregation against the ways of
the mediums and fortune tellers, and
prayed that those who had not never
would, and that those who had would
never again co-operate with those peo
ple whose acts were incompatible with
Christianity.

PAN QUENTJLN PRISON, Jan. 2.â
"vniliam Durrant. the father of the con
demned murderer of Blanche Lamont,
visited his son to-day. He, like Mrs.
Durrant, was not allowed to greet the
prisoner in his usual way, but was
kept outside the heavy bars and thick
wire screen of the death chamber. The
father spoke cheeringly to the con
demned man for nearly an hour, and
when he left he told his son to keep up
his oourasre, as there was still hope of
evading death on the gallows.
The father, after he left -> the con
demned cell, said that at present things
looked very dark for his son, but in a
few days, and before the fatal hour
named by the Court comes, the truth
of the dreadful murders would be made
known. Further than that he would
say nothing, but hinted that the com
ing week would see a great sensation
in the celebrated murder case and his
son would be exonerated of any com
plicity In causing the death of the two
girls in the Emmanuel Church nearly
three years ago.
The condemned man spent nearly all
yesterday reading. He spoke little with
his guards, and then it was to discuss
some of the problems brought up by
the religious works he was reading.
There were few visitors at the prison
to-day. Commander Booth-Tucker, ac
companied by Colonel Holland, Adju
tant Ferriss, Major Milsap. Major
Wenchell and Lieutenant-Colonel Evans
were early arrivals at the prison, and
they conducted an enthusiastic reli
gious meeting In the chapel. Nearly a
thousand convicts attended the meet

the first touchdown, but that honor
later lost its significance when the
game ended and they were declared
the losers. The playing of Miss

THE GOLDEN AGE
Dr. Stephens of Simpson Men)o
rlal Church SpeaKs of a
New Era,
At Simpson Memorial Church last
night Rev. John Stephens took for the
topic of his sermon "The Golden Age."
He said, in part :
"The literature of the world all
place the Golden Age in the remote
past. We have every reason to hope
and believe that a mnre glorious era is
to come. Many are perplexed about the
great political and social disturbances
of the times, wondering what the out
come Is to be. The Scriptures place be
fore us the hope of new heavens and a
new earth, wherein all shall dwell In
righteousness. Three considerations
help us to believe that this will be ac
complished. God Is manifestly work
ing to effect his purpose, and the de
sign of the coming of the Son of God
will net be permitted to fail. The
world Is in the possession of great
Ideas and moral truths which have
been accomplishing marvelous trans
formations, and will continue to work
among men until the world is saved
for God. The unfilled prophecies of the
Scriptures give to us a glorious pros
pect, and while many speak of Bpem
ing impossibilities, remember what is
impossible with us is possible with
God."
Bishop Nichols Delivering the Opening Address of the Year Before
the Y. M. C. A.
The first Sunday of the new year was made notable at the Y. It C. A. building yesterday afternoon by the
presence on the platform of the main hall of the full vested choir from the Church of the Advent and of the
Right Rev. W. F. Nichols, Episcopal Bishop of California, who delivered an address on the "Prodigal Son," as an
example of the development of a true Christian character that might well be followed by young men during the
new year.
The choral singing was especially pleasing to the large audience, composed mainly of elderly persons.
In some remarks preliminary to Bishop Nichols' address, Secretary McCoy announced that the association had
for tho first time in many years just been able from its own revenues to complete a year without a deficit. He
also referred to a certain well-known business man in this city who is at the head of a great enterprise that has
3500 branches and who had at Christmas time sent to the Y. If. C. A. $1650 to make 165 young men in his employ
members of the association.
During his address BJs-hop Nichols in substance said there are three distinct stages tn the character of the
prodigal son. The first was, he began to be In want. The second was. he came to himself. The third was, he
said, "I will arise and go to my father." In this Prodigal Son we see the forces at work that, away from the
gospel and away from the advice of friends, are pushing this young man toward God. His difficulty was not
scientific nor philosophical, but a close personal difficulty.
A new element of the prodigal's manhood comes into play in his declaration. "I will arise and go to my
father." I think he was a strong character.
Many a parent comes to rue it in after years that he did not recognize In his little child's strong will the first
signs of a strong character. .Â»â  . , * â  â  i Â«^ 4 i/"***-â I J-
My New Year's wish for you Is that first you will Intelligently analyze your own condition- that you will clas
sify yourself. Now do you know what you ought to do? If you are not the man to rise up now and do the thing
that you have been thinking of doing, you are not in the position of the Prodigal when he said "I will go back
to my father." Take the little things of life before which you have been faltering and do them now and this year
will be the happier for it.
ANNUAL RALLY
OF THE LEAGUE
Services at Holy Cross
Church for the Cadets
of the Cross.
Archbishop Riordan Preaches
at St. Mary's
Cathedral.
Change of the Hours for Masses on |
Sundays at That Church
Hereafter.
The annual religious rally of the
League of the Cross was held this year
at the Holy Cross Church, and the
youths belonging to that body marched
In the church promptly at 7:30 in the
evening. They first recited the Pater
Noster, Aye Maria and the Credo. This
was followed by all singing the Veni
Creator, after which a sermon was
preached by Father O'Ryan, the direc
tor of the League. Then followed the
benediction of the Most Holy Sacra
ment, during which time an Act of
Reparation to the Sacred Heart of
Jesus was read, the rally concluding
with the singing of the Adeste Fidelis
and the Te Deum.
The archbishop preached at the
cathedral yesterday morning, choosing
for his subject the "Way We Regard
God." His sermon was short but to
the point. He said, in part:
To the pagan man of old God was the
god of power, the god of thunder, of
lightning, of wind and wa\e. Ke wmi a
god of law. God was then a far away,
an unapproachable Almighty. Man looked
toward him in fear and tremblinp. How
different God become* to us in the new
order of things. Bethlehem brought God
nearer and dearer to man. Bethlehem
made man nearer to God. Go^l be ..ni>
man and lived amid men. While still to
man God is the might of all power and
the God of strict law, yet in the incarna
tion the Almighty becomes known I
to man as the God of Love. As love and
the object of all love the incarnate God
is no longer far away, unapproachable,
but near and sought after by man, the
adopted child.
The Forty Hours' Devotion was cele
brated at* the chapel of the Presenta
tion Convent yesterday. The decora
tions were most artistic and the sing
ing by the sisters was beautiful.
The hours for mass have been changed
at St. Mary's Cathedral on Sundays.
Formerly they were 6. 7. 8, 9 and 10:30;
hereafter they will be 6, 7, 8, 9:30 and
11. The hours nrÂ«Â» thought to be better
suited to all elapses of people. It is
intimated that this chancre will soon
take place in all the Catholic churches
of the diocese.
RUNAMAYS AT THE PARK
Miss Maud fldams Seriously In
jured â American Compositions
Rendered by the Band.
Two runaways, one of which resulted
in the serious injury of a young woman,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MOXDAY, JANUARY 3, 1898.
marred the pleasure of the day at
Golden Gate Park yesterday. The first
occurred shortly after 2 o'clock. A
handsome black horse, driven by S.
Swedocker, who was accompanied by
a lady companion, took fright near the
music stand and dashed down the main
driveway. Mr. Swedocker found great
difficulty in handling the frenzied ani
mal, and had about given up hope of
avoiding a serious accident when Offi
cer Com:>her, mounted on a vaquero
hone, UMMd his riata over the run
away animal and brought it to a
standstill. The occupants of the buggy
hastily alighted and took a car home.
Later the owner of the horse and
buggy went to the police station and
claimed his property.
Half and hour later a runaway of a
more serious nature occurred. An am
bitious team, driven by G. Adams of
1704 Larkin street through some unas
certainable cause ran away. The team
started on its mad flight in the old
fair grounds road. and. when it
reached the south drive. Miss Maud
Adams, who was riding with her father
sprang from the buggy. She lay
when' she Mi, and when she was
picked up it was ascertained that she
had suffered a fracture of the left leg
below the knee. About 100 yards
farther on the buggy was overturned,
and Mr. Adams was thrown to the
ground, but he escaped serious injury.
The team was captured by Officer Cav
anaugh. who took it to the park sta
tion. Miss Adams was placed in the
patrol-wagon and removed to the Park
Receiving Hospital, where the broken
bone was set and the limb dressed, and
later she was taken to her home.
The compositions of American com
posers constituted the programme ren
dered by the park band yesterday, and
elicited much applause from thf gath
ering that sat and listened. Owing to
the threatening weather the crowd at
the park and Cliff House was not as
large as usual. Many people enjoyed
the day at the Chutes and at Sutros
baths, but returned into the city
early, as the fog and chill were not
compatible with comfort.
IN THE TENNIS COURTS.
A Continuation of the Games in
the San Francisco Grounds.
The games of lawn tennis which were
commenced at the California grounds
on Saturday were continued yesterday
without intermission. The spectators
were numerous and of the upper crust
of San Francisco's best and smartest
set. The applause given the players
by the occupants of the reserved row
were both hearty and generous, suffi
ciently so to bring the game of lawn
tennis within the charter lines of elite
spurts.
Fol lowing are the scores: First
classâ S. 11. Adams against Dr. C. B.
Root, the former winningâ 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Dr. Root's game was characterized by
many brilliant strokes, but the steady
safe-playing of his young opponent
finally enabled him to win it.
Bradshaw and Harry Weihe also tried
conclusions for qualification to the
same finals, the former winning by a
score of 2-6, 6-2, 6-4.
The second class was decided Satur
day in favor of Nelson Eckert.
In the third class Raco defeated Her
man Meyer by a score of 6-1, 6-2. He
and Kellogg also played, it being a tieâ
6-4. 4-6.
George Whitney and Harry WelHe
played Root and Pliven in doubles, the
former winning by 6-4, 8-6, 6-7.
NVxt Wednesday mixed doubles will
be played on the courts of the club.
The grounds are open to the public, no
admission being charged and extra ac
commodations for handling the crowds
will be made.
A NEW CREDENCE TABLE.
Another Memorial at St. Steph-
en's â f^ev. Dr. Lior) Delivers an
Interesting Sermon.
St. Stephen's Episcopal Church Is
rich In memorials, for besides the new
pulpit used for the first time on New-
Year's day, the Ladles' Aid Society of
the church has given a beautiful
credence table in honor of Mrs.
Francis M. Woster, who was for many
years president of the society. The
table 1b gothlc in design, richly carved,
and composed of quartered oak. It
bears the following inscription: "In
Memory of Mrs. Francis Woster, a
Founder of This Parish, April 13. In
her tongue the law of kindliness."
Rev. K. J. Lion, the rector of the
church, Fpoke last night on "The Medi
ation of the Blessed Virgin." He
dwelt particularly on the beautiful
character of the Virgin, and said she
was a woman of thought. He then
spoke of her influence In molding the
character of the infant Jesus, and said
that many mothers of to-day would
do well to Imitate her and give more
thought to their children. "If more
would do this." he said, "a great deal
of the crime and corruption of to-day
would be done away with."

Two Converts at the Vol-

Meeting.
Metropolitan Temple Well
Filled With Army Fol- %
lowers.
1 Speechesand Prayep-Captain Thoma*
Will Be Married This
Morning.
Metropolitan Hall was yesterday the
scene of the most successful testimony
meeting held In this city since the
organization of the Volunteers of Am
erica. The great assembly room was
filled to overflowing In both the after
noon and evening by the friends and
members of the organization, and
through Its services it has gained both
strength and prestige.
The meetings held yesterday were
the Inaugural sessions of a conference
which will last several days, In which
the officers cf the Volunteer Army will
be restationed. About noon the offi
cers and soldiers of the various
posts reported at headquarters and fell
In line for the march to the Temple.
Over 200 members in uniform were In
line constituting a formidable body to
do battle against the works of the
devil. The line of march took in the
main streets of the city and then to
the hall. Arriving at the hall the tes
timony services began.
In turn the Volunteers told the story
of their lives and how and when they
joined the cause of Christianity and
put on the garb of Salvationists. Many
told of past experiences of sin and
faithlessness and of its evil results
that almost left themselves wondering
how it came to pass that they turned
from such ways and took up a cause
ennobling both to themselves and to
mankind. When all had completed
their stories two among the spectators
walked upon the stand and repudiated
the world of sin, stood converted and
went into the ranks of the army. This
completed the services of the after
noon, but in the evening the hall was
again filled by those who wished to
hear the proceedings of the Salvation
ists.
Lieutenant-Colonel Sturgin was the
first to address the audience. As
the theme of his remarks he selected.
"As Ye Sow, So Shall Ye Reap." The
oft-told story of how good deeds will
bear their fruit was told in new vein
by the speaker.
Lieutenant-Colonel Sturgin was fol
lowed by A. D. C. Maxwell and Mrs.
A. D. C. Rodgers, the evening's meet
ing concluding with a solo rendered by
Brother Carwell.
This morning at 9 o'clock at Post No.
3, California and Kearny streets, a
council pertaining to the restationlng
of the officers will be held. In the af
ternoon the under officers will hold a
meeting at 769 Market street. At Met
ropolitan Temple in the ev^nin^ an
event of importance In the history of
the Volunteer Army will take place.
Captain Thomas of San Jose will be
married to a young woman from
Stockton. The name of the young
woman is zealously kept secret by
those who know It, but to-night the
stage of the temple will be their altar.

yOS Broadway, Jan. 2.
Something that was printed last
Monday morning in this column pro- j
yoked an anonymous reply that was
received during the week. Letters In
the nature of orphans are not usually .
deemed to be worthy of notice, but the \
one in question has its authenticity bo
poorly disguised that it merits mention. |
After a rambling introduction the pur- j
pose for which it was written appears '
In the following statement: "Republi
cane for years have kept in place, on |
the Police and In the Fire departments.
All faithful men they found there re- j
gardless of their political surroundings :
â but they have speedily rid the de- j
partment of incompetent men, regard- i
less of their political leanings."
This is both true and untrue. As re
gards competency, the various police ;
and fire boards have always acted with <
justice and fairness, but where both ;
competency and party affiliation are j
called into question there is yet to be !
found a comparison for the present j
condition of affairs. Surely this anony- j
mous writer . ish to infer j
that there are not plenty of competent
men in the Republican party to run
the whole of the city government. If i
so he should borrow \Y. li. Davis'
scrap-book for a few hours.
Oakland has a lady editor and news
paper â  r and she is a woman i
from Alpha to Omega. She is a great |
advocate of women's advance along |
all lines, and in her weekly paper j
there is generally something so thor- j
oughly feminine that it keeps men i
guessing for a week as to what is the I
Bolution. Miss Mollie Conners, for !
everybody knows her, published her i
New Year's enigma yesterday, and as i
it has a political and prospective ele- j
ment in it, the eleven men to whom it
. refers would give a handsome bonus to
know just who and what the lady :
means. The eleven men constitute the !
City Council and this is the lady's New
Year criticism of them:
"After all. I had a great deal rather i
deal with a wicked, boodling Council j
than with a stupid one. Every other
New Year has a great deal better
chance than Iâ for such stumbling
blockheads have rarely been seen as are
acting in the capacity of City Fathers.
Fathfrs forsooth! They are like old
men in their dotage â stiff-necked, stub
born old men â just 'sot'; only two i
members who are acting at all Intel- j
ligibly. The others think they own the
town and everybody In it â well, they ',
do not own the New Year; not just
yet. We will stand them for the com
ing year â making it as warm for them
as we can â thank heaven, they haven't
any special corner on the office, and
none at all on our affectionsâ and we
will call them down In a few more
months."
Now, who are the two? The lady
tells me she has already thanked
twelve times â Mr. Prlngle did it twice
â for "your kind little reference to
me."
Next Wednesday evening the gentle
men interested in the Alameda end of
the tidal canal controversy will meet
and see if anything can be done with
that obstinate man â Colonel Suter, the
Government engineer.
Just what Alameda expects to do is
not quite clear. T. G. Daniels, who
has lived in the city across the estuary
long enough to know all about it and
Its inhabitants, is evidently not very
F.anguine of his townsmen's success.
Last Thursday Mr. Daniels said:
"The committee is reported to have
returned from its conference with
:;el Suter with a glum coun
tenance. "What the colonel said can
only be surmised, for the committee
will not speak until it speaks in public
n^xt Wednesday. What the committee
could have said to the colonel Is about
as much a mystery as what the colonel
oould ( have said to the committee.
nel Suter had reported, as the en
gineer in charge, that the completion
of the tidal canal was not only not
r.^oessary to the harbor Improvement,
but that it would prove disastrous to
it. He may have been wrong, as other
engineers just as eminent and who
had devoted more time to a considera
tion of the subject had reported just
the reverse. Still, as the officer now

in charge, he Is on record as to the
subject. Was it thought that an Ala
meda committee could induce him to
reverse himself before the War De
partment and the world? And es
pecially when the committee came
from a meeting that had questioned
his honor? There was not a great
plowing quantity of wisdom mani
fested in this whole action, and it may
be added that Alameda's interests in
the matter have been handled all
along with a singular lack of tact."
Meanwhile Oakianders, who now see
a prospect of getting all they want,
are sawing wood silently.
The ladies of Oakland are wielding
their new reform broom with such
vigor around the pedestals of some of
man's prerogatives that they are liable
to jar them considerably, if not sweep
them clean out of existence. One of
these time-honored customs that are
agitating the ladies is that of traveling
out between the acts at the theater.
It is bad enough, say the ladies, for the
frentlemen to crush the hats which
they have compelled them to doff as
they rise with clockwork regularity at
the drop of the curtain and file out.
But this keeps the outer doors open
long enough to send chilling currents
down to play tag over the shoulders
of those who have remained in their
seats, and the good natured, satisfied
demeanor of their escorts as they
march back hardly compensates the
ladies for the discomfort they have
endured.
The ladies are proud of the pretty
playhouse, but they do not believe it
adds to tin' attractiveness of the audi
ence to see the ladies huddled in their
wraps and the gentlemen sitting with
their overcoats on. And certainly there
is no one who will for a moment be
lieve that appreciation of grand opera
or tragedy is enhanced by a continual
staccato accompaniment of barks and
sneezes from the audience.
Superintendent of Streets Miller
should be a little more diplomatic. A
few nights ago the Street Committee
of the Council held a meeting and a
communication was read from an Irate
taxpayer that contained many pages
of vituperation and personal abuse of
Mr. Miller that had no relation at all
to the merits of the Issue between the
Superintendent and the taxpayer. Mr.
Miller asked that the letter be re
turned to the writer and said that all
the writer wanted was to see the letter
in print. "If the letter be read," said
Miller, "It will simply gratify the
writer's desire. There are newspaper
men here, and It will be in all the
papers to-morrow morning." So far I
have failed to see one line of the letter
in print. STTWRT W. BOOTH.
REPLY TO REV. MR. GEOGHEGAN.
Pastor Hatch Says Christ Was Not
an Ordinary Man.
BERKELEY, Jan. 2.â ln his last
Sunday's sermon Rev. Dr. Geoghegan
of the Unitarian Church said that
Christ was an ordinary man, but a
good religious teacher. He also said
that as far as honesty, uprightness
and devotion to principles were co"h
cerned there were thousands, !f not
millions, of men as good as Jesus
Christ.
Rev. G. B. Hatch of the Congrega
tional Church replied to these re
marks this morning. He declared
that Christ was not an ordinary man,
but that those who believed him to be
such did so on their own responsibil
ity. He himself believed Christ to be
divine, and feit sorry for those who
chose to believe otherwise. Mr. Hatch
further said: "There are many men,
DR. AND MRS. FRED H. METCALF, the Principals of Society's
New Year's Wedding in Oakand.
it Is true, who. from a moral point of
view are as good as Jesus Christ, and
those of us are to be pitied who do
not know such men."

NEW TEAR'S
FIRST BRIDE
Dr. F. H. Metcalf Weds a
Tacoma Belle in
Oakland.
Very Pretty Ceremony at the
Curtiss Home in East
Oakland.
Miss Zillah Mann Becomes the Bride
of a Well-Known Sac
ramentan.
x Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 2.
The new year opened auspiciously
for society, for just a couple of hours
before its initial day closed there was
a very pretty and quift wedding In
East Oakland at the lovely home of
Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert L. Curtiss on
East Seventeenth street. The occasion
was the marriage of Dr. Fred H. Met
calf of Sacramento to Miss ZUlah Hor
tense Mann of Tacoma, a graduate
of Mills College.
The house was beautifully decorated
with ferns and white flowers, mostly
lilies, and the approach to the front
door was illuminated with strings of
grotesque Chinese lanterns.
The ceremony was performed ac
cording to the rites of the Episcopal
church by Rev. Marshal Law, D.D.,
rector of the Church of the Advent.
The bridal couple stood under a pretty
bower built of greenery and white rib
bon and ornamented with white doves.
The bride, who is a charming petite
brunette, was gowned In rich brocaded
satin, and carried an armful of Ameri
can beauty roses, was attended by Mi?s
Hazel Curtiss, who, attired in pale blue
silk only, looked a little less fascinat
ing than the bride. The dazzling sun
burst worn by the bride was the gift
of the groom, and she was given away
by William Curtiss. Dr. F. H. Kestlar
was the supporter of the groom.
During a pause In the ceremony Miss
Whitely, who was in a parlor on an
upper floor, sang very sweetly "Oh,
Promise Me," and the clear notes
seemed to fill the large parlors where
the ceremony was performed. After
the ceremony the guests Inspected the
many handsome presents In the billiard
room, and were entertained at tete-a
tete tables in the dining-room.
Dr. F. H. Metcalf Is one of the best
known men in his profession in the
State. He is president of the Sacra
mento County Dental Society, and has
also been honored by being elected
first vice-president of the California
State Dental Association. He is also
a member of the State Board of Dental
Examiners. The bride is very popular
in local society, and has hosts of
friends.
Among those who attended the pretty
New Year's wedding were: Mr. and
Mrs. Q, W. Metcalf of Douglas (Wyo.),
Daniel McKay and Mr. and Mrs.
Bowers of Sacramento, Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Corder, Miss Amy Corder and
others from San Francisco and Oak
land.

Effect of Good Advice at a
New Year's Eve
Party.
Twelve Hours Later She Was the
Wife of Pedar Sather
Bruguiere.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 2.
Society on this side of the bay was
severely startled to-day on learning
I that two of its best-known young peo
j pie now living in San Francisco had
MRS. P. SATHER BRUGUIERE, Formerly Madeleine McKisick,
Who Surprised Sociely by Her Hasty Marriage*
Ignored all the usual proprieties and
had been married on New Year's day
without giving any notice of their In
tention. The young folks are Miss
Madeleine McKlslck, daughter of
ex-Judge L. R. McKisick, and Pedar
Bruguiere.
On Xew Year's eve ex-Senator
Frank J. MofHtt and wife pave a party
at their lovely home on Filbert street.
There was a large number of young
people, and among them were Miss
McKlsick and Mr. Brugulere. During
the supper which was served near
midnight. Senator Moflitt made a little
speech, which It is now claimed op
erated as a strong though Innocent
Incentive to the hasty wedding.
"When I look back on the pleasures
of my life that are directly traceable
to my home," he said, "I cannot but
look with Interest and with some anx
iety upon the many young people here
who are Just upon the threshold of
what may be called the responsibility
of life. However, do not be deterred
from anything that is right by the fear
of failure. Whether it be a business
proposition or whether it be marriage,
do not let a lot of visionary troubles
deter you from facing the battle.
Never was there a time when society
needed more the refining influences of
homes than the present.'"
The speech was applauded by none
more than by the two young people
who have Just startled society. Within
twelve hours they had acted upon the
Senator's advice. They procured a li
cense and were married by Rev. Rob
ert C. Foute yesterday, and lost no
time In elling their respective families
of what they had done. This afternoon
the usual little formal notices were
sent to the newspaper offices and the
secret was everybody's
Miss Madeleine McKlsick was one
of the most popular young ladles In
Oakland, and took a prominent part
In church entertainments. She was a
prominent figure at social gatherings,
and a leader among the younger set.
On one occasion she scored a happy
success by her Impersonation of Trilby.
Pedar Bather Bruguiere Is one of the
wealthiest of Oakland's young men,
and very rvopular. He has not long
completed his studies, and his name
had never been connected with that of
the young lady who is now his wife.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. ThÂ« top fig

for the days; those underneath It, if any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted show In Inches
and hundredths during the past twelve hour*.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The wind "high" means high
barometlc pressure and Is usually accompanied
with fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the preÃsure Is high In the interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south alone the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

Forwarded â Report on Vessels
for the Naval Militia.
The month's freedom from drills
which the National Guardsmen have
enjoyed has come to a close, and from
row on they will be required to attend
to drills, and if they do not and no
good reason is shown, the officers at
general headquarters will want to
know the reason why. It is likely that
the provisions of the Political (.'ode as
to non-attendance at drills will be en
forced.
On Xew Tear's eve there was a
"watch night" at the Regimental and
the Ellis-street armories by such of
the soldier buys who were not out on
Market street watching the old year
out and the new one in. At the Ellis
street Armory Companies C and G, as
usual, had a collation and singing, be
ing merry at the close of the old and
the beginning of the new year.

position of engineer officer on the
brigade staff, has accepted and ten
dered his resignation as an officer of
the Fifth. He succeeds Charles H.
Murphy, promoted to the division
staff, and will rank as major.
The board of officers of the First
Regiment of Infantry will meet on the
second Thursday In the month for ihe
purpose of laying out work for the
current year, arrange for company
shoots and also discuss the proposed
entertainment to be given in aid of
the rifle range fund.
During the month of December there
â¢were discharged from the Fifth In
fantry nine men, for the following
reasons: Expiration of term of service
four and removal five.
Sergeant J. F. Hintermeyer of Com

Colonel Fairbanks, commanding the

of the bc-ard of officers of the regi
ment for this month for the purpose
of laying out a system of drills, to
arrange a uniform system of rifle prac
tice outside of the State shoots which
take place in January and May, so
that the shotting will be conducted
in accordance with the new firing reg
ulations. A number of matters that
will be for the advancement of the
regiment will be brought up and dis
cussed.
The several companies of the Fifth
Infantry will make arrangements for
the State shoot for January.
The reception and ball that was
given last Friday night by Company
F of thp Fifth Infantry in its armory
in Oakland was a very successful af
fair, and there was a large number <rt
the friends of the members of the com
pany in attendance.
THE UNIFORMS.
On last Thursday the uniform board
sent on to the Pettibone Company the
contract for the making of the uni
forms for the organizations outside of
the naval militia, and on the following
day the contracts for th^ uniforms for
the naval branch of the guard were
forwarded. The president of the
board stated that the contracts are so
drawn up that the contractors will
have to comply with the most minute
details of tho specifications, and that
unless all the specifications are com
plied with the goods will not be ac
cepted. As yet there is no informa
tion as to the time when the new uni
forms may be expected.
TROOP A, CAVALRY.
Xo election has yet been ordered to
fill the vacancy existing in Troop A.
cavalry, caused by the dismissal from
the service of Charles A. Jenks as cap
tain of the company. Lieutenant Bur
nett will be a candidate for promo
tion, but it is doubtful if ho will se
cure the position hp would wish to til!
For oppements he has Major Jans'-n.
at present Inspector of the Second
Brigade, and Lieutenant Colonel Den
nis Geary (on the retired list) of the
mustered out Second Artillery. The
last two named each has a war rec
ord, and the major his a good repu
tation as a Orst-dass cavalry officer.
NAVAL MILITIA.
Louis 11. Turner, commanding the
Naval Militia, visited .Mare Island last
week and made another Inspection of
the Marion and of the Pinta, prepared
a report upon each vessel . and has for
warded the same to the proper au
thorities. It 5s pro-bable that not many
days will pass away before the Marion
will be towed to thip. port and will be
turned over to the first and second di
visions of the militia for their use.
Barry Urged for Office
There is quite m local movement In
favor of James HT Harry for Railroad
Commissioner in place of the late Dr.
James T. Stanton. His frtanda in tabor
circles as well as many business men
favor the nomination, because Barry is
â¢well known as a leader of the prole
tariat, yet he also baa ;i wtde and favor
able acquaintance with the business men
of the city.
When seen on the matter yesterday
Mr. Barry said: "It is strange that I am
mentioned for so many offices when I
have refused twn <>r three and when I
an a candidate for none. 1 refused to
be KoKistrar and Supervisor, but there
miffht be some sense in being Railroad
â¢."onimissionrr. It is an oftioe that offers
opportunities for conservative work. I
nave bad no intimation that the Gover
nor warns me to act. nor have I made
any Offht for the place."
REV. MR. DAVIS WILL REMAIN.
Proposes to Sec the Congregation
in a Coromodious Auditorium.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.â The members
of the Central Christian Church were
called upon yesterday to vote on the
extension of a call to Dr. Edwards
I 'avis. The vote was unanimous. At
the end of the third year the pastor
resigned within viev of entering the
evangelistic field. But the new call
is such that he has decided to begin
his fourth year with the church.
At the beginning of his pastorate
the brethren numbered but fifty;
since then the membership has in
creased to five times that number.
Over $5000 has been extended in sus
taining the work. In his acceptance
of the call Dr. Davis said:
Our beginning is past. Much of our time
hitherto has been consumed perfecting
our organization. Our growth, though
rapid, has been gradual. This body of
over 200 members, because of your har
mony, may expect to remove mountains.
Let faith be our power. It is my pur
pose to see you housed for worship and
work in one of the most commodious audi
toriums wtthin this city within a few
months. Our plans as to this will be
presented immediately. Your invariable
co-operation heretofore mukes me anticl
â¢ your support now in this strategic
undertaking- Our work must be aggrcs
sivt-. We must accomplish something for
the masses at the city. Oakland needs a
c's church, which it has not nowâ a
church where the common people can
hear God's word gladly.
THE REGULAR
ARMY NOTES
Citizens No Longer Barre
From Crossing the Presidio
to Fort Winfield Scott.
Reports Which Show What the Pre
sidio Light Batteries Did With
Shot and Shrapnel.
According to orders Monday, the 3d
inst., was the last of the holiday sea
son at the military posts in the De
partment of California, and after that
date it was work again with the rou
tine of drills, guard mount and all
that there is in the school of the sol
dier.
While the soldiers were resting the
civilians who work for the military
branch of the Government did not en
joy the ten days' exemption from labor
that was accorded to the soldiers, but
they were engaged in the delivering at
the Fort Point fortifications of cast
ings and other materials to be used in
the mounting of the heavy guns
there, and even New Year's day was
not a holiday for them, for on that day
some of the heavy castings drawn by
sixteen-horse teams were being deliv
ered.
The order that several months ago
was issued to the effect that those who
! were not connected with the military
service or in the employ of the mili
tary authorities would not be permit
ted to approach within a mile of any
of the fortifications has been modified.
; Under that rule no one, unless "for
miltary reasons," could cross the Pre
sidio and walk to or around Fort
Winfield Scott at Fort Point, but now
! that has been so modified that citi
1 zens may approach that old model of
; defense, and the guards that were
â  posted within a mile of the fortifica
| tions have been withdrawn and are
â¢now placed within 500 yards of the
I big suns.
The result of the elementary battery
service and competitive target prac
tice held at Redwood City during the
past season by the light batteries, C
and F, of the Third Artillery, with 3.2
breech-loading lit-l<l rilk-s, has been
announced. The charges used were
3.5-pound sphero (U. F.) powder and
the projectiles were percussion shell
and shrapnel of 13.5 pounds weight.
At elementary practice each battery
fired forty-three rounds, twenty-seven
with shell and sixteen with shrapnel
and 2131 and 2112 range. C Battery
had ton and F six defective shrapnel.
The target was a vertical canvas ten
by twenty yards. C Is credited with
325 hits and F with 620.
At battery service practice each
fired sixty-four rounds, the former
with forty-one shell and the latter
with forty. The ranges were 2156 and
2084. C had seventeen and F eleven
defective shrapnel. C made 228 hits
and F 414.
At competitive practice C fired
forty-five rounds and F forty-two, the
former using seven shells and the lat
ter nine. Th^ mean range wa% 2216.6;
total of targets 144; hits, C, 452; F.
133 dummies disabled: C, 86, and F,
55. C had twenty-six defective shrap
nel and F fifty-five. The competitive
practice equals for Battery C 69.8 per
cent of possible or first-class practice,
and for Battery F ."::.Â»',.

MEN WHO ROB
AND PLUNDER
Footpads, Burglars and
Pickpockets Celebrate
New Year's.
Two Men Knocked Down and
Robbed and One of Them
Wounded on the Head.
Several Burglaries Reported and
Attorney's Pocket Picked at
the Chutes.
Criminals were not behind other
people In celebrating New Tear's In
their own peculiar way, as the reports
received at police headquarters Satur
day and yesterday indicated.
About 3 o'clock yesterday morning
Robert Clifford, a sailor, was on his
way to the Sailors" Home, and at the
corner of Main and Market streets a
footpad knocked him down and robbed
him of an open-face silver watch and
$2 SO which he had in his pockets. He
notified Policeman H. O'Day of the
robbery, and an hour later O'Day and
Policeman Staples arrested Owen Arm
strong, a sailor, and he was identified
by Clifford as the man who robbed him.
Armstrong was taken to the City Pris
on and booked on the charge of rob
bery.
Alfred Dougherty, 413 First street,
was found about 1 o'clock yesterday
morning on First and Folsom streets
bleeding from a deep wound in his
scalp. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, and the wound was dressed.
As he was not in a condition to take
care of himself he was locked up in the
City Prison. Yesterday morning he re
ported to the police that two men had
struck him on the head with some
blunt instrument and had robbed him
of 25 cents, all the money that he had.
H' 1 was unable to give a description of
the men.
Burglars were also busy Friday and
Saturday nfghts. The residence of Mor
ris Marcuse, 2409 Washington street,
was entered by forcing open a rear
window with a "jimmy." The burg
lars succeeded in getting away with a
quantity of jewelry, but they had been
apparently disturbed, as several arti
cles, which had been gathered together,
were left behind. T. C. Martin's resi
dence, 1220 Alabama street, was also
entered and several valuable articles
of Jewelry stolen. Among the articles
were a diamond ring, a gold bracelet, a
pair of earrings and a goM watch and
chain. The residence of W. 1,. Ashe,
LM6 L.<\T.vt'n\vorth street, was entered
during the alienee of the family Sat
urday afternoon, but tho burglars had
been scared away. as. although th-y
had left evidence of the fact that they
had been there, nothing was apparent
ly missing.
Attorney Julius F. Fassett was at
thp Chutes Saturday night, and a
clever pickpocket deftly extracted his
pocket-book from his pocket, which
contained some valuable papers and
about $4 in coin. He reported the mat
ter at police headquarters yesterday
morning, and said he did not care so
much for the loss of the money as the
papers.
Died From Liquor.
Henry F. Pierson. who was arrested
on Sacramento street on last Sunday
while intoxicated, died at the Receiving
Hospital yestt-rday from the effects o!
the liquor. ThÂ»- ("oronors office was no
tified and the body was removed to the
Morgut-. wli'-rc an inquest will be held.

MYSTERY
SURROUNDS
HIS DEATH
J. H. Dow Found Dead
With Wounds in
His Head.
Circumstances Surround
ing His Death Cause
Two Opinions.
The Coroner Thinks That the
Wounds Were Not Self
inflicted.
POLICE THINK IT SUICIDE.
A Woman Who Worksd for Him
Held Until an Investigation
Is Made.
John H. Dow was found dead In his
shooting gallery at 815 Kearny street
last evening, with three bullet-holes in
his head, and the circumstances sur
rounding: the case are such that the
ories of both murder and suicide seem
feasible, with the chances in favor of
the former.
A saloon-keeper named Fred Levers,
who owns an establishment next door
to Dow's place of business, was the
first one to suspect anything was
wrong with his friend. He says that
he had not seen the place open since
New Year's eve, and last evening
made the remark to Morris J. Cohen,
a special officer, that as he had not
seen Dow's gallery open for two days
he feared that he was sick. The two
men went to the front door and knock
ed, but received no response. Cohen
then got a ladder and climbed through
the transom and discovered Dow lying
on a cot in the center of the gallery.
He opened the door and told Officer M.
C. Mahonty, who notified the Coroner's
office.
At first the case seemed to be clearly
one of suicide, but after making an
examination Deputy Coroner John E.
O'Brien had the Chief of Police send
out detectives to investigate the case,
as he thought that it looked very much
like murder. There were three wounds
in the head, one of them being in the
right temple and the other two behind
and a little above the right ear. They
were made with a 22-caliber ball, and
Coroner Hawkins found by probing
that all of them had penetrated the
skull. Beside the cot on which the
body lay a single-shot 22-caliber Smith
& Wesson target pistol was found,
cocked, with an exploded shell in the
barrel. Dow was lying on his left
side, with the covers pulled very close
ly about him. His left aTm was par
tially from under the bedclothes, his
right resting on his leg, and his entire
position was a natural one for a sleep
ing man.
Detectives Crockett and Gibson were
sent to investigate the case, and, while
the latter would not express his
opinion, Crockett pronounced it an un
questionable case of suicide. The Cor
oner differs with the hawkshaws and
thinks there is not the slightest pos
sibility of Dow having killed himself.
He gives as his reasons that either one
of the wounds would have probably
produced unconsciousness, and that
after receiving one of them the man
would not be able to reload his pistol
twice, infliot the other wounds and
then recock the weapon.
The position and nature of the
wounds are similar to those received
by Isaac Hoffman and Detective
Crockett -is taking the same stand in
pronouncing Dow's death to be suicide
as he did in regard to the Hoffman
case. He expresses it as his opinion
that the man could have fired the shots
with either hand, and scouts the idea
that the wounds from the first shot
would have so seriously injured Dow
J. H. Dow, Found Dead in His
Shooting; Gallery.
that he was unable to fire the others.
Dr. Hawkins, in making an examina
tion of the body last evening, could
find no signs of powder smudge or
burn, nor was the hair singed. Real
izing the similarity of Dow's wounds
to those of Hoffman, the Coroner made
some experiments on a cadaver to find
the effect of shots from the pistol with
which Dow was killed. He found that
when held at the distance of 7 inches
from the temple, which is as far away
from his head as the man could have
held the gun, the powder smudge and
stain would be very black and about
an inch and a half in diameter.
When held at one inch from the head
the smudge was larger, and when the
pistol was held directly against the
flesh there would b^ a light smudge
half an inch in diameter. From this
the inference can easily be drawn that
the pistol was hold farther away from
Dow than he could hold it himself.
Whether murder or suicide Dow
probably came to his death sometime
Saturday night. Levers, the saloon
man, said that the gallery had not
been open Saturday, but two men told
the Coroner that they saw Dow Satur
day and that the gallery was open that
night. Robert Little, who works at the
Eureka saloon on Kearny street, is
positive that he saw Dow in the gallery
at 12 o'clock Saturday. John Childera,
a clerk in the clothing store at 735
Kearny street, saw Dow and bought a
package of cigarettes at the stand the
dead man ran in connection with his
gallery, between 8 and 9 o'clock New
Year's night.
No motive for a murder has been
found, as the man is said to have had
no enemies. He had considerable to
do with women, and at different
tinaes had several who used to visit
him. One of these friends was a girl
who went by the name of Babe Wil
son. A picture of . her was found
among Dow's effects, but it was
learned that she had not been going
with him for several months and that
shi^ is in Stockton at the present time.
The woman whom he has been asso
ciating with lately is named "Susie. '"
but. no one who knew her could tell
her last name. This woman is de
scribed as being rather short and
heavy set, with a dark complexion
and about 30 years old. Friday after
noon she took charge of the gallery
for Dow, as he was not feeling well,
having a couple of boils on his neck.
At 6 o'clock she went out to dinner,
and on her return found Dow asleep.
Levers happened into the gallery about
this time and heard a little argument
between the two in regard to a rifle
which was missing. Dow contended
that it had been stolen while the girl
was on watch, and she insisted that it
was taken when he was asleep. There
was no ill feeling shown between the
two over this dispute, and Levers
thinks they were on the best of terms.
Yesterday afternoon, about half-past
2, Levers' attention was called by his
barkeeper to the fact that â¢"Susie" had
just looked into the saloon door. Think
ing she might know why Dow had not
had the gallery open Levers went to
the door to ask the girl about him, but
when he got on the street "Susie" was
not in sight. Jack Hooker, who runs
a shooting gallery at 11 Eddy street,
knew the girl and Dow both. He
thought that she was a compositor on
a paper.
No money was found in the posses
sion of the dead man. with the excep
tion of some silver coins of early date.
A silver watch and gold chain were
lying on a table at the man's head, and
another cheap watch was in a drawer
in the desk. Dow was thoupht by all
his friends to be a jolly, happy-go
lucky fellow, and can't believe that he
was the sort of a man to kill himself.
While his business has not been good
of late, he was considered to be pretty
well fixed financially. His parents and
a brother live in Nebraska and are
said to be very respectable people, and
Dow was on the best of terms with
them, as is evidenced by the fact that
he some time ago sent them back
money to help raise a mortgage which
they had on their home.
The woman known as "Susie" was
arrested by Officer Coleman early this
morning and gave her name as Mrs. E.
B. Dazel. She said that she had been
working in Dow's gallery, but denied
Many a Good and Honest Resolution They
Made, but â
that she had been living with him.
Mrs. Dazel substantiated the story of
Levers in regard to the rifle which was
stolen, and said that Dow had been
cranky about it.
Friday night she asked him for a
day off to see some friends and he
granted her request. She left the
place that night and did not return un
til yesterday morning, when she found
the place closed.
The woman was placed on the deti
nue book and will be held until the
case is thoroughly investigated.

BOOTH AT CHURCH
Service in the First Congrega-
tional Church Conducted
by the Army.
Commander Booth, with Colonel
Evans, Major Winchell and a few other
commissioned officers of the Salvation
Army conducted the service in the
First Congregational Church ltist
night.
Commander Booth on being -1 o
duced by Rev. Dr. Adams, gave bj the
way of a prelude to his sermon the
workings of the Salvation Army in
the United States for the past year.
He claimed to have, through his re
cruiting agencies, over 1,000,000 of con
verts from among the poorer class of
the people.
The expenditure during the â  year
amounted to $150,000, and with the
exception of about $2500, which came
in gifts from rich people, the amount
had been collected in dimes and
nickels from the middle and poorer
classes.
A home shelter is now ready for
400 men in Los Angeles, and on his
visit to this city in the near future a
home for girls who work in stores will
be provided, as also one for the unfor
tunates who are cast out of society.
As an example of the work done by
the army in feeding the poor, he had
partial figures before leaving New
York which showed that 80,000 persons
had partaken of the Christmas dinner
prepared for them by the army, and
from sections not yet heard from he
was sure that as many as 100,000
would be reported.

One Day Is as Good as Another to

Satisfied.
The New Tear's resolution has come
and gone â principally gone â as such
things are prone to do, and now those
who proudly announced to their friends
a few days ago that they had sworn
off are busily engaged in explaining
how it was that they were unable to
hold up to their good intentions.
Of course, the man who was pledged
to himself or some one else to refrain
from intoxicants for a year has a
good excuse for cutting the period
, down to a day. His doctor had told
him that a little stimulant was what
, was needed, and he was not going to
, let any such thing as a measley little
i resolution stand in the way of his
health.
And so with the devotee of tobacco.
How could a man be expected to keep
business and his business welfare de- |
mands when his nerves are Jumping
and head in a whirl? Of course, he Is
going to "taper off" and eventually
quit entirely, but this business of shut
ting off the friend of half his lifetime
in such an unceremonious way is easier
to talk about than to accomplish. So
he kicked himself quietly and went to
a strange tobacconist and got a new
supply of his precious weed.
Hundreds of matinee girls vowed on
Friday with grim determination writ
ten on their brows that they would
eschew the afternoon theater for at
least a month, but alas for the resolu
tion. They read The Call on Saturday
morning, saw the attractions seduc
tively sot forth and fell. How could
any girl with a particle of romance or
artistic taste in her composition resist
the last chance she might have in
months of seeing that lovely Herbert
de St. Germain Montmorency play
Romeo? So she persuaded mamma to
yield up the necessary dollar, donned
her Christmas gown ana thronged the
theaters.
"I'll not play the ponies for the rest

settled It. Of course, it was a sure
thing, and he argued himself out of
his resolution by convincing himself
that it would be utterly foolish to
throw away a chance of making some
sure money just because he had felt
bad about losing his money before.
This would be the last timeâ why, cer
tainlyâbut he did want to get at
the pencilers once.
To say there is no hope for those
who break resolutions in this way be
SOCIETY WILL TURN OUT TO-NIGHT.
At the California Theater, Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday, January 3, 4
and 5, the young people of the city, un
der the patronage of twenty prominent
women, will present ten dramatic
scenes from American history for the
benefit of the Hospital for Children
and Training School for Nurses. Over
200 will take part. The scenes repre
sented are the climax of dramatic in
terest of each epoch and give in drama
the real life of the time. The scenes
have been rehearsed at the homes of
Mrs. John F. Merrill, Mrs. William
Whittier and Mrs. W. P. Shaw and at
the California Theater. The chief
characters will be personated by some
of the most prominent men of the city.
"Columbia" will fix in the minds of
the children and young people who
take part and witness the production
important epochs, around which the
other dates can be placed.
Although the sale of seats is very
large, yet there is room for several
hundred more at the Monday per
formance. If the house is crowded the
first nightâ that is, to-nightâ it will
undoubtedly be packed Tuesday and
fore they are cold would be unchari
table. One day, as a matter of fact,
is as good as another, and there is
April 1 on the way. If that is not sat
isfactory, for fear of being called a fool,
July 4 is not so very far off, and
Thanksgiving comes along in plenty of
time to be safe before next Christmas.
HE BROKE THE PLEDGE.
Willian) Walsh, Aged 13 Years.
Found Drunk, on Castro
Street.
William Walsh, aged 13 years, living
at 514 Jersey street, was taken to the
Receiving: Hospital last evening in an
intoxicated condition. After being re
lieved of the liquor the boy said he was
walking along Castro street shortly
after 4 o'clock, when he met two older
boys, one of whom had a bottle of
whisky. He claimed that the bottle
contained cider, and induced young
Walsh to take a drink. The innocent
boy took a large mouthful, and almost
immediately toppled over. He was
found by a policeman and at once re
moved to the Receiving Hospital.
When asked how he felt after the
effects of the whisky had partially
worn away, he tearfully remarked: "I
feel all right, but it hurts me to think
that I have broken the pledge."
The boy then explained that he had
taken a pledge to abstain from intoxi
cating liquor only a few days ago.
"Wait until I catch the fellow that
gave me the liquor," he said, "and I
will break his jaw."
Late last night young Walsh was
taken home by his father.
LAND COLONIES.
Ideas on the SalvatioQ Remedy
for Poverty.
There is at the present time a great
deal of interest in the colonization
schemes of the Salvation Army, by
which it is proposed to relieve the con
gested population of cities of their ex
cess.
At a recent meeting Attorney George
H. Maxwell gave his ideas in full, and
others connected with the movement
elaborated on the scheme now under
way by the Salvation Army. He and
other speakers are in favor of the
plans recently advocated by Professor
Moses of the State University, and
others who have advocated the Gknr
ernment regulation of affairs connected
with the care of the defective and de
linquent classes of society.
The only trouble that the local so
ciety has experienced has been owing
to tho rumors of the failure of similar
schemes in India and elsewhere. It has
been circulated lately that the schemes
engineered by the original General
Booth were great failures in India,
that he failed in England and that his
London financial backers deserted him
at the moment they discovered how
loosely he conducted his business
schemes.
George H. Maxwell is not a member
of the Salvation Army, but is a well
known lawyer. His ideas are like those
advocated by Congressman Osgood of
Missouri â ome -yonrs ago. except that
the Congressman was in favor of the
Government dr,in>? what Maxwell asked
the colony itself to effect.
Wednesday. There is enough patriot
ism in "Columbia" to stir the hearts of
every loyal citizen of this city.
The departure of the volunteers for
the Civil War in 1861 is cleverly imi
tated. Tho curtain goes up on a party
of boys and girls waving handker
chiefs to a company in uniform. The
famous One Hundred of the Califor
nia Volunteers, under command of
Captain George Filmer, marches into
view and goes through a few maneuv
ers. The War Governor enters upon
the scene with his staff and presents
the company with a flagâ a gift from
wives and sweethearts.
The War Governor, General J. H.
Dickinson, makew a thrilling address
inciting them to duty, and the wait
ing, weeping girls give a salute of
waving handkerchiefs. The com
mander responds briefly to the Gov
ernor^ speech and the boys in blue
march away to the tune of "The Girl
I Left Behind Me." The members of
the famous One Hundred who take
part in the real departure are im
personated by the City Guard of this
city.
CLAIMED HE
STOLE HER
DIAMONDS
Mrs. Ronaldo Has a
Man Apprehended â 
for Robbery.
She Accused Him of Hav
ing Purloined Her
Jewelry.
He Makes an Exciting Leap
From a Hack to Escape
Her Wrath.
CAUGHT BY AN OFFICER.
After Being Taken to Police Head
quarters He Was
Released.
"Don't let him get away; the scoun
drel has robbed me of my diamonds."
Thus shouted an attractive young
woman, who was seated in a hack
which was being driven along O'Farrell
street late Saturday night. Placing
her head out of the hack window she
called upon several men, who were
standing near the Orpheum Annex, to
stop a young man who was making
rapid strides toward Mason street. Just
then Police Officer Brophy happened
along and, seeing the supposed thief
dashing along the street, he promptly
stopped him. The young man. ex
plained that he had not robbed the wo
man, but that she was jealous of him,
and in order to get even with him, she
accused him of having stolen her dia
monds.
Taking him back to the hack in
which was seated his pretty accuser
the policeman started to question her.
She was accompanied by another wo
man who claimed to be a stranger in
the city.
The woman gave her name as Mrs.
Ronaldo. She was stylishly dressed
and wore a profusion of diamonds.
In answer to the officer's question
Mrs. Ronaldo said that several months
ago she met her alleged despoiler,
whom she called "Jack," and fell des
perately in love with him. He pre
tended to reciprocate her affections,
and after a brief courtship he prom
ised to make her his wife. Shortly
afterward the woman invited him to
her house, and when he left she says
she missed several diamond rings and
a pair of diamond earrings. Convinced
that he had taken them, she started a
search for him. with the result that
she learned that he had gone to "Wat
sonville.
Shortly after 11 o'clock Saturday
night Mrs. Ronaldo was walking along
Market street with a friend, when she
espied "Jack" standing in a cigar
store. He at first refused to recognize
her and started to walk away. She
caught him by the arm and whispered
that she did not care for the dia
monds and consequently would not
prosecute him. Her scheme was to get
him into a hack and order the driver
to take them to police headquarters,
where she intended to enter a formal
complaint against him.
As they drove along O'Farrell street
the surprised man evidently became
suspicious and jumped out of the hack
It was then that the woman lustily
shouted for somebody to stop him.
After listening to her story. Brophy
jumped into the hack and ordered the
driver to drive to the central station.
"Jack" indignantly denied that he
had stolen the woman's diamonds. He
declared that she was jealous of him
because he had left her. and to be re
venged she conceived the scheme to
have him arrested on some trumped up
charge.
Lieutenant Birdsall, -who was in
charge, refused to lock him up. and
told the woman that if she wanted him
arrested it would be necessary for her
to swear to a complaint against him.
They then left the station, the woman
returning to the hack and "Jack" going
in an opposite direction.
PIONEERS HAVE
ADOPTED PLANS
To Present Elaborate and His
toric Features in the
Jubilee Parade.
Native Sons Discuss a Unique Show
ing on an Economical
Basis.
The Society of California Pioneers is
making elaborate preparations for the
part it will take in the big jubilee pa
rade. Two bands of music anÂ£ two
marshals â one for each division -will
be among the features following Mar
shal Pinkham. Then will come Indians
and vaqueros, followed by an ox team
drawing a Mexican cart, with wheels
hewn out of solid blocks; then an emi
grant train, all arranged as it was in
the days of '49. William M. Rose, a
pioneer of '38 and one of the oldest
members of the order, will follow in a
carriage with Mayor Phelan, the de
sign being intended to represent the
past and the present.
Following this will come Marshall's
four companions in carriages, suita
bly designated. The float of Sutter's
Fort will precede a carriage containing
President of the Day Jewett, Orator of
itv )Â»;Â»y N'ilos Searls, Chaplain Rev.
.Mr. Wiley, and Mrs. Eliza D. Keith,
poetess. After this will follow the va
rious officers of the societies, the ex
p residents and the members.
Marshal Russ will have charge of
the- second division, which will be
headed by a banner bearing the in
scription, "We Followed." The junior
members will parade on ' foot and
promise to present a number of ele
gant surprises.
The hour for the moving of the pa
rade has been definitely fixed at 10:30
o'clock. This will afford an opportu
nity for all organizations to get in
line and will permit all visiting organi
zations to reach the city in time to
have their line in the parade. From
the indications at present it is expect
ed that at least two hours will be con
sumed for the parade to pass a given
point, and the line of march will con

It is the opinion of the Jubilee
parade committee that, if instead of
holding a number of military games
on some park in this city and a num
ber of drills and military evolutions at
the Presidio, the two exhibitions were
combined, a far more pleasing effect
of brilliancy and splendor would be
produced. With this end in view
Colonel Smith, chief of staff to Grand
Marshal Morse, is holding consulta
tions with Lieutenant Miley and other
of the army officers, all of whom are
eag>er to lend their assistance in mak
ing the project a success.
The Native Sons' joint golden
Jubilee celebration committee met in
Native Sons' Hall yesterday afternoon
and heard the report of its parade
committee. The meeting was pre
sided over by C. Martin, and R. W.
Martland acted as secretary. About
thirty persons were present and rep
sented the twenty-one local parlors of
the order.
The parade committee reported that
it had held two meetings and had
made many outside inquiries. , Its
plan is to have, as features of the
parade, things illustrating the differ
ent periods of California's history.
The Indian period would be repre
sented by real Indians properly and
significantly attired; the Mexican
period, by mounted caballeros in their
picturesque costumes, and the "mis
sion period by some appropriate char
acters. Then there would be shown
an old mission, the bear flag, miners,
an American flag, the soldiers first
raising the American flag at Mon
terey and finally four boys carrying
the letters N. S. G. W., done in gblden
poppies. There would also be a float
representing California's admission
into the Union. After lengthy parlia
mentary debate the general committee
limited the parade committee to an
amount not to exceed $25 from each
of the twenty-one parlors â and upon
this as a basis the committee will
make its plans for a display.
"THE NATIVITY."
The Drama Proved Such a Sue-
cess That Its Promoters Will
Give Another Performance.
The Christmas Festival and Grand
Scenic Production of "The Nativity"
which took place last Tuesday and
Thursday evenings at St. Paul's hall,
corner of Twenty-ninth and Church
streets, for the benefit of St. Paul's
Sunday School, was such a success that
those in charge of the production in
tend to repeat it on Tuesday evening,
January 4.
Upon both nights the hall was so
crowded that over 500 people were un
able to gain admission. The pastor,
Rev. Father Connelly, was very sorry
that all could not be accommodated
and for this reason the drama will be
repeated.
The drama was a beautiful presenta
tion of the birth of Christ, and the tab
leaux were so realistic that the curtain
had to be raised again and again.
