Santiago.
The lowa, Massachusetts and New
Orleans Pour a Telling Fire
Upon Cervera's Flagship
and the F orts -
GREAT EVENTS ARE
HOURLY EXPECTED
CAPE HAYTIEN, June I.â A special from Santiago, con
firming yesterday's bombardment, says great events are
expected hourly there. American warships are In front of
the harbor. The Insurgents are gathering on the hills. The
Spanish have taken extraordinary precautions to guard the
harbor entrace.
ON BOARD THE DISPATCH BOAT
SIMPSON. OFF SANTIAGO DE
CUBA, May 81 (via Kingston, Jamaica,
June I).â The first battle in which
American ships have met first-class
Spanish warships, backed by modern
batteries, manned by expert French
and Gorman grunners, has been fought,
and the honors axe all with the Ameri
cans.
Three of the best ships of our navy,
the lowa, Massachusetts and New Or
leans, were selected for the fight. For
thirty-five minutes this afternoon they
engaged the Cristobol Colon, the flag
ship of Admiral Cervera's flne squad
ron, and the strong batteries at the
narrow entrance of the harbor of San
tiago de Cuba-
Three of the four batteries were
silenced with about fifty shots, and the
Spanish flagship certainly suffered
great damage.
None of the American vessels was hit.
To use the characteristic words of
"Fighting Bob" Evans, commander of
the lowa, shouted by him from the
bridge of that vessel to a correspondent
Just at the close of the battle, "The
Spaniards didn't hit a d â n thing but
water, and that wasn't a great diffi
culty."
At noon Commodore Schley left the
Brooklyn, which was taking on coal
from the collier Merrlmac at the time,
and went aboard the Massachusetts.
The dispatch-boat had Just returned
from Kingston, JamaJca, with mes
sages for the fleet, and after speaking
the ships had steamed within 400 yards
of the entrance to the harbor in order
to get a close look at the Spanish fleet,
and secure correct sketches of the for
tifications at the entrance. While Im
pudently drifting within gun range the
dispatch-boat Simpson saw the com
modore's flag raised to the military
mast of the Massachusetts and heard
a bell call signaling full speed on the
big battle-ship. The Massachusetts
headed straight for the dispatch-boat.
The New Orleans, lowa and the little
Vixen, a converted yacht, followed in
me order named, a cable length apart.
As the demonstrations, which con
sisted of a parade within a few miles
of the batteries, had been made on
Sunday and Monday by the blockading
fleet, those on the other ships thought
nothing of the movements of these four
vessel*. The Brookly n and Texas lay
two miles to seaward unconcernedly
coaling. The Harvard, Marblehead,
Castine and Eagle were even further
away.
At the mouth of the Tortugas har
bor the Cristobal Colon could be plain
ly distinguished, lying with her port
broadside toward the American ships
and flying an immense ensign.
So close had the Simpson moved In
that those on board could see through
glasses that the Spaniard had her awn
ings up fore and aft, and that her crew
were moving lazily about her decks.
i On the east side of the harbor .t the
i Colon's stern were the grip walls of
Morro, with another large Spanish flag
above it. Behind the flar-"lp, high
above the water, was the foi lidable
ialand battery, directly In the center of
The San Francisco Call
the channel. Clos* to this could be dis
tinguished two other armored cruisers,
the Vizcaya and Almirante Oquendo,
and close to them two smaller vessels,
apparently the torpedo-boat destroyers
Pluton and Furor.
Six miles inland the haze of smoke,
pierced here and there by white spired,
marked the city of Santiago The
whole scene was bathed in brilliant
sunshine. ,t had for a background a
range of high palm-covered mountains
crowned with a tang' *â¢ mass of snow
white clouds. . . :/.-â¢;
Schley had known positively on Sun
day that Cervera's squadron was in
side. Gallantly had the little Marble
head, commanded by McCalla, poked
her nose into the very mduths of the
great guns of the Spanish batteries
and made out clearly four big cruisers,
two torpedo-boat destroyers and the old
Reina Mercedes.
Commodore Schley had carefully pre
pared maps of the land fortifications,
but knew that several additional
masked batteries had but recently been
constructed close to the entrance to
the harbor. It was to draw the fire of
these batteries before the arrival of
Sampson's fleet that the attack was
planned. When the Massachusetts,
plunging through the water at sixteen
knots, was within 200 yards of the Simp
son and 4000 yards from the entrance a
cloud of white smoke arose above the
bow of the flagship, and the eight-inch
gun on her port side belched forth a
challenge that opened the fight.
Before the course of the shell could
be followed, and before the surprised
Spaniards could reply, one of the for
ward thirteen-inch guns of the Massa
chusetts thundered. A heavy cloud of
smoke enveloped the huge ship, the
waters vibrated, and the windows on
the Simpson were smashed, and the
little craft trembled from stem to stem,
while a low, undulating, crashing vol
ume of sound rolled over the waves.
A pause of ten seconds, which seemed
an hour, close to the bow of the Cris
tobal Colon arose. a fountain of water
fully 100 feet high! By this time the
Spaniards were at work. Like; a flash
the awnings had disappeared from the
Colon's deck, and the men were called
to quarters. ' ,â¢ : .
Three batteries â one on the west side
of the harbor, one on the east side and
one on an island in the center <st the
channel â opened fire, and the guns of
the Colon chimed in a mighty chorus.
The New Orleans was now within
ra.nge, and her six-inch guns, charged
with smokeless powder, began barking
in most defiant tones. The lowa came
next. Captain Evans waited until he
was directly in the face of the Colon's
broadside and then let go his twelve
inch guns, fore and aft, with telling
effect.
All three ships were hammering away
with their hi"- .is. The fourth bat
tery, Just beneath Morro and close to
tho each, was unmasked by the hot
fire of th" New Orleans. All four bat
teries and the Colon were replying
rapidly. At first the range was hard to
get on both sides, because of the de
ceptive glare ti the water, and it was
not until the chips had passed before

SPAIN'S SUPPLY
OF GOLD IS GONE
Financial Panic of the Dons May Cause
a Sudden Termination of
th>e War.
MADRID, June I.â The attention of
the public to-day la absorbed in the
condition of the Bank of Spain, which
is considered more serious than any
reverse of the war. Inasmuch as the
impossibility of the bank to help the
Government means the impossibility to
continue the war: : .
There Was a long procession at the
bank during the day. All classes of
people were represented and many
women were in line waiting their turn
to change notes into silver, fearlnc the
notes would soon be subjected to a dig*
count.
If the run continues there is danger
of the bank's stock of silver becoming
exhausted, which would compel the
Government to resort to a forced cur
rency, issuing notes of small denomina
tion. It is expected, however, that the
panic will subside, leaving the bank a
margin of silver.
The financial outlook of Spain is
rather dark. The Government has en
trusted the Bank of Spain with the ne
gotiations for a loan of 1,000,000,000
pesetas at 4 per cent, which sum is to
be raised as soon as required. The
bank will endeavor to raise the loan at
home and abroad.
The Government has decided to pay
the forts and turned that there were
any effective shots fired; . .
After the lowa had passed the little
Vixen, in dare-devil spirit, dashed
across behind the battleship without
being hit and without firing herself. As
she passed the dispatch boat, which
Was the only newspaper tug anywhere
near ; the engagement and the only eye
witness of It, her crew cheered en
thusiastically. . . 7 â '..â 'â¢. .
Ten minutes after firing the first shot
the Massachusetts turned majestically
arid steamed back from east to west,
this time presenting her starboard side
to the enemy. She veered in closer to
the batteries. The captain of the dis
patch boat, one of the gamest men in
these waters, took the wheel himself
with the avowal: "I'll go as close as
they will. Those Spaniards can't hit
aÃi" And nearer still the little Simpson
went, flying the Stars and Stripes.
Screaming, hurling shells fell within
200 yards of her, but the crew forward
cheered the men on the warships as
they swept across the Simpson's bow.
The Spanish batteries improved in
their marksmanship during the second
passage of the American ships. Seve
ral shots fell very close to the lowa and
New Orleans, and one dangerously near
the bow of the Massachusetts. They
were fired by the large battery on the
westward side of the harbor, which was
evidently manned with ten and twelve
inch Krupp guns. The range was so
great that the guns were fired at a
high elevation, and the shells, falling
near the ships, raised high fountains
of water.

LONDON, June I.â A special dis
patch from Madrid says a decree has
been published there authorizing the
issue of an internal loan of 1.000,000,000
pesetas at 4 per cent.
WASHINGTON, June Iâ The state
ment from Madrid, In what seamed to
be an aJmost semiofficial form; of the
acuteness of the financial stringency
there and the plain intimation that the
Bank o>f Spain, and consequently Spain,
was nearing the end of their resources,
was regarded at the. State Department
as of more real significance than many
of the stories of battles on land and
sea that have been coming over the
cables for the past few weeks. The
effect of this notice may be to hasten
the operations against Porto Rica, lest
the prize slip from our grasp through
a sudden and unexpected termination
of the war.

CAUSES A STORM
His Criticism of the Queen Regent
Arouses Some Heated Talk
in the Senate.
MADRID, June I.â An article signed
One shot from the lowa fell directly
under the Colon, and for a few mo
ments that ship appeared to be on fire.
If it was the blaze was quickly ex
tinguished and the Spanish flagship
continued to answer all of the shots
discharged at her. All of her shots,
however, fell in one spot directly in the
channel. She did hot seem able to
change her range, and most of her fir
ing was, therefore, ridiculous. The
shore batteries did better. One big
shell exploded almost directly over the
lowa, but it was too high to do any
damage.
The ships passed but twice before the
batteries. The first shot was fired by
the Massachusetts at 1:50 o'clock, and
the last by the New Orleans at 2:25.
The Massachusetts used only her thir
teen and eight inch guns, the New Or
leans her six-inch and the lowa her
twelve and eight inch guns.
The New Orleans proved to be one of
the hottest and most effective fighters
in the navy, and Captain Fowler and
his crew, who arrived but yesterday,
are being generally congratulated on
the fine showing made. The New Or
leans alone used smokeless powder.
Every shot she fired could be plainly
noted and followed and Its effect
marked.
After thirty minutes' firing the bat
teries on the right of the harbor were
silenced and five minutes later the one
on the island in the center stopped.
The large one on the west side, how
ever, together with the Cristobal Colon,
kept up a weak fire for fully twenty
minutes after the ships had ceased fir â¢

Interior, announced that the matter

Marshal Martinez de Campos de

"idiotic," and called upon the Govern

SEATTLE, June I.â The schooner
Jane Gray, which sailed from Seattle
for Kotzebue Sound on the iÂ»th day of
May with sixty-one people on board,
foundered on Sunday, May 22, about
ninety miles west of Cape Flattery, at
2 o'clock in the morning, while lying

Ten minutes after the alarm was given
she lay at the bottom of the ocean with
thirty-four of her passengers. The re

It is possible â  that there may be . four
or five more survivors whose names
cannot be ascertained.
The Jane Gray's passengers were
prospectors, with the exception of Rev.
W. C. Gam bel, a missionary, who, with
his wife and chila, was on his way to
St. Lawrence Island, in the Bering Sea.
He refused to place his wife and child
on board the launch, saying: ;â¢ ;
"The vessel is d6omed, and we will
die together." :
Among the prospectors was a, party
of sixteen, headed by Major Ingraham,
who were outfitted by Prince Luigi of
Italy for a two years' prospecting trip
in Alaska. Of this party the only sur
vivors are Major Ingraham, L. M. Les
sey, C. H. Packard and G. H. Pennlng
ton.
The surviving passengers suffered a
great deal of privation and for thirty
hours their only food was a sack of
prunes and a sack of turnips from the
ship's stores. Sufficient water was
caught by spreading a tarpaulin during
a- rainstorm.
The news of the disaster and the ex
pected arrival of the survivors from
Victoria caused a large crowd to gather
at the dock in this city. Carriages
were waiting and when the City of
Kingston landed the survivors they
were immediately carried to their
homes or to the residences of friends.
The few that could v ~ seen had not
yet recovered from their shock, and con
sequently could not give a very detailed
account of the disaster which came on
them so suddenly. They were unable
to account for the vessel's springing a
leak and sinking so suddenly. They

were warm in their praise of the worfc
done by Captain Crockett at the time
of the foundering of the vessel. Cap
tain Crockett gives the following ac
count of the wreck:
"We were lying to to mend our fore
sail. A moderate gale was blowing
and the seas were running high. I
had gone to h^d and was sound asleep
when the watchman awakened me with
the announcement that something waÂ»
wrong. I arose at once and found thÂ»
vessel leaking. A hurried investiga
tion showed that she would soon sink
and I at once notified the passengers
of the situation. Most of them were
asleep underneath the deck. A scena
of confusion then took place, and it is
impossible to give any detailed account
of the events that followed. The dark
ness added to the confusion.
"The Jane Gray carried two life
boats and two launches. lat once or
dered the boats lowered. The first life
boat was swamped. The launch Ken
noma, belonging to the Ingraham
party, was successfully lowered.
"At this time the Jane Gray waa
almost under water. A heavy sea
struck her, throwing her on her beam.
There was no time to launch other
boats. The water was over her hatches
and every one below was certainly
drowned. Those on deck hurriedly got
into the launch. A sack of prunes and
one of turnips was hastily taken from
the ship's stores, and these were the
only food we had until we reached Van
couver Island.
"As the launch drifted away from the
almost submerged schooner we saw
eight or ten men standing on the lee
rail, clinging to the rigging. Soon thpy
disappeared from sight. Two of thorn.
Job Johnson and C. J. Reilly^ kept
afloat by clinging to bundles of boat
lumber. Two hours afterward they
were picked up by our launch, making
twenty-seven in all we had with us.
"It is barely possible that there will
be four more survivors. Just before
the Jane Gray disappeared under the
waves we thought we saw the second
launch that was on board with four
forms near it. They were so indis
tinct that we were not sure. They
seemed to be getting into the launch.
We saw nothing of them when daylight
came. We Improvised a sail and pad
dles, and after drifting thirty
hours in the launch finally landed in
side of Rugged Point, Ilynquot Sound,
on Vancouver Island, eighty miles from
the scene of the wreck.
"A fire was built on the beach and
we made a meal of roasted mussels.
We had had no food since the night be
fore the disaster, excepting the sack of
prunes and turnips that we threw into
the launch. We got oar drinking
water by spreading out a tarpaulin in
the driving rain. An Indian who
chanced to come along informed us
that the village of Kynquot was but six
miles away. We went there and found
the sealing schooner Favorite becalmed
and arrangements were made to carry
our party to Victoria. We reached
there this morning in time to catch the
steamer for Seattle,"
The best-known survivor of the Jana
Gray expedition is Major E. S. Ingra
ham, who as a result of a trip made a
year ago to Mount St. I2lias with Prince
Luigi of Italy received $10,000 from the
Italian nobleman to fit out an expedi
tion to the Kotzebue Sound country.
But for the launch which the Ingraham
party had aboard the Jane Gray not a
soul could possibly have been saved.
Major Ingraham said to-night:
"Strange and horrible as It may seem
many of those *â¢ perished did not
know the vessel was foundered. There
was no noise, no excitement. The un
conscious : ones simply dropped off into
eternity. It was all over in ten min
utes. Those who did not know of the
approaching disaster had been deathly
sick from the timo the vessel left Cape
Flattery. They died in their bunks and
to many of theâ destruction must have
seemed a relief.
"Twenty-seven of the passengers and
crew crowded into my little launch and
escaped. Two of the survivors â the last
to leave the Jane Gray â were found by
us floating on bits of'wreckage. They
saw the schooner take her final plunge
into the black waters and told us that
though they were at her side r. it aery
came from any of those who perished.
"Our launch was kept then headed to
the wind for twenty-four hours, and
then headed toward the east. Finally
hungry, thirsty, weary, half dead, the
bleak shore of Vancouver Island loom
ed up in the far beyond. It was land
â that was enougl. for us. After hours
of hard work we were picked up by the

and cried out, 'The ship is doomed; we
will all die together!' With that, this.;

man being of good mental faculties to
a maniac, rushed into his stateroom,

last. .-.. ;â¢' '.;'â ". ':'â â 'â  â â¢'. : â  â¢â¢â¢
"There is absolutely no hope for the
men left on the schooner when our
launch drifted away. There was an
other launch belonging to an Italian
party on the Jane Gray. Some of the
party entered the launch, but a great
wave came along, dashed the little boat
with its cargo of humanity up against
the mainmast, and as the schooner took
her last dive she was accompanied to
the bottom by the splintered launch.
Many of those who perished were
strong, husky young men, who would
have made a brave fight for life had it
not been for the fact that they were ill
in their bunks."
' Clayton H. Packard, one of the best
known mining and newspaper men in
Bnohomisb County, this State, was one
of the survivors. He joined Major In
graham's expedition as a mining ex
pert. To The Call correspondent he
gave the following story uf his experi
ences:
"Trouble b-^gan for the sixty-three
persons on the old whaler Jane Gray
on Friday morning. Even before we
. got out of the Straits, the forward
cabin was awash. Every time her bow
went Into th" Bwell gallons of water
swept over the deck and a great deal
of it found its way into the forward
through the hawse holes. The
schooner was kept on her course on
Friday and Saturday, for the storm
was not a heavy one. After eating
breakfast on Friday morning we did
not have another meal after getting
out of the Straits.
"Shortly before 2 o'clock on Sunday
morning I heard the mate, who was
standing watch, call out 'All hands on
deck.' lie had noticed that the vessel
was keeling over. On reaching the
deck I noticed a dozen men in the rig
ging. I saw that it was useless to try
to right the vessel. "Water was rush
ing into the aftercabin through a com
panionway in a perfect stream. I triod
to launch a dory that was lying on top
of the deck, but in lowering the fore
sail the sailors covered the dory with a
bang.
"Major Ingraham and others were
working with the fastenings of the
steam launch Kennormax. Our boat
finally floated off with several men in
it. When it came back to the schooner
we caught hold of it and the men be
gan to file in. As it floated away from '
the vessel on a wave Major Ingraham i
fell into the sea. He swam back to the
schooner and was hanging on to the
. the launch came back. It
caught the major and crushed him
quite badly.
-Mate John Har.sen behaved with
great bravery. He threw a number of
boxes of provisions into the launch !
from the deck of the schooner. With i
every rock of the boat the main boom
would sweep over us. Once it caught i
n <>n the head and nearly knocked
him overboard.
"Th.' schooner was settling fast and
we pulled the men into the boat us
fast as we could.: Finally we drifted
out, and with but two poles to work
with we could not go back for any
more men. There wt-re twenty-five in j
the boat at the time. . An hour and a I
half after the schooner sank we picked
up Job Johnstone-of Long Island, X. V.,
who had managed to keep afloat by
clinging to one of the overturned
boats. .
"I can give absolutely no hope that
any one else was saved from the

from the time of her launching. She
was built in, Bath, Me., In 1887, and
came around the Horn to San Fran

passage that she was almost given up
for lost. When pr ; did reach port
barnacles a yard long were found stick-
Ing to her bottom. : . : -". ; , .
Soon after she arrived here she was
fitted out for a whaling cruise. In the
Bering Sea she -wrs caught in a storm

crew escaped and later, the sloop-of
war Marion (now.; the naval training
ship) picked her up and towed her into
Sltka. There she was righted and fixed I
up and sailed back, to Sun Francisco. â

"whaling and then in the latter part of

Declare Britons Are Now
Beguiling Americans.
ALL FALL UPON ALBION
APPARENTLY FRIGHTENED BY
THE PROPOSED ALLIANCE,
On the Other Hand the Newspapers
of London Speak Plainly of
the Relations of France
and Spain.
'opyrlghted, 1533, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, June I.â The French papers
are as nervous as they can be over
American-English approachment. They
are virtually crying, "What's the
matter with us?" Of course none of |
them believes the report that an alli
ance is being considered. That is, they
say none of them do, but they devote
such an amount of space to proving
that there cannot be anything In it,
that it is plain to be seen they fear i
there is. They protest too much; they I
also quote with glee the Times' denial ;
of the report. They are all careful to
declare that they not only published |
the Daily Telegraph's dispatch "with
all reserve," but they published the de- j
nial of the Times without any reserve. I
The funniest side of the affair is that '
England gets all the blows. It is a case
of "Oh, you dear friends, Americans,"
have been beguiled by the wicked Eng
lish, and with one accord the press and
public fall upon Albion.
No one dares utter a word against
Americans now, but they make up for
it on England. They also try to show
that England has nothing to gain from
an alliance with America.
"Who can make us believe," says the
Gaulois, "that President McKinley has
tried to dazzle Lord Salisbury with the !
perspective 'of an alliance in which ;
England would take all the risks in
exchange for problematical support in
the East and Far East, where British
interests are not threatened."
This change of base is delightful.
Only a few weeks ago those same pa
pers were telling England that her time
had come, the first indication of it be- J
ing checks she had already received in
the Chinese question.
LONDON, June I.â The London Daily
Chronicle thinks the general war situa
tion is grave and say.-! the rumors of a â 
secret arrangement between France
and Spain continue with singular per
sistence and the reports of French de
signs upon the Canary Islands and
Ceuta are gaining strength. Continu
ing, the Chronicle says:
"In commercial circles it is perfectly
well understood that Great Britain will
regard France taking the Canaries or |
Ceuta as an unfriendly act, and also j
that if France help* Spain public opin
ion here Will demand that we assist j
America,"
The Pall Mall Gazette devotes much
space to the Anglo-American relations, j
and while disavowing its belief that j
any treaty of alliance exists, says:
"There will be something betterâ the :
recognition of our unities and the rap
idly consolidating sense of common in- â 
terests and brother lines. Henceforth
Great Britain arid America will ap
proach trnese things in the right spirit, i
Angl'7-American solidarity^ will become I
something more and more to be reck- ,
oned with."

.Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, June 1.--The United
States auxiliary: gunboat.. tfncaS ar
rived here this morning; from the . Cu
ban coast/ She reports that on Mon
day last, when a mile and a half west
of Matanzas lighthouse,- she sighted a
Spanish blockhouse, on shore. :; Taking
up a position about .600 >Â»ards oft shore,
the Uhcaa fired two shots at the house,
and the two shells went clear through
the building, which: was: wrecked. ';-.'
During the firing the auxiliary gun
boat Leyden came up and also fired a
couple: of shots. . It is not known
whether. any Spaniards were killed, but
they probably fled at the first shot. The.
blockhouse made no reply. The action
on the part of the Uncas and Leyden is
in accordance with the policy of the
patrol boats shelling any blockhouses
they may come across. The crews en-
Joy this target practice very much.
All was quiet on the Havana block
ade when the Uncas left last night.
The coast between Cardenas and Ma
tanzas, for twenty miles east of -where
the Florida expedition landed, has been
shelled and cleared of Spaniards by the
auxiliary gunboats Uncas and Leyden.
The Spaniards erected numerous sand
batteries and earthworks in that sec
tion, and Spanish cavalry and infantry
have often been seen moving up and
down the two paint?. Perhaps this
part of the coast has been selected for
the landing of another expedition, or it
may be a good point ..where troops
could be landed preparatory to a move
upon Havana. The Uneas and Leyden
have made it safe for a landing party
to approach the shore. They blew all
the sand batteries to dust, throwing
earthworks into heaps of debris and
scattering the Spaniards. Several
blockhouses were also demolished. In
surgents are numerous in the vicinity
cf Matanzas and. may soon capture the
place. . â  â¢.""'â ' '.-.'.' .-. - V

take Sorenson's Party.
APIA, Samoa, May 14.â The schooner
Sophie Sutherland, which left San
Francisco in 1897 with a party of pros
pectors on board to search for gold in
the South Seas, reached here on May
11 with the crew in a horrible condi
tion.
The Sutherland, under the guidance
of a man named Sorenson, took a party
of fifteen men, four of whom were sail
ors, who prospected among the Solo
mon Islands for gold. After cruising
around for several months without suc
cess, all of the part attacked by
fever, and the captain decided to leave
for San Francisco. On March 19 last
the vessel left Florida Island with all
but three men on board unable to
move. Three days later there was
but one man able to assist in navigat
ing the craft v .
The captain then headed for Apia,
the nearest point, to obtain medical
treatment, but to add to the trouble
scurvy broke out, and when within
sight of Samoa there were only two
. men* the captain and another, able to
work; The ship for three weeks was
within seventy miles of Apia, but did
not reach, port until May 11 on account
of. head wifids. During those three

Washington, June 1.
Up to a late hour to-niyht the Navy
Department had not received any of
ficial advices confirming the press re-
W ports describing the bombardment ot
the fortifications at Santiago. :
Credence is given by the department,
however, to the most important feat
ures of the newspaper dispatches. It Us
believed that Schley has pounded the
batteries of Morro, Socapa and Punta
Gorda, largely with a view of develop
ing their strength and the range of
their guns. It is also thought likely In
official circles that it' the Cristobal Co
ion steamed into the mouth of the har
bor, as stated In the reports from Span
ish sources, Schley's gunners may have
made an effort to sink her. and thus
:he attack may have developed greater
importance than the American â¢com
aiander anticipated at the outset.
Secretary L<mg took occasion to- :
sight to repeat with emphasis his state
ment quoted in these dispatches last;
night to the effect that he believed the
report that Commodore Schley had
flve.n battle to the Spanish fleet was in
:orrect, though he admitted that it was
possible that a single Spanish cruiser
i'een engaged.
The incredulity of the Navy Depart- ;
r.ent officials concerning certain feat- '
f the press report from Santiago
ry significant as indicating that \
T'lminodore Schley is under positive in- ;
st ructions not to enter the harbor of i
â ^.r.tiago, nor to risk; hia ships by any
ittempt to destroy the Spanish fleet at
:!use range. The bombardment of the
rises of the harbor appeared to have
jf-n hardly more effective than the at
:;i' k on San Juan, Porto -..ico, ; : iid
serves to emphasize the disadvantage
jnder whlcb a ll^et of vessels labors
vhen attacking fortifications located on :
i hii?h elevation.
s in such fortifications may easily
>c trained upon the unprotected decks:
>f approaching ve&BelB and projectiles
ierit Into their moat vulnerable parts,
i hile it is hardly possible for the heavy
{uns of an attacking fiec-t to be so i
flevated as to command the shore bat
a at an eff-M-tive range.
It is assumed that Commodore i
Jehley's assault has been somewhat ex- '
ipi^erated in the reports received and .!
Jiat his purpose was simply to gain ae
:urate information rf.^arding' the equip- â 
Â»ient of the batteries ami their range, i
There was much jubilation in the;
<avy Department this afternoon over '
he press reports, very generally j
:r..-dited. to the effect that the auxiliary
:rulser St. Paul had captured the Span- \
Bh troopship Alfonso XIII.
The official verification of this report [
rill serve to renew the feeling of gratl- j

NEW YORK, June I.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
I Austria has added 1 another irritating
quantity to the list of those which are
; now the subject of the controversy be
j tween the Vienna and Washington
| Governments. It developed: to-day that
! the State Department is paying con
j siderable attention to the auction of
; Austria in excluding the importation
into her territory of American fruits
1 and plants on the ground that they are
infected with the San Jose scale. The
decree of exclusion went into effect on
j April 20, and. an earnest effort has since
been made to cause its repeal but with
out success. It will be recalled that
Germany took similar action some
months ago and negotiations on the
subject were very emphatic, resulting
in a satisfactory modification. The of
ficial proclamation of the Austrian
Ministers of Agriculture, Interior,
Finance and Commerce has just been
received at the State Department and
is published In the consular reports.
Section 1 provides that importation
from America of live plants, cuttings,
sprouts or refuse from fresh plants of
any kind is prohibited.
Section 2 declares that the "Importa
tion from America, of fresh fruit and
refuse of fresh fruit and all packings
belonging thereto is prohibited when
at the place of entry an inspection of
goods and packing reveals the presence
of the San Jose scale."

NEW YORK, June I.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Rear Admiral Sampson arrived off
Santiago de Cuba this afternoon, and,
in accordance with his instructions, he
at once relieved Commodore Schley in
command of the entire force of vessels
in front of Santiago de Cuba and the
Spanish fleet, assigning that officer to
the command of a division composed of
ships formerly attached to the flying
squadron. Fifteen warships are at
Sampson's disposal to pit against six
men-of-war flying the Spanish flag.
They include the first-class battleships
lowa, Oregon and Massachusetts; sec
ond-class battleship Texas; armored
cruisers New To~k and Brooklyn; pro
tected cruisers New Orleans, Marble
head and Minneapolis; gunboat Nash
ville, torpedoboat destroyer Scorpion,
dynamite cruiser Vesuvius, torpedo
boat Porter, auxiliary cruisers Harvard
and Tale, and auxiliary gunboat Eagle.
With such a force blockading San
tiago de Cuba, naval experts who have
heretofore contended that Cervera had
a fighting chance to escape, now con
cede that his positi HJ is absolutely
hopeless. The concentration of such a
formidable force at Santiago is re
garded In some circles as presaging im
portant and immediate action by the
American fleet.
Careful inquiry, however, developed
the fact that Rear Admiral Sampson
before he left Key West was notified of

the programme adopted by the Govern- ;
ment to send troops to assist naval ves
sels in the capture or destruction of the
fleet; and confident the army will be!
able to arrive at its destination th due
season there is no reason to believe th* 1
officials have given Admiral Sampson
any further discretion than was ac
corded Commodore Schley. By this it is
not meant that the Naval War Board
has directed Rear Admiral Sampson
not to bombard the fortifications or en
ter the channel, but he has been ad
vised against such action, and owing to
the cautiousness of the man, it is not
believed he will cast this advice aside,
unless he believes another course is
very much preferable. In any case, I
undertsend Admiral Sampson, before
taking action, will inform the Naval
War Board of the circumstances exist
ing in Santiago de Cuba, and in this
dispatch he will probably mention
whether Commodore Schley has en
gaged the batteries as persistently as
reported, provided Commodore Schley
had not already done so before his ar-v
rival.
General Shafter's troops cannot pos
sibly go to the assistance of Rear Ad
miral Sampson before the beginning of
next week, so that operations against
the Spanish fleet may not be expected
before that time unless Cervera should
attempt to run the gauntlet of the
American ironclads.

STOCKTON, June I.â The San Joa
quln Valley wine makers and grape
growers are much excited over the news
that President McKinley has signed a
proclamation fixing the duties on
brandies and other spirits from France
at $1 20 per proof gallon and on still
wines at 35 cents. At a meeting hastily
called to-day a strong protest was au
thorized to be sent to Washington.
The wires between this city and San
Francisco were kept hot until all ar
rangements were made for a meeting
of delegates from other districts to be
held to-morrow and a committee from
Btocktonâ F. A. West and CA. Wet
more â was appointed to attend. Wet
more, than whom there is no one bet
ter posted in wine matters and par
ticularly as to the effects of legislation
and the treaty on the trade, explains
that the protection to brandies is sim
ply the difference between the inter
national revenue tax of $1 and the tariff
tax.
"The Associated Press," he said.
] "gives the duty fixed by the President
i as $1 20, or only 10 cents protection on
I proof spirits. Still wines, at 35 cents,
include ports, sherries and other forti
fied wines, which the tariff admits up
to 24 per tent of alcohol or nearly half
the strength of proof spirit?. As there :
is no protection against the importa
tion of artificial compounds it is clear
that under the proclamation compounds
| of cheap beet root and potato alcohol
j made to resemble sherry with chemicals
can be imported at loss rate of tax
I than that imposed by internal revenue, j
and can be held undercred.it o1o 1 a for
eign mark so as to exclude our pure
! fortified wines from the domestic mar
! ket, besides seriously reducing the reve
: nues of the country. .- .
"When the Wilson-Gorman act was
: being passed this danger was pointed
out to the Cleveland Administration
and was verified by the joint report of
I the representatives of the California
j wine men and the committee Â«f the
â  New York importers. The principle
; was then adopted that the tariff on ar
j tides containing: alcohol should not be
' held less than the international ' rev-
I enue tax. independent of any question
j of protection. â¢
"The power that promulpated this
i new rate of tariff has the power to sus
| pend its operation and if the wine men
and grape-growers make their pro
i tests and show the rightrousnfss of.
I their cause to the authorities I think
I the clause relating to', the tariff on
j wines can be suspended pending .a
! hearing, in which the wine mefi of this
i country ar^ bound to win on account
'â  of the showing th>y ran make^ . . ;.' ;
"As far as I am personally concerned.
I have my own ideas asto the constitii
; tionality of the act by which \ Congress ;
i has delegated the law-makinK .-power to '
I the Executive. Congress pas-se-d a
| tariff law and then delegfnted to the
1 President the power to change, it. Idp
not think it had a constitutional right
: to do so, but I am willing t>i make our
first shoeing to the President, in the
: expectation that he will see: the ju?
i tice of what jvc claim and act accbrdS
j ingly."
Mr. Wet more and Mr, West went- to.
the metropolis to-night to be present
lat the conference. i \ . V:/U. :

: eluded his task . thtpSaf ternbpn, ' when â 
the startling disclosure was made, The j
result: of /.thei; expert's ;: find ; : spread â  j
through the town and caused much ex

young Krohn and he admitted that the j
books showed : a.. shortage, : but claimed j
the shortage -was only â¢ on paper and ; i
that the money ; was in the safe before 1
it was taken by the robbers. ,1 ; : â â :;â  _-. -;X-:
The e;Xpert^ accdmpanied by an j of

cited over the events Â©f the last several
clays and is on the verge of nervous
prostration. He is also suffering from
kidney trouble, He is said to have been
looking very depressed for several days
before the alleged robbery occurred.
. Mr. Larew said the Deputy Tax Col
lector would hot be arrested at present.
On account of his excellent reputation
and his present condition the District

is striving to bring her aged father back
to his home by the ocean, is soon to wed
William J- English; a prominent attorney

as a surprise to her many friends.
Owing to the illness of her father the
marriage will be delayed, but as soon as
his health permits and the many mat

As yet it has not been decided whether

She is a vivacious brunette of charming
figure and a pleasing countenance. She
is a graduate of one of the leading semi

her father. During the past few years
she has resided at the heights with her
father, and has been his right hand in
all matters. When he was removed from
the house on the cliff by Mrs. Dr. Mer

J. Haynes and Judge Edward F. Dunne.
He is now associated with Mr. Heffernan,
and the firm ranks as one of the best in
the Windy City.
Besides having held many municipal po
sitions, he was, without his consent, nom
inated Probate Judge in the forthcoming
elections. Mr. English is first vice-presi
dent of the Chicago Bar Association, hav
ing been three times elected to that posi
tion. He. is a man of large means.
It is said that Miss Sutro met her future
husband while on a trip to Alas
ka, and became interested In him.
In company with his niece, Miss
Alice Ryan of Chicago. Mr. English
visited this city a. month ago and renewed
hia acquaintance with the young lady, an
acquaintance which ultimately ended in
the engagement. . Business of importance
called : him hurriedly East, but it is
thought that he will sooft visit this city
again.
SIX DROWNED

SHORE.

Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRIDGEPORT, June I.â Winslow P.
Nay, an ex-supervisor of Mono
County; Frank Montrose, James H.
Beane, John O. Malley, John Mathews
and Frank Shelton were sailing in
Nay's naphtha launch, on Mono Lake,
yesterday afternoon. When about a
half mile from shore the boat capsized
and all on board were drowned.
The wind was blowing a gale and the
men were warned that it was not safe
to attempt to cross, but persisted in
going. Nay's wife stood on the shore
with a glass and watched them. She
said that Just a moment before the
boat went down she saw the men ap
parently bailing water. It seems likely
that the boat sprang a leak and put
out the fire. Then the boat became un
manageable and capsized. Others wit
nessed the disaster, but thÂ» water was
so rough that no small boat could go
to their rescue.
The body of Beane was found on the
shore of Black Island near the center
of the lake at 11 o'clock last night.
None of the others have yet been
found. The launch was discovered near
the same spot on Black Island tnis
morning, bottom side up.
Nay leaves a widow and six children;
Montrose, a widow and eight children,
and Shelton a widow and four children.
Beane and Mathews were single men,
and O'Malley was a boy 17 or 18 years
old.
Constant watch is being kept for the
five missing bodies.
Worry Ends in Death.
STOCKTON. June I.â A telephone mes
sage from Farmington this morning an
nounced the death there of Nate Harrold,
a well-known farmer of this county and
Stanislaus. He had had a great deal of
financial trouble of late, culminating last
Saturday in the sale of nearly all his
property under foreclosure proceedings.
It is quite likely that this was the indirect
cause of his death, bringing on an apop
lectic stroke.

TROOPS AT CAMP MERRITT
Brigade Commanders Issue
Orders â Regimental Equip
ment Progresses
If Majnr-Oeneral Otis succeed In holding
off the Spaniards at Manila as he is now
doing the press of San Francisco, he can
sustain a siege there of indefinite length
without any base of supplies. The general
\.::s surrounded himself with staff officers
and sentinels, who kÂ«.ep an eye open con
tinuallly for the scout for news who in an
unpuarded moment crosses the line and
approaches headquarters.
The atmosphere around headquarters is
exceedingly frigid, and while the alert
staff officers and sentinels observe a for
mal courtesy, there is beneath It all the
hollow mockery of passing pomp and pea
cock grandeur. The merest general or
ders, relative only to the routine business
of the camp, are guarded with the same
secrecy as some deep-laid plot of anarchy.
The chief event of interest In camp yes
terday was the issuing of an order by
General Otis designating the senior col
onels in the various brigades who are to
command until the brigadier-generals ar
rival.
In the First Brigade Colonel Ovenehlne
of the Twenty-third Infantry commands;
In the Second, Colonel Reeve of the Thir
teenth Minnesota; In the Third, Colonel
Hale of the First Colorado, and in the
!> ourth, Colonel Kessler of the First Mon
tana.
The order designates tho following offi
cers as composing the general^ staff
; 'am John L. Behon, A. A G and aid
adjutant-general; First Lieutenant F w'

The order provides for the routine hours
of camp service. All signals are to be

had been issued from headquarters the

As to what brigadiers will command the
different brigades, at present all talk Is
merely speculation. The present brigade
formation is purely temporary and sub
ject to change at any moment, and many
of the Officers seem to think that there
will certainly be a reorganization when
the troops reach Manila. There was some
talk in. . â  camp yesterday of the second ex
pedition sailing to-morrow, but no definite
information could be secured upon this
subject from any of the officers. All of the
different commands are practically equip
ped and ready for service in the field.
The Blackwell Durham Tobacco Com
pany, through their agent, Heynemann,

yesterday to each soldier In the different
regiments that did not get one last week.
It was learned last night that Colonel

The First Nebraska received 554 rifles
yesterday, which completes its ordnance
equipment.

but It was reported to me that they declined to
appear for some reason which I do not now re
member. I have Hince learned in reference to
a part at least of the money which Mitchell re
cived that It was given to him by a friend for
his personal use. It is possible that other
money he wae alleged to have received was
given to him for the same purpose and In the
same way.
Mitchell was not drummed out of camp, but
he was ordered to go out and was conducted
to the linaa.
I make this explanation because I do not
wish to do the young man an Injustice nor to
Injure him without warrant. I do not know
Mitchell's reputation at Los Angeles, but from
indorsements that I have Been of him I cannot
believe that It Is bad.

GOING TO MANILA.
The Washington Volunteers at
the Fontana Barracks Re
ceive Welcome News.
The announcement In yesterday morn
ing's dispatches that the two battalions
of the First Washl. "ton volunteers would
go to the Philippines, and that they would
be joined later by the other battalion,
now at Vancouver, was received with
great satisfaction at the Fontana Bar
racks, where the former are stationed.
However, it was nothing more than what
the 'Washington men have expected from
the very tirst, as they all enlisted with
the intention and in the hope of going to
the front.
"It is but just," said Lieutenant Colonel
Fife, commanding the two battalions at
Fontana Barracks, "that the Pacific
Coast volunteers should have the' first .op
portunity of pulling their guns oh the
SpanisnUb The same waters that wash
the shores of the Pacific Coast will roll
up against the la/id of the enemy. We
shall be fully equipped and armed to-mor
row, and will men bear favorable com
parison with any regiment of volunteers
now within the limits of San Francisco.
I have sent for the regimental band and
headquarters, so that we shall in a few
days have all the paraphernalia of a reg
iment."
WILL REMAIN HERE.
Indications That the Sixth In-
fantry Will Be Assigned to
Patrol Duty.
It is practically settled that the Sixth
California will be detailed for duty at
Pacific Coast points. Company F has al
ready received orders to proceed to Santa
Cruz to protect tne powder works uÂ»ere
from Spanish spies, and will take station
Saturday. No further orders have ueen
received, but it is the opinion among offi
cers ana men that the other companies
will be sent to relieve the Fifteenth In
fantry in Arizona and other frontier posts
in order that the regulars may Join Gen
eral Merrltt's expedition. â¢ ": ;
Measles have broken out in the Sixth
Infantry, two cases having been reported
in Company E. The regiment is still en
campfi at the Presidio, consequently
there is little danger of the disease
spreading to other commands. The pa
tients are being cared for at the post hos
pital. '-..:... .-..-. :
Complaint Is made that the medical de
partment is exceedingly slow iri issuing
supplies. The field chests issued to the
Sixth Infantry were turned over to Col
onel Smith's regiment when it started for
Manila and have not been replaced yet.
The Sixth is alone now and far from the
other troops, and it seems to have oeen
.^' in. -what neglected of late. It should be
remembered that these men are Callfof
nians and must not be, allowed to suffer
from neglect. :

lie, .Â©ll Turk street. Instead of sending
lunches to the soldier boys encamped at
Richmond, the generous lady and . her:
guests decided to invite the members of
the visiting regiments to a dinner that
would remind them of home. With this
end In view an invitation was sent to
the Thirteenth Minnesota Regiment, in
viting sixty of its youngest members who.
were without friends in this city. In
preparation for their visit, the long din
ing room was beautifully decorated with
flags?, flowers and bunting, and two long
tables were set with dainties and appetiz
ing viands.
Five young- ajid handsome fellows were
detailed from each company, and they
repaired to the place of banquet with
light hearts and foiling* of thankfulness.
Their eyes were gladdened by the g'oocl
things before them. A hearty welcome
was given the visitors, and they sat down
and discussed the following menu:
Oxta.il. Consomhne.
Crab Salad. Lettuce and Radishes.
Boiled Salmon, New Potatoes.
Oyster Patties.
Boiled Ham. Olives. Smoked Tongue.
Young Turkey, Currant Jelly.
Prime Beef. Spring Lamb.
Asparagus. Green Peas.
. Vanilla ice Cream. Small Cakes.
Pound Cake. Nuts and Raisins.
Swiss Cheese.
Apples. . Oranges. Cherries.
Claj-et. Coffee.
Cheers and words of warm appreciation
were, given -by the contented Minnesotans
for the generous repast, nnd as they
marched out they received further tokens
of; kindness in the shape of boxes of
cigarettes, cigars and magazines.

trict Attorney Knight, at the instigation
of the Building and :'. Trades Council, filed
a ' complaint against : it . for '. a - violation of
: the I'nited States laws. Commissioner
;.Hoacock. listened to arguments and held
the defendants for trial. Mr. Knight then
tiled an : information against them in the
District Court and the defendants made
a motion to quash it on the ground that.a.
corporation : could not. be held; liable; under
the act of August 1, IS&2, and ; further that
if a corporation could be held :to be in
cluded within '-. the act there. was no pro

to -Quash was argued at length before
; Judge De Haven, who took the matter un- :â

â  ter very grave consideration and gave as
; his opinion that ; alu.ouirh .' a corporation ,â¢
was not mentioned in the act. neverthe

.'secondly that although ....e law . did â â¢ not

WHEAT AND BARLEY
TAKE A BIG FALL

Excitement and disappointment char
acterized trading in wheat yesterday. â 
Monday being a legal holiday in England,
â  no markets were Quoted from Saturday
until Wednesday. a The trade were gen
erally at â  sea : as to what view Liverpool
operators would take regarding the big
break :in spot wheat in ;â  the "';, Chicago
market.
:c To â¢' say that a panicky feeling : prevailed
at the opening of the Liverpool market
on Wednesday morning would be putting
it mildly. July wheat was 10 pence lower,;
with the far futures correspondingly ! de- :
pressed. Paris was not far behind, show
ing a big decline.-: On top of these bearish
features were shipments â  amounting to-.
13.000,000, the largest for any -six days dur- .
ing the : - past ten years. v- Russia alone
shipped 4,60" bushels, with India and
the Argentines also heavy shippers. :â â¢..-â¢.â .
Wheat in the Chicago market on the
ctirb ; -be.fore; the opening gave evidence of
what might be expected : when ; . : the gong
sounded. July closed on â¢>. Tuesday at v 98,
cents, : opened ;on : Wednesday :at 9fi to 95
cents, declined to cents, with Septem
ber ; and December : declining S'.- : cents each.
'. The market was very panicky through
â¢ out the '. day. These conditions caused a
break of 4 cents in: local wheat, December
going to $1 ::39%;: :39%; the lowest point reached
â â for two months.
The market became slightly. ; firmer to
â¢ward the close, when $1 40^; was bid. Spot â¢;
wheat was in poor ; demand, and this con- .
: tributed ; materially to : the depressed feel
ing. Another weakening factor was more
' favorable .; crop : prospects. Many who
thirty days ago placed the growing crops
â  at 230,000 to 3000.U00 tons â  ; have r increased-
: their estimates to :500,000.: 500,000. tons. : The mar
ket seems -v now- to have discounted these
influences, and -. a quick ' rally ; of â  no small
: proportions would : not be ; unexpected, v -: .. : â¢
. Barley was tossed..: about with -little:
regard as *-to-V price. '. ' December sold at
$1 14. Heavy offerings of Oregon and Wash
ington barley are gradually exerting -fa;
. depressing ; upon prices. Crop
pects are greatly improved. Many predict
that December "will go to Â»1 ere long.

MARTINIQUE'S NEW RULES.
The ex-Governor of Tahiti Arrives
in Town.
Monsieur Gabrie, who for the past
eighteen month? has been Governor of
Tahiti, to which office he was appointed
by the French Government, arrived In
this city yesterday afternoon with his
wife ahS child, and registered at the Oc
cidi ntal. The Governor said in an inter
view that the reason of his presence on
American soil was the fact that his Gov
ernment had relieved him from the Gover
norship of Tahiti, and had ordered him
to assume the reins of power over the
island of Martinique, one of the French
possessions in the West Indies, which has
had no Governor for over two years.
This move, he said, had no political
significance, but could be considered in
the nature of a promotion, for Martinknie
is of considerable more importance. ThÂ«
Minister of Interior at Tahiti has re
ceived the appointment of the Governor
ship made vacant by the transfer of Gov
ornor Gabrie. The" Tahithuis. he said,
were enger for news of the present war,
and. needless to state, their sviiipa
thfps are entirely with thfÂ» T'nited States.
The Governor also said that he was tak
ing advantage of his transfer to make his
journey t" Martinique one of pleasure.
He Trill remain in this city for about ten
days, visiting the various resorts, and
will then start for the new domain over
whose destinies he will preside for soma
time to come.
The Late Judge Campbell.
Momezuma Tribe No. 77 of the Im
proved Order of Red Men has adopted
resolutions of respect to the memory of
the late Judge James A. Campbell, who
was one of its active members. These,
prepared by a committee consisting of J.
G. Jeffries, George W. Collins and Dr. F.
C. Newton, and signed by George S.
Graham, sachem, and Thomas F. Butler,
chief of records, have been artistically
engrossed and framed for presentation to
the family of the deceased. For a few
days they will be on exhibition In the
show window of Roos Brothers.
Charter Vote Announced.
The Board of Election Commissioner*
met this morning and canvassed the offi
cial vote on the charter, declaring thÂ«
following results:
For the charter, 14 389 votes; against tha
charter, 12.U25; majority for the charter,
2VA. The official count resulted In a gain
of three votes for the charter.
The registration of voters for the next
general election began yesterday morn
ing. Under the law all voters must regis
ter in order to vote at the next general
election.
Bank Dividends Declared.
W. E. Palmer, secretary and manager of the
Pacific Horn? Savings iiank. now in liquidation,
announces that a dividend of 3 per cent has
been declared for the benefit of depositors.
Tlifs will be paid on and after July 6 at the
of?|<-e of the Columbian Banking Company in
the Claus t?preckels building:. This Is known
as dividend No. 4 and makes a total of 21 pv>r
cent paid to the depositors since the bank went
into liquidation.
Complained of Vandals.
1,. Flehett, an expressman on First street,
between Folsom and Harrison, complained at
police headquarters yesterday of the work of
vandals. He said that Tuesday night flva
nuts had 'been -taken out of one of his wagons,
broken glas* had been spattered among the hay
in his barn and other damage done. He \\;<s
afraid that an attempt would be made to burn
(lovn hip barn and asked for police protection.
The officer on the beat was Instructed to keep

THE CMfINGING YELLOW.
SINCE the yellow Examiner has pulled down I
the Spanish hucd awnings from its windows [
it has evidently had a clearer perception of the â 
ruth of things around it. It has now changed the
one of its war editorials and is piping quite differ
ently from what it did while the red and yellow of j
Castile overhung its windows and affronted the pa
riotism of the people.
In the days of the Spanish awnings it published an
ditorial under the title, "Let Us Have Action," which
iegan with the abrupt statement: "President Mc-
Cinley, let us have more vigor in waging war. It
las been over a month since the war opened, yet
a the direction of Cuba nothing has been accom
i'i>hed." Commenting on the work of the navy in
he Caribbean Sea it said: ''The greater part of the
ime the fleet has been wandering aimlessly hither
nd thither at the contradictory commands of a dif
ering Board of Strategy." Of the military' forces it
aid: "Vet there i> no army ready for the work, and
hough over io,?,ooo of the volunteers are reported
mistered in, the reports come from everywhere of
ick of blankets, tent>, uniforms and even food supply.
There seems a plentiful lack of organization."
On another occasion, under the caption, "What's
Vrong at Washington?" it asked: "What is the mat
er at Washington? The war has lasted just one
aonth to-day, and what has been accomplished?
Tuba is still in the hands of Spain. So is Porto Rico,
nd both are harder to take now than they were when
â¢resident McKinley ordered the Spaniards to leave."
t went tin to say-; "Rouse yourself and do some
hing, Mr. McKinley. Dismiss the timid men, the
iver\vi>e men, the too learned strategists who sur
ound you." It added: "Feebleness of purpose, be
wilderment of mind, and an amazingly unsanguinary
!isposition, mark the Washington end of this con
ict A whole month and nothing done â nothing but
he Manila victory, the great blaze of which now
tghts up the astounding lethargy of the Government.
Vhat's the matter. Mr. McKmley?"
The^e carping, sneering words could have been in
?nded for no other purpose than that of weakening.
I possible, the confidence of the people in the chief
la^istrate. They were designed to create dissensions
nd to harass the President in his arduous work of
â¢reparing the nation for the close and final grapple
;ith the foe. They were fit words to emanate from
n office adorned with Spanish colors and were ap
â¢ropriate in a journal that shamelessly exults in its
â¢ellowness. but evidently the people gave warning
hat the attacks on the President had been carried too
Â»r. for the Examiner has now changed the tone of its
tutorials as well as the hue of its awnings.
Yesterday the yellow organ gave the President
redit for vigor and industry. In an article bearing
he title, "Commendable Energy." it said: "The evi
ent disposition of the administration to urge on the
rar as rapidly as men can be equipped and sent for
ward is highly gratifying to the people." After a
;w general remarks it added: "From the vigor that
5 being shown in the present movements we may
â elieve the administration has used its best endeavors
o put an army in the field ready for effective service
nd to direct it as promptly as was considered safe
o perform the work for which the war was under
iken." , â . ''â â â 
The change of tone is significant. It shown the
lollowness, falseness and baseness of the attacks
nade in the first place. The President is acting now
i he acted from tlie start, and the self-styled "eom
nendation" given him by the Examiner is as un
leeded as its original attacks and denunciations were!
ile and contemptible. . : ; :â :'â â  -j
While the Board of Education has been: ':busy!
quandering money and in part devoting itself to
:eeping out of jail, the faithful teacheTS are cheered :
iy the information that: they are to receive no more;
alary until the end of July. Of course this is a
hame and a disgrace, but if the people choose to put
ogues into office somebody is sure to -suffer, and
his time the teachers : happen to be the victims. \-.
Explanation is made that troops were hot rnov<ld

THE LEAGUE CONVENTION.
T~~J RIGHT auspices, prophetic of Republican syc
[Y cess, are evident in every phase and feature of
the convention of league clubs. The number of
delegates present, the personal distinction of. many of :
them, the ardor and zeal displayed, the general fit^
iiess and eloquence of the speeches, each in its' way
and degree attests the enthusiasm of the party and
gives encouragement to the sanguine hopes of the
loyal for a sweeping victory on election day.
To accomplish that result two things will be
I needed â a comprehensive and thorough organization
i of the rank and file of the party in all portions of the
j Slate and good nominations. The achievement of the
I first of these will almost inevitably bring about the at
j tainment of the other. If all Republicans can be
I aroused at this time to a realization of the importance
I of attending to their political duties it will be well nigh
a?- Mired they will elect delegates to county and State
conventions who will see to it that the nominees are
truly representative of the party as a whole and not
! the favorites of a clique of bosses or the tools of Cor^
! porations. ' .'â ' 'â  y '.:J' : U-\'-' â ]â :â â ; '- - ).';
The people of California are prepared to entrust the
administration of the affairs of the State to the Repub
lican party for the next gubernatorial term, just as
they are prepared to elect sound money protectionists
;to Congress from every district. Nothing can -change
i this attitude of the popular mind but the : Republican
party itself. If the party falls below the; needs of the
time and the measure of the opportunity it will sxiffer
defeat notwithstanding ail the favorable omens that
surround it. It can win only by nominating for
Governor a man of known worth, free from the con
trol of bosses and unpledged to corporation interests:
The league convention was not designed to nomi
nate candidates. Nevertheless its members cannot
overlook the advantage which their gathering gives
for a general discussion of candidates and the select
tton of the right man to lead the party in the carrt^
paign. This is the time to consider the subject: If
consideration is postponed until county conventions
pre called, the rival candidates will have entered the
field and men will be pledged one way of another;
It will then be too late to give the issue the cool : and
considerate reflection it deserves. Now. that Republi
cans are assembled from all sections of the conimon-..
wealth Jet them discuss men as well as measures. The
signs of the time point to the one conclusion that a :
corporation candidate for Governor means defeat for
himself and a handicap for the ticket generally, while
an independent candidate for Governor rn earls victory;
for himself and for all who stand with him, : V .
THE COMING WATCHWORD.
' I 'HK other day a friend and late supporter of the
i new charter outlined the hopes of the adyoeates
* of the instrument by saying, "The people will
have as good a chance to capture the Jytayor as the
I bosses, and it is certain that we will get him bcca
! sio;naily." â ': 'â :; ; '.;-â :. '.:'::â â¢ 'â "'â¢â¢'>;.; .~ :.':
If this represents the average opinion of those
who have fastened a, Czar Mayor upon this city, we
'are free to say that it fails entirely ta meet the issue.
During the campaign we were repeatedly told that
the people were sure to get the Mayor aJ;I the time.;
That was the theory upon which the adoption pf the
charter was urged, and that -was the idea which evi
dently influenced the judgments of large numbers of
those who voted for its adoption. ; ; â¢
But if the people, as the gentleman quoted now
says, are going to get the Mayor only occasionally
this town is up a tall tree at the very outset. Indeed
it will never do to propagate this kind oMaikJ ; : If
the bosses are ever permitted, to 'capture the Czar
they will so thoroughly entrench themselves as to
render their subsequent dislodgrhent practically im
possible. The Mayor appoints and removes at pleas
ure boards and commissions which in turti appoint
and remove 83 per cent of the tax eaters who will
i exploit the city treasun- under the neW charter.
This makes him the absolute dictator of the patron
age. Through the Civil Service Commission Jwhich
he also appoints and /removes at pleasure, he wjll in
fluence, if not control, the patronage of the elected
heads of : departments. Through the Police Commis
sion; he will control the ''saloon vote.*' l; Through the
Board of Public Works he will influence th^ ; property
owning interest, and through all these boards and
commissions he will to some extent mo|ii the political
opinion of the city. The grand, army pi who
help to change the government every- two years, are
disposed of by the civil service rules. : :
There are in the gdvernment outlined between
20,000 and 25,000 voteSi If the boss "who is destined
to '"occasionally" capture the Czar Mayor possess the
genius to organize and solidify these votes he will
present a formidable obstacle to reform. It logically
follows that if such a man once gets control of them
it will be extremely difficult to unhorse him. He will
oppose all charter amendments designed to curtail
his power and defeat the cohorts of "reform" every
time he meets them at the ballot-boxes.
It will never do to talk about letting the bosses
"occasionally" capture the Mayor; the Merchants'
Association, Mayor Phelan, Deacon Fitch, Reformer
i Britton and the others who have fastened this po
! tentate upon us must see to it that he is kept out of
( their clutches. These gentlemen have an impor
j tant duty to fulfill during the remainder of their
lives, and when they die they must pledge their sons,
as the father of Hannibal and Hasdrubal pledged
theni; to fight forever in the cause they leave behind.
In this way only can the liberties of the town be pre
served. All talk of "occasionally" -winning must be
abandoned. The watchword must be always "Give us
an honest, independent Mayor, or give us oblivion."
Any compromise tfn this sentiment will be fatal.
If Russia wants part of the Philippines, and thinks
for a iniriutt to get it, her masterly cheek has never
been equated among nations. This country did not
undertake to punish Spain until forced after months
of 'diplomacy- to begin action, As an incident it will
take the Philippines. It will not take them for the
benefit of Russia. It does not care whether or not
Russia likes its course, and! it will come out of the
contest with nothing to divide with the powers, who
since; the beginning have given sympathy to Spain.

THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, . THURSDAY, JU3s T E 2 % 1398.
DEMOCRACY AND THE WfiÃ,
DEMOCRATIC papers in the; Eastern; States
are taking .a gloomy view ot: the prospects of
their party irj. the comittg campaign. They de
clare the war will have the effect of strengthening the
hold of the administration ; upon the people, ihcreas
iisg the Republican ranks by the addition of all inde
pendent voters, and that Democracy arid Populism
combined will appear in many parts of the country as
hardly more than a faction of opposition.
This despondency in Eastern Democratic ranks Â«
diie almost wholly to the action taken by the Demo^
crats in Congress in opposing the war revenue bill.
Prior to that opposition the war was as much a Den>
oeratje as a Republican measure. It was urged by
leaders as vigorously as by those of the
Republican party, and the: Vote of $50,000,000 for de
fense.-was unanimous. There was no suggestion of
party lines on the issu*. The conflict with Spain was
a popular as well as a national: war. No one expected
that it would ever hare any partisan coloring what
ever. It was believed that: all parties .and all candidate
Would go before the people in the coming campaign
on equal terms s6 far as the war spirit was concerned
and that the patriotism of the people would not be
called upon to determine a political contest in any
section: of the Union. ; ',:.:;: : . .i : :
:: There has been: a change in the situation and the
blame for it rests upon the silver fanatics of Con
gress. The: great mass of Democratic voters are un
doubtedly as loyal and as patriotic as their Repub-
Hean neighbors, but they cannot escape response
bility for the action of their representatives. The
Democratic platform on which the party will have
to condtict its fight is being made Up. at Washington
and is taking the form of opposition; to war revenues.
He that opposes raising money for defraying the cost
qf the war might as well oppose the war itself. It is
for that reason conservative Democrats in the East
are becoming disgusted with their Congressional
leaders and despondent of the future of their party, i
We have here another illustration of the fact that
evil once admitted to any: organization can never be
quickly eradicated. Bad seed brings forth bad frtrit.
The war, by raising new prospects: before the A.meri- :
eari people, gave the Democrats: a hope that they
be able to get fid of Bryaiiism and go forward
to a new departure. The-se hopes have been disap
pointed. The Bryanites are ih: bfficie and they have
acted in a way that bafÃes the hopes of the better
element of Democracy. They have placed the party
in an attitude of opposition to the administration on
a. great measure growing out of the war, and protests
from individual petnocrats here and there count for
nothing.. â¢. â ';.':: â¢. â : ; â ';:â â â¢[ â :'â â 'â ]' â â : : - Z 'â ''â 'â 
â  Under these circumstarices the conduct of the war:
njKressarily becomes something of a partisan measure.
The independent voters of the country certainly can
hot .follow Democracy in; opposing the war revenue
bill. Principles of patriotism as well as the policy
of sound finance will incline men to stand with the
flarty of the administration during the coming cam
paign. Democracy has committed the usual blun
der in a time of crisis and must pay the penalty on
election day. :. , : / ::
DECORATION DAY ADDRESSES.
BY all odds the most notable Decoration day
addresses of the celebration this year were
those delivered at Arlington cemetery, near
Washington Gity. It is not often the capital holds
this pre-eminence among the chics oi the : Union.
Though she has all Congress to call iipon for orators,
it is fafelythat she obtains one whose Vords con
mand the attention of -the nation. As a rule the chief
place in Decoration day reports . is ' giyeir to some
orator other than those who spoke in sight of the
dome of the capital and: with the inspiration of all
the memories of the place ardund hjtiv ..!;â 
This year, however, fortune was with Washington,
notwithstanding the fact that neither of the orators
who pronounced the orations at Arlington is of the
first rank of eloquence. Senator Thurstony indeed,
vyhb $j|o;ke for the heroes of the : arnly, has made sev
eral notable speeches in li is time, but ek-Secretary
Herbert; .who spoke for the heroic dead of the navy
lias hardly been accounted an orator at all, having
been rioted in Congress for diligent comiftittee work
rathtrthan for eloquence on the floor. Yet these two
tiieri,. one :6f the North md one of the South, have
this year had the honor of speaking for the nation
and having the whole people for an audience.
As w^s to have been expected; the theme of each
was the evidences now seen on all sides of the com
plete restoration of the union of hearts as well as o
States. Every new manifestation of this evidence is
another garland added to the wreath of glory that
surrounds the Grand Army and the galaxy of states
men who preserved the Union from the peril of civi
war and freed it from the dangerous blight of slavery.
It is significant that on this theme Herbert of Ala
bama, himself a soldier in the ranks of secession,
spoke as clearly and as patriotically as Thurston, who
represented the dominant and unchanged loyalty o
the North. The voices were two, but the sentiment
was one; that of honor and praise for the heroic
dead who gave their lives that the nation might live.
A new war for humanity and liberty now holds the
attention and engages the energy of North and Soutl
alike. A new generation representing a united people
goes forth to uphold the cause for which the brave
men of the Grand Army fought through the long
years of the Civil War. Well did Senator Thurston
say: "Rest in peace, O mighty dead. The cause for
which you fought can never be assailed. Rest in peace
â the race whose freedom you achieved will bless yot
with their latest breath. Rest in peace â the Union
you preserved remains forever, and liberty, eqiia
rights and justice are the heritage of your descendant
to the Judgment Day. God bless the men who fol
lowed the flag."
Admiral Dewey will win new admiration by pro
tecting, the Spanish captain whom the Spanish sav
ages wanted to kill because he had surrendered when
he had his choice of doing this or going down in his
tory as a fool.

UNCLE SAM'S PXTBPOSE.
Editor The San Francisco Callâ Sir:
"When one reflects that the declared pur
pose of the United States Government,
as expressed in the resolution passed by
Congress and signed by the President,
was to Intervene in Cuba to put an end
to the war in that island, to relieve the
starving reconcentrados and to aid the
Cubans to attain their independence from
Spanish rule; and further, that resolu
tion contained a clause expressly dis
claiming any intention on the part of the
United States to wage a war of conquest
against Spain, it would seem that the
only explanation to be offered in justifi
cation of the present attitude of the
United States Government toward the
Philippine Islands is found in hypothetical
reasoning, thus: If we squeeze Spain
hard in ncr Eastern Hemisphere posses
sions she will let go of her hold on- those
In the Western, so as to get a stronger
hold on the former; and thus, by moving
aggressively in that direction, we may
be rewarded by Spain relinquishing Cuba,
without our being compelled to drive Out
the Spaniards by armed invasion of the
island.
This would appear to be a reasonable
hypothesis, but from Indications to date
it is quite evident that we will be forced
to fight to take the Philippines, and also
to fight to render any valuable assistance
to the Cubans. Should not we, then, let
the Philippines alone and concentrate our
efforts nearer home? This would be more
in keeping with our officially declared
purpose. JOHN AUBREY JONES.
TEE ATTITUDE OF FBANCE.
If the United States is to refuse to take
part in the international exposition simply
because some French newspapers print
mean things about it, this Government
should at least reserve upo.ce for a large
billboard to bear the legend: "We have
taken our playthings and gone home."â
Chicago News.
Once let the existence of an elevated na
tional spirit in France which would side
with this country as against Spain be
seriously doubted a"nd it would soon as
sert itself in terms that could not be mis
taken. In fact its assertion has already
been strikingly manifest within the past
few days.â Boston Globe.
It is not what these newspapers may
say, but what the Government and the
people of France shall do, that will be
accepted here as conclusive evidence of
the spirit and temper of Spain's nearest
neighbor to the northward in the war
which has been forced upon us. If. for
example, the French island of Miquelon
should be turned practically into a coal
ing station and rendezvous for a Spanish
fleet bound on a mission of destruction to
our Atlantic coast the event would be ac
cepted as a clear-cut demonstration of
hostility on the part of the French Gov
ernment. Then, surely, the boycotting of
French wares In the American market
might readily assume the aspect of a pa>
trlotic duty, which not even the most in
veterate admirer of Parisian finery would
neglect or ignore.â Philadelphia Record.
The probable truth Is that the frugal
Frenchman has, to use the expressive
street argot, "taken a tumble." He has
heard something drop over on this side of
the Atlantic, and has come to realize that
ho has been acting and talking like an
egregious ass; that he has been try'nf? to
kill the best golden-esrg-laylng goose on
earthâ the genuine American prodigal
money spender. The French people have
as trong an affection for the almighty
dollar as the proverbial Yankee, and are
as apt in depleting the pockets of their
guests and Visitors as the most thrifty
landlord of an Atlantic watering place.
Their best customers have been from this
side the Atlantic, in fact from the United
Btates and Russia their special profits
have for generations been derived. â Seat
tle Times.
. What would become of the Paris millin
ers if. the Yankee millionaires had their
wives patronize home industry instead ot
sending their orders abroad? What would
become of the Paris hotels of the first
class if Americans ceased to visit the
city? And, wotst of. all, what would bo
come of the Fair of ISOCi if American pro r
auctions and the American public were
conspicuous by thejr abÃence? . The
thought was a sobering one.' It is all very
well *o give way to your true feelings, but
it is necessary to consider the question
whether you can afford to do so or not.
Wise persons consider on what side their
bread is buttered and act accordingly. So
some of the Paris journals have raised
their voices in warning. They have told
their readers that they must not say
everything that they think, but rather
conceal their true feelings. The Ameri
can dollars, and plenty or them, are still
desirable. We don't set much store on
the civility of the waiter whose mind is
fixed on the subsequent tip. â New York (

THAT WOODEN FENCEâ S. A. M.,
City. The wooden picket fence that has
been placed around the United States
Mint property at Fifth and Mission

BANK ROBBERYâ S., Rocklin, Placer
County, and Subscriber, Selma, Fresno
County. There was no robbery of a bank
in San Francisco in 1552 or thereabouts by
a man known as "Three-Fingered Jack."
The correspondents probably refer to the
robbery in the store of Jansen, Bond &
Co. on Montgomery Btreet, when the
senior partner was attacked, almost beat
en to death and robbed. A man was ar
rested, positively identified by the wound
ed man, was taken by the Vigilance Com
mittee and sentenced to be hanged, but,
just before the time set for the execution,
the man, who gave the name of Thomas
Burdue, was saved, as another man, a
convict from Australia named James
Stuart, was apprehended, and he was the
exact counterpart of Burdue. He con
fessed that he had committed the crime
and admitted the justness of the punish
ment he was to receive. This case was
one of this most remarkable on record.
Both men were of the same stature, each
wore long brown hair waving over the
shoulders, long, black pointed beard, each
had lost a joint of the same finger on the
same hand, each had a little slit in the
left ear, each had the same shaped scar
over the left eyebrow, each stooped and
each had thp same peculiarity of gait.
The only difference in the two men was
the peculiar expression of eyes and mouth
in Stuart which was missing in Burdue.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 2, 1898.
SCHWERIN
HAS NO
FRIENDS
At Least None Rushes
to His Defense.
PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE HIM
DENOUNCED AS A BULLY WHOM
EMPLOYES FEAR.
Trying to Enwrap the Process of Out
fitting- Ships for the Second
Manila Expedition With
Mystery Prof ound.
It has often bepn the duty of The Call
to direct attention to some pernicious
instance of human frailty. In pur
suance of this duty It mentioned yes
terday Schweriri of the Pacific Mail.
To its sorrow, it was not able to men
tion him pleasantly.. It was hampered
by the circumstance that Schwerin's
personality has upon the observer much
the effect produced by the presence of
a horned toad. The man lacks winning:
ways. Yet it was in no spirit of un
kindness that an effort was made to
point out to Schwerin the error of his
ways. It was sought to. reform him,
not out of regaxd for him, but as a pro
tection to those who are forced into
contact with him.
| . Schwerin still persists in his right to
1 keop newspaper men from the dock at
j which f team era are now being: fitted
out for Manila. He has a habit, of per
sisting 1 in certain rights, which nobody
else recognizes. It was under his man
agement that the Colima went to the
bottom, and under his able direction
the New York went to pieces on the
rocks of Point Bonita. Schwerin is not
held in high esteem if the matter is to
be judged from the commendations ex
cited by the few remarks Concerning
I him. Brieâ¬ ; quotations from some of
| the letters received yesterday may. be
of interest. A Battery-street merchant
writes as follows:
Tbu deserve the praise.of every mer
chant in San Francisco, and you are
getting it on all sides. I read with
many others with extreme satisfaction
your comments on R. P. Schwerin, late.
of the navy, now the most detested man
in transportation circles. I have fre
quent dealings : with the. gentleman <
(pardon the word). His main idea seems
to be. to impress you with a sense that
he is master and you the serf; I note j
that you ha^e overlooked his navy
record. The fact is he left the service j
just in. time to pave the expense of a j
court-martial. He was executive of
ficer of the Thetis. Uncle Colits came I
to his rescue with a job; hence more
bad luck to San Francisco and her
merchants. ' â 
Of course the signature will not be
given here. â  The merchant seems to
have trouble enough now. But here
are some extracts' from another letter:
In yesterday's and this morning's
Call I read your editorials on .R. P.
Schwerin. As an. ex-employe of that i
humbug I can verify all that you said j
about him, and a good deal more. It
wouldn't be. a bad idea-if you touched
him up a Qttle about the way he treats
people who call at his office to see him
On business. '."'.'..
After the loss of the Colima. he had
men brought to his office for several
days to be coached :as to the way they
should testify before the court of in
quiry. He also paid Captain John Met
calf $25 a day with free transportation,
etc.,. for testifying. If I remember cor- .
rectly, he paid a- like amount to an ex
pert from the Union Iron Works. I per
sonally, prepared the vouchers. '
He has the men at the dock in such a
state that they are afraid of their |
shadows. Every man thinks that the |
other is a spy on his action. He is i
about right, if one may judge by the j
way they carry tales to Schwerin, who
encourages them and thinks it a fine !
thing to have his men in such a state I
of misery. â¢ â¢ *: I do not wish you |
to publish this over my name. â¢ â¢ *
The fact of my having a wife to sup
port would not prevent Schwerin.
hounding me.
But these facts, interesting as they
may be, are, after all, but side issues.
Grievance arises from the circum
stance that Schwerin does not intend
to permit the public to know how the
ships chartered from the Pacific Mail
for carrying soldiers to Manilla are be
ing fitted up. When the City of Peking
was being prepared the truth concern
ing it leaked out and naturally excited
indignation, for the bunks put in were
wholly without regard for the health
or comfort of the boys who were to oc
cupy them. That Schwerin is trying to
keep details of the present outfitting a

secret is accepted as evidence that it is
to be likewise faulty.
The Oceanic line is also making
ready ships to serve as transports, and
it is not trying to wrap proceedings in
mystery. It will be remembered that
the Australia, of the first expedition,
was provided with every appliance for
convenience, room, and. sanitary ad
vantage. Anybody who wished to see
the progress of the work had the priv
ilege of viewing it. At every stage the
work was satisfactory. On the Peking
it was different. The public was barred,
and the work was so far from perfect as
to excite general protest. Therefore when
Schwerin again attempts to be ex
clusive,, a suspicion arises that he is
up to his old tricks.
Incidentally there is extant a biog
raphy of Schwerin, showing his con
nection with the navy and his disconnec
tion with the same, as Avell as sundry
characteristics such as " beseem the
czar of the dock, lord of the teredoes
and acknowledged terror of the steve
dore, but there is no room for it here.
What people may think of Schwerin is
really not important so long as he re
frains from his swagger and does not
mistake himself for the quintessence of
all earthly wisdom and authority.
ARRIVAL OF THE

I â¢ The theatrical company which J. J.

ter gentleman will be stage manager for

fact that he was the original stage man

years. â¢ 'â ->,' ;. -V;.. â¢! ;â¢: . ; ..; . ? v .â  . :
This is beyond air doubt the greatest
aggregation of players that the "astute
Frawley has ever gathered together, and
what is more, it is the highest salaried

der his management. Each member has
been engaged with a view to the peculiar
fitness of the artist fn his or her particu
lar line. â¢ The greatest difficulty was expe- â¢
' rienced in- securing a leading lady who
came up to Mr. Frawley's ideal and final

All the artists expressed themselves as .
being particularly well pleased to be in |
San Francisco and as anxious to begin j
rehearsals for the opening piece on Mon
day, Juno 13, which is to be Augustln Da

it is said that the Frawley Company will .

Catholic Truth Society.
RÂ»v. Father Yorke had what he- termed an in
formal talk with the members of the Catholic
Truth Society in . St. Mary's Cathedral last,
night. There was a large attendance. He spoke,
particularly of the attempt being made to
deny the Cathojlc soldiers at Camp Richmond
the right to receive religious instruction of
their church. He urged the members of the so
ciety to use their influence and protests' to get
the evil remedied by the Government. In In
stancing the evil be spoke of a lady who one
day last week was distributing circulars
among members of the Minnesota regfment
notifying them that mass Would be celebrated
in the Cathedral last Sunday morning. She
met the chaplain, a Methodist clergyman, who
objected to the distribution of the circulars,
and Informed her that the men would receive
religious instruction from him. To enable
Catholic soldiers to attend mass a large tent
â will be erected at the camp in two or three
days. He asked for books and magazines to
be sent with the next transports and appealed
to the generosity of the people for extra funds
to defray the cost of a special prayer-book.
POLICE HOLD

PAWNBROKER IS IN LUCK
DETECTIVES AS COLLECTOBS FOR
BURGLARS' FENCES.
How Baker Walka Is Puzzled to Un
derstand Why Lees' Julen
Won't Let Him Have
His Own.
Here are a few facts which demonstrate
the peculiar methods of the PoHce Depart
ment. The Police Department is controlled
by Chief Lees. Mr. Lees is the stately
looking old gentleman who at parade
events bestrides a high-stepping horse,
displays:a bloodless sword and pines that
no drum corps trails at the tail of his
steed.
As an additional preliminary, it may De
added that the partaker is as bad as the
thief; that the receiver of stolen goods
has no standing in law, and that, beyond
peradventure-, the police are not paid for
protecting him. With this explanation, a
little story may be told and a moral
drawn.
Gustav Walka, by birth a Swede, by
trade baker, and at present out of a job,
recently had a $45 Suit, stolen from his
room. Having acquired somewhere, a.no
tion as to the potency of the police, he
reported the matter to them. Two of the
sleuths of Lees were put upon the track,
made the round of pawnshops and found
the suit at 617 Washington street, at
which place the proprietor had advanced
$7 50, with the stolen booty as collateral.
Walka identified the clothes, but he did
not get them. This is the peculiar part
] of the. narrative.
! He was told by the police that before he
could get the suit he would, have to pay
the pawnbroker $7 50. They took the suit,
and have it yet, awaiting the time when
Walka shall be able to redeem his own..
In other words, they are acting as col
lector for a pawnbroker who has no right
to a cent. One advancing money on stolen
goods does so at his own risk, according
to the statute; but the police seem to rise
superior to the statute. They are with
holding from Walka a suit he has once
paid for and is under no obligation to. pay
for again. . They are siding in with a
' pawnbroker who not only is entitled to
no protection but who should be arrested
as a receiver of stolen goods. â¢ . . I
Tht>se circumstances are respectfully [
called to the attention of the Chief. Per- j
' haps in his anxiety to have a drum corps j
organized for his glorification he has over
looked the act of these underlings and
will be glad to make them explain to the I
commission why they, are keeping from,
the owner one $45 suit of clothes to which
he has clear title, to which his right is
undisputed and to which neither they nor
their pawnbroklng friend has the slightest
claim. '
A FORESTIG CIRCLE.
Session of the Grand Body of the
Companions of the Forest of

The rebate system will prevail in the sell

to those originally announcedâ St. Louis,
Chicago and Now- York. A ticket to
Kansas City will be : sold at; the present
rate of $40. and the passenger: will re
ceive a rebate order for $9, thus making
the fare 131. To Boston the present rate
of $67 SO will carry a rebate of $25 25, mak
ing the fare $42 55, which is the same
rate as applies to New York. The pres
ent rate to New York is $6ti 50 with a re
bate of $23 95; to St. Louis $47 50, with a
rebate of $10 50 on the terminal point; to
Chicago 152 50 and a rebate of $20.
The rates via Ogden are still under dis
cussion, and it is expected â¢' that some
agreement will be reached before Sunday
and. there is reason to believe that the

"MA ANGELINE"
IS A PIRATE
Judge Morrow Declares
O'Brien a Buccaneer.
"DCBA DEAN" IS ORIGINAL
BUT HER WORDS M.TJST BE
CHANGED FOR MORALITY.
"She's the Hottest Thing You Ever
Seen" Does Not Strike the
Court as! the Proper
Thing.
Persona who may hereafter sing the |
dulcet strains of "Ma Angeline" will do !
so with a guilty conscience, and will be
accessories to piracy. That is the effect
of a. decision made yesterday by United
States Circuit Judge Morrow in the cele
brated case of John P. Broder and Hugo |
V. Schlam against the .Zeno Mauvals j
Music Company. The suit was brought I
to recover damages : for an alleged in- |
frlngement of copyright of the melting I
song "Dora Dean," composed by Bert A.
Wmiams, It is alleged that "Ma An
geline, " computed .Dy Charles Sidney
O'Brien, is Dora Dean" in another cos
tume. In other words, that Mr. Q'Brien
stole the melody and rechristened it.
Not only that, but lie sold it to the de
fendants tor $5.
Mr.W illlams. is a Cuban In color, though
of African descent and American breed-
Ins* Mr. O'Brien, as his name Indicates, >
is of Irish extraction on his grandfathe r's I
side, but his maternal ancestry is unmis- !
takably African. In fact, he is as black
as a Ravanese ace of spades;
Judge Morrow, in his decision, was del
icate about this ingredient of the case,
and in referring to ihe complexion of the I
rival composers remarked with a finesse j
that would do credit to a diplomat: "Both
â of the songs are colored melodies, and
both of the aileged composers of the
songs are colored gentlemen."
Then the court, with set teeth and a j
grin, air of determination, plunges into |
the very middle of the subject, and adds:
"It is claimed that the song 'Ma An
geline' was pirated from the song 'Dora
Dean," and on the other hand the de
fendant claims that the song 'Dora'
Dean' was pirated from 'Ma Angelina." !
Then the coup de grace is given in the I
next sentence:
"It is conceded that the melody of the
two songs la substantially the same."
This matter having been disposed of as
proving that one or the other of the two
colored composers is a pirate, the Judge
takes up another branch of the case.
"The second question which arises in
this vase is whether the use of the word
hottest 1 fn the song 'Dora Dean" as iirst
published has the effect of rendering the!
song obscene and vulgar, and thereby ex- I
ciuding it from the class of compositions
that may be copyrighted. The word oc
curs in the line, 'She's the hottest thing
you ever seen.' In other words, the ti.ue.s- i
tion is whether the use of the word 'hot- i
test renders the song morally objection
able, musical compositions of an immoral
character not being protected by copy- I
right.
"The original restraining order was dis
charged and the motion for a preliminary,
injunction denied by my predecessor, now
Mr. Justice McKenna. on the ground that
the word 'hottest' as used in the song
'Dora Dean' was an indecent and ob
soene expression. Since that ruling addi- |
tional testimony has been presented on
both sides. That introduced on behalf of
the plaintiff is that the word "hottest" as
used in the song and as understood by the
colored people has no obscene or vulgar
meaning, and simply means 'grand,' 'bril
liant.' or, as one of the witnesses stated j
it means with the colored people the same
as the expression 'She's out of sight' does
with some white people."
Judge Morrow does not consult his own
observation for a solution of the problem
but finds authority in the dictionary. He
says:
"While it cannot be said the word 'hot- '
test," as used in its ordinary sense, is vul- !
gar per se, yet In its colloquial or vernac- j
ular meaning, as applied to a woman, it i
is obviously different. The word 'hot ' as !
defined in Webster's Unabridged Diction- i
ary, means among other things lustful
lewd, lecherous. It Is difficult to cis-cape i
the conclusion that the word' hottest ' as
ugpd in the song 'Dora Dean,' has an im
moral signification.
"Several Bongs were introduce in evi
dence by the complainants which appear !
to have been copyrighted, and which con- !
tain such words as 'hot stuff," 'hot,' i
"warmest," 'redhot coon, 1 and other slm- i
Nar words and nhrnses. and it is argued i
that the use of the word In the song 'Dora
Dean' is no more objectionable than the
words above, referred to In the pongs In
troduced in evidence, but the fact that
such words may be found in other pongs
does not Justify the court In upholding the
use of the word 'hottest' In the context in
which It is used In the song involved in
the case at bar. lam of the opinion that I
the word 'hottest* as used in this case 1
has an Indelicate and vulgar meaning and
that for that reason the song 'Dora Dean'
cannot be protected by copyright
"ThiP decision will "not. however, pro- |
vent the complainants fmm republfshlrv"
their song and by omitting the objection" '<
able word to securo a valid copvrieht
thereof.
"It results therefore that while the com
plainants are undoubtedly entitled to a
copyrleht for the melody of the song 'Do
ra Dean." they are not entitled to a cony- i
rlp-ht of the song with the objectionable
word in the composition. The bill will
therefore, have to be dismissed. Also the
cross bill.
Each party to the suit is required to Day
his own costs. v y
A Flug for the Police.
"Say. boys, suppose we pet a large American
flag and put over the .entrance to the station
It looks bad to see the Police Station on Cali

this time when 'the entire people. of San Fran

Lieutenant Fred Esola of the California-street

tion have a-chanca to show their patriotism

-The chance was given. at the 6 o'clock watch
and in less time than it takes to write it suffl'

A GLANCE AT
REAL ESTATE
Many Large Sales Are
Negotiated.
LA. SLY BUILDING SOLD.
SALES BY McAFEE BROTHERS
AGGREGATE $310,140.
A General Review of the Kscords,
Building Contracts, Recent
Sales and Realty
Notes.
Real estate Is still being: generally
characterized by a steady progression,
and. the universal opinion of realty brok
ers Is that prosperous times are not far
distant. . They predict that a rapid and
complete evolution from the long: existent
stagnation of the market to a business
life of animation is steadily being- under
gone, which, fact is considerably strength
ened by a comparison- of the market of
to-day and that of a month or so ago.
Every week bring its surprises. Trans
fers and sales of â¢ uncommon value are
being negotiated frequently and almost
weekly through the agency of the city
brokers, and- transactions of almost equal :
importance are being negotiated in the
country. . ' .
Large sales in real estate seem to be
come more frequent as time passes. One
of tne largest saies -Htoraeu in months
was recently negotiated by A. M. Speck
in the Interest of the Nolan estate., . and
comprised the property situated at the
junction of Market, Mason and Turk
streets. Under the then stagnant con
dition of the market the sale, which
netted JlsO.Ouu, came as a surprise to local
brokers, who welcomed it as the corn-
mencement of an era of prosperity. Tnis
immediate supposition tnat the market
would be characterized by rapid progres
sion as a natural consequence of the sale
nas been furthered by the recording of
another large transaction by the same
nrm, which seems to have a corner in
the realty business at present, to the
amount of $125,000.
The property will be sold by L. C. Sly,
the present owner. It is situated at 133
Ellis street, and consists of a lot <*) by
100, upon which is ' erected a live-story
brick building and basement.
The building, which is devoted to the
purposes of a lodging house, consists of
eighty rooms, having a monthly income
ot )500.
The purchaser of the property Is Mrs.
Charlotte F." Clark.
Another large sale was .negotiated by
A. S. Baldwin, through the efforts of Mc-
Afee Brothers, consisting of what is
known as the. Hadsell ranch, in Sunoi,
Alameda County, comprising 2332 acres of
land formerly owned and disposed -of to
Baldwin by ex-Senator Charles X: Felton.
The price, although withheld. is estimated
at about $li>o,OoO. The- property wilt in all'
probability be used for the purpose' of a
stock- farm. The new owner has also
bought -1200 acres, â¢ adjoining the ranch
from the Sunol Land and Improvement
Company, and will, in all probability in
corporate it in his new farm as a neces
sary addition for the raising of cattle.
Another sale by the same njm was also
made consisting of fifteen acres of ground
and a cottage in the San Mateo Home
stead Association by Dr. S. Whitwell to
J. X* Bonestell. The entire sale' of co'un

a dead issue and beyond resurrection. Quite
a large portion of the increase of the Bank of

made a strong bid for It when their gold re
serves got down to a low ebb by agreeing to
pay interest on all gold forwarded to the bank

only one May on record, that of 1890. when the
total clearings were as heavy as those in the
month Just closed. = . .
The clearings at 77 cities for- the month ag
gregate $5,330,000,000, a gain of 7.4 per cent over
April, of . 28 Der . cent over May a year ago,
and shows a decrease' of only 10 per cent from
the Immense record-breaking total of January
this year. Gains were heaviest- in grain -grow
ing sections and in the Middle States â  group.
The only ; group showing .a > decline is , that of

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
â¢ CHICAGO, June There was no definite
reason for a show of strength in wheat that
was . displayed .at the opening. . But scalpers
seemed to. regard a reaction as due after the
severe slump of yesterday, . and -for . awhile
there was : a â¢ moderate demand on this theory.
The news of the .day proved, so intensely bear
ish, . however, that . buyers drew . out, " and -as
soon as the demand was checked holders .of
long wheat " began ' to press It â¢ for sale. The
bears' became aggressive sellers, and it was not
â¢ long, before there was " a general demoraliza
tion. July," which closed ' yesterday at 97% c,
â¢ broke to 92c, and September from SiVJc to 79% c.
The weather for the crop . could hardly have
been better, and', stocks.- abroad are Increasing. â¢
But perhaps the' most depressing news came
from St;. Louis, .which wired that new wheat,
was coming in there freely from Texas, where
the harvesting arid threshing was .being push
ed vigorously. Liverpool cables were 7%d
: lower. â¢ With May .out .of the way. June be
! came the regulator- of c.ash prices. It opened
at $1 18 and closed at $1 OS, against $1 20 yes
: terday. â  The market became extremely weak'
neat the close, Liverpool, cables apparently be
ing ; the chief factor. " July closed .with a loss
. of September. 2Â«sc.. .
: - Unfavorable crop news .strengthened, corn at
' the â  start. The : absence of shipping demand
and the closing weakness 'in wheat undermined
the faith of the bulls and created a weak feelr
: ing, and the early advance was lost. " July.

â  Oats followed corn, July closing %c lower.
â  All the strength, shown by provisions was at
the opening. â¢ Later there was a selling move

weakness in wheat, and a marked decline re
sulted. - July pork is down 32% c, lard 10g12%6

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
. BOSTON, June I.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the Wool
market: Considering that we have had one
holiday the past week and that Satuiday as a
.half holiday is always a dull period, the market
has been fully as active since our last report
as it was the week previous.
The situation is dominated bf the West.
Growers and dealers are now at loggerheads
over the new clip, and while they are fighting
it out Wool is being shipped East on consign
ment. Wool is held very firmly in the West,
but there are not a few buyers who expect to
see Western holders weaken In their prices
eventually, and they are deferring action in
anticipation of this.
The sales of the week In Boston amount to
1,640,000 pounds- domestic and 495,000 pounds for
eign, making a total of 2,135.000 pounds, against
2,340,00*5 for the previous week and 4,782,000 for
the corresponding week last year. Sales since
January 1.- 18H8. amount to 30,483,310 pounds,
against 21,147,286 last year.

Ever since the Red Cross Society began
collecting funds for soldiers ihe school
children in this city have been foremost in
their efforta to :ii<l the cause. Of the In

baerj-'so artistic or remunerative as that
Â£i"eri by the teachers and scholars of the
(,'ltMiient Oramniar School yesterday.
F.i- a week 'ho scholars in the grammar
{dudes have worked without rest in se
i (ring donations, preparing decorations
and' in arranging the many details con
nected with the affair. That their efforts
were crowned with success was apparent
yesterday, as the crowd that filled the
beautifully decorated rooms and halls was
large, generous and appreciative..
Little flower girls moved :n and out
among the dense throng disposing or their
pretty blossoms, while pretty maids in
Japanese costumes looked after the com
fort at visitors. The scene was one of
color and gayety. The giris in their light
dresses moved hither and thither with
plaits of delicious icecream or van-col
ored, lemonade, making an animated pic
ture. ;.
An excellent programme was rendered
by the" clever pupils, and was greatly ap
preciated by ail. it was as tohows:

from Cincinnati yesterday, and though
unexpected, were looked after before jour

It is expected that 1000 Dakota volun

that generous-hearted workers will bring
these necessaries to the depot this morn

KILLED BY STRONG DRINK.

ing, Son of a Millionaire, at
the Morgue.
The body of Langford Spencer Keat
ing, the son of a millionaire father who
lives In Buffalo, N. V., lies on a Blab In
the Morgue.
Keating was sent to this city in order
that he might take the Keeley Cure for
intemperance. He obtained employment
with Baker & Hamilton, and for a time
eschewed strong drink. He lived with
Mrs. Hammersmith, 152T>y. Mission street,
but as tho liquor habit grew on him again
she was compelled to get rid of him.
May 5 he was taken to the City and
County Hospital a physical wreck, and
he died there early yesterday morning.
He stated before his death that he had
been beaten and robbed at Fourth and
Folsom streets on the afternoon of May
4. ;md yesterday Detective Graham was
detailed on the case.
The detective ascertained that on April
30 Keating, while under the influence of
liquor, fell on the corner of Sacramento
and Clay streets and fractured his nose.
He was taken to a physician's office
close by where his injured nose was at
tended to. May 4, while in a similar con
dition, he fell at Fourth and Folsom
streets and was injured on the back of
the head and body. He was not, as far
as the detective could learn, assaulted
and robbed, as he claimed.
The firm of Baker & Hamilton has
wired to Buffalo notifying Keating's
father of his death and asking for In
structions as to the disposition of the
body. The young man had a wife and
child In Buffalo.

DOWN TO BUSINESS.
Pitcher Knell Let Out â How Base
Running May Be Facili
tatedâThe Gilt Edges'
Fast Game.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Pitcher Russell-'. will have to change his
style of pitching when men are on 1 . bases.
If is very bad. form to' use a swing when
the bases, are occupied, as such tactics
enable a runner to : secure a lead which
is difficult to overcome, ho matter how
j good the catcher may 'be. There is only
one way to pitch with runners on bases
get the ball away as quickly as .possible.
Pitchers should always bear in mind that
base steals are credited to the : catcher,
and in .view [of . that fact, should â¢at ..all
times . keep a runner as closely to the
bag as circumstances will permit, at the
saiiie time pitching the ball without any
unnecessary delay. A. backstop cannot
throw men out if the: pitcher allows them
to cover half the distance between the
bases before delivering the ball, and the
regularity with which the Fresno play
ers trotted, around the cushions in last
Saturday's game against the : Oaklands
was due entirely to Mr. Kussen : sidvv
style of. pitching. Another noticeable' feat
ure, of Mr. Russell's work- ahd.'in- lact,
â¢of the majority of pitchers, is his/ability
to make balks. The rule governing this
point is very strict,, much .more so than
those employed to enforce, it. It used to
be. that a pitcher. had to. make: a dellDer-:
ate. balk, before a runner could claim a
base. Now, however, any movement by
the pitcher which tends 10 deceive the
base runner is a balk, and; as "I said be
fore...nearly every, pitcher in the league
Â£itP2 yS vu SVS V. me .move which should be
called a balk, In Justice, to the base runner
who nowadays must: be a very: fast man
to steal bases successfully. \ In the major
L e tvt U? w?t VV h ry Â«frÂ£mft3yls the same
Style, with, men on bases.' They hold the
ball against the right or. left shoulder, a!
the case may be, and without a second^

would advise the twiners to practice thii
mmmm
brfflSf L^ fact th , at PhT. has notVen
am iii g y reL> ords since joining tlie
Pitch'er'he gas & **Â«*Â»* and "fattl c
leacue In m â  â¢ any su PÂ«riÂ°rs in the
Hague. In my opinion, it would be far
to Td^ hIW FÂ° Ye for Â«Â°me manager
to gi\e him a chance In the field His
batt.ng and base-running are not to be
sneezed at, and he surely " with sufficient
?Â£f- ctic ? -wouW-'be a good playlr One
thing is certain-his knowledge of me
SffiL^i 6 me should be played adds ad-
Da ver \f f. to his , wortn as a desirable
Player. If. for no other reason than the
one mentioned above, to sign him would
not be an unprofitable investment. What
Is lacking in most of the teams is some
one who knows how plays should be con
summated In the proper manner. A man
of this sort in the San Francisco team
for Instance, would undoubtedly prove a
jewel. The players composing this club
seem to have â¢ become imbued with : the
Idea that they can win games without
playing. If this be not. the case, some
thing else of a more horrifying nature is
the trouble, and. combining their faults
with â  their- misfortunesâ call, it - misfor
tunes, but in reality it is something elseâ
a sort of concentration of efforts in the
territory known as "chest,", intermingled
with a desire to proportion one's, self- in i
thai neighborhood, when the intoxications
of. continued success 'become unbearableâ
it will be observed that there, is a lacking 1
of leadership, the kind that tells on*.' to
catch a ball with. two hands when such a
feat is possible and to refrain from per
mitting runners to score simply because
an opportunity has presented itself where
by that "chest development", may be dis
played. â: . â¢ :'â 'â¢-'â '.
Mr. 6 Hammond; in Monday's game, evi
dently considered it a waste of energy to
put two hands on a ball, when a runner
was making for the , plate, and -. conse
quently a run was presented' to "the .Ath
letics.. Bill tried to make 'a- fancy, back
hand catch, and : Bill should -know .that
such kind of work is not baseball- and that
runs win games. Mr. Murphy, tosses
a ball as though he were handing you an j
"ice cream soda," should practice throw- i
ing balls, and study the first, principle of j
baseball, which reads something like this: \
"When a batter hits a ball fair he should I
run . toward, first base, not toward â  the |
players' bench." Whether Mr." Murphy was
ignorant of this rule or not 1 cannot safe
ly state, but Mr. Murphy did hi*, a fiy
ball in the direction of first base, and
after completing this little act he delib
erately, walked In the I direction- of the
bench, the ball dropping in fair ground,
untouched. This : may be baseball accord
ing to Murphy's conception of the same,
but if Murphy imagines that people go to
Recreation Park and pay their. good mon
ey to see him play "tennis" and Rive an
imitation of how not to play the national
game ( he (Murphy) is very, much mis
taken. Now here is another â  "croq-u --i"
player, Mr. ."Hienrle" ; Krug. â â  He essayed
to pitch for- the San 1 Franciscos* in Hie
same, game in Which Messrs." "Ice Cream". j
Murphy and "Perfumed" * Hammond
played such a 1 prominent . part. When
.â¢"Hienri" stood in the box at the park was
simply one swarming mass of humanity.
But what did "Hienri" care? He /"hdd
played good ball on several occasions, arid
as Murphy and Hammond, were doing the
"chest. act" without a protest from the
"Little Market Man." why should not he
cut in? ; Who nad a better right? .After
showing how easy it â¢ was ' to - give nine
bases, on balls-, : he 1 : gracefully retired -in
favor of "Truck" Egan who, on taking up
a position near the slab, smiled contempt
uously on his cohorts and then proceeded
to prove that he could play croquet, no
matter how painful, and that ho had just j

Park on Monday , to play - ballâ they -.went '
there simply to see which had the ' b.-"St !

bet some stage money- on the game had no

LAST DAY OF
THE LEAGUE
CONVENTION
Corporation Influences Made Manifest in a
Manner Not Satisfactory to the South
ern Republicans.
Dr. Pardee of Alameda Promotes His Boom for Governor.
New Officers and National Delegates Elected.
Colonel George Stone, President.
The second and last day's session of I
the League Club convention brought
forth some surprises and was produc
tive of some results that will no doubt
be turned to account by candidates and
their friends who are,- or hope to be,
interested in the outcome of the coming
campaign. : : . . ' â >â ''':'â â  , ;â¢;
It was a day for the programmers,
and the things they did not get were j
the things they did not want. The: cor
poration influence, the strength and
purpose of which was outlined in these
columns yesterday, was brought to the
front, and with the aid it received from
an unexpected source, together with th
assistance of the vacillations of a
weak and incompetent chairman, suc
ceeded in carrying everything before
it. It was a victory of an organized
minority over an unorganized major
ity.
Incidentally, Dr. Pardee demonstrat
ed the fact that he holds control of
the delegation from the Second Con
gressional District. This enabled him
to i-or.m a junction with the program
mers and thereby affect a combination
that he hopes will prove of benefit to
him when his name is. presented to the
State convention as a nominee for Gov
â  ernor. â 
To give credit where credit iÂ« due
it must be said for the programmers
that their scheme of conquest was put '
through with scarcely a protest, though i
at one time they were forced to resort !
to "rush" tactics with the Inexperienced |
chairman in order to stop a rising mur- j
jnur of discontent among the lambs :
that were being shorn. It is not to
the discredit of the plan of their cam
paign to say that thf-ynad planned to;
depose this same chairman early in the
game, in order that he might not prove
a stumbling block to the success of the I
programme. They did depose him,
but it was not until after it became
necessary, in order to procure the \
adoption of a preliminary measure and i
shut off the awakening majority, to re
sort to bulldozing tactics.
The f?rst business that came before
the convention at the morning session j
â was the signal for the playing of the ;
first card in the corporation hand. The j
committee on order of business reported \
and recommended, among other things,
that the concluding work of the con
vention should be the election of of
ficers to serve until the holding of the
succeeding State convention. This be
ing the course usually pursued by de
liberative bodies, this item of the re
port did not attract attention Until A.
L. Levinsky of Stockton, one of the
corporation boomers, asked that the
election of officers be proceeded with as
soon as the reports of committees were i
disposed. of. Before the significance of
the move was seen Levlnsky's motion]
had been put and carried. President j
Kinney is from Los Angeles, and as i
was the aim of the programmers to
defeat the wishes of the southern del
egates it was necessary to get rid of a
presiding officer who might stand In
the way of those who wished to crip
pie the candidacy of the southern can
didate for United States Senator. . Thl
was done a few hours later by th
election of a new president, who a
once took charge of the chairman'
gravel and began to discharge the dutie
of his office. '.â ''
The greatest stroke of the corpora
tion men was the selection of the com
mittee on resolutions. The chairman
announced that the committee wouh
be composed of two members from each
of the district delegations, each dele
gation to select the members it wished
to have serve on the committee. This
resulted in the selection of the follow
ing named delegates, beginning with
the First Congressional District and
ending with the Seventh:
T. L. Crothers and D. K. McKinley, i
Grove L. Johnson and George F. Mc-
Noble, W. S. O'Brien and Thomas Feb

! majority of the members were corpor
i. atlon men tt was easy to predict the
I fate of any anti-corporation resolution.
This was made more apparent when the
committee met and Colonel de Letier of
the Sixth District appeared before it
; and presented a resolution declaring it
to be the sense of the convention that
the nominee for Governor be selected
from among the Republicans of the
northern portion of the State, and that
the candidate for United States Sen
ator be selected from among the Sbuth
|em Republicans. The resolution was i
j promptly tabled on: the .ground that it
i wag not a proper subject to be dealt
with by the convention. .
When the report of the committee
I was presented it contained.no reference
ito Colonel de l;euer's resolution. The j
j fear that it would be . presented from
the floor of the convention induced the
programmers to attempt to secure the
adoption of the report before any dis
cussion could be had. By means of
bulldozing tactics they succeeded in
forcing the chairman to help them out
and declare the report adopted, al
though at the moment there were a
dozen men on the floor demanding rec
ognition. Elwood Eiruner of Sacramen
to then moved that all resolutions of
whatever nature should first be pre
rented to the committee on resolutions
before being read to the convention.
Again the "push" resorted to browbeat
j Ing tactics, and again they succeeded
j in forcing the chairman to declare the
| motion carried before any one of the
i score of frantic delegates who wished
[ to sneak on the question could gain
recognition. ..
The surprising part of these interest
ing proceedings was the fact that the
Second Congressional District delegar
tion lent passive support to every move
of the corporation heelers. The men
from the south had counted on the
support of the Alameda delegation for
the reason that the south was willing
to stipulate that the nominee for Gov
ernor should come from the north, and
Alameda has two candidates for Gov- :
ernor in the persons of Dr. Pardee 1 and
ex-Mayor Davis. The failure of the
Alameda men to live up to what was
expected of them was due to the con
trolling hand of Dr: Pardee. It is said i
that in return for his refusal to aid the j
southern nien in the interest of an anti
corporation candidate for Senator he:
will be given whatever strength Henry
Gage may be able to command in the
State convention. . :

SOME OF THE INCIDENTS OF THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE'S
CLOSING SESSION.
Spain and the hazardous trip of the battleship
Oregon around the continent of South America
have demonstrated the military necessity foi
the existence of the Nicaragua Canal. The
Republican party of the State of California
therefore advocates and recommends that thÂ»
United States Government speedily open and
maintain a ship canal through the Isthmus of
Nicaragua, and we urge the passage by Con

desired result.

â¢ Resolved. That our organization observes

and that we endorse and heartily recommend
their works and endorse their requests to the
people generally, because of their kindness
and humane acts.
VIII.
We are not a war-making people. The acts
of peace are more suited to the great Republic
than the weapons of conflict. But In the war
that has been, after months of careful avoid
ance, forced upon our land by the wicked
tyranny that has characterized the Spaniph
dominion over Cubaâ a war waged not for con
quest, but under the dictates of the loftiest
humanity to succor the distressed, to feed the
starving, to free the victims of worse than
savage ruleâ we behold the principle of lib
erty to the oppressed that animated our fathers
in 1776 made a living reality by the people that
know Its blessings, and we pledge our loyal
and unceasing efforts to make the war a glori
ous success, asking that it shall not cease until
the valor of Sampson and Dewey and Schley
and Miles, and the soldiers and sailors of the
United States under the wise guidance of Pres
ident McKlnley shall plant the Stars ana
Stripes over the walls of Manila, Porto Rico,
and the shores of Cuba.
IX.
We feel that the present war, though It may
cost many millions of dollars and entail the
loss of many brave men. will be worth much
more than it costs by reason of the fact that
In the fires of a foreign war we have burned
all the sectional feelings of our country, and
that now one flag, the Star Spangled Banner,
floats over a country that knows no North, no
South, no East, no West.
Senator Edward I. Wolfe had another
suggestion arfd plank to offer. It came In
the form of a resolution, and he asked
that It be adopted and indorsed together
with the committee report. He asked that
the Republican party place itself on rec
Â°â¢ by adopting the following plank:
Bigotry and intolerance have no place
in this land. The Republican party has
ever defended human rights and fought
for human liberty, and to-day it reiter
ates its stanch conviction in "the princi
ples declared in the constitution â¢of the
United States and in the constitution of
the State of California, that the full ex
ercise and enjoyment of religious profes
sion arid worship without discrimination
or preference shall be forever guaran
teed. We hereby denounce any attempt
by Individuals or organizations to sow the
seeds of intolerance or to discriminate be
tween American citizens because of rea
son of faith, for it is in contravention of
the constitution, is un-American.".
Elwood Bruner moved that the resolu
tion or plank be submitted to the com
mittee on resolutions.
Wolfe said that such a course would be
satisfactory to him if a report was at
once made by the committee.
The resolution was submitted to the
committee with instructions to report at
once, and while waiting for the report
Chairman Klnn^y announced that it was
next in order to elect officers of the
league.
Colonel George Stone was nominated
anu elected president by acclamation. A.
W. Kinney of.L<os Angeles, in resigning
the chair to him. made a short address,
in which he thankea all of the league
members for the many courtesies and the
kindness shown him.
Judge J. G. Swinnerton of Stockton was
elected first vice-president and in accept
ing the office made a short but happy
speech.
E. M. Galvin of San Francisco and ,1.
B-. Bushnell of Los Angeles were placed
in nomination for socond vice-president.
Galvin withdrew before the balloting
commenced and Bushnell was subsequent
ly elected by acclamation.
Oscar Tolle of Sa,n Francisco. James M.
Oliver of Alameda, A. de la Torre of San
Francisco and Hamilton J. Rigpins were
nominated for secretary. De la Torre and
Tolle drew out of the fight and Oliver
was elected subsequently by acclamation
Riggins discovered after "the call of a
half a dozen counties that he was In the
minority and declined to continue the
fight.
The office of assistant secretary went to
Albert Lindley of Sacramento, and I. J.
Truman of San Francisco was chosen to
Berve as treasurer.
11 w Â«s decided on motion of ex-Senator
T. C. Maher to donate $50 of the conven
tion funds to the Red Cross Society.

gifted speakers in the order, gave expres

that her words expressed the sentiments
i of the audience was made manifest by the
I prolonged applause.
-- Another of those who came in for a
large share of well-deserved applause for
a meritorious performance was Miss Etta
O Brien. a young lady possessed of a I
charming voice, who sang with fine effect
that .old-time sympathetic song of the
War of the Rebellion, "Just Before the
Battle, Mother." It was a grand effort,
and was highly appreciated, as was also
her rendition of the "Star-spangled Ban
ner" at the close of the programme. -Just
prior to the singing of this soul-stirring
anthem there was a military drill by the
Buena Vista Drill Corps, composed of the
following named: Miss Annie Worth
captain; Mrs. Ella" Wehe, first sergeant;
Privates Miss Gertie Proll, Miss Gertie
Sloan, Miss Amanda Postag. Miss Addle

stedt, Miss Alice Taniere, Mrs. Josle
Parker. . "
The ladies were attired in blue skirts,
zouave jackets, white caps and red scarfs
and drilled with cadet rifles. Their march

arms they demonstrated that the fair sex
could make good soldiers.
