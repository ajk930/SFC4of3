NEW YORK. March 12.â
The Herald's correspondent
at Washington telegraphs:
Gravely apprehensive over
the impending crisis in our
relations with Spain, Presi
dent McKinley is coolly and
deliberately weighing every
phase of the situation before
making any move or any pub
lic declarations as to his in
tentions.
That his action when taken
may meet with the approval
of the nation, and of the
ta* President desires
to be relieved of any suspi
cion of prematurely forming
a decision.
While mere is ample evidence of
an unofficial character already in the
hands of the authorities to make it
conclusive in their minds that the
Maine was blown up from the out
side, the President will refrain from
making any public statement as to
the cause of the disaster until all the
papers are before him.
This is in strong contrast to the
course of Captain Peral, chairman of
the Spanish Court of Inquiry, who, in
an authorized interview published
this morning, goes into great de
tails to show that the Maine was
blown up from the inside, and in do
ing this anticipates the finding of the
court where he presides.
There has been much comment
here to-day on the extraordinary
character of Captain Peral's action in
making a public declaration in ad
vance of the official report. The ap
pearance of this interview simultane
ously with the publication of a
speech made by Senor Moret in
Madrid, and with an interview given
out by Minister Polo in Washington
last night is believed in some quar
ters here to signify a deliberate ef
fort on the part of the Spanish au
thoiities to influence public opinion
in favor of the accident theory of ex
plosion in advance of the publication
of the report of the American Court
cf Inquiry
No weight whatever will be at
tarhed to the Sp?nish repo-t by this
Goverr.ui-nt, anl when President Mc-
Kinley bpses his demand upon Spain
on the report of the Americ-iu court,
the Spanish Government in all prob
ability Will reply that the report of
its court shows an entirely uirferent
state cf affairs from that reported by
fhe American court. No om here be
lieves the Spanish court h?s made
anything like as thorough an inves
tigation as that made by thÂ» Ameri
can court. This belief will tend to
still further discredit the report of
the Spanish ecurt in this country.
The two adverse reports will bring
the two countries face to face with
each other upon a very ugly question
involving national honor on both
sides, and one that will have to be
handled very delicately if a clash is
to be avoided.
The exact course the President
will pursue in submitting his de
mands upon Spain when the report
of the Court of Inquiry has been re
ceived will, of course, depend upon
the new conditions arising from day
to day. The most that can be said
now is that the blowing up of the
Maine and general Cuban question
are to be treated as kindred subjects.
President McKinley has kept his
head up to the present time, and in
spite of all clamor he will handle the
matter in a cool and deliberate wny
Fully realizing the .horrors of war
he is determined that if there is war
the responsibility for bringing it on

An evening paper prints to
night a statement purporting
to be "semi-official," denying
that the President or his ad
visers have received any offi
cial intimation as to what the
naval court's report will be.
It is admitted, however, that
the President and individual
members of the Cabinet have
their own opinions as to what
the board's report will show,
and that "it is thought that on
these mere expressions of be
lief have been founded stories
that the administration knows
of the findings."
Ths following dispatch is sent to
| the Philadelphia Press by its staff
1 correspondent, Mr. E. J. Gibson, who
I is considered one of the most reliable
| correspondents in Washington. He
j is known to stand well with Presi
! dent McKinley. Upon his return
i from Cuba, Mr. Gibson was invited
j to the White House and had a long
interview with the President. Mr.
; Gibson telegraphs his paper as fol
lows:
"It is certain that letters came to
I the President bringing information
! from members of the Court of In
quiry, and it was this ftiformation
that brought about the extraordinary
conferences on last Sunday and Mon
day, resulting in the fifty million
! dollar emergency appropriation. It
was not until the board had practi
cally closed its inquiry and had what
i is regarded as absolute proof that the
: Maine was blown up by a mine, that
| the information was transmitted to
I the President and Secretary Long as
!to what the board would report. A
! letter from one of the officers of the
board conveyed that information,
and there were also two other letters,
I conveying like information.
"The prompt and momentous ac
tion of the Government on the re
ceipt of such information is proof
, enough of its tremendous import
ance.
"The Maine was blown up by a
mine, and the Board of Inquiry will
report that the mine was placed in
the harbor by Spanish officials.
"Confirmation of the dispatch,
printed in the Press, to the effecc
that the Maine was blown up by a
j mine, and that it was this informa
| tion which led to the conferences
I Sunday and Monday and the emer
gency appropriation by Congress, |
came to the Press correspondent to- |
' night from a very high source. An
: intimate friend of the President from
; an Eastern State, who has been in
! consultation with him, said to-night
he had talked with the President on j
! this subject, and the President had
! intimated that the probability of set
; tling the controversy with Spain
I without war was remote.
"This gentleman was told by the
President that he had had in his pos
session for nearly a week full infor
mutton of the cause which led to j
I the disaster at Havana, and that the
j circumstances were such as to render
j a peaceful settlement very difficult. :
"The President said further, ac- I
I cording to this gentleman, that both
I the War and the Navy Departments :
I were actively engaged in work which
I was intended to anticipate the worst,
i and that, while he hoped for peace,
j if the honor of the nation were in- ;
; volved, as appeared to be the case, it ;
I might be difficult to avoid war.

PARIS, March 12.â The
Temps has the following,
dated Madrid: "It is no
longer a secret that the ob
ject of the visit of Senor
Leon Castillo, Spanish Em
bassador to France, is to con
fer with foreign Ministers on
the conduct of the great
powers in regard to Spain in
the event of war with the
United States.
"The impression among Spanish
diplomatists generally is that all
the powers, in principle, are favor
able to the maintenance of Span
ish rule in Cuba and against its
independence â above all against
annexation or a protectorate on
the part of the United States. The
impression also is that England,
France and Russia will not go be
yond platonic demonstration or
friendly remonstrance with the
United States, whereas Austria
and Germany are disposed to go
further if Italy will consent, but
generally it is thought that a joint
expression of the European powers
will suffice to prevent American
aggression or intervention.
"In political circles it is not
thought Spain will allow herself
to be drawn into adherence to the
Triple Alliance, even to obtain
help on the Cuban question.
Nevertheless, the isolation of
Spain has rendered unpopular the
foreign policy which has kept her
from making European alliances
tor twenty-five years past."
The Temps also reproduced an
interview between Senor Mendez
de Vigo, Spanish Embassador at
Berlin, and the correspondent of
the Budapest Herlap. After as
serting that if the United States
did not encourage the insurgents
it allowed filibusters to leave
American ports, he adds: "It
might be even said that the United
States has already begun a block
ade of the Spanish ports, as at
Lisbon, where an American man
of-war has not been seen for years,
there are now two, and there are
four others in Spanish waters.

LONDON. March 12.â The St. James Gazette this afternoon, In an
editorial headed "Together With America." says :
The Cuban situation cannot be allowed to go on much longer. If
the Maine's destruction Is proved to have been due to an external ex
plosion it will then be shown that Spain cannot as much as keep order
in the harbor of the Cuban capital, and the United States will be jus
tified in refusing to tolerate such a condition of things any longer,
and In asking our moral support to bring it to an end. InChina.no
doubt, it is we who are chiefly concerned, but the United States has
genuine interests there, and they are identical with ours. We ask for
the open door and nothing else. Here, then, moral support may be
given for the moral support of the American Government.
It has every claim to insist upon making its voice heard. It
must needs have a seat at any conference on the Chinese question,
and we can calculate it will be found in agreement with ours.
It has hitherto been the ruling principle in American politics to
abstain from alliances with European powers, but the time for
alliances has come for the United States. They can no longer afford
to view the conflicts of the European powers as something remote
and no concern of theirs. It may be a fortunate thing for both that
this should be the case just when it is so very possible for England
and the United States to act together.
On our side there is every disposition, and we can claim to
have shown it in our acts. It is for them to take the next step.
They can now. by speaking a word in regard to China, make clear
to the world that the two Anglo-Saxon communities are prepared
to act together.

HAVANA HARBOR
DEEPENED BY
THE EXPLOSION
The Last Find of the Divers
Points More Strongly Than
Ever to an Atrocious
Crime.
Copyrighted, 189 S. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, March 12.â At the
point where the explosive force
that wrecked the Maine is be
iieved to have been primarily
exerted there is at present a
depth of water of- nearly forty
seven feet. This important fact
I \earned to-day from a source
the accuracy of which cannot be
doubted.
The significance of this dis
covery is great. The Maine, as
she lay at her moorings, drew
not more than twenty-eight or
at most twenty-nine feet amid
ships. It was well-known that
she had not more than ten feet
of water under her bottom. This
would show that the total aver
age depth of water at the point
where the Maine was anchored
was not exceeding thirty-eight
or thirty-nine feet.
Now it is found that at every point
where the bottom plates were forced up
through the other wreckage to a height
of twenty-nine feet above .their normal
position, there is a hole scooped out in
the bottom of the harbor to a depth of
from eight to ten feet below its average
level.
That this depression was originally
much greater will readily be understood
when the action of the tides on the soft
mud of the harbor's bottom and the con
sequent tendency toward filling in to a
normal depth is taken into considera
tion. This filling in process has been
going on for more than three weeks, yet
at the point mentioned there is still
found by the divers a depth of forty
seven feet prevailing through a limited
area.
What caused this depression that still
survives the action of the tides on the
muddy bottom? That is the question
divers and experts are asking. The dis
covery is generally regarded as one
more piece of evidence that the explo
sive force primarily acting on the Maine
was exerted from under the bottom and
not from within her frame. I talked last
night with a naval officer. He is an ex
pert in explosives, and one who has ex
cellent opportunities for knowing just
what the Maine investigation has de
veloped to date. He is perfectly familiar
with the construction and action of all
types of torpedoes and mines. What he
told me appears to riddle completely the
statements yesterday made by Captain
Peral, president of the Spanish Court of
Inquiry. Captain Peral is undoubtedly
sincere in all he has said. His personal
belief in the accuracy of his deductions
is not questioned. But his facilities for
learning the truth have been so inferior
to those enjoyed by American naval ex
perts through the work of their own
divers as to seriously discount his con
clusions.
Captain Peral says the Spanish divers
find no evidences whatever of any ex
terior explosion. It should be under
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
TREACHERY
WRECKED
THE MAINE.
NEW YORK, March 12.â What
is regarded in army and navy
circles as a most important edi
torial article appeared in yes
terday's issue of the Army and
Navy Register. It is as follows:
THE SITUATION.
The Register is in possession of
information, the correctness of
which I have no reason to question
in the least, that certain evidence
gathered by the Court of Inquiry
at Havana has come in semi-official
form to the President from two
prominent members of the board.
The information has been in- the
hands- of the President since Sun
day and has served as the occasion
for unusual activity during the
present week.
The information is to the effect
that the M*ine was destroyed
by a Government submarine mine
planted in Havana harbor and de
liberately exploded. More than
this, it appears that the Maine was
purposely moored in the vicinity of
the mine and that the explosion
occurred at a moment when the
ship had been opportunely carried
by wind and tide directly over the
mipe.
These facts have been hinted at
and written about in dispatches
from Havana, Madrid and Wash
ington and among the varied state
ments made the actual conditions
have been touched upon, but noth
ing authoritative has been per
mitted to escape from the court.
That body is understood to have
completed its work, but nothing
is likely to be officially promul
gated in regard to its findings for
a week or more.
There can be but one outcome of
such a report, and preparations for
the inevitable result are being in
dustriously and indefatigably pros
ecuted. The work of the week
shows that the Government at
Washington appreciates the situa
tion and will be ready to meet what
has now ceased to be a mere emer
gency.
stood, however, that the Spanish divers
have not at any time been permitted to
work inside the ship's structure, and
their operations outside have been re
stricted to her starboard side exclusive
ly. The wrecking barge Sharp lies
moored close along the port side of the
wreck and there only American divers
are permitted to work. This is the side
of the ship to which the explosive force
is supposed to have been applied. All
the evidences showing the tremendous
thrust from the port to starboard are
on the port side, therefore, and that side
is of vital importance. On that side and
inside the wreck the most expert divers
in the American navy have been at work
for three weeks. Their operations dur
ing most of that time have been confined
to an area of not more than fifty by
twenty-five feet.
Their task was well defined It has2
been well fulfilled. It is not strange that
they have found more important evi
dence than their Spanish colleagues,
who, moreover, began work many days
later. Captain Peral insists that all the
available evidence tends tv prove there
was no column of water heaved uo
ward. such as should accompany any
explosion of a submarine mine or tor
pedn.
My naval friend is disposed to admit
there was not, but he is familiar with
the action of submarine explosions, and
he tells me that while a mine capable
of destroying the Maine, if submerged
to a depth of ten feet, would probably
spout a column of water ioo feet in the
air, one placed thirty-five feet below the
surface would ciuse little more super
ficial cii^turbarce than a slight upheaval
or bubbling of the water.
Compared with the facilities enjoyed
by those conducting the American in
vestigation, the Spanish divers have
been at great disadvantage in other re
spects. They have no accurate knowl
edge whatever of the intricacies of the
Maine's construction. They know noth
ing of the numbering of her several
frames or the details of her plates. Our
naval divers, on the other hand, have
had ready at hand the most perfect de
tails and drawings that could be fur
nished by the Construction Bureau of
the Navy Department, and the expert
guidance of men most familiar by actual
experience with all parts of the ship.
Again Captain Peral lays stress on
the united testimony of fishermen that
no dead fish have been found floating
in the harbor since the explosion. His
argument is that any heavy explosion
under water would have killed the fish
in large numbers.
The American divers, to a man, have
remarked that there are no live fish
either in the harbor, at least in the
neighborhood of where the Maine went
down. This is so unusual as to have
been a matter of open comment among
them. While doing submarine work in
the vicinity of Key West or Tortugas
they were surrounded by fish which
swarmed about them in thousands. It
is a well-known fact that the dead bodies
still under water have not been preyed
upon by fish, and all the divers agree
that they have riot seen any.
Havana fishermen find their catches
outside of Morro Castle. As one of
them remarked to me: "No self-re
specting fish would care to swim in the
dirty waters of the inner bay."
The naval authority whom I have
been quoting consented, at my request,
to give me his personal theory as to
how the Maine was blown up. It should
be understood distinctly it is not as
serted that this is the theory held by the
Naval Court of Inquiry, though it is not
unlikely to be so. There is a well-known
type of submarine mine, very powerful
in execution, a specimen of which may
be seen in Newport, R. 1., at the tor
pedo station. Oddly enough, of the
three men chiefly instrumental in its de
velopment, one is Lieutenant Holman.
senior lieutenant of the Maine, who
narrowly escaped with his life, while an
other is Commander Converse, now
here in command of the cruiser Mont
gomery. The third is Lieutenant-Com
mander McLean, now in charge of the,
Newport torpedo station. This deadly
device consists of two main sections.
The lower one is a mine. It contains,
in four chambers, equally distributed.
144 pounds of gun cotton, wet and dry,
combined in proper proportion to se
cure the greatest execution. This mine
is connected by wires with a floating or
partially submerged device, the features
of which are a projecting lever or trig
ger, which, on coming in contact with
an obstruction, acts upon a set of stiff
springs, which in turn release a ham
mer, connect the circuit and explode the
gun cotton in the mine attached below.
Such a device as this is hardly more
bulky than ah ordinary domestic wash
boiler. It could readily be carried to
its destination in a small "boat and then
put overboard, the proper depth having
first been ascertained by a simple con
trivance attached to it, like an ordinary
sounding line. The lever or trigger
would then remain harmless until the
natural swing of a ship completed the
contact, when the mechanism would act
promptly on the detonators and the en
tire charge would be exploded. This, in
brief, is my informant's theory of how
the Maine was blown up.
The idea of any mine connected by
wire with a shore firing station is gen
erally believed to be untenable, and in
well informed circles there is a growing
disposition to abandon the theory that
the Maine was deliberately moored in
a position previously mined for the pur
pose of her destruction. No mere irre
sponsible miscreant, however, would
have been capable either of construct
ing, procuring or operating such an in
fernal machine as is believed to have
destroyed the Maine, and iust here is
one of the knotty points in the problem
for those who desire to eliminate the
element of direct or indirect Spanish re
sponsibility for the disaster.
The officers and crew on board the
cruiser Montgomery are unusually vigi
lant, especially after nightfall, but in this
particular their neighbors on the Span
ish cruisers, the Vizcaya and Oquendo,
are not one whit behind them. Small
boats plying in the harbor must keep at
a respectful distance after daylight from
the Yankee ship and from the big Span
ish men-of-war. One of the Mont
gomery's officers tells me that in all his
experience lie has never seen on a
Spanish war vessel such vigilance and
activity as now prevails on the big black
fighters just astern of our cruiser. AH
day long these Spaniards are swinging
their turrets and handling their guns.
All night long they are watchful, alert
and suspicious, almost as if they were in
a hostile rather than a loyal port.

THE OREGON TO
GO SOUTHWARD
Valparaiso the Destina
tion of the Battle-
Ship.
Could Be Dispatched Thence
Around the Horn to
Cuba.
War Department to Let an Enormous
Order for Snot and
Shell.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, jMarch 12.
The sending of the Oregon, now at
Mait- Island, away from San Francisco
is an exhibition <f the farsightedness
with which the Secretary of the Navy
is observing the situation of to-day.
The vessel's orders are to cruise down
the Pacific Coast, touching from time
to time at various ports where cabte
connection exists to receive any orders
that the department may have to give.
In this way it is expected that she will
work as far south as Valparaiso, Chile,
where she will await orders.,
Valparaiso is very much nearer Cuba
and to Admiral Sicard's fleet than is
Mare Island, while if it should be de
sired to send the ship to the Asiatic
station, this can be done almost as
conveniently from Vulparaiso as from
San Francisco. At Valparaiso the Or
egon will be where she can be most
usefully manipulated in case of an
emergency.
The Nashville arrived at Key West
to-day, while the Marblehead arrived
at Tampa. The naval officials will
not state the purpose of the Marble
head's visit to Tampa.
The war talk has had the usual re
sult of bringing before the War anl
Navy departments a perfect flood of
suggestions and inventions. Many of
these are most remarkable, dealing with
balloons, flying machines, kites and
the like, centipede-like steamers with
manifold propellers and torpedoes of
fearful and wonderful construction. All
of them are given attention, and are
offered to the proppr authorities for in
vestigation, but not much is expected
from them.
The War I>epartment will on Mon
day open bids for one of the largest
orders of shot and shell for heavy cal
iber guns ever given, including armor
piercing projectiles and deck-piercing
torpedo shells. The number and char
acter of these follows: Nine hundred
and thirty-nine 12-inch deck-piercing
shells, weighing 1000 pounds each; 1241
12-inch deck-pifrcing shells, weighing
800 pounds each: 481 10-inch armnr
piercing, shot capped: 149 8-inch armor- :
piercing shells: 150 8-inch armor-pierc
ing, sheet capped.
These projectiles are for the heavy
fortification guns now mounted along
the coast. The purchase is not to be
made under the fifty million defense
appropriation bill, but is in anticipation
of the fortification bill, which grants
$940,000 for a reserve, supply of projec
tiles and powder. As the making of
the heavy projectiles will take consid
erable time, the contract will be let
ahead of the passage of the bill, as
surances having been given from men
in Congress that no question would be
raised as to the regularity of this pro
ceeding. The entire amount is de- :
signed to give all the heavy guns now
installed, and those to be put into place
during the coming year, a full quota of
projectiles and powder.
The 12-inch shot are among the larg
est made. The cost of a single round
of this class of projectiles is $511. Aside
from the large order to" be placed on
Monday, the emergency bill will permit
additional orders to meet the require
ments of suoh fortification gur.s as
may be mounted for emergency. The
present order is for 'he actual netde of
the guns now mounted, without refer
ence to any existing emergency, al
though it has been made all the more
imperative by the Spanish crisis.
The Oregon, steaming at the rate of
ten knots an hour, would be able to run
from this city around the Horn to Key
West in eighty-one days. She would be
compelled to coal at least three times
cm the trip. It is an open question
whether it would, be altogether safe to
take a battleship of the Oregon's sise
through the narrow channels of the
straits of Magellan, although an ex
ceedingly rough passage of 800 miles
might be avoided by the cut off. â¢
Should war with Spain be declared
before the Oregon arrives at Valpa
raiso, the authorities of Chile would be
called on to determine whether coal is
contraband of war. Should the deci
sion be in the affirmative the battleship
could only receive a supply sufficient
to enable her to steam to the nearest
home port, which is San Franrisco.
Should the question arise while the ship
was applying for coal at some port on
the Atlantic, the ruling might be that
Key West was the nearest home port.
Spain may have some good cruisers
and several armored ships of modern
type, but there is no vessel in the Span
ish navy that is the equal of the Ore
gon. In fact, .the United States battle
ship Indiana, which is frequently men
tioned as the "pride of the American
navy," is not quite up to the Oregon's
standard.
There is some talk in the navy that
Lieutenant Commander Carlin may go
to the Oregon as executive officer.
With Captain McCormick in command,
Carlin as executive officer and Nichol
son as navigator, the Oregon in a bat
tle would add luster to the annals of
the navy. A Spanish man-of-war
looking for a brush need o-nly come
within easy range of the Oregon's 13
inch rifles to be accommodated.
There wag great bustle and. activity
upon the big battleship yesterday
morning. Three or four scows, laden
with coal and ammunition, lay along
side and all hands were busily at work
transferring their contents to the
depths of the ship. Aft sailors -were
laboriously hoisting heavy shells, one
by one. whilst forward the atmosphere
was thick with coal dust. White
painted ships, from a picturesque point
of view, are very effective, but when it
comes to coaling up sailors would de
cidedly prefer the somber, unattractive
black. The beautiful white-painted
sides of the ironclad were streaked with

HEAVY SLUMP
IN STOCKS ON
WALL STREET
Belief That War Is Near Results
in a Stampede to Sell
Holdings.
NEW YORK, March 12.â Undor the pressure of heavy liquidations
stocks to-day experienced the heaviest break that has occurred during
the present war scare. The total sales for the short two hours' ses
sion were about 325,000 shares, which, at the same rate, would make
800,000 shares for an ordinary day's session of five hours. The ex
treme decline was from 2to 5 points. Prices dropped away at a live
ly rate at the start, under what appeared to be a bear attack, but
soon It was evident that quite general liquidation had set in. There
was a preponderating sentiment among a large class of traders that
in view of an early decision in regard to the cause of the Maine dis
aster and the military preparations, it would be a good idea to be out
of stocks. This sentiment was encouraged by many commission
houses, which advised their customers not to buy before the situa
tion cleared.
The attitude of London and Paris toward our securities also con
tributed to the uneasiness, for it is assumed in the street that lead
ing banking interests abroad are kept fully advised in regard to the
situation, and their operations in American stocks will be governed ac
cordingly. Hence a very weak London market, such as there was to
day, was the opposite of encouraging to traders on this side, and, in
fluenced by a variety of more or less grounded rumors, a state of de
moralization was developed.
Accordingly, as the session advanced prices melted away at a rapid
rate. St. Paul broke 4% points from 89 to 85%, Burlington 3% from
89& to 86%, Rock Island 2& to 80%, and Northwest 4% to 113%. Man
hattan, which was in a measure influenced by the rapid transit de^
cision, dropped 4% to 94%, and Metropolitan street railway 3% to 135.
Louisville and Nashville lost 3%, touching 46; Reading, common, %,
touching 15 7 / 8 ; Reading, first preferred, 2%, touching 36; Missouri Pa
cific declined 2% to 22. and Pullman Palace Car Company 6^4 to 165.
Sugar lost 2%, selling down to 120^ and closing at 121%.
There was a slight rally in some of the specialties, but interna
tional issues, as a rule, closed at about the lowest. There were sharper
declines In bonds than have occurred on any day except during the
first slump, immediately after the Maine disaster. Atchison and Un
ion Pacific issues were the most active. The new 4 per cent Govern
ment bonds of 1925 lost IVi per cent, the lowest sales being at 121%.
Final bids were at a decline of 1 per cent compared with Friday's
close.
Among the stories that were circulated was one that the Montgom
ery had been blown up in Havana harbor, and another that Germany
had decided to oppose intervention in Cuban affairs by this country.
Again, the story that Spain had secured a loan of $60,000,000 from the
Rothschilds received some credence, but it was denied later and the de
nial had a quieting effect.
captain replied, "but I am not going to
admit that I have received any orders
from Washington. In my official posi
tion I cannot say anything. But what
ever the orders we cannot sail just yet.
There is all the ammunition and coal to
be taken on board, and all the prepara
tions to be made for sea. It would be
a week or more before we could get
away in any case."
In the ward room the officers are
quite as inconveniently situated as the
captain. The hatchway in the center
of the floor is open and through it one
can look far down into the after maga
zine, where the ammunition is being
stowed.
On deck the sailors were rolling the
great shells along towaFd the maga
zine hatch. "They are the daisies." re
marked the petty officer in charge of
the operations proudly. "With these
we can smash anything which comes
within range."
They are certainly ugly looking cus
tomers, these great steel projectiles.
The muzzles of the two thirteen-lnch
guns in the after turret are close by,
pointing upward and looking anxious
to receive the shells. No armor in ex
istence could withstand the impact of
these missiles at close quarters. Each
one weighs 1250 pounds and contains a
bursting charge of Â«.?xty pounds of
powder. Placed upright beside a man
they will reach nearly to his shoulder.
The Oregon has to take on board one
hundred of these shells for each of her
big guns, or four hundred in all. That
makes over two hundred tons dead
weight, to say nothing of the ammuni
tion for the eight eight-inch and four
six-inch guns, and many smaller weap
ons with which this tremendous fight
ing machine is equipped. It is no easy
matter to get a vesse! of this size ready
for sea, and though leave has been
stopped and all hands are working
their hardest, it will be some days bo
fore the barges will leave the side of
the Oregon, before her decks will be
washed clean and her paint restored to
Its pristine whiteness. Then she will
be ready to meet the foe and to do
whatever Uncle Sam may direct.

Seamen of the Fern Generously
Contribute Their Dinner to the
Sufferers.
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
MATANZAS, March 12.â Fifty tons
of previsions, medicines and clothing
were brought to this city to-day to re
lieve the sick reconcentrados. The sup
plies came in two cargoes from the
United States, the Fern bringing thirty
five tons from Key West, and the bal
ance coming on the British tramp
steamer Bergen from New York. Both
consignments were discharged this af- ;
ternoon, but are held under customs in-
KPectton. They will be released the
first of the week and disposed of sub
ject to the order of Consul Brice, who
already has done much to relieve the
suffering in this city.
Clara Barton, representing the Red
Cross, and Louis Klopsech of the Chris
tian Herald, came down on the morn
ing train from Havana to investigate
the condition of those for whom the
goods are provided. Several members
of Congress and a delegation of Amer
ican residents of Havana accompanied j
Miss Barton to this city and a formal
call was made upon Governor Don
Francisco Annas y Cespedes, who fms
himself contributed liberally to the sup
port of the reconcentrados. Gover
nor Annas announced himself in sym
pathy with the work of the Red Cross
and promised co-operation.
The presence of so many Americans
soon became known to the reconcen
trados, who fairly mobbed Hotel Lou
vre. The visitors? were assured by th*
Governor that conditions had much im
proved of late and while there was still
much suffering, all the inhabitants
would again be self-supporting after
the close of the next rainy season.
The supplies brought in to-day con
sist of flour, corn meal, potatoes,
smoked meats and clothing. More than
this, nearly a ton of quinine was land
ed. This will be freely distributed
among those in need of it, but great
precaution will be taken to see that it
does not reach the insurgents. The
Fern concluded discharging her stores ;
this evening and at once proceeded to
Sagua La Grande, where supplies will
be landed to-morrow. Captain Covvles
will take the Fern back to Key West .
on Monday.
An incident of the day must not go
without mention, it showing the ma
terial of which the sailors of the navy
are made. The crew of the Fern learned
that supplies would not be available
for several days, and in the meantime
many ashore were hungry. The result
was that no dinner was served aboard
the Fern, permission being obtained to
take the food to the reconcentrados.
Captain I'owlos would not cheapen the
deed by serving a second dinner, but
the crew will lose nothing by the sacri
fice.
Doctor Hubbell of the Red Cross So
ciety will remain in Matanzas over
Sunday, consulting with Consul Bric~
as to the best method of distributing

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Nervous, Weak, Tired
The fatigue from overtaxed nerves
is more intense, more depressing and
more disastrous than anything known
to tired muscles. The greatest suffer-
ers from this condition are women,
who are apt to receive criticism where
they should have sympathy. Their
condition is not due to perversity, but
has its origin in serious malady The
cause is found in the fact that the blood
is impure and in its impoverished con-
dition cannot supply the nerves with
proper nourishment, which is needed
to make thc>tn strong.
The remedy for weak nerves is found
in Hood's Sarsaparilla, because it pur-
ifies, vitalizes, and enriches the blood,
giving it power to build up the broken-
down nervous system, strengthen the
muscles, cure all blood diseases, and
give health and vigor to the whole
body. Special attention is invited to the
following:
"I am much pleased to recommend
Hood's Sarsaparilla as the best medi-
cine for the blood and exhausted

One of the Nation's New Battle-Ships

Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 12.
The Naval Committee of the House
did not reach any conclusion to-day
relative to the number and location of
the dry docks to be authorized in the
naval appropriation bill, which is the
main question left open. The general
opinion in the committee seems tofavor
three of four new docks. The Bunce
Board recommended new docks at
Portsmouth, N. H., Boston, Algiers,
La., and Mare Island, Cal., and an en
largement of the dock at League
Island, so that it will accommodate
the largest battle-ships. The Pennsyl
vania delegation is straining every
nerve to secure an entirely new dock
at League Island.
Docks capable of accommodating
battle-ships would have to have a
depth of channel leading to them of
thirty feet, and Commodore Matthews,
of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, who
was summoned before the committee
to-day, rather startled the committee
by his statements as to the depth of
the channel to at least one of the pro
posed docksâ that at Mare Island, Cal.
He said the channel was not over twen
ty feet deep for two miles, and that it
would require $200,000 to dredge it to
the requisite depth of thirty feet.
The channel at Boston is only twen
ty-seven feet deep, and the channel at
League Island is about the same depth.
This complicates affairs more or less
considerably, and when the committee
adjourned to-day little progress toward
a conclusion had been made.
The committee has decided that one
of the three battleships it decided to
authorize yesterday shall be built on
the Pacific Coast. These great war
vessels, which are to be the peers of
any afloat, are to cost 53, 000,000 each,
instead of $2,000,000, as reported yester
day.
Chief Engineer Melville appeared be
fore the committee to-day, and urgent
ly recommended an increase of 100 In
the engineer officers of the navy. He
said such an increase was imperative
ly necessary. These additional engi
neers, if authorized, would have to be
appointed from civil life.
Representatives Russell, Hill and
Sperry of Connecticut were before the
committee to oppose the recommenda
tion of the Ordnance Bureau for the es
tablishment of a Government cartridge
factory. The bureau recommended an
appropriation of $50,000 for this pur
pose. The business of making car
tridges is a large industry in Connecti
cut and Rhode Island, and the repre
sentatives from those States opposed
the provision for a Government factory
as a menace to their own industries.

The War Department to-day promul
i gated its order creating the Depart
ments of the Gulf and of the Lakes,
and abolishing the Departments of the
Missouri and of Texas. The Depart
1 ment of the East will embody the
j States on the Atlantic Coast, Including
j North Carolina. The Department of

I Atlanta.
General Brooke â¢will command the
j Department of the Lakes, and Brlga-
I dier General Graham the Department
: of the Gulf.
The Western States included in the
Department of the Dakota have been
transferred to the Department of the
Platte, while, to maintain the present
proportions of this department, the
northern sections have been throw-n
into the Department of the Dakota. No
changes have been made in the De
partment of the Columbia, the Depart
ment of California or the Department
of the Colorado.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., March 12.â
The official order of the Secretary of
War creating a military department of
the South and abolishing the head
quarters of the Department of Texas
here, was received this morning by
I Brigadier-General William Montrose
Graham, who, by virtue of the order,
j becomes commander of the new depart
ment, with headquarters at Atlanta,
Ga. The order created a great stir.
It is the general opinion in military
circles that the change will be perma
nent. General Graham said to-day:
â¢â¢This change was spoken of during
General Bliss' time as commander of
the department. While Ido not under
take to give a reason for the changÂ«
I am inclined to believe it is merely a
i redistribution of the territory of the
j department. The Department of the
! Atlantic formerly covered the vast area
from Maine to Louisiana. The Gulf
I States have now been merged with the
I Department of Texas into the new de
i partment just created.
"The change will have no bearing on
| this post. Department headquarters
; and garrison are two different matters.
Fort Sam Houston had no more rela
tion to headquarters than did Fort
i Bliss or any other post. Fort Sam
i Houston will be the same as it ever
was, only the staff officers and clerks
are leaving. This post will stilS. be In
my department, and I shall visii* it as
I do other posts on the customary tourÂ«
of inspection."
General Graham said that there had
been no orders issued involving move
ments of garrisons in this State. The
Light Battery has settled down to an
nual target practice near Kerrville, and
the cavalry is now in the midst of its
regular pistol practice at the range near
Salida. The new order of things cre
ates great enthusiasm at Fort Sam
Houston, and while the officers gener
ally speak guardedly concerning it the
I profound sensation which the news ere-
I ated tells plainly what every man reads
in the instructions. General Graham
and his staff will leave on Monday
night for Atlanta. The orders gave
but three days in which to pack up.
It is pointed out that things could
scarcely be put through in quicker
time if hostilities had actually begun.
The creation of the new department
and the departure of the commander
and the chief quartermaster within
three days are somewhat of a record
! breaker in army movements in times
jof peace. ____________^__
WERE PLANTING MINES
IN HAVANA HARBOR.
NEWPORT NEWS. Va., March 12.â
According to Captain Greenmayer of
the steamship Castilla, from New Or
leans to Hamburg, which is now coal
ing here, there is a network of mines
in Havana harbor. Three years ago,
he says, his vessel was about to steam
into the harbor, when he was signaled
not to enter. A pilot boarded the ship,
and explained that the engineers were
planting mines, and that it would be
necessary for him to wait several
hours before proceeding into port.
Captain Greenmayer was thenmasterof
the Albino. He was at one time in the
German army.
I Sarsaparilla had been to others who
were afflicted with rheumatism, I re-
sorted to this medicine. After taking
half a bottle of Hood's Sarsaparilla and
using a few of Hood's Pills, I was able
ito get up out of bed. In a short time
I regained the use of my legs and was
able to walk. My nervous, stomach
and kidney troubles were also bene-
fited by Hood's Sarsaparilla and I now
feel like a new woman. When ab-
scesses broke out on my body I re-
sorted again to Hood's Sarsaparilla,
which purified my blood, built me up
i and strengthened my system in many
respects. I owe my present good health
|to Hood's Sarsaparilla and Hood's
| Pills.
Before Taking Hood's

| I sleep soundly, and feel rested in the

If I eat a hearty meal I take one of
the pills, and it prevents all distress."

BELIEVES WAR IS NEAR.
Spain Too Proud to Accede to the
Demands This Government
May Make.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 12.â A diplomat,
Who probably is the recipient of more
confidences than any other man in Lon
don, has expressed himself as follows
on the Cuban question:
â¢If America had designed with a set
rurpnse the events of the past weeks,
she could not by any possibility have
developed anything which in its im
pressive dignity would have had such
an effect upon Europe as the way in
which the executive. Congress and the
people have met the crisis and risen
to the responsibilities involved in deal
ing with the Cuban question."
Such is Undoubtedly the general feel
ing. Every one here now recognizes
that the United States does not desire
war. but is actuated by humanitarian
sentiments, and will not shrink from
war if it is necessary to right the
wrongs of Cuba and exact satisfaction
from Spain.
In the course of a long article, the
.â !â¢ . ntressed the opinion that the
$50, .000 appropriation for the national
defense really makes for peace, "al
though there is always danger, incident
to the possession of war material, that
the country, assisted by the new school,
of which Captain Mahan is the proph
et, may be tempted to use the weapons
â  ught." The Speaker adds:
"In the face of a possible deficit, a
bank crisis and the suspension of the
revival of industry, the United States
has deliberately shown the world that
it will not be trifled with. The Spanish
patriots would do well to heed the
warning. If they try to retain Cuba by;
force, their failure is certain, and they
\\IU )inr<sly less certainly bring down
the *-f*tt>r}e -of the Citrvernment in
Spalvi." '''"*
On the other hand, the Spectator, al
though contending that preparation is
generally the surest way of avoiding
war, thinks that the proposition does
not hold good in the case of the United
States, and says:
"The circumstances steadily tending
toward intervention in Cuba will not
be altered by any amount of prepara
tion, because Spain cannot end the re
bellion and will not grant independ
ence, and thus comply with the Ameri
can demands."
Therefore the Spectator is of the opin
ion "that the Americans will frankly and
reluctantly conclude that Spain must
to reign in Cuba, and will take
naval and military action ere long."
The Spectator concludes: "Quoting
Kipling, 'the Americans are irresolute
Cull '>f doubts up to the point when
th^y wake the drumming guns that
have no doubts. After that there is
no more irresolution till the last shot is
fired. 1 "
The newspapers here generally regard
favorably the Madrid Nacional's prop
osition that the United States annex
< 'Ã¼ba and assume her debt. They
think it cheaper to buy than to ac
quire by war, but they all recognize
the improbability of the Spanish Gov
ernment daring to consent.
The feeling in the money market is
that if war is inevitable, much gold
â will probably go to New Tork, and
money, therefore, will become dearer.
The markets are uneasy at the danger
that a larger amount of gold may be
â withdrawn from the Bank of England,

Kelly, on duty at New York, as in

gineer A. F. Nixon, and the naval
constructor, J. G. Tawrezy, and Lieu
tenant Nathan Sargent, recorder.
Under the plan drawn up as the re
sult of the conferences held by Assist
ant Secretary Roosevelt and bureau
chiefs of the Navy Department, it is
proposed that the Rogers board shall
first select a large number of steam
yachts and tugs, which will be imme
diately co-nverted into torpedo boats
and rams.
Following the selection and conver
sion of these boats it is intended to pick
out twelve of the best ocean liners, be
ginning with ships of the American
line, and to take those which are best
adapted for conversion into auxiliary
steamers by reason of their coal carry
ing capacity, protection, etc. Plans
will be perfected for converting these
vessels into cruisers, and the board will
make arrangements for either charter
ing or buying the vessels from their
owners. It is appreciated by the au
thorities that in time of peace the law
prohibits the taking of vessels except
upon the payment to their owners of
"the fair actual value of the same at
time of taking," and it is for this rea
son that the board will be instructed to
enter into negotiations with the owners
looking to the chartering of vessels to
the Government. The cost of a vessel
of the St. Louis type will be. it is esti
mated, about $2,000,000, which would
cut a large hole in the naval defense
appropriation made by Congress, but
it is believed the American line will
agree to charter its ships to the United
States at a reasonable price, reimburse
ment to be made in case of their de
struction.
It can be stated authoritatively that
the department will not take all the
vessels which may be offered. In order
to influence the department in the se
lection of ships owners of vessels have
visited the department, accompanied
by Senators and Representatives.

slightest attention to politics in the
matter of providing additional defenses
for the country," said an official to me
this? afternoon. "What he wants is the
best ships that can he obtained â ships
that are the speediest, the best pro
tected, stanchly built, and with their
engines as much as possible below the
water line. The fact that a ship-owner
requires a member of Congress to im
press upon the department the value of
his vessel shows conclusively that he
fears to trust it to the judgment of a
capable board, and that it must be un
suited for Government work."
The tugs which will be selected by
the board for duty as rams must com
ply with this specification: To be
suitable as rams, tugs should be es
pecially heavy in construction, particu
larly forward; should have a speed of
not less than twelve knots, a displace
ment of nojt less than 250 tons, and
shou]d be capable of mounting at least
two five-pounder rapid-fire guns, one
forward and one aft. The tugs must
be of iron or steel and in a thorough
state of repair.
All steam yachts desired will be di
vided into these three classes:
First classâ To be capable of main
taining a speed of not less than eigh
teen knots at sea, in ordinary weather,
for two consecutive hours, with all
weights on board and of mounting two
Whitehead torpedo tubes, long or
short, and not less than two 6-pounder
rapid-fire guns.
Second class â To be able of maintain
ing a speed of from fourteen to eight
een knots in ordinary weather, with
weights on board, and of mounting at
least one Whitehead torpedo tube, long
or short, and one 1-pounder rapid-fire
gun.
Torpedo launchesâ To be capable of
maintaining a speed of from nine to
fourteen knots in smooth weather and
of mounting one Howell or Whitehead
torpedo tube and one 1-pounder gun.
It is understood that the board will
at once purchase or charter steam col
liers, which will be employed to trans
port coal and other supplies to the
fleet-

Fatal Adventure of Jap

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, March 12.â Four Japa
nese belonging to the Japanese Fishing
Company, having its base of opera
tions in New Monterey, were drowned
in Monterey Bay yesterday afternoon
while struggling with a large basking
shark which they had harpooned. They
were T. Yutani, G. Hamaraura, J. Oku
mura and J. Teranishi.
This quartet went out with three
other Japanese in two boats to hunt
sharks. When a mile off Seaside they
came upon a large basking shark about
40 feet long. The Japanese* had no dif
ficulty in spearing the shark, for it lay
inactive, floating upon the surface of
the water, and although it struggled
vigorously and towed the boat at a
lively rate his captors soon exhausted
him.
When all signs of life had departed
the men fastened a rope- around the
shark's body, and by means of a long
pole lashed across the two boats at
right angles they tied the boats and
th<^ shark securely together, according
to the Japanese methods. Then using
both boats as one they started to tow
this valuable prize ashore.
Suddenly the shark awoke from its
stupor, and dove about twenty feet into
the water, taking the boats and men
with it. The shark arose with empty
boats in tow. It repeated its dive
twice more, cm the third time breaking
the r.ope that fastened it and escaping.
One boat was reduced to splinters, but
the other, being comparatively whole,
was taken by two of the men, who
paddled with their hands through the
heavy surf to Seaside, and from there
were driven last night to Monterey.
The other of the three survivors, a pro
fessional diver and swimmer, attempt
ed to swim ashore, but the terrific surf
and extreme coldness of the -water
nearly proved fatal. He reached the
beach, and. becoming unconscious from
exhaustion, knew nothing more until
picked up by residents of Seaside about
7 o"clock and brought to Monterey. He
it was who gave the account of the dis
aster.
Search parties set out immediately to
find the other four men or their bodies.
Two of the men were seen by their
comrades to drown, and the other two
were last seen clinging to pieces of the
broken boat. Three bodies were recov
ered this evening.
AUBURN'S COMING ELECTION.
Numerous Candidates for the Several

AUBURN, March 12.â Auburn is on the
eve of a municipal election. The present
members of the Town Council are: J. \V.
Morgan, president; W. A. Freeman, W.
F. Wildman. E. C. Snowden and E.
Wooldridge. The marshal is A. S. Waldo;
clerk, E. F. Wright, and treasurer, T. J.
Nichols.
The terms of Morgan, Freeman and
Wildman will soon expire, and they are
candidates to succeed themselves. J. M.
Fulweiler also is mentioned as a possible
candidate. For clerk there are four can
didates, Messrs. L. E. Wallace, A. R. Ta
bor, L. E. Tebbs and J. B. Meredith. The
first three are lawyers, it having been
the practice heretofore to elect an attor
ney for clerk and then make him ex-offi
cio city counselor. For marshal there
are two candidates, A. S. Waldo and E.
A. Conrov. For treasurer there is but
one. A. L. Smith. All candidates are
nominated by petition, and there never
has been and is not now any politics con
nected with the race for town offices. Ef
ficiency and popularity are the only
requisites. The election will occur next
month.

MYSTERY OF A TRAGEDY.
Jew Who Supplied Papers in the
Zola Trial Found Hanging
by the Neck.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, March 12.â The appeal to the
Supreme Court by Zola against the
judgment of the court which con
demned him to a year's imprisonment
will be taken soonâ in a week, without
doubt. The general opinion is that the
appeal will be quashed, for unless it is
absolutely and legally necessary every
thing will be done to avoid a reopening
of the affair at least before the elec
tions.
Much more interest attaches to the
case of former Colonel Picquart, who
after having wounded Colonel Henry
in a duel, refused to send second? to
Major Esterhazy, by whom he had
been insulted. The seconds of the lat- I
ter insist on the formation of a court j
â¢if honor, presided over by a general
and composed of six judges named and
appointed jointly by the two principals*,
so as to decide whether or not Colonel
Picquart can refuse reparation at the
hands of an officer who has been twice
acquitted, who still wears a uniform, j
and, consequently, who has not been j
disqualified, so far as the usual rules
relating to affairs of honor are con
cerned. The point is discussed with
considerable spirit by a number of per
sons particularly competent to speak
of dueling matters. They say that Col- J
onel Picquart's personal opinion of Ks
terhazy, or even his own conviction,
cannot be brought into question as re- j
gards an adversary whom his brother
officers consider still worthy of wear- ,
ing military stripes, and consequently j
a tribunal d'honneur would be obliged
to give its decision from this point of j
view. If Colonel Picquart refuses this
arbitration he will find himself con
fronted by Major Esterhazys seconds
or insulted publicly by the latter, to
which he cannot be indifferent. The
affair has, therefore, become serious,
and if a duel results from the proceed
ings you may count upon a pretty live
ly one.
The other affair of moment is of a
more mysterious character. It concerns
a suicide â a man found hanging to the
fastening of a window in a furnished
house.
The identification of the bodyâestab
lished wtth difficulty, after a series of
investigations which brought out a
half dozen names by which the suicide
was known â seems to show that he was
a private detective who at the time of
the Zola trial sold different papers con
nected with the affair, some authentic
and some false, upon which certain evi
dence was based. The dead man was a
Jew, named Kehmann, who, under a
supposititious name wanted to sell se
crets to M. Reinach first and then to
M. Rochefort. These spurious docu
ments were destined to raise a scandal
in the Zola trial, otherwise they would
have shed unexpected light. The man
was, perhaps, only a simple adven
turer, who was spurred on by poverty,
but the mysterious circumstances of his
death, certain visits which he received
shortly before his death, the precau
tions which were taken to conceal his
idÂ°ntity afterward â all these present a
momentous chapter in the novel to
which an article lately written by Mme.
Severlne, the well known lady journal
ist, has added sensational interest.
This writer declares openly that the
man of the Rue de Seveies was not a
suicide, but had been assassinated.
When summoned on Wednesday by
the Judge conducting the inquiry to
explain this statement Mme. Severine
refused to take oath or answer any
question, but she pretends to have in
her hands elements of truth of this
gruesome story, and she says she will
speak out soon and unmask the real
culprit.
HAYTI AND SAN DOMINGO

Frontier to Check an
Invasion.
Copyrighted. 189S, by .Tamps Gordon Bennett.
JAMAICA, March 12.â Advices from the
Herald's correspondent in Port-au-Prince,
Hayti, to-day state that a breach be
tween Hayti and San Domingo is expect
ed as the result of the long-standing
frontier dispute. President Heureautx of
San Domingo is apparently determined
upon war and is making preparations for
the conflict. President Sam of Hayti, it
is reported, went tC Jacmet on March 8,
accompanied by 2000 troops. The object
of this move was to prevent any invasion
from Hayti*
SLASHES AT HIS JUGULAR.
SAN JOSE, March 12.â G. Tamburini.an
Italian laborer from Redwood City, at
tempted suicide in a room in the Roman
Hotel on North Market street at about 4
o'clock this morning. The man tried to
cut his throat with the little blade of a
pocket-knife. He inflicted an ugly wound,
but the blade broke. Removing the
broken blade from his neck, he opened
the big blade of the knife and attempted
to finish the job. He cut deep into the
wound, and twisted the blade as if boring
with an auger. He failed to cut the jugu
lar vein, however, and the chances are
that he will recover. The unusual noise
attracted the inmates of the house, and
Tamburini was disarmed.
Tamburini came yesterday to San Jose
from Redwood City, where he has a wife
and child. He was around town with
friends last evening, and was slightly in
toxicated when he retired. He has given
no explanation of his act.

TULARE, March 12.â F. Rosenthal,
Chief of the Tulare Fire Company J"or so
many years, has resigned. Mr. Rosenthal
has desired for some time to be released,
but the boys, who are much attached to

He has served the company faithruny,
and the members were loth to give him
up; but when it was known that he had
determined to lay aside the honor the
company reluctantly accepted his resig
nation. Henry Whaley is the new chief,
Just elected to nil the vacancy.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
SCHOONER
NOMAD LONG
OVERDUE
Believed to Have Gone
Down With All on
Board.
Not Heard of Since She
Left Shanghai Early
in December.
Should Have Arrived on Puget
Sound About Six Weeks
Ago,
WAS HER MAIDEN VOYAGE
Captain McAllep Accompanied on
the Trip by His Daughter and
Two Sons.,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 12.â There is a
strong probability that the schooner
Nomad is among the many vessels that
lie at the bottom of the Pacific. If
this be true, all on board met an un
timely end. The Nomad sailed from
Tacoma in September last for Shang
hai, with a cargo of lumber. It is re
ported that she covered the distance in
sixty days, and arrived at her port
without mishap. It was her maiden
voyage, and she sailed on her return to
Puget Sound on December 7 last. As
far as is known, she has not been seen
since by mortal man. According to the
reckoning of those who know her cap
abilities fcrr making time, the schooner
ie now six weeks overdue.
The master of the Nomad was Cap
tain J. W. McAllep of Seattle, who is
known everywhere on Puget Sound as
a veteran and skillful navigator. With
the captain were his daughter and two
sons. His wife had expected to accom
pany him, but was prevented by ill
ness.
In the latter part of December Mrs.
McAllep received a letter from her hus
band at Shanghai. It stated that he
would leave that port fur Seattle on
December 6. When February was ush
ered in and there was no news of the
Nomad, the wife and mother became
quite anxious for the safety of her
loved ones. She is now almost frantic
with grief, and has almost given up
hope of ever again seeing the absent
ones.
Captain McAllep was for some time
captain of the fire boat Snoqualmie at
Seattle. Previous to that he was mas
ter of the ship Detroit, employed in
the coasting trade bet-ween this port
and San Francisco. Later he assumed
command of the steamship Chilkat.
On 6 of the sons, George H. McAllep,
was 24 years old when he shipped on
the Nomad as ship's carpenter. He
had formerly acted as purser of the
Chilkat. Weston, the other son, was
22 years old and shipped as a seaman.
The daughter. Miss Helen, was about
25 years of age. The names of those
forming the crew are not known.
The Nomad was a four- masted ves
sel, built at Port Blakeley by the Hal!
Brothers last year. She was launched
in the early summer of 1897. She was
a handsome ship, built on graceful
lines and as stanch and seaworthy as
any vessel of her kind afloat on the
Pacific. She expected to return with
ballast from Shanghai.
Some few shipping men here who
have been interviewed by The Call
correspondent hold to the opinion that
the Nomad may not be lost. It is pos
sible, they say, that she has met with
some mishap that might cause a delay
in her arrival. If she Jias been partly
disabled and driven from her course
by some terrible storm her non-arrival
might easily be explained. The gen
eral opinion, however, in view of her
long delay and not having been sighted
is that the Nomad with all on board
has been lost.
SUCCESSFUL BENCH SHOW.
Dogs and Poultry That Won Prizes
at Santa Barbara.
SANTA BARBARA, March 12.â The dog
and poultry show closed to-night and has
been pronounced the most successful ever
held in Southern California. It is said
to have been better than the show at
Sacramento. The hall has been packed
by visitors during the four days' exhibi
tion. Dogs received more attention than
poultry, especially from the women.
H. T. Payne of San Francisco read a
paper on dogs; G. H. C. Goodwin, on
poultry in the orchard and on the farm;
V. Tressler. thoroughbred poultry; E. W.
Hadley of Santa Barbara, architecture of
poultry house: Professed Woodbridge,
food for egg production. The prize-win
ners among the dog class are:
S. Tyler, Pasadena, first prize, Great
Danes.
C. G. Saxe, San Francisco, open, dogs,
Defender, fox terrier, firs* prize.
Mrs. C. G. Saxe. San Francisco, St. Ber
nard, King Menelik, first prize.
F. U. Little. Santa Barbara, pointer
bitch. Kents Queen, first prize.
X. P. Shell, Santa Barbara, Jet, winner
special for best cocker.
Miss Tillie Lorraine, Los Angeles, St.
Bernard, Omar Khyyam, first prize.
J. C. Salter. Santa Barbara, Luke 11,
pointer, special first prize.
Miss C. M. Noble, Santa Barbara, Car
los, Irish setter, first prize.
Mrs. O. T. Fitzpatrick, Satiooy, award
ed first prize for bitch and litter of bull
dogs.
Mrs. Richard Nye, Santa Barbara,
Spitz, open, dogs. Rover, first and sec
ond prizes.
Although there are some fine fowls on
exhibition there is no mention made in
the catalogue of them, the public and
management devoting all attention to
the canines. There are some rare speci
mens of the Plymouth Rock breed, from
S. Tyler & Son, Pasadena; black Lang
spans exhibited by M. H. Ingham and
white Leghorns by H. C. Draver, some of
which took first prizes. Mrs. H. A. Hol
lister of Santa Barbara wins first prize
for brown Leghorns.
The show has been productive of much
good and a second exhibition next year
will bring a greater number of exhibitors
and more strangers to Santa Barbara.

BITTEN BY A SPIDER.
Henry Martin of San Jose Will Prob-
ably Lose His Life.
SAN JOSE, March 12.â Henry Martin,
a saloon porter, is suffering from blood
poisoning caused by the bite of a small
black spider, and his life Is despaired of.
About a week ago he was bitten upon the
left elbow by a spider, and inside of an
hour the arm began to swell. The pain
became so severe that a few days ago
Martin went to the County Hospital
Blood poisoning of a severe nature has
set in, the arm is swollen to immense
proportions up to the shoulder and the
flesh is perfectly black. It seems im
possible to check the spreading of the
poison through the system, and even
though the arm be amputated, it is feared
that death will result.
HONOR THE
MEMORY OF
WILLIAM I
Germans Mourn at
the Grave of the
Warrior.
Military Veterans Hold
a Memorial Cele
bration.
Imperial Mausoleum Hidden
by Beautiful Floral
Offerings.
THE WEEK AT BERLIN.
Naval Bill May Not Pass the Reich
stag in Its Present
Shape.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, March 12.â The decennial of
William I was generally commemorat
ed at Berlin on Wednesday. On the
national monument were innumerable
wreaths, many ladies and children de
positing floral offerings. The room in
which the Emperor died and the door
leading to it were draped in mourning,
and the imperial mausoleum at Char
krttenburg was decorated with wreaths,
one of which was sent by the officials
of the United States Embassy.
Emperor William visited the mauso
leum on Wednesday, and prayed both
there and at the bedside of the de
ceased, at William I's palace. The mil
itary veterans held a memorial cele
bration at the Emperor William Mt
morial Church, which was attended by
the Emperor and 120 general officers.
There were 110 flags around the altar.
Pastor Koehler delivered the funeral
oration. Most of the German princes
and rulers sent wreaths, both to the
monument and to the grave. A bou
quet of violets was placed in the cor
ner window of the palace on Unter der
Linden, where William I appeared daily
at noon.
The fact that Count Herbert Bis
marck and his wife were the guests of
Emperor William on Sunday has led to
rumors of his return to public life,
probably as Embassador to St. Peters
burg. The correspondent is assured,
however, that while His Majesty of
fered Count Herbert a position "in
conformity with his ambition," the
count declined, saying he did not de
sire t<r h>>ld office in Germany while his
father was alive, to which the Emper
or pleasantly replied that he could "ap
preciate the sentiment," and the matter
was dropped.
The Minister of the Interior has pro
hibited the public demonstration on
March 18, the anniversary of the revo
lution of Berlin, including the projected i
demonstrations at the graves of the
victims in the cemetery of Friedrieh- !
sham. All demonstrations will be for- j
cibly suppressed, and the offenders will j
be arrested.
The latest developments are that it
is now uncertain whether the naval
bill will pass the Reichstag in a shape
which will satisfy the Government. The
difficulty lies in the fact that the Cen
trists insist upon incorporating in it a
provision to the effect that in case a
new tax is necessary to carry out the
scheme it will all be levied upon only
the wealthier portion of the popula
tion. The Government is unwilling to
bind itself to such a bargain, as it
might cost many votes at the coming
election.
The protests of the United States
Embassy against the unfair enforce
ment of the Bundesrath decree against
American fruit has resulted in special
instructions being issued to the Com
missioners of Customs, so that no fur
ther complaints are arriving.
The Darmstadt Technical High
School has decreed the exclusion of for
eign-born students.
United States Consul Pltcairn of
Hamburg is the butt of the German
press because of his refusal to sign
bills of lading and other documents
needed for the departure of the Ham
burg-American line steamers on Sun
days, on the ground of his religious
scruples. The Hamburg-American of
ficials and the newspapers allege it is
due to disinclination for work.
COURSING FOR THE FIESTA.
Good Day's Sport, But Not a Success
Financially.
I.OS ANGELES. March 12.â The extra
day of coursing for the benefit of the
Fiesta fund did not prove to be a success
as far as attendance was concerned, al
though the sport was up to the usual
high standard. The recent rains have
softened up the ground wonderfully and
gave the dogs a better chance to run
without hurting their feet, while as the
grass grows longer the rabbits have a
good opportunity to evade pursuit and
escape.
Nearly all the favorites were entered
and several new dogs made their debut.
In the run-offs Poker Davis beat Oak
land Belle; Ormonde beat Major Black a
bye; Kitty Scott beat Bonnie Belle;

SAFE-CRACKERS FOILED.
Sacramento's Chief of Police Frus
trates a Plot.
SACRAMENTO, March 12 âAbout two
weeks ago Chief of Police Dwyer learned
of a plot laid by ex-convicts to crack the
safe of one of the large business corpora
tions in this cilty. and he at once took
steps to render even an attempt futile.
A guard was set over the safe, and of
ficers were detailed to pick up the prison
birds as soon as they arrived. There were
five men in the plot, their names being:
"Chick" Frost, Frank Anderson, Mark
Kelly, Tom Hausensacker and "Kid"
Thomas. They were all lodged in jail and
after due warning not to return, were
"floated" out of the city by virtue of the
vagrancy act.

NOT IN FAVOR
OF A MONOPOLY
Opposition to the Bill
for a Cable to
Hawaii.
Minority of the House Com
mittee to Introduce a
Substitute.
Similar in Essential Features, Except
That No Corporation Is
Named.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House, 'j
Washington, March 12.
Representative Corliss of Michigan
to-day completed the minority report I
of the House Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce against the bill \
reported by that committee for the es
tablishment of a Pacific cable.
The original bill provided for the j
subsidy of the Pacific Cable Company !
at the rate of $100,000 for twenty years j
and for the completion of the cable to I
Honolulu by 1900 and to Japan and j
China by 1901. The substitute offered j
by Mr. Corliss and Mr. Fletcher of Mm- i
nesota also provides for a subsidy of j
not exceeding $100,000, but it eliminates ,
! the name of the corporation and has ;
a provision for advertisement by the
Postmaster General and the co-opera- !
tion of the Government of Japan.
The report indorses the proposition
for a cable, but objects to the bill .of
the majority, because it grants an ex
clusive monopoly and a subsidy of j
$2,000,000 and holds that all franchises i
should be open to competition, and j
also that another American corporation
I is ready to enter into a contract to
construct the cable.
The report says: â¢
It is well known that Japan stands
ready to grant a. like or greater subsidy
J for the construction of this cable, in ad- j
idition to the subsidy proposed in these
i measures, and it is believed that for the ,
i public good the President should be |
! clothed with power to secure the co-op
j eration of Japan for the construction and
! maintenance of this all-important public
j work, and the minority, therefore, submit
| an amendment authorizing such action,
with the expectation that such co-opera- ;
ation and competition will result in secur
ing the establishment of a cable at a i
j much less figure tnan it is proposed to I
! grant to the Pacific Cable Company by
the measure submitted by the majority
] of the committee.

The most satisfactory events consider-

of the best races ever seen on the Stan- j

In the mile run, Smith 99, scratch, ,

the lines agreed on as the permanent one.
This will make the route between Stock
ton and San Francisco a fraction over
eighty-seven miles. The route decided on
calls for s"ome heavy trestling. There will
be also considerable filling In, but at no
place will the embankment be more than
ten feet high. The route from Point
Richmond east across the Contra Costa
hills to Pacheco slough was selected
some time ago. Between Pachc-Co slough
and the western end of the tules the sur
veyors are now closing their work, and
one of the three surveys made in that
locality will be selected within a few
days. Grading on the extension will be
commenced next month.
Director Payson says no time will be
lost in pushing the work west of Stock
ton, beginning late in April, if rain does
not interfere. There will be but few
curves and the grades will be reduced to
a minimum by reason of the 5700 foot
tunnel through the Contra Costa hills
and the proposed steel viaduct, 1200 feet
long, across one end of the Alhambra
Valley, in Contra Costa County.
The route chosen extends almost direct

THE COMING OF MELBfI.
REPORTS to the effect that Mine. Melba, with a
distinguished company of operatic stars, is to
make a tour of this coast will be received with
considerable gratification by San Francisco. In the
6rst place her coining will please our musical people
by reason of her excellence in opera, and in the sec
ond place it will be gratifying to the citizens gener
ally a? an evidence that San Francisco is becoming
a city of such importance that it can afford the best
of everything and is so regarded by those who have
to stake money on the venture of bringing it to us.
That Melba will be well received here goes without
saying. This city has been called a "jay town" by
many celebrities of third rate importance, but no star
of the first magnitude has ever had occasion to com
plain of our audiences. Every artist of the first rank
has found in San Francisco a reception worthy of his
merits, and, what is more, there has been gener
ally a true appreciation of his work. Mme. Melba.
therefore, has only to bring with her a company
equal to the task of fitly supporting her in order to
win a brilliant success here and make her visit what
her manager announced it to be, "a triumphal tour."'
From the very character of its population San
Francisco ought to be the most artistic city in the
world with the exception of Paris. Next to that bril
liant cap^al San Francisco contains the most cos
mopolitan population of any large city on the globe.
Its society is infused with the blended tastes and
talents of men and women representing every highly
artistic, race. English. French. German. Italian and
Spanish are all with us in numbers large enough to
exert an influence on the general culture of the city,
and among each there are persons of sufficient emi
nence and brilliance to make their racial influence an
elevating and illuminating factor in our social life.
The excellence of our local artists is an evidence
of the carefulness and talent with which music has
been studied in this city, and the liberal support
nearly always given to good musical entertainments
proves the popular delight in it. In one thing only
are we likely to fall short of according to Melba a
reception equal to her worth and our appreciation.
We have not in this city an opera-house on a scale
commensurate with the importance music holds in
our civilization. That, however, will come in due
time. This is destined to be one of the artistic centers
of the world, and every star of the magnitude
of Melba who comes to us aids in the work of edu
cating us to that standard and hastening the realiza
tion of the destiny.
THE FERRY DEPOT SCANDAL.
* I "HE story published in The Call yesterday of the
manner in which some of the most important
* contracts for work on the new ferry depot have
been manipulated constitutes a serious scandal in
volving the Commissioners to whom was entrusted
the duty of erecting the edifice. As was stated in the
story, "there is reason to believe that the State has
been deliberately cheated. Every apparent evidence
tends to show that while certain materials and work
were contracted for other materials and work have
been utilized, these being of inferior quality, but pud
for as though of the higher quality."
Evidences sufficient to raise a suspicion of bad and
dishonest practice are to be found in several depart
ments of work. The greatest single item of the kind
thus far disclosed is that of the flooring, where the
substitution of the expanded metal floor for the terra
cotta arched floor called for by the contract seems to
have netted a profit to somebody of more than
$39,500. Another job appears to have been per
petrated in the substitution of Tennessee marble for
interior finish in place of the enameled brick speci
fied in the contract. On this deal there was a rake-off
of about $13,000, and there is no evidence that the
State got it.
From these instances the manner in which the
work as a whole has been carried on may be judged.
It is not likely that the jobbers confined their job
bery to the particular parts of the work to which The
Call has directed attention. It is more reasonable to
suppose that the same kind of manipulations of con
tracts were practiced to a greater or less degree
everywhere, and that in almost all departments of the
work of construction there has been some scheme de
vised by which the State has paid for good material
and received something of an inferior quality.
The subject is one for the Grand Jury. That body
should make a thorough investigation into every con
tract let on the building and a careful examination of
the work done under it. The story is a shameful one,
but it would be more shameful still to permit to pass
unpunished such offenses as seem to have been com
mitted. The people of California have paid a
large price for the great depot now so rapidly near
\ig completion and have a right to hold in strict ac
countability all who have had charge of the work.
The Grand Jury should enter upon the investigation
it once and proceed upon the motto of Grant, "Let
ho sruilty man escape."
GOS BANKING AT 0N END.
JUDGMENT having been confessed in the suit
brought by Henry James to recover a $5 meter
deposit from the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company, it is now in order for all depositors in
the carbon monoxide banks of that. corporation and
the Pacific Gas Improvement Company to apply for
their money. The offer of the Gas and Electric Com
pany to return Mr. James' deposit is equivalent to a
confession that it never had any right to exact the
security. Such being the case, it has no right to hold
the deposits of its other customers.
Concerning the abstract justice of permitting a
corporation to exact security from its patrons for
its bills nothing need be said. A sufficient answer
to any argument that may be made in support of
such a contention is found in the Civil Code, section
629. That section declares that gas companies must
on demand supply consumers with meters. It was
evidently framed to prevent the exaction of deposits.
The privilege of getting a meter was probably es
teemed small when compared with the privilege of
laying gas pipes in the streets conferred on the cor
porations by the people.
We trust that the two companies affected by the
principle now established by Mr. James will promptly
amend their rules. It is not right that they should
compel their customers to put up a money guarantee
of their ability or willingness to pay their bills. In
deed, that is an unwarranted reflection on them. It
is desirable tTiat the gas companies should dwell in
peace with the community. Gas is a very necessary
article and people who use it are generally glad to
pay for what they consume. The companies have a
lien on any property of their customers not exempt
from execution, and there is no occasion for them
to carry on a security banking business in connection
with the manufacture of illuminating commodities.
In short, the carbon monoxide banks should retire
from the field. We sincerely hope the Gas and Elec
tric and the Pacific Gas Improvement companies will
return the money of their customers without delay.
If they do not somebody will surely make them
further trouble. Some meddlesome attorney and an
inconsiderate court may find a way to make it cost
them a good round sum for willfully violating the
law.
CINCHED fIND SIDETRACKED.
ACCORDING to the Riverside Press there were
shipped from Southern California during the
first week in March 550 standard cars of
oranges of 336 boxes each, as against 383 cars for the
same period last year and 231 cars for the first week
of March, 1896. The total shipments for the season
have been 5824 cars, as against 3845 cars last year to
March 7. and 3363 cars to March 7, 1806. There are
now 6000 boxes of foreign oranges afloat, as against
55,000 boxes on March 7, 1897.
Upon the showing of these" figures the season
should be one of unusual prosperity in the orange
producing counties. There should have been larger
profits than in the past for the average orchardist
and the aggregate revenues of the community should
have been vastly increased. The prevailing tone of
the people should be one of contentment and a spirit
of sanguine hopefulness should be everywhere ap
parent.
Unfortunately it is not so. The increase in the
crop seems to have served no other purpose than to
augment the income of the railways over which the
oranges are sent to market. The competition between
the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe, which in the
past has been of so much benefit to Southern Cali
fornia, has given way to some kind of traffic agree
ment between them and the rates charged the ship
pers of oranges are so high that scarcely any profit
remains to the producer after their payment.
The situation in the south has its counterpart in
this city. The Southern Pacific Company not only
holds up the cost of shipping California products
East, but it maintains exorbitant rates for passenger
travel and freight from the East to this city. Thus
while we ought to have received something like a
business boom from the Alaskan rush we have gained
but a comparatively small increase. The trade has
been largely carried to northern ports, and San Fran
cisco has had to make her fight for Alaskan business
not only against her natural competitors, but against
the opposition of the road that should have worked
energetically on her side.
With the southern counties cinched and San Fran
cisco sidetracked California has good reason and just
cause to complain of the manner in which her great
railway lines are conducted. It seems as if the man
agers of these roads are doing everything they can
to retard the progress of the State and are more eager
to grasp a few cents of undue revenue to-day than to
build up a trade that would bring them in dollars in
the place of cents in the future.
There can be no question of the folly of the tac
tics practiced by the monopoly. It would pay the
transcontinental roads to build up California and
promote every industry of its people. Such a course
would lead to the more rapid settlement of the State,
an increase of population, an expansion of industry
and a larger amount of business for the roads them
selves. Some spirit of perversity, however, has
dominated the minds of the monopoly managers and
they follow the policy of cinch and sidetrack with as
much keenness as if they were animated by a feeling
of hostility to the people rather than a desire to do
business.
It is a bad situation, and one whose problems are
hard to solve. The advance of the Valley Road, how
ever, gives promise that the solution will cont>Â« in
time. The competition of that road has already
broken the monopoly cinch in the San Joaquin, and
it may eventually do so for the whole State in the
traffic across the continent.
DISHONEST ADVERTISING.
NEW YORK merchants are at present engaged
in an effort to induce the Legislature of that
State to enact a law designed to protect honest
dealers and the general public from the effect of
swindling or fake advertising, which, from compara
tively small beginnings, is rapidly becoming almost
as great an evil in this country as the sale of adul
terated goods.
One style of the advertising complained of rarely
appears in legitimate newspapers. The fakers and
swindlers who resort to it are not willing to pay the
cost of such advertising even if the proprietors of the
papers would accept it. They have recourse to
a species of cheap publications common in the East
which have cunningly obtained the privilege of trans
mission through the mails as second class matter
and which for the most part are made up of these fake
advertisements.
Some of these advertisements, as one of our New
York contemporaries points out. are such transparent
humbugs that nobody would be deceived by them
except the man to whom you could sell a gold brick.
There are concerns that offer gold watches for $2 50;
that will sell diamond rings "to introduce the goods"
for $5; that have substitutes for diamonds, plated with
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
real carbon and warranted to resist abrasion, which
will be sold for 75 cents a karat; that will give a
splendidly printed set of Dickens for $3; that will
send you a whole greenhouse full of palms for a dol
lar; that will supply you with a silver soup turee"n for
$2, and so on.
A man of ordinary intelligence of course would not
be deceived by such offers as these. A law to pre
vent them would therefore be a law for the protec
tion of fools and could be justified on the precedent
of laws that punish the selling of gold bricks. The
merchants of New York go further, however, in their
demands, and ask a law to prevent another form of
false advertising, which would not be so easily sup
pressed as a cheap fake business. They complain of
deceptions which consist in offering alleged bankrupt
stocks of various kinds at a great sacrifice and at
prices far below cost when there has been no bank
ruptcy, no sacrifice and the price is all that the goods
are worth.
This phase of the issue shows that the merchants
are trying to establish honesty by law, and that they
aim at suppressing not only swindling in the goods
themselves, but false representations to induce per
sons to purchase goods worth the price asked for
them. In this respect the New Yorkers seem to have
gone too far. It is one thing to punish a man for
selling a piece of brass at the price of gold, but it
would be too much to expect a Government to pre
vent a man from selling brass at the price of brass
simply because he claimed to be doing it at a sacri
fice.
The movement is interesting as another illustra
tion of the growing tendency to seek reforms of all
kinds by means of legislation, and if the bill should
be adopted by the Legislature the working of the law
would be studied with considerable attention
throughout the Union.
MEXICAN COINAGE AND WOGES.
IN the official account of his Mexican tour Mr.
Bryan says: "Mexico is a delightful place to visit.
Travel on the main lines is as safe, as comfortable
and as cheap as in the United States."
That he did not diverge from the main lines is
quite evident from his conclusions. He found many
people there from the gold standard countries en
gaged in business of various sorts. He does not re
port finding many laboring people from this country
there, and the reason is obvious when he comes to
discuss wages. On this subject he says that wages
are better than in 1873, when the Mexican silver dol
lar was at a premium over the gold dollar. From
this the inference is plain that it is a bad thing for
labor to have silver equal to or a shade better than
gold at a ratio of 16V2 to I.
No one disputes that the Mexico of to-day is more
prosperous than the Mexico of the past. There is no
sorcery in the reason for it, and conjuring, is not
necessary to discover it. Mexico was for years the
scene of constant revolutions; her property was
raided by rapacious chiefs who competed with each
other in despoiling her industries. The rights of
person and property were insecure, and, where that
is the rule, prosperity is but little known. Beginning
with the firm administration of the great Juarez, this
spirit of violence and spoliation was gradually
checked; Diaz has long conquered it entirely, and
foreign capital has laid lines of transportation. Prop
erty, being safe, has some reason for being sought by
industry, and compared with her past Mexico has
progressed and her prosperity has improved. Mr.
Bryan attributes this not only to the silver stan
dard, but apparently to the depreciation in the value
of that standard. Mexico was a silver country before
Juarez and when Diaz became President, and if the
mere adhesion to that standard will produce the con
ditions present in Mexico they should have been
there long ago.
When he considers wages, however, he flinches, de
claring that "it is not fair to compare wages in one
country with the wages in another country without
first making allowances for differences in efficiency,
differences in climatic conditions, in habits, etc."
This, then, is a confession that the silver standard
may not be counted on to favorably affect wages,
which depend on quite other things. It will be seen
that this is squarely contradictory of his contention
that the silver standard must be credited with the
present improved conditions in Mexico. Logic
and consistency, however, have no place in Mr.
Bryan's system.
An observer who saw Mexico at the time Mr.
Biyan did. but who was not a guest of the Govern
ment and did not confine himself to the "main lines"
of travel, investigated his way to quite different con
clusions. This gentleman, Dr. Van Ness Standish,
says that he found two-thirds of the people without
shoes. He found the laborers living in huts eight or
ten feet square, with no chimney, the fire being on
a hearth in the center and the smoke ascending
through a hole in the thatch roof. In these huts
there is no floor, table, stand, bed, candle or lamp, and
at night the peon wraps his zarepa about him and
lies down in the comer to rest.
Dr. Standish at Laredo exchanged one United
States dollar for $2 15 in Mexican money. A few
days later he got $2 22 in the same exchange.
The rate of exchange is the difference between
gold and silver values, and prices go up and
down with that fluctuation. To-day you buy
an article at one price, to-morrow at an
other. Asking the reason, you are told "the rate of
exchange governs these things." That is to say,
every day's price is as much silver as represents the
actual value of the article in gold.
He says that living is high and wages low. Street
laborers get 30 cents a day. The clerk of the Ameri
can Minister hired laborers on the grounds of the
legation at yj cents a day.
It is true that the salaries of skilled men are liberal.
Railway men, bookkeepers and those in similar kinds
of employment are well paid, but Dr. Standish says
this is offset by the high price of living, whether
measured in United States or Mexican money.
We have a letter from a skilled bookkeeper em
ployed in the City of Mexico asking for a position in
California in which he says:
"I am not satisfied in this country and long to re
turn to the States. The salaries paid are liberal
enough, but it takes $2 to btiy here what costs in the
States just half that much."
Finally, if Mr. Bryan found such superior condi
tions in Mexico there would pour into that country
a great stream of immigration from here. Men
change locations and countries to better their con
ditions, and superior conditions so near at hand as
Mexico would not lie unimproved by our people.
An Idaho woman was married just as the man of
her choice was starting for the penitentiary for a
twenty-five year stay. Whether she is entitled to
congratulations, and on what ground these should be
based, is a delicate question.
Spanish papers speak of the American flag as ob
noxious. Perhaps the Spanish will get to seeing it
so much before long that this feeling of evident un
friendliness will grow to actual hostility.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
While the German Empire is a long
way from us. and its affairs not partic
ularly our concern, we have at least the
right to wonder how it permits its des
tiny to be guided by a man who bub
bles over so frankly with the symptoms
of lunacy. The Kaiser can in a meas
ure disguise his game arm, but his
game intelligence is something not
to be hidden. While he sends to jail
such subjects as may speak or write
disrespectfully of him, his course would
seem naturally more objectionable to
his subjects than to outsiders. If they
choose to endure it, when they have
the privilege of coming to America,
perhaps it is as well that a few thou
sands of them should be locked up. But
the exuberant William must not at
tempt to lay down the law for the folk
he is pleased to term "Yankee." These
do not recognize his jurisdiction nor
stand In awe of his God-given wealth
of nerve. It seems to me that Boast
ing Billy in attending to his own busi
ness would find his time amply em
ployed.
That man Waller of the Board of
Education needs sitting upon. Why he
cannot do the public the small favor
of keeping out of sight is a mystery.
He annoys the senses. When an offi
cial is under indictment for attempted
bribery and the opinion that he is guilty
finds so many enthusiastic supporters
as this community affords, it is not too
much to ask that in the name of de
cency he assume an air of modesty,
even if the genuine arcticle is absent
from his_ composition. Waller now
seeks to have new text books intro
duced in the schools. Coming so soon
after the late outrage in the same di
rection, this is perhaps as striking an
instance of cheek as has been thrust
into notice. Not long ago pupils were
obliged to load themselves with worth
less but expensive books, since thrown
aside. Now Waller wants them to re
load. If Waller had as much judgment
as a clam or the sensitiveness of a
mud turtle, he would be now in con
cealment within his shell. It is not to
be expected of him that that shame
will prompt him to resign, but the most
distant recognition of decency would
cause him to keep silent unless he had
something to propose besides a new
scheme of robbery. Were I engaged in
compiling a list of local rogues I would
turn to the Board of Education as of
fering rich material to draw from, and
first on the list of W's would be the
name of Waller.
During discussion in the House of
the war appropriation at least two gen
tlemen fell into poetry, mixing the feet
sadly as they alighted. Both tried to
quote some lines almost as familiar as
if taken from a Mother Goose melody,
and each jnade a mistake. HoTvever,
they voted better than they quoted, and
all is forgiven.
It would be a boon to this community
to observe an instance of the death of
a rich man not followed by the up
springing of a surprising widow with a
lot of brats trained to- call the lamented
"papa." In cases where the widow gets
premature and announces herself be
foVe the grave has claimed her lord and
master the period of annoyance to
which the public is subjected is merely
lengthened. As Adolph Sutro Hes in
mental darkness on the borderland, the
inevitable woman appears. Perhaps
nobody would go so far as to say that
Sutro's life has been faultless, but for
one I believe the woman hovering with
her brood awaiting his death is on the
moral plane of the buzzard, a bird of
carrion prey which has no morals at all.
As if to add to the gloom naturally
following an event so somber as the
destruction of the Maine, George Par
sons L,athrop wrote some poetry about
it. This poetry, it is safe to affirm, is
the worst the occasion produced. It
lacks every element of song save the
one of sentiment, and this is marred
by the crude form of expression. Doubt
less any writer of less renown would
not only have been refused space for it,
but would have been advised by an ed-
itor of average discernment to essay
no literary work higher than the com
pilation of daily reports from the stock
yard. One verse of the stuff I quote.
There are several others as bad:
Men of the Maine, O, men of the Maine,
Sad thouph your fate beyond words.
Still your true aouls 'mid the flre and the pain
Rose high with the wind and the birds.
I do not profess to be a literary crit
ic, but the ability to detect such rot as
this on sight is not denied to any man
on whom heaven has bestowed intelli
gence which has enabled him to mas
ter the alphabet.
Last week a man in Oakland beat his
wife so that she had him arrested.
When he appeared in court the Judge
at the tearful solicitation of the beaten,
let the prisoner go free. I think that
in doing so the Judge erred. Wife
beating is not a pastime which appeals
to gentlemen. A lady belted by the
conjugal fist may, with a fair show of
reason, deem herself wronged. But
when she appears in court to beg for
the brute who has bruised her. my
sympathy vanishes. The error of the
Judge was in not punishing the fellow
for letting the wife off with so mild a
correcting.
There are all sorts of excuses ad
vanced by people who get into the po
lice court. However, it is seldom one
more peculiar than that advanced by a
man recently arrested for assault has
come to notice. He ' admits having
"soaked in the jaw" the gentleman who
made the complaint, but has a plea
to advance in mitigation. He says the
assaulted person had an aggravating
habit of taking out a pencil and sharp
ening It when engaged in conversation,
and that it was for this he soaked him.
Whether the plea will be deemed ade
quate I do not know. I had supposed
that any male owning a pencil and a
knife had a right to whittle as often as
he wished. Of course, had the owner
of the utensils been a woman, the case
would have presented a different as
pect. It is a matter of common knowl
edge that no woman has any right to
try to whittle a pencil, and yet the ut
most violence that would be justifiable
would be the depriving her of both
pencil and knife, doing it, however,
with all possible gentleness.
Something ought to be done to the
Bret Harte of the present day in the
direction of reproof. He seems to as

some that his identity is one with that
of the Bret Harte of long ago, and
takes liberties with the work of the lat
ter. All the world knows that the orig
inal Bret Harte has passed away. He
acquired anglomania in acute form and
so perished from the field of letters,
leaving behind him a noble mosaic tab
let. Now comes the English Bret Harte,
and with vandal hand is clipping this
memorial tablet away. As an Ameri
can, proud of the work of an American,
devoted to admiration of John Oak
hurst, believing the "Outcasts of Poker
Flat" to be one of the best short stories
ever -written, I object to the modern
Harte. He ought to read the creations
of the old Harte and be ashamed. In
my humble estimation nobody since the
days when the original Harte's inspira
tion, born of the wild life of the West,
savored of its balsamic pines, vivid
with its coloring, was taking the form
of tales, each in its way almost fault
less, has there been a man who could
approach him until the peerless Kipling
was crowned king of the realm of fic
tion. Certainly the present Harte is
not in the same class of the one-time
Harte. The old Harte stands alone, as
distinct a figure as Kipling himself.
The new Harte is one of many, none
of them great. Lately I have been re
reading the familiar stories which are
recognized as classics. There was
"M'liss." Who does not remember the
delight of it. But the English Harte
has taken that story and spoiled it ut
terly. He has robbed it of beauty, of
delicacy: has shorn the climax away
and substituted an unsatisfactory finish
as crude as any amateur could have de
vised in a maiden effort and an effort
sure to be rejected on the ground of un
worth. The English Harte has no right
to despoil the work of the American
Harte. That has become the common
property of us all. He is not capable
of improving it; he should train himself
to let it alone. As well might a fresh
young art student take a master's can
vas and bedaub it, imagining that his
ruinous touch had added to its value.
A man who had seven wives, and for
the matter of that has them yet, has
from his retreat in a prison cell been
telling the less successful lover how to
woo. The Information he gives is valu
able to the student of human nature,
demonstrating what an absolute fool a
man can be and yet escape being im
mured in an asylum for idiots. The
much-married man needs to be receiv
ing advice rather than to be giving it.
Somebody ought to give him instruc
tions on the subject: How not to woo.
Last week I made a few pleasant re
marks about an Alameda minister. Ob
jection has arisen to the tenor of them.
It is not necessary to state from whom
these objections come, but if the minis
ter will promise to behave himself
hereafter I will freely promise to let
him alone. There are other topics more
to my taste.
It has been my duty recently to take
a fall out of the gas company. So far
as I am concerned, the sum involved
was trivial, but the sum belonged to
me, and the company had to acknowl
edge a readiness to surrender it. The
matter has been so thoroughly exploit
ed in the local columns that thore is
no need of reciting it here. Enough to
say that every person from whom the
monopoly has exacted in advance $5 or
any other amount has only to go to the
office and ask for his money. If he
meets with refusal he can present the
letter the company sent me, and which
was reproduced in this paper. I cer
tainly do not merit any favor above
that due any other customer.
A correspondent whose writing sug
gests the lovable and superior sex noti
fies me that the slang in this column
is objectionable. I am truly sorry to
hear it. If she has a better style of
slang to propose I shall be happy to
adopt it. As it is, I am doing the best
â¢I can. What does she expect a man to
do? Swear?
From present appearances the State
is being robbed blind by somebody who
has to do with construction of the ferry
building. According to the accounts
published, it would seem that the mon
ey placed at the disposal of the Harbor
Commission was ample, and yet with
the edifice cheapened in every way, the
cash is falling short. Where are the
sums which have been "saved" by the
cutting out of expensive detail? If
contracts were let for a certain floor
and then the floor changed so as to cost
nearly $40,000 less, who got the differ

their accounts are open to inspection.

Taking this man Sharkey as a sample
the whole lot ought to be attached to
gunnysacks filled with stones and
thrown into the bay. Sharkey, I hear,
claims to have been robbed in his latest
ring affair. As to the truth of this I
do not know, but I hope he was. That
he was in a conspiracy to rob Fitzsim
mons I never had a doubt and perhaps
he has been given a dose of his own
medicine. The only prizefighter for
whom I ever had a shade of admiration
was old John L. Sullivan and about
half the time even in his palmiest days
John deserved to be in Jail. But he
would fight and until whisky and time,
but mostly whisky, had sapped his
mighty strength he could everlastingly
wallop anything on two feet. I have
noticed that when pugilists engage in
a genuine fight, as occasionally na P
pens in a bar-room, they fling "science"
to the winds and throw cuspidores and
bung-starters. Their so-called science
is a delusion. They employ it only at
the times when there is a purse in sight
I will admit that then their trade
becomes not alone a science but an art.
To know Just when to be knocked out
so as to avoid the appearance of fak
ing requires study and practice. There
could in my estimation be only one per
fect type of prizefight. In this one prin
cipal would kill the other and be
hanged for murder; the seconds and
promoters would be sentenced for life
as accessories and the spectators fined
for the of the widows and
orphans.
An Eastern legislator has in his head
a plan for the regulation of marriage.
He might as well keep it there. Mar
riage will not be regulated. This legis
lator would have aspirants for the holy
state of nuptial felicity examined as to
mental and physical fitness, their pedi
gree subjected to scrutiny, the fact that
the grandmother on one side died of
fits and the grandfather on the other
was hanged laid before an unsympa
thetic world. This would not work.
When a man and woman make up their
minds to wed nothing short of a decree
of Providence taking the form of kill
ing one or both can more than delay
the ceremony. California has in a
modest fashion essayed to regulate the
conditions surrounding the wedding,
and Cupid, watching his arrows quiver
in the hearts of his victims, has simply
given California the laugh. If the law
forbids a union the pair go away Just
long enough to evade the law. The
Eastern legislator if really anxious to
make a record might try the invention
of some law to change the movements
of the tide, but the people determined
to be tied are beyond his reach.
THE MOVING EIFFEL, TOWER.
The Ughtning rod on the summit of the
Eiffel tower is constantly moving, de

and contraction, and has. been studied by

tion of Colonel Bassot's statements,
stated that he had carefully followed
Colonel Bassot's investigations,, which ex
tended over ten years, and that the re
sults given were perfectly exact. The
laws of the expansion and contraction of
iron by heat and cold are well known,
and the tower simply obeys the physical
law of temperature influence. In summer
the expansion .is superior to that in win
ter, and the movement reverses at night,
owing to contraction due to the cooling
down of the mass. Yet this twisting, this
torsion, in no case compromises the solid
ity of the structure, which, is absolute.

favor of the exposition suggested by
The Call, he is desirous of first ascer
taining that those appointed by him
â will serve and give all of the time and
energy requisite to make the affair one
that will not alone redound to the credit
of the State, but to the entire Pacific
SJope.
"I am In accord with the movement,"
paid Mayor Phelan yesterday, "but I
believe that the exposition should not
be had until 1901. The World's Fair
will be held in 1900 at Paris, and it
would prove a great counter attraction.
There is no special need of holding our
celebration in 1900 because that year
will mark the fiftieth anniversary of
California's admission into the sister
hood of States. The Chicago fair was
held in 1593 to commemorate the four
hundredth anniversary of the discovery
of America. That was one year late,
for Columbus made his discovery in
1492. If that event could be properly
commemorated a year later, why not
the golden wedding of California also
a year later?
"By holding an exposition in 1901,"
continued the Mayor, "we could have
a very fine exposition, taking the best
exhibits from Paris, and shipping them
from French ports direct to San Fran
cisco. The secret of the success of the
Midwinter Fair as an exposition was
the facility erf getting exhibits from
Chicago. Now, it perhaps costs less to
bring exhibits from Paris than it does
to bring them from Chicago. By bring
ing exhibits already prepared, with
beautiful installation furniture from
Paris, we might say that by deciding
upon 1901 we have a fair ready made
which will be none the less attractive
b'vause it has been at Paris. The Chi
cago Fair was so large that people
missed, as they will miss in Paris,
many of the beauties of the exhibits.
"As regards the site for a fair, I am
in favor of building the fair on the
Ocean boulevard. There it would be
unique. A use of this land could, no
doubt, be secured from the property
iwners, because it is now a barren
v aste, and wr-uld have to be reclaimed,
from the Park Commissioners. The
Commissioners could improve that end
â  f the park during the next two or three
years, so the garden effects may be had.
After the fair i-^ closed, thÂ«> region
south of the park, in the neighborhood
of t.k- â  d. will have a splendid
stimulus and development, which will
add to the taxable property of San
Francisco, and serve to bring in our
outlying districts where men can build
homes. Transportation facilities will
follow such development. There is no
city in the world that has such a beau
tiful and unique site.
"The Midwinter Fair was built with
out any city, State or national aid. Ev
ery American fair since, and including
Chicago, has had such aid. The Gov
ernment is now building a $200,000
structure at Omaha, and it was also
represented at Atlanta. Hence Con
gress could be easily induced to make
an appropriation for our fair, and the
State Legislature would, no doubt, give
it official sanction and aid, and in the
hands of a competent committee the

SOME OF THE PICTURESQUE FIGURES AT THE PAVILION.
A glittering pageant, in which g"ds
and goddesses fresh from Olympus,
knights in glittering armor, nymphs
and clowns whose pleasing antics
pleased, marked the opening of the
Verein Eintrachfs ball last evening.
The grand march was a gorgeous affair.
Promptly at 9 o'clock the clarion notes
of a bugle heralded the beginning of
the ball, and the line for the grand
march was formed. First in the line
was the committee of arrangements
which was followed by the president
and vice-president of the association,
the floor committee in rococo costume,
a herald in Lohengrin costume and a
float, representing Prince and Princess
Carnival with pages in an arbor of
flowers, drawn by six harlequins. Court
ladies, gents and jesters, nymphs and
ballet girls were next in line, and then
grate receipts would more than pay the
expenses." _

The girl lived on Washington street, near
Stockton. According to the story told by
the merchants, a notorious highbinder,
who is said to be the leader of the gang,
entered the girl's house while she was
alone and compelled her, under penalty of
being killed, to accompany him. He then
took her to the headquarters of the gang,
and subsequently, it is believed, spirited
her out of the city.
Recently at least a half-dozen Ch.nese

a reward for the arrest of the kidnapers,

BURIED UNDER
AN ELEVATOR
Fatal Accident to a Young
Man at the Pa
vilion.
Killed While Trying to "Beat"
His Way Into the
Ball.
Found by His- Companions He
Was at Once Ex
tricated.
A poorly clad young man, whose
name could not be ascertained, met
with a horrible accident last night at
the Mechanics' Pavilion. Not having
the necessary money to buy a ticket,
the unfortunate fellow, together with a
number of other young men, forced
his way into the basement. At the
southerly end of the building is a
freight elevator, and the intruders
started to climb the ropes attached to
it, in order to reach the main floor.
The unknown victim of the accident
stood close to the elevator and as it shot
upward in response to a tug on the
main rope by one of his companions, he
started to board it. The next instant
the elevator dropped, catching the
stranger in the descent. His cries at
tracted the attention of his companions
who, becoming alarmed, at once noti
fied Sergeant Nash. The latter imme
diately ran to the scene, and found
the young man buried beneath the ele
vator.
He was unconscious, and apparently
fatally hurt. After considerable trou
ble the elevator was raised, and the in
jured boy removed to the Receiving
Hospital.
A few minutes after being placed on
the operating table he breathed his
last. His body was subsequently sent
to the Morgue.
One of his companions was James
Wilson, and lives at Fourteenth and
Mission streets.
"We made our way into the base
ment," he remarked, when giving his
version of the accident, "and being un
able to reach the main floor we de
cided to try the elevator. The victim
of the accident remained a short dis
tance behind, thinking we would
meet with police interference. After
one of the boys had raised the elevator
the stranger tried to climb on to it.
Just then the elevator suddenly
dropped, burying his companion be
neath it. I was told that he was from
the Potrero, but I do not know his
name." ___________^

EAGER TO SAIL FOR ALASKA.
Washington Street Wharf Crowded With Gold- j
Seekers.
One of the most striking scenes of life and seafaring interest ever !
beheld In the city was that presented at the Washington street wharf !
yesterday when the Humboldt arrived, having made one of the quick- !
est trips on record to Skaguay and return.
The wharf has for several days presented the strange picture of
three hundred tons of freight piled almost sky high, awaiting the ar
rival of the steamer from the land of gold. There are three hundred
and fifteen passengers awaiting the opportunity of embarkation, and !
all arrangements have been made for the northbound steamer to sail !
again to-morrow, with the prospect of arriving at Skaguay in about !
nine days.
It was a unique sight to behold the strange combination of va- <
lises, sleds, trunks, boxes and packages of canvas that constituted the !
three hundred tons of freight on the wharf. Eager passengers stood I
for hours watching for the arrival of the belated steamer, and when '
she arrived there were cheers of joy from many throats. Old men and !
young men, as well as women and children of all ages, had stood for !
many hours, watching for the arrival of the steamer.
It is estimated that about 5 per cent of the passengers who will !
go to-morrow are women in search of their fortunes in the far north. '
They go with all kinds of ideas of prospects, but most of them feel !
In some strange way that the reports are only a partial statement of !
the truth pertaining to the untold wealth that is still hid in the hills ?
of the Alaska wilds awaiting the cunning researches of practical mm- '
ers and about to add to the mineral wealth of the world. !

SEATTLF, March 12.â Great interest
is manifested here and many compli
cations have arisen over the arrest of j
Joseph Schwartz, the diamond king, '
who is charged with larceny in San
Francisco. This afternoon In Justice j
Austin's court Deputy Prosecuting At- |
torney Pulton said that Governor Tlog- !
ers had been guilty of an unheard of J
proceeding in delaying a decision on i
the request of the Governor of Califor- I
nia for the surrender of Schwartz. Mr.
Fulton said that the laws of the United j
States made it the duty of the Gover- ;
nor to deliver the prisoner when requi- j
sition papers drawn in due form were j
presented to him.
This comment on the action of the \
Governor in granting a continuance j
from several days hack to Monday was
one of the interesting features of the â 
preliminary examination of the dia- ;
mond king this afternoon. The State :
did not attempt to go into the merits ]
of the case as to whether Schwartz was
actually guilty of stealing $1200 worth
of diamonds from William Wolfsohn, !
the jeweler, but established by the cvi- '
denee of Detective Edward Wren of j
San Francisco and copies of the San
Francisco Police Court records that J.
Schwartz was wanted there for the
crime of grand larceny.
Mr. Fulton then said that in view of '
the fact that the case would come up
before Governor Rogers Monday he :
would ask that the case be continued
until next Thursday.
After th* 3 Justice had decided to hold ;
the prisoner there was a long argu
ment as to whether it should be pend
ing the decision by the Governor or un
til a certain date. It was finally agreed
that the case would go over until next j
Tuesday, and if the Governor refuses j
to honor the requisition of the Gover- !
nor of California, then Schwartz may j
go where he pleases. At present
Schwartz is in the custody of a Deputy
Sheriff.
Attorney Winstock returned last i
night from San Francisco, where he .
has been in an effort to secure aff.da
vita that will give Schwartz his lib
erty. Mr. Winptoek says he has some
thing up his sleeve, but he does not ,
care to let it drop until the right time, j

The courtroom was crowded when the
case was called at 10 a. m. by Judge Ham

all on hand, and the court and attorneys
proceeded to secure the remaining three

Attorney Roll will make the opening |

for the defense. Interest in the case is
now at a high pitch, and the courtroom

for Clark will be insanity. With this plea
his attorneys hope to save his neck. The
prisoner is taking more interest in the

nished an interviewer with a column of
insulting commiserations for the "wicked

it unsafe to walk in the towns of Kansas

Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 12.â A large
party of representative citizens left
here this morning upon the invitation
of Captain John Cross to attend a cele
bration at Nordhoff. Ventura County.
The occasion was the running, of the j
first train over and opening for busi- I
ness the Ventura and Ojai Valley Rail- J
road. The party consisted of Mayor
Snyder, General Forman, president of
the Chamber of Commerce; Max Mey- j
burg of the Merchant?' and Manufac- j
turers' Association, and twenty- rive j
other prominent gentlemen. At Yen- j
tura the party was joined by a large
crowd of citizens of that place, and a
start was made over the new road.
After a trip of sixteen miles through
beautiful valleys and past unequaled
mountain scenery the train pulled into
the town of Nordhoff. in the midst of
Ojai, one of the largest and most fer
tile valleys in this part of the south, j
The guests were invited to seats in j
carriages and taken for a drive around j
the valley, winding up at Oakdale, j
where a barbecue was in full blast. |
There was much speech-making in the j
line of felicitating the citizens of Ojai ;
upon having communication with the :
outside world. The Ventura band was j
in attendance, a dancing platform had
been erected, and every thing imagin- I
able was done for the enjoyment of the ;
guests. , . i
The Ventura and Ojai Valley road is j
the enterprise of Captain John Cross
of this city, backed by a generous sub- j
sidy of citizens along the line. It runs |
from Ventura to Nordhoff, a distance
Of sixteen miles, through a magnificent
country, which it will develop and build
up On the 15th of last August work
on the construction of the road was i
begun by Grant Brothers, contractors, j
and it was completed in exactly seven
months. The road is standard gauge >
and splendidly built. \
In addition to opening up a splendid
country, this road will give easy access
to one of the most noted resorts in Cal- j
ifornia. Every summer at least 5000 ;
people have gone by wagon to Hot ;
Springs, located in Ojai, to bathe in the
health-giving waters or for good fish
ing and hunting to be found there. :
Now that the road is in operation, it is ;
expected that this number will be :
largely augmented. In the valley are
also located asphalt urn and gypsum
mines, and in the mountains are im
mense quarries of brown sandstone,
which will now find an easy way to |
market.
The building of this road marks a
new era for Ventura County, and its
citizens are correspondingly jubilant.
The road is on quite a grade, and was
most expensive to build. The officers
of the new road are: John Cross, presi- j
dent and general manager; A. P. Cross,
vice-president and superintendent, and
George Blake, general passenger and
freight agent. Captain John CTOSfI
owns a majority of stock in the road,
and has absolute control of it. Many
persons thought the road was being
built for the Southern Pacific Compa
ny, and would be turned over to that ,
corporation upon completion. This is ;
denied by Captain Cross, who says j
there is no intention <rf turning the line
over to the Southern Pacific Company
or anybody else.

NOT A POSSIBILITY.
Irish Members of Parliament on the
Attitude of England and
America.
NEW YORK, March 12.â -A dispatch to
the World from London says: The Irish
members are openly incredulous of the
possibility of any genuine rapprochement
between Great Britain and the United
States.
Mr. Davltt has put down for Monday
questions to the Ministers, avowedly de
signed to elicit replies showing that the
reports of Queen Victoria's rumored me
diation and of Sir Julian Pauncefote's
interview on the same subject with Presi
dent McKinley are baseless. Mr. Davitt's
view was expressed with character
istic force and candor to several English
members, in t-.e presence of the World's
correspondent in the House of Commons
lobby last evening.
"You imagine," he said, "that the
United States can be dragged by the Brit
ish lion's tall into your complications with
Russia, France and Jermany, forgetting
that the interests of the United tates in
the Far East are simply commercial, and
that the other powers wiu take good care
that due regard is shown to American
commercial Interests in order to give ncr
no cause for siding with you."
A MOST REMARKABLE
SURGICAL OPERATION.
Child Born With Two Heads Has One
Successfully Removed From the
Other.
SWEET SPRINGS, Mo.. March 12.â A
remarkable surgical operation was per
formed to-day on a throe-month-old
child of John Hamilton, which was born
with two heads. After a consultation
with the surgeons at the sanitarium it
was decided to remove the abnormal
head, which was located back of the nat
ural head. This was done and over three
ounces of brain matter taken out. The
abnormal growth was nearly as large as
the natural, and there was considerable
doubt among the surgeons whether the
abnormal could be removed without af
fecting the natural.
The surgeons say the child will rapidly
recover from the effects of the operation.
They also maintain there is no danger
that the child will be mentally weak as a
result of the operation, but that its life
will be saved and it will be a robust
child.

CREMATED IN
A TENEMENT
Many Lives Lost in a
Conflagration in
New York-
Number of Victims Believed to
Reach Over Two
Scores.
Dwellers on the Upper Floors Cut
Off From Escape by thÂ«
Flame*.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 13.â Many lives
were lost in a fierce fire that started
at 2 o'clock this morning in No. 105
Bowery. After the blaze was gotten
under control by the firemen, an hour
later, nearly a score of charred bodies
were found on an upper floor.
Chief Bonner, who was in charge of
the fire, conducted an investigation
when it was possible to enter the build
ing. He said he believed the dead
would probably number between thirty
and forty, and possibly more.
The building is five stories high. On
the first floor is the Bowery Mission,
and the upper floors are occupied as a
cheap lodging-house conducted by the
mission. There were two hundred men
asleep when the fire was discovered.
W. C. Robbfns, one of the lodgers,
scented the smoke, and upon investiga
tion found a seething furnace of flame
roaring in the rear.
He shouted an alarm from the front
window and a citizen passing in the
street sent in a signal from a box. Mr.
Robbing ran through the upper floor,
arousing the sleepers.
By this time the flames had gained
great headway, and the thick smoke
penetrated the entire building. The
lodgers ran into the halls in confusion
with such articles of apparel as they
could seize. Many had not time to
take their clothing, and ran to the
street in their sleeping garments.
When the firemen arrived long lad
ders were placed to the windows, and
the firemen Of Truck Company No. 9
were active in effecting rescues. All
escape by the stairs was cut off when
the firemen reached the burning build
ing, and the men were too panic-strick
en to think of the roof.
Chief Bonner said that at 3:30 o clock
seventeen bodies had been found. They
were scattered from the second (loorup.
Most of them were on the third and
fifth floors. The firemen brought the
first body out and placed it on the
sidewalk at twenty minutes past 3. As
the bodies were recovered they were
laid on the sidewalk for possible iden
tification and then sent to the Morgue.
Stevenson, a lodger, carri-'d Fitz
patrick, a blind man, who had the room
next to his, out on his back. Fltz
patrick could not understand there was
a fire, and fought haul to resist being
rescued.
While the firemen and police were
fighting with those in the hallways, a
man made his appe ranee at the win
dow on the third Boor.
He threw hi? foot out on the ledge
and hung on for a few moments to the
coping. A cn.wd had gathered in the
street, and th> y cried to him to hold on.
But the flames came out of the window
and so singed his hands that he was
forced to let go.
A cry of horror went up from the
crowd below. The man. before letting
go. threw himself outward, and as he
fell the crowd separated. He landed
just beyond the sidewalk. For a mo
ment he seemed stunned. Then he
arose to his feet, felt himself all over
and hobbled away, disappearing in the
midst of the crowd. The firemen
worked inside the building until the
heat and smoke forced them out one
by one.
The scaling ladders and the life
nets were then r.surted to. Water was
poured into the building in torrents,
but the flames seemed to increase in
fury. Many of the lodgers were car
ried down the ladders. These were in
almost in every instance rescued just
as they were about to jump to the
street from the windows on the upper
floors.
When the flames were under control
at 3 o'clock one of the firemen who had
made a tour of the entire building
emerged and reported to Chief Bonner
that he had seen at least forty dead
bodies.
His report was that he had discov
ered two bodies on the first floor, five
on the second, eight on the third,
twelve on the fourth and thirteen on
the fifth floor.
At 4:30 twenty-six bodies had been
recovered.
RED ROOM FUNCTION.
Founders of the Bohemian Club As-
semble at the Round Table.
Some twenty or more of the founders of
the Bohemian Club dined in the red room
of that Institution last evening and had a
delightful session until midnight, recall

DEFRAUDING AN INNKEEPER.
Strange Conduct of Three Miners on
Their Way to the Klondike.
Baney Chinetto, Julius Gilli and Desire
Veriarede, three miners on their way
from Australia to the Klondike, went to
a restaurant at 27 Stockton street yester
day morning and ate about V> worth of
victuals. After they had finished they
refused to pay the hill. The proprietor
called in Polieteman Prowse, and he tried
for nearly half an hour to get them to
pay up, but without success, and he took
them to the City Prison, where they were
charged with defrauding an innkeeper.
When searched Veriarede had sixty-one
English sovereigns in his pocket.
Judge Campbell happened to visit th<?
prison and Chinetto and Gilli told him
that Veriarede had asked them Into tin?
restaurant to have lunch with him. They
did not have any money with them and
expected that he would pay the bili. The
Judge released them on their own recog
nizance, and Veriarede put up $20 cash
bail.
J. B. Olsen Arraigned.
J. B. Olsen. recently stenographer of
Judge Conlan's court, appeared before
Judge Cook yesterday for arraignment.
Olsen is charged with perjury, and after
the complaint had been read he was
granted a week In which to plead.
PURSER'S BODY
FOUND AT SEA
A Relic of the 111-Fated
Steamer Clara
Nevada.
Papers in the Pockets Estab
lish Identity Beyond a
Doubt.
Clothing Burned in a Way to Indi
cate That Fire Destroyed the
Vessel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 12.â The steamer
Cottage City, which arrived from
Alaska this evening, brings newÃ of
the finding of the body of Purser
George Foster Beck of the ill-fated
steamer Clara Nevada, which came to
grief a month ago on Vanderbilt Reef.
This is the first body found, and it was
accidentally picked up by the steamer
Rustler on Sullivan Island last Tues
day.
Papers found in the" pockets gave con
' elusive evidence of it being the remains
of the unfortunate purser. After a
careful investigation of the clothing it
was discovered that a portion of his
; coat and trousers had been burned,
showing every indication of a fire being
aboard the vessel at the time of her
wreck. The body was in a perfect
I state of preservation and his features
i could be recognized by all who knew
him. The body was taken from Sulli
i van Island and conveyed to Juneau on
the Rustler, where it will be embalmed
and shipped to his home in Portland.
The Rustler left the rollovrtngr-morn
'â  ing with a number of people for the
, purpose of making a thorough search
i of Sullivan Island beach with the hope
of finding more bodies which may have
been washed ashore.
SCHEME TO CONTROL
THE KLONDIKE TRAVEL
Canada Will Extend the Teslin Lake
Railway to a British Colum
bian Port.
NEW YORK, March 12.â A dispatch to
the Commercial Advertiser from Montreal
says: The announcement made to Par
liament by Sir Wilfrid Laurier that it is
now the policy of the administration to
prepare to extend the Lake Teslin and
Stickeen Railway to a British Columbia
port next year if trouble over transship
ment arist-s at the American port of Fort
Wrangel has improved the position of the
Government. The opposition has not
ceased to attack the Mann-Mackenzie
contract, but it? most effective gun has
been silenced now. The Government ar
gues that the right to navigate the
Stickeen River, given to Canada by the
Washington treaty, implies the right to
moor and transship at the mouth of the
river.

SANTA ROSA'S
JUBILEE WEEK
Great Rose Carnival and
Pythian Celebration to
Be United.
Elaborate Arrangements for
the Opening of the Event
on May 16.
Personal Invitations to the Governor
State Officials and Other Prom
inent Citizens.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, March 12.â Arrange
ments for the great Rose Carnival and
Pythian celebration to be held in this
city during the week beginning May 16,
are rapidly nearing completion and there
is now no question but that the event will
be the most successful affair of its kind
ever held in this part of the State.
Since the programme was first given
to the press somo slight alterations have
been decided upon by the executive com
mittee, but none of any particular im
portance. The excursion to Bohemia,
near Guerneville, has been changed from
Wednesday, May 18, to Thursday, May 19.
This will necessitate changing the date
of the grand Pythian ball from Thursday
to Wednesday evening, but aside from
these slight changes the programme will
remain as previously announced for the
week.
This evening Grant O. Richards, chair
man of the invitation committee, sent out
personal invitations to Governor and Mrs.
J. H. Budd, Senator George C Perkins,
Congressmen Barham, Maguire, Hilhorn
and De Vries, State Controller and Mrs.
E. P. Colgan. Secretary of State Brown,
Attorney General Fitzgerald, members of
the Supreme Court, Mayor Phelan of San
Francisco, Mayor Thomas of Oakland,
Major General Dickinson, His Grace
Archbishop Riordan. Right Rev. Bishop
Nicholas, Hon. John D. Spreckels and
several ithers prominent on the coast,
many 01 whom have already signified
their desire to be present and take part
in the week's festivities.
All committees are hard at work, and at
the meeting held this afternoon the most
flattering reports were received from all
along the line. The entire city is enthusi
astic over the interest manifested on
every hand, and that the gallant Pythian
Knights are interested is shown by the
early inquiries for rooms and accommo
dations that have begun to come in to the
committee having those matters in
charge. â ____________

TWO PILOTS' EXPERIENCE
Tliay Come Near to Taking an In
voluntary Trip to the Islands
and the Orient.
Growing playful again the wind
picked up its heels yesterday and came
in over the city with a rush, heralding
its riotous approach with shrill whistles
and clouds of dust.
Out at the Cliff House it was blowing
a gale of fifty-two miles to the hour
when the sun rose, but this subsided to
thirty-six miles toward the middle of
the day. As evening drew near it
trilled its pipes until they sang the tune
of forty-fear miles an hour, and tho
buildings shook and rattled with the
duet of the shrieking gale and the
thunder of the surf.
The only sailing vessels which braved
the blast after the wind had gained its
greatest velocity were the pilot boats
which must cruise up and down the
b:ir, regardless of wind or weather. The
steamers Â£ealandia and Doric put to
pea during the early part of the after
noon, and the heavy seas on the bar
came near causing an involuntary trip
to the islands and the Orient for their
pilots. There are two pilots by the
name of Jordan, and for the sake of
distinction as well as for physical rea
sons one is known as '"Big" Jordan and
the other as "Little" Jordan. "Big"
Jordan was on the Zealandia and "Lit
tle" Jordan on the Doric.
When they crossed the bar the surf
was running so high that they could
not leave their charge, and they had
to pass the inside pilot boat America,
which was to have taken them back
to the city. They therefore proceed
il to the outer pilot line and there
managed to board the Bonita, but only
aftor the Bonita had lost her main and
her fore sail while maneuvering to get
them aboard.
When they arrived off Melgrgs wharf ;
"Big" Jordan deckled 'that he would
i >me a-.-hore at mice despite the sea, |
which was running in the tideway, and
&:> he got into the yawl and started to !
jmll ashore. The tide and the waves
swamped the boat, however. Just as she
was reaching the seawall, and Jordan
had to continue to the end of his jour
huey on foot, with the water up to his
9 waist. He yelled for assistance, but
even his pilot's voice was drowned in
the howling wind, SO he struggled on
over the rocks of the bulkhead until he
could make a landing.
Moiggs wharf escaped without any
damage, as did the vessels that were
tied to it, although at 7 o'clock, just
before the wind began to abate, it
looked as if the serious consequences
of Wednesday night's blow might be
repeated. So threatening was it at this
time that the schooner Lily lying at
section B of the seawall was chafing
herself in a most dangerous manner, al

though she had out extra lines. Cap
tain Bottger called for the tug Sea
Witch, and had the LUy towed out Into
the bay, where he anchored.
The schooner Sacramento, which had
tied up to section A, was also batter
ing herself heavily, and her captain
called for the services <.f the tug, but
when the Sea Witch had finished with
the L,i]y the wind and waves had abat
ed considerably, so the Sacramento re
mained at her moorings.
A small scow schooner next to the
Lily raised her foresail and cast off her
forward lines and fell out from the
wharf, and she was thus enabled to
ride easily with the help of her an
chor. The schooner Beulah was also
moored to section B. while besides the
Sacramento, the schooners Edward
Park and barkentine Monitor were tied
up to section A, but they rode the storm
ruit in safety.
In the early part of the afternoon
Weather Prophet Hammon sent tele
graphic dispatches to all parts of the
State instructing the agents of the
Weather Bureau to erect the necessary
â tonn signals as a warning to the peo
ple of the approaching gale. The chief
wharfinger of this city was notified to
warn the owners of vessels and ad
vise them to let out extra mooring
lines, and everything, in fact, was done
to prepare the city for the northwester.
"The storm at present is central over
Northern Idaho and Nevada," said
Forecast Official Hammon yesterday in
explanation of the cause, origin and
probable scope of the gale. "It is now
raging in California, Nevada and the
Pacific Coast generally, and every in
dication points that as it forces its
way farther down its velocity will in
crease, and before its force is broken
will be running at the rate of sixty
miles an hour.
"The general idea that the storm will
be the effects of causing rain is with
out foundation, as every indication is
against such a consequence, except per
hapfl the appearance of an occasional
shower.
"The storm from its central position
in Idaho and Nevada is gradually
forcing its way southward and San
Francisco can prepare itself for an in
crease in the velocity of the wind as it
comes sweeping down the interior val
leys and along the coast. A light
rair. fell throughout Eureka and Ore
gon yesterday afternoon, but was not
sufficient to produce any general effect,
as it lasted but a few moments.
"The conditions are favorable in the
northern part of the State and Nevada
for a severe snowstorm, as the barom
eter is rapidly falling, but as far as
this city is concerned we will have
nothing but high winds."
UNLOADING THE STOWAWAYS.
Two women were discovered in hiding before the vessel reached Black Point. Captain Jepsen at once stopped
the vessel, and, lowering a boat, put the women in it and sent them ashore. He had to lower them over the side of
the Puebla in a sling, and both of them were drenched before they got away from the steamer's Bide. Had the
women succeeded in getting as far as Seattle, they intended stowing away on the steamer Australia, and in that way
get to Dyea or Skaguay.
Mr. Hammon declares that this is one
of the severest wind storms the State
| has experienced for five years. Com
i munication was received from Mount
i Tamalpais late last night that the wind
was traveling over the summit at the
rate of 72 miles an hour.
At Point Reyes the velocity was 68
miles an hour, and steadily increasing.
The full force of the north wind was
! felt in the Richmond district yesterday.
I So great was the force that regular
| sand showers swept over the entire
! place. Signs and other external fas
| tenings to the houses were made to rat
tle and shake as if they were on board
j a vessel under full sail, while chimney:
j tops were twisted and turned from
i their original positions.
In Golden Gate Park trees and shrubs
were made to bend their proud heads to
the northern breeze that had made its
presence felt, but no damage was re
ported at the superintendent's office.
The animals hugged the weather fences
with an unusual tenacity. The big
grizzly bear and old Ben Harrison,
with his household of buffaloes, shook
their heads in majestic disdain at any
thing so trifling as a sixty-five mile
gale of ocean wind.
Although all possible preparation had
been made in anticipation of the ap
proaching storm, the majority of resi
dents of this city were taken by sur
prise. Hats were seen rolling over the
I cobbles with their owners performing
I all kinds of contortion feats in hot pur
j suit; women with their bonnets on one
! side and with their hair disheveled
were making their way round the cor
ners of high buildings with the latest
styles in hosiery exposed by the dis
respectful blast to the immodest gaze
of the public, and fallen sign boards
j and debris marked the course of the
: wind on every side.
The weather conditions to-day will
i be similar to those of yesterday, and .
' the storm signals can be expected to be
i seen on the flagpole of the Mills build
' ing for at least twenty-four hours
' longer.
Damage in San Pablo Bay.
SAN QUENTIN, March 12.â Assist- i
â¢ ant Lighthouse Keeper Anderson of the
lighthouse on Two Brothers Island in
San Pablo Bay was here to-day. Dur- â '
ing the heavy storm that did so much
oamage u> the San Francisco shipping
the wind played havoc at the light- i
house, wrecking all the small houses i
and destroying the. wharf. The waves ,
were the highest and the velocity of
the wind the greatest that has visited j
the station in many years. Every- j
thing was carried â¢ away except the
lighthouse and the dwelling houses.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CAI.L, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1808.
TWO WOMEN
STOWAWAYS
Were Discovered on the
Puebla Before Reach
ing Black Point.
Captain Jepsen Put Them Into
a Ship's Boat With the
Aid of a Sling.
Had They Got as Far as Seattle They
Intended Stowing Away on the
Australia.
The steamer City of Puebla went
away yesterday with the largest crowd
of passengers that has yet left San
Francisco for Puget Sound. She took
away 190 in the cabin and 296 in the
steerage. Of these over 150 are for the
Klondike, the majority of the others be
ing bound East via the Canadian Pa
cific Railway on cut-rate tickets.
All the passengers were well supplied
with freight and the steamer's deck.s
were littered with it, while aft mules,
horses and dogs were quartered. The
Puebla got away from the wharf with
two women stowaways aboard, bur
they were discovered as the vessel was
passing Black Point and Captain Jep
sen at once stopped the steamer and
landed them at Meiggs wharf. They
were Miss Jennie Gay and Miss Nellie
Terris of this city. They said they
wanted to get to Dyea and thought if
they could only get to Seattle they
could stow away cm some other steamer
and thus reach their destination. They
were well known to the sailors on the
Puebla, and called out, "Good-by,
Frank," to on&_ of the rowers who
brought them ashore.
Captain Jepsen wasted no time with
the two women: It was blowing hard
and he wanted to get outside and on
his course as quickly as possible.
When the boat was in the water and
manned the women were put into a
sling, one at a time, and lowered into
the boat. Before they got away from
the steamer's side they were soaking
wet and during the pull for the wharf
wave after wave broke over them.
They were landed on the schooner Lily
and Captain Bottger offered to allow
: them to dry themselves in the vessePs
! cabin, but they insisted on setting
ashore and went uptown on an electric
i car.
The steamer Doric got away for the
Orient yesterday, after a delay of sev
eral hours. The boilermaker and sixth
assistant engineer, who had been re
moved to Angel Island by Dr. Rosenau,
were still in quarantine, and the quar
antine officer refused to give them up.
Dr. Chalmers gave the agent of the Oc
cidental and Oriental Steamship Com
â¢ pany permission to take uff the me-
I chanics, but Rosenau at first refused
to part with them. Finally he agreed
: to put them aboard if the Doric was
moved into the stream. This was done,
and the trouble over the quarantine
was over.
The Doric had an unusually large
passenger list, and they all and their
1 baggage had to be put aboard by the
! mail company's tug. This was the
] cause of the delay, and the language
\ used by the male passengers in dis
cussing the quarantine muddle would
i not look well in print.
Among the cabin passengers on the
â  Doric was Mrs. J. M. Shotwell, widow
of the late Captain J. M. Shotwell. A
host of her friends were down to see
the lady away and wish her a pleas
ant sojourn in the land of the chrysan
themum.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Zealandia g<.-t away for Honolulu on
time. Owing to the strong northerly
wind that was blowing, Captain Dow
dell had some trouble in getting the big
, steamer away from the wharf, but
I once clear of the structure she was
' soon straightened out and went full
j speed on her course.
She carried the following passengers:
Miss Mary Allen, W. Auld, H. W. Baker
and wife, W. D. Bethel, Miss Mary
Brocks, H. C. Brown and wife, Miss H.

TO UTILIZE A
WHITE ELEPHANT
A New Departure by Messrs.
Friedlander, Gott
lob A Co.
ThÂ«y Promina Good Attractions at
Low Prices In trio
California.
Messrs. Friedlander, Gottlob & Co. have
hit upon a new plan by which it Is ex
pected to put the California Theater Into
remunerative service. The plan in simply
to put a good class of attractions on the
boards at a low figure, and at the same
time maintain the high order of the
house. A number of contracts have al
ready been plgned with leading com
panies, and the prices of seats will never
go above 50 cents. This week "Town
Topics" goes on, and it will be followed
by the famous "Old Lavender," with
many of the original players.
The newest part of the whole affair,
however. Is the engagement of a number
of high-class vaudeville companies. This
is a novelty to which San Frajiclsco
theater-goers have never before been
treated, as It has hitherto been the cus
tom to engage vaudeville artists singly,
and the result has not always been satis
factory. There are at present twenty
seven complete vaudeville companies in
this country, and Manager Friedlander
_>romiÃes that the cream of these will
show from time to time in the California
Theater. The vaudeville will not be kept
up continuously, but will be interspersed
with comdy, drama and a season of comic
opera.
Mr. Friedlander, in speaking of the
matter, eald: "Tea, we have decided
upon an entirely new departure, and we
expect to fill the California every night.
It has lain vacant altogether too long al
ready, and if we ran keep It filled by
means of a low admission price and first
class shows It will be far better than hav
ing It half-filled or lying idle altogether.
We do not Intend running any one line
of entertainments. First we will have
some first-class plays, then a little vaude
ville, and after that opera. There will be
no smoking or drinking allowed, and visi
tors will be treated with the same court
esy as In either of the other two houses."
Scenic Stationery.
A fine line of stationery has been pre
pared for the Pacific Coast market by
Mr. H. E. Westgate of 1430 Folsom
street. The paper in all sizes is sur
mounted by half-tone views of San
Francisco, embracing the Park Con
servatory and Stow Lake, the Cliff
House, Golden Gate and The Call build
ing. It is now on sale at over fifty
stores, including the Emporium, and is
already meeting a deserved popularity.
St. Patrick's Day at tlje Chutes.
The committee of arrangements having
charge of the St. Patrick's Day celebra
tion at the Chutes held a meeting last
night at Drews Hall. P. M. McGushin
presided. The other members of the com
mittee present were John H. Dolan, Dan
iel Tweedie, P. C. Morton, M. Gilmore,
William Gilheaney, James Bohan, P. Mc-
Keon and M. J. Moran. Satisfactory re
ports were received from the committees
on advertising and printing. The com
mittee on fireworks reported having
made arrangements for the following
special pieces, in addition to the ordinary
display; "Star of America"; a revolving
wheel; Irtsh and American flag's, en
twined; bust of Robert Emmet; "Union
for Erin"; "Who Fears to Speak of '98?"
The committee on talent was granted
further time. Upon the receipt of their
report the full programme of the cele
bration will be published in The Call

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
BADLY INJURED
IN A RUNAWAY
Man and Boy Miraculously Es
cape Death While Driving on
Golden Gate Avenue.
Charles Herlngham, a grocer's clerk,
employed at u.e corner of Geary and
Webster streets, and Irving Beyer, an 11
year-old boy, living with nis parents at
1703 Geary street, sustained serious in
juries in a runaway accident on Golden
Gate avenue yesterday afternoon. Hering
hnm was driving a horse attached to a
light wagon along that thoroughfare, the
boy being on the seat with him. Norse
became frightened at a piece of paper
that was blown under his feet and dasned
wildly up the street.
Herlngham, nnding himself unable to
control the animal, called to the boy to
jump for his life, and acting upon his own
advice, sprang from UiÂ« wagon. His left
foot struck the hard pavement in such a
manner as to fracture his leg and two
toes. He was picked up and carried to a
neighboring drugstore, where his injuries
were dressed, after which he was re
moved to his home at 2222 Jackson street
Young Beyer took his chances with the
runaway, and was all right until the
horse jumped a water-trough in front of
a store at the corner of Buchanan street
and plunged uown the stairs leading to
the cellar. Beyer -"was pitched headlong
down the stairs and when assistance
reached him he was found in an uncon
scious condition under the horse's feet
and bleeding profusely from a deep gash
in his forehead and another in his neck
He was taken home, and his wounds were
pronounced not dangerous.
The horse broke one of its legs and had
to be shot. It was owned by J. \V. Lipp
man, an upholsterer, having been bor
rowed by Herlngham's employer. Her
ingham had only been at work In hiÃ
present position one day.
LIKES NOT CORSON CLARK
The Actor Accused of Getting Mad
and Swearing.
MISS HEFFRON, THE INJURED ONE.
Harry Corson Clark is a brute, also a villain, likewise a tyrant, besides
being a bear, catamount, fiend, evil spirit and other things of the animal king
dom that are uncertain of temperament and unpleasant of contemplation, if
Miss Heffron, a young lady late of his company, who follows the stage, not be
cause she needs to do so, for a living, but because she has not the heart to allow
such talent as is hers to stagnate in the placid pool of common, every-day life,
is to be believed.
That Mr. Clark is insane is no longer a matter of speculation to Miss Heffron,
it has become a settled conviction. Did he not call her a "dis'organizer?" And
â¢what better evidence of insanity is needed than to have a man of high nervous
tendencies, who curses when he is mad and who is mad all the time and most
of the overtime, apply such a terrible epithet to a young lady of talent? Besides
this. Miss Heffron has other evidence to offer. It Is true that the fact that Mr.
Clark in securing her services for $20, when he could have got them for $30, did
what men whose sanity has never been questioned have done before him, but
when he looked pleas-ii at getting the laugh and sore when some one else got
it, it showed, to say the least, something In his mental make-up considerably out
of the normal.
"I am a good actress," said Miss Heffron when seen yesterday, "and have al
ways been able to get along with my managers until I was unfortunate enough
to go on with this fellow (emphasis on the fellow) Clark. I tried to do with him
what I have tried and heretofore, always succeeded In doing with all Other
managers with whom 1 have been associatedâ give satisfaction. But it was no
use; an angel from heaven could not get along with that brute.
"He is insane, I firmly believe. He started his abuse of me in San Jose and
cursed me from there t<> Portland, Or., where I finally became so nervous that I
had a stoppage of the heart, rush of blood to the head, fluttering of the pulse,
and fell down, strikinK the back of my head so hard that It took the entire com
pany, assisted by an inexpensive doctor and a priest, four hours to bring me to.
"I was confined to my bed for some days, but finally recovered enough to
travel, and, resisting the kindly advice of other members of the company, to
hit Mr. Clark with a chair when he was not looking, I got part of the money
due me from him and came down here, where I am still recovering from the
weakness occasioned by his brutality.
"I will soÂ»n be all right, however, and go on with Mr. William Gray's com
panies, in wiilcli lam promised a splendid part. 1 am sort of sorry, however,
when I think the matter over, J^jat I did not use that chair."
Funeral of John Russell.
The remains of the late John Russell,
the well-known steamboat steward, who
met with an accidental death In Seattle,
Wash., last Sunday, were brought to this
city on Thursday, and interred Friday
from the family residence, 616 Bush street.
Evidences of the popularity of tho de
ceased, who was connected with the vari
ous steamer lines of the coast for over a
quarter of a century, were visible around
the bier, which was surrounded with the
choicest blossoms of the early Bpring.
Friends from the far East and thÂ»- dis

ber of his friends here in sending these
floral tributes to his memory.
At 10 o'clock the remains were borne
to old St. Marys Church, where a solemn

DISEASED MEAT SEIZED.
Nathaniel Hubbard, a San Mateo

An Important seixure waa made by Meat

w nth, who is attached to the Board of
Ith, In Chinatown yesterday.
They had received information that dis
eased meat was being sold to Chinese
butchers in Chinatown, and yesterday
morning they seized two carcasses of cows
in the butcher shop of Quang Gee, lOl^z
"Washington alley. They had just been
delivered by Nathaniel Hubbard, a but
cnei I] San Mateo.
The officers made Hubbard place the
two carcasses on his wagon again and he
and Quang Gee were taken to the City
Prison, where a charge under the State
law of offering and having" for' sale dis
eased meal was booked against them.
The carcasses were saturated with coal
oil and wfr then sent to the fertilizing
work*. ThÂ«? iiiiwrt iimi been suffering from
rculosis in an aggra^ted form and
the glands have been kept as evidence
against the two defendants.
TO MAKE QUICKER TIME.
Through Trains Will Soon Cease to
jL Run by South San Francisco.
The old tracK of the Southern Pacific
from Baden to San Bruno is being bal
lasted ami generally repaired, and as soon
a* it is in first-class condition, through
trains will run over it instead of making
the !"np detour leading over and around
.San Francisco. The object of this
change is to give a quicker and more
comfortable service to through passen
[rom San Franrisco to San Jose and
other points alon^ the line, and to do
away with the unnecesary time consumed
In the present route taken by the through
trains which run ..y the way of South
San Francisco, when there is no necessity
of. touching there.
The two long sidings at either end of
the roail from fngleslde Junction to Ocean
View are to be run into each other, thus
making a double track for the entire dis
tance between these points, and thereby
greatly Increasing the safety of travel.
The company is also putting in a large
number of Wharton safety switches on
Ban Francisco track, with the
of taking every precaution against
::ts and reducing the probability of
ter to a minimum.

At Ingleside Park the
Favorites Carried
the Day.
Hares Were Fast, the Hounds
Ran Well and Money
Flowed.
Although a Small Crowd Was Pres
ent a Good Day's Sport
Resulted.
The weather yesterday prevented a
large crowd from gathering at the Ingle
side CourÃlngr Park, but a good day's
sport was witnessed by those present, as
the hares were unusually strong and the
hounds, although not "top notchers," ran
well. All throughout the day the Ion?
enders won with but one exception â tire
Ball. The racing- for to-day will without
doubt prove exceedingly interesting, and
it is thought some of the hounds which
will be placed on the short end will carry
off the money.
Many new dogs started at the park, but
probably owing to their condition were
not able to make much of a showing.
TeÃSle Fair, who had been drawn to #o
against Johnny it, was not on the
grounds, and the latter started against
Van Nip, as did Van Cloie, who had been
drawn with Hercules, who had beea with
drawn on account of injuries.
The fastest course of the day \v.iw oe
tween Patria and Old Glory, and, as
Piitria won the course, it is thought by
many that she will carry off the purse
for her owners to-day. It is generally
thought that I'atria, Occidental, Log
Hi>js.and Moondyne will be within the
money when the results are given by
Judge Grace.
Money was freely played by the few
bettors present. Odds were large on
many events. Moondyne sqld as good as
14 to 1 against Count of Monte CrisÂ»to, but
seemingly the money was not too large
against the Count. Log Boy sold for $10
against Reta at $1, but it is said that
Reta will surprise the talent before long,
as she has not been running for many

PROSPECTS OF THE
OCEAN CANAL
Cheering Letter From Captain
Merry, United States
Minister.
Admiral Walker's Survey â Chicago
Engineers Are Making
Estimates.
A private letter received by a well
known resident of this city from Captain
W. L. Merry, United States Minister to
Central American Republics, contains
some interesting intelligence which The
Call is permitted to publish.
Under date of San Jose. Costa Rica.
February 8, IS9S, Captain' Merry writes:
"I do not know when I shall visit Sal
vador and Nicaragua. I find San Jose
a fine little city of 25,000 inhabitants. The
legation has been received with every
mark of respect and esteem; military
bands and 'Hail Columbia" at the official
reception and military band serenades in
the evening.
"There is a railroad here to Port Li
mon. on the Atlantic, 107 miles long, with
heavy grades, through beautiful scenery.
This road throws the trade of Costa Rica
largely into New Orleans and Europe. A
railway Is now being built hence to the
Pacific, also a distance of 107 miles. It
will be completed in about two and a
half years. When this road is opened
California will control the trade of this
Section in flour, canned goods, fruits.
Wines, pickles, mining muchinery and
tinware.
"I am pleased to write that canal pros
pects are improving. The United States
Canal Commission is proceeding vigor
ously with it;; work. Admiral Walker |
hopes to make a preliminary report in j
May next, when the President will send
a special message to Congress with it and
recommend prompt action. Meanwhile
Lyman E. Cooley, civil engineer, the
leading spirit of the Chicago Drainage
Canal, with fourteen engineers and con
tractors, who have been with him on
that work, and also a geologist and bota
nist, are making a careful examination
on private account and will make a bid
for the construction to the company.
"I have known Mr. Cooley for some
years. He is cautious, conservative and
the greatest living expert on canal con
struction. I shall have great confidence
in h!s report and cost estimate, which will
probably be smaller than that of the
United States Commission, being based
on a commercial status, while you know
Government engineers always estimate
and build on the same lines as a young
man with a rich father. But a few" mill
ions more or less will make no difference
with the American people who need the
canal and can afford to pay an honest
price for it."

F. Marion Crawford, the celebrated
author, has arranged to deliver a series
of lectures at the California Theater, be
pinnlng Monday evening, -/larch 28.
The subject of the first lecture will be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 189 S.
A VERY CAUSTIC CRITIC
One Actor Who Dislikes the Way Theaters
Are Managed.
COMEDIAN JOSEPH HOLLAND.
Joseph Holland, the well-known com
edian, has now been a star for three
seasons, and, says Manager Bradley of
the "Mysterious Mr. Bugle" Companr,
"he has had frequent cause like many
another to deplore the ultra commer
cial element that has got control of the
theatrical profession in this country.
When he belonged to the rank and file
his interest was limited to the duties
demanded by his contract. But with
success came ambition, and with ambi
tion the desire to cut a path for him
self, and then he discovered the obsta
cles presented in the persons of the so
called managers of theaters."
"I want to have a theater," says
Holland, "that shall be dominated by
the stage, and not by the box-office.
How can we hope to have an American
drama while the manager of the thea
ter refuses to exploit new plays, and
continues to wait for the results of for
eign productions, or. failing that, to re
sc-rt to revivals of time-worn suc
cesses, or else to pander to the lowest
tastes of the mob.
"The ignorance of these men concern
ing the institution, of which by force
of circumstances they are the control
ling spirit, is to the actor that supports
them both degrading and humiliating.
They neither know nor care anything
about what transpires back of the foot
lights. Every play to them is a 'show'
which they describe as 'rotten 1 or
â¢great,' according to the number of
dollars they can % count in their coffers.
"As an instance, when the great Ital
ian actress Duse first came to America
the public wag not very responsive at
first with its patronage, and I heard a
gentleman ask of the manager (?) in
front of the house where she was play
ing and what he thought of her. 'N.
G,' he replied. 'She doesn't draw her
salt.' Later on Duse's reputation
spread, and the public was nocking: to
see her in droves, and, seeing the same
Individual, I asked him myself what
CORONER'S INQUESTS.
Market-Street Railway Company Ex
onerated â Walter Orr's Missing
Purse and Money.
Coroner Hawkins had a field day yes
terday in the matter of inquests, and
cleaned up all the Morgue cases on hand.
In the matter of the death of Customs
Inspector Henry Simpson, who was killed
by the fall of a warehouse door on the
Mail dock on March 2, the jury returned
a verdict that death was the result of an
accident "due to the careless piling .of
sacks of rice on the O. and O. dock and
the insecure fastenings of the door be
hind which said sacks were piled."
The verdict caused surprise, because
the testimony was to the effect that the
sacks had been piled in the most careful
and systematic manner.
The verdict in the case of Walter W.
Orr, who was asphyxiated in the resi
dence of Mrs. Nellie Comstock at 411
Lyon street Friday night of last week,
was to the effect that death had been
ciused by carbon monoxide poison by in
haling illuminating gas accidentally. Mrs.
Comstock swore that her husband was at
sea and that the deceased was a frequent
visitor to her house and slept there on
the nights of Christmas and New Year's.
On the night of his death Orr bade them
good by at half-past 9 o'clock and the

he thought of the celebrated actress.
He said: 'Great, my boy; she's play
ing to standing room only.'
" 'Well, but whuh of her roles do you
think her best?'
" 'Me? Me listen to that Dago talk?
Why I haven't seen her. Life's too
short.'
"Of course this manager was taking
no risks, he was renting his house as
he would in any case where an ex
periment was to be tried, and so long
as the rent was forthcoming it would
not matter to him whether it was Duse,
John L. Sullivan or a cock fight.
"No, it is all wrong. For once anyway
the English Idea is far superior to ours.
The actor-manager as he is known in
England is the only h.>pe of the stage
in America. The policy that exists here
to-day is fast bringing the theater in
disrepute. The best â  vidence of this
lies in the fact that th< m.inasrers are
being compelled to cheapen their wares.
Where a few years ago th-re was a
large number of high-priced theaters
which catered to cultured audk-nces, to
day these same places of amusement
are being turned into bargain counters
by the catch-penny devices of the
theatrical janitor."
All this may be put down as unwar
ranted pessimism on Holland's part,
but the same result, if carried out on
similar lines, will follow not only with
fhe stage, but with any other of the
liberal professions. No great novelist
will arise while sensational muck-vend
ors are paid by literary traders the
prices they are at present. There can
be no great cartoonist in the days of
the "yellow kid." The Danas, Augustus
Salas, Watterscns, et al. must take a
back seat and wait till the motley
pageant of yellow journalism has passed,
and medical science will be confined to
the academy until the quacks have had
their day. Let the game go the pace,
the faster the better, and then the
sooner will the people feel the need of
feeding the god as well as the beast
that is in them.

When the body was searched the purse

tons were missing.
In the case of Michael cvnrien, who
ruptured his stomach by .lumping off the
back of a cable car while the car was in
motion, the jury returned a verdict that
the death was accidental, "due to his
own carelessness, and we exonerate all
persons from blame."
Sues for a Small Fortune.
Kate C. Byrne filed suit yesterday
against Attorney W. H. H. Hart to re
cover 180,900. The complaint alleges that
the defendant entered into a written
agreement with her by which he agreed
to pay her one-twenty-ttfth of the sum
he received from Florence Blythe Hinck
ley, as her attorney during the litigation
over the millions of Thomas H. Blythc.
Mrs. Byrne alleges that Hart has re
ceived his fee and she is now entitled to
the amount due her under the agree

DR. KENYON
PROTESTED
A Body Was Embalmed
Before It Was
Cold.
Suspicious Circumstances At
tending the Death of Wil
mot F. Bailey.
Undertakers Blamed for Destroying
Evidence by Too Much Haste in
Performing Their Duties.
The practice indulged in by some un
dertakers ol embalming bodies be
fore the attending physician has had an
opportunity of examining them and al
most before the bodies have had time to
get cold received what is hoped to be a
check yesterday by the action of Dr.
Kenyon, who had been In attendance on
Wilmot F. Baney, a carpenter, at 153
Tehama street.
Bailey had been drinking heavily, and
was taken sick on the 4th of the present
month. Dr. Kenyon was called in, and
he saw at once that what was thought
by Bailey's friends to be. a case of alco
hohsm had developed into a case of pneu
monia. The patient was otherwise a
strong and healthy man, but it waa evi
dent that the disease was of the most
violent type and that there was litttle
hope for recovery. A few days after
Bailey had been taken sick Dr. Kenyon
received an anonymous letter, intimating
that Bailey might have been poisoned at
the instigation of certain persons inter
ested ii\ his estate.
The doctor paid no attention to the
note, because there was not the slightest
indication of poison about the case.
Bailey died last Friday morning, and
when the doctor made his appearance an
hour or two afterward he found that un
dertaker Gray had embalmed the body
without permission of anybody except the
family of the dead man. I'nder the cir
cumstances, he refused to sign the death
certificate, and the body was therefore
taken to the Morgue yesterday afternoon.
An autopsy wae held by Autopsy Surgeon
Gallagher and Dr. Kenyon. and they
found that pneumonia hud been the cause
of death, the lungs having been compact
ed solidly. There were no symptoms of
poisoning.
Dr. Kenyon said uiat there should ue a
prohibitory law against the practice of
embalming bodies before the attending
physician or some member of the Board
of Health has had an opportunity of in
specung the body, and in case of doubt
to hold an autopsy. Even in the absence
of such a law, he thinks that it is illegal
for an undertaker to embalm a body be
fore the death certificate has been signed.
The anonymous letter he believes to be
due to the fact that the deceased and
some of his brothers were lift an estate
some years ago, valued at $10,000, and that
he married a widow with two children by
a former husband, wherefore family
jealousy sprang up and caused bad feel
ings between the new comer and the rest
of the family.

Kidney and Uric i^cid Troubles Quickly Cured.
You May Have a Sample Bottle of the Great Discovery,
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, Sent Free by Mail
Men and women doctor their troubles j
so often without benefit that they get :
discouraged and skeptical. In most
such cases serious mistakes are made
la doctoring and in not knowing what
our trouble is or what makes us skk.
The unmistakable evidences of kidney
trouble are pain or dull ache in the \
back, too frequent desire to pass water, !
scanty supply, smarting irritation. As j
kidney disease advances the face looks
sallow or pale, puffs or dark circles ':
under the eyes, the feet swell and
sometimes the heart acts badly. Should i
further evidence be needed to find out .
the cause of sickness, then se* urine '

is a sediment or settling it is also con- !

bladder need doctoring. A fact often
overlooked is that women suffer as
much from kidney and bladder trouble
as men do.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root is the dls- '

Scientist and is not recommended for '
everything, but will be found Just what j
is needed In cases of kidney and blad-

of this great remedy is soon realized.
It stands the highest for its wonderful
cures. Sold by druggists, price fifty

successful is Swamp-Root In quickly
curing even the most distressing cases,
that to Prove its wonderful merit you

three two-cent stamps to cover cost of

COMING EAST
FOR TRAVERSER
The Chestnut Colt Falls
Heir to Another
Handicap.
Spencer Landed the Racing
Stake With Semi
colon.
Frank Ireland Was the Only Beaten
Favoriteâ Recreation Is in
Form.
The Baldwin Hotel handicap, if such
! it could be called, decided at Oakland
: yesterday over a mile, was another gift
for "Pa" Bradley's slashing colt Tray
; erser, carrying the Burns & Water
house colors. Traverser was origin
ally tossed in the race at 106 pounds.
I but Incurred a five pound penalty for
I capturing a stake only a few days
back, which made his weight 111. He
was a 1 to 2 choice in the betting, and
had only to gallop to win hands down,
doing the distance in 1:40% in the face
of a strong wind. The other entries
i were strictly up against it so far as
the adjustment of weights was con
j earned, and but four others started.
' Ostier Joe, packing 119 pounds, man
aged to take the middle money of the
i stake from Flashlight.
Favorites had things their own way,
five out of the six purses falling to
choices in the betting. The downfall
of Frank Ireland in the Racing stake
was a hard blow to the speculators, as
i the colt was heavily supported.
The first event decided, a six-furlong
| purse affair, was only a cakewalk for
the crack filly. Recreation. She was
played down from 8 to 5 to even money,
and though getting away from the bar
rier none too well ran circles around
| her field, winning easily from the sec
! ond choice, St. Calatine. California fin
ished in the show.
Tom Ryan's brown horse Robair was
I the goods in the six-furlong selling run
' next decided. He had nothing much
I to beat, and heading the 60 to 1 shot
! Santa Paula in the stretch won, ridden
j out, a scant length before Mamie G,
with Gray up. The latter came very
fast at the end, just managing to
1 snatch the place from Santa Paula.
The Racing selling stake for two
i year-olds, worth $700 to the winner, at
| four furlongs, resulted in a big upset.
â  The Corrigan entry Frank Ireland was
considered a certainty, and was sent to
the post a 4 to 5 chance. He was shut
j off soon after the start and was never
â  dangerous. The 30 to 1 shot Buena Ven
i tura set a merry clip into the stretch,
I where she was collared by Semicolon,
| with Spencer up, and beaten cleverly
by a neck. Toluca secured show
honors.
The talent sent Lincoln II to the post
an odds-on favorite for the mile and
a furlong run, and it took all the speed
and stamina the rhestnut horse pos
sessed to down Rey del Tlerra. who
had the benefit of Sloan's piloting. The
outsider, Thelma, with little Gray in
the saddle, led the field until three
furlongs from the stand, where Sloan
assumed the lead with his mount.
Clawson, on the favorite, then started
for the leader with a wet sail, and,
driving hard, won by a head in the
fast time of l:s4V<a. Serena landed in
the show.
The final six furlong sprint looked a
good thing for Bellicoso, with "Skeets"
Martin up, and Burkes big sprinter
closed a 9 to 10 favorite in the majority
c;f books. After a long delay Ferguson
released the barrier, and R. Q. Ban shot
out In the lead. The faint-hearted
sprinter held the front position to the
stretch, where the first choice assumed
command, and Martin experienced no
difficulty in winning easily by over a
length. Mamie Scott, at odds of 15 to
1, led Pelxotto over the line a head for
the place.
HORSE FLESH
PEDDLED IN
QUANTITIES
Again on the Market
According to Offi
cer Davis.
Is Sold to Various Local
Dealers for Sausage
Purposes.
First Handled by Chinamen,
by Whom the Bones Are
Removed.
TWO MEN UNDER WATCH
For Many Days the Chinese Quarter
Has Been Patrolled by the
Meat Inspector.
Beef is high, and horse meat is sold
at a very reasonable rate. Hence the
warning of the members of the Board
of Health to the general public, "Don't
eat sausage at any time or place."
Meat Inspector Davis is the authority
for stating that horse meat is again in
the market in large quantities, and
makes the thought of the possibility of
eating the meat all the more heart
breaking by stating that the carcasses
of worn-out horses are taken to the
Chinese, where it is "boned out" and
then sold to unsuspecting merchants.
For the past week Inspector Davis
has been holding down a tiresome beat
in Chinatown in the endeavor to catch
j the parties who were buying the horse
i flesh, and, although he was aware of
| the fact that the meat was sold, he
â¢ was desirous of completing his chain of
evidence in the matter to make it all
the more certain of a conviction In the
| courts of both buyers and sellers.
In some portions of town the boned
out meat has been taken to butchers
j for sale, but some have refused the
| flesh, and plainly stated that they were
j of the opinion that the sausage filler
was not the flesh of either healthy or
diseased cattle, but a darkened and
prepared mass of old horse flesh. The
efforts of the health department has
been exerted to the extreme, but so far
I the buyers have not been detected, but
; a chain of evidence is wrapped around
1 the seller, which will evidently result
; in an exceedingly interesting trial in
, the courts. According to the statement
<>f Inspector Davis, it is almost impos
sible to detect the flesh of a horse from
j that of beef, with the exception that
when the whole carcass is examined it
is easy to see that the horse was pos
sessed of a set of eighteen ribs, whereas
the humble beef carried thro-ugh life a
burden with but thirteen sets for sup-
It was not generally known that Da
vis was so well advanced in matters of
i physiology, but, according to his own
sayings, he has made the matter a
1 careful study from the animal stand
point. There are two men under the
strict surveillance of the department.
They are, Anderson and Hubbard. who
have long been suspected of selling
horse meat to merchants throughout
"I will stop this sale of horse meat,"
; said Inspector Davis last evening, "if
I have to go for a month without any
; sleep. For night after night I have
i been watching Chinatown with the
| hope that I could discc-ver who was
j buying the meat, and then to follow the
sePers to the various markets where
J the flesh is distributed for the purpose
f>f sausage making. Although horse
flesh is a shade darker and of a coarser
grain than that of beef, it is almost im
possible to distinguish one from the
I other. Sausage is sold at a reasonable
j rate throughout the city, and beef is
i at the present time high on the scale, j
I Horse flesh is being sold for 1 cent and !
! V-2 cents per pound, and in consequence !
| quite a profit can be made on sausage ;
i which may taste as well as beef, but, !
! according to all reports, not as healthy. :
Anderson, on San Mateo road, is one
of the parties I am keeping my eye on,
and I think he knows it, for I have
been unable to catch him In his actions,
although I know he is a guilty .party.
â¢'The bay is full of the heads and
| limbs of horses which have been killed
! for market, but at times the remnants
| are taken to the fertilizers. I myself
1 would not even dare to eat a piece of
j sausage at the present time, as I know
I it Is prepared from horse meat in the
majority of instances. Many buyers have
; the flesh palmed off on them, but there
| are a few in the city who are buying
it and know what they are getting, and
are willing to take it from the fact that
the prc-fit on the sausage is made the
greater thereby.
"The butchers and sellers of these
| worn-out car-horses will soon meet
with a surprise which will make their
J hair stand, but just how long it will
| take to bring them to their senses and I
: keep the public from eating the flesh of
; the animal is a proposition that I am
at the present time unable to state.
; The carcasses of the butchered horses
i are taken to Chinatown and sold by
I thf> horse murderers to Chinamen.
| After that the bones are removed and
i the flesh Is sold for beef sausage. There
i are few men who can tell the differ
; ence in the two meats, and in conse
. nuence the public and detlers are
, placed at a distressing disadvantage by
! a few unscrupulous butchers. I am
j etill after them, however, and know
! that the result of investigation will be
j a benefit to all."

DANGER IN SODA.
Serious Results Sometimes Follow Itm
Excessive Use.
Common soda is all right in its placÂ« .
and indispensable in the kit< hen and,
j for cooking and washing purposes, but
; it was never intended for a medicine.
I and people who use it as such will soma
i day regret it.
We refer to the common use of soda
to relieve heartburn or sour stomach, a
habit which thousands of people prac-
tice almost daily, and one which la
fraught with danger. Moreover, the
i soda only gives temporary relief, and
! in the end the stomach trouble gets
| worse and worse.
The soda acts as a mechanical irri-
tant to the walls of the stomach and
bowels, and cases are on record where
it accumulated in the intestines, caus-
ing death by inflammation or periton-
itis.
Dr. Harlandson recommends as the
I safest and surest cure for sour stomach
I (acid dyspepsia) an -excellent prepara-
i tion sold by druggists under- the namÂ©
lof Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. These .
j tablets are large 20-gram lozenges,
very pleasant to taste, and contain the
natural acids, peptones and digestive
j elements essential to good digestion,
' and when taken after meals they digest
â¢ the food perfectly and promptly before
| it has time to ferment, sour and poison
' the blood and nervous system.
Dr. Wuerth states that he invariably
' uses Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in all
cases of stomach derangemepts, and
finds them a certain cur*> opt.^nly. tor [
; sour stomach, but 1 y promptly digest-
< ing the food they create a healthy ap-
petite, increase flesh and strengthen
the action of the heart and liver. They
are not a cathartic, but intended only
I for stomach diseases and weakness, and
will be found reliable in any stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.

An Incident in the Reformer's Life
That Aroused Her Numerous

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.08 Broadway. March 12.
Much surprise and some Incredulity
â were expresed in this city shortly after
the death of Frances E. Willard at
a published statement that Miss Willard
had at one timo in her life not only
countenanced theaters on Sunday, but
had also been a partaker of wine at
dinner.. This statement was denied by
some of the temperance ladies in this
city, and they searched into the biog
raphy of Miss Willards early life to dis
prove the story.
Th>' statement that started the discus-
Blon was tne following:
The late Frances E. Willard was an
ardent supporter of the cause of tem
perance, but there was a time when
she recognized the fact that the cus
toms of some countries wprenot quite
consistent with extreme doctrine on
this subject. When she first traveled
abroad, she is on record as having
said that she did three things which
she never did at home. On the Con
tinent she went to see the sights on
Sunday, went to the theater and took
wine at dinner. She learned to love
Rudesheimer and Grand Chartreuse,
and, in short, she did in Rome as the
Romans do.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of the local W. C. T. Union, and an
Investigation was made. A search was
made, and It resulted in establishing the
truth of the statement. One of the mem
bers was authorized to prepare an ex
planation of the incident, and the follow- i
ing has been made public:
"Miss "Willard frankly admitted that ;
she did, while abroad, attend the theater j
a few times, see the sights a few times
on Sunday and took wine at dinner. But
when and how did these things occur? j
There were some important sights to be
Been on Sunday only. Then she was very
sick in Copenhagen and the doctor said,
'If you ever expect to see your home
again you must avoid drinking water as
you go from one country to another.' !
So she mixed wine with water at j
dinner. She learned better and when
abroad other times did not do so, but j
said 'Drink milk if you cannot drink the
water.'
"Then this was from 186S to 1579 before '
she became dean of the Northwestern
University, before she went into any tem
perance or evangelistic work and nine ,
years before she became the national i
president. Our beloved Miss Willard sin- .
cerely regretted the mistakes of those
earlier years and surely the grand work
siÂ«icÂ«* dcuM!. and the , stand . she had so j
nobly taMen for righteousness, trut,h and
temperance, the cause for which she gave ,
her life, should make one follow her gen- |
tle, loving example in trying to find and I
r-membering the good instead of the j
faults." ___________

RIVER WAR
BEGINS AGAIN
Southern Pacific Wants
to Regain the
Trade.
Oakland Benefited Greatly by
the Opposition of Last
Year.
It Will Be as Bitter During the Com
ing Season, Say the Inde
pendents.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 12.
The Southern Pacific Company has not
succeeded in making: a contract with the
commission dealers of this city to do
their river carrying for the coming fruit
season, but within a few days an agree
ment for five years may be drawn up.
Last year there was a war between the
dealers and the railroad company and
there was a great improvement in the
method of supplying this side of the bay
with fruit and produce from the Sacra
mento River. For the first time there
whs a direct line of boats to Oakland
wharves, and business was done direct
with the producers instead of through
the San Francisco middlemen. This plan
of taking the carrying from the railroad's
river boat* was not pleasant to the com
pany, and opposition was tried, but in
vain.
Now the railroad is anxious to regain
the trade and is attempting to enter Into
a conlract for five years with the mer
chants not to patronize the rival line that ,
comes direct to Adams wharf from the j
river. There is, however, a hitch in the ;
terms.
The railroad wants to discharge the I
San Francisco freight first and then send â 
the boats to Oakland. This will prevent
the shipments from reaching here until
some hours after the mall boats have
discharged, and this is, of course, Un
tenable. The merchants who are ne
gotiating with the railroad company also
insist that the rates shall not be higher
than those charged by the Dutch com
pany.
In the meantime the firm that started
the opposition last year. Hunt Hatch &
Co., have arranged for three boats to
come direct to them, and have enlarge-.l
their warehouses In anticipation of a big
business this season.
The" opposition last year proved of great
benefit. Prior to that time all Oakland's
business had to be handled through San
Francisco, and the cargoes of fruit were
handled many times before reaching Oak
land wharves. It resulted in fruit being
cheaper and fresher than ever before, and
there is no desire on the part of the pub
lic lo see a return to the old order of
things.
Dwelings Take Fire.

out promptly, but not until the house
was damaged so as to be beyond use.
The old lady could give no idea as to
the origin of the fire.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
HE MADE HER
NOSE BLEED
Politics Helped to Break
Up the Holmes
Home.
Sometimes the Lady Did Not
Realize She Had a
Husband.
Because She Cooked Badly There
Was a Resort to Ring
Methods.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 12.
A husband who slaps his wife in the
face with sufficient force to cause her
nose to bleed has no claim for a divorce
because of little irregularities in the con
duct of his wife. Judge Hall intimated
to-day from the bench that such would
be his decision in the Holmes divorce
case.
James Holmes is a well-know^ politi
cian and hardware man, and has been
| married twenty years. There are six
; children in the family, and, according to
I the testimony of the husband, the Holmes
home has been the scene of a cat-and-dog
life since their honeymoon in 187 S.
I the witness stand, Holmes told of his
sstic unhappiness. He says that for
y years he would have been better
ad he not been married, and charges
vife with laziness, and hints that at
eriod of the twenty years since they
married has he enjoyed the full
dence and affection of his wife. On
y occasions Holmes had to leave his
house on account of the cooking, or lack
of cooking, and he poured forth his woes
to-day by the hour.
Mr. Holmes also testified that he re
venged this conduct at times by beating
his wife in the face. He admitted sev
eral blows on the nose, and also said
that he had drawn blood on his wife's
Ex-Judge Frick, who appeared for Mrs. j
Holmes, drew out of the witness many
admissions of behavior that is not sup
posed to exist between husband and wife, i
and the idea that the politicians home !
was a happy one was rudely dispelled.
Mrs. Holmes does not like to be the |
wife of a man who gives up much of his
time to politics. She says that Holmes
is a very poor provider and sometimes ;
stars away from home for such long pc- ]
riods that occasionally she has forgotten I
she ever had a husband.
Judge Hall said the case would go over
till next Saturday to dispose of the chil
dren, and said that he would deny the
husband's application for a divorce.
RUINS OF MORRO CASTLE.
Where Rev. E. R. Dille Would Build
a Monument to Our Heroes.
OAKLAND. March 12.â During an il
lustrated lecture upon the civil war last
evening before the members and friends
of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion, Rev. E. R. Dille made tne following
allusion to the United States ship Maine.
It was greeted with uproarious applause:
"I want to insist that If* the American

AN ENCINAL CITY ENGAGEMENT.
OAKLAND, March 12.âThe engagement was announced to-day of Miss Nora'
Nebekar. daughter of Mrs. P. J. Nebekar, of Alameda. to James P. Potter. Mr.
Potter is superintendent of the Alameda electric road, and is one of the most
popular railroad men on this side of the bay. Miss Nebekar has an enviable
place in society in the Encinal City, where she has lived nearly all her life. The
wedding will take place next month.
the government has a right to demand
something of us we have a right to de
mand something of it in return. If the
American citizen can feel that the stars
and stripes will protect him wherever he
stands upon this planet his loyalty is as
sured. The humblest American citizen,
whether on Cuban soil, or the deck of the
Maine, which was American soil, ought
to be protected by every man-of-war in
the White Squadron and by every rifle in
the land.
"I hope we shall have no war with
Spain. But if the Maine, that lay sleep
ing in the Havana harbor like a guest In
the house of a friend, was destroyed by
Spanish treachery; if our gallant tars
were sent to their deaths without a
chance for their lives, then the Maine
mu^t be avenged. War is sometimes as
holy as white-robed peace, and if war is
necessary to vindicate the honor of our
flag let it come. If the Maine was de
stroyed by Spanish treachery with the
connivance of the authorities, then we
must build a monument to our heroes on
the ruins of Morro Castle."

SCENES AT THE SOPHOMORE-FRESHMAN FIELD DAY.
1 o'clock this morning. The cause of the
delay was the jumping of a coupling pin
as a" train of cars was being run upon It.
All except one started on to the Transit,
and but for the timely work of the crew
would have landed in the bay. Only one,
however got overboard before they were
stopped. The wrecking crew was sent

the upper end of the car and remove its
contentsâ paper â before it could be

A
SOPHOMORES
WIN THE DAY
Interclass Field Day on
Berkeley Cinder
Path.
Drum and Squires Carry Off
the Honors of the
Day.
The Largest Crowd Ever Seen
on the Berkeley Cam
pus.
The largest attendance that ever gath
ered around the cinder path of tho Uni
versity of California was that which
filled the spacious stands and lined the
fences yesterday to see the sophomores
punish the freshmen in the annual inter
class field day. Contrary to all expecta
tions, it was an easy victory for the so
phomores, who won the day by a score
of 115 to 75 points.
Sections in the grand stand were re
served for each class. The red of '01 class
flaunted out boldly and made a strong
contrast with the green of '00. There was
not a bit of unoccupied space around the
oval, and at all times the enthusiasm of
the rooters, covered with the green or
red. gave things a lively hue.
Drum was the hero of the day. Matched
with Woolsey in the three short distances,
a sprinter heretofore untried but from
whom great things were anticipated, he
captured first places in all. At no time
was he pushed hard. In the 100-yard
dash he covered the distance in 10 2-5
seconds. In the 220 he strode over the
cinders in 23 2-a seconds. The 440 was run
in indifferent style.
Squires, famous as a rider of the wheel,
divided the honors with Drum. This is
the first season of Squires on the track.
In the mile run, with a pack in front of
him at the beginning of the stretch, he
put on steam, and, forging his way
through the rile, breasted the tape first
after a sensational finish. Tho half-mile
was very similarly run. Smith was well
in the lead when the men began to spurt
for the finish. Then Squires increased his
speed, and with every stride cut down
the distance that separated them. Five
feet in front of the tape Squires passed
Smith and tore the tape.

game on the Berkeley campus this
afternoon by a score of 9 to 6. The

at least 1500 spectators, and the greatest
interest and enthusiasm was manifested.
Santa Clara had the best of it in the
early innings of the game, but in the
sixth inning the Berkeley hitters found

been compelled to stop before the end of

THE ALUMNI DEFLATED.
Stanford's Luck Was With Her at
Central Park in the Ball Game
Yesterday.
The cold wind that blew across Central
Park yesterday made it exceedingly dis
agreeable for the handful of spectators,
who shivered through eight and a half
innings of the uninteresting argument be
tween Stanford and the alumni.
The margin of two runs, by which the
college boys won, indicates that they had
no snap; in fact, the alumni played a
much cleaner fielding game, and but for
hard luck in not getting their hits when
they were needed, they would have won.
Although they were outbatted, the alumni
would have won had they not experi
mented with "Wheeler in the box, who in
the first and second was touched up for
seven of Stanford's ten runs. Goslinsky,
who succeeded him, did much better
work. Stanford's infield work was es
pecially ragged. Lougheed, Young and
Harris making two errors apiece. Cal
houn in center for the alumni was also
guilty of poor judgment on fly balls,
while his fielding was loose. Strange to
say, Strohn put up a much better game
behind the bat than Elston, who was
away off in his throwing to second.
The feature of the game was Heller's
attempt to catch Klaubers long fly to
deep left in the second inning. After a
long and brliiiant run he juat managed to
get his fingers upon the ball. The error
was a praiseworthy on*.
The score is as follows:
Alumni *0 0 10 12 112-8

CONTRACTORS GET
MONEY AND GIVE
NOTHING IN RETURN
How the Public Has Been Swindled in the
Construction of the New Ferry
Building.
One Job Upon Another and the End Not Yet in Sight â A Word
of Explanation as to the Matter of the
Floor.
There may be a delicate distinction |
between robbery and jobbery. The
men who have had charge of the erec
tion of the ferry building have been
guilty of one or the victimg of the other.
If the Grand Jury shall pass over their
dereliction?, then still must they be in
dicted before the greater jury of Pm>
lic opinion on the charge of stupidfty
most gmss. They have permitted the
funds of the State to go astray, and they
have allowed the contractors to make
a profit which has never been contem
plated. If there is any excuse for
this, if there is any reason why the
money provided for the accomplishment
of certain work on a certain plan, and j
apparently ample for the purpose. |
should have been expended in mucn |
cheaper work and then prove insuffi
cient to complete this work even on
the inferior scale, the pvfblic would like I
to know. The Harbor Commissioners |
as honest men would be glad to have j
the public know. Attention was called j
yesterday to severai items, among them j
the floor of the grand nave, which, as
constructed, cost $39,400 less than it
' DiASPAn Showing OneEvsy OFGRAnDMAvr â¢*"â¢ -46 Rays Like This â
would have cost had the specifications
been followed. There is no desire to
do anybody an injustice. The floor as
completed may be as srood as the floor
as planned, but it is not the floor the
State pays for. When a contractor
undertakes a certain work, and by get
ting the specifications changed is en
abled to sublet the work so as to ac
quire an extra profit so great as this,
he muet excuse the tendency to demand
a bill of particulars. The boor was to
have been supported by arched tiling
bound by steel ties. Instead of this
it is supported by expanded steel, and
the ties are omitted.
There are architects who assert the
method employed to be as good in
every respect as the other; in fact, it
has advocates confidently proclaiming
its superiority. This is a side issue
wholly. There is no desire to do in
justice to any system, and it is true
that the expanded metal has been se
verely tested, and is now being put
into buildings of importance in this city
and elsewhere. The sub-contractors
who constructed the floor of the grand
nave are in no manner to blame. They
offered to do the work at a certain fig
ure and they did it. They have the ut
most confidence in its stability and so
have others. The fault is with a scheme
which has permitted a contractor who
was over them to reap a benefit which
should have been the State's.
The more the depot job is looked into
the rottener it appears. This does not
imply that many sub-contractors, like
the gentlemen who put in the floor,
may not have been entirely honest. It

merely implies that through hook, or
crook, which is the same thing, the
State has suffered, has paid for a sec
ond-class article freely the price of a
first-class. Yesterday some attention
was paid to the changes made, these
changes not only marring the structure
but boosting to an extravagant figure
the gains of the contractors. In not
one of these changes was there a ben
efit to the State. In every one of them,
on the contrary, was a distinct loss.
Going back to the subject of the
floor, it would seem that the matter
had been introduced to the Commis
sioners as an incident, shrouded in so
many words that they failed to realize
its Importance. It was December 3,
1896, that Mr. McCarthy submitted the
following proposition:
Change terra cotta arches of the build
ing to expanded metal concrete arches;
omit the mosaic floors of the two exits
between the open nave and the open pas
sageway and replace these surfaces with
the cement finish as specified for other
floors; omit the flreproofing of all girders
and beams, but replace the portions at
the ends of the arches with concrete so
as to form panels in the ceiling; cover the
partition walls of east side of open nave
with Tennessee marble, with base, pan
els and molded cap of the same design
and construction as the marble piers of
the side; cover also with Tennessee mar
ble the two partition walls in open nave;
cover also the entire walls and stair
openings of the two stairway halls west
of the open nave and build eight caps of
moldings at main stairways of Tennessee
marble, all according to plans to be made
by the architect. The foregoing changes
and alterations to be made without any
additions or deduction from the contract
price.
Mr. Chadbourne moved that the
proposition be accepted. Mr. Cole sec
onded the motion. The ayes and
noes were called for and the president
declared the motion carried. Architect
Swain and Engineer Holmes advised
the acceptance of the proposition.
Now here was an artistic triumph for
McCarthy. By a few words buried in
a mess of minor proposals he had ob
tained the permission of the board to
put in a floor which could be construct
ed for $39,400 less than the floor he had
contracted to put in, and there was an
express provision that he should be
paid for it just as though there had
been no change. But the board must
not be too harshly criticized. With a
thoughtfulness which under the Mc-
Carthy spell it did not always exercise,
it refrained from bestowing upon him
extra emoluments.
For fear of getting tedious a glance
may be taken in another direction. A
glance In any direction will be apt to
reveal something not only of interest
but which certain persons would ruther
not have bruited abroad. The <i?p<>t is
built of Oolusa stone. When uid^ were
being considered a decision vas â  cached
that the proper material was Oregon
stone. It was understood that the
latter was more expensive. In fact,
there are statements that the bid on
Oolusa was $97,000 and on Oregon $109.
000, and that the higher bid was ac
cepted. If this is incorrect of course
a few questions by the Grand Jury
would bring out the truth. At any rate
the bid on Oregon stone was accepted.
Tho depot is built of Colusa stone, some
of it chipped, some patcne;!, and much
of it badly tooled. The change was
brought about as follows:
At a meeting of the board April iO,
ISOe. Architect Swain submittoj a wrU
ten report, in which he r^cjm mended
the usr of Colusa stone in place of Or
egon stone, the price being the sanjo.
Chief Engineer Holmes concurred. The
board indorsed this idea, and it was
agTed that the best intermits of the
State required that Colusa undstono
be substituted for Oregon gray stone
as piovided in the contract with Mc-
Carthy, On motion of Mr. Cole, sec
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAKCH 13, 1898.
onded by Mr. Colhnn, the following: res
olution was adopted:
That this board shall and will execute
an amendment to such contract, substi
tuting Colusa sandstone in the place of
Oregon pray stone, according to draft
of amendment submitted herewith by the
attorney of the board, provided that
within ten days from date the said Mc-
Carthy shall file the written consent of
his bondsmen to the original contract
consenting to such change; otherwise
such amendment to be inoperative.
The amendment to the. contract was
then signed by the members of the
board and by McCarthy.
If the change was a betterment then
the eye is deceptive. The Claus Spreek
els building is of the Oregon material.
Comparison is invited. Besides, the
price was not the same. The figures
quoted above The Call believes to be
correct. The State has a poorer stone,
the contractor, a fatter co-ntract. How
ever, this phase of the subject is a
large one, and will be reverted to more
than once before "finis" shall have been
written at the end of this serious se
rial.
In the opening chapter as it appeared
yesterday, there was an intimation of
crookedness in other contracts. Here is
part of the sequel: All the interior
woodwork of the depot, contracted to
be finished in oak, has beÂ«n changed
to pine. More than this, a large part
of it has been cut out. Still more than
this even, the lucky contractors have
been voted extra compensation because
in the goodness of their hearts they
have consented to use cheaper stuff and
far less of it. If such a transaction
has a funny look surely the gentlemen
who brought it about will be glad of a
chance to explain. On March 16, 1897.
Architect Swain sent to the board the
following letter:
Replying to your request for my opin
ion as to the advisability of omitting all
finish of all kinds in the mezzanine story
of building and also of changing the in
terior finish throughout in remaining
parts from oak, as specified, to kiln-dried
Oregon pine in first story and finished in
natural wood in second story, I beg to say
that, while I woul.i prefer to retain the oak
material, yet, owing to the large increase
of wood rendered necessary by revised
plans, it will be impossible to execute the
work in oak with funds at your disposal.
I would, therefore, recommend that the
finish in oak in mezzanine story and that
the wood work in remaining parts be
changed from oak to kiln-dried pine, as
per bid of Bateman Bros., and in accord
ance with revised specifications of same,
a copy of which I hand you herewith.
Here is a copy of the proposition of
Bateman Brothers, the same having
been duly accepted:
We herewith respectfully submit bid on
proposed alterations and additions to our
contract. * Â» â¢ For the sum of $2995 we
agree to erect all additional partitions to
waiting-rooms of first and second stories
as per plans Nos. 209 and 210, dated Jan
uary 28, 1897; doubling all above parti
tions at lavatories, ticket offices. Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s office and Postoffice; con
ditional that all interior finish work of
first and second stories throughout be
made of kiln-dried Oregon pine Instead ot
oak, as called for in original- specifica
tions, and that all wood called for in the
original specifications in mezzanine story
be omitted.
Here, as old Squeers might have re
marked, is richness. The contract had
been let for oak. There was to have
been a mezzanine story completely fin
ished. There were to have been many
partitions, which wisdom or the lack
of it abolished, and yet for this con
sideration, which any contractor might
well have appreciated without having
a reward thrown in, Bateman Brothers
got a present of almost three thousand
dollars. The work as it will appear
will look cheap in contrast to the same
work as it should have appeared, and
yet it costs more, and there is to be a
whole story left without a touch. BjOBM
of those contractors must be hypnot
ists. The plea of economy doesn't seem
to go.
It is time to take another visit to the
grand nave, which is a grand swindle
as well. It is the floor of this which
has caused so much discussion. Mr. Bell,
of the firm which put the floor in. was
at The Call office last night. He said
his floor was in every respect first class,
but admitted that he put it in al
$12,000 less than it could have been done
under the original contract,
board," explained Mr. Bell, "said they
wanted this money to use in another
place. I understood it was to go to
ward the marble wainscoting in the
nave."
Very well. But when the board per
mitted McCarthy to put in marble in
stead of glazed brick it was distinct
ly stated that he was to have for this
and other changes, any one of which
would have been richly profitable to
him anyhow, the total sum of $2416.
Mr. Bell was asked where he sup
posed the $12,000 saved on his contract
had been applied. Naturally Mr. Bell
did not know. Neither does anybody
else who seems ready to tell. But it
was applied to some use; the people
paid it.
But while in the nave it is worth
while to look at this marble about
which such crowing has been done.
Every charge of extravagance, every
hostile criticism is met by the jubilant
rejoinder: "But look at our marble."
Well, let's have a look, taking along an
expert so as to be able to appreciate.
Harry Fenworth is an expert cutter
and fitter of marble. For three months
he worked on this famous wainscoting,
and he pronounces it a defective and
dangerous job. When it is remembered
that the marble cost 15 cents less a foot
than the glazed brk-k it replaced and
that for making the substitution the
contractor got extra pay, this fact
seems peculiarly irritating.
"The whole north end," said Mr. Fen
worth, "has fallen over an inch." He
took out a rule, and demonstrated that
the marble had settled until between
the two extremes of the end wall there
was the difference indicated.
"Look at this three-inch marble band
around the cornice," he continued, "it
has settled five-eighths of an inch in
nine feet.
â¢The members of the molding on the
cornice." he went on, "have only one
fourth of an inch bearing on each other.
According to all rules of architecture
and building, they should have an inch
and three-quarters. Little marble
plugs are used to conceal the hollows
created by this shiftless method. It is
a scheme for saving marble, but it is
bad work."
Mr. Fenworth railed attention to
many defects which the eye could
verify. Slabs supposed to be firm
enough to stand indefinitely are so
loose that they respond to a touch of
the hand. Other slabs standing side
by side ar^ out of alignment. Where
slabs come against door frames the
junction is crude, and about the edges
discoloration has already set in.
Among the many weaknesses exposed
are two of a perilous nature. The great
slabs over the doors leading from the
nave to the ferry are insecure. "Some
day," said the expert, "they will fall.
Instead of bein^r properly fastened by
"T' bolts to a beam they are held by
eighth-inch wn which catches in the
marble threÂ«-q carters of an inch. The
vibration of the doors will loosen these
wires and the slabs -will come down,
likely with fatal results."
Mr. Fe:; worth also declared that the
"caps" were so flimsily fastened as to
be liable to come down at any time.
Then he took a glance at the mosaic
floor. "The worst I ever saw," was his
comment. "There is as much cement
in it as marble."
It will be recalled that the State
agreed to furnish the cement. Con
tractors have not been backward in
taking advantage of this.
The outline printed this morning
shows some of the grand nave work
which McCarthy was paid for omitting.
The grand knave will be the spelling of
some name before this cruel war is
over.
HIS NAME IS PERGIN.
The Man Shot in the Junction Saloon
Is Slowly Dying.
The true name of the man who was
shot in the Junction saloon, O'Fatrell and

Charles Dunne, the night bartender, is
D. W. Pergin, and not W. D. Perkins, al
though he was sometimes known by the
latter name.
He has been living with a woman for
some years at 717 Bush street, and she
called at the Receiving Hospital yester
day afternoon and identified him. He Is
a native of England, and once served in
the English army. He also served in the
army hen- tor ;i short time.
Hi's death Is only a question of hours,
as the doctors say that he is slowly but
surely sinking. Dunne has not yet been

The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company is evidently not inclined to go
into court and contest the suit brought by
Henry James to recover a deposit of $5
collected from him when he first or
dered a gas meter in his home. A copy
of his complaint was served on the cor
poration Friday, and no time was lost
by the company in forwarding a com
munication to James, advising him
that his "voluntary" advance of $5
would be returned to him on the pres
entation of his certificate of deposit,
properly indorsed. Mr. James declined
to act on the suggestion of the com
pany. "With him it is a matter of prin
ciple and not of the money involved.
He is determined that the disputed
points shall -be passed on by a court
r>f competent jurisdiction. In tha'c
stand he has the best wishes of many

forced to submit to the exactions of the

The letter addressed Mr. James after
the commencement of the suit is care
fully worded. It refers to a "volun
tary" deposit of $5. There was nothing
voluntary about the deposit. It was
compulsory. James ordered that he be
supplied with gas. The officials of the
company informed him that it would
be necessary to deposit $5 as a guaran
tee of payment of the .gas bill. He
made the deposit, and the gas company

Sd'SpeciTo pa^their fill, if they are
â *Â«Â£Â»Â£& enough in ga. w*h
-ut resorting to such methods as re
luirlng a deposit from customers. Not
oni ago I was negotiating with some
ocal Capitalists in regard to forming
i new gas company, and at the time I
sent to Europe for information as to
meters out when we transferred our
the most improved methods of manu
facture. I ascertained that gas could
be manufactured here at 40 cents a
thousand feet, which would enable the
company to sell it at $1 and make a
profit of 60 cents a thousand. There is
more money in gas than in almost any
thing I know of. The old Central Com
pany incorporated with 2Q.000 shares of
stock at the par value of $100 a share.
This stock was put on the market at
$35. and within nine months after the
first work of construction was begun it
paid a dividend of 6 per cent, and has
continued to pay good dividends ever
since, while the stock has reached par.
"It ought not to cost the old compa
nies more than 50 cents a thousand to
manufacture gas now, while the rates
are $2 to consumers, leaving $1 50 profit.
Before the Central Company was formed
gas was $3 a thousand In this city, but
we put the price at $2. and it has never
been above that figure.
"Oh, yes," continued Mr. Burling,
"there is big money in gas, even with
out manipulating the meteis. How
can that be done? Easy enough; sim
ply by pumping air into the pipes. That
will make every meter on the circuit
score up like a cash register. Mind you.
I don't say the companies do this; the
Central never did, but I say It can be
done, and in such a case a customer
might pay for about four times the
amount of gas he had actually use<?,^
"I repeat that there is ample pro*t
in the business without resorting to
such schemes as tampering with meters
or holding up customers for illegal de
posits."
The law regulating the dealings of
the gas company with consumers is si
lent on the matter of "voluntary" de
posits before meters are placed in
houses. The idea of "voluntary" depos
its was created in the minds of the cor
poration officials. The consumer, igno
rant of the law, paid the sum exacted
when they went to the office of the gas
company.
Now that the corporation has virtu
ally admitted that it is not authorized
by law to exact deposits, judging from
the letter forwarded Mr. James, it is
reasonably certain that those who have
been imposed on in the past will assert
their rights.
The gas company to-day has several
hundred thousand dollars of "volun
tary" deposits to its credit in bank and
drawing interest. The suit brought by-
Mr. James will in all probability result
in the return of the money wrung from
the gas consumer in the shape of "vol
untary" deposits. The gas company
has practiced two ways of doing busi-
ness. If the intending consumer went
to the office and ordered gas furnished
him he was compelled to make a "vol
untary" deposit. But if he notified the
company through the mail that he
wanted gas supplied him the meter was
put in without the necessary "volun
tary" deposit. Those who gave their
orders through the agency of "Uncle
Sam" profited thereby. That the com
pany realized that it had no right in
law to demand "voluntary" deposits Is â¼
but evidenced by the stand taken by
the co-mpany. If it had the right to ask
for "voluntary" deposits, the notices
received by mail would have been ig
nored.
The suit brought by Mr. James will
be watched with interest by all gas
consumers.

000000000000000000 Vno_textTHE FEAST OF THE FIJI ISLAND CANNIBALS
THERE has lately been placed on
exhibition in the Academy of
Sciences a genuine cannibal
bowl from the South Sea Islands.
It is an ugly, blood-soaked relic
that it took days to scrub clean
and rid of a sickening odor of human
flesh The bowl is about five feet
across at the top, is hewn out of a
single block of wood, and in days gone
by was used for holding the cooked
bodies of human beings after they were
taken from the oven to be carved and
served to the cannibal feasters.
Captain George E. Jackson, who
spent years cruising among the South
Sea Islands, on hearing of the arrival
of this bowl a few days ago, at once
hastened to examine it. He scrutinized
it from all sides to assure himself that
It was genuine.
"I've seen bowls of that kind used
many a time," he said. "In fact I
think I was present at the last cannibal
feast In the^Fiji Islands, when several
of them were in use. I never want to
see such sights again.
"It Is generally thought that canni
balism in the South Seas is at an end.
But it was not stamped out in a day.
"The conversion of the Fijians was
accomplished from the coast inland by
missionaries. And so it was that the
interior mountain people for many
years captured victims for their feasts
from the inhabitants along the coast.
Several attempts were made by white
men to reach and punish these moun
tain cannibals, but it always resulted
in loss of life followed by a feast of
human flesh ir the camp of the canni
bals.
"The principal town and stronghold
of the mountain people was Nivotheene,
situated at the head of the Reeva Riv
er. The case of the last White man
they captured and ate was very sad.
The Rev. Thomas Baker, a Wesleyan
missionary, with seven of his native
teachers, attempted to reach Nivo
theene, but when within a short dis
tance of the place they were set upon
by the Na-Vosa tribe, killed and eaten.
Baker had been strongly urged by the
coast natives against making the at
tempt, as it was well known the Na-
Vosa tribe had long been eager to eat
a white man.
"I was with an expedition that was
bent on stamping out cannibalism
when the report of this crime came to
hand. Of course, it roused every white
man in the party, and we redoubled our
energies to round up the man-eaters
and give them a lesson that Bhcmld for
THE CALL Sunday Edition
ever end their appetites for that kind
of Jood. Old Chief Thakambau of
the coast tribe had loaned us a lot of
his best natives as guides and soldiers.
It was on this trip that I was forced
to witness one of their horrible feasts.
"Well, we tracked the man-eaters to
their villages after a deal of hardship,
but invariably found the huts empty.
The rascals, by some native wiles, were
always warned of our approach in time
to decamp. As if to taunt us they al
ways left behind a pile of human bones
and other signs to show that they were
still man hunting and defied us.
"On our last advance, when we were
quite deep in the mountains, one of our
scouts came to us with the news that a
missionary and his entire party of na
tive followers had been killed by the in
habitants of a small village near by."
" "Did anybody escape?" asked our
captain.
" 'Three white men,' answered the
scout. 'They had firearms and the can
nibals were afraid to approach near
them, so the white men backed away
and escaped.'
"After ascertaining the exact location
of the village our captain decided to
ralditand if possible prevent the forth
coming feast. To prevent ajiy chance
of its coming off he ordered another
man and myself with several natives
to go ahead with him and reconnoiter,
while the rest of our company of sev
enty-five men should follow as fast as
the rough character of the country
would permit.
â¢'lt happened, however, that our
guide was entirely mistaken in regard
to the locality of the village. It was
much nearer than we had figured, and
before we expected it we heard distant
shouting.
" 'Those are the cannibals,' we all
cr^ed at once and ran for the nearest
defense thicket. But this move brought
us closer to the village. Then we found
it advisable to climb into a cleft in a
cliff to see and to prevent being seen.
From this point we could look across
into the village and see the women
piling wood into the ovens and making
other preparations for the coming
feast.
"The distant shouting drew nearer
each moment, and soon the most fero
cious-looking crowd I ever saw came
dashing into the village dragging the
bodies of several dead men.
"Then the feast commenced and we
could do absolutely nothing but stand
and watch it, hoping against hope that
our main party would hear the shout-
Ing and close up.
"The first thing the natives did was
to prepare the bodies. This process
was much as a housewife does in pre
paring a chicken for roasting. Than
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
they were trussed and tied into posi
tion, and, after being placed on a long
hardwood board, were shoved into the
heated ovens. There they remained
about eight hours. All the while the
people of the village shouted, danced
and yelled and drank large gulps of
the Island liquor.
"The scene at this time beggars de
scription. It was one wild whirl of li
centious debauchery.
"At a signal from the chief the danc
ing suddenly ceased and the ovens,
made of bricks and stones, very much
like a baker's oven, were opened and
the bodies were dragged out and placed
in the immense wooden bowls waiting
for them. The same kind of a bowl as
this," indicating the one on exhibition.
"Then an official of some sort came be
fore each bowl and with spear and
knife cut the bodies into portions.
These portions were quickly seized and
â¢greedily devoured.
"From our hiding places in the cliff
we could catch the voices of the feast
ers, and our natives translated the Fi
jiaris' opinion of roast white man. It
seems that this white man had been
roasted in a special oven and special
care had been bestowed on his prepara
tion.
"There was, however, some disap
pointment among the feasters. They
decided that white man was 'too salt*
and not as good as they had expected.
Some of them thought it would have
been better to have kept him awhile
and fattened him for the feast. It was
decided that this should be done with
the next white man they captured.
But the chance never came to them.
"During the long hours we had been
standing in the cleft of the cliff our
company had been about a mile away
waiting for the captain to return and
give further orders. As he did not
com* the officer in charge became un
easy and reconnoitered himself a bit.
"Hearing the shouting he approached
the village. When he saw the feast go
ing on he concluded that we were the
victims, and at once took command of
the soldiers upon himself.
"He ordered an advance. It did not
take our boys long to break up that
cannibal feast. There was a short
sharp resistance, but a few rifle balls
created a panic and the cannibals
fairly disappeared.
"The next day we were attacked by
the same cannibals and it was a lively
fight. Three of our men were killed,
but we almost wiped the tribe out of
existence. The few we didn't kill we
captured, and since that time there has
been no trouble over flesh-eating in
Fiji.
"I forgot to say that the evening
after we cleaned out that first village
By an Eye-Witness.
HAS JUST CONVERTED
lt2O CANNIBALS,
DEV. JOHN PATTON
has just returned from
several years of active and
arduous missionary work
among the savages of the
New Hebrides Islands.
Though he takes an im
mense pleasure in the large
number of converts he
made to Christianity, his
greatest pride is that he
was aj)le to induce a very
large number of cannibals
to forsake the practice of
eating their captured ene
mies.
Dr. Patton made a rough
estimate of these converts
and placed the number at
1120.
the cannibals sent us a basket with
about forty pounds of human flesh in
it, with a taunting message to eat it
and get some courage, as we should
need it. That was the last act of d*Â»
fiance of that kind they ever had a
chance to play on us.
"The question has been raised about
women being allowed to eat with the
men on the occasion of these cannibal
feasts, but old Fijians told me it was
not customary, although not absolute
ly forbidden, and it \v;is usual for the
men to eat their fill first; then women
came in and took what was left. One
old chief replied that he would like to
see the woman 'who did not contrive
to get her fill.'
"Another old chief, when asked about
pork and man, said there was no com
parison between them, human flesh be
ing so much the best.
"A man was called 'long pork,' while
a hog was called 'short pork.'
"One custom of revenge and insult
among warring cannibals was to col
lect the bones of the bodies thus eaten
and reduce them to a powder. Then
when peace was restored and the tribes
feasted together this nice ingredient
was added to some favorite pudding.
Afterward should war again break out
it was the height of triumph to taunt
the late guests with having eaten the
dishonored bones of their kindred.
"In the mad quest to satisfy their
craving for human flesh these canni
bals would often dig up the bodies of
those who had died natural deaths.
"On a hill at the head of the valley,
near Nivotheene, stands another town
named Balavu (the long town), which
in 1871 was surprised by neighboring
tribes, who slew and ate 260 victims.
This was the last great feast on the is
land, and it continued several days."
WEIRD FUNERAL RITES
Over the
HEAD CHIEF OF THE SIOUX.
RECENT dispatches announce
the probably last illness of
Red Cloud, the famous Indian
chieftain. The last great chief
to die amrmg the Indians was
Young - Man - Afraid - of -
His-Horses, hereditary chief of the
Sioux, who died of heart disease at
Newcastle, Wyo., July 14, 1893. The in
cidents attendant upon his funeral will
in all probability be repeated should
Bed Cloud die, as he is also held in
highest esteem among his tribesmen.
On Friday morning-, July 14. 1893, the
Indians of Pine Ridge agency became
greatly excited, armed themselves and
congregated in groups about the agency
and grounds. So great became the ex
citement that the whites became
alarmed and inquired regarding the
cause. The Indians said that Young-
Man-Afraid-of-His-Horses had been in
trouble with the whites and had been
killed. No explanation of this was of
fered, but the Indians insisted that it
was true. For two hours the uncer
tainty continued, and then a telegram
came frc-m Newcastle, Wyo., 200 miles
away, saying that the chief had
dropped dead from heart disease that
morning. The Indians had received the
intelligence of his death, but not its
manner, two hours before the telegraph
brought the news. R. O. Pugh, who
has been overseer and superintendent
among the Sioux for more than twenty
years, and who is thoroughly conver
sant with their affairs, says that he has
known of several similar instances and
in every case the news received by the
Indians had been verified by courier or
letter hours or days afterward.
The body of the dead chieftain was
placed in a casket and sent to Pine
Ridge agency, arriving there the Mon
day following the death. The camp of
the chief was about ten miles from the
agency and there the Government had
erected a big council chamber for him.
This was known as the chief's omaha,
and here were held dances, councils and
ceremonies of all kinds. To this omaha
the body was taken and laid in state,
about the building. The east and the
north are sacred points of the compass
The women and professional mourn
ers began their howling and wailing
early in the morning, and at times the
sound was almost deafening in its in
tensity. Louder and louder would the
sound grow, until it seemed as if pan
dem6nium had come upon earth. Then
the wailing would die away and grow
fainter until but a solitary voice would
be heard, moaning and sobbing in the
intensity of grief. Then one after an
other would join until the whole body
would be at it again, and so it con
tinued as the hours passed by.
All about the omaha the warriors
congregated, filing in and out and pay
ing their respects to the dead chief
tain, each leaving some tribute on the
floor until there was a pile of fine blan
kets, robes, bridles, saddles, bolts of
calico, ornaments, and, in fact, every
thing that an Indian possesses and
deems valuable, covering the floor
about the casket. As each Indian de
posited his offering he designated to
whom It was to go, andfthe one named
would accept, bfit would leave it on
the lloor. The acceptance meant that
two years later, at the end of the
mourning period the recipient would
return an equivalent to the donor.
Young-Man-Afraid-of - His - Horses
had two wives, one a full blood and
the other a half-breed. When he died
his full blood wife retired to her house
and received no company. Neither did
she show herself during all the rites
and ceremonies attendant upon the
funeral. The half-breed wife, how
ever, not only came out, but showed
such an excess of grief as is seldom
seen as she appeared at the omaha
she had her arms and legs bare and
they were hacked and cut in a most
horrible manner. As she walked every
footprint was marked with blo^d, and
it ran down from her arms. Her ap
pearance at the omaha was a signal
for the old women who were mourn
ing for the chief, and they proceeded to
inflict similar mutilations upon them
selves. Howling and moaning, they
ran about like so many escaped luna
tics, all the while scourging themselves,
while the men joined in the horrible
chorus of wails.
This continued until late in the after
noon, when the Rev. Mr. Snavely, the
Epicsopal clergyman of the agency, ap
peared and prepared to conduct the
ceremonies of that church over the dead
chieftain. The blue cloth robe of state
which had been worn on great occasions
by Young-Man- Afraid-of-His-Horses.
was laid in front of the casket, and in
the presence of thousands of mourning
Indians the beautiful ritual of the
church was read in the Dacotah lan
guage, the clergyman being assisted by
George Fire Thunder, an Indian cate
chist of the church. While these ser
vices were going on Inside, thousands
of Indians were moaning, wailing and
howling on the outside of the omaha.
At the close of the services the In
dian chiefs and warriors assembled in
side the omaha, and one by one they
recounted the many brave deeds of the
dead chieftain in which the reciter took
part. When all had finished, the cas
ket was carried to the hill northeast of
the omaha, and there, by the side of his
father, and children, who had gone be
fore him, he was laid to rest with his
weapons by his ide.
After all the personal property of the
dead chieftain was distribtrted among
his friends, the relatives took upon
themselves the badge of mourning
which was to last two years. They
covered their bodies with canvas, cut
gashes in their arms and legs and then
cut their hair short. According to the
code of Indian ethics the hair is not
touched during the entire time of
mourning. At the end of the period
some friend is called in who combs and
plaits the matted mass, receiving a
horse for his pay.
The most peculiar phase of the life
of Young-Man-Afraid-of - His-Horsea
was the fact that he could read
and write English script, but was to
tally ignorant of printed letters. He
was self taught in this, and would
never attempt to learn to read print.
The writer has in his possession a let
ter written to him by Young-Man-
Afraid-of-His-Horses a short time be
fore his death. It was written in red
ink and is a fair example of Indian ex
pression in English. It reads as fol

BEST WORK OF A GREAT CARICATURIST

fantastic Louis Quinze "hotel" built
from his own design, being separated
from Madame Caran d'Ache's dainty

with events connected with the strange

say against the idea, I applied at the
French Embassy in order to know
what would be the best way In which
to fulfill the obligation, which I knew
devolved on every young Frenchman,
of serving a certain time in the French
army. Once I had obtained this, to
me, very important information, I start
ed gayly for France with very little
money in my pocket, but with high
hopes and boundless ambitions surging
through my brain.
"When young I had drawn a little,
but only for my own pleasure. One day
some one presented me with a book of
French drawings and among them were
some by Detaille. They impressed me
greatly. So when I reached Paris, in
my forlorn condition, I boldly presented
myself at M. Detaille's door, a portfolio
of sketches under my arm.
"Kindly is not the word for the man
ner in which I was received. Edouard
Detaille received me in a fashion that
proved him to possess what is perhaps
rarer than great genius â a great heart.
He looked over my poor little drawings,
encouraged me to persevere and then,
after I became a private in the French
army, he never lost sight of me.
"Not till I became attached to the
War Office, however, did I find time to
do work with a view to publication. To
my surprise I found a ready, if humble,
market for my wares, and It was then
that I first signed my drawings 'Caran

nifies In Russian 'lead pencil. 1 "
did you gradVally make your
way? Or, if it is not an Impertinent
question, to what do you attribute your
first great vogue as a caricaturist?"
"Nay, I consider that a very legiti
mate question, for there must be in
every artist's life a moment when he
finds himself trembling between ob
scurity and popular As for
myself, my first great stroke of luck
was undoubtedly the production of
'L'Epopee' at the Chat Noir."
And as my host uttered these words
there suddenly came into my mind the
half-forgotten recollection of an even
ing at Montmartre, spent in gazing at
the wonderful shadow performance
which was at that time the talk, not
or-hy of Paris, but of Europe.
Many of those to whom "I'Epopee"
stands out among their own cherished
recollections of a visit to Paris are
probably unaware that they owed this
rare artistic pleasure to the now fa
mous draughtsman; for at the time
when the original performance took
place in the strange Bohemian cafe
concert, now numbered among the dead
glories of vanished Paris. Caran d"'Ache
was quite unknown, pave to a small
group of Montmartre Bohemians.
"As to what suggested TEpopee,' "
he added, "that was a very simple mat
ter. A friend asked me to desjgn an il
lustrated cover for a comic song. I at
tempted to carry out my idea by an
application of the old-fashioned silhou
ette. Suddenly it struck me that my
initial idea was capable of unending
developments. I threw myself with ar
dor into the work, and as the result of
hundreds of experiments finally pro
duced the leading scenes of the great
Napoleonic drama, carefully divided
into thirty tableaux. The whole was
engineered, as It were, with the help
of four thousand figures and horses,

lay," a story which he first sung at the
Bohemian Club and which hasmadehim
famous in the clubs of two continents.

each of which was entirely evolved and
produced by me, being first drawn,
then cut out and pasted on a zinc leaf,
which, when once more silhouetted,
produced a sentient member of my large
dramatic company. I may add that
the whole work from beginning to end
was entirely carried out by me.
''The whole action took place across
a comparatively small white screen. I
attended every performance and stage
managed the whole affair myself. I
think I may say," he added, modestly,
"that I succeeded in creating a very
vivid impression of life and movement.
Each detail of every little figure was as
carefully studied as were those of Na
poleon I himself, and I made many ex
periments before I felt even half-satis
fled with the result. The most striking,
and also the most popular, tableau was
undoubtedly 'The Retreat from Rus
sia,' for. a curiously impressive effect
was produced by the slow passage in
single file of countless men, horses,
wagons and carriages across the great
snowbound plains."
But the artist was too modest to
allude to the extraordinary Impression
produced by this strange work of gen
ius. From all parts of the continent ar
tists, eager to make acquaintance with
this extraordinary novelty, crowded to
the Chat Noir. Among those who made
their way up the steep streets of old
Montmartre were celebrities as
strangely different as the Prince of
Wales, General Boulanger and the then
President of the French republic. Meis
sonier, the great military painter, de
clared himself astonished at the ex
traordinary accuracy of the costumes
and uniforms as indicated in the sil
houette. Drawings of I'Epopee were
seni "by request" to the late Czar, who
to the end of his life was one of Caran
d'Ache's most constant patrons. In
deed, much of his best work even now
goes to Russia.
"Strange as you may think it," he
continued, "I have always been ex
tremely anxious to do serious work.
For years I have cherished the scheme
of some day devoting my life to com
pleting a great series of military pic
tures taken from every period of his
tory. One of my heroes, by the way, is
the great Marlborough. But all bril
liant deeds of arms attract me. and
even as a boy I began a collection of
military relics."
"And as to your methods of work?"
"Well, I work very slowly, and so
far I have preferred to dfaw in line. Of
course, from my point of view artists
should be able to draw anything. As
to myself," he added, laughing. "I
leave one branch of art severely alone;
that is portrait painting. Friends have
often asked me to draw them, if ever
I attempt to carry out their wishes
they are anything but pleased with the
result. You see, the worst oi' it is I
really see people in line, ani often,
when I have produced a group which
I consider almost photographic in its
accuracy, I am Informed thai: I have
rarely made a better caricature!"
"And where do you find your sub
| jects?"
Caran d'Ache made a vague gesture.

produce easily; alas! I cannot claim to
imitate their example. Take one com
paratively simple matter, that of cos
tume. Tell me what a man wears, and
I will tell you what manner of man he
is."
"Then Lt is true. Monsieur, that you
attach an immense importance to
clothes?"
"Yes, indeed."
"And is there any special work now
occupying your attention?"
"Well, In one sense, I always have
more to do than I seem able to ac
complish, and once a week I contrib
ute half a page of political sketches
to the Figaro; but at present I am
devoting a great deal of thought, to
say nothing of time, to working out a
scheme which will probably first see
the light in a completed shape at the
forthcoming exhibition of 1900. I am
thinking of calling it 'La Rue de Cent
Ans,' 'The Street During a Century,'
and it will be a kind of panorama em
bodying the life, movement and poetry
of the typical Paris thoroughfare dur
ing the last hundred years. Among
other things will be shown the many
modifications undergone by traffic from
the days of the post chaise to those
which have ushered in the motor car.
Perhaps you will hardly believe me
when I tell you that I have found
working up this subject a matter of
absorbing interest. I have literally
hundreds of authorities, and the more
I go on, the more absorbed I be
come. Of course, there will be many
glimpses at the great revolution, and
the first and second empire will also
play th-ir part, and then there will
be the grim siege of Paris. I am avoid
ing any element of melodrama; but
picturesque incidents are of course wel
come, and one of the most important
features of the scheme will be a re
construction of the historical review
held by Napoleon I on the Place dv
Carousel."
"By the way, surely when compos
ing this kind of work you find it ne
cessary to make use of models?" 1
"No, indeed. I have very strong
views concerning the professional
model, and in this matter I disagree
with many of my most talented com
rades. To my mind, no professional
sitter can give a true impression of
life and movement. That a man or
woman should be suddenly able to
slip into the skin, as it were, of an
other character would argue on his
or her part a very notable dramatic
gift. Why should we expect to find
a great actor or actress in every pro
fessional model? Now, animals make
very good sitters, and every dog lover
will admif that no one can be a bet
ter poseur than our intelligent four
footed frtend when he has a mind
that way. Still, from my point of
view, beasts are quite as interesting
as human beings. Whenever I can
spare the time I enjoy an hour In the
Jardin d f Acclimitation as much as any
of the children whom I see there.
Horees have always remained my fa
vorites, but there are many creatures

Instance, are peculiarly picturesque,

"By the way. do you yourself gen

cil?"
"At the present moment ost of my
drawings are done with pen and ink,
or, which in some ways I like better,
with a very fine brush. I have thou
sands of studies, for I so often modify
my original conception that these gen
erally become very useful <.o me after

engaged on approaches its final stage
I fasten it by its edges upon a large

fit. Of course, as regards reproduc

A WISE man once remarked: "Goia is wher
ever you find it." And when you come to
look into the matter you find there is a great
deal of truth in the sentiment. Nature has
been so lavish in her distribution of the pre
cious metal that no continent or climate is
without Its share.
To-day men are digging for gold under the burning
Bun of ihe tropics and amid the deathly cold of the
long:, long Arctic, night.
No climate is sufficiently formidable to deter the
gold seeker, and once the madness is upon them men
will as glaGly lay down their lives in plague-stricken
Fkaguay as in malarious New Guinea. Even now,
early in the seasi.-n as it is, boats are loading up in
Australia for Alaska, and the men who but a few
years ago ruphed across the arid doserts of Western
Australia, following a long line of plodding camels,
"the ships of the desert," as the Arabs call them, will
ehortly be guiding a dog sled over the snows of the
Chllkoot Pass, or steeering a flat-bottom boat down
the rapid Yukon.
A contrast between these two rushes illustrates
moat forcibly the vicissitudes of a miner's life. All the
early finds which made Australia famous as* a gold
producing country took place on the eastern side of
the continent, and comparatively near the seaco-ast.
I; ere the land is fertile and well watered, there is a
large farming population and railways intersect the
country in every direction. Even during the '50's, be
fore the colonies of Victoria and New South Wales
fully opened up, the distance from the seacoast
diggings was not difficult to manage for the
poorest seekers after fortune. From Melbourne it was
an ea^y walk to Ballarat, and from Sydney, though the
Elue Mountains had to be crossed, there was a well
made coach road all the way to Bathurst.
But in Western Australia the conditions which met
the prospector were entirely different. The center of
Australia was once a vast shallow lake, now it is an
arid desert, where little but salt bush and spinifex
an! where yecrm often puss without a drop of
rain falling- The difficulties to be encountered were.
In their way, quite as great as those which the Klon
diker has to face. Only for frozen ranges you must
substitute burning sands, for blizzards dust storms and
for dogs arid sledges camels and pack trains.
Yet, in spite of all these obstacles, an intrepid pros
pector, in 1291, started out into the desert from South
tern Cross, then the outpost of the Western Australian
Fines. Though but a small mining township, South
ern Cross became famous shortly afterward for an
other reason. It was the place to which Deeming, one
of the most remarkable murderers of the century, fled
after killing and burying a wife in Melbourne. Deem
ing's method, it will be remembered, was to quietly
make away with his wife, and case her in cement un
drr the fireplace of the parlor. He repeated this op
eration several times, and when arrested at Southern
Cross had already ordered a quantity of cement, so as
to be ready for the new bride whom he was shortly to
ry.
Deeming had nothing to do with the great Cool
gardie gold finds. It was the plucky Bayley who made
his way with infinite difficulty through the trackless
desert. Even a camel cannot travel forever without
water, and thus Bayley's journeys were restricted.
But about ISO miles from Southern Cross he met with
his reward.
He found a very rich alluvial patch, and after some
little prospecting discovered the outcrop of the reef.
The specimens of quartz which he brought away with
him assayed very richly, and with the news one of the
greatest gold rushes of the century set In. Bayley, in
accordance with the mining laws of the colony, re
ceived a reward, as the name which the mine still
bears, 'Bayley's Reward." indicates.
Coolgardie was not a poor man's diggings. Though
there was plenty of wondeilully rich alluvial, there
was no water with which to wash it. Dry blowing
was resorted to. with more or less success, and some
very ingenious blowers were invented to meet the de
mand. But in the early days the cost of living wa3
tremendously high; everything had to be brought from
the seaeoast on the backs
of camels, and even water.
that most necessary of all
fluids, cost $2 a gallon. The
saloonkeeper, when you
asked for a drink of
whisky, would hand you
the bottle to help yourself
as freely as you chose.
but if you were so
exacting as to demand
water with it. he would measure out the precious fluid
with the most niggard hand.
Despite all these drawbacks thousands of poor
prospectors essayed to make their way to the diggings.
Carrying their -'swags." as the Australians call a
man's roll of bedding and clothes, they toiled painfully
along the dusty track, already clearly defined by the
whitening bones of those who had lain down by the
wayside to die. The stages between water were ex
ceedingly long, often a couple of days' journey, and
to fall on the road meant the most terrible of all
deathsâ by thirst. How many perished miserably in
the desert will never be known; no record is ever kept
of the nameless dead who have fallen by thousands in
all parts of the world while madly seeking for gold.
Gradually, of course, the rush began to organize it
self, and the danger of the journey was in some de
gree lessened. A favorite plan was for a number of
miners to combine and hire a cart, in which they placed
their luggage, while unencumbered they walked be
side. The great drawback to this method was that at
the worst part of the road the horses generally broke
down from lack of feed and water, and then the un
fortunate prospectors, themselves suffering from thirst,
had nothing for it but to carry their own burdens, and
hasten to the nearest water hole, thankful if they
might get even a mouthful of muddy, fetid water.
Another and more successful method was to use a
wheelbarrow, and hundreds of men pushed their be
longings in this way to the diggings. One ingenious
individual evolved a new scheme. He placed his outfit
in a cask, through which an axle was run, thus en
abling the curious contrivance to be drawn along the
road after the fashion of a garden roller.
But none of these contrivances would have enabled
men to live at Coolgardie, had it not been for that
wonderful beast, the camel. The use of this animal is
not a new thing in Australia. For many years it has
been employed amid the sheep stations of the "back
blocks" which fringe on the desert center of the conti
nent. At Bourke. in New South Wales, some 500 miles
from the coast, the camel-carrying business is quite an
extensive industry. It is undertaken entirely by Af
ghans, and therefore meets with the most bitter oppo
sition from the white carriers, who, with horse or bul
lock teams, formerly monopolized the carrying trade.
There are over a thousand camels at Bourke, and ev
ery day you can see a long string start forth, led by a
white-robed Afghan, for a journey of perhaps several
hundred miles to some outlying station. They take up
food and supplies of all kinds, and return with great
bales c-f wool, slung one on each side of the camel.
THE conditions of travel which prevail in icy Alas
ka are so utterly different from those of any tem
perate clime that even the most experienced Cali
fornian or Australian traveler will find himself
utterly lost when he lands at Dyea or Skaguay.
Just now, as the beast of burden, the dog is all
the craze, for the parties leaving Fnus early 57T the
season expect to get over the passes and well on the
way to Dawson before the snow melts. And as the
dog is the only beast of burden used by the Alaskan
Indians, everybody wants dog, no matter what kind of
dog; anything will do, so long as It is dog.
The demand for the useful canine has been so great
that California has been pretty well stripped of its big
dogs. Every steamer takes away scores of these ani
mals; the steamer National City carried over 100, while
the Australia carried even more. During the past few
BY CAMEL TRAIN OVER THE BURNING DESERT TO COOLGARDIE.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
months to own a St. Bernard or a Newfoundland has
been a serious responsibility; any number of dogs
have been stolen, and the departure of each steamer
has witnessed some amusing scenes between irate dog
owners and Klondike adventurers.
In most cases the dogs were honestly bought by the
prospectors from well-known city dealers. But the
real owner c-f the animal app red on board with a
search warrant, and there was no resisting the strong
arm of the law. The dog had to be landed, pending
judicial inquiry, and the miner, having no time to
bother with lawsuits, had to let the matter drop and
submit patiently to his loss.
Almost every kind of dog has been taken to Alaska
â St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, Great Danes, mas
tiffs, retrievers, bird dogs of Indescribable breeds,
have been bought and shipped at prices often rang
ing as high as $150. Yet in the face of all this the
latest reports from Skaguay inform us that any num
ber of dogs can be had there for $10. As this is ex
actly the freight which the steamers charge for tak
ing the dogs up, it seems likely that many of the
prospective millionaires, when they land at the head
of the Lynn Canal, will rather regret their expensive
investment in dog flesh, the mon so as it is highly
probable many of the dogs, either through ill-treat
ment or constitutional weakness, will perish beneath
the rigors of tfiis Arctic clime.
It is one thing to own a team of real Eskimo dogs,
inured by generations of breeding to every form of
hardship, and quite another to deal with the delicately
bred city dog, who has never done an hour's work in
his life. Of course, the St. Bernard and the New
foundland come of a cold-resisting stock; they have
the thick, furry coats necessary to protect them from
the frost, and as long as their feet hold out they may
be of some use. But what the poor short-haired dogs,
such as the Danes and the mastiffs, are going to do
in the Arctic it is hard to imagine.
A city butcher, who has had some Alaskan expe
rience himself, made a remark the other day which
illustrates the ignorance and inexperience of many
Klondikers. "A man came here." he said, "and or
dered six barrels of corned *eef to feed his dogs on.
Corned beef! Why, the poor brutes will have their
tongues hanging out and be parched with thirst be
fore they have done half a day's work."
The butcher knew what he was talking about; It Is
as necessary to provide water as meat for dogs who

are working hard. And everybody who has been In
the Arctic regions know that you cannot eat snow; it
only increases instead of diminishing your thirst. You
must stop and light a fire and melt the snow before
you can get a drink. To melt enough snow to satisfy
the thirst of a team of dogs fed on corned beef would
be a Herculean enterprise.
Still, putting corned beef on one side, the difficulty
of feeding dogs is the great obstacle to their use on
long journeys. A team will only drag enough food to
last it for thirty or forty days, so a month's journey
is the outside limit of their utility. Of course, you can
do as Nansen did, and eat the dogs when there is
nothing more to feed them upon, but the plan hardly
sounds satisfactory.
4 Probably the best feed for dogs, because of its com
pact nutritiousness, is the dog biscuit, made of a mix
ture of meat and meal. The one drawback is the ex
pense â the biscuits cost about 15 cents a pound. As a
cheaper substitute the butcher recommended Indian
cornmeal mixed with crackling, a compound sufficient
ly heating for this rigorous clime.
Before any work can be expected from these im
ported dogs it will be necessary to carefully shoe
them, for their tender feet will never stand work over
the ice-clad rocks of the passes. It is estimated that
three good-sized dogs will draw an ordinary seven
foot single sled, such as is commonly sold in the city.
Some prospectors, going in large parties, propose to
use two sleds, fastened together, and hauled by a
team of seven. This is more after the Indian fash
ion, who harness up their dogs in teams of from seven
to eleven, according to the weight of the load and the
size of dog. But each full-grown dog is supposed to be
able to draw a hundredweight for his share.
The method of harnessing is very different from
that used for horses or other larger beasts ot burden.
The dogs are fastened to a single yoke line by a
breast strap, and have no guide reins, the animals
having sufficient intelligence to obey the voice of their
master. But, to make sure, a leader of known sagac

NEW EAD OF USING THE LIFE OF ANIMALS TO CURE SICKNESS
THERE is a new fad coming to
the front in "sick circles," or
rather It is an old fad in new
dress, and that is the laying on
or use of animals to cure hu
man ailments. To such proportions has
It grown in France that the ingenious
French have invented a name for itâ
Zootherapieâ and have started zoother
apie sanitariums. Now there are pro
fessors in zoo lerapie, irÂ«tructors in
zootherapie and any number of kindly
disposed men and women who will give
you advice in zootherapie or tell you
the experiences of themselves or their
families in trying zootherapie.
The fad has spread through Europe,
has rippled across America and has
reached this city, though here it is
not practiced as yet in all its full
blooded variety as it is across the water.
As yet the laying on of freshly killed
doves and the smaller animals is as far
as the local follower of zootherapie
goes, but in Europe the sick encase
themselves in the bodies of fresh killed
beeves.
Fresh killed doves laid on the head
for the cure of nervous diseases H the
most popular form of zootherapie as
yet that has reached here. Mrs. Eugene
Le Fere, wife of the well-known tan
ner, has tried it. She said: "It is true
the French have faith in the healing
power of a freshly killed dove. We
tried on my own little baby who died
a few months ago. We had the very
best doctors in the city and when they
said they could do nothing more for the
child 1 was frantic with grief. Some
one suggested the dove. I immediately
tried it. You know at a time like that
you snatch at the slightest hope. It
did not help my baby, but then she was
past help befor- we tried it.
"I remember when I was a little girl
I had a fever and they put the dove
cap, as I called it, on me. I don't re
member whether I was sick long after
the application.
"I know of a great many French
families here who put on the freshly
killed dove when their children have a
fever and almost always it draws it
out. You ca/i safely say that the cus
tom of using a dove is general among
the French people."
In Paris the most popular zoothera
pie sanitarium is frequented by all
sorts and conditions of people with dis
eases ranging from "housemaids' knee"
to "mumps." The doctor does not
claim to be able to set a broken leg by
placing a patient in contact with an
animal who has four sound ones, nor
does he admit any one to his sanitar
ium who is in need of a surgical opera
tion. But for all nervous diseases, hu
mors of the blood, fevers and the like,
he asserts that his live remedies are
far more effecient than those prescribed
by the regular old-time practitioners.
Weak and nervous patients are given
blood baths, the beneficial results of
which are said to eclipse electric, Turk
ish. Russian or any other kind of bath.
An abattoir is a necessary adjunct to
the sanitarium, for the bath tub is not
the usual porcelain one, but the patient
is put Into a freshly killed calf, and the
hide is quickly sewed up, so as not
to allow the heat of the blood and en
trails to escape. Just enough air is
permitted to enter the interior of the
animal to allow the patient to breathe
with ease. After remaining a variable
length of time in this unique bath, ac
cording to the state of health of each
individual, the patient is taken out and
plunged into a hot water bath.
Sometimes but one such bath is con
sidered necessary to restore the weak

S American domesticity decreasing?
This question is engaging the serious attention
of our present day sociologists, and with good rea-
M. son, since if the ansyer be in the affirmative the
matter is of the gravest import to our country.
That such a question should be asked at all is one
manifestation of the changed conditions which
have come to us since the time of the almost univer
sal home use of the cards and the spinning wheel, the
brick oven and the candle molds.
Statistics show that in many of the States over 50
per cent of the working men are assisted in the sup
port of their families by the labor of their wives and
children, and that in the United States 4.000.000 women
(or IS per cent of the entire female population) are
wage workers, the number having doubled in the past
twenty years. We also see in our large towns and
cities that men and women seem more and more in
clined to make separate homes and that the "boy and
girl marriages" characteristic of our forefathers and
foremothers rarely take place now among: out Ameri
can young people.
Does all this tend to show that love of home is
dying out among us, and that the advance of women
along educational and industrial lines is practically a
desertion of the duties which were formerly set aside
as her only heritage and the performance of which
was considered her only fitting career?
Some of San Francisco's wise and broad minded
â¢women promfnent in professional, business and phil
anthropic circles have given the following answers to
the very important question:

the woman who was brave enough to ignore traditions
and join the workers of the world. But all this has
changed. Women of all classes and conditions work
at the present timeâ many who are wealthy for the
very love of being occupied and accomplishing some
thing in the world, and others because necessity in
some form or other urges them on.
To be a wife, a mother, and a good housekeeper is
no longer considered the only proper sphere of woman,
but it is a matter for regret that so many of the poorer
ones lire expected to work both outside and inside
their homes. It is not easy to combine the offices of
bread winner and home keeper, and when a woman
has to fill both places the home generally suffers. Do
mestic life alone demands the best mental and physi
cal energies of woman, and when the wife and mother
overtaxes her strength in any way the result is fatal
to the welfare of her posterity. The main trouble with
women who work is that they are usually not content
with doing a man's work as nearly as they can, but
try to do a woman's work also in tL^ nours during
which the man takes his needed rest. The woman who
tries to "keep house" evenings after working hard all
day is a martyr indeed, but there are many such
among our working people.
Husiness and professional women are solving this
problem for themselves, and the result: Is the "girl
bachelor" and "women bachelor" homes, which are
comfortable and convenient, but seem to be a mistake
from one point of view. Club life for either men or
women can never take the place of home life, the true
home life which God meant us to institute and enior
It is a selfish form of existence at best, and its ten

ber must be taken. These baths are
most expensive luxuries, for a beef can
be used but once, as artificial heating
of the blood and entrails does not suf
fice for the natural life-giving warmth
of the freshly killed animal. Only the
rich can afford to indulge in these baths
and the doctor numbers among his pa
tients some of the wealthiest and most
distinguished persons in France.
A live stock farm and aviary are two
other essential features for the sani
tarium. Some patients are ordered to
sleep alongside of a healthy lamb, oth
ers are required to hold a live puppy
to their foreheads at stated intervals,
many are obliged to lie for days on a
couch, hugging close to them cats or
birds of some variety.
It is claimed that in every instance
when the patient recovers the animal
or bird dies, this fact being used as
proof positive that the strength of the
animal is transferable to the patient
by means of contact, and vice versa,
that a disease can be transferred to a
lower animal from a human being by
contact.
While a sanitarium of this sort is an
entirely new idea, the custom of apply

things in the world for a man or wo

women to sit with one leg swung over
the knee of the other.
Many have often wondered how in

and a score of others are due solely
in many cases to the common habit of
IS AMERICAN DOMESTICITY DECRE ASING?
As far as working to help support the family is
concerned women have always been doing that. Of
course I am speaking now of the middle and poorer
classes, not of the wealthy ones, whose lives are or
dered on different lines. In times past it was the rule
of housewives to do their own washing, make the
clothes for the family, and often the cloth from which
the garments were made, and all the preserves, soap
and candles used in the house, besides many other
things. Thus the wife earned at home as much often
a? the husband's wages amounted to, and sometimes
more, since if he had been obliged to hire the work
done the money paid out would have amounted to his
entire Income.
Machinery has changed all this. Now it is cheaper
to buy the things formerly made at home, and women
not being able to save this outlay must make up the
deficit by going outside the home to earn what they
can in other ways. But whether woman works in a
store, factory or in her own house it makes no dif
ference with the fact that she works, and has always
wo-rked to help support her family, and is not work
ing any harder now than before; nor is she any less a
good wife, mother or home maker. On the contrary,
being more experienced, better educated, and conse
quently having broader views of life, she is better
fitted for these sacred duties.
That there are fewer marriages is due in part, it
seems to me, to the fact that girls no longer feel com
pelled to marry for homes, and are therefore more
particular as to their-choice of husbands than many
were in former times, when to be unmarried was con
sidered rather discreditable than otherwise. But even
now I think that there are very few who are "girl
bachelors" from choice. It is an exceptional woman
who would not like to be a mother,. but many sensible
and good Women who would make good wives prefer
to live single rather than to have men not of the high
est type for the fathers of their children.
This, I think, is one cause of the decrease in mar
riages among our better educated young women, but
the greatest cause is that men who could support fam
ilies are many of them keeping "bachelors* homes,"
preferring the freedom of such establishments to do
mestic happiness. It Is a regrettable fact that many
of. our men lead lives as bachelors which are by no
means up to the high standard of morals which they
would require of any woman whom they would think
of making a wife; and it is also regrettable-greatly

"Cold feet, varicose veins, headache, ul

the improper circulation of the blood
in the lower limbs are caused by the
pernicious habit of crossing the legs,"
this medical journal goes on to say.
The reason why such serious diseases
follow the mere crossing of the legs is
a purely physiological one. If you
cross your right leg over your left knee

of the suspended right leg is sustained
by the left knee, which places all of

the broadening out of woman's latent Â«nd loftiest
powers, the pluming of her wing to the higher nest,
that in her freedom an advancing posterity may never
wear a yoke.
The higher the civilization, the endowment and ed
ucation, the greater the capacity for enjoyment and
the power of conferring enjoyment. Tncrefore each is
struggling to excel herself and others, and in the
tumult of trying to overtake lost opportunities every
one and every trade is treading upon the heels of the
foremost, and a danger signal flies at the entrance to
a new century. But that order will evolve from chaos
in due time I have no doubt.
"Marry and multiply," for numbers may be a ne
cessity of the new colony; but the helter-skelter is
ruinous to advanced civilization, and I take it as a
promise of a better future domesticity that our girls
prefer celibacy with independence, self-ownership and
possession and disposal of their own earnings rather
than marital absorption and a life of servitude, to
gain an epitaph and name as "relict" on a tomb
stone.
I know of no better remedy for the growing ten
dency to become "girl bachelors" than to lure them
from their bohemia by the surety of good, true and
faithful husbands â a better, cleaner, purer and upright
manhood. For so long as time shall last woman will
love a lover, crave a home, long for the kiss of baby
lips at her breast and lift her adoring eyes to an ideal.
And as she rises in her o-. n self-respect the more ab

majority of business women. If 50 per cent of the
working men in Illinois are assisted by their wives
in supporting their families, then 50 per cent of these
men are paid wages too low to provide for families.
This is a matter that our Government, composed of
men, should investigate.
While acknowledging that the number of wage
earning women has doubled in twenty years, we must
recognize the fact that our present financial and in
dustrial systems have made it impossible for the poor
to maintain homes without the united effort of father
and motherâ and often children. I consider the em
ployment of children in any business a crime against
humanity. This, however, is a proof erf the love of
home and does not presage the decline of domesticity,
but an effort to maintain it against fearful odds.
I wish I had a whole column in which to speak for
the bachelor maid. A visit to her den will show you
her love of domesticity. When the right man comes
she will make him a lovely wife. But she will never
marry for a home. She has discovered her economic
value, and will never make a liome for a man who will
not show equal ability to maintain it.
American domesticity, as I understand it, is not
In danger. It is in a transition stage, but will coma
out improved when the new man has found himself.
The wives and mothers of long ago were no more
content than the women of to-day. They wrote and
talked of duty and self-sacrifice. They laid great
stress upon what one ought to do and feel, not what
they did and felt.
The proof of what they felt comes with the history
of the factory movement in New England, when they
rushed to the mills to work fourteen hnurs a day.
Lucy Larcum tells the story in "A New England Girl
hood," showing the factory life to be one of ease com
pared to life in the homes they left behind.
A lady of 78, being questioned on this point,
expressed herself with great vigor. "Yes," she
said, "there were contented women, but I prefer the
word resignation as closer to fact. No, my dear, thank
God you live now and not a hundred or even fifty

taught to lay burdens upon us. But he is being made

death. Nor must the dove be caught
by other than innocent hands, and so
the obtaining of the dove generally falls
to the lot of the youngest child in the
house.

The process of reconstruction generally brings
with it doubt, fear and confusion. Our domesticity
is in the thioes of this process. The business woman,
who is the greatest factor in this reconstruction
movement, is standing firmâ still womanly, still home
loving. She will not be overcome by the shock she is
giving society by her rapid strides toward higher civi
lization, which means broader and therefore more ele
vating womanhood; larger and therefore more stable
and substantial home life.
American domesticity, like all things by nature
imperishable, is simply undergoing a change from an
inferior condition, when
women did no wage-earning
work, to one vastly superior,
when women receive wages
for their work.
MRS. LOVELL
WHITE.
Fifty years ago men complained that ideal domes
ticity could not be attained because there were too
many idle women to be supported by them. The pen
dulum has swung to the other side. Women now have
the liberty to exercise their genius and skill in any
chosen direction, and they are awakening to the fact
that idleness shelters and protection dwarfs the pow
ers alike cf men and women.
The result Is that to-day women are stronger men
tally and physically than they were a generation
since. As mothers they are wiser, more Intelligent;
as wives they are more companionable; as members
of the community more valuable, thus increasing ap
preciably the degree of domesticity.
A nation is great in proportion as its women are
educated and individualized. In countries whÂ»re
women take an active share in business life civiliza
tion reaches a high degree of development, and domes
ticity, including In its broader sense both home and
country, Is relatively benefited. The fact that four
millions of women in the United States are wage
workers seems to point to the probability that the
golden age is fast approaching, >vhen every human
being shall support himself or herself. The girl bach
elors are to be congratulated upon their enviable po
sition.
In former times the women who did not marry
were called old maids. Having no definite status, they
became objects of derisio-n and spent their lives in
rearing other women's children. Independence is an
admirable quality wherever found, and when the girl
bachelors select a better name, better descriptive of
their state of evolution, no critic need carp.
As to club life for men â man has always made
woman's opinions for her. He tells her to remain in
doors and limit her knowledge to the concerns per
taining to the feminine domain. He declares that
contact with the larger life of the world will take
from her personal charm. She believes him. The re
sult is that he finds companionship at his club, and
when compelled to be at home he generally drops
mentally that he may be in touch with the family in
telligence. So long as mortals lack the power tv
transcend the limits of sex so long will they make
separate habitations for themselves.

attendant responsibilities- But this by no means
proves a lack of appreciation of its advantages.
A great natural law cannot be subverted by any
artificial conditions. Men may evade the burdens of
domestic life, live in "stag camps," clubs, lodging
houses and restaurants or what not, and women make
to themselves homes without husbands, for both sexes
have demonstrated their adaptability to these make
shifts. They are, moreover, all conscious that such
things are but poor substitutes for something better,
and it is beyond question that the unconquerable in
stinct of domesticity, the irresistible innate desire of
the human heart for the satisfactions of domestic life
threatening in time to be beyond the reach of the
masses, will be the powerful lever by which social and
industrial revolution must come.
In the meantime it must be admitted that young

exactly as a bicycle is, while between
the balloon and the car are two more

men are less disposed to settle In life, and young
women have learned that self-support is better than
marrying for a home. The tendency is certainly Hjl
less early and more deliberate marriage. The heartw

The attention now given to child study refutes In
itself the idea that American domesticity is decreas

rich and profase. From the mothers' meetings of the

of life.

There has never been a time when either laws or
customs of society prevented women from working.
In fact, the earlier civiliza
tions made of woman a
drudge, with all the condi
tions the word implies. It is
only since woman herself,

impelled by that inherent force which so mysteriously
connects us with the great law of evolution, has
sought to gain knowledge, as well as to broaden her
sphere of labor, that society, church and state have
united in holding her in check.
The past half-century has brought wonderful and
rapid changes in the condition of women the" world
over, and among them all, perhaps, the most
marked change is in the opening up of so many lines
of industry hitherto monopolized by men.
To understand even a little how this condition
came about it is necessary to study the marvelous
changes that have been wrought in the whole world
of work and industry by the wonderful discoveries
in the do-main of science and of art. The discovery^
of steam and electricity as servants to do the bidding^
of the human mind, together with the brilliant array
of mechanical inventions which seem a natural se
quence thereto, have been to this age what the dis
covery of gunpowder and the art of printing were to
man from the sixteenth century onward to the nine
teenth.
But this century has brought greater changes In
the industrial conditions of women than of men. With
all the advancement made for thousands of years
past, the condition of woman as a household drudge,
a servant in the home of her master, whether father
or husband mattered not. was unchanged. The dis
taff and spindle, the loom and embroidery frame,
varied by kitchen work, held women for ages untold
in the seclusion of the home, whether cot or castle,
but the divine power of scientific discovery has
brought the spinning jenny, the power loom, the sew
ing machine, steam laundry, etc., etc., to change the
whole dumain of domesticity.
Those labor-saving inventions have not emanci
pated woman from the domain of labor, but they
have broadened and enlarged her sphere of industrial
activity.
That wives have always assisted their husbands
in the support of their families needs no argument
but the spinning and weaving and fashioning of rai
ment by hand did not count in domestic statistics
when wives were servants in everything except nam->
and wages.
The employment" of women to do the work that
men might do, while those men are left idle is largely
owing to the greed and avarice of the employer cla
who readily seize upon the political inferiority of
women to offer less pay for the same work P'
women upon an equality with men politically an<l
the employer class will not dare discriminate against
them in the matter of wages.
We cannot go back to the domestic life of a half
century ago if we could. We should strive to adapt
ourselves to the new order of things which is sweeping
us resistlessly onward to, I believe, a higher and n - I
bier life, both domestic , and social, for men and '
women alike.
If there is a tendency of the sexes to make separ
ate homes it proves, at least, the enjoyment of
a greater degree of persoi al and individual llbcrty

Strange Events That Surrounded

By an Eye-WitQess of the Assassination of Reya Barrios.

It was not that fact alone that drew
my attention toward him. His unusual,
light, magnificent physique and clean,
sharply delined features made him
stand out in bold relief in a room
filled with swarthy, thick-set Span
iards.
"The Jefe Politico told me," said one
Of the billiard players, "that President
Barrios has received three warnings
that an attempt will be made to as

"As well to-night as any other time,"
chimed in another: "it's bound to come,

- 'Sh!" came in warning whispers.
One of the director-generals entered
the room and walked through, in the

applauded, especially the Americans.
The third time she came out seven
letters appeared. Hisses and groans
came from all parts of the house.
Why? The letters spelled 'B-a-r

at first they were hissing at her. The

"That night Barrios - probably

'Barrios' appeared on the curtain of
the opera-house and how differently
it was received. It would be strange if

the end."
'As with the uncle?" queried a
newly arrived American.
Looking back in the light of buc

hi? evident disinterestedness, Zollinger
listened more intently to my explana

"President Barrios is the nephew of
a former President of Guatemala,
Justo Rufino Barrios. Rufino Barrios
ruled Guatemala with an iron hand.
Hp was a handsome man, quick to
think and act, bold and determined.
The second year of his presidency he
happened to visit Quezaitenango.
Am< rig those who assembled to do
homage to the President were the pu
pils of the Convent of the Sacred
Henrt. One of them attracted the
President's notice. She was Francesca
Aparicio, half Spanish, half Indian, but
remarkably beautiful. "I shall marry
that girl,' exclaimed the President.
"And forthwith he sent word to her
father, Senor Juan Aparicio, demand

" 'She is too young,' insisted the
father.
" 'Two years from to-day,' replied
the President, after a moment's
thought, 'I shall marry Francesca.'
"Her brother Juan, who was pres

be too youngâ barely 15 years old.
Juan was promptly arrested and cast
into prison, but shortly released.

PICTURE ILLUSTRATING THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF FOOD CONSUMED BY A MAN IN HIS LIFETIME
INTERESTING calculations made
recently by a German statistician
go to disprove the well-worn ad
age of Goldsmith that "man wants
but little here below." Man wants
a good deal, and that is made evi
dent by the quantity of food he con
sumes in a lifetimeâ the food that goes
to form the basis of his physical life.
Somewhat surprising in regard to
â weight and quantity is the substance
consumed in a single day by the ordi
nary human being with a healthy ap
petite. When the quantities consumed
in weeks, months and years are calcu
lated and presented to the eye in strik-

position to his demand for Francesca.
"True to his word, Rufino Barrios
married Francesco Aparicio two years
from the day he first saw her in Que
zaltenango. Not long after his mar
riage Barrios conceived the scheme of
the unification of Central America. In
this he was prompted by his little con
vent wife, who was even more ambi
tious than her husband.
"In the yeara of revolutions and in
trigues that followed Reyna Barrios
was his uncle's right-hand man. In
the spring of 1885 President Rufino
Barrios proclaimed the unification of
the Central American republics before
the people assembled on the plains
about Guatemala city. Young Reyna
Barrios, risen to the rank of general,
led the artillery in review past his un
cle. The President appointed himself
Dictator amid wild cheers.
'â¢That night there was a special per
formance at the opera-house here. I
don't think there had been ever such a
gay and brilliant audience asembled in
this city. The officers were there in
Their brilliant uniforms, the ladies in
evening gowns gleaming with jewels,
and in one of the boxes blazing with
diamonds sat Francesca Barrios, on
one side of her her husband, the Dic
tator, on the other, his nephew, Gene
ral Reyna Barrios.
"Well, at the close of the perform
ance the curtain was rung down, and
in huge letters across the bottom was
the name 'Barrios.'
"The people went mad. They cheered
Rufino Barrios. Dictator of five Central
American republics. They sang praises
of his wife, Francesca Aparicio Bar
rios. They applauded loud and long
for General Reyna Barrios.
"What a contrast was this scene to
the hisses of the other night at the
same theater.
"Each one of the Barrios family was
then called upon, and their words were
cheered to the echo by the audience.
"Suddenly the shouts of joy changed
to cries of terror. In some manner the
curtain caught fire from the footlights,
and the flames burned off the name of
the Dictator before the fire could be
extinguished.
"It was prophetic!
"The next night General Barrios, with
20.000 men, Reyna Barrios second in
command, marched against Zaldlvar,
President of Salvador, and on the Sal
vadorean frontier the Guatemalans, af
ter a severe struggle, routed the Bal
dorean army. Dictator Barrios rode nt
the head of his victorious army and
enjoyed but one brief moment of tri
umph, for the next he lay dead, shot
by a concealed Salvadorean.
"But another Barrios lived, and from
Minister of War he rose to be Vice-
President and finally to the Presidency.
"Francesca Barrios, with the im
mense fortune left by her husband, took
her children and moved to New York.
She has married again and is now the
Marchioness Vistabella. They say she
will never forgive President Reyna
Barrios because during the last revo
lution he ordered her brother, Juan
Anaricio, killed. Aparicio was supposed
to favor the anti-Barrios party, but it
had never been proved."
Zollinger got up here ar.i left the"
room. A Spaniard who had saunterea
over to us said: "Don't you know that
that fellow who just left has charge of
the Aparicio plantation. They say ha
wae very fond of Juan Aparicio."

These startling analogies are of the
nature to delight the hearts of doctors
who maintain that men are accustomed
to eat far more than is necessary to
sustain their bodies. The calculations
given below are made from estimates
of the food consumed by a person in a
lifetime of seventy years, with a

nourishment. With a proper allowance
for the years of infancy and old age,
when the amount consumed is de
creased probably one-half, the esti

In sixty years, therefore, a healthy
man consumes daily at least a pound
and a half of bread food, in the form

BEFORE THE GUARDS COULD RAISE THEIR RIfLES THE ASSASSIN HAD SHOT DOWN THE PRESIDENT.
as we walked out of the hotel to
gether.
At the corner we parted, and I con
tinued my way alone. The streets were
almost deserted, and. as I walked I
mused upon the' chances of the assassi
nation of the second Barrios. 1 thought
he could be in no immediate danger,
for he realized his perilous position
and would guard against treachery.
Within a block and a half from the
Presidential mansion I took out my
watch to note the time. It was 5 min
utes past 8.
Approaching me I could distinguish
three men. As they neared I recog
nized the President in his long military
overcoat, followed by guards.
When I reached- the building for
merly occupied by the German legation
thÂ»- President's party was directly op
posite.
Suddenly I heard rapid footsteps;
there was a flash, a quick report and
the President fell.
I still had my open watch in my hand
and mechanically glanced at it. After
ward I remembered that it was exactly
so because he prefers that mode of life.
So if you touch his vulnerable spot â
not his heart, but his exchequer â and
tax him, grading the tax from the years
of youth to a larger tax as age suc
ceeds, you not alone assist the State,
but possibly force him from his opin
ion and lead him, or rather cause him
to lead, a bride to the altar.
I yield to none in my knowledge of
the Insuperable infelicities which oc
cur in some married lives, and admit
that some are due to early marriages.
By early marriages I mean marriages
which are consummated when the bride
and groom are not of a sufficiently un
derstandable age to appreciate the life
contract into which they are about to
enter. Yet it is my impression that a
young man at 22 has a sufficient idea
of the step he is about to take to view
that as about the period of life when
of bread, rolls, biscuits, etc. The com
bined quantity for six decades would
weigh about 60,150 pounds. Molded into
a loaf of bread the giant loaf would
occupy a space of 440 cubic meters.
If one eats daily about three pota
toes, with a combined weight of one
fourth of a pound, there will have
been consumed in a lifetime a giant
potato that would almost fill a rail
way passenger car, and so heavy that
a corps of porters would be unable to
unload it.
Vegetables consumed In the same
period present a no less formidable ar
ray. In sixty years one person de
vours a half million peas, and Lf these
were imagined In a single pod it would
take an hour's tramp to traverse the
length of the giant vegetable. No less
massive would be the carrot con
sumed. Lettuce leaves, by the same
calculation, would cover the floors of
twelve rooms, while the quantity of
cabbages, beans and minor vegetables
would fill twenty farmers' wagons.
Taken for granted that an ordinary
consumer eats daily for breakfast two
8 minutes after S.
A second later came another shot.
I ran across the street. One glance
at the President was sufficient. He
was dead.
Fleeing in the tpposite direction was
a tall form that looked familiar. The
guards were running after the assas
sin. There was now one but myself to
stand watch over the dead President.
Before the end of the block was
reached another figure and then an
other joined the guards.
I remember 1 thought they must be
policemen who had heard the firing.
A few feet ahead of the pursuing crowd
and running fast I could make out the
tall form of th-- assassin.
Then came another shot. The assas
sin must have fa I en, for seven or eight
shots fnlhiwcd in .iuii-fc succession.
By this time the crowd was beginning
to "gather around the stricken Presi
dent's form. Several lifted it and bore
him to his home scarcely two blocks
away.
I hurried forward and joined the
crowd standing around the dead assas
a man should make a proposal of mar
riage. If within a year or two subse
quent â say at 24 or 25 years of age â
a man has not convinced himself of
the necessity of married life, why a
light tax ought to b.-^gin with the
twenty-fifth year, and be graded from
year to year, the tax becoming larger
as the bachelor becomes older.
Of course when a man arrives at the
proverbial threescore and ten it seems
as criminal to marry then as not to
have married when life blood was at
its best, the physique the strongest and
the intellect acutest. I should as
strongly advise against a marriage
after sixty-five as I would against one
under twenty. If the tax were graded
to a sufficient punishing extent, by the
time a bachelor would have reached
his sixty-fifth year erf age he would, in
my estimation, be considered as having
slices of ham or bacon, for lunch a
veal cutlet and for dinner a half
pound of beef â an estimate by no
means exaggerated â the following
startling comparisons may be
evolved:
The rashers of bacon, ranged one
beside the other, would extend for
three-fourths of a mile. It would take
an hour and a quarter to walk past
the line of cutlets. The beef would
resolve itself into twenty oxen and the
pork into a like number of pigs.
Summed up, the combined quantities
of beef eaten would create a giant ox
79,380 pounds in weight and more than
sixteen feet high. Compare for a mo
ment this monstrous beast with the
tiny baby that will eat and digest the
former at the rate of one pound a day
in a lifetime of sixty years!
If to the meat consumed one adds a
daily portion of a half pound of fish,
there will be an additional amount of
22,000 pounds. There is also the little
item of 10,000 egps to be considered.
The amount of sugar and salt con
sumed can only be superficially calcu
sin. I edged my way to the front to
get a look at him and when I saw his
features under the blood and dirt I
turned sick with horror.
No wonder I had been struck by
something familiar about the fleeing
assassin. It was Oscar Zollinger.
"Who is he?" "Why did he kill him?"
came from all sides.
A planter from Quezaltenango pushed
forward. "He told me coining down
here that Juan Aparicio had been
foully murdered and that President
Barrios would some day suffer for his
misdeeds. He said Juan Aparicio had
I. sen the best friend he had on earth."
"He might have known," said an
other, "that ht_- could not escape."
"He was willing to pay the price of
death for revenge." replied the planter.
I reached the Presidential mansion
just as the carriage drove up with
A! me. Barrios, who had been staying at
her villa in the suburbs of the. city.
Every time I met lime. Barrios I won
dered whether she would not have
gladly exchanged her money and posi
tion to be again free and happy in her
girlhood home in New Orleans. It had
done sufficient penance for his mis
take in not having taken unto himself
a wife.
Regarding the two dollar tax con
templated by the New Jersey statute
I think the amount named too small.
The tax should be graded according to
the income and means combined of the
man who is taxed.
My idea about the money received by
the imposition of such a bachelor tax
would be that it be distributed among
tl>e brides of the poor as wedding dow
ries, which, while being a tax on bach
elorhood, would place a premium on
marriage.
Now, as to the reverse. What about
a man who has been jilted? Should
he not have a rebate? If his is a bona
fide refusal of marriage, should he not
be entirely excused from paying tax?
Has he not completed his mission
lated. In estimating the amounts on
the basis of those declared necessary
for a year's provisioning to the Klon
dike and multiplying them by sixty the
result will give 9900 pounds of sugar
and lfioO pounds of salt. This would be
sufficient sugar to sweeten the rain fall
ing on an acre o-f ground. There would
be enough salt to model the figures of
t.^n men overtaken by the fate of Lot's
wife.
To complete the total it would be only
necessary to add a ton of butter and a
round of cheese about 650 pounds in
weight. Nor are condiments to be over
looked, when it is remembered that the
dabbing of mustard and the sprinkling
of pepper are continued for sixty years.
This adds to the list 100 pots of mus
tard and fourteen pounds of pepper.
Thequantity of fruit eaten is more va
riable. The apple of a lifetime would
be about fifteen feet, the orange and
pear about three and a half feet in size.
The plum would be so big and heavy
that the man who had eaten the fruit
would be unable' to move it.
Calculating, therefore, on a daily ra
been whispered that madame was un
happy. There were lines about her
eyes and mouth that seemed to bear
out this bit of gossip. But if it were
no his sudden death had swept away
all cold feelings.
"Reyna!" "Reyna!" she whispered in
a dazed, heartbroken way as they lifted
her from the carriage.
The crowd before the entrance of the
house confirmed her worst suspicions.
"He is dead!" she said, pitifully, and
fainted away.
The crowd parted and she was borne
within doors.
How Zollinger knew that the Presi
dent would venture forth at just that
hour was the question on every lip.
The only solution offered and the gen
erally accepted one is that by some
means he got hold of the telephone
message sent the President by a lady
requesting him to call at 8:30 that even
ing. Despite the protests of his officers
Barrios replied that he would come.
Complete quiet prevailed in the city
that night. While it was generally ex
pected that Barrios would meet such a
fate the end came from such an un
when he endeavored to take unto him
self a wife?
All things considered, I feel that the
one refusal of an offer made in good
faith should be sufficient to excuse the
man from the tax, because the entire
spirit of any proposed tax should be
that it is inflicted solely on the theory
that man must do what is in his power
to aid society in its moral growth.
If one believes with the poet that
"Marriages are made in heaven," I
can only suggest to the gentler sex the
advice of Cowper: â
Misses! the tale I relate.
This lesson seems to carry â
Choose not alone a proper mate,
But a proper time to marry.
This not alone would be a far reach-,
ing step toward the avoidance of the
contemplated tax, but would make the
seeking of divorce an exception.
tion of one and one-half pounds of
bread, a pound of meat, a half pound
of fish, two pounds of vegetables and
fruit and a half pound of divers other
eatables, there 'would be a total of five
and c-ne-half pounds of food a day, or
almost a ton in one year and fifty-three
and three-fourths tons in sixty years.
Liquids consumed by a human being
present a no less astounding result. A
half-pint of tea or coffee in the morn-
Ing:, as much water, beer, &c, at mid
day, and perhaps a pint In the even
ing, besides a pint of milk, tea, beer
and wine during the day, make three
pints per day, about five hundred
quarts a year, and in seventy years
35,000 quarts. It would take a vessel
2500 times greater than an ordinary
bucket to hold such an amount of li
quid.
Taken all in all, a healthy man with
a good appetite and moderate thirst
consumes in seventy years ninety-six
and a half tons of solid and liquid
foods. If the consumer weighs, say
150 pounds, he will eat and drink dur
iÃg his lifetime 12S0 times his own
weight. Transforming all this food
expected quarter that everywhere
groups of people discussed Zollinger's
motives.
As a rule In Central America the man
who kills a President is the man who
wishes to succeed him in office and it
v. as hard for the Guatemalans to un
derstand that a man would kill the
President to avenge the death of a
friend.
Whatever the people had thought of
Barrios living, they preserved a re
spectful silence as Barrios dead was
carried to his final resting place. The
casket was borne on the shoulders of
the army officers of highest rank, the
cabinet ministers and the dean of the
diplomatic corps attending. Along the
avenue lined on either side with soldiers
they bore the casket, followed by the
mounted police, the Indian school with
their band, the Jefe Politico, Justices
of the Peace, Director Generals, sub
secretaries, consular corps, magistrates,
the diplomatic corps, military band and
cadet corps in full dress. Directly fol
lowing the casket was the deceased
President's favorite horse. It was an
impressive scene with all the pomp and
military display fitting for one who had
so often led the army and fought, it
not always wisely, well.
And with Reyna Barrios, as with his
uncle, Rufino Barrios, the theater
had been the beginning of the
end. A strange coincidence. But
Rufino Barrios had left the thea
ter amid cheers and applause to meet
death on the field of battle. Reyna
Barrios, hissed by the people, had died
by the hand of an avenger. Still in
both cases on the eves of their death
the name "Barrios" blazed from the
stage of the opera house.
Another strange coincidence or prank
of fate, or what you will: There was a
strange jumbling of the number 8 in the
fate of this man whose career had be

Excluding the first twenty years of a
lifetime, the quantity of cigarettes con

a dozen every day would in fifty years
reach the number of two hundred and
nineteen thousand, or a monster rolled
cigarette more than sixteen feet in

which the tallest man would resemble
a veritable dwarf. A cigar smoker
consuming six of his favorite brand a
day would, during his lifetime, smoke
a gigantic cigar of more than sixteen
feet long and almost two and a half
feet thick. It would weigh 4410 pounds
and would take the suction power of a
steam engine to puff it.
As the smoking habit is not neces

THE EYE OF A GOD
WHEN tho strong arm of the law reached out
for Moung ouray and gathered in Hpo Thit
I, it was this way:
The gray Burmese night was thick when Hpo
Thit gilded like a snake up the steps of the
â¢ bungalow, and told Valentyne, the su
perintendent, that Moung Ouray had opiumâ many ballst
of itâ hidden away in his house.
"vVI" vVI M of Moung Ouray, Valentyne started a
little, for Ouray was Mi lira's brother, and Mi Mra she
â¢wasâ but this Is a story of Hpo Thit.
"How do you know of the opium?" asked Valentyne.
"Did you put the beastly stuff there yourself, and then
come to cackle of the eggs of your own hatching?"
"No, -sir. Abdul, who is a dog of a Mussulman, saw
Moung Ouray take it off the 'fireboatf which goes up the
river."
"Did AMiil, who is a Mussulman, see where Ouray
hid the opium?"
"Xo. sir; but will not a Eurman put his jewels In the
strong box that he keeps near his bed?"
â¢ There was a soft rustle just beyond the plaited bam
boo wall, close behind Valentyne's head. It was the sofr.
rustle of silk as MI Mra wrapp d the lemon-colored scarf
about her throat and slipped like a gentle shadow.- down
the back steps of the bungalow.
Valentyne pave a toss in his chair and coughed lone
and lustily. That was diplomatic, for jungle men, like
â¢Hpo Thit, have sharp ears. >:. -~

I STARTED in with the old cose of
one-eiÂ»rhth of a grain and soon in
creasr-d it to one-quarter, and be
fore my sickness was over I was
taking one grain every twelve
hours.
I thought I could not go to sleep
â¢without it, and, as T was working hard
during the day, and in water most of
the time, I took another dose, as it
braced me, up, at least for a few hours
I know now when I look back that had
the drug been hard to get I never would
have become a slave to it. I found
it in a country storo that car
ried a line of patent medicines and
poisons, find anybody could purchase it
In any quantity desired.
So, it being easy to get, I kept up its
use, and soon found I had to Increase
the quantity so as to produce the de
sired sensation. In two years I found
I was taking five and six grains every
twelve hours. I then made up my mind
to stop, but found it was beyond my
power to do that without some help. I
kept putting the trial off. I was in
creasing the dose, and in ISP4 I was
using fifty grains of morphine a day, or
twenty-five grains every twelve hours;
enough to kill forty of the strongest
persons to be found.
During the first few years I expe
rienced pleasure, especially when the
firug was taken at night. About twen
Before hje Turned and Ran b\e Fired the Last Shot in H"s Rifle at the Officer.
"TTp Is not got nflm." said the sergeant, and asked if
he should search further.
Before Valentyne could answer a fiendish uproar smote
upon his cars. It was as though the play and the whole
clash of bazaar noises bad been suddenly emptied into the
compound of the Phoongye Kyoung across the road.
It was a proper Oriental babe]; the cry of "thief" cut
ting through the general noise like a sharp-edged knife.
"The bazaar budniashcs (.blackguards) are killing some
one," the sergeant.
"We'll have to go and look into that first," said the
superintendent; "we'll come back here and finish the
search after. You must come too, Ouray, so that this
devil cannot say that you had a chance to hide anything."
That also was diplomatic; but it was the little slip of
losing track of Hpo Thit that gave the Nahts (spirits)
chance to work more mischief.
"Somebody Is murdering 1 a Phoongye" (priest), he said
to the sergeant as they reached the road.
Rushing into the pagoda he found the Phoongyes in
the temple clustered about the big Buddha, the "Beda
Buddha," as it was known.
The priests were prostrated at the feet of the great Im
age, raving and lamenting and shrieking in despair. â 
"What's the, matter?" asked Valentyne.
"A thief has stolen the Beda, the eye of the God, the
ruby:"
And they pointed to a great hole In the forehead of the
Buddha, where the sacred "Beda Kuby" had been for
twelve centuries.
How calm and dignified the alabaster god seemed, sit
ting there with his hand in his lap! Through twelve cen
turies of strife and passion, and blood and carnage, had it
looked with calm serenity upon the struggles of the little
men who had come and gone.
Twelve hundred years before had King T'zznna given
it to the Talopins of Panjaâ l'zzana, the son of Mienzaim,
and Poaza, the Chinese princess.
The seven great Kyoungs of Talopins which T'zzana
founded gained him great merit, so that when he died the
"Beda Buddha" worked miracles.
And now for twelve hundred years had the sacred eye
the "Beda Ruby," done even so.
Valentyne was horror-struck at the audacity of the
thief, for the Beda Buddha was the most sacred image in
all Burmah. Pilgrims came from all over tiie Burmese
tnipire to strike with the stag's horn the crescent-shaped
gong hanging there at its side, and then plead, with fore
head prone on the cemented lioor in front of the god for
the intercession of the Beda with Buddha Gaudama '
The Phoongyes watched it night and day, and how
any one had managed to steal the ruby Valentyne could
not understand. '
In the meantime Hpo Thit had glided silently back
through the crotons and into the bungalow once more
The very air was full 'of demoniac noises as Hpo Thit
slipped into the house, for the crows, aroused by the
Phoongyes' uproar, were screaming and shrieking in a bie
tamarind that towered high above the champac
Within all was quiet, and Hpo Thit loyt no time in
making his way to the bojc they had so lately searched for
the opium. *

He put it down in a corner of the teakwood box- then
actuated) by a sudden resolve, he picked it up, unrolled
the little piece of yellow cloth in which it was wrapped
and took a long, loving look at it. As he rolled it in his
hand near the Hickering cotton dip, the little room seemed
bathed in a flood of warm, blood-red light. Great ruby
tinted rays shot hither and thither, until the dazzlimf
brightness lighted up the uncertain gloom, and it was as
though red wine had been thrown hitjh in the britrht
noonday sunshine. " '
CONFESSIONS OF A "MORPHINE WRECK."
ty or thirty minutes after taking mor
phine pleasant sensations would creep
over me from head to foot â languor at
tended by ; leasant thoughts.
It would seem as if I was only half
asleep. My eyes would be wide open,
but would notice no objects around me
in the room. It was as if I were float
ing in the air. I could hear soft and
Eweet music, as If from an Aeolian
harp. Dreams that came and went
in rapid succession were of the pleas
antest. Again I would be in beautiful
gardens and among flowers. I could
hear the sweetest songs. Air castles
were presented to my view in countless
variety in all conceivable forms and
grandeur. :r" â 
During all these pleasant dreams and
half-awake thoughts I- could feel . the
poisoned blood tingling through . my
veins and making me feel as if I never
wanted to move again, and at the same
time the drug intensified every phan
tasm which my brain could conceive.
These dreams would last for three or
four hours and then I would fall into a
sound sleep. ' '
During the daytime the drug wouM
act upon my system in an entirely dif
ferent manner. About twenty min
utes after the dose I could feel the
blood rushing through my body and
giving me, as it were, more strength
and also a lightness of step which : I
had not before. , It would, at the same
time, dull my mind to all cares and
troubles, blotting â¢ out the darker side
of life and forcing me to think only of
the present. These sensations ; would
also remain for three or. four hours and
pass away. But .the : feelings were al- â¢

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
years that I used morphine.
About the seventh year I increased
the dose from seven to ten grains every
twelve hours, or twenty grains a day.
At first I did not experience much
change in the degree of pleasure, but
in a week or ten days I began to feel
restless when I was in bed and also
found it much harder to go to sleep.
When I slept I now had bad dreams,
and in the course of a month or so I
noticed that my nerves were commenc
ing to be unstrung; my hands began
to twitch and my arms to jump: very
often when I was sitting and perfectly
quiet my head would be jerked to one
side or backward. "While I was asleep
at night I would jump in bed; my limbs
and arms would contract with a jerk
that would shake the bed, and on two
occasions the shocks were severe
enough to break it down. Thinking to
overcome these I increased the quan
tity of the doses, and at the same time
I was increasing the evil effects.
I was now using from thirty to thir
ty-five grains a day. I think of the
awful days and nights that I passed,
and I wonder how it is that I am. alive;
or that I am not an inmate o-f some
asylum. I could not sit five minutes at
a time without my eyes closing â with
out my head falling forward, only to be
jerked back again as by some unfore
seen force. My hands and arms
twitched and jumped, in spite of me,
worse than ever. I did not know what
to do. I became alarmed, and. of
course, like all other "fiends," took more
morphine, and not only increased
the dose, but took it oftener. I now
made it my business to take ten grains
It was the stolen ruby; the night was being made
hideous with the din across the road in the Phoongye
Kyoung.
There was so much of terror, so much of menace, in
the hoarse roar of the Phoongy.s. and the crowd of Bud
dhists who had been attracted by their cries, that his
heart failed himâ ho dropped it again in the box, and
passed silently, swiftly out into the Burmese night.
As he disappeared a small !:?ure glided out from be
hind a Penang mat which serv> I as curtain to a doorway,
and, kneeling over the box, searched fur that which Hpo
Thit had nut there.
It was Mi Mra. "Ho, ho, Hpo Thit: because "Moung
Ouray told Mi Mra that you are always smoking at the
opium and because of that Mi Mra wauld have nothing to
do with you, you would have Valentyne Thakine make a
thief of Moung Ouray.'
Then she disappeared behind the curtain ngain, and
the oil dip flickered lower and lower, and only the outside
clamor crept into the houst â it was so still.
Soon there was tho steady tramp, tramp of men that
are accustomed to marching, and once more the superin
tendent, and the sergeant, and the police came up the
steps; and also were Moung Ouray, and Hpo Thit, and the
Phoongyes, and others there.
"I think that this is no end of a fool's game," said Val
entyne to the sergeant; "but we might as well finish our
search while we are at it. Where shall we looK first?"
"In the box, Thakine," eagerly interrupted Hpo Thit.
If the opium is not there, and he has the ruby, there
shall we find it."
So once more the Berffcant continued his Interrupted
search of the box. Then- was nothing beyond a pair of
Chinese patent leather shoes, a palm leaf Buddhist Bible,
and Houng Our.-iy's silken headdresses, muiiy or them
packed away in the bottom.
That the ruby was gone was a facer to Hpo Thit; first,
tho balls of opium had disappeared, but that he had at
tributed to Moung Ouray; nuw the ruby had vanished,
and Motlng Ouray had been with the police all the time.
Then he saw something which gave him a clew. It
was an innocent looking circlet of jessamine flqrwers lying
in front of the box. It was such a circlet as the drta
wore on their hair, and it hadn't been there when they
searched the box before.
"Of a certainty Mi Mra has taken the ruby," mur
mured Hpo Thit, "and has gone to the house of San Shwe,
who is her father. If San Shwe will keep it. there will it
rest; but if his heart fail him, then will he tell her to take
It to the police Thakine." There was no time to be lost.
tor it would be discovered that he had stolen it. and he
would also lose the ruby.
Slipping away from the others as they came out of
buÂ°m"uow Uray 3 house ' hu Quickly sped to San Shwe's
As he approached cautiously, he could see Mi Mra and
her mother and father sitting on the bamboo floor ear
nestly discusssing something. "They will decide; I will
The road 6 muttered> so ."*tting on, his heels at the side of
Then Ml Mra enme out, and started off across the
dried maidan toward the superintendent's bungalow:
That was Hpo Thit c chance.
"If you tell ;ibout it." he said, as he left her. "I will
swear that you and Moung Ouray stole it and gave it to
me. Then the judge Thakine will ask how you should
know that I had it, if you had not given it to mo "
Mi Mra went back to her father's house; she wanted to
think, wanted to do that which was the least trouble
In the morning she told Valentyne about It, and 'in an
hour he and the sergeant and a file of police were chas
ing after Hpo Thit. But Hpo Thit had gone. One more
dacoit had been created. His brother's, the ThugSe's
gun had gone with him. The Thuggie didn't know that'
every six hours or forty grains a day.
On the tenth night after I had com
menced to use morphine that way I had
retired to my room about 8 o'clock in
the evening and taken a dose, and
thought I would lie down on the bed
until it should begin to work on me,
and then I would get up and go out for
a while. I dropped into a sound sleep
at once. I remembered nothing until I
awoke at la. m. I was still lying
crosswise on the bed, but the head of
the bed was soaked with blood; my
hands and arms were cut in several
places, and I was cold and chilled
through; I lighted the gas, and what a
sight: There was not a pane of glass
in the window. Every onp of the eight
had been broken, and the frame was
smashed. I had thrown my alarm
clock through the window and also sev
eral other things which were on the bu
reau.
I tried to think and remember if I
had had a dream, but my mind was a
blAnk. I had risen in my sleep and
made sad havoc of my room and win
dow and then lay again On the bed. I
did not know anything o-f this until I
awoke three hours after it had taken
place.
From that time on, if there was ever
such a thing as "hell on earth," surely
I was in it. I could not sleep at night.
I would lie all night with my eyes
wide open, my arms ar " limbs jumping
around in the bed, and I prayed for
morning to come, when I knew I would
go to sleep. During what sleep I had
there appeared to me the most awful
eights and scenes that one could ever
for Hpo Thlt had stolen it. It was an old-fashioned, muz
zle-loading musket.
It is difficult to run down a Burman in the jungle, ana
ft was the next day before they came up with their
quarry.
He had a couple, of shots at them in a blundering sort
of way with the old musket without hitting anybody; but
just as Valentyne charged in on him at the head of his
police. Hpo Thit fired again at close quarters, and the
superintendent went down, shot in the shoulder.
Only for the sergeant Hpo Thit would have been
carved up into regulation slices; only for the sergeant
and Valentyne, too, for he bellowed out: "Don't kill him!
Take the beast alive!"
"Bring him here and search him at once," said "Valen
tyne, who was sitting up now, though feeling deucedly
groggy; and while the sergeant bound up his wound they
stripped Hpo Thit as clean as a whistle. But there was
no rubyâ nothing but much tattooing discovered.
"What have you done with the red stone?" asked the
superintendent; but Hpo Thit wouldn't answer.
Then they got back to Thayetmyo as quickly as they
could, carrying Valentyne on an improvised dhooly, in
the shape of a charpoy, which they got from the woon of
a neighboring village by the gentle art of compulsion.
When Hpo Thit was brought back by the police, he
was met by a reception committee composed of orthodox
Buddhists who were gathered together with the avowed
object of honoring him with the crucifixion.
To guard against his attaining Nirvana by a fluke, as
it were, he was to be crucified head downward.
Valentyne, who was very weak by this time, had great
difficulty in explaining to them that the government could
not allow such a thing to take place.
So Valentyne was taken to the hospital, and Hpo Thit
was put in a cage behind iron bars, just like the mangy
tiger they had seen down at Rangoon.
"I'll have the bullet Â«ut of you in a jiffy," said the
civil surgeon to Valentyne, as he rolled up his sleeves and
opened his case of shining instruments.
Then Hpo Thit was brought up before the Deputy
Commissioner for a committal hearing, as ft were,
charged with stealing the sacred ruby, and with attempt
ing murder of the superintendent.
But the priests were clamorous for the ruby eye of
their Buddha; for the matter of "Valentyne dying or not
they did not bother their headsâ even they -would let Hpo
Thit go free, so be it they could come by the sacred gem
again. The Burmese archbishop, the Thathanabalng, had
come down lrom Ava to see about the recovery of the
stone.
They begged the Deputy Commissioner to give Hpo
Thit promise of pardon if he would only disclose where he
had hidden the "Beda."
"1 can't do that," he said, "for the wounded sahib
may die; the doctor-fished for the bullet and can't get it
and it looks bad for the superintendent's life. If he dies'
Hpo Thit will have to swing." '
But if the Beda might be recovered they would pay to
Valentyne's family his full value in good English sov
ereigns. ' ,
The Deputy Commissioner was as anxious to recover
the jewel as they were; co he promised Hpo Thit that if
he would tell where it was it would help him much when
the time of his sentence "came.
it "I?' 11 - tell> " said Hpo Tnlt "because it will be easy for
the Thakine. to get it; and then the Thakine will remem
ber at the time of the sentence." em
t, Iflt ? OUr ,l was as silent as the graven Image of
Buddha itself, as they waited for Hpo Thit to speakf

his f a Cc in the form of supplication, Hpo Thit said: "Tha

fired it from my gun the last time, because I had no bul
Imagine. Dreams of falling from great
heights, often of being murdered, were
mine. Huge giants and goblins danced
around my bed, making the most
hideous faces and gestures. Horses
ran over me, and all kinds of animals
howled and snapped around my bed.
When I now think of the hideous
dreams and nightmares that daily and
nightly were ever before me I wonder
that I did not lose my mind. I had to
give up work. I was losing in weight.
I had the most dreadful pains across
my back and around my feet; The
blood that used to be sent rushing
through my veins was now stagnant
and would hardly flow. At times I
could hardly feel the beating of my
heart. My arms would go to sleep and
I would have to rub them for an hour
at a time and put my wrists in hot
water to get the blood moving again.
W.hen the effects would wear off
some I would commence to sweat, and
on the coldest days in winter, with six
inches of snow on the ground, hot per
spiration would stream from every
pore in my body. At the same time I
would be shivering with cold. Water
would run in streams from my eyes
nostrils and mouth. It would be im
possible to swallow. A lump 'would
arise in my throat, and if I tried to
swallow it would makct^ne feel like
sneezing, but I could not sneeze, and
the trying to sneeze and to swallow at
the same time would nearly choke me
These symptoms would remain until
I r iuld get another dose of morphine.

The Deputy Commissioner was in despair. Th^Fnoon
gyes. headed by their archbishop, haunted his office ana
his bungalow night and day; clamoring for the ruD> , ior
their sacred "Beda,'.' for the eye of their Buddhist goa. .
But the surgeon was obdurate. - : : ..- â  â¢ Â«Â«tÂ»-.
"Valentyne is a friend of mine." he said, .and I m
not going to murder him to please any yellow-robed
Phoongye. I wouldn't do it even if he were an enemy, l a
leave the service first." : .
Of course the Deputy Commissioner had to report it to
the Commissioner, and he to the Chief Commissioner. -_
Valentyne in the meantime had to be guarded at the
hospital, for Mi Mra discovered that the Phoongyes had
set a scheme on foot to kidnap him, and, incidentally,
carve him up to find the sacred stone. ;v"; v"
There were many reasons why they snould recover it
as soon as possible. Their Buddha had lost all, prestige
Bince his maltreatment, and no pilgrims came now to lay
their generous offerings at his great square, feet. The
pagoda had ceased to do a paying business, for. Uzzana's
ruby had been a drawing card. It had been a good invest
ment that for twelve centuries had gone on making money
for the priests.
Valentine applied for, and obtained, sick leave, handi
capped with an order that he must not â  take the ruby out
' of the jurisdiction of .the Burmese courts. . -,-â¢
It was a splendid bit of judicial ruling that, and the
Deputy Commissioner smiled grimly when it passed
. through his hands. - . â¢ â  ..,.-' A - . ; .
, As soon as he was able to sit up and move about he
I discovered a new source of annoyance. Devout Burmans .
-were constantly coming and prostrating tnemselves at his
feet, touching their foreheads to the ground and mutter
ing their prayers. .. â  .. â¢-. -...-â¢-, ,
"What does it all mean?" he asked Moung Ouray.
"Sar, they are worshiping the 'Beda.' which you,
the grace of God and that wicked HpoThit, have got."
"This Is Intolerable," thought Valentyne. "I am a ruby
mine, and a Burmese god, and a receiver of stolen goods,
all in one." '-.-.-â â¢â â â â â â â  â  . - â¢ â  - ?
As he got better the beauty of his new life was fur*
ther ' enhanced by the deluge of official correspondenca
'that commenced to pour in upon him.. ,-
By order of the Chief Commissioner he was asked to
explain how he meant to make good to the pagoda the
value of the ruby he was. still retaining on his person. It
was cheerfully pointed out that if hair his salary was es
cheated for this purpose it would take at least forty years
to make up the value of the jewel.
A delay of this sort would hardly be fair to tha
Phoongyes; besides, in that uncertain climate his salary
might cease at any moment. At any rate, under the flfty
five years' service rule he could not retain his position 1;*
the service for that length of time, and his pension would
be barely enough to live upon.
The civil surgeon was raked over*the coals for not
acting upon the Deputy Commissioner's suggestion and
probing the matter to the bottom as it were â for not
making another effort to recover the jewel. , â¢Â£-,-<.*
It was in vain that he wrote in answer that the su
perintendent's life would have been endangered by another
operation.
His answer only brought another literary wiggling, in
which he was curtly reminded that the British Govern
ment expected its officials to do their duty, irrespective of
personal feeling or considerations ofiporsonal safety. â :,
Then the Phoongyes got up a monster petition, signed
by all the Buddhists, living and dead, in the whole Bur
man empire. It was cleverly worded, having been drawn
up by a young Burman barrister, who was the gold medal
ist of his year in England.
The petition was to be forwarded to the Viceroy
through the Chief Commissioner, and prayed that the
Superintendent of Police, Valentyne, should be delivered
over to them that they might regain the most sacred relic
in all the Buddhist empire. .
. They were willing to pay an indemnity to his family,
but the ruby they must have.
For a time it looked rather blue for Valentyne, for the
Viceroy was a man who had great ideas about the rights
of the natives; in fact, he went in for. it very much as a
baboo plays lawn tennis, without much science in the
game, but with his whole soul and ponderous body dead
on the ball.
- - In the meantime a civil suit to recover the value of
the ruby had been instituted in the couita >n general, and
Valentyne in particular. M , ,
Luckily for Valentyne â  the Secretary of State was a
hard-headed man, not much given to nonsense, and he
said in equivalent official language "that he'd be damned
if he'd see an innocent Englishman deliberately cut up to
recover | any â  fetish â¢ bauble." i â â 'â¢ri'^.'-i-
But all the same the superintendent would have to be
retired on half pay, for his usefulness was gone. The two
â¢could not be combined; the dual position of Burmese god
and superintendent of police; for the natives still persisted
â¢in reverencing him. though ready as soon as the word was V
given to cut him ; up. \: ' . r " ' 'â '^ ; /Â\ : _ r i; ' y,
-.-.â¢- Just when he thought his troubles Were at an end, and ! -'
he might go home, they applied for an Injunction to pre- ~
vent him from moving the ruby out of Burmah. They
ehowed to the court on medical authority that there was
every possibility that the stone might work ; itself . out
some day, and so be recovered; but if Valentine were al
lowed to leave the kingdom the chances of the rightful
owners, ever becoming possessed ot it were very slim in
deed. . â 
They undertook to pay Valentyne a salary of 10,000
rupees a year so long as he remained in Rangoon; and all
they asked in return was the privilege of coming to wor
ship the Beda at certain periods, and that a medical offi
cer, appointed by them, should have free access to Valen
tyne's person, with a view to keeping track of the peram
bulations of the ruby; and that when it made its appear
ance near the skin anywhere, so that it might be extract
ed without danger to him, he would relinquish all claim
upon it and allow the surgeon to hasten its appearance.
Valentyne's counsel, seeing wWch way the wind was
blowing, agreed to accept this ruling of the court, only
stipulating that Corbyn should be appointed surgeon, for
the r.ether stone had suffered most In the grind, and Cor
byn was out of the service.
One little formality the court demanded; thr.t was that
the archbishop and three or four of the chief Phoongyes
should go on a bond for Valentyne's personal safety.
So the Superintendent was lodged in a beautifully fur- .
nished bungalow, and was treated very much like a dis
tinguished state prisoner.
Once he received an offer from- Barnum at a salary
which made his paltry ten thousand. look like pin money.
The enterprising American guaranteed to smuggle him â¢
out of Burmah, also, and pay all legal claims, too. . .
After he had been in the business about two years ha
began to feel a pain in his back. He confided his fears to
his attendant physician. "It's working out, I'm sure," he
said, sorrowfully. ~. â¢'
And so it appeared, for a distinct lump was forming
just below the shoulder blade. .
Then one day Corbyn made a discovery. It was only a
boil, the result of mango eating..- , " ;
. The Phoongyes were in despair.
Three years more of playing Buddha at the rate of .ten
thousand a year passed, and this time there could be no
mistake about it, so Corbyn said. The ruby was coming
right enough this time. It was coming not far from the
place where the boil had been; in fact, It was the irrita
tion of the Beda that had most likely caused the boll.
Everything was in readiness. The archbishop had
brought a sacred dish that was supposed to have at one
time belonged to Buddha Gaudama, to receive the
Beda in. ' >â¢â > ,,---,. â¢
Valentyne's back was bared: Corbyn made an incision
with his scalpel, pressed gently with the fore finger of
his right hand downward, and in a second it lay in his
left hand. - .--'.-
He gave it a little rinse In a bowl of warm water ha â â 
had ready, and held it up to the expectant gaze of the
many cranlne heads. â¢ . .
alt was a piece of oblong leadâ a slug. '
Hpo Thit had lied.,that was all, and had the ruby with
himâ at least, it was never found. â

and Tacoraa. I was on the night
freight and many times I have had
very narrow escapes from death. Often
I have gone to sleep on top of a freight
car, with my feet hanging over the side
and under the inlluence of morphine,
with the train dashing around curves
at the rate of thirty-five and forty
miles an hour. Once while I was stand
ing up on a car I went to sleep, and los
ing my balance I fell over, but I man
aged to catch the brake and so saved
myself. That was enough warning for
me, and so I resigned at once.
I was then using fifty grains of mor
phine a day, and I knew that I must
either let up some or die. There and
then I made up my mind to reduce the
quantity I was taking, and at one stroke
I cut the dose in half, taking only
twenty-five grains a day.
I suffered the agony and tortures of
hades for five or six days, but I had
made up my mind, and I would suc
ceed or die in the attempt. I remained
indoors and after eight or ten days I
had the victory. In two months I re
duced the dosâ¬ again, cutting it in
two and making it twelve or thirteen
grains a day. 1 had another hard bat
tle and won. After that I reduced the
quantity a little at a time until I ar
rived in San Francisco, the last of 1895.
when I was using only eight grains
every twenty-four hours.
I now began ro regain my health
and soon went to work for the South
ern Pacific Company. When I began
to use morphine I weighed 200 pounds.
I had to work now from 7 in the even-
Ing until S in the morning. I tried

very hard to drop off on the last eight
grains per day, but I could not do that
and perform my work. I found it hard
er to quit on the last eight grains
than all the other.
After a while the night work began
to tell on me and I once more began to
increase the doses of morphine so as to
keep up to my work. In a short time
I was again using twenty grains a day,
but I never got above that quantity
for the two . years I was with the
Southern Pacific Company.
I soon fell off in health and weight
again. I was worse than ever before.
I was reduced to 125 pounds. I was
afraid to go to bed, and when I lay
down I would set my alarm clock so
that it would wake me every hour. If
I allowed my arms to go to sleep it
would take three or four hours before
I could have any use of them. I would
have to get somebody to rub them for
me and bandage them and pour hot
water on the bandages. Often I would
have to hire some man to work in my
place for a night, for I would not re
gain the use of my arms in time.
Finally the pains in my back and side
and my arms got so bad that I had to
resign. That was in 1897, and I came
to San Francisco at once and took a
cure for the morphine habit, and In a
few weeks I was on the road to health.

Away back in 18G1 John Hite, a young
Virginian of good family but of reck
ts, resolved to make a radical
change in his mode of existence and
strike out boldly for himself. It has
been said, for John Hite was ardent
ptible even in the days of the
a bouts and wide collars, that a
disappointment in a love affair was the
touch which metamorphosed the
sf, ease-ioving, white-handed
young Southerner into a hard-working,
sunburned miner. but
bo or not does not
r at i his late day.
It suffices to say that he came to
rnia and after floating about
from place to place finally drifted into
Mariposa County, where, because In
these youthful days he was handsome
of face and figure, bold and merry in
his ways, generous and kindly in his
dispos'tion, he soon became a favorite
in the different mining camps which he
visited. The fact that soon after his
arrival in that region he "took up"
with a young Indian girl, after the
careless and irresponsible fashion which
obtained in those days among many
of the white gold-seekers, did not at
all detract from his popularity.
\\'hprever John Hite went in those
days his young squaw went with him.
Across mountains, down gloomy can
yons, through almost impassable for
ests, in sun and storm, silently and pa
tiently she followed him, with no
thought of deserted relatives or
lust friends, with no thought of
any one or anything in all the
wide world but the man she loved
iii ber cwn undemonstrative, steadfast
way better than all else in her narrow
world.
"Dig there," she said authoritatively,
pointing to a certain spot. "My fathers
found riuch that you seek here â dig!"
Hite obeyed her, and although his
faith was weak his blows were strong.
The Indian wife crouched beside him as
he worked, and when he paused, after
a few strokes with his pick, and. lean
ing on its handle, looked at her doubt
fully, she pointed again to the spot,
now a tumble of torn earth and broken
rock, and said again. "Dig:"

off by the labored breath of the worker
and the regular rise and fall of the pick
he wielded, and thenâ then the great
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1893.
SHOWING HITE The
Gold /^INE,
fHite mine of Mariposa County was dis
covered, and John Hite was started far
along the road which has led him to the
enviable position of a millionaire.
The companion of his long jaunts and
founder of his fortune did not live long
to share the wealth which she had be
stowed, for in less than two years she
died, and was laid to rest on the hill
side overlooking the mine which had
been brought to light through her in
strumentality. To her, at least, Hite
was not ungrateful, Â£or he erected to
her memory a granite monument twen
ty feet high, at a cost of $10,000.
It was not in the man's nature, how
ever, to live alone or spend any length
of time in vain repining for one de
parted never to return". The old chief
was father of another daughter,
younger and fairer than she who had
first attracted the miner's favorable
notice, and in a very short time he per
suaded the girl to take the place left
vacant in his heart and life by the
death of her gentle sister.
Tj>e girl Lucy was extraordinarily
handsome for one of her race, and her
lot had been an unusually fortunate
one. for she had been the favorite cHld
of her grim old father, and little if
any of the drudgery ordinarily per
foimed by the women of Indian camps
had fallen to her share.
Taken altogether her beauty was re
markable, and no one wondered that
John Hite, who had seemed to his first
helpmeet rather more like a master
though a kind oneâ than a lover, fell
passionately in love with this' younger
sister who was so greatly her superior,
and the superior of her tribeswomen
in appearance and intelligence. Hite
himself had reached the age of 40 by
this time, but he was still handsome,
dashing, light hearted and kindly.
Hite built a fine house, the finest in
the county at the time, situated about
twenty-five miles from the county seat
in one of the loveliest spots of pictur
esque Mariposa,* and installed his new
love there as head of the establish
ment. Nothing that he could purchase
was too rich or too handsome for her,
and she had more money put into her
slender little hands than she, with her
primitive tastes and unambitious mind,
knew what to do with.
For a little over a year the young In
dian woman was proud and happy in
her well-ordered and luxurious home;
innocently and ignorantly proud and
happy, for, secure in the love of her
white "brave," she troubled herself not
at all about anything else in all the
Mrs.Ceceli^ Mit&. II
world. Conventionalities were unknown
to her, and she never dreamed that
there could be aught of offense to any
one in her quiet and home-centered life.
Civilization, however, flourished apace
in Mariposa, and civilization brings
with it everywhere certain rules and
regulations the breaking of which en
tails at least mild reprobation upon the
offender. While white men alone ruled
the hills and canyons, and formed the
population of the mining camps, they
had never, though perfectly conversant
with the facts of the case, felt it neces
sary to interfere in any way, and had
never betrayed to Lucy that her posi
tion in their little world was not an
honorable and an honored one.
To mind one's own affairs strictly is a
lesson which men, thrown heterogene
ously together in new localities and
rough surroundings, either learn quick
ly and well, or suffer for not learning.
Women, however, are different.
So it was that with the advent of
white women poor Lucy discovered to
her horror what kind of a life she was
living, and that she was incurring the
scorn of respectability, and the cer
tainty of future eternal punishment for
herself and her companion in iniquity.
Too much frightened and shocked by
these revelations to even wait to dis
cuss the matter with Hite, who was
absent on business at the time, Lucy
did the only thing which seemed right
and possible to her in the light of the
knowledge which had ruined all her
happiness. She turned her back on all
that she held dear and fledâ where to,
no one knows.
"When Hite came home he found the
house deserted, ami frantic with grief
began a search for the lost one, which
extended through many weary weeks.
Then he learned that she was under
the protection of some relatives in an
other part of the county, but plead as
he might and did in his heart-broken
messages, she steadfastly refused to
return to her old home or even to see
him.
At last, however, when he threatened
that he would not even try to live
without her, her woman's heart re
lented and Fhe sent him this brief
word: "We have done wrong. Make
the future right and I will come back."
So it was he consented to make
amends for the past by marrying her
In the proper Indian form.
Under the circumstances she did not
desire to have a public wedding or any
celebration which would point out the
errors of the past.
To typify the old custom of pursuit
and capture Hite caupht her about the
waist and pulled her down upon his
knee, and holding hf-r firmly but gently
said, so that all arour.il might hear, the
magic words quoted, "Cunny ohak
meek." "You are my wife." That brief
sentence brought happiiess once again
into the Indian girl's Bfe.
That was early in the '70's, and for
twenty-three years John and Lucy
Hite lived together in apparent happi
ness and content. With the con

sent of Hite, who, though very
wealthy, knew well the uncer
tainties of mining life and property,
the ranch on which they lived was
made a homestead that Lucy might be
always sure of a home, and Hite stock
ed it with horses and cattle.
As for Lucy, she was utterly devoted
to him, and was never happy unless
in his presence. She was his constant
companion and helper, riding beside
him along the lonely trails which led
from mine to mine and camp to camp;
walking beside him when he made the
rounds of his duties near at hand.
When there was a "clean-up" at the
Hite mine she helped him carry the
gold to their house and guard it until
it could be taken to town.
Three times In those years she stood
between the man she loved and his
death by an assassin's hand, and saved
his life at the risk of her own, and
then â well, a savage woman who
spends her life in caring for another
instead of herself, who knows none of
the secrets of my lady's toilet table,
and in the line of what she thinks her
duty exposes herself to sun and storm
and heat and cold without a thought
of unbeautifying consequences, is apt
to lose her youthful graces of form
and face, and grow brown, and wrin
kled, and old looking in a score of
years. And there are always young
and pretty women who are glad to
smile on millionaires, even if they have
Indian wives at home, who are wear
ing out their lives in their service*, and
a young and pretty white woman, who
wears ilainty garments daintily, is
fitted to shine in society, and knows
how to flatter an old man into think
ing himself a dashing young beau
again, is a far more fascinating
companion than a middle-aged squaw
who has grown a trifle careless in -her
dress, and has scarcely more than one
Idea in the world, and that is to be
the willing slave of a man who no
longer appreciates the constant, un
selfish service of her loyal heart.
One day, now nearly four years ago,
Hite announced that he must go away.
By this time his interests were wide
spread; he had property in different
parts of the coast and also in Mexico,
and he was accustomed to leave home
frequently to attend to affairs else
where.
This time, with a refinement of
cruelty which made his victim's sorrow
more cruelly keen in the after days,
he told Lucy that he intended settling
nRS.LIjCYHiT^
up all his business outside Mariposa
in such a way that he need never leave
her for one of these long trips, during
which she felt so lonely, again.
"I am growing old, he said, "and I
want to come home and stay, and
spend my last days here quietly with
you. After I come back this time we
will have nothing to trouble or sepa
rate us hereafter."
So he went away and Lucy waited
patiently and hopefully at home. Af
ter three months she began to look for
his return and plan his welcome, but
week after week passed and found her
still alone.
"I stand at the door," she says, pa
thetically, "and lookâ so," shading her
eyes with her still beautiful hands â
"lookâ lookâ lookâ till my eyes get
tired and my heart as heavy as gold,
but he did not come. I look months,
years, but he never comes, but one day
came â this."
"This" is a crumpled piece of news
paper, a torn picture of a man with a
gayly dressed woman sitting beside
him, standing at a dinner table with a
full champagne glaes in his out
stretched hand, evidently giving a
toast.
It is a picture of a scene In a Kearny
s?treet restaurant at the wedding din
ner of John Hiteâ the millionaire-
John Hite. who had once again fallen
in love, this time with a young widow,
Cecelia Nougues by name, and a nurse
by profession.
It was a kindly neighbor who brought
the picture and the news to Lucy;
brought it to her up the path at the

TO TALK
ANYMORE
end of which the deserted wife stood
with her hands shading her eyes look
ing, as she had never ceased to do, for
the absent Hite.
The shock did not kill her; she had
lived through a shock almost as heavy
in her youth, but it changed her nature.
For the first time in her life she began
to think of herself. She did not want
revenge, but she wanted justice. To
her the Indian marriage which Kite
had repudiated after more than a score
of years was sacred, and had given her
not only the duties but the rights of a
wife, and in this view of the case many
of the people of Mariposa County sup
port her.
Her self-sacrificing, kindly, blameless
life has won her friends who are glad
to help her in this her time of need.
Feeling that her cause is just she has
brought suit in the Superior Court
against the man to whom she gave the
blind devotion of her best years for ab
solute divorce and a division of prop
erty.
Poor though she is. for Hite shared
no portion of his wealth with her, and
her only property is the run-down
ranch in Mariposa County with its di
lapidated house, fitted with furniture
â which was new in her bridal days, she
does not lack for powerful champions
F. J. Castlehun of this city, who has
been %lr. Hite's attorney for many
years, declares that the whole story of
Lucy's marriage to, and, desertion by,
his client is untrue. Mr. Hite, he says,
is quite willing to submit the matter
to the caurt.

GOOD STORIES OF THE STAGE
By Marcus Mayer.
THE other day in running over
reminiscences of famous stars of
the stage Marcus Mayer of im
presario fame told the follow
ing stories:
"Adelaide Neilson and Sarah Bern-
Tiardt were among the jolliest of the
lot. Sarah Bernhardt was the greatest
money-maker. Who was the easiest to
handle? Well, as a general principle,
the greater the star the better I got
along with him. Mary Anderson, for
some reason, was very difficult to han
dle. The most genial was poor, dear
old John McCullough.. All in all,
though, they were a great lot. Fancy
handling the business of such people
as Adelaide Neilson, Christine Nilsson,
Sarah Bernhardt, Adelina Patti, who is
now a bona fide widow; Booth, Law
rence Barrett, Henry Irving and Ellen
Terry, John McCullough. Coquelin and
Jane Hading. Etelka Gerster, Mary An
derson, Joseph Hoffman, the boy pian
ist; Sarasate, d' Albert, Gerardy. the
'cellist; Stavenha^en. Olga Nethersole,
Langtry. Albani, Scalchi, Marcella,
Sembrich. Tamagno, Mapleson's Her
Majesty's Opera Company, andâ don"t
let me forget her - the Menken, the
greatest Mazeppa the world ever knew.
"Menken is somewhere in the here
after I wouldn't like to say where.
Tes she was a wonderful woman.
4.da'h Isaacs Menken! In her day she
had at her feet the most noted men on
two continents. I struck up with her
In San Francisco, and from the mo
ment she made her appearance there,
every leading woman in the Frisco
stock companies wanted to play Â«aa
Â»eppa â¢ It was way back in '6a. you
know I've been in the business for
thirty-five years. The first who got the
â¢Mazoppa' fever was Agnes Booth. She
was Agnes Land then. Then Emily
Jordan, who is now Mrs. John Cnam
berlain of Washington, was stricken
with it. The next to- succumb to the
awful fascination was Mattie Field,
who is now one of the Salvation Army
lassies of Booth's London forces. But
none of them was like the Menken.
Adah was as brilliant as she was hand
gome: and yet she* was a woman of un
common mentality and an actress of
amazing power. She was a Louisiana
<jirl born about 1835. She was a beau
ty, with the whitest, pearliest teeth,
lustrous eyes, rich, red lips and beau
â¦iful dark, wavy hair. At 20 she was
* ballet dancer; at 23 she was a full
fledged tragedienne, and at 24 she was
a wife for the first time. Her husband
was Alexander Isaacs Menken. She
married him in Nashville, left him soon
afterwards and took with her nothing
but his name, which she m^de famous
the world over.
"She soon fell in with that noted
fighter and physical giant, John C.
Heenan. She married him at Rock Cot
tage, a former roadhouse in New York,
within six months from the date of her
separation from Menken. They were
haf'py for a little while; a boy was
born to them, and Heenan then left
her. Heenan was just preparing for
his great fight with Bayers, when 'the
Menken' returned to the stage and
appeared at the Bowery under the
name of Mrs. John C. Keenan. The big
pugilist was mad with rage, but he
couldn't trump her trick. She went
through the North as Mrs. Heenan.
The pugilist soon after sailed for Eng
land, and during his absence sheTorm
ed her third alliance. This time she
chose R. H. Newell, the "Orpheus C.
Kerr' of old-time Journalism. He made
her promise that she would quit the
stage. This she did for six months,
and then she was back, playing 'Ma
zeppa' and "The French Spy' before the
California miners at 5500 a night. She
appeared for sixty nights, and the
journalist couldn't stop her. She sepa
rated from him and took up with Jim
Barkley. the gambler. He was flush
in those days and so was Menken. Her
California engagement, which I man
aged for her, netted $30,000. Then she
was stricken with the European fever,
and, with Barkley, set out for London.
Kerr went back to New York a discon
solate, broken-down man.
"I met Menken afterward at the
"Westminster Hotel, London. There she
and Barkley gave dinners to Swin
burne, Dickens, Charles Reade, John
Oxenford, Fechter. George Sand, the
Duke of Wellington, the Duke of Edin
burgh, the Duke of Hamilton, Jenny
Lind. Watts Phillips, Belle Boyd and a
host of lesser lights. Swinburne be
came the warmest of her adorers;
Dickens praised her literary skill and
edited her poems for her, which were
produced in Europe afterward in half
a dozen tongues. She had her team,
with liveried coachman and footman,
and for a crest she used four aces, sur
mounted with a horse's head. They
called hor the 'Royal Bengal Tiger' in
those gay days at the Westminster.
At Astley's. where Boucicatilt had just
failed, she drew enormous houses, and
she was as equally successful in the
provinces. She came back to this coun
try only twice after that â once to get a
divorce from Kerr â it was an Indiana
divorce. I beliveâ and another time to
visit Barkley, who had returned to his
gaming tables. He was still fond of
her, and showed it by marrying her.
He gave her a house on Seventh
avenue, New York, which she called
'PLORENCE WOLCOTT ATThETIVOU
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 13, 1898.
'Bleak House,' in honor of her friend,
Dickens. Then she went back to Eu
rope to conquer Paris. A French ver
sion of 'The Pirates of Savannah' was
made for her, and the "Gaite' was her
stamping ground.
"The Princess Jerome and Lucien
Bonaparte fell in love with her, and so
did the elder Dumas. Everybody went
to Bee her, and the Third Napoleon be
came so smitten that Eugenic grew
jealous. It became a matter of com
ment before many days. Dumas made
the actress a companion of his pet
daughter. But Bhe was like the rest
we wot of. She died penniless, after
having squandered an enormous for
tune, and the leeches of her prosperity
did not even follow her to her lonely
grave in Pere la Chaise. Barkley, the
gambler, and Ned James, an old friend
with little money, had her disinterred
and buried in Mount Parnasse, under
a granite monument.
" 'I come back to America to renew
old and tender friendships,' was one
of her stock phrases, delivered with
that ingenuous frankness and sweetness'
that made her irresistible. Mme. Patti
was always well received here. It
has been "said that her alliance with
Nieolini was looked at askance with
society, but I remember several ladies
calling upon her at the Southern,
among them Mrs. Joseph Garneau,
who was a beautiful young matron
then.
"The first time she came over here
she sent a Frenchman, named Franchi,
to arrange her tour. He made a holy
mess of It. He engaged halls, and
placed the price of tickets at $10 a
piece. A couple of concerts convinced
the diva that she was in bad hands,
and Abbey managed her and I became
her front-of-the-house man. No, Ni
eolini never was a favorite. His man
ner was always constrained. But he
was Patti's Nieolini, so let it go at
that!
"As a rule, Patti was a good na
tured star, and easy to handle, but
there was a time when she did get
into a rage. Mapleson. who hr.d her
in tow that sfascn. had an operatic
war on his hands, and overslept him
self at his New York hotel on the
morning when his song bird was ex
pected to arrive. The Gallia steamed
up the bay and Patti was landed on
the wet docks, pattered around, looked
for a carriage, and stamped her little
No. 2 foot. Nieolini, dragging a
brown Senegal monkey by the collar,
shouted down the wharf for a car
riage. They stormed around for a
while, and finally were bunched into a
friendly hack and driven to the Wind
sor, where Mapleson was still snoring.
There was an explosion when he awoke
and found what he had done, but
things were soon arranged and peace
restored.
"I had Just one little 'tiff' with Lang-

"It wasn't very long: ago my old
friend Ed Buckley died. He was as
sociated with me in the old California
days. I had gone back to the Alta, of
which paper I was city editor. Just
to keep in line. I conducted a little
amateur Company, of which Buckley
was a member. When I came home
from the office, dead weary for sleep,
Buckley, who was my roommate,
spouted 'Shakespeare' at me until I was
nearly frantic. One day an actor, named
Beatty, came round tv the office. He
saiil he had been directed to me to fur
nish him a super who could play small
I arts. I immediately thought of Buck
l'-y and recommended him. Buckley
agreed to go, provided I went along â
the company was playing a number of
towns in the State â and I went for the
fun of the thing. We made the jour
ney on the boat, and I remember there
was no supper, much to the disgust of
my friend Buckley. When we arrived
at our destination, I had to loan him
half a dollar to patronize one of the
booths along the wharf, where he filled
up on coffee and cakes. Buckley was
engaged at $25 a week. The first night
he played a small part, on the sec
ond night he was cast for the heavy
villain, and at once struck for higher
wages. That v;a.s the beginning of his
career, and he was in his glory when
he traveled with the Booth and Barrett
combination.
"That sweet little song bird, Etelka

-was well liked here in the old Maple
son days. Yes, Campanini, Valleria.
Larrarini, Del Puente and Castlemary
were with Gerster, and at their best
then.
"I had a time to keep Del Puente
away from sentimental misses, who de
luged him with billets-doux and bou
quets. The handsome baritone had a
very tall and scrawny wife, who was
frightfully jealous of him. She nearly
raised the roof oS the Lindell Hotel

"The next night he had a part which
permitted him to get away from the
theater before the close. I w-as in
front of the house and saw Del Puente
stalking outside the Olympic, taking a
place between the lamp posts and lean

* 'I "won't be through for half on

pretty girl had driven away in her

Mayer- it's cold out here, and the ma

He was showing off his wife, and the
sight of her was enough to discourage
any love-struck damsel who had a.
grain of sense."MINSTRELS, VAUDEVILLE
AND A SPEECH OF
SIR HENRY IRVING'S.
What I miss most in the Primrose &
Wes,t Minstrels is Mr. West. They
have a new interlocutor this time, Mr.
B. S. Cairns, a fine figure of a man
himself, large, genial and really assist
ful to the end men and their jokes, but
still a long jump short of Mr. West.
Mr. Cairns has not that beaming pride
â which so distinguished Mr. West from
other interlocutors; he does not seem
assured that the world is his; he has
legs that make quite a seemly show-
Ing in their silken hose, but he seems
never to be enthralled by them; he
scarcely notices them at all, in fact;
and he fans himself in a practical bus
inesslike way, quite different from the
lures and blandishments with which
Mr. West used to invest this innocent
affectation. I never can think of Mr.
West apart from his sumptuous person
and the arch delight he took in it. To
him the world was always fresh and
glad so long as he had his health and
his beauty and those splendid legs and
heaving shoulders and just that hint
of gentlemanly embonpoint beneath the
waistcoat. He is a strange institution,
anyway, the Interlocutor. I remember
in the old days when the interlocutor
would sometimes be the bass singer,
too, and would herald with fine speech,
not only the efforts of the boy soprano,
the London tenor, the Russian barytone
and the fabulous comic singers, but his
own turn as well with impartial en
thusiasm; and would belch forth in
deep, abdominal tones "Rocked in the
Cradle of the Deep" or some grim bal
lad that dealt in grave diggers and the
dead. I remember one of these basso
interlocutorsâhe was a gigantic fellow,
close on to 7 feet and with a voice on
him to lift a fogâ singing an embalm
ing-party ditty whose hilarious motto
was "Six feet of earth make us all of
one size." It got so that undertaking
by land and sea were Inseparably asso
ciated in my appreciation of the inter
locutor. I used to wonder when the
end men found the heart to^make him
the cue and butt of their rude jokes,
when, as I thought, he could easily
swallow any one of them and comfort
ably bury the luckless devil beneath
the low D In one of his graveyard
pongs. But the world, the minstrel
shows and I aged together, and finally
I saw evolved the satin-upholstered
minstrels that obtain to-day, with the
handsome and harmless Mr. West In
the interlocutor's chair. I can't say
that modernity has improved the min
strel show, but I can say that in my
experience Mr. West is the most en
gaging personality that ever adorned
the modern performance, and I miss
him sadly.
â¢ â¢ â¢
At best the modern minstrels, for all
their fine clothes and scenery, are a
long way behind the old-timers in point
of characters and real fun. For several
seasons it was a trustful device of
Primrose and West to preface their
own spectacular show with a short
performance by real niggers. The nig
gers were exposed as the "horrible ex
ample" of minstrelsy in the past, and
the modern burnt-cork artists got the
applause and rich flowers. But this
was hardly convincing evidence of
the superiority of the new. When min
strelsy was in its palmiest day, when it
had individuality, local color and hu
mor unborrowed and all its own, the
minstrels were white, not black, men.
To-day It has no color, no individual
process; In fact the old traditions of
the business praoticaliy have been
abandoned until the performance is a
variety show pure and simple. Taken
from its own variety standpoint I
think the Primrose and West perform
ance quite as good this season as it
was last, and surely it fits the Colum
bia's clientele and prices much better
than it did the Baldwin's. But the
Bongs are notably weak. The only one I
can recall is Mr. Primrose's "Nigger,
Nigger, Never Die." and that although
byMetz.the man who wrote "There'll Be
a Hot Time," is lamentably easy to for
get; and the "living sheet-music" which
goes with this song is not oonspicu
ously alive either, as most of the coon
faces are bogus. The best work is done
by the Mowatt trio of Indian club jug
glers and George Wilson, the Inde
structible endman, who were here last
season, and E. M. Hall, the best of
all the old-time banjo-players.
â¢ â¢ â¢
At the Orpheum they manage the
living sheet music better by supplying
Babel with something close to the ad
vertised quota of live coons, but, as
in the minstrels, the act does not eet a
fair trial for the lack of a catchy song.
Sabel is all her old self and even a little
more; she sings ilka a steam whistle.
Bhouts like two, and is entirely some
thing immediate, galvanic and special.
This week she will increase the number
of coons to sixty-five and try ,a new song,

The most satisfying of the Orpheum
turnsâ and the whole bill is startingly
ahead of anything the house has of
fered in the last two or three dull
months â are supplied by the Jose quin
tet and Rudinoff the Russian. Jose
still retains the boyish counter-tenor
in its reedy superlative, and the quintet
is the best of its popular kind that I
have heard, although it does add weird
and impossible harmonies to the sins
already committed against Maecagni's
poor battered intermezzo. The Russian
is an all-round wonder; everything he
does is new and entertainingly valu
able. He is the one man I have seen who
can rivet his audience while he ex
ecutes a sketch, and his drawings, es
pecially those on the smoked tin, are
ahead of the usual vaudeville art, and
then he has a pretty trick of imitation
in the warbling of "nightingale'scourt
ship." and his shadow pictures are fu
riously vivid. Rudinoff is tremendous
ly versatile and a graceful, humorous
personality shines in all his work.

My mail tells me that the London
critics have been set wagging again,
and this time over no less person than
Henry Irving. The actor delivered a
speech at the annual dinner of the
Playgoers' Club, in which he said a few
things that, while true enough, admit
of strenuous reply. In these sly terms
Sir Henry comments on interviews
with and paragraphs about the mem
bers of his profession.
Some people who were intended by na
ture to adorn an inviolable privacy are
constantly thrust upon us by paragraph
ers and interviewers, whose existence
Is a dubious blessing, until it Is assumed
by censors of the stage that this busi
ness is part ar>d parcel of theatrical ad
vertisement. Columns of this sort of
rubbish are printed every week: and
many an actor is pestered to death for
titbits about his ox and his ass and
everything that is his. Occasionally you
may read solemn articles about the insa
tiable vanity of the actor, which must
be gratified at any costâ as though van
ity were peculiar to any section of tho
community! But what this organized
gossip reall/ advertises is the industry
of the gentlemen who collect it, and the
smartness of the papers in which It is clr-
culated.
At first blush this sounds noble and
justâ that fs. if you do not happen to
know that Henry Irving long has been
and still is the best advertised actor in
England; that no small measure of his
large success is directly attributable to
the friendly "paragraph," "interview"
and other "rubbish" written by these
organized gossipers "whose existence

of "Peter the Great" George Bernard

three lines of adverse criticism in the
Saturday Review would be of no value
to the Lyceum Theater.

Plavjs and players.
Poor Clement Scott! Nearly every
body has taken a whack at him since
that unvarnished interview about the j
morality of actresses. Only Bernard j
Shaw and Robert Buchanan were con- I
spicuously in the derense of their col
league. Shaw, with his usual open
ness, says that Scott told but half the j
truth, but that the parsons needn't read j
sermons to the stage on that account. !
as they would do better to look to their i
own congregation, who employ laun
dresses to shine and starch their Sun
day linen at wages that virtually com
pel immorality. Buchanan settles the
subject with a single epigram: "Twen
ty thousand virtuous women on the
stage, and only three actresses!"
Few people know that Scott wrote the
words of "Promise Me." Selina Do
laro, who is now dead, used to tell a
good story on the London critic. She
joked shamelessly about his infatuation
for her, and the climax came when she
explained how he used to write lyrics
for private circulation. One day, while
at luncheon with two other actresses
who were among the public favorites
of the hour, the three wimien began to
compare their notes.
"I say, girls," said Miss Dolaro, "a
new poem was sent to me this morn
ing. I'll tell you the first line. Then I
want you to guess who it sounds
like!"
With roguish twinkle in her eyes,
Dolaro struck a mock posture and be
gan:
Oh! Promise me that some day you and Iâ
But, without waiting to give her an
i answer, the second actress burst in
| hastily:
May take our love together to some sky â
: Then, suddenly, the deep contralto
! voice of the third actress intoned sol
j emnly:
Where we may be alone and faith renew
And find the hollows where these flowers grew.
j That was enough. In less than an
other minute those three women had
tried and convicted Scott of three-ply
deception; and the story of his duplic-
I ity â thanks to the vivacity of Miss
j Dolaro's tongue â was soon a standing
i joke in every club in London.
And this all took place years and
1 years before Reginald de Koven had
discovered the poem, and, with the as
sistance of Jessie Bartlett Davis made
I it once more famous.
Richard Mansfield is endeavoring to
secure the American rights for Ed

produced at the Theatre Porte-Saint-
Martin, in Paris, last December, with
Coquelin in the title role, has been the
greatest French success of recent
times. The London Telegraph gives an
account of part of the play, in which
It says that the central character, Cy
rano, so admirably playedâ false nose
and allâ by M. Coquelin, is an ugly,
lovable, unselfish hero, who, when he
finds that his love for his cousin Rox
ane is not returned, and that she loves
Christian de Neuvillette, devotes him
self to the task of writing love letters
to help his rival's suit. Christian gets
killed in the wars, and Cyrano himself
is suffering from a mortal disease. In
a beautiful scene in the fifth act the
secret of the love letters is. at last dis
covered. Cyrano is, at Roxane's re
quest, reading the last message from
her dead lover. It is already dusk, yet
Cyrano seems to know the words by
heart. So the lady finds out the truth.
Roxane (putting her hand on his
shoulder)â How can you read? It Is
quite dark.
(He starts to find her so near him,
and his head sinks on his breast. A
long silence. Then in the darkness she
speaks.)
And for fourteen years he has played
this game I
Cyranoâ Roxane l
Roxaneâ lt was you
Cyranoâ No, no!
Roxane â I understand all the gener
ous imposture: The letters, it was
you ?
Cyranoâ No, no!
Roxaneâ The dear, mad words, they
were yours! The voice In the night, tt
was yours! The soul that spoke to me,
it was youra!
Cyranoâ No. no; I did not love you.
Roxane â You loved me.
Cyrano â No; It was the other.
Roxane â It was you. You loved me.
Cyrano â No.
Roxaneâ Already you hesitate.
Marteau's Hairâ Before and After Serving in the French

Cyrano â No, dear love, I did not love
you.
Roxane â Why for fourteen years nave

where he is nothing, these tears are
yours?
Cyranoâ This blood on the letter la
his!
Roxaneâ Then, why break this sub
lime silence of yours tt-day?
So the scene runs on witfi increasing
pathos. The hero is dying, but has
not been able to deny himself a final
interview with his lady love. At the
last he wins from Roxane's lips his first
and only kiss.

Roupeilâ Married happiness Is largely
dependent on mutual reticence.
Belle (the deserted adventuress to her
former lover)â There is no quality so
austere as the virtue of a man who has
seen some one else.
Old Sir Mostynâ Optimism is the intoxi
cant of youth and the narcotic of age.
Xigil (advising his erring friend to face
the consequences manfully)â The lives of

and bent. I..ay yours on the anvil and
hammer it straight again.
Monicaâ l should like to bring a little
happiness to you. Sorrows are often only
phantoms that will disappear If we let in

now doing one nig-ht stands, having ex

The "Mysterious Mr. Bugle," a play
that has received no little attention
from the Eastern critics and even from
the monthly reviews since its success
ful production at the New York Ly
ceum Theater, will be presented for the
first time at the Baldwin Theater to
morrow night. The play is from the
pen of Madeleine Lucette Ryley, who
also wrote "Christopher Jr." and "An
American Citizen," both of which found
much favor in San Francisco. In
"Mysterious Mr. Bugle" there is said
to be no attempt at sentiment or any
thing in the nature of a serious story.
For this good reason it is called a farce,
though it is said to be written in the
spirit of comedy and to appeal more
to lovers of the witty than lovers of
the silly.
_The humor of the situations is
evolved from the white lies of one
Betty Fondacre and the unreasonable
jealousy of her fiance, Tom Pollinger.
Tom having a wealthy but eccentric
grandmother to propitiate, persuades
Betty to keep her engagement to him
a secret, and, being of a jealous dis
position, he makes Betty pretend that
she is a married woman in order that
would-be suitors 1;p kept nt bay.
They agree that she shall call her
self Mrs. Bugle, a name they choose
at random. This causes Betty to tell
any number of harmless fibs which in
volve her in endless difficulties, one of
which makes her cousin, Allan Fond
acre, conclude that Tom Pollinger is in
love with Betty's sister Julia, which
discovery he confides to Betty. Out
raged at her lover's duplicity, Betty re
venges herself by telling Tom that
there really is a Mr. Bugle, and that
what he has supposed was a sham is a
reality. This brings matters up to
concert pitch, and the latter part of the
play concerns Tom's jealous anxiety
concerning the mythical Mr. Bugle,
who is not entirely accounted for un
til the final curtain rings down.
Prominent in the cast is Mr. Joseph
\ Holland, who has not been here for a
! long time, but who will be none the
less welcome on that account. Other
names more or less familiar are Gretch
|en Lyons, Wlnona Shannon, Agnes
i Findlay, Edgar Norton, Lucius Hen-
I dersc-n and Charles Collins.
California.
The California will be reopened to
nigrht with a revised production of
"Town Topics," a farce comedy which
was given at the Columbia a season or
two ago. A radical change has been
stage as a means to an end. While at
tending the art school at Munich he de
veloped his talent as an entertainer in
the little sociables among the students,
and when the time came that he found
himself short of means he then began to
turn his talent to account.
There is also a little romance in his
life. For a time Rudinoff retired to a
monastery, and it is said that some of
the sketches he executed on the wall are
still the wonder of the monks. He con
cluded, however, that his life as a priest
would not be a success and he returned
to the world and for a time was engaged
as illustrator on the Parisian magazine.
Later he took to the stage, and hopes
within a year to return to the art school
at Munich.

Alcazar.
"The District Attorney," a political
and social play written by Harrison
Grey Fiske and Charles Kline and well
known here, will be presented at the
Alcazar next week. "A Gilded Fool"
will be played to-night for the last
time. One of John Drew's successes,
"The Butterflies," by Henry Guy Carle
ton, will be given at the Alcazar in
the near future.
Titfoli.
With Sunday night's performance
the Tivoli's "Geisha" production will
come to a close and then good-by to
the prettiest musical comedy of recent
years and one of the most creditable
performances ever given by a local
company. The piece to follow is "The
Widow O'Brien," a howling farce with
copious musical interpolations.
Morosco's.
"The English Rose," from the pens
of Robert Buchanan and George R.
Sims, will be the production at Mo
rosco's this week. It is a picturesque
melodrama, with a judicious mingling
of pathetic and humorous scenes, and
was originally produced at the Adelphl
Theater in London, where it had a phe
nomenal run. Its success was repeated
when produced in this country. It made
its last appearance here at Morosco's
a little over two years ago. Its title
would hardly Indicate that it is an Irish
play, but it is, the scenes being locat
ed in the vicinity of Westport, a flour
ishing seaport town in County Mayo,
Ireland.
The plot has to do with the landlord
question and the rent riots, tbe sensa
tional element being in the third act,
when a tenant murders his landlord
and the hero is accused of the crime.
The comedy element which prevail*
throughout the drama is of a compara
tively superior order, and its Celtic hu
mor greatly relieves the melodramatio
incidents. A striking representation of
the ruins of Bally-Veeney â¢ Castle, a
view of a mountain road by moonlight,
and a representation of the famous
"Devil's Bridge" will be scenic fea
tures of the production. The cast is a
long one, requiring the full strength ot
the company and several additions.
OrpKeum.
In addition to the already strong bill
at the Orpheum several new attrac
tions will mark the new week. Prom
inent among them is Will H. Fox,
whose humorous impersonations at the
pianoforte have given him the title of
the vaudeville Paderewskl. Athas and
Collins have been brought from Aus
tralia for the Orpheum circuit. They
are classed as the very best of Aus
tralian vaudevillers and it is expected
they will make a hit. Burke and For
rest, whose work was so well received
here about one year ago, will return
with a dumber of new and good things.
The Orpheum has had cake walkers
and buck and wing dancing, all by
genuine colored people, but now come
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Mclntosh, a colored
team, who confine their efforts to
straight comedy.
The hold-overs include Rudlnoff,
whose smoke pictures, imitations and
shadowgraphing have made him a
great Orpheum favorite: Josephine Sa
bel and the human music sheet, with a
new line of songs, several of which are
entirely new to the Pacific Coast, and
the Jose Quintet in new selections.
Ghutes.
A big collection of wild animals Is
now on exhibition at the Chutes. There
are twenty-two lions, an elephant and
almost everything else in the quadru
ped line. Chiquita is still tnere, and
for some time will continue to- receive
every afternoon and evening. A good
vaudeville show is given in the Free
Theater, and this afternoon two per
formances will be given at 2 and 4
o'clock.
Olvjmpia.
The Olympla Music Hall offers a va
ried bill of music and vaudeville.
JVlarteau's Recitals.
Yesterday afternoon at the Young
Men's Hall Marteau gave the first of a
proposed series of independent recitals,
assisted by Lachaume, the pianist.
In an auditorium smaller than the
Tivoli's the playing of the young
violinist sounded to especially good
advantage. He repeated his tri
umph of Thursday by playing
again the first Bach sonata for violin
alone. He and Lachaume played a so
nata by Caesar Frank with fine effect,
and all the shorter pieces were received
with genuine applause. A second re
cital with an entirely new programme
will be given on Wednesday evening in
the same hall.

MAKING FARMS OUT OF INLAND SEAS.
THE tule marsh lands of the Sa n Joaquin will vanish. Already vast
tracts of bog and marsh land have been reclaimed, and the great dredgers
of the o!d River Land and Reclamation Company are rapidly turning
thousands of other acres that were once nothing but water, tules and peat
bogs into the finest land that can be found in California's borders.
To those who have not traveled over the immense tracts of reclaimed
land and witnessed the transformation from floating islands, vastreaches
of tules and ponds of yellow lilies to the fields where now is growing the golden
grain that is to be the salvation of the California farmer, these statements
may seem like some Aladdin tale. The fact remains, however, that the best land
ever discovered for the raising of garden truck and grain lies within those im
mense levees that guard from the water the once submerged lands along the
San Joaquin River.
All of this work has been done recentlyâ that Is. within the past year,
though the preliminaries were entered into long before the actual commence
ment of the drainage of the tracts. The great dredgers that had to be brought
into requisition cost thousands on thousands of dollurs, and now on one of
these is located the largest pumping plant in California, its capacity being
85,000 gallons a minute.
The work of these great dredgers, with their giant pumps, has entirely
changed the appearance of the tracts that He between Stockton and Bethany

When John Herd Jr. and Engineer Ferris broached the subject of putting
the bog into tillable soil many scoffed at the idea. One of the great features of
the work was the cutting of a drainage canal, three miles long, 100 feet wide
nnd ten feet deep, through the tract owned by the corporation. This is known
es the relief- canal and allows the rushing waters of the San Joaquin during the
winter months to escape without damasine the levees that have been thrown up
about the lands.

These levees are immense affairs and their building has Involved much la
bor and expense. They are uniformly twenty feet at the base and are fully .
twelve feet above water. They are sufficiently wide for a good wagon road to
be constructed all along their tops.
While the work of cutting the drainage canal was a great undertaking and
that of throwing up the big banks of mud one of almost equal importance, that
of pumping the water from the submerged lands was the work of months. First
the dredgers went along the San Joaquin River and into its tributary sloughs,
digging from the bottom the mud that was to form the levees. "When the lands
were enclosed with banks high and strong enough to withstand the pressure of
the waters from the river and sloughs the big pumps were brought into requisi
tion and the water and mud from the tracts enclosed by the levees were forced
by suction over in^> the river, leaving the land within dry and ready for culti
vation.
The extent of the undertaking may be judged when it is known that the
company has ten of these giant dredgers at work. It now owns its own river
steamer, on which it carries its supplies and employes, and a handsome steam
launch carries the engineers from point to point while inspecting the work of
making a garden spot out of tule marshes and peat bogs.
Travelers on the river steamers cannot realize the vast extent of these
marshes and bogs. From a point on the levee near the Government experi
ment station on Union Island some idea may be obtained, for what appears to
be a vast inland sea greets the eye on ascending the bank. It is dotted with
little islands that seem fixed and stable enough, but many disappear from time
to time and dozens of unfortunate hunters have nearly lost their lives in taking
them to be as solid as mother earth. It will not be long before this Inland sea
is no more, and instead the dollar a bushel wheat will be waving over the
spots that were once the favorite haunts of the duck hunter.
The company that Is engaged in this reclamation work does not sell any
of the land, but leases It to those who desire to farm large tracts on chares.

HOPES OF THEOSOPHISTS
IN POINT LOMA MYSTERIES.
WAGNER. In his soul music,
expressed the philosophy of
the world. Theosophy teach
es the philosophy of the
world. Therefore Wagner
was a theosophist."
Thus Mr. Crump, the latest exponent
of the doctrines of the Universal Broth
erhood. He was standing on the plat
form of the empty hall, where for a
couple of hours an audience had lis
tened entranced to the thrilling expres
sion of Wagner's great dramas. On
the screen before them they had seen
the knightly Lohengrin arrive in his
swan boat, and had watched his ro
mantic courtship of Elsa ending so
tragically because the demon of
do-Ã¼bt snatched the cup of happiness
from the maiden's lips Just as she was
about to drain it to the dregs. They
had watched the Flying Dutchman ,
plow her stormy track through the!
seas, and had heard all about the "in- j
ncr soul motives" which give the key-
note to Tannhauser, The Ring of the
Nibelung, Tristan and Isolde and Parsi
fal.
This was very interesting, not to say
fascinating, but still the music and the
pictures did not after all explain to my
darkened mind why the Universal
Brotherhood has taken Wagner so com
pletely into its fold. Wagner, in spite
of the mysticism of his work, never
claimed membership of any occult soci
ety; perhaps he never heard of the
Universal Brotherhood or the Theo-
Bophical Society.
But Mr. Crump's explanation makes
it all beautifully simple, and-following
the same line of logic, Milton. Shakes
peare, Goethe, every great thinker of
1 every age, can be claimed as a the
j osophist. Nothing could indicate more
' clearly the universality of this new sys
tem for the teaching of world-old
truths. Theosophy, we may say, has
existed ever since man became a rea
j soning animal, and it is only presump
â¢ tion on the part of us moderns to im
: agine it a new thing.
Still the combination with Wagner
ism, which is a very advanced musical
cult on its own account, is distinctly
new and so far seems remarkably suc
cessful.
"We have given this lecture," re
marked Mrs. Cleather, "in quite a
number of country towns, where you
would imagine the average intelli
gence was not up to the requisite stan
dard. But everywhere it has been well
received. The people seem to thor
oughly appreciate our ideas."
Mrs. Cleather, herself a disciple of
the great high priestess, Mme. Bla
vatsky, is a petite woman in a cream
colored gown of some marvelously
soft clinging material. It is the robe
of a priestess. There is something
ethereal about it, and as she stood on
the darkened platform, a gleam of
white against tho background of black
curtain, she seerried to have just mate
rialized from another sphere. This, of
course, is but pure fancy, for Mrs.
Cleather is practical enough in her
ways and knows how to carry her
propaganda into the midst of a busy,
hard-working world; how to bring the
truths she has to tell home with force,
appealing alike to toil-begrimed work
er and money-sodden plutocrat.
A couple of years ago there was a
wonderful awakening in theosophical
circles. Mrs. Tingley, the leader of
the Universal Brotherhood, started a
crusade around the world, Mrs. Cleath
er being a member of the party. There
were nine or ten people altogether and
it proved a pretty expensive trip, cost
ing ever $50,000. The American theos
ophists cheerfully footed the bill, for
there were substantial results to show,
seventeen new societies being started
in foreign parts and thousands of ad
herents being gathered into the new
scheme of philosophy.
It is estimated that there are some
8000 theosophists in the United States,
and that there is money behind the
faith is shown by the latest develop
ment, in which the State of California
is particularly interested. There are
riddles in psychology which none of us |
can "comprehend, there are latent
powers in man the existence of which,
except among members of the adept
fraternity, is never suspected. The
real action of thought, in spite of mod
ern scientific investigations, is still
concealed from us, the phenomena of
hypnotism, clairvoyance and thought
transference are but imperfectly un
derstood.
Latter day scientists, even men such
as the wizard-like Edison, cannot ex
plain these things, so the theosophists
are going to take the matter in hand.
Possibly we may know a good deal
more of these mysteries of ancient
times when the new college at Point
Loma, near San Diego, gets into work
ing order. For the cause theosophists
in all parts of the world have sub
scribed thousands of dollars, and there
is no doubt that the half million re
quired to complete the structure will
be forthcoming in due time. A little
over a year ago tijere was a great
gathering at Point Loma, when Mrs.
Katherine Tingley, as high priestess,
deposited, with all sorts of cabalistic
rites, an Egyptian onyx taken from the
Temple of the Sphinx in the corner
stone of the building.
And what is the good of all this fuss?
the Philistine, the man who dwells in
the outer darkness, will naturally in
quire. Well, of course, the college will
benefit only those who seek for the
light; it will facilitate inquiry into the
lost mysteries of antiquity. It will be
in short a sort of modern and purified
Temple of Eleusis. Useless for the
unbeliever to venture there, his lack
of faith will blind his eyes to the won
ders which are to be revealed. But
for the genuine student of occult af
fairs the institution holds out welcom
ing hands, and already numerous ap
plications for membership have been
received from all parts of the world.
Therefore, overlooking the bay of San
Diego, and close to the boundary of the
United States, we may expect before
long to see a college established unlike
any other which modern years have
witnessed.
But nut the least peculiar feature
I about the whole affair is that the site
| for the college was revealed to the high
! priestess, Mrs. Tingley, in an astral
j dream, so it is claimed. That is to
i say, she made a survey of It with her
j astral body, leaving her fleshly sur
i roundings^t home. And she was so
pleased nlh the situation that she de
cided at once to place the institution
there, and there, a costly edifice of solid
| marble and stone, it is to remain for
I all time.
Such experiences as these are not un
! common, according to the theosc-phists.
! Every now and again, from out of the
! hidden recesses of the Thibet Lamasa
! ries, where amid snowbound hills
the brethren of the adept fraternity
dwell, there comes a mysterious teach
er, who gives the cause a little shove
forward, and then retires to wait for a
new reincarnation.
Though the public performance of
miracles is rather discouraged by the
osophists, Madame Blavatsky, the
great founder of the society, did, as
Mr. Sinnett has told us, many strange
things. By reason of long study and
years of asceticism, some portion of
adept powers had been conferred upon
her, and she could, at any rate, create
missing teacups and saucers, and bring
little notes fluttering downward
through the air whenever they would
do the most good.
Years ago I met Colonel Olcott, who
aided Madame Blavatsky in founding
the Theosophical Society. The colonel,
a genial old gentleman, had many
strange tales to tell. "Do you see this
ring?" he said to me one day, pointing
to a gold circle which he carried on his
watch chain.
"Yes," I replied, examining it; "it's
gold, certainly, 18-carat stamp."
"That's not the point," he replied.
"The fact is, I got this ring one day at
a seance in New York. It was thrust
into the middle of a rose which I held
in my hand. It could only have been
put there by the spirits, because my
hand was tightly shut all the time, and
I felt nothing:.
"This occurred," he went on, "before
I had taken up the study of theosophy,
and I kept the ring merely as a curios
ity. But now it has to me a far high
er value.

j^OVEL "SGRUBBI^Q" SERVICE.
A novel church service is announced
to *>c held at St. Laurence's Church.
Birmingham, says the London Daily-
Mail. On Sunday last the vicar. Rev.
T. J. Bass, Invited the congregation to
take part in a "scrubbing service,"
which would be held in the church next
day, beginning at half-past 3 and last
ing until half-past 9.
Soap, water and patent scrubbers
would, he said, be provided, and all the
congregation, male and female, were
eligible to lend a hand in cleaning tha
church.
The church has had a curious his*
tory, and has been blessed with a cu
rious collection of vicars. Some eight
or ten years ago the parish, which is
the most poverty-stricken in all Bir
mingham, was controlled by the Rev.
J. F. M. Whish, and he, finding the ser
vices languishing from lack of wor
shipers, hit upon all sorts of queer ex
pedients for compelling them to coma
in.
He announced the most flaming 1 se
ries of .discourses ever given publicity
to by handbill and poster. "Pigeon
Flying," "A Good Day on the Course"
and kindred topics were dealt with in
stead of orthodox Scriptural topics.
Thousands of printed cards were cir
culated each week, bearing such affec
tionate inscriptions as:
"Come and hear your old pal, the
Rev. J. F. M. Whish."
"Now, then, buck up! Give your old
pal Whish another trial."
Other cards would contain an exhor
tation signed:
"I remain, your true pal, J. F. M.
Whish."
This original vicar would go into
public houses during the dinner hour,
and, addressing the company, would
say:
"Well, gentlemen, you have given my
friend, the landlord, a good turn; now
finish up at my little place on the other
side of the road."
Special services were held â one week
for pigeon flyers, another week for
sweeps and a third for sandwich men.
Mr. Whieh"s successor was as de
voted and faithful a vicar as his pred
ecessor, but lacked Mr. Whish"s hu
mor and discretion. He gave so har
rowing a description of the denizens of
the courts and alleys of the parish to
a local journalist that those whom he
freely described as hawkers, rogues
and loose women resented his descrip
tion of them by breaking his windows.
Now a washing service is announced,
and doubtless the interior of the
church warrants the appeal made for
the services of an army of cleaners.

STRANGE MARRIAGE
CUSTOMS.
MARRIAGE is a solemn subject,
of course. But it isn't half so
f=n^mn in an Anjrlo-Saxon coun
try, where the parties to the
match have an opportunity for
: .-hioned courtship.
The Chinese have an elaborate wed
dlnc--Ceremonial. It begins with pres
ents and the reports of astrologers.
The parents then correspond. The girl's
fÂ«>- r offers his "ugly and ill-favored
âfor such is Oriental etiquette.
The father of the boy, not to be out-
In politeness, describes his son as
â  slothful, indigent and weak in intel
lect." The bride's procession, for which
even a mandarin must make way, goes
t'i the bridegroom's house and is car
ried over the threshold.
Japanese politeness is like the Chi
nese; female subjection is the same,
but the national good humor makes it
more toierable. There is a beautiful
symbolism in the lighting of the
torches, when the bride's and bride
groom's lights are permitted to mingle.
In the room where the ceremonial
sake is drunk there is a dwarf fir tree,
a plum tree in blossom, symbolizing the
woman's beauty; a tortoise, signifying
longevity, and a crane.
The Persian wedding includes a
torchlight procession of the bridegroom
and his friends to the bride's house,
where the groom and his companions se
cure her and then return to the beating
of drums. An Arab wedding lasts seven
days. The husband sees his wife's face
after the ceremony is over. It is then
proper for him to cry out in delight at
Its loveliness, and then, as in the Bible,
'the friend of the bridegroom, who
standeth and heareth him, rejoicing
greatly because of the bridegroom's
voice" â the people outside the tent
raise' an answering cry. In Turkey the
bride stands behind a screen during a
â¢part of the ceremony, and is first seen
at its conclusion. A Moorish wedding
ys also a seven days' affair.
Th6"re is a clever custom sometimes
followed in Persia. A crowd of young
men rush into the feasting crowd, cap
ture the guests and shut them up in a
dark room. They pay ransom to get
out and the money is added to the
bride's dowry â sometimes like our wed
ding present nuisance.
"Marriage by capture" is symbolized
In ceremonies all the world over, except
in such places Avhere it is still the
habit to secure a wife by knocking her
down first, as the Australian docs with
his "waddy" or his "nulla-nulla." The
chinaman, if the parents of his in
tended are obstinatf. carries her off;
the Abyssinian carries his wife round
her own house or to his own, and the
Kabyle carries his bride across the
threshold, as do also the Chinese and
the Swiss in some parts.
The Druses have a sham fight, in
â¢which the bride's party drive the bride
groom's into his own village , and in
Fome Arab tribes like the Aenezes the
bride runs from tent to tent before she
Is caught. Crossing the threshold was
ami is the most critical period of the
wadding day with all races, not even
exciting the Anglo-Saxon. The lift
ing of the bride over the threshold or
her stepping across it is the signal in
Persia, Arabia and among the Kopts
of Egypt for the sacrifice of a goat or
a sheep. Among the Aenezes the bride
groom kills a lamb in front of his
father-in-law's tent, and the ceremony,
but for the running of the bride from
one tent to another, is complete.
Among the Zezidi, a sect of Kurds in
the eastern highlands of Asia Minor,
we are told that the bridegroom, when
pronouncing the marriage oath, stands
t running water, so as to wash away
c binding nature of his promise. The
lerokee bridegroom, after making the
usual presents, takes the maiden to a
small stream, where the two join hands
over the running water.

STORY OF A MAN WHO BECAME A BUDDHIST PRIEST.
IN one of San Francisco's quaint
commercial houses is a. Japanese
who has just laid aside the covet
ed privilege of wearing the
purple robe of the Buddhist
priesthood in a quiet life to take
up the exciting cares of a business
career.
Nasayoshi Ota was initiated into the
full mysteries of Buddha when a
young man and was given the purple
robe at 21. Inclination for an active
commercial life as well as for foreign
travel led him to renounce the object
of many years of patient mental labor.
"The Buddhists in Japan," he be
gan in recounting his experiences in
the priesthood, "are divided into eight
sects, named respectively the Tendai,
Shingan, Jiyado, Hoke, Shinsin, Rin
zai, Obaku and Sato. The three last
are branches of the great Zen sect,
which is one of the strictest and most
exclusive in the empire. It is a sect
founded and patronized by noblemen
and swordsmen, all of whom are ac
credited with being persons of a high
order of intelligence as well as of un
doubted bravery.
"This sect alone has founded and
supports 33,000 temples.

childhood, usually when but seven or
eight years of age. Many of these
boys are adopted by the elder pnesta.
who stand high in power and choose
these children to follow their own vo
cation because of their being orphans
or because they display mental supe
riority or physical perfection. Popular
priests are often urged by parents to
take their sons in charge.
"Adoption into the priesthood means
a cutting off from all blood relations
during the period of the man's natural
life and the young novitiate is taught
to think with indifference and scorn
of home and its ties; to deny that love
for father, mother, sister or brother
is a degree greater than his love for
all humanity.

NEW SHIRT WAISTS
FOR SPRING WEAR
or silk to the elaborate bodice fit for the
most festive of occasions. . 'â¢
The shirt waists strongly resemble i
those worn throughout the summer. To '
â wear beneath a coat nothing is more con- '
venient than the shirt waist of soft â 
French flannel. These can be bought >
ready-made in a variety of patterns. The
fashionable flannels used for this purpose |
are scattered with polka dots, covered
with stripes or in dainty plaid or checked ;
designs. The plaid velvet shirt waist is
high in favor. Many of the plaids are
somewhat startling in their color com
binations, arid yet when worn with dark
cloth skirt they look most effective. The
peau de soie waist comes in all the new
colors and is made after the conventional
pattern.
All the new shirt waists will not be
blouse. There will be tight-fitting ones,
though it must be conceded that even
these will blouse a little in front. The
sides and back will be tight-fitting with a
little fall over the belt.
The fancy appearance in many is due to
the treatment of the waist after it is on.
Very fancy collarettes are worn; there is '
a deep yoke of lace put on over the waist,
and the broadest girdles are used.
These collars, pykes and girdles are
purchased separately and either sewed
upon the sjiirt waist or hooked in place.
To understand this perfectly it is only
necessary to describe four little shirt
: waists that have attracted much atten
! tion. One Is of rose sIIk. over which is
â  worn a bolero of shaded rose velvet edged
with black Jet. Around the throat is
hooked a frill of the rose silk.
The second is of seeded velvet, with the
seeds composed of tiny beads of different
hues. It has a pointed girdle of black
velvet, which gives the waist a very
slender appearance.
The third is of dotted chiffon over a
taffeta lining of greenian hue. The yoke I
is trimmed with bands of green ribbon
and the sleeves are frilled with green
chiffon ruchings. A green ribbon is tied
around the neck.
The fourth one is a black satin waist j
with a heavy deep basque, into which is i
set panels of white satin, making a fan |
effect. The same design is carried out in !
the sleeve puffs. An immense fichu of
\ white chiffon is worn with this waist,
hanging almost to the waist line. The
i fichu is embroidered in black silk. This
' waist is for half mourning.
These shirt waists are araong the more
elaborate ones, but there are others just j
j as pretty and much more serviceable
which cost a great deal less.
In making a striped silk waist the ;
I stripes run up and down the waist and |
; round nnd round the sleeves. No other
I way produces graceful results. This must
i be observed in all fabrics, whether cam
! brics, silks or velvets.
The velvet shirt waist is so dressy,
comfortable and becoming that it will
rage throughout the spring. But it is too
' hot for summer wear. It is generally !
lined with a very thin lining material on j
account of its tendency to "crock off."
The regular summer shirt waist will be
lof wash material made with trimmed
! sleeves and small shoulder puffs. The I
!- puffs will be ruffled or trimmed with lace j
and set with insertion. They can hardly I
be too fussy. The absolutely plain ones I
; will only be seen where the goods have
: an elaborate pattern in the material.
French gingham makes up into the
i neatest of shirt waists because it is so
' dainty and can be treated so effectively.

you are only a baby pining for home,'
is the scornful remark which greets
those children who yield to homesick
ness.
"On entering the temple the head is
shaven and the black robe donned,
when the novitiates become the princi
pal of a ceremony similar to a burial
service, after which they are consid
ered virtually dead to the world.
' "Their training is then begun by
carefully instructing them to appre
ciate the beauties and advantages of
self-denial and self-reliance, also to
exercise fully their reasoning powers
and to observe perfect cleanliness in
person and surroundings.
"In exercising the requirement to
deny themselves ease, they must rise
before dawn, and their first task is to
assist in preparing the simple morning
meal, which consists of vegetables and
rice. Water alone is drunk, the use of
tea and coffee being forbidden and milk
abhorred by them. During the re
mainder of the day they work in the
rice fields or garden, which are at
tached to every temple. The evening
after their day of labor is begun by a
season of study. At 8 o'clock they are
interrupted by commands to indulge in
a period of meditation, which lasts for
fully an hour.
"Throughout the evening there are
alternate periods of study and medita
tion, the length of the latter following
the first hour determined by the burn
ing of incense tapers. One of these is
lighted and after an inch or so is con
sumed the students arise and walk
briskly about the room In regular file
for several minutes, and again seat
themselves, when an attendant carry
ing an oaken staff, which is rounded
upon one side and flattened upon the
other, approaching each one in turn,
administers three blow%. upon the
shoulder.
"The first blow is but a slight tap, the
second noticeably harder, and the third
is laid on by the chastiser with gener
ous vigor; all of which is to remind the
student that he has utterly and forever
renounced unalloyed ease.
"Their books are no ~>ly studied but
committed to memory, and there are
few of the adults who do not know the

a party gown, such a waist is. With a
black canvas skirt it is particularly ef

WARDROBE OF THE
WORKINGWOMAN
GIVEN a woman making $12 a
week, that is v 624 a year, to
dress with $100 is quite sufficient,
and as much as she has a right to
spend on dress in proportion to the en
tire amount received.
She can live decently and have a bit
for a rainy day as well.
Well dressed means first of all ap
propriately dressed. For the working
woman to use the several styles
adopted by men and yet not be mas
culine is to my mind to be appropri
ately, neatly, prettily and economi
cally dressed for down-town work. To
do it on $100 a year requires planning
and care.
Here are some suggestions for a list
of things to last one year: one tailor
dress $50, four shirt waists $2, one silk
waist $5, two pairs of shoes $8, three
pairs of gloves $5, underwear $7, um
brella $3, rubbers 50 cents, hats $5,
wrapper $1; total $92 50.
This leaves $T 50 for accidents.
Many a woman whose husband makes
a very good living dresses on less, but
she can hang her clothing away in the
closet to rest, which makes them last
much longer.
First the dress â Choose an all-wool
"covert" finish; twill wears shiny and
rough cloth catches the dirt. For color
select an unobtrusive shade so you will
not quickly be tired of it. Have every
thing in one color; do not get a blue hat
and a brown dress. Have a small oil
stove and flat iron and ironing board
in your room ami use them, for the
dress to last a year must be sponged
and pressed and at least once rebound.
A good tailor will make a dress, fur

very much depends upon the lining

This year the skirting is made separate
from the skirt itself. On the under side
three flounces may be used, doing

ing the rare volumes which such tem
ples contain as well as gleaning all pos
sible knowledge from the exnerience of
older devotees. Such pilgrimages fre
quently last from ten to firteen years
before the priest returns to his former
home and to the honors which it is cus
tomary to bestow upon him. None,
however, return until fully satisfied
that there is nothing more pertaining
to their priestcraft which can be
learned.
"Among the Buddhists, intellectual
attainments alone give precedence,
and by displaying superior wisdom
any priest may rise from the lowest to
preside over the highest organization
or temple. The .ascendency of the
priests to knowledge and influence is
marked at each step by a change in the
color and texture of their robes. The
first garment worn by the student is
one of unrelieved black. Their next
advance in knowledge is declared to
the initiated by linings of colored silk
showing in their wide sleeves; after
their pilgrimage is completed they ap
pear in red, and when their first great
wisdom has attracted universal at
tention, the privilege of. wearing pur
ple is granted by the Emperor.
"The last step which proclaims them
high in authority and of great learn
ing is marked by the ordeal of a secret
ceremony which lasts for 100 days. Af
ter this ceremony they are spoken of
as most holy and are privileged to wear
any color which may suit their fancy.
"It may be said that the position of
the priest is the only possession which
he can call his own during life, and the
presiding priests name their successor
in a will which is seal d in the pres
ence of witnesses with impressive cere
monies. It is then laid away with
valued documents of the temple.
"The Buddhist temples are supported
both by endowments and donations:
the latter are principally given by sons
in memory of a father, whose name is
inscribed upon a tablet within the tem
ple, and before which the sons fre
quently prostrate themselves, never
failing to endow the temple with a gen
ruffles because they protect the lining
of the skirt, are lighter than the pet
ticoat and have a very good effect.
Be daring, and have the sleeves made
almost tight, for tight sleeves are a
matter of the very near future â tight
sleeves and, alas! trimmed skirts. If
trimming is desired on the skirt, braid
is all that is appropriate on a tailor
suit.
Have the coat made long half way
to the knee, and lined with good, heavy
silk.
For everyday use shirt waists are the
best and most economical. Get a But
terick pattern and make them yourself,
for the ready-made ones will have no
style unless you pay $4 or $5, and you
can make them just as well for 50 or 80
cents. â¢
If you are slender, use the blouse
effect; but if you are not, make the
waist in the ordinary way and by pull
ing the front out a bit after it is on you
can reach quite enough of the blouse
to be becoming.
This year the sleeves are very scant,
and the body of the waist is also not
full. The cuffs should be made on the
waist for economy 1n laundry, but sep
arate collars keep it fresh. The collar
is not to be turned but quite on the
clerical cut. The tie should be either
very narrow or else very wide. Mull
and ribbon finishings at the neck in
place of collar and tie may be used.
Of material for waists there is such a
variety the monotony of wearing one
dress is quite overcome.
A light waist, the right color, will
keep fresh quite as long as a dark one,
which, though not soiled, gets crushed
and looks soiled.
Select distinct patterns if you want to
look young. Do not select nondescript
shades.
The new Chinese crepe wears very
well, indeed, and is only 20 cents a yard,
and neither shrinks nor fa^des. The pat
terns are very pretty, and quite the
thing.
Gingham avoid. It shrinks and fades
unless of the very best, at about 75
cents, which is too much. Brown linen
is very good but not often becoming,
and linen musses easily.
For the best for the least money, I
would choose a percale at, say, 10 to 25
cents.
Very much depends upon how a waist
is put on. At the center of the back
sew a piece of cotton belting. Tack the
erous gift upon each anniversary of the
parent's death.
"Religion with the Buddhist is a
changeless heritage, a family belong
ing to one sect for generations with no
thought of departure from the belief of
their fathers, and this constancy of
faith insures a fixed income to each
temple.
"Among the sects there are both mar
ried priests and celibates. The married
priests live more pretentiously than the
latter and, in fact, the presiding priest
of a temple devoted to the sect of bene
dicts revels in much the same pomp
which feudal lords anciently enjoyed,
while his celibate brother renounces
both pomp and power and contents
himself with the plainest fare. About
the temple in which a married priest
and family reside are to be seen the
huts of numerous dependents, whom
he oppresses at will and by whom he is
served with the greatest humility and
faithfulness.
"The married and the unmarried
priests also differ in an essential part
of their belief, the former mamtain
ine the supremacy of God and the lat
ter believing only in the power of rea
" Among those Buddhists there was
once a famous priest named Gasson,
whose numerous experiences and ad
ventures they are fond of relating in
laudation of the extreme disregard for
efwhch exists among them The fol
lowing is one of these oft-told adven
tures- As Gasson went about doing
eood 'teaching and traveling by night
as well as by day, he once encountered
a notorious band of desperadoes, ten in
number, who had marked the route he
had taken and were lying in wait to
rob him As the ten sprang upon him,
maklne'a demand that he give up his
Snifngs he calmly replied. 'I will
cfve you all,' and handed them the
food he carried, together with the last
remnant of his clothing, which they
did not scruple to accept; they, how
ever allowed him to retain the wallet
depending from his neck, and which
only a priest may bear.
"He resumed his journey, and he had
traveled nearly two miles from the spot
of the robbery when he made the dis
covery that the wallet contained a
golden em, a coin whose value is per

back into place and stitch it, but leave
the front loose. Keep the waist secure
ly in place with an under belt of white
cotton, fastened with, an ordinary tail
or's buckle, and slipped under the piece
you sewed on the back. Arrange the
fullness to suit your figure, and by
changing it each day it does not lie
in flat creases. Your waist will last
much longer made loose in this way.
Close the front with buttons as large
as a quarter, pulling them in with
rings as a /nan does in his white vests.
For a hat a good sailor in -summer,
haps $50, and which was carried by him
in trust for the temple to relieve the
sufferings of the poor. Mindful of his
promise to yield all to the robbers, he
at once retraced his steps, and hand
ing the coin to the leader of the des
peradoes, remarked, 'This I had forgot
ten, but now give to you.'
"Impressed by his great honesty the
robbers saw the extent of their own
guilt, and begged him to teach them
the secret of such nobility of charac
ter. At once Gasson began to enlight
en them, and succeeded in converting
them to his belief; his work proved to
be permanent, and they In turn became
priests of much power, as zealous in
the cause of their new faith as they
had formerly been in crime, and be
came known as the ten holy ones.
"Among the attainments of the
Buddhist priests none stand higher
than that of writing poems, and an
ambitious priest has been known to
write as many as one hundred in a
single night.
"They have a story of the beggar
priest, scoffed at for his rags by the
world-tainted inmates of a temple at
which he once halted, and who asked
him jeeringly if he was skilled in writ
ing. For reply he begged the use of
one of their pens, and with great hu
mility asked permision to seat himself,
when he began to improvise poems of
such wonderful strength and beauty
that the scoffers bowed before him in
humility, illustrating their consistency

The Japanese fix the epoch of Arddha
Chiddi, or Gotama ("he who kills the
senses"), the founder of Buddhism, at
1000 years before Christ. The funda
mental principle of his system of reli
gion is that there is a supreme power
but not a Supreme Being. Inquiries
into first causes are rejected as being
unphilosophical, and believers also
claim that phenomena alone can be
dealt with by our finite minds. They
deny the immediate interposition of
providence, and maintain that the sys

a good sailor, costing at least $5, and
it will do duty for three summers. A
hatter will reblock, clean and put on a
new band for 50 cents, and you have a
practically new hat. A black velvet
band is very pretty and sure to be be
coming.
In shoes get two pairs at a time â good
ones â of plain leather, and change them
often.
Two shirt waists a week ought to be
quite enough. Wear one one day and
the other the next, laying them in a
drawer in the meantime, and they will
keep clean as long as three more the
usual way.
Have your belts and ties and skirt
harmonize. The Oriental buckles in
enamel do very good service; are odd
and pretty. Let the metal belts alone;
they are a delusion; they scratch the
furniture and wear out the lining of
your coat.
You can get a good silk waist for $5
if you make it yourself, which you
ought to do.

A BEANSTALK BOY'S
EXPERIENCE
IN Watowan County, Minn., Is a
youth who is prepared to play the
part of the beanstalk in any realis
tic production of Jack and the Bean
stalk that may he put on the stage.
He is now 6 feet 10 inches high, and
he keeps ascending at the rate of half
an inch a month.
At Madelia, his home, he is known as
James Mclndoo, but colloquially he is
spoken of as "Our Rising Young Man.
He will be 19 years old next July. Up
to the time he was 15 he was of ordi
nary height and bulk. Now he is a
mammoth, weighing 310 pounds. Dur
ing these four years he has accumu
lated 153 pounds, and has shot up twen
ty-four inches.
His feet are three inches more than
a foot in length and of remarkable
breadth. He wears a No. 24 shoe. It
takes a calfskin of pretty large size to
make them, and there are no "leavings'
worth speaking of when the cobbler geta
through. He wears a No. 8 hat, al
though his head seems disproportion
ately small for a chap of such gigatn
tic frame. His hands are like hams.
One blow of one of them smashes an
ordinary kitchen table to toothpick
splinters.
The boy is very powerful, and more
than once he has supported the body
of a heavy farm cart when a wheel has
been taken off to grease the axle, by
just bracing his hands on his knees and
holding the axle on his shoulder. When
he was 16 he lifted 1100 pounds, and he
laughs when visitors ' tell about the
strength tests of the strong men of
Harvard and Yale.
One playful exercise he likes is to
swing buckets full of water, one in each
hand like an Indian club swinger.
Horseshoes he twists up like hairpins.
In a test the other day he spanned with
one hand thirteen and three-fourths
inches. Taking hold of a tree with one
hand he can hold a team of horses with
the other and make them rear up on
their hind legs at the word "Go I" while
he refuses to budge one inch under the
strain.
He is in perfect health and as jolly
and good-natured as can be. He eats
more than a 1500-pound ox. Whenever
he wants a drink of water he takes up
a gallon pail and drains every drop
from it. He has no particular appetite
for anything stronger, so his capacity
for cider, brandy and soda and Man
hattan cocktails cannot be estimated,
but he has been known to sit down on
a bench and eat a ten-pound basketful
of grapes and asl. for more. Recently
he ate twenty-three large apples for
dessert, saying he wasn't hungry befora
he sat down.
He is pretty well formed, and, except
for his height, does not look abnormally
large. His intellect is n*ot as gigantic
as his stature, but he is nobody's fool.
He has a good head for mechanics. Ha
can take a clock to pieces, or a watch,
clean it and repair it and put it togeth
er again so that it will "keep time."
This has endeared him to his country
mates, and they often come to Jimmy
Mclndoo to have this or that thing
"tinkered up," and the boy always
obliges when he can. His very good
nature has made him sometimes the
butt of practical jokes. Sometimes he
Is able to turn the laugh on the perpe
trators, and this tickles him immensely.
One day a couple of farm hands
thought it would be funny to confine
Jimmy in the corn crib. They wedged
the door shut and put a couple of logs,
backed by a biff rock, in front of the
structure. As soon as Jimmy perceived
his fix he tramped over the corn cobs,
and, bracing himself against two joists,
calmly lifted the roof off the crib and
crawled out. Then for revenge he took
the farm hands by the nape of the neck
and marched them off to the watering
trough and ducked them simultaneoua
Â»lv till they yelled for mercy.28
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS
AND THEIR TEACHERS.
LAST Saturday morning the rooms
of the San Francisco Teachers'
Club were crowded with teachers,
who came from all parts of the
city to listen to the lecture of Pro
fessor E. H. Griggs of Stanford
on the subject of Dante's "Terrestrial
Paradise."
With his usual magnetism and clear,
forcible manner of presenting a theme,
Professor Griggs held the keen attention
of his audience for an hour and a half
while he discussed the difference between
medieval ami modern thought, Dan
te's theories of life, as expressed in the
"I'.irailise," and tfte lessons of our own
meditation and guidance which we may
draw from the latter. A few thoughts
are gathered here and there from the ad
dress, which was full of thought and feel
ing.
"At the beginning of canto 27 we find
Dante and Virgil emerging from the last
part of the Purgatorio into the first heav
en, which is the Terrestrial Paradise.
Each must pass through a circle of fire
to gain this paradise at the top of a
mountain, which was pushed up through
Purgatory- This is typical of the emerg
ence from sin through the fires of purifi
cation. It does not matter much to the
universe whether we are good or
evil, but It is of life and death importance
to ourselves.
"When ascending the mountain toward
the good is as natural and spontaneous as
going down hill, we can then be sure that
we are approaching the image and like
ness of God. Then actions which are help
ful to ourselves and others become pleas

Last Friday night there was a prelim
urable. Just on the threshold of the Ter
restrial Paradise the sun sets and Dante
is forced to pause. The moment that our
light becomes dinÂ» and our path indis
tinct, we must wait for the daylight of
Truth to guide us on. This is Tuesday
evening, according to the reckoning that
Dante entered the Inferno on the night
of Good Friday and came out into Purga
tory on Easter morning. On the divine
side the stars that Dante now sees are
the symbols of God's light shining in the
world; on the human side they are the
eves of Beatrice.
"The medieval philosophy said, 'Man
may be virtuous, but God alone Is good."
To Dante man was only virtuous when
he struggled to become good; when there
was no longer any necessity for strug
gling, then he was goodâ which could not
be in this life. He symbolizes these Ideas
in the pictures of Rachel sitting in con
templation, and Leah, who, having ceased
her struggles, goes happily about gather
ing flowers for a garment.
"All through his life Dante was seek
ing peace, not merely negation but the
peace of truth, which passeth under
standing. Peace to him was rest in ac
tion, the harmony of his spirit with the
life of the universe. In order to feel
these things intensely, we must go back
to the middle ages and place ourselves
as much as possible in Dante's point of
view. To us there is something higher
than virtue and goodness; there is wis
dom and love. To know love, we must
love. To have wisdom, we must aspire
to the knowledge of truth. We
may impart to any one with ordinary
intellect tne principles of ethics which
have thus far been worked out, but to
teach the art of life is a different mat
ter.

FROM KERN COUNTY.
The Kern County high school building
at Bakersfield is considered by visiting
educators to be one of the best in the
State. It was completed in 1595 and oc
cupied in the fall or the same year. The
building alone cost $15,500, and is con
structed of stained brick which was es
pecially manufactured for it by the con c
tractor, F. W. Hickox. It is a two-story
building with a large commodious base
ment, in which are situated the chemical
and physical laboratories and the gym
nasium. There are four class rooms, an
assembly hall and offices. The sanitary
arrangements are modern in all respects.
The attendance, which for 1897-98 will
average about sixty-five, is increasing
with each succeeding year. A. B. Mar
tin, a graduate of the University of Mich
igan, is the present principal.
At the last Teachers' Institute in Kern
County a committee was appointed to at
tempt the organization of a popular read
ing course. The committee reported a
plan which was adopted and has since
proven highly successful. 1 .Â»e course Is
four years in length, and provides for
the reading sixteen books, making four
for each year. When a member has com
pleted a book, the committee gives him
a certificate indicating the same, provided
he has satisfied the committee by written
analysis that he has fairly mastered what
he has been reading. When any one has
completed the entire four years' course
he will be granted a diploma of gradua
tion. This system is similar to the Chau
tauqua course of reading. Its object is
good, and its success or failure the future
alone can determine. At present the city
of Bakersfield has a membership of about
fifty, who are doing good work.
Last week the Kern County Board of
Education held a special meeting to pre
pare questions for the spring examina
tions in the grammar schools. Those in
the seventh and eighth grades are con
ducted by the grammar school teachers,
but the examination for the greater por
tions of the county for admission to the
high school is held in the building of the
latter on the first Monday in June.
Kern County has this year sixty-one
districts and employs eighty-five teach
ers, all of whom are women with the ex
ception of seven. The mountain schools
are closed during the winter months.

TEACHING LANDSCAPE GARDENING
Edward Hyatt, Superintendent of
Schools in Riverside County, has issued
a circular containing a suggested lesson
for teachers of country schools. In a
note Superintendent Hyatt says that ho
received the idea from Mr. Rice, teacher
of the Hemet High School. The drawing
is by Kate Grey, ami illustrates a plan
for grounds at Belnr'nt. Mr. Hyatt's cir
cular is. in part, as fellows:
May I suggest ;i diversion for you ana
your" older children some Friday after
noon or some day when the regular les
sonn drag? It is this: *.o give an exer
cise on the planning of a school ground.
We can awaken their minds to the
fact that an intelligent Idea beforehand
is necessary for the results we all ad
mire and desire; and to the fact that it
is a pleasing thing t' l use our brains in
working available materials to the best
advantage in planning homes for our
selves or our schools. The future of our
country is wrapped up in these children
we toa'ch. Who taiowa what improve
ments, what symmetry in drives and
grounds, what beauty of tree and shrub
and flower may spring from this little
diversion?
If it be thought desirable to plan for a
home rather than for a school, well and
good Tho materials that the children
may use are: fences of all kinds, gravel,
to mjike them attractive to the public at
large as well as to the teachers. Occa
sionally a social meeting of the teachers
and their pupils will be held.
Officers- for the ensuing year were
elected as follows: President, Charles C.
Hughes: vice-president, John W. Young;
secretary, Lillian Roden; treasurer
Thomas Dickson. The executive board
consists of the foregoing officers, togeth
er with C. P. Nlelson, Miss Alice Cohen
and Mrs. Paris.

herself draw a plan. Put trees where
shade will come where you want it, and
give room for them to grow to large size.
Do not tire out the children by insisting
upon niceties of drawing or exactness of
scale so that they will not express their
own tastes and ideas freely and easily.
Your object Is to encourage each pupil to
form an idea of his own and to roughly
express it by diagram. Then you have a
noble opportunity to soften the barbari

poverty of those ideas. Thus you lead

A FIERCE ENCOUNTER.
In the Plaza de Toros of Madrid a
combat was recently fought between
j the famous man-eater tiger Cezar and
; the bull Regatero, says the New York
I Times. The bull was the first to appear
iin the inclosure. He was walking
â  leisurely when the tiger glided in and
I at once sprang upon him, firmly lm
; planting his claws in his hide. The
j bull, taken by surprise, seemed at
| first undecided what to do; then with
a terrible bellow he reared up and
shook his adversary off. He backed
several paces and charged, taking the
tiger upon his horns and throwing him
ten feet into the air. He then retired
and repeated the attack. He did this
again and again, and each time the

OXF of the prettiest, most fertile
and most accessible counties In
the State is Napa. Though of lim
ited area its wealth, its resources
and its proximity to San Francisco
give it corresponding importance.
The county Is about fifty miles long and
varies in width from thirty to thirty-five
miles. Spurs of the Coast Range of moun
tains pass through it. Between these
spurs are several rich and very product
ive valleys, where the soil is fertile, the
climate perfect, the scenery unsurpassed.
principal valley ir the county i.s
N v.-hirh is about forty miles long
and from two to five miles wide. Upon
side are continuous ranges of high
hills, covered with a rich soil that amply
la the husbandman for all labor
expended thereon. The valley contains
â¢ ~;..ixX> acres. The farms are numer
weli cultivated and very productive.
At the southern extremity and widest
part Napa Valley receives the cool
breezes which blow through the Golden
Gate and up San â¢Francisco and Sau
I'ablo bays.
The Napa River rises in the mountains
at the head of the valley, and. clinging
close to the eastern range of hills, at last
enters San Francisco Kay. This river is
navigable for steamboats and sailing
I moderate size.
â¢ towns of leading Importance
in the county are Xapa, St. Helena and
Calistoga, all situated in Napa Valley
and connected by rail and wagon roads.
Ther.^ are several small villages and set
tiemt nts. At Yountville, nine miles above
Xapa, is the State Home for Veterans,
where 700 survivors of the Mexican and
civil wars find, shelter in their declining
years.
The county maintains a commodious
and comfortable home for its indigent
sick and helpless. The building used as
a hospital proper is a large, handsome
wooden structure. In 1507 there was aid
ed to the older building a magnificent
structure, with all the latest im
provements, which is used as a tempo
rary hospital for the insane. Therein all
persons who are to be examined as to
their mental soundness are placed and
kept during the course of their examina
tion. The stone addition is so construct
ed that it will accommodate a large

number of patients with perfect security.
The institution is under the able man
agement of Mr. ana Mrs. Q. C. Fly. The
health of the inmates is cared for by Dr.
E. '/.. Hennessy. county physician. Seven
miles to the northeast of Napa are the
famous Napa Soua Springs. This prop
erty, owned by Colonel J. P. Jackson,
present Collector of the Port of San
Francisco, is personally managed by An
drew Jackson, son of the proprietor. The
springs rank among the popular pleasure
and health resorts of the State. Hand
some large buildings adorn the premises.
Other resorts in the county are note
worthy, among which are Wilsons Inn,
the Rural Health Retreat of St. Helena,
Aetna Springs in Pope Valley. Samuel
Springs, Angwins and Atlas Peak.
In the vicinity of Aetna Springs are ex
t'-nsivu quicksilver mines. Napa County
offers splendid inducements to the home
seeker, who will find land held at much
lower prices than in many counties of the
.State.
The city of Napa, the county seat, is
situated at the head of navigation on the
Napa River, forty-seven miles from San
Francisco. It has line educational facili
ties, consisting of public and private
schools. Its high school is well equipped.
The population is 4500, and the assessed
valuation $3,000,000. The city Is practically
free from debt. Numerous enterprises
line the water front, comprising four tan
neries, in which are made glove, shoe,
harness and sole leather; a woolen mill,
a glove factory, a shoe factory, a planing
mill, a Hour mill, fruit driers, a cannery,
a cream of tartar works, distilleries,
wineries, warehouses, lumber yards, etc.
Two .latly and three weekly papers reflect
the enterprise, of the town, and there are
three well-established banking institu
tions.
Napa's commercial advantages are
great, in fact superior to those of most
California towns, for Napa has water as
well as rail communiaction with the out
side. Passenger and freight trains find
m it their principal etatiou on the Napa
Valley branch of the California Pacific
Railroad, while three times per week the
Zinfandel, a handsome freight and pas
senger steamer, plies between the city
and San Francisco. The Xapa City, a
freight steamer, and flat-bottomed schoon
ers also come and go regularly.
The building of an electric power line
and railroad from Clear Lake, sixty miles
north, to this point, will soon be com
pleted by organized capital.
Napa city has a most complete system
of telephones. Scarcely a business house
is without one and many private resi
dences art*Â»filso thus accommodated.
Xapa is eminently a town of fine resi
dences and the' streets are illuminated
with both gas and electric lights. Xine
derominatlons are represented among the
churches. The city has a perfect system
of water works, its large mains being
filled from an underground Btream two
miles away, by means of mammoth steam
pumps and a 3,000,000 gallon reservoir. The
â water comes into town with sufficient
pressure to guarantee efficiency in the fire
department and the thorough flushing of
sewers. The works are owned by a joint
stock company in which citizens generally
are interested. The city also possesses an
active Board of Trade, through whose in
strumentality, coupled with the enter
prise of the people, many of the industries
here flourishing were attracted. A rree
public" library is one of Papa's institu
tions. It contains over 5000 volumes.
During the past year the librarian s re^
ord show that there were 30,000 visitors to
the institution.
The valley surrounding Napa City is
wonderfully picturesque. The average
annual rainfall during the last twenty
years has been leas than 27 inches, but
this is an amount amply sufficient for all
purposes. This year's rate of taxation
city, county and State-is only 51 50 on
the $100.
Among the most prominent business
enterprises of Napa is the Napa Woolen
Mills This mill was established in 1885,
and has been running almost continu
ously ever since. The main building is a
farge wooden structure 100x100 feet In
siz? In addition to the main building a
brick warehouse 50x70 goes to make up
the plant. Sixty-five persons are em
nloved So great is the amount of orders
that they are all working overtime. The
daily output is about 1200 pounds of
scoured wool. This year quite a quantity
of blanketing has been cut up for the
Klondike trade, and large quantities of
10 12 and 14 pound blankets, which aro
twice as heavy as those called for a year
ago are now in hand for the gold-seekers
who' go north. The plant is owned by
twenty stockholders. The officers are:
S E Holden. president; Manuel Manasse,
vice-president; B. F. Holden, secretary
and treasurer.

stories high, and made a contract with
the new firm that if they would occupy
it with a shoe factory, employing at
least twenty-five hands for live years, at
the end of that period the property
should be deeded to the occupants with
out charge. Many more than the re
quired number of people are already em
ployed and the factory is working until
9:30 o'clock at night every day filling
orders. Most of the leather used by the
company is produced in the State.
The members of the firm are Luther J.
Evans, for more than twenty years a
practical shoe manufacturer, more than
half of this time he having been con
nected with one of the large shoe fac
tories of San Francisco, and Lewis J.
Xorton, secretary and treasurer of the
Sawyer Tanning Company of this city,
with which concern he has been con
nected for over seventeen years.
A short distance below Napa, in a
southerly direction, under the manage
ment of C. Mulkey, is situated the
Spreckels ranch, one of the finest breed-
ing farms for horses in the State. The
tract of land consists of 250 acres of fine
bottom valley land, on which tine hay is
raised and fine grazing for stock is af
forded.
A fine training track, the most modern
and convenient stables and handsome
buildings are situated upon the premises.
The farm is used principally for breeding
and raising fine stock. A visitor to Napa
should not fall to visit this finely equip
ped farm.
Among the enterprises of Napa is the
GOOD WORK OF THE SACRAMENTO FOUNDLING HOME.
ON a bleak wintry morning in the
month of March, nearly ten
years ago, there was found upon
the doorstep of a Sacramento
home a little bundle of lifeless human
ity. The spot upon which it lay was
damp and cold, the rain dripped from
the eaves above and gusts of chilling
wind swept over the little body, the
life's spark of which had been extin
guished for many hours before it was
found. It was a Sabbath morning and
the people were returning from church.
A crowd had gathered and among
them were several Christian women of
Sacramento, whose hearts were
touched by the pitiful spectacle before
them. Mrs. F. W. Fratt in speaking of
the incident said:
"On Monday afternoon, the 24th day
of March, 1890, five ladies met together
and organized a charity to be known
as the Sacramento Foundling Home
Association. Why? Because our sym
pathies were awakened by the sad
death of a little waif whose life went
out beneath the pitiless rain that Sab
bath morning on the steps of a home
in this city. We had seen the need of
this home for some time, but that lit
tle breath, that was wafted away In
the chilly morning, breathed life into
our hitherto indefinite plans.
"We incorporated June 21, 1890. The
first directors were Mary E. Tryon,
Charlotte P. Huntoon, Sarah E. Clay
ton, Helen P. Mandevllle and myself.
Though it has been a hard struggle to
arrive at our present usefulness we
have trodden down each difficulty with
the help of our Master. Now we reach
out with hope inscribed upon our ban
ner, which floats its folds of purity
over the helpless, homeless, unloved,
unwelcomed and unclaimed babes."
MrÃ. Sarah E. Clayton, who has done
much for the establishment of the
foundling home, in speaking of the in
stitution said: "Seventeen years ago
in this city an Infant was left on the
doorstep of the old Catholic church,
which was then at Seventh and X
streets. A policejnan took It to the
orphan asylum. He was informed that
they could not take care of Infants
there. We did not know what

Three years ago the enterprising citi
zens nf Napa induced Messrs. Raymond &
AYilliiims, who were at that time engaged
in the glove business in San Francisco,
to locate here. The citizens of Napa sub
scribed liberally toward the new enter
prise and raised suflicient funds to pur
chase the site and erect the glove factory
building, which they presented to Messrs.
Raymond & Williams upon the expressed
condition that thirty-fly: persons at least
were to be given employment for at
least five successive years. The proprie

to pay for the care of the child until
I could obtain a home for it, which I
did in a few days. In a few weeks an
other babe was found abandoned, and
I found a home for it also. Dr. Hardy
about this time invited me to visit the
Home for Infants in San Francisco,
over which he had charge. I found
that our generous State had made
some provision for the little homeless
ones there and I wondered why we
should not have such a home in Sacra
mento. While I was doing all I could
to establish a home I found homes for
eighteen babies, of which only four
died. If you could see those who are
living to-day you would see what fine
looking people they are. They are
thankful indeed that they live In a
Christian land where we have been
taught the value of unselfish love."
The Foundling Home under the man
agement of these noble women has be
come one of the best public charities
in the State. The present board of di
rectors is composed of the following
ladies: Mrs. Annie E. Clark, Mrs.
Sarah E. Clayton, Mrs. Ella J. Flint,
Mrs, Ella T. Merkley, Mrs. Cornelia C.
Fratt, Mrs. W. H. Weinstock, Mrs.
Lottie Deming and Miss Minnie Roth,
the last named being the secretary.
The institution reflects great credit
upon those who are identified with it.
Mrs. Nellie Clark, the matron, deserves
much praise for her untiring efforts in
the care and discipline of the little ones
under her charge. Dr. Henderson, the
attending physician, is very proud of
the high standard of healthfulness
which he has maintained during the
period of bis administration.
The building is on Ninth and X
streets. There are twenty apartments
not including clcsets and bath rooms.
On the lower floor are two large par
lors, one on each side of a spacious re
ception hall.
Mrs. Fratt said: "Only last week we
placed a month old babe in a woman's
arms at the earnest solicitation of her
mother and husband, to fill a niche in
the heart made vacant by death. If
the work we are enabled to do shall
save some of the little ones whose first
breath was drawn in the atmosphere
of sin and rear them to be noble men
and true women we shall feel that our
work has not been in vain. No nobler
effort for the future good and pros

made than to set the feet of the help

tors of the glove factory exceeded their
conditions from the start, and there are
now employed steadily and at a fair rate
of wages over 110 persons. The building
is wooden, 40x100 feet, and has two floors.
An enlargement is now planned.
The monthly output of the factory is
about 2000 dozen pairs of gloves. The an
nual business foots up about $150,000. F.

In the southern part of the town of
Napa is the Sawyer tannery. This is the
largest and most extensive manufactur
ing plant in Napa County.
The daily output .s about 1500 hides.
About 1.0d0',000 pounds of wool per annum
is pulled from sheep pelts, which is ship
ped to Boston commercial houses.
The Sawyer Tannery was started in
1870 by B. F. Sawyer, from whom It de
rived its name, and since that time tne
plant has grown to be one of the finest
equipped establishments of Its kind In
the world.
In 1880, owing to the death of B. F.
Sawyer, the firm was reorganized without
change of name taking place. The pres
ent company is incorporated and *.as a
capital stock of $100,000. The management
consists of S. E. Holden, E. Manasse, L.

people are constantly employed. The pay
roll foots up to about $4000 per month.
The yearly output amounts to about

MACHINES TO COAX YOU TO GO TO SLEEP.
HOW to obtain sufficient sleepâ
this threatens to be a stubborn
problem of the new century
about to dawn over this busy,
bustling world. Some learned
scientists believe that enlight
ened man is fast forgetting how to
sleepâ that insomnia is a necessary
perquisite of higher Intelligence.
Scarcely a week passes during which
we do not read of a deathâ self-inflicted
or otherwiseâ caused by this horrible
curse, which preys especially upon in
tellectual men.
Improved labor-saving machinery is
rapidly eliminating all necessity for
physical exercise, and exercise of the
body, before all, is the one great sleep
producer. We seem to be drifting to
ward an age when man must resort to
artifice to obtain that share of sleep
originally meted out to him by nature,
when the sleep producing machine will
be one of the necessities of human life.
But how are we to produce artificial
slee-) and how must the sleep produc
ing'machine be made? Already sub
jects have been artificially placed in
a state of somnolence by clamping the
arteries leading to the brain. The
clamps remained in place but a half
minute before sleep occurred
Another method of producing artifi
cial sleep by physical means, discov
ered by Dr. Hammond of Washington,
is to apply an electric current to one
of the sympathetic nerves along the
spinal column. The tired man of some
future age may have to resort to the
electric battery for such a purpose. It
would be much more comfortable to be
lulled to sleep by a mild electric cur
rent communicated by a pillow or mat
tress than to have to attach clamps to
the neck.
Some authorities believe that sleep
will result from fatigue of the eyes.
Machines are now made for producing
that condition.
Cold water bags applied to the fore
head and hot ones to the back of the
neck and feet are recommended to pro
duce sleep, since by their means the
blood is driven from the brain. Hot
baths increase the size of the blood

vessels of the skin, and produce the
same effect. Another method of free
ing the brain of blood and causing sleep
â one which will be found acceptable
to everyone â is the eating of a light
supper just before retiring.
Experiments prove that monotony is
an effective source of fatigue to the
brain, which organ appears to automat
ically drain off its blood when fatigued
to a normal degree.
The lullaby of the American mother
produces sleep because of its monotony.
A Papago Indian recently told the
writer that the native doctors among
his people sit at the bedside of the sick
and sing monotonous chants, repeated
over and over, throughout the whole
night. No additional treatment beyond
conjuring is applied. Many patients are
doubtless cured, the only virtue of the
treatment being the relief of pain and
the nourishment of the system by sleep
produced by monotony. Repeated rock
ing produces sleep, as does repeated
brushing of the hair.
There is an interesting theory that we
require sleep in proportion to the scar
city of red corpuscles in our blood. All
people, therefore, do not correspond in
their need of sleep. Many authorities
agree that the degree to which sleep is
needed depends upon the strength of
consciousness.
Too much sleep is thought to be
harmful by some authorities. Since con
sciousness requires waking hours for
development, too much sleep will rob It
of its education. During sleep a man
grows like a vegetable, but his mind
gets no exercise, which its development
demands. Were a child to sleep twen
ty hours a day until ten years old he
would doubtless have a feeble mind.
Children who sleep too much are found
upon investigation to be fatter than
those who sleep at a normal rate, but
their intellects are duller and their
muscles weaker. Insomnia, on the other
hand, is always a dangerous symptom
in children.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET. j
NEW YORK. March 12.â professional
traders were somewhat astonished at the effect
they achieved in prices to-day. The bears, who j
manipulated the market at the opening, had j
buying orders nt the prices to which they :
desired to drive stocks. The market showed ;
Itself so weak when these prices were, reached \
that the buying orders were quickly . with- i
drawn. This covering movement accounted for '
the sharp rally In the first hour and there '.
â were some recoveries at the close. Otherwise j
there was nothing to relieve the unvaried de- :
preeslon which prevailed through ': the whole !
list of stocks and bonds. The closely held I
standard stOCka suffered with the .purely specu- i
lative Issues, and. in some ceses suffered se- 1
verely. Lake Shore ; ls an example. It sold at |
186, a decline of 3. points, and closed with the {
bidding with only ISO. Pennsylvania dropped
S full points. St. Paul suffered very acutely, j
probably on the .uncovering .of margins on
recent speculative buying, and was oft at one !
time i% points. Northwest dropped 4% and j
Burlington 3 points., The local traction stocks';
were equally weak. ' The .number of prominent i
stocks which net losses of between 2 and 3 j
points Is very large. The ' total sales In ' the :
two hours of trading, 323, 300. was well ' up to ;
the average of a full duy's business v for the ,
v.-fk. exclusive of . Monday, and, blocks of â 
several thousand shares were frequently re- :
cordÂ«d. Part of theM offerings 1 were specu
lative holdings dislodged by exhausted mar
frlna. but there can be no doubt that sales of"
nvestment holdinKs, such as are usually In
fluenced at .all' by the speculative movement
Of prices, are beginning to absorb: an Increas
ing proportion of the business on the. stock
exchange. Then was no specific -Item of ; the
nnwa that could be pointed to as accounting
for the demoralization of. the market. It â¢ was
caused rather by the general - conviction that
the reports of the Maine Board of Inquiry and
a statement of the further policy of the Gov
ernment towartl Cuba viÂ» Imminent, and .'the
unwillingness of operators to carry open con
tracts over Sunday. The weekly bank state
ment shows that the gold Imports received for
the week have not been sufficient to offset the
continued withdrawaJs to the Interior, so that
the cash holdingu â  show a net decrease â of
17M.700. But as UlO he*vy dx&wlog down of
deposits bad reduced the 25 per cent require
ment:? by *2,6;<4,62."> the surplus reserve 1Â« en
larged by $1,857,925.
. The stock market ended the week as It bagan.
in a' demoralised condition. The partial .re
covery of Tuesday and Wednesday and the
diminished activity -between Monday and Sat
urday probably represented nothing but a
natural reaction, which always follows a &ud
den decline, the recovery being in proportion
to the violence of the rail. The New York
Bti i k I-;.\< -hange on Monday shared the. de
pression existing on every exchange for se
curities In the world. On the London and
European exchanges the new demands of Rus
sia upon China and the tension between France
and Great Britain over the West African situa
tion were almost a.= much causes for alarm
as the relations between the United States and
Spain. So acute was the resulting depression
that so important an incident as the Supreme
Court decision In the Nebraska maximum
freight rate case in favor of the railroads was
almost entirely disregarded. although It has
been eaÂ«erly looked for each Monday since last
veiir. Spain' â  disavowal of any intention to
demand Lee's recall, the satisfactory adjust
ment of the difficult}' over sending provisions
to Cubs In warships and the voting by Con
rresii of the *so.i*u.oW) defense fund were ail
cited as evidence of Improved changes In our
relations with Spain. Hut that none of these
had any deep-seated effect wa* shown by the
course of prices later in the week.
The course of the eNchaiiKe market and the
continued Influx of Kold must be accepted also
as additional evidence of preparing for emer
gencies. Last week the heavy demand for
money from the Interior, due to the desire of
interior Institutions to strengthen their re
serves, led to a rise In the money-rate, which
naturally started an import movement of gold.
This week the money market was decidedly
easier and the level of call money rates Is
distinctly below that In London, so there
should be a profit in leaving credits abroad at
Interest. But there has been no interruption
to the engagements of gold for Import, which
have now reached a total of considerably over
$16,000,000. After the available supply of gold
In the open market had been absorbed the
Bank of England and the Bank of France re
sorted to the most extraordinary expedients to
prevent the withdrawal of gold, the premium
demanded being sufficient under ordinary cir
cumstances to check the outflow of gold. â¢
Gold is. however, being taken from the Bank
of England for New York.
Railroad bonds have shown full sympathy
with the weakness In stocks, but the dealings
were not larsre.

worst on a feeble rally from Paris, â  owing to
the recovery In Brazils on Rothschild's buy

that tiie next coupon' of the Interior debt was
to be paid in pesetas is officially contradicted.
All the same Spanish finance is in a desperate

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. j
CHICAGO, March Wheat started as If a I
rally after the weakness of yesterday were to
take place. Holders were encouraged by the
steadiness shown by foreign markets, especially
Liverpool, In the face of yesterday's tumble in i
prices here. It was also known that Letter
had placed additional shipping orders of nearly
150,000 bushels. Offerings at first were In com- \
paratlvely small volume while a good scattered
demand was apparent. Hlds were made for j
July at the opening at SS*<sSs%c. This was ;
Vie over yesterday's closing price and the. buy
ing demand was good enough to add anoth'r I
small fraction to the price In a very short j
time. The market held fairly steady for some |
time at around that price, but finally the. weak- I
ness in Wall street, giving rise to apprehen- |
sions of liquidation In everything else, brought
the longs Into the market to unload. It also
resulted In an almost total cutting off of sup- ;
piles and professional Bhorts taking advantage i
of that fact hammered the price down rapidly.
For about fifteen minutes the market was ex
ceptionally weak. July selling down without a
stop to 86% c. a break of 2%e from the high
point. The decline brought n, good many stop.
loss orders and considerable selling was aIBO
done through fear of another attack on May
by the big bears. In this, however, holders
were agreeably disappointed. Plenty of May i
was offered, but there was nothing like the con- |
certed attempt to break the market which took
place yesterday and Letter's brokers had com
paratively little difficulty in keeping the price
at *104. Another Influential factor was the
New York bank statement. The market, after
getting down to 86% c for July, gradually grew
quieter. The steadiness of May had a good
effect - on ' the nerves of the July holders and
brought Borne of the early sellers back. Shorts
â who had made big profits on the break ; also
covered freely and the price gradually crept
back to 86 /4 c. Then for some time almost â¢ a
holiday dullness prevailed with fluctuations In
frequent and narrow. Late in the session a
good deal of excitement was caused by a for
mal application by Lelter to the directors for
a marginal price on May which was done, he
said, to relieve the tension. This action had
a favorable effect on the market and resulted j
in a further advance in July, that future j
finally getting up to 87Mi@87*c. where it closed. I
May closed at $1 04. After the session closed |
It became known that Lelter had sold 2.000,000
bushels of contract Wheat to Counselman &
Day. The price was not stated, Leiter merely
saying it was disposed of at "market price."
Corn was wesJc with Wheat. May closed a
shade under yesterday's final figure.
The market for Oats was weak In sympathy
with Wheat and Corn. May closed %@%c j
lower. , ,
Provisions were weak. The market ruled
heavy to the close. May Pork closed 25c j
lower, May Lard 7*c. lower and May Rltu
about 10c lower.

ASSOCIATED , BANKS' - STATEMENT.
:-. NEW YORK. March 12.â The Financier says:
â  So far as ' relative strength â ; is ; concerned, *: the
; New York 'â 'â  Clearing-house . banks are 7 In a ;
! stronger >i position -.. now than at i the close .'of
business one week ago. " ! ; The policy of retrench
, ment \ seems |to } have I been rather, generally fol
, lowedby" the : larger Institutions, <, and ? the loss â â 
i of $10,392,400 In j loans. ' as \ shown â  by . the state- :
ment of March 12, ' corresponds closely with the
| reduction lof 'â â  $10,538,500.: In 'i deposits. _â¢ Early In ,
the week | the 1 ldation |In loans was a mark- j
ed feature, as a number of ; the banks were;be
. ' low their reserve requirements and desired nat-,
, urally ;. to '' Increase . their j. cash I holdings, The
j unsettled! Btoek Exchange conditions have also
j contributed toward the falling oft shown in the
400 In legal tenders, but the receipts of the
first ffold Imports swelled the specie Item
$3.J"35,7 r O. so that the actual loss In cash for the
week was only $736,70 i.
The reserve requirements, owing to the de
crease In deposits, were reduced $2.fi34,62r.. and,
taking from this the actual loss in cash, the
result shows that the banks have added $1.
897,925 to the uxcess reserve reported one week
aho. There is now engaged or en route to
Amerca over $12,!>ij0.000 in gold, and as this
will find its way Into New York banks, ex
cepting, of course, the one-half million order
ed for Chicago, the outlook must be regarded
as reassuring. It will be seen that this center
can stand a heavy drain without weakening
the position of the" local banks, although why
there should be a continued movement of funds
to the Interior, with bank reserves at nearly
every principal center heavier 'than visual, is a
matter that cannot be explained easily. The
local money rates during the week have re
flected an easier feeling, falling off somewhat
at the close. Many of the larger banks seem
to be out of the market on commercial paner.
but out-of-town institutions, which are not af
fected by the withdrawal of money, have been
doing considerable business at this point. It Is
of course impossible in view of foreien com
plications to predict how money will turn
within two week?, but it will require a very
severe crisis irdeed to brinp the market to an
acute stage. The continuance of gold Imports
would operate against Its existence for more
than a brief period of time.

show no change from the conditions prevailing

woven goods. Staple cottons In brown and
bleached goods alike are practically where they
were at the week's opening. The firm attitude
of sellers is remarkable in the face of the de
cline in print cloths^

CINDERELLA'S BRAVE PRINCE.
Although Cinderella had been so kind
to her stepsisters, they in return for
her kindness continued to plot against
her; and after a time the younger sis
ter thought to steal away the love of
the Prince, out of jealousy of Cinder
ella's high positio-n. While the step
sisters had bee n married to wealthy
men they were "still subject to Cinder
ella and had to obey her. This made
them angry, and their mother persuad
ed them to visit the cavern of Black
Arts to talk with the Gray Sorcerer.
There they learned that Cinderella's
godmother had gone on a journey to
a far country and that, if they could,
contrive to break Cinderella's glass
clippers. the godmother's magic would
cease until she could return. In the
meantime Cinderella might lose the
Prince's love and he migrht marry the
younger sister, whose husband had
been drowned while fording a river.
The bad sisters found Cinderella's
glass slippers ia a casket and cruelly
ground them into atoms while Cinder
ella slept. Cinderella and the Prince
were awakened, the next morning, by
the. sound of laughter in the palace gar
dens. Cinderella ran to the window and
saw that which had caused the people
to laugh.
Six mice were trotting up and down
the ard/n walks, drawing- a pumpkin,
mhl a~T>tadv' T rat sat-nponr-the- pumpkin
acting as driver. Upon the pumpkin ,
â were six lizards. The mice stopped at]
the palace door and the black rat
knocked twelve times , and â¢> caHgd'
aloud:
"Cinderella, kitchen wench,, come to 1
us as we-found you. in rags'^and in
,d!rt! The time is ended when you can
finger delude the Good Prince by black
magic. HÂ«re, lass, ride with us back
to your chimney corner amid the soot
and ashes.". â¢' ' \ ' ; -
You all remember that when Cin
derella went to the ball given by . the
Prin< c she remained until the clock
struck 12. The black rat struck twelve
times on the door of the palace now to
make. Cinderella remember that time.
The Prince, hearing the voice, seized
his sword and was about to seek - the
intruder who had dared to so speak to
the gentle Princess Cinderella, but he
looked back and saw that when the rat
had ceased to knock Cinderella's silken
garments had turned to rags; her face
was soiled and blackened with soot; on
her feet" were coarse shoes. Tears rail
down her cheeks and streaked the soot,
and her grimy hands, rubbed upon her
face, made her look so unlike the Prin
cess and so like a scullion, that the :
Prince could hardly believe it was his
dear Cinderella.
Half blinded by her tears, Cinderella
â¢went to the casket where her glass slip
pers had lÂ»oen placedâ -her most pre
cious treasures â and there, when she
found them ruined, her heart beat
heavily and she sobbed aloud, for some
thing told her her days of glory and
happiness were ended unless her fairy
godmother would come to her aid. She
spoke aloud: ' ;
"Godmother, dear godmother, come
quickly, if you can." . . : '
But there was no answer. V â¢':'
The Prince left the palace that Cin
derella should not feel hurt by seeing
his eyes gazing at her while she was in
this sad plight. But now, when he had
gone, the wicked Gray Sorcerer entered â 
the palace, but looking so "â¢ much like :â¢
Cinderella's fairy godmother that thfl '
HERE IS AN "ACT" IN THE BUMPKIN CIRCUS THAT DID NOT TURN OUT JUÂ§T AS THE RINGMASTER EXPECTED,
poor Princess thought that her god
mother really stood before her.
"Cinderella," said the Gray Sorcerer
"you have lost the Prince's love bj
losing your glass slippers. He will losi
his happiness if you remain in thi
palace. I can do no more for you."
"And is my happiness at an end?"
"If you remain as Cinderella even
one will point the finger of scorn a'
you. and your sorrow will always b(
alive."
"Yet the Prince will return to me?"
"Never."
A SAD SURPRISE FOR CINDERELLA.
"Then I care not, dear godmother; do
with me as you will."
The Gray Sorcerer did not wait, but,
raising an iron wand, waved it in front
of Cinderella, who was turned at once
into a hideous old bag. Cinderella saw
herself in a mirror and fled from the
palace, covering her face with her
hands.
Cinderella's stepsisters, who were
watching and listening, were filled with
glee, and the younger sister now ran
out to where the Prince was.
"Dear Prince," she said, "it is to my
sorrow that my sister has returned to
her old condition of a scullion. Let me
comfort you."
But the Prince scowled at her and
turned away, hearing her hateful
words, and neither he nor Cinderella
was "seen at the palace for many
months thereafter.
Afar the Prince wandered, over
strange lands and stormy seas. One
day he fell asleep under a palm tree.
There Cinderella's fairy godmother
found him. As she leaned over her
crooked staff and gazed at him he
awoke.
"Arouse, Prince," said the fairy.
"Cinderella has been taken from you
by deceit. Her stepsisters and the
Gray Sorcerer have done this. Cin
derella is near, and she will be restored
to her old glory and you to happiness
if you are brave and true."
"Try me. I am bitterly sorry that I
THE SA^ FEAXCISCO CALL, SUXPAY, MARCH 13, 1898.
turned away from Cinderella. I will
do all that men can do."
"Bravely spoken, fair Prince. You
will haw your courage well tried."
A league to the south of the palm
tree rose a mountain that was all one
ruby. To this mountain the fairy led
the Prince. Striking upon a door in
the side of the mountain, with her
crooked staff, the fairy told the Prince
to enter. The door opened, and the
Prince went in. A few steps onward he
saw a statue, onfwhich were the words:
Stop, kind friend, and take my hand;
I am the Queen of Magic Land:
The Prince reached forth to the stat
ue his left hand, and seized his sword
with his right hand. His quick thought
of trickery alone had saved him. The
fingers of the statue closed upon hi?,
and were crushing them, when the
Prince boldly struck- off the head of the
statue with his sword. The hand of
the statue let him go at once, and he
walked on.
"'Help, oh. help!" *
A woman called to him â an old,
wrinkled woman. She stood on a lit
tle island in a river that the Prince had
not seen. On either bank of the river
stood a fierce lion. They were guards
6et there to koep the old woman a pris
oner upon the island. The lions were
very large and . very .ierociam*. The
Prince thought of Cinderella. While
she was so dear to 1 him, and he knew
that he would risk his life to go to the
rescue of the old woman, he ran to the
river bank. The lipn on that side of
the river crouched, ready to spring;
and from its shaggy throat came a
roar that well might have frightened
the Prince.
Holdinf his sword firmly the Prince
went toward the lion. I-n an instant
he might be torn by the lion's <4aws
and mangled by its horrible teeth. Then
the lion sprang at him.
Crash! The Prince's sword and the
huge lion have come together. Down
fell the lion and melted away into thin
air. So the Prince knew that the lion
had been put in his way by magic and
that his courage had been tested. The
river and the island and. the old woman
had gone from sight and the Prince was
alone in a gloomy cavern, through
which he groped his way in complete
darkness.
From the roof of the cavern dripped
a liquid that made the floor of the cav
ern very slippery. Far away the Prince
saw a faint light. Falling often upon
sharp-pointed rocks, and hearing the
hissings of snakes all about him, but
never daunted, he marched forward to
ward tire light. Soon the passage grew
so low and narrow that the Prince was f
forced to stoop to gv on. Unseen hands
clutched at him to hold him back.
Fierce voices shrieked at him. He
would not ctop.
In the very heart of the mountain of
ruby he found a wide, open space. No
sooner had he entered there than on all
sides he was surrounded by a river of
fire that, as it flowed near with cack
ling and roaring noises, ate away the
ground beneath the Prince's feet. Down
fell the solid earth, and the river of
fire had Jeft only one tall pinnacle of
rock for the Princ-3 to stand upon. The
flames lapped the sides of the rock,
roaring and throwing up great sheets
of sparks like a fiery spfay. Fumes of
sulphur and thick smoke nearly stifled
the Prince.
The Prince was nearly blinded by the
EDITED BY
DAVID H. WALKER
fierce glare of the flaming river, and
his ears were benumbed by strange
noises that came from every side.
Above all the din the Prince heard an
awful voice saying:.
"One more chance you have, Prince.
Give up Cinderella and marry her sis
ter, and you shall live. Refuse and the
rocks beneath you shall crumble and
you shall fall into the river of fire and
be heard of no more forever."
Firm stood the Prince as a statue.
His hands were raised toward heaven.
In his dark and flashing eyes was no
sign of fear. No, on his face there was
even a smile.
"No," he answered, "no, I will live
despite all black magic and I will find
out Cinderella yet and will restore her
to happiness."
"Reap then the vengeance you have
sown," said the same terrible voice.
"Down you shall go through the
crumbling crust of the earth into the
river of fire."
With a sound like thunder the rocky
pinnacle fell apart. Down, down,
dropped the loving and brave Prince.
He closed his eyes, expecting to be
dashed into the fiery stream. He
though that his fall was an age long.
His pulses tingled and his heart beat
very fast; but even as he fell he mur
mured the name of his dear Cinderella.
Gentle hands seemed to be staying his
fall. Half fainting, he was laid gently
upon a bed of flowers, in a great gar
den.
When he opened his eyes and looked
alH'ut, Cinderella's fairy godmother
stood near by. She looked at him ad
miringly and^wald:
"Your trials v are over. Look! Cinder
ella comes!"
The Prince saw only a bent old hag
coming along the garden path. Bus. the
godmother struck sharply on the gravel
twelve times with her crooked staff. At
the sound of the twelfth stroke Cinder
ella was restored to her old self. Smil
ing and happy, she and the Prince has
tened to embrace.
The Prince looked down. Lo! Cin
derella had on her glass slippers once
more.
"Dearest," said Cinderella, "I was the
old woman whom you saw on the is
land, and the two lions were my bad
sisters, who were punished for their
wicked deeds by being turned into wild
beasts. There, by the banks of that
underground stream, they will stand
forever, and always unhappy. Had
you failed to be brave and kind, when
I called to you for help, there I would
have been forced to stay. From now.
henceforth, there will be nothing to
mar pur happiness."
"Come then," said the Prince. "Let
us thank the fairy godmother for hex
help."
"I go now," the fair-- said, "and you
will see me no more, for you will al
ways be happy and there will be no
enemies to plot against you.^ Accept
my blessing and now farewell."
Hand in hand the Prince and Cin
derella passed through the pleasant
garden; hand in hand they entered the
palace. One growl broke in upon their
loving words. They looked at each
other, with tears in their eyes, for they
Borrowed in their moment of great joy
at the fate of the wicked sisters. One
growl, and only one.
The Prince and Cinderella lived hap
pily ever after. D. H. W.
PERSONAL VIEWS
OF YOUNG WRITERS,
Hugh Cunningham, aged 13, of Ala
meda, has some excellent suggestions
to offer to the boys and girls concern
ing the pending competition. JHis letter
is given in full, as follows:
I read with interest the article about
"the competition" and beg leave to make
the following suggestions;
That 18 be the age limit.
That the girls, out of courtesy, be al
lowed to have their choice as to whether
the girls or boys shall first publish their
That some prominent literary people act
as judges, one man and one woman.
That as some children are better at
compositions than at stories, and vice
versa, each shall write his or her choice,
and that the best of these be published.
I fully agree that the articles should
not be more -than 600 words in length.
The foregoing letter is selected from
a host for publication because it is so
practical and definite.
Beatrice Bailey writes from Rock
vine, â¬al., as follows:
Here is my suggestion for the new con
test in The' Call on the Boys' and Girls'
page. lam a member of the C. R. C, and
so I suppose I have a right to make one:
I think that such a contest as you sug
gest would just be grand. 1 think that it
would be best to have all the competitors
write stories, for. if some write essays and
some poems it would be hard to choose
the winners. I would suggest that at some
other time we have a poet's page and find
out who the best poets in the State are,
that is, the little poets, not grown-up
ones. I think the judges in the contest
ought to be educators and journalists, or
else just educators, and the committee
ought to be composed of two men and two
women, so that the men cannot be partial
to the boys and the ladies cannot be par
tial to the girls. I don't think any one
above 17 years of age ought to be allowed
to compete unless they are grammar
school pupils.
I hope you have the contest and I hope
the girls will win.
Probably Beatrice Bailey, on second
thought, would prefer that there should
be five judges, so that there might be
no possibility of a tie. But her sugges
â¢ tion is excellent that women and men
should be judges. Perhaps four judges
to be named might be authorized to
name the fifth judge. What Beatrice
says concerning the difficutly In judg
ing correctly, "if some write essays
and some write poems," is submitted to
the boys and girls for careful consider
ation. She does not agree with Hugh
Cunningham upon that point. The
discussion is open to all the boys and
girls of the Pacific Coast.
The question is asked by several:
"What will be done with the stories
and essays written by the boys and
girls which fail to be placed upon the
competitive pages?" The question Is
timely. The answer is that all stories
that are good enough will be published,
and due credit will be given to the writ
ers. The pages upon which the com
petition will be based will hold only a
limited number of articles. Other good
work will be used upon the Boys' and
Girls' page later.
Floyd Smith. 21 Bartlett street, San
Francisco, writes:
I think that the limit of age should not
he 16 years, because some who are over 16
are in the high schools and could write
very good stories. I should like the sto
ries to be fiction. I think that if Mr. Web
ster were appointed to name the jurors it
would suit all. The girls' stories were
printed first in a previous competition,
and I think it would be right and fair to
give the boys the first page this time.
DEAR GRANDFATHER,

My dear grandfather is miles away

My grandfather has a horse and buggy;
and he has a large farm in the country.
He has hens, ducks, dogs, pigs, pigeons,
cows and horses.
There are large green fields with wild

we pick some and make wreaths of them.

[NOTEâ The following little -stories were spoken by a three-year-old
child, the daughter of Mrs. M. L. Stewart of Visalia, and were taken
down in writing at the time or soon after. They are unique and so
thoroughly childishâ like very little childrenâ that they will appeal to all
who kno* and love the prattlers and can see beauty in their lives and
artless ways. This little girl has written many little rhymes.]
A BOY'S name was Ess. His name was Little Ess, and he had a
gun, and he shooted a long, long way, and he shooted his papa
and he died.
Then he put a picture in his gun and he shooted it.
Then he put in a thing that belongs to a gun and he shooted the
smoke out.
And his mamma called his papa. and little Ess said: "He can't come
'cause he's shooted."
His mamma said: "Well, then I'M nay e to get you another papa."
And so she went downtown and sne saw a white man, and he was a
nice man, and she brought him ho me -
Once there was a little boy and hÂ»s name was Board Nothing. He had
a little brother, and his name was Door Nothing. They went out to
play with two little girls, and their names was Little Kettle. Both of
em's names was Little Kettle. They went out for a walk a long way,
and they came to some water, and they took off their shoes and
stockings and all their clothes and waded into the water. And a man
came along and poked them out with a rope, and he said: "Here, you
little children is lost. Don't you think you'd better go home?" and he
put them on the train and they went home and they didn't go away off
any more.
A little boy's name was Don Loteeka. He was a good littleboy. His
sister's name was Fon Loteeka. She was a nice little girl. They were
good little children till they got big enough to go to school, and they
got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. Then they went away
and went to school.
One day they went out and what do you think theyÂ»saw?
A rabbit; and they took it home and et it.
Then what do you think they saw? A goose; and they took it home
and et it. â '
Then anunna day they saw a mouse, and they took it home and
et it.
Then anunna day they went out and they caught a rabbit, and they
took it home and they et it anunna day and anunna day, till they
couldn't eat any more.
And then the little boy went out and picked a rose.
One time a boy had a cat and it lived out in the barn. And he had
a little kittie and he fed it so much milk it growed and growed and
growed and growed, till it was a big cat â a big purr cat. and he losed it.
And then he had anunna kitten and he didn't lose it. He wouldn't
sell it for a nickel.
A man came along and wanted to buy it for a nickel, and he
wouldn't sell it. and the man kept the nickel
And he kept the kitten all the time.
And that's all the story.
A little boy went out to chop and chopped his finger off, and so the
next time his brulla (brother) came and chopped himself, and the little
boy didn't chop his finger off any more. His papa watched him and
his mamma put gasoline (vaseline) on his finger and wrapped it up. .and
to-morrow it was well.
. Mr. Zaze and Mrs. Zaze and a lot of little children â they was a
family. And Mr. Geeze's family was there too. And all of them were
here around the table eating their supper. And they were all very happy.
Mr. Zaze's little boy was down on the floor and a big, big snake
came along and it. took its bill and put it against him and then it et
him all up.
And when he was all et up and they couldn't find him any more
Mr. Zaze and all the family felt very bad and cried. And they were all
very sad.

BUDGE AND HIS
VERY QUEER PET,
BY LESLIE B. WOODRUFF.
Mrs. A. Voy, living on Howard
street Just beyond the "big bend," in
San Miguel, Cal., is the owner of a
handsome Newfoundland dog which
has recently become greatly attached
to a "make-believe" pussy cat. Budge,
for that is the dog's very suggestive
name, is a family pet, and during por
tions of the day. especially at supper
time, when the young members of the
Voy family have returned from their
daily tasks down town, is permitted to
have the freedom of the nome and to
frolic as she ploases. But when bed
time comes she must go down to the
basement and sleep on- the coal, with
only the rats, a stray cat or two and
her numerous fleas for company. It
was, no doubt, this absence of con
genial associates which caused Budge
to aoquire a most peculiar notion. One
day a neighbor threw into the Voys'
basement yard a stuffed cat â one of
those cloth affairs which mamma buys
at the dry-goods store and stuffs with
cotton for baby to play with.
The Newfoundland was lying In the
yard at the time, basking in the sun,
and was attracted by the imitation
tabby. Going to it she nosed It gently
for a few seconds, then with a warn
ing growl, picked it up by the neck,
the way that mother cats carry their
little ones, and carried it into her bed
by the coal bin.
Mrs. Voy witnessed the occurrence,
and going dowstairs endeavored to
take the toy cat away from the dog,
but was unable to do so. Subse
quently the rest of the family In turn
tried to coax the animal to let it go,
but without success. At nlpht Budge
and the stuffed cat are inseparable.

T. L. Hoaton Urges the Need of More
Attention to Oral Composition
in tho Schools.
In an address yesterday at the Univer
sity of California on "Secondary Educa
tion In America," Professor Elmer E.
Brown made an interesting comparison
between the social position of teachers at
present and that of tfachers in the prim
ary schools of the early part of this
century. He declared that the teachers
now enjoy advantages that make them
kings and queens compared with their
pedagogue predecessors.
Professor Brown dwelt upon the effect
of the earlier academies in broadening
the curriculum of instruction. He said
In part:
With the establishment of the earlier acad
emies there came a broader curriculum oi bec
ondary education, a curriculum which compre
hended science, literature and political mathe
matics such as were not taught in the colleges.
This broadening or the curricula ot the acad
emies affected considerably the subsequent de
velopment of the colleges. The academies
taught Latin and Greek and to some extent
religion. They added the study of English, and
this addition is due both to the teaching of
elocution and of English grammar. The
study of elocution was held greatly in esteem,
and Brown University received its name from
the ""Under of a chair of elocution In that col
lege. Noah WebÃter's reading books and the
national readers tllci much to create Interest
In the study of English literary masterpieces.
Natural science, and especially astronomy,
was the first branch of science studied in the
academies. Geometry was the first branch of
mathematics Introduced, algebra not being
studied until later. The curricula of some ot
the academies embraced almost the whole
field of knowledge. And although the in
structors in these branches were not what
would now be called specialists, there is no
doubt that many of them were men of won
derfully wide and wonderfully accurate knowl
edge. .
The position of the teachers of primary
schools In these times was worse than we can
easily imagine. Complaint Is often made that
teachers at present do not enjoy such a social
position as they should. Compared with the
teachers of the earlier years of the academy
period, however, our teachers nowadays are
kings and queens.
The movement toward education began In the
academies. Mount Holyoke Seminary, estab
lished In the early thirties by Mary Abbot, the
pioneer champion for the education of women,
was one of the earliest institutions founded for
the education tif girls. This movement toward
the co-education of women sprang up in Amer
ica without any influence from England. It is
one of the Interesting developments of English
institutions in America.
T. L. Heaton offered a number of in
teresting criticisms on practical methods
of teaching. He said in part:
Many teachers, young teachers especially,
make the mistake of introducing critical analy
sis into the study of literature. In teaching
children literature the aim should be to show
them the beauty of a certain work. There is
a tendency In the present method of teaching
literature toward teaching everything but the
artistic beauty of it. Literature should be
soul culture. The pupil should be made to feel
the beauty of literature. Unless the teacher
appreciates this beauty, however, the study
of literature soon degenerates into mere dis
section.
Mr. Heaton repeated his former declar
ation that in the matter of pronunciation
English usage should not always be fol
lowed. "Authorities on spelling should
not be disregarded," he said, "but in
doubtful cases an American authority
should be consulted. In such cases the
Century Dictionary is the preferable au
thority."
The speaker declared that in teaching
spelling the teacher should give words
which the children use, not words from
the spelling book. He commended the
old-fashioned spelling match, and stated
that too little attention is at present paid
to oral spelling. He urged strongly the
necessity of cultivating among children
the habit of frequently consulting a dic
tionary.
Mr. Heaton discussed methods of teach
ing composition. In his criticism he said:
We are disposed In these days to teach writ
ten rather than oral composition. The latter
Is fully as important as the former. Every
recitation should be an exercise In oral com
position. For written composition work paper
should be used. I would do away entirely with
elates in the schoolroom. The very first work
should be done on the blackboard and should
consist In the framing of simple sentences.
More complex subjects can be successively
studied. The habit of outlining, however,
should be taught as early as the third or
fourth grades, and then when the children
come to the eighth or ninth grades the habit
Is already formed. Nature study forms a good
subject for composition in the lower grades
Children like to write on things they know
something about, so natural objects make
much better composition subjects than such
topics as "Truth." "Virtue" or "George Wash
ington." Another thing of Importance Is to
have the compositions read before the class.
Tho child will take much greater pains to
NEWS OF THE MINES.
Rich Stores of Gold Are
Daily Unearthed in
the Hills.
Lucky Prospectors In Slsklyou,
a Lucky Blast In the Sell and
Luck Elsewhere.
Recently a report of a "rich strike" In
the western part of Slskiyou County was
chronicled In the telegraphic dispatches
In the usual vague and sensational style
of Buch reports, and the ore was reported
to go $20,000 a ton Instead of the $2000.
which is the regulation figure In such
cases. The latest account of this probably
valuable find Is the following from the
Blskiyou County Reporter of a ort Jones:
"A rich strike of quartz was made In
Spring Gulch, near Tuttle Gulch, in
Quartz Valley district, about the 20th of
last month. Jack Hay and Dave Kingery
were out prospecting and came across
surface Indications of a good ledge. Af
ter applying their picks a few times they
were delighted to find rock that was
heavily charged with gold. They then
commenced sinking, and as depth was at
tained the rock became richer. M. B.
Pitman of this place was out there last
Sunday and brought back with him pieces
of quartz that are wonderfullly laden
with the yellow metal. At that time the
vein was from two to four Inches wide,
and there Is a possibility that It may de
velop In size as it goes down. Pat Grif
fen Is Interested with Messrs. Hay and
Kingery In this discovery.
"Another rich strike has been made In
that vicinity, this one being on Tuttle
Gulch. About a year ago a tunnel sixty
feet long was run on the property. More
recently, however, another tunnel was
run lower down, and it was in here that
the rich rock was found. The vein has a
width of from four lncÂ»ies to five Inches,
and In quality it closely rivals the Spring
Gulch find. John and Henry Allen and
Dave Owens, all residents of Etna, are
the lucky owners of this property."
At the Sell mine, Tuolumne County, the
site for the mill Is being graded and de
velopment work is being rushed. A few
days ago there happened in the mine
something that is like what is hapoen-
writs a good composition If It.il to be read
before an audience than if It is merely to be
examined by the teacher.
A CARBJEKS ESCAPE.
A Plate-Glass Window in the Colum
ian Woolen Mills' Store Falls as
He Passes.
George "W. Yost, a letter carrier, resid
ing at 1228 Pine street, had a narrow es
cape for his life on Powell street.yes
terday while delivering mail to a barber
shop opposite the Baldwin Hotel. Yost
had just emerged from the Louvre and
was in the act of going up the steps to
the barber shop, when a large plate glass
window In the front of the Columbian
Woolen Mills' store, on the corner of
Powell and Eddy streets, fell with a
crash over his head. In dodging from
under it he fell against the stone steps
leading to the barber shop and received
quite a shock, which stunned him for
the time being. Police Officers J. Hayden
and B. Harter, who were on duty in the
vicinity, came to his assistance and con
veyed him to an adjoining store, where
he came to after a few minutes' rest. His
package of mail matter was taken charge i
of by Omcer Hayden pending his recov- i
cry.
The cause which led to the breaking of i
the window was the hanging of a swing- j
ing sign suspended from both ends by a j
flimsy fastening of screw-eyes and light
wire The high wind dislodged one side
of the fastening of this sign some time
before the accident occurred, and Officer
Hayden notified the proprietor to have it
attended to. This was done after a fash
ion, but the next gust of wind thf*.t struck
it knocked it against window with such
force as to smash the heavy plate glass
and send it out on the sidewalk with a
crash at the time that Yost happened \o
be passing.
CASEY THE KING
OF THE COURT
The Famous Brooklyn Hand
ball-Player Will Encounter
Local Men.
Is Here on Pleasure, Accompanied
by His Partner, Ex-Alderman
James Dunn.
Phil Casey, the world's champion hanu- j
ball player, is at the Grand with his !
friend and playing partner, ex-Alderman j
James Dunn of Brooklyn. They are mere
ly here on a pleasure trip of a couple of '
weeks' duration, and though Mr. Casey
has retired from the professional court,
yet ue will take on a few of the best i
players in the city and in a few games, in j
which the stakes will be the sport of the
thing, show tnem how a world-beater I
puts up a game.
The first game comes off to-day with
Casey and Dunn on one side and Jim
Nealon and License Collector T. F. Bon- j
net on the other. It will be played at
Phil Dunn's court on Howard street, near
Fifth, and a series of games between the
eStpert visitors and the best of our local
men will follow to-day's game. The ad
mittance at these games will be by spec
ial invitation, and as accommodations for ;
ladies have been provided it is expected |
that the gentler sex w.il be there to urge
on the contestants to their greatest ef
forts by bright glances and soft though
sincere applause.
Mr. Casey, who was for four terms a
member of the Brooklyn Board of Alder- <â 
men, is a well-preserved, good-looking
and active man of 50 years of age. He i
is the acknowledged superior of every i
handball player in the country to-day, |
though he does not now hold the profes- |
sional championship, having voluntarily i
resigned that title about a year ago, after
the great home and home match brought
Off in Chicago, in whic^h he and Mr. Dunn
defeated Louis K>egan and "William Car- '
ney, the track team of the Windy City i
for a $2000 stake. j
Since Mr. Casey's retirement from the i
professional ranks there has been no
recognized world's champion, though the '
two most promising aspirants for that j
title are William Carney of Chicago and i
James Fitzgerald of Tralee, Ireland.
May Exhibit at Omaha.
The demand for San Francisco exhibits ]
at the coming Omaha Exposition has j
caused San Francisco merchants to take j
more than usual interest in the affair,
and quite a number of prominent firms
will send the products of their work to
Omaha. Among those who are expected
to .make a strong exhibit is the Joshua |
Hendy Machine Works, of which Samuel ]
J. Hendy is the managing owner. The
exhibit of the works attracted considera- '
ble attention at the recent Mining Fair, I
and in case it is decided to send speci- '
mens of the machinery to the coming ex- j
position the exhibit will probably be as â¢
follows: Hydraulic gravel elevators, !
giants, water gates and pipe, the Hendy j
two -stamp mill, ore feeder, concentra- '
tors, horsepower hoisting whim, ore !
crushers, buckets and cars and engines '
for hoisting. Mr. Hendy has shown con- '
siderable enterprise in preparing exhibits I
for fairs and expositions.
Waller Granted a Continuance.
School Director Waller appeared before
Judge Cook yesterday morning, but, ow
ing to the death of the mother of Peter
F. Dunne, he was unable to appear, and
the case was continued for a week.
Ing In a good many mother-lode mines
these days. The Sonora Union-Democrat '
tells it as follows:
"On last Tuesday afternoon a fine body '
of specimen ore was uncovered at tne !
Bell mine, but the extent of the strike
has not yet been determined. A short !
distance from the face of the tunnel, I
which Is in several hundred feet, is an i
old stope, also a winze that has been !
planked over. Intending to do some wid- I
ening out at this point to put in a hoist- |
ing station. Foreman Louis Page had a
hole put In the vein, the shot breaking
loose a lot of quartz, much of which is
very rich. This was the first blast put ,
off in the mine under the new manage- :
ment, and a short time will demonstrate '
whether the discovery Is a bonanza or i
not. Those who had run the tunnel past I
this point missed the deposit of gold by |
not over six Inches."
Treasurer A. C. Wldber and other San
Francisco people took hold of the old and
abandoned Diamond mine, near Grass
Valley, about a year ago and proceeded
to put faith and capital into it. The mine
was cleaned out and retlmbered and de
velopment work proceeded with little en
couragement for several months. A few
days ago an ore body was encountered
and developed into a rich ledge. The av
erage value of the ledge is unknown, but
rich samples are reported to have as
sayed above $2500 a ton. Several of the
stockholders went to Grass Valley and It
has been decided to erect a mill at once,
beginning with five stamps. Thus this old
story of California mines is retold from
week to week as the riches of new and
old properties come to light in Increasing
number with the growth of faith and
mining enterprise.
It is an ill wind that blows nobody
good, and while miners everywhere In the
mountains are suffering from the short
age of water and anticipating a short
supply for both quartz and gravel mines
throughout the year, the men Interested
in river dredging and mining are happy.
The small supply of rain and the very
light snow fall in the higher altitudes all
over the State promise low water in the
rivers during the season and unless a
season of heavy precipitation comes soon
river mining operations will begin this
year six week earlier than usual.
A system of electric tramways in the
tunnels of the Tesla coal mine has lust
been contracted for, and within sixty
days electric trolley trains will displace
mules in hauling out the coal, and the
output will be doubled. Fifty more ex
pert coal miners from Coos Bay and
Beaver Hill have just been put to "work,
and the development of the mines and
the increase in the scale of operations are
rapidly going ahead.
The river dredger operating below Oro
ville is to have an electric plant, and then
the dredger will run twenty-four hours a
day, employing: three shifts of men.

The Salmon River country has had its <

district is opening up at a rapid rate and i
deserves much better facilities for get
ting freight than at present obtainable.

of its supplies at Redding if the much
needed roads were pushed from this side.

ing in the placers of that district and j

RIDEOUT TROPHY MATCH
A match for the Rideout trophy was played
last Saturday afternoon and evening in the
rooms of the Trlst Duplicate Whist Club, be
tween the Mill Valley Whist Club of Mill Val
ley and the San Francisco Whist Club.

Joseph G. Cox. Mrs. Dr. W. H. Love-
Thomas H. Reynolds. grove,
Arthur Brown. Mrs. M. W. Bell.
S. Abrahm.
Twenty-four deals were played in the after
noon and twenty-four In the evening. The
match resulted in a victory for the San Fran
cisco Club by a gain of nine tricks. Total
North and South score, 332 to 323.
The match was conducted on the American
Whist League two-table plan and umpired by
P. J. Tormey, president ot the Pacific Coast
Whist Association.
THE PLAY IN DETAIL.
Out of the 48 deals which constituted this
match 23 deals broke even, and San Francisco
gained on 15 deals with a total of 24 tricks.
Mill Valley gained on 10 deals with a total
of 13 tricks, which gives San Francisco the
match under the usual system of scoring by
gain nf 'J tricks.
Under the new method of scoring, counting
each of the 48 deals a match (North and South
score to govern), as suggested by the writer a
couple of years ago, and which will be tried
for the first time at the next congress of the
American Whist League, to be held in Boston,
a match tied counting one-half match won for
each, tm the score, San Francisco would win
by 2SU. matches against 21\s for Mill Valley, a
net gain of 5. Deciding the winner of a match
this way prevents sky-rocketing.
INTER CLUB WHIST PLAY AT THE TRIST.
In answer to repeated requests the Trist Club
announces for Thursday evening, March 17, at
their clubrooms, in the Berkshire on Jones
street, a tournament for teams of four â open
to all.
In the ladies' annex the highest average for
February was made by Mrs. Hendry, who
therefore won the set of Paine" s trays, the
prize for that month.
The popularity of this branch Is attested by
the large attendance and the constantly in
creasing membership. There are so many
ladles who wish to learn to play good whist
besides the many who do and yet cannot at
tend evenings, that this afternoon piay fills
a long-felt want. Every encouragement is
given to beginnersâ not only most competent
teachers, but the opportunity of playing with
experienced players. It is a question that per
plexes all clubs â how to handle the beginners,
who naturally wish better players as partners,
yet the better players do not care to deterior
ate their game by taking a poor player.
The Trist Club has solved the problem, and
on Friday afternoons and Saturday evenings
the abler players devote themselves to help
ing along the newer ones.
THE NEW CODE FOR DUPLICATE WHIST.
P. J. Tormey, chairman of the committee
on laws, reported progress at the Buffalo meet
ing and urged the appointment of four addi
tional names to that committee, making it nine
instead of five.
The president appointed Nicholas Browse

This committee has a gigantic piece of work i

tributed. by experts to the daily and weekly 'â¢

WHIST AT HOME.
Mrs. George E. Bates, wife of ex-President i

noon at her home, in honor of her mother's
birthday.
Sixteen enthusiastic lady whisters sat down ;

distributed to the winners by the hostess. :
Then a light lunch was served.
How nice it is for mother and daughter, ;
father and son, to be able to enjoy such a
pleasant recreative home amusement. What
a comfort It is when advance In years sounds
Its first notes of warning â when the eyes com- '
mence to dim â when reading is almost out of ;
the question, to be able to sit down at a table |
with those you love and converse with an in- â¢
telligence and eloquence never surpassed by the !
glibbest tongue the world ever heard â in the
beautiful language of whist.
