BANKERS REBELLED AGAINST
HART'S PERSISTENT BLACKMAIL
The Attorney-General Drove the
McDonalds to the Point
of Desperation.
Conspirators Began to Desert the Standard
of the Pacific Bankers as the
End Approached.
In the strangre history of disaster and
crime that marked the -existence of the
Pacific and Peoples' banks there are
few facts of more importance than
those published in The Call this morn
ing. The record proceeds to within
two months of the final crash in which
the bank went down. The conspira
tors who had thrived on the dishonesty
and the gullibility of the McDonalds
wÂ£re beginning- to desert. They knew
better than the deluded bankers the
true condition of the institutions and
i hey kne.w that affairs could not con
tinue much longer as they were. A. F.
Johnp saw an opportunity to condi
tion himself better with the enemies
of the McDonalds and he proceeded to
pick a quarrel. Dorn and Tomblin
were, becoming fractious and Hart was
becoming more insistent in his demands
for money.
There is in the whole history of the
Pacific Bank no more significant ele
ment than that involved in the relation
ship between W. H. H. Hart and the
McDonalds. Hart was then Attorney
General of the State and had bled the
McDonalds to such a point that they
could stand the torture no longer.
Hart in exchange for the money he
received gave the cloak of his official
position with which to cover the dis
honest acts of the bankers. In Feb
ruary, 1893, however, Frank McDonald
believed that the debt that they owe i
to Hart for his criminal support had
been paid and until they needed the
dishonest official again they rebelled
agrainst his demands. In a telegram
sent by Frank from Los Angeles it is
clearly stated and understood that the
McDonalds were paying Hart for bfa
dishonest services. They therefore had
a right to estimate the value of th<U
service and to resist what they deemed
extorfion. As tbe history of the bank
proceeds The Call will show how com
pletely the Attorney General was at
the command of the bankers when
financial rujn faced them.
Among all the quarrels of the con
spirators there were few that were
more serious than that between Frank
McDonald and-M. H. Sherman. Frank
in one of the letters published to-day
places jipon the shoulders of Sherman
the complete responsibility of the ruin
of the Pacffic Bank. The young banker
refers bitterly .to the fact that through
the agerrcy of Sherman the Pacific
Bank had- accepted 5581,000 in practi
cally worthless bonds. Sherman was
bitterly denounced for trapping the
Pacific Bank into this deal. The letters
published to-day will also show the
. desperate ' .measures , to which the
banker? resorted as the end drew near.
.Instead of attempting to recover them
selves Frank McDonald' and his brother
plunged deeper Into wild speculation.
Their, crazy financial fancies had full
swing and new and - heavy losses were
incurred." The young bankers knew that
â¢ they . were being more â¢ carefully
watched by the official- examiners and
.. recourse was. hÂ£jÂ£*to' a deliberate falsi
.- fication of h*^&i>oks.- ; In this - way
seme of the old and disastrous schemes
.."were made responsible for heavy losses
'.that did not .belong: to . them. ; New
ventures in which vast sums of money
â¢were sunk escaped and such specula
tions as the John Brown colony were
debited with great sums never re
ceived. In this way the thieving bank
ers were enabled to plan 1 and execute
new robberies 1 under the mask of -old
and bad speculations.
the McDonalds rebelled at
! (?i4 HART'S exactions.
â '.In air the correspondence of â¢ the
managers, manipulators and wreckers
of the Pacific and People's banks there
Is no more important daeument than a
telegram which Frank McDonald sent
to K. H. McDonald Jr. on February 5,
â  1892: It has been hinted that W. H. H.
, Hart, who was then Attorney General
of the State, had neglected His. duties
in connection with the McDonald 1 in
stitution and the Bar.k .Commissioners.
The Call is enabled to state positively
this morning that W. H. H. Hart was
criminally in collusion with the Mc-
Donalds and was demanding loans and
.financial accommodation for his silence
and for his r refusal to force the man
agers of the wrecked bank to stop their
robbery of the depositors. The first
proof of Hart's collusion was given In
the following telegram:

When Frank V. McDonald again
wrote jto his . ; brother '. the - letter was
The San Francisco Call
I mailed in New York and shows the
scheming dishonesty not only of the
McDonalds, but of the men surround
ing them and urging them on to finan
cial destruction. New projects, crazy
in their origin, crooked in their de
velopment and disastrous in their con
clusions were being floated. Treach
ery against Captain Jim McDonald
was being planned. More money was
ordered from the Pacific Bank unjustly
for the private use of the elder Mc-
Donald. The letter Is exceptionally In
teresting and is as follows: /
â â  , ' N. V., March 15, 1893. â¢
My Dear Brother: I have been wait
ing, hoping, praying for sales to send
you coin, but nothing seems to materi
alize. If we had only begun a year
earlier here we might now be doing a
good business. We think, however,
we now have matters in shape to go
ahead, especially with the California
j Raisin and Fruit Growers' Associa
. tion in stock-bond sales. You will see
the idea is to provide a guarantee if
asked for, but to make the guarantee
such that it will seem more attractive
without it. This makes it safe and
attractive for the investor whichever
way it gees, and provides reasonable
compensation and protection â¢to the
bank for its guarantee.
While I was in California Edmin
ster & Co. and Eastland kept on work
ing on these questions and did. I think,
good' work. You will also notice I have
4 perfected arrangements for the Alaska
Coal i Company's . stock .In a way that
protects 'us. I have sent you the con
Â« tract for keeping among your papers
and other contracts for the bank. We
have perfected the statement and
other .data. â FeJotH*eÂ«'tÂ»-t*ie~Mqhawk
bonds, and any day we hope to report
the sale of them. . Now that we have
our guarantees in shape .1, shall run
up to New Haven and Hartford and
Boston and see if I cannot establish
some agency that will bring us in
some money. . \ â  v . ' -â ;
That fellow Fitch Jr. is only a blow
hard, and you want to look-out for
him. We have refused; to send him
any more money, and now he is turn
ing to you again. Be very careful what
you say to him or promise him. The
form of contract he asks for is ab
surd and impossible, and you only
waste your time considering them.
And you better not encourage * him,
dealing first with us and then with
you." It will confuse us all. Our ex
perience with him is not satisfactory.
All he is after is to make a living out
of it regardless of results." Father le"ft
last night for Hot Springs, North
Carolina, to be. gone one or two weeks,
or possibly more. Father's funds have
run down, and he "wishes you . would
send $1000 to the Commerce for his
credit. That letter from Walter, Park
Bank,' that was addressed to you. ask
ing, about California Raisin and Fruit
Growers' Association,' bore its. good
fruit. He came in to-day and bought
one hundred dollars-w orth of stock.,
and we have several others. that have
promised to purchase soon. ' :
I hope we can make some kind of an
arrangement with Captain on -his
money, for â it is discouraging to â¢ be
trying to get in money and then have
him draw.it out. We must settle with
the institutions here before we think
of settling among ourselves.: Keep try
ing to sell father's real estate on Sac
ramento street and Sl3 Sutter street,
and try to sell the remaining bank real
estate. Let Miss Grant look after these
things. ' -?
I think in writing to father you better
again mention the fact that it would
be desirable for him to sell those
houses and Electric stock's,- even at a
â  loss; and I shall do the same. Tell him
now if* the time we need coin to meet
these Eastern obligations. Hoping you
are not giving way under the strain, .-'
as I am, and that success may crown
your efforts. I am as ever, your loving
brother FRANK.
The foregoing letter was written nine
weeks before the Pacific and the Peo
ple's banks crumbled. When the epistle
was penned, Frank McDonald and his
brother Dick were playing their double
parts of fools and knaves. The Cali
fornia Raisin and Fruit Growers' Asso
ciation to which reference was made
was a scheme concocted by A. F. Johns
j to further his own i mis and feather his
own nest. The McDonalds were in
veigled into It. and when the banks
failed the colonists of the John Brown
i Colony began to discuss legal proceed-
I ings to recover land that they insisted
had been stolen from them in the or
ganization of the California Raisin and
Fruit Growers' Association.
In all the wild ventures of the Mc-
Donalds there was nothing more ab
surd or more dishonest than the organ
ization of the Alaska i'oal Company.
The McDonalds placed W. H. Eastland
at the head of this concern, permitted
him to overdraw many thousands of
dollars on the bank, and not satisfied
with that guaranteed thousands of dol
lars of his coal company's stock that
was not worth a cent. The character
of this coal company may be very
clearly understood when it is said that
it existed only in the brains of those
who had organized it. There was no
coal in Alaska, and the company had
no other reality than that given to it
on paper.

SPIRACY BY FITCH AND
JOHNS.
Shortly after this letter was written
Frank McDonald sent a telegram to his
brother in this city and to A. F. Johns
in Chicago. These telegrams give 'the
first sipn of a quarrel between Johns
and the McDonalds. Johns was then
in Chicago with Thomas Fitch Jr.. both
seeking 1 to HOat the California Raisin
and Fruit Growers' Association to thMr
own best advantage. After working:
upon the McDonalds for years, .Johns
saw that the time had come whore he
could work upon somebody el.iii more
completely and so he pressed the quar- ,

FRANK REBELS AGAINST HART'S DEMANDS.
There are few documents in the corresp ondence of the Pacific Bank conspirators that are of more general interest than
that which is given above. When Frank McDonald sent this telegram to his brother, W. H. H. Hart was then a
debtor to the Pacific Bank to the amount of many thousands of dollars. He was Attorney General of the State, and was
criminally in collusion with the thieving bankers. The exactions of the Attorney General for money became so fre
quent that Frank urged his brother not to pay. They had Hart, they thought, in a position where he could not
very weli antagonize them, for a while at least. He wanted money, and Frank very clearly indicates in his telegram
that Hart's demand for money was nothing more or less than blackmail. As the history of the ruined bank proceeds
â¢ it will be shown what Hart gave In return for the money received.
rel. On March 16 Frank sent the fol
lowing telegram to Johns:
NEW YORK, March 16. 1893.
A. F. Ji/nus. care Thomas Fitch Jr.,
Tribune Building: Your telegram
disrespectful and I decline to discuss
!t. Better deal directly with my
brother if you think he has the solÂ«
power to act F. V. McDC A.L.O.
On the same day Frank McDonald
"SHERMAN HAS ALMOST RUINED US."
Two months before the failure of the banks Frank McDonald wrote a letter in
which he placed on the shoulders of M. H. Sherman the responsibility of the
ruin of the two institutions. While the banks had been led into many disas
trous speculations, none had been more disastrous than the Los Angeles Elec
tric Railroad into which the bankers had been inveigled by M. H. Sherman.
In April, 1893, Sherman and Frank quarreled and in that quarrel the two con
spirators revealed the secrets that are now of such public moment. The fac
simile given above is an excerpt from McDonald's letter of bitter accusation
against Moses H. Sherman,
sent the following: dispatch to his
brother, R. H.. McDonald Jr.:
NEW YORK, March J lÂ«. 189 S.
R. H. McDonald Jr., Pacific Bank,
San Francisco, Cal.: Johns telegraphs
somewhat disrespectful^- that he has
agreed for sale of entire raisin issue
under instructions from you, thus
practically ignoring this offer and
confusfng all our plans and agree
ments. Under these circumstances I
â wish nothing further to do with the
matter and you have made bad mess
for us all. FRANK.
Telegraphing on the same matter,
Frank dispatched the following to his
brother:
NEW YORK, March 23, 1898.
R. H. McDonald Jr., Pacific Bank,
San Francisco: Johns and Fitch both
here. Both tricky on Raisin question
and have to be watched very care
fully. Their present plan dangerous
and impracticable, and they offer only
80 cents for new 6 per cent bonds. We
are trying: to see if we can devise any
practicable thing we can accept.
FRANK.
On the same day, in a discussion of
the same subject, Frank also sent the
following telegram to Dick:
Better wire Johns to return me Rai
sin trust agreement. It should never
have ?>een given to him. It is not '
trust deed, but trust agreement, and
our private matter, and that copy was
for confidential use of you and Pacific.
We really did not wish him to know
exactly its contents.
Two days later Dick received another
telegram from Frank, who indicated
the progress of the conspiracy as he
urderstood it. His dispatch was as
follows:
Having much trouble with Fitch.
He claims you and Johns made con
tract with him for new 6 per cent
bonds, which we must issue and de
liver or he will sue. FRANK.
FRANK STANDS UP THE SOUTHERN
PACIFIC
On April 10, 1893, Frank wrote to
Dick, telling him of his treachery to
that offshoot of the Southern Pacific
Company, the Pacific Improvement
Company. Frank needed money bad
ly; he knew that he had the Pacific
Improvement Company by the throat
and took a desperate chance. The
young schemer also told his brother
how he had failed to get any money
out of his father. The young man wrote
as follows:
NEW YORK, April 10, 1593.
My Dear Brother: I have been after
father to send you his stocks to sell
but thus far without success; but he
to-day turns over this little dab of
fifty shares of California Electric
Light to be sold for his account and
he says to send on his two hundred
shares held by Miss Grant and he will
indorse them and let you sell thÂ«m
too. I hope to-morrow to have an
other check from the Pacific Improve
ment Company !n payment for an
other batch of their bonds. They
practically agreed to take them all bo
fore this, but they are so hard up and
are obliged to redeem so many bonds
they have guaranteed to take back,
that they ask for more time and are
even willing to pay accrued interest
from the first of the month for our
waiting. I hope, however, they will
come to time to-morrow. Our placing
them with the Commerce. Park and
Chemical and then stirring them up
with our own brokers and finally my
threat to place them in the hands of
the auctioneer, Adam Muller, and let
thf-m go down to 50 if need be (sve of
course buying them in to protect our
selves), and thus have a public quota
tion that would be disastrous to all
their business of sales and borrowing.
This they could not stand, so they
are buying them in as fast as they
can. The auction matter was the last
desperate remedy, and if it failed
would have broken my own market
and made us lose greatly more on
theirs. Of course you understand while
the sale was made through Crane, an
acquaintance of Eastlapd, and ono of
the Southern Pacific's outside ms'i
here, I could have made it through
other agencies the minute the S. P.
crowd were willing to buy. Only
probably Eastland got one-half of ons
per cent the better price. I am ufraM
the S. P. people do not love us very
much for forcing them to buy. Al
though they have made us lose $10,
000 by their bad faith in not protect
ing their securities as they sail tl.ey
would do when we bought them. Your
loving brother, FRANK.
THE CONSPIRATORS HABITUALLY
FALSIFIED THE BANK RECORDS

scienceless, was never better Illustrated

lation of the Pacific Bank's books, :tÂ»
save himself. Considering the inter,
ests involved the letter is perhaps one
of the most cold blooded illustrations
of rascality that the public of San
Francisco has read in many a day. The
document is as follows:
NEW YORK, April 13, 1893.
My Dear Brother â I enclose state
ment from Eastland that explains it
self. We think this means a sale on
basis telegraphed you, 86 and accrued
Interest. They wanted my guarantee
as cashier and father's as witness, but
I thought best to keep father off for
reasons you can appreciate. So I sug
gested, as they wished the seal of the
bank, they better have the acting ex
ecutive officers, which they finally
agreed to. I have written the Chem
ical a letter asking them to send you
the Phoenix bonds they hold, telling
them we thought we had sold them,
but that it was necessary to provide
for interest payments in New York
and bonds would need to go to San
Francisco for suitable indorsement.
You will need to get from Dorn or
some other reputable attorney a brief
.statement concerning trust deed; that
it is in legal shape, and etc., and, as
D. S. drew the deed he can give this.
Also an attorney's opinion will be
needed on the powers of the bank to
guarantee the bond. The uonds being
our property and we getting the money
for same and there being no third par
ty concerned, I see no reason why we
cannot guarantee them just the same
as we pledge ourselves to redeem a
time certificate or any other time obli
gation for which we received the
money.
I notice Sherman said he could sell
100 water bonds. He telegraphed me
that he thought he could sell a hun
dred to Chicago friends and wished
forty days' option. He stated no price.
no certainty, nothing. I telegraphed
him parties here were working on the
sale and we -could not tie them up
such a long time. All his talk was In
definite uncertainty. He sflj* he wouid
write about the offer, but he never did,
so you can judge for yourself how
much there was to his so-called sale
The loss we make on these Phoenix
bonds you can charge to the Phoenix
stock account, but I am at sea to
know what to charge the loss on the
Southern Pacific bonds. If the Mo
hawk expanses were not so high I
should think it best to charge it to the
Mohawk stock account on the idea
that we had sold the bonds to get
money to develop that with, or per
haps better yet, charge it to stock ac
count of Los Angeles Electric Rail
way, since on this account chiefly all
our losses have been made and we
have five thousand shares full paid
stock, allowing quite a latitude of
charging. Your loving brother
FRANK.
"THE ELECTRIC ROAD HAS AL
MOST RUINED US, AND SHER
MAN IS A FOOL"
It has not infrequently been said that
when thieves fall out honest men get
their dues. M. H. Sherman ,*n-i Frank
V. McDonald quarreled in New York
The result of that quarrel so far aB
there was any public interest in it is
the admission of Frank V. McDonald
that M. H. Sherman and the "Los Ange
les Electric Railroad -were the agents
through which ruin was brought to the
Pacific and People's banks. In a letter
written on April 21, 1893, Frank V. Mc-
Donald characterizes M. H. Sharman as
a liar and a fool and the one iK-rson
above all others who is responsible for
the wreck of the bank. During all the
silly negotiations of the conspirators in
New York to negotiate the electric road
bonds, Frank McDonald was nev*.-r
blind to the fact that these bonds were
never worth more than fifty cents on
the dollar. In other words he charges
that M. H. Sherman had already cost
the Pacific Bank more than $580,000. It
is pertinent to remember that not only
the patrons of the Pacific Bank but the
thirteen thousand poor depositors of
the People's Home Savings Bank are
interested in this letter. The epi3tle is
as follows:
April 21, 1593.
My Dear Brother: I have written to
you several times to-day, but I only
wish to add a line about Sherman's
saying I got away with any electric
bonds. It is a lie, and the records of
the number of the bonds and where
each is will show it, while on the con
trary he did get some bonds. The
bonds to which he refers are those is
sued in partial compensation for the
losses made by the bank in taking
electrics at par and in my being
obliged to neglect so many things for
the electric' load that subsequently
resulted In losses to the bank and that
I carried under my name as trustee.
The bank got every bond and they
took the place of the trustee account,
I even putting into it bonds that ought
to have been mine, but I considered
my first duty to the bank.
Some of those things thus charged
off may eventually earn something for
the bank if ever the unfortunate con
dition that the electric road has
plunged us Into will enable me to give
my attention to the development of
them. But whatever we may make
from them will be a mere bagatelle
to the losses the road has cost us and
daily causing us with $581,000 in bonds
good as worthless to us in our safe.
Sherman is a fool on this subject.
He does not see that that road has
nearly ruined us as ho has engineered
it. and that the bonds at 50 cents
would be dear. God only knows what,
it will yet cost us to get out of the
thing in all its complications.
I have not a single bond in my name
nor any of the proceeds of any, and
all I got out of the five bonds he gave
me I have more than put back out of
my salary and out of what pa allowed
â¢ us each in savings bank stock divi
dends in money that I have snent for
the Pacific and People's Home. This
you can snow him at any time, and
he dare not deny the truth of It. But
all the time you give him on the sub
ject is as good as thrown away. You
- better keep this letter, as in case of
-my death he might be dishonorable

enough to say something untrue. Tour

THE APPALLING RECORD OF THE
JOHN BROWN COLONY.
In the next letter that Frank V. Mo-
Donald wrote, he reviewed a grecit deal
more pertinent history of the conspir
acies that ruined the Institution ,of
which he was cashier. In the foregoing
letter he denounced M. H. Sherman
most bitterly. In the letter that will
follow he attacked A. F. Johns, D. M.
Tcmblin and D. S. Dorn, For a year
these men had been befuddling him
with the affairs of the John Brown
Colony and the schemes of the city of
Madera. He expresses a fear that A.
F. Johns was then plotting against him
and his interests and intended to Â£Â» '
over to the enemy. Frank wrote as fol
lows :
NEW YORK, April 21, 1893.
My Dear Brother: For nearly a year
I have been trying to get a clear idea
of the Madera tangle, but neither
you nor Johns, nor Tomblin, nor Dorn
seem to have the whole matter in clear
shape, and as the time is now at
hand when the matters are to pass
into others' hands it is necessary to
know just what we are doing, or we
may commit some serious blunder. By
a clear idea I do not mean any con
fused, garbled, general statement, '
such as I have hitherto been favored
with. After much difficulty and by put
ting together one thing and another
I understand the position to be as fol
lows, but I may be all wrong, and if so
I should be right at once and
clearly in detail.
THE SITUATION.
When the Brown and Baird collapse
fame we had in about $73,000. You
subsequently invested $40,000 in the re
organisation of the bank at Madera,
and you bought the $110,000 Chapman
second mortgage by paying $70,000 cash
and reserving $40,000 for ' the Peo
ple's Home first mortgage, and you
have since spent some $40,000 for devel
opment. In other words, the invest
ment there is, first, original outlay for
advances, $75,000; second. Chapman's
second mortgage, $110,000; third, devel
opment, $40,000; fourth, Madera Bank,
$40,000â total, $265,000. We had to 'as
sume deposits of Madera Bank to be
added to this figure. But since the Ma
dera Bank stock is a separate asset
it need not be considered in this state
ment, and therefore the net amount la
about $225,000. Now the question is, "
is this correct, and I wish you and
Bellerman will try and answer this
without mixing up with it a whole
lot of other ifs and ands and buts.
Again, how does the $40,000 item re
serve from the $110,000 Chapman sec
ond mortgage to settle with the Peo
ple's for the first mortgage appear on
your books? Is it already charged
to the colony debt, or when you pay
it to the People's will it thereby in
crease the present indebtedness to the
colony? Nobody seems able to tell
me this.
In fact, I wish to have Hill's crowd, .
if possible, pay us back now the
moneys we have advanced Hughes and
Martin and step in our place, and then
we do not care what happens. Now
the question is, What is our plan to
work out of these investments? As I
understand it, it is as follows: Firstâ"
We segregated the property into two
pieces, one of 4000 acres, on which col
ony claims had been sold, including the
Madera town lots. Second â The other â¢
piece of some 900 acres we formed into
the California Raisin and Fruit Grow
ers' Association, of which we own the
stock, and which ought to be worth a
good share of our $225,000 debt, if not â¢
all of it. Certainly, if our scheme of
selling either the present coupon stock
bonds or if the new scheme of issuing
new straight bonds goes through, wo
will get back our entire money out of
this land alone.
If Tomblin had not thrown away $12,
000 of Ellsnor property I got from Baird
and had not foolishly bought that
fraudulent Madera Bank stock from
Woodward of Fresno we should be in
some $17,000 more than he has blun
dered away from us. While I have no
doubt Johns is doing the best he can
for us, yet I feel he has made some
plan for the future with the Hill peo
ple. And I expect he Is to be tnelr
manager at a fine salary and is to
have a good place for his son and also
get a good slice of the stock, xhis is
the reason he is so anxious for Hill
to get us paid off and get closed up
with us, so that he can turn in and
work with the new crowd. The things
for us now to consider carefully are
whether we want any special work
done by Johns before he joins the
other crowd. I think we ought to
keep friendly with him for many rea
sons, and 1 see no reason why we
cannot, "Your loving brother,
FRANK.

With Maggots.
Special to the Sunday- Call.
CINCINNATI, Nov. 4.â The War In
vest f gat ing Commission had an inter
esting session to-day. It had among
the witnesses four officers who served
In the Santiago campaign, erne of them
being General H. C. Egbert, who, as
lieutenant colonel of the Sixth United
States Infantry, was shot down at San
Juan Hill by a bullet piercing his chest.
The general appears entirely recovered.
Lieutenant Colonel Miner, now in com
mand of the Sixth Infantry, was an
other interesting witness. Perhaps the
Â° most suggestive testimony was that
given by Major Griffith of Kansas City,
who was in charge of the Third Divis
ion hospital of the First Cori>s. The
commission expects to complete its
work here to-morrow evening and to
resume it in Chicago on Monday morn
ing.
Dr. Menage, contract surgeon, serv
ing with the Sixth Infantry, testified
as to the absence of hospital tents, for
his regiment in Cuba, He treated his
Bick in the regiment in preference to
sending them back to the division ho-s
.pital, because of the difficulty in trans
portation. The nearest hospital . was
perhaps a mile and a half away.
The medical supplies were reasonably j
sufficient. His chief trouble was in get- j
ting an ambulance. This he got after j
a delay of two days. The regiment left i
there about the 9th of August. At that \
time there were about thirty err forty
men in acute condition. Perhaps one
eighth of the command was reported
regularly for treatment.
Lieutenant Schendel of the Sixth In
fantry was the next witness. At San
tiago he was made commissary. Neces
sary supplies were always sufficient,
except such delays as were unavoidable
from rains and difficulty of transporta
tion. After the fall of Santiago the
regiment was fully supplied. At Mon- j
, tauk Point the supplies were sufficient, j
but during the first week they were ;
sometimes delayed until late in the day j
by insufficient railway facilities. This ;
was soon remedied. The men were well I
taken care of by the medical depart- j
ment. After reaching Montauk Point
the men rapidly broke down. Not more
than twenty-live or thirty escaped ill
ness of some sort. The witness was
ill twice.
Lieutenant Colonel Miner, command
ing the Sixth Infantry, regarded the
Tampa camp as excellent.
The transport Miami, in which his
regiment went to Santiago, was not fit
for troops. The men would have died
in their quarters if the voyage had
not been mild, so that the portholes
were left open and air thus supplied.
The supplies of the men and officers
were the same. Most of the officers
were on foot * from loss of horses.
Speaking of the attack at San Juan
Hill, he said he found when they
reached the summit that Colonel Eg
bert had been wounded, and he was in
command. That night' no supplies
came and the men were without food
or blankets, except such food as they
had in their haversacks.
The witness said the command began
to break down about the 14th. They
had dug trenches at nieht and* lay in
the wet ditches all day. The hot sun
and the wet weather broke the men
down. When a march of three miles !
was made not more than one-fourth of
the men kept up, but all ffot in by
night. The morning after the surren
der the witness took the regiment to
higher ground and kept them In camp.
By personal appeal to General Kent,
he secured one wagon and cooking
utensils and a change of clothing for
the men. Centralization was the trou
ble â centralization in staff depart
ments, he meant. If the witness could
have got one wagon after the surren
der he could have kept his regiment
supplied. But nothing could have pre
vented the sickness that followed the
exigencies of the Cuban campaign.
Being asked about the diet, he said
he would recommend pickles and vege
tables for Cuba. The canned beef was
nauseating, and men who were almost
starving would not eat it. It seemed
to be meat that had been boiled for
extract and was as free from nutrition
as chips.
Colonel C. B. Hunt of the First Ohio
Infantry testified that when his regi
ment reached Chickamauga it was
poorly supplied with clothing and arms
and never was fully supplied ,and never
had a requisition filled completely. If he
made a requisition for 500 blouses h<Â»
would get 150. The sickness among the
troops was not the fault of the camp
and not due to lack of medicines, but
more to the incapacity of the com
manding officers in not enforcing dis
cipline and giving necessary care.
William H. Davis of Cincinnati was
the next witness. He was sent to
Chickamauga to examine the water
supply, which he reported as bad.
General H. C. Egbert was examined.
He is now Brigadier General of Volun
teers and Colonel of the Twenty-second
United States Infantry. He com
manded the Sixth Infantry after the re
tirement of Colonel Coohran until he
was wounded July 1. He had no fault
to nnd with the camp at Tampa or the
supplies, or even with the transport
Miami, except with the ventilation.
General Egbert said the Seneca was
not in good condition for transport-
Ing troops, and that its officers did not
seem to me in command along the voy
age as much as the surgeons. When
the Seneca reached Fortress Monroe
the surgeon telegraphed to New York.
The next day, to his surprise, the ves
sel had not gone. He asked why and
was told the captain refused to go until
ordered to do so by the Quartermaster's
Department. The witness called on the
captain and found this to be true. After
remonstrance against holding the
wounded men in such a place, the wit
ness told the captain he would tele
gTaph to the Secretary of War telling
him of the conditions and asking for
orders.
Meantime he sent a note to the quar
termaster at Port Monroe, and as soon
as the situation was understood there
an order was given for the vessel to
sail at once to New York and the cay
tain obeyed it.
Fred J. Flueger of Newport. Ky., tes
tified th;st he went to Chickamauga
August ] to bring home Albert Boe
decker of the Second Kentucky, who
was lying in the hospital. He found
him In a very bad condition. He was In
a tent with four other patients, the
space between the cots bo narrow that
witness had to Walk sideways in go
ing through. The nurses; were .-detailed
men.
In an adjoining tent ha heard groan
ing, and, looking in, ha saw a man with
a quantity of maggots on his body. He,
reported this immediately to the at
tendants, who said they did not know It
had happened. They carried' the man
out, washed him ort and took him back.
The next day he died.
The witness detailed Boedecker's
case, how he took cold from marching
through the rain and was -taken". sick
the day he reached Chlckamauga. He
was at first refused admittance to the
hospital, but finally the captain got
him in. He lay there twelve days on a
blanket on the ground, with one blan
ket over him. 'men he was sent to his
quarters for full duty* and next day at
inspection he stood in line three hours,
when he again broke down. He reached ,
home August 2 and died August S.
5 At the afternoon session Major Grif
fith testified regarding the camp condi
tions at Chickamauga and the hospi
tals. He had difficulty in getting enough
tents, and when he secured the proper
number he found the last ones were of
poor quality. Prom private and State
sources the, regiments- were supplied I
with hospital tents: As a rule the men
detailed. as nurses were unfit. Witness
asked Dr. Hot* for female nurses.. This j
relieved the situation. The staff of the
division hc-spital was inadequate when;
the- increase of sickness occurred. Sick
ness among the surgeons reduced the
working force. He said there would j
have been ho difficulty in getting hun
dreds of competent surgeons at Chicka
mauga within a week. He said he knew j
many applications were refused. He I
attributed the failure- at the Camp
Thomas hospitals to "red tape" and
"peace for thirty years," which inca
pacitated the department for expansion
for emergency.
If Congress had established a hos
pital corps the trouble might have been
avoided. ( One great difficulty in get
ting supplies of drugs arose from pass-
Ing requisitions from the division sur
geon to the. corps surgeon and the sur
geon-in-chief. This required a. week.
He asked the corps commander on
June 20 to have typhoid -patients i
-in-chief. This required a week,
asked the corps commander on
20 to have the typhoid patients
isolated. . The epidemic could thus
have been avoided, but no attention
was given the request. He regarded
flies and water as the causes of the In
fection. The beer drinking and the
unwholesome food assisted in develop
ing typhoid germs. The mortality
from typhoid fever in this hospital was
sixty-six out of 1587 cases.
Captain out of 1587 cases, Seventeenth
aptain Springer of the Seventeenth
Infantry was next examined. He co
operated with the surgeons at and af
ter the battle and knew the wounded I
were well cared for.
Father Valman, post chaplain, was I
examined. He served at Tamna, Camp |
Thomas, Fort Sheridan and Fort
Thomas. The witness heard 'no com
plaint at Fort Thomas from either
friends or patients. At first at Fort
Thomas there was trouble -for lack of I
good nurses, but that was soon reme- j
died. In certain cases he regarded |
men better than women for nurses, but |
as the work is now divided so that :
men do the work proper for men and I
the women attend to such things as I
women can do better than men, he
thought the perfection of nursing had I
been reached.
The witness devoted his time to look
ing after the patients. He wrote to
the friends of each patient giving them
information as to his condition. This
course was one of great satisfaction to
the patients as well as to their friends.
He repeated that the satisfaction to
atients as well as to their friends. I
epeated that the soldiers had j
spoken in the highest terms of their
treatment at the hospital. Being
asked what complaints, if any, he had
heard from patients about their treat
ment at other places, he said that he
had heard nothing whatever from sol
diers of the regular army, but that a
number of the volunteer soldiers had
told him of disagreeable experiences,
which were often answered by a sol
dier on the next cot by the question
'.'Did you think you were going to i
picnic?" He said none of these com
plaints were of such a nature as to
cause him to make any investigation.
GENERAL LAWTON
GIVES TESTIMONY
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4.â Acting for
the War Investigation Commission,
Colonel Denby has taken the testimony
of General Lawton, who was in com
mand of the second division of the
Fifth Corps in the Santiago campaign,
and who has but recently been relieved
of the command of the Department of
Santiago.
Replying to a question as to whether
the navy should not have control of
the transports. General Lawton said:
"No, indeed."
"You think that the army ought to
have control of them?"
"Absolutely," was the laconic reply.
"While they are acting together?"
Colonel Denby asked, and the reply
was:
"They won't act together. That is
where I make my point. Two men
cannot command the same affair."

NO BREAK IN
NEGOTIATIONS
FOR PEACE
Joint Session of the
Commissions.
OUR PROPOSITION REFUSED
SPANIARDS OBJECT TO DEMAND
FOR THE PHILIPPINES.
Paris Papers Continue to Argue the
Cause of the Dons and Liken
Uncle Sam to a High
wayman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 4.â The lolnt session of
the Peace Commissions lasted two
hours. The Spaniards refused the prop-
osition made by the Americans on Mon-
day last, but the negotiations were not
broken off. While it is believed that
no formal counter proposition was
made there was a discussion of the
Philippine question outside the lines of
the Americans. The commissions then
adjourned until Tuesday next.
A statement is nrinted here to-day
with much prominence that at to-day's
joint session of the Peace Commissions
the Americans insisted upon a complete
surrender of Spain's sovereignty over
the Philippine Islands, and that, in the
event of the Spanish Commissioners re
fusing to agree to this. Judge Day,
president of the American Commission,
acting under instructions from Wash
ington, declared he would present an
ultimatum to the Spaniards. It is fur
ther alleged that this seeming haste is
due to the desire to settle the negotia
tions before the elections in tne United
States take place.
Reference is made to these allega
tions in view of the fact that they may
have also been circulated in the United
States, but there is no truth in the
:nents made. No ultimatum is
contemplated and there is no probabil
ity of drastic measures being taken by
the Americans. The two commissions
are now considering an open question,
and the Americans expect to carefully
weigh all the points involved and to
carefully consider the arguments of the
Spaniards.
The two commissions met at 2 o'clock
this afternoon. The Americans were
aware before the session opened that
the Spaniards would decline their pro
posals made on Monday last.
The Gaulois to-day says it has been
Informed, on absolutely reliable author
ity, that Spain will refuse to discuss
the unconditional surrender of the
Philippine Islands. Spain, it is further
asserted, had made particular reserva
tions concerning the retention of the
Philippine Islands, and the Spanish
Minister of Foreign Duke Al
modovar de Rio, had himself, at the
time of the signing of the peace proto
col, stipulated that the island of Luzon
alone should remain occupied by the
American, troops while the peace nego
tiations were in progress, and that
Spain should resume sovereignty over
the archipelago as soon as a more lib
eral form of government for the isl
[ ands should have been decided upon.
The Fronde says: "The claims of
! the United States on the Philippine Isl
ands are looked upon with disfavor at
j St. Petersburg. The powers might, in
case of America proving too obstinate
on this point, be provoked to protest."
The Evenment says: " 'Your money
or your life' is the attitude taken by
I America in relation to Spain. The lat
ter, having no money, offers Porto Rico
and the abandonment of Cuba, and
thinks she has thus discharged her ran
som. 'Pardon me,' answers Jonathan,
'you yet have the Philippine Islands,
which are only an encumbrance to
you. I will relieve you of them. Why?
Because, with Fontaine, I have the
strongest reasons for so doing.' "
SPAIN NEVER INTENDED
TO GIVE UP PHILIPPINES
MADRID, Nov. 4.â The Imparcial to
day, commenting upon the peace ne
gotiations now in progress in Paris,
says: "If the United States had shown
in the protocol the intention to keep the
Philippine Islands the matter would
not have taken the course it did. Spain
never considered the Philippines as
lost, nor has she desired their loss. On
the contrary, her Intentions were shown
by her facing the anger of Ger
many on the question of the Caroline
Islands."
In conclusion the Imparcial remarks:
"America, by her conduct, has lost her
place among civilized peoples, and
henceforth will only count as the most
numerous and opulent of hordes."
DRIFTING BACK TO THE
OLD BENIGHTED DAYS
Khang Nyi Influences the Dowager
Empress to Re-establish Arch
ery in the Chinese Army.
PEKING, Nov. 4.â ln spite of the formal
promises of the Chinese Foreign Office,
there is every indication of a concerted
movement of Chinese troops in the neigh
borhood of the capital. It is said that
Khang Nyi, the Manchu officer, who was
next in rank to the late Prince Kung In
the Kioun Xi Tschu, or Council of State,
has obtained great influence over the
Dowager Empress. He is bitterly anti
foreign and hopelessly conservative. It is
probable that Kang Nyi was the instiga
tor of the edict re-establishing the bow
and arrow exercise for the Chinese sol
diers.
It is reported that Yuan Shik Hai, the
Chinese general in command of the for
eign-drilled troops at Tientsin and an offi
cer whose power is much dreaded by the
Dowager Empress and her advisers, has
received a grant of money, ostensibly for
the purpose of increasing the strength of
his division to 30.000 men "if time shows
that the Dowager Empress can rely upon
hia fidelity." It has been said that Yuan
Shik Hai might use his troops in conform
ity with the views of the foreign Ministers
at Peking.

OFF TO JOIN DEWEY.
The Cruiser Buffalo Starts on Her
Voyage to the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4.â Admiral Bunce
telegraphed the Navy Department to-day
that the cruiser Buffalo, Commander
Hemphill, had sailed for the Philippines
via the Suez canal. The gunboat Helena
sailed yesterday fqr the same destination*
With these aceppsiong coming Immediate
ly upon the heels of Captain Barker's

HANCOCK'S BROTHERS
CLOSE HIS MOUTH
Refuses to Discuss the Story of Dou-
ble Murder Told by Mrs.
Gross.
SANTA ANA, Cal., Nov. 4.â John Han
cock, believed to be the murderer of John
Engelks and Pete Edmlnston, was not
taken to Fullerton to-day to have his pre
liminary examination on a charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon upon one
Gross at Fullerton a few days ago. To
day Hancock was more communicative
than yesterday. To a reporter he ad
mitted making the trip from Riverside to
Salt Lake City by team In company with
Mrs. Gross, alias Mrs. Myers, who now
accuses him of murdering the two -men,
and talked freely of the dual life led with
the woman, but he denied knowing or
ever hearing anything about either En
gelke or Edminston.
Upon his arrival here yesterday Han
cock-was met by his two brothers, Tom
"â nd \\ alter, both of whom were closeted
with him more than an hour and imme
, aiately afterward he refused to be inter
viewed. One of his brothers a short while
ago conducted a gambling den here, and
it now transpires that a chum of his re
cently, while under the influence of liquor,
told a portion of the murder story to a po
liceman, but the officer paid no particular
attention to it at the time, thinking the
fellow was only indulging in drunken
talk. The next day, however, the officer
tried to learn more of the story, but Han
cock's friend had sobered up somewhat,
and would say nothing concerning his
statement of thedayl before.
HOBSON STILL WANTS
THOSE SPANISH HULKS
Argues With the Bureau Chiefs to
Allow Him to Continue Work
on the Wrecks.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4.â Constructor
Hobson was before the Naval Bureau
chiefs again to-day, and spent two hours
in argument to convince the board of
the advisability of allowing him to con
tinue the work of wrecking the Spanish
warships sunk off Santiago. Secretary
Long had concluded that further.prosecu
tion of the work would better cease,
at least so far as it is conducted at Gov
ernment expense. However, he consented
to allow Mr. Hobson an opportunity to in
duce the Board of Bureau Chiefs to re
consider their original determination.
The constructor was reinforced in his
opinion that the Colon and perhaps one
or two other ships might be saved by Mr.
Merritt. of the wrecking firm of Merrltt
& Chapman, although his opinion is in
turn contrary to that of the wreck mas
ters on the spot at Santiago. Mr. Merritt
was not present fit this afternoon's meet
ing, so the board contented itself with the
recommendation to Assistant Secretary
Allen, who has the matter in charge, that
the Merritt company be allowed to con
tinue its work on the Colon under an
agreement to pay salvage only in case ;
the vessel is raised, and meanwhile to dis
continue the heavy per diem payments
the company is now receiving.
CARPENTER WILL CASE
IS FINALLY SETTLED
On the Fourth Trial a Verdict Is
Found for the Bailey Chil
dren.
STOCKTON, Nov. 4.â On the fourth
trial of the famous Carpenter will case
here the jury to-day brought in a verdict
for the proponents of the will. On the
first two trials verdicts were given for
the contestants and the third was a mis
trial. Twice the Supreme Court 3ent the
Cape back for a new trial. The estate was
W-orth about $75,000 when the contest was
commenced fourteen years ago. Judge
Van R. Paterson of San Francisco was
then Superior Judge here and prasided on
the first trial, appointing J. A. Louttit at
torney for the minor heirs, and he has
finally won the verdict sustaining tbe will.
C. W. Carpenter was the partner of C.
K. Bailey in ranching in this county
many years ago and, being a bachelor,
on his death willed his proerty to Bailey's
children. Vermont relatives of Carpenter,
whom he had not seen for a quarter of a
century, contested the Tvlll on the ground
of undue influence and the surviving part
ner as executor has persistently fought
the case fn all the courts until now. The
litigation will probably end with the ver
dict given, as the estate is about eaten up
in costs of the long legal fight.
YOUNG HUNTERS KILL
A FEROCIOUS WILDCAT
The Animal Makes a Fierce Fight Af-
ter Being Wounded by
Shotguns.
TULARB, Nov. 4.â Yesterday, while
George Blakely and Robert Smith were
hunting doves near Chism's ranch, five
miles southwest of Tulare, a large, vicious
wildcat made its appearance but a few
steps from the hunters. The guns were
both loaded with small bird shot, and both
boys opened fire upon the cat. This only
served to infuriate the brute, and he came
direct for them. As firing small shot at a
wildcat was of no avail clubs were re
sorted to and a pretty battle took place.
The cat made a desperate fight, but
against too great odds, and the life was
soon batted out of the savage feline. Aside
from a few scratches the young men were
comparatively unharmed. The cat meas
ured throe feet from head to tail and was
two feet high. Very few specimens of the
wildcat are ever taken on the plains, and
this was one of the largest ever captured
in this vicinity.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 4.â A semi-official note
issued this evening says the Govern
ment has resolved not to retain the
Marchand mission at Fashoda, adding
that this decision was arrived at by
the Cabinet after an exhaustive ex
amination of the question. The Gov
ernment, replying to an interpellation
to be asked in the Chamber of Depu
ties, will avail itself of the opportunity
to explain the motive far this resolu
tion.
LONDON, Nov. 4.â The most reliable
information from Paris confirms the
earlier reports that M. Dupuy, the
Premier, has decided to wash his hands
of Fashoda and to recall Major Mar
chand, for whose mission he is not re
sponsible.
This decision is, to some extent, due
to a desire to allow nothing to interfere
with the success of the exposition of
1900.
PREMIER DUPUY READS
MINISTERIAL DECLARATION
PARIS, Nov. 4.â The Chamber of
Deputies reopened to-day with a crowd
ed assembly, after its adjournment on
October 25, the day after the fall of
the Cabinet presided over by M. Bris
son. Amid great animation the new
Premier, If. Dupuy, read the minis
terial declaration. He began by declar
ing that the Cabinet fully recognized
the difficulties and responsibilities of
the task undertaken, affirmed the su
premacy of civil power as the funda
mental principle of a republican state
and expressed confidence in the army,
which, he added, wo-uld faithfully re
spect the laws of the republic.
Continuing, M. Dupuy said: "I do
not leave the national army a butt to
the campaign of insult waged against
it if we place it above the blind po
lemics which futilely seek to throw un
just responsibilities upon it. The army
is still more entitled to the solicitude
and protection of the public powers,
since it can only work usefully for the
security of the country in quietude and
silence. It is equally necessary that
calmness attend the work of justice,
and respect of our duty is to insure
the execution of its decisions, what
ever they may be."
The Minister of Finance, M". Peytral,
introduced the budget, and M. del
Casse, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
replying to demands for the discussion
of the Fashoda question, said he was
unable to fix a date for it, in view of
the interests he had to safeguard, but,
he added, he hoped to arrange an early
date for its discussion.
The Minister of Justice, M. Le Bret,
replying to a motion providing that all
revision cases be submitted to the whole
Court of Cassation instead of to parti
cular departments, said it was impos
sible to alter tne procedure already
started in the Dreyfus case.
The house then adjourned.
GREAT OVATION TO
GENERAL KITCHENER
LONDON, Nov. 4.â The streets of the
city were crowded all morning, an im
mense number of people seeking to wit
ness General Kitchener's triumphal
progress to the Guildhall to receive
the freedom of the city of London and
the sword of honor presented to him in
recognition of his defeat of the Der
vishes at Omdurman. The general re
ceived a great ovation as, accompanied
by three aides-de-camp and dressed in
full general's uniform, with the Egypt
ian sash, he drove through the streets.
At the Guildhall there was the
quaintest kind of a ceremony, which
was witnessed by some 3500 spectators,
chiefly city dignitaries and their fami
lies, though Lord Rosebery and Lord
Halsbury, the Lord Chancellor, and a
few other notabilities were present.
There was a scene of great enthusi
asm when General Kitchener took his
place on the dais by the side of the
ADVEJiTISEMEiVIS.

And always will be for those who do not count the costâ those who pay
too .much for their whistle, as Franklin did. ' But for the man ror woman
who looks out to have either income or earnings, and then ; knows how to
take care of it, this world offers"many pleasures that the spendthrift, the
miser or the credit buyer knows nothing about. The purchasing power of
money, cash money, is as little understood as the government of the Phil-
ippines. How to buy, what to buy, when to buy, where to buy are all in-
teresting studies to the thrifty merchant or housekeeper. If these prices

General Kitchener, in replying, ex-

Schoolteachers.
THEY REPUDIATE A TICKET
WAS FIXED for BY EMPLOYES
OF BOARD OF EDUCATION.
Expected to Retain Their Clerkships
by Promising the Support of
the Teachers to Demo
cratic Nominees.
An Investigation has been made regard-
Ing the origin of the so-called "teachers'
ticket," with the result that clerks in the
office of the Board of Education are
Ehown In an unenviable light.
This ticket, which bore the heading,
"Regular Teachers' Ticket for School
Directors," appeared some weeks since.
It was at once repudiated by the teachers,
who affirmed that no candidates for places
on the board had received their indorse
ments. With their repudiation of the
t'lectioneering dodge began an inquiry as
to the sponsors of the ticket, and it re
quired but little inquiry to fix the blame
on- persons employed in the office of the
Board of Education.
Charles W. Welch, secretary of the
Board of Education, is charged with hay-
Ji\g originated the scheme, the object of
which was to catch the votes of persons
In sympathy with the teachers. He was
aided in carrying out the planu by Ral
eigh Hoe, John O'Donnell and John
C'ashin, attaches of his office.
These men, who are in the employ of the
city, went to all the Democratic candi
d.Ji|es for School Directors and asked each
Jiominee to pledge himself to retain them
In their respective positions, and in re
â  turn promised to place their names on
, the so-called teachers' ticket. It is pre
sumed the Democratic candidates for
places on the Board of Education gave
the desired assurances that the men
would be retained.
Thf names of eight Democrats appear
on the ticket, thus giving a safe working
majority. To lend a non-partisan look i
to the ticket, four Republicans were
named. This leaven in the Democratic i
loaf was made up of the names of George !
R. Armstrong, John J. Conlon, W. A.
Kemp and J. M. Thomas. The eight '<
Democrats who are supposed to have i
committed themselves to the scheme were
Benjamin Armer, H. W. Brandenstein, A. i
A. Cavagnaro. Dr. P. J. Conran, William ;
N. Cannon, Charles P. Eells, D. F. Keefe ]
and Timothy J. Lyons.
Policeman Dugan, truant officer of the
School Department played his little part I
in the distribution of t"he pasteboard j
tickets. He went among all the janitors
of the schools and enlisted their aid in i
spreading the cards where they would !
do the most good.
The quick repudiation of the alleged
ticket by the school teachers has had its
effs-et. and the work of the men who
would manipulate the School Department I
to subserve their own ends has gone for j
naught.
Work of the Christian Commission.
A long letter has been received from
Messrs. Glunz and Jackson, representa
tives of the Army and Navy Christian
Commission at Manila. They landed on
the evening of August 7, and pitched their
tents a.t Camp Dewey, where they at
tached themselves to the hospital corps of
the Thirteenth Minnesota and were with
them during the attack on Manila. The
next few days were spent In visiting the
wounded at the hospitals. A building has
been secured at Malate which will ac
commodate eighty men and services and
prayer meetings are held regularly. The
first services in the tent were held on Sun
day, September IS. One hundred and
twe"nty men were present in the morning
and 125 in the evening, 'the average daily
atendance has been 200. A Young Men's
Christian Association with twenty-four
active and five associate members has
been formed in the Third Artillery, and it
has fitted up a room with desks, station
ery and reading matter. There Is a great
demand for papers and magazines of re
cent date.

CONFIDENT
THEY WAIT
THE BATTLE
Republicans Sanguine
of Success.
PARTY IN FINE CONDITION
PATTON HAS MADE REMARK
ABLE STRIDES.
Candidates Have Gone Among the
Peopls and the Canvass Has
Bean a, Personal One
All Through.
The municipal campaign at the pres
ent time Is In excellent shape and the
Republican managers look forward to the
battle on election day with the utmost
confidence. It has been many years since
the party went into a contest in such
good condition as to harmony in the ranks
and with the working forces ao well
equipped for effective service.
The battle for the principal offices, in
cluding Mayor, Assessor. Recorder, Sher
iff, Superintendent of Streets and the Su
pervisors, goes merrily on, and with any
thing but satisfaction to the fusion forces.
The remarkable strides made by Patton
â within the last two weeks, coupled with
j the questionable record of Mr. Phelan as
I a tricky and unscrupulous politician with
which the people have been made ac
quainted recently, points plainly to the
defeat of the boss of the job-chasers and
the ticket he forced upon the Democrats
of this city.
At the headquarters of the Republican
County Committee yesterday the utmost
Mnfidence was expressed as to the out
me of the contest. It is asserted that
? Republicans have every reason to look
" victory by reason of their solid fight-
S front and the discontent and disorgan
ization of the Democracy.
The Republicans from the beginning of
the campaign have pursued a different
policy from that which has obtained in
the past. Instead of the usual methods,
the candidates are going among the peo
ple, meeting them personally.
They are letting themselves be seen, and
are telling the voters what the platform
demands an.d what they propose to do in
case of their election. The good effect of
this policy Is being shown in a very grat
ifying manner. Steady gains are being
made and if the present conditions hold
until next Tuesday there is no doubt ex
pressed that the splendid ticket put up by
the Republicans will be substantially In
dorsed Dy a majority of the people.
In the shrievalty contest the rapid
strides made by Henry S. Martin as a
vote winner is spreading dismay in the
ranks of his opponent, who is now at
tempting to play on the sympathies of the
public by parading the fact that in the
assignment of places on the ticket he
drew the unlucky number "13." This fact
is being paraded on a transparency
wagon that blocks up half of a street.
Notwithstanding his size. Martin is "get
ting a move on" that surprises the ath
letic Democratic candidate. The fight
has progressed to such a point that bet
ting men are not looking for investments
at even money. The same may be said in
the mayoralty fight. It was only a few
days ago that long odds were being given*
on Pheian. but yesterday there was no
Phelan coin in sight, and the men who
are confident of Patton"s success had to
offer good odds to create any interest
among the followers of the plug-hat boss.
There 16 every indication that so far as
success is concerned there is but one man
in the running for County Clerk. "Billy"
Deane is conceded to have taken the lead
at the start, and he has been increasing
it every day until it is thought that his
j opponent will do well to keep within the
; distance pole.
j In the contest for Assessor the judgment
of those who have made a canvass of the
field is that he is a sure winner, lie is
making a lively man-to-man campaign,
and there is no one betting that he won't
be Assessor for the next term.
Among others who are confidently de
clared to be making a winning fight are
AI Berthler, candidate for Recorder, and
1 Edward I. Sheehan for Tax Collector.
Ex-Judge D. J. Murphy, who set such
i a fast pace for his rival In the beginning
j of the campaign, has not slackened his
' speed, and is regarded as a sure victor.
The Republican candidates for Auditor
* and Assessor are working a quiet cam
paign, and, in the language of the proph
ets, their proposition looks like a "cinch."
In the Supervisorial contests It is be
: lieved that Phelan's "tourist" candidates
will have the pleasure only of moving
; "back home" and anathematizing their
! boss for placing them in such an equivocal
; position. Among the Republican man
agers it Is asserted that if a Democrat or
two steps in "it will be an accident."
Republicans Rally.
BERKELEY. Nov. 4.â Republicans ~f
the university town were out in full force
to-night to greet Alameda County's can

Victor H. Metcalf, candidate for Con
gress., gave the opening address, outlining
his views as to the national policy and
GREAT RALLIES AT THE FINISH.
Henry T. Gage to Close the Campaign in San Francisco at Woodward's
Pavilion To=Night â Parade of Uniformed Clubs â Victor Hetcalf in
Oaklandâ lnterior Mass=Meetings.
The Republicans of California are confident of victory, but they do not propose to let up for an instant.
On the contrary, they are determined to press the advantages of this hour until the anarchists and single tax
ers are completely routed. Cheering reports came from various sections of the State yesterday. The mem
bers of the Republican State Central Committee have not made public the result of the interior canvass, but
something must have transpired since Thursday evening to cause the betting fraternity to wager two to one on
Gage's election.
Great rallies under the banner of Gage and Neff will take place throughout the State to-night and next
Monday evening. The farmers, the stockmen, the miners, the wage workers in every branch of industry, and
the progressive business men will turn out to attest their devotion to the cause of good government and to
condemn the isms and fads of Maguire's fusion party.
Attention of the masses in San Francisco is directed to the great Republican demonstration announced
to take place at Woodward's Pavilion this evening. In honor of the closing event, the uniformed clubs of the
party will parado and the night shall be filled with patriotic music. Eloquent exponents of Republican doc
trine will make brief and brilliant speeches, calculated to inspire the party workers with renewed energy and
enthusiasm for the battle next Tuesday.
Henry T. Gage, the Republican standard bearer, will be the leading speaker at the great demonstration to
night. He has stood up to his work manfully since the opening of the campaign, enduring hardships of travel
and campaigning that would wear out any ordinary man. He was in fine form yesterday, and will no doubt
make an inspiring speech at the mass meeting to-night. Among other speakers listed for the closing event are
Van R. Paterson, Tirey L. Ford, Frank McGowan. Julius Kahn, C. L, Patton, D. J. Murphy C. F. Curry, W.
F. Fitzgerald and W. A. Deane.
In Oakland Senator George C. Perkins and Victor Metcalf will address a vast assemblage of people. Mr.
Metcalf's address, which will be a speech of superior worth, will be published In full in The Call to-morrow
morning.

ministration. He was followed by various
candidates. Hon. A. C. Geary of San
Francisco, the speaker of the evening,
made an eloquent defense of the adminis
tration. He argued at length for the re
tention of the Philippines and the policy
of national expansion, evoking much ap
plause by his references to the heroes of
the late "war.
Alameda Democrats.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 4.â The largest gath
ering of the present campaign In Alameda
greeted Governor Budd in Armory Hall
to-night. The Democracy had an audi
ence that taxed the seating capacity of
the hall. Budd was given a most enthusi
astic reception. He charged the Republi
cans with avoiding the railroad question,
which he said was the only issue In the
campaign. He said it made no difference
if Maguire was a single-taxer, as he had
no more power to enact such a law than
the man in the moon. J. J. Tobin, Walter
D. Stradley and several of the county
candidates spoke. Stradley's address
captivated the audience, and he was fre
quently Interrupted by cheers.
CROSSED THE RUBICON.
I A certain member of the House of Rep
!- resentativee was railed on not long: ago to
' deliver a few remarks to a gathering of
' Sunday school scholars, and he chose
I "Determination" as the theme of his dls
{ course. Ranging along among those char-
I actors in history who have made them
selves familiar by their courage and r^eso
i lution, he logically touched upon the ca
| reer of Julius Caesar.
"And last," he said in an oratorical
i flight, "Julius Caesar, filled with the spirit
; that leads men on to glory and to ever
lasting fame, looked toward the wonderful
capital of his country sitting on the seven
hills and from her throne or beauty ruling
the world. He felt the pulses of his fu
ture greatness throbbing in his coursing
veins and from his serried legions' front,
far to the north, he saw the path that
'stretched from the tent door of the plain
commander of the Roman soldiery to the
golden steps of the imperial structure
that crowned the Capitollne Hill. Then he
gave the order to march, and the hosts
swept shouting forward until their course
was- stopped by the rolling floods of a
mlghtv stream rushing resistlessly to the
sen. Here Caesar halted, but for p.n in
stant only. In that Instant the glorious
visions of more glorious Rome filled his
ambitious being and Caesar crossed the
Rubicon. Crossed the Rubicon," he re
peated to Intensify his period, and then
asked with all the orator's fervor. "And
why did Caesar cross the Rubicon? I ask
you. why did Caesar cross the Rubicon?'
"I know," piped up a small boy before
the speaker could get to his next sen
tence "He crossed It 'cause he wanted to
git on the other side," and there spread
over the boy's face such an innocent look
of pleased triumph In having helped the
orator out that it was really heartless to
reprove him. But it crippled the speech
badly. -Washington Star.

meeting to order and presented Judge
G. E. Otis as chairman of the evening.
After a long talk for party union Judge
Otis started to introduce the speaker
of the evening, when a gentleman in
the audience arose and asked to be al
lowed to say a few words. He was
called to the platform and proved to
be Z. B. Stewart, who made a short,
pithy speech that set the audience wild
with enthusiasm. Stewart's earnest
ness was Infectious and his arraign
ment or the party of organized greed
was severe, but deserved.
Hardly had Stewart closed when Hugh
Percy, a brother of the middle-of-the
roader, arose from the audience. His
request to speak was the signal for an
other storm of enthusiasm and his sen
timents met with a complete ovation.
He said, in part: "I also am one of the
middle-of-the-road Populistsâ an open
confession is always good for the soul.
(Cries of 'Good! good: That's so! 1 ) I
take this occasion to make the confes
sion, not only to you, but to the entire
world. I was one of the representatives
of San Bernardino County who met in
Sacramento for the purpose of nomi
nating the People's party ticket. In
the effort we were frustrated, by a class
of men who crept into the People's
party under the guise of honesty and
have undertaken to trade the principles
of our party for place and power. That
we will not permit. This necessitated
a division and we came to a parting of
ways. I thought at the time that we
had cleared the ship of state from the
barnacles which were hanging to her
hull, and that we would be able to go
into a clear political sea, but the Su
preme Court decided we had no place
on the ticket, and as good citizens we
bow to the law. There is. then, but one
thing left. That decision of the Su
p.erne Court practically forbade 40,000
citizens of California from casting their
votes for the principles they desired to
support. Thus we have a condition to
meet which few men in political life
have ever been confronted with. As
my friend Stewart said, I do nrrt love the
Republican party more, but despise any
party that will crawl in and undertake
to stand on so many platforms that it
would puzzle a centiped to furnish feet
for all of them.
"I ask you. Populist friends and Silver
Republican friends, how it is possible
for you to maintain the principles
which you advocate and yet support
James G. Maguire, or any man on that
ticket. I cannot, will not, support
James G. Maguire." (Cheers and cries
of That's right.)
George A. Knight then took the floor.
He first remarked that he had never
before believed in the Biblical story of
the Prodigal Son until the speeches of
the above gentlemen, but he was glad
to welcome them back and proud to see
them stand up for principle. He then
went on with a Republican speech that
was eloquently strong and created a
fine impression.
An overflow meeting was addressed
by Judge Rossiter of Pasadena. Thus
closed the greatest rally the county has
ever known.
"FOREVER NEVER."
"The 'forever, never* refrain of 'The Old
Clock on the Stairs' seems so entirely
the natural language of a ticking time
piece that It Is almost provoking to learn
that it was not directly suggested to
Longfellow by the voice of a clock. He
got the idea from an old French mission
ary." etc. I should doubt it. Do you
know some remarkable blank verse by
the late Lord Tennyson, written at 14.
quoted in the memoir by Hallam. ("Lord
Tennyson," volume I, page 26)?
"There's a clock in Pandemonium.
Hard by the burning throne of my great gr&nd
slre,
The flow vibrations of whose pendulum.
With clink-clack alternation to and fro.
Sound 'Ever, Never,' thro" the Courts of Hell."
The late Poet Laureate used to say
about these lines: "These are very good
lines for a boy, but if I were to publish
them now the press would at once say
that I had copied them from Longfellow,
or that Longfellow had copied them from
me."â The Spectator.
Shall We Keep the Philippines P
Public opinion Is divided as to the wisdom of
keeping the Philippines. Wise statesmen are
found on both sides of the question. Publlo
opinion, however. Is all one way In regard to
the wisdom of everybody keeping their health.
For this purpose Hostetter's Stomach Bitters
Is widely used. This medicine Is both pre
ventive and cure for malarial fevers, stomach
disorders, torpid liver and impure blood. It is
agreeable to weak stomachs and soothing to the
nerves.
3THOUSANDS RALLY TO
REPUBLICAN STANDARDS
GAGE ADDRESSES NINE
IMMENSE GATHERINGS
With Charles L. Patton and Others He
Is Given an Enthusiastic
Greeting.
A BIG bonfire on the corner of FHlmore
and Pine streets last evening at
tracted a crowd of over a thousand
of the citizens of the Western Addition
to Franklin Hall, where they were ad
dressed by Henry T. Gage, Eugene F.
Loud and nearly all of the candidates on
the municipal ticket. The audience was
as enthusiastic and as representative as
any that has gathered to applaud party
I favorites thus far in the campaign.
Henry T. Gage and Charles L. Patton
' were tendered an ovation that was Re
markable even among the many rousing
receptions that have been extended to
them since they began their fight, and
though neither gentleman spoke at length
they spoke to the point and their audience
demonstrated its satisfaction in round
after round of wild applause.
G. R. Fletcher, as chairman, introduced
John B. Carson, candidate for the Supe
rior Bench, as the first speaker of the
evening. Mr. Carson observed judicial
dignity to the extent that he ignored his
own case and appealed to his hearers for
support of the whole Republican ticket.
He urged that the voters of the State
should send a solid delegation to Congress
and elect a Republican Legislature in
order that President McKinley might not
lack the support that he will need in fur
thering the splendid plans that he has for
the future welfare of this country.
Mr. Carson was followed by John D.
Siebe, who found that he was just as pop
ular in the Western Addition as he is in
the other sections that he has canvassed.
Congressman Eugene F. Loud took Mr.
Siebe's place on the rostrum and roundly
denounced the course that has been pur
sued by James G. Maguire and his sup
porters during the campaign. Mr. Ma
guire's career in Congress he laid before
Ms hearers without any of the garlands
that James G. Magulre makes use of in
telling it, and to the fusion nominee's
action on the funding bill he paid par
ticular attention.
"My record." he said, "is clear to any
one who will read It, ajid I shall not
stoop to defend myself against any cur
who is ashamed to sign his name to his
lies."
Mr. Loud would have dealt further with
the Democratic roorback but for the ar
rival of Charles L. Patton. who had some
difficulty in making his way through the
crowd that had gathered to greet him.
He finally reached the stage, and he was
followed by genial Henry Martin, who
had even more difficulty in breaking in.
Mr. Patton promised that if elected he
would guarantee the dollar limit of taxa
tion and run the municipal business on
an economical ba?is, and with assurances
of victory left for other meetings.
Mr. Gage's arrival had been practically
given up, but a roar from out in the
street, that was carried up the stairway
and Into the haJl itstlf, anounced that
the party's standard bearer had arrived.
Cheers burst from a thousand throats
as the Governor-to-be entered the hall j
and with a good deal of hard work made j
his way to the platform. Mr. Gage did
nnt deal with party issues or allude in
any way to his opponent. Ho had come,
he said, to make the acquaintance of his
audience and assure them that victory
was to roOÃt on the Republican standard
aftei the coming battle. He said that
there were eight other meetings that he
was obliged to attend, and that if his
audience would permit, he and his friends 1
would finish their rounds. He was glad
to have met them all and thanked thorn
feelingly for the royal greeting that they
had given him. He gave way to Judge !
Murphy and took his departure to the i
t=ame booming cheers that met him when
he came in.
Among those who followed Mr. Gage on
the roptrum were Ed I. Sheehan, A. P.
Black, Sig. Bettman, William Caldwell, !
George Collins, Thomas F. Graham, j
Judge Joacbimsen, I. J. Truman and Asa !
Wells, and all were well received.
A ROUSING
RECEPTION
FOR GAGE
The Republican nominees, both State
tnd municipal, met with a flattering re
ception at South San Francisco last night. I
Masonic Hall was crowded from floor to
gallery by the voters, their wives and
their children to greet the men who will
administer the laws of thp State and city
Tor the next term of official tenure. Ju
lius Kahn was the first to be presented, j
i He had hardily commenced his address j
when a commotion at the entrance an
nounced the arrival of the next Governor
Df the State. Henry T. Gage. Tho appear
ance of Mr. Gage on the floor brought the
house to its feet, and he was greeted with
a great cheer. On arriving on the plat
form Mr. Kahn.. gave way and Mr. Gage
was Introduced by the chairman. L. A.
Nonnemann.
The few words spoken by Mr. Gage were
well received. He apologised for the brev
ity of his remarks by saylngr that he had
nine more meetings to attend during the
evening.
Attorney General W. P. Fitzgerald,
nominee for City and County Attorney,
was the next speaker. He met with
equally as warm a reception as was ac
corded the nominee for Governor. In the
course of his remarks he paid a warm
tribute to C. S. Laumeister, nominee for
Railroad Commissioner. â¢ His election to
the office he sought was assured, and
when he reached there the people would
be fairly dealt with by the railroad com
pany. Hia record as Sheriff for four years
was such as to Justify the people in again
placing him in office. The Republican
platform and the nominees placed before
the people by that party was without ex
ception the best that was ever placed be
fore any constituency. He felt assured of
the election of the entire ticket. (Ap
plause,)
The meeting was addressed by Colonel
J. H. Roberts, W. J. Martin, W. J. Her
rin, Charles L. Patton, Henry S. Martin,
F. M. Galvin, A. de la Torre and others.
MEN OF THE
>^8 CLUB
CHEER GAGE
The closing rally of the '98 Republican
Club fur this campaign waa hold last
night in Cadets' Hall. 335 McAllister
street. George D. O'Neill acted as chair
man In the absence of the president.
Many candidates were represented by
proxies, men who spoke not only for them
but for the entire Republican ticket.
Archie Campbell, the rising young attor
ney, was the first speaker. He read a
letter signed by the representative men
of the legal profession, recommending the
candidacy of A. B. Treadwell for Police
Judge. Mr. Campbell also spoke for
Henry T. Gage for Governor and for
Charles L. Patton for Mayor.
Edgar Briggs championed the cause of
John D. Slebe, Republican nominee for
Assessor.
James E. Fields commended Charles L.
Patton especially to the voters. He spoke
of him as a capable, honest man from the
ground up. Every man on the Republi
can ticket, he said, was good and would
render good services to the people if
elected.
Clarence Gray acted as sponsor for J.
G. Edwards, candidate for State Board of
Equalization.
Alexander W. McPherson spoke strongly
for the Republican standard bearer and
all the men on the ticket.
Henry T. Gage arrived late, but this did
not dampen the ardor of the Republicans.
He remained with them a few minutes
and departed with cheers for hia success
and for the success of Charles L. Patton
j ringing in his ears.
GAGE HAS WON
THE MEN WHO
OPPOSED HIM
Henry T. Gage appeared in the Thirty
slxth Assembly District last night at Dv-
I veneck's Hall, corner o* Twenty-fourth
and Church Btreets. Although the dis
trict is down on the maps as a Demo
cratic one, this fact was not in evidence
when the standard bearer of Republican
principles entered the hall and ascended
the rostrum. He was greeted with ap
plause, and many ladies in the audience
arose and joined in the hearty reception.
When the crowd ceased ite cheering Mr.
: Gage spoke as follows:
"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemenâ
I This kindly reception I know is not ac
corded to me because of personal feeling,
but it is manifested because I am the
representative of great principlesâprinci
ples with which you are all familiar, and
which have necessitated this campaign
which we are Just closing.
"I did not come here to address you, i
but to report to you that I have visited '
fifty of the fifty-seven counties of this
State, and that on the Bth of November !
the Republican party will achieve the j
j greatest victory that It has ever known. :
i The reasons for this are numerous. The i
fusion party Is arrayed against property |
rights and against the rights of man. I
simply want to thank you for what you
have done for me and for what I know
i you will do for me next Tuesday."
The speaker concluded with a pledge
i that when elected he would conduct a
pure, business-like and economical ad
ministration, free from all railroad and
i corporation influence, and that he would
be guided by a desire to do right between
man and man, allotting to the poor and
humble that share of the wealth of
Republican liberty that is their due.

The Official Republican Club of the
Thirty-eighth Asseiribly District was

the occasion of a regular meeting at

streets, and the best speakers were there
to entertain an audience that packed the
hall.

WHITE DEFENDS VAN FLEET.
Declares the Able Associate Supreme Justice to
Have Been Unjustly Accused.
In the address delivered by Senator White at San Rafael last Satur
day, in commenting: upon the decision announced in the Fox case, he said
that while he advocated the election of the fusion' nominees for the Su
preme bench, he had known Judge Van Fleet for many years, and although
he. intended to continue to insist upon the success of those who depended
upon the fusion nomination, nevertheless he would not be a party to any
injustice as to any ndminee upon the Republican ticket, and that he had
heretofore shown. this disposition.
He added that he had defended Mr. Gage against aspersions unfound
ed that he expected Republicans to defend him if he were similarly un
justly assailed and that he would now say that he did not believe Judge
Van Fleet ever decided or intended to decide that the responsibilities of
any corporation were limited in any degree because of the poverty or
wealth of a defendant in a suit.
tratlon. The Judge then explained his
position In the Wallace Grand Jury case
to the satisfaction of all.
John D. Siebe was their Introduced and
he made one of his characteristic
speeches. Winning: loud applause. JÂ«st at
the conclusion of Siebe's speech Charles
L. Patton entered the hall and then the
audience turned loose. The people arose
In their seats and cheered for the next
Mayor. After quiet was restored Patton
took the platform and in a few brief
words told the audience what the princi
ples of the Republican platform are and
promised to serve the best interests of
the people if he were elected. He dis
claimed all connection with corporate
power and clearly explained his views on
the labor question. The conclusion of Pat
ton's speech won the candidate for the
Mayoralty another round of cheering and
good wishes.
Henry T. Gage followed Patton, and it
was some minutes after his entry before
he was permitted to begin speaking. The
gubernatorial candidate said but a few
words, but they were encouraging to the
Republicans gathered in the hall. He said
that he had canvassed the State and that
his only deduction from the atate of af
fairs was that the Republican ticket was
sure to win.
OVERFLOW
MEETING
FOR GAGE
The Republicans of the western portion
of the city turned out in such numbers
last night that the meeting In Langtry
Hall, 3206 California street, was an over
flow meeting, and long before Mr Gage ar
rived a larger hall had to be secured to
accommodate the crowd. Frank Powers
presided, and the first speaker of the
evening was Charles L. Patton, who, as
.he entered, was greeted as the next
Mayor of the city. He spoke briefly and
to the point. He said he was in favor of
the confirmation of the new city charter
because the majority of the people were
In favor of it. He pledged himself, if
elected, to stand by the party platform,
and stated that he was not bound by any
corporate influence or the railroad.
The arrival of Henry T. Gage at 10
o'clock was the signal for prolonged
cheering. The next Governor did not dis
cuss the issues of the campaign. He said
he had already done that in this city at
thirty meetings. He promised the people,
if elected, and he said that he would be,
to give them a fair and impartial adminis-
i tration. Mr. Gage denied that he was the
bonded servant of any corporation or
railroad, and he said that his administra
tion would be marked by fairness to every
man and that he would do what he con
ceived to be his honest duty.
HENRY GAGE
CHEERED TO
THE ECHO
The meeting last night of the Republi
can Argonaut Club In its hall at the cor
ner of Hyde and California streets was a
grand and glorious finale to the great
work that the club has done during this
campaign. Frank P. Kelly presided. The
m&etlzur was addressed by Charles L. Pat
ton, Julius Kahn and a number of the
other candidates. It was nearly 11 o'clock
before Henry T. Gage arrived. His en
trance into the hall was the event of the
evening. The crowd rose to its feet and
for fully five minutes cheered for the next
Governor of California. During this ap
plause Mr. Gage stood on the platform
bowing his acknowledgments to the
crowd, but they would not desist from ex
pressing their approval of the grtat stan
dard bearer of the Republican party, so
he was obliged to wait until the demon
stration had subsided. When quiet was
jÃnally restored Mr. Gage thanked the
crowd for its kind and hearty reception.
He- said that he was not present to dis
cuss the Issues of the campaign, as every
one was familiar with the platform on
which he stood. This provoked great
cheering. Mr. Gage then went on to say
that if he was elected he would give the
State a fair and impartial administration,
and' that he would see that justice was
done tcr the lowest and the greatest alike,
and that he would make no discrimina
tions. He prophesied that he would be
elected and denied that he had been or
would be controlled by any corporate in
fluence.
CANDIDATES
ARE GIVEN A
RECEPTION
The Republicans in the Thirtieth Assem
bly District held a reception in honor of
Henry T. Gage and other prominent can
didates on the Republican ticket last
evening in the Athletic Hall on the cor
ner of Sixth and Shipley streets. In the
addresses delivered they heard, probably
for the last time before election, the senti
ments of the standard bearers for whose
election they are to extend their suffrages
and universal support.
Owing to urgent engagements in other
sections of the city Mr. Gage was unable
to be present, but sent his regrets, thank-
Ing the Republicans In. the district for
their loyalty to his cause, and to their
party.
Charles I* Patton was the principal
speaker of the evening. Upon his fnltial
appearance in the hail he was tendered a
most cordiar and enthusiastic welcome.
The theme which he selected was the firm
and liberal basis upon which the Repub
lican party is built. He emphasized the
protection it affords the laboring man,
not only in this municipality, but through
out the entire State.
Among the various other speakers were
Julius Kahn and Louis A. Devoto.
These candidates, as did the majority
of those who spoke, followed in the same
general course of argument Introduced
by Patton and Kahn. The event was very
successful and enjoyable.
MANY VOTES
MAY BE LOST
BY REMOVALS
There seems to have been some misun
derstanding of late concerning the right
of voters to change their residence prior
to election without forfeiting their fran
chises. Registrar Biggy stated some time
ago through The Call and other papers
that a change of residence within thirty
days of election would disfranchise a
voter and he has constantly repeated this
statement to persons who have called at
the registration office in quest of informa
tion. Despite this effort to disseminate
the facts there seems to have been many
voters who failed to comprehend the Reg
istrar's meaning and frequent changes of
residences have taken place recently,
which would probably not have occurred
had the status of the case been under
stood.
As it now stands the Registrar believes
that about 4000 voters have technically
disfranchised themselves through changes
of residence. He states, however, that
these voters will, in most cases, probably
meet with little opposition at the polls, if
they swear in their votes. Others who are
perhaps as well versed in election laws as
Mr. Biggy state positively that no man
loses his vote by a removal, as the law
holds that the legal residence remains in
the old precinct until a voter registers in
a new one. The question is a vexatious
one and will perhaps give rise to entan
glements.
Yesterday the Registrar received sev
eral letters from citizens who had tempo
rarily changed their places of abode in the
city Inquiring if they were thereby dis
franchised. To these Mr. Biggy replied
that they would not lose their votes as a
temporary change did not imply a perma
nent change of residence, and that they
were entitled to vote in their home pre
cinct.
In order to make his position cleat In the
matter the Registrar has just had printed
a large number of cards to be displayed
at the election booths, on which the fol
lowing statements appear:
To Boards of Election: Every elector duly
qualified whosa name appears upon the pre
cinct register, and who has continued to reside
within the exterior boundaries of such elec
tion precinct to the day of election, la enti
tled to vote. Every elector whose name ap
pears upon the precinct register and who has
moved his residence outside the exterior bound
aries of the election precinct Is not entitled to
vote. The electors whose names appear upon
the precinct register as having removed, must
be carefully examined, and If found to still
reside within the election precinct, allowed to

Election Commissioners to determine any ques

PARDEE TO THE BOLTERS.
Oaland's Favorite Son Has a Word to
Say to Political Soreheads.
OAKLAND, Nov. 4.â Dr. George C. Par
dee is confident that the Republican State
and county ticket will carry Jn Alameda
County by a large majority. In his speech
in the Seventh Ward last night he in
dignantly repudiated the many slurs that
have been thrown -by fusionists at the
San Leandro convention. "I had some
thing to do with the nomination of that
ticket," said Dr. Pardee. "I was in the
convention and I know something of the
way the nominations were made, and I
want to say now that all the wild talk
indulged in about it, to put the matter
mildly, is an exaggeration. The wild talk
about a slate, about rings, about Dan
Burns, the railroad, or San ' Francisco pol-
iticians running the convention is, to
put It mildly again, untrue. Do you mean
to tell me that the Republicans of Ala
meda County were so absolutely lost to
decency and manhood that they w>re
ruled with a rod of iron by Dan Burns
or by a railroad and dare not get out
on primary day and vote? The man who
says that insults the intelligence of his
hearers, insults every one who is a man
in the county. Mr. Maguire has said that
Mr. Gage is" owned by the railroad. You
and I have heard Mr. Gage deny this in
such a way that unless he is one of the
greatest dissimulators on earth he is tell
ing the truth. Further than these consid
erations is the fact that Mr. Gage is the
nominee of the Republican party of Cali
fornia."
A SCURRILOUS CIRCULAR.
Opponents of William A. Deane Re
sort to an Anonymous and Ly
ing Appeal to Voters.
The Democratic roorback of Infamous
history has made its appearance in the
present campaign.
In doing so it has realized weeks of ex
pectancy and has proved that The Call's
warning to beware of it was well
grounded.
It makes its first bow to a supposedly
unsophisticated public in the shape of a
scurrilous and unsigned circular di
rected against William A, Deane, Re-
I>uUioan nominee for the office of
County Clerk. Its text is nothing
more specific than slanderous insin
uation. It is so utterly without foun
dation that its instigators have failed to
attach their names, and have been so
careful in hiding their crookedness and
veiling their allegations in intangible
terms that no clew to their identity is to
be found upon the face of their screed.
The name of John A. Brown, Mr.
Deane's opponent, appears frequently in
the article, which was evidently intended
to help his cause, but as Mr. Brown is
known not only to his party but to his
party's opponents as a gentleman and a
fair fighter it is assumed that the attack
upon Mr. Deane is without his knowledge
or authority.
Bears Are in the Fight.
The Bear Club held a meeting Thursday
night at its quarters in B'nai B'rith Hall
on Eddy street for the purpose of map
ping out a plan of district campaign.
President Collins urged every man to do
his utmost for the success of the entire
Republican ticket. In an eloquent speech
he predicted a sweeping victory for both
State and local tickets, but at the same
time said that it was not yet time to cease
fighting. The club formally accepted an
invitation to be present to-morrow even
ing at a meeting of the affiliated clubs at
Woodward's Pavilion, and with rousing
cheers and a promise to be on duty on
election day the meeting stood adjourned.
Bio's Joological Gardens.
Rio de Janeiro has some active agents
of publicity who themselves possess tht
gift of tongufes. Certain of thesÂ« gentle
men who feel an interest in the Zoologi
cal Gardens of Rio have lately decided to
advertise this attraction among the
strangers and pilgrims coming into the
harbor. They have, therefore, issued a
circular "to visitor* lying at anchor,"
i which is expressed tn Portuguese, Eng
| listr, French and German, and which de
serves to be quoted in part as a specimen
I of English as she is spoken by the un
i attached professor. The circular runs
I thus: "Joologlcal Gardensâ ln these gar

but one seems to feel what the Joological.

himself in a worse case. He is invited to
tho "Garten au Bar," and will hardly be
flattered to find that his beloved Bier
garten has been converted into bear

j MONABCHS AND MILLIONAIRES.
Both at home and abroad the lavish
way in which American millionaires scat
ter their wealth has beon gratefully ac
knowledged by tradesmen large and
small. This is a democratic country, but
our moneyed men have certainly ac
quired royalty's taste for expensive liv
ing. We have palaces in this country that
the kings and queens of the Old World
would consider fit abodes for the mighti
est monarch, and our men of vast means
lack nothing that royalty enjoys beyond
empty honor.
Nor does the wealth of those rulers of
nations surpass that of some of our rich
citizens. The Queen of England, says the
Philadelphia Times, though the ruler of
the biggest and richest empire the world
has ever seen, is by no means the richest
person on earth. In fact, her salary.
$1,925,000 a year, is one of the smallest
paid to any ruler on the globe. And of
the $1,925,000, all eyÂ«pt $480,000 is spent by
the Lord Chamberlair. the master of the
horse, and the Lord Treasurer, who are
responsible for the maintenance of the
royal household. And of the $450,000, $180,
000 is put by for a rainy day, so that
the exact amount received by her Majes
ty is only $300,000, as fixed by Parliament.
Compared with the big incomes of the
American millionaires, this is paltry in
deed. Hers, too, is the smallest salary
that any British sovereign has ever re
ceived. Most of the Queen's predecessors
on the throne had at least $4,000,000 a
year. By economy and frugality the

! Queen has been able to purchase 37,000
, acres of good land in Great Britain, yield
' ing a rent roll of about $125,000 a year,
i She also owns considerable property in
'â  Germany, a large quantity in New York
'and thousands of acres in Manitoba and
I "out West." But with all these savings,
she is poorer than many of our wealthy-
m c"areraont House, Osborne and Bal
' moral are the private properties of the
! Queen. The first named, standing in its
! estate of 460 acres, she bought for $370,000

i queathed to her by the Princess of Ho

The' royal family of England is not only
i the cheapest that the country haa ever
had, but it is also the most inexpensive
in the world. The entire expense of tbÂ«
whole British royal family amoums to
i only $525,000 a year, for against the total
1 expenditure of $2,000,000 must be set tne
I receipt of $2,075,000 from crown lands.
â  leaving the above net cost. Nearly all
i European sovereigns receive much nigno
salaries than the Queen. The Emperor
! of Russia has complete control over tnÂ«
revenue of his c>jun*.ry, but he only draws
â¢ $12,500,000 a war. The. Sultan takes i $V
000 000 the Emperor of Austria $4,&>0.009
! and the Kaiser Wilhelm $3,650,000. 'Ihe
i King of Italy receives $2,925.000â the same
; sum as the whole British familyâ and the
I King of the Belgians gets only $620,000 a
year.
The private property or sovereigns is
also very great. The Russian Imperial
family is the richest of ail royal houses,
and probably among commoners also.
Apart from 'his salary as ruler, which
amotmts to twelve and a half million dol
lars yearly, the Czar, as head of the
house of Romanoffs, owns 21,000,000 acrea
â  of land in different parts of Russia,
These yield more than $10,000,000; $2,500.
000 of this is paid in allowances to forty
six grand diikes and duchesses, and the
remainder is at the disposal of the Czar,
who thus enjoys the enormous income of
$17,500,000 a yearâ s2ooo per hour. The Czar
is also the owner of much valuable prop
" erty all over the world, and especially
in the United States. The daughter of
the Czar and Czarina, the infant Grand
Duchess Olga^ is the richest heiress in
the world. The week she was born
$5 000,000 was settled upon her. The sum
was invested in British, French and for
eign securities as a precaution against
the possibility of a revolution in Russia,
The Hapsburgs, the royal house of Aus
tria, are very little, if any, poorer than
the Romanoffs. They own immense land
ed estates, and have also inherited large
private fortunes. The income of the Aus
trian imperial family is not less than
$7,500,000. in addition to the grants from
the state.
The Hohenzollerns have a private in
come of nearly $5,000,000 per annum, par
tially derived from large investments in
New York. The Italian royal family has
a private income of $3,000,000 a year, also
derived- from American property. Thus
the British royal family is by far the
poorest of the great ruling housese.
The Sultan of Turkey as a despot is, of
course, fabulously rich. His annual ex
penses are said to amount to $30,000,000;
$7 500,000 of this goes for the cloth
ing of his harem, $400,000 for his own
wardrobe. $7,500,000 for presents. $5,000,000
for pocket money and another $5,000,000 for
his table. It seems Incredible that one
man can spend so much money in one
year, but when it is remembered that
pome 1500 people live within the palace
wallsâ live luxuriously and dress expen
sivelyâat the cost of the civil list, it ap
pears more comprehensible.

John P. Irish, a Democrat of the old
school, in the name of the memory of the
once honored policy of his party and In
the name of justice, tcok the platform
at Metropolitan Temple last night and in
eloquent words denounced the methods
now pursued by the fusion candidate for
"Governor, showed where those things
Maguire considers issues are false issues
and brought to light true issues that have
been obscured behind the veil of the false.
A storm of applause greeted the orator
when he ascended the platform. He was
, introduced and without delay began. "It
is my belief that at this time a state
ment should be made regarding 1 the false
issues that have been raised during this
campaign, and a statement as well on the
true issues that have been hidden. The
battle cry has been sounding now more
than two months, and to me it seems that
campaigners have been appealing to the
prejudices and passions of the people and
have sadly neglected principles.
"The fusion candidate for Governor, of
whom I speak with the greatest respect,
has considered it his duty to confine
himself to one matter, and that matter
which he considers an issue I consider a
false issue and therefore no issue. Be
hind that matter, however, he has veiled
a true issue â one of which I wish to
speak. The matter most referred to by
Mr. Maguire, the fusion candidate, is
what is called the funding bill. This in
form appears as an amendment of the
general deficiency bill. This amendment
the funding bill, was prepared by Senator
Stephen M. White of California in con
sultation with the fusion candidate and
other representatives of California. When
completed this bill extended the time of
payment of the railroad debt to this Gov- i
eminent ten years, and it was provided
that the debt should be paid in semi
yearly installments. Maguire denounces
that amendment as a measure through
which he can play to the prejudices of
the voting people. The bill was carried
by the entire vote of the Senate, and now '
the fusion candidate comes before us as I
the gallant young man 'Tim,' who joined
the army and whose proud mother in
formed her friends that every one in the
regiment was out of step except Tim.
Every member of the Senate was out of
step and Maguire in the other house led
with the proper foot to the beat of the
drum.
"This fusion candidate has traveled up
and down this State playing on the same
string. He has made no mention of our
public institutions or has builded no fight
on broad or lofty principles. He is a fu
sion candidate. The people have always
repudiated fusion candidates, as fusion
breeds distrust. They have also an aver
sion to office-seekers, especially those
â who. when presented with three plat
forms, bowed low and accepted all. al
though different, as exactly voicing their
sentiments and views.
"The true issue of this campaign is j
Bound money. The people of this nation
with prospects of increasing commerce
need a sound financial basis more than '
ever."
The sneaker then gave a logical synop
sis of the money question, referred to the
scandals that have visited our public in
stitutions during the present administra
tion, grilled Maguire on his single tax in
clinations, and concluded with an eloquent
appeal to the people to support law ajid
. order and the constitution of the United
States, which provides for equal rights
"for all men and all bodies of men asso
ciated in corporations as long as they do
not transgress on the law of the land.

The foregoing is an extract from a

modest candidate act in this campaign,
and has usually avoided making explicit
statements as to the particular things
he has accomplished for laboring men, for
reasons not necessary to explain. How
ever, in the speech referred to his desire
to "boost" himself in the estimation of
the voters of the city led him to make a
misstatement of fact, and the result is
that he is "hoist by his own petard."
The Mayor became enthusiastic in
praising himself and in the course of his
address injudiciously took up the popu
lar subject of the new paving: of Market
street. He and his advocates have taken
great pains to impress upon the public
that he was responsible for that pioce of
enterprise, but have done so in an
evasive way. The dodging, deceptive
method of dealing witn the people adopt
ed by Mr. Phelan is Illustrated in the
speech in question. Mr. Phelan, through
the columns of his organ, said:
Some of the newspapers of the city
are attempting to mislead you and
are making attacks upon us for what
we have done. . . In a morning pa
per of the Republican persuasion there
appears a belittling attack upon our
street work, the work that we have
done on Market street, which has con
verted that street into a beautiful
thoroughfare, which attracts our vis
itors and keeps our people here.
Mr. Phelan then proceeded to throw
more bouquets at himself about what he
ha 6 accomplished In the repaying of the
city's greatest thoroughfare, but the of
ficial records show that the Mayor de
liberately avoided the responsibility of
signing the order for this Important re
paying work, and that he did not attach
his signature to It. The resolution be
came a law by default, and the fact was
attested by the clerk of the Board of Su
pervisors in the official publication on
April 25. The accompanying extract from
the resolutions shows how brazenly Mr.
Phelan has deceived the public in this
matter, and how deeply he was interested
in the repaying of Market street.

Lieutenant Governor Jeter called the
assemblage to order by pounding on an
anvil. He attempted to say a few words
by way of starting the old, old railroad
hobby-horse a-rocking, but the only ones
who heard him were the other orators.
The band played "Dixie,"" a young lady
sang "The Star Spangled Banner," and
then W. H. Alford, after Informing the
audience that the special train bearing
James G. Maguire from the north was
four hours late, delivered his stereotyped
campaign speech. He was followeu by
William Craig and J. J. Dwyer, whose
speeches were delivered in installments,
owing to repeated Interruptions by a band
In the rear of the pavilion.
Senator White received a hearty recep
tion and, like Dwyer, was unable to com
plete his address, because of the entrance
of Mayor Phelan. The Mayor received
the greatest demonstration of the even
ing. He spoke for fifteen or twenty min
utes on municipal issues, dilating upon
the urgent necessity of electing a Demo
cratic Legislature to ratify the new char
ter. James H. Barry followed the Mayoi'
and delivered his customary tirade upon
C P. Huntington and the Southern Pa
cific, and assailing Justices Van Fleet
and McFarland in his usual intemperate
manner. He advised railroad employe*
to make hypocrites of themselves b>
wearing Republican buttons and then on
election day vote the Democratic ticket.
W. H. Hinton and J. P. Dunn were in
troduced, and then Governor Budd spoke
for a few minutes. Several others also
spoke.
Judge Maguire reached the Pavilion at
11:40, and made a short speech, after
which the meeting adjourned.
This Week's
News Letter is full of spicy campaign
matter. Patton, Phelan, Gape and Ma
guire all receive attention; and the
local candidates are portrayed in their
true colow. Corrupt men are scored,
and the highest duty of citizens is
pointed out in a clear and convincing
manner. Ten cents of all news dealers.
Liverpool has started the idea of giv
ing concerts in the courtyards of the
worst quarters of the city.

GOTTLOB AND MARX
MUST STAND ALONE
pi H. FRIEDLANDER, the well known theatrical manager, yesterday sev-
V ered his connection with the management of the Baldwin, Columbia and
O i California theaters. Frledlander's Interest In these theaters was bought
up by his former partners. Jacob Gottlob and Melville Marx. Joseph Gottlob,
brother of Jacob, has secured a small Interest In the company, which will
hereafter be known as Gottlob. Marx & Co.
The withdrawal of Mr. Friedlander from the theatrical firm which he was
instrumental In establishing is purely
a financial proposition. Mr. Fried
lander was anxious to be relieved of
the severe strain of management.
His partners made him an excellent
offer and he closed the deal. So
cially the relations of the theatri
cal men continue most amicable.
Mr. Friedlander has not decided
yet to what branch of theatrical life he
will in the future give his attention,
though it is probable he will remain
In this city and make a specialty of
the management of great concerts
and noted lecturers.
Mr. Frieaiander's record In this
town has been an enviable one. His
first theatrical venture in this city
was at the California Theater under
the management of Al Hayman.
When he severed his connection with
Hayman, Friedlander. in conjunction
with Jacob Gottlob. leased the Co
lumbia Theater, which, by his busi
ness enterprise and artistic apprecia
tion, has become one of the most suc
cessful houses in the country. The
next big move of the manager was
the purchasing of the Hayman inter
-sts in this city and the re-establish-
During his recent Eastern tour Friedlander consummated the syndicate
deal, thereby securing all the big attractions for the theaters which he repre
sented. Mr. Friedlander has identified himself closely with the social life of
the city, and is a member of all the representative clubs. He has been a true
friend to those in distress, and has always been ready to lend his assistance
and place his theaters at the disposal of charitable associations.
STILL EVADING TAXES.
The Wells-Fargo Company Carries
Its Trouble to the Federal
Courts.
That the Wells-Fargo Company doe? not
Intend to pay its share Â»of the revenue
tax until forced to do so has been evi
denced again by its latest move. A short
time ago it was sued for having refused
to accept for transmission a package
upon which the man proffering it had de
clined to place the revenue stamp. His
excuse for declining was that the law
delegated this duty to the corporation.
However, the corporation was obdurate,
was sued in the Justice Court, defeated
there, took its case to the Superior Court
and was once more defeated. Knowing
that a similar fate must await it in any
similar suit before the same tribunal It
seeks anotner.
There are two actions pending against
the company now on the ground the ini
tial one rested upon so securely. The
company would not abide by the revenue
law. The actions were brought in the
Superior Court, each demanding damages
in the sum of $50. The corporation coun
sel has raised the point that the tribunal
properly having jurisdiction is the United
States Circuit Court, and thither the
suits have been sent, Justice of the Peace
Cook signing the necessary order. The
Wells-Fargo Company being organized
under the laws of Colorado, contention is
set up that the action is really brought by
residents of one State against residents of
another State.

Becker-Creegan Trial.
The Becker-Creegan case â will be con
cluded on the 10th inst. The prosecution
closed its case Thursday evening, and
yesterday the defense occupied the day
reading from the transcript of testimony
of the former trial, the object being to
impeach the testimony of certain wit
nesses given during the trial now in
progress. At the conclusion of the day's
session the defense announced that the
case was closed and Judge Wallace set
the 10th as the date for argument. Each
side will be limited to two hours for the
presentation of its case and it will then
be submitted to the jury.

Talk this week will doubtless be probabili

Robertson and Mary Frances Francis dis
courses upon matters musical. The Saun

MARCHING OF ENGLISH SOLDIERS.
(Reprinted from the "London Sketch.")
General Sir Evelyn Wood says : "Re-
garding the infantry marching, it was
the best seen during my command at
Aldershot, or since I was first stationed
there 28 years ago. Many officers
availed themselves of the tonic and re-
constituent properties of the well-known
Mariani Wine, the most cer-
tain as well as the most palatable method
of inducing resistance to fatigue." . |

THE FINfIL ROLLY.
TO-NIGHT at Woodward's Pavilion will occur
the moat remarkable meeting of the campaign.
It will be the final grand rally of the Republican
forces, a time of jubilation that the hard work of the
canvass is over and victory in sight. The candidates
for Governor and Mayor will be present, as well as
the prominent orators who have been making
speeches throughout the State. Doubtless the ca
pacity of the place will be taxed to the utmost. The
committee having the affair in charge have been fairly
embarrassed by the enthusiasm. At first it was con
templated to have the uniformed clubs attend, but
there are many others who wish to be in line. The
clubs will assemble at Market and Montgomery,
thence marching in three divisions to the pavilion,
each division preceded by a drill corps. There will
be all along the way, as well as at the pavilion, plenty
of music and an abundance of fireworks. In fact, to
night will be notable as a scene of joyous celebration,
and will show how confident are the Republicans in
a sweeping victory Tuesday.
fl CONSTITUTIONAL "BUG."
THE attention of voters should be called to a
paragraph upon the official State ballot by
which the ambitious legislative jobbers evi
dently aspire to secure the adoption of constitutional
amendment No. 7. This amendment provides for
increasing the pay of legislators and splitting biennial
sessions into two parts â a device which would enable
the lobby to do much of its fine work away from the
Capitol at Sacramento.
On the official State ballot opposite the words
"Yes" and "No," by which voters may express their
approval or disapproval of the amendment, appears
the following description of its purport: "Amend
ment No. 7, being Assembly constitutional amend
ment No. 34 (providing for adjournment of Legisla
ture for not less than thirty nor more than sixty days
during each session.").
Nothing is said about increasing the pay of mem
bers, yet that is the main purpose of the amendment,
there being no doubt that the recess proposed was
invented merely to carry along a proposition to
lengthen the legislative sessions and make them more
expensive. For the purpose of thoroughly uncover
ing the "bug" which is here disclosed we append
constitutional amendment No. 7in full. It proposes
to change section 2 of article IV of the constitution
to read as follows:
Section i. The sessions of the Legislature shall j
commence at 12 o'clock meridian on the first Mon
day after the f rst day of January next succeeding
the election of its members, and shall be biennial
unless th â¢Â» Governor shall in the interim convene the
Legislature by proclamation. The Legislature shall j
then remain in session for twenty-five days, after i
which it must adjourn to some date not less than i
thirty nor mora than sixty days from the time of |
adjournment. If the two houses fail to agree upon
a time at which they will resume their session, the
Governor shall, by proclamation, fix a date for such
reconvening, which shall be within the limits above
prescribed. Upon reassembling, the Legislature
shall complete its session. No pay shall be allowed
to members for a longer period than seventy-five
days, anl no bill shall be introduced in either house
except at the first twenty-five days of the session,
without the consent of three-fourths of the mem
bers thereof.
The duration of legislative sessions at present is
eixty paydays. Ordinarily the members sit ten days
without pay, making the session practically seventy
days in length. Constitutional amendment No. 7allows
pay for seventy-five days, or makes the session eighty
days long and grants a vacation between times to
enable the lobby to perfect its jobs. The effect
would be to increase mileage and expenses to the
extent of $25,000 or $30,000 per session without any
corresponding return to the taxpayers. That there
is a "pull" behind this amendment is manifest from
the fact that its real purport has been kept off the
official ballot, evidently in the hope that voters will
be fooled into supporting it as an innocent change in
the law.
Every taxpayer should vote against it. It is a tax
eating device and nothing else. No good can be ac
complished by increasing the duration of legislative
sessions; if they are increased the money they cost
will be thrown away.
One evidence that railway employes are not being
bulldozed to vote for any particular set of candidates
is that the Examiner says they are. Aside from this
is the fact that there is no possibility of forcing a
man to vote any other way than the one pleasing to
his own judgment. He stands in the booth with his
ballot and his conscience, and to interfere with him
is impossible.
One of Spain's Commissioners is said to be ill, but
the marble heart of Uncle Sam is really enough to
make the whole lot of them sick.
THE GOVERNOR'S INFLUENCE.
IF such a misfortune were to befall California as
Maguire's election, let no one be deceived as to
the influence he will have upon legislation, or his
power to advance his declared policy to "do away
with all vested rights and titles and ownership in
land."
The Democratic platform on which he is running
has this plank: "We favor a constitutional amend
ment abolishing the State poll tax, and giving to
counties and municipal corporations the right to
adopt and change their systems of taxation for local
purposes whenever a majority of the people of any
such county or municipality shall so determine."
The Populist fusion platform on which Maguire is
also running has this plank: "We favor the repeal
of all poll taxes and demand the exemption of all
personal property from taxation. We also favor the
submission to the people of a constitutional amend
ment which will give to counties and municipal cor
porations the right to adopt such a system of taxation
for local purposes as the people of such locality de
sire."
These planks are in accordance with the action of
the single tax junta which urged such an amendment
to the constitution upon the last Legislature. If it be
proposed in the Legislature of next winter does any
one doubt that Maguire as Governor would aid it by
all the means in his power? If he succeed in getting
it before the people, it will not have to receive the
votes of a majority of all the people to adopt it. Only
a majority of those voting upon it will be necessary,
and they may be a minority of the total number of
voters in the State.
The single tax land confiscators, as shown during
the present campaign, are in a compact organization.
They support Maguire to a man. Constitutional
amendments are voted on at a general election. The
next general election will be in iooo. It will be a
Presidential campaign. Public attention will be cen
tered upon the head of the ticket, and the great gen
eral and national issues involved. The majority of
the people will be indifferent to constitutional
amendments. But not so the single tax confiscators.
Such a condition offers them just the opportunity
they desire. Not one of them will forget the con
fiscating amendment. Not one of them will neglect
the opportunity offered to destroy "all vested rights,
titles and ownership of land," and, though in a mi
nority, they may easily carry the amendment.
Now, as to Maguire's influence if he were Gov-
I ernor when such amendment is before the Legisla
ture. Every one who knows the position of the Gov
ernor in our system knows that unless there is a
two-thirds majority to override his veto, he is the
Legislature. Members have pet measures for the
benefit of their constituencies, the fate of which in
volves their fate in politics and public life. Does
any one pretend that they will stand up against a
threatened veto of such measures balanced against
their position upon the single tax amendment called
for in Maguire's platform? They may be opposed
to land confiscation, but how easy it is for them to
think and say that as the question goes to the people
who vote on the amendment they can wash their
hands of responsibility by- transferring it to the
ballot-box, thereby saving their pet measures from
death at the hands of the Governor by his veto.
When The Call asked Maguire if he would make
this or any use of his influence in favor of the single
tax he refused to answer yes or no to the question.
We have continually warned the land-owners and the
depositors in savings banks, who have an equity in
land titles and land-ownership by the mortgages on
; land which secure their money loaned by the banks,
that Maguire's election will promote the destruction
of all vested rights, titles and ownership in land. It
will destroy the title and with it the savings bank
mortgage which depends upon that title. As all
men know, when a savings bank, acting as trustee
for its depositors, loans money on a land mortgage
it demands the exhibition of a good title to the land
vested in the borrower. This is his vested right,
which Maguire proposes to destroy. When it is de
stroyed the mortgage which depended upon it is de
stroyed also; the bank has no title on which to fore
close. The owner has lost his land by Magmire's plan
of confiscation, and if pursued by the bank to judg
ment on the debt has nothing left from which to re
spond on a deficiency judgment.
Ky the last report of the Bank Commissioners for
) there were in this State 159,856 depositors in
ngs banks. They were the owners of $131,653,
634 deposited in such banks. Of this vast sum over
one hundred millions are loaned on real estate. The
value of land in the State, as assessed for taxation in
1896, is $761,348,980. Add to this the land mortgages
of savings banks, and there is the grand total of
$861,348,980 of property in this State dependent
solely on the vested rights, titles and ownership in
land!
Therefore, when Judge Maguire says, "We pro
pose to destroy all vested rights, titles and owner
ship to land," he proposes to destroy at one stroke
nearly one billion of dollars' worth of property in
California! If any man think the State can stand
that he should vote for Maguire. If he think, how
ever, that it would be a blow destructive of the
State, as it will be, let him oppose Maguire with all
his might.
THE TWO FITZGERALDS.
SOME danger exists that owing to the similarity
of names the public may confuse- William F.
Fitzgerald, Republican nominee for City and
County Attorney, with E. L. Fitzgerald, Democratic
nominee for Public Administrator.
E. L. Fitzgerald, candidate for Public Adminis
trator, is the carpet-bagger from Oakland whose
crooked record has been exposed in The Call, and
for whom no man should vote.
William F. Fitzgerald, the candidate for City and
County Attorney, is one of the leading lawyers of the
city, and a man of the highest repute â one for whom
everybody should vote.
Fix the names clearly in your mind and make no
mistake on election day.
WHY EDWARDS SHOULD WIN,
IN nominating J. G. Edwards for the Board of
Equalization in the First District the Republicans
did wisely. They chose 'a man who has lived for
thirty years in this city, whose reputation, by no
means local, is without blemish, and who by energy
and force of character has risen to the proprietorship
of the best Underwriters' Journal published in this
country. Such strength as there is in a rugged per
sonality, spotless integrity and a long record of hon
orable achievement, Mr. Edwards had, and bringing
it into the campaign he lent dignity and force not
only to his own canvass, but to the entire ticket.
It is not alone in private life that Mr. Edwards has
been successful. He was a soldier, and bears the scars
of wounds received as he fought in the history
making battles of the Civil War. He possesses still
the military quality to the extent of being almost se
verely conscientious in his dealings with men. He
THE SAN ; FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1898>
is not given to compromise, and no personal interest
can swerve him from a course which he conceives to
be right. As a member of the board Mr. Edwards
would be a resolute and fearless champion of the in
terests he would represent.
A membership on this board is a significant posi
tion. It is not one to be lightly bestowed. This can
didate is eminently fitted for it. Beyond a loyalty to
his party which never falters, he is in no sense a
politician, but he has won a host of both personal
and political friends. They know that in public office
as in private life he will be devoted to duty.
It is not always that a candidate, strong in himself,
has the privilege of drawing strength from the weak
ness of his opponent, but this advantage falls to Mr.
Edwards. The opponent is John P. Dunn, a person
projected from the sandlots into unenviable notoriety,
and since then thirsting, hungering and scheming for
office. The unpopularity of Dunn will add to the Ed
wards majority, but even against a itiuch more for
midable rival the election of the Republican candidate
would be assured by a safe and. emphatic lead.
S~* ALIFORNIA is now well assured of a Repub
( lican Governor and a Republican State adminis-
generally. She should be also assured of a
Legislature strongly Republican in both branches. In
view of the important local issues to be dealt with by
the Legislature and of the fact that a United States
Senator is to be chosen this winter, there can be no
question but the people should give as earnest a sup
port to the Republican legislative candidates as to
any others on the ticket.
A Legislature controlled by the Maguireites could
seriously disturb the affairs of the State, even if Ma
guire himself be defeated. At this juncture of our
affairs we cannot afford to have a set of radical ex
perimenters tinkering with the legislation of the
State. A single tax bill or other measure of the
kind passed by the Legislature would, even if vetoed,
discredit the commonwealth. Throughout the East
it would be regarded as an evidence that the dis
satisfied elements of the State are sufficiently strong
to be dangerous and menacing to all the interests of
capital and industry.
We have seen what befell Kansas, Oregon and
Colorado when the Democratic and Populist fusion
came into power there. California, though financially
and industrially stronger than any of these States,
would, nevertheless, suffer to an almost equal ex
tent from a similar course of fanatic legislation. The
only safeguard for prosperity is to elect a conserva
tive Legislature as well as a conservative Governor
and State administration.
Moreover, the people should elect a Legislature
that will return to the United States Senate a stanch
supporter of the national administration. California
at this juncture must stand by the President. There
are great problems of home and foreign politics to be
dealt with in the next two years, and for their satis
factory settlement a Senate in harmony with the
House of Representatives and with the President is
essential. The empire State of the Pacific Coast
must on this issue line up with the foremost of her
sister States, and be represented at Washington by
Senators who will assist in carrying out policies for
the general good.
Fortunately, the Republican nominees for the Leg
islature are personally strong. Their fitness for the
office, their devotion to genuine Republicanism, are
not to be doubted. They are men who can justly
claim the votes of independents and conservative
Democrats as well as of members of their own party.
None of them are advocates of any such political
folly as the single tax. none would favor legislation
designed to drive capital from the State, impose
heavier burdens upon the farmers and harass industry
in response to the clamor of the thriftless and the
discontented.
The issues of the campaign have been made up.
The canvass is near its close. All that remains to
be done to assure a government of prosperity is for
good citizens to rouse one another to the importance
of voting on election day, and voting the whole
ticket.
THERE is a natural feeling that the Supreme
Court, the most august tribunal of the State,
ought not to be subject to the frequent changes
prevailing in offices and departments which may re
quire a knowledge less profound and where an expe
rience less ripe may be trusted.
This year the Republicans offer two candidates,
both already on the Supreme bench, both on record
as wise and upright jurists. In point of learning and
ability they may safely be said to hold an advantage
over their opponents, while years of training as Jus
tices of the Supreme Court have added to their capa
bilities. No 'prentice hands are desired where great
questions involving human rights and even human
life are to be adjudicated. Let us have those who
have been tried.
Mayor Phelan has made a direct appeal for the de
feat of Justices McFarland and Van Fleet They ac
quired his ill-will by upholding a law he had sought
to violate. So would they uphold any law on the
statute books, without fear or favor. This is why
there is public confidence in them, and why the peo
ple will decline to make a change.
NO more systematic canvass has been made than
that of Henry S. Martin, Republican candidate
for Sheriff. Even with a man less popular than
Mr. Martin a canvass marked by such untiring zeal
could not well lead to defeat. The gentleman prob
ably has as many personal friends as any resident of
this city, the place of his birth. Here his interests are
centered. Here he has worked and prospered. He
is a man of business standing, clean record and ac
knowledged ability. Nobody doubts that under his
care the affairs of the Sheriff's office will be admin
istered with the utmost honesty. There will be no
favoritism, no laxness. The intrinsic worth of the
man, his wide acquaintance, the general confidence in
him, and his own boundless energy, constitute a com
bination which assures the certainty of his election.
YESTERDAY occasion arose for quoting the
Examiner against Rhodes Borden, whom it
now supports for the Superior bench. This was
not done in any sense as an attack on the Judge, who
is a worthy man and an able jurist. The sole purpose
was to show the inconsistency of the Examiner, the
hollowness of its pretensions of friendship, the mock
ery of its aspect of sincerity. Judge Borden has made
a good record. It is his misfortune to be on the
wrong side and to be opposed by men equally able
and fair. Personally, The Call finds no fault with
him, and used a weapon taken from his friend, the
Examiner, so as to make clear the sort of friendship
the Examiner displays. Judge Borden is handi
capped by his journalistic support

WORKING THE VETO.
NUMBER FOURTEEN.
Editor Call: As the day draws nearer when the plain citizen â that is,
you and II â must deposit our votes in the ballot-box, it becomes more and
more necessary to think coolly and consider well. In the heat of battle some
men lose their heads and some become clear-eyed and steady. The plain citizen
cannot afford to lose his head. He is the person most concerned in the
election. You and I must pay the cost. You and I must not be carried away
with the enthusiasm of great meetings, with the rush of the orator's voice,
with the glare of the red fire. When the meeting is over and the orator is
fulfilling other engagements and the red fire is red ashes, the cost of it all
comes on the plain citizen. Therefore you and I must think seriously and
calmly on the issues that this election decides.
THE CONTEST FOR THE MAYORALTY
Is not a mere contest between persons; it is a contest between ideas. Mr.
Phelan stands for a system of government that this republic repudiates. He
stands for an autocratic power, for the centering of all the offices in himself.
He appeals to the people to make him King of San Francisco, and in order
to make him King we must put all his creatures in office.
The question, therefore, before the plain citizen â that is, before you and
me â is this: Is Mr. Phelan such a man that we can trust him with the dic
tatorship? Shall we preserve the restraints that the forefathers embodied
in the law to prevent the republic from receiving harm or shall we consti
tute Mr. James D. Phelan our guardian to do our thinking and our govern
ing for us?
THE PLAIN CITIZEN STUDIES
Mr. Phelan's record, and he finds that Mr. Phelan's most boasted actions
are such that they arouse at least the suspicion that he is acting not in the
interest of the city, but in the interest of Mr. Phelan. We find that he has
been using his office to increase and to consolidate his political power, and
we see that his cry for good government and the protection of the people
is, when interpreted, a cry for the glorification of his Honor the Mayor.
Perhaps in no matter is this more evident than in his vetoes. Every one
knows that the amount of street work done in San Francsico is enormous.
Contracts are being let continually. The most of this work is done at the ex
pense of the plain citizen, and in places not traversed by the general mass of
the community.
Every one knows, also, that the greater part of this work is entirely
unnecessary. It is passed in nine cases out of ten over the protest of a ma
jority of the property-holders. The general public has not much interest in
these jobs. A sidewalk on Z street, or a granite curb on Three Hundred and
Sixty-fifth street, or a bitumen plaster on Bernal Heights, does not stir the
popular magnetism. It is the Mayor's duty to veto these jobs if he thinks
they are improperly or unnecessarily proposed. But Mr. Phelan does not
waste his time on such trivial affairs. Unless he can plant his veto in the
middle of Market street as a barricade against wicked Supervisors and from
the top of it harangue the multitude on his own virtues, Mr. Phelan has
little use for a veto.
AGAIN AND AGAIN PROPERTY-OWNERS
Have gone to him with their woes, but Mr. Phelan did not believe in work
ing the veto power too hard. They have shown him by facts and figures
that the work was unnecessary and unjust, but that did not disturb Mr.
Phelan's luxurious repose. There was nothing in it for him. It would not
help to gain him more votes or to stir the people to enthusiasm for him as
the exponent of good government. Therefore the poor property-ownersâ all
of them plain people like you and me â were compelled to pay for im
provements which when done to the Market street property of rich men are
paid by the city.
THE GAS VETO
Is also another sample of Mr. Phelan's care for the interest of the plain citi
zen. Mr. Phelan, it is said, is interested in the competing company. That
company, being thrifty, is not anxious to spend money without seeing some
quick returns in sight. It will not erect poles and lay pipes until it has some
use for them. If plain people like you and me go into business we are com
pelled to purchase our stock and take chances. Customers may come or
not, as fortune favors us. Suppose we should say that we would not spend
a cent in stock until we had secured from the city the contract for supplying
the particular commodity in which we dealt. This might be good business,
but it would not be particularly patriotic. Mr. Phelan does not wish that the
company in which he is said to be interested should spend money on an ex
tended plant until the city would agree to buy its light. This is sharp busi
ness, but Mr. Phelan cannot very well claim that the veto by which he tried
to eniorce it is an evidence of his desire for good government.
DR. WASHINGTON DODGE'S VOTE.
The Candidate for Assessor Explains It in a Letter to Father
Editor Call: It would be a great favor to me If you would publish this
letter and the Inclosed. A few days ago I called on the nominees who had
voted for the Sailors' Home to purge themselves before the people. Only
one has accepted the invitation, and that is Dr. Washington Dodge. He
has written the following note to me:
Reverend P. C. Yorkeâ Dear Sir: In your recent lecture in Oakland and in
one of your letters published in the press you have criticised my vote as Super
visor on the lease or the Sailors' Home and on the election of Christian Reis as
Treasurer to succeed Widber. I must protest against any interpretation of my
vote that would convey to the public the impression that in the discharge of my
official duties I had at any time acted with unfairness or failed to be governed by
liberal principles.
In the matter of the Sailors' Home lease, I was Informed by a member of the
board, whom I knew to be a Catholic, that the settlement was acceptable to all
parties.
As to my vote for Treasurer, I did not know Mr. Reis personally, but I did
know that he had been Treasurer of the city some years before and had been a
faithful officer.
In this connection let me say that I am opposed to any form of religious intol
erance. I would not accept a nomination from any organization representing the
spirit of proscription. When I was a candidate for Supervisor two years ago, I
refused the nomination of the American Protective Association and one of my
opponents received that indorsement. Respectfully yours,
WASHINGTON DODGE.
San Francisco, November 4, 1898.
Concerning this statement I deem it my duty to say that Dr. Dodge's
explanation of his action in the two incidents is quite credible. Though
the Monitor had spoken on the question again and again, and was dealing
with it during this very period, it is quite credible that Dr. Dodge, a non-
Cathc-lic, had never seen the Monitor or even thought of it. When a mem
ber of the board known to be a Catholic informed Dr. Dodge that the ar
rangement .was satisfactory from a Catholic standpoint, who can blame Dr.
Dodge for believing h'm?
The same remarks apply to the Reis matter.
Ncrw in my dealings with this case all I have ever asked of the persons
concerned was an explanation that would hold water â an explanation that
In any ordinary business matter would satisfy any ordinary business man.
As the votes were public matters I deemed it right to stand by the prin
ciple that the explanation should be public also. I want to be just. It mat
ters nothing to me who wins or loses, but I do not wish that any candidate
shall have reasonable cause to accuse me of being unfair.
Therefore I ask you as a special favor to me to publish this letter and
the inclosed. Nothing could give me greater pleasure than this. It is not
with joy, I assure you, that I have been compelled to speak of these men.
I have spoken because it would have been a crime to have remained silent.
I have spoken simply for the sake of the people who have fought for prin
ciple and fair play. If they do not assert their rights then they shall be the
sport and the mockery of every picayune politician who takes their votes
and then betrays them. PETER C. YORKE."

CELESTIAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
The telescope not only reveals more
than can be seen by the eye alone, but the
sensitive film surpasses the power of the
eye when aided by the telescope, for the
camera records on the film objects which
the eye cannot see through the greatest
magnifying lenses. No matter how far
away or how dimiy it shines, the light of
the faintest star in time impresses the
Him, and thus that which is invisible to
the eye becomes visible on the plate.
In celestial photography the camera is
kept moving during the taking of a pic
ture. The exposure sometimes lasts sev
eral hours, and if the camera were sta
tionary the motion of the earth would
soon carry the subject out of line with the
telescope. The camera, therefore, is at
tached to the tube of the telescope, and
the object to be photographed is brought
into the lens at the Intersection of two
cross-wires. Then, by a system of clock
work, the telescope moves so that the
subject occupies the same position on the
plate during the exposure. In the pic
ture of the Swift comet may be seen small
white lines. These are the marks or trails
of the stars. The telescope was adjusted
to the speed of tne comet, and as it trav
eled much faster than the stars, the pho
tographs of the stars appear as streaks
instead of as points of light.
It is another curious feature of celestial
photography that a plate may be exposed
several nights on the same subject. I
have seen star-cluster and nebulae pic
tures which were exposed, the former on
two and the latter on four successive
evenings. The picture showing the nebu
lae required a total exposure of thirteen
hours and forty-four minutes.â From St.

Startling Story of a
Chinaman.
FOURTEEN MONGOLIANS LOST
SAYS HE IS POSITIVE AT LEAST
THAT MANY PEBISHED.
Caught in the Steerage When the
Crash Came and Were Unable
to Make Their
Escape.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Nov. 4.â A Chinaman
who lives in lone, and was a passenger
on the steamer J. D. Peters Wednes
day evening, made a statement here
that he believed fourteen Chinese were
drowned while in a stupor from opium.
He says a number of Chinese were in
the steerage of the vessel when she
struck the Czarina, lying in bunks and
emoking opium or tobacco. He was
â with the crowd and was one of several
â¢who escaped with considerable diffi
culty. He says the water rushed in on
the men as soon as the crash came, and
they could not get out of their bunks.
Three of the drowned men are Rob-
erts Island farmers. Others are lone
â¢ Chinamen and some are residents of
local Chinatown.
Altogether fourteen are said to be
Burely drowned. The Chinese runner
â¢who came up on the old line boat this
morning said the runner on the Peters
â was drowned.
The Navigation Company's steamer
that arrived this morning brought up
a miscellaneous lot of stuff recovered
from the Peters, including bedding,
carpets and the piano that was in the
cabin. Claims for baggage are being
;-.red and claims for losses are
talked of.

GANS GETS DECISION
OVER M'PARTLAND
Men Put Up a Beautiful Fight, Both.
Landing Freely and
Fiercely.
NEW YORK, Nov. 4.â Joe Gans was to
night awarded the decision over Kid Mc-
Purtland in a twenty-five round bout be
fore the Lenox Athletic Club. McPart
land was a favorite in the betting over
the Maryland boy. Both boxers had
weighed in at 3 o'clock, neither turning
the scales at 133 pounds and their train
ers claimed that both men were in the
pink of condition. The men put up a
beautiful fight, both landing freely and
fiercely. By the ninth round Gans 1 suc
cess in landing his left swings on the head
sent his stock up. McPartland began to
get a bit wild in his work, but the col
ored boy kept his temper and his wind
and kept planting the telling blows on
his opponent's face. When the gong
sounded at the end of the twenty-fifth
round, however, JNlac Ptill had plenty of
fight in him.
The preliminary bout between Billy
Needhain of St. Paul, and Johnny Mar
shall, an Australian negro, was scheduled
for ten rounds at 126 pounds, but the an
tipodean was a few pounds under the
limit. Xr-odham cut out the pace from
the start and sent his left to the face
mid right to the body, while the nagm
did a lot of work with the left, which he
chopped on the face and neck. Marshall ;
was bleeding- from the nose at the close I
of the eighth round. Marshall was the ;
aggressor in the final round, but Need- |
ham countered cleverly. Marshall landed ,
a hard left swing on the face toward the
end of the bout, but Needham had the |
call at the finish. Referee Charley
White, however, declared Marshall the
winner.

MANILA, Nov. 4.â The latest news
from Iloilo is that the rebels are ad

before them. Foreigners are afraid the
rebels will attack the town. Use Ne
gros has been taken by the rebels. It is
rumored that some of the Spaniards are
prisoners. In the northern provinces of
Luzon there is much misrule by the
local authorities. Sheep robberies are
frequept and the public is furious. The
provinces under the immediate control
of Aguinaldo are fairly well ruled. If
the United States assumes part of
Spain's Philippine debt it should insist
on the payment of deposits in the sav
ings bank, or Caja de Depositos. Ninety
per cent of the depositors are poor per
sons. It is reported the priests are in
stigating one faction to support Ar
taohio, the bitter opponent of Aguin
aldo. Increasing dissensions among the
insurgents are diminishing the prob
ability of the latter opposing the Amer
icans.

ENGLAND'S WAR
PREPARATIONS CONTINUE
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 4.â Last night
150 men arrived over the Canadian Pa
cific for the sloop-of-war Icarus, and
that vessel, which has been completely
refitted, was put into commission to
day. The flagship Imperieuse has been
provisioned and has. been taken abroad
limit of her supply of ammunition. All
her bunkers are full to the utmost ca
pacity of coal, and she is under steam
night and day ready to obey the first
order.
News received to-night is considered by
those in command to be the most im
portant which has reached here, and al
though "deserving the usual non-com
mittal attitude of the British officers,
those in command do not attempt any
denial of the assertion that a crisis has
been reached which is the gravest in
tho history of the empire in many
years. There is considerable specula
tion as to the destination of the Am
phion, the armored cruiser which left
here a few days ago under sealed or
ders. The opinion that she was head
ed for the French settlement at the So
ciety Islands is giving way to the idea
that she may have been ordered to the
China coast, although there seems but
little foundation for any change of the
first impression. The Leander will be
ready for service in a few hours, and
the torpedo-boat destroyer Virago is to
be commissioned at once. The Sparrow
Hawk, another destroyer, is coaled and
provisioned.
When the steamer Riojun Maru dock
ed here this morning her officers were
assailed with questions as to the con
dition of affairs on the China coast.
Captain Elliott says the Interest in Ma
nila happenings has now given way to
the possibility of war between Great
Britain and some other European
power. Five thousand men were re
cently landed at Wei-Hai-Wei to man
the British forts, and the large squad
ron there has recently been reinforced
by vessels from Hongkong. Russia has
22.000 men at Port Arthur.
There appears to be good foundation
for the statement that the Empress
vessels of the Canadian Pacific Rail
road line will take on their armament
immediately.
MATAAFA HAS NOT
YET BECOME KING
There Is a Serious Disagreement
Among Members of the Board
of Control of Apia.
VANCOUVER, B. 0., Nov. 4.â News
from Samoa is not very quieting. The
Board* of Control, during the present in
terregnum, had several meetings and then
split up. The Consuls of Germany, the
United Statea and England and the two
treaty officials did not work harmoniously
together. What this board really intend
ed to do has never been ascertained, but
it is believed that the President desired
to take charge of the Samoan Govern
ment and to run the whole show himself,
with occasional help from the Chief Jus
tice.
When the steamer Aorangi left Austra
lia it was learned that the relationship
between the British Consul and President
Raffel was strained.
The President was inclined to give in,
but he finds it difficult to extricate him
self from differences in which he has be
come involved by his own act. Meanwhile
Mataafa was not yet king when the mail
left.
Some of the people, urged on by a
section of foreigners, are advocating the
abolishment of the kingship. There are
others who are desirous of trying the
experiment of running the country with
out a king for six or twelve months. This
plan may receive favorable considera
tion from the Chief Justice, who actually
has full power in the matter. The treaty
In section 6 of article 3 confers upon him
the duty of settling the kingship.
The country 80 far is quiet, but this
state is owing entirely to the presence of
warships.
"SWIFTWATER BILL" IS
ON HIS WAY SOUTH
With the Last Lot of Dawsonites to
Come Out Before the Biver
Closes.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 4.â Three steam
ships reached port from Alaska, to-day,
bringing the last crowd of Dawsonites who
will reach the outside world before tho
river freezes, together with a large crowd
from Copper River and Atlin. The City
of Seattle, which was the first to arrive,
had about $100,000. The purser had $80,000
in the safe. The Danube, which arrived a
few hours later, had $80,000, and the
Amur, which tame in behind the Danube,
had $50.t'i>0. Among the arrivals was
Swlftwater Bill (W. G. Gates), who is
bound for San Francisco. He said he
would go to Oakland to live, where he
would be joined by Mrs. Gates. From
Oakland he will go to London late in the
winter.
The Dawsonites bring news that ice is
thickening on the river below the White
Horse. The day before the Seattle left
there was a heavy fall of snow all along
the coast. News is given by J. Grif
fiths Stephens, a mining expert of Dead
wood, of new finds on Scroggie Creek ..i
tributary of the Stewart, about twenty
miles from its mouth. This is the strike
which nan created such marked exclte
im-nt at Dawson and caused a stampede

RINGMASTER A SURPRISE
DEFEATED BENAMELA A NOSE
FOR THE OPENING EVENT.
Three Choices Captured Purses â Am
asa Outfooted a Cluster of
Speed in a Sprinting
Dash.
After letting his people down hard on
two or three different occasions Rubicon
gave a sample of what he can do in the
seven furlong event at Oakland yester
day. Tho big chestnut horse was held a
3 to 6 favorite by the ring and won all the
way, romping past the stand In l:27Vi- It
did look as if Bernardillo had a chance,
but Kiley had the leg up, and that youth
would make a bigger hit as mascot for some
losing baseball team. It was about all he
could do with hiÃ mount to oeat Sport
McAllister for the place.
The balance of the racing was very or
dinary. Of the favorites. Benamela and
Chinuahua spoiled the slate.
In the opening mile race, for selling
platers, Ringmaster, with Charley Th6rpe
on his back, outran himself. Ferguson let
the even money favorite Benamela away
last, and though Rutter persevered with
him got up in time to be beaten out a
nose. Ringmaster made all the running,
and stepped the distance off in l:4lVs.
Whitcomb, second most of the way, fin
ished in the show.
The six and a half furlong spin for fillies
went to the Burns & Waterhouse filly
Humidity, a 4 to 5 choice. Thorpe rode
her, and taking all the room he desired
through the stretch and more, too, led
Hemera out over two lengths. Jennie
Reid was the only other starter.
Rey del Tierra looked more than fit yes
terday, and the mile and a sixteenth pell
ing run was only play for him. He went
to the post a 7 to 10 favorite and was
always in the lead, finally winning hands
down from P. A. Finni-->n. Hennessy
rode Soscol hard, but had to be content
with third place honors.
There was a cluster of speed gathered
in the final five and a half furlong sprint,
with Chihuahua. Ed Gartland 11, Amasa
and Roadwarmer â  fancied in the order
named. After several attempts Amasa
eot away in the lead, which advantage
he held to the end. leading Little Alarm.

Charley Pesch, one of the right bowers
of Marcus Cartright, took the deserted
stand of the Prussian Club and chalked
up prices yesterday.
The stable of Pat Dunne, arrived Thurs
day night and is now stabled at Ingle
side track. Jinks, Paul Griggs, David
Tennj- and Survivor are the stars.
The Montana jockey owner, Billy Ding
ley, got in from the north yesterday
with Bill Howard, McPryor and None
Such.
Handicapper Brooks took umbrage at j
some newspaper criticism and mixed up |
with the sporting editor of an evening ;
Journal down in the paddock yesterday.
Bystanders interfered and the passage at
arms was a bloodless one.
The injury to Excursion, who was cut '
down in Thursday's race, has proved to be
such a bad one the colt will probably be
destroyed.
If Frawley would take a trip to some
springs, drink all the sulphur water in
the region, masticate a cord or so of Ore
gon pine wood and then diet on Chinese j
firecrackers for a fortnight it might in- j
fuse some vim into his riding. With any |
6ort of an intelligent ride Hemera might i
have given Humidity an argument.
The poor start Benamela got contrib- !
uted to his downfall. No fault could be |
found with Rutter's handling of the
brown horse, for had he won by a nose ;
instead of getting beaten . out by one
everybody would have been singing his j
praises. i
Vogt, who rode Tobey, should; when he I
gets ready to leave this sphere, will 1

microscopical society. He threw the leg j
over the horse mentioned in the opening ,
event, and so well were the animal's \
chances thought of that the ring laid 200 j
to 1 against him. Notwithstanding that !
he had no cha/ice. Vogt with his steels
kicked hair enough from the poor brute's
Bides to fill a mattress.
Lady Hurst is evidently sour, for when j
the barrier went up she turned with j
Thorpe and was left at the post.

would perhaps have gone his way. He is

HIGH CLASS DOGS TO
MEET AT INGLESIDE
FIRST CLASS COURSING PROM
ISED FOR TO-DAY.
A Fine Sixty-Four Dog Stake to Be
Run Off and Also a Good
Puppy Stake.
Leashmen who are desirous of seeing
first-class coursing should certainly at
tend the meetings at Ingleside Park to-
day and to-morrow, as there are among
the sixty-four candidates for coin and
glory many famous dogs. Forget, Tod
Sloan, Swlnnerton, Skyball, Laurelwood,
Rock Island Boy, Mind Your Eye, Irma,
Senorita, Connemara, Patrla and Moon
dyne are all first-class representatives of
the local kennels, and will doubtless re
tire from the field with distinction, at
least so far as to-day's sport is concerned.
As there are not a few Eastern dogs in
the stake which have shown good form
in private trials, it would be well for
speculators to exercide some caution when
betting on the courses, as some of the
dogs which will certainly figure in the
short end may surprise those who are
fenerally successful in picking winners,
winnerton and Killarney I^ass should
make a very close race, although the first
named dog may show the greater speed
to game. It is said that Prince Hall is
very liable to lower the colors of Rock
Island Boy, but he wiD need be a
"flier" to win a flag from me
Boy if the latter is in anything
like good form: still, there are many un
certainties 1n coursing. Bendalong and
Llssak should also run an interesting
course, provided that IJssak will not re
sort to cunning tactics. If Senorita is
right she may give Connemara a grueler,
especially if a good hare is liberated. If
Rocklin "Brll is in condition she should
make matters very interesting for Miss
Dividend, although she will doubtless be
placed on the short end.
So far as the puppies are concerned it
is difficult to pick the probable winners,
as the youngsters are unreliable and no
one can form an idea of how they will
act. It is generally the puppy stakes
that bother the talent, aB a line cannot
be drawn on the tyros, excepting in some
few instances.
Great preparations have been made by
the Ingleslde Coursing Club for its annual
meeting on the far-famed plains of Mer
ced The drawing 1 will be held in Pythian
Castle at 8:30 o'clock on Saturday even
ing the 12th inst.. and it will be limited
to sixty-four dogs. It can T!e said, right
now, that the stake is pretty well filled
and dog owners who anticipate seeing
their longtails flying over the sand dunes
should make application to Secretary
Ivlmer as soon as possible, or otherwise
they may find themselves shut out on the
evening of the drawing.
The club and its friends will leave here
on Monday morning, the 14th inst.. at 9
o'clock and will reach Merced at 2:30 p.
m â  fare for the round trip, good for four
days, is $4. A grand banquet will be held
immediately after the drawing on next
Saturday evening. *

PROGRESS OF THE
FOOTBALL TEAMS
AN INTEBESTING GAME FOB,
THIS AFTEBNOON.
Both College Elevens Actively Pre
paring for the Great Game
on Thanksgiving.
This afternoon the Stanford eleven will
line up against the Olympics and next Sat
urday California will meet the clubmen for
the last time this season. The athletic
club college matches have improved
steadily since the first game of the year,
and the contest to-day should be the best
of the season up to date. Unless Stanford
plays the Olympics on Tuesday, election
day, this will be the last opportunity to
see the cardinal in San Francisco before
the Intercollegiate match. From the play-
Ing of Stanford this afternoon the judg
ment of the football enthusiasts on the
respective strengths of the 'varsity teams
will be formed. The same critical eyes
will be fastened on the Californians next
week when they will play their last match
game before the final struggle of the
year.
Stanford has not yet recovered from
the shock of the freshman game, which
it thought would mean another victory
for their cherished colors. The California
freshmen played a cleaner, faster, more
cohesive game than any team wearing
the blue and gold ever put up. It was
no less than a revelation to the Califor
nia men who were accustomed to see
ragged work from a freshman football
aggregation. The excellence of the play
on the part of the California team forced
Stanford hors de combat very soon after
the opening of the game. California has
a capable lot of men in the freshman
class, and some of them will be on
the 'varsity this year. Smith proved him
self a very strong and effective ground
gainer, and he will undoubtedly be seen
in the Thanksgiving day game. Others
who displayed a knowledge and willing
ness to do something were Lippman,
More, Womble and Hill. Womble, the
left end, will probably play the same po
sition in the varsity, and Lippman sub
stitute half.
Team play is what Stanford will have to
develop in the next few weeks. There
seems to be a lack of concentration of ef
fort, which is due In a^neasure to the
little practice the men have had as a
team. Few of the players have lined up
with the college team in an intercollegi
ate game. They are now being trans
formed into a representative eleven un
der the watchful eyes of Harry P. Cross.
At present the bulk of his coaching has
been bestowed upon the center trio. The
backs have of necessity been more or
less neglected, but th's week the college
graduate players will begin their work on
the back Held.
At California the interest of the game is
still on the increase, although the team
has not shown any remarkable improve
ment in the past week. Cochran is stead
ily keeping the men down to hard, grill
ing practice, without much rest of any
kind. The freshman victory has enlivened
the spirits of the students, and they ttre
now hopeful of a victory on Thanksgiv
ing day. Team play is what is drilled
into the players, and they are taught for
the first time in their lives that there is
nothing half so effective as a hard, de
termined, plugging game. Hall, Kaars
berg. Smith and Thane form the quartet
of backs, and they are now playing with
some precision and harmony. The line
is the place on which the hopes of the
team will be anchored, and it is this sec
tion that is giving the coach the greatest
worry. The center trio is by no means
picked, nor wfll it be for some few days.
Cornish has superseded Greisberg at cen
ter, and has been playing a fair quality
of ball. The guards are the problem.
They are likely to be any two out of
Athern. Hoopor, Barnes and a number of
other candidates. The tackles are be
coming crystallized, however. They will
very likely be Pringle and Whipple; the
ends who are making the best showing
are Womble and Craig.
The Olympics have had the misfortune
to develop too late in the season for an
athletic club. The colleges appear in
their best form just about the middle of
November, but an athletic club that plays
every week should be in good trim early
in the season. And this is just what did
not happen to the Olympics. They are
now a strong team and will give Stanford
a hard rub to-day. It would not be very
surprising if the Olympics won the match
this afternoon; that is, if Hobbs, Wells
and Cadwallader play. Hobbs and Wells,
perhaps the strongest guards on the coast
to-day, have been training with the Olym
pics this week and intend to line up with
the eleven this afternoon. Should Cad
wallader play center the clubmen will
have a line that Stanford will not be able
to move an inch. With Erskine and pow
erful Sheehy as tackles the only weak
spots are the two ends, but this line is
sufficiently strong to smash any of Stan
ford's plays.
The teams will line up as follows:

. .Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 4.
To-morrow evening the ReoubUcani will
â¢hold a grand rally at the Macdonough
Theater. Senator George C. Perkins and
Victor H. Metcalf will address the voters.
There will be a grand street parade, and
after the meeting a banquet will be given
by the Republican Alliance.
Next Monday evening the Army and
Navy Republican League Will hold a big
demonstration in the Tabernacle. This
will be preceded by a parade.
Less is being heard each day of the In
dependent and unattached candidates,
and hourly the Republican party is be
coming more solid. "WitWn the past few
days it has been made very evident that
the opposition to Supervisor Talcott has
been effectively killed, and Supervisor
Church is now certain to .succeed himself.
There is no hope for the Democratic
manipulators to have a subservient Board
of Supervisors during the next two years.
This has been the most bitter fight during
the campaign, but as the election ap
proaches the opposition to the Republi
can ticket Is dying out.
Arthur Feidler, the Republican nominee
for Treasurer, wasted a day ana a half of
political work last week. He was busy
electioneering in what he supposed was
the northern district of this county. On
the second day he discovered tnat he had
spent a great deal of time and a little of
something else in working on voters In
Contra Costa County. Feidler says that
he loses nothing but his time by this, be
cause the cost cannot come within the
meaning of the purity of election laws.
THE GRAND JURY QUESTIONED.
One Member Died Before It Was Dis-
charged.
OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â Did the validity of
the last GTund Jury expire with the death
of F. K. Shattuck? On this point hangs
the legality of the Indictment against
Constable Yon Kapff of Al&meda. The
rase was called before Judge Ellsworth
this morning, and instead of pleading the
Sefendant liled a petition to sot aside the
Grand Jury's indictment and also a de
murrer.
In the petition the fact is recited that
:he Grand Jury was Illegal because of the
Jeath of one of its members, and because
j. A. Chasa was out of town at the time
ihe presentation was made. These objec
tions are apparently sustained by the sec

A CONFESSION.
Bays She Can Now Talk With a
Clear Conscience.
"While attending the State convention
d( the W. C. T. U. at Manville, Wyo.,
[ was entertained by Mr 3. Nina Higby.
MISS NINA D. PETTIGREW,
Bpearfish, - - South Dakota,
I am a temperance lecturer, and at
breakfast Mrs. Higby handed me a
lovely cup of coffee with the remark:
"Did you ever realize that it is not at
all consistent for temperance people to
continually advise others to avoid poi-
sonous stimulants and yet day by day
drink such articles themselves? This
" Is particularly true of coffee, which Is
Dne of the most powerful narcotics in
existence, although its effects are not
shown as actively as whisky."
I was rather surprised at her remark,
but after thinking it over a moment I
realized that it was apropos. I had no-
ticed many a case of nervous prostra-
tion -that was directly traceable to cof-
fee, for the individuals at once began
to Improve when they left off coffee,
and I had found it no in my own expe-
rience.
I had made several attempts to break
away from the habit and had failed,
much to my disgust, and, oftentimes,
when addressing an audience on the
evils of liquor drinking, 1 had in my
own heart felt that 1 was very much
like an old toper, the only difference
being that I wanted coffee and he
wanted liquor.
Mrs. Higby went on to say: "We
have abandoned coffee entirely in our
family, and are using the Postum Cer-
eal Food iade d(.-\vn at Battle
Creek, Mich., and I think when y<Â»u
drink ihis cup you will agree with me
that it is in many respecis a mure de-
licious beverage than ordinary coffee,
for it ha.s a smoother, more fascinating
Laste, much like the very highest grades
of mild Java."
I drank the cup slowly and realized
that her remarks were true, and I want
to say to you that 1 gained tUf more
valuable knowledge at that conv<
In Wyoming than that which i Learn* d
at the breakfast table where I had my
first cup of Postum. 1 bave sin
it regularly, very greatly to my physi-
cal and menial advantage, and have
found no difficulty whatever in doing
away with coffee. No one can tell
how glad I am to be free from its bane-
ful effects. I can now make a tem-
perance address with a clear con-
Bcience, and, perhaps, I might add, a
clearer complexion than formerly.
Nina D. Pettigrew, Spearfish, B, D.
Hunter. In 54th Cal., says: "An indict
ment found and presented by twelve
grand Jurors is valid, although the grand
jury, owing to the absence or death of
one or more of its members may consist
of leas than nineteen at the time of find
ing the indictment."
Judge Ellsworth will hear the petition
to-morrow morning.
He Was Shocked.
OAKLAND, Nov. 4.â Manuel Alvia is
one of those lucky men who can be
shocked with electricity without sustain
ing any serious injury. This morning he
Inadvertently completed the circuit at the
estuary drawbridge, and for a short time
was unable to disconnect himself from
the current that runs the electric rail
road. The track of course is disconnected
at the draw, and Alvis on passing over
this break stepped on one of the rails
across the divide and inadvertently com
pleted the circuit. He was considerably
shocked by the current and trembled with
lear and pain till an electric car passed
by and when it absorbed the current in
Its passage Alvis was able to disconnect
himself from the track.
. Catastrophe Averted.
OAKLAND, Nov. 4.â serious accident
at the curve leading from Webster street
across the track or the Southern Pacific
on First street was narrowly averted last
night. Through the failure of a signal to
work or the' misunderstanding of It by the
train hands, the broad gauge train on
First street, bound for AJameda, only
missed by a few feet crashing Into the
narrow gauge train, which was rounding
the curve on. its way to the mole. The
self-possession of the engineer on the nar
row gauge train alone prevented the ca
lamity. After receiving the signal to go
ahead he saw the approaching broad
gauge train and at once reduced his
speed, bringing up just a little distance
from where the other train was crossing
right ahead of him.

THE SOCIAL
SEASON OPENS
Debutantes at the Fort
nightly German â The
Greenway Dinner
Party.
The Friday Fortnightlys held their first
; dance last evening and formally opened
the season of '98-99. The same delightful
informality that has been a feature ot
the former meetings of this club prevailed
last evening, making this dance in every
way a most charming affair. Like all the
former dances of the Fortnightlys, Lunt's
Hall on Polk street was the scene of ac
tion and an artistic array of potted palms
and ferns lent to the hall a festive ap-
pt-arance.
Mrs. Monroe Salisbury and Mrs. Gordon
lil.-tnding, patronesses of the dancing
class, received the guests, assisted by
Mrs. Charles Page and Mrs. Kip. Seven
ty-live couples took part in the german,
and there was a large number of chap
erons in the visitors' seats. In fact, so
mnnt-rous have the demands for visitors'
tickets become that the management has
been obliged to considerably restrict the
number issued.
The cotillon, an extremely pretty one,
introducing several pretty and new fig
was led by E. H. Sheldon, assisted
ny Miss Olive Holbrook. one of this sea
son's debutante?. In the first set were
Miss Susie Blanding. Miss Elmore, Miss
Spreckels. Miss Lillie Sprc-ckels,
Silaa Mary Kip. Miss Romie Wai late,
Miss Margaret Salisbury, Miss Kate Sal
isbury. Mies Muriel Atherton and Iflss
Edward M". Greenway celebrated his
birth<lav last evening by giving a dinner
in the Ked Room at the Bohemian Club.
Cavers were laid for thirty and a most
elaborate menu was discussed.
A remarkable feature of the entertain
ment was the lateness of the dinner hour,
half-past eight. A general adoption of
the late dinnerâ and when Mr. Greenway
leads ail followâ necessarily means a lit
tle social revolution. Dinners followed by
dances will be almost impossible affairs,
â¢uid as far as the theater party after din
ners, tha* will be entirely out of the ques
tion. .
Excellent music and gorgeous decora
tions lent their aid to the many charming
features of the entertainment.

Guiseppe FiKoni and W. D. Leavenson,
who were arrested for dumping garbage
in San Mateo County in violation of the
ordinance providing* for the burning of all
garbage in the garbage crematory, were
released yesterday by Judge Cook on bail
pending the hearing of writs of habeas

arrest of Flgoni and Leavenson was
caused for the purpose of establishing
the legality of the ordinance.
BROUGHT DOWN
A MILLION IN
WHALEBONE
Whalers Arrive From
the Arctic.
ALL MADE GOOD CATCHES
CREW OF THE GRAMPUS WAS
â¢ AWAY THREE YEARS.
A Number of Casualties â One Man
Was Lost in a Fog and Starved
to Death â Another One
Jumped Overboard.
"Whaling is better than Klondiking,"
said an old tar as he watched the steam
whalers Grampus and Karluk pass
Meiggs wharf yesterday. Earlier in the
day the Narwhal had also got in and in
consequence whalers ashore for a run
were plentiful.
Since August last there has either ar
rived from the whaling fleet on other
steamers or come in on the whalers them
selves 115,426 pounds of bone, 3715 barrels
of oil and 9510 pounds of ivory. The Nar
whal brought in yesterday 42,600 pounds of
bone and 548 barrels of oil, the Kariuk
50000 pounds of bone and four bearskins
and the Grampus 40.000 pounds of bone.
This will make a total of 303;026 pounds of
bone, which, at the present low figure of
$3 50 a pound, equals $710,591.
At the present time whale oil is worth
about 16 a barrel, so that the catch of
that article Is worth in the open market
$25,818. The catch however, has been a
very poor one, as few of the whalers took
the trouble to save the oil once they had
secured the whalebone. In consequence
the price of oil is sure to advance as soon
as the last of the fleet has been heard
from. In round figures the value of tho
catch, which has arrived up to date, is
not far short of a million dollars.
There are still to be heard from the Be
luga with 31 whales. Mary D. Hume 10,
Jeanette 2, Balaena 24, William Baylies t>
and Alaska one whale. As each whale will
average at least $6000 these vessels will
bring in another half-million, which tends
to show that there is some truth in the
old salt's statement that "whaling Is bet
ter than Klondiking."
The Narwhal sailed from San Francisco
on March 9, 1897, and wintered in Lang
ton Bay, 300 miles to the eastward of tho
Mackenzie River. Just before sailing'
John Leary, a boatsteerer, was brought
aboard drunk. Instead of getting better
he developed delirium tremens, and when
the Narwhal was six days from port he
jumped overboard at night and was
drowned. During the summer in the Arc
tic a Kanaka sailor got lost in the fog
and a month later his shipmates found his
remains. He had starved to death. Two
other members of the Narwhal's crew
died from natural causes, so that vessel
had quite a casualty list.
The Karluk only left here on March 15,
1898, so her crew have only been on a
short cruise. Captain McGregor reports
that the Balaena and Thrasher were to
sail from Unalaska for San Francisco on
October 26. The crew of the Karluk took
seven whales, but the whalebone from the
majority of them was sent down last Au
gust.
The Grampus is the vessel that has had
a long siege of it in the Arctic. She left
here on March 21, 1595, and nearly all the
men who went north on her came back
with Captain Cumisky. â¢
On March 9, 1596, Charles Morton went
out hunting for deer. He got lost In a fog
and died of starvation. On January 26.

The work of raising the sunken river
steamer J. D. Peters was begun yester
day. Pontoons' were put alongside, and
the chances are that the vessel will be

temporary repairs. She will then be
taken to Stockton for a thorough over
hauling. The new steamer H. J. Corcoran
has been put on the run in place of the
Peters. As soon as the overhauling now
being given the T. C. Walker is completed
she will take up the Peters' run and the
Corcoran will take her old schedule. I

WIDELY DIFFERENT STORIES
TOLD FROM THE SAME PLAT
FORM.
JThe ''Little Giant" Also Addresses
Large Audiences in the Towns
of Red Bluff and
Redding.
Special Difratch to The Call.
MARYSVTLLE, Nov. 4.â The special
train bearing James G. Maguire and
party on their lightning tour of North
ern California was an hour and a half
late reaching this point. It was sched
uled to arrive here at 3 o f clock this
afternoon, but did not come until 4:30.
Prominent Democrats, with two four
in-hands and a band of music, escorted
the party to the Marysville Theater,
â¢where Kirby S. Mahon of Yuba City,
ex-District Attorney of Sutter County,
actinp chairman of the meeting, in
troduced the "Little Giant" to a large
audience, many ladies and Republicans
being in the gathering.
Maguire begun with thanks for the
hearty welcome of the citizens and a
reference to the lloral decorations,
â which, he said, evidenced the int
of the ladi.-s in the camp of the De
mocracy. Referring to the hoarseness
al his voice the speaker said it was due
to the fact that he was doing a great
deal of his own talking, while Gage
â was wearing out several throats bought
â¢toy the railroad. Then followed a se
vere arraignment of the railroad com
pany, combined monopolies and insti
tutions of corporate greed. He referred
to the Silver Republicans as disciples
of Lincoln, who were not to blame for
lighting shoulder to shoulder with
Jeffersonian Democrats and Populists.
There was every reason why the three
should be united and no reason why
they should not be united. The battle
of 1*96, he said, was being fought over
again in California.
To Hon. Marion de Vries, candidate
for re-election to Congress, the speaker
paid a handsome tribute, exhorting his
auditors to stand by him and the Dem
ocratic nominees for the Railroad Com
mission and Board of Equalization. He
also spoke a good word tor the legisla
tive nominees, Ostrom and Hicks. He
referred to the attempt of the Repub
licans to eliminate all issues save the
single tax, of which Barnes knows
nothing. Gage less. Knight still less
and Van Duser less than any man liv
ing. In conclusion he promised to fill
the office of Governor with the same
fairness, fearlessness and impartiality
which he claims characterizes his past
record.
The other candidates on the State
ticket were introduced, each in turn
making speeches.
Following closely the adjournment of
Maguire's meeting in the Marysville
Theater, Hon. Tirey L. Ford, candidate
for Attorney General, and Hon. Frank
McGowan addressed the voters of Yuba
and Sutter counties from the same
platform this evening. Ford began
by a refernce to his early life, which
â¢was spent in Sacramento Valley, where
he labored at tilling the soil and har.
vesting to get the first few hundred
dollars which enabled him to begin the
study of law. He reviewed the his
tory of the country, comparing exist
ing conditions under successive admin
istrations to prove that prosperity fol
lows under Republican regimes. The
balance of trade is always in favor of
the United States when the protective
tariff of Republicanism is in vogue,
â while, with equal regularity, it is
against the country when a tariff for
revenue only prevails. He pointed out
the inconsistency of Maguire, who
stand? on three antagonistic platforms.
He then paid a tribute to Gage, and
concluded by calling attention to the
opportunity now presented to Califor
nia through territorial expansion,
which means the trade of the Orient,
and urging his auditors to stand by
the administration.
Hon. Frank McGowan pointed to the
superiority of the Republican State
platform over that of the "Confusion"
party. The speaker exposed the record
of White and Maguire on the war reso
lutions, also Maguire's record as a "sin
gle taxfr," referring to the latter as a
man who voted against a bill exclud
ing anarchists from this country. He
combated the argument that the State
Republican ticket is a railroad ticket
and closed with an eloquent reference
to the war with Spain and the patriot
ism and valor of the American soldiers.
RED BLUFF, Nov. 4.â A big crowd
greeted Judge Maguire and his com
panions at this place to-day, but the
lack of enthusiasm in such a crowd
amounted to a frost. The platform
was erected un the railroad reservation,
and Messrs. Hutchison, Conley, An
drews, Woodman, Mulholland and
Runckle were in turn presented by
Chairman McCoy, all of whom lauded
Maguire. After each had said a few
â¢words Judgf Maguire wpsVntroduced,
â¢who started by compl^y-nting the
â¢ flowers, and said this was a contest
between allied monopolies and repre
sentatives of the Jpffersonian Democ
racy. He said he would not be able to
discuss the details of political issues for
lack of time, and then proceeded to oc
cupy much time in talking about Gen
eral Barnes and the late war, instead
of telling the people what laws he had
pushed through Congress during his
Bix years' term.
Mr. Maguire asserted that Southern
Pacific attorneys were doing Mr. Gage's
talking, and he again mentioned Gen
eral Barnes as the ablest and most elo
quent attorney in the employ of thÂ«
railroad, but forgot to tell that Gen
eral Barnes is also the attorney of the
Examiner, whose special train is bear
ing Mr. Maguire throueh Sacramento
Valley. He declared that the silver
question is not settled and â will not be
until settled in compliance with the
platform declaration upon which stood
Mr. Bryan, "the worthy successor of
Thomas Jefferson."
He then went over his railroad ha
rangue, and showed his inconsistency
by attempting to discredit Congress
man Barbara after admitting that his
amenrln^nt in regard to the CentrnJ
Pacific debt was a good one. He stuck
to th<> one issue which the Examiner
has mapped out for him to speak upon,
and repeated many times that the rail
road question was not settled by Con
gress. He did not deny his single tax
views, but declined to discuss them, be
cause no party had declared for the
single tax: but this did not prevent him
from trying to engraft them upon the
laws of the land while in Congress. He
thought the Republican panty as now
constituted should be wiped out of ex
istence; but this may have been from
a fear that it might wipe him out of
existence next Tuesday.
The Red Bluff band, the many ladies
and hundreds of school children helped
to make a big crowd, but there was a
â¢woeful lack of enthusiasm, and it is
â afe to say that Mr. Maguire made no
vote? by his visit.
REDDING, Nov. 4.â James O. Ma
quire and party arrived from San Fran
cisco by special train at 6:30 o'clock
this morning. The explosion of much
powder heralded the event. At 8 o'clock
Maguire and Hutchison were driven to
Armory Hall. A large crowd was in
waiting. C. W. Herzinger announced
Thomas B. Dozier as chairman of the
meeting. E. L. Hutchison, for Lieu
tenant Governor, was introduced and
talked for half an hour. Other State
candidates were rapidly introduced,
made their bows, spoke a few words
and then too* their seats.
The introduction of James G. Ma
guire was attended by much enthusi
asm. The speaker wasted little time
in the preliminaries, but launched out
into an argument that dealt largely
with the so-called "railroad question."
He apparently made a good speech
from the Democratic standpoint, as he
was frequently applauded. Maguire
finished his talk shortly after 9 o'clock
and the party at once repaired to the
special train and was off for the south.
FRESNO VOTERS LISTEN
TO GENERAL BARNES
His* Forceful, Eloquent Words Take
the Vast Audience by
Storm.
FRESNO. Nov. 4.â General W. H. L..
Barnes was given a splendid reception in
this clly last evening:. He spoke for one
and a half hours in the Barton Opera
house ttn the largest political gathering
seen here since Henry T. Gage spoke in
Fresno. In the evening tne whistles of
tlio man" industries blew a shrill welcome
to the speaker, anvils were fired and mu
sic tilled the air. Judge H. Z. Austin,
chairman of the County Central Com
mittee, caJled the meeting to order and
introduced Frank H. Short as chairman.
In a few words Mr. Short presented Gen
eral Barnes, who was greeted with rous
insr cheers. He presented the issues of
the campaign in a. forceful and eloquent
manner. When the general declared that
"God and Dewey gave us the Philippines,
and by God and Dewey we'll keep them!"
the house stormed with applause.
Three tfrnes the speaker attempted to
resume, but was Interrupted each time.
I He also scored Congressman Castle, who
! delivered a wild harangue the night be
fore, denouncing the administration. Gen
eral Barnes branded the single tax as
revolutionary, destructive and pernicious,
and said a "man who could believe In it
was mentally unbalanced. He predicted
the election of Gage by a majority of 15,
000. It would not be a Republican vic
tory so much as a triumph of the people
and an escape from a ruinous policy.
The meeting adjourned with cheers for
j General Barnes and the Republican ticket.
CANNOT VOTE FOR MAGUIRE.
Prominent Democrat Presides at a :
Republican Rally.
SAN LUIS OBISPO. Nov. 4.â A sensa
tion was sprung in the political affairs
of this county to-nig3it at a huge Re- j
publican rally. Hon. Charles H. John- |
son, always a strong Democrat and a
former member of the State Legislature,
consented to preside. He was greeted
with wild cheering, and at its close spoke
as follows:
"This is the first time I ever presided
over a Republican meeting, and I never
thought I should do such a thing. For
years I have been a consistent Democrat,
feeling a high sense of honor in follow- j
ing its flag, whether to victory or de- j
feat. But to-night I feel that my place
is no longer with a party which has sold I
itself out with no regard for principle.
I cannot vote for James G. Maguire for !
Governor nor for the fusion candidates
for Congress or the State Legislature,
and in this year of political treachery on ,
behalf of the Democratic boss politicians
I shall vote the Republican ticket."
His > few words were drowned in ap
plause. Mr. Johnson has many friends j
who will follow his advice. Hon. Frank
R. Davis and Francisco Dominguez of Los
Angeles spoke and appealed for the elec- |
tion of R. J. "Waters to Congress, which ;
met with favor.
"A DOLL'S HOUSE."
Blanche Bates and the Frawleys
Give a Remarkable Ibsen
Performance.
The performance of "A Doll's House"
that was given in the Baldwin Theater
yesterday afternoon marks a chapter
in the history of local theatricals and
reflects more than passing credit on
Miss Blanche Bates, who, besides giv
ing what was in many respects an ad
mirable personation of Nora, was per
sonally responsible for the first presen
tation of an Ibsen play ever given in
San Francisco. A great many people
have read "A Doll's House" and many
have seen it played In other cities; it is
the most "popular" in its appeal of all
Ibsen's dramas â but whether this fact
will account for the immense attend
ance at the matinee is another ques
tion. The advertising had been nobly
executed by the press agent and the
critics; the public had an idea that the
matinee was to be something special
ar-rt exclusive. So everybody was there,
especially the ladles.
The audience ranged from rabid
Ibsenites who received every line in
reverent silence, never by any chance
applauding until the curtain was down,
to the careless matinee girl who laugh
ed whenever there was a chance, and
frequently when there was not; but
fortunately everybody, whatever his
standpoint of entertainment, was not
ably interested, and it is a matter of
important record that the first Ibsen
play given here was a popular as well
as artistic success.
This is hardly the time of day to say
that "A Doll's House" is one of the
greatest of modern dramatic master
pieces. As printed drama its qunlity
was known even here years ago. But
it is a matter of gratificationâ perhaps
provincial gratification â to find out for
ourselves that it is equally telling in
performance. Practicableness must be
considered when a play is in question,
and after yesterday's performance not

STEAMER CROATAN
BURNED AT SEA
Disaster Occurs Near
Cape Charles.
FIVE " PERSONS PERISH
TWENTY-TWO, HOWEVER, MAN
AGE TO ESCAPE.
Survivors Tell How Flames Envelop
the Vessel From Stem to Stern
in a Very Short
! Time.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Nor. 4.
A disaster at sea, fortunately with a
small loss of life, five persons In all,
was made known to-day by the land
ing here of twenty-two persons who
escaped from the burning steamer
Cioatan of the Clyde Line, bound from
New York for Wilmington, N. C, and
Georgetown, S. C.
The disaster occurred on November
1, about eighteen miles north of Cape
Charles and about 206 miles from New
York, from which port the steamer
sailed on October 31 with a general
cargo and eight passengers.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the
burned hull of the freighter sank be
neath the waves. Of the twenty-seven
persons who were on board, twenty
two have survived. These passengers
were landed at this port this afternoon
by the schooner Alice E. Clark of Port
land, Me., which was in the vicinity of
the Croatan at the time she was
burned.
The Croatan's list of drowned Is as
follows:
JEREMIAH MCCARTHY of Nova
Scotia, second assistant engineer, leaves
a widow in New York.
STEWARD JAMES CURTIS of Jer
sey City.
MRS. JAMES CURTIS, wife of the
steward.
FRANK , an oiler, last name
unknown.
JENNIE WILLARD. colored, Wil
mington, N. C.
The story of the disaster as told by
Captain Hale and other officers of the
unfortunate vessel is as follows: The
Croatan was but twenty hours from
New York on her way to Wilmington,
with a smooth sea and calm weather,
when, at 3 p. m., a fireman came hur
riedly on deck and reported that the
ship was on fire. A general alarm was
immediately given and an effort was
made to lower the boats, but the fire
spread with such rapidity that all
efforts to reach them were unavailing.
In fact, in less than ten minutes after
the fire was reported the ship was rom
pletely enveloped in flames from stem
to stern. Shortly after the fire was dis
covered an explosion took place in the
cargo which blew off the after hatches.
A second explosion followed a few
minutes later and the ship was then a
mass of flames. It was at this time
even the fiercest devotee of Sardou and
Belasco can gainsay the spellbinding
qualities of "A Doll's House" as a sim
ple, actable drama. It is first of all a
plain play for practical play actors
after that you can discuss its philos
ophy and psychology as much as you
like. In point of construction, economy
of effort and cumulative force the piece
is marvelous. There is not a character,
a situation or a line that does not fit
like an inspiration. And thie problem is
presented in the only right way â so as
to seem the outcome of the drama
rather than the other way round.
The acting was startlingly even and
strong. The actors took neither the
parts nor themselves with undue seri
ousness; they played as they might
have done in any other play, perhaps
with a trifle more repression and with
more attention to the ensemble, and the
whole performance was one of intel
ligence and authority. Miss Bates
eeemed to feel her responsibilities in
the first act, making Nora acutely ner
vous rather than lark-like; but her
second act was full of fine sensitive
art, and the strain and excitement of
the last act she made very vivid by
playing in a quick colloquial key. In
all it was an ambitious performance,
volatile, sympathetic and keenly ana
lytical. The town owes Miss Bates a
big debt.
Mr. Roberts played Helmer with a
fine blend of good nature, austerity
and patronage. Mr. Edwards was very
much to the good as Krogstad, Louis
Payne kept the difficult doctor in a
plausible key, and Miss La Verne was
delightfully unvarnished as Mrs.
Linden.
The performance was such an imme
diate success that the management de
cided to repeat it to-morrow night in
place of "An Enemy to the King," as
previously announced.
ASHTON STEVENS.
that Captain Hale, seeing that to re
main on the vessel meant sure death,
gave orders for all hands to jump over
board and save themselves as best they
could. The gallant captain was the
last man to leave the ship, remaining
on deck with his first officer until they
were completely enveloped in flames
and the vessel had commenced to sink.
There seemed to be no panic on board,
and men and women, after lashing on
their life preservers, calmly leaped into
the water, seeing that their chance of
escape was much more certain than if
they remained cm board the burning
ship. Some of the passengers had their
faces scorched and many had their
clothing on fire when they leaped into
the water. The captain and first offi
cer succeeded in securing a yawlboat
which had been damaged in lowering
and by hard work rescued eight persons
from the water.
The burning ship was sighted by the
four-masted schooner Alice E. Clark,
which lay about six miles off, and her
captain sent a boat and crew to a-id in
the work of rescue. They succeeded in
rescuing twelve persons, many of whom
had been an hour or more in the watc-r
and were nearly exhausted. They were
taken on board the Clark and given
every possible attention.
The rescued persons are being cared,
for here at the Seamen's Bethel and at
the homes of citizens and will proceed
to New York to-morrow.
No explosives were known to be
among the ship's cargo and the origin
of the fire is a mystery to her officers
and crew.

end the shooting was difficult. The birds
throughout were strong flyers.
RUHLIN MAKES A SHOW
OF JOE CHOYNSKI
The San Franciscan Saved From a
Knockout Several Times by
the Gong.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 4.â Joe Choyns
kt narrowly escaped being put to sleep
several times to-night at the Arena Ath
letic Club before the savage blows of Gus
Ruhlln of Akron. Ohio. Each time he was
apparently saved by the bell. The bout
was limited to six rounds and was one of
the fastest seen here in a long time.
Ruhlin towered high over Joe s head and
there was a difference of between twenty
five to thirty pounds in favor of the Akron
fighter. He forced the fighting from be
ginning to end. Choynski sprinting re
peatedly around the ring In his efforts to
get out of the way.
Toward the close of the first round Joe
steadied himself for the first ami only
time, and landed several hard rights and
lefts on Ruhlin's face. One of the blows
broke Choynskl's right forefinger. In the
early part of the second round Choynski
fell through the ropes and landed on nis
head while evading Ruhlin. The Ohio
man forced Joe all about the ring for the
next three rounds, and the San Francis
can was shaky at the termination of it,
falling down several times to evade Ruh
lin's rushes. Ruhlin fouled a number of
times In the clinches, but it was apparent
ly due to the heat of the encounter. Both
men eased up In the final round, which
was uneventful.
INCREDIBLE SUFFERING
REPORTED FROM GIBARA
Surgeon Woodson Says That Small
pox Is Baging to an Alarm
ing Extent.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9B, by James Gor

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Nov. 4.â The
report made to General Wood by Cap
tain R. S. Woodson, surgeon of the
regular army, who accompanied Colonel
Hood's six companies to Gibara, says
the condition of the people and the
prevalence of smallpox is almost in
credible. There are more than Â§00

several hundred at Gibara. Captain

Murder in the First Degree.
EUGENE, Or., Nov. 4.â Claud Bran

Linn last June, was this morning con
victed of murder in the first degree.
He will be sentenced on Tuesday.
BONNET WILL BE
ELECTED SHERIFF.
HIS FRIENDS JUBILANT OVER
THE PROSPECT.
Bemarkable Campaign Made by the
Popular License Collector
Without "Mazuma."
One of the most striking features of the
present campaign is the -wonderful vic
tory about to be scored by T. P. Bonnet,
the popular nominee for Sheriff on the
Democratic and Non-Partisan tickets. Tho
army of friends who have been canvassing
the various districts in the interest of Mr.
Bonnet met last night at Pythian Castle
and reported that he had the fight won.
The result of a canvass of the business
portion of the city showed ihnr business
men strongly Indorse Mr. Bonnet for his
clean record as License Collector. They
warmly commend his fre^ tern from the
bosses and boodlers, and bis manly inde
pendence in fearlessly administering pub
lic business in the interest of the people.
Mr. Bonnet was the first License Collec
tor who had the courage to enmpei the
railroad company to pay a license on
every car used. During his administration
the city has derived a vastly iar^er reve
nue from the office than that of any of his
predecessors. He is a strong believer i>!
the doctrine that a public office is a pub
lic trust, hence he has earned the confi
dence of the people. Such men should be
retained in the public service when found,
but it Is such a rare discovery that Mr.
Bonnet has every reason to feel proud of
his record. His election will be a well
earned reward. x
The Public Administrator's Fight.
A rough canvass of the town indi
cates that Captain Freese, for Public
Administrator, is in the lead for that
office. It seems all classes of citizens
are in favor of retaining him in his
position. As a stevedore he has employ
ed thousands of men, and in the "busi
ness" vote he does not appear \o have
fallen behind. It looks like Freeso and
nothing else for this responsible post.
SAN JOSE WIFE'S
ILL TREATMENT
Mrs. A. G. Bennett Seeks
a Divorce.
EXTREME CRUELTY ALLEGED
BEATEN AND DRIVEN FROM
HER HOME.
Delmas and Jarman Represent the
Plaintiff and the Case Is
Attracting Great At
tention.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 4.â The cruelty
barbarous acts of A. G. Bennett Jr., a
prominent young society man and pol
itician of this city, toward his wife,
Doris Cambers Bennett, will shortly be
aired in court. The initial steps were
taken yesterday when suit for divorce
was commenced by Mrs. Bennett. The
complaint is brief, and merely states
that plaintiff since her marrige, by
reason of her husband's conduct, has
suffered great mental and bodily in
jury. Her attorneys are D. M. Delmas
and A. H. Jarman, and this indicates
there will be a contest over a separa
tion.
The marriage of A. G. Bennett and
Miss Cambers came as a surprise to
their many friends on May 12 last. Ben
nett was a very - opular young man and
prominent in affairs of the Firs Meth
odist Church, and the announcement of
his marriage shocked the members of
that place of worship. For years he had
been going with Miss Grace Northrup,
and he had told nearly every one he
was engaged to her. When it became
known how he had treated Miss North
rup the church people took the matter
up and he was ostracized from their
society. .-Â». boycott was also declared,
and his dentistry business paid for his
fickleness through a falling off of prac
tice. In the course of a couple of
months this hard feeling wore off, and
Dr. Bennett was received back into the
church circles.
The same socirtv and church circles
were as unceremoniously shocked
again on the morning of September 26,
after the "oung couple had enjoyed but
four short months of wedded bliss, by
the announcement in the dally papers
that Dr. Bennett would not be respon
sible for the debts of his wife, as she
had left his bed and board.
Mrs. Bennett, who is a most esti
mable young woman, returned to her
mother's home. Her story showed she
had been barbarously and cruelly
treated by her husband and his peo
ple. Her marriage was somewhat in
the nature of an elopement, and Ben
nett.'s motho- sister objected to his
choice. Dr. Bennett took his wife to
his mother's home, and from the be
-innin~ there was trouble. His relatives
did everything possible to make her un
comfortable and finally she could
stand it nc h n^er. On September 26
she pinned Â« note on her pillow saying
she had gone home for good, and he
need not expect her to return.
Mrs. Bennett says her husband struck
and beat her and practiced all manner
of cruelties. Before she left him she
was in a delicate condition and this
seemed to enrage him. On one occasion
she told him his acts were driving her
to suicide, and he volunteered to get
her any weapon or poison she wanted
to end her life. In fact she says he en
couraged her to kill herself.
The trial of the divorce case will be
interesting, and society will anxiously
await the outcome.
REA'S FORCES
ARE ON THE RUN
One of the Gang Candidates for Sher-

SAN JOSE, -<ov. 4.â George Y. Bol
linger, the gang Democratic nominee
for Sheriff, has been "hauled down."

Mackenzies and other leaders ' the
gang held a conference this morning:,
at which Bollinger was also present,
and decided something must be done to
beat James H. Lyndon, the Good Gov
e- 'ment ca-did&te for Sheriff. Bollin
per was told that in order to do this
he must get out of the fight and throw
his votes to Landlord. Bollinger took
this order from the boss like a little
man. and only asked that he be not
compelled to make a public announce
mer* through the gang press of his
withdrawal. Rea made one o' his char
acteristic braggadocio speeches of how
his power was extending and four
years hence he would be a State boss,
and then Bollinger would be ensconced
in a good fat position In the State Gov
ernment.
Bollinger was given to understand by
Boss Rea and "Johnnie Mackenzie
that he must see his friends personally
and make ther" support Langford, and
also to keep old-line Democrats in his
*â rty and to make tern vote for him.
The hottest contest on the county
ticket is for Sheriff. There are three
candidates in the field â Lyndon (Good
Government), Langford (Republican)
and Bollinger (Democrat). Either of the
latter two is satisfactory to Rea, and
the boss' order has been any one to
beat Lyndon. Langford developed the
most strength, and consequently the
gan" will get back of him. His record
as a gan~ster and school trustee is well
known and suf lent to beat him. Not
only is Langford distasteful to the vot
ers, but his election means the ap
pointment of "Johnnie" Mackenzie as
Under Sheriff. _^

BARRY SUED TO
COMPEL HIM
TO PAY TAXES
Democratic Candidate
in the Courts.
OWES TAXES SINCE 1892
TAX COLLECTOR EASILY PROVES
HIS CASE.
Barry Makes No Denial, but Tries to
Evade Judgment Through
the Use of Tech
nicalities.
The power of the courts has been In
voked to compel James H. Barry, the
Democratic candidate for Congress, to
pay his taxes. As far back as the year
1892 Mr. Barry was a delinquent, while
the Tax Collector's books for 1894. 1895
end 1596 show unpaid claims against him
aggregating to-day, with penalties, costs,
etc, about $400.
Some of the cases against Barry were
brought to trial yesterday afternoon in
Justice Barry's court. W. M. Willetts,
special counsel for the collection of de
linquent taxes, represented the city and
county, while Attorney O'Keefe appeared
for the defendant.
The proceedings opened at 3 p. in., when
the prosecution introduced the booka of
the Tax Collector's office in evidence to
Bhow that Barry owed the money. Mr.
"vViiletts then moved for an immediate
Judgment, stating that he had no need
to offer further testimony, the Judge be
ing familiar with the statutes covering
all such cases.
O'Keefe raised objection on purely tech
nical grounds. He said tnat it had not
been shown that Willetts or anybody else
had been authorized to bring the suits;
that so far as he knew the Supervisors
had no power to collect delinquent taxes,
and that the whole proceeding was ir
regular. He made no attempt to refute
the testimony that Barry owed the taxes
to the city and county, refusing to make
answer when pressed on this point by the
opposing counsel. O'Keefe was evidently
playing to secure a continuance until
after next Tuesday, and pleaded that he
â wanted to "prepare some authorities for
presentation to the court."
Judge Barry checkmated his little game
by saying that he would grant a contin
uance for one day, and that would give
the legal representative of Mr. Barry time
to get his authorities in shape. O'Keefe
â was obliged to admit that the time was
sufficient, and the case accordingly went
over until 2 o'clock this afternoon, when
there is no possible way for Barry to es
cape a decision against him.
O'Keefe stated after the court ad
journed that he proposed to take an ap
peal to the Superior Court, which shows
that he expects to lose his case. Candi
date Barry did not condescend to appear,
as it was only a matter of such slight im
portance as beating the city out of money
due on taxes.
HAS MADE HIS LAkT ARREST.
Detective "Abe" Anthcny Dying at
Gilroy Hot Springs.
A gloom was cast over the members of !
the detective force yesterday when word j
was received that Detective Anthony was
seriously ill at the Gtlroy Hot Springs.
According to a man who had just arrived
from the springs. Anthony was danger
ously ill and likely to die. A dispatch waa
at onoe sent to the manager of the resort,
asking him to find out the condition of the
well-known detective. In a short time an
answer waÂ» received saying that Antnony
could not live.
"Honest Abe," as he is lamiliarly known
to his fellow-officers, several days ago
asked Captain of Detectives Bohen for a
leave of absence. "I don't feel just right,"
be remarked, "and I would like to take a
vacation."
As he did not appear to be well, Cap
tain Bohen advised him to go to the
springs and take a much-needed rest. To
his fellow-detectives just before leaving
police headquarters Anthony remarked
that he did not think he would ever re
turn.
â¢ "It's all up with me, boys," he lugubri
ously remarked. "I guess I've made my
last arrest."
"It is too bad," Badly remarked Captain
Bohen when he heard the news. "Abe
Twas one of the best fellows I ever met.
He was always kind and considerate, and
â¢as a detective he; ranked with the best
men in the department. Hie loss will be
a great blow to all of us."
Anthony has been connected with the
Police Department for nearly twenty
years, and is held in high esteem
by Chief Lees and the Police Commis
sioners.

LIEUT. COL. WAGNER HERE.
He Ib Assigned to the Command of
the Presidio by General Merriam.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Wagner,
Fourth Cavalry, arrived in the city yes
terday morning and reported to Major
General Merriam. He was immediately
assigned to the command of the Presidio
by the department commander, Major
Kenzie, who has been in temporary com
mand for the past few days, being re
lieved.
Colonel Wagner was promoted as a ma
jor from the Fifth Cavalry some months
ago, and was ordered to report here, but
was given a sick leave by the War De
partment, which was on several occasions
extended. Colonel Wagner is an old sol
dier, with a record for gallantry and
bravery of which he may well be proud.
He distinguished himself in the last war
and was brevetted captain for conspicuous
gallantry before Petersburg, Va_, in the
memorable fight of the Crater. Colonel
Wagner is a native of Germany. Ho en
listed in the army in 1856 as a private. Hia
soldierly qualities gained him early notice,
and he was rapidly promoted through the
various non-commissioned offices until he
was finally made second lieutenant in 1863
and assigned to the Eleventh Infantry.
One year later he was promoted to a first
lieutenancy. In 1566 Colonel Wagner was
transferred to the Twenty-ninith Infantry
and three years after his transfer was
made captain. In 1871 he was assigned to
the First Cavalry. With this regiment he
served nineteen years, until he received

GREAT REPUBLICAN PARADE TO=NIGHT.
Clubs Will March to Woodward's Pavilion in a Column of Three
Divisions â Rockets, Music, Shells and Red Fire Will Signal
the Advance of the Multitude of Spectators.
IT was not contemplated nntil yesterday that a parade of Republican organizations should be a
feature of to-night's demonstration, but it was found that the zeal and enthusiasm of the clubs
could not be repressed. Club after club pressed forward, determined to march and shout for
Gage and Neff and Patton, whether authorized or not to form a general line. Late last night it was
decided to form the marching column into three divisions, as follows :
FIRST DIVISIONâ Union league Drill Corps; Army and Navy Republican League; Howard Club;
Fremont Club; Twenty-Eighth, Twenty-Ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-First, Thirty-Second, Thirty-Third and
Thirty-Fourth Assembly District Clubs.
SECOND DIVISION â Phoenix Club Drill Corps; Continental League; Olympia Club; Dewey Club; As
sociated League United Labor Clubs; Thirty-Fifth, Thirty-Sixth, Thirty-Seventh, Thirty-Eighth, Thirty-
Ninth and Fortieth Assembly District Clubs.
THIRD DIVISIONâ Bear Club Drill Corps; Young Men's Republican League; Harbor Club; Hobson
Club; Gage Republican Club; Argonaut Club; Forty -First, Forty-Second, Forty-Third, Forty-Fourth and
Forty-Fifth Assembly District Clubs.
There will be numerous bands of music, shells, rockets, flags and a brilliant display of red
fire. The column will move from Market and New Montgomery streets at 8 P. M. and march to
Woodward's Pavilion.
â¢ Efforts will be made to give the thousands of spectators a chance to see and cheer the
marching legion of confident Republicans.

DEVIL, AN EARTHLY LANDLORD.
There is only one spot on the earth's
surface that has actually been willed,
deeded and bequeathed to his Satanic
majesty. This spot lies four miles and
a half south of Helsingfors, Finland.
A few years ago Lara Huilariene died
in the little town of Pielisjarvi, in the
above-named country, leaving consid
erable property In the shape of landed
estate. How he had come into posses
sion of so much land no one seemed to
know, but as he was a very bad citizen
it was generally admitted that he was
In league with Wintahausu (Satan),
and that they had many business deals
with each other.
This somewhat startling opinion was
verified when on Huilariene was found
a certified warranty deed, giving to
Satan all his earthly possessions.
The will was to the same effect. The
family have repeatedly tried to break
the will, but so far have been unsuc
cessful. Thus the records plainly show
that his sulphuric majesty has a legal
right and title to some excellent
grounds in the near vicinity of Helsing
fors.
The simple people of the neighbor
hood have changed the course of the
road which for.nerly skirted the Huil
ariene homestead, and declare that they
would not enter the possessions of
Satan & Co. for all the money that the
three estates would bring. â Pearson's
Journal.

It now seems pretty generally conceded
that Fong Suey Wan, the procuress, is
on the high seas on her way to China,
and that it will be useless to eearch for
her in this State. It Is understood that
the Federal authorities have cabled to
Hongkong to arrest the woman on her
arrival at that port, but this report has
not been verified.
Harry Huff, the interpreter, whose
name has been mixed up disagreeably in
connection with the crooked work of the
bureau, denies that he brought to the
Presbyterian Mission thÂ» certificate of
residence of the woman. His denial Is
based on the truth, and he is entitled
to whatever benefit may accrue to him
from that fact. His connection with the
affair was related to a Call reporter yes
terday by Miss D. Cameron, matron
of the Presbyterian Chinese Home Mis
sion on Sacramento street.
"While Mr. Meredith and other mem
bers of the bureau were at the home here
examining the girls captured in the raid,"
said Miss Cameron, "one of our lady in
terpreters informed me that Harry Huff
was of the party, and she wanted to
know why he had been put on the raid.

Huff, and that is why we thought It

parlor where Mr. Meredith and the oth
ers were and I saw Mr. Huff with a pa
per in his hand. He was saying to Mr.
Meredith that Kong Suey's papers were
all right and that she be discharged. Mr.
Meredith was about to give the order, but
I informed him that I had two Chinese
women in the Mission who had identified
Fong Suey as the woman who had sold
them here, and that I wanted her to be
held and prosecuted for felony. Mr. Huff's
face, after I had made that statement,
was as black as a thundercloud, and Mr.
Meredith ordered that Fong Sitey should
be detained.
"I must say of Mr. Meredith," contin

to help us along in our work."

one of our far-famed productions is
rapidly disappearing; indeed, is al
most gone. We refer to the Rhode Isl

varieties of clam will be found in th-;
fish market. One is about one and a
half inches in length, or smaller; the
other three to four times that size, "i lie
smaller clam is the true Rhode Island
product, but the larger ones are Cape
Codders. They are as unlike In their
flavor as It is possible to imagine, but
both being sold and served here, the
unsophisticated credit them as alike

But, o%ving to the wicked, wasteful way
they have been dug, there are no large

FAMINE. IN RUSSIA.
The results of the harvest of this year
are now becoming known, and though
good in some southern districts a num
ber of governments have been acknowl
edged officially to have suffered from bad
crops and to require immediate assist
ance. The Minister of the Interior has
commissioned Count Tatishtcheff to make
a tour of inspection of the provinces
which are particularly in distress, name
ly, Kazanskaya, Samarskay, Ufim3
kaya, Vyatskaya, Simbirskaya. Saratov
skaya and Parmskaya, numbering a to
tal population of over 18,000,000. The Sa
mara Zemstvo (provincial assembly) is
petitioning the Government for a loan of
25,557,000 rubles for the purchase of seed,
etc., and for the maintenance of the
starving peasants. The Kazan Zemstvo
asks for a loan of 735,000 pounds of seed
needed immediately for sowing during this
autumn. The Menzelinskoo Zemstvo asks
for 3.000,000 rubles, etc. A correspondent
who happened to pass a vllage in the gov
ernment of Samara gives a heartrending
picture of what he saw in the locality,
and states that during one day of his
sojourn In that villlage no less than twen
ty-four sheep fell dead from lack of food
and that the people, too, look more dead
than alive. "This," he says, "is but one
of the numerous tragic panoramas which
I see everywhere, but the figure of that
woman, as she was imploring the starosta
(village elder) to ask the land-owner to
save ncr last cow, will haunt me all my
life."
Most of the affected provinces are the
same which suffered from the famine of
1891. Who is responsible for all thia
chronic misery and starvation? We have
already replied to the question in our
previous Issue, and have no hesitation in
repeating that at the bottom and root of
all Russian calamities lies the irrespon
ble autocracy of the Czar, who keeps the
people in ignorance and helplessness, for-,
bids evtn the or^n discussion of public
affairs, as plentifully illustrated in our
articles on the press, and thereby makes
the very first steps toward any improve
ment impossible.â Anglo-Russian.
THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SEA.
Sir John Murray's paper on the annual
range of temperature in the surface
waters of the ocean is published in the
last issue of the Geographical Journal,
and Is the latest as well as the most au
thoritative exposition of the subject. In
the course of it he says that the lowest
recorded temperature reading at the sur
face of the sea is 26 degrees Fahrenheit
in the North Atlantic, eastward of Nova
Scotia, and the highest reading in the
open ocean la 90 degrees Fahrenheit, re
corded in the tropical Pacific Loth north
and south of the equator, though -ea<V<ngs
of 94 and 96 degrees Fahrenheit are re
corded in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf
respectively.
The greatest known range of tempera
ture of the surface waters throughout
the whole world is thus 70 degrees Faren
heft (from 26 degrees to 96 degrees). He
goes on to show that the range of tem
perature has a very important effect in
bringing about a vertical circulation in
ocean waters. In the equatorial regions,
where there is hardly any variation in
surface temperature, the warm water re
mains at the surface and there relatively
cold water comes nearer to the surface
than in those regions in temperate zones
where there Is a wider daily and annual
range. The cooling of the surface layers
at night and during. winter in temperaLe
regions causes the salter water of tha
surface to sink through the underlying
layers, carrying with them heat and at'
mospheric gases to the greater deptha
The effect of freezing in the polar re
gions is in the end similar to that of evap
oration in warmer latitudes. The lighter
ice is separated from the denser mother
liquid which sinks to the greater depths,
leaving the ice on the surface. These
statements as to the effects of range of
temperature might be illustrated by ref
erence to many parts of the ocean.
It will be sufficient to refer to the most
striking example, in the southern hemi
sphere, where there Is a band of large
range of temperature right round the
world. The warm tropical waters, which
are driven southward along the eastern
coasts of South America, Africa and Aus
tralia into the Great Southern Ocean,
there become cooled as they flow to the
east before the strong westerly winds. On
account of their high salinity, these trop
ical waters can suffer much dilution with
Antarctic water and still be denser than
water from these higher latitudes at the
same temperature. Here the density ob
servations and the sea water gases indi
cate that a large part of the cold water
found at the greater depths of the ocean
probably leaves the surface and sinks
toward the bottom of the Southern Ocean
between the latitudes of 45 degrees and
66 degrees south. At a depth of 100 fath
oms the temperature in one part of the
ocean may differ from that to be found
In some other part at the same depth by
as much as 42 degrees Fahrenheit;
at 500 fathoms there may be be
tween one part and another a range
of as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit; at
1000 fathoms a range not exceeding 11 de
grees Fahrenheit, and at 1500 fathoms not
exceeding 8 degrees Fahrenheit. A con
sideration, however, of all the available
observations shows that there is no evi
dence of any annual variation of tem
perature at any one spot in the ocean
at a depth of 100 fathoms; and at a depth
of fifty fathoms no annual range greater
than 2 degrees Fahrenheit appears to be
Indicated. This remark applies especial
ly to the open ocean: but. although we
have no direct observations, still it is
most probable that along certain coasts
a wide range of temperature is occasion
ally "woduced at the bottom in depths of
fifty and even 100 fathoms, due to" the
lateral shifting of large bodies of water
from different sources. The evidence of
movements Hke these comes especially
from regions where polar and equatorial
currents meet or run alongside of each
other In different directions, as. for in
stance, in the case of the Gulf stream
and Labrador current oft the eastern
coasts of North America.
The plant known as vervain, which
is not distinguished for its beauty, and

THE GARBAGE
QUESTION AT
LAST SETTLED
Scavengers Are Still
to Collect.
CITY TO PAY CREMATORY
COMMITTEE OF SUPERVISORS
AGREES TO THE PLAN.
About One Hundred Thousand Dol
lars Saved From the Tax Levy
Which Will Be Devoted
to Other Purposes.
The vexed question of a city garbage
contract has at last been settled to the
fiut'sfaotion of the scavengers, ihe Sani
tary Reduction Company and tho Health
and Police Committee of the Boar-i of
Supervisors. It has been arranged that
the scavengers shall continue to ply their
avocation as of old, with this important
change, that the city will, in future, pay
the Sanitary Reduction Company for me
incineration of the garbage at the rate of
20 cents per cubic yard, while the scaven
gers will be obliged to reduce their
charges to the citizens to the basi-s of
rates prevailing before the inc.neration
plant was established.
For some time the scavengers have
been paying for the incineration at the
rate of 20 cents per cubic yarl and, In
turn, have collected extra money from
the citizens, to cover the expense.
At the meeting of the Health and Po
lice Committee of the Supervisors yester
day the new arrangement was made. The
Sanitary Reduction Company presented a
written proposition, stating that the j
works would be offered for lease to the !
city, but that the company womd favor- ;
ably conrider a contract for two >vars to '
incinerate all of the garbage at the rato
of 20 certs per cubic yard, tb.2 jitv to
pny for the same at the -jnd o' Â«-ac'i
mcith and the measurement uf the garb- ;
age to be in the hands of officers appoint- !
el by the Supervisors, instead of leaving 1
It to the scavengers as in the past.
This proposition suited the representa
tive 3 of the two rival garbage collecting
organizations present, and it v/as under- |
stoou to meet with the approval of the i
Merchants' Association. The Committee I
on Health and Police according! v vufd j
to adopt the arrangement and will recom- i
mend that a contract be entered into with â 
the SaiJtary Reduction Company. While j
no direct contract will be made wlrn tlio ;
ser/vengers, it is believed that they will
rsinily agree to keep down the prices of i
colltcting the garbage, especially its there
are rival organizations in the Held to bid
apainst each other for custom.

BED CROSS FETE TO-NIGHT.
Mechanics' Pavilion Its Seene â The
Society's Extensive Work.
A large benefit is to be given to the
San Francisco Red Cross at the Mechan
ics' Pavilion to-night, when the great
Spanish-American ball will be held. There
will be many features of interest. It is
to be a masquerade with many novel
and beautiful costumes, a grand march
and fancy Spanish dances. As the Red
Cross has not had a benefit for some time
now and the expenses are very heavy, it
is hoped the public will use this means of
re-enforcing the funds.
At the executive meeting the monthly
reports were submitted. The treasurer
reported the expenses were over $4000
more than the receipts, leaving on hand
$15,399 11.
On Saturday night the society will close
16 Post street and store what is necessary
at 404 Sutter street, where Hoppe <Jp Rob
ertson have kindly given a room, and Mr.
Walcom has offered his assistance in
every way possible.
Mrs. Lowenberg reported that after the
Newport sails the hospitality rooms at
the ferry will close, and that in all they
have entertained 81,428 soldiers.
Mrs. Looseley reported 10,648 names on
the membership roil.
Religion in Education.
Rabbi J. Nieto delivered a very interest
ing lecture on the subject, "The Influence
of Religion Upon Education," last even
ing. He said what we understood to-day
by education is not the accumulation of
much knowledge, but the result that may
reasonably be expected to accrue from
it to man. It is not the amount of infor
mation, but the effect that the possessing
of it exerts over the thoughts, sentimjents
and conduct of individuals and masses.

A Naval Hero's Story.
From the Times-Herald. Chlcaro, 111.
Late in 1861, when President Lincoln
Issued a call for volunteers, L. J. Clark of
Warren, Trumbull Co.. Ohio, was among
the first to respond. He joined the mortar
fleet of Admiral Porter just before the
memorable operations on the Mississippi
River began. It was at the terrific bom-
bardment of the Vlcksburg forts that the
hero of this story fell with a shattered
arm for a charge of shrapnel.
After painful months in the hospital, he
recovered sufficiently to be sent to his
home at Warren, Ohio. Another call for
troops fired his patriotic zeal and Clark
soon enlisted in Company H of the 7th
Ohio Volunteers. In the army of the Po-
tomac he was in many engagements. Be-
ing wounded in a skirmish near Richmond
he was sent to the hospital and thence
home.

BeVeral years ago Dr. Clark's old
wounds began to trouble him. He grew
weak and emaciated, and his friends de-

sufficiently to be out, but was a mere
shadow, weighing 1 only 90 pounds. The
best medical attendance failed to restore
his lost strength and vigor.
"A friend gave me a box of Dr. Wil-
