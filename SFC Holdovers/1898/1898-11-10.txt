VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO. 163.
JAMES D. PHELAN ELECTED MAYOR OF SAN
FRANCISCO BY THREE THOUSAND MAJORITY
A CLOSE CONTEST MARKED BY
CONDITIONS THAT ARE MAKING
MATTER FOR ADVERSE COMMENT
Voters Expressed a General Desire to Turn Out Present
Office Holders.
James D. Phelan will succeed
himself as Mayor of San Fran
cisco,
Such is the will of the majority
of the voters of this city as indi
cated by the count of the votes
cast at the election held Tuesday.
Whether or not this majority will
be lessened or wiped out by sub-
sequent counts or more complete
returns does not for the moment
matter. It is enough to know
that at the present time there is
nothing to show that the ultimate
result will be other than it now
appears â a victory for Mr. Phe
lan.
When the count was com
pleted last night, or practically
so, less than 3000 votes separ
ated the two contestants. This
being so, it is not strange that the
friends of Mr. Patton should
cling to the hope that some mis
take or omission has been made,
and that the events of the next
few days will reverse the situation
and put Mr. Phelan on the losing
end.
The counting of the vote on
the municipal ticket was a slow
and laborious proceeding, and
was not wholly completed at mid
night last night. During all of
the day yesterday thousands of
citizens thronged the streets in
front of the newspaper bulletin
boards where the returns of the
count were posted as soon as re
ceived. Gains that were noted for
either of the leading candidates
were greeted with cheers from
partisans among the. watchers,
and the progress of the count of

BOGUS BALLOTS
Looked for Fraud in Re
turns on the General
Ticket.
The old practices of Juggltng with elec
tion ballots, falsifying 1 reports and doc
toring the tally-sheets might have been
repeated yesterday if the most stringent
and preventive measures had not been
adopted. Early yesterday morning there
were indications of gross dereliction of
duty on the part of some election officers
and questionable conduct, in the withhold
ing of the State ballots on the purt of
others.
The first Intimation that things were
rot as they should be reached the Regis
trar's ears yesterday morning, and ne
cessitated a trip into y\e tenderUjio. Blggy
started and found that unless the utmost
circumspection were used there would be
a tampering with the ballots. He had no
sooner returned from this early morning
ride than he was called* Into the Thirty
eighth District. This time he went with
a patrol wagon and an escort of police.
What he found verified his fears.
Stretched out on the tables were the elec
tion officers In a state of intoxication, the
tallots practically untouched. .Mr. Bigey
ordered them trtrt ""affa" placed other men
In charge In order to secure a fair and
honest count. ,

votes for lesser lights on either
ticket was watched with interest
scarcely less intense.
Among politicians and those
who take a more active interest
in things political there was but
I one topic of conversation yester
j day. It was the great and re-
i markable discrepancy between
the vote given Maguire in this
city and that given to Phelaan.
1 Everywhere it was asserted that
; this result was brought about by
a trade made by Phelan's mana
gers at the last moment, in order
Ito avert certain defeat. In other
words, it was asserted that the
men who managed Phelan's cam
1 paign sacrificed James G. Ma
guire, the Democratic guberna
â  torial candidate, and James H.
I Barry, the Democratic candidate
! for Congress in the Fourth Con
gressional District, in order to
i save Mr. Phelan. This was done,
! it is alleged, by trading blocks of
â¢ Phelan votes to Gage and Kahn
, in return for a like number of Re
! publican votes to be cast for Phe
i lan. In this way, it is asserted,
', Mr. Phelan's managers succeed
; ed in changing the result suffi
; ciently to compass the defeat of
: Mr. Patton.
This method of "doing" poli
tics is not a new one, but it is so
reprehensible that the most cor
rupt and unscrupulous bosses
hesitate to resort to it except un
der the most pressing and desper
ate circumstances. It is consid-
ered, and rightly so, the basest
kind of treachery, and is a crimi
nal attempt to influence the
true will of the people. As such
LIEUTENTANT-GOVERNOR NEFF ON THE ELECTION.
Ab I look at It, the unfair manner in which the Democrats attacked
the candidates on the Republican State ticket is what led to the latter's
wonderful victory in the State. The people were disgusted with the con
tinual howling on the railroad question, as they were fully convinced that
it was not an issue in this campaign, that question having been settled by
the late Congress, in which all partiesâ Populists, Democrats and Re
publicansâJoined. As regards the Populists, It is self-evident that they
were not pleased with the manner In which they were treated by the
Democrats, and that fusion was a failure. This was evident when such
leaders as Mr. Webster, Mr. Shanahan and others of the Populist party
deserted the so-called fusion ticket, and when also the Silver Republicans
to a iarge extent refused to support it. j. H. NEFF

ties. Three separate deputations of men
In hacks were sent out to round up the
State count. Ignorance of what their du
ties were was the cause In several pre
cincts of the non-return of the ballots.
In other precincts, some of which Mr.
Biggy visited himself, it was not ignor
ance, but corrupt Influence that prevented
a proper return of the State tally sheet
and votes. Mr. Biggy was told to mind
his own' business in one precinct south of
Market street, and only obtained the bal
lots after full exercise of his authority.
It Is probable that had not the interfer
ence of the police been threatened in sev-
e ral cases gross fraud would have been
perpetrated. The returns came in rap

it is more reprehensible than the
outright purchase of votes with
cold cash.
How .much truth there is in
i these charges that are being so
freely made may never be known,
but it is certain that intelligent
citizens will scan the election re
turns, compare the vote given
! Maguire and that given Phelan,
J and then draw their own conclu
! sions. In the same connection
; they will consider the ante-elec
tion effort of Mr. Phelan's mana
gers to trade the party organiza
| tion and the party patronage to
| Rainey and Harney in return for
their support. That attempt was
a base betrayal of personal and
party friends. All things consid
i ered, the contest just closed will
no doubt leave a lasting taint of
bad feeling between all who have
been interested in it on the Dem
i ocratic side.
As to the offices other than
that of Mayor there seems to
have been a desire on the part. of
a majority of the voters to defeat
the men who now hold office and
to give their places to those who
have not been in the public ser
j vice. There were exceptional in
stances, particularly on the Dem
ocratic side, where the private
character of aspirants to office
was of a nature to cause the ma
jority of voters to scratch their
names in the voting booths.

Concerning the trouble over withheld
returns Registrar Biggy said:
"The trouble that has happened over
the returns from south of Market street
districts I predicted when the Election
Commissioners set aside my decision to
abide by the . act of 1878 . and choose the
election officers from among those who
are on the assessment roll.
"When this campaign started I made up
my mind that only by selecting our offi
cers from among property owners could
we get straight election boards, and this
plan I talked over with Major McLaugh
lin and Mr. Alford of the Republican and
Democratic State Committees. v

promised their support, but the Commis

MAYOR-ELECT JAMES D. PHELAN.
MAYOR JAMES D. PHELAN ON HIS ELECTION.
The campaign has been an active one, and of my own candidacy I have but little to say. I consider
my election an approval of the charter reform movement by the people, who desire the speedy ratification of
the new organic law. I also feel that my attitude toward the quasi-public corporations is emphatically in
dorsed. I regTet that other officers, whose public services warranted recognition, have been lost in the wave of
approval which the people have endeavored to express of the war policy of the President.
The charter will no doubt be now ratified, and under it municipal affairs by separate elections will be di
vorced from the unholy connection heretofore maintained with partisan politics.
required of election officers was a politi
cal pull, and last night I had to carry a
whole patrol wagon of new election offi
cers down into thÂ« tenderloin to take the
places of men whom we found in all
stages of Intoxication, their ballots lying
untouched before them.
"In a number of other booths I was
obliged to stop the count until watchers
forWh parties were brought In to see
that the count was straight, and to-day I
have had to send police and deputies out
to force election officers to send in re
turns on the State ticket. In some pre
rlncts they were drunk; in others they
flatly refused, and I want to tell you that
I'll have those returns In to-night or some
one will go up for it.
â¢â¢When I took this office it was with the
Dromise exacted by myself, that I should
Se free from political pulls and influence,
and I have bee n. I put my deputies in
wause they were competent and for no
other consideration. f Immediately set
about systematizing affairs so that I
soon had personal control of everything,
and in doing so made myself personally
responsible for the office's proper conduct.
TTnr this reason this delay In local returns

present campaign that has a crooked as-
P "This campaign has been the cleanest
that we have had for years, though the
flsrht has been a hot one. Even If crook
edness had been contemplated.. I Â don't
think' it would have been possible with
the safeguards that I have thrown around
the ballot-box. The sniffers and strikers
have had no chance. The lodrlng-house
registration this year was only . 500, as
against 2000 and 2500 in previous years.^
"The Blip system of . registration that I
inaugurated knocked tliat. WbÂ«n * man
came into the office to register he left
behind him a slip with his district, his
precinct, name and general description.
These slips we put in blocks and then
started men out to investigate them. The
result of it was that the lodging-house
vote was unusually small â and it was. a
straight one.
"You can't tell me," said Mr. Biggy.
"that these returns are necessarily de
layed. I am afraid now, and have been
since last night when I found out how
things were going, that in some districts
the g-ood old Recount,' that was so much
in fashion a few years ago, is to be at
tempted In this election. I have been
afraid that these boxes would be car
ried into some alley or restaurant and
fixed up to suit, and it has been taking
all my attention. It means nothing but
fraud when returns are delayed in this
way. and I propose to bring them in if
the law and the police can do it. There
shall be no election frauds under my ad
ministration if I can help it.
"I would have been spared this worry,

To This Class Dr. Washington
Dodge, Assessor, Declares
Is Due His Success.
Dr. Washington Dodge, the successful
candidate for Assessor, was a very happy
but a very tired representative of the
Democratic party last evening after there
were enough favorable returns brought
from the various voting places to insure
his election. He went to his home
early, but not before speaking of the
campaign and why he believed he had se
cured more votes than his opponent,
John D. Siebe.
Dr. Dodge was asked the question:
"To what do you attribute your success
in this election, when so many of your
party have been defeated?" The Asses
sor-elect let his thoughts run over the
events of the past few weeks before an
swering, and then said: "There were two
principal factors â¢In my. election. - One is
that my friends worked day and night in

the past did not do him any good In this
election."
"In what manner did his official con
duct affect the small property owners,
that you speak of?" was asked of Dr.
Dodge.
The answer was not direct, as he said:
"When my friends and I were watching
the returns I would sometimes be a little
discouraged at the small consideration I
received at the hands of those who live
in the fine big houses on Pacific Heights
and In the Western Addition, where Mr.
Siebe seemed to be well liked. 'Never
mind,' said my friends, 'wait until the re
turns come In from the people In the val
leys who have only small holdings. Bee
what they think of your opponent.' True
enough. I found that these people gave
me their entire support, and in this city

majority, when it comes to voting. Then,

Major Frank Mclaughlin Tells of,

BY ALICE RIX.
"I'll see," said the little boy at the
door, "if Major MeLaughlin is in."
He went away and loft me in the re
ception room of the Republican State
Central Committee at the Palace Hotel
âa room littered with bits of paper,
torn envelopes, mutilated election
tickets, cigar ashes. cig-ar butts and
men with their hats on. When he
came back Major JlcLaughlin came
with him.
"Ah!" said tho major, with his hand
some bow. "You'll excuse our house
keeping. At the close of the battle, you
know, you can't expect to find the
field quite clear." He opened the door
into another room. "It's better," he
said, "in here."
"la it?" I said, looking in.
"Dear me," said the major, "it isn't,
is it?"
"Maybe it's quieter," I suggested
civilly.
"Yep," said the major, looking re
lieved, "it is quieter. And, as for ap
pearances, as I say, you know after a
great battle â "

stepping over a pile of papers on the
floor. They had been dropped there
carelessly, cartoons out, and I could
see. here and there, the trunk or the

answered the major, laughing con
tentedly. "Looks like a good deal of

yet why say wasted? Every ?hnt that

as I might say, in our cause."
"Yes? How do you make that out?"
"Why," said the major suavely, "you
know only the truth counts in politics."
"No, I didn't know. Isn't that a
rather new theory?"
"Not with mo," said the major, "not
with me. Truth and hard work are my
political principles."
"Well, everybody is bound to admit
that jour political principles succeed.
Bo that is the way you make Presidents
and Governors and Kings, is it?"
"I?" said the major modestly, waving
a deprecating hand with a large dia
mond glittering on the littla linger.
"Don't you mean the Republican
party?"
"I don't know that I do," I replied.
"Somebody has to drive the elephant.
Who does that?"
"There's the State Central Commit
tee," murmured the major, "and the
executive committee and our stirring
Republican orators, our spell-binders,
General Barnes and George Knightâ
our old reliables, they are â and among
the younger men. Colonel Eddy and
Major Kyle and Mr. D. E. McKinliyâ
they've done magnificent work! Then

could gr> on naming any number of
men â "
"Thanks, never mind! I couldn't pos
pibly remember any more. Besides, I'm
more interested in you just now. "What
did you do?"
"Well," said the major, slowly, "I bf
lieve I kept up the organization. I
ought," he added, pausing, "to say we
kept it up. This campaign was merely
a continuation of the campaign of '9(5.
In larg.? Eastern centers, where poli
tics a;v played scientifically like a
game of chess, the party goes on from
one campaign to another perfecting
the machinery. In California the inter
est nearly always has been permitted to
die out. Now I made up mv mind t<Â»
work against that waning of interest.
I have gone on perfecting the machin
ery of our party, corresponding with
committees In the different counties,
supplying them with campaign litera
tureâin a word, keeping the party
spirit alive. Then Iâ or I should say
we â have aided in furthering the po
litical ambitions of their constituents,
bringing their cases before our Sen
ator â "
"Putting them under obligations, as
it were?"'
"Ye-es â well, say rewarding the

speakers wore all tremendously suc

one of the best vote-getters in the
party. He's been before it so long, you
know, he has its confidence. Commu
nities have to be educated up to re
specting the younsrer men, but Perkins
and Barnes and Knight are stand-bys
through every campaign. We had â let
me see â " and the major patted his
well-kept hands thoughtful!^ together;
"we had over eight hundred speeches
delivered during the campaign. And we
spent a great deal of money. We
had to gro out and beg for it, too. Don't
forget that, now. Our late friend, the
enemy there," and the major kicked a
well-shod foot In the direction of the
fallen cartoons, "our dear conquered
foe was wont to loudly scream that we
had unlimited gold at our command
from the railroad, you know, and also
from the Eastâ the mystical East,
which is supposed to rain gold every
now and then into the other party's
hands. Why, if we had had all tho
money we were credited with," and the
cvajnr smiled a meaning smile, "we
would have swept the Ftata clean of
Democrats."
"Then the Republicans are not so
liberal?"
"I am afraid that is the rock ahead
on which the Republican party may
split. San Francisco is getting tired
of being the political wetnuree of the
State. The idea that this committee was
fairly rolling in Wealth became very
popular and we were expected by all
the other counties to provide the sinews
of war. Even new members of this
committee wore bitten by the idea.
Whenever a question of expense came
up I could see the covert glance ex
changed in expectation of seeing the
magic sack brought out of a corner
and deposited on the table in full view.
It was only when it was explained to
them that they had to get out and beg
that they took a clearer view of the
situation."
"And did they do it?"
"What, get out and beg? Yes they
did, manfully.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALT,, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1898.
"Women do that part of It rather
well, don't they?"
The major shook his head. "I rather
like to be thought gallant," he said, con
fidingly, "but do you know I've lost my
reputation in this campaign? I would
not have a woman come into it. Last
year â " and the major cast his eyes
piously to heavenâ "Good Lord deliver
us!" he said. "They nÂ°arly drove me
mad! They talked prohibition to p&loon
men and railed against the Pope to
Catholics and brought Jew and Gen
tile both about my ears. This year I
told the bey at the committee room
door to keep them out. I cautioned him
to be polite but firm. I can't refuse
them myself," added the major inno
cently, "and it wouldn't be wise either.
There is a great amount of bunkoing in
this game of politics. You have to
smile and look pleasant to everybody
and then go into your closet and tear
down the telephone two or three times
a day to relieve your feelings. I am
nearly exhausted" â and the major
stretched his splendid proportions in
candid weariness.
"Well," I said, rising, "I'm going
now."
"Oh," said the major, gallantly,
"don't. I was speaking generally, you
know."
"Yes, I know. Tell me in parting are
you going to be United States Sen
ator?"
"Never." said the major, "never. I
take up politics to-day as I would have
shouldered a musket in '60-61 â because
it is a man's duty to defend his country
agninst its enemies. I seek no office and
I would accept no nomination, but I
don't mind telling you." and the major
dropped his voice, "I've been taken up
into high places and tempted."
HENRY MARTIN WILL
KEEP HIS PROMISES
The Falstafflan Sheriff Will Faith
fully Serve the People Who
Elected Him.
Henry Martin, Sheriff-elect of this
county, feels deeply grateful to the peo
ple of San Francisco for their confidence
in having elected him to that important
office. When seen last night the man of
Falstaffian proportions said: "I am
highly elated o\'er my success for the rea
son that I owe It mainly to the hard
work and unceasing efforts of my friends
in my cause. I do not w'sh to appear
egotistical, but I believe that not many
men are blessed with more or better
friends than myself, and this fact has
stood me in good stead. Another cause
which undoubtedly aided mo was the
superior organization of the Republican
party, in itself no small factor in an elec
tion contest. Then again, enthusiasm for
our gallant standard-bearer, Henry T.
Gage, materially enhanced my chances.
In relating the causes of my election I
must not forget The Call, which really
performed wondrous work in my behalf.
"The contest throughout was agreeably
conducted, and as to my opponent I will
say that had I been defeated it would
have been by a thorough gentleman in
every sense of the word. He is ex
tremely popular, but tho causes I have
mentioned conspired to turn the tide
against him.
"I did not enter public life for any gain
attached thereto. I honestly believe that
it is the duty of every man to serve the
people who place faith in him, and any
man should consider it a great honor.
"I can only promise what I have reiter
ated all through the campaign: I will en
deavor to discharge the duties of the im
portant office to which the people have
elected me to the best of my ability, and
should I make any mistakes the fault
will be one of the head and not the heart.
Again 1 thank all my friends who have
assisted me in this contest, and can onWr
assure them that they have my unbouna
ed gratitude."

CONGRESSMAN-ELECT EUGENE F. LOUD.
My own success in the past campaign came from the same causes
that insured the success of the Republican ticket. Firstâ The people
are tired of this persistent cry of -the opposition that conditions must
be completely overturned and that all business interests should be
subservient to agrarian sentiment. Secondâ Satisfaction with the
splendid administration of President William McKinley, a sentiment
which drew largely from the conservative, patriotic Democrats.
Nine-tenths of our people believe that the policy of the present ad
ministration is both wise and conservative and for the best interests
cf the people.
Personally, I am satisfied that the majority of the people, partic
ularly outside those who have been disappointed in not securing pub
lic office, believe my general course has been for the best interests of
the people at large. My majority in Santa Clara County is about fifteen
hundred greater than it was two years ago. This probably demon
strates that the people in that county have seen the benefit of Re
publican legislation, particularly in the direction of a reasonable pro
tection to their large fruit interests. The people are now in a posi
tion to make comparisons between the years 1894-95-96 and 1898, and
everything is favorable to the latter.
The people of California are satisfied that Republican success
means an era of better times to this State, as they can be assured
that such success means a continuation of the wise and conservative
policy of President McKinley.
good order. Plantation owners and ha
oiendados are afraid to commence work
while affairs remain In this condition.
The American Congress responded to the
world for the preservation of peace and
order, and I have faith in that promise.
Since the. protocol has been signed be
tween the United States and Spain and
American troo f pÂ« Sire beginning to occupy
the country there is no necessity for an
army, and the quicker the men return to
their occupations the sooner _ Cuba will
recover her normal condition."
A commission will be selected to go to
Washington to lay the situation before
President MeKlnley. so that, if possible,
seme action may be taken by the United
States to relieve the situation. General
Calixto Garcia will probably be chairman,

A HORSE THAT WAS RUDE.
A funny thing happened at the corner
of Ridge avenue and Twelfth street yes
terday about noon. A patient old horse
was standing close to the sidewalk in the
shaft of a truck wagon, with his soft old
nose turned toward the door of the house
at which his master was doing a little
bargaining as to the price of cabbages.
About this time a man walked up and
Just brushed the horse's nose with his
sleeve. "I beg your pardon," he said, po
litely, "but would you direct me to
Twelfth street?" Whether the old quad
ruped knew that he was standing on that
thoroughfare or not, he made no reply.
The man repeated the question, with the
same result. He then got angry, and the
amusement of the passers-by could not
be suppressed when he addressed the
quiet old horse thus: "Well, you'ro the
most ill-mannered beast I've met in a
long time, to refuse to direct a blind man
along the street." Then the truck dealer
came along, and, apologizing for the rude
ness of his horse, put the blind man in the
way he wanted to go.â Philadelphia Press.
THE SUNSET WAS NOT NATURAL.
That same evening we walked down
to the lake and witnessed one of the
most glorious sunsets I have ever seen.

feathery clouds of red with their silver
edges were something beyond descrip

CHEAP POSTAGE TO ENGLAND.
Letter to the editor of the London
Times.
The telegram stating the desire of the
American Government to inaugurate
penny postage, with England will be read
with Kener.il satisfaction. It is only
right that this great branch of the Eng
iMn-speaklng race of the world should not
delay in joining us in this new departure
as you predicted in your leading a -tide
a few weeks ago.
It frees me from considerable em
barrassment because for pome time to
come New York must be the port for
Canada., and our enemies did not fail to
point out the difficulty and even absurdity
of establishing penny postage with
Canada and twopenny-halfpenny postage
with the United Statesâ through which
country our English letters would have to
pass to Canada.
Those of our friends who said they
would only support me if I confined my
efforts to "obtaining imperial penny post
age were not aware that (in my opinion)
there are more British-born subjects in
the I'nited States than in Canada, Aus
tralia and Africa.
At all events, these figures are worthy
of consideration; Total number of letters
sent from the United Kingdom to the
I'nited States last year. 11.600,000; total
number sent to the colonies of Aus
tral, isia. Canada and Africa last year
from the I'nited Kingdom, 10,880.000.
It is curious, too, to notice that the esti
mated loss to tho British Government by
the establishment of penny postage to
America will amount to exactly the same
sum as that to be incurred by the estab
lishment of imperial penny postage â viz.,
about Â£75,000 for the first year. I have
calculated a loss of lV*d per letter on
12.000.000 letters.
The whole of this money could be saved
if the postal authorities would have the
courage to put on a sensible foundation
the question of the cost of carriage of the
mails to America. We paid last year
Â£108,000 for the service. Thirty thousand
pounds would have been ample.
The cost of a first-class passage to
America, including cabin accommodation
and food, is Â£20. The charge for convey
ing the same weight of letters as the pas
senger weighs is Â£37 10s. The cost of
conveying an equal weight of newspapers
is about Â£3. I commend this problem to
thÂ«> attention of our excellent man of
business, the Postmaster General.

The people of the State of California have spoken. They have

As for myself. I shall stand with the President in his policy of

THE CITY'S VOTE
ON STATE AFFAIRS
Result of the Canvass of All But
Nineteen Precincts.
THE r turns on the State ticket
this morning are complete from
282 out of the 303 city precincts,
leaving 19 unaccounted for. There
has been b.ut little change in the
positions of the candidates, although
some have snatched victory from de
feat and some are so perilously near
losing that the missing nineteen pre
cincts may mean their political life or
death.
Gage has increased his plurality to
3926.
Mulholland for Surveyor General
climbed up over 6000 votes, but Wright
still maintains a commanding. lead. In
the race for State Treasurer Reeves
and Green are in the same relative do
sitions, Reeves leading by over 3000.
For Clerk of the Supreme Court Root
has Increased his lead over McCraney
to 10,000. Woodman and Johnston are
still running about 2000 apart, Johnston
leading.
The Justices of the Supreme Court
are in the same relative position, Con
ley and Van Dyke leading.
Barry has crawled up a little, but is
still hopelessly behind, and Loud has
increased his lead of 1000 over Craig.
Dunn for the Board of Equalization
pulled up Edwards' lead of 1400 and
now leads by over 200. Hinton is near
ly 2000 behind Laumeister.
Among Assemblymen there have been
but two changes. In the Twenty
eighth Hoey has a small lead and in
the Thirty-ninth Wardell is four ahead
of Jones. Among the Senators Hoey
has passed Twigr*. Burnett still leads
McCormick, Bettman holds his own
and Ashe wins by 20 votes.
The Assemblyman from the Twenty
eighth is not so certain as the figures
following make it appear. The figures
of the newspapers' election bureau
were: Carpenter, S. L... 190; Graham, R.,
840; Hoey, D., 790. The figures from the
Registrar's office were: Carpenter, 190;
Graham, 933; Hoey, 973. By the one
Hoey wins, by the other Graham. In
the tables given here the Registrar's
count, being nearer official, has been
taken. The count will be investigated.

Phelan Thanked the People.
Mayor Phelan drove down Market street
last evening, and arriving at the Phelan
building alighted and addressed a large
number of people who had gathered and
were cheering him. He thanked every
body for the support they had rendered
him on Tuesday, and promised them a
good administration, the outlines of which
could be found in his policy of the past.
The speech was brief, and was heard by
few people as the Mayor stood among
them. To correct this, he appeared on
one of the balconies of the building, and
from this point was distinctly heard and
cheered. A band which accompanied him
played several selections, and the crowd
then dispersed.
Unreliable Counts.
There were persistent rumors of crooked
work in the First Precinct of the Thirty
fourth District, iocated at 112 Mason
street, yesterday. It Is said that the re
quired number of election officers were
not present at all times and that the vot
ing was conducted on Tuesday with two
men short. According to reports a num
ber of mistakes have been made In the
counting of the ballots and it is likely that
some one will test the validity of the elec
tion in that preclnctr

INDIAN NATURAL HISTORY.
It was a good many years ago that old
Hugh Monroe, who for more than seven
ty-five years had traveled the prairies of
the Northwest, told me that once he had
found a bird's nest in the thick hair be
tween the horns of a buffalo bull that he
had killed. He had two Indians with him
and had killed the young bull, which the
Indians were beginning to skin and cut
up, and while they were doing this he
plucked some of the long hair from the
forehead to use in wiping out his gun.
As he reached down and grasped the hair
a little birdâ a little gray bird â flew out
from under his hand and away. Parting
the hair to see whence it had come, he
found a round, smooth nest, containing
four little young birds. He could not tell
me what kind or a bird it was.
Not many weeks ago, when I was sit
ting in the lodge with my Indian father
and elder brothers, principal chiefs of tne
Blackfeet, I spoke of this tale that had
been told me, and learned that all who
were present had heard of Just this thing.
On-esta-pokau, the "White Calf, had
known or one case of this kind where the
bird was a blackbird; but this he had not
seen himself.
Once, however, he did see the nest of a
"snow bird." containing four eggs, be
tween the horns of a bull. Inquiry, fol
lowed by a careful and detailed descrip
tion, showed that the bird which the
Blackfeet call "snow bird" la the prairie
shore lark.
After we had talked about this for some
time, E-kus-klni, the Low Horn, said to
me: 'My friend, I will now tell you some
thing. Do you know that Neo-po-mukl
counts the months of the winter on his
tongue?"
"No," I said. "I know Xoo-po-muki. but
I do not know what you mean by counting
the moiiths of the winter on his tongue.
"This is it," said L*>w Horn. "In spring
if you kill one and open his mouth and nft
up his tongue you will find under the
tongue five other tongues, one tongue for
each month of the winter. In the fall he
does not have these extra tongues. Ido
not know why he has them nor what it
means."
Neo-po-muki is the chickadee, and he is
so called from his cry: for be says always
"Summer is comingâ suimner is coming."
â George Bird Grinnell, in Forest and
Stream.
IN AN OLD FRENCH TOWN.
The very name of the hotel at which
the traveler alights will help to roster the
illusion that he has put not only miles,
but centuries, between himself and his
ordinary surroundings. Its sign, de la
Haute Mere Dieu or de l'lmage, carries
him back to the days when men relied
for safety in their journeys rather on tho
hand of an unseen protector than on the
latest sanitary patent of Jennings. So,
too, the names of the streets serve to
strengthen the same impression. Here
he can sip honey with. the Bourdon blanc,
caper with the Chevres qul dansent, car
acole on his destrier by the side of
Quatre Ills d'Aymon, hunt Huguenots la
the Hue dcs Renards, or make the best
of both worlds with the Chapeauv Vio
lettes.
The houses that rise on either side of
these quaintly named and tortuous streets
are in keeping with the old world at
mosphere. They belong to every age and
every style. Here is one with high
pitched roof and timbered front, its three
stories jutting out one above the other,
like an inverted staircase. Another, dec
orated with the broken escutcheon of
some noble family, fascinates the passer
by with the grotesque figures into which
its joists are carved, or that grimace
from the gable ends. On the door of a
third huge nails* trace mysterious hier
oglyphs, some Protestant's confession j)t
faith, or some Leaguer's curse on Henri
Quatre. A fourth, of less ambitious type,
bears upon its front the symbols of a
burgher's noblesse de la cloche. A iirth,
standing back a few paces from the
street, with a stone paved courtyard,
where pigeons are wooing with all the
formal courtesies of Sir Charles Grandi
son, has an iron gateway, worked in the
style of Louis XV, with marvelous in
terlaced branches, the masterpiece of
some unknown Jean Lamour.â The Nine
teenth Century.
GENIUS A "SPORT."
Through all time men of genius have
scoffed at and have ridiculed the at
tempts of purse proud old "richesse" to
create superior orders of manhood. Nor
is this a matter for wonder; they were
and are ridiculous. Yet these attempts
are repeated every hour. Considering
them one would suppose that wealth
titles, dignities are talismans which In
sure virtue and honor and personal worth
and beauty in those to whom they de
scend. Talismans are ridiculous, and so
are titles. Nobility is of blood and not of
garters, royal sponsors and christening
robes. Pedigrees, portraits and family
history, when truthful, tell us a great deal
about the nobility of a race. Titles, quar
terings, and patents are worthless; and
the production of a great genius is, in
general, as bad a sign as the production
of a great profligate. Races that produce
geniuses should be avoided; the best is
the second best â the normal.
Genius, as some one (Victor Hugo, I
think) has finely said, is a promontory
stretching out into the ocean of the infi
nite. Look for the descendants of Shake
speare, Bacon, Macaulay, Wellington,
Nelson, Gibbon, Swift, Voltaire, Carlyle,
Bonaparte, Goldsmith, Spencer, Milton,
Cromwell, Disraeli â to take a few names
at random.. and you will find that they
are not. For the genius is always a trans
gressor of the normal â a "sport.'s' He is
never symmetrical. Such a one nature
likes not, and she makes provision for the
extinction of the race. â The Humanita
rian.
PARLIAMENTARY HISTORY.
The privilege of freedom from arrest en
joyed by members Parliament is confined
to civil matters; but, since the abolition
of imprisonment for debt, this immunity
has been shorn of most of its utility.
Formerly it was a very useful privilege.
Disraeli says of one of the characters in
his first, novel, "Vivian Grey," that "the
only way to keep him out of the House of
Correction was to get him into the House
of Commons." Parliament was then a
convenient haven of refuge for "splendid
paupers." There are three at least well
authenticated instances on record of mem
bers who got elected to the House of
Commons in order to escape the conse
quences of their heavy liabilities.
In one case an Enlish member named
Mills, who owed Â£23,000 and for whose ar
rest a warrant was in the hands of the
Sheriff, avoided Imprisonment by pur
chasing a seat for one of the old "rotten
boroughs," in 1807, for the sum of Â£1000.
In another case an Irishman named
Bourke was confined in the King's Bench,
Prison, about seventy years ago, in exe
cution for a considerable debt. His friends
got him elected for an Irish constituency,
but he never entered the House. On his
release after election he fled to the Con
tinent and remained there. Again, in
1825, the year before Disraeli published
"Vivian Grey," a man who was in prison
for debt was returned from Bererley, a
small English borough, and was forth
with released on a %-arrant issued by Mr.
Speaker. It was a case, in real life, or
from the House of Correction to tha
House of Commons.â Good Words.
SIB COLIN CAMPBELL.
Russian horsemen were coming on fast,
and a grim silence fell on the High
landers. Then, as the beat of the hostile
troops sounded deeper and louder, a curi
ous quiver ran down the long two-deep
line of the Ninety-third. The men were
eager to run forward and charge.
"Ninety-third, Ninety-third," rang out
the fierce voice of Sir Colin Campbell,
â¢â¢(j all that eagerness!" He had pre
viously ridden down the line and told his
soldiers. "Remember, there is no retreat
from here, men. You must die where you
stand." And from the kilted privates
came the cheerful answer, "Aye, aye. Sir
Colin; we'll do that." The Russians were
now within range, and the fire of the
Highlanders rang out sudden and sharp.
A few horses and men came tumbling
down, and the Russian cavalry wheeled
instantly to the left, threatening the right
flank of the Highlanders. Campbell, a
cool and keen soldier, saw the skill of
this movement. "Shadwell." he said,
turning to his aid-de-camp, "that man
understands his business." So, too, did
Campbell, who instantly deflected his linÃ
so as to protect his right and met the
advance with a destructive volley, before
which the Russian horsemen at once fell
bacvk.â Cornhill Magazine.
A BELATED SEQUEL.
It happened one day subsequently that
the two Governors met in a drug store.
The Governor of North Carolina re
marked to the Governor of South Caro
lina: , , Â,
"It's a long time between winks!
Whereupon they approached the soda
water counter and the Governor of South
Carolina winked at the young man behind
it.â Chicago Tribune.

many of the schemes that brought ruin !
to his affairs and dishonor to his name. j
After the old man fled from this city j
every effort was made to show that he j
knew nothing of the transactions that i
were bringing the banks to destruc- ;
tioii. - â¢
The Call has shows that Dr. McDon
ald knew everything that his sons were
doing In this city and gave his entire
support to their action. He command
ed them to keep Â«him free from any
persona! responsibility and to place his !
private fortune in such a position that j
no creditors of the banks could attach i
it or seize it. He deliberately and
shamelessly commanded the gigantic
theft of 1142,900. He demanded and re
ceived dishonestly several thousands of
dollars more for his own personal, prl- I
vate needs. He blackguarded his sons, !
his brothers and his friends. With j
abusive criticism he denounced every- j
body connerted with the banks and not
content with deceiving the authorities
â¢he planned what was practically the
last robbery of the funds of the Peo
ple's Bank.
In the letters published this morning
The Call will show that Dr. McDonald
secured for his own benefit a great for
tune in stocks and bonds that he had
given to his daughter. These securi
ties .lid not belong to him and right
fully do not belong to him now, but
since the failure of the institution of
which he was president he has been
enjoying the financial benefit of these
properties.
Many of the letters of the old man
are deeply pathetic. In one of the
epistles he t*lls his sons sadly how he
feels that the end is gradually ap
proaching and he must face his God.
In preparation for this terrible ordeal
he settled his worldly affairs, made his
v.ill. returned to the duties of religion
and commanded his son Richard to
steal ten thousand dollars more before
the doors of the bank closed. There is
possibly no sadder Instance of the
hypocrisy of old age than this old man
believing himself on the verge of the
grave and using the authority of a pa
rent to command a son to the commis
sion of a crime.
In his concluding letters Dr. McDon
ald criticized D. S. Dorn and Moses H.
Sherman unsparingly. The opinions of
the aged critic in reference to I. W.
Hellman and Daniel Meyer will be
found not uninteresting. His caustic
abuse of his brothers James and Jas
per adds a peculiar feature of Interest
to the story. - His command that he
shall not be caught in a trap and that
no possible vestige of fraud be left for
the detection- of scrutinizing eyes make
a fitting climax to the dramatic recital.
THE OLD MAN'S LIFE CLOSING IN
SHIPWRECK AND DARKNESS.
In the early part of 1653 Dr. McDon
ald believed that his life was near its
close. â¢ The old man wrote to his sons
and told them that It was his wish to
â wind up his earthly affairs and prepare
for death.- He counseled them what to
do and how to act, and informed them
that he had drawn and executed his
â will. With a cry of despair he declared
that his lung life was ending In ship
wreck and darkness. Excerpts from
his letter are as follows:
ASTOR HOUSE. N. V., Jr.n. 28, 1893.
My Dear Sons Frank and Richard:

fcinninsr. of the end of my life as never

"CAPTAIN JIM" AND THE DONAHUE
RAiLROAD.
On March 14, 1893, R. H, McDonald
Sr. in a letter to his son Richard paid
his compliments to his brother. Captain
Jim McDonald, and what the old man
chose to tvJ the blackmailing Bank
Commissioners. Incidentally Dr. Mc-
Donald uttered a few caustic comments
on the Donahue railroad. Excerpts
from the letter are as follows:
NEW YORK. March 14. 1893.
My Dear Son R. H. McDonald Jr.:
You say your uncle J. loaned Foster
$25,000, which you paid him from the
bank to go into the Donohue railroad
in some form or another. If he is not
careful he will be mixed up in that
affair in some way greatly to his loss.
That Donohue road has been bobbing
around for sale to first one party and
then another, and I am Inclined to the
opinion that it is a good thing to let
alone. -
Otherwise railroad men would have
had it in their possession lung ago. It
might bs a good thing for you to say
to Uncle James_Jie had better let th*e
whole thing alone or he wili be very
apt to lose money and be greatly an
noyed if he touches it. Truly James
is in a forlorn and hopeless condition,
and I have little hope of its ever be
ing better but continuously worse with
him wherever he is In the. world. I
did what I could from his earliest boy
hood up to Sjlb time to train him In
the right direction that he may never
become as he is. but with the odds of
a dissipated father and such training
on the subject of temperance he has
reached the point he lias.
And now each and all of those who
should have helped me in this direc
tion have withdrawn all assistance In
this hour of need, and I alone am left
to help him now and then In his great
est necessity. The blackmailing Bank
Commissioners will have their day,
and I hope have done their worst. The
insults or the captain depend from day
to day on the amount of alcoholic li
quors he has in his body, and what
cannot be helped must be borne.
When he fully understands that he is
a full partner in that institution it
may and probably will modify his con
duct no little, as he will hr.d nut that
he is personally responsible to the
smallest as well as the largest sto. k
holdpr in case of any trouble. Truly
and affectionately,
r. h. -McDonald.
THE OLD MAN'S CAUSTIC CRITI
CISM OF HIS BROTHERS.
On April 8, j.893, Dr. McDonald took
another fling at his brother, Captain
Jim, and also paid his compliments to
his brother Jasper. The letter is in
part as follows:
NEW YORK, April S, 1893.
My Dear Son Richard: I note what
you say about brother James, his visits
South and his peculiarities generally.
Brother Mark is doubtless having
a great deal of financial trouble, which
is very vexatious if nothing more, and
he should have the sympathy and as
sistance as far as it could reasonably
be done by his brothers and relations.
I have just received' a letter from Jas
per, one of his bilious kind. He
seems to be constantly overflowing
with bile and. in such a jaundiced con
dition that he cannot see anything In
Its true light as it appears to me. The
Oonohue Railroad has been kicking
around for a purchaser these-many
years "past ..without seemingly being
able to find one.
You say that brother James Is put
ting money in.it. and, is becoming very
largely interested in it and that Mr.
Foster Is to become its superintend
ent. Now, if it is a fact that ray
brother has gone into this road, as in
dications make it appear he. has,, it is
likely, that he will get his fingers very
.badly pinched before* he gets out of it.
Neither he nor Mr. Foster knows any
thing more about the ; running of a
railroad than a cow knows the use
â of a handspike. 7 Â Now I I think he Is
getting his coat tail ; into the ma
chinery and there is Just one of two
â  conditions, about it. . First, that he
must tear "thsf coat tail on! and act
loose of it .or .be.drawn In and be
ground to powder, and I am surprised
bat a man of his .advanced age and
ordinary good sense should allow him
self to go into any such -enterprise, for
this Ib, one of those great mills -which
grind large men Into powder V2rv often
and little fish like him iti such n
stream as this w}ll be likely fished up
In a net. There are two kinds of fools
l in this world, one is a young fool and
the other is an old fool, and if he Is In
this work I should think him one of
the latter, and it is said of all the fools
In the world an old fool is the biggest
fool. Truly and affectionately, '
R. H. McDonald.
DIODEMUS SOCRATES HAD GONE
TO THE DEMNITION BOWWOWS.
Captain Jim McDonald evidently dis
turbed the dreams of his brother as
five days later the old doctor was still
discussing that nightmare, the Dona
hue road, coming: to the very serious
conclusion that Captain Jim was crazy
in going into the venture. The lash
was lifted for a moment to descend on
the devoted back of D. S. Dorn, who,
In the opinion of the old gentleman,
hiid gone to the "demnition bowwows."
While commiserating over that event
the doctor suddenly recollected the In
terests of his horse and urged Dick not
to neglect that animal's exercise, other
wise it would travel the road that Dorn
was on.
THE SAN FKANCXBCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1898.
The kaleidoscopic criticism of the
doctor took another twist and I. W.
Hellman and Daniel Meyer follow the
horse on the screen of the doctor's
brain. But still another character was
to follow; Matthew Gage, the River
side irrigationiat, whom the critical
doctor characterized as a continental
curly headed liar. Excerpts from this
letter that must possess some local in
terest are as follows:
NEW YORK. April 13, im
My Dear Son Richard: Yours of the
24th inst. came duly to hand giving
me more detailed particulars of Broth
er James than by telegram. I am
not surprised to hear that such is the
case. Such conditions all work out so
in the end, and I have long expected
that such would be the case without
any detinite time in my mind as to
when it would occur. I note what
you say of the social drinking with
Mr. Sherman and others in Los An
geles. Sooner or later the tragic end
will come. I have been thinking a
good deal of Brother James' invest
ment in the Donohue railroad, for he
knows nothing about railroading, nor
does Mr. Foster know much more than
he. It seems to me as though he must
nave been crazy to have gone into
anything of the kind, and I predict
that it will turn out the unfortunate
business transaction of his life, and
what a fool it seems to me he must
have been to have gone into it.
I learn that Mr. Dorn and his wife
h:iv*> been divorced, and that she is
living in Paris. France, and he here.
This will be likely to prove unfortu
nate for him and eausÂ« himself to be
thrown away and go to nothing, and
he seemed to be on that road before I
left California, and it is a matter that
we will have to take cognizance of for
our own protection and best inter
ests, for It Is a matter we will have
to give attention to in all probability.
I hope you will not allow my horse
to be neglected, and you see that he
has good exercise, and if he is not ex
ercised he will go to nothing. I un
derstand that Mr. Farnum's health is
not very good, and if he keeps up his
excessive smoking as he has been do
ing he will be apt to break down be
fore any great length of time.
1 note what you say about Hellman
and his proffered generosity. You fight
?hy of all such things, and also Daniel
Mfyer. Neither of these men will ever
do anything for you but what they
don't get some kind of a grip by which
thry will get back double the amount
they put in. i.eep clear of all such
characters. You know them and their
habits and life; therefore have as lit
tle to do with them as possible.
Gage came here while I was off on
my trip in North Carolina. He is noth
ing more than a continental, curly
headed liar, and that is about all there
is of him. Truly and affectionately
your father, R. li. McDONALD.
FLOOD AND THE DONOHOE-KELLY
BANK.
On April 22, 1893, the old gentlemar
was still in a gossiping mood and wrote
as follows:
My Dear Son Richard: I has-e two
or three of your unanswered letters
that I win now try to reply to as
briefly as I can. First, the Flood de
falcation in Donohoe-Kelly Bank.
They are all Catholics and Donohoe
has a very high standing In the church
and I think you will find the matter
has all been fixed up with but little
talking about it and that D. K. & Co
will get back all their money that has
not been lost in some way" and that
cannot be recovered. Truly and af
fectionately, r. h. McDonald.
DR. McDONALD'S WARNING COUN-
SEL TO HIS SON.
The next letter that Dr. R. H. Mc-
Donald wrote to his dear son Itichard
was a potpourri of gossip, scandal,
business and nonsense. The range of
the old gentleman's comment began
with his horse and ended with Dyer
and Gage. He was as much concerned
to know whether his horse had been
well exercised as to learn whether or
not the Pacific Bank would lose half a
million dollars. The letter in part is
as follows:
My Dear Son Richard: I note whai
you say about the broKen-down jcon
dltion of Frank M. Pixley, which I
very much regret to hear. If he is in
a half-demented state I hope that his
lather In heaven will soon take him
to himself. Dyer and Gage must be
handled carefully or they will crush
like an eggshell. Please don"t fall to
1Â° IP y hors<} well exercised. Truly
and affectionately your father
r. h. McDonald.
THE AGED BANKER TAKES A FOR
TUNE AWAY FROM HJS
DAUGHTER.
On May 3, 1893, Dr. R. H. McDonald
showed how he could give his daughter
Mattie a fortune and then take it back
again. The daughter was married to
Dr. John C. Spencer and In her mar
riage greatly offended her father who
had, however, deeded to her certain
property that rendered her a month
Income of $400. This property very
much to the regret of Dr. McDonald
could not be taken back. The old man'
however, had : placed certain stocks in
Mattie name and at the same time
retained possession of them. It was in
his power to do as : he ; pleased with
these and he had the stocks made out
in, the name of F. S. Edminster. < The
following letter shows Dr. McDonald's
own record of the transaction: -
". NEW YORK May 23 1593 '
My Dear Son Richard: To-day" I '
arranged with Mr. F. S. Edminstpr
have issued in his name .the following
stocks now standing in the name of

the bank to have this done Please
&& v * attention to this matter kndh^vf

venient. Affectionately vnur father ""
R. H. McDonald.' -
THE CULMINATING CRIME OF DR.
R. h. McDonald.
The last letter written by Dr. R. H
McDonald to hi* son Richard was
penned five weeks before the bank
closed. The old man knew then that
the crash waa coming and the letter
THE OLD MAN'S TERRIBLE COMMAND TO HIS SON.
The facsimile given above proves that Dr. R. H. McDonald committed one of the most shameless offenses In thÂ« whnlÂ«
history of the dishonorable transactions of the Pacific Bank. Shortly before the doors of the institution closed thÂ«
aged financier ordered his son Richard to- take ten thousand dollars more from the vaults of the bank In makl c
this demand the old man declared his belief that the institution must go down and that he must not under any cir
cumstances appear on the books as a personal debtor. He had so transferred his property, aggregating hunrlrortÂ« r>f ty,^ a J^^~
of dollarÃ. that not one cent of it could be attached by his creditors. He had ordered through his snnPn.nl thTh
be dishonestly released from a debt of $142,000. After that he had taken from the vaults three tho. isarfri flniiarJ TÂ«r^
as the crash was impending he demanded $10,000 more in cash. mousana dollars ana
that he sent to his soon seems almost
incredible. It very seldom happens,
possibly in any sphere of life, that a
man wlli seek to make his son a thief.
There are few instances of such moral
prostitution in the histoiâ of this city
at leaet, but Dr. R. H. McDonald
stands convicted by his own handwrit
ing of such a crime. He had helped
to wreck the Pacific Bank. He had
organized the People* Bank in order
that he might rob the people of this
city. When brought face to face with
his terrible offenses his mask of sanc
tity saved him long enough to permit
him to escape from San Francisoo.
With false promises he fought for
time and succeeded in saving his enor
mous fortune from the possession c f
those to whom it rightfully belonged.
Step by step he gathered his wealth
into Buch a form that it could be taken
out of the reach of the courts of this
State. To do this he commanded his
sons to falsify his books and then, with
an almost sacrilegious hypocrisy he
sought to retain the name of an hon
orable man. He counseled his son
Dick that the Bank Commissioners
might pounce down upon the bank at
any time and $10,000 more must be
stolen before they came.
The books, so the old man instructed,
must be tampered with and changed so
that he could not be exposed as a debtor,
and could not be charged with fraud.
His letter in all of the terrible corre
spondence that found its way into the
vaults of the Pacific Bank la the most
appalling in its immorality, and is the
proof of Dr. R. H. McDonald's crime.
The letter in full is as follows:
NEW YORK. May 15, ISO 3.
My Dear Son Richard; From what
I hear of the course the Bank Cum
mis.sioners are taking and are liable
to take toward our bank there is no
telling what crisis may come and re
sult may follow.
I want here to say I have not money
enough here to pay a six months'
board bill, and if any trouble is likely
to come to the bank you must send
me or secure for me, secure for me
at least Jlfl.ooo in cash. And I think
you had better send me at once a
draft for J.VJOO. I am owing Mrs. A. D
Spencer *2fiOO. You must* not fail <o
pay this oft' before troubles come. This
12000 is all the personal debt I have
that I know of, and in trouble I don't
want one cent to stand against me
personally and this $2000 must be paid
Don t allow me to be caught in a trap
in this matter. There will be no money
if the doors are closed. ,
I hope and pray that such a calamity
Pl,*/P I ,*/ not â¢Â£ e reached, but there is no

unexpectedly at some times. Be on the
alert, and don't be in a position to be
charged with fraud in any way. It
Is ip that way that many will hunt ud
excuses to squeeze us if possible do
so. knowing this is the mos'" ef

TOMALES BUSINESS
BLOCK DESTROYED
Fire Consumes Property to the
Value of Twenty Thousand
Dollars.
TOMALES, Nov. 9.â What was once the
principal r business block of this town is
now a , mass of charred and \ smoldering
ruins. Fire broke out in the upper part
of J. B. Gay's livery stable at 9:30 o'clock
this morning, and before flames could
be subdued $20,000 worth of property ; was
; burned. v; The Grutli Hotel, Fairbanks',
store, Gay's stable, Silvera's barber-shop
and : Mulvaney's , stable were entirely J de
stroyed. ; The total insurance will aggre
gate $3000. â¢ â¢ . : â â " â  â  / '. ::.- v â¢ ;
John Watt, a butcher, saw flames burst
ing from an upper window in Gay's
stable. He gave the alarm, and instantly
the whole town turned out to try to stay
the progress of the fire.
The horses and a few vehicles were re
moved before Mulvaney's stable caught
fire. Then the 'fire spread to Fairbanks'
store. A few things were removed from
the store, but the heat soon became so In
tense that nobody oould enter any of the
burning buildings. The town contains no
provisions for fighting a fire, and the citi
zens had to form bucket brigades and
work in relay*. "Wet blankets and sacks
were spread on the roofs of the buildings
likely to catch fire. Several times adja
cent buildings were ignited, but the flames
were prevented from spreading by tne
bucket brigades.
All the houses to the north were
scorched and blackened, and on the west
all the windows were cracked and shat
tered by the heat. The buildings destroyed
were wooden, which made the effort to
cheek the flames difficult.
Some believe the fire to have been the
work of an incendiary- others think a
tramp must have set fire to the Btabl-j
while sleeping in the loft.

Late this afternoon Republican
Chairman Babcock claimed that 174
Republicans had certainly been elected
to Congress. This fell five short of a
majority, for there are 357 members jn
the House, requiring 179 votes to or
ganize.
To-night Mr. Babcock said that later
returns indicate that seven more Re
publicans had been elected, making 181
altogether, or a majority of four over
Democrats, Populists and Fusionists.
His table of Republicans certainly
elected is as follows:
California, 6; Connecticut, 4; Dela
ware, 1; Illinois, 13; Indiana, 8; lowa,
11; Kansas, 6; Kentucky, 1; Maine, 4;
Maryland, 3; Massachusetts, 10; Michi
gan, 12; Minnesota, 5; Missouri, 3; Ne
braska, 3; New York, 18; New Hamp
shire, 2; New Jersey, 6; North Dakota,
1; Ohio, 16; Oregon, 2; Pennsylvania,
21; Rhode Island, 2; South Dakota, 2;
Tennessee, 2; Vermont, 2; Washington,
2; West Virginia, 4; Wisconsin, 10;
Wyoming, 1; total. 18L
Babcock says the Democrats are only
cure of 153, the Populists 9 and the Sil
verites 2, leaving twelve in tile doubt
ful Cvlumn, of which he expects one
more Republican from California, one
from Kansas and possibly two more
from Indiana.
It will be seen that in the above esti
mate he claims all four of the West
Virginia Congressmen, as well as three
from Missouri and two from Washing
ton State. He says that Joy, R., is
elected in Missouri, and James Ham
ilton Lewis and William C. Jones of
Washington State have been defeated
by Cushman and William L. Jones, Re
publicans.
Democratic Chairman Kerr Is equally
positive in his declaration that 184
Democrats have been elected, or a ma
jority of eight over Republicans, Popu
lists and fusionists, and that eleven
districts are in doubt. Thus both
chairmen are making practically the
same claim, and it may be several days
before the result is definitely known.
The chances seem to be that neither
Republicans nor Democrats will con
trol the House, but the Populists and
fusionists will hold the balance of
power. There was some talk to-day
that in this event the Republicans of
the House, in order to prevent the elec
tion of a Speaker favorable to silver,
would invite the gold-money Democrats
to Join them, and that jointly they

All four of the West Virginia districts i
may be classed as doubtful. Babcock
| claims them all and Kerr does not con
cede any of them.
The Senate is safely Republican. The
highest Republican estimate places the
majority at eighteen over all other
parties combined. It appears that the
following: States have either Republi
can Senators now in that body or have
elected Republican Legislatures: Cali
fornia 2, Colorado. 1, Connecticut 2,
Delaware 1, Idaho 1, Illinois 1, Indiana
2, Inwa 2. Kansas 1, Kentucky 1, Maine
2, Maryland 2, Massachusetts 2. Mirhi- '
pan 2, Minnesota 2. Montana 1, Nebras
ka 2, New Hampshire 2. New Jersey 2.
I New York 2, North Carolina 1,
i South Dakota 1. Vermont 2, j
West Virginia 2, Wisconsin 2, Wyo- '
ming 2; total. 54. This does not include
Senators Teller of Colorado, classed as
Silver Republican, Senators Jones and
Stewart of Nevada or Pettigrew of
South Dakota, all of whom are natur
ally inclined to vote with the Republi
cans on all matters other than the !
money question. This count gives the
Democrats twenty-six Senators, the i
Populists, Fusionists and Silver Re- j
publicans ten, a Republican majority !
over all of 18.
The Senate will undoubtedly be reor
ganized in the next Congress. If there
should be an extra session of the Sen
ate convened soon after March 4 to
consider the treaties now in process of |
negotiation the reorganization would I
take place at that time. General Cox. j
secretary, and Colonel Dick Bright, j
sergeant-at-arms, as well as all other
Senate officers, will be succeeded by
Republicans, and all the committee
chairmanships will be filled by them,
too. ,_________^^__
NEW YORK'S LEGISLATURE
SAFELY REPUBLICAN
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â The latest fig
ures obtainable show that Roosevelt's
plurality in the State is not far from
20.000. Only ten counties in the State
! gave Van Wyck pluralities and they
were all localities swayed by cities, as
New York, Kings, Queens and Erie.
The falling off in Roosevelt's plurality,
as compared with Black's in 1896, is
due to a decrease in the Republican
j vote up the State of 61,000 and in
Greater New York of 62,000. Against
this Van Wyck gained 20,000 above the
Harlem and 53,000 below it, as com
pared with Porter two years ago. The
result on Congressmen in this State
seems to have surprised even the Dem
ocrats themselves. Nineteen of their
candidates were elected, the Repub
licans getting but fifteen.
In the present House the New York
delegation stands twenty-seven Repub
licans to six Democrats. In the Greater
New York district all the Democratic
candidates were elected.
After the gubernatorial contest as
much interest was taken in the State
Legislature as in anything else. The
State Senate will be Republican by
four and the Assembly by twenty.
Political interest from now on will
center about the Senatorship and al
ready discussion as to the probable as
pirants has begun. So far there is no
announced candidate and the Repub
lican organization has not declared it
self.
POPULIST GOVERNOR
ELECTED IN KANSAS
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 9.â Returns In
dicate the election of Stanley for Gov
ernor by a majority of 13,000, and, while
refusing to talk, Taylor Riddle, the
Populist chairman, makes no further
claims and practically concedes the de
feat of Vincent for Congress in the Fifth
and of Simpson in the Seventh.
The Republicans elect two State Sen
ators, which give them eleven members
in that body. They also elect ninety
seven Representatives out of 125. This
gives them a majority of 52 on joint bal
lot in the Legislature and insures the
election of a Republican State Printer.
VIENNA.
Here we have a protid, imperial city,
rather disdainful of trade, aristocratic
and easy going, conscious of a long past,
its rulers still animated with the convic
tion that they are the successors of Char
lemagne and Otto, locking on Berlin as
prtrvcnu, on London as merely commer
cial, on Paris as half crazy. Excepting
in the domain of music, Vienna is not a
home of art and culture, but it is a center
of dignity and grace, and a certain calm
air of superiority, which, however, does
not offend. It is content to look on while
other places explore and write and toil
and push and strain; it stands on its
rank, it can never forget its sixteen quar
terings and its claims to high estate.
Vienna is most interesting, perhaps, as
the meeting place between East and
West; where the fine gentleman rubs
shoulders in the afternoon lounge along
the Graben with the Bosnian peasant.
The guardian of Europe's ancient order,
the center of a great and most interest
ing empire, the city of leisure and of a
pride ao lofty that it does not know It
self to be pride at allâ Vienna is both a
charmlngr city and an important political
center, as she will continue to be, no mat
ter what is the fate of the Austrian Em
pire.âThe Spectator.

DEMOCRATIC
LUCRE WASTED
IN LOS ANGELES
Clean Sweep for the
Republicans.
DOUGLAS WHITES MISSION
SAID TO HAVE "HANDLED THE
FUSION SACK."
Cut a Wide Swath, but Palled to
Land the Democratic Votes He
Was Sent South, to
Purchase.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.â The only
fusion nominee on the State ticket who
haa carried this county 1b Judge Wal
ter Van Dyke for Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court. The fusionists
have been "swept off the earth," save
in the case Â©f one Justice of the Peace
and one Assemblyman. William Mead
has defeated James Meredith In the
Seventy-third District by 100 votes.
Two years ago Mead had 800 majority
in the same district.
One of the political sensations of the
day is the connection of Douglas White
of San Francisco with the fight in three
Assembly districts in this county.
White came to the city the latter part
of last week, and word was given out
that he had come south for the pur
pose of "handling the sack" in the in
terest of Democratic Assemblymen in
the Seventy-second, Seventy-third and
Seventy-fifth districts. The intelligence
was soon spread broadcast, and White's
frequent conferences with John T.
Gaffey, the well-known Democratic
leader, gave credence to the report.
At first everybody regarded him as a
serious factor in the legislative cam
paign, but by election day his perform
ances had assumed an opera-bouffe air.
With a mysterious wink White would
call to one side well-known heelers,
who, after consultation with the im
ported fusion leader, would promptly
report to the local headquarters of the
Republican party. White, it is said, had
a deputy who handled the sack. From
the figures obtained from machine Re
publicans it is estimated that $750 was
wasted on heelers, who promptly voted
the Republican ticket. White has been
cutting a wide swath since his arrival
in Los Angeles and so have some of the
heelers in the Eighth Ward.
Voters who a week ago had not the
price of a meal are now arrayed in
purple and fine linen. The only result
of Mr. White's visit to Los Angeles is
that some heelers call his name blessed
and Mr. Mead narrowly escaped defeat.
Mr. White will cross Tehachapi in tri
umph to-morrow, but he will not have
as trophies in his belt four legislative
votes he was ordered to bring from the
south.
The vote in this equalization district
is very close. George L. Arnold prob
ably is elected.
Governor-elect Henry T. Gage visit
ed Republican headquarters to-day and
received an enthusiastic reception. He
is highly gratified at the support he
has received in Southern California.
Mr. Gage is exhausted as the result of
his campaign labors and will go to the
mountains for a week of rest and
recreation.
A DANGER SIGNAL. OVER THE
MELON PATCH.
A man was out drivmg one-aiternoon
and went beyond the limits of West
port. He was jogging along the road
taking things easy, more interested In
! his fair companion than in the land
! scape. Suddenly he pulled his horse in.
I Down the road he saw a red flag fast-
I ened to a pole stck in a fence post. He
! stared at It silently for some minutes.
"What is it?" asked his companion,
uneasily.
"I can't make it out. Perhaps it's a
rifle range. Maybe they're blasting.
' Anyhow, it's a danger signal," he re
plied.
He drove forward cautiously, stop
ping now and then to look at the red
flag. There being no visible evidences
of danger he proceeded, and saw, hitch
ed to the fence post by a long rope, the
meanest mule in Missouri. It was
| humpbacked and skinny. Its loose hide
was scarred and worn bare in patches.
Its ears were ragged and its eyes were
red. Its hoofs were normally devel
oped. The rope by which it was tied
I was short enough to keep it out of the
! highwayâ beyond that was evidently
danger.
An old farmer Hat on the fence in the
shade of an apple tree across the road.
"What's that flag for?" asked the
man who was driving.
"That flag means keep away from
the mule," answered the old man.
"Then why in thunder don't you tie
him up in your barn or in a field?"
asked the driver.
"That mule,'" replied the farmer, "is
better than constable or bulldog. See
that patch of mushmelons? The boys
'round here ust to skin that patch most
regular, an' I couldn't keep em out.
They'd win every dog I set to watchin'
em, but they can't win the mule. I
lost so much sleep watchin' the patch
that I got nervous prostration. Then I
thought of ole Bill there, and we put
him out. It took six neighbors to do
it. He didn't want the job. I don't
know how we're ever goin' to get him
back again â shoot the rope in two, I
guess. But every one about here knows
Bill, an' you bet them melons is safe
while he's there. You see, his rope is
just long enough to cover the patch.
Well, so long."â Kansas City Star.
AN UP-TO-DATE FAJBLK
Once upon a time there was a Young
Man who was unable to go upon the
Stage, bo he acted as Walter In a Hash
house. Now this Young Man was un- !
doubtedly Poorer than he was Dishonest,
but he had the Nerve to seek in mar
riage the hand of the only Daughter of
a Bloated Aristocrat. The latter, how- !
ever, Was Sore on the Walter and put up !
all his spare Time collecting Insults to !
heap on his Head, although tne Daughter
was over Shoetop deep in love with the
dashing Plate Juggler.
One bright but happy day the Youth
WU standing in the doorway of the '
Deanery in which he Waited, waiting for
Victims of the Eating Habit to come
along, when suddenly a large cry of Hor- ;
ror punctured the surrounding Quietude
and dashing toward him came a mad- i
dened Steed, while, with blanched face, i
the Bloated Aristocrat whose Daughter
he loved sat powerless In the fated Ve
hicle.
The Poor but Brave Waiter saw his Op- '
portunity and quickly grasped it right by ;
the back of the Neck. Rushing to meet |
the maddened Steed he shouted Aloud, as i
he was wont to do when giving orders to
the Cook, and, snatching the Apron from |
about his person, he waved it Frantically
in the air.
The maddened Animal then swerved i
from its course, and, dashing the frail
Vehicle against a friendly Lamp-post,
flung the Bloated Aristocrat out from
therein and broke his proud Neck.
At a proper distance after the Funeral
the Poor but Triumphant Waiter threw
up hie Job and married the only Daughter
of the dead Aristocrat, and they are now
living comfortably off the Life Insur-
ance.

Park died In the belief that the Niger
found its way to the Atlantic through
the Congo, which alone at its mouth
seemed to possess an adequate body of
water for so long a river; and, while
Major Peddle in vain attempted to follow

ernment in 1816 to follow up the Congo
from its mouth. But both expeditions
proved equally disastrous. Eight years
later Lieutenant Clapperton, on his first
expedition from the Barbary Coast, learn
ed at Sackatoo (or Sokoto) that the Niger
flowed southward 10 the sea. With a
view to determine this he was sent out
again in 1525, and this time landed at
Badagry, near Lagos, in the Bight of
Benin, not a very great distance, as it
afterward turned out, from the long
sought mouth of the river. From here he
and his companions traveled overland,
reaching the Niger at Bussa, just below
when Mungo Park had met with his
death. Then, instead of following his in
structions and descending the river to its
outlet, he started off an ambitious design
to cross the continent to Abyssinia, and
difd at Sokoto in April, 1827.
It was Clapperton's servant, Richard
Lander, who, with his brother John, in
1830, settled the question of the outlet of
the Niger by descending it in canoes from
Bussa, or rather from Yauri, where they
had first gone to try to recover Park's pa
pers. The mystery was solved, and the
river was found to enter the sea by a
number of mouths, which for hundreds of
years had been known to our merchants
as the Oil Rivers, and which, being in
dividually smaller than the united stream,
had given no suspicion of their being the
outlet of a great river. The Landers seem
to have met with fewer obstacles from the
rapids, which had proved so fatal to Park,
than from the unfriendliness of the na
tives. â Gentleman's Magazine.
MOZART S MISSHAPEN EAR.
The Italians have an expression, "Voce
di compos! tore," Indicating the defective
quality of the vocal apparatus in musical
composers. But if a composer need not
have a voice he must have a good ear. It
would seem, however, that a good ear
need not be a beautiful one. In the Mo
zart Museum at Salzburg there is a small
water-color painting representing two hu
man ears. The drawing is described in
the catalogue as "Mozart's ear and an
ordinary ear." Dr. Gerber, privet docent
in the University of Konissberg, has re
cently published in the Deutsche Medi
cinlsche Wochenschrift an anthropological
study on Mozart's ear. The fact that the
great composer had ears of a peculiar
shape suggests the notion that there is
some connection between the form of the
ear and the musical faculty, which shows
itself in earliest youth. Such an idea,
however, says the British Medical Jour
nal, rests on a very slender basis of fact,
as there have been opportunities of estab
lishing the truth.
Mozart's ears were of the broad type
especially seen in the lower races of man,
and must, therefore, be looked upon as
a mark of a low grade of development.
While the normal ear is curved in beauti
ful lines and has a longish form, Mozart's
ear was flat, presenting obtuse angles in
stead of curves, so that it might be de
scribed as misshapen. The complete want
of lobe is a well-known mark of low de
velopment, especially when, as in the case
of Mozart, it occurs in connection with a
broad ear. It is surely .an example of
nature's irony that the man whose inner
ear was of the highest grade of develop
ment had an outer ear misshapen to the
point of ugliness and of a retrograde type
generally found only in the lowest sav
ages.
KOREAN GEOMANCERS.
The influence of the geomancers ex
tends from the King to his humblest
subjects, and illustrates the cunning and
simplicity which are combined in the Kor
ean character. These professional oracles
are consulted on all occasions by all sorts
of people. The King never thinks of do
ing anything without first asking their
opinion. They are more important to him
than legal advisers are to railways and
other corporations that employ them, and
they are attached to all the departments
of the Government. At the same time
they art: notoriously corrupt, and their ad
vi-e is always Influenced by the payment
of money.
If any one desires to obtain a favor
from the King he usually endeavors to se
cure the good offices of the geomancer
who Is likely to be consulted, and the
amount of the bribe corresponds to the
importance of the matter. While the geo
manrer pretends to consult the spirits and
ol Mrve the movements of the stars, his
client knows that it is the money that
governs his action. Nevertheless, when
the client is required to perform some im
portant official act, he consults the same
old humbug, who has been bribed by some
one else to influence his decision, and he
is perfectly aware of the fact.â The Chau
tauquan.
WHAT IS A FLAMP
This means a double stroke on the drum
as a signal on parade, and we find in old
drill book, "The major then ordered a
flam," "three rolls and six flams," etc.
Toward the close of the seventeenth cen
tury it was almost solely by words of
command that infantry exercises were
gone through: there were no bugle sounds
and the use of the drum was rare.
The term is still used by the drummers
in the Foot Guards, and probably in the
line regiments. To explain it fully would
be too technical and take up too much
space. It consists of a few beats on the
Bidedrum, in peculiar rhythm, known as
the "open flam" or the "close flam," on
which the non-commissioned officers and
men on parade move as instructed. â
Notes and Queries.
There are in Tokio ten iron bridges
and eleven stone bridges. Besides
I these, there are about sixty-nine wood
en bridges, measuring upward of thir
teen ken. Those that are of smaller
I length are too numerous to be counted.

OND MAGUiRE ALSO RAN.
AMERICANS are not like the old Roman-.
We don't line the path of a triumphal proces
which leads the fallen captive and cry,
"Woe to the conquered."
But in i ur ci\ sts there i- cause for exulta
gl t principles prevail and the wrong go
I â¢ ontest against Judge Maguire was
We made it solely on his record. He
that record by many years of laborious activity
litics. We presented it as made by himself, in
vn language, statements and acts. Not one word
im ft-as indulged in, nor an untruthful
statement made.
Judge Maguire has been for years building up a
pessimism, on hopelessness, on a magnified
. â  social conditions, and on intolerance of
[ others. It may be said
a- a truthful ascription to his energy and influence
that after he left the Democratic party in 1.887, and
returned to it in 1892. he succeeded in destroying it
air it was from the beginning. He seized its organi
zation, and by his influence created a new party, with
leaders who knew not Israel, and principles opposed
to everything the Democracy had taught, learned and
believed in for nearly a century. It was a great work,
this carrying over a name and an organization to rep
resent everything that under the same party name had
been opposed and battled against for generations.
Maguire knew that this remarkable reversal of
principle-, practices and professions would alienate
ai; immense Democratic vote. But. with the genius of
corr.mand. he reached out for allies to make good his
k^es. and seemed to find them in the Populists and
Silver Republicans.
Xow. in its essence his force consisted of all the
pev-imism in the old Democracy, and all the pes
simists under the Populist and Silver Republican
standards: For all Democrats who refused to follow
he had one convenient and rather powerful designa
tion; he dismissed them as "railroad hirelings and
minions of monopoly." and, -nunding the charge on
uugle. plunged into the fray, to go down in a
most crushing and admonitory defeat.
His movement was founded and propagated in a
profound misconception of the American people.
The unquenchable tendency of Americans is to op-
timism and not pessimism, to hope, not despair. The
Revolution was begun in hope. In hope were the
Foundations of the republic laid and the scheme and
structure of our government finished. Faith in the
h ture peopled the wilderness of our vast domain and
'lotted it with States, many of which have more peo
ple and more power than some of the independent
nations of the Old World. Mope is still the guide of
Americans and when it ceases to be their master
motive, not merely parties will die. but the republic
will be doomed. The optimism of California beat Ma
guire and has killed his new party in its cradle.
The great result in this State is something more
than a rebuke to pessimism. It is a repudiation,
gladly recorded, of the political methods of Maguire's
organ, the Examiner. The sheer bFiitality of that
paper in text and cartoon was felt by the people to
be a drawback to this State, a stain upon its name, a
damage to its interests. Judge Maguire owes some
thousands of the majority which the people hang like
a millstone around his neck to the brazen effrontery,
heartless falsehoods and vulgar brutality of that
paper which he once characterized as "the greatest
paper on earth."
At its discomfiture and the rebuke that stings it
like a hard whip the people rejoice.
Babylon has fallen in California. The land-owner
owns his land, the miner the gold that he digs. The
people own their manhood and franchise. A great
danger has been safely passed. All honor to the men
of all parties who saw and joined to avert it.
Occasionally a pugilist is killed in the ring in this
country, and while the slayer is usually arrestedj he is
put to no further inconvenience, the public sense of
gratitude serving to shield him. Now a similar event
has taken place in England, and it will be interesting
to notice whether the killing of a pugilist is there re
garded a$ an actual offense.
At one of the Far Eastern ports visited by the
Kaiser an effort was made to clear the harbor of all
shipping save the craft of the royal traveler. The
steamers of a French company refused to budge, and
very properly. When the authorities essay to be snob
bish they deserve to be corrected.
Several Cuban refugees are in New York penniless
and hungry, and the Cuban Junta, being asked by
them for bread, gives a stone in the shape of a marble
heart.
There seems to be a far more intricate tangle of
red tape about the mustering out of a regiment than
the mustering in. Uncle Sam has no trouble in get
ting soldiers, but it is hard for him to let go.
THjE NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR,
A REPUBLICAN Legislature was elected on
Tuesday. Next January it must choose a Sen
ator of the United States from California to
1 | serve for six years.
In making this choice great care and discrimination
j must be used. The Democratic Senator, to whom a
I successor must be elected, has taken front rank
; among the members of that body, and has cora
| manded the respect of his political opponents and
: the attention of the country. The Republican party
I must not send a man there who by contrast will
| merely serve as a foil to him and his record for po
! tency and ability, and so demote the State rather than
â¢ promote it. A man should follow him who will
stand in an equal attitude of strength as a representa
tive of the Republican faith of California and the as-
I pirations of a majority of her people. We take occa
\ sion to say now, early in the contest, that this State
most not run after a name, mtlst not run away from
substance to grasp a shadow.
There is a fairly well organized movement here to
; gratify family pride and make a play in the line of
: gratitude and patriotism by electing to the Senate
i Mr. U. S. Grant Jr. of San Diego. We speak of Mr.
I Grant with great personal respect, and no stress of
circumstances can compel us to do him any injustice.
But we protest against his candidacy and his elec
! tion to the Senate from California under the illumina
. tion of the great name of his father.
In this republic men stand for what they arc, not
I for what their fathers were. This rule cannot be con
spicuously violated without reversing our wholesome
; republican idea, which in its essence is at war with
the whole theory of hereditary honor and position.
General Grant, lapsing into obscurity after his
resignation from the army., emerged from that obscur
ity humbly, took a subordinate place as an officer of
Illinois volunteers, and thence by sheer force of
genius, made vital by circumstance and opportunity,
! fought his way to command of the Union armies and
\ to a series of victories that put him among the world's
i great captains, with Alexander, Caesar, Marlborough,
â  Frederick the Great # and Napoleon. He took nothing
I from his ancestors except the latent genius that made
I him the man of the hour and the military primate of
the age in which he lived.
It sheds no lu?ter on his fame and in no wise adorns j
i his name for California to shut her eyes to the lack i
! of experience, the unproved qualifications, the brief
â  and uneventful citizenship of his son, and pitch him
in among the giants of the Federal Senate, where his i
: sole title to respect and distinction will be that he
> bears his father's name!
A son of General Grant, or a descendant, may add ,
to the fame of the victor of Vicksburg and Appo- j
; mattox in one way only, by fighting his way to the j
front in politics, arms or a learned profession, and !
proving that ability to do so and to win is in the fam- j
â  ily blood. â 
We indulge in no disparagement when we declare j
that the gentleman whose claims ,ye discuss has not j
' heretofore shown any sign of the original quality, the j
power of initiative, which would make people forget
him for his name and rally around him for* himself.
Therefore it will not dignify his father's imperish
able memory, nor in any way advance California, nor
even benefit him. to waste upon him an honor that
b ' ngs to original qualities, training, fitness and i
presence among men, rather than to merely inherited
honors and a name on which he has not conferred i
the slightest distinction.
We say these things in all possible kindness, but i
with great firmness and fixity of purpose, to stand
against the un-American theory of hereditary obli
\ gations in the selection of men for the foremost places
in this republic.
CONGRESSMAN KAHN.
THE people of the Fourth Congressional Dis
.rict are to be congratulated upon the election
of Julius Kahn. The decisive plurality by which
he has been chosen makes several things quite con
spicuous.
One is that the people of the Fourth District are
not enamored of the mouthing anarchy for which
James H. Barry is chiefly noted in this city, and that
when given a chance they will always rebuke it.
Another is that the district is not hopelessly Demo
cratic, but may always be carried by a Republican of
ability and character. Still another is that the peo
ple are able to tell. a good man when they see him,
which is not by any means an unimportant feature of
citizenship in these days of befuddled issues and per
sonal misrepresentation.
Mr. Kahn, we have no hesitation in saying, will
make a first-class Congressman, and for this reason
there is no ground for believing that the Fourth Dis
trict will not become permanently Republic: a.
Judge Morrow carried it three times in successn/n,
which shows that a Republican with friends and char
acter has nothing to fear from partisanship in the dis
trict. Mr. Kahn is a high-minded, patriotic, respect
able man, of good impulses and excellent principles.
He is a fair speaker, and with experience will become
a strong debater. He possesses all the points of a
fine Representative, and in Congress, if kept in long
enough, he cannot fail to achieve distinction and con
fer credit upon his constituents.
In the Legislature, where Kahn served a short time,
he demonstrated the possession of integrity of a high
order, which makes it certain that he will never be
found transacting any business that is discreditable
either to himself or to his people. As a Congressman
he is bound to rank high, for his ability, force, genial
nature, patriotism, interest in affairs and unswerving
honesty are certain to bring him to the front.
Unless we are mistaken the people of the Fourth
District have drawn a prize in the election lottery.
This is especially true when we consider that Kahn
has defeated Barry and will succeed Judge Maguire.
THE EXAMINER'S CAMPAIGN.
THE Examiner has succeeded in adding another
to the list of votes of want of confidence passed
upon it by the people of California.
It took charge of Maguire's campaign, groomed,
blanketed, bitted and rode him to a stumble on the
backstretch.
Relying on the power of vituperation and the
strength of prejudice, with confidence in the utiHty
cf falsehood, it exhausted ilk local talent in those re
spects, and when its staff fell breathless with not another
he in their throats, it imported talent in space-writing
and vindictive caricature from its laboratory' of de
traction in New York and announced with trumpets
and cymbals that it was prepared to do up the Repub
licans of California for a breakfast spell.
Immediately its columns irrupted with a smallpox
of abuse, pustular and revolting. What could not be
sr.id by language was uttered by cartoon. Every pas
sion was appealed to in turn. Envy, revenge, greed
and grudge among men were treated as the master
motives that were to control the politics of Califor
nia. Honorable citizens were daily held up to public
contempt and execration. The bench was libeled. To
good actions was insinuated a bad motive. Like
Jeshurun, the fatted ox, forgetting the crib at which
it had fed, the railroad was assailed and slimed over
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1898.
with abuse, and then all men who opposed Maguire
were stuck in it, like flies in flypaper. If such a Re
publican speech were made highly calling the people
to heed great principles, it was the business of the
Examiner imported talent to prove that it was written
i<; the railroad office. If a Democrat voiced his dis
gust at the debauchery of his party, he was pictured
by that sheet as a lackey of Huntington. No one was
permitted to have an opinion adverse to it without
getting a shower of filth on his reputation and all the
tarnish that imported desperadoes could put upon his
name. But to what little purpose were these base tac
tics followed? The people held their noses, read it,
pondered it, went to the polls and beat it, wiped it
out. burned it in the quicklime of rebuke as a pesti
lent breeder of diseased public opinion, and went their
way with the satisfaction which waits upon duty well
done.
GREATER in satisfaction than victory won by
dubious methods is honorable defeat.
Mayor Phelan has been re-elected to the
high office he has held for a term, and Charles L. Pat
ton, after a gallant campaign, open, above the sus
picion of trickery, untinged by the color of corrupt
ing gold, has lost by a narrow margin. Patton's can
vass was in all respects a remarkable one. He brought
into it an unsullied reputation, and he went out of it
with his reputation maintained, his methods unques
tioned and his strength among the people established.
During his two years in oflke Mayor Phelan has
turned the departments under his control into a
political machine. Of this machine he is sole director.
He selected the personnel of the convention which
nominated him. He named those who should be on
the ticket with him. He accepted two* nominations
in advance of the promulgation of the platforms.
That money was freely used in his behalf is generally
I believed, and it is openly charged that for Phelan's
! interests, when he saw them in danger, Maguire
was traded and slaughtered in the house of hn
friends. A knowledge of these facts detracts some
i what from the glory of achievement.
To Patton there is due from his party and the citi
zens generally a debt of gratitude. A successful law
yer and business man, he had never been in politics.
His ambitions were not in the direction of office. The
opportunity was thrust upon him, and he undertook
i what seemed like a hopeless task. He undertook it
only from a sense of duty. He knew that Phelan
| was intrenched, that the Phelan hosts had been mar
â  shaled, the plan of campaign marked out to the small
est detail, the spoils apportioned in advance. An or
dinary candidate, in opposition to such an array of
fortified henchmen, would have made a fight so futile
as to be ridiculous. A strong man was needed, and
Patton proved himself to be the man. He had not
been in the field twenty-four hours before the Mayor
knew a foe worthy of the administration's steel had
arisen. He had not been there a week before the
Phdan followers were in an agony of fear, and to the
end they worked as for a desperate cause and a feeble
I chance.
By the exercise of the utmost activity, and a resort
| to every trick familiar to the trained manipulator, they
I managed to continue Phelan in office. But they have
I not besmirched Patton, because they could not. He
! emerges unscathed from a bitter contest, his worth as
a man made known, his loyalty as a Republican writ
ten large, and his individuality so impressed upon the
community and the State that it will not be forgotten.
The future holds for Patton greater rewards than he
came so close to attaining. He will be needed in
affairs of state, and since he devoted his time and his
energy to carrying the flag of his party to the in
trenchments of the enemy, he will be gratefully re
! membered. It is but the logic of events that he shall
|be called to a larger leadership. He has lost nothing,
; when there is considered the vital character of that
which he has gained. With the complacency of a
philosopher he accepts the verdict. He did much
toward educating the voters. Many were won over.
The spirit of reform which he represented could not
in one short campaign be crystallized.
We have no feeling of animosity toward Mayor
Phelan. On the contrary, we wish him well and hope
the conduct of his office will be marked by an ab
! sence of the features which have heretofore brought
upon it a measure of discredit. We trust the Mayor will
learn that he cannot always continue to be the Dem
ocracy, and that such Democracy as he may constitute
himself cannot always continue to rule. This time
he was too cunning, his schemes too deep-laid, his
| minions too carefully instructed, to be overthrown.
I He had a narrow escape from defeat, and for him
: such experience would have been fraught with dis
i grace, for it would have been a distinct rebuke. In
deed, the result which keeps him in power is far from
flattering, for had he been a faithful servant the tide
ir his favor would have been overwhelming against
any candidate who could have been named, and any
j such candidate only a sacrifice on the party altar.
We congratulate Mr. Patton. Against great odds
he fought a good fight. In a subdued way, we con
gratulate the Mayor. He has been given opportunity
to redeem himself, and to profit by contemplation of
the errors marring his first term. He is a person of
brains and education, fully competent, if he will, to
reach a plane above that of the mere office-seeker, and
to doff the cloak of demagogy in which he appears to
be enwrapped.
IT is by no means among the minor satisfactions of
the election that "Maguire's logical successor in
Congress," Barry, was defeated. For years he has
made war upon every great interest in this city and
upon all promoters of the prosperity of California.
Eminence in business, letters, or the professions, has
attracted his attention only to provoke his abuse of
it. He has incited civil disorder, assaulted the
cotirts, attacked maliciously everything and every
body, for the purpose of impressing a small and
vicious circle with his heroism. If no one paid any
attention to his vicious vagaries he took it for fear of
his power. At last this canine creature, having ap
parently terrified all those who lived within hearing
of his kennel, was tempted by ambition to venture
upon a wider field. The people got a chance to ex
press their opinion of him. and he has scurried back
to cover^with a tin kettle rattling behind him and the
steam of scalding water rising in his tracks. Beaten
by thousands, he will hereafter do his yelping and
disturb the peace in his former little place, and no
one will pay him the compliment of even shying a
stone at him. San Francisco should be proud that
she had the patience to attend to such a small detail
as the fellow's candidacy for Congress, and to beat
him soundly and forever.
Somebody has started a report that the United
States will swap the Philippines for Canada. There
seems to be a lack of information as to what asylum
the report emanates from.
A Chicago hermit who left his fortune in trust for
the benefit of girl waifs was thoughtless enough to
also leave some relatives. This fact promises more
to the lawyers than to the waifs.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 9.
Alamcda County will not part with the
State Republican banner this year. While
her majority will not be so great as it
gave President McKinley, it is larger
than that of any. other county in the
State.
Never was a Republican victory so
gratifying to the respectable element of
Alameda County as that which has land
ed Henry T. Gage in the Governor's chair.
It is a flat repudiation and denial of all the
falsehoods, epithets, insinuations and in
sults that have been hurled at the voters
of this county by the fusionists for the
â  past three months. It is a vindication of
the party integrity that prevailed at the
State and county Republican conventions.
It is a slap in the face to those ill-ad
vised calamity howlers who have been
forever crying "slate," "boss" or any
other term which could relieve their
Jealousy and spleen.
in this county especially Republican
success is a vindication of the honor and
manhood of the thousands who derive
their living from the railroad company.
The lie that these citizens, among the
very best in the county, can be herded at
election times and made to vote as their
employers dictate is exploded by trie very
arguments used by the fusionists. In their
final howl they declared that all the cor
porations had issued orders to defeat the
Republican nominee for Assessor, Henry
P. Â£>alton. Now that the votes are in this
falsehood is best repudiated by the
figures, which show that Mr. Dalton has
polled the largest majority of any candi
date on the county ticket.
in this county the issues were hatred,
malice, satire, indecency, hypocrisy and
egotism on one side; decency, logic, hon
esty, fearlessness and candor on the
â¢other sideâ and the latter won. From
West Oakland, where lives an army of
railroad employes, to the Tesla coal
mines, where hundreds of black-handed
but white-hearted miners tunnel in the
bowels of the earth, the principles of
Maguire have been repudiated, and Ala
meua's thousands of workingmen voted
in accordance with their best interests.
This feeling permeated the Congres
sional, .Legislative and county ticket. In
the next Legislature Alameda's six As
semblymen and three Senators will be Re
publicans. In the next Congress this dis
trict will be represented by a Republican.
The county government rests with the
Republicans. It is true there has been a
break in the county ticket, which is en
tirely due to an error made at the San,
Leandro Convention, and which was
stated at the time in The Call as being
likely to defeat one or two candidates. It I
has defeated two. The nominations for
Recorder and Superintendent .of Schools
were both given to Berkeley candidates.
From "Washington Township came- one of
the most upright Republicans in the
county, Henry .Lynch. His solid I dele- [
gation asked that he be put upon the |
ticket for Superintendent of Schools. This |
request, reasonable as it was, was not |
granted, owing to the fact that the larger j
.Berkeley delegation had made a deal with j
other candidates. Mr. Lynch was left oft,
and both of the Berkeley candidates, Mr.
Spear for Recorder and Mr. Waterman
for School Superintendent, have been de
feated. Mr. Grim, the next Recorder, is
a Republican, but made an independent
campaign when he saw that he could not j
get the nomination from the convention. |
Being a resident of Berkeley, his attitude j
helped largely to defeat the two candi- j
dates of the college town. . : ii
It is also gratifying to note that the Re- j
publican party in Alameda County can j
come together solidly, even after a bitter i
factional struggle. This is evident by the '
remarkable majority given to Victor H.
Metcalf for Congress. The bitterest fac
tional struggle this county has ever seen
was that between Metcalf and Hilborn for I
the nomination for Congress. After the |
primary, however, unanimity again en- i
tered the party ranks and Mr. Metcalf
yesterday ran probably 3000 votes ahead of I
his ticket.
The vote of this county also repudiates
the falsehoods of the fusionists regarding
the alleged stuffing of the great register,
said great register being the work of a
Republican County Clerk. It was stated
by the organ of the fusionists day after
day that there were nearly ten thousand
stuffers of the great register. Any or
dinary person knew that these ten thou
sand names were all duplicated, being
merely transfers, cancellations or new
registrations compiled In a special supple
ment, as the Board of Supervisors did not
feel justified in ordering an entire new
register, as Clerk Jordan compiled such a
perfect one but two years ago. The refu
tation of this campaign calumny is the
county's vote, which is exactly the same
as four years ago, namely, 20.000.
This morning the organ of the fusionists
claimed that the fact that the 10,000 Im
aginary stuffers did not vote was entirely
due to the vigilance of Chairman Tarpey
of the County Union Committee. It was
due to the fact that these 10,000 names
had no existence and that the Republican
Board of Supervisors appointed such rep
utable boards of election officers that no
evil-minded person could violate the in
tegrity of the ballot. Assumption of vir
tue, however, is the least of the vices
practiced by the fusionists in this cam
paign. .
Hereafter, It is evident, the people of
Alameda County will pay less attention
than they have in the past to the reports
of grand juries when it is more than sus
pected that such reports are impregnated
with the flavor of politics. The last Grand
Jury report, which was supposed to rep
resent the costly result of ten months'
labor, complimented Supervisor Church in
one place and then devoted large -sections
toward heaping obloquy and humiliation
on him and Supervisor Talcott. This re
port was taken up by th*e fusionists and
made the subject of foundationless and
bitter attacks on the Republican Super
visors who were candidates for re-e.ec
tion. These attacks have been repudiated
in the most decisive manner by intelligent
voters at the polls. The height of absurd
ity and falsity was rtm-hea when honest
John Talcott was made to appear as a dis
honest political manipulator, false to his
trust and unfit to hold office. Day after
day he was held up as a man to be avoid
ed "and as one to be kept as far away from
the county treasury as possible. He now
enjoys the satisfaction of knowing that
he has been re-elected by a handsome ma
jority over his oponent.
Supervisor Church was also subjected to
far more bitter denunciation than *vlr.
Talcott. This opposition apparently helped
to re-elect him. and Messrs. Church and
Talcott will hold their seat.s for another
four years.
Alamtda. County during the past twen
ty-four hours has definitely reasserted her
proud claim to be the banner county of
the party in California.
Suicide of William W. Laurie.
William W. Laurie committed suicide
last Tuesday night by cutting his throat
with a razor. His body was found in his
room in the Poplar House. 704^ Mission
street, yesterday morning by his land
lady. The deceased had been addicted to
the use of morphine, and for that reason
his wife was granted a divorce about a
year ago. He had been sick for a few
days before his death, and his ex-wife
called to see him yesterday with some
delicacies for him. She received no reply
to her knock, and she summoned the
landlady, who ordered the door forced
open. A bloody razor was found by the
side of the dead man.
The deceased was an attendant in a
bathing establishment. He was born in
Edinburgh, Scotland, and was aged 49
years.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 9.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Mei-ald tele
graphs: Aa the result of yesterday's
i elections It is the expectation of high
officials of the administration that
Spain will struggle more determinedly
against compliance with the American
demands for the cession of the Philio
! pines. Further than this it Ls believed
â  the losses sustained by the Republican
; party will have the effect of strength
ening Spain's appeals to other Euro
pean powers to intervene, and her
chances of success In doing so now are
considered a great deal better than
they were before the country gave its
verdict at the polls.
The administrate >:i fears were
shown by the discussion at the Cabi
net meeting to-day that Europe will
regard the elections as Indicating that
many Americans are opposed to the
extension of American territory, and
! France, Germany and Russia will feel
encouraged to make a representation
of some character to the Government.
I am able to state authoritatively,
I however, that whether Europe thinks
! the elections have gone against the ad
| ministration, it is the set purpose of
I President McKinley to continue to
â¢ press his demand for the cession of the
I Philippine Islands to the United
I States, and he will not be frightened
i into withdrawing his demands by any
representation that combined Europe
might make.
The authorities do not forget that
j the Senate Is Republican, and it is
I hoped It will furnish sufficient votes,
with the aid of certain Democrats and
Silverites, to provide the necessary
two-thirds majority to ratify the
treaty of peace which will be sent to
that body as soon as possible after it
convenes.
Furthermore, It was pointed out to
me this afternoon that for three months
at least the House will continue under
Republican domination, and during
' that period every effort will be made by
j the administration to conclude all nego
1 tiations growing out of the war in or
1 der that it may have a clean bill when
: adjournment occurs. The administra
i tion is extremely suspicious of the atti
tude of Continental Europe, and has
reason to believe that there has been
an exchange of views for the purpose of
determining whether to make represen
tations, and what their character
should be.
France's action in filing claims for her
citizens for moneys due them on account
of Spanish bonds floated ostensibly for
Cuba, is regarded as an Indirect
method of notifying the administration
of France's great concern in the nego
tiations, and of her Intention to hold
the United States responsible for the
debt on the ground that it always fol
lows sovereignty. But France will
make a great mistake if she thinks the
President and Secretary Hay propose
to pay any attention to her claims. The
State Department has notified the
French Embassy that the claims have
been received and filed, and will stay
filed. The United States has not taken
Cuba, and has no intention of so doing,
and therefore cannot be held responsi
ble for the Spanish debt.
It is understood here that France and
Austria will willingly intervene pro
vided Russia and Germany will com
bine with them to this end. but no ap
prehension is felt that Great Britain
will join them. It is believed the Brit
ish Government would support the
United States against the combined
European powers.

REPUDIATES SOME DEBTS
THEX VOTES TO RECONSIDER
THE SAME.
The Mission High School Accepted
Despite Changes Which Had
Been Made in the Speci
fications.
The Board of Education held its regular
meeting yesterday afternoon, following
â¢the usual se-ciet caucus in one of the ante
rhambers. Ten members of the board were
on hand as early as 3 o'clock, which was
more than sufficient for a quorum, but
there was a private scheme to be ar
ranged In committee of the whole con
cerning the unpaid bills which the Grand
Jury is Inquiring iabout at the present
lime. Accordingly the members of the
board quietly slipped away from the of
fice of the clerk into a private room ad
joining, reporters for the newspapers be
ing barred out, and proceeded to discuss
tne debts which are threatening to cause
50 much trouble.
It was soon ascertained that President
Harrington and several others were
averse to ordering bills paid at the pres
snt stage of affairs, not caring to Increase
the acKnowledged Indebtedness of the
Doard, v.-hile Gallagher; Bantel and Wal
er were emphatic in their statements that
lil bills must be allowed and ordered paid
cvithout delay. Reaching no conclusion
Ihe committee of the whole adjourned
and the board at once met in the pres
ence of the reporters and halt" i: dozen
school hers.
A motion was made that ail audited
Dills, which had been Incurred through
:ontracts made by the board, should be
ordered paid. Care was taken In this
resolution to omit any statement as to the
fc.ggreÂ»ate amount â â¢: the sums due on
.hf-se accounts, but it is understood to be
i bout 512,000, chiefly for supplies, etc.
This resolution was pass< : by ;. vote of 7
;o 3, whereupon Gallagher moved that all
nher bills of every description be also or
lored paid. No statement was offered as
:o what- these other bills are, not even an
intimate of I heir aggregate ing in evl
lence. The resolution was voted down, li
:o 4. Then there was plenty of trouble.
Dr. Hasan moved that the clerk of the
>oard notify all creditors whose claims
lad been rejected that thÂ« v could go to
aw. or do any old thing that they pleased
0 collect their money. ' _
Mr. Carew attempted to rule the mo
rion out of order, but Ragan protested
:hat it was legitimate, Inasmuch as the
Board had repudiated its just debts. He
.lien. "charged President Barrington with
laving surreptitiously held back a num
>er of bills which the board had ordered
raid three weeks ago, all of the bills hav
r.g been resented by the Committee on
Supplies. He wanted to know on what
tuthority the president was acting.
Barrington replied that he had held back
.ho bills in question pending an investiga
tion. He wanted to know by what right
he Committee on Supplies had expended
arge sums of money in fitting up the
luditorium of the Mission High School
md had purchased twice as many type
writing machines for the school as" the
ward had directed. He thought that there
lad been gross extravagance, and under
ihe circumstances he had thought best

W. E. Turner, "The King of Rep
tiles," Treated at the Receiving
Hospital.
W. IS. Turner, who styles himself the
"King of Reptiles," waa bitten on the
finger by a rattlesnake at the Chutes
yesterday afternoon. He sucked his in
jured finger and hurried to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Bunner bled and cau
terized the wound.
Turner and an assistant were removing
the snakes from one cage to aaiother.
Alter they had all been removed except
an old rattler, which was lying on a piece
Of rock. Turner took hofd of it by the
back of the neck with his left hand. The
snake managed to wriggle his head
around and bit Turner on the forefinger.
When Turner reached the hospital his
hand was puffed up and his arm was be
ginning to swell. He treated the bite
with apparent indifference, as he said he
had often been bitten by snakes. At first
he refused to swallow wnisky, but was
prevailed upon to do so.
PROFESSOR KELLOGG'S
RESIGNATION ACCEPTED
BERKELEY WILL SOON HAVE A
NEW PRESIDEitfT.
University Board of Regents Hold
Their Regular Monthly Meet
ing â Routine Business
Transacted.
At the meeting of the Board of Regents
of the State University yesterday after
noon the monotony of the proceeding's
was enlivened when the question of the
acceptance of President Martin Kellogg's
resignation came up.
Regent ITallidie -wanted the matter to
;ro over until the January meeting. At
thia the Governor became quite spirited,
for It waa plain to be seen that it was in
1 to shut him out of the participa
tion of the honors of appointing a new
; *nt. He said that the matter of the
:eptanee had been postponed once from
1 â¢ctober meeting, and he earnestly
made a plea that it be taken up at once
The Question was settled by the board
going Into executive session, and a lively
discussion followed, in which Hallidie
Rodgers and the Governor took part. Fi
nally the resignation was accepted, and
Kellogg was thereupon appointed emer
itus professor of Latin. His successor will
>Ã¼bt be appointed at the December
meeting, and will assume the duties of his
office on March 1, 1899, on which date the
resignation will take effect.
President Kellogg submitted his month
ly report, in which he stated that F. H.
Flood, senior in the College of Mining,
was appointed to succeed K. C. Daniels
In the scholarship from the Fifth Con
gressional District. Daniels was given a
position in the department of chemistry.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1898.
ESCAPADES AT
FORT BAKER
INVESTIGATED
Lieutenant Bennett's
Secret Inquiry.
HILARITY IN THE MESS TENT
AN OFFICER'S RESIGNATION IS
LOOKED FOR.
The Matters of Pure Food and the
Improper Conduct of the Can
teen Are Being Looked
Into.
The vigorous investigation Into the al
leged breaches of discipline practiced by
the army officials stationed at Fort Baker
has caused a deal of trepidation on the
part of the men accused and it is rumored
that at least one of them Intends to re
sign. The investigation was continued
yesterday and the examination of the
twenty or more witnesses called to testify
is asserted to have been of a decidedly
racy nature.
Lieutenant Bennett went to the post
yesterday In the Government boat Mc-
Dowell and returned at 5 o'clock. The
strictest secrecy was maintained afid even
the driver of the post wagon had' a com
panion along when he had to go to Sausa
lito in order to make sure that his lips
should remain padlocked.
What the witnesses stated cannot be
learned, but It Is to be supposed that they
gave substantially the same factÃ as they
have imparted to others. Sergeant Bern
ard was subjected to rigid questioning as
regards the food given the men and Ser
geant Breeding was asked to tell all he
knew concerning the actions of the women
present in camp last Thursday evening.
The men assert that the women In ques
tion were at the camp about ten days
previous to this occasion, and at that
time lunched In the mess tent; that a
quantity of beer was taken to the tent,
ar.d that in a short time the result was
tersely summarized as a "warm time"
by one of the privates doing sentry duty.
Two of these women are. said to live
at a lodging-house on Ninth street, near
Market. It is stated further by eye-wit
nesses that as retreat was sounded last
Thursday one of these women rode a
horse, up and down in front of the line
in the fashion commonly affected by the
sterner sex, and that for a short time
another sat on a horse with Lieutenant
Sprague.
Captain Choynski has said that he
knows the names of none of these women,
but there are several persons who are wil
ing to swear to the fact that on the same
day Lieutenant Thede brought the trio
into Sausalito in a buggy, where they
were met by the gallant captain, who
then proceeded to hire a buggy out of a
stable and take one of them for a spin.
While the men were on their way from
amp at Larkspur back to the post
a few days ago First Sergeant Breeding
voluntarily removed from his arm the
diamond which was his insignia of office,
and thereby reduced himself to the rank
of a private. The reason given for this
was the alleged overbearing conduct of
Lieutenant Huie.
The non-commissioned officers assert
that the canteen has rendered no ac
counting yet for the month of September
and that there are outstanding bills for
that month. It was asserted by one of
these officers yesterday that any e-nlisted
man has a right to look over the books at
any time, but none of them has ever
been permitted to do so.
A most important fact, a fact which
Clearly demonstrates that Lieutenant
Bennett believes the evidence given war
rants a court-martial, is that yesterday
he was accompanied by a stenographer,
who took down the testimony of all the
witnesses.
It is variously estimated that the can
teen should have on hand a surplus of
from 54000 to $6000. The feeling that pre
vails is shown by the change in the diet
of the men since the investigation be
gan. Beginning with last Friday evening
the men have frequently had fresh meat
at and a few delicacies.
Private Shaffer has been In the habit
.king his own meals rather than en
dure the regular fnre of the post. Yes
terday morning he was incarcerated in
the guard house for replying to some
caustic remark of S* rgeant Bernard. At
noon he was sent simply a dish of soup
for dinner. It is alleged, anrl being unable
to eat it had to do without anything.

everything quiet at Honolulu. The Bel
gic, which was about nine hours bohin<!
the Australia on the outward trjp, had

A HOODOO BRIDGE.
The N arrow-Gauge Train Is Again
Derailed.
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â The last narrow
pause train to San Francisco which
leaves here at 11:45 was derailed at the
new Harrison street drawbridge and both
the narrow and broad gauge trains were
tied up for some time.
The accident occured at the same place
as that of a week ago. It is the switch
where the track is fitted to both broad
and narrow gauge, and if it Is opened too
soon or too late part of the train will be
on either track. This occurred to-night,
and part of the narrow gauge train was
derailed. The passengers to the city were
detained some time, and those by the last
boat were forced to wait at the Alameda
mole The Alaineda broad gauge from
the pier also . crosses the bridge, and it
also was delayed. Although the new
bridge has only . been open two months
several accidents have occurred.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â A special
to the Star from Wilmington, N. C,
gives the details of a mass meeting of
600 citizens of that city held at the
Courthouse there to-day "to assert the
supremacy of the white man." Ex-
Representative Waddell presided and
read a series of resolutions reciting the
determination of the white citizens to
forever rule the city and to commence J
the work immediately; also declaring j
that hereafter white labor should be
given preference over colored, and call
ing for the banishment of Alex Manley,
the negro newspaper publisher, who
printed an objectionable editorial re
cently. An amendment was offered
calling on the Mayor, Chief of Police I
and Board of Aldermen to vacate their !
offices now instead' of waiting until j
their terms expired in March.
These resolutions were referred to a
committee, and while those present
were awaiting its report several j
speeches were made, one of the speak- I
ers, Representative-elect Bellamy, urg- ,
ing the expulsion of Manley in twelve
hours, but counseling moderation in
other respects. The committee soon
reported its conclusions favoring the
expulsion of Manley as proposed, urg- (
ing the employment of white labor as i
far as possible and favoring a resolu- !
tion setting forth that the Mayor and
acting Chief of Police have demon
strated their incapacity and that their
continuance in office being a menace
they should resign. The report was
unanimously adopted and a commlttea
of twenty-five was appointed to carry
out the resolutions adopted.
It is understood that Manley has al
ready left the city. The Mayor and
Chief of Police say they will not resign,
as the resolutions call for, but will
serve out their terms.

PICKPOCKETS
MINGLE WITH
THE CROWDS
Three Arrests Made
by the Police.
"KID" YOUNG ONE OF THEM
HE STOLE A BUCKSKIN PURSE
FROM P. J. THOMAS.
Handed It to a Well-Known Saddler,
Evidently Mistaking Him
for One of His
"Pals."
A number of pickpockets mingled with
the crowds In front of the newspaper of
fices Tuesday night and piled their ne
farious business. The arrest of one of
them about 11 o'clock in front of The Call
office caused considerable excitement
among tht! crowd.
P. J. Thomas, printer, at 419 Sacra
mento street, was watching the bulletin
board when he felt a hayd in his pocket.
He turned around and saw a man disap
pearing in the crowd. Detective Egan
also saw the thief and started in pursuit
through the crowd. He recognized him
as George Young, known as "th<? Kid,"
a notorious pickpocket, and observing
that he carried something in his hand,
Egan yelled to some one to take it from
him.
Young In his desperation shoved a buck
skin purse, which he had stolen from
Thomas, into the hand of J. O'Kane, a
saddler on Golden Gate avenue, as he was
passing him, and whispered to the aston
ished O'Kane:
"Run, you sucker, run."
Young was finally captured by Egan and
taken to the City Prison, where he was
put on the "small book."
About half an hour after Young had
been locked up O'Kane called at the
prison and asked Desk Sergeant Brown If
a pickpocket had been arrested. The ser
geant, mindful of his duty not to give up
the secrets of the "small book," told him
that no such charge had been preferred
against any one, and O'Kane walked
away: "When he got outside he told a
friend that a man bad shoved a buckskin
purse into his hand and on opening it he
found it contained $140 in gold. He thought
the man had been arrested, as he saw him
being pursued through the crowd.
Yesterday morning O'Kane called at
police headquarters and handed over the
purse and its contents. He was taken to
the prison and identified Young as the
man who had shoved it into his hand and
told him to run. Later in the day Thomas
visited headquarters and reported the loss
of his purse. He described accurately
its contents and was delighted to find
that it was safely in the hands of the
police.
As the evidence against Young was com
plete he was booked on a charge of grand
larceny. He is an old-timer, but has
been very fortunate In escaping punish
ment on several occasions.
Detectives Egan and Byram also arrest
ed two other pickpockets for the protec
tion of the crowd. They were J. H. Con
nors, alias "Chaw" Connors, and Richard
H.Fould. Connors was yesterday booked on
a charge of vagrancy, but Foultl is still In
â¢'the tanks."

an ardent lover of fishing, and the hike

cently he discovered a stranger fish
ing in the lake. Jim didn't know It.
but the stranger had been fishing all
day, and had caught nothing.
"Are you aware that this lake is pri
vate, a'hd that you are not permitted
to catch fish in it? asked Colonel Fen-
nessy.
"I'm not catching your fish," said the
stranger. "I'm feedinp 'em."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â The market was very ,
active and decidedly Irregular during the morn
ing session on the Stock Exchange and at one j
. time the list took on quite uniform evidences j
of strength and even buoyancy. But by 12:30 j
o'clock the demand for securities seemed sat- j
isfied and the market fell Into dullness and a
somewhat reactionary tendency, which hoisted
to the clouds. London, In spite of the dull- |
ness and heaviness of the general market, hal '
confidently marked up prices of Americana yes- i
terday and to-day while the New York Ex- j
change was not In session. The British inter- !
pretation and understanding of the American
elections, always more or less obscure and con
fused, probably prompted them to do this. The
opening here did not fully respond, prices
showing below the London parity. The inter
national arbitrage brokers seized this opportu
nity to cover sales made at a higher level In
London. A number of the Internationale sagged '
quite sharply Immediately after the opening, i
notably St. Paul, New York Central and the i
Pacifies. The buying for London account was (
the determining factor In rallying these stocks |
and carrying the whole market to a higher j
level. Even sugar, which opened down a I
point, scored a full recovery.
The commission houses are busy with buying .
and selling orders and large operators actively I
bid up their favorites. With the cessation of '
London buying about noon and with a re
newed break in sugar, which had proved a !
heavy load to carry all morning, prices began !
to drop off. the decline in the railroads ranging !
all the way from a fraction to 1% i<er cent. I
In the market leaders among the railroads, |
however, there was little effect produced
either by the above factors or by the late weak- !
ness in Manhattan, which fell 2%. Sugar con- j
tinued its downward course to the extent of
2% points and closed near the lowest. The an
nouncement of the cut in the product and the
output of new refineries coming to the market
â was the cause of the weakness, and the bears !
â were also active, judging from the high loaning j
rate tor the stock. The weakness of Manhattan !
was associated with the stockholders' annual I
meeting, although the yearly statement of earn
ings, showing 4.16 per cent earned for the
stock, was better than Wall street had ex
pected. In the railroad list, however, the clos
ing was generally steady and at net gains, j
which reached a point in some cases.
The band market continued active and strong j
and the 4 per cent issue added to the notably j
active list were the Louisville unified bonds and
â¢ the Kansas and Texas, St. Louis and San Fran- |
Cisco and Denver and Rio Grande. A number â .
of the speculative bonds, including the Atch- I
Ison adjustments, the Oregon Short Line income
Issues and the Texas and Pacific seconds, were
also active and strong. Total sales, $5,715,000.
United States new 4's, the old 4's registered j
and the 3's coupon advanced V while the 2's j
declined >â¢Â« and the s's coupon % per cent In

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YOF.K, Nov. 9.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:
The stock markets here opened good on the
better political outlook and lapsed on the rise
in the German bank rate, but finally closed
good. The Premier's speech to-night has been
freely discussed In anticipation, but the stock
exchange expectation Is either that no import
ant announcement will be made or else that it
will be a generally favorable speech. The set
tlement shows a small account, and although
money was comparatively high, contangoes
were moderate because of a shortness in the
supply of stocks. Contangoes on Americana
were about 5 cents. Americans were strong on
the reported Republican successes in the elec
tions.
There was buying both for English account
and for the Continent. The activity in the
Iter'.in Bourse waa checked, however, by the
rit^- In the German bank rate, which Is now
at the highest point since the Baring crisis in
1 opper stocks were booming, the buy
ing being largely from Paris and being based
on the statistiral position of copper. Spanish
exchange has fallen sharply to 33, against 38
last week.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 9.â There was plenty of news
of a bullish character at the opening in wheat
I to justify the %c advance with which that
I market started, The opening price for May
\ was 66%'gÂ«6 J ,50. It weakened .p. trifle shortly
after the opening, a few sales being made at
' 66U@6f-%c. But this was only temporary. Un
j der a fairly strong demand from shorts and a
1 moderate amount of investment buying the
price advanced pretty steadily for over an
hour, finally getting up to 67c. * There was a
] marked scarcity of offerings during this time,
j but at the best the demand was only moderate.
I The strength was mostly due to an advance oX
! Liverpool of 1%Â®1%d over Monday's figures,
] and notwithstanding the fact that English con
i sols were strong, traders looked upon the Liv-
I erpool advance as an Indication of uneasiness
i over the political situation. Their belief was
I strengthened by Intimations that Lord Salis
; bury's speech to-night would De sensational.
Broomhall cabled that the strength at Liver
pool was partly due to scarcity of spot wheat.
After the advance to 67c the market became
exceptionally dull, though the price was well
! maintained for some time. During the after
! noon, however, it eased off somewhat, though
i no weakness developed. May closed %@%c ad
vance.
Corn was slow but' firm. There was a good
[ cash demand and thi3 with the wet weather
1 and higher cables made bears cautious. Heavy
shorts were good buyers, demand from this
source being the feature of the trading. May
closed %@%c higher. The market for oats was
! uneventful. Prices were steady at a small ad
j vance, bad weather in Illinois and sympathy
; with wheat and corn being the leading fac-
I tors. Trading was very small and price fluc
j tuations insignificant. Receipts were 363 cars.
i May advanced Vie.
Provisions were dull and heavy throughout.
I A decline in hog prices started the market at
j a small decline and moderate selling pressure
from packers with no demand of consequence
forced prices steadily downward. The market
1 was at Its weak spot at the close.

THE BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Nov. 9. â The Improvement noted m
the wool market here the last week has con
tinued and the sales in this market are re
ported at over 12,000,000 pounds^ the bulk of
which has gone to manufacturers. The ma
jority of sales are largely of territory grades.
The prices obtained range all the way from
the basis of 42ft 46c for scoured tine medium
and fine and 471i500 for staple. Fleece wools
also met with some sales. Quotations: Terri
tory woolsâ Montana line medium and fine, 14Â®
17c; scoured, 45"550 c; staple, 4S@soc. Utah,
Wyoming, etc., fine medium and fine, 14015 c;
scoured, 44(&45c; staple, 470480. Australian-
Scoured basis, combing superfine, 70&72 c; good,
, average, 62@66c
The American Wool and Cotton Reporter will
Bay to-morrow of the wool market:
There has been a good business transacted
In the wool market durine the past week, al
though the sales are considerably less than the
very large total reported during the preceding
week. There has, however, been considerable
looking around, and as a result we are able to
report sales of 4,250,U>0 pounds. The market,
aside from these negotiations, has been fairly
active, especially on territories, which are
more sought for than any other line of do
mestic wools.
The tune of the market, so far as prices are
concerned, is now quite steady on the basis
of prices given last week. It is a mistake to
suppose that there is any demoralization in
the wool market or that any great (jump in
values has occurred. The sales of the week
In Boston amount to 3,490.000 pounds domestic
and 750.5C0 foreign, making a total of 4.280.500
pounds, against a total of 9.058,000 for the
previous week and a total of 5,137,000 for the
corresponding week last year. Sales since
January 1. IS9S, amount to 10fi.506,010 pounds,
against 335,636,100 last year at this time.

P. I. Co. Forced to

PARTITION SUIT ADJUSTED
THE NEW STEEL BRIDGE THE
INDIRECT CAUSE.
The City Fortunately HeVi the Land
Upon Which the Approaches
Had to Be Con
structed.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 9.â ln a few days pa- j
pers will be filed giving this city undis- |
jiuted title to a valuable water front fac
ing Oakland harbor. The litigation over
the marsh land and water front will then
be settled. Indirectly the completion of
the new steel railroad bridge over the |
eetuary forced the Pacific Improvement '
Company to come to terms with the city |
In partitioning tne disputed territory.
There are over 150 claimants to the Ala- j
meda marsh land. Some years ago, when j
the Pacific Improvement Company com- |
menced an action to partition the prop
erty, the city authorities, in order to
make a showing in court, seized a strip
uf fourteen acres between Webster street
and the railroad tracks leading to the
Alice street bridge. An old scow was
run Into a slough and scuttled in such
a position that, it might be used as a
â¢wharf. This was considered an "im
provement" in the eyes of the law, and
was dune to strengthen Alameda'a claim
to the propert>.
Both the narrow gauge and broad
pauge approaches to the new steel bridge
had to pass over this piece ofTnarsh land.
When the railroad commenced to con
struct the embankments the city called
a halt. Neither the Pacific Improvement
Company nor the Alameda authorities
yere anxious for expensive litigation, so
it was agreed that tne representatives of
tach should come together and endeavor
to effect a compromise.
The land claimed by Alameda was prac
tically worthless to the city from the
fact that it was hemmed In by three
drawbridges, making it useless for dock
age purposes; but it was valuable to the
railroad company for the reason that
they had to have it. Taking advantage
of this Alameda was In a position to dic
tau- the terms of the" settlement. And
its representatives got a great deal the
Lest of the transaction.
Over 150 parties had undivided Interests
in the marsh land. Alameda's proportion
it te share was fourteen acres of land and
I'xi feet of water front. Under the stipula
tion by which the city releases its claim
to the strip between the two bridges it
will receive title to fifteen acres of land
Â«nd 1176 feet of water front In one of the
l.fst locations on the estuary. There are
960 feet of frontage between Wood and
Prospect streets and 216 feet between
Grand and Schiller streets. The fifteen
acres includes a ten-foot strip of land
along all of the city sewers passing over
the marsh, j-^e Pacific Improvement
Company also agrees to donate sufficient
property to widen the Webster-street
roadway to eighty feet as soon as the
city is prepared to undertake the improve
ment. All parties in interest have agreed
to the terms of the stipulation.
The engineers are now preparing maps
of the property, and as soon as they are
completed the attorneys will prepare a
form of decree and ask the court to render
judgment in the partition suit in accord
ance with the .stipulation.
There is already talk of constructing
wharves on the city's water front. City
Attorney Taylor states that the matter
will l;e entirely 6ettled before the end of
November. __^_^__^____
ANOTHER HEIR FOR THE
LANDS OF CHRISTENSEN
SISTER OF A HERMIT IS FOUND
IN xAR IOWA.
Christensen's Estate Once Claimed
by a Man Who Declared He
Found a Will Under a
Table Cover.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Nov. 9.
Andrew Krough of Hay wards stands
very little chance of getting the fortune
left by the old hermit, Peter Chrlstensen,
who died Intestate on his ranch in San '
Joaquin County a few months ago. The.
attorneys who have been seeking absent
heirs have discovered a sister of Christen
een, who now lives in lowa. Her power of
attorney to Messrs. Delegh and Beards
lee has been filed with the County Clerk
at Stockton.
Peter Christensen was brought up by An
drew Krough's father and he frequently
stated that he had left his estate, which
is quite valuable, to Krough's children.
Cnristensen died suddenly and no will
could be found. A couple of months af
ter his death a ranch hand on one of the
Christensen ranches claimed to have
discovered the missing testament. The
discovery was said to have been made
beneath an old table cover that had not
been removed for years. The alleged will
consisted of an old silver Treasury note,
on one side of which was some writing
uhich purported to give to the finder and
to a few charities the whole of the Chris
tensen properties.
Much doubt was expressed in regard to
the so-called will's authenticity and by
some attorneys it was openly declared to
te a forgery. It was never presented for
probate and the finder has as yet made
no demand for the estate.
Krough doubts the existence of the sis
ter paid to be now living in lowa. He had
knows Ohristf-p.sen for a lifetime and he
does not think he has a sister in this
country or in any other. Krough's at
torneys have a letter from the Mayor of
the town in Germany where the Christen
fens used to live and it may help to estab
lish thg identity of the latest claimant.
LOVE'S IMPATIENCE.
E. D. Osborn Obtains a Marriage Li
cense at Midnight to Wed None
Vincent.
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â Edward Donald !
Osborn, an unassuming: young man of ;
San Francisco, created a slight sensa- i
tion in the Alameda County Clerk'a of- j
fice, one minute after last midnight.
Oeborn stepped up to Cupid's desk yes
terday and applied for a marriage license i
to wed Miss None Vincent, also of San !
Francisco and aged 23. Deputy County |
clerk Charles Arnold advised the young:
lover that on account of election day he !
could not legaflv issue the license.
"Really it would be illegal to issue this
license to-day," said the deputy. "You
Fee. if it was but one minute past 12 to
night that'd be to-morrow, and then it
would be all right."
"It would? Well, all right," and with
thla reply the young fellow departed sud
denly. At just 12:01 this morning, while
Arnold was enjoying a nap between the
arrivals of ..the election returns, Osborn!
appeared before the desk and without j
further argument obtained his much- !
sought-for licenso.
Before breakfast he appeared before a â 
Mfethodist minister with his sweetheart ;
and the knot was tied.

f<>r $50 000 dameges and obtained a verdict
ior $12,000, but defendant was granted a

when a car came along and mangled their
bodies horribly.

horst, through her attorney, J. E. Mc-
Elroy, to-day commenced an action for di
vorce against Herman Bornhorst, alleg
ing extreme cruelty as the ground. The

Famous Case Closing.
OAKLAND, Nov. aâ The famous water
front retrial suit bids fair to close to
morrow. Such at least was the under
standing arrived at by the attorneys.

tion the entire day. It will be probably
a month or six weeks before a decision
is handed down. â¢
IN THE JAWS OF DEATH.
The Remarkable Escape of a Berke
ley Wagon-xhiver.
BERKELEY, Nov. 9.â By what seems
almost a miracle, Joseph Mango, a wagon
driver, came out unharmed from an acci
dent this morning, which in nine cases
out of ten would have resulted fatally.
Mango was driving down Addison street
near Third, and was struck by the locaJ
train from Martinez.
The horses were killed outright by the
locomotive, the pole of the wagon being
wrenched out of place and carried awa.>
at the same time. The rest of the wagon
was left standing, the driver remaining ir
his seat and coming out of the accioem
unhurt.
Miss Wilson's Play Accepted.
BERKELEY, Nov. yâ Miss Minnie Rac
Wiison has won the competition for the
curtain raiser to be given next junior da>
by the junior class uf the University ol
California. Five plays were handed in foi
the contest, that of Miss Wilson being
finally selected by the judges. The play
centers upon a phase of college fraternity
life and is full of local coloring. The suc
cessful author is a member of the edi
torial staff of the 1900 Blue and Gold.
Kaarsberg Out of Danger.
BERKELEY. Nov. 9.â Peter Kaeirsberg,
Berkeley's fullback, is now declared by
his physician to be out of danger. The
tried veteran of the gridiron developed
symptoms of blood-poisoning toward the
latter part of last week and has been
forced to confine himself to the training
quarters for four or five days. It was
feared at first that the malady misht
prove serious enough to prevent his play
ing with the big team next Thanksgiving
day. A marked improvement in his condi
tion gives hope that he may yet be on the
field again in time for the great game.
But the prospect for this is even now
very doubtful, and some of the football
men fear that a substitute will have to be
sought for.

Jingle Proves to Be a Fast
Fillyâ Detailed Re
sults. Â»
The members of the galloping division
raced to a rather light gate at Oakland
yesterday, many enthusiasts of the same
apparently being more wrapped up in the
election returns than in the outcome of
the different running events. And ...en
the card was not an appetising one, which
fact did not heip matters any.
The sport itself was of the fatiguing
j sort. Five favorites were laid away to
; rest, with a long string of the talent act
; ing as mourners. The ceremony was brief
| but impressive. The ring finally had a
â¢ day.
The crowd accepted 7 to 5 against Little
'. Sister in the opening scramble at five fur
! longs, and looked as smiling as a poker
player with a "pat hand." Sister finished
; fourth, without ever looking dangerous.
Johnny Woods, on the 15 to 1 shot, Be
Happy, headed Jerilderio in the stretch,
and came in a clever winner over the last
named horse by half a length. Zem Zem,
with Rutter up, was a moderate third.
The next event was a sprint for tnree
year-olds, decided over the new Futurity
course, 170 feet less than six furlongs.
Engea, the Hums & Waterhouse entry,
was Kent to the post a meek 2 i 1 cbo(< c
over Jingle Ji::gle and Gler.gaber. and w.is
beaten in a common gallop by the farmer
â  fitly. The winner was as good as 4 to 1 in
: the betting. Shields evidently tried to
; i ate Glengaber, and made a bad mess of
I it, ending up an indifferent third.
The Texan turfman, G. W. Scott, won
1 the third purse with his erratic mare
i Juanita, against which 10 to 1 was laid.
: Gouin managed to beat the bunch away
: from the poet, and though she wante^l to
i stop badly through the stretch, lasted
long enough to beat the favorite. Little
Alarm, a head. If J. Relff, on the latter,
had not been pocketed next the rail over
half the distance it would have been easy
. sailing. ManzanlUa, hard ridden by
Deyiix, finished in the show.
The Prestonpans geldiag Plan had it all
his own way in the mile selling affair,
, leading from start to finish. He went to
; the post third choice and beat the 40 to 1
I shot, Magnus, two lengths, with conslder
i able to spare. The favorite, San Venado,
backed up in the betting, and finished
J third. Everson, on Inverary 11, the second
! choice, had an attack of wind colic or
paddock complaint, and finished last.
Ed Gartland was favorite for the final
six furlong run, with Houck on his back.
Piggott got Chihuahua, the second choice,
away first, and in a hard drive downed
the first choice a head. Sport McAllister
fell heir to third money.
Turf Gossip.
Ed. Lowcry, the well-known poolseller
and bookmaker of Chicago, accompanied
by Phil Hammill, the Butte. Mont., pen
â  ciler, were visitors at the track yester- j
day. It is their intention to book here in i
the near future.
Mike Hennessy's saddle work yesterday
would drive one to the conclusion that in \
early childhood he was reared by tender
hands to be a rough carpenter in later
life. Mike can ride, but his riding has
I borne a very uneven surface of late.
If it was the intention to rate G'.enga
ber; the youngster is a very poor rater.
There are' few instances of Henry Shields
winning a race from behind anyway.
The Baldwin horses are, as usual, hard
to catch. Celoso ran like a resuscitated
corpse, and San Venado, supposed to be a
$3500 piece of equine furniture, was beaten
by Magnus. If Mr. Baldwin would con
clude to send his entire stable to England,
where Mister Sloan, the ex-balloonist, is j
daily appearing with considerable suc
cess, there would be few wails and lam
entations go up from this side of the Sier- j
ras.
Some day In the near future when !
Frank Van Ness tires of riding Everson j
an indulgent public will again remember j
him as the owner of the mighty Morello I
(now dead), and perhaps back his horses. '.
But with ETverson up they will do to j
watch with the field-glasses reversed.
There are about six jockeys riding at ;
Oakland that could probably pass an ex
amination and be assigned a berth aboard j
the training ship Marion, and there ia
where they belong. Everson's ride on In- ]
verary II was not as glossy as the la
mented Patsy Duffy could furnish in his â¢
dilapidated days.
P F is a horse possessed of a highly i
cultivated bunch of speed, and if the |
judges would choose a rider for Monsieur
Clmppell some day the gelding would
very near win a purse. "Under the cir
cumstances he ran a highly creditable
race yesterday.

After Sheriff Rogers' Old Job.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 9.â Hardly had it be
come certain that Oscar Rogers, present
City Marshal of Alameda, had been elect
ed Sheriff, than a host of aspirants for
the position he will vacate began to make
their plans to capture the prize. 1:
will assume the duties of his new office
January 1, 1899. The Alameda city elec
tion will not be held until April, and in
the meantime the City Marshalship will
have to be filled by an appointment by the
City Trustees. Among those who aspire
to the position are Louis Schroeder,
Frank Hackett, Harry Transue, "William
Gunn George McÃae and Ralph Hamlin.
All of them will endeavor to get the ap
pointment from the Trustees, and it is
likely all of them will be candidates for
the position at the April election.

Reply to a Spanish
Protest.
INDEMNITY CLAIM IGNORED
COLLECTION OF CUSTOMS AT
MANILA JUSTIFIED.
American Peace Commissioners Dis
pose of All Points Raised by
Their Spanish Col
leagues.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 9. â To-day's session of
the Peace Commission began at 2:15
p. m. and ended at 3 p. m. When the
meeting opened the Americans present
ed to their Spanish colleagues the an-
swer of the United StateÃ to the claims
submitted on Saturday last on behalf
of Spain. The document in which the
American answer was set forth consist
ed of nearly fifty sheets of typewritten
matter. It was a refutation of the
Spanish allegation that because the
words "possession," "ownership" or
"cession" do not occur In the protocol
clause touching upon the Philippine Isl-
ands the Peace Commissioners have no
right to discuss them here, and that
even if they did so it must be in the
light of the alleged fact of an exterior
agreement that Spain's sovereignty
should not be impaired.
The Americans also answered Spain's
claim for the restitution to her of pub
lic money and customs collections
taken by United States officials since
the capitulation of Manila, and made
reply to Spain's claim for an indemnity
on account of the alleged imprisonment
by UniteoV States authorities of Span
ish troops at Manila and for their sub
sequent restraint from being of service
to Spain in the suppression of the In
surrection and the preservation of
property.
The American Commissioners in their
reply held that there was justification,
under the terms of the -rotocol, for the
discussion of the future of the Philip
pine Islands, and they also claimed
that the .occupation of Manila is a milU
tary occupation, which Justifies the
United States in collecting the rev
enues, administering the government
and exercising all the functions of pos
session.
MANGLED BY THE CARS.
Railroad Man's Awful Death in the
Oakdale Yards.
STOCKTON, Nov. 9.â Albert Conrady,
better known as "Doc" Conrady, met
death this morning in Oakdale >vhile
switc'ninp in the railroad yards. Ho was
a brakenaan on the Southern Pacific, and
was well known in this city, where lih re
sided. Ho was a son of Dr. Conrady, who
died a few years ago.
Conrady started toward a. train to meet
It as it came toward him. In some man
ner he slipped between the track and the
Iron frog, getting his foot caught, and
his efforts to free himself were unsuc
cessful. The train was bearing down on
him so fast that it was too late to stop
it and the unfortunate man was knocked
over by the pilot and mangled horribly.
His arms and legs were broken and his
hands and feet were cut off. His head
was crushed.
He leaves a widow in Stockton and a
mother and sister in Fort Wayne.
Stabbed by an Unknown Man.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.â J. W. Case
heere of Santa Barbara was murderously
assaulted last night, near his rooming
house in this city, by an unknown man.

What Cuba's Loss Means to Spain.
The loss of Cuba means to Spain the loss of
the very sustenance of the nation. Already
her tax ridden people are crying; for bread.
In the same way the loss of your once vigor
ous appetite means poverty and starvation to
your body. If any reader of .this paper wishes
to be as hungry again as when a child, and
wants to fully enjoy hearty meals, we can
recommend Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. It
cures Indigestion, dyspepsia anil constipation.

William Kennedy and General Wolse
ley responding for tlueir respective
forces, which were described as being
In a perfect state of preparedness to
meet any power disputing Great Brit
ain's Just claims.
The brevity of the speeches showed
that every one realized the general
anxiety to hear the Marquis of Salis
bury, who, on rising to respond to the
toast of "Her Majesty's Ministers," was
greeted with prolonged cheers. The
Premier began by saying that a suc
cession of events abroad had occa
sioned grave anxiety to the Ministry
for a year past. He alluded to the mur
der of the Empress of Austria for tbe
double purpose of expressing the uni
versal regret experienced on account of
the crime and for announcing that
Great Britain had accepted an invita
tion to take part in a conference which
would be called to determine upon the
measures which it is possible to take in
order to blot out anarchy.
The Marquis of Salisbury added that
at the same time he was bound to say
that he had no great hope that legis
lation would abate "this horrible, mon
strous affliction of humanity."
After referring in a laudatory manner
to the British campaigns in India and
in the Soudan, the Premier turned to
the Cretan question and the concert of
Europe. He said he was afraid that the
proceedings of the concert were. not
always admired. At the same time he
pointed out that "patient application,
combined with the moral strength of
Europe, has at least succeeded in ful
filling the promise to the Cretans of
giving them autonomy under the suzer
ainty of the Sultan."'
Continuing, the Premier remarked:
"The solution of this most difficult
problem has witnessed displays of
splendid and unexpected qualities and
diplomacy upon the part of the ad
mirals, who have successfully accom
plished what the Cabinets of Europe
had been unable to do. I have some
times thought that if the Cabinets were
all dismissed and admirals were in
stalled in their places, Europe would
get along better."
Turning to the crisis with France, the
Premier remarked: "We have had
quite recently to consider whether the
question of a European war was not
very near. But, with great interest
and consideration, the result has turned
out happily, through the great judg
ment and common sense displayed by
France under circumstances of unus
ual difficulty which, I think, have re
lieved Europe of a very dangerous and
threatening storm.
"While matters were in suspense, the
Government was necessarily forced to
tako precautions that it should not be
taken unawares. These precautions
were most prompt and effective, but
the immediate necessity for them has
passed off.
"There has been some surprise on
both sides of the channel at the fact
that thesÂ» preparations have not sud
denly ceased. But it is impossible to
stop them at a moment's notice."
After referring to the various rumors
of intended action arising out of these
preparations, including the seizure of
Syria and Crete and the declaration of
a protectorate of Egypt â the latter al
lusion being greeted with immense
cheering â Lord Salisbury continued:
"I am sorry to say I cannot rise to
the height of the aspirations indicated
by the cheering of the audience. I
do not venture to prophesy, if we are
forced by others into a position we do
not now occupy, what may occur; but
we are well satisfied with the existing
state of things and we do not think
any cause has arisen to modify it.
"The position causes occasional fric
tion, but, taking the situation as a
whole and considering the feeling of
other people as well as our own, \Ve
can reasonably rest for the present
with the existing state of affairs. I
must nut be understood as meaning that
Groat Britain's position in Egypt is the
same now as it was before the fall of
Omdurman, but we earnestly hope that
circumstances will not make it neces
sary materially to modify that position,
as we are convinced the world would
not set on so peaceably as now."
Referring again to the war prepara
tions and asking his hearers to look at
the state of the world, Lord Salisbury
observe!:
"The Czar has invited a congress to
provide for the disarmament of the
world, but while we offer our heartiest
tribute to his motives and are willing
to assist and sympathize in every wa>
until the happy day when his aspira
tions are crowned with success, we
must still provide precautions needful
to counteract the clangers surrounding
us. In some respects this era, this
great epoch in the history of man, is
marked by unhappy omens. It is the
first year in which the mighty force
of the American republic has been in*
troduced among nations whose domin
ions are expanding and whose instru
ments to a certain extent are war.
"I am not implying the slightest
blame. Far from it. I am not refusing
sympathy to the American republic in
the difficulties through which it has
passed; but no one can deny that its
appearance among factors Asiatic at
all events, and possibly in European
diplomacy, is a grave and serious event
which may not conduce to the interests
of peace, though I think in any event
it ie likely to conduce to the interests
of Great Britain. (Cheers.)
"But with this impressed upon us- is
that the subject matter of war is ter
ribly prevalent on all sides. We see
nations decaying, whose government is
so bad that it can neither maintain the
power of self-defense or retain the af
fections of its subjects, and when this
occurs there are always neighbors im
pelled by some motive â it may be the
highest philanthropy or it may be the
natural desire of empire â to contest as
to who shall be heir to the falling na
tion; and that is the cause of war."
Lord Salisbury then alluded to the
rapidity and unexpectedness with
which wars break out and said: "If
Great Britain ever permit her self-de
fenses to weaken her whole empire
would come clattering to the ground.
It is, therefore, impossible in the pres
ent state and temper of the world to
intermit our naval and military pre
j cautions."
He concluded by repudiating "all
J suggestions that the present prepara
j tions mean that the country is ani
i mated by the lust of conquest or a
love of wars." declaring that Great
Britain was only "resolved to main
tain the empire Britons have received
from their forefathers and to support
the peace which is the glory and sus
tenance of our empire."
A great ovation from the entire as
sembly marked the conclusion of the
Premier's speech.

NEXT HOUSE
A MATTER OF
DEEP CONCERN
Cabinet Members on
the Elections.
SECRETARY GAGE IS HOPEFUL
POSTMASTER-GENERAL SMITH
CONFIDENT.
McKinley's Policy Will Be Vindicat
ed Should the Claims of Re
publican Managers So
Sustained.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: In administration circles
the significance of yesterday's elections
is discussed with a carefully expressed
"if." Secretary Gape comes out frankly
and declares that he is not fully satis
fied by the information at hand thai
the Republicans have an actual major
ity in the House. It is true, he says,
that some very encouraging dispatches
from the West were received at the
White House to-day, which the Presi
dent exhibited at the Cabinet meeting.
Some of them were contradicted by
later reports, so that it is difficult to
base an intelligent opinion on a result
that has not yet been fully ascer
tained.
"If," said he, "the returns carry out
the claims which are made by the Re
publican managers, the result will be a
glorious vindication of the policy of
the administration, for it is a very un
usual occurrence for the party in power
to carry the House during an off year.
Under the circumstances I would pre
fer to wait until I am convinced that
we have won control of the House be
fore I proceed to comment upon the na
tional effect of yesterday's elections. I
might say something which would
sound considerably out of tune if it
should turn out that the Democrats
have captured the House."
Postmaster General Charles Emery
Smith is one of the members of the
Cabinet who seems to be confident that
the Republicans have not only secured
absolute control of the Senate, but he
is equally confident that the Republi
cans have a small but safe majority in
the House. He expresses his sincere
belief that yesterday's election was an
emphatic vindication of the strong,
courageous and practical policy of the
administration.
"Yesterday's election," said Post
master General Smith, "suggests the
thought that the people of the country
are willing to trust the administration
to take up the national problems which
now confront us. I regard the result as
a complete vindication of the adminis- I
tration. It also brings up the thought â
which renders it all the more remarka- \
ble when you stop to consider â that it i
is the first time since Grant's adminis
tration that an election held midway
in an administration has not gone
a.gainst the party in power. Many peo
ple have forgotten with what regularity
the party in opposition to the adminis
tration has continually controlled the
House In off years."
"Another important result of yester
day's election," continued Postmaster
General Smith, "was tho pricking of
the Populist bubble in the West, as
was ghown in Nebraska, Kansas and
other parts of the West.and also by the i
fact that sound money Democrats in |
the past went back to the Democratic I
camp. It likev/ise demonstrated that
the thinking people of the country are
disposed to give the present adminis- |
tration a fair opportunity to work out
the difficult problems which are bound .
to arise in connection with the recent
war and expansion of territory. Those
questions originated under this ad
ministration and naturally the present i
administration is better qualified to
carry out the projects under way and
meet the demands of the occasion than
an opposition not familiar with
all the details of the subject. Much of I
this important legislation will have to
be considered by the next Congress, for
the coming session will only last thr^e
months, and most of the time will be
required for appropriation bills and
other measures of a pressing nature.
"I hardly look for any consideratio
of the financial question during th
short term session, as most of the tim
will be takon up with money bills an
providing necessary legislation for th
government of the new territory we ar
about to acciuire or may have ac
quired."
Secretary Bliss and Attorney Genera
Griggs are naturally delighted with th
result of the election in their respec
ive States, but they are not disposed t
comment too freely on the general re
sult until they are convinced that the
Republicans have control of the House.
They are very cautious in their public
utterances, and they prefer to with
hold their statements as to the cause
and effect of the elections for a few
[ hours.
In speaking of the results of yester
i day's election, Secretary Bliss said: "I
am very much gratified with the tri
umph in New York, and that, I think,
is the re-eleceion of a Republican
House. My impression is that it is the
I first time since Grant's second term
I when in the middle of an adminlstra
| tion there has not been a change in the
i political majority in the House. It
, must therefore be regarded as a very
i emphatic Indorsement of the adminis
| tration, and is in keeping with the uni
versal expression of approbation all
over the country for the President and
j his administration six months ago and
: before partisanship lines began to be
drawn on the eve of election."
PLACER'S LANDSLIDE.
Republican State and County Tickets
Have a Walk-Over.
AT*BT T RN. Nov. 9. â Placer County
polled the heaviest vote in years yester
day, and it was a Republican victory
both State and county. The entire State
ticket goes Republican by from 250 to 500,
Neff leading for Lieutenant Governor,
and the scratching being mostly confined
to Secretary of State and Supreme Court
Judges. Gage's plurality will be at least
400. De Vries, Democrat, for Congress,
will carry the county by 200, and Lardner,
Republican, is elected to the Legislature
by GOO. On the county ticket a bitter fight
was waged for Sheriff. The Republicans
made a clean sweep, with the exception
of Assessor. The succepsful county ticket
is as follows: Sheriff, Charles Keena;
Assessor. George E. Mitchell; Clerk, J.
B. Lamlis; Recorder, C. A. Bilkey; Treas
'â¢ urer, John Chisholm; School Superintend
ent, P. W. Smith: Coroner. W. J. Burns;

SILVER PARTY WINS IN
THE SAGEBRUSH STATE
CARSON, Nev., Nov. 9.â The vote for
Governor is very close, but Reinhold
Sadler (Silver 1 * claims his re-election by
800 majority over William McMillan
(R.). Congressman Newlands, the Sil
ver and Democratic nominee, is re
elected by 3000 majority over his only
opponent, Tom Wren (P.)- The balance
of the State ticket is conceded to the
Silver party, with the exception of Su
perintendent of Public Instruction. The
compjexion of the next Legislature ia
a matter of conjecture. Four-fifths of
the members will belong to the Silver
party, but as some are pledged to Sen
ator Stewart for re-election and the re
mainder are not, the latter may join
with the Republicans, Democrats*and
Independents in the organization of the
Legislature.

TO THIS CITY
Seven Regiments Are
Coming.
THEY ARE TO WINTER HERE
-
GOVERNMENT PROBABLY PRE
PARING FOR EMERGENCIES.
Department Commander Not Yet
Notified, but Would Not Be Sur
prised if More Men
Should Come.
I
Of late there have been rumors afloat
Jn military circles to the effect that it
â¢was the Intention of the "War Department
to winter a large force of volunteer troops
on this coast. It is said that from five to
eeven regiments will be sent to this city
in the near future to go Into winter quar
ters here. This rumor has been in circu
lation for the past two weeks, but con
stant inquiry at department headquarters
has revealed the fact that General Mer
riam has not yet been notified of any such
intention on the part of the War Depart
ment. When seen about the matter yes
terday he stated that as far as he knew
there was nothing in the report, but he
added that as a matter of fact he was
never notified of the arrival of any of the
other regiments of the Eighth Array
Corps until they reached here.
In speaking of the matter he said:
"When the war broke out I was notified
by the War Department to prepare to
equip the troops of California, Oregon and
Washington, amounting in all to about
6000 troops. This was all the notice given
me, and I was never informed of the ex
pected arrival of any other troops until
they reached here."
Officers who are in a position to know,
while affirming that they do not believe
any more troops will be sent here for the
present, admit that such a step on the
part of the War Department would not
surprise them, owing to the unsettled
condition of affairs in the Philippines.
â  They declare that if there should be a
material hitch in the Peace Commission
â¢ at Paris there will be a rapid centralizing
. of troops in the Philippines, and that in
such a case they will very naturally be
embarked from this city.
It is possible that the Government may
- have something up its sleeve, and is
, quietly preparing for some future move
that has not yet been made known to the
| public. If troops should be sent here in
the.near future it is conceded in military
circles that it will mean that the renewal
â of -hostilities is unavoidable, as San Fran
cisco is the most undesirable place to
â winter troops on account of the rainy sea
son. In support of this theory General
Merriam stated that for the past month
he has been very much exercised in get
ting the troops away from here, so that
they' would not have to encounter the
rains.
. Private Charles Dennis, Company B,
Eighth California Regiment, who has
been on duty at department headquarters,
has been ordered to rejoin his company
at the Presidio.
Leave of absence for fifteen days, on
account of sickness, has been granted to
Captain R. M. Klrby Smith, assistant
surgeon of the First Tennessee Regiment.
A WHALER. LIBELED.
Sailors Accuse Captain Millard of
Cruelty and .Breach of Contract.
William Hartle, John O'Keefe and thir
teen others, sailors of the steam whaling
bark Belvedere, filed a libel ag-ainst the
bark yesterday in the United States Dis
trict Court. They allege that they shipped
for a twelve months' whaling cruise and
that they were frozen in all winter in the
Arctic Ocean, near Point Barrow, and
that when the vessel got away and
reached Port Clarence at the expiration
of their term of service they asked to be
discharged. They aver that the master,
Captain Millard, not only refused to com
ply with their request, but kept them vir
tually prisoners on board the bark for
eight months longer. Two of their num
ber, Lopez and Dwyer, protested, and
were placed in irons by the captain and
triced up by the wrists from 7 o'clock in
the morning of August 5 until 11 o'clock
of the evening of the same day.
They ask for $500 damages for detention
and Lopez and Dwyer demand $500 addi
tional for being ironed and triced up.
A Captain Sued.
United States Attorney Foote yesterday
entered a suit in the United States Dis
trict Court on behalf of the Government
against Captain K. Van Oterendorp of the
Alameda for $3000 penalty for landing
three passengers without the consent of
the customs officials.

KZEMA WORST KID
Face and Neck One Inflammation.
Not Able to See. Unable to
Sleep for Weeks from
Severe Pain.
Friends Did Not Recognize Me
Face So Swollen and Hideous.
Three Doctors Could
Not Relieve.
CURED IN 2 WEEKS BY CUTICURA
I have suffered with a case of Eczema of
the worst kind, my face and neck down to my ;
shoulders were one inflammation, was not
able to see out of my eyes for quite a while,
and was unable to sleep for weeks, on account
of the severe pain, which nearly drove me in-
sane. My face and neck were swollen and
made me look hideous. I hardly recognized
myself in a mirror, and my friends would
not have known me, only on account of my
â ".iothes and carrying myself.
' Three doctors, of good practice, at different
times were attending me, and not one of
them could relieve me of my pain, swelling,
and blotches. I gave all up. A friend advised
me to try Ccticura Remedies. I did, and
there was immediately a great change, my
shoulders and neck turning to their natural
color. I used three bottles of Cdticdea Re-
solvent, four boxes Cdticdea (ointment),
three cakes of Cdticura Soap, and my friends
and one of the doctors are surprised, and asked
â¢'Who cured you?" and I tell them quickly
" Cdticoba Remedies." J. V. KAFKA,

was still in sight, and the crew were whistling for a breeze. Before the Matterhorn arrived she was be
calmed for several days in sight of the Golden Gate. J
may be expected. The ladies of the
church and the Society of Christian En
deavor have the affair in charge, so
everything is sure to g-o off without a
hitch.
MULLER AND KELLY
ARE TRAINING HARD
PUGILISTS WHO WILL FIGHT BE
FOBE THE WESTERN CLUB.
Lavingne Is Putting On Hard Flesh
vingne Is Putting 1 On Hard Flesh
Daily at the Six-Mile House
Training Station.
Next Tuesday evening the "Western
Athletic Club will hold a boxing: enter
tainment in Woodward's Pavilion. THe
director-general, Martin Murphy, is au
, thority for the statement that the sport
rity for the statement that the sport
ing public will be treated to a first-class
evening's sport.
The feature of the entertainment will
be "a twenty-round contest between Fred
Muller of the Manhattan Athletic Club
and the famous "Spider" Kelly, who has
attended Tom Sharkey in many of the
sailor's principal battles. The "Spider"
and the Tom Sharkey in have been the
or's principal battles. The "Spider"
the man-o'-warsman have been In
correspondence ever since they were
matched to fight, and some of the letters
received from Sharkey are quite interest- j
ing, by the way. Thomas concludes one
of his epistles In this wise:
" 'Spider,' old boy, I hope to hear of
your knocking the block off the Jew In!
a few punches. I know you can do the I
trick easily. Take no chances, but put it
on to him quick, as he is a husky kind of
a lad and may outlast you if you fool
any time away. I have a mortal cinch on
Corbett. If Gentleman Jim will only stand
his ground and give blow for blow some
body will pick his head up outside of
the ring ropes. 'Spider,' j. a whip him just
as sure as my name is Tom Sharkey." .
Kelly is training for the contest at the
ocean beach, and Muller is training at
Blanken's with Kid Lavigne, and Is pick
ing up quite a few points from the clever
light weight. Muller's friends contend
that Kelly will not be in the game from
start to finish, but the "Spider says that
it will take a much better man than Mul
ler to land him on the boards. The pre
liminaries will consist of a ten-round bout
between the game Jimmy Rellly and a
pupil of Fred Muller's, who is said to be
a very stiff puncher, and a ten-round
"go" between Kid McFadden and Kid
Maynard, who is also training at the Six-
Mile House. All in all the athletic bill
of fare is above the ordinary mess given
to the sporting public of this city, and
will doubtless be well attended.
Joe Gans will have another chance to
prove to Eastern sporting men what he
can do wnen he trains to win. Gans and
Jack Daly, who Is a pupil of Sam Fitz
patrick, have been- matched to fight be
fore the Cleveland Athletic Club, Cleve
land, Ohio, for an alleged purse of $5000,
to weigh in at 133 pounds. It Is more than
likely that the purse is $500, as Eastern
clubs are not giving large purses except
ing on paper these days.
Betting on the Corbett and Sharkey
fight has already commenced. At Crow
ley's poolrooms a few wagers have been
made that Corbett . will get a decision
over the sailor. The betting is $10 to $7,
with Corbett a favorite.
The sporting men of Frultvale, Alameda
County, are making great preparations
for the fistic entertainment which will
be given in Plittsville Park on Tuesday
evening next for the benefit of the Fruit
vale fire department. The names of the
boxers engaged have already been pub
lished.
To Limit the Damages.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company filed a petition in the
United States District Court yesterday to
limit the amount of damages that might
be claimed by the owners of the Czarina
as a result of the collision between the
two on the evening of November 3.
The pilot of the Peters lays the blame on
the pilot of the Czarina. The court is
asked to limit the damages to $5000, which
is alleged to be the present value of the
Petera.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Suits for divorce on the ground of cru
elty have been filed by Mrs. Mary Frey
against John F. Frey and Mary Bau
mann against Michael Baumann. Eliza
beth H. Nowell alleges that her husband,
Frank H. Nowell, has deserted her with
out cause, and she asks for a divorce on
that ground. Suits for divorce on t.ie
same ground have been filed by L. W. rf.
Greene against Grace I. Greene, and Ella
M. Nlller against Theodore H. Nlller.
Police Fund Cases.
Two demurrers tcr actions in which thÂ©
police relief, health and pension fund ap
pears as defendant . were sustained Â£by
Judge Seawell yesterday. W. H. Kentzell
and I. Nettleton instituted the suits, ths
former asking: for $1600 and the latter
$1000. The defendant demurred to the
complaints on several grounds, and " as
the court sustained them . the cases are
practically thrown out of court.

CALIFORNIA'S
BREEZES DO
NOT SUIT HIM
Captain of the Matter
horn Objects.
BECALMED COMING AND GOING
HIS SHIP SAILED TUESDAY AND
IS STILL OFF PORT.
An Off Shore Norther Has Probably
Delayed the Arrival of the
Steamers Belgic and
Australia.
Captain Williams of the British ship
Matterhorn has not a very grreat opinion
| of our California winds. He says they are
i always light when a good breeze is deslr
j able or blowing a gale in the wrong direc
j tion. The Matterhorn was off the Golden
â¢j Gate for several days before she got close
enough in for a tug to pick her up and
tow her in, and again, much against the
[ captain's will, she is off the Farallones.
The Matterhorn is chartered to load
wheat at Portland, Or., for Europe. Af
j ter discharging here she took in ballast
I and last Tuesday morning was towed out
to the nine fathom buoy. A light breeze
i took the ship out over the bar and then
! it fell light. All Tuesday night and yes
' terday morning the Matterhorn drifted
I about close to the lightship, and then an
! other breeze took her out to the Faral
! lones. She will probably remain in that
} vicinity until a wind from the south
comes along and carries her up the coast.
The incoming pilots report that a heavy
I norther has been blowing off shore. A
heavy swell is rolling in, and the pilot
boats America and Gracie S got the ben
efit of it yesterday. The Australia from
Honolulu and the Belgic from Hongkong
via Yokohama and Honolulu are both a
little behind time, and the chances are
that the norther is responsible for the
trouble.
Another attempt will be made to raise
j the steamer J. D. Peters to-day. Chains
I will be passed under the hull and made
fast to lighters at low water. As tho
tide rises it will take the lighters with
It and, it is hoped, the Peters also. The
wrecked vessel will then be pushed up
on the mud by the tugs and after her
bulkheads have been made watertight she
! will be pumped out.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Colon arrived from Panama and Central
American ports yesterday. She brought
up six cabin and four steerage passen
gers, and thirty-one Chinese en rotite for
China. Among the cabin passengers was
F. Murota, the Japanese Minister to
Central America, and his secretary, Z.
Omare.
E. Prescott, a driver for thÂ© Black Dia-
mond Coal Company, was nearly killed
on Mission-street wharf yesterday. He
iraa standing at his horse's head when
the State tug Governor Irwin blew her
whistle and scared the animal. It ran
away and threw Prescott under the load
ed wagon. One of the wheels passed over
him, breaking his leg and otherwise in
juring him. He was taken to the Harbor :
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Zabala
dressed his wounds, after which the coal
company had him removed to his home.
The owners of the F. M. Smith deny
the story that their vessel nearly blew
up last Thursday. The steamer arrived
at her wharf on time and under a full
head of steam. Mr. Smith says the story
was started by the opposition line to in
jure his business.
The new ferry steamer Berkeley will go
on the regular run to-day In conjunction
with the Piedmont and Oakland. If she
proves a success the ferry company will

Who Is Geestine ShaffeP
A woman about 30 years of age was
locked up in a padded cell in the Receiv

forts are being made to find out some
thing about her. She was a passenger on
the train from San Jose, and acted so
strangely that when the train arrived here
she was handed over to Policemen Brown

She is unable to give any account of her
self except to say her name is Geestine
Shaffe.

The Day After Election From Vari

EASTERN MEN
ARE ALLOWED
TO PLAY HERE
So Says the Only
Emergency Board.
THE RULE DISPENSED WITH
PLAYERS SHOUXD WATCH CABE
FULLY AND LEASN.
With National League Men Controll
ing the Teams Great Games
Should Be in
Order.
By Joe Corbett.
The directors of tha Pacific Coast
League are to be congratulated. This
time it is for waiving 1 that rule which
prohibited the signing of National League
players after a certain date. For a while
it looked as though the patrons of the
game on this coast were â owing to the
rule lately dispensed with â to be deprived
of the privilege of seemg 1 these "Eastern
stars." In fact I would have Imagined
but a month back that no National
League player returning to this coast
would be accorded the right of continuing
to labor at his art. It was entirely out of
the question for these "stars" to play,
and the first team which broke the rule'
was threatened with all sorts of punish
ments by the supreme and only "Emer
gency Board."
All this occurred, however, before the
return of the wondrous prodigies. "What
happened after was but natural, I pre
sume, and therefore should not be sub
jected to criticism. This is so, I might
say emphatically, for the reason that
baseballdom is very jubilant over the
prospect of seeing "star players," and, I
trust, "star baseball."
The Sacramento and Oakland teams
were the first to break the rule. The
first-named club on a week from Sunday
last pitched "Jay" Hughes, the lad who
so nobly maintained the record of Cali
fornia in the East last summer, and the
last-named team played Mertes, also a
Californian, who did himself and his
State credit while setting Chicago a-fire
by his wonderful playing and base run
ning during the same period.
Before these games were started a pro
test was entered by the opposing clubs.
They claimed that Eastern men were
barred, according to agreement, and
therefore no club had a right to play
them. The games were, however, al
lowed to proceed, and a note was made
of the protest.
In Sacramento a tremendous crowd
turned out to see Hughes pitch, while in
the city here a good-sized gathering was
present to witness the "great Sandow."
These little incidents were not lost sight
of, and so, at the next meeting, these
protested games vs. the Eastern player
were the only questions of importance.
They were discussed with great serious
ness, the result being that the Sacra
mento and Oakland teams were com
illed to forfeit those games in which
istern players participated and the rule
ohibiting these men from playing was
olished, with the proviso that no league
im should employ more than one.
n bringing a question of such moment
a successful ending the board certainly
I display an unreasonable amount of
sdom, and is to be congratulated. Never
1 they accomplish a more laudable feat,
it may be called such, and surely no
one will dispute their right to run for of
fice in the near future. To have barred
the Eastern players would have been, in
my opinion, a suicidal move. There Is not
a fan in the State who is not longing to
see them perform, and no one can doubt
the equally important fact that they will
improve the players and necessarily the
I have said on a former occasion that
what the majority of teams In this Pa
cific Coast League need, and badly, is a
leader. I reiterate that statement and
also would suggest, to the various man
agers, that they put these men in com
plete control of operations on the field.
As the league board has allowed each
club one man and no more, this couiu be
done, I imagine, without offending any
one. They are more experienced in up-to
date methods, and it is these methods
that win games.
A player like Mertes has had no more
experience at baseball than has had Fred
Lange or Tip O'Neil, yet Mertes has
playeÂ«l during this advanced age and Is,
therefore, in a better position to impart
National League methods and ideas,
â which, every one will concede, is the
source of all scientific and improved base
ball points.
This league of ours can stand a terrible
lot of coaching and advice on many points
of the game. The players have not had
an opportunity to see the game as it is
being played to-day in the National
League, and should submit willingly to
any advice offered by these exponents of
the art who will from now on be playing
in their midst. 1 myself consider it an
elegant opportunity for thr amateurs to
pick up and learn the game in all its de
partments.
The best plan, to my mind, would be to
watch these men at all times. When at
bat and on bases during critical situations
keep an eye on them. They have many
ways of earning runs which are un
familiar to the boys of this coast, and one
cannot learn too much about baseball.
Then again these men can make numer
ous plays in the field and at bat if the
men playing with them co-operate. It
will be quite difficult for them to consum
mate plays if ,their colleagues do not work
In unison, for they are used to superb
team work and are liable to be lost with
out It.
As I have often mentioned, there Is a
sad lacking of team work among all the
teams save the Gilt Edges. , Team work
Is one of the most necessary factors of a
club's success and Is acquired only by
practice. With the present force of Na
tional Leaguers to coach and advise I
see no reason why the players of this
leagu.j, providing they co-operate with
serious intentions, should not be putting
up a game the equal of any minor league.
The material is here, with the new ac
quisitions, and I cannot see what excuse
could be offered in the event of stupid
plays being conspicuous, as I have often
seen them In the past.
The "emergency board" has done well
by the players and also the public in dis
posing of that rule which prevented
ADVZRTISEMEUTS.
HjH &3]?39?4.\ 343^45.9 47 Ma*rKet Sfc.s.r. 'fl B
Eastern men from doing their prettiest,
and the players should show their appre
ciation by co-operating and giving that
order of baseball that la expected.
As to the public, they will continue to
patronize good baseball. They will also
expect a higher grade of ball; make no
mistake and you can give it if you pay
attention.
COULD HAVE USED BALLOONS.
The science of military aeronautics has
proved particularly useful to the foot ar
tillery, while its serviceability in the siege
of fortresses can scarcely be overestimat
ed. One ascension frequently suffices to
observe the fortifications as well as the
batteries to be attacked, and these are
at once cartogTaphically registered. What
a valuable adjunct a well-equipped and
carefully organized aeronautic troop
would have been to the American army
in the recent war with Spain. Had some
of the American vessels engaged in
blockading the harbors of Cuba oeen
equipped with a complete kite-balloon
outfit the task of investment would have
been greatly facilitated, the enemy's for
tifications would have been immediately
exposed to view and the position and
number of the Spanish boats definitely
ascertained.
To the enemy, the captive balloon be
comes an object of attack, upon which
the fire of both musketry and artillery id
frequently trained. The question here in
volved is obviously of the highest import
ance; and considerable time and labor
have been devoted by the German Gov
ernment to its Solution. Investigation has
now shown musketry fire to be quite in
effective- for, owing to the difficulty or
measuring height and distance, the bal
loon is hard to hit. Moreover, a few bul
let holes entail but a slight loss of gas,
and cannot, therefore, inflict much dam
age. In the case of heavy guns, how
ever, the matter assumes an entirely dif
ferent aspect. Cannon loaded with
shrapnel have proved very effectiveâ more
particularly when the balloon has been
stationary, the range not too short, and
the distance approximately known. Cap
tain Moedebeck states that at long range
the destruction of the balloon by bat
teries is a comparatively simple matter.
At short range, heavy guns are too un
wieldy to be effective. Krupp, in IK7O,
sought to obviate this difficulty by the
construction of a "balloon gun,' but of
his experiments with this weapon I have
as yet been unable to obtain any infor
mation. - . ' _
What has been said of the effectiveness
of battery fire applies to me stationary
balloon only. By a constant change of po
sition and altitude the security of the bal
loon is greatly increased. Such a change
of position is by no means difficult for
our German aeronauts, whose equipment
permits of great mobility. One of our
most experienced aeronauts, Captain
Gross has expressed the opinion now gen
erally acepted that the effectiveness of
field pieces or heavy guns is greatly di
minished so long as the balloon is kept in
constant motion. Experiments have prov
ed the advisability of keeping the bal
loon at a distant of five kilometers from
the batterics-a distance which still af
fords the aeronaut excellent facilities lor
observation.
COTTON GROWERS DISCOURAGED
Reports from many sections through
out the State indicate that there will be
a material decrease in the acreage of
cotton next year. Farmers are very
much discouraged with the returns
from their crops, and they are looking
about for other crops to take the place
of cotton on their farms. Especially is
this the case in Laurens and Jackson
counties, in which many farmers have
been disappointed with the crop returns
of this year. They say they cannot
raise 4-cent cotton and live at home,
and that it is necessary for them to get
crops which will furnish them more
money and reduce the expense of their
living. An immense acreage of wheat,
oats, corn, potatoes and cane will take
the place of cotton on many farms in
those counties. This step is not con
fined to a particular class of farmers,
but those who run from one to forty
mules have signified their intentions to
reduce the cotton acreage and plant
more of those crops which sustains life.

A HEAVY FREIGHT TRAIN.
The largest freight train ever hauled in
the world ran eastward from Altoona to
Columbia Tuesday over the Pennsylvania
Railroad. The record breaker was made
up of 130 cars of Amboy coal, which made
a train 3877 feet in length, a trifle less
than three-quarters of a mile. Ine^ total
weight of the train behind the tender of
the engine was 5212 tons, not counting tne
weight of the countless number of tramps
on board. There were 3693 tons of coal in
the cars. It left Altoona at 9 a. m. and
arrived at Columbia at 11 p. m. Two
crews were required to handle the tram
over the middle division. A single en
gine, No. 872. the first of the giant H 5
class, hauled the enormous string of cars.
This locomotive, which is conceded to be
the largest in the world by railroad au
thorities, weighs about 118 tons, and has
demonstrated its title to be the strongest
machine on wheels in the world. On the
Pittsburg division it hauled jnore than
twice as much as the standard class R
freight engine at every test. The ordi
nary Pennsylvania train is made up of
sixty cars, weighing about 2350 tons.âAl
