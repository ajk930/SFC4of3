"Washington, D. C, Jan. 11.
This was a field day for the anti
annexatlonists. They are in ?n exul
tant mood to-night, and those who are
Incli- â¢ a little bit "sporty" of

will not bÂ» ratified. This confidence
is not based upon the poll of the Pen
which they have made them

â which showed that the annexationists
two or- three rotes short of the
necn=sary sixty.
To-day's developments show that
three of four Senators who were count
ed for annexation hay expressed
themselves as being opposed to it.
The?.-. Senators are: Fpooner of Wis
ronsiri. Gear of lowa. Thurston of Ne
braska and Mantle of Montana. Sen
ators Ppooner and Gear said to a
newspaper correspondent to-day that
their disposition was to vote against
the treaty. Mantis of Montana said
the same, while Thurston of Nebraska
announced his position to another Sen
ator. "I cannot vote for the treaty,"
paid he.
Thus It seems that the treaty will i
lack five or six votes of the necessary |
two-thirds. It is generally conceded i
that if the treaty fails the hill or the ,
"joint project" providing for annex
ation will not 1"- taken up. It is.
therefore, safe to assume that the an
nexation of Hawaii will not be accom
plished at this session of Congress.
Except for a few minutes given to a
controversy over some minor postoffice
confirmations, the entire time of the
executive session of the Senate was
consumed by Senator Davis of Minne
sota in a speech in support of Hawaii
an annexation. Mr. Davis is chairman j
of the Senate Committee on Foreign i
Relations and his speech was generally !
accepted as the semi-official utterance
of the majority of the committee. He
ppoke about two hours, and when the
Senate adjourned he had not finished.
The speech was the first on the merits
of the treaty, and on this account and i
because of the known fact that Sen- !
ator Davis had made a very careful in
vestigation of the subject, he received
the undivided attention of the members
4of the Senate, regardless of individual
views. As the speech was delivered be
hind closed doors, a verbatim report
could not be secured. The portion of
the speech delivered to-day consisted
of a review of the relations between
this country and Hawaii during the
history of these islands, and was in
tended to show that the United States
had exercised a fostering and protect
iing care over them from the beginning,
with many evidences of the intention
of ultimately making them an integral
portion of the American domain.
"I approach this question," the Sen
ator began, "with, I hope, a due sense
of the responsibility imposed upon me
in ginning a debate, the result of
whic:i may be of momentous conse
quences to the future dwellers of both
this country and the Hawaiian Isl
ands.
"The question," he continued, "is one
of importance so vast that one must of j
necessity approach it with a certain
degree of timidity," because it was, he
said, very difficult to present all the
points involved as they should proper
ly be presented, however much care
and attention one might have given to
the subject.
The Senator, without further apolo
gy, then launched into the presentation
of the subject before the Senate. He
consumed considerable time in a gen
eral presentation of the resolutions for
annexation, saying that these were
both commercial and strategic.
Referring to the commercial reasons
for controlling the islands in the in
.4 terest of this country, he called atten
"â¢., tion to the location, midway in the Pa
cific Ocean, and said that anyone with
â¢ â¢ half an eye to the importance of the
" trade of the Orient could discern the
fact that they must cut a very Import

ANNEXATION MEANS
A NEW SLAVE STATE.
FRANKFORT, KY., Jan. II. â In the General Assembly
to-day Representative Albert Charlton introduced the following
resolution :
"Whereas, There is at present pending in the United
States Senate a treaty providing for the annexation of the
Hawaiian Islands; and,
"Whereas, That annexation would be tantamount to the
admission of a slave State, the representatives of which would
necessarily work and vote for the enslavement of labor in
general ; therefore, be it
"Resolved, That we urge the United States Senate ft>
reject the treaty of annexation and to take such other steps
as may be necessary to maintain amicable relations with
Hawaii."
1 here was some little opposition and Charlton made a
fiery speech in which he took the ground that organized labor
would suiter. After- some parliamentary skirmishing the reso
lution was passed by a viva voce vote.

"As for their military importance."
said tlv> Senator, "it hap already be
come evident that the opening of the

must mark the opening of a new con
dition of affairs in the far Easl
He referred then briefly t.> the opera
tions of the European powers in China,
predicting that the time was net fnr
distant when the great nations would,
if they were not checked, control the
entire Asiatic seaboard.
Taking up the question of the rela
tionship between Hawaii and the Unit
ed States, Senator Davis presented a
very thorough review of the efforts
which had been made in the past to
annex the islands and presented quota
tions from many eminent statesmen of
former times to show, as he Bald, that
the best American thought had always
favored this policy.
He referred at some length to the
Marry treaty, showing why it had not
been perfected, as he did also to the
treaty which was made during Mr.
Harrison's administration. He also
quoted many of the utterances of Sec
retary Marry and also of Daniel Web
ster, and in ending, took occasion to
compliment both in high terms. "In
deed," said the Senator, "with the sin
gle exception of the administration of
Mr. Cleveland it has been the avowed
and consistent purpose of all parties in
all administrations in this country up
to the present time, to make the Ha
waiian Islands a part of the United
States." He contended that their his
tory, so far as they have a civilized
history, is the result of American en
terprise and energy and said the is
lands belonged to this country by virtue
both of sentiment and geographical
cation.
"In view of all the aspects which the
case presents, the United States â¢ an
not afford, either in its own Interests,
or the interests' of th^ Hawaiian peo
ple, to allow this opportunity to gain
control of them t" pass. Buppose we
should not ratify the present treaty
could we consistently continue to ex
ercise the right to prevent other na
tions from assuming the control which
we decline to take?"
He said that up to the present time
we have assumed to exercise a sort of
supervision over the Islands, under th^
guise of asserting the application of
the Monroe doctrine, but under these
circumstances it would h>- a bold man
Indeed who would consider t r; ;Â» t doc
trine applicable In the future, in view
of our failure to take advantage < f
'his opportunity t<> make the islands
our own.
"In case," asked Senator Gray, also
:i member of the Committee on For
eign Relations, "the islands should be
annexed, is it the policy to have them
admitted as a State of the Union, with
their present mixed population?"
"Such I do not believe to be the pur
pose of any one," replied Senator Da
vis. "I, myself, freely admit that the
population of Hawaii is not BUCh at
the present time as would he desirable
in an American State, and for myself
I say that I consider the character of
the population to be one Âf the objec
tions to annexation. But the advan
tages so far outweigh this one element
as to render it of comparative insig
nificance."
He added that while he did not be
lieve it to be the purpose of any one
that the islands should constitute a
State of the Union, he would not
attempt to say anything that would
bind future administrations in this
matter. One point which Mr. Davis
dwelt on at some length was the desira
bility of the islands, not only to this
country, but to all the leading powers
of the world.
"We," he said, "should take the isl
ands while we have the opportunity,
and if we do not want them, it will be
a very easy matter for us to get rid of
them on our own terms."
He showed that they would be a very
important territorial acquisition to
either Japan, England or Russia, and
expressed the opinion that either of
these powers would take the islands off
our hands at any time we might make
known our desire to be rid of them. It
will be easy enough, he said, to turn
them over to some other country if we
find them to be an undesirable acquisi
tion, but who will say that it will be so
easy for us to take them at some future
time in case we voluntarily deprive
ourselves of the present opportunity.
He therefore urged that the experiment
should be made at this time.
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1898.
When Senator Davis concluded this
portion of his speech, it was the gen
eral understanding that he would con
tinue to-mormw. but as he has an
abundance of material it is doubtful
whether he will be able to conclude
with one more effort. When he ceased
speaking h>- was generally applauded
by his fellow Senators upon his com
prehensive presentation of the subject
JOINT RESOLUTION
SECURING ANNEXATION
CANNOT BE PASSED.
Weak Points of the Scheme Become More
Apparent as the Debate in Secret
Session Proceeds.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â The first
pitched battle in the Senate over the
Hawaiian annexation left both com
batants feeling confident at ultimate
victory. The Senators who opposed
annexation ar* 1 sure that the sentiment
In its favr is at floodtide now, and
will slowly but surely ebb. They fur
ther believe that if the treaty fails (ft
ratification In executive session, no
amount of argument over a joint reso
lution for annexation can secure its Â»>n
actmeni into law. This is npi so much
because the House will be affected by
the failure an because the Close draw
ing of Uri'-s In the debate In secret ses
sion will result in a determination <'n
the ; art of the antl-annexatlonists to
kill the whole scheme. And this, under
the Senate rules, is possible if any con
siderable number of Senators are.
bound to accomplish it.
The argument which is said to have
won over two or three doubting Sena
tors to annexation, namely, that the
of things on the Pacific had been
Beriously changed by the recent acqui
sitions of the great powers in *'hina, is
one which is quite as likely to win Votes
against annexation as for it.
The anti-annexatlonista regard it as
a great point in their favor, for it adds
materially to the complications which
we invite when we go into the business
of extending our naval and commer
cial picket line into the middle of th.
largest of the oceans.
Instead of having merely two inferior
Asiatic powers to deal with, we arc
liable to have these and three or four
of the great powers of Europe thrown
in, and the danger of collision and
trouble is increased by that propor
tion. It is thought that some of th--
Pacific Coasl Senators are 'willing i"
compromise on an agreement to fur
ther fTtify and Improve thÂ«- leading
seaports of their coafct, so v to put
our whole Pacific front into the best
possible condition f"r either war or
peace. <">ne of their great objects now,
aside from standing in with the admin
istration, is to cause a larger naval
force to be kept in the Pacific, as would
be necessary in ease of annexing the
Hawaiian Islands. If a similar end can
be gained by simpler means, it is
thought some of them may be won
over. It is noted by the anti-annexa
tionistsfis a peculiar fact that the most
strenuous opposition to the motion yes
terday to throw open the doors and dis
cuss the treaty in public came from
Senators who were foremost in de
manding an open session when Secre
tary Bayard's fisheries treaty with
<sreat Britain was before the Senate in
1888. The opportunity which would
have been given the jingoes to roar out
insults to England in debate on the
fisheries treaty would, they thought, be
popular with the ignorant mob outside.
Whereas the Hawaiian treaty will af
ford no such chance for inaflmmatory
speech- making.

ST. LOUIS. Jan. 31.â Mrs. Alice Parke.
20 years of age. residing at 422 ec
ond street. East St. Louis, went into a
trance Monday morning at 10 o'clock,
and it was thought she was dead. Her
heart seemed to stop beating, and she
turned cold. She remained in this con
dition until this afternoon, when some
neighbors came in to assist in prepar
ing her body for burial. She then
shivered slightly, opened her eyes and
looked around. The sight of the
crowd so shocked her that she fainted.
A doctor was hurriedly summoned, and
in a few minutes she was brought
around all right. It is now thought sh>>
will recover in a short time. She said
that she remembers nothing from Mon
day until aroused this afternoon. She
says she simply felt queer and could
not move, but she is all right now, with
the exception of weakness and a queer
feeling about her head and stomach.

JOBBERY IN THE

The Board of State Prison Di
rectors have been grossly violat
ing the law supposed to govern
the sale of grain sacks.
Prices have been manipulated
hy thorn, to the groat disadvan
tage of the small farmers, whom
the Ostrom act was designed to
befriend.
Th>>y have played into the
hands of the Importers, and fa
vored throughout the State the
growing system of extortion
established by the middlemen.
Last year they depleted their
surplus at a minimum price for
futurt- delivery, in lots exi-eedint;
the legal limitation, and th-n
raised the prices while the mil
lions of sacks unpaid for were
still in ihÂ« State warehouse.
They favored lartre purchase is,
the wealthier farmers and un
scrupulous middlemen.
They ran up th<' price of sacks
from $4 7". to jr, 40 per hundred In
a few weeks, and before the
sacks were needed for the crops.
' ':.<â > middleman handled 150,
000 sacks under these conditions
and mulcted the small farmers
tÂ«. the limit.
While the year is still young and not
greatly sinned against it may be well
for the State Board of Prison Directors
t" lay the foundations of reform in the
matter of managing the sale of the ,
Jute products of San Quentin.
Although the board Beem to be bliss
fully Indifferent i<> the awkward posi
tiÂ«>n in which they have placed them-
Belveaâ and this is the mildest fnrm in
which th'.-ir transgressions can be gen
eralized -they have been violating the
law supposed to govern the subject in
a manner intended to ronvey ihe Im
pression that they have decided unani
mously to be a law unto themselves.
Not only have the board annulled the
â¢ ssential provisions of the Ostrom act
and trampled its mandatory restric
tions unuer femt, their laxneps of super
vision and want of vlKilance are blam
ahle for much hardship and injustice
worked apainst the smaller farmers by
banker dealers in sacks and country
middlemen.
Scarcely can it b*Â» possible that the in
iquities of ;i Â»sieiu which has devel
oped rapidly durinp the year past under
their very eyes have eluded their per
< â¢ ptlon, since th*> complaints against it
made by the sufferers have occasioned
th-- Inquiries conducted by The fall.
It is with no desin- to brine the board
into disrepute, to impeach thÂ»Â»ir individ
ual Integrity or to produce sensational
effects that The Call takes them to task.
No Inferential charges will be laid at
their door. It will suffice in the public
interest, and more particularly in the
interest of th<>sÂ»- farmers who stand
must in ne<-d <>f encouragement and
protection, that the board have grossly
violated the law timo and time again:
that tho rt-stilts of these violations have
been evil and injurious, practically as
well as morally.
The motive of the establishment of a
jute plant at the San Quentin prison
was to maintain an industry with con
vict labor which would in no manner
compete with the free white labor of
the State, and at the same time prove ,
nf especial benefit to the struÃKling ;
farmers and other small consumers of
jute products. To them was to be af- I

this result was not attained.
Accordingly, thf> law of February 27,
| 1593. the full text of which is printed
herewith, provided for the sale to farm
1 ers alone of sacks and jute goods in the_
limited numbers of 5000 pieces or fewer,
and only on affidavit proof that actual
consumers were the intending pur
chasers. Po Jealous were- the friends of
this act to insure its benefits to the
small actual consumers that the num
ber any one person might purchase an
nually \v:,s limited to 3000 sacks in the
original bill. The Senate amended this
provision so as to allow of maximum
annual purchases of 50>">0 pieces.
The law was designedly hedged in
with restrictions, but the board were
not at a loss to find a loophole when
they con< luded to embark on the pe
culair enterprise about to be described.
It will be noted that In section 1 of the
act it Is made the duty of the State
prison authorities to confine the sale
of jute â¢; Is to consumers direct, "but
no order shall be filled for any one In
dividual or firm during any one year
for more than SOW grain bags, except
on request of the Warden and the
unanimous approval" of the board.
In section 2 it is provided that "on
and after the ir.th day of June each
year, by and with the consent of a
majority of the board." the Warden
may fill orders for larger quantities to
"actual consumers."
While these two provisions would
seem to be in conflict they are recon
dlable in intent. Obviously the power
and duty expressed in the first section
is this: When an applicant appears
before the Warden prior to June 15 the
en must satisfy himself that the
person in Question is an actual con
sumer, approximately in the quantity
of sacks applied for, because it is on
the Warden's recommendation that the
1 are to act. Nor is the approval
of one or a majority of the board suf
ficient. They must "unanimously"
consent, on the assurance that the
goods are for consumption direct, be
fore the order of the applicant can be
filled. This clause affords the board
the chance of accommodating' a wheat
raiser who needs more than 5000 sacks.
It was not intended as a cover for con
tracts for sacks in great numbers, to
Itvered at the option of the appli
cant.
Greater latitude is given the board
under the clause in section 2, since, ac
cording to this, they may dispose of
more than 5000 sacks to any single ap
plicant by consent of a "majority" of
the members. But even here they are
required to take every precaution that
r.o person othor than an actual con
sumer should be favored.
On July 1, 1893, the beginning of the
first fiscal term in which the Ostrom
net operated, the s?an Quentin ware
house contained a surplus of grain
packs in the number of 1,259,500. This
surplusage increased until it registered
on February J, 1^97, ?.. 220,000 sacks.
The board about that time, under a
pretext seemingly sound from a busi
ness point of view, adopted a resolu
tion nullifying the law. They
resolved to sell sacks In any
number within th^ limit of 1.000,000. for
future delivery, as wheat and otner
commodities are sold on change for
speculation in margins. One of the
very first individual sales under this
decision was of 100,000 sacks. Evi
dently a coterie of friends, mostly
â wealthy middlemen and farmers
with large: estates, were quietly
apprised of the illegal departure
on th^ part of the board, for
in the brief period of fifteen days a to
tal of 2,000,000 sacks had been con
tracted for delivery, any number of
the applications, which came with a
rush fr~>m certain quarters, ranging
from 20,000 to 100.000 sacks.
A second resolution was made to
cloak the sale of the second million and
meanwhile, on February 5, the board,
acting by virtue of the power vested in
them, had fixed the price at $4 75 per
hundred sacks. February 20th, when
2.000,000 sacks had been contracted for,
they advanced the price to $5 per hun
dred, and at this rate under resolutions
disposed of 500.000 sacks, at this point
limiting each applicant to 10,000 sacks.
Two days later they resolved, on the
same terms, to sell an additional 750,
000 sacks. Two weeks afterward they
advanced the price to $5 40 per hundred,
and placed the limit of applications ac
cording to law again, at. 5000 in each
case.
It will be observed that the larger or
ders were accepted at the lesser price
fixed by them, and that they chalked
up the value of the product to the early
and favored applicants, in six weeks,
on stock still in tho State warehouse,
but bargained for delivery! from $4 75 per
hundred sacks to $o 40 per hundred. Be
fore these sacks were called for the
board had by private legislation, after
the fashion that corners in shares and
industrial products are manipulated,
fattened the value of {he total pur
chase to the applicants by $18,000, and
pegged up thÂ»- price to the thousands
of small consumers who depend on- local
storekeepers and dealers, from $4 75 to
$5 40 â just 65 cents per hundred.
One not accustomed to figuring
margins might be puzzled to see how
such could be the result. Here is the
easy sleight-of-hand manner in which
it is worked out: Two million grain
packs in the penitentiary warehouse on
February 3 were rated as worth $4 75
per hundred. A comparatively few per-
BOna contracted to buy this number at
the price given, but had no call for \
them until the period of their use in
the fall had arrived.
March 13 the board fixed the price aX
$5 40 per hundred, making the sacks
Ftiil undelivered â worth just 65 cents per
hundred more to the applicants who
neither had paid for nor received them.
The total of the inflated value thus
manipulated was 65 times 20,000, or
$13,000.
Between February 20 and March 13,
at $5 per hundred, 1,250,000 sacks were
contracted for delivery.
On March 13, the date of the second
raise to $5 40 per hundred, this part of
the warehouse stock was inflated- by 40
cents a hundred sacks to the intending
purchasers, or a total of $5000, making
the grand total of $18,000. As the Cal
cutta rates follow the prison jute rates,
the prices for the season were thus
watered to the $5 40 point, which was
the average at which the small rarmers
had to buy their sacks in the market.
Throughout the State certain bankers
and storekeepers, by a connivance that
is criminal, secure San Quentin sacks
to deal in, together with the Calcuttas,
Which are of inferior quality. Al- :
though the product of the State Prlso-n
mill is by no means commensurate
with the demand â in fact, satisfying
only a fraction of itâ it is of sufficient
volume to serve as the chief factor in
regulating the prices of the Calcutta i
importations, which come from the
cheapest of cheap labor, and are can
trolled by a combination.
The minimum prices on Calcutta
sacks range under the quotations for
â¦he State product, and late in the sea

son usually go a little above it. In 1897,
for example, the season of the extra
ordinary action of the board related,
C'alcuttas were quoted at $4 12 : -2, when
San Quentins were $4 65, $4 7:> and $."..
After the State Prieon Board set up the
price to $5 40, with a depleted stock,
Calcuttas Jumped to $5 75.
This law respecting the quotation on
sacks is not drawn solely from the ex
perience of last year: It is applicable
to other years, and has been noted in
the State of Washington, which imi
tated California in equipping Its Walla
Walla Penitentiary with a Jute mill.
While precise flgures as to the cost of
Calcutta sacks laid down in San Fran
cisco are not readily obtainable, it is
generally known that the margin of the
importations is such that the imi"it
ers are at all times prepared to sell at
prices fixed on the prison product, or
for less.
It remains to be seen, therefore,
whether the prison board were justi
fied in pushing up prices arbitrarily as
they did â an action beneficial to the
importers and injurious to the farm
ers. It should be remembered that be
fore they fixed the $5 40 rate they had
contracted for the delivery of the sur
plus product. They were virtually ad-
Justing a price on the output of 1897.
Now the law expressly provides that
"at no time shall the price flxe.l 1Â»*
more than 1 per cent per bag in excess
of the net cost of producing the s;ui:>-,
exclusive of prison labor." This is
plain enough In lettered intent. Going
beyond, it was not the purpose of th-i
Jute mill acts to create a convict labor
industry of profit to the State. The
income to the revolving fund was ex
pected simply to cover the actual ex
penditures made on the product. In the
nature of things, a season might come
when the 'product would be sold for a
little less than the actual outlay in
money, and to recoup this loss the lati
tude "within which the prio* of a suc
ceeding season might be fixed was lim
ited to 1 cent per sack in excess of the
cost of production.
It does not seem from an analysis of
the jute mill record that any such
emergency had arisen. The cost of pro
duction per sack, laid down in San
Francisco, in the fiscal year of 1893-4
was 4.68; in 1834-5, 4.85; in 1895-6, 4.41;
In 1896-7, 4.24. Thus the average cost
of the four terms would be less than
the 4.75 price fixed for the 2,000.000 sacks
contracted for delivery under the first
February resolutions. In other words
the average cost per sack for the four
years was 4.55*4.
Then came the sale of 1,250,000 at 5,
which increased the average receipts
above the actual cost, and finally when
the possibilities of sales were reduced
to the running output, the price -was
marked up to $5 40. It is represented
that the board fixed the latter price
after an estimate had been made, show
ing that the actual cost of production
was $4 40. Thus they sought to force
the price to the limit textually allowed
by law, Instead of paring it down to
the minimum intended. Even here
they manifestly made out the case to
suit their wishes, for their own official
record states that the actual cost of
production, with the bag laid down in
this city was 4.24. In this respect,
while boosting the market against the
farmer, they violated the law to the
extent of 16 cents on every hundred
sacks; that is to say, they fixed a price
1.16 cents per sack on the product of the
last half of the 1896-7 fiscal year in
excess of the actual cost of producing
it. v
"Was this done in the interest of the
farmer? Certainly not
The evil effects have been traced
through some of the wheat raising
counties by The Call; and, let it be
said, with no malice against the board,
and with no design to make them the
objects either of defamation or sensa
tional attack. It was found that when
it came to the period of the delivery of
State sacks the Calcutta prices had
advanced from $4 12*2 to $5 25. The large
majority of storekeepers and dealers
had both lines of sacks for sale, and
in many instances left the selection
from either stock to the option of the
small purchaser. They were enabled
to do this by the high water quota
tion fixed by the State board, approxi
mate to which the importers sold the
Calcuttas, inasmuch as the supply of
State sacks, controlled by the middle-
men, though superior in quality, were
represented in cost at the quotations
of February and March, namely. $4 75
and $5. In other cases the cost of both
Calcutta and State sacks was advanced
by adding the freight rate to the $5 40
quotation. In every aspect the action
of the board on February 20 and March
13, in making up the price, was in
jurious to the interests the State Jute
mill Is supposed to advantage.
How in the world could middlemen
get possession of State sacks, is asked?
The Call will cite merely the known
method of a single operator, and in do
ing so may add that his dealings must
have been familiar to at least one mem
ber of the board. This man handled
last year no less than 150,000 State
sacks, procured by him under the pe
culiar dispensations of February and
March, as related. His case will serve
to Illustrate the immoral and degrad
ing practices Involved with the many

abuses of the Ostnnn law. He is a
storekeeper, like many another benefi
ciary of the premature grain sack sales.
Many small farmers patronize him, and
doubtless receive favors as debtors.
They appeal to him for assistance
when they want sacks, or, as has been
learned, he advises them early that
they should put in their applications.
The majority of them, short of funds
at that time of the year, are made de
pendent on him fc-r the deposit of the
required 10 per cent of the purchase
money. He agrees to advance this, and
further pay the residue of 90 per cent
and the freight charges when the sacks
are delivered to him.
Hut the farmers must commit a mis
demeanor under the law before they
can secure this assistance. One man
will need r.oo sacks, another 1000. The
middleman could not help them out on
such a small purchase. They must ap
ply for the full limit of f,ooo sacksâ in
excess <if it In some instancesâ and
make affidavit that they are actual con
sumers of the given number. He carries
in stock, in fact all his kind do. a sup
ply of blank forms. The form Is as
follows:

Notary Public.
Tliis affidavit the farmers are per
suaded to sign and swear to, though
numbers of them, it is learned, who
arp familiar with the law have declined
to do so. and the orders are filed with
the board. Each application is signed
by the middleman, and be 'incorporates
the stereotyped notice "shipping in
structions to follow."
When the harvest time comes he has
all the applications he mndp forwarded
in carload lÂ«.ts. In this particular in
stance his freight rate amounted to $1
a, thousand. ThÂ« local rate is J1.62 I*..1 *..
and the extra 62 1 A cents he added to the
farmer's account.
The farmer who signed the affidavit
for r>ooo or 10,000 sacks, as the case
may have boen, while he required only
FM or moo in 1*97, paid $.". 40 per hun
dred with the 1.62Â»^ freight pt-r thou
sand added, and the middleman put
into his warehouse the remainder of
the consignment for $4 75 and $r>; for
the most part at the former figure.
Many, if not nearly all. of the small
farmers thus imposed upon, are ignor
ant of the law, and, therefore, unaware
of the fact that they are tempted into
committing a misdemeanor by its very
terms. Not so with the middleman,
who does not hesitate to make tools of
these men, and convert their necessities
and ingenuousness to his personal pro
fit.
This petty rascality is not common
only to one community. It is practiced
in many, and demands the rigorous
surveillance of the board.
The Call believes that the board
should revise their methods of dealing
with the grain-sack product, and mere
ly makes this statement preliminary to
a fight it Intends to wage until the
farmers have a thorough hearing, to
the end that a more prudent and con
siderate supervision of the subject may
be enforced. Governor Budd has been
appealed to by complainants acquaint
ed with the errors and mischief of the
present manner of management, and
may be expected to interest himself In
the matter.
The board will attempt to justify the
extraordinary course they have pur
sued, on the ground of business expe
diency. Maybe their motives were
satisfactory to themselves. They have
hankered and hungered for quite a
while for the unrestrained confrol of
the sale of bags, and at one time went
so far as to advocate the sale of prison
sacks in neighboring States. In fact,
they incorporated this idea, after the
Attorney-General had reproved it for
mally, in that part of their 1894-96 re
port which recommends the repeal of
the Ostrom restrictions on their dis
cretionary powers. They might well
argue at the time, in support of their
position, that the revolving fund was
somewhat depleted by a surplus pro
duct they could not dispose of at home
with profit, or for cost, yet how could
they expect to dispose of it in contig
uous States to better advantage, with
the Calcutta sacks still in the market
against them?
While the Ostrom provision may be
subject to criticism, a.s difficult to com
ply with, It has not received the trial
by the board to which it is entitled.
First of all, no tenable reason can be
urged why the board cannot sell for
cost every sack produced at the prison
mill. No profit is required or expected
by the people. What is desired above
all other considerations is that the
small farmers receive the benefit of the
act of 1893. The primal duty of the
board is to endeavor by every economy
to reduce the cost of production and
to make the cost, as much as they pos
sibly can, the standard of market quo
tations. It is by developing the possi
bilities, or at least fairly testing the
merits of the Ostrom act, that such an
end may be achieved.
Two causes militate against the mass
of small farmers getting sacks at offi
cial rates. One, their want of funds
for the preliminary 10 per cent deposit
and the final payment before realizing
from their crops; the other their Ig-
norance or misapprehension of the law.
Between them and the State the board
shc-uld serve voluntarily as advisers
and negotiators. They should address
annually to every small farmer in the
State a letter explaining the law and
offering co-operation on the part of the
board in the matter of securing tem
porary loans for the needy through the
many banks that could be persuaded
to extend credit, say, for 60 days, at a
reasonable monthly percentage. They
should refrain additionally from fixing
prices or making sales until the prox
imity of harvest would enable the farm
ers to estimate the number of sacks
they might need.
The whole transaction: the fixing of
price on the basis of cost, the accept
ance of applications with deposits, and
the delivery and receipt of final pay
ment, mi^ht be made to cover a period
not exceeding sixty days in which the
farmer could sell at least enough of his
sacked crop to liquidate his note. Take
for example the experience of 1897.
Say a farmer needed 1000 sacks, and he
could have secured acceptance of his
application in June or July under the
February rate, which was ample for
the State, as it covered the cost of pro
duction. A deposit of ?4 75 would have
been required. Now a small farmer
is poor Indeed Who cannot raise $4 75
or twice or thrice that amount. In
thirty days he would have wheat to
sell, with the proceeds of which he
could take up a note covering the 90
per cent final payment and freight.
At 1 percent, or say II 1 * per cent, for
such a small accommodation, he would
pay for this assistance less than one
dollar. Ah it was he was made to pay
on the thousand sacks he used $6 GO
premium, a distinct loss to him even as
a borrower of $5 50 on that small lot of
poods. So it runs through the countless
list of minor wheat producers who are
the very ones the board should go out
of their way to protect and assist in
the spirit of the law for which they
have shown such regrettable contempt.
With these men the board should put
themselves in touch by persistent and
systematic correspondence, and when all
has been done for them that can be
done by the 15th of June each year,
then the discretionary power of ac
cepting applications for sacks in num
bers exceeding 5000 may be exercised.

DALLAS, Tex., Jan. 11.â A special

T., says: There is an uprising in the
Seminole Nation and one hundred
armed Indians have killed twenty-five
citizens of Pottawattomie County,
this territory. The Indians are seek
ing to avenge the recent burning of
Lincoln McGeisy and Palmer Simp

tribe, who were accused of murdering
Mrs. I.card of Maud postofflce. A spe

gone to Earlsboro, ten miles from
Maud, and excitement Is higher than
ever known before in the Indian Ter

two Seminole Indian boys who were
burned at the stake by a mob, are

Only the trunks of the bodies re

unrecognizable. A common trace

secured by the padlock. The chain was
removed and brought back to Wewoka.
It will be used as evidence in the inves

dom is here to report what takes place

port that the Indians are rising is
wholly false and without foundation.
It is rumored that the people along
the Oklahom.a line are much excited
and fear the Indians will cross the
line and endeavor to avenge the death
of their brothers. This, however, need
not be feared, as all is quiet and serene
in the Seminole nation. Yet a feeling
has been created by the cruel and
hasty action of the mob.

THREE HUNDRED
GATHER ON TRIBAL

Semino/es Gathering in Force Near Earl-

an Expected Massacre.
OKLAHOMA CITY. O. T., Jan. 11.â
Word reaches here to-night that 300
Seminole Indians have gathered at the
tribal dancing grounds, three miles
south of Earlboro, O. T., and that many
settlers of that section of the terri
tory are fleeing from an expected mas
sacre. All sorts of wild rumors are in
circulation here, including a story that
twenty-five persons have been slain by
the Seminolos, but up to a late hour
to-night no positive news of any actual
attack upon the white settlers has been
received.
MUSKOGEE, I. T., Jan. 11.â United
States Marshal Bennett received a tele
gram to-night from one of his deputies
at Maud, O. T., in which the deputy
gives a report in circulation there that
the Seminole Indians are on the war
path and that a band of some 200 In
dians have massacred twenty-five per
sons. Marshal Bennett has made ar
rangements to depart in the morning
for the scene of the reported uprising.
He is very popular with the Seminolea
and hopes to be able to quiet them.

The opposition is charging the Hanna

at the proper time, but that the pur

Senator, and that such a scheme can
not be carried through. Some of the
Hanna men also state that at the prop
er time they will reorganize the House,
as the vote of to-day showed that they
had a majority of three over all in that
body.
Harry C. Mason of Cleveland, speak- i
er of the House, to-night gave out the j
following: 'â¢
To the Public: The principal reason I
why l have been opposed to Mr. Hanna i

I that Kurt;-: had promised two

this report, it was impossible to get the

Among tlit- propositions pending is
one to drop McKisson to-morrow and

nati for all connected with the Otis
nd Its publication.
Tlv following statement was It
from the Hanna headquarters at the
Nell House to-night .
Mayor McKisson's zeal in espousing
the cause of the principles of the Bryan
Democratic party is apparently carrying
him even to the extent of assuring his
Democratic allies that lit- has been se
cretly one of them during thÂ« time in
which he was posing as a Republican
seeking office nt the hands of the Repub
lican party and making speeches in sup
port of Republican principles. The state
ment was made In numerous quarters
yesterday that McKlsson, before the
Democratic caucus. In accepting the
Senatorial nomination at the hands of
that party, pledged himself distinctly
and definitely to support the free silver
doctrine of that party if elected, It now
appears that In his excessive desire to
convince his bearers of his loyalty to the
silver cause, and to Democratic principles
generally, he said In his speech that he
was .1 Bryan man at heart in 1896 and
thai he voted for .Mr. Bryan in the
presidential campaign. The statement
was made by Grant Halltday of Elyria,
a well-known Democrat, w ho was a
memo* of the Democratic National Con
vention In 1896, and whose reputation for
accuracy is unquestioned,
This statement from Mr. McKisson
places him in a curious attitude In refer
ence to party fealty. He gave every evi
dence during the campaign of 1>!Â«; of
loyalty to the Republican party, and was
active in Its campaign, was the nominee
of the Republican party for Mayor in the
spring following the campaign of 1896.
and accepted the nomination and election
from that party without a hint that he
was not in . accord with its principles
and last fall, during the State campaign,
made speeches in which he reiterated his
loyalty to the principles of the Republi
can party. Now it appears that by way
of self-commendation to the Democratic
caucus he Informed its members last
night that he was secretly a Bryan man
in 1896 and voted for him for President.
In confirmation of the report that Mc-
Kjsson had made this assertion in the
Democrats in their caucus last night,
Hon. M. M. Leach of Linchfleld. Ohio,
this evening furnish. 1 to the public the
following statement :

Largey, president <>f the State Savings
Bank and one of the lÂ»--st known ,-jtj
zens of P.utte. was shot and killed in
the bank building about l o'clock this
afternoon by Thomas J. Riley.
Riley entered the bank five <> r ten
minutes before committing the bloody
act. He railed Largey to the cashier's
window and the two talked for fiv
minutes or more. They were convers
ing in ordinary tones and there was
nothing to indicate that their talk was
otherwise than friendly. Suddenly
Riley drew a gun and shot through the
window at Largey. The bullet struck
the latter in the left arm and shattered
the bone. Largey stooped down and
had he continued in thai position he
mipht have escaped with his life, as
he vas protected by the counter. How
ever, he rose partly, and as he did so
Riley fired a second shot. The bullet
struck Largey squarely in the forehead
and he fell over on the floor dead.
The murderer started for the front
door on I'ark street, and as hÂ»" passed
the tellers window he took a shot at
those behind the railing. The hullet
narrowly missed Frank Holmes, onV of
the clerks, dug a bole In his desk and
went through â  glass In one <>f the
windows on the Main stie.-t side of thÂ«*
building. Riley then rushed out of the
Park stie,-t door, thrusting his pistol in
his pocket as he did so.
William Huselton, a customer of the
ban!;, was outside the railing when the
shooting occurred. He made a rush
for the man. but deterred by the sight
of the weapon, did not grab him. He
followed Riley out, however. The mur
hurried west on Park street, fol
lowed by Huselton, who kepi calling
out to arrest the man. Officers attract
ed by the shooting did so and he" was
to jail.
He fooled me too lone." exclaimed
Riley when he arrived at the county
jail, "and I killed him. H< kept prom
tne work, but he did not give me
any and I could not stand it any longer.
Now, If you want to hang me for it.

In contradiction to his statement
that Largey refused to help him. i' is
wpM known that the banker frequently
helped him. He secured employment
for him a number of times, but Riley
was unable to hold a position any
length of time. Besides, Largey occa
sionally supplied him with money
It Is asserted that the killing was
the result of a conspiracy or an under
standing to kill more than one man
who had immaterial or proprietary
interests in the two warehouses that
were the scenes of the explosions.
These warehouses belonged to the
Butte Hardware Company, of which
Largey was manager, and the Ken
yon-Connell company, of which \V. R.
Kenyon was the head. Suits for dam
ages aggregating a quarter of a mil
lion dollar* weTe brought and several
verdicts were secure,], but the explo
sions and subsequent attachments had
exhausted the resources of the Ken

Hardware Company had u,,n.- into
liquidation, and the Judgments are un
satisfied. There was Strong talk of
lynching Riley and four other murder
ers c< >nftned in the jail.
Riley was taken to Deer Lodge Pen

very possible. They were smuggled

SAN JOSE, Jan. 11.â The authorities
are Inclined to believe that Isaac Mar

Saturday, is William a. Miller, an ex

Brown and Marvin from Hollister, has

â â china is at present a heterogeneous
agglomeration of provinces, without
any central government and without
any centralizing affinity. In time there
will be a new assortment of the mem

will then be a feeling of security such

'The plain truth is the jd.> a that
China was a great national humbug
and one of the results of 'he Japan-
China war was the exposure of that
humbug to the world. For centuries
China, almost without the semblance
of a vital national life, had outer-awed
the Orient completely, and had even
cast her long, slanting shadow across
the council chambers of European
statesmen and diplomatists. Hut she
was merely a big balloon. Japan punc
tured the balloon and all the world lias
since been wondering that such a po
litical fetish was suffered to exist so
long.
"As to Japan. 1 rim inclined to think
that so.mer or later, possibly against
the best judgment of her best states
men, she will be force, l int., war in
order to preserve her national integ
rity and unity. She is iust n.Â»w in a
critical condition.
"For the third time the Emperor hns
been compelled to dissolve the Na

demnity which wits exacted o f china
was spent in various national improve
ments, such as the increase <,f the
navy, fortification of naval forts, rail

these measures are now In ti ]m becom

kept up. and to keep tb.in Dp costfl
vast sums of money. With them on

'Meanwhile. Japan has pone on a

say aggresSlVe, is thirsting for war.

FIGHT FOR

GETS BITTER
Left His Wife Out
of His Will Al
together.
Peculiar Provisions of the
Document Offered lor
Probate.
Senator John P. Jones Named
as Executor of the
Estate.
HE DREW UP THE WILL
Claimed by Widow Creede That It
Offers Â» Premium on Little
Dorothy's Kuiri.
Special Dlspatrh to The Call.
I.OS ANGELES, Jan. 11.â The ques
ti"ti as to what disposition is to be
made of the fortune IT.l T . C. Creede, the
discoverer of the famous Colorado min
ing district of that name, is to be de
cide.i by Superior Judge Clarke of this
county. The trial of the case com
menced to-day, and it will consume
some time, as eminent legal counsel has
been engaged to show that the alleged
pi mil will which is tiled for probate is
a fraud.
Louise Creede, the widow of the dead
miner, is endeavoring to break the will.
By its terms she is excluded from all
participation in the many thousands
her husband left behind. She is 52
years of age. Her husband over
looked her in the alleged will, leav
ing one-half of an estate, valued at
about MOO.OOd, to little Dorothy Creede,
their adopted daughter, and the other
half to numerous relatives.
The alleged last will was drawn up by
Senator John P. Jones, who is named
its executor in the document, on Jan
uary 4. 1597. It is dated July 7. 1897.
and July VI of the same year Creede
died.
The singular and anomalous fact that
the will was drawn six months prior to
the time it was dated is by the attor
neys i if Widow Creede regarded as
strong evidence that it is fraudulent.
Under the will the adopted daughter,
little Dorothy, is (o have her fortune
held In trust by her guardian until she
is S< years of nge. When phe has lived
thai l'>ng she is to have the money in
her own risrht. provided she has lived
a virtuous life. The attorneys of Wid
ow Creede will also cite as extraordi
nary the provision In the will reciting
that if little Dorothy goes astray, her
share in the estnte is then to fall to
her guardian. This virtually, they will
allege, offers a premium to her guardi
an to see t" it that she does go astray.
The case will be hotly contested, and
sÂ«^nie very sensational developments are
promised, as the numerous relatives
under the pencil will have syndicated,
and are going to fight the matter to the
end.
FIRST SEIZURE
OF A SEALSKIN
Ail English Woman Has Her
Sack Taken at Niag
ara Falls.
However, the Garment Is Restored to
Her by Order of the Treasury
Department
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. âA Niagara
Falls special to the Herald says: The
tirst sealskin garment seized at the
poll of Suspension Bridge under the
new seal law was that of an elderly
Knglish woman. Miss Parks Smith,
who was traveling fror.. London, Onta
rio, to New York. She arrived last
evening about 8 o'clock in a sleeping
oar which was attached to the West
Shore train for New York at this
point. "When Miss Smith left London
there was a United States custom In
spector on the train. He noticed that
she had a sealskin sack.
When near the falls she heard for
the first time about the new seal
law. Some of the passengers advised
her to secrete the garment until she
had passed the frontier, afid. acting
upon the advice, she hid her sack
under a seat. When the car reached
the American side of the river the in
spector notified her that he would have
to take her sack. She told him he
would have to find it first. After
â evening the car unsuccessfully the
inspector ordered all the passengers
out. and another search resulted in the
finding of the sack. Inspector Ful
ston, who made the seizure, permitted
the woman to put on her sack and
iro with him to Collector of Customs
William Richmond.
The coll. ctor explained the law to
Miss Smith :m<l assigned Fulston to ac
company the woman to a hotel, where
Bhe delivered her sack over to him.
He called at the hotÂ»l this morning
with the garment. Miss Smith put it
on and accompanied him to the collec
tor's office, where Richmond advised
her to write to the department in
Washington, explaining the case. H<
thought she might get her sack hack
within a fortnight. Miss Smith had
about resigned herself to a long waif,
when relief came in the form of â 
telegram from Assistant Secretary
Howell of the Treasury Department to
Richmond, which said: Admit seal
skin garments imported as personal ef
fects if they are shown to have been
used by owner prior to 20th ult."
Collector Richmond immediately re
turned Miss Smiths sack to her. and
apologized for the annoyances that had
!>.â â¢ n caused her.

America Achieved a Diplomatic
Triumph Owing to the Skill or
Its Representatives.
Special Dispatch to The Call.

Washington, D. C., Jan. 11.
The State Department will transmit
t'Â« Congress the report of the commis
sion appointed to determine the
amount of the award dun to the Brit
ish Government under the decision for
the seizure of British sealing vessels
in Bering Sea. The report will be ac
companied by a letter from the Sec
retary of state requesting an appro
priation to pa- the Judgment, which
the honor of the Government is pledg
ed to promptly liquidate.
Examination of the report of the
commission will show that the criti
cisms which have been so recklessly
passed upon the results of the arbitra
tion of these claims are baseless, and
that on the other hand this Govern
ment has achieved a distinct diplo
matic triumph, due chiefly to the abil
ity and high technical skill of its rep
resentatives before the commission.
Messrs. Dickinson. Warren and Lan
sing. The department has guarded
with care The report of the commis
sion since it was received from Bos
ton several weeks ago. but Its leading
features were outlined with absolute
accuracy in the dispatches when the
i.-port of the arbitration board was
submitted. It will be seen at a glance
not only that Great Britain has been
obliged to content herself with a nom
inal sum as compared with claims
originally set up. but also the I'nited
States has reached a very substantial
advantage by submitting the question
at issue to a commission for adjust
ment rather than to have allowed the
compromise amount which Congress
was urged to accept In 1594. The
claims laid before the commission by
the British report amounted, with in
terest, to $1,417,134. while the total
award with interest, less credits due
the United States, is only $330,380. In
other words. Great Britain secures
only 25 per cent of the total amount of
her claim.
An examination of the awards in de
tail shows some striking figures. In
behalf of the ('ari'lena a claim of $."4.
066 was set up. which the commission
reduced to $22,362: for the Thornton,
$61,435 was claimed, but only $22. al
lowed, while the Onwards claim of $57.
623 was cut down to $15,715. The other
claims and awards were as follows:
Anna Beck, claim $80,221, award i 35
,-058: W. P. Say ward, claim $69,210.
award $20,262: Dolphin, claim $105, :;:::.

award 117.371; Ariel, claim '$31,719,
award $7406; Kate, claim $35,46.?.
award $4563: Minnie, claim $64,237.
award $12,657: Pathfinder (1890), claim
$5790, award $1170; Winnifred, claim
$9146. award $4344; Henrietta, claim
$29,328. award $12,021: Oscar and HaUie,
claim $15,581, award $2965.
In addition to these claims, the Brit
ish representatives demanded $29.,V.Â«S <>n
behalf of the Wanderer, which was re
fttsed bÂ»\ thÂ« commission. In addition,
the entire costs of the litigation over
the seizure of the \V. P. Sayward. of
which a test case was made in the
courts, amounting: to $88,2r>8, were pre-
Bented as a separate claim, but were
ruled out by the commission after b.-
ing stoutly contested by the American
representatives. The personal claims
presented amounted to $1^.668. but
these claims were cut down to 34'.Â».47."..
It is a highly significant feature of this
schedule that in no case has the com
mission allowed more than one-half of
the claims of <Jreat Britain, and this
fact is conclusive evidence of the
sweeping character of the victory
achieved by this government.
McKENNA'S NAME TO

It Is Believed a Favorable Report

NBW YORK. Jan. 11.â A special
to the Post from Washington on Judgv>
McKenna's nomination says: There
has been a free expression of doubt
among members of the committee as
to whether Judge McKenna is "a big

doubt is not strong enough seriously
to imperil a favorable report. Beyond
much doubt the Judiciary Committee
will report his name to trie Senate on

WASHINGTON. Jan. 11.â The fact
that the Judiciary Committee did not
report McKenna's nomination to-day,
but postponed it until Thursday, is not
an indication that the committee is
adverse to the confirmation. Senator

Ppooial Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOriS. Jan. 11.â The St Louis
and New Orleans Anchor line made an
assignment at noon to-day to Archi
ha!d Woods, conveying to him, for the
benefit of creditors, all of the steam
boats, barges, stork in store, elevator
landing's and other property of the
company of every kind. An assignment
of nil the property was decided on at
a meeting <>f \h>- board of directors
held yesterday, a resolution to that ef
fect having been passed and signed by
George S. Edge]], president; Gustave
( '. Meissonier. vice-president and gen
tral manager, and Theodore C. Weig
ler, sec-rotary.
An affidavit signed by Vice-Presi
dent Meissonier accompanied the as
signment, and he makes the statement
that the assets are worth $00,600. Xo
statement as to the amount of liabili
ties was made. There was an attack
made upon the credit of the line last
week, when the Tennessee Kiver Pack
et '<Vmpany filed an attachment suit
for $3800 and had the Sheriff levy on all
the property in the Anchor iine store
on the levee. This suit was brought on
a claim for rent for two of the Tennes
see River boats leased to the Anchor
line. The bill was settled and the
goods released by the Sheriff just be
fore the directors' meeting last night.
The Anchor Line was organized the
year after the war, and it was one of
the first combinations started in the
West. Prior to that time there were
short steamboat lines running between
St. Louis and Cairo. Cairo and Mem
phis, Memphis and Yicksburg. Vicks
burg and Natchez and Natchez and
New Orleans. These short lines were
all taken into the Anchor Line Com
pany. The small boats unsuitable for
the trade were condemned, laid up or
sold, and new boats were built. Two
lines were started, one between St.
Louis and Memphis and the other be
tween St. Louis and New Orleans. At
the various towns along the Mississippi
Kiver freight elevators were built, and
the controlling interest in these eleva
tors was h^ld by the Anchor Line or
people interested in i;.
Between 1866 and 1880 the AjichorLine
practically controlled the traffic on the
waterway between St. Louis and Mem
phis and New Orleans. About 1880 the
Mississippi Valley Transportation Com
pany of St. Louis was organized. This
line, with its powerful stern-wheel tow
boats and its barges, cut into the
Anchor Line"s business. The barges
and towboats could be operated cheap
er than the Anchor Line's floating pal
aces. Railroads were built on each side
of the Mississippi, and the passenger
travel went from the boats to the rail
roads.
Secretary Forbes Zeigler said to-day:
"The vast amount of liabilities has not
been determined, but there is no doubt
the assets will cover them fully. Hard
luck has pursued us for two years.
Disaster followed disaster, until we
were temporarily forced to the wall.
When the present Anchor Line Com
pany was organized there were seven
boats, the finest on the river, with an
average valuation of $50,000. There are
only three boats left now. The best of
our fleet have been lost or burned."

"Washington, Jan. 11.
The civil service debate, which was
inaugurated in the House a week ago,
ended to-day. It opened with a row,
but ended very- tamely. The Republi
cans who are seeking to modify or re
peal the law decided to let the debate
come to a close to-day, but It required
the casting vote of the Speaker to ac- j
complish this. There are conflicting
statements as to the situation in which
the future conduct of the war against j
civil service law is left. All the Repub- !
lican opponents of the law agreed that I
the fight is to be kept up, and it is j
positively stated by Pearson (R.) of |
North Carolina that assurances have '
been received from those in authority
In the House that an opportunity will ]
be given In the future for the consider- i
ation of a bill to modify the law. But
from other sources the statement can
not be confirmed. The debate was
quite dull until the closing hour, when
Simpson, the Kansas Populist, enliven- .\
ed it with some reference to the Ohio j
Senatorial election. Bailey, the Demo- j
cratic leader, made a clear statement
of the minority position, which indi
cated that the minority will vote to re- j
peal but not to mÂ«dify the law. The ;
principal speech of the day was made I
by Brosius, chairman. of the Civil Serv- !
Ice Committee, who defended the law I
in a two hours' speech.
Moody (R.) of Kansas, In charge of I
the executive and judicial appropria- ;
tion bill, in accordance with notice
given by him yesterday, moved in the
House, immediately after the reading
of the journal, that all debate on the
civil service bill be closed to-day at 5
o'clock. Considerable opposition was
manifested to the motion, but the
steering committee of the Republican
opponents of the civil service law had
agreed on this programme.
The antagonism to-day to the mo
tion to close the debate came, therefore,
principally from the Democrats. They
were well supported by the Populists
and a few Republicans who believed
the debate should go on. After some
wrangling the previous question was
ordered, on the demand of Mr. Moody
but the rising vote on the motion to
close the debate was very close â ayes
92, noes 85. and on the demand of the
Democrats the roll was called.
"When the roll-call was concluded the
motion to close debate stood defeated
by six votes. A recapitulation of the
vote was called for, and It was whis
pered about that assurance had been
received from the Rules Committee
that time would be given for the con
sideration of the measure prepared by
the Republican opponents of the law.
Three Republicans then changed their
votes, making it a tie. The Speaker
announced the vote as 125 to 125.
"A tie," added the Speaker, "and the
chair votes aye." Thus the Speaker
saved the day. and the motion to close
debate was carried. The Republicans
applauded most vociferously. The de
bate was then resumed.
Brosius. the chairman of the Com
mittee on Civil Service, opened with
an elaborate defense of the merit sys
tem and an argument for sustaining the
law.
Pearson <X.) of North Carolina askÂ«d
how the statement that the civil ser
vice law was economical could be re
conciled with the fact that the em-,
ployes of the Government had almost
doubled since 1893.
Erosius denied that this was true
The advocates of the spoils system, he
said, had repeated the statement untii
they believed it. Brosius said the pow
ers of the Civil Service Commission
were very limited. They could do lit
tle except at the direction of the Pres
ident, and when members hurled their
Javelins at the commission they went
over their heads and buried them
selves in the flanks of the chief exec
utive. Speaking of Orosvenor's attack
on Carl Bcharz, Brosius said the latter
probably threw it aside alter he had
read it, with Carlisle's remark: "An
other foul chimney caught fire."
Brosius spoke fur over two hours
Maguire (D.) of California defended
the last administration against the al
legations of wholesale removals and
commended the efficiency of the serv
ice, especially in the public printing
office, which had been an especial
point of assault from the outside. Ex-
Public Printer Benedict, he said, had
reduced the force in his office from
3600 to 2SOO, and had inaugurated con
spicuous reforms, lie charged Landis
of Indiana, who amused the House sev
eral days ago with some private mem
oranda of Benedict's secretary, with
Juggling and distorting the record.
He read a letter from Benedict's sec
retary, who is now in the daastfled
service, challenging Rome of Landis'
statements and offering to resign if the
Indiana member could substantiate
them.
After pnme remarks by Bell (P.) of
Colorado ami Eddy (R.) of Minnesota
Simpson fP.) of Kansas enlivened the
closing hour nf the debate with a ref
erence to the Senatorial contest in
Ohio. He said the debate had been
prolonged while Th<- Rf-publirans out in
Ohio were making jfromises to the
boys in the treqehea in the Interest of
Senator Hannn. It was ail a bluff, he
paid.
Nothing was to he done, and now that
Senator Hanna'B election was secured,
the mask was thrown off and a vote
was to be taken to-night on this bill.
"Whether the House would have an op
portunity later to consider a bill for
the modification or repeal of the law
I vould depend on the Speaker, said
: Simpson.
"He is the whole thing." exclaimed
! Simpson. "and runs the House."
i (Laughter.)
"Have you consulted the Speaker?"
I asked Quipg.
â¢N*<>." replied Simpson; "he never
consults me, and I never consult him."
Allen (D.) of Mississippi entertained
â¢ the House with one of his short humor
uus speeches.
Hailey (D.) of Texas, leader of the
i minority, closed the debate with some
remarks defining the attitude of the
Democrats. It was difficult, he said, to
[ believe in the sincerity of the other
', sid<>. when in on** breath the Repub
! llcans avowed their adherence to the
law, and in the next demanded its prac
tical destruction. If the law was good,
he said, it ought to be extended: if not,
it should be repealed. The Democrats,
he said, were ready to wipe it off the
statute books. They dii not believe in
life tenure, and. while the repeal of the
law might turn some of their friends
out of office, they stood by their party
platform.
With the conclusion of Bailey's re
marks, the time expired, and the bill
was reported to the Housp. It was
then discovered that those who desired
to vote to strike out the appropriation
for the' Civil Service Commission had
neglected to make the motion in com
mittee of the who! p. No vote, there
fore, could be taken, and the bill was
passed without division.

ciency bills were reported to th* House,

SALINAS, Jan. 11.â Sheriff Matthews
of this county is trying to locate a
man with several aliases who 13 want
ed here as well as in several other
counties for forgery. Frank Clark,
Frank Hubbard or James Stewart seem
to be the namea most preferred by the
swindler. He is a young man, and rep
resents himself as a blacksmith help

some merchant, usually a clothier, and
purchase about $3 worth of goods, gen
erally shirts, tender his check drawn
en some resident of the town, collect
the balance and decamp. He worked
the same game in San Luis Obispo and
Santa Barbara. In this city the man
purchased underwear, giving a check
on one of the local banks for $12 as
payment. The check was signed by a
well-to-do business man and seemed
all right, but upon presentation at the
bank it was pronounced a forgery. The
Sheriff was notified and a warrant
sworn out for the forger, but he had

been received from other southern cit

"Washington. Jan. 11.
The Senate to-day briefly discussed
an adverse report by the Pensions
Committee on a bill to pension General
Meade's two daughters at {100 a month
each. Chairman Aliinger Baying the
committee did not wish to enter on the
pensioning of the daughters of veter
ans. Allen of Nebraska thought that
General Meade's services justified such
liberality, but no action was taken, and
after Wolcott of Colorado announced
a speech on the money question for
next Monday, Senator Fairbanks ad
dressed the Senate on immigration.
Fairbanks began by referring to the
importance of guarding and preserving
the high standard of the country s pop
ulation and citizenship. The pending
bill, he said, by imposing a moderate,
reasonable educational test upon all
immigrants over lt> years of age,
throws an additional safeguard around
our population and citizenship.
"Prior to 1i575," he continued, "there
were no restrictive laws, except those
prohibiting coolie trade. In that year
more drastic measures were enacted to
suppress this reprehensible traffic, and
convicts and women imported for im
moral purposes were excluded. Subse
quently, further restrictive acts were
passed, aiming to reduce the flow of
the morally and physically diseased.
The presence of the;<e restrictive acts
upon the statute books has been bene
ficial, though the number who present
ed themselves at our ports and were
excluded in comparatively small. But
doubtless many were deterred from
starting by a knowledge of the laws in
force.
"Beginning with the la^t decade a
change occurred in both the national
ity and quality of our immigration.
Those immigrants who were chiefly of
the Slavonic countries began to come
in great and increasing numbers.
Among them were many very desir
able acquisitions; many from the bet
ter portions of Italy, Austria-Hungary
and other Eastern and Southern coun
tries were educated, enterprising and
brave, but the larger portion were ill
fitted to become a part of our popula
tion or to assume the privileges and re-
Bponstbllltlefl of American citizens.
They possessed â  low order of intelli
gence and a degradt-d standard of life,
and had no adequate conception of the
marvelous significance of our institu
tions.
'A rise in the ratio of immigration
from Eastern and Southern countries
from 8.5 to 51.7 per cent in seventeen
years and a fall in the ratio from the
"\Wsti-rn and Northern countries from
64.5 to 36.7 per cent in th>- same period
may well lead us to pause and inquire
whether the change is in the national
interest.
"The decrease in immigration has
br*- n from countries which have hith
erto sent us but a small per cent of il
literates, and the increase is from
countries where the ignorance is
greatest. Thirty-nine and nine-tenths
per cent of those above 14 years of age
coming from Austria-Hungary, Italy,
Poland and Russia last year could nei
ther read nor write, while only 3.6 per
cent of those from the TTnit^d King
dom, France. Germany and Scandina
via were illiterate. When we witness
this increased illiterate accession to
our population we may w<->n recall the
warning of George William Curtis:
'Let us beware how we wuter our life
blood.' "
In conclusion Fairhnnks quoted at
Ipngth statistics tending to show the
excessive contribution of the country's
foreign population to the number of in
mates of almshouses, penitentiaries, in
sane asylums and reformatory institu
tions. He insisted that the educational
test, as applied to immigrants, would
have a very direct effect in reducing
the number of contributions to the fore
going unfortunate objectionable classes.
The gravitation of undesirable emi
grants into the large cities and their
reinforcements of the slum districts,
was another of the evils to be in a
measure overcome. In this connection
the speaker declared that a patriotic
regard for those to whose interests we
owe first allegiance requires us to see
that the persona who present them-
H'lvts for competition in the industrial
field shall not be the degraded pauper
laborers from abroad. A low wage
scale, he added, is not consistent with
the most wholesome development of the
country and its people.
Allen introduced and secured the
adoption of a resolution calling upon
the President for information in his
possession relative to the boundary line
between Venezuela and British Guiana,
and to inform the Senate whether the
T'nited States now has any clerks or
other employes at work on the Vene
zuelan boundary question, and also
what part of the $100,000 appropriated
for the Venezuelan Commission has
been expended.
At 3:35 p. m. the Senate adjourned.

SECURITIES ARE
NOT YET SOLD
Unsecured Creditors of
the Union Pacific
Heard.
Foreclosure Under a Collateral
Trust Deed Is De
layed.
Efforts Made to Prevent Morgan From
Having an Alleged Unfair
Advantage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 11.â The interven
tion of unsecured creditors of the in
solvent Union Pacific Railroad at the
la.st moment prevented the sale of $16,
000.000 of securities, which was set for
to-day. The sale has been postponed
to January 26, but there Is a possibil
ity that it will not take place even
then. The securities, which are part of
147.900,606 involved in the suit brought
by J. P. Morgan &. Co. and others to
foreclose under a collateral trust deed
issued by the Union Pacific in IS9I.
were to be sold under Judge Lacombe'3
authorization to redeem $3,187,0u0 out
standing collateral notes. Some time
ago Judge Lacombe in the United
States Circuit Court signed a decree
giving to the Union Pacific Company
five days to redeem the notes in ques
tion. This was not done, and then the
trustees, of which J. P. Morgan is the
most active and the special master,
were directed to dispose of the securi
ties at auction or by private sale.
The unsecured creditors becoming
satisfied that if the sale was permitted
tht y would l.c th>- b>f ts decided to
bring a motion to show cause why the
Of securities should not be stopped.
Argument of this application took
place this afternoon, mid at its close
Judge Lacombe announced that he
would probably render a decision on
Saturday afternoon. It is believed this
will amend the bill of sale in several
important particulars.
George H. Yeamans and Roger Fos
ter, who appeared for the motion, said
that the sale, if allowed to proceed,
would give Morgan an unfair advan
tage, as one of the trustees who made
a compact with the note holders could
buy in the securities at a price below
their value, cut off bidders and at the
same time receive a bonus and interest
to the injury of general debtors.
It was further pleaded that the un
secured creditors be allowed to inter
vene and attack the decree. It was
charged that if the securities were dis
posed of at a receivers' sale they
would fetch more than if the trustees
and the special master were permitted
to dispose of them. The rÂ»-<' ( -ivers, rep
resented by Frederick R. Coudert, who
was in court, presented a long state
ment, In which they said they were en
deavorlng to dispose of the assets of
th" Union Pacific Railroad, which were
DOt w.rrth more than $10,000,600, and if
disposed of at auction would bring sev
eral million ]>â -
Victor Momwitz opposed the motion.
He declared th:it the Union Pacific coal
lands which were carried as worth $5,
000,000 were real.y worth but little, be
ing heavily mortgaged. He argued that
the general creditors yore not entitled
to any lien, arid said they should not
be entitled to intervene. All the cred
itors were fully protected, he said.
Judge Lacombe intimated there
should be some public notice of the or
der on which "h^ securities are to bÂ»Â»
sold, and that all bidders should have
an equal chance.
THE NEW DIVORCE
LAW SUSTAINED
Sonoma County's Clerk Upheld
by a Ruling of Judge
Dougherty.
Michael and Susie Must Wait Until
March 19 Unless They Take
*Â« Tug.
Sperla! Dlspatrh t. The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 11.â Judge
Dougherty decided to-day that County
Clerk Fulton acted In accordance with
law when a few days ago he refused
to Issue a license for the marriage of
Mlrhael MeDonough of Geyserville and
Mrs, Susie Baker of Healdsburg.
It was not on account of the youth
of the couple that the Clerk refused
them the legal permit, for MeDonough
ia 70 years old and Mrs. Baker is 53.
Clerk Fulton refused the license be
cause Mrs. Baker confessed to having
been divorced within the twelve months
prescribed by section 61 of the political
code as amended as the period which
must elapse bt-ft re remarriage after di
vorce.
The Judge in hla decision upheld the
divorce law. He said that just as in
California a white person was forbid
den to marry a negro, a mulatto or a
Mongolian, he thought the people had
a right to demand that persons who
had faik-d In one alliance should wait
for a suitable time before undertaking
another.
Mrs. Baker, when she applied for the
writ of mandate to compel the Clerk
to issue the license to her, contended
that section 61 did not apply to her, as
she was dlvorce<l before the law went
into effect.
Judge Douph^rty overruled this con
tention, holding that it was the duty
of the Clerk to ascertain of the party
whether he had been married or di
vorced within a year, and upon ascer
taining that he had should decline to
Issue the license. The Judge held that
he is not entitled to the license grant
ing immediate permission and consent
to marry until his disability la re
moved and he should not be granted a
license to carry out what the law pro
hibited.
It is thought that the old couple will
consent to remain single until after the
19th of Man h. when the long year af
ter Mrs. Baker obtained hor divorce
will have elapsed, rather than take a
tug and go out to sea beyond the reach
of the technicalities of the law. Both
are comfortabry situated.

VALLEJO, Jan. 11.â It was 10 o'clock
when the steamer Sunol arrived at Val
lejo this evening with about 200 pas
sengers. The sports repaired immedi
ately to Farragut Hall, and Young
Mitchell soon had the ball rolling.
Danny Mahoney and Charles Reno
boxed four rounds to an assemblage of
about 600 people. The weather was
cold, and doubtless many people re
mained away because of the rain and
the "throw down" Gallagher and Xeed
ham gave them in their fake fight of a
few weeks ago.
The master of ceremonies announced
to the small house that Frank McCon
nell, who was matched to fight Griffo
fifteen rounds, had refused to go on
and that "Kid" Parker of Los Angeles
was willing to meet Griffo in a contest
of six rounds. The sports objected to
this and after considerable discussion
rind much noise Fred Muller and Billy
Lewis, who fought Billy Gallagher
twenty rounds, volunteered to meet
Griffo and Lewis was accepted, as the
sports of Yallejo wanted to see Lewis
and Griffo at it.
Lewis broke his right arm some
months ago in a fight with Patsy Bren
nan. Tom Sharkey's trainer. Lewis'
fighting weight is 150 pounds. Griffo
entered the ring weighing 136 pounds.
Griffo said before he put on the gloves
that he did not intend to "fight for
keeps," as the house was too small.
Griffo had as his seconds James Mur
phy, James Conway and D. Holloran.
Lewis was esquired by Yank Savage,
Billy Gifford and Jack Stelzner. The
master of ceremonies announced that
the contest would b<* fifteen rounds.
When Lewis stripped he looked to be
at least 160 pounds, but he carried lots
Of superfluous flesh. He said that he
would make Griffo fight for once in his
life. Tom Sharkey was selected as ref
eree, and when he made his appearance
in the ring he was loudly cheered.
Griffo looked well and was perfectly
sober.
Lewia objected t<> fighting fifteen
rounds, and wanted tt-n rounds. He
also said that he wanted the contest to
be called a draw at the end of ten
nninds, but when Griffo refused to
agree to this Lewis said: "Let the
fight go on, and may the best man
win. Time was called at 11:30 o'clock.
First roundâ Grlffb stepp.-d nimbly
from his Â«â ::;. ir and met Lewis in the
center <>f the ring. Lewis swung his
right awkwardly at Griffo and the blow
landed <>n Griffo's shoulder. Lewis missed
and clint hed and was biased for hitting
in a clinch. Griff., landed his left flush
on the nose. Lewis was angry and
swung wildly at Griffo. who ducked the
blow, l.ut Lewis then wr.-stled with
Griffo am! put the Australian on his
back, Griffo got up find wanted to go to
his corner, when Lewis again went at
him. Griffo turned quickly and smasned
Lewis on the nose. This was followed
by a clinch and the gong sounded.
Second round- After Griffo planted his
left again on the imse he slipped and f.-Il
on his back, but was up ana at it again.
The Australian put his left time and
again on Lewis' nose and the Vallejo pet
in his mndiK'ss Dung himself bodily at
Griffo and some rough lighting resulted,
Griffo having the best of it.
Third roundâ Griffo put in a hot lift
on the body and another un the eye.
A^ain Griff.> landed on the nose Lewis
clinched and Griffo put him on his back.
Griffo followed up and smashed Lewis
again and again with his left on the face.
Some roujrh fighting followed, an-i Tom
Bharkey came in for a hot rtgh.. -r-Itik
on the jaw when trying to separate the
lighters.
Fourth roundâ Griffo opened with left
and riKht. but Lewis caught him under
r with a swinging blow, which only
angered the Australian. Lewis missed a
swine and caught two hot lefts on the
mouth. Then he attempted to wrestle
Griffo down, but Bharkey was there and
broke the men away. One. two, three
lefts on Lewis' nose and the gong
sounded.
Fifth round â Oriffo hammered his op
ponent as he pleased, but Ills blows did
not seem to annoy Lewis, who took them
and asked for more. Lewis did not hurt
Griffo, except in the clinches, when he
084 '! the Australian roughly.
Sixth roundâ Griffo had all the best of
this round on points. Lewis gave Griffo
one hard jab on the ear, but nearly all
his blows went wide of their mark.
Beventh roundâ This was an exciting
one. Griffo smashed Lewis until the lat
ter's face was painted a. bright red. At
the end of the round Lewis fell, with
Gr'.ffo under, but the Australian was not
hurt.
Kighth roundâ Griffo had it all his own
way. Lewis was swinging right and left
and Griffo was kept busy ducking the
swings. I^wis was the receiver from
first to Inst.
Ninth roundâ Lowis caupht somÂ° ter
rible smashes and almost KÂ°t stepped by
a heavy loft on the jaw. When the gong
sounded Lewis was very tired.
Tenth roundâ This was the last. It was
hot. Griffo smashed Lewis as before and
the latter clinched frequently. Lewis whs
knocked down and Tom Sharkey caught

face was all blond when the gong sound
ed the finish. Griffo got the decision.

CLAIMS HE CAN
PROVE AN ALIBI
Harry Winters on Trial
at Redwood City for
Murder.
Charged With Killing Andrews
at the Grand Hotel, South
San Francisco.
C. H. Raymond, Alias Moore, a Sup
posed Accomplice, Demands a
Separate Trial.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 11.â Harry
Winters, who with C. H. Raymond at
tempted to rob the Grand Hotel at
South San Francisco during the early
part of November last and who i.?
charged with the murder of Charles A.
Andrews, is now on trial for the killing
of Andrews. The selection of a jury
commenced this morning in the Su
perior Court at this place.
Winters has employed P. B. Nagle
Jr. to conduct his defense, and from the
line of questions asked to-day of the
jurymen it is evident that he will rely
upon proving an alibi. He has been
positively identified by a number of
persons as being the man seen around
the hotel on the day of the murder,
and was also identified as one of the
men In the hotel on the night in ques
tion.
Out of about forty veniremen only
five were chosen to sit on the jury. The
regular panel, of whom there were only
nineteen, was exhausted about 2 o'clock
this afternoon, and a special venire of
twenty had to be subpenaed. At this
rate it will take all day to-morrow at
least to get a jury, and probably longer,
and it is doubtful whether the case
will be concluded this week.
Attorney Nagle asked the permission
of the court to withdraw the plea of
not guilty for the purpose of moving
to set aside the information, but the
court held that there was no merit in
the proceeding and refused to allow it
to be done.
An affidavit of defendant was then
read, in which he sought to procure
a continuance of one month. The
! ground for the same was that certain
i witnesses for the defendant were peo
; pie without money whose attendance
! could not be procured for the reason
that they could not stand the expense
of coming here. If a month's con
tinuance were granted the defendant
thought he would be able to raise suf
j ficient funds to get them. A further
â¢ ground was that there were certain
! necessary witnesses whose residence
was not at the present time known to
j defendant. These latter were material
witnesses who would prove a complete
! alibi.
The court denied the motion, remark
of '90 and is 28 years of age. Since that
time he has acted as Deputy Postmas
ter under both administrations, with
the exception of a few months when he
was engaged in reportorial work in San.
Francisco. During the last campaign,
he acted as secretary of the Gilroy Re
publican Club, and worked indefatiga
bly for the interests of the party. He
is eminently qualified for the position.
ing that if money were need to secure
the attendance of any witnesses he
would see that it was forthcoming. Th?
selection of the jury was then taken up
and continued until adjournment this
afternoon, with the result above men
tioned.
C. H. Raymond, alias Moore, who is
charged jointly with Winters, was in
court with his attorney, Charles N.
Kirkbride. As they have demanded
separate trials the case of Raymond
was passed until to-morrow morning.
The same steps will probably be taken
each day until the conclusion of the
trial of Winters.
C. A. Andrews was shot down in the
Grand Hotel as he was coming from
his bedroom with a light in answer to
the calls of Patrick Ferriter, who had
grappled with the robber in the dark.
Raymond was arrested the morning fol
lowing the crime on the road to San
Francisco. Winters was caught in
San Francisco a number of days later.
A third man who is supposed to be im
plicated in the affair is still at large.
For his capture a reward of $250 has
been offered by the County Supervi
sors.
A well-known scientist, who has been
studying the skins of negroes and
whites, declares that by the proper ap
plication o-f electricity a black man can
soon be turned white.

T.r>p ANGELES, Jan. 11.â By one bold
stroke, Walter L.. Webb to-night shat
and broke away the mask of hy
pocrisy from the faces of the two men
in the Hoard of Education who have
been most actively interested in his
prosecution. He compelled J. H. Braly
to admit that he had committed a fel
onious act while acting as a school dl
â  â  â¢ r, and put Charles Cassat Davis,
the chairman of the board, ami the rep
tative of the League for 1
City Government, on record as a man
untit to sit as chairman of the board
whilo any matter of corruption was un
der investigation.
Not only this, but he completely
turned the tables on his accusers and
itors He took the aggressive,
captured the enemy's guns and has
them now aimed point blank at their'
owners. It was one of the most
-ions of the present In
gation, aiid the climax came just
members were about to adjourn.
Without any preliminary words Webb
â :ii>sioii t<> introduce a reso
in his hand. This being
ted he read the document, which
Braly, on the strength of
ivits and articles pub
â  all. with having violated
: the State in cashing school
rants, and which further
i â¢â¢. Li i ; : aly be put on his trial
rd us soon as the present
investigation is cloÂ»
It came iis an utter surprise to Mr.
Braly and his friends, and their con
â¢ iti â¢!! was evident. Chairman
Davis lost his nerve only momentarily.
When he recovered he said the resolu
tions were not in proper shape and
that he would not vote for them. The
charges against Webb, he declared,
signed, and he thought these
Webb denied that any charges were
brought a-ainst him. He said the in
vestigation <>f the charges against him
rtaken on the adoption of a
â  n solution to that which he
â  r to have passed.
This I "avis emphatically denied, but
a subsequent investigation of the rec
showed that Webb was right and
Davis wrong.
Nothing <!aunted by Davis' tactics,
Webb signed the resolutions, and ev
ery member present, Kraly excepted,
i fur them. The only member ab
sent was Kubach, the new Director.
Then another bitter pill was admin
istered to the League for Better City
Government and its proteges and
members. Davis and Braly. Chairman
Davis asked for suggestions as to how
charges against Braly should be pre
tt suggested the same
parties who are carrying on the prose
cution against Webb take charge of
the Braly matter.
"Thi etter City Govern
ment'. 1 asked the chairman, in as\on
ishment.
"Yes, sir." smilingly answered Bart
lett, and a motion to that effect was
duly carried.
>rney '"liver, for Webb, opened
- by submitting a sum
of the affidavits which had been
by the teachers and other em
the school department as part
â¢â  the use. This show
ed that there are 4T.5 teachers in the
tment; that 4-' A had filed affida
vits and thirteen others had testified
. ; that there are fifty-three jani
d the department, and that forty
of them had filed affidavits; that
â  achers had been asked to pay for
â  positions by C. H. Axtell and J.
F Adams; that two teachers had paid
for their positions to J. F. Adams; that
two janitors had paid for th<-ir posi
tions, r#ne to J. S. Pitman and one to
-C H. Axtell; that teachers had busi
ness relations with members of the
present board during their u-rm of of
fice, as follows: Seven with Mathias,
tine with Poor, two with Conney, r.ix-
Pf: n with Bartlett, two with "Davis,
two with Adams, three with Melnerney
f. yen with Braly, six with Webb; that
lachera and janitors examined out
of 4^l believed their appointment due
to their qualifications and that one tes
r=he believed her appointment was
du>- to the friendship of Mr. Conney.
r this was filed as evidence in

had been subpoenaed to explain these
transactions. The first two called, Miss

Davis left the chair and explained that

Miss Whitlock and she had consulted
him about, it. He was a friend of the
family and had made no charge for
his i ervi(
Having finished his statement Mr
Davis resumed the chair.
Carrie M. Blanford was called but
was reported to be too ill to be pres
ent^ he , is. the school teacher who
holds Davis* note for $200, the partic
ulars of which were told in yesterday's
issue of The Call.
E. P. Rowell, one of the principals
v.-ho was asked to pay for his position
by th.- Axteii-Adams combination, fail
< '1 1" r.-s]iond.
At this point Attorney E. A Me
perve for the defense said he would like
it to he understood that the teachers
who failed to attend in answer to a
subpoena were guilty of a misde
meanor.
Mips Clara M. Preston, who has been
a teacher for six years in the schools
of I.os Angeles, t<-stine,i that she had
(.â¢cured a loan at Braly's hank during
4|ugust last. The matter had been re
f. rred to Mr. Hraly. who at the time
did not know her as a teacher. The
loan was afterward consummated
through the regular channels in the
bank.
Mrs. Emma A. Thurston, principal of
the Custer School, testified that she
cashed her November warrants at the
Southern California Savings Bank, of
which J. H. Braly is president. She
did not see Mr. Braly there. The
amount of the warrant was $115. She
paid $1 to have it cashed.
George A. Leslie testified that he had
gone to Mr. Conney to have some deeds
drawn up.
Mrs. Gregory failed to respond. She
was dropped from the teachers' list
owing: to her poor rating. Attorney
Oliver said he wanted to prove by her
that the Times had published a faked
Interview with her, which interview
she had subsequently repudiated. The
alleged interview made Webb and
Bartlett appear In an objectionable
light.
Attorney Oliver attempted to read
the Times article, but Attorney Taylor
for the prosecution objected. He was
thrown into a condition of silence for
the rest of the evening by the charge
made by Mr. Meserve that the prosecu
tion had introduced nearly everything
with the possible exception of the Dec
laration of Independence and the Ten
Commandments. Much of their testi
mony, he added, was as irrevelant as
the Book of Genesis. Mr. Meserve con
tinued by saying he did not understand
why the teachers who had been sub
poenaed did not attend and said that if
they did not come hereafter they would
be prosecuted for misdemeanor.
Then came the bombshell of the de
fense. A motion to adjourn until 7:30
to-morrow evening had been made and
seconded. Before it could be put Webb
arose and quietly asked that he be al
lowed to introduce a resolution. This
privilege was granted him and he read
I the following:
Whereas, during the examination by
this board of the charges against Walter
L.. Webb it has been Btated In certain
affidavits on file, and in the San Fran
cisco Call of January 4. J v i'V that J. H.
Braly. the pr< Bent Red and
actlnÃ repres< ntative of the Fifth Ward
upon the Board â  I Ed â¢â  ation of the city
of Los Ann- Irs. had, while acting as
such representative of said ward, at dif
ferent dates during the year lvT. re
ceived a benefit by cashing, through the
Savings Bank of Southern California, a
corporation, of which he is president,
certain teachers' and other warrants,
among which the i have been
named: "Warrant No. 12,221 in favor of
Miss M. E. O'Brien of Ban Francisco f<->r
Warrant in favor oi Mrs. Emma
Thurston for the sum of $115. Warrant
In favor of George E. Roeding for $2" 40.
Warrant in favor of Luella A. Duncan
for $72. â¢â 
And whereas, said acts are in violation
nf the laws of the State of California,
and particularly of section '.'23 of the Po
litical Code and Bectlon 71 of the Penal
, as follows:
Political rodeâ The State
Treasurer ami Controller, the several
county, city or town officers of this
State, their deputies and clerks, are pro
hibited from purchasing or selling, or in
any manner receiving to their own use
or benefit of any person or p< i
whatever, any State county or city war
rants, script, orders, demands, claims or
other evidences oi Indebtedness against
the State or any county or city thereof,
except evidences of indebtedness Issued
to or held by tht-m for services rendered
as such officer, deputy or clerk and evi
dences of the funded Indebtedness of
such State, city, town or corporation."
"Section 71. Political Cod< â Every offi
cer or person prohibited by the laws of
this State from making or being inter

provisions of such laws, is punishable by
a fine of not more than one thousand dol
lars, or by imprisonment in the State
prison for not more than five years, and
Is forever disqualified from holding any
office in the State."
Therefore be it resolved. That it is the
duty this Board of Education owes to the
city of Los Angeles in general, an<l the
School Department and J. !:. Braly In
particular, that charges shall at on^e be
red for the i urpone of Investigating
the* matters aforesaid, said charges to be
taken up upon the conclusion of the in
vestigation now in progri
WALTER L. WEBB.
Wh"n he had concluded its reading
he moved its adoption. Bartlett
seconded his motion. Then came a few
seconds of profound silence. It was
broken by Chairman Davis.
"So far as I can see," he said, "when
any charges have been made they were
made directly over the signatures of
some of the members, and thereupon
thy- board has proceeded to investigate.
It occurs to me that Mould be a more
proper course than this, and I suggest
that that be don.-."
"No charges were ever presented
against me," declared Webb. "The in
vestigation was begun in this ease on
a single resolution that was not
signed."
Here Bartlett took a hand. "We hear
rumors and reports," he said, "from
one part of the State or another, and
we ought to clear them up. If then
is anything against me I would thank
the committee for bringing charges
against me. I don't think these rumors
will be < leared up until we get to the
bottom of these things."
Braly in tremulous voice made an ef
fort to prevent the adoption of the
resolution.
"It may be in order for me to say
a word. There Is no occasion for any
investigation. The facts that have
been mentioned in the resolution can
be ascertained. There was that $2LTi
bill referred to of Miss O'Brien." He
then made a similar explanation to
that published in The Call of Janu
ary 4.
Chairman Davis went on record
against investigating his fellow-mem
ber of the League for Better City
Government.
"I want to state my reasons for vot
ing against this resolution," he began.
"When charges that are presented
hr>re are over the signature of either a
member of the board or of any other
person I shall vote to Investigate. I
am not willing, however, to vote fur
the resolution to Investigate simply
upon general rumors. Whenever the
charges are put in shape and signed
by any gentleman I shall be willing to
vote for investigation."
Webb reiterated his claim that no
specific charges had been filed against
him and that no signature was at
tached to the resolution calling for an
investigation.
Davis claimed that the resolution
was signed by Conney and himself,
but Conney denied this.
Webb ended the discussion on this
point by saying, "I am willing to Rign
this because the league is afraid to
sign it."
Webb attached his signature and It
was carried by the votes of Poor. Con
ney, Bartlett, Davis, Mathls. Mdner
ney and Webb. Braly asked to be ex
cused from voting.
"The preparation of charges de
volves upon some committee," sug
gested Chairman Davis.
"Why not the same parties who have
carried on the present case?" asked
Bartlett.
"The league?" said Davis, somewhat
taken aback.
"Yes, sir," answered Bnrtlett. Bart
lett made a motion to that effect and
it was carried.
Adjournment was taken until 7:30
p. m. to-morrow.

Special Dlepatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 11.â The mys
terious disappearance of Edwin K. Al-
Flp has caused quite a flurry In commer
cial circles. Since Friday last no word
has been received from him. To-night's
Bee contains the following statement:
A Bee reporter visited Mrs. E. K. Al.slp
at her home la this city this morning.
but Mrs. Alslp could say no nwre than
that she had expected her husband home
last Friday night. She did not regard
his absence as strange, however, in view
of the fart that his business often called
him away.
Two deeds, which transfer all of Al
sip's real and personal property to hln
wife, were filed with County Recorder
Cohen at 10 o'clock last Friday morn
ing by W. Elmer Brown, who is con
nected with Alsip's office. After Brown
had given both deeds to P. Human, the
deputy for filing, he gave a mortgage
whereby Alsip mortgaged stated por
tions of his property to Mrs. Caroline
Swinnerton to secure $SSOO borrowed
from her.
By the terms of the first deed Alsip
gives to his wife, Mrs. Mary A. Alslp,
the consideration being love and af
fection, all the property situated ly
ing and being in the county of Sacra
mento, designated and described aa all
unsold lots in Oak Park and South
Sacramento as described upon the map
or plan of said Oak Park and South
Sacramento as tiled in the County Re
corder's office of the county and State
afftresaid, all unsold lots and half
acres in subdivisions A, B and C, and
all half-acre lots, and all lot
acreage property as described upon the
map of Â«)ak Park, or upon Oak Park
and South Sacramento; also all real or
pro] rty of every kind or na
ture wherever found In Sacramento or
Placer counties; also the land upon the
Louisiana tract, the Anderson tract in
Sacramento County: also "my undivid
ed one-third interest in the Sunset Col
onies or Fair Oaks, and Fair oaks ad
dition to Sacramento County."
The second deed to his wif<\ the con-
Blderation being the samo. transfers to
her all <if Alslp'a property described
as th<> vest half of lot 6, blocks R and
s. Nineteenth and Twentieth streets;
also blocks X and Y. Twentieth and
Twenty-first streets; l"ts 3, 4, 5,
S, 7 and B, blocks W and X.
Twenty-first and Twenty - second
streets; also undivided interest in lot
fi. blocks 0 and P, Twenty-first and
Twenty-second streets, subject to mort
gage of $2000. due G. G. Locke, and a
mortgage of J3OOO, due Theodore Ker
gel.
Hoth Of these deeds are dated Janu
ary 'Â ISÂ«.ih. Th* .nortgage which
Brown next handed to the Deputy Re
corder for filing states that Edwin K.
Alsip has mortgaged the following
property to Caroline G. Swinnerton to
secure a promissory notÂ»- for S^.no: All
that property in the county of Sacra
mento described as half acre lots from
102 to lit, both inclusive, as per map
of Oak Park and South Sacramento
on file in the County Recorder's office;

south 66 1 * acres of lots 11 and 30, as per
map of the Anderson tract on file in
the County Recorder's office of Sacra
mento County: also "my portion of
the south quarter of section 20 and
<;iÂ«t half of section 29, township S
north, range 8 east."
All three documents â the two deeds
to AWp'i wife, giving her all his prop
erty, and the mortgage to Mrs. Swin
nerton â are of the same date, January
E, 1898. and all three are in Alsip's
handwriting and were attested by Al
fred Enquist, a notary public of San
Francisco, on the day on which the
instruments are dated.
At the Recorder's office It was deem
ed somewhat singular that deeds which
were of such a sweeping character
should be followed by a mortgage for
JSSOO on certain of the property which
it was supposed was included in the
deeds to his wife.
The most peculiar document filed by
Mr. Alaip was a mortgage to Mrs.
Bwinnerton, for whom he has been
transacting business for many years.
In an interview published in to-night's
I.<-<-, Mrs. Bwlnnertoo says:
"Mr. Alsip has been attending to my
property, collecting rents rind making
loans for me. Every month in all that
time he would present a statement,
which would show me exactly how my
affairs stood. He never made a loan
without consulting me, although he
had my power of attorney to do so, as
he thought best. But I know nothing
about this last loan. I do not remem
ber his ever saying to me that he de
sired to borrow money from me on his
own account. When my husband, died,
thirteen years ago. he told me I
should trust Mr. Alsip with my bust
ness affairs, and I have done so im
plicitly. I have the utmost confidence
in him, and I believe that he has al
ways acted in my interest. As I have
said, I did not know of the existence of
this 18600 mortgage until I was told
about it to-day. I am a woman, and,
of course, not familiar with these mat
ters. Hut I look to Mr. Alsip with con
fidence that he will explain every
thing to my satisfaction when he
comes back."
The last seen of Mr. Alsip in this
city was on Wednesday of last week,
when he appeared before Notary Al
fred A. Enquist, at the latter's office
on Montgomery street, to acknowledge
his signature to the documents above
mentioned. Inquiry among prominent
real estate men yesterday failed to
elicit any clew to the whereabouts of
the missing man or to suggest a sat
isfactory theory as to the cause of his
disappearance .
ESTERHAZY IS
NOW CLEARED
Is Found Not Guilty of
the Charges Made
Against Him.
Upon Being Liberated the
Count Receives Quite
an Ovation.
Fresh Chapter of Scandal Added by
the Arrest of a Couple for
Blackmail.
â 
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
PARIS, Jan. 11.â Count Esterhazy '
has beeen unanimously acquitted.
The taking of testimony ended at 5
o'clock this afternoon, when the gov
ernment's representative briefly ad
dressed the court. Counsel for Major
Esterhazy followed. The secret delib
eration of the court-martial, which fol
lowed, terminated at 8:15 p. m., when
the president read the judgment as
follows:
"The president put the following
question to the court: 'Is Major Ester- j
hazy guilty of having had dealings
with a foreign power or its agents to
incite them to commit hostilities or \
undertake war against France, or pro
cure the means of doing so?' The pres
ident in giving his opinion said the
court declared unanimously upon the
aforesaid question that the accused was
not guilty."
The president then ordered Major Es
terhazy to be liberated.
Mathieu Dreyfus, on emerging, was
not recognized by the crowd. Colonel
Plcquart. who followed him, was ac
companied by some friends.
Major Esterhazy appeared alone at
8:20 p. m. and proceeded to the prison
i of Cherche Midi. The crowd greeted him
with cries of "Vive l'Armee," "Vive le
Commandant Esterhazy." and tried to
shake hands with him. Directly Ester
hazy entered the prison the police
cleared the streets.
The police have arrested and impris
oned Madame Jeouffrey d'Abbans and
her paramour on the charge of black
mailing an army captain. A number of
letters supporting the charge have been
seized. Madame Jeouffrey d'Abbans is
said to have been formerly known as
: a doubtful character, passing under the
name of Chabol. She married and has ;
since been divorced from an elderly
nobleman, M. Jeouffrey d'Abbans. She
i pretended to be Major Esterhazy's '
, "veiled lady." and was examined dur- j
; ing the inquiry.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TRADING STAMPS.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: There
has been during the past few weeks ar
ticles in most of the American papers
relative to trading stamps, tht_-ir origin
and the system in general.
These article* have been, in many
cases, either superficial, inaccurate or
bias 4 â !.
It is a surprising fact that, althongh
we have 137 clearing h uses in the East,
the plan is very Uttlfl known on the
Pacific Coast, and \v>- take this oppor
tunity of setting before the public the
trading stamp Bystem, privileges and
advantages so fully recognized in sev
enty erf the greatest Eastern cities.
Divested of all superfluous language
the origin of the system and the plan
upon which it operates is as follows:
In I*l*4 I established in Jackson. Mich.,
a plan of commission advertising by
means of which merchants endeavored
to .. fas.- their cash business through
the agency of a rebate; the rebate be
ing given by the means of trading
stamps, the said stamps being exchang
ed through a clearing ho-us.- for any
article as designated in a catalogue is
sued by me as the agent of the mer
chant who gave his customer the
stamps.
The plan was from the first a great
success; it spread to other cities, and
early in lv; I entered Into partnership
with Mr. Sperry, with headquarters at
320 Broadway, New York, and not till
May last did the system provoke un
favorable comment.
The great success of the preen trad
ing stamp movement raised up imita
tors like miishnÂ»'ms after a ram; many
of thes Deems being irresponsible
and by reason of their Irresponsibility
brought the system in some quarters
into disrepute.
The plan upon which my company
operates is for the retail storekeeper to
receive from us our official green trad
ing stamp, paying a uniform rate for
same when presented for redemption
He then (and we in conjunction with
him) by means of systematic advertis
ing acquaint the purchasing public that
for every ten-cent cash purchase they
will receive one green trading stamp
These trading stamps are to be col
lected and pasted in a book, which we
furnish to the customer free.
We maintain in each city, as the
agents understand, of these storekeep
ers, one or more clearing housesâ In oth
er words, one or more stores or ex
changes at which the customer pre
sents his or her book tilled with green
trading stamps, and in exchange for
this book Is given any article which he
or she may select.
It will be at once apparent that these
trading stamps benefit the purchasing
public: that is. they are a rebate on
cash purchases â they discredit the sys
tem <-f purchasing on credit: they prac
tically give the cash purchaser a re
bate which the old system of business
could not â or would not â do.
Now let us glance at the benefit
which the storekeeper derives.
For many years the greatest curse of
some of our commercial communities
has been the ever-growing tendency to
ask fi-r credit; many otherwise live
merchants have had to allow a gTeat
deal of this credit.
Competition has forced them tn allow
credit; 'tis also true that credit forced
thf-m to charge higher prices.
They had to run long and heavy
book debts, they had many tones, they
had to recoup themselves some way
and as a matter of fact the cash cus
tomer, strange a? if may srp m on
first impulse, paid for part of the losses
Incurred through giving credit.
With such a state of affairs it is not
to be wondered at that any system
that would tond to build up trade on a
cash basis was eagerly welcomed*
The merchant when accepting the
system laid down by the Oreen Trad
ing Stamp Company was paying a
small percentage in ord^r firstly to In
crease bis cash sales and, as it has
almost universally proved, the system
has worked up a vast new trade and
materially increased the merchant's
business who gave these trading
stamps away.
The Trading Stamp Company, In
other words, aimed to boom business in
general â they have been one of the
largest advertisers Cfor the merchants
who deal in their stamps) that the com
mercial world has seen for many years.
They advertise the merchant at a far
cheaper rate, in a more extensive way,
get better results, than the average

workâ all this system, all the results
are for and in behalf of the merchant
and done at a less than 5 per cent dia
et unt basis.
The violent opposition to the trading
stamp system emanates from those
who know little or nothing of its work-
Every argument has been used at dif
ferent times to throw discredit on the
system of trading stamps.
"Blackmail has even been resorted to,
threatening and defamatory articles
have been written against us for which
two men of Brooklyn, N. V., are now
serving five years' imprisonment.
In Bridgeport, Conn., the trading
Btamp system (in the face of violent
opposition) broke up the coal combine,
put thousands of dollars in the public
pocket and to-day is flourishing in
Bridgeport. And one of the leading
members of the coal combine is now
acting as an agent for merchants who
dispense trading stamps.
Like everything new the system
needs study, for it is an advertising
proposition, pure and simple.
It is to the merchant, in many cases.
just as he may happen to see through
his business experience.
We all know that some of the
shrewdest business men will not ad
vertiseâ strange to say some of these
met have even built up immense busi
r esses. ,
Some business men believe In news
papers â others shun them.
Many firms offer a cash discount â
f>nu emphatically won't.
Because these inconsistencies are ap
paient. would it be right to condemn
advertising in general as so much
wasted energy, money and time?
Every now and again the pulse of
the commercial world throbs with new
life Business is imbued with renewed
activity, such lifeâ such activity is al
ways the result of some great move
ment of an upward and revolutionary
nature; such is the trading stamp sys
tem.
It Is a huge method of putting new
energy into every business house which
takes up its principles; there is no
business house which is exempt from
its influences.
The keynote of the success of the
green trading stamp movement is the
fact that it has for its fundamental
principle the discouragement of credit
accounts and it aims to enlarge cash
trade.
Now as to the question of responsi
bility.
Messrs. Sperry & Hutchlnson have
half a million dollars invested in this
business.
We are not new â we are not of, the
mushroom growth.
In existence since 1894, the green
trading-stamp system can be very
quickly placed at its proper commer
cial rating: if any interested person will
take the trouble to ask for a special
report from Dun or Bradstreet.
Its origin, progress and success are
an open book, and can be read by
everybody.
We are among the largest buyers of
general merchandise, one of the largest
advertisers in the United States.
"We pay spot cash for everything,
and we have always dealt justly with
all our principals.
But, in conclusion, we think it only
fair to ask every person to carefully
examine into the system before ex
pressing an opinion for or against it.
The fact remains we are only agents.
The storekeepers who dispense our
green trading stamps are our princi
pals. We sell nothing; we only ex
change.
There can, therefore, be no opposi
tion to us on the ground that we are
competitive merchants.
The green trading-stamp system in
augurated and exclusively carried on
by Messrs. Sperry & Hutchinson has
proved itself to be one vast advertis
ing plan, and as such, and with these
remarks, we leave it to the considera
tion of the purchasing public.
Thanking you for the courtesy of
your columns, we are, Mr. Editor,
yours respectfully,
SPERRT & HT T TCHTXKON.

SERIOUS ACCIDENT IN A
NEVADA PLANING-MILL
D. B. McFaul Has His Right Hand So
Seriously Crushed That Amputation
May Be Necessary.
MADERA, Jan. 11.â D. B. McFaul.
who has been in the employ of the Ma
dera Milling Company for a number of
years, met with a very serious acci
dent this afternoon. Mr. McFaul was
operating one of the machines in the
planing department, when in some
manner his right hand was caught be
tween the heavy rollers of the machine
and before it could be stopped the
fingers and thumb of that member
were frightfully crushed and broken.
When assistance came to the injured
man it took the combined efforts of
four men, with crowbars, to lift the
heavy roller sufficiently to allow the
mechanic to withdraw his hand. It is
not known yet whether the injured
member will have to be amputated or
not.

MADE READY FOR THE JUBILEE.
RAPIDLY the day for the opening of the
Golden Jubilee approaches. In a time com
paratively short it will be here. Those who
intend to contribute to the fund for the public de
monstration or to decorate their homes and places
of business have no time to lose in making prepara
tions. Whatever is to be done must be done at once
in order to have it timely and opportune for the
freat occasion.
The celebration is to be an important one for San
Francisco. It will attract the attention of the whole
country and the result will be used as a basis for es
timating the civic patriotism and public spirit of the
people. We must make the celebration something
more than an ordinary street parade or disappoint
popular expectation and feel the effect of the disap
pointment in a diminished attendance at the expo
sition of mines and mining.
Individual taste and skill should co-operate with
the jubilee committee in the decoration and adorn
ment of the streets. Along the whole line of march
the city should show itself in brilliant array. What
was accomplished during the convention of the
Christian Endeavorers should be surpassed and
eclipsed. We have invited people from all parts of
the Union to come and Dake part in the festival, and
it now behooves us to give them a reception suffi
ciently impressive to repay them for the journey,
even if they have come all the way across the con
tinent.
Although enough money has been contributed to
the fund to assure a notable pageant for the parade,
it is rot yet too late to add further contributions to
the amount and help to make the display more
gorgeous and more beautiful still. As the celebra
tion is to make a genuine popular holiday, it should
have a liberal popular support. It is one of the
movements in which all citizens can give help and
take part, and it is to be hoped a sufficient number
wiil do so to prove to all coiners that civic pride and
artistic taste are common to all classes of our people.
AN INCOMPLETE BILL.
IT is said there will be introduced into Congress
a bill providing that every person who copy
rights a book in this country shall, in addition
to the two copies filed in the Library of the United
State? at Washington, deposit also a copy in the
State Library of each of the, forty-five States.
It is the opinion of the advocates of the measure
that the bill will be of great advantage to the li
s of the various States, and there can be no
question of the soundness of the belief. The bill
however is incomplete. Why give an advantage to
libraries not given to other State institutions?
Why impose upon authors a burden not imposed
upon other recipients of copy and patent rights?
The bill should be so amended as to provide that
every man who takes out a patent for a farming
implement should send one of the implements to
each State Agricultural College. Every man who
copyrights a brand of fruit, oyster";, canned meat,
soup, boots and shoes, hats, gloves or tobacco
should be compelled to send samples to every
poorhousc in the Union. Every man who patents
a medicine should have to give samples to all
State Medical Colleges. All the holders of patents
to mines should send specimen ores to all museums
of mineralogy. All inventors of an}' kind of â¢ me
chanical appliance should send working models
to all mechanical schools conducted under State
patronage.
The proposed amendments would make the bill
of advantage not only to State libraries, but to all
schools, colleges, museums and poorhouses. It
would place authors upon an equality with all other
holders of patent and copy rights. It would con
fer benefits upon a wide class of citizens who do
not read books. If we are going to give the States
something for nothing, the more we give them the
more logical will we be and the better will they
like it.
In all seriousness, the bill shows an utter dis
regard of the property of authors. Its advocate
evidently believes that books come by gift of na
ture and not by labor and industry.
We are as eager as any one to see all State li
braries advanced, but we believe that can be done
in a much better way than the one proposed. In
stead of taking books from a poor author who can
not afford to give them, and whose books in all
probability would be of little credit to the libraries,
we suggest that each member of Congress be re
quired to contribute a portion of his salary to each
public library in his district, leaving the trustees
to use the money in the purchase of such books as
the library most needs.
The man who asks "What is the matter with
Hanna?" will merely be showing that he does not
read the papers. The outlook was a little dark for
a time, but friends of Hanna, observing that he had
won the dislike of Hearst's papers, never faltered in
their belief of success.
PLANS FOR CURRENCY REFORM.
THE standard of value and the place proposed
for the silver currency, in the plan of the Cur
rency Commission, have been considered. The
effect intended is to find use for the silver owned by
the Government by retiring all paper currency of
less than $10 denomination and filling its place with
silver certificates of less than $10. There will be no
contraction of the currency, because the greenbacks,
national bank notes, etc., of small denominations re
tired will be reissued in denominations of $10 and
over.
The next point to be considered is the obligations
of the Government which the treasury is compelled
to redeem on demand and to reissue. The commis
sion proposes the gradual retirement of these de
mand obligations which now constitute "the endless
chain" by which the gold reserve of the treasury is
diawn out without reducing the volume of demand
obligations used for that purpose.
The demand notes of the Government, payable in
gold on presentation and required by law to be im
mediately reissued, are the greenbacks and coin notes
of i&)0, amounting to $455,994,296.
The commission proposes to create in the treasury
a division of issue and redemption, separate from the
ordinary fiscal functions of that department. To this
division the gold reserve held against the demand ob
ligations will be transferred, and they will be handled,
redeemed, issued or canceled in this division.
The gold reserve is to be maintained from the rev
enues when they are adequate, otherwise by the sale
of short time bonds.
When the notes are redeemed in gold they arc
to be canceled up to $50,000,000. and thereafter for
live years the amount canceled shall only equal the
increase in bank notes, thereby avoiding contraction
of the currency. After five years the notes redeemed
are to be canceled at the rate per annum of 20 per
cent of the whole amount of notes then outstanding.
At the end of ten years the legal tender quality of
the notes still outstanding is to cease.
No note once paid in gold is to reissue except in
exchange for gold, provided that if uncanceled notes
accumulate unduly in this division of issue and re
demption the Secretary may use them in the pur
chase of United States bonds for the benefit of that
division, such bonds to be held and sold wh.cn neces
sary for the replenishment of the redemption fund.
It will be seen that this plan intends to retire the
unfunded Government debt due on demand, and to as
far as possible do this without funding it in the form
of an interest-bearing debt. When the burden of
these demand obligations is lifted from the trea-^ury
there may be expected less difficulty in maintaining
the stable standard of value and there may be eve::
anticipated an increase in the coinage of silver on
Government account, it demanded by the needs of
business, because parity may be easier maintained.
WORDS TO THE WISE.
THE organization of the Board of Freeholders
recently elected, with Joseph Britton as presi
dent and J. Richard Freud as secretary, fore
shadows the adoption of the charter prepared by the
Citizens' Committee of One Hundred. Both these
gentlemen took an active interest in formulating the
instrument referred to, and it is presumed that their
influence in their new situations will be sufficient to
secure its indorsement substantially as it passed the
committee. No one will complain of this, for it i$
quite clear that in forcing that charter they are fol
lowing out the logic of the late charter campaign.
There is a strong presumption that a majority of the
people who participated in the election held on De
cember 27 favored the instrument prepared by the
Citizens' Committee. At all events that is the sense
of the result. If the 13.000 and odd persons who voted
for the successful Board of Freeholders did not fa
vor that charter a very light-view of their sanity must
be accepted.
But, notwithstanding this logic, Mr. Britton, Mr.
Freud and the Freeholders should remember that
only about one-third of the voting population of this
city went to the polls on the occasion of the late
election. Over 50,000 men either did not understand
the questions at issue or did not take sufficient inter
est in a charter to vote. All, or nearly all, of theÂ«c
will vote in November. Therefore, according to our
notion, the board should carefully consider a new
organic law, not from the standpoint of the apparent
verdict rendered amid the indifference of the holi
days, but from broad considerations of public utility.
The city is wofully in need of a new charter. His
tory shows that no instrument can be adopted which
contains either an autocratic Mayor or innovations
that engender political antagonisms. The first char
ter submitted to the people of San Francisco was
defeated because it proposed the arbitrary removal of
the cemeteries; the second because it reduced otYicial
salaries; the third and fourth because they introduced
innovations and an autocratic Mayor.
If the Board of Freeholders perstots in providing
machinery for purchasing public utilities, forfeiting
street railway franchises, enforcing civil service re
form or investing the Mayor with extraordinary
powers, it will simply sow dragons' teeth, which will
develop into armed men to defeat its charter. If
these propositions arc to be placed before the people
at all they should be submitted in the form of alter
nate sections. That method is perfectly practicable
as to all of them, except possibly that which in the
citizens' charter confers autocratic powers upon the
Mayor. But experience shows that the people do
not favor political bosses. This being granted, how
can any sensible person contend that they will adopt
a charter which provides for a boss with powers far
exceeding those enjoyed by any political potentate
we have ever known?
If the Freeholders desire to see their charter
adopted they will modify the citizens' draft so as to
avoid antagonisms. Mr. Britton has already pre
sided at the funeral of two charters. We hope he will
be wise enough to change his system this time and
give us an organic law which will stand some chance
of being adopted.
Among the Klondike miners who laugh at stories
of starvation arc those having the discretion to get
away before they became hungry. To the miners
who remain behind on short rations, or to the others
lying dead along the trails over which they tried
vainly to escape, there has been no feature of the
situation suggestive of hilarity.
Senorita Cisncros appears to be much concerned
about the starving Cubans. The very fact that she
would permit a yellow journal to drag her into no
tice again seems to point to this conclusion. How
ever, she will never be restored to public favor un
less she offer herself to the cause in the form of sand
wiches.
An American circus has captured London. We
have always contended that there was a weak spot

TnE SAX FBAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JAXfAEY 12, 189 S.
rEARS of a dry season have gone glimmering
from all parts of California. There is now
every prospect that showers will be forth
coming sufficient for the needs of all kinds of rural
industry and in all localities. It is true the danger
is not past, for we may yet lack the spring rains.
1 hat, however, is another story. For the present
everything looks satisfactory.
The notable feature of the season is the fall of snow
in the southern portion of the State. Here is an
other striking lesson for Eastern people in the va
rieties of climate in California. Snow covers the
ranges of hills and mountains that girdle San Diego,
and those that surround the blooming valleys back
of Los Angeles, while those around San Francisco
are free from any suggestion of winter.
It is gratifying to learn by the reports from the
southern counties that no damage i 9 expected to re
sult to orange or other trees from the snow that has
fallen. The people seem, in fact, to have been made
jubilant rather than depressed by the appearance of
sr.owflakes among their hills and even among their
flower gardens. It is to them truly a "beautiful
snow," and they count it among the attractions of
the season.
Dispatches from San Diego announce that Lyons
Peak, twenty miles from the coast, is covered with
snow, but the lemon and orange trees at the base of
it have not been touched by frost. At Riverside the
orange trees were white with snow when the people
rose in the morning, but no damage was found when
the snow was cleared away by a heavy rain that fol
lowed. At Yisalia snow was noted on the foothills
where it has not been known to fall for twenty years,
but here again the reports announce the cheering
news that no damage. has been done.
In every locality the fall of rain or snow has been
propitious to the hopes of the husbandmen. Both
the grain growers and the orchardists rejoice in it.
It is stated that in some localities the grain crops
were suffering from a lack of moisture. To the own
ers of these cropsthe coming of the rain and the snow
were genuine blessings. They have changed a fear
of fcsd harvests into an assurance of good ones.
It seems, in fact, that everything is working for
the good of California this year, and we can well be
lieve the report from San Diego that Eastern visit
ors to that city as they stood amid summer tlowers
and looked upon the snowy hills around them were
amazed at the striking proof before their eye? of the
truth of the stories they had never believed of the
wonderful climate of California.
THE IRON FIND STEEL INDUSTRY.
REPORTS from the East are to the effect that
while the year 1897 was <>r.e of the most event
ful ever known in the iron and steel trade ol
the United States, the present year is likely to sur
pass it in all respects. The outlook is promising for
a record breaking trade, and the chances are much
of it will be made up of export d to foreign countries.
The export 01* iron and steel was in fact one of the
notab^ features of the trade of last year. Jt is said
there is hardly a country of importance on the face
of th^ earth that did not receive more or less iron
or stÂ£el from the United States during the last twelve
monhs. In the aggregate these shipments were very
large, and according to the estimates of expert -
Pittsburg the total amount for the year was
than 500.000 tons.
However large our foreign trade may be during
the present year, it is still to tVc home market that
our producers of iron and steel look for the
greater portion of their orders. The revival of this
business in the industry during the last six months
has been something able, and the movement
â¢-.'A going forward. Jt is calculated by le
authorities in the trade that the consumption of iron
during the year in : try will be about 14,000,
000 t< >ns.
A gratifying fentitre of the reports of the industry
is the showing made of the manufacture of tinplate.
Our imports of this I for the decade ending
1892 averaged 275.000 tons per annum. This was re
duced to 119.000 tons for the year iSo/>, and was still
further reduced during 1897, besides which ex;
of tinplates are being made, which during iX<>X arc
likely to be of considerable magnitude, sufficient, at
all events, to offset any ii lports that may be ma
Rarely in any line of industry has the advantage
of protection been so strikingly shown as in the de
velopment of the manufacture of tfnplate in this
country as revealed in the statistics given. Fix years
ago we were importing urge quantities of that ma
terial, and now, notwithstanding the intervening
years of Democratic tree trade and depression, the
home manufacture has increased to such an extent
that we can expect to export tinplate Instead of im
porting it.
It is an established principle in commercial circles
that the condition oi the iron trade serves as a bar
ometer of the total trade of the country. Iron is the
basis of nearly all modern industry. It supplies the
material for the construction of almost everything
we use, from railroad, to bootjacks. When there is
a large demand for iron it is a sure thing there is a
large demand for articles made from it. The cheer
ing reports from the iron and steel industry are
therefore doubly gratifying inasmuch as they carry
with them a promise of prosperity for all.
There is a rumor that Uncle Sam has so little pow
der on hand that if all his warships were to be en-
Raped in a ten-hour battle the remaining supply
would not last more than thirty minutes. There is
no immediate occasion for distress. In the first
place the probability of such a battle is more than re
mote. Samuel's warships will not be at any one sta
tion when an engagement shall occur. Those hap
pening to be there will not stay ten liours. for they
will lick, be licked or at the bottom of the sea in
much less time.
Weyler's voice is still loud for war. Tt was in the
same state when the Cubans were making the island
too hot for him. A really brave enemy does not
fly even from such a voice as Weyler's. Why does
not the gentleman make some practical use of his
vocal equipment? The world still has room for a
good auctioneer.
The Panama swindler. Her?:, has a very slim claim
to American protection, if. indeed, he has any. How
ever, there are many people in this country perfectly
willing to waive a point and give him the best pro
tect -nil an American jail can afford.
If Russell Sage happens to sec the rumor that he
has been shorn of power he will button his $9 over
coat around him. go into Wall street and make sick
of the people who think they did the shearing.

SEASONABLE RAINS.
RAIN UP THE MOUNTAIN:
Along the serried slopes a white shape creeps,
I canyon sides and up the steeps^
A mystery of s-ilent, shrouding deeps,
Like spirit touching earth while nature sleep*
It stirs beneath the laurels, stirs within
The redwoods' circling shade, and light and thh.,
Where the brown woodthrush builds and spiders spin,
Shuts the twist manzanita's tangle in.
With swaying tops and quivering letrres adart>
Held for a time within the mint's white heart,
Like shadowy travelers ready to depart,
Tall, waving shapes of eucalyptus start.
From far below, where level spreads the plain,
Trav'ling with jeweled feet the ripening grain,
Touching the slumbering hills to life again,
Filling the earth with gladness, comes the rain.

"The thing T can't understand is what difference does it make to our quiet

The modest little grave was quite crushed and the subject .would have been

"I hope so," said the tomb, stiffly. "\\ â  to draw the line if not here?"
"Hut why should a line be drawn?" asked the grave. "Will you explain to mo

GRATIFYING RESULTS.
INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS WITH THE
NEW STOMACH REMEDY.
Not a Patent Medicine, but n Safe Cure
for All Forms of Indigestion.
The results of recent investigation
have established beyond question the
great value of the new preparation for
Indigestion and stomach troubles; it is
composed of the digestive acids, pepsin,
bismuth, Golden Seal and similar stom-
achics, prepared in the form of 20-gram
lozenges, pleasant to the taste, conven-
ient to carry when traveling, harmless ;
to the most delicate stomach and prob- i
ably the safest, most effectual cure yet
discovered for indigestion, sour stom-
ach, loss of appetite and llesh, nausea,
sick headaches, palpitation of the heart
and the many symptoms arising from
imperfect digestion of food. They cure
because they cause the food to be
promptly and thoroughly digested be-
fore it has time to sour, ferment and
poison the blood and nervous system.
Over six thousand people in the State
of Michigan alone in 1894 were cured of
stomach troubles by Stuart's Dyspep- j
sia Tablets..
Full sized packages may be found at
all druggists at 50c, or sent by mail on i
receipt of price from Stuart Co., Mar- I
shall, Mich. Send for free book on

It so happens lhat every now and
then the wisest of people around a
race track get fooled. It rained, and
tho track ai Oakland yesterday was
very sloppy. Starting in tho fourth
race was a cluster of fast ones, Includ
ing among- the list Tea Rose 11. May W
and Midlight. The Midlight people
did not fancy their mare enough to
back her and all agreed that it was a
"pipp" for Tea Rose. The coin poured
Into the books on her at the short price
of 4 to r. and 7 to 10. while the odds
ngrainst May W lengthened from 4 t<> 8
to i. At the post there was a lonp
delay. Ferguson taking as much care
of tho pour old mare Peril as though
shÂ» were a tender 1 to '.'â¢ chance in
stead of a 100 to 1 shot. The delay
proved fatal t" the chances of the fav
orite. When Bent away, notwithstand
ing tho fact that she did not like the
going. May \Y ran tho legs off the lirst
choice and beat her in a gallop. Ac
cording to the I theory, differ
ent horses like different kinds of mud.
May W struck h^rs yesterday.
But two favorites won, but tho
pped awful hard over tho
victory of this pair. Mistletoe was
played down from G X" 2, and the money
went in on Rubicon as though it was
all over, and from tho way some of tho
horses behind him were ridden, it was.
Personne in the last number on tho
programme, lik>- the good
horse that he is. experienced one of
those thrills, romping away with his
field.
The Bier Brutus-Mistletoe colt, Mis
tleton, from the stable of Burns &
WatÂ« rhouse, was played down from 6 to
2 in the betting on the opening six
furlong: sprint for three-year-olds, and
won in a big gallop from Roulette
Wheel. The winner was ridden by
Thorpe. Mainbar was an indiiY
third.
Fourteen three-year-olds lined up in
the six-furlong dash that followed.
Schreiber's gelding. Dr. W.rrks. was
barked down to 3 to 2 favoritism, but
failed to get a mark. The 20 to 1 shot
Al Koran, with Spencer up, made most
of the running, and downed Abina at
the wire with ease. Moringa, at one
stap:^ of the betting 50 to 1. finished
in the show. Colonial Dame, b< â â¢ I
choice in the betting, came fast the
last part.
Tom Griffin's Rubicon took thÂ» milÂ°
run from Double Quick, Paul < Irises
and four others in a walk. He waa a
7 to 10 choice in the betting, and waa
played to a standstill. Double Quick,
with 124 pounds in the Baddle, Becured
the place from the gray horse, Paul
Oriess. Newsgatherer ran a miserable
rare.

Splendid Work of the Alaska

Orand Receptions Given to Those
Who Managed tho Ex

C. H. Holbrook Jr. and L,. R. Hare
of this city have Just returned from a
trip to Chicago, where they went in the
Interests of the Alaska trade commit
tee. Their mission was that of advance
agents of the special San Francisco and
Klondike car that the committee sent
to the great city by the lake. As such
apents they went ahead and notified
the people that San Francisco was
sending to the East a car laden with
everything In the way of food, provi
sions and clothing that those who in-

flamed with the gold fever this news,
ito say nothing "t the Cad that Ban
: Francisco is the best outfitting i>Â«Â«rt on
the coast, caused ;>n Intense exclte
; tnent akrag the line >>( the railroad. I'.y
the time the car arrived at the various
cities large crowds were ready t
i the travelers and inspect the exhibits.
Borne little Idea <>f tht- Interest may
i lie obtained from the remarks of Mr.
Hare and Mr. Btolbrook. The latter
said: "It would lie surprising to the
folks of this city If they could have
seen the way the people along the lin"
of the railroad turned out to meet us.
At Ogden Mayor 11. if. Spencer select
ed a committee of twenty-live of the
leading citizens nnd came down to the
car, which tlvy Inspected with the
greatest >>f Interest. Th^ party had
lun'-h in the tar, and speeches were
made by every "ie- One of the most
: pleasant features of the trip was the
way we were met in Cheyenne. Qov
ernor Richards of Wyoming came on to
I that city and met thÂ» party, which es
corted us to Denver, Colo., after mak
ing us ihink that we owned the whole
of Wyoming.
"At Denver he turned as over to May
or McMurray and Oovernor Adams of
Colorado. These two officials wen
comi>anied by a committee of twenty-
Bye representative dtlsens, who did
all they r<ml'l to make "iir stay pleas
ant. Hut all this time you must re
member we were not hobnobbing with
officials exclusively, for the car was
filled wherever it stopped with those
Who contemplate poinÃ to thÂ»> Klon
dike. They came to us by the hun
dreds, and the committee, Ms Â«'is it
was, had nil it could do answering
questions about the <-ost of necessary
articles for the far north, the rates of
transportation, and a thousand and
one other questions that deeply inter
ested parties would naturally ask.
"Ex-Governor Sheakley. who was in
charpe of the car. did not have time to
get the rest he required, s .> busy was
he discussine; the merits of Han Fran
cis, 'o as an outfitting poin< for the
north. In every place he stopped he
delivered lectures, and his remarks
were listened to with the keenest of
interest. The experience in one place
was the experience in ail. Why, the
people would come for hundreds of
miles around, for we had advertise^
the mrning of the car, to see. hear and
question.
"At last the car reached Chicago and
the exhibits were installed in the bu
reau prepared, which from morning
until niÂ£rht was filled with mm who
will go to the Klondike. Seattle and
Taooma were there wi 1 1> their bureaus
three months ahead <â ? us and Port
land two months, Vancouver and Vic
toria arriving about the time we did.
They were not in it, so to j=peak. Our
bureau drew the crowds, and they were
not a little jealous of our success. <'hi
cago is the center of the East, and no
matter which way the Easterner poes
he will start from Chicago, and thore
we have made a decided hit. Of the
nine railroads leading out of that city
five are in favor of landing their pas
sengers in San Francisco."
Mr. Hare in speaking of the Jealousy
of the northern competitors for the
Alaska trade said that the arrest of ex-
Secretary Carman was the petty way
they took to throw discredit on the en
!â  rprise of the Ban Francisco mer
chants. "It was a miserable blackmail
ing job from the start." said he. "Mr.
Holbrook and I stayed with Mr. Car
man and when the case against him
came up for trial the judpe threw it
out of court and denounced the per
sons who caused Mr. Carman's arrest.
Ho dismissed the other charges at
once.
"Too much cannot be said of the
splendid reception our party received in
every place at which we stopped. The
newspapers gave us columns of write
up and not Ân e but what spoke in
praise of tho merits of the poods we
bad to display and the advantages of
Pan Fn ncisco as the outfitting port of
the Pacific. Just you wait until spriner.
This city will sco one of the greatest
rushes that tho world has witnesse i
the days of '4:Â». and the merchants
who started tho movement of adver
tising this city in this manner will reap
a golden reward.**
While at Omaha the party received a
proposition which they are strongly in
favor of having adopted. Tho Trana-
Mississippl International Exposition
will begin in June and last until No
vember. Tho Governor of Nebraska
qrged the gentlemen to do all in th.-ir
power to have the managers of the

to that city, and promised that every
consideration would be shown to the
Californlans. This State and Arizona

ANEW corporation has been
formed in the little town of
Altamont In this State, and for
want of a better name has been
called the Altamont Barbed Wire
Telephone Company. limited.
The projectors, builders and directors of
the concern nro four brothers, Jesse.
Chester, Archie and Guy Young, and the
inventive genius which has created on
Edison, a Bell and a Morse has raised
Altamont out of the ordinary and
perched her on. the topmost rung of
the progressive ladder, and to-day that
little burp is the proud possessor of the
most unique private telephone service
that can probably be found in the world.
It is, as the name of the corporation
Implies, nothing more nor less than an
ordinary barbed - wire telephone line,
which Is operated by the above-named
young men It took them just three
hours to get it In satisfactory working
order, and for simplicity of construction
and effectiveness of results stands with
out a peer In the annals of telephonic
history. This fence runs along a stretch
Of farming land for a distal! of three
miles from the home of the Youngs to
that of a relative. The top wire on the
fence is connected with the transmitter
in each house by means of copper wire,
and the transmission of sound is effected
by a magnetic battery inclosed in a
small walnut box attached to the wall
at each end of the line. By turning a
crank a bell Is rung which calls up tho
desired party, and an ear trumpet an
swers the purpose for both listening and
talking. The boys say that" weather
conditions do not seem to affect this in
genious contrivance, and one can hear
as plainly over the crude arrangement of
wires as he can over the most elaborately
constructed telephone line. It was a
Christmas present to the. parents from
their boys and was a great surprise to
the former when they witnessed its
practical illustration for the first time.
The leading spirit in the whole affair
was Archie Young, who, without any
previous mechanical or electrical knowl
edge except such as he had acquired
believed that nearly r.,000,000 people will
be at that gathering.
THE RUSH BEGINS.
Steamers Sailing for Alaska
Loaded With Freight and
Passengers.
The tone of the visitors who called
at the Alaska Trade Committee Bu
reau i!Â« taking a more positive tone
every day. It is not that of curiosity
so much as a desire to inform them
selves accurately about the require
ments of the trip to the Klondike. In
the smth.' way the proportion of por-
uh>. haTC positively decided to go
to the Yukon is Increasing, and the
records of the office show from day t i
day that the rush to the gold fields is
growing steadily larger. The demand
for all kinds of printed matter is sur
prising and not only over the counter.
but by mailed request. One caller yes
terday from San Jose who is now in
the city looking up the matter of out
fitting and transportation for a party
of fifty men from San Jose Bald that
all th.-ir plans were completed to sail
from this city in the latter part of Feb
ruary, and it only remains for the
party to lay in its supplies. Anoth.-r
party of ten from Alameda was In
specting the exhibit and is making ar
rangements to leave this city about the
first of March. There is an especially
active demand for information about
Alaaka matters from all the mining
Stat. R and Territories of the Rocky
Mountain region from Arizona and
New Mexico to Montana, and in near
ly every instance the writer says that
he is spokesman for a party ranging
from two to ten persons.
Walter J. Scammel. who went East
with the San Francisco exhibit to Chi
cago, returned to the city on Monday
evening. lie says that the Chicago of
fice is located mÂ«fst advantageously,
and is now in full running order. In
bis opinion, the office under Governor
Sheakley's charge is doing splendid
work for San Francisco, and is divert
ing much of the travel that would oth
erwise go north to this city.
The City of Puebla sailed yesterday
mcrning with every berth taken. Near
ly all of her passengers were bound for
Alaska, w that persons now in Port
land and Seattle who are looking for
transportation to Dyea and Skaguay
will find themselves crowded out. This
illustrates what the steamship compa
nies have said from the start. Passen
gers and freight from San Francisco
are booked through for T\vea and Skag-
Uay, and the unoccupied space, if thf>re
is any wh-n the vessel sails from this
port. Is wired on to the sound ports. In
this way those cities only have the seo
ond best chance to send passengers or
merchandise north.

By this achievement the social ques

this convenience can be fully appreciated
only by those who live in farmhouses
that are far away from any human hab

families to keep In closer touch with one

better preserved thereby, for any one

The largest sale of the week, and, In
fact. the largest occurring for- some
time, was that of the property on the
southwest corner of Powell and E!!is

The following interesting facts, of
moment to property holders, are taken
from the Real Estate Record, pub
lished monthly by G. 11. Umbsen &
Co.:
There were 377 loans. In the form of
mortgages or deeds of trusts made during
December. They amounted to $1,031,551. a
Rood monthly average, with the Hlbernia
Hank a long way In the lead. The re
leases were 222 In number and $890,840 in
amount. At present the tendency is to
increase Indebtedness on San Francisco
realty, as money is plentiful and borrow
ing is encouraged. Bank rates remain at
7 and i.'._. per cent, the mortgage tax of
$2 CO being included, while large private
capita] is content to obtain 6 per cent on
first-class security. The future course
of the savings banks is looked forward to
with much curiosity, as while the margin
between the interest rates and the mort
gage tax is small, the pressure of loan
money is very great with some of them.

cular, 3215 sales of city property were
made in 1897, of the total value of $12-

A Woman's Knowledge Saves Mrs. Ebbert From an Operation*
y A woman understands women as a man never can hopo
to. For this reason Mrs. Lydia E. Pinkham. of Lynn,
lass., now known all over the English-speaking world,
set to work to help her sex.
mfo After long and patient investigation, Mrs. Pinkham
Pg confirmed her own conclusions, namely: that seven-
|^ â -* eighths of the sufferings of women are due to dis-
gnfe orders of the uterine system. Reasoning on this line,
V she saw that the only preventive of early breaking
down, was a specific medicine which would act;
â¢ -, alone on the female organism.
This was why she prepared her excellent Vegetable Compound, which
has been such a boon to thousands and thousands of women. If you have
headaches chiefly at the top of the head, and are troubled by painful menstrua-
tion, dizziness, sleeplessness, backache, and that bearing-down feeling, Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will tone up your whole system. Mks. Chas.

great power of the Compound. J^zfj^jzr^l*.

CAUGHT IN AN
ELEVATOR SHAFT
L. Siegel, a Metal Worker, Hurt
in the Claus Spreckels
Building.
He Was Attempting to Fix a Defeo
tive Elevator Door When
Injured.
Ludwigr Siegel, a metal worker, In the
employ of the California Art Metal
Company, at 30 First street, had his
risrht log fractured at the thigh and
suffered numerous other bruises in an
accident in the Claus Spreckels Build
ing about 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon.
Siegel and a boy helper were sent by
the company to put up the metal di
rectory frames on the different floors
of the building. They were to put up
one on each floor on the wall opposite
the elevator entrances.
Siegel, while working on the tenth
f.<*>r, noticed that the sliding door to
the middle elevator shaft there creak
ed considerably, and, although not
there for that purpose, decided to fix it.
He swung the doors open and stepped
into the shaft, standing upon a huge
iron crossbeam. The position was a
dangerous one had the elevators not
been running, but Siege! took the risk
and went to work. He had his boy
helper call out to him whenever an ele
vator was approaching, and he would
swing himself clear of it out over the
shaft. In this way he worked upon the
creaking door for about fifteen min
utes, when, needing a tool which he had
left upon the floor above, he sent the
boy after it. and continued his work,
watching the ascending and descending
elevators himself.
In some manner he became confuser^.
and when the elevator on the far easi.
side of the building was descending he
swung over to the right to avoid it. and
was caught by the swiftly ascending
middle elevator whioh was coming up
at that moment, and was jammed be
tween the cage and the outer frame
work.
Siegel uttered a terrific shriek that
startled all the tenants on the ninth,
tenth and eleventh floors and brought
them running out of their offices.
Crowley. the young man in charge of
the middle cage, with quick presence
of mind, brought the car to a stand
still with a jerk and saved Siegel'9
life, as he would have been crushed to
death if the cage had continued up
ward.
A force of men from the engine room
of the building was Immediately sent
for, and the work of extricating Sie^el
bepan. It was found necessary to re
move the iron w<>rk from part of thrÂ«
nape in order to free him, but he was
finally released and tender hands lift
ed him into the cage, which was lower
ed to the eleventh floor and he was
carried into the offices of the General
Electric Company.
Dr. Sopor, who has offices in the
buildinp, had been previously called.
examined the unfortunate man, and
found that ho had suffered a fracture
of th^ ripht leg near th>> thish and nu
merous external bruises. After beingr
made as comfortable as possible he
was sent to th-^ German Hospital by
the owner of the building.
Siepel admits that he was at fault
in attempting to do the work, as he
was not sent there for that purpose,
and confesses he was negligent in do
ing: it while the elevator cars were run
ning-, particularly after he had sent his
boy away. He was very lucky in not
being: killed, and his escape from being
crushed to death was miraculous.
Sievjel is a young German about 27
years of age, and resides with his par
ents at 2S Tehama street.

Alex Badlam Merely Suffering
proro ao AttacK of Asthma.
The report circulated during: the past
few days that Alexander Radlam, the
well-known pioneer, was lying danger
ously ill at his residence, 1024 Franklin
street, is somewhat exaggerated. For
the past few weeks he has been indis
posed from an attack of asthma, pro
duced from a severe cold, but at no time
was ho in a dangerous condition. Some
difficulty in obtaining the necessary
sleep was about all that annoyed him.
and the members of the family.
Few, if any. of the early settlers of
this city uro better or more favorably
known "than the penial Alex. Radlam,
and as a consequence <'f this popular
ity the members of his family were
kept busy answering the door bell yes
terday. A decided improvement in his
condition was noticeable during the
day, due to the fact that he had for the
first time enjoyed a refreshing: sleep.
The cheerfulness so characteristic nf
his nature has not forsaken him in his
illness. To his attendants he has a
joke to exchange even over his sick
ness. He says he is worth a few hun
dred dead men yet. and will live to see
the beginning: of the new century. He
is as solicitous over the Golden Jubilee

who are being enlisted at the naval
rendezvous. About fifty applicants
a day are examined, but only an aver

The eloop-of-war was built at Mare
Island and is a splendid craft for a
traininir ship. She is 1900 tons dis

and 16 feet 5 inches deep. She has a
coal capacity of 162 tons and can
steam about nine knots an hour. Be

voyaging will be made under sail, so
the apprentices will have a good op

the sails, splice ropes and swab decks.
Gunnery, the handling of small arms
and genera] seamanship will also be
taught. Three instructors will accom

REST AT LAST
FOR THE DEAD
Body of Theodore Dur
rant to -Be Cremated
at Pasadena.
It Had to Be Sent Among
Strangers for Christian
Sympathy.
Quietly Removed From the Parents'
Home and Sent to Los
Angeles.
The body of Theodore Durrant, the
executed murderer of Blanche I^amont,
had to be sent among strangers to find
that sympathy and Christian respect
that is due the dead. Yesterday it was
shipped to Pasadena for cremation and
to be disposed of according to the last
request c-f the dead man. Early yes
terday morning and long before sun
rise the body was removed from the
residence of the Durrants, on Fair Oaks
street, and taken to the undertaking
parlors of Porter & White and prepar
ed for shipment.
Mr. Durrant had requested that the
greatest secrecy should be observed in
the removal of the corpse, as he did nÂ«>t
desire that it should be made the ob
ject for a curious crowd to gloat over,
and his request was respected by the
undertakers. At the undertaking par
lors the body was watched continually
by two trusted friends of the parents,
and not for an instant did they let it
escape from their observation for fear
of vandalism. The body was prepared
foT the last act that would reduce it to
the elements and placed in a zinc-lined
casket, and it was sent across the bay
on the 4 o'clock ferry, accompanied by
Mr. and Mrs. Durrant and placed on
the 5 o'clock train for Los Angeles.
There were but few people at the ferry
depot who knew whose body occupied
tl. â  solid wooden b<rx that was taken
from the undertaker's wagon and roll
ed on the boat on a baggage truck, and
there were fewer at the depot on the
mole who knew of it. There were some
curious people who crowded around the
carriage in which the sorrowing pa
rents sat in the trip across the bay,
and they caught a glimpse of them as
they stepped from the hack to the car.
Their curiosity was satisfied with that
one fleeting glimpse of the parents of
the murderer. Beyond that there was
no demonstration, and the bo-dy wart
permitted to go on its way to the final
stage of its dissolution free from the
eyes of the morbidly curious.
ANXIOUS TO SEE THE BODY.
Much Feeling Aroused in Pas
adena Over the Disposition
of Durrant's Remains.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 11.â The firm of
Kregel & Bresee, undertakers, who
have perfected the arrangements for
the cremation of Durrani's body at the
Pasadena Crematory, have received
some seventy-five requests for the pur
chase of tickets to see the body. Some
person started the report that upon
payment of 50 cents people would be
permitted to view the remains at their
establishment on South Broadway.
Thereport was utterly without founda
tion, but offers to purchase tickets im
mediately commenced to pour In until
the denial of the cruel rumor became
circulated.
The people of Pasadena are much
wrought up ov<>r the fact that Dur
rant's body is to be reduced to ashes
in that city. Some residents claim that
the city will be injured, from the fact
that it will in this connection receive
what they term unpleasant notoriety.
On the other hand there <ir'- many citi
zens who state that inasmuch as a
resting place for Durrant's body was
refused his mother and father by so
many people they are glad to have the
world know that at Pasadena there are
some people who are truly liberal and
humane. However, the division of
sentiment in that community is
marked and some warm discussions
have already occurred over the matter
between citizens.
All the arrangements have been
completed. The fires in th*> crematory
have been lighted, and when the body
arrives there will be no delay.
THE CREMATORY READY.
The Remains of the Murderer
to Be Disposed of To- Day.
PASADENA, Jan. 11.â To-night ar
rangements have been completed with
Reynolds and Van Nuys, undertakers,
through Kregelo & Bi-Â«-*e of Los An
geles and the Durrants, to cremate
here the remains of Thedore Durrant
gome time to-morrow afternoon. Word
was received this morning that the
remains will leave San Francisco to
night, arriving in Los Angeles at 1:30
p. m. to-morrow. The hour of crema
tion haa not been determined upon and
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1898.
it is probable that the remains will not
pass through Pasadena at all, but will
be conveyed direct from the Aepot to
Mountain View Crematory north of the
Pasadena city limits.
In an Interview this morning with
Mr. Reynolds, of the firm of Reynolds
& Van Nuys. he said: "Our opinion
is from one standpoint that it is purely
a business proposition, and as such we
accept it. In the second place the re
mains of Durrant are no more nor less
than any other subject. There if^io
superstition in our minds whatever in
regard to the matter. We do not con
sider that in doing this that we are
in any way upholding crime, but are
only serving Durrant's parents in the
cremation of their son as we would any
one under any other circumstances,
charging the regular price for crema
tion. Theodore Durrant paid the pen
alty and met every requirement of the
law for thÂ« crime with which he was
charged. We understand it to be the
request Of his parents and those hav
ing charge of the disposition of the
body that he be cremated. We see no
reason why we should be more blam
able for the carrying out of this re
quest than any railroad or transporta
tion company would be for the trans
portation of the body. Devoid of senti
ment and a purely business transac
tion, we have decided to comply with
the request of his parents, who should
not be tortured longer for the sins of
their son."
It is not anticipated that the crema
tion of Durrant will bo attended with
any exhibition of morbid curiosity and
everything will be done with as little
publicity as possible.
THE RUSH WILL
BE VERY GREAT
Thousands Are Going to Alaska
by the Way of San
Francisco.
Observations of C. M. Jenkins, Who
Made a Trip East Last
Month.
C M. Jenkins, who went Bast with
the Alaska trade committee's special
car to Chicago and returned Sunday
evening. Pays that people >>n th>' Coast
have no conception of the size <<f th>
crowds which will go to Alaska dur
ing the present season. The estimates
! of 10"Â»,'ifÂ»D, which have been published
from time to time, be considers alto
gether too low, after having made â 
trip through twelve States and Terri
tories. Mr. Jenkins left the Fran
clsos party on its Eastward Journey at
Salt Lake <"ity and made a personal
trip through a number of the mining
towns <>f Colorado. At aJi these points
he found that the entire community
was taking the keenest interest in ev
erything that pertains to the gold tields
of Alaska.
Although the business men, naturally
in defense of their own interests, were
given to discourage any emigration to
the Klondike, among the practical
working miners, however, there are
hundreds of mÂ»Ti who have been sav
ing their wages and turning what lit
tle property they have into cash in
anticipation of making the trip to Alas
ka us soon as possible. Many of them
expressed their preference for San
Francisco as a point of departure and
a largp quantity of literature was dis
tributed in the principal mining towns
of the State.
THE FREEHOLDERS.
Discussing Plans for future
Actionâ The New Ma"
Comrr>ittee.
The rooms of the freeholders were
busy yesterday, for nearly every one
of the freeholders was donwn there at
some time to discuss the future plans
of the body which must draft the new
law of the city.
Chairman Joseph Britton was there
working on his committees. At the
meeting to-night they will be an
nounced, and there is a great deal of
labor in apportioning the business of
the board. The committee on new
quarters will also report to-night, but
it is not at all certain that their report
will be in favor of moving to another
place. The present rooms are handy
and are big enough to accommodate
any crowd that may gather unless
something special is being done. It
was the experience of the Charter
Committee of One Hundred that the
public does not care to listen to dry de
, bates, and so the attendance there was
very meager toward the close. That
is the view of several of the freehold
ers.
The standing of the charter drafted
by the Committee of One Hundred be
fore the freeholdrs has given rise to
much speculation, but it is certain that
it will be used only as an advisory in
strument and that many of the pet
provisions of the committee will not
be passed by the official body.

George Knowlton, better known as

not the structure can be finished by

representatives of the property-owners
i>n Kearny street took an active part.
Attorney Shadburne asked that the
committee order the architect to take

the contract. He thought that unless
some definite action was taken the
building would not \>- completed for a

done t<> Kearny street property.
O. F. yon Kn> in representing a
larpo amount of property along Kearny

in the completion of the hall, and asked

A member of the firm nf Rateman &

under existing cireumstanres to go
ahead more rapidly. n<Â» stated that in
order to get the terra cotta work done
his firm had been compelled to estab

pared to turn out the work at short
According to the contract, he said,
there was only one firm on the Pacific
Coast that could turn out the steel work,
and the inability of this firm to do the
work on time had caused much delay.
Chairman Sheehan of th*> committee
took a hand in the discussion and
stated that he as well as other
members of the committee had tried to
advance the work as rapidly as possi

hands of the architect to report at a

GEORGE TAUCHI
HELD FOR MURDER
The Charge Against Y. Nishi
gima of Being an Acces
sory Is Dismissed.
Judge Low and His Prosecuting At
torney Have an Argument ad to
Who Runs the Court.
George Tauchi, the Japanese, was
yesterday held to answer before the
Superior Court by Judge Low on the
charge of murdering Mary Castillo,
without bail.
The defendant's attorney, Archie
I Campbell, reserved his defense for the
higher court.
The case was not finished without a
; wordy set-to between the Judge and
1 Prosecuting Attorney Reynolds. There
| was a charge against Y. Nishigima, the
occupant of the house where Tauchi
had been concealed, of being an acces
â Ol7 to the crime, and the Judge sug
i gested that the charge be dismissed as
Xishigima's evidence might be of value
to the prosecution.
Reynolds said that he was opposed
to the dismissal, as they had sumcieut
i evidence without Nishigimas. He an
nounced that the case for the prosecu-
I tion was closed. This nettled the Judge
' and he retorted sharply that he was the
; committing magistrate and could do as
he liked.
Detective Gibson sought to pour oil
upon the troubled waters by consent-
Ing to the charge bring withdrawn, but
it had the contrary effect upon Rey
nolds, who disputed the Judges author
ity to dismiss the case. The Judge end
ed the matter by dismissing the case,
and Nishtgima was called as a witness
for the prosecution, bvit he denied that
he- knew that Tauchi was concealed in
the house or anything about the case.
Reynolds refused to examine the wit
ness and the Judge had to do it.
The Judge was annoyed at the wit
ness refusing to give any information,
and Detective Gibson was instructed
to take his case before the Grand Jury,
but they declined to consider it, and
i the wily Japanese comes out on top.

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of e<jual
Eir pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal

barometic pressure and is usually accompanied
with fair weather; "low" rt:ers to low pres-
Fure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear ":i the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
alonp the coast, and the isobars extend north

but when tho "low" is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of

fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 11.â London operators in
American securities had apparently recovered
6ome of their confidence In the future of values
In this country to-day after the alarm they
had manifested yesterday over our political fu
ture. Some sharp Rains were recorded for
Americans on the London exchange before the
opening hour. In fact, the London bullishness
outran the local opening and New York prices
res-ponded fully to the rise In London. Thâ¬
market all day -was one difficult of analysis
â¢on account of its unevenness. There were
points of notable strength and others of mark
ed weakness In the list and neither was alto
gether effective in giving tone to the market
Sugar was the special point of weakness, and
the large volume of transactions in It gave
Its weatcness an Influence on the list The
pangers were heavy in the early deal
ings, though â  subsequent recovery brought
their prices a fraction above yesterday's close
The craters were centers of depression on ac
count of the condition of trade and the un
seasonable mildness of the weather On thÂ»
other hand there was very striking activity and
strength in the Northern Pacific stocks and
T-nion Pacific. This strength seemed to ex
tend to connecting railroads in the West and
Northwest. Thus not only Northern I'nd'fl,'
and Union Pacific rose from >> to 2 points but
Denver & Rio Grande preferred. Uniâ¢ Pacific
Denver & Gulf. Oregon Navigation, Oregon
.Short Line and Oregon Improvement shows
gains ranging from %, points in Oregon Xavi
gation. These stocks were strong on antici
pation of increased trafficking for Klondike
They were helped also by the decision of the
Interstate Commerce Commission to continue
the suspension of the long and short ' haul
clause on tariff in competition with Canadian
railroads. The dealings in the stocks of these
transcontinental lines were very heavy and
transfers of blocks of several thousand shares
were quite frequent all day.
Money closed slightly easier, but most of the
business of the day was done at I per cent
In the time money market, however rates were
2% Per cent for sixty days and from 3 to 3V
per cent lor three to seven months. There was
an active demand for commercial paper but
the supply was good. Among the notable
movements of the day were the decline of U.
in Baltimore & Ohio, and a rise of 2 points
in the common and preferred stock of the Sus
qu*hanna & Western.
The bond market was very active and the
high grade Issues all showed high prices. There
were several transactions of par value of $100 -
000. It was very well distributed, but the
Atchison. Union Pacific, Texas & Pacific and
â Union Pacific. Denver & Gulf issues led in
point of activity. Total sales, $3,500,000 United

TUB LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 11. -The Evening Posts
financial â¢ cablegram says: The stock market
here shows only a moderate account. Contan
goes were easier because Of the plentiful sup
ply of money, those of |p\mericans being 4&5
per cent. ;
The activity In stocks . to-day was centered
in Grand Trunks. Americans and Argentines.
All of these were good, but the first two closed
under the best. China stocks were strong.
Negotiations for the new China loan are pro
ceed Inc favorably. Mines were. good. The
possibility of a new financial policy by the In
dian Government, announced in these dis- i
patches yesterday, in a chief topic of conver- i
sation, although nothing has yet been set
1 tied or announced. Meanwhile the money
i stringency in India increases, resulting in i a
further rise in the bank rates th.-re to-day.
Gold may leave here to-morrow for Egypt and
' Argentina. Some was sent to-day from
France.
I have reason to believe that the Indian
I currency measure framed on the lines hither
to indicated will be submitted to the council
j In India on Friday.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. .Tan. There were supporting
; orders .In Wheat at the opening and also
j enough buying of short Wheat at the same
. time to make firmness quickly follow a weak
! opening. First trades In May were at from 90* i
: QSOUc. compared with SO^c yesterday. Beyond
a drain at Liverpool, no reason was apparent
for the opening decline. Pome weakness was
developed on yesterday's curb and anticipation
of a moderate, raid to-day probably had Its In
fluence at the start. Prices slowly Improved
during the next hour, but the height of Its
forenoon bulge was 90% c. â¢ The only notable
feature of that %c rise from the lowest point
at- the opening was dullness and the small ex
tent of i business that accompanied ' it. One
rather heavy local operator bought 1 about 200 -

day. * : ? ' :â¢","-â  â  â , â â â¢ v â¢â¢â¢ ..

decline at Liverpool, from 10 to 15 centimes
decline in Flour and 4 to 5 centimes In Wheat
at Paris, with Antwerp unchanged.
â¢During the afternoon the market developed
I marked strength. The LHter party, although
I selling small, certainly bought a good deal
more than they dispose,] of. A good ninny of
I the. smaller shorts covered very freely toward
! the close and the market responded quickly to
the buying. May advancing; to 91VÂ»c and was
bringing 91e at the close.
Corn was firm, although the market was very
dull. May closed *Â£c higher. . :

EDUCATOR
Miss Johnson to Be the
Pioneer of the Beet
Colony.
Every Prospect Points to the
Success of the New
Venture.
Sergeant Major Brown Returns to
OakUmd Bringing Good
Reports.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Jan. 11.
Miss Mary Johnson, one of the most
ardent workers in the Salvation Army,
and formerly a schoolteacher, will be
the first school ma'am in the new colo
ny at Romie, near Soledad.
The young lady has received her or
ders to leave the Oakland corps and
take charge of tho young colonists, the
number of which Is rapidly growing as
the territory becomes more settled.
She will le'ive Oakland to-morrow to
enter upon her new duties.
"My school will not be very large at
present." she said, "but when all the
colonists are on the ground there will
be quite a large class, for nearly all
the colonists are people of family, as
It was mostly for such people that the
rolony was formed. â¢ I am very much
pleased that I have been selected for
this work and can enter into it with all
my heart and soul."
Sergeant-Major Brown of the Oak
land corps, who is in charge of the
building operations at the colony, is in
Oakland for a couple of days and says
that it is almost impossible that the
scheme should fail. "There are al
ready over thirty cottages built," he
said, "'and more are going up as fast
n.s possible. When the first contin
gent came down last week it took a
few days to get things into shape, es
pecially in the cooking department,
but already they are at work and pros
pects are very bright. The soil is the
finest that could be found in the
whole State. Although there has
been no rain for nearly a year it is
comparatively easy to plow, and af
ter the plow has passed over the
ground you cannot find a piece of
earth larger than your fist. There is
water in abundance, and last week we
punk a well thirteen feet and got seven
feet of water.
"Mr. Romle, after whom the settle
ment was named, is one of the most
whole-hearted men I ever met. Noth
ing seems too generous for him to un
dertake, and all he asks in* return is
that the success of the affair will be
as great as we anticipate. The irri
gation plant which he is putting up for
our use is almost in position, and al
ready the large tract of land has a
very businesslike appearance. With
the large Spreckels factory close by.
guaranteeing a good market for all
the beets that can be grown, we have
reason to believe that this scheme will
be a complete success."
Sergeat-Major Brown will return to
th a colony with its new schooteacher
to- marrow.
TOURNAMENT FOR
WHIST PLAYERS
Fourth Annual Convention of
the Pacific Coast Asso
ciation.
The Chief Interest Will Be Centered \
in the Bideout Trophy-
Contest.
A matter of considerable moment to
whist devotees throughout the country
â¢will be the fourth annual convention
( of the Pacific Coast "Whist Association,
-which will be held next Friday and Sat
urday in the rooms of the San Fran
cisco Whist Club, 326 Post street. The
association was organized in this city
in 1894, under the patronage of the
American Whist League, a national in
stitution, which has no- less than four
teen associations under its guidance.
The convention will be entirely in the
interest of "duplicate" whist, the play
ing of which has rapidly spread among
all lovers of that scientific game.
The convention will be divided into
two parts. The first will be the meet
ing of the delegates to transact neces
. sary business and the election of offi
cers to serve for the ensuing year. The
committee on nominations will be ap- !
pointed by President P. J. Tormey at
Friday's meeting, and the balloting will
take place on Saturday morning. A
cordial invitation is extended to all
whist players, attached or unattached,
to be present at the above meetings.
The second, and by no means the
least important part of the pro-gramme,
contemplates five general contests I
which will be decided in the rooms of
the Trist Duplicate Whist Club, 711 :
Jones street, on Friday and Saturday.
The contests are: First, the Rideout
trophy contest between teams of four
representing association clubs; second,
the progressive match for pairs; third,
progressive match for fours; fourth, a
match for club pairs; fifth, progressive
straight whist. The Rideout . trophy
contest is the principal event and one
which has always engendered a great
â  deal of friendly rivalry. This trophy,
presented for competition by N. D. j
Rideout of Marysville, is a solid sliver
cup, suitably Inscribed, and aside from !
its intrinsic value, its possession is
something to be proud of, as it is em- |
blematic of victories won in hard- i
fought whist battles. It is now held by
the San Francisco Club, which wrested i
it from the Trist Club at last year's '
tournament. Prizes will also b^ award
ed to the winners in every match.
The competing clubs are: The Sacra

to Robert Dickson, who leaves on Mon
day to make his home in New York.
The table, a round one, was artistic

STATE BOARD OF
TRADE ACTIVE
Preparations for the Big Paris
International Expo
sition.
The Director- General Should Ec
a Citizen of the Pacific
Coast.
At the regular meeting of the Cali
fornia State Board of Trade yesterday
a resolution was passed whlcA will be
placed in the form of a memorial to
be forwarded to the Pacific Coast Rep
resentatives in Congress, urging them
to dn all in their power to have the
director-general representing the Unit
ed States to the Paris Exposition ap
pointed from this Siate
making every effort to have one of the
best exhibits that will be landed in
Paris for the big international exposi
tion sent from California. At the
Hamburg Exposition, with limited
means, the exhibit was rated as the
finest, and the benefits derived from
being represented there are already
manifest by an increased demand for
the products of the State. It is the
wish to entirely eclipse the Hamburg
display at the Paris Fair, and in order
to get a showing the local board de
sires to have the people's representa
tive chosen from this coastâ or State,
if possible.
Several weeks ago the Department
of State at Washington issued what
was known as Bulletin No. 6, and the
representative of one of the daily pa
pers declared that the document gave
California a "black eye" by stating
that this State produced but little in
the way of fruits, etc. The bulletin in
question was examined yesterday with
care, and found to be very fair, the
statistics showing that the production
of fruits, nuts, etc.. of California is the
greatest In the Union. A few unim
portant errors were found, and the
secretary was instructed to communi
cate with the Secretary of Agriculture
and explain the mistakes made by the
papers in not digesting the report be
fore publishing the statements.
E. W. Maslin delivered an interesting
address on the subject of the rainfalls
of the State. In his remarks he said:
In forty-eight seasons th<>rp ba**Â« fiÂ»*'Â«Â»i
960.81 inches of rain, an average for each
season of 20.01 inches. The total precipi
tation before January 1 of the seasons
was 480.15 inches, an average of Iv
inches. This season's fall before the Ist
of January was below the average, being
only 4.07 inches. This is no cause for
alarm. A glance at the table shows that
there have been thirteen seasons in
which sufficient rain fell to mature crops,
but In which less than 4.10 inches of rain
fell before the Ist of January of the
season.
/ once thought that I discovered the
law of storms in the State. In ISSO I be
gan to pay attention to meteorology, as
I was about to engage in horticulture. In
ISSO-51 the season's rainfall was 4.71.
Counting therefrom, the sixth seasonâ
1556-57 â brought 10.56 inches. The seventh
season thereafter â 1863-64â brought 7.57
inches. The next seventh eeason â 1870-71
brought 8.47 inches. The next sixth
eeason â 1876-77 â brought 8.96 inches. In
the seventh season thereafterâ lÃS3-S4 â
before January 1, ISB4. there only fell 2.92
inches. About this time I received some
data from General Rklwell which showed
that the season of 1*43-44 was an extreme
ly dry season. Counting from that period,
there were seven seasons to the next dry
season â ISSO-51. I concluded that every
sixth or seventh season there would be
a drought. I prophesied. I wrote for the
Placer papers, and warned my fellow
fruit-growers not to put out any trees
and vines. Alas for my reputation!
There fell that season 24. 7^ inches of rain,
distributed as follows: Before January
1, ISB4, 2.92 Inches: January. 3.43 inches;
February, 4.46; March, 8.14; April. 4.32;
May, 0.6; June, 1.45 inches. Still I was
not willing to surrender. I conceived
that the law might be a dry spell every
thirteen years or thereabout. According
ly, when before January, 1888, which was
of the eleventh season after 1576-77. there
fell only 2.56 inches of rain I felt sure of
my law. It is true that only 11.50 inches
fell, but the precipitation was distributed
thus: January. 4.81 inches; February,
0.57; March. 3.04; April, 0.10; May. 0.40:
June, 0.8. Notwithstanding the small
amount of rain, the fruit crop of ISSS
was a very fair one.
The point I desire to make is that we
have not discovered the law of defici
ency, and that because only 4.07 inches of
rain have fallen before January 1 of this
season there is necessarily no cause for
alarm, seeing we have had thirteen sea
sons before in which less rain fell before
January 1. and in each of these- seasons
there were good crops. : In fact, we had
only four bad seasons â ISSO-51,, 1863-04. IS7O
71, "1876-77â in forty-eight years, and. ex
cept 1850-51. something was raised In
each season.

TITE SAX TEAXCTSCO CALL, WEDNESDAY,
A STUDENT
UNDER ARREST
Said to Have Picked a
Pocket on the
Ferry.
Plight of Young Nevus, Who
Js the Son of a Wealthy
Doctor.
A Belief That He Has Be-ti Made the
Victim of a Very Grave
Mistake.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Jan. 11.
Thomas Nevus, a dental student of
good reputation, and the son of a
wealthy San Jose doctor, has been In a
cell at the City Prison since last night
on suspicion of being a pickpocket and
of having attempted to steal a watch
from a passenger on the ferry.
There is no charge made against him
yet, and he is on the small book. Those
who have looked into the matter de
clare that one of those fearful blunders
have been made that are not the fault
of the police, and yet work great hard
ship on the "lctim.
Nevus is a student at the San Fran
cisco Dental College, and during his
studies he lives with his brother-in
law and sister. Assemblyman C. G.
Dodge and wife of East Oakland. He
is a very industrious, steady young
man with a record, so it is said, as
straight ps an arrow. 3 ist night he
came across the bay as usual and sat
next to a passenger who had a gold
watch. When crossing the apron there
was a great rush and Jam and the
passenger mis ->d his watch. It had
fallen on the deck and was immediate
ly picked ap by a Portuguese, who re
turned it to its owner. The man who
found it also declared that he had seen
Nevus snatch it from its owner. As
all the parties were strangers to each
other and the weight of evidence was
against Nevus. Deputy Sheriff Kellner,
who is employed by the railroad com
pany, arrested the student and he was
sent to the City Prison.
The owner of the watch proceeded to
Port Costa, and the police officials say
that he will be down to-morrow to
swear out a charge against Nevus.
Assemblyman Dodge said to-night
that he hail Inquired into the case and
believes the charge to be perfectly
groundless. He says young Nevus'
father, who is well off. pays his son's
expenses and supplies him with spend
ing money, and it is an absurdity to
suppose that the young man had at
tempted to steal a watch. "'When he
was charged by the Portuguese with
stealing." snid Mr. Dodge. "Nevus did
not understand what It was all about
and wanted to thrash the fellow f<>r
calling him a thief, but when he paw
the officer he decided to let the matter
take its course."
Detective Denny Holland said to
night that he believes the charge to ho
groundless. 4> t am of the opinion." be
sf.id. "that the button of somebody's
coat caught the watch guard and
yanked out the watch, breaking the
gua'-d at the same time. Such instances
are very common In a crowd."
As soon as a charge is sworn to Mr.
Nevus will be taken out on bond, which
can easily be obtained for any amount.
TERRORIZED
BARKEEPERS
A Colored Man With a Rock
Who Is Chasing After
Coin.
; Three Attacks Have Been Made, One
of Them Proving Nearly
Fatal.
Tlie salaries of night bar-tenders will
\Â»ii>out doubt soon be raised, as th-rf>
is a dark terror strolling around which
makes it rather disagreeable for the
dispensers of liquid refreshments dur
ing the lonesome hours of the night.
Hut a few days ago a colored man
walked into the Palm saloon on Polk
street, and after calling for a beer
waited his chance to rob the estab
lishment. It was nearly closing-up
time and the bar-tender had placed a
small amount of coin on the bar aft'-r
serving the called-for drink. As the
colored man was drinking with the
glass in his left hand th^> bar-tender
stooped down and the man struck him
; a crushing blow on tho head with a
large stone which he had held in hla
right hand. Ho then took the coin and
departed. The bar-tender nearly died
fmm th<- effects of the blow.
Last Wednesday night presumably
the same man went into Clawson's sa
loon on Geary and Taylor streets and
called for a glass of beer. As the beer
was being drawn, he threw a stone,
which when weighed tipped the scales
! at over a pound, with crushing force,
just missing the head of his intended
victim. The stone struck the marble
on the bar and after breaking off thÂ«*
corner, jumped through a valuable
â  glfiss window.
As soon as the murderous negro had
seen that he had missed his mark, he
' ran out of the saloon closely followed
by the bar-kfÂ»eper. Thf* case was re
â¢ ported to the police and a detectivp has
! been detailed on the case. Saturday
j night the same man. from descriptions
J given to the police, attempted to kill
I tho night man in a saloon on Third
! street.
SUFFERED FOR FOOD.
Joseph Hun)bar, Although Insane,
Placed in a Ceil in the City
Prison.
Joseph Humbar was arrested Monday
evening and booked at the City Prison
as drunk. Early in the morning he
was conveyed to the Receiving Hos
pital as insane.
Emaciated and helpless, he was
placed in a padded cell awaiting the
pleasure of the Insane Commissioners.
Late in the afternoon he was given
food, and the manner in which he de
voured it proved that the arresting of
ficer was no judge of insanity nor
star\ ation.
A more pitiful case was perhaps
never placed before Commissioner .ir
Judge. No ray of light penetrated his
brain and in consequence he was left
to the mercies of his nurses, police and
surgeons, but still he suffered on.
During the night of his arrest he was
left In a cold, gloomy cell, to be
awakened in the morning and trans
ferred to even less comfortable quar
ters. He appeared so emaciated that it
was thought that the hand of death
rested upon him. yet no particular at
tention was paid him.
When he was at last ffiven some light
food he ate with a relish that cannot
be described, but still he seemed to
wish for more. But now, after unnec
essary suffering, he rests at peace in
Agnews Asylum, where he was sent by
the Insane Commissioners yesterday
afternoon.
COURIERS OF COMMERCE.
The California Commercial Trav
elers' Aesociatior) Erjtertains
a Large Audierjce.
The "drummers" have had an ar
tistic inning.
It was a large and enthusiastic
crowd which assembled at Native
Sons' Hali on Monday to attend the en
tertainment given by the California
Commercial Travelers' Association.
The main floor was crowded and the
gallery well filled, and it is safe to say
that no one In the audience had any
adverse criticism to pass upon the per
formance. It was generally conceded
to be "a great show," one entirely
worthy of the reputation of the knights
of the grip as a whole in the matter
of entertaining and amusing.
After a highly felicitous address by
Mertin C. Allen, who paid a glowing
tribute to the omnipresent "drummer,"
the following programme was rendered
admirably as to every feature: Vocal
solo, T. J. Byrne; recitation, W. W.
Bracket; banjo solo, Professor E. I*
Appleby; whistling solo. Miss Cord
Wetjen; skirt dance. Miss Mattie Luce;
graphophone, Mr. Richardson; zither
solo, Joseph Regensberger; impersona
tion of Lew Dockstadter. Martin Krel
lng; recitation, Miss E. F. Shade; col
ored quartet; stereoptlcon views of
Klondike.
The performers -wer* all received
with the heartiest enthusiasm, some of
them being recalled three or four
times.
On the conclusion of the programme
the main floor was cleared for terpsi
chorean revelry, which was indulged
in until a late hour.
NEW AIR BRAKE
FOR TROLLEYS
Railroad Men Believe It an
Inr-^vement on the Hand
Brake.
No Trocr*-rÂ« .Experienced in ;-â¢<- ping
on the Steep Grade on Hjurrlaon
Street.
The Martin air brake \ras tested on
Monday afternoon on a car of the San
Francisco and San Mateo Klectrlc Rail
way Company, in the presence of a
number of railroad officials from other
lines. The brake acted satisfactorily,
and if it will do as good work when the
track Is wet und slippery, the railroad
men feol that it will prove a great im
provement over the present style of
hand brake. It has one advantage over
the other brakes, and that Is that It
can be applied by a child, as the lever
moves easily and without any waste of
strength in setting it.
One of th>> can "f the Pan Francisco
and San Mateo line was fitted up with
the brak^ last week and an Invitation
was extended t>> the officials of the sev
eral street car tinea to be present Mon
day afternoon at the first public
test. The car left the corner of Market
and Steuart streets about 2:30 o'clock
and the first test of the brake was
made while going down the steep in
cline on Harrison street, from Second
to Third street. The car started down
the grade at the usual rate of speed
and had gone about thirty feet when
Martin called, to the nv>ti>rman to stop.
The air brake was thrown on, the
wheels locked and the car brought to a
standstill within a few foot. Another
start was made and whÂ«Â»n the car had
gained a good rate of speed, the motor
man threw on the brake, bringing up
within a few feet. Three tests were
made on the grade and the car was
readily and easily stopped. A trip was
; made out to the power bouse at Sunny
side and the brake was tested on level
ground as well as on grades. j n every
case the car came to a standstill with
: out any jarring or shaking.
The air brake worfca independent of
the hand brake and wiU also work in
conjunction with a track brake. The
reservoir is stored undt-r the seats of
the car and is filled by an automatic
pump. The governor can be set so as
to run op to 100 pounds, but twenty
five to thirty-five pounds is all that is
necessary on any of th>> grades in this
city. The governor WU s.-t at thirty
five pound* yesterday, and when that
pressure was reached it opened a valve
and rt-duced the prt-ssure ten points.
Then the valve dosed and when the
gauge apain indicated thirty-five
pounds it opened to reduce the pres
sure afl before. In this way the pres
sure rarped from twenty-live to thirty
five pounds during the whole trip.
Martin and Engineer HÂ« nderpon test
ed the brake on Saturday, wh^n the
trruk was wet and slippery. Martin
says that while running at a twelve
mile rate of speed the car was brought
to a standstill in thre~ seconds, while
it took fifteen and one-half seconds to
stop with the old hand brake.
AN ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.
Frank. GrichTak.cn to the City and
County Hospital Probably
Fatally Wounded.
The Seventeenth-street Police Sta
tion was notified last evening: that
Frank Grich, living with his parents at
212 Collingwood street, had attempted
to take his own life last evening: by
shooting himself in the head. He en
tered the drugstore of George Swan
early in the evening and after convers
ing for a few moments, drew out a re
volver and fired a shot into his brain.
It is reported that Grich. who is a
roof and cornice maker by trade, work
ing for J. Former at Eighth and Market
streets, is despondent over a young
lady with whom he has gone for sev
eral months, and within the past few
days he has been left to himself, for a
reason known only to the young lady,
Whose name he refuses to divulge.
After the shot had been fired he was
hurriedly taken to the City and County
Hospital, where it was . discovered by
Dr. Hoffmann that he had sustained a
severe bullet wound in the top of the
head on the left side.
The physicians are of the opinion
that the shot was fired because of jeal
ousy, but are positive that the victim
will recover.
The parents are prostrated over the
affair.

MORE TROUBLE
FOR CHINESE
Government Action Is to
Be Taken Against the
Slave-Dealers.
Those Who Have Had Immu
nity Will Feel the Law's
Clutches.
Close Investigations *to Be Made Into
the Methods Used by Im- .
porters.
The action of Collector Jackson In
sending back to China Chow Ah Yet,
! Wong Toy Chin and Lee Kune How.
'. the three girls whom the Slave-dealers'
Association attempted to land under
the guise of being Native Daughters,
carried consternation to the headquar
ters of those who have been violating
the Immigration laws. With the cessa
tion of the crusade against the Chinese
slave-dealers, there came a feeling of
immunity, which caused the importers
to send word to China that the coast
was now clear, and the result was that
I extensive preparations were made to
send over a.^ many girls as possible be
fore the next agitation.
The steamer Peru, which will arrive
here next Saturday, is said to have a
large number of girls aboard whom the
dealers expect to get through the
Custom-house, but since the Collector
is getting versed in the ways of the
Mongolians, it is probable that
there will be more disappointment for
the importers. The Collector is making
closer investigation into the various
casrs that are presented for his con
sideration, and it is rumored around
the Chinese bureau that there are cer
tain surprises in store for those who
have been so openly violating the law.
as well as for several white men who
have aided and abetted the slave-deal
ers in their evasions of the law.
There are still several Chinese women
Bn>l girls detained on the steamers, and
their cases will receive the closest at
tention from the bureau, and the Chin
ese will find that there will not be
such an easy time in the future as in
the past. The agitation which was car
ried on several months ago had the ef
fect of stirring up the department in
Washington to the necessity of doing
something to put a stop to the illegal
immigration, and it is understood that
evidence is being gathered by special
agents whtea will result in the prosecu
tion of several who have committed
perjury in connection with the cases
which have been tried during the past
year.
Some of these cases were so flagrant
that wonder was expressed at the time
that the matter was not presented to
the Federal Grand Jury, but it is ex
plained that the delay was for the pur
pose of getting such testimony as
would Insure conviction, not only of the
most notorious, but also several promi
nent Chinese merchants who have in
terested themselves in the matter and
have sworn falsely regarding the na
tivity of the girls who were proved to
have been born in China.
The secret service of the Treasury
Department has been at work on the
cases for several months, and has so
far completed its investigations as to
warrant It In making its report, which
will be for\va v rded to Washington with
in a week. What will then be done re
mains for the decision of the cfflcials
there, but it is openly surmised about
the Federal building that some start
DANIEL T. COLF, NEW COINER OF THE MINT.
Daniel T. Cole, ex-Harbor Commissioner, has been nominated by Presi
dent McXinley for Coiner of the Mint at San Francisco. The appointment
of Mr. Cole to the posl lon of Joiner of the Mint is one that gfives entire
satisfaction to the Republican party of the State.
The lon.r career of Mr. Cole as a Republican dates back to the first time
he was eligible to vote, and during the intervening: years he was to be
found among the leaders of the party in this State, although contenting
himself with the quiet and retired life of a resident of Sierra County, where
he was honored with the position of a Supervisor for ten years. In 189 a Gov
ernor Markham rewarded his devotion to his party by appointing him
Harbor Commissioner in thl3 city, a position he filled with honor to the
State and credit to himself and the party he represented.
Daniel T. Cole was born in the State of Vermont, and when at the age
of twenty years he came to California and settled in Sierra County, where
he engaged in logging, and like the sainted Lincoln hewed rails and built
fences. In after years he engaged in equipping stages by which towns and
settlements in that county could be reached with convenience and dispatefc.
This pursuit he followed for forty-five years, and in his modest and un
pretentious way became recgnized as a man of sterling character, hon
ored and respected by all who knew him. In his new position as Coiner
of the Mint he brings all of those noble qualities with him into his new
office.
In speaking of his appointment Tirey I* Ford, the well-known attor
ney who was associated with Mr. Cole while a Harbor Commissioner as
the attorney of the Harbor Commissioners, had this to say: "I know of no
better man than Dan T. Cole. He is broad-minded and a thorough practi
cal man of business. During his term as a Harbor Commissioner he in
tnduced into the management of the water front a thorough system of
doing business, a thing heretofore almost unknown. He has the rare char
acteristics of being true to his friends whether on top or at the bottom;
his devotion to them never ceases.
"Senator Perkins is to be congratulated and President McKinley
thanked for the appointment of Danie T. Cole as Coiner of the Mint."
ling developments will be made within
a very short time.

Fred Yates Bound for trje Orient.
Success in Selling Pictures.
Fred Yates sailed for the Orient on the
6teamship China a few days since. He
entertains the hope of getting an op
portunity to paint a portrait of the
Mikado of Japan. He will tarry in
Japan and China for some time and
then continue his journey to London,
K<inK around the world from east to
west. From a business and artistic
point of view. Mr. Yates' long sojourn
in San Francisco was very gratifying.
While here he painted portraits of
many leading citizens and obtained
good prices for his work.
Among the artists who have been
very successful in selling pictures this
season are Charles Rollo Peters, Chris
Jorgensen and Charles Robinson. Jor
gensen leads the list with a sale of
twelve paintlng3.
Joseph D. Strong in the line of por

A WANDERER
BRINGS RAIN
Vagrant Storm Center
Carries Relief to
Farmers.
It Will Be Followed by Another
Storm To- Day or To-
Morrow.
Ship Captains Preparing for Trouble
With ix Southeaster and a
Heavy Bar.
A vagrant "low." a wandering storm
center playing around in the middle
latitudes, came down the coast yes
terday, and following in its track
came the welcome rain, for which far
mer, dairyman and cattle ranger have
been watching so long.
It is not a big storm â only a sugges
tion of some swirling, whirling tangle
of wind and mist which lies out in the
ocean off the coast of Washington,
waiting for a chance to break past the
line of mountains along the shore and
to sweep eastward over the country.
This big storm is coming, and may
pass the meridian of San Francisco
sometime to-night oh to-morrow, but
in the meantime the little one â small,
howt-ver. only in comparison to some
that ha\p passed and may pass again
âhas brought its rain and its snow,
and is now well on its way to the inte
rior to spread its blessings farther in
land.
The rain area reached from up the
toast beyond Point Reyes to below
Santa Cruz, ami not more than a few
miles in from the shore, but as the
hours passed th< area grew larger
until at 5 o'clock it was reported from
nearly as Car east aa Stockton, and
down at Fresno and San Luis Obispo
the dispatches told of cloudy skies and
jubilant farmers.
It was snowing along the coast above
Point Reyes, and from the summit of
Mount Tamalpais came the message
that there was an inch of snow already
on the ground and no signs of cessa
tion. Kings City, down in the Salinas
Valley, told of more rain, and from
Red Bluff came the report of more
snow at that place and along the foot
hills. To a weather man snow is the
same as rain, so the beneficial effect of
the storm must be measured from the
Salinas plains to the mountains above
Eureka, with the night still to pass
and the larger storm coming on from
the west to fulfill the promise of its
smaller companion.
The storm may be a very big one or
it may notâ that is something which
will have to be developed later: but it
has. been platted by th- weather of
fice and its course baa been outlined
as crossing the extreme northern part
of the State. The low path of the
smaller center will have a tendency to
bring it to the south, and while the
little will water the southern plains
the big one, if it comes up to the con
tract, will bring full and plenty to the
northern valleys and hillsides.
With the rain, however, has come the
â wind, and things were lively along the
water front in consequence yesterday.
Old Boreas seemed to be soVely per
plexed as to which point of the compass
to seheet for his bellows, so he com
promised by blowing from every direc
tion. There was a south wind piping
up the coast in the morning, hut this
pave place to as good a blow from the
â west. In the afternoon it veered
around to the southeast, and while it
sang merrily among the housetops of
the city from that side, it was blowing
a gale from the northwest at Point
Reyes, thirty miles away. It was clearly
mixed between the two storm centers,
for nature's law demands that it blow
toward one or the other, but when the
big "low" arrives there will be no inde
cision. Ship captains are getting their
heaviest hawsers ready and are put
ting out extra anchors and slacking off
more fathoms of chain, pilots squint
at the clouds and predict a heavy bar,
and longshoremen are preparing to
turn an honest penny by helping some
restless ship to hold m to the wharf or
keep her from chafing her sides or
grinding her bows n< the waves come
to the aid of the humming winds.
A number of vessels ready to sail for
the north have decided to remain in
port to aw;>it a <harsre in the weather.
The British torpedo destroyer Sparrow
hawk and the cruiser Phaeton put to
tea yesterday, however, and the little
boat is likely to have a lively time of
it on the Oregon coast.
The Oakland boats did not get very
much of the storm, but Tiburon and
Sausalito steamers got the full benefit
of the swell that came in through the
Golden Gate. They pitched and tossed
at a great rate, and in convquence
there were no passengers on them save
those whom business brought to the
city.
The rain stopped all work along the
front, and East street had quite a de
serted appearance.
The most bedraggled man to be seen,
from Mfigers wharf to th^ Mail dock
was George A. Knight, the attorney.
Whenever there is any heavy weather
on the bay. hr- is hound to be out in
it on his launch the Athlete. Yester
day he got all he wanted of salt water.
He was soaked from head to foot, and
the cabin of the launch was flooded.
Mr. Knight only laugher! at his wet
ting, and said he felt a month younger
than he did when leaving his office
early in the afternoon.
Forecaster H.-.mnion of the Weather
Bureau believes the big storm will
bring at least an inch of rain before it
passes over the State. That it is com
ing is sure, from the fact that the
winds at Fort Canby, on the "Washing
ton coast, are blowing straight from
the east and are increasing hourly.
They are hurrying toward the ap
proaching storm center and are gather
ing velocity as they draw nearer. At E
yesterday afternoon there had been no
rain reported from there, but Mr. Ham
mon expected to hear of a downpour
before this morning.
The value of the shower can hardly
be estimated. The dairying sections
and the cattlemen had to have it or
the cattle would have had to he re
moved to other sections where the
grass keeps green longer. It has come
just in time, and when the irresponsi
ble little "low" has led Its older brother
out of the State and given some idle
"high" a chance, the farmers will be
in cloverâ if the "low" does not overdo
things.
TELEGRAPHIC REPORTS.
Snowstorms and Rainfall All Over
the State.
MARYSVTLiUC Jan. 11.â The heavy
frosts and cold weather of two weeks
past were topped off this evening with
a slight fall of snow, which commenced
at 4:30 o'clock and continued at in
tervals for three hours. At no time,
however, was the precipitation heavy
enough to coat the ground, the snow
melting away in the face of a chill
north wind as soon as it came in con
tact with terra firma. The thermome
ter at 8 o'clock was 32 degrees, with
snow still falling. It is not thought
that the cold snap will seriously affect
the fruit crop. It is now fourteen
jrean since Marysville witnessed a
snowstorm.
NEVADA CITY. Jan. 11.â The cold
weather of the past three days has
shortened the water supply in the

had to quit entirely to-day, and the
Providence Company will shut down.
This morning the thermometer pot
down to IT degrees, hut the tempera
ture Is rapidly moderating, and it is
thought there Will be BO more trouble.

ELM IRA, Cal.. Jan. 11.â The pros
peÂ» ts nf a drought throughout this part
Of California have been dispelled by re
cent rains. While the rainfall last y-ar
measured 12.65, against r>.9o fur " the
present season, the rains have been so
uniform this spring that farmers have
been enabled tcr put in a larger acre
age of grain up to the present time
than fur several preceding seasons,
which, with the spring rains that are
alnn^t assured by the lisht fall up to
the present time, promises this section
"f the country a larger yield of grain
than it has had for several years p:ist.
It has been raining steadily for the last
five hours.

a heavy fall of snow in this valley to
day, varying in d^pth from one to three
inches. Early this morning the ther
m< meter dropped to 24, the lowest in
yÂ°ars, with clouds overhead, which
commenced to drop their fleecy con
tents at 10 o'clock, snow falling at in
tervals until fi o'clock to-night. An
odd and unusual sight was that of par
ties of snowballers frolicking among
orange trees loaded down with gotden
fruit, peeping forth from a snowy cov
ering. The snow came at an opportune
time t< save the orange crop. So far
citrus fruits have escaped damask by
frost. Young grain will be benefited
by Hie snow.
ST. HELENA. Jan. 11.â The oldest
inhabitants say the present cold weath
er has had no equal for thirty years.
For several mornings the thermometer
has bften below 20, the ground is frozen
and ice half an inch thick forms every
night over ponds. On Sunday there
was sufficient snow to whiten the
ground So far the heavy nightly frosts
have not damaged growing vegetntion
except to ruin the olive yield for pick
ling purposes. The frost will not inter
foff, however, with the extraction of the
oil. It beiran snowing again about noon
to-day and continued all the aftei -iv on.
The town turned out en masse. th<* en
tire population engaging in snowball
ins until darkness.

f;il of rain in the valley has not been
heavy so far.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. There has
been no rain here except the shower
on Saturday evening, and no change
is reported in the condition of the
crops. There was a sprinkle here this
evening and a few flakes of snow fell,
but melted as soon as they struck the
ground. Persons who came up from
San Francisco to-night report quite a
snowstorm along the road in Solano
County, with the ground covered.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 11.â Sonoma
County received a good rain to-day,
bringing the seasonal rainfall up to
eight inches. No crop has suffered for
lack of moisture, but the rain will
greatly benefit the pastures and early
sown grain. It will also make plowing
more easy. -.*;

BOWS TO
THE BOARD
Writes of "Pernicious
Activity" and Gal
lery Plays.
The Election of Director
Holden's Successor Is
Again Postponed.
It Goes Over Until March Next
on the Motion of Arthur
Rodgers.
AN EXECUTIVE SESSION.
Suggestion That a Dairy School Be
Added to the College of
Agriculture. â 
There were two sessions of the Board
of Resents of the State University yes
terday and Judge Waymire attended
both. A communication from the
Judge -was read at the afternoon
session. It was in response to a let
ter addressed to him by the secretary
of the board. At the regular meet-
Ing of the repents in December, Gov
ernor Budd called attention to the pro
longed absence of Regent Waymire and
announced that under the rules he
would declare the place vacant and ap
point a man who would attend to the
official duties of the position If Way
mire failed to explain his absence in a
satisfactory manner. The secretary was
therefore directed to notify Judge Way
mire of the Governor's intention. Re
sponding to the secretary's communi
cation the regent wrote that he had
lived In California twenty-eight years
and served the public without com
pensation for twenty years of that pe
riod. He/mentioned two terms of ser
vice in the State Legislature and indi
cated that his chief reason for accept
ing legislative burdens was to place
himself in a position where he could
serve the university to advantage. In
conclusion he wrote:
Knowing that the university was in the
hands of capable officers and committees
and that my b< rvtces were not needed
at every metinp. I took the liberty of
omitting attendance at some of the
meeting:?. I l.et, r to assure the board that
I meant no discourtesy and have lost no
part of my interest in the university. On
the contrary, I hope to be of material
service to it in the"' future. Activity in
such a good cause is commendable." but
there is such a thing :is "pernicious ac
tivity"â"playing to the galleries." That
I leave to others.
Excuses were made at the meeting
for several absent regents. John E.
Budd sent a letter setting forth that
professional engagements required his
presence elsewhere. It was said by
Regent Hallidie that Albert Miller was
in bed threatened with pneumonia. It
was said that Judge Wallace was sick
in bed. Regent Reinstein, who had
been excused on account of professional
business, looked in at the session.
The board met at 11 a. m. and when
the members and spectators began to
take some little interest in the proceed
ings Mr. Hallidie deemed it prudent to
gro into executive session and the press
reporters were thereupon excluded. The
matter discussed ir. secret related to uni
versity loans. There was an outside
Impression that the regents had found
the printing- establishment at Berkeley
a more expensive concern than they
fancied It would be.
The afternoon session was in no se>ns^
exciting or exhilarating. On motion of
Regent Rodg^rs the regular meeting
day In March next was appointed as
the time for electing a director of Lick
Observatory to succeed Professor Hol
den.
Recent Phelps wanted the election
appointed for an earlier date, but the
Rodgers motion prevailed.
Judge Slack gave a brief history of
the purchase of eighty acres of land
adjoining the Lick Observatory reser
vation by Professor Holden. The pur
chase was made at a time when the un
iversity did not have $350 to spare,
hence Mr. Hold^n bought the property
on his own account, trusting tha.t the
university would take It off his hands
at the same figureâ s3so. It was agreed
that the land was needed to square
up a corner of the tract, and the mat
ter of purchase was referred to a com
mittee.
Regent Denlcke moved that $10,000
be . appropriated from the next budget
to establish and maintain a dairy de
partment in connection with the Col
lege of Agriculture. He remarked that
the value of the dairy output of Cali
fornia for the year 1896 was $13,000,
000. Figures for 1897 were not availa
ble, but the regent was confident that
the value of the output was largely in
excess of that of the previous year.
The topic was discussed for some lit
tle time and then the whole subject
matter was referred to a committee
consisting of Regents Chase, Denicke,
Marye. Mrs. Hearst and the president
of the university.
Lieutenant S. A. Colman, U. S. A.,
military instructor at the university,
was authorized to organize and drill
a bucket brigade. The danger of fire
in South Hall was mentioned.
Regents attending yesterday were*
Phelps, presiding; Waymire. Slack.
Black, Chase, Kellogg, Mrs. Hearst.
Houghton, H.illtdle, Denicke. Tollman!
Marye, Reinstein, Foote and Rod
gers.
Next Saturday there will be a meet
ing of regents to discuss the present
standing and the prospects of the
university.
BURGLARS FOND OF LIGHT.
Thieves Entered the Residerjce of
J. Perrington While the pan)ily
Was at Church.
Burglar? broke into the residence of
J. Perrington, 466 Frederick street, on
Sunday evening while the family was
at church, and ransacked the house.
They gained entrance through the
front door by means of skeleton keys.
They succeeded in getting a way with a
suit of clothing, $25 in cash and a quan
tity of jewelry. They left the house the
way they entered it and left no trace
that would lead to their identity. They
lighted nearly every gas jet in the
house, and when the family returned
they found their residence in a blaze of
light.

KUHLMAN
GOT HIS
QUIETUS
Desired Letter Against
Hirschfelder Never
Came.
Charge of Unprofessional
Conduct Not Sus
tained.
But Happersberger's Report
Scorched the Cooper Col
lege Man.
VOTES FLOORED ACCUSER.
Many Feel That Injustice, Compara
tively Speaking, Was Done
to D'Evelyn.
Dr. Joseph O. Hirschfelder Is still a
member in good standing of the Coun
ty Medical Society, and Dr. Charles
THE FAIR SEX BANISHED FROM THE COSMOS CLUB.
O. Kuhlman's guns have been spiked
to a finish. Dr. Fred D'Kvelyn must
gnash his teeth in outer darkness and
bewail his fate alone.
Oxytuberculin triumphs â there can
be no do-Ã¼bt of that. Everything was
decided at the monthly meeting: of the
County Medical Society last evening.
A fight was expected over the report
of the committee on ethics, and conse
quently the hall was crowded, about a
hundred physicians beingpresent. many
of them being graduates of Cooper
Medical College.
Two reports were brought in; a ma
jority report signed by Chairman
Thorn and Drs. Davis. Sherman and
Taylor, and a minority report signed
by Dr. Happerpbcrgfr. Both were read
by Chairman Thorn.
The majority report recited In legal
phrase that Dr. Kuhlman had preferred i
, charges of unprofessional conduct \
I against Hirschfelder on the grounds '
that he had had circulars published !
i telling of his oxytubereulin treatment
fur consumption and had gone to the
newspapers, thus violating article 3.
section 1 rf the American Medical
i Code; that both the accuser and the .
; man charged by him were reputable i
, physicians; that the fact that Dr. j
! Hirschfelder had done these things was
much to be deplored, but that the '
; blame lay mostly with the dally press
i for bringing so much pressure to bear
! in securing information on these sub
j jects. After mature consideration, the
report read, the charges did not have
evidence enough to sustain them.
Dr. Happersberger in the minority
report not only believed Hirschfelder
guilty of unprofessional conduct, hut
thought the fact especially deplorable
on account <>f the accused man's stand
ing in the medical world.
Kuhlman at once made a vigorous
' effort to argue the case, but was ruled
out of order. Th<>n he wanted to have
a secret ballot, but failed also in that.
j Then he wanted the minority report
i voted on first. He was told that tho
| only parliamentary method in such a
| case would be to move that the minor
ity report be substituted for the ma
] jority report in priority of considera-
I tion.
"Then I do that," he shouted, jump- ;
ing to his feet. Evidently he meant
this peculiar sentence as a motion, but i
there was no second and the majority
report was adopted by a large ma
jority.
"Now, then," yelled Kuhlman. as !
soon as the result was manifest, "1 i
move that Dr. D'Evelyn be reinstated j
into good standing in this society. It
is an utterly unfair proceeding to make
bird of one and fish of the other."
By this time there was a gentle mur
mur of enjoyment in the air and all
present with the solitary exception of |
Dr. Kuhlman wore broad smiles on I
their countenances. The motion had
no second, and died a speedy death.
There are a good many who do not
believe that justice has been done
comparatively speaking. These medi
cos protest that everything has to go !
Cooper Collegeward la the society, and !
they don't lik.' it a little bit.
But, anyway. Dr. Buckley is still left
to fight Hirschfelder outside the fold
of the society, with the City and Coun
ty Hospital inmates as defenders to the
death.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1898.
LIKE THE
PERI AT
THE GATE
Ladies Ask in Vain to
Be Let in the Cos
mos Club.
Crusty Old Bachelors Who
Ruthlessly Say "Nay,
Nay."
Stand Ready to Worship a
Warrior Bold Who Won't
Be Adored.
%
TALE OF BLIGHTED LOVE.
HopÂ© That the Members Will Ca
pitulate in the Near
Future.
They do say that !t is all on account
of a tale of blighted affection, but nev
ertheless the fact remains that the Cos
mos Club won't raise its latch strings
and let the ladies in.
And it is not because they have not
asked, nay, begged, implored, that they
be accorded the same privileges as their
fathers, husbands, brothers and other
girls' brothers. They and a goodly por
tion of their fathers, etc., etc., etc.,
have, figuratively speaking, of course,
gone down on their knees to the pow
ers that be, but in vain. Several crus
ty old bachelors are determined to keep
them out, and unless startling changes
in the management of the club come
about, out forever they shall be.
All the latest and most approved
fashions of melting the male resolution
have been tried, and, alas! frnind hope
lessly wanting. Tears were of no avail.
Facts, undeniable facts, backed . by
choicest rhetoric and soundest argu
ment, were brushed aside, and in face
of a forbidding lack of fippreclation for
the better half of humanity, melted
like a snow bank exposed to the burn
ing rays of the midday sun.
Even the law of precedent availed
nothing. The courtesy of the swell Bo
hemian Club dinners, all the more de
lightful because of the presence of the
ladies, tales of suppers at the Univer
sity Club, all duly labeled as Ex
hibit A. B, etc., was submitted in de
fense, but all sternly and decidedly ob
jected to. The strangest part of the
strange refusal to admit ladies within
the sacred precincts of the conserva
tive Coamoa <Mub is that the majority
of the club members are army and
navy men. All ladies stand ever ready
to w<rrship warriors bold, and the ado
ration in 9!> cases out of 100 is always
returned and more than appreciated.
Then the Cosmos Club has unusual
facilities for the entertainment of la
dies. Th<^re are side doors innumera
ble. There is an entrance right under
the main staircase and another that
opens into Octavia street. These en
trances lead direct to the private din
ing hall, and if the ladies are bound
over t.> use them the sterner sex Is
restricted to the main entrance. No
man who fears to meet a lady needs
to. Further, the halls are full of
nooks that will assist the bashful club
members to hide until the rustle of
silken skirts is lost to keenest ears;
and then there is the garret, large,
commodious and capable of acccommo
dating any number of them. It is
said that in the question of lady ad
mittance the dub is most unevenly
divided. Fair woman has many
stanch adherents, who stand ready to
battle for her, and an unusually large
majority who are opposed to her. with
in the portals of the club. No definite
reason is advanced for this violent op
position save an oft-repeated and gruff
"We don't want woman in this club."
Ramor has it that a warrior bold,
with a magnificent war recordâLieu
tenant Runcie â is one of the most vio
lent oppoaers, and the same reliable
source of information goes on to state
that a sad, sad past, in which a tale of
blighted love figures conspicuously. Is
the main cause of the decided opposi
tion.
However be that as It may, the ladles
can't get inâ Just at present. They
hope, however, to gain their point, and
in the meantime are going to play for
the return of "ladies' luncheon day"â
annual affairâ likÂ« in the good old days
whpn J. M. Cunningham and Colin M
Hoyd had the management of the club
in their capable hands.

KING OF
COINERS IN
THE TANKS
The Celebrated Race
track Bunko Man
Under Arrest.
Captured Last Evening by
Detectives Dillon and
Crockett.
A Full Set of Tools Found in His
Room on Golden Gate Ave
nue and Larkin Street.
EVIDENCE IS CONCLUSIVE.
It Is Said That the Prisoner Was Mak
ing Desperate Efforts to Reach
the Klondike.
The celebrated race track counter
feiter was captured by Dillon and
Crockett, assisted by Wren and Dlnan,
last evening.
For days past the police department
was aware that a man was in the city
who answered the description of a per
son long wanted. In consequence, Dil
lon and Crockett were detailed on the
case, and last evening Gilbert Kindall,
who resides on Golden Gate avenue,
near Larkin street, was imprisoned in
the tanks.
In Chief Lees' office it was learned
that the counterfeiter had a complete
outfit in his possession. Acids, molds,
presses and metals were found in quan
tities in two valises in the room. Nine
$10 pieces, all ready for market, and
the same number of unfinished coins,
as well as a number of $5 coins were
found in the room in the lodging-house
on Golden Gate avenue, near Larkin
street.
A year ago it is supposed the same
man passed counterfeit coins in pool
boxes on the local race courses, but
no trace of him was discovered, al
though it was reported to the contrary.
The coins were a good imitation of the
government output and the arrest is
necessarily an important one.
Many letters were found in the room,
but the addresses and names were both
destroyed. On- .signed E. L. S. and an
other mentioning the name of E. L.
Taylor frequently referred to the Klon
dike, and it is thought the victim had
taken desperate chances to get to the
Alaska gold fields.
The arrested man endeavored to pass
a spurious coin in the Thalia a few
rights ago, but the trick was discuv
f-red, and the criminal fled.
Tn the room whpre he resided it was
told that he had often stayed up during
the night, and that strange filing noises
were often heard. It is possibly through
the*landlady's efforts that the man was
captured, but the .-. Idress is kept se
cret by the police authorities.
The room, when searched, looked like
a I'nited States Mint. Coin, dies, acids
and metals wore strewn about, and the
evidence against the culprit is piled
feet high.
He states that he has been in the city
but three weeks, and the statement is
partially believed, as it is known that
he ha? Imposed upon the racing circuit
during the past year or so.
The captun- is thought to be especial
ly clever.
TIREY L. FORD
TO LEAD THEM
Annual Meeting and Election
of the Union League
Club.
Reports Show That the Organization
Has Enjoyed Â« Year of
Prosperity.
The regular meeting and annual elec
tion of the Union League Club was
held in its rooms at the Palace Hotel
last evening
Reports were read from the various
officers showing the club to be in an
even better condition than it was gen
erally supposed to be. which, by the
way. Is saying a great deal. The treas
urer's report in particular showed a
gain of thousands of dollars over last
year.
By far th<> most interesting part of
the session was the election of officers
for the ensuing year, for while tbe old
officers have faithfully attended to
their duties, they considered it but
just to step out and make room for
others, and on the other hand there is
so much good material in the club
that it was found somewhat difficult to
make a â elecUOÃ.
When the votes were counted and the
announcement made that the Hon.
Tirey L. Ford had captured the office
of president it was hailed with general
satisfaction, and Mr. Ford, who is con
sidered one of the brightest mining
lawyers in the State, has the honor of
being the youngest man who ever
graced the presidents' chair in the
club. He responded gracefully to the
calls for a speech and at its conclu
sion was applauded again and again.
At the close of the meeting speeches
were made hy all the retiring officers
as well as the newly elected ones â the
old ones recounting what had been
done in the past, and the new outlin
ing plans which prophesy a most bril
liant future for the club.
The complete list of officers elected is
as follows: Hon. Tirey 1... Ford, pres
ident; General N. P. Chipman, first
vice-president; T. J. Parsons, second
vice-president; S. J. Hendy. secretary;
I. W. Hellman Jr.. treasurer; Revenue
Collector John Lynch. J. P. Le Count.
A. G. Booth. T. K. Stateler, George C.
Clark and Arthur W. Spear, directors.
Returned to Sacran>ento.
Harold Pllklngton, who was arrested
In a clever manner Sunday morning by
Detective Tom Gibson, was taken to Sac
ramento last evening by Sheriff J. Fer
ris. He had been charged with felony
embezzlement, and as there is a strong
case against him it Is thought San
Quentln will be his goal.

HURLED
WATER AND
EPITHETS
Judge Daingerfield's
Court a Lively
Scene.
Lawyers Quarrel and
One Is Sprinkled and
Called a Liar.
Attorneys Terry and Raymond
Forget the Amenities
of the Bar.
"A DIRTY, LYING DOG."
Retort Courteous Which Followed
a Speech Before a
Jury.
"You are a lying, dirty dog:." Thes*
words from the lips of Attorney Reel B.
Terry, his face crimsoned and frame
trembling with anger, followed an in
stant later by a dash of water from a
handy glass which found repose on the
face of Albert Raymond, upset the calm
dignity of Judge Daingerfield's depart
ment of the Superior Court yesterday
afternoon, and all but turned it into
a field of warring lawyers, bailiffs and
spectators. The voice of the court above
the din, however, the quick action of
a Deputy Sheriff and the serenity with
which Mr. Raymond accepted the ap
pellation, and the water, averted blood
shed, and the jury, with a sigh as one
man, calmed itself for a renewal of
proceedings.
It was during the trial of the action
of Mrs. Eva Martin for damages
against Walter Morosco, proprietor of
Morosco's Opera-house, for injur
ies received by the running away
of one of the defendant's horses
about two years ago, when the court
proceedings were so suddenly and vio
lently discontinued by the wrath of
Reel B. Terry. Early in the afternoon
a cloud of trouble began to show itself
on the legal horizon and shortly after
wnrd the Goddess of Peace on startled
wings abandoned the court room to the
lawyers and to Ate. Argument com
menced and the unfriendly spirit exist
ing began to become more strained.
Finally Porter Ashe, of counsel for "Mrs.
Martin and associated with Terry, in
terrupted Attorney Raymond when he
referred to the pleadings in the case,
and the interrupted man grasped a
copy of the complaint and in an angry
mood hurled it at Ashe. Ashe ducked
as though a flatiron were coming his
direction, and then with a smile on his
face made a jesting remark. Raymond,
thoroughly angry, turned again to the
jury and continued, in his argument.
After explaining the merits of his side
of the case and tossing a few parting
shots at the opposing counsel he took
his seat.
Terry then rose to address the jury.
After recognizing the court and the
twelve men in the box, he survoy. <i
his opponent for a minute and began
to speak. He explained the injuries
sustained by his client and the law of
negligence bearing: on the case at bar,
and then turned his attention to a per
sonal summing up of the witnesses in
the case, as to their interest in the ac
tion at issue and their reputation for
veracity. One witness, Duncan Forbes,
a hack driver, who had testified when
his deposition was taken that he had
seen the defendant's horse mad with
fright plunging along th<Â» street, turn
onto the sidewalk and hurl the plain
tiff to the ground, unconscious, occu
pied considerable of Mr. Terry's time.
During the course of the trial Attor
ney Raymond had taken the stand,
and testified that the hack driver had
informed him that had Mrs. Martin
made an effort she could have escaped
injury.
Terry compared these two state
ments, and said that he would believe
the original story of the driver, in
which event he must disbelieve that of
the attorney. "This man. my oppo
nent." said Terry, "has seen fit to take
the stand and tell the story he had
fixed up for the exculpation of this man
Iforoaco. I have seen the day when
lawyers guarded their reputations as a
father the purity of his daughter."
Raymond bounded to his feet at this,
and asked the court to request Terry
to discontinue such a course, and to ex
plain to the Jury that his action in go
ing on the stand was not unprofession
al. The court remained silent, as he
saw no cause to interfere with the line
of Terry's argument, and Terry con
tinued to speak. Again he referred to
the action of Raymond in going on the
stand, and Raymond again interrupted.
Then Terry's anger was at fever heat,
and in a voice that rang out into the
corridors of the hall he accused Ray
mond of going on the stand and trying
to swear his case through.
"I would believe the driver before op
posing counsel under oath," he said,
and before he could continue Ray
mond retorted, "And I would not be
lieve you at all." Terry was inside the
rail within two feet of Raymond and
when he heard the retort he leaned
over and shouted, â 'You are a dirty,
lying dog:" Before him ou a table
lay a glass containing a small quan
tity of water. He grasped this and
leaning over the rail tossed the con
tents Into Raymond's face.
Raymond was nonplussed for the
time, but the shout of the Judge, "Mr.
Terry, you are in contempt of this
court. This will never do! This will
never do!" brought him back to a real
ization of his position. When Terry ad
dressed the opposing counsel in a mega
phone voice a Deputy Sheriff bounded
across the courtroom to stop the trou
ble, but the words of the court were
sufficient. When Terry heard the
words adjudging him guilty of con
tempt he said, "Very well, your Hon
or," and turning on his heel began to
address the jury again, with surpris
ing calmness. After grilling Morosco
and his counsel for a time Terry left
his case In the hands of the jury and
walked outside the rail. The jury was
instructed by the court, and when it
had retired to deliberate on a verdict
Judge Daingerfleld left the bench. He
told Terry that in event he came into

BRANDED AS
IN COLLUSION
Harbor Commissioners Com
plained Against by Samuel
C. Irving.
He Has Brought Suit to Enjoin Them
From Committing Further
Indiscretions.
The difficulty over the preparation of
the piles for Green street wharf to pro
tect them from the hungry teredoes
has been transferred to the courts,
and in an action filed yesterday by
Samuol C. Irving the Harbor Commis
sioners have practically been charged
with collusion. Samuel C. Irving in
his action asks that the Harbor Com
missioners, E. L. Colnon, F. S. Chad
burne and P. J. Harvey, be enjoined
from committing certain acts the
plaintiff alleges are contrary to law,
right and justice.
It is alleged by the plaintiff upon in
formation and belief that the Harbor
Commissioners are in collusion with
the San Francisco Timber Preserving
Company and are unlawfully award
ing that corporation contracts. The
Green street wharf contract and all
other contracts where piles are to be
used for a year to come have been
awarded the San Francisco Preserving
Company, it is alleged. During the
past year contracts aggregating $50,
000 have been awarded the lucky com
pany, and it is charged in the com
plaint that the prices paid it were
greatly in excess of the bids of the
Parafflne Paint Company.
It is charged that such action on the
part of the Harbor Commission is in
violation of law and is collusion. The
complaint goes on to state that the
commission, by clever evasion of the
law, has been enabled to carry out its
plan and the alleged plan is explained.
In order to evade the law the con
tracts were awarded in small parcels
of $3000 or less, it is stated. In this way
the law requiring advertisements for
bids and open competition was not
transgressed, and entire contracts for
heavy work eventually fell into the
hands of the San Francisco Timber
Preserving Company.
Another alleged plan to evade com
petition was to insert in the published
applications for bids directing that
certain patented machinery for the
preserving of timber must be used,
and it is intimated that in consequence
no company but the San Francisco
could compete, as that corporation
owned the machinery required to be
used by the commission. The clause
in the advertisements requiring the use
of the certain machinery, the plaintiff
alleges, was inserted at the request of
the San Francisco Company, which
goes to show that collusion exists, and
the court is asked to demand a dis
continuance of such practice.
At the special request of the litigants
Presiding Judge Belcher will hear the
case when it comes to trial. Interest
ing developments are expected, but in
the meantime the teredoes will eat and
be merry.
In the Divorce Courts.
Sadie Budd was granted a divorce from
her husband, JLeander Budd, by Judge
Bahrs yesterday on the ground of failure
to provide. Edith May Coflley was al
towed her application for a divorce from
William C. Coffey. The decree was grant
ed on the ground of cruelty. Louise de
Vecchio was granted a divorce from
Stephen Vecchio by Judge Hebbard on
the ground of willful neglect.
